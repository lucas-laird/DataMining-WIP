77517,2016-07-10,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,Unorganized! Terrible terrible service. Toddlers could have done a better job. They don't even have enough plates to serve the people at the tables. Been sitting at my table for over 30 min and they havent taken our order and we haven't even gotten drinks. Soy container is filthy with dust and wasabi is old.

103636,2016-07-27,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"This is the first time trying this place, and it was pretty disappointing. When we first parked outside, 5 staff members were standing there and on their phones playing Pok√©mon (there was a lure set inside lol) and one of them says ""you're the first customers we've had in hours!"" 

.....I don't wanna hear that as we come inside. And the guy taking our order didn't know much about the food and told us ""the server is talking to the manager, I'm just the guy in the back of the house who makes the sauces..."" But when we asked him for Screaming O sauce (or orgasm sauce) he didn't know what that was, even though it's in some of their rolls... 

The server (when she finally came to us) got parts of our order wrong multiple times and we had to repeat ourselves and correct her. Edamame came out way after our other food. Server took forever to come take another order for us, and our 1 hour time limit for Deluxe Menu (for $32.99!!!) was almost up. We could have ordered more for food and had a better experience, but the service was definitely not on par. 

Also, when some of the workers' friends walked in the door, one of the sushi chefs yells ""okay now that this guy walked in, everyone can leave now! Everyone out!"" Like, okay...that's not professional and makes this place look bad. Sorry, but it does.

Last roll that we ordered had taken way too long to order, and when I mentioned something to the server, she said ""they're still making the order."" Then she comes back and says ""wait, what did you order again?"" I said ""I don't want it anymore, it's okay."" And she said ""no I was looking for your ticket...what did you get?"" And my friend said the name of the roll...and then 30 seconds later she said their almost done with it. Yeah...okay...we couldn't even finish it because it took too long to come out. That sucks.

Food was okay, maybe 3/5 stars, but service was not there 1/5.",2rOIut17Zai5Rw4BiB5JKg,0,0,1,r4CRg9QEbNwU7GDcDDvoQQ

231655,2012-02-25,1,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I was in the mood for sushi and this place was right down the street from where I live. For $19.95 all you can eat - I though it wouldn't be too bad.

The service was mediocre. Waitress was uncommunicative and kept calling management over when we had simple questions. 

The food was terrible. Artificial ground up crab. Too much rice. Really weird sushi rolls. Bizarre sauces. Bacon bits? Seriously!! Not authentic in the slightest and they fish was not fresh at all. 

We kept getting food delivered to us that we didn't order. 

Finally, when we were done attempting to eat what we had ordered, we had approximately half of one roll, and one or two pieces from a two other rolls left. When our waitress came we asked if we could take the food home (I am never one who likes to leave food on my plate even if I don't intend to eat it. Don't want to be rude). Her response: 

No. You must eat everything you order or they charge the AYCE fee plus the individual charges for the individual rolls. And you can't take anything home with you. Theses weren't even half rolls!! One piece left and they would charge us for the whole roll! The waitress did not inform us of this policy when we EXPLICITLY asked her when we sat down!!! I was infuriated. 

We finished what we could of the disgusting rolls until practically vomiting and then were charged $19.95 plus an additional $15 for two pieces left of one roll. 

It was the most unpleasant experience of my sushi eating life.

302818,2013-10-03,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Pros: The sushi chefs are very pleasant, the fish is very fresh, appetizers and rolls taste pretty good, and it's an affordable lunch price of $14.99 which comes to $16 something with tax. 

Cons: The waitress is wildly unpleasant and watches over everyone like a hawk. They get orders mixed up very easily, even when the restaurant isn't packed, and they aim to make you eat as little as possible. The latter really cheapens the place.

I normally frequent Sushi Twister, but I was nowhere near that side of town when I had my sushi craving so I looked up sushi reviews and figured I would give this place a try because it was less than a mile away. I should have trusted the people who made more recent reviews on several websites. I had kept reading reviews where people would complain that the service isn't what it used to be and that the rolls are 90% rice and have gone down in quality. Much to my dismay, this is ALL true. 

I went in solo, sat at the bar. Right off the bat I realize that this place advertises free wifi, but they do NOT have wifi that you can tap into. I order the baked dynamite scallop appetizer and the mussels appetizer and my first roll to try was the Downtown roll. I was brought a two-piece scallop sushi roll. That was it. I was like ""Uh, no. I ordered the scallop APPETIZER."" so they took it back and I waited several minutes before I got anything else. 

The next thing they brought me was the Downtown roll. Which I noticed immediately weighs like fourteen pounds. I told myself ""Okay, maybe they just go heavy with the salmon on this roll."" I tried it, it was pretty great. But the roll was so heavy that I had trouble getting through it. (The lunch is AYCE so I was annoyed that I was already getting full). Next they brought out the dynamite scallops. Which were piping hot and very fresh and had really flavorful mushrooms and cheese in it. Loved it. I waited for my order of mussels and it never came. Next roll I ordered was the Lisa Lisa. I ordered it because it was a five piece roll and I wanted to try at least three or four rolls while there. 

The Lisa Lisa arrived and I was immediately annoyed. It was huge. It was heavy. Yes, it was tasty. BUT. They put sooo much extra rice in the roll. It was completely ridiculous. After that five piece roll I was bordering on full and knew that I shouldn't push it and order a third roll because you PAY for what you DON'T finish eating. I was still annoyed they never brought my mussels so I glanced up behind the bar and noticed one of the workers grabbing an order of already-done mussels and tossing it in the trash. Because it had been sitting for too long. So that answers where my order of mussels were. They made it in the back and then the workers up front never brought it out to me. I ordered a fresh batch and it was brought out to me in about another ten minutes. It was very fresh and very tasty but by that point I was too annoyed for words to fully enjoy it. 

So, there you have it. If you decide to go to this restaurant, know that they use MASS amounts of sticky rice to fill you up so you'll order less food. That's tacky and has pissed me off to the point where I had to make sure I post this review on as many sites as possible. Legitimate sushi restaurants lets the FISH speak for itself and don't need to drown their rolls in rice. Expect unpleasant waitresses. I left her a tip of $3 and she didn't even deserve that much. Very displeased with this restaurant. Nobody can measure up to Sushi Twister!",bQKz18TPCxvi_UJmFwdgjA,3,0,3,E1xHqtDqzY8U5-pvM6xQOg

323066,2011-10-07,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Once upon a time I would have given this place 5 stars for their great price and quality. Most of their rolls are fried and fill you up really fast, but they are interesting and pretty good. Side dishes are also good, especially the tuna ones that are presented like flavored sashimi. Not true sashimi since its been tainted with flavors, but still good. 

This past trip was our third visit and the yellow tail that we usually get a lot of wasn't very fresh, so they tried to drizzle their vinegar/soy sauce over it to mask the taste. 

The cuts of fish were very small and the amount of rice seemed to get bigger with each round orders. 

Most of these changes are likely due to the change in management, but for $15 all you can eat for lunch it is all right. Not great good anymore, but decent good. My opinion might also be a bit of a sushi snob since I've eaten so much of it from everywhere. If I can wait then I'd rather just have sushi in Reno for a similar price when I go back to visit.",VssuU5Ni6g455MTx3Y7YWg,0,0,3,I_JXCl0lgQalO5ChiryIoQ
336275,2016-10-04,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I live across town so would never drive way up here for a place I've never heard of, but a friend told us about the $15 AYCE dinner special going on at the moment. So we tried it. Won't ever be back. Just because you are having a special doesn't mean you drop the quality of food. Nothing was fresh except for the salty ass teriyaki chicken (came with some cold rice too). The cooked rolls tasted like they were made in the morning and left out all day. I love the 2 piece raw sushi rolls but the ones here made me gag and had undone rice. The server didn't know much and her favorite word was ""uh"". Anything on the AYCE menu they don't want to give you for the $15 special will simply be ""all out today"". I don't mind the dessert not being included, but I wish they'd be honest about the other items not being included rather than saying they're all out. We figured this out when we ordered the seafood sashimi salad and was told they were all out but could order salmon, tuna, etc.
I ALMOST feel bad leaving this negative review due to only having one server for a full restaurant, but I strongly feel if you run a special that you should offer the same quality and have just as many people working to make sure these new customers keep coming back rather than leaving you a negative review.",0a0HUuVjUroPtWvZs5J-Ug,1,0,1,8fXmy1EEjlyg0qO0UaCfuA

Last night we ordered food to go. My 7 year old daughter asked for a California roll. We also ordered a Mexican roll, tiger roll, and spicy tuna roll. I got home about an hour and a half after the order was made.  The spicy tuna was a little fishy, but I figured it was because it was because it was in the fridge for an hour and a half. My daughter ate most of the California roll, and my sister and boyfriend had what she left. This evening, approximately 26 hours after eating the roll, my daughter started crying and complaining of a stomach ache (which she never does).  She then threw up seaweed and cucumber all over herself. I called the restaurant and the guy who answered was completely indifferent, but said he would pass my concern along to a manager, as there was no one there to take my call. A guy named Steve called me back and said they take these calls very seriously and suggested I take her to the doctor or emergency room. I told him I would keep an eye on her and take her in the morning if the symptoms didn't subside, but that I was concerned because all parties who ate the California roll were feeling ill, so I thought it may be the crab. He said they make five liters of crab at a time, and that they just got inspected by the health department and got an A grade. As I was on the phone with him, she started throwing up again. I called him back, and let him know that they could expect a bill from me if I indeed had to take her to the ER.  He then said that the experience was unfortunate, but that they are not liable!

We all did AYCE sushi (non-deluxe, no alcohol included). The food itself was decent, about what you'd expect from any run of the mill sushi place. A few above average rolls, but mostly average. The prices were more than our favorite local sushi places, but the options were worse, less of them, and lower quality.

The real problem though was the service. We ordered rolls about three times, and each time it took upwards of 20 minutes, in 1 case over a half hour to receive our food. And even little things like getting drink refills and bringing more wasabi/soy sauce took much longer than they should have. They either need more staff or better staff.

The two sushi chefs which are in plain view of the whole restaurant were clearly disorganized and/or had other priorities. Not only did I see people who came in well after us get serviced quicker, but I also saw them doing shots and chatting up friends of theirs at the bar rather than making rolls for everyone.

You can tell by the presentation and the taste of the food. No respect for the product at all. 

When the food arrived it looked like left over sushi on a plate. Flavors were off...the color of the fish were completely off. You can tell they left the frozen fish under water too long because you can see the color bled out of the tuna. Texture of the assorted fish was slimy and flakey. The ""eel"" they put on my rolls taste like cardboard and looked like its been sitting around for a few days. Everything about this place is gross and not sanitary. Including those ""chefs"" that touch everything doesn't wash their hands or use gloves...

Every item literally took over 20 mins when the restaurant was empty. I asked the server lady "" can I order more items?"" She responded "" u already ordered a lot of food so why don't you wait""... This is after sitting there for 45 mins with one roll....I found this disrespectful. This place is a joke. I will never return to this spot even if it was the last spot on earth that served fish.

1208905,2016-10-11,8,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"WHAT A DISASTER THIS PLACE IS.

So, we heard from some friends that they had an awesome special at this place -- where until October 15th, they would be having $10.00 AYCE lunch and $15.00 AYCE dinner! All-you-can-eat is originally $19.99 for lunch and $26.99 for dinner... what a steal, right?

And then it all made sense. 

It's evident they probably offered this deal to get more people in the door to help business and their ratings, but seriously -- what a disaster. 

For one, there was an option on Yelp to make a reservation. I booked ours 3.5 hours in advance and even got an email confirmation. We arrived 15 minutes early, but the guy at the register said they don't take reservations. I showed him the yelp confirmation and the e-mail, but he just shrugged me off and said they don't honor reservations. Okay. 

STRIKE ONE? Wait. Give it a chance, we said...

We wait about 30 minutes and get seated. Can I just say I've never been so uncomfortably cold at a restaurant before in my life? It was 80 degrees outside at 8:00PM... and I had to go grab a sweater from my car to drape over myself because I was freezing. Very odd, but there were people wearing leather jackets and scarves... and believe me, we are not in winter weather yet. 

STRIKE TWO? It's okay, maybe it'll be worth it, we said...

To top it off though, there was literally only one server. ONE SERVER. A full restaurant, every table full... and you're running an AYCE special. But there's only one server? It's like this place is asking for bad reviews! It took 10 minutes to get our drink order in, another 10 minutes to get our drinks and to finally be able to order... 

STRIKE THREE? Should we leave? But it's so cheap, we said...

Then, because of how backed up they were, we were told that we could ""ONLY ORDER 4 ITEMS AT A TIME TO KEEP AN EVEN FLOW TO EACH TABLE."" I have never ever heard of this order limit before and I'd like to say I'm an AYCE connoisseur... This is strike four, right? We should get out of here, right?

I do want to acknowledge the young man who was literally sprinting around from table to table, trying his best to accommodate everyone. Your hustle did not go unnoticed and it's not fair you got put into that position to cover the WHOLE restaurant by yourself by management on a Saturday night when they were running a special. 

But 20 more minutes went by and we still had not gotten any of our food yet. At this point we were just hangry (hungry x angry) and not to mention ridiculously cold... we were just over the situation, and were ready to just drive to another AYCE spot and were more than happy to spend double paying 30$ per person than continue through this torture.

We waited 40 minutes and we were the first ones there. And 2 other tables came it- not 10. They finally had the other chef hop on and everything came QUICK.

The quality was average. We used to love the rolls but they were mediocre at best. There was a hair in my roll, which is always disgusting. He promptly took it away and never brought us a fresh roll. He asked if we wanted the chef to make it again after we asked for the check. An obvious no, since we were ready to go. Nothing off the bill for the long wait or hair.

We were the only people in the restaurant the entire 1.5 hours we were there, and the service was worse than its ever been on a busy day.  
When I got my water, in a small plastic cup with what appeared to be a burn mark on the rim of the cup, I drank it all and waited a while before having to ask for a refill. I guess they were out of ice, because my refill was luke warm with no ice!
They raised their prices, which was a huge factor in why we chose that spot so often. 
The rolls didn't seem as fresh tonight as they usually are.  And 2 things we ordered off the menu, they ended up not having, so we couldn't get them- but we weren't told that for about 20-30min

1441346,2011-01-03,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Absolutely horrible! I did the AYCE and started off by ordering a hawaiin roll.. It had albacore on top.. the albacore was arleady pre sliced into sashimi and the sushi chef manicured the edges of the fish to make it look presentable, but the fish was obviously bad! I work in a high end sushi restauraunt and I know good from bad fish.. no fish should be presliced into sashimi. I didn't finish it. 
     Asked for a beef teriyaki, it was if they had a bag filled with beef, broccoli, and carrots and put it in a steamer.. the beef was so bad I couldn't even chew threw it so I just picked out the carrots and broccoli.. by this time I realized this place has an extremely low quality of food! So I decided to move onto dessert.. I asked the sushi chef for a tempura ice cream and he refused to serve me one untill I finished the sushi roll and the beef teriyaki.. I let him know I didn't really like either and he just shrugged his shoulders and said I would be charged for the fish and I would have an expensive bill.. 
     So I let him know that the beef teriyaki was very bad and it was as if he expected it and took it away.. I also told him the albacore was bad and showed how I was eating the rest of the roll but picking off the gross peices of redish shredded albacore..he said the fish was good and presliced to be prepared, even though none of the other fished was presliced into sashimi..so I told them to charge me for a la carte and he said he couldn't because I was getting smaller portions for AYCE.. even though I only ordered 2 things, I was disgusted by both.. they were treating me as if I didnt have money, and I was very insulted! I finally was allowed get a tempura ice cream when the rest of my party ordered dessert after 15 min of asking for it.. then they still charged me for the albacore I didn't eat, so the past 15 min I was being refused service for no appparant reason. This is the worst sushi and service I have ever had.. bar none!",kClSVk_yzQKfHgakVyqByg,3,0,1,0cfX6PLckcOVLiMMdp97Og

1588381,2015-05-07,4,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Sandwiched between a donut shop and a pizzeria is this nondescript-from-the-outside sushi spot, recently under new management and offering up a lot of bargains. 

PROS:
+ Half price special rolls from 3-5PM
+ Lunch price AYCE is $15 and goes until 4PM
+ Sit at the sushi bar and chat with the friendly staff
+ Creative rolls (including one with peanut butter!*) named after celebrities (such as the Salmon Hayek)
+ Dinner option includes a sashimi plate

CONS:
- Nigiri is cut uneven and ragged, not sure if this is due to knife skill or knife sharpness but they're not the thick, pretty cuts of fish I usually go for
- Rolls are super rice-heavy, you'll fill up fast... they also fall apart easily.
- Unclear whether half-rolls are available, was told I could get a half for my last one?
- Dessert mochi is literally a single mochi cut in half, kind of stingy. Not available for lunch.

Experience wasn't bad, I didn't have the poor service several other reviews mention. Unfortunately, I share Allen's opinion: I'm not going out of my way to return here, since there are better options closer to me.

*The Sticky Icky roll inclues peanut butter, shrimp tempura, coconut, and a few other ingredients and sounds absolutely revolting to me. Staff said it was more of a dessert roll and extremely rich, but when new management took over and removed it from the menu, people asked for it so much that they brought it back.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,5,3,3P_qS-AFSG7fi-dhUowiTQ

She came over took our drink order and returned to our table three times without drinks in hand. We ordered our food and the order was incorrect, we probably would have eaten it anyway but there were no plates or chopsticks on our table and our server paid no attention to us. We decided to just pay for what was served to us and go. Oddly our server asked us why we were leaving I had to laugh about it.

After a couple of minutes, a guy sitting at a table turned his head towards us and told us we could set wherever we wanted. We sat down next to his table and his friends.  We waited at least another 10 minutes before our waitress greeted us for drinks while we watched the table next to us having a good time pounding hot sake. We waited another 3-5 minutes for our drinks while the guy who told us to sit stood by a booth staring at us.  Turns out, he worked there along with another person sitting at the table, and while we waited they sat and got drunk with their friends.  Our sushi took forever, most of the employees were drinking alcohol on the job while making sushi, they were eating while making sushi and one of the chefs was observed putting the sauce bottles up to his nose to determine the type of sauce.  This all occurred while the employees' table had round after round of sake and several sushi rolls while we are still waiting for our first order almost 20 minutes after we ordered it. The music kept getting turned up so loud I couldn't hear the person next to me talking. By the time we were done, half of the employees were drunk, we hadn't even received all of the orders we placed and to top it off, the waitress added 18% auto gratuity to our check and there was nothing posted anywhere about auto gratuity.

1676052,2014-09-22,5,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"No...just no. Granted we came on a busy afternoon, and I will give credit where credit is due, overall there was just so much wrong with this place.

The positive: The sushi chef was busting his butt to quickly fulfill the orders. There was constant hand washing by the sushi chef in between orders. The price of $15 for lunch was very appealing.

The negative: The quality of sushi was among the lowest I have experienced. Not only was it mostly rice (explains the low price tag), but the rolls were so sloppy and kept falling apart. My soy sauce dish was completely filled with residual rice. Also, everything tasted mushy and the same with an overpowering amount of cream cheese. We sampled 5 rolls between us and honestly I can't say any of them stood out or would warrant coming back even if everything else wasn't wrong with this place. The salmon was fresh, the rest of the fish was not. The tuna was the mushy glob kind that they just throw on top of the roll..instead of you know, using actual tuna. It goes without saying that the crab was the fake krab kind.

The service was non existent. I asked for a water refill twice, and never received it. The waitress was busy, but how hard is it to send someone from the kitchen to walk around with a jug of water and just refill the tables.Or she could have done it herself... it would have taken 3 minutes tops.  As I was leaving, someone actually got up with their empty glass and approached the kitchen area because they had been waiting for a refill during the entirety of their visit. 

The best part was the auto gratuity added by ""accident""...$6 on a $30 order. When I looked at it and laughed she took it back and apologized for the ""mistake"". Right.... yes let me give you a 20% for doing absolutely nothing for me, not even refilling my water glass. So shady!

We tipped the sushi chef directly as he was busting his butt and actually serving us. I will not step foot in this place again.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,9,3,1,P_E7hP3hj7vpPJtN13SdDQ

My only draw backs were the age dashi tofu soup - too salty. I was almost scared to ask the ingredients because it was kind of just thrown together and tasted like it was doused in salt.

They also have some good sides and appetizers that come on the all you can eat menu as well. I will say the hamachi kama was over cooked, but the salmon collar was wonderful and a treat you don't always find. I would have given them 5 stars for having good food, good variety, and good prices for the category of restaurant they are (not gourmet but good weeknight stop), except that the place smelled, felt, and was... grungy.

Imperial

I keep going back in hopes that I don't get the manager making my sushi I order. If anyone other than the manager makes your order, you'll be fine and they do quite well and the sushi tastes pretty good, but if the shorty Asian manager makes your sushi, he will load you up on the rice and gives you less of the raw fish. I go for the flavor of fresh raw fish, NOT to load up on rice.  I even specifically pointed this out to the waitress because I could see that once again the manager was making my hand rolls, I asked, PLEASE ask the manager to go light on the rice, last time there was just too much rice and I didn't enjoy it. So the waitress told the manager and guess what, he put even more rice. The hand rolls were like ice cream cones and 3 times the size of a normal hand roll. The manager in this place is just plain rude, the music volume is turned up way too loud and the manager likes to sing. This wouldn't be bad if the music wasn't from the 80's and the manager actually could sing, American Idol contender he is not. I waited 15 minutes while the manager sat at the Sushi bar talking to a customer that didn't want to talk to him, singing and then proceeded to watch TV, all I wanted was a bowl of miso soup and that took 15 minutes.  The owner of the restaurant really should make a surprise visit to check up on his manager, who only seemed interested in providing free sushi to the donut shop next door to get free donuts in return. This place use to be good, but the manager is ruining it for all locals.  I'm tired of giving this place my money, there are 3 other Sushi places within 2 miles of this location, I will go to one of them next time, I believe they are only $2 more in price for AYCE but it's worth it to not have to deal with an arrogant, music too loud, can't sing, watches TV, too much rice, ignores customers, no good walk the dog business manager.",gjgOfC5f70ML3o4549gdTA,1,0,2,VLGheK6mzs1TqVCAcIVH8A

OVERALL: The service started at 3 stars and ended at 1. The food itself was generally a solid 2-3 stars, a couple items were excellent and there were a few that were very poor.

FOOD: I found the menu offerings to be excellent in theory but average in execution, presentation, and flavor. The sushi was not well cut. Most of the rolls were very heavy in rice which was sticky in texture, but not enough to keep the rolls from falling apart. Tuna Carpaccio Sashimi - 4 stars. Jessica Albacore Roll - 4 stars. The miso soup was 2 stars, flavor was okay but it was lukewarm and one of the bowls had no seaweed in it. Edamame - 1 star, it was covered in salt a 1/2 inch thick, to the point where it clustered together and I needed to wipe it off. We ordered some other rolls and sashimi but nothing else stood out; everything else was average.

SERVICE:
Our server was Janelle, and while she smiled often and was friendly, she was not able to regularly check in with the table. She came to the table 4 times in almost 3 hours. We ran out of drinks with no refill. To be fair to her, which didn't help us, there are only 2 servers for the entire dining room. We arrived shortly after 8:00pm. I ordered a chicken teriyaki Bento box for my daughter, AYCE deluxe sushi  dinner for myself, and AYCE sushi dinner for my husband. My cousins and their friend had arrived a little earlier and we were seated next to them. Our dinner started as 2 orders of shrimp tempura, 2 orders of Miso soup, a Jessica Albacore roll, an order of Edamame, a Vegas roll, Tuna Carpaccio, and a Philadelphia roll. My daughter's bento box came out at about 8:45, along with all our Sushi rolls. I had to ask again for the Miso soup and shrimp tempura. The Miso soup was brought out another 10 minutes later, and instead of clearing the empty sushi plates from the table, the waitress set the soup half onto one of the platters and half on the table, so it tilted and soaked everything in its' path. Either she didn't notice or didn't care because she didn't clean it up, and our place mats and napkins got soaked. I asked again for the shrimp tempura and she said, ""Let me check on that"".  
Another 15 minutes later, I randomly grabbed the other server who was walking by and asked for the shrimp tempura. I finally got it at about 9:30, an hour and a half later. 

The restaurant closed at 10, and we were ready to go. My cousins and I got our checks at the same time, right at closing. As soon as they were given to us, we handed them our debit cards and set cash on the tables for the tip. At about 10:20, there is only my family left, and (1) couple seated at the bar. As we were staring at the servers and sushi chef clustered around the POS looking confused, I finally got frustrated and said loudly, ""I don't know what's going on but I am getting frustrated!"" The male server came up to us and said, I'm so sorry, we are having system issues. We will get you guys out of here soon. Another half hour goes by, and we are now the only patrons left in the restaurant, and he informs my cousin she'll see 2 charges for dinner on her card, and will this be okay because they made a mistake and had to re-charge it. At this point, I am beyond irritated, and tell the server, ""the overall experience has been poor and this is not okay. We are being kept waiting for over an hour for you to figure out the register POS issues while the chef is releasing the kitchen workers and our waitress so as not to keep them on the clock. So his employees time is valuable enough that he doesn't want to pay them to stay any longer but our time isn't?! And I still haven't been given my card back."" I ask the male server what type of experience he thinks they are providing and he says, ""This is the service we are giving you right now"". (Insert expletives I was thinking here!)

In my opinion, bare minimum would have been to apologize and offer a 10% discount for keeping us sitting there for over an hour past closing, or to wipe the dinner debt clean for not getting their register system together but an hour and a half after we gave them our cards, we finally got to leave - with my cousin having 2 charges on her card...

We came here because my cousin previously had a decent experience, and has an obsession with all things Taylor Swift, including the sushi roll they have named after her.

Tokyo Sushi was the Birthday choice for my grandson. Starting with the single food server who was woefully inept at handling the entire floor by herself. 
Five waters and one green tea with no refills until the fourth request even though we could see full pitchers of water a short distance away. Orders taken for the AYCE sushi never arrived. Salmon Sushi was casually replaced because they were just out of salmon. Two of are party needed a fork, after 3 requests without resolution we went and asked for them at the bar area. Tables of guests were having the same frustration and cutting out early. Some of the AYCE sushi plates were brought to the table by our party otherwise they may have still been sitting there. 
A request was made to turn the TV from an episode of the Simpsons to a Sunday night NFL game to which we were told ""THIS AIN'T A SPORTS BAR'.
Adjustments were made to the final bill. A learning experience for all parties involved. The owner should be aware that his hired employees ran a regular party of six out the door never to return.",j04jvonfjNG7O1T8EMiLfw,4,2,1,a24kqF6L-qvQpUujjisXaA

The minute sat down all the things that I enjoy and love about AYCE at my normal go to spots Tokyo Sushi House was none of the above. I meet friend with my roommate for not only AYCE but all you can drink add on for extra charge. One positive the all you can drink because not many AYCE around town that offer all drinking too. The beer they had was on draft (not remember the beer) was decent not low low end for all you can drink. They only had one serve for the whole restaurant that night. I might be harsh on the service being slow. But the reality is when there was only two other tables of two in the whole place, some people at the bar but they were done, and saw two sushi chefs. It making ZERO sense that our orders was coming out so slow. The part that really got me perplexed was all the speciality rolls was coming out faster then my nigiri. Both my friends only order speciality rolls. They would order two different ones each and my nigiri no where to be found. Hell I ordered couple side dishes and they came out in less then five minutes. Made no sense. The nigiri generally comes out the fastest. I was shocked they had no hamachi or scallop on the nigiri list. One list that was so small it was sad. Sushi all about quality of the fish first and best way get that is nigiri. The quality I feel was barely ok. Nothing fresh about anything I had that night especially the nigiri list. Some of the speciality rolls was creative with the names, some of the presentations was nice, and if more specialty rolls your thing they do offer great variety of options. Not for me. The side dishes were ok. Service was slow slow slow. One round the sushi chef brought out round apologize for taking long time. We were the only table in the place makes no sense service that slow plus not like getting quality worth waiting for in my mind.

2296211,2012-02-05,2,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"WORST SUSHI PLACE I'VE EVER EATEN AT.

Please do not waste your time here. Theres way better places in Vegas that you can eat at. 

The waitresses first off had no personality. We would ask questions and she gave us a look like we were from a different planet. She understood english too so language was no a factor. When she finally did explain entrees, she spoke in circles and we were still left confused. 

Next, the prices are cheap but they have a very limited menu. Items that are not on the menu include moochie, or the screaming orgasm. Which in my opinion is one of the best dishes around. So, not only did we have to order the AYCE (which was 19.99 at 4pm) but then we had to order the moochie and the orgasm on the side. It ended up being 70 dollars for 2 people. Thats crazy! I would have rather eaten on the strip and had the excitement of drunk people or screaming tourists. 

What makes it even worse was that everything was flavorless. The sushi was okay, fresh but not top notch. The avocado inside wasn't ripe, that was the first thing I noticed. Next, when I ordered the shrimp tempera I found that the size was teeny tiny. I had to order multiple times since it only comes with two. I would expect 3 at least. Finally the next thing I was disappointed in was the green tea moochie. It tasted old and not as ""green tee-y"" as I like. The waitress messed up our order and then acted as if we never spoke to her. 

The only positives about this place was that the chocolate moochie was very fresh and tasty. The best dish I had was the creamy shrimp. It comes in two but i SWEAR it tasted like mexican flautas. All I needed was the sour cream. I had to order about 3 of them but i couldnt help myself. It was heaven. Lastly i ordered the fried cheesecake which was breath taking. Oh gosh, the ny cheesecake was delicious with the tempura batter on it. fan-freaking tastic. I sneaked and ordered another. I couldnt help myself. I know im bad, spank me. Don't worry, i worked it off later that night with our xbox kinect.

No problem if you're prepared and have some idea about what you like.
We ordered a couple bowls of Miso and Edamame to start. Both were nicely done and hot. Then the food orgy began. We ordered an Orange Roll, (tempura shrimp with panko garlic crumbs & salmon on top with a mild sauce. I give it a 7.5), A Dragon Roll, (California with unagi, Great, a 10), A hot firecracker roll, not sure about the name, was next; consisting of spicy Tuna with jalepenos on top, (call that one an 8). Then came the orders of Nigri Sushi; Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Tako, We ordered a few standard rolls as well. California, etc. All in all, we gorged ourselves in about 35 min. The freshness was a 10. Nothing tasted fishy or old. My 15 year old daughter & I put away a total of 6 rolls, & 11 orders of nigri, as well as the soup & edamame. The service was speedy, and other than running out of pickled ginger and wasabi twice, this place fills the bill for me. I'll be back to explore other rolls and creations.

At the time they were advertising some special on Facebook for $10 AYCE. We had been previously and enjoyed our meal with no issue. This time was a totally different experience. We went on a weekday.. there were several families in the restaurant including mine. The floors were filthy, they were sitting people at tables with disgusting floors. There was a toddler at another table in a high chair who's parents had poor control over their child. After the waiter left their table I kid you not he says to us, ""God I want to stab that kid in the face"" Seriously?!! You say that to another family who's also sitting with a child! The most unprofessional thing I've ever heard anyone say while they're at work. Thank god my kid wasn't acting up that day I wouldn't want anyone talking shit about her to another table!  So it comes time to pay and we're charged full price not the special price online.. my boyfriend gives me his wallet and he goes to put the baby in the car and when I question the waiter about the price him and another employee hover over me both rudely talking at the same time saying how the rules of the discount changed two days ago and because we didn't mention that we were doing the fb promo BEFORE we ordered that's what we need to pay. I couldn't get a word in. If it was a public ad online and they didn't hear us mention it when we sat down WHY wouldn't you bring it up to us?  I pay and leave. Later that evening my boyfriend calls to speak to a manager just to get the same rude attitude that we received earlier. This place is run by a bafoon that probably hired all of his buddies that couldn't get hired else where. Unprofessional, dirty, will con you for your money. Also on Facebook they advertise a menu of over 40 items, when you get there about half of them or more are sharpied out. Let me not forget about the quality of the food we could order was pretty average, nothing special... you could go to most sushi spots and pay $20 and get better AYCE. Anyway, I'll end with if that's how they care for their business and customers, I wonder how well they're taking care of things in the back and if everything is up to health code.",UQ7K_EX4id8Vy7deFuiomw,1,1,1,z2z5Ac60E7WZKJgDhT9AOw

Should  hire a sushi chef that specializes in that field.
No professional attire with the staff. Your sushi chef will make you sushi with his flannel on.
Waited 33 minutes for my first order of sushi to come out. Not worth the holiday discount. At all!

The fresh water eel was dry and the salmon nigiri was paper thin with tons of rice so it just tasted like I was eating rice. Besides that, everything else was tasty. My favorite is the vegas playboy roll and bomb.com. The service was very fast and our server Billy was very helpful and attentive. One warning though, DON'T GET THE STICKY ICKY ROLL. It's a shrimp tempura roll with peanut butter and coconut flakes and our group of 4, who all like peanut butter, all thought it was terrible. The combination of peanut butter and rice is so off putting. 

On another note, they are doing a promotion of $14.99 lunch AYCE till the new years but it doesn't stack with the restaurant,com gift certificate so keep that in mind. One other thing to keep in mind is that there is only 1 server and 2 sushi chef at all times. So service and food will be extremely slow if the restaurant is packed. About 6 months ago, I once ended up waiting over an hour just for 2 dishes to come out and my party was so pissed off that we left while still hungry because we just wanted to get out of there.

I enjoyed 4 rolls on this visit which include: Kiss of Fire, Fire Dragon, Spicy Yellowtail and a Spicy Salmon.  I recommend the specialty rolls, especially if you like your sushi spicy.

The fish was fresh and the flavors were excellent.  The Miso Soup was also very good.  You may say ""well how can you screw up Miso Soup?"" Trust me when I say that Sushi places do it all the time.

So, the server and chef tried their best to serve 3 tables. 

I heard the first family complained about the wait. Come on, maybe you should placed 2-3 items per person when you ordered and then placed more order when you were eating your last item like we did so there was no wait time, your food will keep coming.

All items we ordered were good, except unagi roll; they put tons of cucumber and very little eel so when we took a bite all we can taste was cucumber.

3758433,2015-08-28,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"First time to this restaurant and it was pretty good.  The moment I walked in, I was directed by the cook behind the counter to seat myself.  Since I was dining alone and the bar was full, I sat myself in a booth.  After about 5 min I was greeted by my server Thomas and he took my drink order.  I ordered a Coke but received a Dr. Pepper with a straw shorter than the glass.  After letting the server know, he promptly fixed it and returned with the right drink.

I decided to do their all you can eat sushi dinner and ordered 3 types of sushi:  The Salmon Lover, The Volcano, and the Rainbow Roll.  The Rainbow Roll was the first to arrive and it was an eight piece sushi dish.  Right when the dish was dropped off, I had to ask for the wasabi, the bowl for dipping, and the ginger.  He apologized and brought it right away.  In his defence, he was the only server on the floor (it's a small place) and it was almost full.  That being said, I understood because I too am in the industry so I acknowledge these types of things. 

The Rainbow Roll was my favourite.  The Salmon Lover was spicer than I expected but very delicious!  No wasabi needed for this dish.  Last to arrive was The Volcano.  This was a baked sushi dish (ok, that's new, but I'll try it).  I took two bites and said no thank you.  Just wasn't impressed with it.  Perhaps I was getting full, or the fact that I never had mushrooms on my sushi before.  Kind of throws the taste off a bit.  Last to arrive was my dessert of strawberry Mochi.  This was exactly how Mochi should taste!  Strong strawberry flavour, icy, and delicious.  I recommend trying it toasted.  Gives it a campfire marshmallow edge.  Not too bad!

Overall, my first experience was pretty good.  Thomas came back multiple times to check on me, offered me refills, and removed plates as necessary.  I felt bad for wasting the rest of The Volcano dish, but I wasn't sure what to expect with it.  

I will definitely come back in the future for more of that delicious Rainbow Roll...and try some new things too.  It also helps that this place is located 5 min from my house, which is a nice plus!  My four star review is specifically toward the food and not the service.  The 5 min greet time gave me a chance to thoroughly read the menu and make a choice.",D_uUJZCSVSvV-TTCQbeCQg,0,0,4,zUkeFIe8Vo2ipCY7vM_UxA

3812824,2012-06-09,2,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Great, fast service, which far surpassed Krazy Sushi's rather ""don't care if you're here, don't care if you leave"" attitude.  I quite like the fact ti's simply AYCE, which avoids the pages of rules posted everywhere as well.

PROS:  Fast service.  Not well known so not crowded.  $14.99 lunch, $19.99 dinner, $2 drinks.  They have green tea ice cream.  The waitress was very helpful in assisting one of our friends who has food allergies.

CONS:  Not a huge selection, and if you're a fan of crunch or yumyum sauce, or baked rolls, you're down to two or three choices only. They charge for mochi (FYI, you can buy an 8 pack for $3 at International grocery stores) separately.

I had the garlic tuna (fresh, very garlic-y), the Mortal Combat, and the Rock Your Body (a delightful mixture of sweet chili, an almost rice vinegar taste, and hot...it was unexpectedly good).  My friend had the Tiger (she was not fond of the nearly pureed spicy tuna on top's texture), and the teriyaki roll (it's a roll, but then they put full on teriyaki on top--as in they put the roll down, and then scoop chicken with cashews, carrots, and broccoli atop the roll....a bit odd but they liked it so much they had two).  

The rice was still hot on the first rolls giving them a bit of an odd sensation (never had warm sushi before) but it wasn't objectionable.

3862828,2014-11-30,2,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I'm not going to give out a full five star because of recent changes, but I still have to give a good rating because the service was still good and I have to give credit where credit is due.

First of, although the price stayed the same, T. Sushi House has made some pretty big changes. One of these is separating a Lunch, Dinner and Deluxe price. Now I understand why they did it, because price of food is getting higher and they have to adjust their prices to that. Lunch is still $14.95 and and dinner is still the same, but it's very limited now and if you want everything (like in the past), you'd have to pay the deluxe price. 

Second, the menu changed completely! Gone are my favorite rolls such as the Jenny, the Mortal Kombat, the Vegas and the Maui rolls and in comes the more regular rolls such as the dragon, the rainbow, the caterpillar and the lasagnas. I mean those rolls were there previously. However from a menu that consisted of at least 30 different rolls on just one side, there's only like 12 now. I was pretty disappointed with that. The big selection is the reason that we love going there. If they were to raise the prices and keep the same menus, there would have been no problem! Also, the appetizers were also lessened and they decided to keep some of the not so favorable ones (for us anyways)

Third, our favorite waitress no longer works there I think. The waitress there now is pretty nice, don't get me wrong, but the waitress before was just the ""ish"". She knew the moment we went in what we wanted and started on it right away.

Fourth, there's some changes with the sushi chef line up. The ones currently working now are decent, but it just does not taste the same. 

On the pro side, the service is still pretty good from the waiter and waitress. They're fast and efficient and they come to check on you every so often, which a lot of people might not like, but we do. They cater to everything you need and they're also one of the nicest. The rolls come out in a timely manner. However, my family and I are probably going to go to Naka for our sushi fix from now on since the menu doesn't agree with our taste pallet!",fo7KIcXhZf1FA-yiI8TesQ,3,1,3,ZFyznBoi65XC2z6-Yqo9WQ

The spring rolls and potstickers were overcooked and they put sauce and the top so the crunchy got soggy.

I asked for the items on the pictures because it didn't have a description, she remembered only a few. At least she was honest to tell me she didn't know what it was but she should've asked the sushi chef. She critiqued everything after I had ordered. Because of her rambling and nonsense talking to the sushi chef about customers, she forgot their items when she got back to their table. I overheard everything behind us. I heard her say sorry several times to the table behind us and blamed it on ""one of those days"".  The people behind us left and she went to continue her  rambling of customers to the sushi chef. He wasn't so positive either and went along with her(waitress). She came back to our table and asked what we wanted next, forgetting the fact that we had already ordered. This went on several times during her shift and it wasn't even busy. She just would not stop talking to the sushi chef. The items on the menu was mediocre and nothing great.

I came here a week ago because a fellow Yelper shared the December special-- AYCE sushi for $10 at lunch and $15 at dinner. What!? I had to try it. My office is about 15 minutes away so I decided to take a longer lunch to account for drive time and it took very little convincing for my best friend to join me. We met there at 12:10 PM. By 12:50, I had only received one of three rolls I ordered. I cancelled the second roll when I realized that I wouldn't have time to eat it and had them box up the third roll when it was finished. My bestie was lucky to get two rolls by 12:50 and then a third made quickly for us when we told our server we had to go soon. We left at 1:10 PM, definitely disappointed. The guys working there are nice, they are just overwhelmed. Though there were only four other tables dining with us, it was too much for only one sushi chef to handle. They need more staff for lunchtime.

BUT we thought the sushi was delicious. We especially enjoyed the Firecracker Roll which is large and tasty and the Blackjack Roll which had great flavors that paired well together. We also enjoyed the Mexican Roll which has a nice, not-too-spicy flavor, and a crunchy jalapeno slice on top. Yes, the rolls are heavy on rice but I don't really mind that when the flavor is on point and the fish tastes fresh. So I decided to come back once more last Sunday with my brother and his girlfriend. We came around 3 PM and to our dismay, there was only one sushi chef and one server again. Wait times were as long as my first visit. Though we could eat more, we ended up asking for the check early because a large party had been seated and we didn't want to wait another hour for food. However, we loved the sushi once again. The standout this time was the Tiger Roll.

TL;DR
I recommend this place if you're coming for the special and you have time to spare. It's definitely worth the wait for good AYCE sushi that's only $10. Though I was disappointed twice by the slow service, I definitely got my money's worth and enjoyed the food.",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,7,5,3,1tSZ_F62F2PVblBuSJTsnw

Pros: 
 Rolls are okay at best
 I didn't get sick.
Cheap

CONS:

 Place is packed and you have one server and one chef.  This is a management issue.  They are setting up the staff to fail. 
Staff is not professional.  The chef is okay.  He is a champ really.  Now the server looks like a tweeker I'm sorry to say.  He also kind of freaks out on himself.  It's not a comfortable experience.  
 Place is sticky and dirty.  Bathrooms are a mess. Not what you want your spot to look like when  eating  uncooked food.
 The menu is incredibly limited no sides, no sushi only a few  rolls with lots of rice, crab mixture, tempura shrimp and spicy tuna pretty much.  I ordered a rainbow roll and there was just a smear of fish on top same thing with avocado. 
 being that there's only a few people that service is incredibly slow.  I was limited to how many roles I could order for my daughters and I at a time, and some of them were even forgotten until at this point we needed to go.   In one hour and a half that got us two roles each and I eat sushi up very fast. 

Again I think the sushi chef is the brightest part of that place.  He is just incredibly limited by management or lack thereof to be honest.  If money is too little to  hire the correct amount of staff then start raising your prices again, we have been here many times and every single time it gets worse I no longer will be coming back I'd rather go to Smith's and just get sushi from that place.",t-fNUJTl8hz8Zd524GiXCg,2,1,2,Oo26lxbtqXo1_NpdH63QCQ

4612255,2013-01-11,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Tokyo Sushi House is a decent, solid all-you-can-eat sushi place. It stands out for its creative, interesting rolls and competitive pricing - at $15 for lunch - so if you're more into modern-style sushi and/or a bargain sushi session, this is the place to go. The appetizer entrees are pretty good too. Everything else about the place is just about standard (or a bit less), but put it in perspective of the great AYCE value. 

Highlights were the unagi nigiri, and the Dragon and Volcano rolls. The rolls are creative and well-made, without excesses of sauce and seasoning; you can order half-rolls too, which let us try a lot of the menu! Definitely a good place for rolls. 

The unagi is particularly good if you prefer the sauce a little less sweet. Besides the unagi and hamachi, the rest of the nigiri was disappointing; the fish was so-so, and the rice was cloyingly dense. I prefer nigiri over rolls so that was unfortunate; if you require a variety of good nigiri, you may be disappointed, but it's also a matter of preference here, or maybe a bad day/selection.

The service was a bit lackluster, though sufficient. The waitress was spotty considering we were the only party for majority of our stay, and kept making awkward placements with the dishes. The chefs were better - attentive, and skilled, though difficult to engage with any depth. As a whole, staff interactions were pretty awkward, and I'm hesitant to visit on the same shift to have to go through that again. 

I will be back, though, to give the place a second chance on the misses, and to try more of the great, unique rolls on such a good bargain.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,1,0,3,DDYr1bZKOZ3pVyzuieo1dw

4659400,2015-07-19,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I will never come back. Not because of the mediocre food and service, but because of the dishonesty. Also, everything is mushy.

I only decided to try Tokyo Sushi House because I got a 50% off coupon on a supermarket receipt. They were very sorry they had arbitrarily stopped accepting these coupons a couple weeks ago, but they had nothing else to offer than claiming they were victims of big bad supermarkets not stopping the coupon being printed. Expiration date is 2 months from now. Dessert to go? 10% off as a courtesy? Nothing. Ironic that a Japanese restaurant would have issues with honoring their promises.

The food was marginal. Solid C- to C across the board. The fish was okay, mostly on the bland side though. I've had better at most AYCE places I've been to, but it was better than the sushi offerings at Smith's. The Hawaiian roll was bland and mushy, but okay. The Vegas whatever roll was also bland and mushy, but okay. The sweet potatoes in the tempura vegetables were awesome, but the other veggies ranged from overcooked and mushy to having soggy crust from either too much moisture in the vegetable or too low a frying temperature. The eel sauce was imbalanced toward vinegar, and the tempura sauce was lacking in any sort of flavor. The rice in everything fell apart. This was especially true for the nigiri, which I guess is a good thing because it meant I could just have sashimi. Thankfully they didn't argue with the crumbled piles of rice that went back on those plates. The rolls barely held together. Other reviews have mentioned the wonder of what are now called ""legacy rolls""...but the legacy rolls seemed more like a vehicle for getting rid of a too large cream cheese delivery, so I didn't order any.

The rock shrimp aioli was quite good. I tried my friend's. The texture was way different than I was expecting, but it was pleasantly reminiscent of dim sum (a little context goes a long way). Also quite good was the green tea ice cream. I've nearly gotten used to green tea ice cream that's more like frozen egg nog with green food dye. But this had a strong flavor and that slight bitterness that sweetened matcha has, and apart from a few icy bits was some of the better green tea ice cream i've had.

Service was worth a 15% tip. When asked if we wanted wasabi and ginger, my friend said yes, and i asked to have wasabi with no ginger. A small plate with both came out, and nothing else. It seemed to be shocking that I wanted my own wasabi with no ginger, despite asking for it. Very large water glasses meant I didn't have to ask for a refill, and it tasted neutral. I asked for lemon for my water, and despite there being a lemon floating at the bottom of the rock shrimp aioli that came from the same round of ordering, I never got a lemon wedge for my water. Other than that, service was just fine: friendly, attentive, but not cloying...about what you would expect here in town. 

I feel like the positive reviews have to be shills, people who have never had good sushi and really like cream cheese and sugar sauce, or have no teeth.

4765960,2016-07-25,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Finally decided to re download the Yelp app (my phone needs the space for photos and videos haha) so I can make a specific review for this restaurant. 

I always love giving new chances to restaurants. I was a huge patron of the original establishment back in 2012 (this restaurant not the Craig one), I loved it at the time. But slowly it began getting worse. By 2013 I switched completely. I reluctantly call myself a sushi addict, so I go have sushi at a minimum of once a week. 

Last time I was here was about 10+ months ago. Basically few things have changed, and somehow, the only change that's been going on is it keeps getting worse. 

I've had the unfortunate opportunity to try out both places (hoping one would be better than the other, no luck). 

At the moment, I'm writing this review from my bathroom. A little more than 7 hours ago we are here, and I've been stuck going in and out of the restroom due to food poisoning from this restaurant (when I go out to eat sushi, I don't eat for the whole day, so this is the only explanation. PS I don't eat the whole day, so I get my money's worth come dinnertime.). This place charges $27 yet does not offer the typical dinner favorites that other AYCE sushi restaurants offer, sea urchin, sweet shrimp, salmon eggs, etc. I finally came around to downloading the Yelp app again (I need the space, 16gb iPhone struggle), considering the food poisoning. 

Like its other restaurant, the rice is either crunchy or undercooked, when you get the opportunity for that perfectly steamed Nigiri rice or sushi rice, it's a rare and exciting moment. Like their other restaurant, the sushi ""chefs"" are young, inexperienced, and often side tracked by using their phones or talking with their buddies in the back kitchen. This place did better than the other, it took about 20 mins for me to receive a roll (the other place it took 30 mins for me to receive a spicy tuna roll, and my date a rainbow roll). When I received the Super White tuna, it seemed like it had been sitting out to thaw from its previous frozen state. The slices were not at all cut properly, one piece would be a sliver of fish, while another piece would be a two biter. There are two trending issues, employees who don't care (aka sushi chefs who, I feel, are doing their job just to pay bills instead of for the love of cooking; coming from a previous Le Cordon Bleu student who loves the art of cooking) and understaffed restaurants. This place was not busy, much like it's other restaurant on Craig. Somehow, even though it was half empty, dinner here lasted for more than 2 hours (while at any other one of its competitors it would last about an hour for the same exact orders; Im a plain person, I get the same thing everywhere I go so it's easy to compare lol).  2 hours for a sushi dinner would be reserved for a gourmet restaurant like Nobu, NOT AYCE, and especially NOT Tokyo Sushi! 

Do yourself a favor and go to any other AYCE restaurants , just not this place (or it's Craig location, or any other future location it may have)! 

In case you got lost in my little rant, here's an easy overview:


The Good:

-Some great lemonade (although other restaurants have the same amazing lemonade)
-Nice decorations 
-Yummy SOUNDING rolls 

The Bad:
-Slow Service/inattentive chefs 
-Undercooked/crunchy rice 
-Kitchen workers who are allowed to join the sushi chefs (essentially, they learn how to make sushi and you're the ""lucky"" one who has to eat it, OR be charged for the roll) 
-Higher possibility of food poisoning (at the other location my date got food poisoning, and at this location I got food poisoning. There's always a risk when eating sushi, but the odds of us both getting sick? No so likely unless it's bad quality/sits out for too long)  
-Like the other restaurant, people wearing gloves while touching your food is a rare sight to see (strange considering it's an SNHD healthcode violation NOT to wear gloves)",FoCkGAce6Hjy3mpfUSq-_w,0,0,1,R2OXAp7xKyWETXB5VTN7dA

Rolls were ok. Fish was not up to par. Looked as though they used long grain rice. 

During my entire visit, I received only one drink refill. The ice cubes in my iced green tea had little green particles frozen into them. My boyfriend tried to convince me that it was green tea mix. It looked like algae to me.

First, price is unbeatable. I never seen $19.99 for dinner at AYCE. Most restaurants charge between $24.99 to $26.99. So I always tip them like $6 that only makes full price at other AYCE restaurant.
Their quality of sushi isn't different from other AYCE sushi restaurants. The rolls are beautiful (especially Cherry Blossom) and so delicious. I love Mortal combat, Lasagna, Kiss of Fire and Volcano.
The service is also great. Strangely I only go there on busy nights. Servers keep running to follow up the orders. They always check back how my table is doing, apoligize for delay if any, and thank us.

They could barely eat the sushi and complained while eating it that it was really bad. My salmon teriyaki had the smallest portions of rice and the salad was gross. I could barely eat it because it was so soggy and wilted. 

We won't be going back there and I suggest you don't bother trying it! We had to beg for some extra soy sauce and they only got a little smidge of wasabi. They are tight on portions and extras.

It is so sad because this is near my friends house and we wanted so badly for it to be good because it is so convenient! Perhaps it was an off night, but I won't eat there again.

5201826,2011-02-23,2,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I'm in shock at the reviews I just read on this place.

I was invited to lunch yesterday and my friend had to cancel, so I went without him to the place on Cheyenne that I thought he was talking about near the 95. Turned out to have an awful experience there, which could contribute to how much I loved my lunch today. This one is on Cheyenne but it's by the 215 far from the 95. 

I'll give you this: my friend is a regular here and he knows the waitress who was so so very nice to us and accommodating. She brought him a roll and forgot to put no-cucumber for my buddy, she was willing to take it back, but it looked good so I just ate it while they made him another one without the cucumber.

The place was clean, the orders came super fast and My God Man $15??? How can you go wrong. It's the wrong end of town for me, but I'll drive back there again. The most important things about sushi for me are fish quality and cleanliness is a close second. Straight A's on both from me. The variety rocks as well. Preparation, presentation, etc... okay it's not Nobu I'll give you that, but it's also not $250 each to eat there. Taste wise it's on par with Kaizen where my bill is easily $50 per person.

Strangely enough the ala-carte that I had the day before cost me as much as the AYCE here. That place charges $28 for their AYCE and I wouldn't eat there again if they paid me.

So strange how we can have such different experiences at the same places. For what it's worth, you can't beat this place. Enjoy it while you can, after enough people find it, that price is going to have to go up. You can't buy that crap at the grocery store for less than $8 a roll now.

Pfff, now that I've talked about it I want to go back now, but I'm still full.",UOM7K9g2aFUgi30H_oebPg,3,3,5,v0J3UipEOOGTfUdgvbLdrw

No sauce, wrong sauce, no garnish, rolls made poorly, cuts uneven, tempura batter way too thick, and rice was poorly seasoned.

I had avoided them for quite some time due to their yelp rating until a co-worker told me otherwise.  Their fish is fresh and service is fast & friendly, which is the absolute most important criteria for evaluating a ayce sushi joint.  And then the next most important attribute is price.  They offer $15 lunch and $20 dinner, both ayce.  Seriously??  I don't know how they do it because all of the competition that dips into that price range doesn't even come close to the same level of freshness.  

They have a nice variety of rolls, but sashimi is not included in ayce.  The variety helps because my man is allergic to shellfish/shrimp and some places offer up to 85% of their rolls with shrimp as the main ingredient.  An added bonus is their iced green tea, which is fricking amazeballs, but it's an extra $3 that's not included in the meal price.  

The sushi chefs are super friendly and johnny on the spot to whip up any custom creation that strikes your fancy.

The old place would've been a -3 stars!

It's under new management now, so I decided to give this place another chance especially since lunch on Monday through Thursday is $14.99! Fish quality was definitely way better than the previous visit. I tried their garlic salmon & was blown away at how delicious it was! The fish melted in my mouth (which is a really good indicator for me). What I do have to complain about is how much rice there is on the nigiri. You don't need a shit load of rice on it, guys... So that was the only thing that caught me off guard.

The rolls are delicious! You MUST try Scallop Johansson Roll especially if you're a big fan of eel sauce, haha! The rice on the rolls were actually really sticky too. You want your rice to be sticky, but not toooooooo sticky - which were the case here. But other than that, it was definitely YUMMY compared to last time!

Now the bad part, even with the rolls being smaller than most sushi restaurants I've been to, it took forever to get our orders. We would get one roll served to us and have to wait 15-20 min for another roll. Our last order took 30 min for two rolls to be served! Unacceptable.

We also ordered calamari tempura which took about 30 minutes, that was ridiculous, wouldn't call it calamari since there was barely a coat of tempura batter on it. came out all salty but the sauce helped us eat it. Then waited another 15 for only 1 roll. Still waiting on that nigiri we ordered. The rice was kinda dry and hard. Once we got the nigiri the rice was already falling apart. The fish was okay...for the price I expected better. In total we ordered 6 rolls and it took almost 1hr an 45 minutes. My boyfriend and I were getting irritated. We weren't the only table waiting for a while. And they were here before us. Not once did the waitress said sorry or anything. I know how hard it is but still. Food was alright. I could of gotten something better for the same price with better service else where. We weren't given a goodbye and come see us again. So I guess we're not coming back again.",5qQ_p-UbtsK9pCZe_khiag,0,0,1,JDwXqY0t72Coah7aj9wz6g

We enjoyed a valentines dinner with my three children and mother.. The staff was friendly, accurate and knowledgeable about their menu.

The food was better than expected and far better than our ""normal"" sushi spot.

Their music selection was unique and provided a inviting feel for hip-hop listeners!!",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,1,1,5,aQuWvDpAVfVoefhWxeA4mg

Took us a while to get his attention for simple things like water refills. The best thing about this place is the price; $14.99 for lunch AYCE, $19.99 for dinner. The menu is barely limited at all if you do AYCE - only one item isn't on either, and only 5 or 6 are only on dinner. Overall, not my best sushi experience.",ZAPXDJUy2qZiZc_at1jU7w,1,0,3,oT01Ukj31jHyHTAviHUU1A

Very friendly waitress who  happened to be the only one attending everyone. Ordered our drinks and ordered off the AYCE menu. Their menu is very small compared to the other locations I've been too. I can honestly say it was a hit or miss with the sushi we ordered. Not to mention we had to wait for our orders constantly. Some of the rolls did not look appealing or they literally fell apart. Needless to say it didn't look fresh. Although they were very courteous, they weren't on top of customer service or attentiveness. I am willing to give this location a second try, possibly and hoping they can change my mind next time.",BM4DjBb7G9jOCGNcTXTTSQ,0,0,2,Hhy5xQo1hXt-hg-rdUtXYw

5876915,2012-04-09,1,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I dont like to hit these guys with a one since Its been three hours and Im not ill like my last 1 rating but after asking for feedback it was agreed that was what they earned tonight. Here is why:

Im not a Sushi expert by any means but I do enjoy eating it and learning about new Sushi dishes. So when the GF and her daughter suggested it I agreed so we came here.

Upon sitting down we were greeted right away by the whole staff but that is where things went horribly wrong.

The server brought out our chop sticks and mixing bowls and we found a hair and some rice stuck to one dish.  I would normally walk out here but this is their favorite place so we stuck around. (No discount was offered for this but a very fast sorry about that was received)

We tried about 10 dishes and we were all disappointed that the rolls were all rice and filler with just the smallest hints of seafood. The fish wasn't the freshest but the flavor was good. 

There was three people in our group and two other tables with one server and two chef's We each ordered a roll and they all came out separately. Since it was all you can eat and family style I can appreciate that but when the other two tables were being served new dishes before ours came out it seemed liked a very disorganized restaurant 

When a set of rolls came out prepared different than how it was listed they explained it was a new chef and they would make us a new roll. Not wanting to waste anything we said thats ok.(this was another pluss for them)

Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the toilet in the mens bathroom. If you remember the Ferguson from the TV show ""married with children"" this is without a doubt based on that; for the business those toilets must see they must have some serious power just remember to stand before you flush or you may get sucked in. Its a serious vaawhooosh!!! And Al Bundy would be proud.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,0,1,dXpKEgRm6XnptfUcv5hfIQ
5922223,2015-11-24,3,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"I've been here a few times, so this 3.5 gets rounded up. This is a nice little sushi place up on Cheyenne and 215 so it can be a bit of a drive if you're not in the area, but it's worth it. The decor is fairly plain, but it's always spotless. This is one of the bars where I say sitting at the bar is worth it because the chefs actually interact and joke with you, unlike some places in town. They give suggestions and actually help you have a well rounded experience and make it more fun. The fish to rice ratio more than fair. The fish isn't top of the line but it's about on par with most AYCE. The price is also good, being under 20 for lunch and they even had a special where it was $15 for a little bit. 
The only complaint I really hold against this place is that the service is slow. Like it takes forever to get anything, from rolls to drinks. I thought maybe it was just a busy thing but I've been there when it was super dead and nothing changed, so there's that. It's definitely a place I'll be returning to :)",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,4,2,4,HgEkyHScLZXc6NK6vOTk3w

5939221,2012-05-15,5,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Like I suspected, the low ratings of this place was due to how typical and bitter the locals in this particular area are. 

I refer to this area of NW Vegas as the ""Cheyenne Strip"".  The ""Cheyenne Strip"" starts at the intersection of Cheyenne and Durango, and ends at the 215. The yelpers who live in this area are the harshest in the world.  If they liked a restaurant-the food was good,-but it wasn't their favorite, they will go ahead and give the restaurant a 1-star. If they really liked the restaurant and it's their top 10 favorite restaurant in Vegas, they will give it about 2 stars. They have no real structure on giving out 5-star ratings and will just randomly give out a rare 5-star if they are in a really good mood. That's why when you click on their yelp profiles, they have like 20-30 1-star ratings and like one or three 5-Star ratings. Also, check the reviews for every business located on the ""Cheyenne Strip"". Every business on this part of Cheyenne has an average of a 2 star overall rating. Are these ratings justified? Absolutely not! The residents in this area are those certain types of customers that are very difficult and impossible to satisfy. 

The Sushi here is not bad at all. And the prices are the best in town. Where else in Las Vegas can you get a $15.00 AYCE sushi deal? For some reason, TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE reminded me of one of these places but without the conveyer belt.  

There are two Sushi houses in this area. The first being ""Sushi Bomb"" and the 2nd being TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE. A lot of people in the NW area compare this place to ""Sushi bomb"" and I think that's why many reviews are too critical. I actually decided to come here because ""Sushi Bomb"" gets extremely crowded during dinner hours, and like a lot of yelpers complain about, the wait time to get seated over there gets extremely long some nights. Sure, this place isn't a popular hangout for young people and pro-poker players like ""Sushi Bomb"" is, but at least it's half the price, you get seated immediately, and you get good tasting fish. Today, I was not in the mood for maki and wanted some good nigri. TSH, has a perfect selection of all nigri. They got everything from Albacore to Unagi, and the sushi chef sends it out fast. Also, the fish here at TSH is good-fresh seafood. There is nothing wrong with it like many NW yelpers claim. Many people try to compare the freshness to ""Sushi Bomb"" who actually kills some of  the fish the same day they serve it, but that's why that place is over $30.00 per person, and this place is only $15.00.  

If you follow my reviews, you already know that I am very critical of how uncultured  people are who live in NW Las Vegas. Before I came here, I already knew that a lot of the bad reviews about ""rude service"" was just their cultural ignorance. The servers here don't have much English, and have difficulties understanding someone who is speaking really fast. So, she is not ""stupid"" or ""being rude"" if she gives you an incorrect answer to your question. BTW, the service to me was very good. There was never a moment that lasted more than a minute where my drink wasn't being refilled. 

I guess another plus about this place is that the Sushi Chef is very quiet and traditional. If you have mature older family members or young children, this place might be the best choice. At ""Sushi bomb"", some of the chefs are young and quite popular with the ladies, so you might hear him bragging about how he banged some chick the other night. In conclusion, TOKYO is definitely has a better atmosphere for families with young children.

Most of the Sushi houses on the West Coast were originally established by Japanese nationals(not Japanese-Americans), and quickly sold to Korean-Americans. I don't understand why they always do this? Is this some kind of common investment by business men in Japan? I tried asking my Dad, my lawyer, and one of my best friends who are all Japanese-American, but because they were all born in Hawaii, they had no clue about why investors in Japan do this. Anyone know?

So practically, I would say this is a good 4-star establishment, but I will give it 5-stars just to compensate for all the unjust 1-star ratings",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,14,5,5,SuJbq0qjYppoUjYH1utETQ
5963110,2016-08-06,0,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,"Very disappointed by our experience. We come here often, but the past 3-4 times we've been here it's slowly gone down hill. In the past they had a $15 AYCE, then they bumped it to $17, now it's $20 per person. Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to pay for sushi if it's worth it but this my friends is not worth it. We sat down and ordered our drinks, and quickly placed out sushi order (we've been here so many times that we have a go to list of what we like to order). The sushi overall took a VERY long time to get to our table. When our rolls finally did come out we weren't even given plates, soy sauce dishes or chopsticks- the sushi chef dropped off the rolls and walked away without a word. The rolls themselves were very disappointing. The rice was tough, not cooked enough. The rolls were cut very unevenly, I know what you're thinking- it's the taste that matters most but it was just a mess of a plate, 1/4 inch pieces, 1 inch pieces, 1 1/2 pieces. I watched one of the cooks as he refilled the crab meat for rolls with his bare hands, scooping and touching all the crab. I saw the sushi chefs with their sushi making gloves on touching the phone, the order sheets, cash register then go back to making sushi.... Why not just drop my piece of salmon in the floor why don't ya. There was one waitress, who was nice, but was maybe having an off day?? She was very slow, we had to track her down anytime we needed anything: more water, more rolls etc. The other tables went untouched after someone left, the dirty dishes just sitting there. We saw a group of people come in, sit down, wait to order drinks, order drinks, wait, wait, waited some more, and just left. This place has gone down hill.
