We ordered two chicken bowls and an order of potstickers to share.

The potstickers looked like deep fried testes. We asked them to redo them when they initially served us these shriveled little balls that had melted wax paper stuck to them because they put them in the bag when it was covered in hot grease. They brought them back raw, but dripping in grease. I actually said to the girl behind the counter, ""You've got to be kidding me.""

The rice was mushy, the teriyaki sauce was ICE cold, the chicken was dry, and the mixed vegetables were just a bunch of greasy bok choy and limp carrots.

Japanese make teriyaki usually with shaved beef or chicken pieces. and a light sauce. Usually from soy sauce, sugar, and sake...usually a thin sauce
Hawaiians: grill meat so it's got the charring and add a sweet sauce with a base of shoyu and brown sugar, pineapple juice/honey so it's sweeter.
Samarai Sam's: What the hell is a teriyaki wrap with rice? Doesn't it defeat the purpose of Atkins? Is this fusion? It's basically cheap, fast faux teriyaki bowls. For what it is....it's the McDonald's of Teriyaki. Is it good? Eh It's boring....",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,3,3,1,7pn15NRIytAN9Wh3H2NM-g
