I been searching for some good tacos near my place and found it. I've eaten here 2 times on 5 attempts. This was due to the place closing before the posted closing time. The last two times I went by around 7:45 PM, and they were closed. Posted closing time, 9:00 PM. This is the only reason I've gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating. Back to the food. 

The food is excellent. I've only eaten the carnitas tacos with rice and beans. The 1st time I ate here it was awesome. The 2nd time I ordered to go and they were still awesome. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th... you know what happened. The tacos are a nice size, plenty of carnitas, with pico, cheese, and beans. 

The service was prompt and friendly both times. 

I still want to try more food from this place and will stop by earlier next time. I would recommend this place to anyone before 7:30 PM.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,0,1,4,5aIEyolTrKm5s49PYqwHyw

The place is very clean and it was a good experience. 
If you are around and are hungry stop by. 
You won't be disappointed.",l6oqUEFr4yw2jYrRiVNAzg,2,0,5,5R9AK9D8ahIvtJdfOeE_Jg

I was so happy when my roommate and I stumbled into this place when we were looking for a place that was in the same plaza, but was closed.  This ended up being a great find!  La Takiza isn't the cheapest, but it's certainly the best.  I usually order the daily special, which is two tacos of their choice with beans and rice for around 6 bucks.  My favorite of their tacos is their Al Pastor, but their Chorizo are also very good.  The Al Pastor is perfectly seasoned, and is served with a little bit of pineapple salsa which really accents the spiciness of the pork.  The tortillas are always warm and soft, yet hard enough to hold your taco.  I have tried almost everything at La Takiza and have been very pleased with everything, but I would suggest getting the Super Taco with al pastor!  
If you love tacos and live in Vegas, do not be alarmed by La Takiza's random location, go there!",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,5,2,5,JiRbeC1trwaVLUaJlKRrwg
