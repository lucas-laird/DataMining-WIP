667705,2014-08-15,0,vFTKENEf3AxbodEshK5W2A,"OK, so went back with the entire family to try the Chicago style food. Sean remembered us, including all our names, so I am giving Brando's five stars for hospitality. The food was good but not what I would consider outstanding. We only tried the dogs and beef sandwiches between the four of us. The unique dog toppings (including tomato slices) made for an interesting twist but we all thought that the dog itself could have been a little bigger to compete with all the toppings. The shaved beef sandwich was very good and my son ordered it ""dry"" while I ordered it ""wet"". We both agreed the ""wet"" was superior by far and on the next trip I think I will try ""soggy."" If you give this a go, definitely go ""wet"" as a minimum.
   By Vegas standards, the food prices were very fair and dare I say, cheap. In and out with dinner for 4 including beers all around and a healthy tip for the good service at under $70. So, overall, I am going to stay with 4-stars. 3 for the food, 4 for the prices, and 5 for the hospitality. Obviously everyone has their own opinion but if you have never been to Brando's I think it would be a very safe bet to a least give your own taste a spin.",8M3BjHToPqcBHQR9imfTlA,0,0,4,qdQkcJvCKgp64CxASXGsWQ

This place is easy to get to, friendly, has a great bar and menu, and of course ALWAYS has the Chicago game on, no matter what the sport. The service can get nuts during games, but it's always good and friendly. The seating can be a bit tough on the back, but it's a bar, and you're there to watch the game with the crowd. 

The food is good. Sausage & peppers, amazing. Pizza can be hit or miss. We've tried the deep dish a bunch of times, and considering this is what Chicago is known for, it's been disappointing. A couple of times it wasn't even cooked all the way through. The toppings are pretty sparse and not spread out evenly. The pizza itself has been inconsistent.

Food - I love it, cause it is artery clogging Chicago style food. So if that is what you are looking for I highly recommend it. 

- Chicago Deep Dish: it is solid, very good, I'm not super into deep dish to begin with but a good choice if you are craving it. 

- Regular Crust: my absolute favorite by far, give me sausage and black olives any day! It is the right thickness and so far has always been cooked to perfection. 

- Thin Crust: has never been my thing unless it is a super fancy pizza that rocks (get my drift?), so if you like cracker thin, this is for you. 

- Italian Beef: AWESOME - that is all. Lol

Good beer selection, they have 312 Wheat on tap and that is my go to.

Atmosphere - there is nothing like a Chicago bar when the Cubs (or any other Chicago team is winning). I watched almost every playoff game there and it was insane. Was it busy? Were they overwhelmed? Heck yes - but everyone was so friendly and the staff was always busting their butts to serve people and that is what matters.

My first impression as we walk in is noticing how small the place is. Enough room for the bar and maybe 10 tables. The menu looked pretty lackluster, so much that I almost anticipated just playing a few bucks then leaving to find lunch elsewhere... But we ended up staying... I just ordered the typical [hot] chicken tenders with fries... I expected the chicken to be those thin, crappy frozen tenders... Well when food finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised! Piping hot fries, yummy ranch, and that chicken was great! Not what I thought it would be at all. And the hot sauce was very tasty. Overall, the bar is basically a sports divebar, some friendly customers at the bar and unexpectedly good food even for a lackluster menu. Teetering between a 3 and 4 star review.

They said they were going here to watch the game, so I decided that I would meet them there.  I was surprised to see it was an all Chicago Sports Bar.  Sox,Cubs, Bulls, and of course Hawks.  

The bar was clean and had a friendly atmosphere not like what you would experience in Chicago itself.  I was starving so I was going with something I know very well...Italian Beef Sandwich with Hot Giardinara and wet. The sandwich and fries came out hot and fresh. The bread was good and the meat thinly sliced and most importantly on an italian beef is that it was seasoned perfectly.   The ""Hot Stuff"" was awesome. The fries were a thick steak cut and also were cooked and seasoned well.  The sandwiches was one of the best I have had and I am giving them four stars for the food.  The Pizzas looked awesome as well, thick and delicious Deep Dish Pizza Chicago Style.  This will have to be ordered next time. 

I was not impressed with the beer selection though, I give them 3 stars for the beer.  They did have a few Chicago Brews like 312 on tap but then it was all your typical Bud, Lite, and PBR.  I think they can work on getting some better brews but I am sure they cater to the crowd they enjoy serving.

Every member of their staff is awesome. I honestly feel more welcomed there than at any other bar in Vegas. Their commitment to making you as comfortable as possible despite the hordes of fans that pile in there is absolutely amazing. I have literally had a waitress see me walk in, grab me, make a makeshift table to seat me and my group, chat for a few minutes to catch up, and then hustle harder than some of the players in the game we're watching to do the same for every other customer there. 

Now, I'll be perfectly honest. If you want to have a nice quite place to grab a beer on a Sunday during a Bears game or during the Stanley Cup Playoffs, this is not the place. But that really isn't what Brando's is about.

If you like anything Chicago related, this is your spot. Hands down. If you want the best Deep Dish in Las Vegas, this is your spot.

Brando's also has vienna beef dogs, Italian beef, Italian sausage, combos and other things that remind you of home.

The pizza was the best on the West Coast that I have ever had that claim to be true authentic Chicago Style Pizza.  It was quite tasty and my friend was pretty happy about it too!  The cool thing is that I felt each time I have been to Brando's that I am home even though I am on the road.  The staff is pretty cool and Nick is a great guy to get to meet and talk with.  Also met Mayor Mike and Assistant Mayor Mike on this trip who only enhanced the fun of being at Brando's!  If you travel to Vegas and need a taste of Chicago than Brando's is a must place to stop!!!

4806790,2017-04-01,0,vFTKENEf3AxbodEshK5W2A,"So here's my take on this place...

I came during the week, party of 2, ordered some wings and a pizza. We were totally okay with the fact that the pizza could take about 45 minutes, because it is the original Chicago deep dish style. In good company, phones aside, wings coming our way, and funny conversation made the wait totally worth it. 

The toppings were pepperoni, sausage & bacon. The only thing that we questioned was the sausage. It literally looked just like breakfast sausage and was cut in half and shoved on the pizza. Totally not what I was expecting when it came to sausage on a pizza. I usually expect little sausage crumbles or sausage 'balls'. This was literally like a breakfast sausage sliced in half or something. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was delish!! It was the first time I had deep dish since I was a wee-wee-soccer-playin' kid! I originally had planned to go to Giordano's, however I had to get my daughter from school and knew that driving to the strip along with the 45-60 min wait for my order would make things a tight squeeze in my scheduled plans. Sooo, we took a trip to this local joint because it was closer and we knew we would have the time we needed for our prior obligations!

The pizza was delicious, but I think the appetizers filled us up, as I only chowed down 2 slices, compared to my usual 3 or 4 MAYBE THE WHOLE PIZZA. ;) 

The food was good, and leftovers made the kids happy, so that's a good reason to come back!",7L8utEpYiVj3pNNjZkQaLQ,1,1,3,dqHtV-atmwMLRhoxtcYzIw

5214936,2017-10-22,1,vFTKENEf3AxbodEshK5W2A,"Brando's reminds me of your typical neighborhood beer and shot bar.  These types of places used to line the streets of Chicago in the 50's-60's-70's-80's.  What makes it better is that it is a CHICAGO BAR.

This place is a great hangout to watch all your Chicago Sports.  Any given Sunday you are most likely sitting next to someone that grew up on the North Side.  So the ambiance gets an A+.

The service is very above average as well.  Always staffed accordingly and for the most part everyone is attentive to your needs during busy game days.  Sometimes when it is packed standing room only, you may need to show some patience.

The food is a great combination of Chicago favorites and bar staples.  Deep dish pizza, Italian beef and Chicago dogs are all fantastic.  And for you Chicagoans that miss a good ole fashioned beer garden, you are in luck!  Equipped with TV's for when it's busy on Sundays.

Brandos is a great bar.  The only thing that keeps me from giving five stars is that most of the menu is very average.  Nothing to brag about.  The Chicago items are great.  The smoke can also be a bit much during busy times and it can get hot inside the low ceiling bar in the summer.

I have been looking for a good place to watch my bears, since I moved here.  My girlfriend suggested we check it out for a monday night football game.  They offer chicago style pizza, which I had to try.  To clear some confusion... Chicago style pizza is NOT deep dish. We do love that in chicago, but Chi Style refers to the way that it is cut. In squares.  Brando's sign says Home of the Square Pizza. It isnt referring to the shape of the pie, but the cut.

anyway, the pizza was awesome.  The sauce was perfect, great crispy crust.  Got a bucket of domestics for 12 bucks, and had really quick attentive service. The bartender/server made an effort to learn our names.

Yelp didn't disappoint.

Our searches led us to this bar and we couldn't be more happier! Immediately upon pulling into the parking lot, we saw the Cubs logo on the front. We walked into the bar and instantly saw a good amount of people in Cubs gear and Chicago sports team decoration EVERYWHERE. It was pretty awesome.

5837838,2014-12-04,4,vFTKENEf3AxbodEshK5W2A,"Long overdue for dining again on comfort food at Brando's, Diane and I returned there on the way back from California, after a 3-year absence.  The place appeared quite the same as before, with several large flat screen televisions spread around, and a thematic emphasis on all Chicago professional sports teams.  We took seats at a cluster of small dining tables on one side of the building, not far from the long bar, and then perused the menu, which has changed some but not much.  Overhead, as they passed through, fan blades kept periodically covering up a ceiling light, which caused a somewhat unpleasant strobe effect on our table top.  And, where we were seated, a few voices carried really loudly from customers standing just behind the adjacent bar.  Our table had a rather dirty top, but our bartender-server noticed and quickly cleaned it before our orders arrived.

Diane opted for a Cheeseburger, which came definitely medium rare as ordered, with a lot of pink showing.  And the cheese draping over the meat was nicely melted.  For my late dinner I selected a Chicago Dog and a BLT, which came with tasty French Fries.  While the fries here were previously thin, these were elongated and somewhat thick.  They were soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  The Chicago Dog was authentic and quite good, with Sport Peppers, tomato wedges, onions, and nice emerald green relish with a fairly long dog nestled in a bun that was studded with poppy seeds.  It took me awhile to realize that no mustard was spread on the hot dog.  But suitable yellow mustard was on the table, which I quickly spread along the remaining wiener and bun.  

The BLT on lightly toasted Sourdough, with lettuce and a touch of mayo, was top heavy with sliced tomatoes and rather bready.  While the bacon inside was good and tasty, the flavor barely came through.  Our server, Sean, was attentive, friendly, and solicitous of our needs,  The food here is good, if one happens to be in the area.

5876963,2013-01-27,3,vFTKENEf3AxbodEshK5W2A,"Hmm, its called Brandos and has nothing to do with Marlon Brando?

Walking in and making that realization we should have left but the on-line menu had an amazing picture of Onion Rings and a good looking photo of a philly cheese steak so we took a seat based on that and the Chicago sports memorabilia hung up around the bar.

It didn't take long for me to notice they dont have draft beer only bottles. If your business is stuck serving bottles you should at least go out of your way to serve hard to find brands and not stuff you can pick up at a local grocery store. I only saw one brand I didn't recognize and was highly disappointed. I know Tenaya creek would be happy to sell you some kegs and get some additional exposure on this side of the valley.

The online menu lies! They dont serve onion rings anymore. The pictures of the Philly sub are miss leading to say the least. The sub I was served was lacking in both size (maybe half the size of the one in the picture)and definitely was lacking in flavor. 

The wings we shared weren't spicy and had an over the top Vinegar taste. Ive said it before and I will say it again Vinegar isnt a good spice on hot/spicy chicken wings.  

The chef salad we ordered had a single slice of very thin lunch meat slice ham. About 100 black olives a single slice of tomato and maybe a Kraft single slice of cheese. It was pretty sad looking.

The waitress was nice, answered questions quickly and was tentative without being pushy or intrusive. She even gave us a free order of fries when she realized I had ordered the waffle fries and was served the regular fries.

Oh I almost forgot! Its a bar serving beer and alcohol but they only have a single toilet in the mens bathroom?! In fact that toilet was the size of a potty training toilet and I cant believe it can hold up to a busy night of swigging bottles.

I wish I could recommend something good on the menu or even say something good about the bar but the only positive thing out of this meal was my GF won $70 bucks on the slot machine during our lunch and we pretty much ate here for free. 

If you live near by it might not be too bad to swing in for a quick beer before going elsewhere for better beer section and food quality. ITS A DIVE BAR SO DONT EXPECT THE Ritz",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,4,2,2,0N5JQ5up9eVyckt63zjhgg
