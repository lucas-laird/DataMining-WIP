1030444,2018-02-04,2,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"Amazing food, worst service in Chinatown.

FOOD: The bossam is definitely worth getting. The medium is good for 3 to 4 people to share. The bossam is a steam pork belly dish where you wrap the meat with various pickled veggies. The napjak bulgogi is my favorite here. It is pretty much a bulgogi pancake and has a lot of flavor. I highly recommend the galbi tang, it is the best Korean soup with soft beef that falls off the bowl and clear noodles.

DRINK: Free soda with check-in!

SERVICE: The service here is horrible! They keep giving me the wrong orders and then they blame me saying I order the wrong thing. No accommodation whatsoever. The check came out and they also charged us for food we didn't order. Every time you ask for anything, the waiters have to check with their managers. I love their food, but I've been here multiple times and end up with problems each time.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,10,6,4,X_0nMmOBGfLgB2SClV-9QA
1352480,2018-02-06,2,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"Came here again for dinner with some other friends the other night on a Saturday evening. We had came here early so parking, tables/seating was ample. 

We were immediately seated, surprisingly the same exactly table as I did last time except my friend sat where I sat. 

We each got our own soups. #10 Garigukbap, #11 Garionmyun, #12 Spicy Garigukbap. 

Spicy Garigukbap is Beef Brisket Spicy Soup. Since i had gotten the Garigukbap last time, I am one to try something different the next time ! This is considerably different from the Garigukbap. I half expected the only change is that its spicy with the same ingredients and preparation. Guess not. Instead of big slices of brisket with tofu, egg strips, and a ball of noodles, it contains tons of napa cabbage and daikon with strips of brisket. In a way, it reminds me of yukaejang or maybe gamjatang. I was hoping to find some potato... Lol Not sure if i liked this that much. It has mild amount of spice but i think i prefer the normal Garigukbap more. 

Garigukbap is Beef Brisket Soup. Ox bone soup base with huge slices of brisket topped with egg strips, logs of tofu, and a ball of noodles. Very simple and clean tasting. Pre-seasoned with salt. 

Garionmyun is Beef Brisket Soup w/ Noodles. Same idea as garigukbap but with noodles instead. same noodles as the small ball of noodles in the garigukbap but more in quantity. The one who ate this said the soup was a bit bland, but i'm not familiar with her tastes. 

There's a free soda with yelp check in but none of us wanted a soda. We originally got hot tea, but two of us ended up getting some cold water cuz we got too hot eating our soups XD 

Probably get the normal garigukbap from now on. Simple and easy. Maybe i'll get to try their lunch specials at some point in time.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,6,2,4,wdYvm0nnjrvrBN1cNBSN3A
1488529,2018-01-24,0,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"This place was a bit of a hidden treasure. I would never have considered going here just driving by. But I was pleasantly surprised. 

I got the Garion noodles, and it was delicious. The broth was clean and refreshing. But to those who like LOTS of flavor, it may be a bit on the bland side.

I also had the mandoo, and it was good. Can tell it was handmade. I tried a little bit of this and that from others in mY group and everyone enjoyed what was ordered. 

I'm looking forward to going back for the galbijjim and some of the other dishes. Definitely recommend.

Update: I returned and tried the fried rice... not really what I was expecting. It was.. ok. Probably won't get it again though. 

My mom got the galbi tang, and it's the first time in Vegas I tasted broth that true to the galbi tang. Even my mom, the pickiest and judgiest... gave her stamp of approval for the soups.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,4,m_S1fzB2JM4AHJpdGNyKZA

2660500,2018-03-24,2,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"Although I hate to admit it, I've been binge'ing kdramas for the past few months. So much that lately I am constantly craving Korean food especially stew, specifically galbi tang. It's come to the point where I purchased a instapot to make it at home-but I'll leave that for another day lol. 

Back to my review. The restaurant is clean and nice, not too big not too small. When you walk in, there's this cool area to the right behind a glass wall where they display a huge pot where they make their broth. Didn't really get to take a good look at it because my daughter was running around but that was what the waitress told us. 

There's a pony wall separating the kitchen and dine in area. This is pretty cool because when you press the little button on your table for service, the waitresses all yell out ""daeeeee"" which I think translates to ""yes"" in English (someone feel free to correct me). Then you just say what you need - just like they do on my kdramas :) oh and if you're looking for the silverware, look for a little drawer in the front of your table - YOU'RE WELCOME!

Ok, now on to the food. They have a pretty legit lunch special so if you can go during this time, I highly recommend it! My husband got a brisket soup + plate of bbq meat for $15. He loved it! I of course got the galbi tang and it was freaking delicious! The broth was super tasty and not oily at all! The galbi was super soft and tender. I just dumped my rice in the pot and went to town! The only thing I was missing was some salt! They serve it with the soup soy sauce which isn't bad but not my preference. We also ordered the kimchi fried rice which was good too - my favorite part is the rice that sticks to the bottom and is super crunchy! Yummmm!!!",hszpZ2COqd8QMfnku9K7Qg,2,1,5,bkEer_-zHGAgHDGhgStayw

The utensils and napkins are a part of the table so you dont have to ask, I really like that. But here is where improvement is needed, there were many unpolished and dirty utensils that it took me digging through 6 of them to find a decently clean one. The best thing about this restaurant I enjoyed regarding service, is that they have a button for service on the table so they don't keep bothering or bombarding during eating time.

The seasoned jjokbal was really tasty, but the flavor we chose was too spicy for me personally. So, if you can't handle heat like myself I would pass on the spicy option if you want to enjoy your food. You also can't go wrong with some good bossam (boiled pork belly) if you prefer your pork less salty. However my favorite is always the classic su-yook jjokbal!! I definitely appreciate the presentation and the banchan(side dishes) that come with it. Definitely a burst of goodness when you wrap the pork trotters in the lettuce with a bit of garlic and side dishes on top!

Just FYI there is a LONG WAIT FOR FOOD. I had a party of 6. I ordered a #8 Beef Brisket Noodle Soup with Grilled pork. We waited about 20 mins for the noodle soup to come out. But the grilled pork didn't come out til about another 30 mins later. My friends waited 40 mins for their food to finally show up. The table next to us was getting mad that they waited almost an hour for their food and still nothing! The staff was very apologetic and tried to get their understanding that there's only 1 cook. To me, it seems like the entire staff is in the back kitchen working but no food is coming out. What gives?! They have a small menu. The soup shouldn't take too long if they had one giant pot of broth ready. And the meat isn't even that big so IDK what their deal is. They gotta step it up for lunch rushes if they want to do well.

Anywho, food wise, it was wonderful. I actually really enjoyed the noodle soup. It was a huge bowl. Thankfully I was sharing with a friend or else I would have been stuffed before the pork arrived. The broth was very flavorful, meat was great, and the noodles were just right. The pork was good but there weren't too many pieces. It did come with rice as well so imagine this huge meal for 1 person. The onions sadly were still a bit raw. Wish it was grilled as well.

FYI, if you need utensils, check the left or right under the table. There is this little slide out drawer with napkins, chopsticks, spoons.

I ordered both the hamburger like bulgogi and the galbitang and I can say categorically that no norcal Korean restaurant and maybe only one other socal restaurant comes close to the quality. Note that this is not your typical korean bbq place so you have to be open minded about trying things you normally haven't if you are not accustomed to korean food. Amazingly delicious!,nHT4LcRqe5M_hSTtvYis0w,1,0,5,hUxS_FiO4apo_Od9DbaWIA
4574259,2018-02-08,2,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"Food Quality: The food was extremely good. We got the Special Combo 15 Grilled Pork and Seasoned Pork Leg with Red Pepper Paste, Handmade Mandu, and fried rice. The food was really good but if I were to recommend anything definitely get the mandu. They were larger than I expected and super super good.

Customer Service: The service was pretty bad. We sat down and no one asked us what we wanted to drink until 10 minutes of us sitting there. It took another 10 minutes for them to realize they haven't taken our order. We ordered our food and the gentleman said ""Are you sure I think this is too much food for just you two?"" and we said ""We know, we just want to take it home too afterwords."" Then he just walked away. Then as we finished up and packed up our leftovers we were saying thank you and good bye and they just stared at us and went back in the kitchen.

All in all food is great but service is mediocre.",G_yIAts-NuBdnp1uYEszpQ,2,1,3,EsyVxxNhojpPAe8anzFDkA
4714858,2018-02-04,1,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"In the last two weeks, many things have improved from garionban. I believe the restaurant originated in Seoul, South Korea. They have soups, galbi jiim, jokbal, and bossam. The restaurant is very clean and is always a great dining experience. 

The first time we went, we had grilled pork galbi and seasoned jokbal, which was mixed with grilled veggies and sweet and soy sauce. We've had mandu both times we have gone and since I was there two weeks ago, they have become more flavorful and it was something myself and my family have all enjoyed. We had the bossam and grilled pork galbi this time. Each time, the size medium has been perfect for 3 people. We also got a soup our first time that was also very good. It's priced pretty reasonably and we've spent about $60-70 each time. 

The service has gotten better and they have worked out a lot of their kinks from when they first opened. I highly recommend getting the homemade mandu, a bossam or jokbal combo plate and will definitely be trying the galbi jiim next time! We look forward to coming back here!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,6,2,5,FGX2v2RKU3pZm2ZJajx6YA
4726048,2018-04-25,0,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"Garionban is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Vegas. I used to only frequent Soyo (bleh), Hobak or 8 (kbbq) and  (soup galore)....but since Garionban has burst into Chinatown, I know what my go-to spot for  will be. 

Tangtangtang also has a very good pork bossam, however, their specialty is soup and they often run out of the bossam, especially on the weekends. This place, however, has yet to disappoint with lack of menu items. The side dishes while few, are plenty good quality wise. Just the right amount of crunch and spice.

I have ordered every soup on the menu- all so good and nice to wash down the rice. 

I have only ordered the Bossam combo because I love it so much. There is a nice ratio of fatty pieces to meaty pieces, good for people who like one or the other or a variety, and they give you lots of veggies and will bring out more  wraps like the cabbage or perilla leaf. I think the only think I wish they added into their greens would be the green pepper that isn't spicy, but just a nice crunch that you can dip into their soy bean paste. 

I am so happy that they have these sorts of places popping up now because I truly miss the authentic places in Buena Park/Ktown in LA. This reminds me of home, and frankly is better than even some of my favorite places back home.

Plus, they had a free soda with a check-in. So make sure you check this place out.",gwnJtHpwDjLZkO38IRwLLQ,0,0,5,lAJck9Q_MM6XJQ6GWLYQEA

Each combo costs about $13-$15 depending on what you want. I ordered their beef soup with dumpling combo. The food came out and it was just 3 pieces of dumplings, 2 side dishes which were kimchi and radish and the soup was just some veggies with beef. I've been to other korean restaurants and they provided at least 4-5 side dishes with the food. I suggest they either lower the price of the food or add more side dishes for their customers.

5094751,2018-06-04,33,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"""Let's get Korean"" announces Midwest poker bud.  ""Kalbi, spicy pork, bulgogi"" he continues.

""Korean sounds great!""  I say as my fellow Asian poker buds nod in agreement.  ""Pig trotters!""  I continue.

""Pig trotters?  Oh come on.  Why don't you guys eat normal food?""  he whines.

Guess who gorged himself on those trotters.

Garionban offers up, a different kind of sharable Korean dining experience.  It's not KBBQ, you won't smell like eau de kalbi when you're done.  The flavors are familiar and the experience social.  Need more convincing?  Koreans traditionally drink while eating this meal.

Two sharable plates stand out.  Sold in two sizes (M for 2, L for 3-4).  Our party of four ordered L of each and finished, barely.

Bossam - pork belly braised with what seems to be ginger, onions, fermented bean paste and spices, sliced thin and served with napa cabbage, chilies, slivered garlic, pickled fermented radish, chili sauce and fermented shrimp sauces.  Take a leaf, add a slice or two of pork, dress it, then eat.  The pork itself, tender, the fat well rendered and adds to the richness.

Jokbal - well braised and seasoned pork trotters.  Somewhat sweet, with hints of ginger, star anise and cinnamon and a warming chili heat.   Very porky, the fat, sweet and supple, the skin providing good chew.  Same set of sides.  Same eating method.

Sharable plates also include a grilled pork (seokgalbi) and braised short rib (galbi jjim).  Several soups in individual portions also avaialble.  None sampled.

The only downside, the restaurant doesn't have its liquor license yet and this food begs for some Korean beer or soju.

Good but minimal Asian service.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,37,33,4,4t0Zr6vQz-h1XZjDn0GPiw

Sides included kimchi, marinated onion, and spicy daikon. Everything was very flavorful. The sauce for the Yangneym Jokbal tasted great but was a tad bit spicy for me. The galbi in the Galbi tang was very tender. I especially liked the flavor of the bossam. I just wish the cabbage they provided was a little easier to wrap.

Atmosphere and decor is very modern. Overall, it was a good experience. And since this place is fairly close to my work, I would like to come back for their lunch special.",Mj5HtrDFyvv1Mt09Igmu5Q,3,2,5,BC_-PayiEZHbyMv0nAQKUg

5349076,2018-01-03,0,i9mqSffakkmhtR_iyBnhnQ,"Vegas have always lacked Korean restaurants and I'm not talking bout Korean BBQ. I'm talking about your authentic Korean establishments that specialize in a specific dish. I have always traveled to SoCal for my Korean fix but recently, Vegas has been trying really hard to keep their locals in the city. Kkulmat opened, TangTangTang opened, and there are even some pocha places that have opened! I have yet to try them ... but what I HAVE tried is garionban. 

Garionban's soft opening was today! Their very first day! They are opened from 11:00 am to 11:00pm. My husband and I have decided to come here for dinner. 

The establishment is very modern and very clean! I love their layout! Their tables are awesome too. They remind me of restaurants in Korea where their tables have a compartment for utensils. It's where they keep all the tissues, chopsticks, and spoons. That way, it doesn't take up room on your table and the servers don't accidentally forget to get you your utensils. 

Garionban specializes in ox bone soup and no matter which soup you get, the base is the same. The only difference between the soups is what they put in the soup for you. Aside from that, they have large dishes for everyone to share, such as bossam (sliced pork belly with condiments), jokbal (boiled pork slices), and galbijjim (braised short ribs). They also have mandus!! Mandus are dumplings and garionban hand makes them! My husband went with their garigukbap while I went with their spicy garigukbap. We also decided to get one order of their mandus to share. Also, I'm not really sure what garigukbap is ... I know gukbap is rice with hot soup. They said that ""gari"" is an old fashion Korean word for ""kalbi"" so garigukbap is beef short rib soup with rice? 

Both of our soups came out piping hot with a bowl of rice. We also got two types of banchan, radish and kimchi, which is pretty normal for establishments that specializes in soups. They don't typically give you a lot of choices for banchan .. I think it's meant to be kept simple. Both were really delicious. The kimchi isn't as garlicy as the one from TangTangTang but it is sweeter and really delicious. My spicy garibukbap was really delicious! It had napa cabbage in it and pieces of beef. It actually reminds me of yukaejang (spicy beef soup) except with better beef. I've never been a fan of the shredded beef in yukaejang. The regular garigukbap is also very tasty! It has a really nice beefy flavor to it yet it's light and very clean. 

Their mandus were huge! They were stuffed with tofu, noodles, veggies, and a little bit of meat. They serve it with two different types of dipping sauces and I believe both had a mixture of soy and vinegar. The flavor profile was really good .. it even has a little bit of spice in them for a kick. But no worries, after my spicy garibukbap, I can't even taste that the mandus have spice. 

I can't wait to come here with my friends to try their bossam. I also noticed that they serve cold jellyfish here! I definitely want to try that as well! 

Garionban opened just in time! It's the perfect weather for some piping hot, delicious soup! I definitely recommend this place!!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,8,1,5,uZGkHOkjaoarn0CXjQLztQ

We're not sure if the server had forgot to put the order in, or if it just takes 45 min for bossam to come out.
