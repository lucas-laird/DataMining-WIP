I waited in line for 7 minutes and at the window for 8. A total of 15 minutes for my food. I asked the manager if I could have a drink for the wait and he REFUSED. Are you kidding me? Do you know how much gas I wasted sitting in line? You can't even give me a free $1 soda for the inconvenience. 

On top of that my orders are always wrong or missing something. I'm so tired of these fast food places being so shitty because the employees don't know how to get off their asses.",qL8kK10_FO217LpschJTsA,0,0,1,_oyUTiX6hx3vyBTMMtWqBQ

I order a nacho and in Mii tray I find about 6 burned French fries . Seriously !!!!!!! Not to mention a roach in my strawberry lemonade ! I will never eat at this or probably any other del taco . They have the nerve to have a grade A hanging in the kitchen. They need to be visited by health department. To mention they barely even speak English at an American Taco Chain where is the sense ?

Zero stars zero stars zero stars",AM1SisLVAch7Mblb27OTVg,1,1,1,iIRoGmQCbChm8hJRJCyDcw

This time I wasn't given the nachos I ordered and paid for... And no receipt.

Great. Thanks for charging me for the lunch I didn't get to eat.",oDzGIJ78utjfAoWFybZgOA,0,0,1,OK9B6FGwJQxmcWQDSs2Okw
