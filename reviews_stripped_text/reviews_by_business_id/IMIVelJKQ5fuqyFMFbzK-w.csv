Even though serviced and food sucked the second time , decided to return again because I was being lazy in not wanting to cook, but guess what THE RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED DOWN...but I am not surprised. Places like this usually do not last long. Food is not consistent and service can suck.",X4AM6vN3cXY8DYKO59lp-g,0,0,2,w2NuQ7Grxw1EC_VIcTLPyQ

Small restaurant  greeted with reggae video and music from a flat screen and sound system.  Ordered curry goat , beef patties and a bottle of ginger beer.  Rice was properly cooked, curry goat was  well seasoned tasted just like from yard.  Honestly, I was not expecting much but Jammin Jerk delivered a truly authentic Jamaican, Caribbean cuisine and feel.  The location is not ideal but the food is Irie mon.  I would definitely recommend Jammin Jerk Hut to friends and family.",aGbXePEiRtSgRf-XM5GLLw,0,0,4,rhEPs85a4wZ5sgyxMjNCRA

The food was delicious with hearty portions.  I had the oxtail and jerk chicken dinner plate and it was fantastic!  The oxtails were soooo tender and seasoned heavily and to perfection.  The jerk chicken was fresh off the grill and reminded me of sandy Carribean beaches where I have enjoyed mouth watering cuisine like this before.  Washed it all dow with a bottle of refreshing Ting.

I will certainly be back, and will drag everyone I know along for some good eats.

Great job guys!  Thanks for keeping it authentic!",-oMYbzn3YsOZUAIA-B_khA,1,0,4,7zIZvvIhxdyuPzTMB9QdHQ

The meat pie was tasty, I still crave this like crazy.  I'm giving this place two stars because of their awful customer service. I tipped them since the woman who took my order was very nice, but the two guys who worked there looked at me and didn't say anything.  I expect at least a thank you, because I tip isn't necessary or required.  When I entered I didn't get greeted, when leaving I didn't get a have a nice day.  I actually had to speak first and say that I ordered for takeout.  Customer service is a big deal and when an establishment lacks it, I usually won't return even if the food is good.   So I give 2 stars for the meat pie, fix the service and work on the jerk chicken.",43OClbvEv9HaY1oEaNA5IQ,0,0,2,tx1rmGb_e9pYK29qrMfxiQ

I'm not Jamaican but been to Jamaica, and eaten from street vendors there, plus had Jamaican food in NY, DC and all over the US. Just not spicy and tasty enough and its more expensive too. Portions are smaller. I've been to the other jamaican spot in town and the quantity was bigger and jerk chicken more tastier. I'll still try them out later just because not that many options in vegas and I love me some Caribbean food.

The Jerk Chicken Breast meat was dry but the other parts were full of flavor and really taste. They make there own authentic juices which my wife grew up with it and she loved them.

Well, one day I decided to try House of Flav, but when I heard the Reggae music and smelled the grilled food next door, needless to say, I had to try it.  I've been back numerous times since then, and each time the food was excellent!  They cook it fresh to order, and the atmosphere transports you to Jamaica!

The young man working the register said he didn't know what it was then in the next breath he stated you get smaller portions if you use it. The next is the selections of drinks were limited and not only that it was 4.00 for a small drink. I ask for a cup of water and he said all he has is tap water and he doesnt want to serve that. Also it states on a sign outside that if you spend $20.00 you get a free bowl of soup. They never even mentioned it my party. Last the sitting was horrible. There is enough room for a party of 4.

2604499,2013-08-29,2,IMIVelJKQ5fuqyFMFbzK-w,"Ok so was really hyped that there was a Jamaican restaurant in Vegas so decided to check this place out. First off we walk in and its dark and two people sitting at bar and another lady sitting at a table, she acknowledge us after I said ""do we just sit anywhere."" After that another lady came out and we got served rather fast, which was nice. We had the chicken foot soup which was great. Then we ordered the oxtail with rice and peas and plantain and my daughter was talked into getting the fish. This is where it starts going down hill. The rice and peas tasted as if it was old and the oxtail was just ok and was missing the butter beans. Then my daughter's dish was $18 and I noticed that she got half of the fish while the server was eating the other half. I could be wrong but my daughter got the tail end of the fish and the server was eating the head portion of it in her dinner. Then after we finished our soda's we wanted some water and was given bottled water which ran $1.99 a piece, now I see in Vegas that you can go to the store and get a 24 pack of water for $2.99 or less so I felt a little ripped off. Our bill ran over $100 for all 4 people. Very disappointed since my family is Jamaican and I know how the food is really suppose to taste. I have had better and only the soup was worth going back for. Probably wont go back if I am ever in Vegas again.",7HkgmHQKWMbWlcJZ0LKTRg,6,0,1,o7LHshB-bYhvA_clM-tRmg

The prices matched the quality of food and portion size.  Our to-go boxes were filled to the top with meat, salad and beans & rice.  We had never had oxtails, but they were delicious!  The jerk was seasoned well but not crazy spicy.  Glad I bumped into that nice Jamaican guy who told me about this place!  Everyone there was friendly, they invited us back for karaoke night and they let us split the drink into two cups so we didn't get too tipsy from the strong Jamaican rum!  I will definitely be back!

3217096,2012-04-13,0,IMIVelJKQ5fuqyFMFbzK-w,"I stopped in here on a Thursday night around 8pm. I was drawn in by the sandwich board sign that had all sorts of good dishes listed. The restaurant was much bigger on the inside than expected and it was brightly lit, colorful and welcoming.

However, when I opened the door, I only saw 4 people sitting at a circular table towards the middle/ back of restaurant. I wasn't sure if they were customers or people who worked there. They didn't acknowledge my presence so I waved a little and asked, ""Are you open?""

Someone answered, ""Yes,"" but they all continued to sit there. Talking amongst themselves. Were they playing cards? Having a staff meeting? I don't know, but it was bad customer service to not get up and show us a table or at least smile and stand up.

My friend an I picked a table and went to sit.
Menus appeared but no drinks were offered.
The four of them continued to sit at the table.
It looked like one of them was folding menus.
Maybe the other 3 people were friends visiting the restaurant.
Maybe not.

But a customer standing in front of you takes priority over folding menus and chatting amongst yourselves.

The menu choices looked good. It's too bad I didn't have a server to come talk to us and keep our interest. My friend and I took this bad start as an omen to bad service for the whole meal and we got up and left.

Service at a restaurant is nearly as important as the food. Nothing makes food taste worse than bad service. And you can be sure, a customer won't come back if bad service was given and no amends were made to make it better. Worse yet, a customer will give a bad review and tell their friends the service sucked.

As much as I would give this place a one-star, I respect the fact that this is a ""mom & pop"" kind of place, I'm not trying to drop their business. However, these folks need to know because of my experience, if someone told me the food was awesome here, I'd have to follow up with my personal experience outlined in this review.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,6,0,2,PEMVLPF-HZF9_JVfIDbQcQ

Owner says they are in transition, looking to bring more Caribbean flavor to Las Vegas. I had the curry chicken and it blew my mind... Such flavor and the chicken was very tender.

3698180,2012-05-25,1,IMIVelJKQ5fuqyFMFbzK-w,"This place is not what I expected it to be, but I will confess that the food is good. Tucked in the corner of a plaza, right next to the House of Flavor, you'll notice that this restaurant must have been a former office of some sort. The kitchen? Located in the back of the plaza which I assume they smoke or grill in an actual BBQ grill which they make as you order. 

At night it turns into a Jamaican nightclub or chill spot where you can listen to reggae all night. They even have a VIP SECTION (which is basically your mom's dining table that seats 8). Their counter consisted of a foldout table with a basic cash register, microwave, and rice cooker. 

Anyway, I ordered the jerk chicken which comes with a small salad and fried plantains. I also ordered a side of festivals and beef patties. The jerk chicken was delish! Tender meat and right amount of flavor and spice (however jerk chicken is naturally spicy for me all together). The salad is basically your typical pre-made iceberg lettuce mix. My personal favorite was the beef patties and the festivals! The beef patties are REALLY spicy I had to keep watering it down with water but it's good that way. The festivals are these fried sugar powdered donuts. More fried than doughy which was sssssoooo good. I can't deny that I kept wanting more and was so sad when I came to the end of my helping.

Place is a-ok. I might not come by to eat at the establishment, but I may come to order take out. I probably won't go out of my way for it though. If you ask me, I think this place would make an awesome food truck business!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,1,3,6Q60wV8mVxo736XVl3JQYg

4419401,2012-07-11,3,IMIVelJKQ5fuqyFMFbzK-w,"Our family was led to the Jammin' Jerk Hut by a Restaurant.com coupon.  The location is at the very end of a strip mall circa early 1980s, which is completely vacant, save for the very last three storefronts:  the Jammin Jerk Hut; the next-door storefront, which is Flavor Flav's House of Flavor; and the room on the other side, from which we could hear live reggae music being played.  I like reggae, but I was a bit concerned because my daughter is very sensitive to loud music and other noises.

We entered the restaurant to find two people inside, one of whom apparently is the proprietor, and the other seemed to be a friend of his.  Interestingly, you could barely hear the music once inside.

The atmosphere is pretty nice for a small ethnic restaurant.  It had interesting wicker furniture and art, and the room is painted bright colors.  There was a documentary movie about Bob Marley and the Wailers playing on the TV.

We chose a booth and sat down.  The proprietor came over to ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  We ordered water.  He asked what type of bottle.  I asked for tap water.  It was 114 degrees in Las Vegas that day. 

""We don't have tap water,"" was the reply.

I reluctantly ordered a large bottle of Perrier water, not knowing how much it would cost.  He touted the homemade Jamaican juices, so I ordered my daughter a pineapple-tamarind juice for a steep $4.99.

After several minutes, he returned with drinks and we ordered.  We were interested in the curry shrimp, and my daughter was excited to see dumplings.  They were out of both.  

I asked what kind of fish the fish was, and he said he had tilapia and butterfish.  We settled on jerk chicken and steamed butterfish.  My daughter also got a Jamaican beef patty.

Then we waited, and waited.  He was cooking himself and was busy with that back in the kitchen, or maybe he was grilling outside.

Meanwhile another woman entered.  She asked us at one point if we had ordered, but otherwise appeared busy with other things, and then not so busy, but did not come back to check on us.

After at least 20 minutes, by which time our kids were very cranky, he brought some plantains in tinfoil, some jerk rice in a styrofoam container, and the jamaican meat patty on a ceramic plate, along with four small plastic forks wrapped in paper napkins.

I asked him if he could bring any more plates, pointing to the ceramic plate.  He muttered something like ""we don't usually do that"" and left.

The plantains were very good, although not quite hot.  The rice was good.  The meat patty ($2.59) was delicious.  It is very similar to an empanada, with a slightly spicy ground beef filling, but not too spicy for my daughter.  She was very happy with it.  

About 10 minutes later, he brought the jerk chicken and fish, on ceramic plates.

My wife thought the jerk chicken (about $11) was ok, but I thought it was excellent, as was the potato salad and rice on the side.  The side green salad was fresh and good, although there was no dressing.  I don't know if this was by design or by accident, but this dinner was already a big hassle and we didn't want to wait another half hour for dressing.

There was nothing wrong with the way the fish (about $19) was prepared, steamed with onions, carrots, potatoes, and seasonings, and it was definitely fresh, but it wasn't really my thing.  However, I'm pretty sure he brought me the tilapia because it didn't taste like butterfish.  It also came with excellent potato salad, green salad, and rice.  It seemed expensive for what it was.

To summarize, the food was good, but the service was quite possibly the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant, anywhere.  I don't usually care so much about service, but it really needs to meet a minimum level, which this didn't.  Also, as long as I am in a fully developed country and paying first-world prices, I don't appreciate not having the option of ordering tap water.  

After a few attempts of ringing us up, the total was about $53, less a $15 coupon, for a net of $38.  Even with the coupon, it felt a bit expensive. I'm glad they didn't remember to add the standard 18% tip associated with a restaurant.com coupon because they certainly didn't deserve one.  

I gave him my credit card and he disapppeared briefly.  My wife was outside and she later told me she saw him in Flavor Flav's.  Apparently they share a credit card reader.

From reading other reviews, apparently this place previously was a take-out only establishment.  It would behoove both the owners and customers to go back to being take-out only.  This would relieve them of the burden of service.   I would order the jerk chicken and meat patty again, but only by phoning in a take-out order.   

Or even better, why not sell the jerk chicken at a table at a farmer's market or swap meet, so they could just focus on one item without running out of things.  I'm sure they would do very well and have many happy customers.",uFoLXDuKKbM6knOiQedVzw,6,1,2,AawgXIWHKQVMOoZkmqSoJw
