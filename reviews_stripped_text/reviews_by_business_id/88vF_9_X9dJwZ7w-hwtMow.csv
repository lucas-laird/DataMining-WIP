For 2 people to have breakfast platter, 1 coffee, & 1 juice, total was $29.

Took 20 minutes to get check after we'd finished eating.

Took another 30 minutes to get someone to charge the card so we could leave!

Fairly generous portions on the beers, though the draft selection is minimal. Instead of trying to create their own food, which would likely be a disaster like most airport restaurants, they have decided to offer food prepared by Nathan's and Jersey Mike's...probably a good idea.

The caprese salad didn't look like much on the plastic plate and silverware, but it actually tasted pretty decent! My Las Vegas Lager was also tasty and of the beer choices, I'm glad I ordered this one. 

Take note they encourage community seating, especially if hiding in a corner while waiting for your flight is your preference. I found a seat at the bar, which I expect some degree of conversing with my neighbors to happen, so this wasn't too out of place.

I love that I could sit down at the bar before my flight and grab a drink. I also ordered a sandwich and was pleasantly surprised that it was from the neighboring sandwich shop that I love. I will happily pay a couple extra bucks to get the food that I like at a bar in the airport.

The hubby got a salad and added chicken for a nominal price. It was nice to see some low calorie/low carb options on the menu in Vegas.

Stop by the Lucky Streak at LAS is if you are heading the the Bay Area. It is further away from the Southwest gate you will most likely be heading to but that also means you will be able to take a seat at the bar and enjoy a drink and lunch before heading back to the Bay!",87AXJ_GCGhz7RntCvbokLw,2,2,4,2LI6EocUtd0CTpnHfv6t7Q
