So when we got a deal from Travelzoo we come for a lunch right away, but we are told they are not open during lunch time !! What a bummer !! We are pretty upset but decided to try week after for the dinner instead.  When we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess told us their kitchen is closed due to slow business !!!  OMG !!!   Our Travelzoo deal expire on 11/ 30.  Why no one took effort to inform us about restaurant hour change when we told them we are there to use Travelzoo deal. We could go on Monday ( they are open FRI - MON  we are told this time,  if they told us that last time, we could come on Monday easily !! ).

90911,2014-09-09,0,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"I'm usually against doing reviews online & any type of social media but for this one, I just had to!
Came in to originally check out THE GRIDDLE, just this past Saturday, cause we heard such great things. Stood in line for a while..but you know we thought if the food is that good..wait will be worth it. Sat down and waited quite a while and didn't get greeted. So we left in such anger with empty stomach and decided to go somewhere else. 

On our way out, we saw a burger joint. Only thing I didn't like about it?   It was way too loud! Of course my husband liked it. We got greeted right away but this cute little Asian girl, introduced herself as ANNE. 
She knew everything on the menu and us being hungry we totally took all her recommendation.  She even recommended this drink that I thought I wouldn't like, but she said if I didn't like it, she would take it  off of my check. I ordered 2 of that same drink! 
Now, that's not the only thing I was impressed by. My husband is very adventurous so unique flavors are good for him. As of for me? I'm a plain kind of gal. Told Anne I didn't like their um ami ketchup and I wanted a regular one. And she said we don't offer regular but she'll make it work but give her a couple of minutes. She went to the other restaurant to get us our regular ketchup. She also repeatedly apologized for the griddle even though she didn't work for them, that's more than i got from the restaurant itself! This place definitely won my heart! 

Great extra ordinary food
Excellent friendly staff, what more can you ask for? 
Turkey burger was the best and this one cucumber drink!

As a local, and a foodie in Las Vegas I don't usually subscribe to reviews that I read about restaurants until I experienced it myself. Well, apparently the reviews on this place are spot on. All I have to say is save your time and money and go to Bachi burger for a Wagyu burger for the same price as the smaller truffle burger you get here. Minimal flavor, and the portion sizes are very small. Much better quality at Bachi and the truffle fries are much to be desired. Also I could use a little less of the football Mongoloids at the sports bar. If we don't keep them honest they're are just going to keep churning out mediocre burger joints.

Umami's beer garden has great outdoor seating and to compliment that an extensive beer menu to compliment their many appetizers and entrees. I had the Ahi Poke for an appetizer with the in house made chips paired with a burger that Ashely selected. Umami Burger and Beer Garden is a first rate joint and I would strongly recommend friends and family to visit!

Food: Food was great. My friends and I had a few  orders of wings, which were great. The sauce was really good, we also had some nachos which were amazing. When I ordered them I thought it was going to be an OK amount of nachos, but when we got them I was like ""Oh sh*t! That's a lot of nachos."" it was a mountain of them. We also had some burgers which were pretty good too. All the food came out to us pretty quick, considering there were a lot of people there. 

Drinks: We had that all you can drinks package which was pretty good, so it was worth it. Got to enjoy a lot of drinks while watching the game. 

Service: Service was excellent! Food didn't take too long, neither did the drinks. Our server's was Eddie, I think. He was good, quick, and very nice, didn't take long to get our drinks. Always checked on us to see if we were okay with food, water, or drinks, which was awesome. The bussers (Joe and Eric) were real nice and attentive as well, we never had a bunch of stuff in the way because the bussers took everything we didn't need right away, so our table wasn't a clutter. 

This place was really cool, I love the amount of TV's they have, they're literally everywhere. No matter where you turned you couldn't miss a part of the game. The vibe was real nice, and hype. Seemed like it was the place to be! Only thing that could have made it better would of been a win for the Seahawks! Will be back.",giFIs_pEEN7THjBbhmUOBA,0,0,5,yHwofsOSsngXPg9NBGxk0A

The sunny side burger with the sweet potato fries, WOW! SO. GOOD!  Ask them to make a spicy margarita.  It's not on the menu but the server had the bartender make it (after a little bit of attitude first) but wow did they come out good.  
 
This place has a MASSIVE outdoor patio with ample seating, lots of TVs, and great exposure to the strip.

The service was okay but nothing great.  Hostess walked off without telling us to follow him.  It took much longer than it should have to get our food and drinks.  It was a Saturday morning and hardly anyone in the place.  That's my reason for 3/5 rather than a 4/5.

I'll never understand why a beer garden has a wall of vodka, but anyhow... We finally gave Umami Burger a try. The Code sent my husband 50% off for his birthday. It seemed like a good excuse to give it a whirl.

Service was attentive. Our waitress got started on our Union Jack ($9) and Mama's Little Yella Pils ($8) while we looked over the menu. We settled on the Manly burger ($12) for him and the Umami aka Original burger ($12) for me. Both prepared medium rare. We ordered two secret menu items: Cheesy Tots ($5) and Manly Fries ($6.50).

Prior to our food coming out, we were given house condiments: jalapeno ranch, mega spicy and garlic aioli. We were warned of the spiciness but didn't believe it would be as hot as it was. We enjoy spicy too. We didn't like the aioli at all, but the jalapeno ranch was the standout. It livened up the original burger and it was good on the tots and fries. Also, better than the housemade ketchup.

The Umami burger is topped with caramelized onions, roasted tomato and one shiitake mushroom, and parmesan frico. The burger to bun ratio is good, the bun was decent. I like the branding of buns - it's a good emphasis of their brand. The patty was of good size. All of which are good things, but why was it so bad? I wondered. It came down to the meat being overdone. It was dry and bland. There was no juiciness at all. The caramelized onions and parmesan frico were the only redeeming qualities. What's with one shiitake mushroom? You better enjoy that single bite.

The Manly burger is topped with beer cheddar, bacon lardons, onion strings and slathered with ketchup and mustard. It was not cooked medium rare, it bordered on medium to medium well. This was, however, the better burger of the two. Still, both were pretty disappointing.

The sides, though, were quite good. The tater tots were salty, potatoey, crisp on the outside and gooey in the center. I really enjoyed them. The manly fries were quickly consumed. Crisp shoestring fried topped with beer cheese, bacon and onion strings, kinda hard to go wrong there. I guess the secret menu is where it's at!?!

They will text you when your table is ready, which I think is cool.   Sat down, got the beverages in a pretty timely manner.  Fried pickles were tasty, full spears served with a garlicky jalapeno ranch sauce (too runny, but flavorful).   Then it just went downhill.  

Our order of Cali Burger, Manly Burger and Manly Fries seems simple enought, right?

Of those, the burger was the winner and the main reason for my 4 stars since it was the main part of the meal for us. It was soooo tender, juicy and flavorful. We really enjoyed it. The onion rings were breaded nicely and fried, but not greasy. Unfortunately they were totally flavorless. We told our waitress, but it wasn't taken off the bill or anything despite us clearly eating less than half of them. 

The wings were ok. I felt the bleu cheese dipping sauce was really a detriment to the wings as it was nearly bitter and a runny consistency....rather odd in my opinion. I love dipping my wings in bleu cheese, so I was really let down on that one

I also ordered a Pepsi because my hypoglycemia had badly kicked in, so I was really surprised to see it come in a bottle. Definitely trendy, but honestly, I prefer it from the fountain, especially for the price and no refill. 

The presentation was really impressive, the atmosphere was really fun and laid back, especially for people like us who had literally only been in town for maybe an hour.

1099074,2014-11-19,6,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"SLS? Seriously Lacks Satisfaction.

This is no more obvious than at Umami Burger, destination for our latest foodventure. But foodventures are not always successful, as Umami (Japanese for something) would prove. When Mama R wanted a burger for her birthday, Emijandro and I found it as our opportunity to try the much talked-about burger spot at SLS and off we went.

My thoughts on SLS itself are... sub-par at best, but this review strictly focuses on Umami Burger, which we found along the wall fairly easily. Walking in, there was a very... recycled... feel to the place, which I thought was supposed to be an urban hipster sports bar vibe. But one glance at the CHECKERED FLAG CEILING ABOVE revealed they just gutted the NASCAR Cafe and didn't bother to redo the ceiling.

When we were seated, we were handed small, trifold menus. Mine was dirty.

Seriously, your F&B department could have printed a ton of those, but you're giving me a dirty one?

Maybe it was to hide the fact that the basic burger was $12. No fries. NO GAWDANG FRIES. **flips table**

I ordered the Manly Burger, without the beer-cheese (?) as I don't care for cheese on my burger. The (dirty) menu said it had ""bacon lardons"" on it. ""Ryan,"" you may be asking, ""what in the Sam Hill is a 'lardon?'"" I didn't know either, but it's somehow related to bacon, so I took the risk ($$) along with an order of Tempura Onion Rings ($) and water (HAH TAKE THAT CORPORATE MURRKA!). Emijandro ordered the Jose Andres Burger ($$$) and Mama R ordered the basic burger. Well, basic according to Umami's standards.

The burger is an art form. I know. I'm a burger connoisseur. A burger gourmand, if you will. Its art is found in its simplicity. A patty made out of some meat, toppings-a-go-go, and a bun. Delightful. But at some point Umami just made it all too fancy-schmancy. First off, lardons are apparently cubed bits of slab bacon. I suppose that's fine, but some thick strips of bacon are just as tasty and probably less expensive for the restaurant so they can lower their prices. Secondly, would have liked some barbecue sauce on this type of burger (also had onion strings), not their Umami Ketchup (Japanese for something ketchup), which really was just ketchup, nothing really different.

The burger was too pink for my taste -- apparently my waiter heard ""medium rare"" instead of ""medium please."" Or he was just dumb or hated his job -- the service was unsatisfactory, he spoke too quietly for a sports bar atmosphere during the third quarter of Monday Night Football, and dropped items repeatedly  (fortunately not our food). When we could hear him, he was being pushy about us ordering dessert.

Listen, dude, I know you're supposed to upsell, but when my bill is already about $19, don't give me a look when we say no to dessert.

Which I could have gone for, by the way, because for that type of money, the burger was small. To be fair, I didn't leave hungry, but I didn't leave with that OMG NO MORE FOOD IT WAS TOO GOOD kind of feeling. It just left me with a general MEH. I shouldn't leave with MEH for $19.

A few positive notes: The onion rings were tasty, though I could have used a dipping sauce beyond the four tiny little ladles of sauce they provide, one being the Umami Ketchup (something ketchup), and one being HOLY CRAP MY BUTT WILL REGRET THAT TONIGHT kind of spicy.

Umami should be Japanese for ""overhyped."" If you want the best burger on the Strip, it's still at Holsteins at The Cosmopolitan. Or stay off-strip and you can find a lot of high-quality burgers at a much lower price point. Either way, maybe SLS stands for Satisfaction Low, Sorry.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,4,4,1,kRTW5LIFOqNulRKS1baOaQ

I ordered the Manly Burger, and I just didn't really like it.  I removed the bacon lardons cause they are just too thick for me to find appetizing.  The cheese is more of a cheese sauce, kind of runny and hardly any flavor.  And part of their thing is there is no lettuce or tomato or onion or pickles.  I'd rather eat at Smashburger or even 5 Guys for a tastier burger.  I did try the Sweet Potato fries, based on other reviews - and they were pretty good. Also, nice that you can get a beer - quite a large selection, and I think mixed drinks too. 

Our server was friendly and the food didn't take that long to arrive.  But the atmosphere here is also lacking, in my opinion.  It's like eating in the middle of a noisy sports bar - with TVs everywhere you look.  And if that's what you want - then that is great.  And then, also, with the Strip location - you are gonna pay way more than at any normal spot.  2 burgers, 2 sides, 1 beer, 1 pepsi, + tip: $50.00.",x7b_X7RGXds47C3BKdJbXA,0,0,2,6oWLy4tzmhO4zWeXWgogew

But that makes it all the more disappointing, because then I had to wait around again to get a properly cooked burger. (And let's be realistic, unless the meat is cut on the property, hamburger meat needs to be carefully cooked.) The fried pickles were excellent. The onion rings were obviously dropped into a fryer that was too cold since the batter was exceedingly oily and had little flavour and we only ordered them because so many people rave about them, only to find them almost a total disappointment that we didn't even want to eat.

Very flavorful and the juices just oozed with every bite.  They put thick slabs of bacon chunks on top of the burger so when you bite into one, you just get a big chunk of chewy, moist bacon flavor.

Each bun was branded with the ""U"" logo which was pretty cool.  Not too pricey, but everything is Ala carte so fries are separate. :(

Looks like a great place for parties.  Very trendy, but when I was there, it was not too busy so although it was a nice atmosphere with large screens everywhere, the room lacked the buzz.

Nice drink menu.  Even offered frozen Kirin beer, which sounded yummy, but too cold for this Hawaii girl in Vegas!

Sunny helped us out and he was the most perfect server, a F&B operations manager can ask for:  attentive but not overbearing, quick but not clumsy, made cocktail suggestions for my cold (yes, I was drinking with a sinus/respiratory infection. #yolo)and THE BEST thing ANY server can do, which Sunny did with finesse, is to fix mistakes rapidly without making into a huge deal to draw attention.

I let my hubby order food choices for the both of us because I always end up eating his dish.  He ordered the Umami & Manly burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and the Beef Barbacoa Quesadilla.

I had their Caesars salad. It was not fishy. Which is one of my criteria - few anchovies. However, it was bland to an extreme. There was nice lettuce, a few croutons, and those expensive hatch cheese crisps. And some white dressing that was undetectable. It was like 10 bucks. For lettuce. 
My server was great. Very nice and helpful. 
The outside patio was almost fun to be at. The concept was there - the execution was not.  Cheap regular wood patio tables. Next to the noisy strip/Sahara intersection.

Perhaps, it may have been my fault that I got a Turkey burger over a Cow burger.....but nonetheless I still got a burger. 

Turkey burger: 2.5/5- The buns were fluffy and soft. I do have to admit that I thoroughly enjoy a great burger when the buns are fresh. I hate stale buns, what's the point of that. Secondly, I was mildly obsessed with the fact that my burger had sprouts on it. Double points. Thirdly, this is where I couldn't do it anymore. This green salty sauce was horrible. It overpowered the burger and it was extremely salty for my palate. UGH!

Truffle Fries: 3/5- I could go on about these. I love cheese on my fries and even better truffle oil. I must say that the truffle oil was a little bit on the lighter side, but the cheese made up for it. 

Sweet Potato Fries: 2/5- Why is their sugar on these? You may want to let patrons know that it is covered in sugar. I was thoroughly saddened by the sugar on these fries.....

Poke: 2/5- My fault for ordering poke at a burger place. It just sounded good at the time. Too much sauce that covered the poke. Not the best poke ever.....",Xv_1QL4QanJGADDG1DQgiQ,3,1,2,MbbDVh2wcFnozh57DmML7Q

The chicken fingers were indeed extra crispy and well done.  The jalapeño ranch dip was strongly jalapeño and the first bite was a little much for me.   When I added less dip to chicken it was tasty.   Husband liked the burger...saying the bacon lardons (like French fry sized bacon pieces) was weird but good.

We came with a group of 8 and were easily seated outside at one of the picnic tables. Only disappointment with that is that we were seated on the far left side where there was no light. And it was bout 7pm and so it was dark. Would have been nice to be seated closer to the lit bar, or inside.

Drink specials during football season are amazing and so our beer drinkers were very pleased. I had a tequila/ginger beer cocktail that was delicious and well worth its $13 price tag.

Food wise, I had the cali burger and smothered fries. Everything was beyond delicious. The burger was thick and super juicy. I like the homemade american cheese and the caramelized onions were perfect. The smothered fries were heaven as the short rib was very tender and the gravy was super good. I had some of my cousin's beet salad and that was very good as well. 

Service was my main reason for deducting a start as our server wasn't around very much. There would be long stints that she was gone, even though the restaurant was quite empty. She also quickly asked to process our check as she had tickets to a concert that night and wanted to leave as soon as she could. Made us feel really important.

1495745,2015-10-06,0,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"My first trip to Umami was pretty stellar. The burger was perfect and so were my truffle fries... I'm honestly not sure what happened in the 3 months that it took me to come back, maybe my palate changed? That and perhaps the service... no, the service definitely changed.

I'll start from the beginning. On my second visit to Umami, we had originally wanted a booth but were told that three guests were waiting ahead of us (still unsure how that one booth remained empty during our time at Umami)... we were also told that a private event was being held in the Beer Garden so we couldn't enjoy the nice weather either. We ended up taking the table that they offered us instead. The table was in the middle of everything, it seemed. Not only that, but in one of the more crappy locations to view the TVs. TVs were important during this particular visit considering that football was on. This table was also the table of a server who was either swamped or due for a break. 

A host dropped some water off for us but it took about 15 minutes for someone to actually greet us and take our drink order. We had ordered chips and queso to start, pretty simple. The chips and queso actually arrived before our beers. Chips were pretty bland, not sure what exactly I was expecting out of chips, but they were that bland that I feel the need to address it here, ha! The queso was also lacking some flavor. I was pretty hungry though so I gobbled it down mindlessly. 

The burgers were the main thing that we came here for. We had found a Groupon that offered dinner (a burger and a side) for two ($40 value) for $25... yeah, not really worth getting at all. The burgers were tasty, per usual. This time around we ordered the garlic and parm fries... they were simply okay. It would have been nice to have the parm cheese melted... but it was not. Simply sprinkled on top; the fries weren't even warm enough to melt it. 

My biggest gripe this time around was the Groupon situation... the deal said that it was a $40 value but they split the bill and only applied $25 to our bill! We basically just went through Groupon to pay $25 of our bill. What in the world? The server was nice about explaining that the deal was specifically for 2 burgers and 2 sides, and I understand that it was out of his control. Seriously though, Umami? Why list that you're getting a $40 value for $25 when you're really just getting $25 for $25? LOL! 

Overall, the service ended up being ok, after we finally got a chance to put our order in. The food was ok, nothing stellar like our first experience. This place has potential to be awesome (again)... just gotta go back to whatever it was they were doing 3 months ago. :)",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,1,0,3,ZNqO8o0GiPt3sL9MX_U3TQ

Not entirely certain what it was, but it was yummy.  We also ordered the Umami burger, which was very good (so I hear, as I don't do mushrooms).

Now, down to business. I ordered the impossible burger. The cost was really high. It was about $18 just for the burger. The side of fries was another $8 or so. I did get truffle fries which were delicious. The burger was really tasty and it came with two patties. I also ordered a lemonade which was $4. My girlfriend got a salad and a beer. The salad was around $12 and a beer was $13. I would come back here but not often since it costs so much. But on a special occasions or to treat myself.

I ended up sending mine back because I don't like the fondue type of cheese that came on it... Nor did I like the bacon lardons- they are too thick and not as tasty as real bacon. I was frustrated... I just wanted a bacon cheese burger with real solid cheddar cheese or solid pepper jack cheese on it. Unfortunately I learned that Umami does not have any solid cheeses. I decided the next best thing to get would be a Parmesan cheese crisp minus bacon lardons. The bun was cute with the U on it. At first I thought the burger quality was good but it just fell apart in my hands and started breaking... My boyfriend said it was because it was too juicy... Not sure but it made it very difficult to eat. I felt bad that I needed to send so many things back... 

Even the diet Pepsi because it tasted flat. So I got iced tea but there was no sugar on the table and it didn't come with a lemon. Our server was sweet but way too busy to check on us enough, perhaps due to poor staffing. There was indoor and outdoor seating. I loved the open layout with couches, our booth was comfortable, there were televisions everywhere for the sports fanatics. 

The sweet potatoe fries were a little too sweet, like they had excess sugar on them. I am a sweet potato fri expert:)

Conclusion is that Umami in my opinion is better than a fast food burger but nothing compared to Hook (located in Woodland Hills). I thought Umami would be very similar in quality compared to Hook. If Umami used a pretzel bun my burger never would have fallen apart. If they used solid cheese and plane jane bacon I think they could accommodate more customer requests. I don't think I have extraordinary tastes when it comes to burgers.",jjHMbNsNYV3sQ13bh4lOCw,0,0,2,fjg6m83e0FlKZSjyuNDRBw

The restaurant always looked busy, including the patio.  Apparently the hotel has new owners and no decisions will be made about anything regarding the hotel/restaurants until the deal is done. If you want to have lunch at the SLS there are now only two options, the pizza place and the cafe, neither of which appeals to me, my wife or our friends.  Guess we will have to find a new favorite hamburger place until such time as the future of Umami is decided.  Just an FYI, we do not go to the Strip on the weekends.  That time is for tourists.

2009859,2018-03-11,0,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"We stayed at the SLS and decided to try Umami after arriving from the airport and checking in. We were extremely tired from a day of traveling (I was practically closing my eyes at the table), and we were super hungry...so a burger sounded great. The restaurant was pretty much quiet and dead, but it was a Sunday night. I think we were one of five tables there. 

We had a coupon from the hotel desk for a free appetizer, and I asked if there were any exclusions, and the waitress was a little snippy. My boyfriend ordered the Truffle Burger (she asked how he wanted it cooked, and he said medium) and I ordered the Greenbird, which is a turkey burger instead of beef. 

My boyfriend took a couple bites into his burger and I could see on his face that something was wrong. This thing was super rare...way more undercooked than he anticipated. We're never ones to really complain about things, but he pointed it out when the waitress came back to check on us. She was kind of rude and seemed oddly confused about it. She just stared at him and said ""well OUR medium HERE is red like that."" He always orders medium, so clearly this place must do things differently, or the burger wasn't cooked long enough in the kitchen. He asked for a replacement burger cooked medium-well so that he'd at least be able to enjoy his $14 burger. When she brought it out, her attitude was a little better and she apologized a few times. Her words were ""sorry guys, that was my fault"" which caught our attention, because we didn't exactly get what THAT meant after all that trouble...

She also noticed my boyfriend's empty water and said ""oh...I'll get you more water"" but never came back for the duration of our meal, except for dropping off the check. (Like I said, it was not busy at all in there). 

My turkey burger was also a little pink, which I didn't expect for poultry...but I honestly scarfed it down in like 2 seconds and was too tired to care. It probably shouldn't have been that pink. The greenbird is definitely a tasty burger though.",ihsEqkghHjSmBRI2-EikiQ,1,0,2,IwCMbhWzt8-q-dqsm-dNGw

The venue is lively and comfortable. It basically also serves as the sports book area. The service is adequate, but misses the target frequently. They may or may not know you've been seated and they may or may not bring you things you've requested. But they are friendly.

We tried their Throwback and Impossible burgers. The portions are good, but feel a little over-priced for what you get. Strip prices basically. The Throwback was fine. The Impossible was a very impressive vegetarian burger that tasted and felt like real meat.

Price to me isn't a huge deal however to me the meal was not that great. The burger had no flavor, the fries were alright.

2276896,2014-12-14,3,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"Well talk about shocked only gets three stars...Or should say not sure why Umami not getting much yelp love except everyone has right too ones opinion. I feel that Umami Burger offer unique experience comes to watching games at a sports book. Trust me use to be one of those sports parley betting addict every weekend. Before realize the house always win. Lol. I can only think of handful of sports book that first off offers food more less quality food not just your normal fried everything bar food. Plus the ones that do offer food usually adjacent or may need to walk some ways get food then bring it back. Not like the sports books are made for food. The chairs made for parley sheet, drink, and sheet write down bets. If in front of small television booth in reality same thing. The thing about Umami literally you just walk up place bet (live betting; that new one for me) and go back too eat, drinking, or talking stories with friends. I came here watch MNF with friends visiting from the 808. I read reviews that need order certain amount on Sunday or on football days in general. Between the three of us ordered everything and the kitchen sink so we were good. We started with truffle fries, nachos, wings, and I had ""The Royale Burger"".

The truffle fries was Amazing! By far the best truffle fries had in long time. I had the ones at more fancy place like Olives that totally suck compare too Umami. The thing that makes them shine above the rest. The homemade truffle cheese that put over the fries, then add truffle oil on top, and nice hot right out of the fryer. Just the smell is divine. If not fungus person this not the dish for you. But if love cheese fries in general these truffle fries take tradition fries too another level. Rich. The Nachos with the short rib meat on top, fresh guacamole (one of the better ones had in town), jalapeño, fresh cilantro sprigs, and the chips. The CHIPS tell fresh chips nice thick corn ones. I could have just eaten chips and salsa whole game be content in life. Me my pet peeves with Nachos like mound of stuff on top but think excess not always better. I love the fact that really had the right amount that none of the chips got completely drowned by the topping that the chips on the bottom bottom still has the crispy crunch. The chicken wings we had six an six. Those were ok nothing really memorable about them. 

The ""Royale"" Burger talk about gourmet burger! This one rivals any of the top gourmet burger joints in Vegas. I can honestly say hit the full list from Gordan, Bobby, Burger Bar, Holstein, Fuku, Bachi, and the only one missing is Guy. The thing I love is the combination of all the flavors. It heavy burger with lots of meat! The burger, short ribs on top, then got truffle cheese, and believe might put hint of truffle oil top it off. Messy burger. Those are the best one that all the good stuff comes out with every bite and gets all over your hands. The ""U"" on top of all the burger that nice touch that definitely  Umami style. The burger buns are on point. Few more reading description that need get me some next visit. 

The service was five star for me!!!! Our server was on it. This was on FOOTBALL day or say MNF. Our server was friendly and during the game on it making sure never empty on our beers. Since first timers all around answered all our questions. 

If one thing that had issue. Maybe only had one hostess working that night. Not sure if we sit ourselves down or go hostess stand get seated no sign. From the outside looks more like lounge then restaurant restaurant. I never checked out the Beer Garden.

Positives:
- Lots of TVs
- Solid Food
- Good service (Wish I remember her name, but we did take care of her on top of the auto gratuity)
- Sportsbook in the restaurant, which was great for mid game betting

Cons:
- Location of the SLS in general. It's a bit off the beaten path
- Umami Burger was fine, but walking into the Casino reminded me of some weird mashup of trendy LA and Fremont street.
- Some interesting characters walking around the casino (and by interesting I mean sketchy as fuck). Security needs to be improved.

When we sat in the restaurant, our server went on break in the middle of our meal and informed me someone else would be over to take care of us. A blonde girl walked by once and asked if we were ok and quickly walked away before we could even answer. We had finished our meal and were waiting for the server to come back over and deliver our bill/check in. In the mean time we went to the bar to gamble and grab a drink and our server still hadn't of come back. Finally I had to walk to the hostess stand and tell her I just wanted to pay since I had finished my meal over 15 minutes previously and wanted to leave. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like I shouldn't have to practically beg someone to come take my money. A server should be eager to get customers out, get a tip, and have that table sat again. From an operational standpoint, a restaurant shouldn't be sending servers on break when they have tables they are responsible for still, and throwing the table onto another unwilling server. The manger Jessica was very apologetic though and comped our food when she realized what had happened. 
The food it's self was pretty good. I recommend the barbacoa nachos and pretzel. The Ice cream sandwich wasn't something I would recommend though. It was Ice cream in between a bun and not something I personally found appealing.",ULlbpCwD5UxKvzzcjgHTiw,0,0,3,dRGxihjd26y0e4xglxOc4A

To the right of that a comfortable area with tables and couches to dine or watch whatever sports game playing. The high ceilings has a black and white checkered pattern. And to the right of that their sports book with a few tables and tvs. But wait there's more. Exit the doors and you'll enter their ""beer garden"" outdoor patio area with lots of seating, ping pong table, and an even bigger bar than inside.

The staff are very friendly and welcoming. They were patient enough to explain the items and what the concept of Umami Burger was each time.  They are supposingly a known business which I've never heard of and they prefer that you don't mess with the chef's creations and have them as is . It seems a like a place to hang out at and have some beers but I wasn't impressed with what I ate.

It was a pork belly brat topped with caramelized kimchi, their korean ketchup, sesame aioli, and green onion for $11. The pork belly brat was sliced like a hotdog bun it was thin and tiny in proportion to the other components.  It was like eating a bun filled with just caramelized kimchi. The caramelized kimchi was kind of nasty tasting for me, maybe too caramelized not sure but I needed lots of water just to finish it.

I don't know if I liked too much. The manly aspect wasn't there unless manly meant tiny. It was like an over sized slider.  I would've preferred the onion strings to be crispy. The U on the bun was nice.

Also had the Truffle Fries. Thin fries with truffle cheese and truffle salt. Didn't like it maybe try the manly fries or something else next time. The fries were cold and were all stuck to each other. 

I've had way better comparable food for the price in Vegas. I was expecting something on the line of Bachi Burger or at least better than 1/2 of the numerous burger places here but got something far far from that. Other than that I like everything else about it the huge misters, decorations, the bar, the many TVs, customer service, the outdoor patio with view of the Strip and people walking or driving along the Strip which is why I didn't give them a 1 star.

While the one in PA had a much more college library type of feel, this location has more of a sports bar type of feel. 

Our server was Tashja. She was super sweet and attentive to our needs. I ordered the throwback burger which had two beef patties, ketchup, pickles, mustard, cheddar cheese, and minced onions along with the FREE truffle fries (make sure you check in on Yelp for this!). To be completely honest, I think the burger I ordered had too much meat portion. But that shouldn't be anything to complain about lol so to make it better maybe some produce like lettuce or tomatoes would make the burger taste even better. Also the burger seemed to have too much bread as  well, so it did seem like a heavy burger. You would think that since the order of truffle fries is free that they would be smaller in portion.

I received even more sweet potato fries (one of the apps we initially got, along with truffle fries and onion rings), which were seasoned just right with brown sugar and salt. The entree was the Hatch Chili Burger, and living around Carlito's Burrito's I love them and this burger! Was well cooked, chilis were well roasted, and the bun on the burger was just firm enough to hold things together, add some texture, but not get in the way.

Not just because of the great hand made food made to order but because when you're located in Vegas, you get sectional couches to relax on and tons of TV screens located throughout this fine location. Oh did I also mention that you can place bets on any sports games there while you eat. 

Umami burger is conveniently located with the beautiful SLS casino at the end of the strip. So because it's a new casino what better way to pull people in then to build one of the best burger joints to eat at. The layout of this place is awesome! The have a bar and bench area that overlooks the strip but puts you right in front of this wall size TV screen. That's almost every mans dream right there, to have huge burgers covered with truffle cheese sauce and a cold beer. 

I will say they also have extra dishes on there menu compared to the California locations. So that was a pleasant surprise. So the first time I was there I ordered there standard truffle burger, (I love truffles) so this burger was packed with flavor and a side of oozing and rich truffle fries. On day two I ordered the 12oz. double patty, caramelized onion infused B.U.B burger. If you're on a diet or squeamish, I suggest you not order this burger. It will keep you set for the rest of the day.

Because they are stretched so thin when I presented my coupon, the waiter said it was one per table and he didn't have time to re-do the check.",LQL4vWWe8wr9TUGhY8Lnsg,0,0,4,ixZh5Y89KxbDd3nSPN-5eQ

Thanks so much to TouchTunes for throwing an awesome party and inviting me to come!

I have eaten at an Umami burger before and liked it and this time, I happened to get a truffle burger as the tray was passing by and it was so delicious.  Sometimes things covered in truffle oil can just be overwhelming and more hype than yum, but this burger was mouth-wateringly fantastic.  I paired it with some of their sweet potato fries which are sweet AND salty and thus, deliciously flavorful - hm.  Umami?  Luckily for us, they also brought out some of their signature ice cream sandwiches and we got to try each.  I liked them, but my first one was the best, chocolate cookie with peanut butter ice cream.  By the end, the cookie parts were getting a little soggy for my taste.  Overall an AMAZING experience and the people working the party and wandering around with trays of tasty treats were so polite and friendly, we really felt like we were at a friend's party.

A few days later, we found ourselves BACK at Umami Burger.  We were looking for somewhere to watch the Nascar race and I remembered that Umami Burger is also connected to the sports book at SLS and is filled with televisions everywhere.  Because it was the March Madness semi finals, I was worried about where to go, but no worries, we were able to get into a booth at Umami and have our private television in the booth tuned to the Nascar race.  Of course, no sound, but at least we were right up close and personal and could see all of the racing action.

Since we'd done burgers and fries, we decided to try some of the other fair offered and the husband ordered buffalo wings and I had the nachos (sans beans).  The nachos come with braised pot roast on them and it's really good.  I enjoyed the nachos very much... only thing that would have made them better would be MORE CHEESE.  Why are people always stingy with the cheese anyway?

We also ordered the pickle plate which is not pickles at all... well, there are a couple of bites of pickles, but it is a plate of a bunch of different pickled veggies, more of a giardiniera with beets, spicy carrots, peppers, etc.  It was tasty! I also actually ordered one of the ice cream sandwiches (the same one I'd like before), but it was surprisingly soggy like the ones I'd had late in the evening at the party, so I thought that was weird, and disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend the ice cream sandwiches due to that.

We milked a good 3 hours at that table and our server was very gracious, but we kept ordering and I dropped a 25% tip to make up for hogging the table.  

Between these two experiences, I definitely recommend Umami burger.  The food is quite tasty and my service experiences were very good.  I'll be back.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,3,2,4,DElyJnZzqVfXqQ1G0DLsGA

The wait for a table was a good 30 min. but this gave us some time to explore the casino.  The friendly staff took our info and we received a text message when our table was ready.  When we arrived, we had the option of indoor and outdoor seating.  We stayed cool inside. 

The atmosphere is loud.  Half the room caters to the sports book where you can order food while catching multiple games on large plasma tvs or sit at the bar and have one of their specialty cocktails.  The music rolls in from the casino so you won't be making much conversation though without raising your voice. 

Our server was very nice and accommodating, explaining the menu and the sauces, and making suggestions for us.  We opted to start with some fries as an appetizer which you can customize.  We had gravy and braised short rib on top.  Delicious.  

We ordered the original umami burger and the truffle especiale. Descriptions on my photos, my wife and I decided the truffle burger was the better of the two.   Other non-beef options like ahi tuna and the green turkey burger will have me coming a second time at least to try those. 

The one hiccup was that my wife had her burger (the original) ordered well, while I like some pink and ordered mine medium. The order came out switched so I had to give up a majority of my yummy truffle burger to her!  We were just too hungry to send it back! :)

Anyways, solid burgers and fries. 4 stars!  Will be back.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,1,1,4,m76lmHnwMZk1GDaY9GTfvQ

But when you travel with people that eat meat there is a certain amount of compromise that must be done.  So there I was at the Umani Burger - went all the way to vegas to eat at a chain, so disappointing.  

Anyway,  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a portabella burger on the menu,  so I order this to share with Buttercup and then we find out that the bun has butter, so our waiter enthusiastically informs us that he can make it a wrap and will take care of us so we order the portabella and sweet potato fries.  

Ok what comes out is the just wrong on so many levels.  it is a grilled mushroom and a couple leaves of lettuce.  no tomato, no onions pickles like nothing.... I ask for tomato or something he leaves and comes back to tell me the tomatoes are not vegan.  Whaaaatttt?  ok so we eat our mushroom and lettuce and them try to fries.  They are covered in sugar and cinnamon. super gross who decided this is a good idea.  So at this point our waiter is avoiding us,  I catch him because he can't avoid the customers around us and request regular fries.  He brings he takes away the desert fries and brings us regular ones.  They could use a little salt, but the table has none,  what every we eat this and wait for our bill.  The bill finally arrives and yes they charged us 12.95 for a portabella mushroom and a couple pieces of lettuce.  Really if the kitchen or our waiter had put any effort at all into making this decent then that would have been one thing but not so much.

The draft beer selection was decent. My friends enjoyed their burger so if you want a burger then it beats McDonalds and they have beer so sure go for it.",zDiIAMAeXH5gz-QReBrwlA,2,2,3,i8DfJ35BqLdbgA-Q1rXAgw

I had the truffle cheese fries. Those were really good but not amazing. A little too much cheese for my states. I ordered the salted caramel ice cream sandwich to finish and that was incredibly good. Simple but packed with flavor. Highly recommend.

It is a unique layout with one very large room with couches and leather chairs underneath massive big tv screens for sports fans. On the perimeter of the big room are booths with individual TVs.

I definitely think it's a good chocked for football and food. I don't know if I would make a special trip just for the food as the menu is a bit small. But either way the burgers are excellent.",f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,0,0,3,lRIXupnp92cJiRzmUoMLWA

While I enjoy a good gormet burger, normally I find myself always going back to The Counter and calling it good because I have yet to find something to top that experience. 

While Umami is indeed really good, I still do not think it takes the title of being top dog. 

We were eating at the SLS and everyone wanted to try a new burger. We sat down in the heavy sports bar feel of umami because there are TV's absolutely everywhere just like a sports book. It took us a forever and a half to get served because of a mix up, but when we actually ordered everything was smooth sailing. 

I shared a truffle burger and some sweet potato fries. I loved the truffle on the burger, the cheese, the patty being cooked just right, and the bun. It was just a little bit small for what I was paying I feel. I got the sweet potato fries because my girlfriend really wanted them. Normally I hate sweet potato fries, but these were not like other's I have had before because they had cinnamon sugar sprinkled on them. This must have been magic pixie dust because it made them go from something I do not enjoy to a plate of fried potatoes that I wish I was no longer splitting with someone else.",p2lzjUMFdYAx77KNVkZSfA,0,0,4,CscW0UXKexz06CEAtkWVSg

2759602,2015-05-21,9,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"What does Umami mean? Since I have never been there I googled it and this was the best answer.

Umami is a basic taste like sweet, sour or bitter. Umami comes from glutamic acid, which is an amino acid - a form of protein. It gives food a ""hearty"" or ""meaty"" taste to it. There are specific taste buds on the tongue to pick up on it. 

So after reading this, it only made me want to go there even more. As luck would have it, the Umami Burger that is located inside of SLS was the designated restaurant for Social Sundays that day. It is an event every sunday where a particular restaurant takes 50 percent off its menu prices. 

So me and two other buddies meet up there around 8:30. I was kind of surprised the place was not that busy given the fact that it was social sunday. Im thinking great service should ge a given.

Since it was my first time, I went with their namesake, the Umami Burger also known as the ""Original"" ($12.00) and an order of Tempura Onion Rings ($5.00). My buddies both got the Sunny Side also known as the ""Truffle Especiale"" ($14). They also opted for Korean Fries ($6.00) and Truffle Fries ($5.50). Note: These prices are what is in the menu so what we paid was half of what you see.

The Umami Burger has parmesan frico, shittake mushroom, roasted tomato, carmelized onions and Umami house ketchup. After the first bite I knew that I had picked the right burger. Definitely lots of flavor. The beef patty was very juicy and from the looks and taste of it, it was cooked medium. This burger might just end up being my usual.

The Tempura Battered Onion Rings had the nice crispiness to it just like how tempura is supposed to be. You can tell that it was cooked fresh and not frozen simply because the onion itself was still semi crispy. They cooked it just right.

The Korean Fries were sweet potato fries topped off with kimchi, scallions, goat cheese, and Korean ketchup. The sweet potato fries by themselves were already good but when you eat one that has the above mentioned toppings on it look out! It had a bit of a kick to it but very tolerable.

The Truffle Fries were shoe string fries smothered with melted truffle cheese. Nice flavor combination of crunch and seasoning of the truffle cheese.

Im glad we shared all three sides because we would of never gotten to taste the variety of each plate. Im assuming that their Maple Bacon Fries were really popular because that was the first thing we wanted to order but our said they ran out of maple syrup.

As for the service, eh, it had great potential when we first got there seeing that the place was not that busy. Our server took our orders and got them to us in a timely manner. Now thats where the service pretty much stopped. We didnt see our server for quite sometime and ended up flagging down another server just so we could get refills on our waters and sodas. One of my friends had already used up most of his napkin to so he asked for another one but never got it.

So overall, the fact that it it was 50 percent off and everything we ordered was delicious, that deserves 5 stars. But the lack of service after receiving our food kind of ruined my experience. So 1 star for bad service and 5 stars for great food which was half off. So there's your ok rating of 3 stars. Im hoping that the bad service was just a fluke and that my next visit will be better. If it is then I will update this accordingly.

I was staying at the W and ate at Cleo the night before, this night I was wanting more of a place to go to the bar and grab a beer, eat, watch sports, and head back. When I got here the bar was already full (good sign people were here) so I got a small table for myself. I kept catching myself looking in all directions at all the different screens there were, there is also a sports book with people betting so that was neat (if only they had a blackjack table in here). 
I ordered the Umami burger because 1) the place is named after it 2) it had a crisp Parmesan cheese 3) shiitake mushrooms. The burger was great. Only disappointment was I think they shorted me on the mushrooms since I only noticed one shiitake mushroom, nonetheless it was a solid burger with soft buns and cool logo burnt on it for a nice appearance. 
I also ordered the Truffle Fries. These were great as there was not an overwhelming taste of truffle and the cheese was good. What really caught my taste buds out of everything was the sauces! ASK FOR THEIR SAUCES. I believe this is one hidden gem of this place. I got their jalepeño ranch, buffalo sauce, diablo sauce, and BBQ. I'm a sauce guy so I was excited when my waitress brought all these out after only asking for ranch and buffalo. The ranch is more of a homemade ranch that they make in house, the buffalo is fantastic if you're a buffalo fan, the diablo is exactly how you imagine it tasting, and the BBQ was a smoky tang flavor. LOVE the sauces.

Lastly I had the cookie with ice cream and it's a perfect dessert in the desert...(good luck to the people who can't read the difference between those) 
A warm cookie oozing the chocolate chips as you fork through it to the perfect scooped vanilla ice cream on the bottom. Not too rich!

We came here for lunch time around 11:30 am, and waited about 30 minutes to be seated which I thought was ridiculous since the restaurant was not crowded at all. My group had 7 people so we were told beforehand that we would be charged addtl. gratuity which usually I don't mind but when we received the bill I saw that we were charged 20% which is ALOT! especially when the server freaking forgot our umami fries even though I checked with her twice that I had put in 2 orders of umami fries. 

I ordered the umami especiale truffle burger, and we also shared the umami fries, fried pickles, and sweet potato fries.  I especially love the ketchup that they have here, it is the only ketchup that I will eat.  The sweet  potato fries and fried pickles weren't particularly worth it, since they only give you 6 spears of pickles for $6 so $1 per pickle wtf. 

Service just took way too long, and it was pretty obvious the staff did not know what they were doing. I wouldn't mind the price for this restaurant if only the burgers were a little bigger.  I usually cannot finish an entire burger but at Umami I always can.

It's a restaurant/sports book, and I wouldn't say one step's on the other one's toes too much. There's something about the food though, it doesn't taste the same as other locations. Granted, I haven't been here since they opened, so maybe I need to see how it is now. I expected this place to be a regular spot I'd frequent, but the first visit just didn't wow me enough to come back. Our server was great, but he actually wasn't a permanent employee here, they were still sorting out staffing at the SLS and one the hotel's departments had workers that were placed here. You could kind of see confusion though with the other servers at other tables. Our burgers, fries and dessert just weren't as good as I remember the SF location being (I even took the day off of work to make the venture into deep SF to indulge)... and it just didn't.. umami. I think anyone who hasn't gone to previous locations though will like this place well enough. The SLS itself is all kinds of blah, so that probably has something to do with my overall aversion to coming back. Vegas has a ton of burger options and this place needs to step it up if it's going to survive (which I really hope it does, Vegas economy doesn't need another hotel closing).",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,4,4,3,dqcUJQBmWMQiY6zV3HGffw

We had a party of 5 of us this past Sunday evening. We had the option of having a table or booth, so we opted for the booth. I was diggin' the layout of the space. It is attached to a William Hill sports book, so there were plenty of TV's around playing football(including in our booth!). You can NEVER go wrong with me by having football on the TV!

The service was outstanding! Our server, Mandy, was both personable and engaging and helped us with recommendations(including my tasty Stella Amber!). Our party ended up trying a little bit of everything. First we ordered appetizers of fried pickles and ""manly"" fries. I didn't partake of the fries pickles, but those fries were delicious! I had the classic burger, while my friends had the B.U.B. and the Truffle burgers. They all ranged in price from $12 to $14 each. The burgers were juicy and tasty. My only complaint would be that they were a bit on the small side.

It wasn't until after we were finished that we walked out to the patio facing the strip and took in the Beer Garden. Looks like a very cool set up and I do look forward to coming back and trying out some more menu items!

This was a pleasant experience and we will certainly be back once things calm down a bit at the SLS...

Umami Burger is basically a poor man's Bachi Burger, or a dressed up overpriced burger where you over pay because it is on the strip.  Combine this with a total lack of competent service, and you're in for a disappointing night.  As to the service, SLS apparently stands for ""Style, Luxury, Service,"" but Umami Burger contorts that to ""Severely Lacking Service.""  If you're local, eat at Bachi Burger before going to the SLS and you'll get a superior burger at better prices.  

While I can appreciate that the restaurant just opened and it may be working out the kinks, the service was incredibly disappointing.  To top it off, a marketer for the restaurant went to the adjacent table to see if they were locals to give them information about local specials.  When we looked at her to catch her eye, she just looked at us, then ignored us, and walked away.  This was pretty much on par with the terrible service we also had from our server who had nothing but attitude and rarely came back to check on the table.  That said, the server was cognizant enough to smile and tell us that she hoped we had a great dining experience when she was dropping off the check.  

Umami Burger, you just lost 8 customers who will never eat at  your establishment again.  From looking at the other reviews, it looks like you will be alienating your future customers.  At least you're consistent.",7cgp0EXG11v-y4F6sDU1hg,2,2,2,tf2xEmb1Cu01l_oWkqF_yg

Glad to see there are veggie appetizers, ahi tuna burger and vegan burger. That's all I can have on the menu. The Belgian draft beer I tried was pretty good, very tasty and strong. Had a glass Stella for second one, couldn't finish it, poured it in a plastic cup and took it back to our suite. 

Appetizers: House pickled veggies, Thin fries. 

The assorted pickled veggies were delicious, sour and salty, great hangover snack. They provided three dipping sauces for fries, the yellow jalapeño sauce was extremely spicy, loved it. 

Burgers: Umami burger in medium rare and Vegan burger. 

Hubby liked his burger alright, he said it was tasty but nothing spectacular for being their so-called signature burger. My sloppy mami was really""sloppy"", it was open faced and impossible to hold, also hard to take a bite, the stuffings made the buns so mushy, tasted nasty, but the stuffings were very delicious, liked the onion strings so much. 

Food was good but not great, portions were huge, our waitress was friendly and fairly attentive. 

This place is great for watching sports on the leather couches in the mid section, a few enormous flat screen TVs hanging up high right in front of those seatings, those are for reservations only. A great way to kill some time in the afternoon hanging around here.

noun
a category of taste in food (besides sweet, sour, salt, and bitter), corresponding to the flavor of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate. ???

I wasn't sure what Umami meant, so my assumption was that this was going to be an Asian fusion burger. Nope, this is just a straight up burger with truffle oil randomly thrown in the mix. C'mon, you were thinking the same thing when you heard the name, ""Umami Burger"". 

I came here with some friends and we started this meal off with a cornucopia of deep fried, carb loaded appetizers, Mmm Mmm my favorite. First up, the ""Smushed Potatoes"" these were ok, but a tad flavorless. They look like a mini-baked potato and be careful when eating, I tried putting a whole one in my mouth and nearly lit my tongue on fire. These little pockets of heat are best cut in half and dipped in Umami house ketchup, which I liked a lot. It's ketchup, but with a mix of truffle oil and something spicy. We also ordered sweet potato fries and tempura fried onion rings. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfect, crispy and soft and the tempura coating on the onions was light, flaky and not too heavy. Overall, deep fried goodness. 

On to the star of the show. I ordered the Truffle Burger, the hat trick of truffle oil infused beefy eats. This burger has; truffle aioli, truffle cheese, and coated in a truffle glaze. This burger was super juicy and full of flavor and honestly didn't need any sauce assistance, but I still dipped it once or twice in a mixture called, ""Diablo Sauce""? Plus the bun was super soft, like dissolving in your mouth soft. Cute side note, they adorn each bum with the letter, ""U"" which in the words of Ralph Wiggum stands for, ""Umm-believable"". After the burger entered the equation I completely forgot about the side dishes and went full carnivore. 

To finalize the meal, like any good eater, we ordered and shared a dessert. This was an Ice Cream Sandwich. A snicker-doodle cookie with caramel ice cream filing. Sooooo good, a must order! 

- Was this the best burger I ever had? Nope. 
- Was it tasty and satisfied me? Yes
- Would I come back? Maybe. Every once in a while. 

Umami is good, but the prices are a little high for a burger place, but If you haven't been here yet it's definitely worth a try if you're any kind of burger loving American.

When we went on a Thursday around 10pm, there was no wait and only a few parties seated. Our server Charlie was awesome! Super friendly, had a great upbeat attitude and made sure we were well taken care of.
Onto the food! I've never tried Umami Burger so I was surprised when they brought out four complimentary sauces: umami ketchup, jalapeno ranch, spicy diablo, and garlic aioli. All of them had great flavor and consistency. 
We also ordered the smother 'em fries, shoestring fries with shortrib and gravy and they were delicious! I  couldn't stop eating them with all the sauces and I usually never finish fries.
To the main event! We both ordered The Royale medium rare, topped with short rib, truffle aioli, and truffle cheese. The truffle flavor was definitely there, but less than the Fungi Burger from Holsteins and I was surprised at the amount of short rib on it, it had a nice thick layer. At first glance though when they brought it, it looked kind of small but it was the perfect amount because of how thick and meaty it was! The only thing I didn't like was the bun. I'm a big fan of brioche buns and judging from the look I thought it was but when I took a bite it was kind of dry and tasted like basic white toast haha and also the bottom half got pretty soggy. Blehh it would've been perfect!
Dessert time! I forgot to take pictures of the ice cream sandwiches but I liked the regular vanilla and chocolate chip cookie combo the best. The mint and double chocolate combo was a little too fresh and minty for me, like eating mouthwash lol and the peanut butter was alright, maybe if I was more a fan of peanut butter desserts I'd like it. I'll save my ice cream cookie sandwich craving for Sweet Addictions next time.

First, customer service was terrible. For a very slow night out waitress's only came to our table once to refill our glasses (which were empty for 20 mins). The restaurant only had 5 tables occupied & a couple people at the bar. Not only was my boyfriend & I waiting for our glasses to be filled, but also the table across from us. Before we got our food, I noticed my knife pretty dirty. It seemed like there was still food residue on it. I asked our waitress if I can have another knife, & she came 10 mins after we got our food to give me the knife. Which was useless.

Second, the food came at a good time, we didn't wait too long. The burger I got was the sunny side burger, which had the egg in it. I enjoyed my burger very much. The meat was juicy & not too much crap in it; just the greens, cheese, patty, & the egg. My boyfriend got the regular burger & his was just plain bland. We even put a onion ring just to have some type of crunch or flavor, but nothing. On the sides we had onion rings which were pretty good with their homemade ketchup.

You have to park in the SLS parking structure and then walk into the casino. Umami Burger is on the opposite side of the casino floor. No worries though, because SLS is very small so its not a long walk at all. 

When my friend and I first arrived, we were really confused. There were two lines, roped off but no host. So we went inside a bit, no one said anything to us, and walked back out to the host stand and was about to walk to the other entrance when the host finally came. I wouldn't have known she was the host because she didn't have a uniform, I just saw her ear piece and was like... maybe she'll help us. She didn't say anything to us, and I had to tell her seating for two people. Even when she led us to a booth, and set down our menus, she still didn't say anything. 

Our server wasn't too friendly, but he was attentive. I added lettuce, tomatoes (which he told me were grilled), and onions to my truffle burger. I wanted to order the truffle fries but was afraid it would be too much truffle so settled on the garlic parmesan fries. My fried ordered the ahi burger and sweet potato fries. 

Our food came out in a good amount of time. My friend said she could SMELL the truffle when it was brought out. Maybe my taste buds suck or something, the truffle burger had truffle cheese and a truffle aioli but i didn't really get that much of a truffle taste. The burger patty itself was very juicy, and cooked medium, just the way I like it! One of the RARE occasions where I actually get my meat cooked how I want it! I like my fries to be... not so skinny. So I didn't enjoy the fries very much, but they were crispy. The pieces of shredded parmesan was just sad. At least melt the cheese or use a different type of parmesan. A lot of the parmesan fell off as I was trying to grab the fries. 

Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our meal. It was interesting to watch all the different sports on the many many TV screens that they had. Apparently, you can bet at the bar and watch whatever sport they have on the big screen. Trust me, the screen spans the entire wall. They had baseball on as well as football and boxing. 

Don't expect to come here for a nice date night. Because of all the sports, it can and WILL get very loud! On the way out, we walked right past the host who just stared at us. I was watching the way that she seated other parties (without a smile), and wanted to see if she would thank us for coming in or at least say goodbye. Nope. 

SLS is a pretty confusing drive from Henderson, our GPS took us in a weird route. I may be back but not anytime soon.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,0,0,3,j8lhRFeGKb10TKWe_VwJMQ

They did not have a vegan or veggie patty, and to top it off, what they did have was a sloppy joe type or sandwich that was open. The menu stated ""vegan mix"" with lentils, tomatoes, and cheddar jalapeños and some other stuff. That's not vegan. Maybe the chef needs a refresher. Then I got my food it and it  had a creamy sauce on top, again, why does your ""vegan choice"" say vegan when there is dairy in it. I didn't want to complain because I was out on a birthday lunch, the environment was great. U can eat on the couch and watch sports, or sit at the bar. Service was ok.

I sat inside near the bar on my first visit. Their alcoholic beverage menu had more items than the food menu. The first burger I tried during my first visit was the Throwback burger with two beef patties, white cheddar cheese, miso mustard, Umami house ketchup, soy pickles, and minced onions. I also had sweet potato fries on the side. Let me tell you, I was amazed with the Throwback burger that I literally wanted to order another one, but I was too full. It was juicy, not too salty, and a tad bit tangy. The sweet potato fries tasted more like cinnamon, which I did not mind.

My second visit to Umami was on the second day of my stay at the SLS. This time around, I asked for outdoor seating since I was in a group with five other people. I ordered the Truffle burger with truffled aioli, house truffle cheese and truffle glaze and a side of truffle fries. Out. Of. This. World.

My last visit was on the fourth day, in which I ordered the Sunny Side with parmesan frico, fried egg, some butter, a hefty amount of arugula, and truffled aioli as well as a side of sweet potato fries. The Sunny Side burger wasn't the greatest for me. It tasted more like an arugula salad than a burger. The sweet potato fries were great anyway.

The service at Umami in the SLS Las Vegas was outstanding. I even used the complimentary ice cream sandwich coupon from the coupon book that held my room key and tried the Peanut Butter Double Chocolate ice cream sandwich. Sweet and salty amazingness.

I'm just so glad that there are two Umami Burger restaurants in San Francisco. I just checked their menu and there is a wider variety than the menu at the SLS. Score!",ZcwoWOND2-5h0J3zGpD39g,2,1,4,u-3_yj6ahhpfM0_nZxqZ8A

My wife ordered a pretzel to get started - YES!  A giant, yummy pretzel showed up with two dipping sauces (a cup of dark mustard and a cup of melted cheese.)  Loved it.

I ordered a turkey burger with sweet potato fries for lunch. Oh my, it was delicious - all of it!

The burger was not giant, but sized appropriately for a normal human being.  It was beautifully presented and tasted delicious.

3167831,2014-08-24,3,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"I've had the original Umami location in LA bookmarked for the longest time, and for whatever reason, we've just never had time to make it there when we're in town. So, when we booked our room for SLS, we knew Umami was definitely going to be one of our meals!

This location inside the SLS is quite large. Not only is it a full service restaurant, but it's also houses the casinos sports book and a beer garden. There's quite a bit of seating throughout the location, but the way it's set up is weird and there seems to be no real uniformity. Alongside seating at the indoor bar, there's small tables, high-tops, and couches for the sports book. Then when you walk outside, you've got more picnic table style seating, and another fairly large bar that's got to be a good 50+ feet long. There's just a lot going on and depending on where you sit, you may not be able to order food or just sit down to enjoy a drink while watching the games. If you are coming strictly for the food though, they do offer text notifications so you can go gamble or do whatever while waiting for a table.

Looking online, it seems like the menu is pretty much the same as at other locations, and there's a good amount of options too. If you're not feeling a burger, they have salads, ""Un-Beef"" sandwiches and even sausages. The sides are pretty typical for a burger joint and the fries can be customized in a handful of ways. There's 8 burgers to choose from and this Umami is no different from the others as their infamous no substitution rule is in full-effect. Although, they will let you request a different cooking temperature for the meat. Standard cooking temp is medium rare, just so ya know.

We decided on an order of fried pickles to share, and I opted for the Truffle Especiale burger. Oddly enough, after receiving the order, our waitress told us that she wasn't a huge fan of the fried pickles. I couldn't disagree with her more as they were definitely some of the better I've had. The batter was thick, crunchy, flavorful and stuck to the pickle completely. It never fell apart and I liked that the pickle inside wasn't so hot that you couldn't eat it. Adding to the flavor was a nice side of jalapeno ranch that was creamy with just a touch of heat.

Although a bit on the small side, my burger was equally impressive. If you're a fan of truffle, Umami does not disappoint! Topped with both truffle butter and truffle arugula, the flavor is immediately present without being overpowering. The arugula still had a nice crisp texture to it, and it coupled perfectly with the fried egg. Now, these guys are proud of their beef too...and rightfully so! The meat isn't smashed down like meatloaf and on it's own has hints of both sweet and salty flavors. It was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. 

With all the commotion going around on their first day, I admittedly expected less than stellar service. That was far from the case and I thought the service was excellent. Apart from her expressing her hatred for the fried pickles, after we ordered them, our waitress was extremely friendly and even a little funny too. I appreciate that she knew the menu well and didn't hesitate to answer a single question. And not only was she on her game, but other servers were checking on us and every other table to make sure drinks were full, etc. The team work and overall ambience was just great!

For a burger joint, the overall prices aren't horrible, but they aren't great either. My burger was $14 and even though I think this was more of a casino thing, I was pretty irritated about paying $5 for a soda. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a side, our bill was $55 with tip. I'm also not a huge fan of having all that stuff packed into one location.

Staying in SLS/W and upon checking in around 11pm , definitely needed lunch! 

Umami is a sportsbook as well, so it was pretty lively on Sunday at 12pm with plenty of people in gear rooting for their team.

1. Ambiance is lively. There are hightops, tables, booths with personal TVs, bar with games, AND comfy coaches in front of HUGE screens. 5/5

2. Drinks are good. Upon checking in we redeemed free 16 red rock beers. The other option is free fries. I purchased two additional ones at $7 each with an additional whisky shot $5 each. They have many size options available to accommodate all sizes of thirsty. 5/5

3. Food was AMAZING! My date had the manly burger. He is quite a big guy himself but was full for hours after.  I did not taste it, but he raved about richness and amazing taste.  I had the ahi tuna seared burger. WOW! This was so delicious,  a must try! I had lettuce and tomato added.  I really like that it was a full leaf, not shredded.  We added some tasty wings and truffle fries , so delicious! 5/5

4. Service is solid here. We were welcomed immediately and sat without wait. After our server took orders, another waitress brought waters and place settings.  Despite it being a packed house , service never lagged! We were never left empty handed and they took all empty plates and cups during our meal. Perfect!

If you like onion rings, theirs is A MUST! Perfectly battered and crunchy, I fell in love.
We ordered the buffalo wings as a starter, they were nothing to write home about. Just your generic wings, really, which was a bit disappointing.

The atmosphere is more of a sports bar with couches, very laid back. Perfect for MNF! 
I was really shocked to see that the menu was so tiny. What threw me off guard was the fact that it's a beer garden and they had Bud Light and Stella on tap...it needs a much wider selection!
We had the Pulled Pork nachos:
the flavor of the meat was great, the presentation wasn't there and besides the massive layer of meat on top it was just cheese sauce and cold chips.
Turkey Burger: I ate half and pushed it to the side. The green sauce they put on the burger wasn't good at all. Burger itself was flavorless and the bun was so soggy that I had to eat the bits I did have with a fork and knife.
Manly Burger: this was probably the best thing at our table. Full flavor and was gone in under 5 minutes haha
Truffle Fries: the cheese sauce had alittle hardening look to it. It was definitely sitting in the window waiting on the rest of the ticket. It had the consistency of almost hard wax. The sauce was only on the top part and they sprinkled some green onions on top and called it a dish.
The truffle salt was good but besides that we couldn't eat them.

3265047,2014-09-28,0,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"Went to Umami for dinner. There were 3 of us, no alcohol, and the tab was $74 without tip just to give you an idea of the prices. Burgers are about $12, but do not come with any sides. I think that's the new trend following the lead of the pricey steakhouses. Everything is a la carte, so what you think is a $12 burger actually becomes a $15 - $20 burger once you add some fries or another side. 
I had the Manly burger with American cheese and bacon. The bacon chunks were tasty, crispy on the outside and chewy inside - just right. I was hesitant on trying this place because of the negative reviews. My burger was very tasty, meat cooked right, and overall and above average burger. My wife had the Original and she loved the Parmesan frigo on it. Her cousin had the Truffle Especiale.  He loves the fried runny egg on the burger. I should have added a fried egg on my Manly burger. That would have been awesome. I have an issue with them charging $5 for a soda. I don't even know if the soda is bottomless because they only serve bottles. A Pepsi is $5, really?  Desert is an average size cookie sandwich for $7. It was OK. We tried the salted caramel ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. 
Ambience - a sports bar with booths around the perimeter, and tables in the middle. Each booth had a small TV, but you can't control what is on your booth TV. That really doesn't make sense with all of the channels they have available. We wanted to watch a different game. The waiter made up some story that the ""guy"" with the remote was walking around and would change the channel to whatever channel we wanted. We never saw the ""guy"" with the remote. The people ranged in age and style from club goers having a bite to eat before hitting the club to an elderly group grabbing some burgers. There were some couples there as well. The middle of the floor has a living room type setup with large screen TVs and leather couches around some coffee tables. You can sit there and have a beer and burger, and bend down to eat over the coffee table like you do in your own living room. My wife didn't get it why there were a bunch of guys using the couches to eat. Gives you the opportunity to stand up and walk around if the game is stressing you out. 
Service - sub par. I think it was just our waiter. Everything was soooo slow with him. He spent 90% of his time standing in the kitchen. I could see his bald head through the window of the kitchen door while waiting for water, to order something, desert, the check, etc. I actually gave the lowest tip I have in a long time (15%). I usually give 20% without question, but wanted to make a point. Hopefully, he gets it. He was a very nice guy, just very frustrating to have to wait for him every time we needed something. Waiter, try walking around to your tables more and ask people how they are doing. Make yourself available. The restaurant is charging premium prices for burgers. The service should match. This isn't McDonalds. Charge me McDonalds prices and I will happily get my own napkins and ketchup. 

Summary - get the burger of your liking and one order of thin fries to share between 2-3 people. Burgers are good if you get them medium. Drink water or a beer (somewhat overpriced at $8 for domestic). All sodas aren't worth the price.  Skip the apps. The fried pickles ($6) taste like Vlasic yellow pickles with some breading that falls right off on the first bite. They were overly sour, and not like good deli pickles.  Skip desert as well. If you must have, split one cookie between two people.",Mf_-HfdZbCUxO7-ObpiZaQ,1,0,3,1NR6K0CI0PMBDO_55A-VBA

A lot my review is based off a comparison of this location to the ones in Laguna Beach and The Grove in Southern California. If you've never been to a Umami before, its definitely worth checking out even here at the SLS. 

Umami serves up some pretty good gourmet burgers and fries. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, and you can taste the quality in the toppings. The stamped buns are almost begging you take a picture and Instagram it. Plenty of sides and entree options means there is something for everyone. While the food is fine I take issue with the dining experience itself.
 
Each time I have dined here the restaurant has been virtually empty, but somehow there is always a 10-15 minute wait to be seated in a barren dinning room. The outdoor patio huge and overlooks the north end of the strip. The free ping-pong, air hockey and foosball tables are a nice touch and a good distraction while waiting on your food. Unfortunately, the massive size of the patio makes for just an awkward dining space. Rarely is anyone at the bar or eating out there and the backless wooden benches make for an uncomfortable dining tables.They merged the main dining room with the ""sports book"" and its a mess. Random people walking in and out making bets and standing around creates a weird dining atmosphere. Service has always been slow and disappointing. Its sad that this locations gives so many first timer Unami eaters a bad first impression of the franchise.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,4,1,2,6seIhDspGvzuwJXmXuFj5A

What is Umami up against? Fukuburger, Badger cafe, Burger Bar at Mandalay. These are all great burgers and all cost less. We ordered the ""Manly Burger"" and an order of fried pickles. S O asked for regular ranch instead of jalapeño ranch for the fried pickles. Waitress said ""we don't have regular ranch"". Ok, kinda odd at a multi million dollar new casino trying to impress but we carried on. The burger arrived and it was tiny! This is a freaking slider folks. The nerve of calling it ""The Manly Burger""! Before I took my first bite I thought to myself for $14 this better be awesome for this price. It wasn't :( It was average at best. The fried pickles barely had any batter on them and tasted like warm soggy pickles. I got 5 pickle spears for $6! Come on guys, really? I have no problem paying high strip prices for a premium product (I.E. anything at the Wynn) but you gotta deliver a premium product. The waitress noticed we didn't eat the pickles and did take them off the bill. 

Atmosphere was ok and the service was good. I just can't figure out why people would pay these prices for micro servings that aren't amazing. 

General lesson for SLS and any other new business. You can't charge ultra premium prices and not deliver 5 star food and service. I have now eaten at Cleo, Umami and The Griddle and I wouldn't recommend them to anybody for now. As a long time local I want The SLS to succeed. We need jobs and great showcase properties.

The reason I came is not there, disappointed I don't wanna feel like I wasted my time so I order their truffle burger and simple fries. Didn't take as long as I thought it would.

The patty was thick though undercooked (I like my steaks rare-med. rare but when it comes to burger I prefer medium+ normally.) I didn't mind that too much. Sadly the burger was overall disappointing. The meat was way too under seasoned and they amount of truffle  aioli they put on the burger was sad. I didn't even taste it. There was some on the plate and I tasted it and it was good. Shame they didn't put enough on the burger itself to lend any flavor what so ever. Patty, a slice of melted cheese and a thin squiggle of truffle aioli is all I got. No other toppings that could have helped impart the burger with some flavor. 

The fries came out cold. They are super thin and while crispy seemed overlooked and hollow.

Overall my experience was very ""meh."" Definitely over priced for what you get. I didn't taste quality, poorly seasoned beef led me to tasting not much of anything to be honest.

The place was obviously packed but we still managed to snag a booth. They had several servers walking around handing out free samples. Great for customers, but awful for the servers as many people probably didn't order food or tip well since there were plenty of freebies all night. I tried the skinny fries and sweet potato fries, both were tasty and crispy. I also tried slider version of their truffle burger and hatch burger -- the patties on both juicy and cooked to about medium. The former only had subtle amounts of truffle in the aioli, cheese, and glaze, while the latter had just enough heat to enhance the flavor. 

As for the food we ordered, the Korean fries had a mild kimchi flavor paired with sweet potato fries while the chicken wings had to be sent back because they only gave us five instead of the advertised six. They corrected the mistake and  sent out a correct order. Each coated with a crispy exterior coated in a spicy BBQ sauce. The lone full size burger sampled was the Manly burger ($12). A bit small but filling with a densely packed patty topped with house beer-cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked salt onion strings, ketchup and mustard. The branded bun was a nice touch.

The quality and variety of burgers and appetizers lags behind the top burger joints in town, but it was a cool spot to watch the game thanks to the in house sporting book, large TVs scattered around the room and the smaller TV right at our booth.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,8,3,4unstfkg2eFln7CPGvBpuQ

The disappointment on the servers face was evident because we didn't order alcohol.  My sister ordered coffee with cream and sugar.  No biggie we thought.  Drinks were delivered and food order was taken but no cream or sugar for the coffee or lemon for the water as requested.  I went to go ask an employee to send over a manager as we still didn't have cream or sugar after 10 minutes for the coffee.  Our server never came to the table to tell us there was an issue with the cream or sugar.  Apparently the manager had to go across the whole casino to retrieve cream and sugar (WTF???).  My sister didn't receive her cream or sugar until 2:35 with no explanation or apology from the server or management.  I had to get up from the table again to ask another employee for lemons as our server forgot!  
Food was delivered in a very tacky way.  The food runner came to the table and auctioned off the Food.  Apparently Umami doesn't have position points so the runners don't know which guest gets which item.  So the runner stays in one position at the table and delivers the food expecting us to grab the plates instead of moving to the other side of the table and put the plate down.  Very tacky to stand in one area and attempt to deliver to 5 different people.  Most decent restaurants have the runners walk around the table and deliver to each customer.  I asked the runner for more napkins as we only had 1 each. The manager finally came around and wasn't really empathetic at all and didn't really seem to care that we received horrible service.  I told her that I am a local and work in the hospitality business.  I had to ask another employee again for napkins as they we're forgotten. The food was extremely average for vegas standards.  We were done eating and it took at least another 10 minutes for someone to come around, I asked for the bill.  The employees didn't start pre-budding the table until the bill was brought.  Normally pre-bussing is a given when everyone is obviously done and stacks empty plates on the table.  I guess Umami does it differently than every single restaurant I have worked in for 15 years on the strip.  By the way the manager never came back to ask about the food or say anything to us.  I felt bad about leaving a very crappy tip but we did receive the worst service I have ever had in Las Vegas.  I like the SLS but Umami sucks.

This was the first place I found to eat when my husband and I got to Vegas and I was starving!  Issue one was it was $12 for just a burger, and fries or any other side that would normally come with the burger at any other place was a seperate cost. It took forever for the food to get to the table and when it did my burger was missing the Portobello mushroom.  It took me several mins to find anyone who noticed me to tell them about the mistake and by that time my husband had finished his burger. When i showed them about the mistake they pointed out two tiny black chunks and said that was the Portobello and it just comes with one mushroom... this was highly insulting so I explained i wasn't going to pay $12 for a burger that didn't come as ordered so she went in the back and brought out 2 Portobello mushrooms. The burgers them selves are nothing to write home about, honestly I could get a better burger at red robins or fuddruckers and pay less. Due to the issue the waitress comped our drinks which was really nice.",ROD3gbpf96ZLXdOKb7aMLg,0,0,1,83NtdU7ksW7nLLHk2bhI2A

The menu is small, and all of the burgers sound delicious.  I got the Classic, but when it arrived, I was surprised at the size of the burger (read: small).  Having been to Bachi Burger and Burger Bar and even Yard House, for the $12 price tag of the Umami Burger, I was expecting a nice, huge, messy burger.  But it was about the size of a McDonald's double cheeseburger.  Worse, my burger was dry and flavorless.  My husband got a burger with beer cheese, bacon, and all sorts of stuff on it, and that one in contrast did have a lot of flavor.

And then came the fries.  When you order ""smothered fries"" you expect them to be SMOTHERED.  What we got was a little bit of gravy in the middle of the bowl and dry short rib on top of that.  I mean...put the gravy on top of the short rib to keep it moist.  It was hardly smothered in anything.

Things I did love: the patio has great misters and a great environment, our waitress was wonderful and perky and attentive, and the jalapeno ranch.  Oh damn that jalapeno ranch is good.

One last note.  I ended up getting a tequila based cocktail for $13 (yes, that's right, the cocktail was more expensive than the burger).  When we went next door to The Sayers Club, the EXACT SAME cocktail was $18.  As a whole, I think the SLS hotel has the most expensive drinks on The Strip, and I was shocked at the mark up from one restaurant to the lounge just next door.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,0,0,3,2GwaYLzWfo0-r4pTMD1-uA

I think the GPS inside CC is kinda off... but anyways, we trekked our way to SLS to eat some burgers. If you enter through the Las Vegas Blvd entrance, just walk to your left and you'll see Umami quickly.

Got our seats and table quickly and our server came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Water please! And he left us to go get us water while we looked at the menu. 

I ended up getting the manly burger:
manly $12.95 
House beer-cheddar, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami house ketchup, mustard spread.

and they also have a Yelp Check in offer, of free fries or a draft beer if I recall correctly, as we opted for the fries.

The server came by regularly to refill our water, but all our attentions were to the many TVs that lined the Umami ""walls"" (they're not really walls, as you can still see and feel casino of SLS outside). They even have a personal TV for each table. However, I do not know if you can change the channel of the TV next to you.

Manly burger- Onion strings. After taking a few pictures and enjoying the mix of bacon on medium meat, along with the addition of ketchup and the mustard, you feel manlier. Just kidding. It's mostly because of the bacon and onion strings, along with the flavor you get with everything else that makes it come at ya ;) Tasty but I don't know.. $12.95? :/ 

Their truffle fries were heavy but amazing. It did not make me sick like the ones in the Irvine Spectrum did. It's a good amount for two people to share (so make sure you don't get too many if you have the Yelp check in offer).

Service is attentive. Even with the college football game of the week going on, the server came to us and asked if we had everything, if we needed anything else, etc.

I ordered the Truffle Burger Royal (the one with the egg on top), the sweet potato fries, and the pickle platter.  Everything was just the right size, not too small, and not too large where you feel like death afterwords.  The fries were a little cold, but delicious. Really delicious.  Plus the temperature was totally forgivable, given the fact that I was able to enjoy them in the privacy of my hotel room.

I found the burger to be something truly special, and would order it over, and over again if I could.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the egg was perfectly runny, and the compilation of ingredients was quite spectacular.

The only reason I can't give Umami Burger 5 stars, is because much like other people, I found the ketchup to be pretty gross.  I don't understand the reason for that exact recipe, or consistency, but I felt like it actually took away from the meal, rather than added to it.

What I missed was my idea of a burger:. Something I can hold in my hands and get a great burger taste, maybe with cheese.  What I got at Unami was almost a burger and a bunch of ingredients that didn't help the meat even t though they were good.  The burger itself was not hand made and I think that it did not have enough air in the ground meat which led to a tougher bite.

First, I like the design overall because it combines a little of everything. It is right off the casino floor, there's a two-sided bar with gaming machines, a neat dining room, a place to make sports wagers and a huge outdoor bar and patio. 

Honestly, this is not your ""traditional sports book"" and is basically a window to make bets adjacent to the restaurant. They have a handful of high top tables reserved exclusively for sports book patrons, but I much preferred sitting elsewhere where you receive bar or table service.

A new manager named Drea took a ton of time to answer my questions one night, so I planned a return for the Sunday Night Football game and a bartender named Natalia also provided exceptional service and conversation. 

There were a couple beers on good specials for the game and they went well with my Manly Burger, which was cooked perfect and served quickly. This burger featured a really high quality meat and I enjoyed how all the toppings complimented the meat, but did not dominate the overall flavor of each bite. 

Others here on Yelp seem to question the size of the burgers for the price, but I do not. Sure, I can find a bigger burger at a better price somewhere else, but couldn't that be said about virtually any food/restaurant if you really think about it?

This would also be a fun place with a small group if you can get one of the couches surrounding a coffee table that is set up like a living room in front of the televisions. The outdoor patio is another good option with how they set up the tables and the bar outside is very long with plenty of additonal seating. 

Oh, and it is significantly louder inside than outside. So pick your noise level accordingly.

On a lighthearted note, way too many servers and bartenders were wearing Seahawks jerseys. I'm just guessing most of these were purchased within the last year unless Umami Burger imported 25% of their employees from the state of Washington.

I was surprised to find they do not carry a regular ranch dressing. Who doesn't carry such a basic condiment? The other two ranch flavors were not up to par for me.

I had looked at the menu online and I knew what I'd order before I got there.  It sounds like I had truffle mania but actually there was little truffle taste in anything that had the name truffle attached to it.

I ordered the Sunny Side burger which is also known as the truffle especiale.  The menu describes it having parmesan frico, fried egg, truffle butter,and truffled arugula.  Along with this, I ordered the truffle fries described as thin cut fries with truffle cheese.

I ordered my burger rare and that's just the way it was served.  That was great!  The burger was large.  I didn't eat the top bun with its U brand for the company.  The burger was good.  I ate it with knife and fork rather than the pick up and slop over myself.  The fries were OK.  They were limp which I gather is the way Umami always serves them.  They were like an 80 year old who hadn't taken his Viagra.  I also had a black iced tea--known as gun powder tea--that was refilled without needing to ask.

My server was Courtney and she was TERRIFIC!  She was pleasant, knowledgable, and good at her job!

I'm glad this place was the Social Sunday place.  It was not a $25 meal but for the $12.70 price, it was OK.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,12,3,56whKv_lmi_2K2NCf2R_4g

This place is a small burger joint that is directly in the tiny sportsbook, so you get to listen to the blaring sports games over the loudsystem while you to try and converse. The menu sucks. Maybe 10 items on the menu, and very limited toppings for burgers. Also, the burgers don't come with fries, everything is a la carte.

We were given the option on sitting inside or outside and our hostess recommended that we sit outside since they had multiple televisions. We were seated very quickly. It took about maybe 10 minutes for them to ask what we would even like to drink, it wasn't even crowded either. Unacceptable. Took about another 10 minutes to actually get the waters and order our food. So all in all it took 20 minutes to place our order, crazy.

We both ordered the royale burger and my friend got the sweet potato fries while I got the truffle fries. The food was brought out in a timely manner, surprisingly! They bring out 3 different selection of sauces that were phenomenal. The royale burger was pretty tasty but I do like the truffle burger a little better. The truffle fries never disappoint and the sweet potato fries were good, but nothing mind blowing.

4053161,2014-12-16,1,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"This is not my first time at Umami, but this was my first time at this location. My first Umami experience was at The Camp in the OC.  I wasn't impressed with the service, the wait, and my burger at the OC location. At the time, I thought Umami was just over-hyped.  After my experience at this location, I'm convinced...I know Umami is over-hyped.  

Let's start with service. We arrived around 1:40 PM on a busy football Sunday.  We were fortunate to get seated right away.  Our orders were taken fairly quick and our waitress was attentive. The service and the wait at this location is 10 times better than the location in Orange County.  I just think we got lucky and had a good waitress.  The guests seating directly behind us weren't so fortunate. I noticed that no one was attending to them. After about 10 minutes, they left.  

This Umami was packed with enough TV screens that there's no chance of missing any football action.  There's even a sports book right inside Umami.  If you're a fan of William Hill's Sports Betting, then you'll love the ambiance here.  I didn't place any bets because most of the afternoon football action was already closed.  Good for me. That also means I didn't lose a cent.  

I thought that the food was less than average. We started out with their Smothered Fries, which is their thin fries covered with braised short ribs.  This wasn't bad, the burger on the other hand, was. If you've been to Umami, then you know that their burgers look better than they taste.  First of all, Umami uses a thick or high bun.  The bun alone is about 4 inches high. I think this is done intentionally to compensate for a weak burger patty.  I got the B.U.B, which is supposed to be 12 oz.  For a 12 oz burger, it was small, exceedingly greasy, and lacked taste.  The burger is so greasy and the bun so soggy from the grease that you're almost forced to eat your burger quick.  Otherwise, your burger will turn into an open face burger.  Yes, it gets all over the place. I wasn't impressed with Umami. I wasn't impressed at all.  Overall, I was disappointed with the food at Umami's.  The only reason this Umami gets 3 stars from me is because of their sports book and game day TV screens.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,4,3,Xy6wvtrs7i3OHsmZsUycfg

To a point where I just went with the namesake burger, to get just anything to eat.. Fairly uninspired as a stand alone restaurant concept - just great as a sports book cafe. 

We had a giant pretzel and chicken fingers to share and sweet potato fries and an Umami Burger. Heading to a show at The Foundry, we wanted quick and tasty. As I mentioned before, the food was fine. I just. don't see a lot of reason to ever go back just to eat .. We sat in the beer garden that is along Las Vegas Blvd and even still it was just whatevs. 

The the pretzel was a large pretzel smeared with mustard. The chicken fingers didn't look worthy of Costco (who have very good chicken fingers available, btw:) the Umami burger was my favorite and it was still pretty basic. The Parmesan tuile was a nice touch - but the single shitake mushroom and single roasted tomato - makes for a ""pretty"" burger (see photo) but a semi boring burger.

I'm still mad about the chicken fingers tho. If they were made in house, which I highly doubt, they were made terribly. I honestly hope they weren't made in house ... So that drops it to 2.5 from a solid 3 stars. Not trying to be mean, they were just not good. Everyone was hungry and one was left uneaten. I couldn't do it so I left mine there. Cuz it sucked. Lol.

I opted for a booth but had great views of the entire place for decent people watching. I started off with a cold green tea which was flavorless. My waitress who was there physically but mentally absent took my order for BBQ wings , onion rings and the  B.U.B burger. I specifically requested the wings first and others to follow later but within minutes after the wings arrived the other two items appeared. When the waitress returned and I advised her what happened and her reply was the kitchen was caught up!  The food was decent but I was pleased mostly with the wings. The onion rings were too large, under cooked and a few had too much batter. The burger which contained two large slices of beef, bacon bits and contained another slice of bread which I removed. The burger was overcooked and on the dry side. I was ready to order peanut butter ice cream but the absent minded waitress didn't even bother asking if I wanted dessert and just left me my tab. It's ashame an establishment put this much time and money into this business and yet they have such a sad and unmotivated employee interacting directly with clients.

My husband and I shared a burger, hot dog, and onion rings.  Onion rings are good but eat quickly or else you will see a pool of grease.

When the waitress was asked almost anything, she was very attitudinal with us for no reason. Not worth 20%. They don't have a basic burger for, say, a ten year old.

Table was horrible.  Inches away from the next diner and to get up, you basically had to walk a block.  So I saw an empty booth and asked to be moved and they did relocate us.  Ordered the Manly's and garlic fries.  My first comment was that the food was not hot.  Burgers seemed that they were probably par cooked and then finished to medium, but it was truly just luke warm.  The fries were not hot at all.  For half price it was just OK.  If I paid full price I would be unhappy.  On the plus side, being that it was super crowded, the service was very good.

Enjoyed great cocktails and of course the Umami Burger with Truffle fries . I definitely binged on Truffle flavors by starting with the Beet salad... Killer good!( got to love arugula) .

Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and accommodating to our large group. She explained the beer menu and took her time in taking all of our orders.

The food was average.  I felt the same way as I did before when I first tried the food back in LA. The fries were semi crunchy. The grilled chicken nachos were sad and barely could be considered ""nachos."" 

I ordered the grill chicken sandwich and it was alright. The parmesan cheese was a nice texture added to the meal, but it was nothing special.

I cannot speak for the other days, but I went here with a group of 4 girls on Sunday night to take advantage of the 50% off the bill for locals. The restaurant is HUGE, and it wasn't packed. I believe they are understaffed, because the waiter took about 20 minutes to come to our table to ask for our drinks. That is by far the longest I've waited for water. AND, it was ONLY 20 minutes because I had flagged the waiter down while he was serving customers two tables away. 

During those 20 minutes, my friend had even left her order with us to go use the restroom, maybe took a number 2 or the bathroom was far away, returned, and was shocked that we hadn't gotten our waters yet. Actually, we hadn't spoken to a waiter yet when she had sat back down. 

Despite the slow start, the food came out within 15 minutes of ordering. I'm not sure if it had anything to do with us letting the waiter know that we were in a rush to catch a show. 

I don't blame the waiter, as he was trying his best to serve the customers. Perhaps they were understaffed or didn't have the system figured out completely yet. 

As for the burger--I""ve had Umami in L.A., and this was similar. The burger was good, but not out of this world. 

Truffle fries- I don't like it when my fries get soggy. I did not like the gravy looking sauce that was all over my fries, and the flavor of the sauce was meh.

4286034,2015-07-02,1,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"Umami fans in SoCal should know the drill here for the most part - for everyone else, Umami is a decent burger place that has some unique little spins although the menu doesn't seem to have really innovated all that much from many years past with a taste that is just okay.  
 
The restaurant is primarily a beer/burger place with some side options like salads and such.  If you're staying at the SLS, make sure to bring down the coupon book in case they do have some interesting options for food (like free ice cream sandwiches).  

Burger-wise, I tried the Ahi Tuna burger.  Presentation was fine.  The taste was simply okay.  The burger oddly didn't have much flavor although it had a ton of ingredients on it.  My friend said he enjoyed his onion rings and truffle fries along with their unique slightly spiced ketchup.  The ice cream sandwiches weren't bad but nothing too special.  Also had the beet salad side which was surprisingly big.  Didn't like the flavor very much this go-around for some reason though.  Prices will vary about $8-$15 per item.  

They have a regular beer/bar menu with a sorta-extensive beer list.  Surprised that the beer flight was limited to just a few of the core beers that included such not-so-great examples like Coor's and Bud.  They do have specialty beers at the very least which is worth checking out if you like it.  They also have a bar area with video poker.  

Decor-wise, you're looking at a very sports/bar setting.  They seem to have a beer garden in the back although when I was there, no one was around that outer area so we stayed indoors which had plenty of seating and tons of TV's.  

I'm personally surprised it closes at 11PM - being a beer garden/sports bar in a Vegas location.  Perhaps it's with the lack of a crowd at night but feel that it's a restaurant/bar that should be open much later - especially for the late munchies crowd.  

In the end, I'd give the restaurant about a 3 1/2 stars.  It's not bad by any means and hasn't lost much in the transition to the Las Vegas.  It just doesn't seem to have evolved much in its taste and even lacks a little bit in the wow/taste factor.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,1,3,cUomvuQx1H4V39KIH2gzQQ

We were seated in a booth that was comfortable and immediately greeted by a refreshing friendly voice and face. Our waitress AJ was a breath of fresh air. She gave us plenty of menu advice and time. She was genuinely concerned with our enjoyment of our experience. 

We didn't want to watch basketball on our booth TV. As soon as we let someone know we'd prefer hockey, the game was switched. 

The food:  ahi burger - amazing!  Big, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Throwback burger - solid traditional burger, substantial amount of beef and a very tasty bun. Truffle burger - just excellent, a wonderful grown-up mix of flavors. 

A choice of three sauces plus house made ketchup is offered up to the table - these were a great compliment to everything we ordered including the tempura battered onion rings, cinnamon seasoned sweet potato fries and truffle fries.

4402127,2017-05-05,5,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"I've been looking forward to trying a Umami Burger ever since I saw a TV special on them a few years back. I spike my own burgers with everything from fish sauce to marmite, so this is a burger I knew I could appreciate.

It was an exciting moment when I finally wrapped my hands around a $12.95 Umami Burger consisting of a 6-ounce beef patty reportedly made from American Wagyu beef and seasoned with soy sauce, ground-up dried porcini mushrooms, and dried fish head dust. Toppings included roasted tomatoes (tomatoes slow-baked in soy sauce), shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a round parmesan cheese crisp (referred to as a ""frico."") The burger was served on a Portuguese-style roll.

Imagine my horror as the flavor of the burger tasted muddled going down, almost like the burger was not made of meat, but instead of mushrooms or vegan ingredients. To be fair, the after-taste of the burger lingering in my mouth after I swallowed was good, quite ""beefy"" -- but there was something ""off"" by a mile with this.

After another bite, I identified that the burger was waaaay under-seasoned, despite whatever umami infusions happened in the meat. The lack of salt in this burger was tragic -- think of drinking a can of Coca-Cola without sweetener (sugar or otherwise) and how weird and jarring that would be. Salt is nature's best and most powerful flavor-enhancer. It is bizarre that a restaurant so focused on achieving a big umami flavor would eschew salt, likely relying on the soy sauce for salt rather than seasoning the meat manually.

Another crucial element was lacking: one of the best ways to generate umami flavor is to invoke a Maillard Reaction (e.g. browning reaction) and generating a flavorful crust on the meat. Yet, my Umami Burger looked baked rather than grilled and did not go through this process, arguably the most important flavor-producing reaction within all of cooking.

Some of the toppings were more effective than others. The roasted tomato confit was good (yay! flavor!), but the caramelized onions were just barely discernable. The burger needed cheese, and the problem with the parmesan cheese crisp is that it doesn't hug the burger the way a melted slice of cheese would, and it seems very separate from everything else when I was chewing it all.

On the other hand, the thin Truffle Fries I ordered were very tasty -- salty and crisp, smothered in melted cheese and a well-restrained amount of truffle flavor. Best of all, they're free with a Yelp check-in. If I found myself at the SLS late-night and hungry, I may hit up Umami Burger for the fries, but I probably would not get another burger.

I'm interested in knowing what I'm missing here. Somehow this restaurant remains in business and is known for its burgers -- what am I not getting?

I had  a 50% off coupon because it was my birthday month so I figured , ""why not""? I called ahead of time to the hotel's players club to see how to redeem the coupon and they told me to redeem it at Unami Burger. When I got to Unami Burger they told me to go to the players club to redeem it ....see the run around. Finally the players club had to work with Unami on how to redeem it. When I got back the fries were cold and the burger was warm but at least the problem was solved. 

I had the Manly Burger which consisted of beer cheddar, bacon lardons (bacon chunks), smoked salt onion strings, house ketchup, and mustard. The burger was juicy and had a distinctive taste it didn't taste like a burger from Jack and the Box or anything like that. The burger was overall very tasty. The Make em Manly fries was a different story. In short they tasted pretty bad the fries being cold didn't help either. It had the same toppings as the burger but the taste differed in the fries . It was too salty for me to eat and the fries were not crispy enough to withstand the toppings. The fries ended up a soggy mess. I ended with Mintimalism for dessert. It's a double chocolate chip cookies with dirty mint chip ice cream. I wouldn't suggest this unless you really like mint like I do. It felt like Christmas in my mouth which was great because I wanted to get rid of the salty taste of the fries out of my mouth. 

The service was very accommodating despite the birthday coupon snafu. They kept checking on us to see if we needed anything else. If you don't want to try Unami for full price the SLS offers 50% off one of their restaurants every Sunday. You would need to call ahead to the players club to see which one is being discounted on that Sunday.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,2,3,2-kItcgonYbab6Bpndnpmg

Umami is a popular burger joint and they are known for their Truffled creations. To me, truffle anything is a winner for me. Anywho, let me take you my adventure at Umami Burger at the SLS hotel.

The Umami Burger is combined with the Beer Garden and Sports Book. A dream combo for any beer fan and sports fan. With wide screens all over the place, this is definitely one of the casual hang out spots at the SLS hotel. Our server arrived promptly and explained the whole menu to us. This was my first time eating here, and if any server explains the menu to me, they are off to a good start. Two burgers that caught my attention was the Truffled Burger and the Jose Andres Special Burger. For those that are unfamiliar with Jose Andres, he is the culinary superstar chef behind the world-known Bazaar. A hint to all is that if its a Jose Andres creation, it certainly worthy to try out. Along with the burgers, we also ordered fries...truffled fries of course. The neat thing about this 3 hit combo establishment are the beers. Most places will have the typical everyday beers you can find from the supermarket. This place surpasses all of those expectations. This place has craft bottle beers and even beers that Ive never even heard of.

Beers are out, fries are out, burgers are out. Everything tasted great, service was prompt, and the dining experience was great!

If your low on a budget and want to eat something casual a the SLS hotel, lets this be your number one go to spot.

I don't know if it's a lack of process controls from corporate, but the burgers just don't compare with the LA locations. They're either overly greasy and raw..or burnt to a crisp. The sports book is small, the odds board is just a couple of flat screens, and as far as I know they don't give out drink tickets for placed bets. The beer menu is pretty limited for being a ""beer garden."" The LA locations usually only have 5 draft beers, but at least they are interesting craft selections. And don't get me started on the required minimums to sit down at a table. My group was told that we would have to commit to spending $100 a person in order to be seated. That's a lot of burgers and booze! We refused and they seated us anyway...go figure!

On a separate note, review your bill and credit card bill carefully if you choose to eat here. I don't know if its willful fraud or just lots of billing mistakes in their favor, but I have had overbilling problems at multiple Umami burgers. In previous experience, the Hermosa Beach location billed my card twice on two separate days for the same meal. It took multiple calls and a Visa chargeback to fix the situation. During my visit to Umami Las Vegas, we tried to split a $170 bill (tip included) on 3 credit cards. Each card was charged $90. When we complained to the manager, he claimed that it was a typo and that the waitress had meant to type $60 per person. We signed and left....but just to be clear $60 x 3 does not equal $170.

I like the concept of a restaurant branded sportsbook. I just don't like this one. I'm gonna spend my time at traditional sportsbooks, where I get to watch games with free drinks rather than get overcharged for already overpriced ones.",3EPUtsHjL6qH84LbkEgqdw,1,0,2,XpLiss86RWk80CesadEg9A

As far as the food, generally excellent. The burgers are unctious and full of the namesake flavor sensation, which I'm not sure some reviewers get. Meat is ground in-house (which yields a much better texture than typical compacted rubbery ground beef). The fries are underhwelming. They'd do better to switch to a hearty steak fry, especially since ""manly"" is a recurring theme on the menu.

4702256,2014-11-21,1,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"We came here for #SocialSundays when locals get 50% off the menu at a selected restaurant and obviously, on a Sunday. What a fabulous deal! I made a reservation through OpenTable and requested a table in their Beer Garden. The hostess couldn't find my reservation, but luckily, I resolved that through OpenTable. Fortunately, it wasn't busy yet and we were seated in our preferred area immediately. 

Side note: They're open an hour earlier (10AM) on Saturdays and Sundays during football season. If you sit inside, there's a $50 F&B minimum PER PERSON during the 10AM games. This does not apply to the Beer Garden though!

The Beer Garden is their outdoor patio facing Las Vegas Blvd. There are several televisions along the walls showing multiple games. The seating is picnic tables and very casual. There's also an entrance/exit to street, but you can't just seat yourself. It was a great atmosphere, especially with the beautiful weather that day. They don't allow smoking on the patio, but some patrons thought that hanging their arm off the patio railing meant that they were abiding. Yeah, no. The smoke was bothersome and off-putting.

Our server was really nice and with supporting staff, everyone was relatively attentive to our needs. The manager was constantly walking around the restaurant and he was approachable. There was an issue where we were watching a particular game and it was switched abruptly (however, the audio remained on that game) and we spoke to our server and the manager to have it resolved. First, we were told by our server that they do not change the channels for anyone or any reason (Really?). Second, we were told by the manager that the games switch automatically during Half Time, however, the television did not revert back after the game had resumed the second quarter. It took approximately 15 minutes for the game to FINALLY appear! No explanation as to what occurred. I can't imagine anyone being happy if this happens often during big games.

Truffled Beet Salad ($7): truffled ricotta, smoked almonds, wild baby arugula, and truffle dressing. The arugula was fresh. The truffle wasn't too overpowering. Overall, a decent salad, but nothing special. It's missing something - I didn't get that ""umami"" factor.

Fried Pickles ($6): artisan-crafted pickles, jalapeño, ranch, and shaved Parmesan. The pickles were okay; still had a bit of crunch. The batter was light.  Nothing remotely worthy of a repeat.

Smushed Potatoes ($4) with roasted garlic aioli. These were good. The potatoes were nice and soft inside while having some exterior texture. Their roasted garlic aioli is great.

Thin Fries ($3): Nothing special, but not terrible.

Umamify Your Fries - Truffle 'Em ($3): truffle cheese fondue and truffle salt. This definitely made their boring fries much more exciting. Nothing I'd come back for though.

Hatch Burger ($11): Roasted green chiles, house American cheese, and roasted garlic. This was just okay. It wasn't cooked medium rare like we requested. There was nothing exciting or even good. I can barely recall its taste now.

The Original ($12): Parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, and Umami house ketchup. This burger was terrible. The burger had no flavor and I didn't have anything remotely close to an ""umami"" experience with it. Oh, and you know how it says you get ""shiitake mushroom"" with your burger? Yeah, you really get only ONE mushroom and it had the circumference of half dollar coin! WTF?! How does that make any sense? Why wouldn't you slice the ridiculously small mushroom and attempt to distribute it on the entire burger? You get the experience of a shiitake mushroom, but only in one bite. You're SOL with the rest of the burger.

Spanish Royalty Combo ($35): Jose Andres Burger and Estrella Damm Inedit. The Jose Andres Burger ($15 individually) has a pork and cured ham patty, piquillo pepper confit, caramelized onions, Manchego cheese, and roasted garlic aioli. The Estrella Damn Inedit (750mL; $25 individually) is a malt and wheat beer created by Ferran Adria and his El Bulli team in 2009. So, you save $5 with the combo. Thank goodness this burger was good! It earned the additional star. The patty was juicy and the whole burger was extremely flavorful (or maybe just in comparison to the other tasteless burgers). I was happy with this burger. Ruben enjoyed the beer very much.

The food was extremely disappointing. We've been to Umami Burger in California and really enjoyed it, so this experience was surprising. The burgers are much smaller than the ones we had there. Even the Smushed Potatoes are smaller! Everything was hit with a shrink ray when it came to Las Vegas. The sides were decent, but the burgers (the Jose Andres Burger being the exception) were offensive! Also, I'm not sure when you receive the soup spoons with dipping sauces, but we weren't offered!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,2,1,2,rotvx9zdkOKTcrsACWwj9A

We're staying at SLS and decided to come here for lunch.. Wish we hadn't wasted our time. We come in, and it's not busy at all. We ask for a booth for 4 people, they seat us in a booth made for probably about 10. Huge table. Really? We asked for a smaller one but the hostess or whoever told us, ""Well they're all dirty so.."" there were at least 5 dirty empty booths at the time so I asked if they could clean one maybe? Hostess seemed irritated that I god forbid even asked of such a thing.. and told us that if we wanted to wait that we could. .. ok.. 

So we waited for them to clean the table. And waited. And waited. They finally do and we go to sit at the smaller booth, and one of the servers tell us ""uh, somebody is going to be sitting here..."" we replied ""yeah, us."" Totally rude. Eh, whatever. 

We get our drinks after waiting for at least 7 minutes for anybody to even realize we exist. From the busser. The server comes later to finally ask what we want. We order, and I'm watching the tables around us being sat.. at least 3 tables we all watched being ignored. Waiting at least 10 minutes to even get acknowledged. Are you kidding me?

One table ordered champagne, and the server didn't even know how to open the bottle. Had to take it into the back. The customers seemed confused. The people at those tables were still waiting to order food, looking around for anybody to help.. seriously there's so much to type but I can't even deal with writing the rest right now.

There were 12 TV's outside that I saw, a lengthy bar area, and some table games as well. I would definitely recommend eating outside; however, they raised the window shades halfway through our meal which in turn raised the temperature about 10 degrees. Keep the shades down guys! The view isn't worth it unless you like looking at trashy souvenir shops. 

I only tried the sliders and sweet potato fries (because they were free for the party!) but both were delicious. However, the Pepsi I ordered was very watered down and the menu was very basic with little variety at all. 

I was impressed with the good service! Our waitress Rachel was juggling several rowdy tables but made sure to bring over drink refills and ask if we needed anything else. She had a huge smile as well. Take note, management! She deserves her tips tonight.

Cons- good beer list but some of their beer was over priced. 12$ for a Octoberfest? 14$ for a Duval? That's ridiculous lol. Maybe more menu items in the future it was pretty limited. If you don't like sports don't come here during game time (I do love sports by the way) but it gets  pretty loud.

I know there are other Umami burgers (one in SF), but I definitely wanted to try it. 

As a family we ordered the smother 'em fries and a some nachos. We had them to share. The nachos were good - like regular nachos with beef. However the smother 'em fries are delicious. Gravy and shredded short ribs are a delicious topping to fries. It's really like poutine without the cheese curds. Wished that we could just get the fries poutine style! 

I ended up ordering the Royale burger - with short ribs, truffled aioli, and truffle cheese. All this truffle is delicious in a burger. My dad ordered the original which he enjoyed. Brother ordered the B.U.B. which was a big burger. 2 patties is quite a bit to eat, but he seemed to have enjoyed it a lot. Mom ordered the ahi tuna burger. Delicious! 

Overall, decent service, kind of slow, but there quite a few people eating at 9, but then again it is Vegas. Burgers came before the nachos and fries which we wanted as an appetizer which was kind of weird.",4RUXeyp_Af2C5t9JFyJlBQ,2,1,3,uFkJEGS2uW4NjIMYwJAORQ

4996136,2014-12-30,0,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"I took advantage of a discount coupon (spend $50, get $20 off) to check out Umami Burger a few nights before Christmas.   It was my first visit there, & first time dining at a restaurant inside the SLS.    Things can be somewhat deceiving -- the gaming floor inside SLS at about 7PM on a Thursday night was absolutely dead.  I felt sorry for some of the dealers, etc. as they just stood there.  Some were just looking at the floor, one was actually filing her nails(!!) and when others made eye contact with you, it reminded me of volunteering at the local animal shelter, where the dogs all gaze up at you & beg you with their eyes to take them out for a walk...

  Anyway, my friend & I were seated promptly (no reservation), and a waiter quickly stopped by to take our drink orders.   My iced tea was about $4, so when it showed up not filled-up to anywhere close to the top of the glass, I was rather annoyed, but thankfully, they had free refills so it was a non-issue.

My friend ordered a burger, as a vegetarian, I the one burger I could have -- the ""Sloppy Mami"" burger.   We decided to share an order of Battered Onion Rings, Smushed Potatoes &  Thin Fries with the Truffle treatment.


  The best way to describe the atmosphere & ambience of the SLS Umami Burger -- at least at the time we were there -- is SPORTS BAR!   There were dozens of TVs all over the place, *plus* the SLS 'Sports Book' is just there on the other side of a rail -- its basically part of Umami Burger, whether they describe it that way or not.  Seems like if you're wagering at the sport book, you're basically going to sit at one of the tables used by Umami Burger.

 The place was loud -- so loud that my friend & I really couldn't carry on much of a conversation.  I have no idea if it's always like that, or perhaps there were just some particularly 'important' games going on that evening (I'm not a sports fan...).

  My ""Sloppy Mami"" burger was, despite the name & list of ingredients, actually pretty tasty so I was pleasantly surprised.  A lot of 'upscale' burger places just glop a bunch of vegetables together into a patty to make one token burger for us vegetarians & that's what I was expecting, but the Umami people actually seemed to put a lot of thought & effort into designing theirs, and it was very good.

 My friend said his burger was good.

  The onion rings were just OK -- not a lot of flavor to them unless you dipped them into the ketchup, and them they tasted like ketchup.  Come to think about it, onion rings at most places are pretty bland.  Umami was no exception.    Thankfully, the thin fries & Smushed Potatoes were great -- mostly thanks to the truffle flavoring.

  All in all, food & service were very good.  If I was big into football, I suppose I may have appreciated the atmosphere, but there's a difference between showing some sports on TV & being a sports bar, and at least during prime-time hours, Umami Burger is absolutely a noisy sports bar.

  In retrospect, they do have outdoor seating -- a semi climate controlled patio looking out onto Las Vegas Blvd.  I'm not sure if it's only open seasonally, and I know it does have TV sets in that section too, but it may have provided us with a quieter environment.    It can be a lot of fun to people-watch along the Las Vegas Strip but the Umami Burger patio area is back a couple dozen yards from the Strip/sidewalk, plus the SLS is on what at least these days is considered the far Northern extreme of the LV Strip, so there's not a lot of action to watch.


  Would I go back?   Maybe in a couple months, if I had another coupon, yes.   But without a coupon, I can get food I like better elsewhere, cheaper.    If I was into sports & staying at the SLS, I'd go there to grab a beer & watch the game.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,3,tzefhsn0mZLlQZUUvKaU3Q

I had one of the truffle burgers and tempura onion rings. The burger comes out looking visually stunning. I enjoyed eating it until about halfway through.

Ambiance: 3 - Located in the Sports Book, Umami definitely has an active feel. It's loud and exciting, but not too busy..The place was organized, but the tables in the middle are TOO close together. We might as well have just pushed our tables together with strangers because it was basically like we were talking to each other. Someone please space the tables away from each other!!!! 

Service: 3 - Our server was sweet, but the service was great and fast in the beginning...but very, very slow at the end. Not too fun to be waiting 20-25 minutes just for the check! And there wasn't even that many people around. 

Food: 3 - Food was just okay. I got the Truffle Burger, Truffle Fries, and Onion Rings. It's a little sad and disappointing for me to announce that the best thing I ate was the onion rings..and maybe the sauces on the side they gave to us. 

I did not like how the truffle burger was just --drenched-- in truffle sauce. It made my entire meal soggy, and that's just not what a burger is about for me. I think if they go easier on the truffle sauce around here, people might like it better because it WAS actually a juicy and well-cooked burger. 

The truffle fries were way too salty. We had to constantly wipe salt off of ours. The truffle sauce and cheese that's on it is already pretty salty! Hopefully they will be subtle next time with that seasoning! 

When I had wine tasting classes, they taught us that umami was a balance of the tastes on your tongue. Yet, everything was either too salty or too soggy. Find a balance, and you'll get better reviews!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,1,1,3,F-efa65uZoQPs4DzkKAJ3g

For a beer garden the tap selection is underwhelming though but an overall decent selection of brews.

While the server we had was amazing, when we originally arrived we wanted to sit outside, when we were rapidly approached by a ""harsh"" waitress that told us that if we wanted to sit outside we could, but we would have to go order our food and drinks inside ourselves and basically we weren't going to have service. Sooo we look around and there were at least another 4 tables outside with people eating and drinking. So we don't know what was that about, we went back inside and got a table there, so we get the menu, husband and son order beers from their menu and they were not available, so they pick a second choice and once again they were not available, were we not at a bar that specializes in beer and burgers? Anyhoo the server made it up by offering something similar to what was originally requested. Burgers were great but the french fries and the sweet potato fries were seasoned great, but they were cold. Overall it was just a weird experience.

According to the online menu, there's a black bean burger available. The menu lies. There was, however, a vegetarian ""burger"" option that was pointed out to me by the hostess. Salvation!

SLOPPY MAMI ($12): I'd best describe this as a vegetarian sloppy joe. The burger was topped with tasty lentils (so tasty it made me wonder why I'm not including more lentils in my diet), a fried onion ""haystack"" (I hate onions but actually liked these), and slithers of jalapenos. Melted cheese held everything together. I was impressed with this Sloppy Mami. The downsides? Not enough jalapeno and it comes a la carte. 4/5 

THIN FRIES ($4): You simply cannot eat a burger without a side of fries. Thumbs up for these fries! 4/5

BEEF NACHOS ($10): I loved that the nachos came with a side dish of salsa. Who does that?? No one, that's who. My husband super duper liked this dish. 4/5

SERVICE: The food came out within 7 minutes of ordering, but service was intermittent. There's room for improvement. 3/5 

VIBE: The layout is kind of weird since the SLS Sports Book is inside Unami. Weird, I know. There's Unami diners, and then there's people lounging on sofas watching sports on TV. The restaurant was pretty rambunctious, noise wise.   

Worth a Return Visit?
I'm hoping to come back on Social Sundays to score a 50% discount!

Party of 3 lunchtime wait was about 45 mins. Leave your name & # w the hostess, get your gambling on, & they'll txt you when the table's ready. 

Cocktails are $13. The mule that I ordered was alright. Seeing that it was opening day, I'm sure the kinks will be tweaked out. 


Ordered the Royale ($15). Consisted of braised short rib, truffle aioli & truffle cheese on a med-rare burg. Taste and consistency were pretty on point from my usual go-to locations here in LA. Never had the short rib before so that was a nice tasty addition. Sweet potato fries ($4) were good as well. They had all the sauces displayed out on a plate per usual w the small pho spoons. 

Service was good. Each booth has a tv that in the future, you'll be able to request a channel change for a certain game I'm sure. Layout of the place is nice. Very open w a lot of tv's & a small lounge area in the middle of the restaurant that reminded me that there's an actual sports book in the restaurant. 

**PSA*** NO tots for at least a week!! Was very sad to find that out when I was there. Reason given from the waiter was that the training of the cooking staff had to be perfected before ""secret menu"" items were brought out. That also means no burger special for a while too. 

Overall, it's your usual Umami burger restaurant w the sports book addition. Great burgers w a lot of other menu options as well. If you can't get to LA or NYC, this location will def get the job done for the Umami fix. ENJOY!!",nkPkq59Wpa4K8O4GsF7HuQ,2,1,4,ZQJzMluI4sApBvJGJtZokg

It's a little pricey but getting a liter at a time helps soften the blow. I had a manly burger and a side of thin fries. While I enjoyed the manly burger I would have to recommend the original umami. The manly is heavy and rich but doesn't have the distinct flavor profile of the umami burger. The things fries were well cooked and tasty. I asked for some ketchup which never came but as we were sitting outside all the way on the end service wasn't stellar. The bartenders were very friendly and attentive though. I had no issues placing a couple bets on the NBA playoff games though I was a little disappointed that the sports book closed in the middle of the late game. I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to cash out my ticket until it reopened but I had no problems getting my money at the cage after telling them the sports book had closed. It's definitely a great spot if you a casual sports fan like me who wants to have a couple beers and maybe throw down $20 on a game.,jROifHJoOp30V2j45UECEQ,0,0,4,xmA8TJgX7x77O2tutRl-OQ
5319372,2014-09-07,6,PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,"I'm not a fan of Umami when I tried it a few times in L.A. years ago. My sister has never been and I can't say no to a free meal with family. You have to reserve a table (what?) or open-seating at the bar. I'd much rather stay at home and do homework than be here but since my sister already went out of her way to reserve a table, I showed up anyway.

Random thoughts: their house ketchup tastes like Filipino spaghetti; you only get 3g or protein per 100g (1 cup) of mushrooms which does not meet my protein needs therefore, I must stick with beef patty; I have low expectations of Umami Vegas thanks to Umami L.A.; Umami beer garden???; Umami buns look huge but press to deflate; they'll give you 4 different sauces: 1 spicy, 1 ranch, 1 garlic aioli that doesn't taste like garlic at all and house ketchup.

The Original:
House ketchup, parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato and caramelized onion. The frico adds crispness to an otherwise boring burger. 3/5

The Royale:
Braised short rib, truffled aioli and truffle cheese. Again, not truffle-y enough. The short rib was a nice touch. 3/5

Truffle Burger:
Truffle cheese, truffled aioli and truffle glaze. Sounds like a lot of truffle but it sure didn't taste like it. It had a hint of truffle and that's it. 3/5

Truffle Fries:
I've had way better truffle fries elsewhere. The fries were soggy and lacked truffle flavor.  Get the smushed potatoes instead. 1/5

Sweet Potato Fries:
Sprinkled with sweet salt. This goes well with the spicy dipping sauce and the house ketchup. 3.5/5

Mies Vanilla Rohe:
Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream in between chocolate chip cookies. The cookie itself wasn't that great. The ice cream was ordinary. Hello, cavities! 2.5/5

At least in L.A. I've gotten better service, food was a bit quicker and my drink glass was never empty. Umami is a casual dining place but calling it a sports bar/beer garden and having that atmosphere is just blah. Flat screens everywhere with different football games on and Criminal Minds = headache!

I did not realize that not only is it a restaurant and beer garden but sports book as well - and we were there the first Sunday of the football season.  I'm not a sports bar type of girl - I enjoy watching sports but from the comfort of my own couch :p  And it was too loud for my liking.  We were reserved a table inside but were shown a table outside and allowed to choose whether to dine inside or out.  The only tables available on the patio were out in the hot sun, so back inside we went!  It was very loud in there, and it looked like my sister and I were the only ones there for the food and not the games, but I couldn't complain being in a room full of guys and the 49ers game playing on all the TV's :p

Service was good and the food even better.  I ordered the Manly Burger (fitting for the day we were there lol) which is basically a bacon cheeseburger with onion strings.  My sister got the Truffle Burger, and we split some Tempura Onion Rings and Truffle Fries (like we couldn't get enough of them in our burgers lol).  I liked all the food, especially the burger and the onion rings - soooo good!  I was afraid the burgers were going to be on the smaller side - they look like sliders in pictures - but it was plenty of food.  I couldn't finish it all.  We split an ice cream sandwich for dessert, the one with snickerdoodle cookies and salted caramel ice cream.  I like both snickerdoodle cookies and salted caramel ice cream but this ice cream sandwich was just ""meh.""  Sounds great on paper but really not all that spectacular. 

While the dessert was underwhelming, overall I was definitely not disappointed by this place at all, and while I wasn't too sure about the loud sports bar atmosphere it ended up being a fun time :)",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,4,_h6_iojdQS-QU0gQcd2Eqw

Plenty of televisions, good food, good service, and a sports book that will give you money to pay your tab (if you happen to give them the right number). I've been here four times total, with visits for both lunch and dinner last Wednesday.

On Wednesday night, we came for game one Cavs/Hawks. There are plenty of televisions so you can catch your favorite baseball team also. For drinks, we had the bucket of 5 beers for $20. If you have your Code card, they offer drink specials for members. Ashley took good care of us for the duration of our stay. No complaints with our service this time or any time previously.

We had nachos and wings while we were there. Both were average. We didn't get any burgers that night, but I've had three on the menu. And while not the best ever, a few of them have some unique twists and I would rate them above average. I like the sunny side and hatch. We also received a free order of delicious ice cream sandwiches using a coupon which was in the discount booklet for guests staying at the hotel.

The biggest draw for me is the sports book along with the in game wagering if you're following the flow of the game. We were pumped that the Cavs took game one on the road. We were even more pumped that we took the +2. We took our $100 winnings after we cashed our ticket, gave it to Ashley, and walked out happy without giving away a dime out of our pockets. I'll be back for drink specials, to get some action on the game I'm watching, or just to hang out, possibly in the beer garden.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,0,1,4,Ars9lR-QtedsdIbVnrpdxw

The menu was a befuddlement of strange ways to make a burger. I picked a Cali burger but without the house sauce (careful due to egg allergy). It tasted weird, really...weird. The tomato was a glop (fire roasted apparently) and the onions were more like egg noodles - wet cooked strings. 
I scraped it off and tried again but it still tasted weird. Megan, my attentive waitress, asked if everything was good. I expressed my opinion. Although I didn't like it I didn't blame the restaurant. Sometimes things just aren't to your taste. However my  surprise and delight the manager immediately swooped in, organized for me as close to a ""regular"" burger as they were able to construct - which was basically burger, bun, lettuce, raw onions. The manager also brought over a selection of sauces on the side. She asked if I like mustard. I said don't even go there I only like colemans. 3 minutes later she showed up with a side dish of English mustard! The new burger was much more to my liking.

So there you go - it's not my kind of restaurant - but that's no-ones fault. This place went above and beyond to make it as right as they possibly could. Epically amazing service.",m__xZTnqECNSovr_oYyGwQ,0,0,4,5IxRk8Fb-mcBbukFtkUGlw

We came in to just grab some dessert. We got a couple of ice cream cookies and shared it among friends. Amazing! The salted caramel is probably my favorite. More importantly the gentleman that served us was AWESOME. Even though we were JUST getting dessert, he treated us super nice, was super personable and even checked in on us to see how the desserts were.

So, we came back the next night. This time to eat....sure cookies were the plan, but also to grab a late meal. This time, shiz went south. Real fast.

Placed our orders...and even though it was pricey I ordered a frozen beer. I think they are only available in a few places so I said what the heck. Got SUPER excited...then....our waitress forgot my beer. Like never wrote it down, never came with it. Burgers came out. They were good....

I mentioned to the waitress my beer (after flagging her down ... since she disappeared for a while). And told her we'd like to take a look at the dessert menu.

5 minutes pass.
10 minutes pass.

She finally comes back! Alright, so do you guys want dessert? UMMMM...you forgot to bring dessert menu??? Oh, yea...here let me get you one. No, that's fine. We will skip dessert. At this point I was frustrated. She didn't bring my beer. She wasn't around the entire time. She forgot the dessert menu. 

I asked for the manager and she came over. She gave me what I considered to be a pre-rehearsed speech. ""We are going to take care of your meal."" No, thank you...I'd like to pay. I just wanted you to know that your waitress really ruined the experience...and the guy the night before is AWESOME. ""I understand sir, that you didn't ask to speak to me to get a comped meal, but we will be taking care of it since you were not 100% satisfied."" It was robotic they way she said it. I reduced again. We went back and fourth a few times...then she finally brought my bill.

Listen, I'm sure they deal with drunk, angry customers all the time. But I was obviously sober (she forgot my beer, remember?). I genuinely wanted the manager to know, hey...this person is f'n up while also give props to the other dude. She seemed uninterested, and just offered a comp meal as a solution. I didn't want a comp meal.

I ate on the patio on my first visit - the Beer Garden (which is basically a let down of a name btw). I ate inside on my other visits. On all 3 occasions the staff were patient, attentive, offered great advice and even remembered us from prior visits.

My first visit I sat on the patio. It is referred to as the Beer Garden, but I can't figure out why. It seemed nothing like a beer garden to me. Seating consists of big huge picnic tables, which is great for large groups - a little strange for small groups. There are tons of big huge misting fans hanging, which help keep it nice and cool. My date and I shared the Sunny Side Burger, the Manly Burger and the Truffle Fries. The Sunny Side was by far my favorite, I can't generally pass up a fried egg on my burger. It was big, flavorful and worth the $14 price tag. The Manly burger was good too, lots of onion straws - but I don't think I'd order it again. The Truffle fries were TO DIE FOR! Shoestring thin, covered in truffle cheese but not soggy - perfection! If you like truffle you must try them!

My second visit I sat inside. There is a variety of seating, from big plush booths to leather arm chairs and sofas. It's what some might call a sports bar, but really it's a sports book! You can watch the games and bet on the sports, all while eating or enjoying a beer or cocktail. I had a Caesar salad with Grilled chicken. It has anchovies, which are optional - but I usally like that. The meat portions however were very small (my date had the same salad with Salmon) and the salad was just ok, maybe because it is kale, not sure why, but I didn't love it. I didn't finsh my salad and I definitely won't order it again.

My third visit I had the nachos with beef. The beef was shredded and marinated, it was amazing! There was plenty of guacamole which I appreciated. Strangely though the salsa came on the side and the cheese was a sauce, not real melted cheese so that was a big let down.

I will totally eat here again, but I don't think I'll branch out beyond the burgers, fries and beer next time however. Stick to what they are known for!",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,3,3,3,pXhpKBu_0EWDqoR293cNvA

Because we weren't dressed to impress and I was in my race gear, the quickest place we found with no wait was Umami. Good choice since they served beer and had the college football games on. TONS of TVs! YESSSSS

We were led to a nice table in the restaurant. The tables are kinda close together and you can literally talk to your neighbors. We were serviced by a really nice lady who was friendly and accommodating to our needs. 

Because of our race, we had 2 for 1 draft beers. NICE! We started off with a couple of drafts and then ordered truffle fries ($6.5) to share.

The fiancee order the Cali Burger (butter lettuce, roasted tomato, house spread and house American cheese ($12).

Damn these burgers were pretty expensive and lacked flavor. IMO, needed salt (which are not available on the tables). Without the buns, the portion is small. I did enjoy the fries however. Thin and crispy.

I did enjoy the truffle beet salad and the ahi burger was very good( and very messy), but our orders took forever and were sometimes forgot.

 But this most recent time I ordered Ahi burger. Holy cow, run and hide. 
 We all love ginger, I just think it should be a bit more subtle than thinly shaved strips atop your burger. And burger itself was absolutely inedible. It's as if a frozen patty was thrown on the grill in haste. Zero seasoning, zero flavor and it was still watery and cold! Come on, at least give it time to thaw out on the grill.
 I'm the sort that NEVER complains. I pay, smile and don't return. Call me passive aggressive. Voila.

FOOD:
I get that at the flagship location that you don't allow any substitutions on your menu. Good for them. When i ask for something different on my burger, I don't want to argue or have to debate Stanford's Debate Team. I want a, ""Sure thing!"" and I understand I might get ""That's gonna cost you a couple bucks extra"" at which point I'd say ""I'm worth it."" OR if you don't want people to make changes, then tell them and own it. 

Avoid the nachos and the pickle plate. The nachos were put on the menu because people were asking for it and even the manager understood why we were disappointed. Question: If the manager knows its bad why are you serving it. Issues: only a tablespoon of the braised beef accompanied a slave labor camp's output of chips with ""beer cheddar"" ""fondue"" drizzled on about 7 of the chips. 

The pickle plate was also a let down. They obviously use a boiling method for the pickling and they over boiled the canned veggies. Carrots, mushrooms, beet, red pepper, an actual pickle and green beans. Pickling is an easy process, it just takes time. Why not just use better ingredients and something a little more exotic for your vegetable selection. Tried everything and pushed it away. Bachi Burger has a much richer pickle plate if you ever want one in Vegas.

SERVICE:
Kinda touched on this already, pushy about their concept, but this location really doesn't have one so it comes off as misguided. Our server was nice, but I was noticeably unimpressed with her attempts to stick to her script of no substitutions even though this location allows them... and I think she was just not in the mood to have to put out energy to make the experience good for us so she gave us a lot of space... for a while. 

The busser cleared our plates and even asked us how things were for the first time since we got our food and we were honest about how less than spectacular we thought it was. That guy winked at both of us about 22 times in the span of 30 seconds. It was magical, but not enough for us to change our minds.

The lead/manager/assistant manager/some guy with bill control powers came up and asked how our meal was, we were honest and he agreed that the nachos and pickle plate and the wings (he mentioned them, not us) should not be eaten here. He took those items off of our bill as we barely ate any of them.

OVERALL:
There's nothing here that you can't find somewhere else, better and nicer. And if a place is gonna stick to its guns about no substitutions, then it better make sure EVERYTHING on its menu rocks hard the way it is. 

And one more thing: you need to be a litte more Johnny-on-the-spot with the channels on saturday afternoon during football.

It's a little sports barsy compared to the intimate/trendy vibe of the other locations. I have been to several Umami's and the U-mini (cheaper but still as tasty spinoff of Umami) in Westwood and I think consistency in their food has always been key at their restaurants. Their menu is exactly the same as the California locations as well. 

Loved that we got seated at a massive booth right away, service was so also pretty good and our server took our orders right away.  We did get our waters right away.. However, we probably waited for about 20 minutes for our burgers to come out. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was not packed at all. 

-Truffle fries were on point, and the server did give me the options for all the sauces (pretty standard)
- Truffle burger was great but I think is a little overpriced 
- Manly burger was also pretty good with the lardons and the onion rings however it is again, a little overpriced imo..

Umami has really got the flavor of the burgers down but size has always been an issue for me.

FOOD POISONING - I ordered a turkey burger with avocado and sprouts. I should have sent the burger back when it was barely warm on arrival.

Three girls, 3 turkey burgers- one beer, one side of fries one side salad--  bill was $70!!!! The restaurant also has an identity crisis- it's part burger bar / part sports bar /part Vegas Casino but the food sucks and the volume in the entire restaurant was way too loud. All the games playing were volumed at Super Bowl status, when there were no big games on it was just a variety of college sports.

I had read good things about the chain and was hoping for a good lunch.  Unfortunately Umami Burger did not deliver.   First, they tried to seat us outside in 105 degree heat even though there was plenty of seating inside.  You would think they would at least ask us before we are seated.  The next problem came when we went to order.  My girlfriend asked to add pickles to her burger but was told they couldn't do substitutions or additions because it would ""mess up the flavor profile of the burger"".    I've been to all kinds of restaurants in my life and that was a first.   I ordered the ""manly"" burger cooked medium.  When I got the burger the first thing I noticed was the size.  To call a burger this size a ""manly"" burger is a joke.  The next problem with the burger is that it had cubed bacon on it.  It was chewy and half of it fell off when taking a bite.  After taking a couple of bites I noticed that the burger patty looked pretty red for medium and was literally falling apart.   I took the top of the bun off and the meat stuck to both sides of the bun and was clearly RAW and room temperature.  My girlfriend's burger was cooked more but was still falling apart and mushy.  At this point was was done eating.   I spoke to the waitress and told her I wanted my money back.  She then proceeded to tell me that I didn't understand that their burgers just look raw because the meat is really fresh.  I was floored.  She took my plate and a few minutes later the manager came out and tried to get us to try the burgers again.  He gave us the same explanation about the burgers being raw because the meat is really fresh.  I have been to just about every high end burger place in Vegas and this was by far the worst burger I have ever had in my life.  I'd rather have a Big Mac from McDonalds. Then the manager has the balls to tell me that I just didn't understand their ""fresh"" meat.   At least my girlfriend didn't mess up the raw meat flavor profile with some pickles!  Eventually they comped us the burgers but still got $20 out of us for two Pepsis and an order of fried pickles.   If you're in Vegas and looking for a good burger do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  There are plenty of burger places that will give you an excellent burger the way YOU want it.

It's been years since my visit to a Umami, but I remember the trendy vibe they'd have going on. It's a negative here, it's got the feel of a Hooters.

The sports book? They have a guy in a polo taking bets with lunch order style betting sheets.

The service was moody. One second they smile with your greeting, then they don't at your order taking, then they do when they bring you your food and then they...you get it.

Umami Stuff

The burgers were the only thing that I could close my eyes to and feel like I was on Cahuenga Blvd.

Truffle Burger: The truffle everything gave it a melty taste that faded into your taste buds quite nicely. The meat was cooked how I ordered it. Another solid one at Umami. 4/5

Sliders: I love caramelized onions. So to pack that in a bite size serving was nice. 
The overall was nothing short of what I would expect but nothing above. 3.75/5

Truffle Fries: I'm such a sucker for the word truffle. They were alright. I wouldn't say that their truffle cheese is the best match for everything but the fries were well fried and that didn't hurt the topping. 3.75/5

Background - Wanted an easy meal and in our hotel.  So I used my open table app to get a table.  After getting their clearly we did not need to.  But I got my points.  I could have made my reservation through my television in my room.

Atmosphere - Huge sports bar.  ESPN radio was taking their stuff out and CBS Sport radio was setting up.  I expected a bigger crowd for 6 PM on a Friday night.  But it made it easier for me.  

Food
  Drinks - Ballast Point Calico in a bottle.

  My Meal
    Main Course - The Hatch, a burger you would expect to have an egg with that name, but it did not.  I think it was the type of green peppers used, but the menu did not call that out.  The meat was cooked to order, and the peppers gave a nice amount of heat.  The bun was soft and held up to burger and toppings.

    Side - Ordered a side of onion rings as everything is a la carte.  Our waitress told us the sides are large and one order would take care of us, and it did.  The onion rings were thick cuts and season well.  They came with three dipping sauces and all were excellent with the onions.  Sorry I do not remember their names, but the middle one had some serious heat behind it, the other was a garlic aioli. 


Service - Out waitress cover a huge portion of the restaurant which made it difficult to flag her down.  But other team members were always helping out.   The only problem was when we wanted to wrap up the bill our waitress was difficult to find, and the manager actually delivered us the bill.

The pickles are huge spears, which is hard to share, would be better if they were cut smaller like in slices. Onion rings were good too, the batter was pretty tasty.

The service could have been better. Our server kinda had an attitude problem so we weren't thrilled with that, Honestly though, the food was pretty damn amazing. If the burger was a little bigger than a kids meal size and came with fries I would totally give it 5 stars! So because of that, I will give 4.",aQYfyrB8MJZHaGw9XPXJEg,0,0,4,_nLfgDURTXAtfFMYzm2F_A

We got one order of the normal fries and another order of the fries with cheese on it. * Don't get the cheese on it. The fries are super skinny.

my boyf loved his California burger and I got the burger with the sliced green peppers I think it was in it.

Probably not, but be realistic about what you are saying of this location. Most of us that come to Las Vegas is to get away from our reality, have fun, perhaps do new things, pretty much experience something different from our norm. Most of the reviews are correct in a few things like its a sport bar, hundred percent correct. Every food joint is completely different from each other, so don't expect that the wings here are going to top Buffalo Wild Wings or the hamburger is going to top In n Out. We all have a preference, be open minded. Come check them out and be a judge yourself. If you don't like them, great! get some cardio in and walk to In and Out or go the very well known, commercial food joints and enjoy.

Had to ask for sauces and fries were served with cinnamon/sugar but not described as such on the menu. Interesting sweet twist but was searching for savory. Bill came and was surprised with an unannounced $45 fee to reserve tables. Let me emphasize the place is huge and was empty that day. The servers even remarked they had nothing to do all day.

The second lunch was even better than the first! Since we don't eat beef anymore, we split a ""Greenbird"" (turkey) burger and an Ahi Burger (seared with fresh ginger & wasabi sauce) and both were outstanding. The sweet potato fries were good, although they were more than we could eat.

Mandy was our server and she was great !!   Not only was she super friendly and attentive, she genuinely made sure everything was to our liking and the food was cooked to perfection. She even put our tea's in ""to go"" containers for our trip home.

After me expressing that this was not an acceptable answer he proceeded to say ""what do you want me to do, give you your money back?""

The one in LA didn't have the sports bar component. The Umami in Vegas is located next to the casino of the SLS Hotel. Right beside Katsuya restaurant. Very close distance to the monorail entrance.

The truffle burger was just awesome! I loved the touch of the charred U placed on the top bun. The meat was tender. Branded burger! My mom loved the ahi poke burger.  We split the two burgers in half so we could try both. She took a few bites of the truffle burger and wanted the ahi half back! And I wanted my truffle burger half back as well!

My truffle fries are totally delish! The fries were super thin with some cheese and garnish on top. Very easy to eat. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries were so sweet they should've been dessert! I felt they were overly coated with cinnamon sugar. We actually treated these fries as a dessert at the end of the meal. I found the fries reminded me of the Filipino dessert kamote cue (deep fried caramelized sweet potato).

The service was quick and pleasant. I felt the prices were a little expensive but it is Vegas after all. I ended up spending about $50 for myself and my mom. At the end of the meal the waitress said a new menu was debuting that day! She encouraged us to come back.

Unfortunately the service was quite the opposite..

the first time we showed up we had placed an order at 11:00PM for a few of their signature jose andrees burgers.

we were standing around waiting, they said they could text us when it was ready so I left my # and we hit the tables. 

a few heaters later, no text.

some more heaters, still no text.

no text, no calls, no texts. you get the point..

we went back and had inquired about our burgers through an employee who said she would go and check, she left.

inquired again through another employee, he left.. never came back.

we saw them bring out several to-go orders and leave them on the bar counter and we had asked if either of them were ours.. the waitress said not yet and she, just like the others said she would go and check.

at around 12:15AM my friend said forget it, he hopped the line and started checking bags. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? our order was sitting on the counter and the completed ticket said 11:30PM.

Our burgers were sitting on the counter for 45 minutes, cold as a pair of rock solid fake silicon implants.

***we asked the girl at the bar, she said sorry, I can get you guys a free round what would you like? **I asked for a Hennessy on the rocks and she said SORRY, ONLY WELL-DRINKS. OR A BEER. I dont want to sound like a snob but keep in mind we paid $40 for two burgers and some FRIES?!?

the manager said sorry, ill see if they can make you a new set. after eating they were just nuked a bit because the bread was softer than a pair of real.. well, nevermind.

he apologized and said if we came back he would take care of us.

we ordered $220 worth of burgers to the rooms and the truffle fries were delicious. we also came back and dined in to watch the sunday games while gambling away our life savings and the waiter wearing the packers jersey on 12/14 was phenomenal.

I ordered the Hatch Burger, and from the start when it came out, I was underwhelmed. The food looks a lot better in the photos, and frankly, the preparation of chopping the chills up -- with the seeds still in them -- shows they aren't aware of how to properly prepare a hatch pepper. 

The burger was cold, and nothing about it was remotely hot. The meet had clearly been sitting out by itself, and then the toppings added to make the burger. My client who enjoyed eating there the previous night, also complained about the same thing.
