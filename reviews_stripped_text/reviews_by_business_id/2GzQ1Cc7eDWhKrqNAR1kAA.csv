They are very quick to get you through the line while being courteous and friendly. I used to live nearby and was a frequent customer until I moved away and still drive by a chipotle to continue going to this one. Last but not least the food quality is great and always fresh.

Sure, if there was a sign beforehand notifying the lack of ice T I would have considered drinking water or something else. It's unacceptable if I have to notify your employees twice; who then promises to bring some out and then 15 minutes later says it's going to take 20 minutes to brew. 

And don't serve burnt chicken either!

The lady that took my order has definitely seen better days, I've seen people in jail have better service. 

After I order my food they start preparing the items that are needed leaving me with the scraps at the bottom of the containers. Who wants to eat the remnants that have been sitting there for who knows how long, plus there were barely any of it. Unacceptable. I hope management better trains there staff and the regional manger knows what's going on here. I haven't been to chipotle in sometime and to have this experience makes me want to come back to this establishment. Please get your act together.

The customer service was great even down to  the last minute.

How is the the staff not polite enough. You should know what you want, expect to be served and eat a fresh cooked fast food meal. You aren't paying for conversation and a good time.  This isn't a 5 star restaurant. A nice welcome, would you like anything else and a thank you for coming should be enough. Let's be realistic! Yes I did get a little more but I'm a nice person and the staff was wonderful to my family and I. 

We walked in very close to closing. How do people blame restaurants for their poor decisions. Yes somethings were out. So what! Either way this is what I wanted and they had many options!

Pretty lackadaisical employee bunch. I noticed that hubby returned to the car very quickly, the same song in the car was playing (our son was in the back, so this was a takeout order). Noticed that there were quite a few diners outside.

I went here on the Halloween promotion day (previously, my first visit to this particular location) though, it was steady busy, but I was served much better than our recent experience here (the lady was very nice and conversational), just a few weeks ago. Hence, the two stars, or else this would've ended up as one star. And I don't do many of these, if you are familiar with my reviews, you'd know (and I write a lot of reviews). 

When I opened up the bowl, when we got home, I was disappointed. This was, by far, the smallest size bowl ever purchased at Chipotle. Yes, everything tasted good, but missing were the fajita veggies (onions and peppers). I was still a bit hungry after that meal. I split it with our son. Hubby's burrito was minimal (sad face, poor thing, hubby always looks forward to a meal at Chipotle; it is a staple for us, usual weekend eats), and that is the best accurate description, minimal.
