53478,2014-08-08,0,gSR9bmBa0HacSuMX5BIAxg,"so its a hot day in  Las Vegas.  decided to stop by marie callenders for desert by purchasing a pie with coffee. to our surprise the waitress said that its their policy not to serve WHOLE PIES AT THE TABLE IN THEIR RESTAURANT. so my wife and I agreed to just have coffee since we sat down and ordered the pie to go. 
     I know they have the right to deny service. but what if i wanted to eat 10 pies in their establishment? we did not ask for special order. their pies are sitting in the show case and all we did is ask for a whole one to eat at the table with my six year old and one and a half year old with me and my wife. I mean if we were to order 4 slices thats the same as a whole pie, I ended up just cancelling the order and drank our coffee and left . now we know why the second location went out of business on flamingo and decatur.
the restaurant was empty at 4pm in the hot after noon and its like there was no line of patrons waiting to be seated or ordering anything to take home.
I guess the pies look a lot better just sitting in the show case rather than be sold. I dont understand the logic but its their business maybe I needed to slow down on sweats anyway",nd9Zs0viCYCSNxw1wWl9mQ,2,0,1,ePGNWTvWhaNsszIPdMVTTg
122575,2013-08-08,0,gSR9bmBa0HacSuMX5BIAxg,"I wanted pie. I like the pies at Marie Calendars. This is the only reason I chose to eat lunch here.

I ordered two veggie items from their ""light"" menu. The image of the pasta shell and veggies made it look like it was 2/3rd veggies and 1/3rd pasta. The item that arrived was 4/5th pasta and 1/5 veggie, and very oil-heavy. Those few veggies present looked like ""dwarf-veggies"" -- imagine carrots but much smaller. Same with other veggies. There was a thin pool of oil and over half of the pasta remained in this dish before I stopped eating it. I'd bet local, repeat customers prefer pasta.

I also ordered a salad, but the lettuce was the most wilted I've had in a salad in Las Vegas in this last trip. Veggies also suffered from looking less than crisp, and limp.

The only saving grace was the pie. It was delicious.

If I am to return here, it will only be for pie and tea -- I'll eat the meal somewhere else.

Food prepared at other Marie Calendars (outside Las vegas) does not suffer like this. it is possible all Las Vegas Marie Calendars have similar quality, but I didn't visit them.

If not for the pie, this place would get 1 star.",D2XYOmuylBWLBEyDjC_l9A,1,0,3,wzNa-TdvFUbx3DpFwiJj8w
302830,2016-05-27,0,gSR9bmBa0HacSuMX5BIAxg,"My parents love it here but our last experience here was somewhat unpleasant.

We had dinner here for my dad's birthday and the whole family was present. My 8 yr old nephew is allergic to a lot of things, so naturally my brother was cautious. As usual, he would have a little talk with the restaurant manager and ask about the ingredients for the kids meals. Other restaurant hosts would make sure that my nephew would get enough to eat, without serving him any food that he might be allergic to.

But not here. I'm not sure at the moment if the lady who was talking to us was the manager or the head chef. She was dressed in a sloppy hoody and talked with an attitude.

""So what are you crying about?"" Is the first thing she said. WOW. That is not the way you treat customers. Especially loyal ones. My dad is a little deaf so he didn't hear that. I looked at her in disbelief but I let my brother do all the talking.

I felt like my brother was pissed but he still carried on in a calm manner because his son was there. He simply asked her questions about the ingredients of her food and she sounded so condescending about everything and from what I remember, one of the last things she said is, ""do you want me to read off all the ingredients on allllll the boxessss? Because that would take some time."" My brother forced a smile and just said, ""you know what? Just forget it. Thank you for your time."" She walked away still looking pissed, I don't know why. 

My poor nephew ended up not eating anything because he's scared. He knows soy, tomatoes, wheat, and other things could practically kill him. I feel bad that he couldn't be helped. :(

Food was so-so. I got a headache from so much grease.",QFnm6AG-3uFYBm2ZCrf8lQ,4,0,2,HiL0Cr0D5eNGkg9y0lMx9w

My fish and chips were the worst I have ever had. The coating was overdone and oily, the fish was not flaky and moist but old and had the consistency of having been frozen more then once. The fries tasted off (time change the oil in the fryers) and the seasoning was odd, and they were overdone as well. The cooks don't care, the waiters serve this overpriced and overcooked slop.

I decided to call and speak with the manager. His name was cody and he was very polite and asked what he should do to make it right. Would we like our money back or would we like to come pick up another pie? I opted for another pie, since i know they usually are delicious. 

He was super kind. Even took us where the pies are in the back to show us all the different kinds (that they hadn't run out of) and offered my daughter a free cookie. Such great customer service. He said he was glad i didnt yell at him on the phone like most customers do. We ended up taking a blueberry pie home (cause Cody said that was his wives favorite) and it was the best marie callenders pie I've ever had. Topping the peach and apple! Serious perfection!

And to make it worse, the server delivered this information from his manager in an impolite manner.  I have the server's name but will not share it here.  My husband gave the gift cards to other customers in the restaurant so the restaurant ended up accepting the gift cards anyway.  I think the manager should have either lightened up on his hard-nosed decision or come to our table and politely explain his decision.  We will never go to this restaurant again for a sit down meal due to the unfriendly service and rigid policies.",zMi6qDVicwOyrwYSzLo9cw,1,0,2,57fBtRCtl1xIL-ASMQf7xQ

Upon arriving I checked in and showed our waitress the deal. 
Jasmine ( our server ) was really friendly and fast.
We ordered drinks and got free fresh cornbread   to start. We each ordered entree's and opted for the salad bar add on at $4.99. this is a better deal than the soup and salad bar alone at $11.99.
The salad bar is on the small side but has fresh  produce and 2 soup offerings.
I had the double shrimp pasta which was really good and piping hot, the shrimp was crispy and delicious.
My partner had the pot roast which looked great and was also piping hot, neither was in a microwave tray.
The setting is comfortable and quiet as we got in early and did not have a crowd.

We ate and the food is a solid 3 star. However, I came for the pie which we took back to our resort. It cost $5 for a slice of lemon chiffon and we could get the entire pie to go for $11 + some change. That is about 5 big slices. You do the math.

But today was anything but...the service was the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered the tri-tip sandwich and ask the server to substitute the fries for the wedge salad, and some extra BBQ sauce on the side. The server said no problem. My mom ordered vegie taco and soup off the two item mid-day lunch special. It took forever for the food to come out and when it did come out, my order was wrong. My mom asks for some tobassco sauce and extra pico. The server comes back and said that the cook was fixing the order and that it would take 2 minutes...my mom asks for tobassco sauce again. So, as I'm waiting for my food, I notice that all the customers in her area don't have food on their tables and the server is no where to be found. 20 minutes later, my mom is done eating and I'm still waiting for my food. She brings out my order but this time instead of giving dressing for my wedge salad, she gives me bbq sauce.  I scarf down my food as fast as I can so I don't get back to work late from my anything but a quick lunch.  I ask for a box...time goes by...I ask another server for a box. The server then brings out the check, without asking which piece of pie I want, which she so cheerily announced was included in my meal when she took our order, and runs off...where is this girl hiding at?!? I ask to speak the manager, meanwhile my mom looks at the check and notices that it's all wrong.  The girl charged us for a three item mid-day lunch special and extra soup and instead of substituting my fries for a salad...she charges me for extra side salad. So I didn't get fries, which came with the meal, and was charged for a salad.  So when the manager, who was very curt and couldn't bother to stop a second to speak to us, comes out, she announces that she fixed the check. My mom asks her about the substitution and she said that's how they do it.  REALLY so then I'm thinking...if you're gonna charge me for the fries anyway...I want my fries! But I don't have time to argue with her and just say whatever, paid her and left without pie. Probably will not go back to this location again.

You have ONE person taking your name and physically highlighting the hard copy and repeating your name to the ""grabber"" who runs to the truck, gets the box, runs and gets the pies, forgets the extra sides (because he's only one person and the highlighter girl doesn't do anything but highlight).

The manager shouldn't act above the staff in fact that he can't clear a table or run food out.  It was a busy day but no excuses especially when I only saw him standing around.  He's not friendly to guest, that should be his priority.

The answer was an abrupt no. Customers are not allowed to buy a whole pies and eat it in the restaurant.

The last time we came to Marie Callender's I was very disappointed so when my mom dragged me here because she was craving their French onion soup I was not excited.. I will say that I've noticed MC definitely attracts more of the ""older crowd"" haha 
Service on this day was very slow and the food seemed to take forever but when we got our food I was pleasantly surprised... 

-Grilled Salmon with Fresh Strawberry-Mango Salsa = DELICIOUS the salmon was fresh as well as all of the fruit.. I loved the coconut sauce/rice it came with and I also loved the side salad it came with that was topped with more yummy fruit! 
- Rosemary Chicken with Potatoes and Broccoli (560 calories) part of their ""delightful dishes"" simple but still tasty and it's good to see some healthier options at MC.. 

I think MC needs to lower their prices though.. most of their entrées seemed to be $16+ which, to me, seems a bit steep for MC..

From the options for sides included with the entrees, we both chose a side salad. Received my confirmation online.  My husband went to go pick it up and they refused to give him the salads. 

Wait... what?

Manager says salads aren't an option as a side for the entrees.  That's weird, cuz your online ordering system offered it to me as an option, that's what I picked,  and that is what my receipt says. 

Nope.  Not giving us the salads.  We have to choose French Fries, cole slaw,  or fruit.  My poor husband argues with the manager a little.  Still a hard no. He tries to call me but i don't pick up.  At this point he is too nice to make any more of a stink about it, so he reluctantly just gets fries. By the time the French fries leave the kitchen, our appetizers and entrees have now been sitting for 15 minutes and everything is cold and soggy when he gets home. 

I am obviously displeased and frustrated since French fries were pretty much the last thing i wanted and my dinner is now basically inedible. So we get into an argument, which puts quite a damper on our evening. All because some stupid manager couldn't ask his kitchen to make a couple of side salads to go. 

Thanks for nothing Marie Callenders!

We got invited to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house and I thought it would be a good idea to bring over some pies. Not the cheap grocery store kind. I wanted ones that were reputable and delicious. I called the restaurant in the beginning of November and asked how their ordering process works. The employee told me that because they sell so many pies during Thanksgiving, they don't do pre-orders. However, they would have a tent set up in the parking lot with a lot of their pies available to purchase, so all I would have to do is come on down.

Luckily, the day before Thanksgiving, I got out from work early, so I drove straight here. The parking lot was packed and the line was pretty long! But, it wasn't as bad as it looked. The employees did a good job at keeping the line moving. I think because they only had 2 registers and had to either fix or replace the register tape often, that was the reason why the lines didn't move any faster. Plus there were some customers who were like ""What?? These are THAT expensive? On second thought, I'll just buy one."" Ummm hello....read the signs people!! You had all that time waiting in line to look at their prices and to decide!! I picked up Pumpkin and Chocolate Satin (this one is made with a Oreo crust. 

Listening to other people's conversations, pre-orders can be done online. They had a separate tent for pre-orders of pies and feasts, with a short line. Good to know for next year! The pies were tasty. The Chocolate Satin pie was kind of rich, but everyone enjoyed both.
