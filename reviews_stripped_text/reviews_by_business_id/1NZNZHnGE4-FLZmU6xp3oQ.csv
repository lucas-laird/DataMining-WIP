I asked her about the price that she charged me, instead of explaining slowly, she talked fast.  I asked her again and again for the third time because she intentionally explained it fast that I had a hard time understanding her.  I asked her who is her supervisor.  She pointed to the woman next to her.  The supervisor, if she was really the supervisor, did not even acknowledge what was going on.  She ignored the whole thing about the rude employees.  She was so rude laughing about the whole situation.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!   I can't believe the owner of the store put up with this attitude.  Fire her!!!!!!

Although I rarely come here anymore since I no longer work at the mall, it just isn't as good of a value as I recall. They used to fill your box up to the brim with food until it would barely close. Now their portions are so skimpy, it makes Panda Express look generous. You can hardly even fill up on a 2-item plate nowadays. 

Seems like the price has gone up too...it's now almost 9 bucks for that same 2-item plate. So unless you're dying of starvation at the mall, I'd say skip this place, and the food court altogether and go somewhere else instead.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,2,tphgS4ndHNIwRh0mhjpNlQ

- Service: the ladies are pushing you to spend more money or buy a beverage. They will not provide a water cup but will push to pay for water.

- Food: I had Lo Mein, Chicken Mushrooms, Eggplant Tofu.. It all tasted doused in oil! No joke, check out the picture of the end result! No flavor, no quality, not worth the high price!

- Price: Already an unjustified price point for the menu options. Then the rotten, unfriendly service and tasteless food confirms why they beg you to add an extra item or buy their bottle water.

Don't be fooled by the long line! There is nothing great about this place. They should be out of business soon if all they care about is making more money!",EeaNH7nMNMGZxGg1qO2fpA,0,1,1,cGHbmgffiTi24ek_zsSE8w
