16997,2013-04-06,0,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"Roamin' Dough is definitely going down as one of my favorite food trucks I've tasted.

I've heard my friends talk about this truck and how much I have to try their pockets. I saw them and gave in to the southwest pie. The $7 I paid for it was worth it. The pie was beyond what I expected. The dough of the pie was soft and every bite had flavor.

Waiting for the food wasn't a problem either. Compared to other food trucks that take awhile to cook their food, Roamin' Dough didn't take that long. It was probably a maximum of 10 minutes, and if it does take longer I would not mind.",BGMmFg6relFh0-sJEwAvbA,0,0,5,Y8EZXkTIYe9VU4vvg1lA3A

The dates are filled with a smoked almond which add a great flavor/texture. The pulled pork has a nice tang to it.

I would highly recommend this place, I've had many of the menu items and specials, the meatballs and BBQ pork are too of my favorite both made fresh. Check them out at Lees on Lake Meade or one of roaming spots.",IVvlChaEi7bAjvVJSp_7qg,1,0,5,foF-dFSB4wyZGGJOmcmBEA

Delicious, the pastry was light enough to taste great, but firm enough to hold the meat.  I will be back, especially because they have a semi permanent spot. Don't forget the bacon and blue cheese dates - so good.",2PN4UK7g9hMnxyBq-_6qbg,1,0,4,KZ1jPMNJrx1HAiOBRDjVmQ
1687878,2012-08-27,0,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,I had the good fortune of eating from the Roamin' Dough while attending a recent social event.

2059840,2012-06-14,0,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"Finally checked this place out, as it's only a couple blocks from work. As a fan of delicious flavor, I'm sorry I didn't try sooner.

In a nutshell: Tasty, tasty hot pockets / empanadas.

What I tried:
1 turkey, bacon, cheese, and caramelized jalapeno pocket pie with a side of mango chutney; great flavor, very nice bit of heat from the jalapenos, and the chutney was a great flavor counterbalance.

1 southwestern pocket pie: chipotle chicken with cheese, green chile, sweet corn, and black beans, with a side of cilantro avocado cream sauce; not spicy, but more flavorful than the turkey/bacon one. Very filling.

1 side order of mexi-fries: fries with chili, lime, and parmesan flavor, covered in sweet corn relish; decent flavor, but a little too sweet/tart for my liking.

The pastry pockets themselves were hot, crispy, flaky, and chewy. I ordered too much food, because I wanted to try a few different flavors, and each pocket is quite large - think a bit smaller than a large calzone. Luckily, I brought them back to work and was able to share with some coworkers.

Bottom line: Great pastry, great fillings, great price (~$5 each). Will definitely come back, and definitely want to try their bacon-wrapped dates next time. Gave it 4/5 because I think I'd have to try other items on the menu to see how they compare, and because the mexi-fries were only average.",jhaT21VWZVtW2zXPVmzeyg,2,0,4,mS6EgO6iCJBYfNIx2eAwAw
2289876,2012-03-31,1,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"Holy crap this truck/trailer/potentially mobile food service entity is GOOD!  I tried the cordon bleu pocket and the bacon wrapped dates.  The bacon wrapped dates rival Firefly's . . . and from a truck!  But the pocket stole the show. Only $5, huge, and oh so tasty.  Creamy sauce with generous chunks of ham and pulled chicken.  

I think the cordon bleu pocket is a special.  But if the other pockets are even close. . . holy crap.  I'll be here every chance I get.  The side of the trailer says they serve breakfast, too.  Score!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,3,1,5,na7pZTlLCexKnQKD7Ba9jg
2352058,2012-07-29,4,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"Just tried Roamin' Dough for the 1st time today at the First Food Truck Smackdown.

The two ladies in charge of the food truck were extremely nice. They explained the entire menu, even though we were there for a sample. I loved their menu but promised myself I would only do the sample to keep a fair and open mind. 

They gave us two of their bacon wrapped dates, sprinkled with feta cheese and drizzled with sweet vinegary sauce. Not liking dates, I tried them anyway. Always giving the benefit of the doubt. Sadly I was not a fan, it was very sweet but i still can agree it was full of flavor. Sweet AND salty. 

The customer service was great and they gave my daughter a cute blue pin wheel to have. I cant wait to come back and update with their famous pockets!",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,7,6,3,9jAaF0EvTpdSSk5yplP0Jw

I finally had the chance to check them out at the food truck smackdown. They were serving bacon wrapped dates. I don't really like dates, but these were the real deal. A touch sweet for my tastes, but definitely way better than anything I expected off a food truck.

I can't wait to try their other offerings. Just hope I catch them open some time.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,1,0,4,UoBzOH5y-pnP7PDrM6xDYQ

Roamin' Dough serves up pocket pies, fried dough pockets filled with yummy meats and cheeses, along with toasted ravioli, Parmesan fries, and other goodies. I tried the beef and cheddar pocket pie today. It was pretty simple, beef, cheddar, onions and red peppers, inside the pocket, but it was DAMN good. I'll be back for more, since it's near my house, and let you know what the other pockets are like when I try them.
Update: Just had a chance to try out the panzarotti (pepperoni, cheese) and the bacon wrapped dates.. The panzarotti was oh so yummy. And the the bacon wrapped dates are like heaven.  Actually, they accidently overcooked my first order, so they gave me extra dates when they remade it. Happiness!",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,4,3,5,cLQRnDF8heiwd4OH-KtynQ

I mentioned a twitter promotion they were offering and how I was upset I couldn't partake in it and the owner gave me the promotion no questions asked. I really wasn't expecting that and it is service like that that will have me coming back time after time. Throw in incredible daily specials and there is always something new to try which keeps the foodie in me happy. Keep up the amazing work!",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,8,6,5,2-ZoGsDWiVWUJg-r3wxwcg

They happened to be at the Gourmet Food Truck Block Party this weekend, and Wifey
thought that the Southwestern pocket pie sounded delicious, so we got one of those along with an order of Bacon Wrapped Dates.

WOW! Nothing but good flavors and textures in the filling paired with the dough which seems like a cross between a very flaky pie crust and puff pastry-SO TASTY!!!

Looking for a hot date? You can find 'em here! These bacon wrapped bad boys pack such a flavor combination that you can't eat just one! Roamin' Dough's version definitely
ranks up there(I think it surpasses them) with Twin Creek's and Firefly's ones.

Definitely worth a visit if you haven't tried them yet...ALOHA!!!!

3698234,2012-04-02,0,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"I'm hooked, and thanks to Roamin' Dough, I will never look at a hotpocket or any pocket pie the same way again! If specialty filled dim sum buns are your thing, then I promise you my friend, that specialty pocket pies will ALSO be your thing. 

I ordered the Panzarotti, Trailer fries, St. Louis Toasted Ravioli, and the Bacon wrapped Dates. 

o0o...the dates! the dates! Those are my favorite. Although its not a pocket pie, I'd still have to say that their dates are my fave. It's a sweet taste thanks to the smoked almonds, and the blue cheese crumbles cancels out the sweet flavor so that its not too sweet. The nice bacon crunch also made it a good combination. I'll never have another stuffed date again unless it's with their sweet wine reduction, smoked almonds, blue cheese crumble, and wrapped in bacon.

Panzarotti, its huge! it's very filling, and much like a pizza hotpocket just with that nice extra doughy crunch to it. If you're looking for a quick snack, this would be a good choice. It's like a mini calzone. They split it in half for you so you can go halvsies with a friend! 

Trailer fries are addicting! The herbs and Parmesan cheese make it go great with your Panzarotti. Thanks to the seasoning, the fries don't taste boring at all. 

St. Louis Toasted Ravioli is like the pizza pocket pie, but just a mini version. if you get the ravioli, I'd suggest ordering a pocket pie that doesn't consist of marinara or any similar tasting to pizza or ravioli to widen your variety and taste buds.

Service was wonderful. They were so friendly and accomodating to my requests. I'll be back for more. Thanks Roamin' Dough!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,5,4,5,2HW2U867N2UdsfoT-B_d7A
4054795,2012-03-14,1,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"I was able to check out Roamin' Dough at Tommy Rocker's this past Saturday. There was a selection of food trucks to choose from, Roamin' Dough caught my eyes because they offered up bacon wrapped dates. 

My pal Jaime W. ordered the dates (and some fries but I didn't try those) and was willing to share with me, so I ordered  the Panzarotti, which is like a pepperoni hot pocket only WAY better. Neither order took very long and both the dates and the pocket came out super hot.

The pocket was ok, it was jam packed with pepperoni and lots of yummy, melty mozzarella cheese. I waited a little too long to eat all of it and it ended up getting a bit soggy on the bottom.  The dates on the other hand were fantastic, anytime I see Roamin' Dough out and about I am going to get an order of them for sure.

If you are a fan of the bacon wrapped dates at Firefly, you should check out Roamin' Dough, chances are you'll be a fan of their dates too!.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,1,4,V9Shmika0OoPnBwSVRsMUg
4387580,2013-01-31,0,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"Here is the breakdown for Roamin's Dough when I had it a few days ago:

FOOD:
Panzarotti (Pepperoni with smoked mozzarella and Parmesan) - taste like a bland pizza stuffed in a flat piece of dough that was super greasy. 

Buffalo Chicken Pie (Spicy chicken, celery, green onion, and spicy buffalo sauce) - This was the better tasting item if I had to choose if you put a gun to my head.  Amazingly this pie was greasier then the Panzarotti and you can feel the oil coating your mouth.  

The taste of the chicken was a lot better then the pepperoni but if you were to look at the exterior (without cutting the pie open) they look exactly the same - flat, greased up, limp, and definitely nothing like the photos on their website lol

SERVICE:
Thankfully I didnt ordered from them directly since if their service was as good as the food I would probably put negative 1 star.",pHnTiqjkLajb3UdoUg3f8w,0,0,1,DfpyIjunj__HwFPbyKij_g

A friend and I went to First Friday and ended up at Roamin' Dough for dinner. It was awesome! We had been looking for Haulin' Balls, but they weren't there, so of course we had to try the Meatball Sack (hehe, Beavis, she said ball sack.) That was one tasty ball! Ok, seriously, the meatball was really flavorful and wrapped in a yummy dough and came with marinara sauce on the side. The star dish had to be the fries, though! They were so good, fried perfectly, and covered in herbs and parmesan cheese. We also had the cilantro avocado dipping sauce for the fries...amazeballs! The price was also good...$10 for 2 people.

5199607,2012-04-30,7,L0LNTAw2QqbPTZNPO49xMA,"These are definitely hot pockets in the sense of ""hot"" meaning what's happening and what you should be noshing! Not, Hot Pockets, the sad grocery store staple of bachelors and latch key children. 

I had the opportunity to sample a Roamin' Dough creation at the Vegas Spring Social. It happened to be a vegan variety because I couldn't resist black beans, green chiles and zucchini! The pocket exceeded my expectations. It wasn't light and fluffy. The pocket itself had a slight sourdough taste, which I loved, and the fillings were nicely seasoned and generous. The pocket was accompanied by a cilantro avocado sauce. Everything went together like a well thought out gift. And, all while keeping it vegan, so kudos for that!

I just wish it were bigger! I could have easily consumed two of these numbers. I was hungry. It was delicious.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,7,5,QBU4kFw90HVLum7sB0cIQA

Some of the best versions I've had have come from trucks.  What I don't want is a bacon-wrapped date, fries, and a chicken cordon bleu hot pocket.

Hint to food trucks...  do one thing really well.  Don't be everything to everybody.  Do great hot dogs or burgers or doughnuts or ice cream or tacos, but not all of them.",xymN6nkSGPL4A2D3C2DuaQ,0,0,2,Tz6588x1MqPB-w3ewsT4HQ

I picked up a Panzarotti (pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomato) and a Southwest (chipotle chicken, green chili, corn, black beans and cheese) and both were still piping hot when we got home.  It was a little greasy, but what do you expect from some fried dough goodness. The fillings were plenty and the dipping sauces were the perfect compliment.  I actually found myself saying ""Mmmmmm"" after my first bite. And the second.  And the third.  

I also ordered the bacon wrapped dates and they were the perfect combo of sweet and salty.  The blue cheese crumbles also had me begging for more.  I'm so glad it is in my neighborhood because you can bet I will be back again to not only get my fix of bacon wrapped dates, but to try the other delicious dough creations.
