We paid and showed her that more were coming out, pointed at them and she looked and simply walked away. We got out of there fast and DISSAPOINTED!!! never coming back!

I asked about the special for the 12 pupusas for a dollar.  They told me I could only get frijoles con queso (cheese and beans), or revuelta (pork and cheese) only.  BTW I don't like that the mixed (revuelta) is only pork and cheese, its usually pork,cheese, and beans. But anyway no biggie so I got 4 bean and cheese and 8 mixed, so I can get the special. They told me it would be ready in about 20 to 25 minutes. btw I called right when they opened at 10 so they weren't very busy.  When I came in 20 mins later, there was just one table, they were nice, and I waited about two minutes to get the food.  I left and when i got home i dug in.  the frijol with queso pupusas where delicious, but when i got the revoltas (mixed), half of the pupusa was only masa (dough). barely any meat or cheese in the center of the pupusa. I was hoping it was only that one but nope, all of the revueltas had barely anything in there which made it taste just like a thick tortilla. oh well, the cheese and beans was good at least.  also their salsa is good but on the spicier side.  If I am by the area, ill most likely give them another try. and yes i would recommend.",fu2hoswfjPQ6wV-YP-p_tA,0,0,3,JAtzA2aawrooGESJOAQmUQ

1902803,2016-01-10,0,eDK7ns2bB8pmQCoZMy3Idg,"Coming back to the USA after being in Japan for two years, my wife (whose parents are from El Salvador) was dying for some El Salvadorian food.  She read the reviews here and really, really, really wanted to go.  The only problem was that the first night we went, we got here at 1950 and the doors were already locked since it closes at 2000.  My wife was in absolute tears, but we made do at a Tex Mex joint that worked out with giant Margaritas.

The next day, I went with my wife, mom, and dad.  My mom is Japanese and my dad is a big southern white guy - they rarely eat Latino food, and never tried El Salvadorian.  We had the paposa's and they were in love.  My mom ordered the giant fish in garlic and it was by far the best fish she had had cooked ever.  My dad who normally sticks with beef went with the shrimp soup and fell in love.  My wife was amazing happy as my parents enjoyed the food she grew up with.

This place is legit as my wife would like to say.  It made her really happy and although the hours are pretty sparse, the food is definitely home cooked, the coffee tastes good, and the service is nice.  I wish it was a little closer to the strip since we had a $25 cab ride to get there, but it worked out and we are back in Japan awaiting our next time we can go get amazing legit El Salvadorian food.",ATbClROKzPaAfjnq7dT3Yg,3,3,5,4JfJ1zrk-WeB3vhyDxPR5A

3907344,2016-01-10,0,eDK7ns2bB8pmQCoZMy3Idg,"My parents are from El Salvador, so I'm very judgmental when it comes to Salvadorian food. After reading the reviews about this place, I was excited to try this place since I've been living overseas for almost 2 years and nowhere near my hometown for the New Years celebrations. 

My first try to visit this place was a bust since I misread the closing hours; I thought it said it closed at 22:00 (10pm) but in fact, closes at 20:00 (8pm), so when my hubby and I showed up at around 7:50pm, and the doors were already locked...I was bummed. 

We tried again the next day around lunchtime, this time we brought my in-laws as well since they came out to Vegas to see us. As soon as we walked in, and saw the decor celebrating El Salvador, I was pumped; that's the first sign that the place will be great. We were seated and as soon as I looked through the menu, I wanted everything on the menu (going through two years w/o Salvadorian food is rough)! I ordered a couple of pupusas (my favorite is called Revueltas - mixed with pork and cheese) as well as a typical Salvadorian breakfast consisting of fried plantains, sour cream, refried beans, a piece of queso fresco (a fresh, white cheese), and two fried eggs. My only gripe about the meal was that the eggs were cooked over hard (I like them over medium) but other than that, AMAZING FOOD! Reminded me of my own mother's cooking and came close to shedding tears of joy.

My in-laws are not Latinos (MIL is Japanese, FIL is your average White guy from the Midwest) so this was their first time trying Salvadorian food, so I was a bit nervous if they'd like it or not. Their consensus: they LOVED it! MIL ordered the mojarra frita (fried Tilapia fish) done al mojo de ajo (garlic sauce) - she usually skips eating the skin of a fish but she enjoyed the crispy and flavorful skin of this one. My FIL ordered a seafood soup with fish and shrimp and enjoyed it greatly. He specifically said that he loved the fact the soup was tasty without being too fishy. They also tried the pupusas and liked it a lot. Hubby and I loved the pupusas so much, we ordered a dozen to go and had as breakfast the next day...YUM!

I only wish it was closer to the Strip - cab ride was about $25 to get there but was well worth it! If I ever visit Las Vegas again, this will be on the top of my list to visit again.",AmW5t2LjZb2zKKdyztxeoQ,3,2,5,Uah2U3l1tXyvGRlNkq8RwA

Chicken  enchilada was very dry and the rice was dry.   NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!   Horrible never again",X7bkkciK4w5wfAxnJKyTYw,0,0,1,sB0-4HbT4p71uS8o2PTiOQ

It's a good place for sit down or you can order ahead and pick up, either way they are absolutely delish!",8J0O5GCTXAGZNf2uKqstQg,2,1,5,8ne1F-yzp4cTVOGzjAdazw

It was my first time trying Salvadoran horchata and it was pretty good too! My mom and I liked how the horchata had a roasty taste. My mom ordered grilled fish with shrimp and she loved it as well. Overall, amazing food!",Oik-C0Eh9MiOP3j6IRMuSg,0,0,5,JTfeSxumBPLHztlXEMVrAQ
