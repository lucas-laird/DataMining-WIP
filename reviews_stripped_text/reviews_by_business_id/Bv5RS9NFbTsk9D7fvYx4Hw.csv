It was approximately 10:30pm when I was standing third in line. There was one man at the counter ordering and a group of 3 in front of me and a couple behind me. After helping the guy at the counter the employee then said ""last customer, we're closed."" When I googled this particular store it said they closed at 11:00pm. I also called the front desk of the hotel to ask them. They also told me 11:00pm. My friends had already ordered and got their food so as I sat there with them I watched them turn away AT LEAST 25 people. The place was FILTHY! Garbage cans filled to the max, drink station was a wreck, garbage and ketchup all over the floor.",-4qW0c8ZlQox4mS8O00VnQ,0,0,1,veF-iwZwTwOT-3qe5N4inw

The employees were least bothered and not helpful at all, they were rude to all of their customers and used extremely rude language with everyone. Hopefully this will be looked into and taken care off I am very disappointed and disgusted.",XRrzTPoFWIqGlDOsi6K5aA,0,0,1,HJExzqYAUp67UPMbqTstVQ

The service from the beginning sucked the workers are rude. I asked for extra honey mustard and ranch the waitress just looked at me and turned around. When I went to sit down to open my cheeseburger I found a green thing on the top of the bun I was disgusted but I had a weird feeling and I smelled it, i knew right away it was marijuana. I was going to go back and demand a refund but my boyfriend told me to be quiet and just eat. I didn't eat the burger, but ate the fries and luckily the fries were at least crispy.

1701966,2015-07-06,0,Bv5RS9NFbTsk9D7fvYx4Hw,Horrible horrible experience!! I came in with my boyfriend at about 9:30pm and our order wasnt taken until 9:42pm but we didn't mind because there was only one cashier taking orders and big families in front of us. While we were getting our soda we literally heard them call out 402 and our number was 492!!!! Where are these people anyway?? It wasn't even that full to begin with. Long story short we sat for more than an hour to receive our food and the only reason we didn't ask for our money back was because nobody was out in the front except for the cashier and the guy calling out the orders and we didn't want to cause a scene at this time. Never coming back!! You're better off going to the mc donalds next door its just a short walk and you save yourself the hour and a half wait.,2-P0reuG1hrxvQU5ATwiSA,0,0,1,uiJl7SFJXPWeqjePAUqTjQ

A good size, clean, McDonald's. Lots of room to stand and sit; surprising for being inside the Circus Circus Casino. 

It is located at the top of the stairs at The Main Casino Midway. It's at the front of the casino - go up the stairs as you enter from Slots of Fun. 

Helped right away by a delightful, friendly lady.  Received my correct order, no trouble substituting the biscuit for an English muffin in the Big Breakfast platter, zero problem getting ketchup, salt and pepper, etc., and they even have Strawberry Passion fruit drink. You don't see this flavor at too many McDonald's anymore. 

The only issue I had was that my food  arrived immediately, therefore was slightly on the cool side (obviously was pre-cooked). But it was delicious! 

A great inexpensive and convenient alternative for breakfast while staying at Circus Circus.",EevDDorv9uqNHN9zzsXccg,2,2,5,ckaGryhIZb-IeC5zphkPTQ
2240203,2015-06-26,2,Bv5RS9NFbTsk9D7fvYx4Hw,"Out of Ketchup AND Sprite!  The fries were undercooked and mushy.  Place was filthy.  

It is high season in Las Vegas and the place has been there for years.  Having customers should not be a surprise.

I gave 2 stars because I don't like Sprite and there was lots of open seating because they were out of Ketchup!",XULsVUP1HuIxbPzYYyQCrg,1,0,2,PVZEO6Y0N6QvpO3AwR9tCQ
2455977,2016-10-19,0,Bv5RS9NFbTsk9D7fvYx4Hw,"I am a sucker for Big Macs. Sometimes I crave them because I love them so much. We had come to Circus Circus yesterday and today to see the free circus acts (every 45 minutes, near Mcdonalds) and we decided to eat here for lunch. 

There was no line, and my food came out so fast. Like, I've never had fast food that fast haha. I was happy they had Powerade, and tons of seating available. We sat in a half circle table with the comfy seats around it, if you know what I'm talking about. My friend got her kids happy meals and they came in cute Halloween buckets that they are going to use for trick or treating. 

I ordered the Big Mac combo, of course, and was very satisfied. I wish the fries had been a little bigger. The cashier hadn't asked me what size meal I wanted so I assume she gave me medium? Don't really know. Free refills on drinks while you eat there. No fry sauce :( actually I don't think McDonald's in Utah even have fry sauce. But whatever sauce they put on those Big Macs makes my taste buds sing.

Overall, a good experience! Catch a free circus act while you're in the area (2nd floor of the casino). There's a huge arcade too and tons of carnival games. So bring quarters and some cash to play.",eZLolxErzfgEVwC7FapTcg,1,0,4,DNssPIQGChrLCd_PocQV4w

Apparently they expect you to eat in less than 10 minutes cause if it takes you any longer than that they tow your car. Yup on Christmas these assholes had our car towed...$250!

Well I was never called so when I went up to the counter to inquire about my order, the employee was very rude and claimed I was called several times which is a lie because I was waiting at the counter. I had to go back to the counter when I realized those idiots forgot to give me my drink cups and I was scolded that I should've asked for my drink cups when I picked up my food. As I was walking away they were loudly talking $ht about me. UNBELIEVABLE!",PNRxe5s3cNM2Vk74_F3PWw,2,1,1,p8VYSHUeVee6D697bKT43Q

Would not recommend anyone to go here ... Either eat before you go or eat when u leave ..... There is a little turning snack shop right by the McDonald's with snacks I would recommend you go there for a snack and eat after you leave,xjgv4LRX-Oi7xHeVeZul0Q,0,0,1,POYNRaR4wSGLqb8Fp12AAw

Very nice,one of the nicest McDonald's employees I've ever met definitely deserves a higher role. Overall the nightly staff at 10:11 Wednesday night of June 20 was very nice. The only problem we had was that the Sprite tasted terrible, it wasn't even sprite .. who even knows what that thing was we had to dump it out",vK4j7SvaiMaHFvTu0lhXvA,0,0,4,pNKXOLXo9MNmt_aiyiNkew

This place is hands down a favorite place for fast food in the childhood. I love heir nuggets, and fries. Anyways, I ordered fries today and it was overly salty, and the service wasn't the best. 

The employees here seems like they hate their job but it's customer service! I feel like I'll always love McDonald's because it's a childhood food! Won't always be eating it, but I would if I could.",wezBc12GvKwM3NV9_mjpZQ,1,0,3,ssjO7u7Z5mH0S3PAhHPHJQ

The cashier was pretty nice but I think that was the only upside to this expierence. 
They were completely out of ranch and they don't have a ketchup dispenser. Though that was a little weird because every McDonald's has one. When my husband Went to ask for the ranch the lady was extremely rude too.
The fries were hot tho; the burgers were okay. If you're really hungry in the hotel and want something cheap, if recommend this. Other then that. I would say your better off leaving the hotel and going to a different McDonald's.",9umiUnXJaEMhyvbVatLKrw,0,0,2,RvDMpVqyFfBD-WcD7bvxgw

I believe the prices are the same as regular McDonald's locations.  They are not priced higher just because they are located inside a Hotel Casino in Vegas.  So that's a good thing.

There are plenty of tables for seating.  Nice spot to getaway from some of the craziness in the casino and/or children's games.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,2,2,3,R8G7sf9mnT1zqlZsgFjwfQ
