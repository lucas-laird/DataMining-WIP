So I decided to get the mushroom swiss with a veggie burger. SmashBurger needs to work on their veggie burger because while I was eating it, it was falling apart and it was to soft. I noticed that the veggie burger had black beans pressed with some veggies (I hope). 

You have to try their chocolate malt shake because it does have some chunks or chocolate malt which makes it so delicious. Their Smash fries are one of the best fries I have ever tried. I also recommend trying their Sin City Burger (if you like egg with your burger).",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,3,R8LSMC2ep_Es6Yzp6DT6Ew

We waited in line for 20 minutes, then waited another 15 minutes for a salad and one burger with fries. My fiancé's burger was very greasy and the fries were cold. My salad was not much better. It was supposed to have raisins, cheese, seeds, etc. it had maybe 4 raisins and a few seeds but all of the toppings were on the bottom of the salad. The bowl is also oddly shaped leaving it difficult to stir the salad dressing which had just been poured on top. They also only had plastic silverware. We got out of there for less then $20, which isn't bad.

124272,2011-09-20,0,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"I've had many people as for the 'expert's' opinion on Smashburger expecting some overly positive response, and I think every time I answer them they leave disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent burger, but I have my reasons.
For the uneducated, Smashburger is becoming a decent sized chain of 'cheap', trendy burger places so I almost hate to review it, but here it is anyway. They are typically found in strip malls, somehow always located directly across the street from an In-N-Out at every location in Vegas. The décor is nothing to write home about, a big flashy red logo and accompanying signage at the back wall, cheap seating, and minimal treatment to the ceilings and rest of the space. Ambiance is not why you will come here, what will bring you here is the vague recommendations you remember hearing from friends or the intimidating drive thru line across the street at the In-N-Out you were about to go to.
The menu is better than most places I've reviewed lately strictly for the reason that they actually offer many pre-designed burgers to choose from, unlike all the do-it-yourself places that have been popping up all over town. Plus, I believe they have a somewhat localized item on each menu, as they have the Sin City Burger here which I am sure is not offered in their Georgia locations.
The burger itself is decent, the meat isn't too flavorful but I don't expect much coming from a somewhat fast food location. The bun is good, and proportioned quite well to the amount of meat you get. I've ordered the mushroom and swiss burger a couple of times, and have been happy with the fact that the cheese is typically melted, and the mushrooms are cooked well. It even comes out mostly medium-rare as ordered. The toppings on a couple of the other burgers I've tried have also been proportioned well, with good flavor. The fries are tolerable, but become much more flavorful as Smashfries, which are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. They might get a bit too oily, but are quite tasty.
This all sounds good right? Well it is, but what gets me in the end is that it's just a bit too expensive for what it is. I don't think I've walked away from the register without it costing me less than $14 for a meal here, which I think is a bit too steep for a fast food burger meal. This is where In-N-Out wins me over every time, although lots of people argue that the flavor is better here. I'm somewhat on the fence with that, but if I have the choice of spending $6 for a double-double meal, or $14 on a Smashburger meal, it's a no-brainer for me even with the long line. Still, a lot of people speak quite highly of this burger, and it is a good meal no matter what you get, so if you're willing to spend a little bit extra then by all means indulge yourself.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,Sroiyg0HUHhcaOVKkJt23A

My complaint is about the server/cashier Robin. Not only did she not greet me upon my entering, while I was looking at their milkshake selection, she couldn't even pretend to give a crap that I was there. Messing with her hair, and blatantly using her phone right in front of me with her head down and all. Aside from all that, when it came to the actual transaction, she was hasty and unpleasant, couldn't even fake a smile. Once she made my milkshake I thanked her and got no response. I couldn't wait to get out of there because she made me so uncomfortable.

629464,2011-05-02,2,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"I must admit, that prior to dining at Smashburger, I was a little irked, considering that it seems like every Smashburger I've seen has been built extremely close to In N' Out, a burger chain that is extremely dear to my heart (both in terms of sentiment and the plaque building in my arteries because of those damned delicious double doubles).  However, outright audacity aside, I had also been curious for a while, as I'm a girl who enjoys a good burger, no matter the source.  So, off I went.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and my companion ordered the All American Burger.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries and the regular fries.  It did take a bit to get our food, even though there weren't many people there.  I must also say that I wasn't pleased with the prices -- It's kind of ridiculous for two people to spend 18 dollars on hamburgers and fries (we didn't get drinks, either) when it's not even a sit-down restaurant with some sense of atmosphere.  

Anyway.  Back to the food.  I had mixed feelings about my burger.  The BBQ sauce was pretty good, as was the bun.  However, the bacon, sadly, was pretty scarce, as were the fried onions that accompanied the burger.  Also, the patty, while juicy and a good size, was really, really salty, almost too salty for my liking (and trust me, I'm not a gal that shies away from sodium).  I sort of felt like this was a hamburger that I could make myself at home, which also contributed to the feeling of, ""Why the hell does this cost so much"" that lingered throughout my meal.  My companion's burger was fine in the sense that it was what we ordered and in the neighborhood of what I expected, but was also very salty.  The burgers were also pretty greasy, which was kind of a turn-off for me.  

I had mixed feelings about the fries.  The regular fries were fine, although they could have used a little bit more garlic.  The sweet potato fries, however, were a huge disappointment and left me fantasizing about the goodness that is Create's sweet potato fries.  The rosemary just wasn't working for me with the sweet potato fries, and they were so, so oily, that I was pretty disgusted when I worked my way down to the bottom of my fry holder and there was a huge puddle of grease/oil (which, strangely, wasn't the case with the regular fries).

This place was... okay.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great, either.  Nothing really jumped out at me during my visit, and I kind of felt like I'd been had.  I'm glad I tried it, but honestly, for the money I dropped here, I'd rather have spent that money somewhere else (i.e., burger bar, create, bachi burger, etc.).

So occasionally we will indulge in some Smash.  I think the first time I had a burger here I didn't like it.  I don't remember why though.  With an attempt to keep it lower in fat (I know how is that possible right?) I usually order the grilled chicken sandwich so I feel better about myself.   

This place is modern, vibrant and clean.  There is an emphasis on the red with huge red lettering on the walls.  I think it pretty nicely decorated. You walk in and find yourself immediately in line to order.  The menu is located on the wall right before you get to the cashier to place your order.  They have burgers, chicken sandwiches, hotdogs, salads and shakes.  You place your order and then are given a number to set at your table so your food can be brought to you.  The sodas are self serve.

The BF and I both ordered the Buffalo Smashed Chicken.  Its a thinly sliced grilled chicken topped with buffalo sauce, lettuce, tomato and blue cheese crumbles.  The do make a breaded version as well.  I usually take off a lot of the blue cheese because it seems to overpower everything.  Its definitely one of those things where a little goes a long way.  The BF has his on the side all together.  The buns are a little shiny like they are basted with oil or butter.  I could do without the basting.  Overall the sandwich is good I just think it could use a little more buffalo sauce and less blue cheese.  I might try something different next time because I wasn't too impressed this last time.  I dipped mine in ranch hoping to tone it down a bit-but ranch was NOT on the diet plan.

My daughter ordered the kids hotdog with fries.  They split the dog in half and grill it middle side down (if that makes sense).  She says she thinks they do that so there is a little place to put the ketchup-right down the middle.  The fries are nothing to brag about.  They are skinny and really crispy.  I like my fries a little soft in the middle.

I do love condiments and they have a small variety.  I think they need to get creative and add some love into their condiments.  Just saying.  The service was good and everyone was nice.  The place is a little on the pricy side for a burger hot spot.  Our bill was about $30 for lunch WITH a kids meal.  We will be back and probably get the same thing forgetting we weren't too keen on the blue cheese. LOL  Its just a regular burger joint in my opinion. Since they are in my area I'm sure to return.

On a side note - 10% off your order when you check in on Yelp.  Too bad I checked in after I ordered. :(   Oh and they have outdoor seating for when the weather isn't 117 degrees. ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,4,4,3,xxvYxU-csLy29EackkCd8g

Ordered the 1/3lb  Spicy Baja, the bun was dry, the meat  was overdone and flavorless, and the predominant taste was the chipotle mayo. Not too good, in my opinion. 

My husband made the better choice with the Avocado Club burger. His multi-grain bun was pretty good, his 1/2lb burger was juicier, too.

We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were inedible. They weren't crisp in the least bit. Just soaked in oil. A huge disappointment. I'm usually a big fan of sweet potato fries. The haystack onions weren't much better they were super greasy, too.

Today, I placed an online order around 7 pm for a total of 5 sandwiches/burgers and 5 sides, all ranging from regular fries, tots, haystack onions, and sweet potato fries. To my surprise, the order was ready when we arrived, and I watched the team member finish bagging up the order. It seemed relatively slow for a Saturday night in the lobby. 

 We drive home, I start divvying up the bags, and of course, one of the order's sides was missing. We call, they say we can come back and pick up the missing item. The rest of the family eats while we are gone and some liked their sandwiches. 

However, something is going on with portions here. Half of my order was comprised of regular sized burgers, and the others were ordered as ""big"" burgers. The ""big"" burgers were no bigger than a $1-2 burger from any fast food place, McD's, BK etc, but for $7-8!!!

I ordered a crispy buffalo chicken sandwich with no tomato and a cheese substitution, but I wish I had ordered it without the lettuce too, as the piece on this sandwich was brown and more wilted than it could have been just from the ride home. I watched the orders for in-house dining go out from the kitchen window while waiting for our order, and every one had a big, bright green, crisp looking piece of lettuce. Kind of a bummer that to-go orders are held to different standards.

We really wanted to try this place again, and thought the last time we ate here was a fluke, but were reminded that it wasn't.

TL;DR We spent $50 and had to make two trips to in order to correctly receive what we paid for only to be disappointed in the long run.",ROMD11t9rLV-FuNJPRoY1g,0,1,1,MTBdZ7hh0Y7XYfCO_5AUdg

You can get your burger in one of dozens of different arrangements - you can go healthy with a veggie patty (not as good as it should have been) or grilled chicken, or have a fried chicken or a smashed (hence the name) beef patty with any and all toppings. 

Where it really gets fun are the side dishes. Their chili is made from their lean burger beef and is very good. They also have rosemary fries, sweet potato fries, veggie frites (non-breaded carrots, green beans and asparagus pan fried and seasoned), fried pickle slices (my personal fave) and several other choices. Drinks are self-serve so you can have all the refills you need to wash down the goodness.

The fries have been pretty gross and soggy and undercooked everytime, don't like the rosemary and oil on the garlic fries.  I do really like the Spicy Baja Burger, but it is inconsistent.  My husband loves the Sin City Burger. 

It is $30 to feed two adults and two kids with just one order of fries and one drink, so if we really are wanting a smash burger, we no longer waste time/money on the fries and drinks.  I also don't understand why they put each burger into a seperate bag, and then all of those bags into one gigantic bag - perhaps the prices would come down to normal if they wasted less paper, and it would be much better for the environment.   I have to throw so much garbage away when we eat there!

Next time I'll definitely order that. I want to try their shakes as well and all their salads looked delicious. 

I usually feel sick after a greasy meal like this but I actually felt pretty great - I think their quality is much higher than elsewhere and for a pretty affordable price. The portion sizes they give you are also more realistic than other places that give you heaping mounds of food that will probably kill you.

They're definitely going for a bit of a more upscale feeling - waiters bus your tray and the manager asks if you liked your meal, etc. Unusual for a burger joint. Service was prompt but the energy behind it didn't feel very genuine - they seemed a little sad. Maybe because there's not much of an opportunity to tip in a place like this...?

Unfortunately, that night gave an unrealistic expectation of what the chain really serves up- greasy burgers and old crunchy fries. The only thing that seemed to be as I remembered were the sweet potato fries. 

We ordered the large burgers, something I won't recommend as they come on the same size bun- the patty is the only thing that's larger which makes it flop over the side of the bun condiment-less. 

My burger was also served on a tray only half lined with paper, so I had straggling fries. The staff was kind enough the leave the expo ticket on my plate, too (yay fiber!).

I was at the Fresh and Easy that shares a parking lot with Smashburger and decided to treat myself to one of the crispy chicken sandwiches.
I was in line behind a family of 6. They, somehow, managed to feed two adults and 4 kids for about $21.00.
I ordered a build your own chicken sandwich, fries and a nutter butter shake. With my chicken sandwich add ons (bacon, cheese...) fries and the over $4.00 nutter butter shake my meal was about $15.00. The food was good but not $15.00 worth of good. Luckily I had a guest card so my meal was covered.
The chicken sandwich was missing a topping but was tasty. It wasn't as crispy as previous sandwiches that I have purchased and was a little greasy but it was good. The fries were decent and they didn't OD me with so many that I would have to freeze the leftovers. The nutter butter shake speaks for itself. Its a great sweet treat with a little bit of a crunch to it.

2021793,2016-02-20,0,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"My first time trying Smashburger.  I read the reviews about bad customer service. We did not see this. The manager was friendly and got our orders out with 10 or 12 mins. Granted, they were not busy, but I received good service. 

I am glad I tried Smashburger before the place that gives you peanuts to eat while you wait. Because that menu would have cost a two person meal to be $40. Smashburger will feed two people for $20. 

I ordered the Sin City signature burger. It was very good. Defiantly worth the cost. Only thing I would say is the large 1/2 pound burger you can get is really not as big as I thought it would be. But the taste was so good, it was easy to just eat it and not complain. The fries are awesome!! 

I will try it again.",AE5akp1U69ojD_dNqyRBJQ,2,1,4,QH6RofXVKjsjGnc2Sq_yNw
2069226,2011-08-02,0,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"SmashBurger, what's in a name like SmashBurger. On first consideration I thought maybe when you get it to go the drop the bag and step on it: SmashBurger. Or if you get it for dine in the drop your plate in front of you and provide bibs or something: SmashBurger. But certainly it would not be that they smash the burger on the grill, which would be unthinkable, right? Nope, that is exactly what they do.

Anyone who knows burgers knows that you do not smash a burger onto a grill. While you'll end up with a nice brown maillard (pronounced: my-yard) effect crust, this sear DOES NOT lock in juices. If anything it will make a burger taste greasy. If a seared burger is juicy it is because the juices have not had a chance to move out so eat it fast. Also, to get that crust requires a pretty hefty application of some salt so that should be considered. So a SmashBurger has to get on and off the fry surface fast otherwise there will be little left to serve. You will also notice how thin they are, this thinness is required for that speed.

Burger 101 Primer (for those interested): A 1/3 lb. burger patty should be 5/8 inch thick or there abouts (1/2 lb. slightly thicker) and applied to a lightly buttered fry surface (I like about 400 degrees). The rule is you flip your burger ONLY ONCE, hence knowing when to flip is key. Most chefs should shoot for medium rare or just medium doneness. For a medium rare burger you will make your flip when the first juices start to come to the top and run. Flip it and when that same thing happens on the other side you are done (first side is 1.5-2 minutes and the second side generally 30 seconds less). For medium you cook the burger until you see some blood with the juices, then flip and cook till it does the same thing on the other side (first side is 2-2.5 minutes and the second side generally 30 seconds less). In both cases the burgers should rest for a minute before plating. As for anything beyond medium, cook away. If you see totally clear juicy running you are medium well to well done. And if you cook it to where there are no juices at all, well, you have reached hockey puck. At no time do you ever press the burger (that only releases juices that are the goodness) or ""peek"" by cutting into the center to see how done it is. You will notice that this method does not require knowing temps and cook times, just what to expect as cooking a burger and this makes it very effective. Of course what is a burger without a bun.

When selecting a bun for a burger you should find one that is hefty enough for the burger you are going to slide into to it. Your average cheap market bun will be fine for your run of the mill 1/6 pound to 1/4 pound burger. Put anything larger on it and you risk the dreaded soggy bun (because we are looking for a juicy burger). For a larger burger find a bun that is stiffer and be sure to cut the heel thicker than you normally would. In any case, butter the bun lightly and put them open face down on the fry surface until it is well toasted. This is important because this crust will act as a barrier to keep too much of the juice out of the bun. When applying sauces (Mayo, Russian, Mustard, Catsup, whatever) they should be next to the bun (again, acting as a barrier from the hot juice of the burger.) 

Stacking your burger is an art in and of itself and I will let you experiment with your order for burger perfection. But, here is my stack order of a bacon cheddar burger with grilled onions: The heel of the burger, generous mayo, the burger, the cheese, the bacon, grilled onions, always light on the lettuce, a slice of tomato (optional) and then BBQ sauce on the crown bun. Oh that is a good burger. Notice how the flavors are stacked to meld, especially the mayo on the bottom where the juice of the burger mixes with the mayo to make a very tasty sauce. Burger 101 over.

So, we have a ""charred"" burger that is greasy (but that is not all bad) on a bun that holds up (this surprised the heck out of me because this is where most burger joints fail.) As opposed to other chains you can actually taste the burger (but eat it fast for best taste). The sides are slightly kicked up locally sourced product (US Foods, SYSCO (I asked)) which means they are not bad, but like everyone else so there is really nothing to write home about.

Apparently ""clean"" is in these days as the dine-in room was spotless and employees always looking to clean, very nice. And while the store layout is cookie cutter (with a few awkward pinch points in the traffic flow) it is pleasant. The noise level was more than acceptable and you could have a conversation without shouting.

One thing though, like a lot of these new trendy burger places you are going to need to bring some cash. My wife and I dined and the bill was $20.00, and for burgers that is a little high. Still, if I was in the area and wanted a burger for lunch or dinner I may well consider this place again and that should tell you something.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,1,0,4,ATQ6cx_PSER1-iYTWd-mqg

I was shocked by his delivery, I had fries in there & they went all over the place inside the bag. I ordered ranch with my food so I asked him if it was packed in there already just to be sure & he didn't hear me because he turned away so quickly so I asked again & he said ""yeah."" So at this point I'm a little annoyed because my experience started out with 5 stars because of the friendly cashier however because of this cook, I'm giving this place only 1 star. I haven't even got to the worst part..when I got home, I opened the bag, fries everywhere! The burger was wrapped so poorly & messy it looked like a five year old packaged it. Oh and the ranch?

Drop in a side of Smash Fries (thin french fries drenched in olive oil) and the best chocolate shake you'll find in a suburb, and you're good to go. Maybe a Dr Pepper to wash it all down with too! 

 SmashBurger also serves up hot dogs and a few other options if there is something wrong with you and for some reason you don't want a huge wad of man meat in your mouth!

2200012,2016-08-22,1,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"If you don't know how or what to order, this can be a pricey little burger. However, play your cards right, and this will be so worth it! I think the best bet is to do a build-your-own burger. A regular size is plenty big, unless you have a huge appetite. Any of the sauces and veggies are free and you can choose as many as you want. Cheese and toppings like bacon, avocado, grilled mushrooms are extra, from $0.70 up to over $1, so choose wisely.

Personally, I do goat cheese, lettuce, grilled onion, pickles, tomato and smash sauce. Instead of the standard thousand island/ketchup mayo combo/In N Out spread, their signature sauce here seems to be part mustard, part mayo. Doesn't seem as heavy, so I don't feel AS bad eating a burger. I shouldn't be anyway. My doctor said my cholesterol is high....

Anyway, compare this burger which is less than $5 how I have it to, say, In N Out across the street? It's different, larger, and def more options. But say compare this to a much more pricey burger at Ruby Tuesday or Red Robin? Blows them out of the park! Less than half the price of those sit down places, and tastes way better too. Plus service is much quicker, and for cheapos like me, you don't really have to tip unless you want to.

Now if you get chicken, this is where it gets pricey. Around $7 for a yucky grilled chicken breast sandwich, and if I'm going to get a fried chicken patty, well may as well just go all the way and get the damn burger! And the salads? Who the F goes to Smashburger and gets a..... oh that girl over there. Anyway, if you want to add a protein, it's an extra $2 on that. For me, it's an easy choice.

Walking this in and seeing the menu it reminded me of a fatburger. the prices were just like fatburger and the upgrade and add ons were the same as well.

Kind of expensive considering other competitive place. A burger is 4.99, add fries its another 2 bucks and a drink is 1.79. 

I liked that they had sweet potato fries or regular strong fries. The hamburger options weren't too bad. They has pre made options. OR you could make your own with different sauces. I enjoyed they had about 6 or 7 different options. (i.e. ranch, buffalo sauce, blue cheese, or their secret sauce) They also have grilled chicken sandwiches or veggie burgers. They have different options for buns too. Cant forget they have chili cheese hot dogs too. yummm. 

They have fresh shakes that are made from hagn daez (idk how to spell it) like chocolate, root beer floats, etc. I would have loved to try one but i was watching my weight. NEXT TIME!

The salad were 4.99 and to add chicken it was an additional 2 bucks. They had four different options. The harvest, the cobb, the ceasar and a spinach one. The cobb looked best. It had bacon, egg, blue cheese, (i added crutons), chicken, ranch dressing and mixed greens. YUM! It was one of the best salads ive had in a while and it was huge. I took half of it home to my husband. 

Tasting the fries they were the norm (string ones) the sweet potato fries were good. 

My daughter got a hot dog and she really liked it except the seeded bun. Shes not used to that ""fancy-ness"" LOL.

The people inside weren't very friendly. The cashier acted very blonde and constantly had to look up things when we asked her questions about what were on the different combination burgers.

We agree the burgers are good (when we can receive our order correct, which has been never), but the cleanliness of the location always seems to be a challenge. Several times I have witnessed the cashier not only providing table service, but also buses the tables. Dining necessities such as napkins, utensils, and even soda lids become scarce. Trash cans over flow, restrooms become nasty, floors and tables are extremely dirty. 

 The kitchen staff always seems to be in a hurry not to cook the food, but to take their breaks. Food sits in the window for long periods of time and it seem like there is not any relief for the server (cashier). Therefore the food is delivered cold. Matter of fact too many times the burger is warm but the actual meat is cold. As soon as the kitchen staff orders lighten up, they seem to disappear. Sometimes it is very noticeable that there is one person in the kitchen while the others disappear out the back door. Not uncommon to see them from the street hanging out the back door or on the side patio. 

The frustrating problem is that I take a couple napkins off the table, walk over to the soda fountain to wet the napkins with water, always stepping on some part of the sticky floor, and then proceed to wipe my own table down from the crumbs and ketchup.Then it is only convenient for the server to say ""Oh, I am sorry I thought someone wiped down the table."" and then displays a nervous smile. I usually just look back at the server and ask for napkins. 

If it wasn't for my boyfriend and nephew enjoying the food, we personally would not come back. Whether the restaurant is busy or not, customer service and cleanliness is important. I am pretty sure if the front of the restaurant displays complete laziness and lack of pride, then I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. It is obvious that  franchise, manager, and staff doesn't care.",lK-nDdaTfvhuhUowIyOpmw,1,0,2,Q3Is5hh_1KbIJ1C4eOKCDw

BYO let's you choose from several bun types like egg or whole grain as well as proteins such as beef, chicken, or Veggie patties. Top your burger with as many of traditional toppings as you like including cheeses. 

I went with the Jalapeño baja today.  It was ok. I'm not usually a fan of avocado on my burgers and they sure piled it on. It was useful with the fresh sliced jalapeño stacked on top because those sure had a kick.

They serve shoestring french fries and plenty of them.  My basket had a heaping portion that was plenty for two people to share. I like that they have other sides to choose from like fried pickles, sweet potato fries, and Veggie bites which are fried green beans and carrots combo.

2669967,2010-09-05,4,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"Smash Burger you must have a giganotor sized wang to put a location literally 30 feet away from In-n-Out. Which if you have read my previous reviews you would happen to know that I am a self proclaimed burger connoisseur and In-N-Out loyalist, but any way enough about In-N-Out and back to Smash's gigantic throbbing burger dong.  I mean this thing must be huge, brontosaurus like, mounted somewhere at the bottom of the restaurants foundation penetrating deep into the dry, rocky desert soil, sodomizing the earths crust. Where it rest in solitude a sleeping giant waiting for Odins raven to wake it on Ragnarok.

So with that being said out of respect for the sheer girth and size of Smash Burgers wiener I decided to give them a shot and see what all the hype was about.  I was under the impression it was going to be more a long the lines of a gourmet burger joint. Which already put it in a negative lite for me do to the fact that the words gourmet and burger should never be in conjunction with one another. Upon arrival my previous misconceptions went quickly out the window.  My wife ordered the Sin City Burger 1/3 lb patty, cheese, fried egg, hay stack onions and bacon, this beast was pretty damn good.  In lieu of recent events my wife described it as being perfect pregnant lady food.  I ordered the Spicy Baja Burger which was topped with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, guacamole and chipotle mayo. Don't get me wrong it was a decent burger, however there was no ""wow"" factor.  Lets just say I wouldn't order it again.  Good but not great.  Now lets get to the high lite of the meal...DEEP FRIED PICKLES. These things were off the chain.  The serving size was smaller than I would have like to see, however they were still amazing.  

So if you're looking for a better quality burger with more flavor options that your typical sh*tty McDonalds or Burger King, and don't mind paying for it, take a ride to Smash Burger you won't be disappointed. However, with it being in such close proximity to In-N-Out I'll take a double double.",AoII0-uM9z0EesGnb9YCjQ,1,1,4,SthxrGMMs5P5O9TnDBq90A

The smashfries were not bad but the olive oil was a bit excessive, so much that it was dripping off the fries when I picked them up. Thank the stars for absorbent napkins.
The subsequent visit after that was a grilled cheese. Good, but come on, it's a grilled cheese ... And there was one more visit in between that where the dots began before they finally connected.
Now the important visit was my very last time. The reason I say last time is that we are probably never going to go to Smashburger again. The salt, oh my goodness, the salt. In the middle of noshing on my burger, I suddenly stopped and said, ""I can't eat this, it's so salty."" Then I remembered the time before, I had felt so bad after eating. Bing! Light bulb goes off.

We were able to get someone to fix it, but she was very short with us. I believe she was the manager? I didn't get her name. 
It took us about ten more minutes to flag someone down just to get a side of smash sauce and our second side of fries.

Today was the worst visit yet. One example: my order was super simple, a plain burger with pickles, regular fries, and a drink. Half of the burger had...cheese??..thick sauce??.. whatever it was, it was all over it. I ordered the large size burger band cause it used to be just that, large! Not now, it was barely any bigger than the bun itself (a good example of the diminishing quantity I spoke of). Now on to the fries; they used to be delicious and unique to the restaurant, now they're just like you can find in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. The large order was not nearly as big of an order as it used to be. Not only that, it had big pieces of chicken as well as onion rings mixed in with my fries. I could understand if it was a unique occurrence, but the continued frequency of these types of things happening have finally made us walk away and likely not return.

The one thing I have learned from being gluten intolerant is that if you want to judge a burger order it without a bun, because if the meat was not seasoned it is not very exciting to eat a burger. There were a variety of burgers to choose from or you could create your own. I tried the Mushroom Swiss and it did not disappoint. Now this is a burger that is juicy and you can't put it down because it was juicy and oozing all of its goodness!

We ordered the Smash Fries and they had  Rosemary, Garlic and Olive Oil and shared them and they were cooked to perfection and were flavorful.  I love fries and these did not disappoint and next time I want the ones with truffle oil. 

What I liked, they have a menu you can look at as you stand in line so when you get to order you are clear on what you want, that is a nice touch.  By the way you can order a beer to go with your burger! I am a fan of the metal baskets for the fries, it is another nice touch.

A few improvements.... The cashier took our order and before we paid she said she would be right back. Another cashier returned and finished our order and explained that the other one was under . It would have been nice if the young girl explained that in the beginning so we were not left standing dumbfounded. I ordered a water and that line needs to be cleaned or something, the water is horrible! This is beyond Vegas standards. A personal gripe, turn down the music, it was loud enough where it is hard to carry a conversation. This seems to be a trend, and if you are alone with your phone it is good, I would not want to come here and share a meal and try and carry on a conversation.

Let me first mention that combo orders aren't options, so every item you want has to be ordered separately. *red flags*

Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger (regular size): I ordered this with mayo on the side, and I'm glad I did because it was salty. Aside from that the burger was fine without the mayo. The best part was the mushrooms, but the disappointing factor was the ""regular"" size of the burger. It just didn't satiate my appetite, and I engulfed it within minutes. 

Bacon Cheeseburger (regular): This was my boyfriend's order, which he originally put in a request for a ""big"" size, but instead received a regular. The burger's reminiscent  of a Carl's Jr. Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger, but sans onion rings and not as tasty and filling.

Smash Fries: Soggy and thin.

Service - Burgers are ordered up front and delivered to your table. Speaking of which, 
I didn't expect I'd be seat stalking on a Saturday evening. This came as a surprise to me after having eaten here. The burgers aren't even all that, but the place was packed both inside and outside -- to each his own, I guess.  It might be best to take your burger to go or better yet, head across the street to In-N-Out.

It was a Mushroom Swiss Truffle Burger topped with a fried egg, so with the certificates, it only cost a dollar for the egg. SWEET! If you decide to check Smashburger out and you love all things truffle, this burger is worth getting.

Alright. I was delaying my review of SmashBurger since I am pretty certain I am going to be relegated to come here often. 

The service is outstanding. Truly. A gem. In-N-Out-esque; no doubt about it. Now the burgers are another thing though.

So far I have tried four different burgers and they are not In-N-Out-esque. Really, it is unfair to compare since they are completely different, but they are across the street from each other (at multiple locations, incl. Centennial). Yelp check-in offer (10% off) helps a little, but SmashBurger is still strangely over*priced when their competitor has superior, better priced product just across the street. 

I cannot recall which burgers I got when, but what I can say is that they were underwhelming subpar for how much SB charges. And the atmosphere with all the damn school aged children everywhere; not exactly a positive. 

Back to the burgers: 

BBQ, Bacon, Cheddar:
Ordered it with avocado and they thought that meant three tiny slivers of aquacate. Since I got a respectable amount of avocado in the Avocado Club, I figured for the 1$ add-on I would get the same amount. Wrong. It was very cold, as if it was just taken out of refrigeration right before being placed on my bun. Bacon had an obscene amount of fat (at least 75% lipid) and were not crunch in those parts. 

Avocado Club: 
Ordered it with a fried egg (it was cooked HARD with no softness to the yolk in sight) and avocado which was adequate but it's not like they at SB made it. They should take lessons from Fuku Burger on how to properly prepare a fried egg en Burger. 

Sweet potato fries: they are alright. Nowhere near as good as Burger Bar. But a more consistent side to choose than their signature smashfries, in my opinion.  

SmashFries: Sometimes they are better than other times. Sometimes they are way too soggy and drenched in olive oil. Really hit or miss.

Dessert: they don't have any so that's that. 

Maybe their chicken is better, although I doubt it. 

In sum - average burgers, well above average prices. Guess this could be a decent option if you are vegetarian/vegan because of their black bean burger. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,0,0,3,ijb8DUHzIADvFnQ8lcPCeQ

In our town, I would guess the biggest local chain players (besides the obvious) are In-N-Out, Five Guys, and SmashBurger.  All have their merits.  And I have tried all three places at one time or another.  

For me, SmashBurger ends up being just average.  I do like them, but it's nothing overly stellar from other burger joints I frequent.  I don't go out of my way to grab a SmashBurger, it's not something I have a huge craving for.  I'm just as happy going to Subway for a Cold Cut Combo (yes, I'm a cheap Subway whore..ha ha).  Really.  

SmashBurger works just like any other order then sit-down restaurant.  Check out the big billboard menus, pick a burger, pick the size (Smash is 1/4 pound, Big Smash is 1/2 pound), add your sides and your drinks, and you're done.  Sit down and wait for your eats.  Easy-peasy as long as you know what you want.  If you don't, you can create quite the line behind you because SmashBurger doesn't usually have more than two ordering counters.  

The signature burger at SmashBurger here in Las Vegas is titillating-ly named the 'Sin City'.  Figures.  But the burger isn't that bad at all.  Burger patty, topped with a fried egg, applewood-smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions (fried onions), and their smash sauce on an egg bun.  Actually quite delicious...but only when the egg is fried right!  It MUST still be runny yolk on the inside, so it gets on your burger when you bite in and creates a nice little sauce of sorts.  Tasty.  If that fried egg has an overcooked yolk on the inside - return it for a new burger.  It totally ruins the experience with an over fried egg!  You pay $7 for your burger, make sure they get it right.

The other burger at SmashBurger I enjoy is the Avocado Club.  Burger topped with fresh avocado, applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and ranch dressing on a multi-grain bun.  Yep, sounds a bit on the healthy side for a burger, but still good to grind on.  No cheese on this one because the avocado is plenty rich.  Just be sure they include a nice amount, one time we got it and there was only two measly slices on top!  Didn't even cover half the burger surface.

One thing that irks me about some of these burger joints is that they don't include fries and a drink, nor do they have a combo meal discount when you do get these with your burger.  But instead of just fries, SmashBurger offers different sides.  So if you don't want their Smashfries (fries with rosemary, olive oil, garlic - pretty good) or their sweet potato fries, you have options.  Get a side of haystack onions with dipping sauce, veggie frites (yes- FRIED carrot sticks and green beans), or a side garden salad.  I will say though with the drinks at least they serve Coca-Cola, a plus for me.  Not to mention, they have some cheap off-brand $1 canned beers to go with your burger.  With a frosty mug, nice addition!

Because of no fries with their burgers, I sometimes opt for the kids meal.  Yep, I sure do.  Actually not a bad deal.  For $4.99 you can get a Kids SmashBurger with cheese (and any of their free toppings), a small side of fries, and a small drink.  Don't want a kids burger?  Then choose the kid-friendly chicken strips or a hot dog.

Forgot to mention, if you don't want a meat burger, you can choose a chicken breast or veggie burger instead for about the same price.  From what I hear, the veggie burgers at SmashBurger aren't bad.  

As much as I don't mind SmashBurger, it doesn't appeal to me as a real burger joint.  Hate all you want, but I feel like it's a place for burger hipsters!  Multi-grain buns?  Come on now!  When I think burger, I think diner or spoon, greasy, tasty.  It's the American way!  I can get diner from In-N-Out, and I can definitely get greasy spoon from Five Guys.  When I go to SmashBurger I feel like I should be business casual, with a kale shake in my man-purse.  It just gives me Starbucks-hipster-trendy vibes!  Good for you insurance salesmen, obsessive personal trainers, and germaphobes.  

Me?  I guess I'm a bit of a caveman when it comes to burgers.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,0,3,BpFzlt9JCtb30YgUlVVLyg

This SmashBurger is located in Centennial across from Canes.  My last visit at SmashBurger was a little boring since I only got a basic burger.  This time I decided to get their Sin City Burger.  The Sin City Burger is basically a beef patty, onion strings, cheese, their special sauce, and an egg.  Yes, I said an egg.  Did I get fries?  Since I'm already consuming 1300 calories, why not? My burger was greasy and all over the place.  It was filling, but 1300 calories better be filling.  Food was still good, but can't help to feel like I just wasted a couple of workouts in 15 minutes.   

You get what you expect from a fast food burger joint.  Cheap, tasty, and greasy.  Service was good and the burgers are served to you.  I guess I'm a In-N-Out Faithful, especially since their Double Double is half the calories.

When I heard that for a limited time they have grilled cheese I had to get my butt over there and try it out. This location is right near my work and seems smaller than the other Smash Burgers but still looks like your standard Smash Burger. 
So there it was on a sign near the cashier ""Grilled Cheese""
I ordered the grilled cheese that had spinach and mushrooms in it
 (I asked to have grilled onions added also) . Now, right away I knew it looked too oily/buttery. But I started to eat one half and it was still acceptable- it was good but just too darn buttery. When I picked up the other half butter was oozing out of the bread dripping down my arm. I instantly felt like if I continued to eat this it would be my last meal on earth as I would die from a clogged artery or heart attack. 
I returned it and the server gladly without hesitating had my grilled cheese remade correctly. 
They should add grilled cheese to their regular menu normally and I'm not talking about their kid's menu cause grown-ups enjoy grilled cheese also!!!!
So I would recommend having them go easy on the butter and going hard on the love....Awww.....

I had no idea that it was not just burgers.  I only wanted to try the fried pickles though.  The gentleman at the register was super nice to everyone and I heard him being very helpful to each customer in line while I was there and he wished everyone a Happy Valentine's Day.  I did think it was funny that he had $1 in the pen cup so maybe people would tip him but I guess when most people go to fast-food places they don't.  I had no cash on me so I had to pay by credit card for the $3 snack I wanted.  I got home and they were still very hot.  I didn't care for the ranch side so I didn't use that on my pickle slices.  I do expect my pickles to be a bit salty but these were overly salty.  I probably won't come back based on this.

The gentlemen told him it was fine and it wasn't a big deal but A-Juan kept commenting that this was their policy and that if he were a regular cashier they would need a manager to fix it which would hold up the line. The customer said he agreed and told him again it was fine. The guy looked annoyed but clearly wanted to just move on with his night.

He said I needed to order the fries now instead of more burgers if I wanted fries. I told him I had been to smash burger before and was never required to place my food order in a specific order before. He repeated that he needed my fry order now if I wanted fries or I can't get any. I asked him why he was getting an attitude with me and said I can order my food however I chose to. He told me I had the attitude and accused me of raising my voice at him. He said their policy was to order burger, fries, burger because it was easier for them to read my ticket. I told him I've been there before and was able to order all my burgers first with no issues. I was not ready to order my fries at that time.

I give Smash Burger higher marks then ""5 Guys"" because there is something about their burgers that stand out and is unique. I loved the egg buns and the Smash sauce was good, not quite In N Out's spread good but we were inspired to take my Girlfriends Dad back to Smash Burger the next day to try one.

I have eaten here at least a half a dozen times now and it gets worse every time. The biggest problem is the service. The cashiers and servers seem completely disconnected and disinterested. Twice our food sat in the window waiting while the workers were simply screwing around and not paying attention. I'm not sure what they are paying their help but they should think of upping the wage to get some qualified people. Pretty sad. Not sure I will be back.,uzReH7zIh5tJX9ICBgTwNQ,1,0,1,cwwazjypZcF836DdoqonaA

After reading some of the previous reviews I could agree that they had their share of the ""newbies"" at this store. In the beginning I think they were working out the bugs and service and food quality was not where it is today. I ordered the Baja 1/2 lbr now twice. I do like this burger because I am a spicy food fan and it is pretty darn good. I believe the 1/2 lb is the way to go as the burgers are much juicier. The last time in I had the Sin City which is now my favorite. Again I would say the 1/2 version to avoid running into a dry burger. The wild card seems to be the Smash Fries. It really depends on the time of day as to how good they come out. I am running about 50/50 good to bad. If you are blessed enough to get a fresh batch then the olive oil/garlic/rosemary fries are great. But if you get them in the middle of a rush or a slow afternoon while they have had a chance to sit...not so good. My wife always grabs the Mushroom/Swiss burger and I always sneak in for a bite. It is also VERY good. I have not run into the greasy issue that has been claimed in previous reviews (mainly because we always dine-in rather than attempt to bring home one of these big ol burgers) Overall they are improving but really would like to see them consistant across the board.

For as busy as the place was the line moved quickly. We placed our order which was for one bacon cheeseburger and a truffle mushroom burger. Along with two kids meals for my children which they had to verify existed before even allowing us to order. My daughter was sitting saving our seat. I pointed her out . I guess if you don't have children they don't give you fries and a drink with it. I found this out the hard way when my son's food didn't come with French fries. They quickly corrected the error but it still was strange. The main reason I didn't give 5 stars was my daughters milk shake came out after people who ordered behind us and it was in a TO-GO cup when we were eating there and she would have preferred the fancy cup that she saw coming out with other orders. It was upsetting but the burgers were delicious and cooked to my satisfaction.

The first was forgivable as they were actually pretty busy with a sports team of kids and parents. I get it, in a mad rush sometimes you don't get to everything right away and if you aren't great a time management, you'll sink. The 2 times after that it was not busy and the cashiers were just lollygagging about. Tables sat dirty for a long time, if they cleared baskets it took a while to wipe and wasn't thorough, there was stuff all over the floor. I got out a wet wipe because there was crumbs still on my table. If  I can sit there and have a whole meal and tables sit unbussed, there's a problem. I asked for a sauce to dip my fries but towards the end I ran out of some so I decided to finish with ketchup. The bottle was crusty. Sure, a customer did that and sometimes you follow a messy person....so I got the bottle at the table next and it was like that too. I do not think they wipe down their bottles on the daily like you should.

Smashfries ($1.99): Full Disclosure here - the fries can be hit or miss. Sometimes they're drenched in oil and other times, they're perfectly delicious. It is what it is! 

Customer service is always exceptional. 

Smashburger can get a little pricey for a burger joint, but here's some pro tips on how to get more bang for your buck:

* This location has a military discount! Show your ID and you get free fountain drinks
* If you fill out the survey on the bottom of the receipt, you get a free side
* There's a yelp check-in offer for 10% of your order
* If you join the Smashclub, you get emailed coupon offers to save $$
* If you enter your phone number at the register, you get points. Once you reach 100 you get a free burger.

5336980,2012-02-22,0,lKH_cqeaeVpHdsO2dK58OA,"was in the area so decided to check out Smashburger.  I went in before the lunch rush so can't judge how the service was, the place was empty around 11am. Looked clean although there was some noise going on - an employee banging on something, have no idea what it was, a machine or icemaker or something.  Who knows?  Anyway, I chose the BBQ burger with bacon and cheese. Regular size. Also had a side of haystack onions. Order was done quickly and took it to go.  Okay, here's my opinion on this burger.  I liked the bun - a nice change from the typical fast food bun, so that was nice.  The bacon had a nice flavor, and I thought the burger itself was well balanced in terms of BBQ, cheese and onions (maybe a bit low on onions but not too bad).  Here's the bad part:  my burger was pink in places. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and definitely would have had it well done as I do NOT eat hamburger meat with ANY pink in it whatsoever.  (and yes, a burger can be cooked well done without drying out, if I can do it at home for myself, a professional cook ought to be able to).  So, I was unhappy and grossed out by the pink areas. Various people have said the food is greasy.  I didn't find that to be a problem.  In fact, I like a burger with a bit of grease sheen, so that was a plus for me. I did find the haystack onions to be on the salty side.  Not horribly so but a bit more saltiness than I would like (was rather thirsty after finishing the meal).  The meat itself in the burger didn't taste all that wonderful.  Just so so, a bit more quality than a typical fast food McD's type thing, but not soooo much that it knocked me out.  There were bites that just didn't taste that wonderful.  And every now and then the haystack onions had a bit ""off"" flavor also (like old oil).  Would I go here again?  Probably not.  If they lowered everything on the menu by a dollar, maybe.  I understand what they are aiming for, a somewhat higher quality burger than fast food, but until they can cook a burger without leaving pink in it, I would never eat here again.  It's a shame because they are on the right track somewhat, but like so many places, they aren't quite there, and in this economy, leaving with a bill of over $8.00 for one person, for two items, is probably not going to bring back a lot of people.  They seemed friendly from the way I was greeted, so no complaints there, but like I say, it was early in the day and no one else was there.

I had to do a layover on my way to Georgia and stayed at a friend's house.  I asked their daughter where is good to eat and she brought me here.
I was amazed. Californians love In-N-Out but I'm not a die-hard fan of them. I can take or leave them. Smashburger by far surpasses In-n-Out in my book. (sorry fanatics)
The burger was juicy and big. The seasoning was unique. The fries were yummy. I had a chocolate shake and it was nice and thick.

I walked into the store after a 4 year hiatus and thought I would get a Black Bean Burger for an early dinner and a change of pace. The girl behind the cash register looked at me with a scowl and said to the male worker standing beside her I cant serve him while making some type of gang sign with her two hands as she was stating that to him. He looked at her and said I'll serve him and he did, I was puzzled by what her problem was since I've never seen her before or spoke to her before. I placed my order of a Black Bean Burger with Blue Cheese, Chipotle Sauce and Dill Pickles and an order of Smash Fries, paid, then got my cup for my drink, filled it, sat down and waited. About 15 minutes later the waiter came and got my number 50 placard and went to get my order. He brought back a regular Beef Burger with everything else and I asked him then, is this a Black Bean Burger? He looked at it and said sorry I should of looked at the ticket, I said that's cool and waited again as he went to fix the order. He brought back the correct burger. I bit into it and noticed that it was barely lukewarm and not hot at all, I thought to myself was this going to be safe to eat and took the chance. I ate the lukewarm burger and the fries, finished my drink and left. About four hours later I got severe abdominal pain and didn't feel well, I went to bed, and then woke up the following morning with a sore throat and headache on Easter Sunday. I went to the emergency room doctor, she asked me if I've been exposed to strep throat recently, not that I know of but I ate some bad food yesterday, she diagnosed me with pharyngitis and gave me a Z-pac of antibiotics to take for the next five days. So needless to say I won't be coming back to this or any other Smashburger from now on. I'll do the standard In N Out that's right across the street, always quality and always satisfied or travel another couple blocks and hit up a Tommy Burger for my monthly splurge.

Just a heads up Smashburger; If you leave food out and it cools, or barely heat it, it will collect bacteria and it WILL get a customer sick. I'm lucky I'm a veteran and I can go to the Veterans (VA) Hospital. It costs me very little, just $8 for the prescription and $35 for the Emergency Ward. For a Non-Veteran doing that would amount to a major expense in this day and age....tighten up your food handling practices or lose more customers.....and educate your female counter staff, the one I came in contact with needs a check-up from the neck up.",CfKU7wqDmAi2N48eCJhiVA,2,1,1,nUeKw4pE1uy-tJdMxkGX_A

The service was slow and terrible.  After sitting for 15 min, I come to find out that my order was one burger short - my daughter's burger was missing.  (Thinking back, I realize that the cashier had failed to repeat my order back to me which I felt I had clearly stated.  Isn't this food service 101?). No concessions of any kind were offered other than a dull apology - not even an offer to expedite an update to the order for the missing burger.  At that point, I was so frustrated I just asked for a refund which also took quite a long time to process.  Furthermore, it appeared that another patron one booth over was experiencing a similar problem.  Bad news..  It seems like the staff are either new, undertrained and/or suffering from extended New Year's hangovers - they exhibited a general lack of concern for providing a good service experience and little sense of urgency in terms of valuing the customer's time.  Managament, please train your crew better!  I took my business across the street to In-N-Out and don't plan on returning to your establishment.

My husband ran in to check and that's where we found out that they were actually dog friendly. We had to sit outside, which there was no fuss of and we ended up ordering 2 cheesebugers for ourselves and Mistral ended up having their ""fidoburger"" which is just an unseasoned beef patty with lettuce. Needless to say, with her, that didn't last long. She absolutely enjoyed it, same to say with my husband and I's dinner. I'm usually not a big stickler for fries, but they were still pretty good.
