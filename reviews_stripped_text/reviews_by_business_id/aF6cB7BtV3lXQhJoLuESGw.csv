There was 6 of us here we shared 3 different molcajete two were a mix of seafood mostly shellfish crab, oysters, shrimp,and lobster the other one one was shrimp chicken and steak they all had salsa and cactus also served with rice beans and your choice of tortilla. Like I said food great I also had a octopus cocktail it was great. My experience was ehh less then ok ill give the employees a taf bit of slack it was very busy but you absolutely as a server always advise your guest of an automatic gratuity even if you want to be shady and tell your guest sorry you didn't hear me I told you. ARE SERVER FAILED TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT GRATUITY! After doing the math when I left I thought there was a mistake I hurried back well unfortunately for me there wasn't a mistake I was told theres a gratuity added automatically to party's six or more we should know because its that way at every restraunt I promise this is what the gentlemen that works there told me when I asked can you show me where it says that in the menu I was told it didn't say it in the NEW MENUS! So people who read this be advised thete is a AUTOMATIC GRATUITY!! For party's six or more no you wont know like me because its not reflected on your hand written receipt and if your like me you will tip based of this amount so be advised. The server did give us are MONEY back for the gratuity that was 35 and we let her keep are 35$ tip so good luck hope your experience is different then mine minus the food part",guDQoyNiyn3JEi49J59d8A,0,0,2,E5HLpAXgZEa1Dem-clKBwA

Coworkers and I tried this place out for lunch. One of them was raving about how great it was. And I am always one to try new things especially seafood. 

Restaurant itself is spacious and clean. Inside you can buy fresh seafood. We sat down and waitress came to our table. I don't like how she didn't address us in English. Only one of us knew Spanish :-/

They serve chips and salsa on the house which was nice. It was very tasty with the right amount of spice. I ordered a langostino dish - don't remember the exact name. Refer to the pic below. It was served with rice, beans, salad and tortilla. The dish overall was ok. Edible but there was something off about the taste. Maybe I was scared to break out which was what happened to my other coworker the last time he came so I had some trepidation about my meal. (He had shrimp in a prior visit. He avoided it this time around)

And the tortillas tasted weird. I don't know if it was homemade or cooked in lard but I only had one and it was enough to keep me from wanting more. 

I don't see myself coming back. The price overall was decent (it was paid for LOL, but I wouldn't come back and pay on my own).  I'm not sure if I'd really recommend this restaurant due to its location and overall average experience.",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,0,0,2,-96z4o3wNifiUcEsiiolIQ

I told him politely that I have been waiting for 5 mins or more for my drink order and if he could let someone know. He asked me in a rude way ""5 mins?"" I then replied back ""Yes 5 mins or more"" (side note we waited 20 mins I didn't realize it had been that long until we left and I checked the time from messages I sent when I first got seated.) and he said okay go have a seat someone will help you when they can. I got the impression that he didn't care so I asked again if he could get someone to at least take my drink order to which he replied back ""I already said have a seat and wait longer"". I went back to tell my husband we were better off leaving and he was then telling the host about me and to check if we even had an order to which he called me that ""American"" senora (as we were walking away) he wanted to know if we owed any money and then pointed at me.  The host came back and I tried to tell her that I had been waiting for over 5 mins (we waited 20 mins from 5:52pm when we got in to 6:18). The host told me to hold on and walked away.

If you are a seafood lover you'll fall in love twice, wait is that even possible? And if you are not a seafood lover I have to warn you the content is dangerously in love.
My favorite plate is the Molcajete. No other place in The Valley has the tastiest, most chingon (coolest) in town.
They have five different types of Molcajetes depending on your preference. The Molcajete Apache, which has pork ribs, the Azteca which has steak, chicken and chorizo. The Molcajete ranchero which contains steak and chicken. And the killer Molcajete Volcán cuidado! 
It has crab, shrimp, octopus and Prawns. You can also order Tacos or Botanas. Botanas are their specialty, they are plates with different kinds of shrimp combinations. To mention are few are shrimps consentidos, shrimps al vapor or camarones locos. Don't forget the famous cócteles de camaron (shrimp cocktails) oysters, and prawns. The envious seven sea soup, and save the best for last. The Aguachiles. Only the aguachiles served here meet my expectations. The hard part is choosing which of the five you will eat, the loco is my preferred. Visit the seafood Maximus and you'll realize the value of this place, you won't find a replacement.

3743317,2015-09-12,0,aF6cB7BtV3lXQhJoLuESGw,"I ate at this restaurant last weekend for my father-in-law's birthday and spent over $200. From the moment we sat down, the service was terrible. Perhaps that is because for large parties, this establishment automatically adds a tip onto your bill. We were there for almost 2 hours, yet our waiters and waitresses never came by our table to check on us, when we would ask for a drink refill, they wouldn't bring it, they messed up our order and overall, they seemed more attentive to the smaller tables. I couldn't believe that a restaurant has the audacity to charge a large tip onto an already large bill without providing any hospitality or service that would warrant such a charge. I would never come here again. The food was good, but when you and your party blatantly get ignored, at least for me, that discounts my whole experience.

And for everybody going here with a large party (good luck with the service) - the automatic gratuity added onto your bill is NOT mandatory for you pay. Effective Jan. 1, 2014 the IRS held that these automatic charges ARE disputable. This automatic gratuity does not fit its definition of a ""tip""; therefore, feel free to tell your waitress to take it off.",EfYS1Cnm7P3Rbm83QefWXw,0,0,1,cFuvsRxf1SsmMLVYLXjkVg

I started my search on yelp for a good place with good reviews. This place showed to be great in both pictures and reviews. Prices were high but I thought due to such praise on Yelp, that it would be worth it. 

We are a family from Mazatlan Sinaloa so we expected good food. As soon as we entered, there was no greeting and no seating. We brought a cake of our own so that was nice of them to store it in their fridge. Let me just say everything after that was pretty disappointing (service that is). 

It's Memorial Day and we expected ALOT of people eating out so we were patient but it took FOREVER to get our our order placed. I felt bad for BOTH waitresses. Yes only 2 girls who where running around like headless chickens. Sorry but 2 people to wait on a full restaurant was not enough. 

The food was very tasty but very pricy as well. I was shocked when I heard that one can of soda was $2.50! In our party there was 6 adults and 5 children. Our bill came out to be over $200 with tip included. Now I heard directly from another restaurant (olive garden) that it was no longer legal to include a tip on a bill of 6+ people. Is this true and if so why did they Include it? I was ok with food taste but not with the service. I don't believe they should tip themselves!
