Employees there recognize me and they are always polite and friendly. But recently they hired a new employee, and thereafter received one of the worst customer services I've ever experience. She gave me attitude for her forgetting to unmute her Mic, and proceed to rush my order. I specifically requested no condiments on my order and she placed them on the screen. But there they were, unable to eat what I ordered due to allergic reaction's. I'd forgive any of that due to accident or having a bad day.. but at the drive-through window during payment it took them seven minutes to get my card back. It wasn't even the lady who took my order who gave me my food! She got another person and left halfway through the transaction! 3:15pm, 9/17/2017. I will no longer be coming to this location until there service improves.",PtuPotgg2h8YZdTpw6Z6BA,0,0,2,32eozygcW7G2tvNlhNXUug

Thats important when dealing with the typical teen-age employee who has a hard time remembering his own name, let alone an order for food he/she has been trained to prepare.  The only creepy thing was there was an actual he/she working the drive-thru window.  I'm pretty sure it was a dude in full chick make-up.

1562424,2016-10-09,0,e8aRJbv2EMH5DqMzbDK8wQ,The worst customer service I have ever received here. My boyfriend stopped by here on his way home from work. Told the employees that I am highly allergic to tomatoes so everything had to be tomato free. Got home and there were tomatoes mixed in all of my food. I called to tell them. The girl was rude. Would barely let me speak and was defensive as I tried 4 times to tell her that tomato had gotten mixed in with the lettuce and cheese. She wasn't going to do anything about it until I asked well what are you going to do about the food I bought and can't eat. Then she put me on hold for the second time.  She wouldn't tell me her name. Finally got her to agree to  remake my food. Unbelievably rude. I will never come back here. Now I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come back with my food again. If I do have an allergic reaction I will sue them,nnZV1bylDKdjFpZN-8JtNA,0,0,1,BHH2xZSca-yR8cZ_sZOiDw

This is the 4th time ive tried to use something from the Ap and been unable to. Each time they call same lady manager, short, dark hair. She said this tome it was on a 25.00 or mire purchase. The cpn caps at 10.00 and thats all it says so again I received nothing for my 20.00 order when according to my Ap, i was eligible for something. Im iver going to taco bell now. Im deleting the ap and going back to del taco.   This location knows NOTHING about customer service. I waited a month to eat here after my last drama but the only thing they changed was the drive thru person. Shes a gem, keep her get rid of that nasty manager who tries NOT to even give you your free frozen drink which is on the ap this month. Never was able to get my free taco last time!

The Mexican pizzas are incredible as are the Doritos Los tacos. Try the Gordita crunch as well as the cheesy fiesta potatoes. Nachos Belgrade is legit as well.

I'm going to add to this I called the corporate office they called me back and they were very apologetic and also said there is no corporate regulation against wearing your hood or your hoodie. Again the food was very fresh very good I felt the attendant didn't really appreciate me and I thought it might have something to do with my ethnicity.,_i-joRZc2-d5VzgI-j3PCA,0,0,1,yUv4345c5NvF6UsZHVZTAg

I ordered a ""Doritos Los Tacos Supreme"". This has to be the best invention at Taco Bell ever! It was delicious. 
The store was clean and the cashier friendly. I didn't visit the bathroom.
I see they have a ""Big Box Deal"" that the cashier says changes each month.  This month it included the Doritos Taco and other goodies. I wasn't able to eat a big meal knowing I was going out to dinner in a couple hours or I would have tried that.

Usually your to go orders are correct and they never skimp on sauce and napkins. I love that. Hate how other fast food restaurants don't supply those things unless you ask or are stingy with their napkins. 

This location is pretty good. Today they forgot one of our tacos and that was disappointing. Yes, it was only a $1 taco but who doesn't want their order to be correct? Plus the drive thru attendant wasn't very friendly and was a bit weird. He asked to see our ID with the credit card, totally understandable, but then meticulously checked the ID to a point where it felt like he thought we were thieves. Usually a quick check of name on the ID and a photo comparison does the trick but nope he did more than that. Just strange. Didn't help that he didn't use this meticulousness to check our order for correctness. Yeah, I'll probably be back because I love me some Taco Bell but I'll probably double check my order next time around.",BpJWttiu9h5cgxtVkQZGXw,2,2,3,0jTl3cpQ_xIl7MRHbYjDwA
