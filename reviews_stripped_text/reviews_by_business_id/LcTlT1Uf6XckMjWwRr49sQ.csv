7278,2016-06-03,0,LcTlT1Uf6XckMjWwRr49sQ,I went to order on Tuesday 1 bagel and waited about 10 minutes about 4 people getting there orders and i only order 1 for the first time at this store.  then went the next day and a lady was waiting for her bagel she said for about 10 minutes people passing her up i told her same thing happen to me at this store. Today i went to get another bagel for my husband and i decided to order one for me and they give me the wrong bagel and i work 10 minutes from the place and have to be at work on time and its frustrating to open your bagel and get the wrong bagel. They have at least 5-6 people on staff and seems like they don't know what is going on.  I have to go to market buy my bagels and toast at work now. the bagel shop was on Summerlin Cheyenne by Albertsons store. I got to work to call them they gave me the wrong bagel and phone rang at 8:50am 10 times on one answer and  i called the catering ext and they are going to send a request to the store for me.,0Cd37WMp6zoRXjPPVYhKHQ,0,0,2,rquUxTXjkwUWNlS1d8hDrA

I came in for the dozen bagels for $7 and when I walked in they had no more then 2 or 3 flavors available . They had not one drink option displayed or cream cheese like they are supposed to .

I'm not sure why they didn't already have that going since they didn't have any bagels displayed ! So we waited for our turn in line to pay and there was a couple in front of us and a huge line behind us . As workers were walking by doing other things it took them 10 min to finally ring up the couple In front  of us . When it was our turn they didn't even have the right order.

We waited another 25 min and when I see other customers receiving their dozen at the time of order I was very displeased . I finally went up to the front , and asked when ours were ready .

One person finally asked if I had been helped and proceeded to take my order. My order was prepared but he walked away without taking payment and said another individual would take payment. Was given my sandwich and I had to tell them I still haven't paid. He kept yelling to a female. She finally came up front to take payment. When I commented on there disorganization there was no apology.
After I ate the sandwich I was still hungry so I went back in for the same order -apple smoked bacon, pepper jack, 1 egg and cream cheese on an onion bagel.
I went to the same register I went to the first time. I kept looking at the employees and nobody acknowledged. Other customers walked in the door. The light bulb finally went on as I had not seen the sign before where I was originally standing under said pay here. It should have been a ""duh"" moment but in all my experience this setup is backwards from most other stores which they have the ordering counter up front after you walk in the door. Well being this is my first time in this store imagine my surprise. Regardless of my ignorance about the backwards setup, an employee should have acknowledged and pointed that out to me. So I stood in  the proper line to order and the man behind the counter was pleasant and took my order and then of course I went to the pay here register.
Overall the experience was poor. It cost me $5.40 for the first sandwich and $6.90 for the second. Why the price difference for the same sandwich?  Well the first time I asked for cream cheese after they took my order so I was given a side. Little did I realize they charge$1.50 for cream cheese. What a ripoff. 
So in total I paid  $12.30 for breakfast. The next person who says fast food is cheap should think again.",gMMsJxNIZ4FM48kIobwYtg,0,0,2,ZMdc7_mPBbk4xAU0iGVNeg

So many times they have run out of bagels early in the day.

How do you constantly run out of plain bagels....and I'm talking by 10am.  This morning they didn't have any left and it was 8:30am.  They just look at you like it's your fault.  And I can't tell you how many times I've gotten home and my order was incorrect. Employees and managers there just come and go....there's no longevity. When at all possible I go to the Lake Mead location or the Centennial Hills location.  Both are so much better run.

I've been coming to this location since they opened,  at least 18 years ago, I can't even remember it's been so long. Recently something has changed. The customer service is horrible, the food is mediocre and the place is dirty! 

I went in last Sunday and after this experience I will go to another location from now on. There is a young man that works there with red hair, his name starts with a J. The name tag was smeared so I couldn't make it out. He was making the food and wearing gloves but he kept touching his hair and face with the gloves on and then touching the food!!!! That's disgusting! He has longer hair for a guy and kept sweeping out of his eyes and touching his sweaty face. That's definitely a health code violation. The food trays are nasty! They look like they haven't been washed in months. Half of my bagel didn't even have cream cheese on it.

The employees are lazy. There was a huge line and one female employee decided it was time for her break. When there is a line out the door you don't just go on break. 

The manager is completely rude. She has a Russian accent. The ice lever on the soda machine was laying on the side of the machine. I went to tell her the ice machine was broken and she said ""no it's not, push harder!"" I told her there is no lever and she gave out an angry sigh and went over to the machine. She saw the lever and said ""oh my god! Who did this!!! Who did this to my machine?!?!"" So rude and inappropriate!! Such an angry woman shouldn't be a manager if she can't be pleasant to the customers.

I go next door explain to teller why I need change who shares the bank employees will not even go there anymore because of poor customer service. I return to shop and pay the girl gets an attitude with me saying she is working and can't possibly walk next door for change.

I love bagels.  I like the selection they offer and the espresso drinks as well. 

Yes the service is a bit slow, yes they have messed up my order but you know what? They fixed their mistake without any attitude or rolling of eyes. I like that. And you know what? Friendly goes a long way. How can you be mad at someone who apologizes for their mistake and fixes it right away? You can't, unless you are a monster.

The bagels are good, always perfectly toasted and buttered. The staff takes awhile to make drinks, maybe they don't make a lot of lattes or maybe they need to brush up on their faster pace skills. The drinks take FOR-EVA...but they are always tasty.  And it seems that the specialty feature lattes are constantly changing and I order those, so maybe it's a ""how do I make this new drink?"" Issue and not a pace issue. 

Now I said everyone here is nice. I meant that except for one employee.  Guess who that employee is?  Oh it's the GM!! That woman is a B rhymes with witch. I was in utter shock when I found out that this unpleasant individual was the GM!! 

Scenario: I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my person. It's a Saturday at noon.  The bagel pickings were slim and they still have four more hours until close. Is anyone making bagels?  Bueller? Bueller? The associate starts to make the smoothie and realizes oh there are no bananas. Who used the last banana? Hint: whoever used the last banana could have said ""Hey we are out of 'naners!"" And someone could have WALKED across the parking lot to Albertsons to get more because not sure if anyone read the beverage menu board but STRAWBERRY BANANA SMOOTHIE is a prominently displayed drink choice. You need bananas for that and conveniently a grocery store is right there, like right there!!! My person doesn't want just a strawberry smoothie or a mixed berry smoothie. So I asked to just get a refund. They call over the person eating their lunch in the store which brings me to, hey you are kind of busy, think you can jump in and help instead of stuffing your face ignoring the fact that there is a line??? This person (a woman) goes to give me change and I said wait can't you put it back on my card? I paid with a credit card. She says oh I forgot to ask you if you wanted it on your card but I already did it and I am going to give you change. So I asked her if she would put it on my card since that is an option. She sighed very heavily, rolled her big, stupid eyes at me and went on to charge me for another drink on my card and had to void that one plus return the first one. In my head I was thinking, if this place wasn't around the corner and if everyone wasn't so nice I'd never come here again if this were my first time here. I didn't know that was the GM, they went and sat back down after ""helping, not helping"" me. I was appalled, there was still a line and cream cheese tubs in a bus bucket teetering on the cooler edge that needed to be put out and displayed, but they got busy and the employee doing that task jumped behind the counter to HELP. You'd think the GM (who I didn't know was the GM at the time) would maybe take the what 3 minutes it would take to put them away instead of sitting back down to eat? 

I went in today and the nice manager with the long blonde pony tail, I wish I knew her name...was there.  I thought she was GM she's always helpful and pleasant and I wanted her to know, listen you have a manager here who isn't exactly welcoming, you need to coach her on her people skills because if I wasn't a regular and didn't know that it's normally a pleasant experience here, I'd never come back.  She told me that woman was the GM. My mouth involuntarily fell open in shock. I couldn't believe it. The GM is acting like that? Wow. And I noticed a we're hiring sign on the window.  It makes me wonder who would want to work for this woman? Are they having a hard time keeping employees? If you treat a customer like she did me and she thought that was acceptable behavior what does she treat her employees like. I felt bad for the entire staff.

I hope the GM sees this. (Maybe customer service is not your forte...or maybe you need to work very hard on your people skills, I get the impression you are new, if you need some coaching on how to deal with people please respond to my review and I will be happy to set up a time to get together to go over basic customer service behaviors with you.

It's amazing what a turn over in staff can do for a business. After coming to this store for the past few years and having a good experiences almost every time, I'm sad to report this store has gone down the drain.

The bagel sandwiches are thrown together as if they were slop from a pig trough. The bagels had fallen apart once opened and the meats were cold.

My last experience, I was the only one In the store, however the 4 staff members behind the counter were more interested in talking about what they were doing that night. After ordering I waited a good 15mins for 2 bagels then another group came in and order around 8 items. 30mins later the people who ordered after me received all of there items before me!

The manager wasn't much help and said ""oh sorry, have a nice day"" 

I use to like this place, but now I'm done.
The staff before I think all got promoted to other stores. Big shame.",JlwWHBFT76iSJe5mWIcZ4A,3,3,2,WQIHGeOFw5GfotBUiVK_RQ

They have a wide variety of bagels including some of my personal favorites, jalepeno cheddar and asiago cheese. They have a new pretzel bagel which my mom loves too. Shmear is their fancy name for cream cheese and my favorites are strawberry and the jalepeno one. They have low fat options and even a light menu for breakfast and lunch options. I suggest getting there earlier in the morning when the bagels are right out of the oven and they have more options because nothing is worse than them not having your favorite bagel. 

The luck dozen boxes are fairly priced and are great for work parties or special events. I personally like getting two shmears so that everyone is happy. Also the coffee is pretty good but their fresh squeezed orange juice is great!

Definitely kudos for ease of locating a store nearby, lots of locations to pick from and having pre-packs to grab and go. I ended up getting two 13 bagel assorted packs with 4 tubs of shmear (ooh, pumpkin) and a coffee carrier for the group. 
Walk in, door chimes, nobody at counter. Kid restocking straws and forks doesn't flinch. 
Another lady walks in, door chimes. No reaction. 
Another customer walks in, door chimes. ZERO reaction. The three of us get huffy and foot tappy, finally a frazzled girl pokes her head out of the back, alerts the clueless kids to assume the position and they start going through the line. The order/payment process was simple as well as collecting the bagels, but getting coffee and all that together was a process. 
 Longest part of the experience, by far, was getting cups, sugar and creamer together, as I foolishly asked if I can run bagels to my car. That warranted stopping my order from being processed and another customer inserted, so upon returning I had to wait for his drink to be made before I could get my hands on aforementioned cups and such. 
 Now, I totally get this is all my fault- I've previously ordered ahead for meetings via the Einstein website and my experience was ridiculously seamless- walk in, it's all right there ready at requested time, packaged and neat, grab and go.
