The service, on the other hand, is pretty awful.  Not remembering questions about the ingredients in food (allergy thing), yaking with a coworker that just approached instead of taking an order, etc, ad nauseum, it got pretty bad.",mflbUKi6iICR43rWWBO53Q,0,0,4,K9Jis9AQTyqoUyquQbNOlQ

I had the cowboy-cut ribeye steak.  I will dream about this meal!  The only reason they're getting 3 stars is because they shorted me on my take-home.  We spent about $300 for two steak dinners. I ate only half of the meal. They took my plate and brought back the take-home container.  I should have checked it.  Later on when I opened it up, they only put one small piece of the steak in. The sides, veggies and a large amount of steak were missing.  My half of the meal was $150 and they didn't even let me take the uneaten food home.  I can maybe once a year afford a meal like that.  I figure half my meal cost about $75.  Can you afford to just throw that money away?  If you can, then this is a great place to eat.  If  you can eat an entire steak meal in one sitting, then this is a 5-star steakhouse.",ndpv0rwNoINxRMk2gsUJLA,0,0,3,KnfJAzpHQtsm8hod6ByJ9g

The waiter was very good ordered our food took my first bite of Chilean sea bass and got this horrible burnt taste flip my fish over and it was completely burnt on the bottom side. Pork chops tasted as if they were pre-made and then marked on the grill again that chard burnt taste no flavor whatsoever chewy just disgusting. So I am home now and still have the taste of that burnt fish on my tongue after brushing my tongue with a toothbrush and drinking a Maui Brewing coconut porter..

It's pricey like most steakhouses and it great steaks, like its competitors. We go there before seeing a show at the Sun Coast, generally and I think we've been going there since 2001. The views are great, the food is great and the service is great. 

I'm not sure how you would classify the ambience, so suffice it to say you don't need a jacket, can't wear shorts and shoes are required. It seems to me to be modestly upscale and an older crowd, of which I'm a member alas.",o5WZkkTuNwMvDhfYuzT-5A,0,0,4,ivJxef06Qx2rplu_fRi0Jg

Ordered a salad which was old. Tasted like bad salad bar salad so I returned it opting out of salad at that point. 

Ordered the porch chops. Very good but I requested rice instead of mash and they do not any rice. Thought that was weird but mash was good. The chops come with s really tasty sauce , mash, and a few vegetables.  Really pretty good but nothing really struck me as amazing.

1945774,2010-11-04,1,jgC4ktSSEEsFT6AmekbvsQ,"A poker buddy of mine invited me to try this place since he had a comp we could use, so hey, who am I to turn down a delicious comped meal?!

We took the elevator up one level to SC Prime.  The decor was ok, pretty old school, but there was a beautiful view!  It's a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't really packed, though we were the youngest people there.  We had a reservation at 8:15 and were seated right away.

We started the night with the shrimp cocktail and oysters.  The shrimp were jumbo and good, but I am definitely a HUGE fan of the fresh oysters... they were DELICIOUS and an awesome way to start the meal!

Next we ordered the caprese salad and the lobster bisque.  I didn't try the lobster bisque but the presentation was nice... I'm a big fan of caprese salad and the buffalo mozzarella was really yummy!  Thumbs up for that!

As far as the entrees, we ordered the rack of lamb and the short rib.  There was a crust on the lamb that was a bit too salty for our taste so my friend ended up scraping most of it off, but otherwise it was cooked perfectly, and the mint jelly was a great compliment to the dish! 

The short rib came with rice. Nicely cooked but a salty.  The rice was a little dry, but hey, I'm Asian and like my rice a bit stickier and softer lol ;).  The only negative is that I had to take away a half a star for both of our meals being on the slightly salty side...

We also sampled some cocktails.  I tried the Blackberry Mojito. We also tried the White Chocolate Martini.  Both were VERY good, and if I get to come back I'd like to try some of their other cocktails!

We finished the night off with their Chocolate Overload cake.  Very rich and decadent, great for those with that sweet tooth!

As far as the service, it was pretty good, though at times we would ask for something and they would forget, and we'd have to ask again. The server came by a couple times but we found it hard to flag her down when we needed something, but overall she was pleasant.

Our meal came out to about $150 for the two of us.  The prices were pretty average for what I would expect to pay at a steakhouse.  

Obviously we ordered WAY too much food, but I did take home the leftovers.  We left full and pretty satisfied with the meal.

I'd like to come back again sometime and try their steaks, but for now, 4 stars. =)",wqhuRhMwwlbuqW9xa1li8A,2,3,4,37n23mhUUL7kOjNzd-O3tg

They recommended this place. WRONG. The young hostess was fantastic, offering me a dining room table or the nice bar table area for my meal. I chose the nice bar area, as there was no reason for me to take an entire dining table. All was well until my meal was served. It looked fantastic, I had two bites of my meal, until their bartender went from patron to patron at his bar, loudly asking ""What did Jeffrey Dahmer say to Lorena Bobbitt?"" (Yes...an over 10 year old joke) The answer he joyfully shouted as I tried to take my first bite of my $50 meal.....""are you going to eat that?"". I thought I was going to vomit. Then he joyfully ran to the other end of the bar to tell this decade joke to yet another patron. There were people in the dining area, just over the wall. He was so loud, I find it hard to believe that they could not hear this immature and disgusting bantor either. As he went on to tell the joke AGAIN and I shouted out to him to stop repeating such a vile and disgusting joke, that people were trying to eat their meals. He insulted me, as if I was the offensive one, no apology was given. The hostess tried her best to diffuse this disgusting situation. After two bites, she bagged my meal. I paid for it and gave her a $10 tip. I had been there less than 20 minutes. I have my own business, and no young girl should ever have to work in such a vile environment, much less the customers having to EAT in this vulgar situation. I filed a complaint with the manager.

2451158,2015-11-24,1,jgC4ktSSEEsFT6AmekbvsQ,"--Rant---

Let me preface this review with the following statement; My rating and overall sentiment is in aggregate of three (3) different occasions, all of which happened around/about Thanksgiving of the last three years.

Let's start with the food...The food is definitely memorable, whether it's that ultra soft Sea Bass to their excellent Tomahawk Steak, if you want excellent food at a fancy-restaurant-reasonable price, this place is your JAM~! And that Lobster Bisque...heavenly. I've also had their prime rib, salmon and several appetizers. ALL are high quality w.r.t. preparation and taste, all moderate to large portions depending on what you order (that Tomahawk doh...damn... Couldn't finish! I'm a wuss...had to tap out...and I NEVER tap out on a good steak...).  This sentiment reflects my first and third occasion with this establishment

Service...well last time I was waiting around for about 15 mins or so for my waiter and they just never came?  Considering that the section I was in was mostly empty, I found this to be unacceptable.  A complaint to the manager wounded up with the server finally coming by, the Manager himself taking time to refill my water and to check on me multiple times throughout the meal, and what seemed to be extra attention from a couple of bus folks. A lot of high quality service despite having to complain. Nonetheless I appreciated the manager's time and attention. I know he must have been busy and to have spent so much time ensuring my service was top-notch says a lot about his dedication to providing an excellent experience for the customer.

All things great so far yes? Yes...except that 2nd occasion when ended I up with a rather SEVERE case of food poisoning. URG. I was bedridden for two days out of my entire 6 day stay at the hotel.  I couldn't MOVE for the first of those two days.  Extremely miserable experience.  I don't remember exactly what I ate, I just remember puking it all up after dinner and passing out in the bathtub, hot water spraying down on me, trying not to gag/hack.  Yeah that wasn't a fun night at all....

I mentioned that this last dining experience with them. It had been about a year so I figure I'd give them another chance to earn their way back from ZERO stars and no review. At least now they get 3!!!

---Overall---

Service: B-.  A reflection of the service really, NOT the management. Management was GREAT!  Alas, Service is Service and the manager spent more time tending to me than my waiter....

Food: A.  Having to tap out to the Tomahawk Bone In ... Excellent

Atmosphere: A.  Clean, modern, dimly lit atmosphere; very nice w.r.t. intimate dinner experience. 

Value: C. Still difficult to get over the whole severe food poisoning incident last year~",-kkq4fbhtnbnYAPpxpnvHg,1,1,3,uzfemnzyexTuhfJBQySqqA

2576751,2015-11-04,7,jgC4ktSSEEsFT6AmekbvsQ,"After another wonderful celebration meal in the Private Dining Room last night with the ever amazing Sean leading service, I'm bumping up my stars. Since the Suncoast opened, Primo's/SC Prime has been a favorite spot of my parents and their pals. 

We hosted a party of 10 with pre arranged Veuve on ice to greet the guests and a la carte options available to all. Sean had been our server on numerous occasions and as soon as I saw him I breathed a sigh of relief (and ordered a single malt) a team member of 14 years, give this man a raise! 

The outside restaurant was hopping which allowed for a casual dining experience, all guests ordered a la carte though I ordered sides and appetizers for the table. Dessert was served, family style. The Manager made sure that Bell Service was called to help us to the car with gifts and Dad's walker. Always a pleasure! 

**** above was an update review from July 2014**** 



Last week, we took a party of five, including my Dad, now in a wheelchair, and they again provided exemplary service and food. Sean was patient when my in-laws were late in traffic from AZ, and we enjoyed yet another celebratory meal at a place we've shared many happy memories over the years. Another letter to F & B Director is being sent for the amazing staff, especially Sean, who has now been there 15 years and is a charming, engaging representative of SC Prime, we always request him when reserving. 

Hopefully, we will have many more occasions to celebrate over the years, and will always return to delicious food, gracious, caring service in beautiful surroundings.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,7,5,5,onCjgZbMEsk7cusfmTRG3Q

The hostess was not particularly friendly and waved menus at us when we didn't realize she was ready to seat us.  We were like 3 feet away - take one step forward and TALK to us, don't wave a menu at us.  

Our waiter was awful.  He never made eye contact .. looked around the dining room while talking to us, brought the bill without asking if we wanted coffee or dessert, never brought the  to-go box we asked for twice.  We ended up having another waiter help us at the end because we didn't want to wait for Mr. Cant-Be-Bothered to come back, even though we were his only table at this point.

The rest of the waitstaff looked like they were pleasant and on the ball, unfortunately we got stuck with a dud.  I would have rated 1 more star each of the hostess and waiter had been more professional.

Parking is convenient and just a short walk from the casino. Once you enter, the elevator up to SC Prime is just to the right. So you do not have to cross a labyrinth like some of the strip casinos can be, lol. 
Once you pop out of the elevator, you are treated to a classy joint. We were seated promptly and service went smoothly. 

I ordered a ribeye, and my friend had the filet. I ordered it medium rare but it came medium. However, it was still good and had a nice wood flavor to it. We had it with mushrooms and mac n'cheese, both good. We finished up with dessert with the chocolate cake and the NY cheese cake. Both as one would expect.

The food was as good as at any high-end steakhouse, at a much lower price.  The drinks were a generous pour at a reasonable price.  My bone-in rib eye was delicious at $40.  The crab cake appetizer was huge, and while it isn't quite what you get in Maryland it was very good.

Like all Boyd hotel / casinos, the Suncoast caters to locals, which means that it is looking for repeat business.  I've been to more than one restaurant in a Strip hotel that had an inviting look, but didn't seem to care about your dining experience once they got you inside; after all, there is another crowd of tourists coming in tomorrow.  Not so at the Suncoast.  It's a bit of a trek to get there, if you're coming from the touristy areas of town, but parking and access is easy.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,6YaL_T97iICvGJN4OJtLSA

The service was great.  Sean was our waiter and he was very good and attentive, but not overly attentive, which is what we like.  There were also several people assisting him with water, bread, food delivery and dish removal.   The wine list was very good.  Was happy to see Jordan wines on the list.  It is very rare, despite the fact they are awesome.  The bread basket was a variety of three breads... sourdough, cranberry walnut, and some sort of crunchy flat bread.  And they served the bread with regular butter, chive butter, and honey butter.  All of the breads and butter was great.  I started with the French Onion Soup, which was awesome.  The broth was rich and flavorful.  The onions were cooked perfectly.  The cheese was melted over the top perfectly.  My Dad had the spinach salad and he said it was the best he'd ever had.  I may get it next time, because it looked good and how much he liked it.   I had a small filet for dinner, which was eight ounces.  It was cooked perfectly and it had incredible flavor.  It came with a mixed vegetable medley which was good too.  My Dad had the salmon and he said it was one of the best preparations he'd ever had.  It was served on a cedar plank with a dill sauce.  He also had a baked potato to go with it.  Normally, he does not finish his meal, despite how good it is, but he did last night.  He was very impressed as was I.

They just started a Reverse Happy Hour at the bar on Friday and Saturday nights (starting at 9:00 pm), so we decided to grab a drink because this casino is a stone's throw away from our house.  I do know that they have a daily happy hour from 4:30 - 7:00 as well.  The specialty cocktails are only $6, and my husband's Jack and gingers were only $3 each.  Ummmmmmmmm, SCORE!

I got one of the specialty cocktails called The Bogart which is kinda like a French 75 without the champagne.  It came in a huge martini glass and let's just say I didn't even need a 2nd drink.  My husband's Jack and gingers were pretty potent also and the lady who made his drink said, ""I'm Polish; I have a strong hand!"" with a sexy wink.

Couple of downsides: the clientele here is, shall we say, older.  It's not really a hip, young hangout, but I didn't mind that since we just wanted to chill out and relax.

Wedge Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing, Bacon, Cherry Tomatoes), $8

12 oz Filet, $38

Side of Potatoes Au Gratin, $7

The Lettuce on the Salad was nice and fresh...very crisp and juicy, just the way I like it.  I like my Filet cooked between Medium and Medium Well...not too well done....they hit the mark, it was perfect.  The side of Potatoes Au Gratin was good, very large portion though....enough for 2 people.

3968443,2016-07-09,3,jgC4ktSSEEsFT6AmekbvsQ,"In the 15 years I've lived here, I was only to this steakhouse one other time when it was still known as Primo's.  I ended up here after a failed attempt to use a coupon at another casino steakhouse because it was a holiday--July 4th--even though most everyone celebrated on Sunday and not the actual Monday holiday.  Suffice it to say that in the end, I was glad things turned out the way they did.  I quickly cancelled my other reservation and booked SC even though that turned out to be unnecessary.

I was seated immediately after being asked my preference of a booth or table.  Soon, a server was there to take my drink order and he brought me my iced tea quickly.  Then my server, Brenda, arrived to ask about drinks or questions about the menu.  She also told me a few specials for the day.  She ended by telling me the bone in ribeye was their best selling steak.  I ordered that cooked blue and I ordered the soup of the day--wild mushroom with rice--as a starter.

I was brought a smaller bread basket because of dining alone which I liked because I hate wasting food.  Even so, I had some of each of the breads everyone got just a smaller amount.  It was accompanied with two flavored butter swirls and a pat of regular butter.  One was a fruit flavored butter and the other was garlic and herb.  I preferred the garlic and herb.  I am not a fan of fruit flavored butter.

My soup was brought to the table and Brenda asked if I wanted freshly ground pepper which I got.  The soup was rich and creamy with a large amount of wild mushrooms pieces and some rice that was just enough for the small bowl.  

After a well timed interval, the steak and steak fries were brought.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was excellent.  There were some root vegetables with the steak so it wasn't devoid of vegetables.  The steak fries were enough for two people.  I would definitely skip a side when I return as it's too much for a solo diner.  

After finishing the steak and leaving most of the fries, Brenda told me the desserts available and I went with the seven layer chocolate cake which was listed as chocolate overload (if I remember correctly) on my bill.  It was chocolate cake with layers of chocolate filling all topped off with drizzled chocolate syrup.  Overload?  Maybe but quite good.  At this point, the dessert would have been a good choice for sharing.

Service was very good.  Classic service with the one server cleaning the tablecloth with a metal, u-shaped crumb picker.  He even moved the candle and salt and pepper to clean there before moving them back to where they had been.  The room was a little louder than I expected because of the talking from the bar/cocktail area.  

I repeat that I was glad my evening turned out differently than what I had planned.  Coming back to the Suncoast to try their steakhouse after so many years turned out to be a very pleasant experience.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,5,4,-LEerQIiMZrChzfcrffd1w

We went on a Saturday night right at peak dinner service.... barley anyone was there.

For the small amount of people there (most at the bar not at the tables) it was a very slow service. Once our drinks had been taken the waiter didn't appear for a significant amount of time (nor to bring our check). 
After we had placed our orders we had received our soup. The lobster bisque and bread were about the only good foods served to us. 

However when they served the lobster bisque it was scorching hot! I burnt my fingers when I was moving the handle! 

The scallops were ok, I could probably make it at home and it would taste as good or better... 

My dad ordered a breaded chicken... the bread was stale... 
My dad has never returned food, but this was his first time. 
They ended up replacing it with steak.... 

you would think that for a place that calls itself a steak house, it would be one of the best things to order, right?
Wrong!
it was watery as if it was boiled, lacked flavor, and was a disservice to what ever cow was sacrificed for such a lousy meal. 
Which wasn't surprising since it took them no less then 5 min to bring out. 
(My dad ended up taking it home and grilling it with his own seasoning) 

Overall Summery:
Cost= Expensive, Food = unimpressive to a huge extent, service= slow.
I don't mind paying for a good meal, but this overall was a waist of money.

**** Don't buy the restaurant coupon for this place and don't waist your time giving it a chance when Vegas has a lot better places to offer then this joke. 

The elevator down was a good touch, but it lead up to high expectations that definitely were not met.

It sure is fun when you run with the right crowd. This client of ours is a regular at SC Prime. We were the first to arrive and just waited at the bar. When the client arrived, she was greeted with great enthusiasm by the Maitre'd and we were quickly whisked off to a corner table with a view and a small staff at our disposal that also knew her well. Now that is service! 

As mentioned before, the clientele of this restaurant is towards the elder generation and thus shows the shortage of of Yelp reviews.

I placed two orders for myself at her insistence: 

Ribeye 16 oz 
Maine Lobster Tail (large) 
Asparagus 
Mac and Cheese 

This was not a combo surf and turf, but rather two separate orders. The steak cooked medium was tender and juicy as a ribeye should be. The lobster tail was about 24-32 oz before cooked size. I usually like the smaller tails because they are usually more tender and this tail was quite good given it's size. Mac and cheese was....cheesy good, but I still had better. Kind of strange, but IMO, the best mac and cheese I ever had was from a place called the Pasadena Cafeteria when I was growing up in SoCal. So far, no soul-food place or steakhouse has a better mac and cheese. There was so much food leftover, I was able to have a steak and mac lunch the next day. 

My wife ordered her typical broiled salmon with a baked potato and asparagus. Who the heck orders seafood at a steakhouse??? I had a small sample of the salmon and it was fresh, flaky, and juicy. Nothing out of the ordinary.

4833760,2017-09-11,0,jgC4ktSSEEsFT6AmekbvsQ,Went to try to have a nice dinner before we were going to a show downstairs. It appears a few other groups of folks had the same idea. It was a Saturday night and didn't seem like it was any busier than a Saturday night should be.  The service was super slow. Took forever to get even our appetizers. Dinner took even longer. And when dinner finally came it was not cooked properly and bland. On top of the food not being great we ordered two bottles of wine and they came out warm both times. This place is in desperate need of updated management or a new executive chef of some sort. I doubt will be back unless we hear things have changed. Heard every single table around us complaining about the service as well.,LN3XzwNGGxXqYoIGtz4SbA,1,0,2,9HTfykyxLbX3hjTW5UG0TA

I love the ambiance to this place. Although it seems like a high class restaurant but no suits or ties needed. The food are on the higher end of the price range but worth every dollar.  I enjoyed it so much I will return again.",0e7GiEgCc3nBvvV9sj1Ivg,5,0,5,yvU5ILLCwS2R8jKWN9yF5w

LONG VERSION 
- This elegant restaurant in Sun Coast Casino Hotel is the former Primo Steak House, located on the 2nd Fl with elevator access. Upon exiting the elevator, you'll be greeted by its small charming bar lounge area, and a beautiful view of the Strip Skyline AFAR through its gigantic floor- to-ceiling picture windows. Its high ceilings, tri-level dining room setting and the nice view make the dining area elegant and inviting, with a comfortable ambience. The host/hostess and the friendly wait staff make guests feel welcome.

One evening in early Dec, our dear friends treated us to a memorable dinner here. Our friendly and knowlegeable young waitress, Rhonda, recommended 2 special appetizers, which were not on the menu: (1) Stuffed crabmeat mushrooms with and truffle sauce [$16], and (2) Mixed salad of grilled white and green asparagus, grilled artichoke and exotic cheese and sauce, [$15]. Both were eye pleasing and absolutely delicious! 

For entrees, we had: 
(a) 8oz fillet migñon, $34, and (b) $25 scampi. For extra $10 each,  the entree could add 1 lb of Alaskan King crab legs or a lobster tail. Yes, we each added the king crab legs or lobster tail! That was too great a deal to pass up, and they were scrumptious and totally worth of the price! We also polished off a very nice bottle of New Zealand wine ($60) with our meal, and it was very smooth and tasty!

Our waitress was very attentive, cheerful AND SMART! She somehow noticed that we were toasting our friends for their 63rd Anniversary and she later surprised us with a good size complimentary chocolate cake dessert to share! A very nice touch indeed! - Mark of a good waitress and classy restaurant!

We totally enjoyed our dining experience that evening! We used to frequent its predecessor, Primo and liked it, but we really love the new SC Steak House. 

When we left the restaurant around 7pm, the dining room was almost full. There were quite a few happy people at the small charming bar as well.  We have not tried their happy hour, yet. Our waitress told us that it was excellent and quite popular.  

HAPPY HOUR: [see pic of menu].
- 4:30-7pm, daily except Tues
- Drinks $2-7
- Bar dishes, $5-10

He did not suggest any appetizers and we heard every other table being offered their cold seafood platter on ice.  (which we used to order all the time)  He talked so dumb and slowly about the specials that were available too.  Service was incredibly incredibly slow  (Trust me in a fine dining restaurant you don't want to be rushed either but service tonight was horribly slow)  1 out of the 3 of us ordered steak and she always orders it WELLLL done.  Her steak came out medium.  The server could've cared less, took it away to get it fixed and when it came back out. It was THE SAME STEAK!!!  WHAT????? A fine dining restaurant and you don't even cook a NEW steak.  ARE YOU CRAZY!  Even in my restaurant we don't re cook the same entree, we make a NEW ONE.  AND he didn't even take it off the check.  

1 of us ordered the 3 course meal which came with dessert.  While waiting literally 15 minutes for him to get our dessert and guess what, the place was NOT busy. The manager had stopped by to help clear our plates and offered dessert, and we told him we ordered it 15 minutes ago and are still waiting. He was hardly shocked and it took another 5+ minutes for him to bring it out.  After we finally got it, we sat there again LITERALLY (we checked the time) 20 minutes to get our check.  We were NOT impressed!!!!!!!!!

We sent an email to the hotel to have the food and beverage director contact us. Low and behold the manager contacts us and apologizes and says he remembers us and offers us a comp for 2.  2??? UM THERE WERE 3 OF US!!!  AND you don't even know the damm problem because we didn't tell you the problem yet.  Hmmm are you trying to save your ass??? Well we still talked to the food and beverage director and we got things straightened out.  

Get rid of the manager and get rid of this server and place them in a different restaurant, This one is not the right fit for them.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,1,MwEs93Nq47uBlvRqROONZA

She went through the specials and suggested the ribeye steak. I asked what was so special about the steak? She said it was Prime. Well, that's hardly special, as every steakhouse serves prime. Other than lawry's, that has the audacity to charge prime prices for choice, but I digress.

So my steak comes, and my mashed potatoes had quite the garnish on it. Everything was well prepared! Nothing appeals to me for dessert, so I get the check. Apparently the ""special"" steak was $60, lol. Now, that's not really a big deal, however their Porterhouse was $40. Herbs and Rye serves a comparable ribeye for $40. Andiron, a poshy Summerlin steakhouse, serves a 24oz Mesquite-grilled cowboy ribeye for $65. I'm lost as to how they valued their ribeye at $60, lol!? I don't get it, but whatever. At least I had a good laugh.

Now, let's briefly talk about the rack of lamb... it was rancid. It tasted a bit off to my friend, so I had a bite. It tasted alright, but then I tasted the end piece. Yeah, we asked Ronda take it to the chef. That wasn't right. She offered to bring something else, but my friend opted not to.",DNudacpzb0iRmV8XeI4Zmg,1,0,2,72mteaXpfJSup5Bj802jgQ

When we arrived it wasn't overly busy, which was nice. There were quite a few open tables. We still had to wait, even with the reservation. Maybe they were short handed in the hostess department. 
We ordered coconut shrimp as our appetizer, A steak and crab as our entrees. Bread basket was warm and the garlic butter was good. 
The coconut shrimp were disappointing. They were over cooked and none of the sauces really wowed us. We ended up eating them sans sauce. When our entrees arrived everything looked ok. The crab is pre-cracked, which is nice, especially with Alaskan King. Hubby's steak, however, was NOT medium well. It was medium rare at best and oozing all over the plate. To the point that I had to move so that I couldn't see it. Very disappointing. The waiter tried to blame the kitchen, then came back and told us it was his fault and he'd entered the order incorrectly. He offered to take it back to put ""on the fire"" for a few more minutes, but the damage was done and we don't send food back as a rule. For the price, we weren't satisfied. He also took our food to the back to package up our leftovers, so those didn't get eaten either. Just a general waste.

Lastly, the bone-in rib eye was perfect. A little back ground - I've been in search of a good steak for almost a year now. Some gets the flavor right, but temperature wrong.

Service was OK, nothing spectacular, but the best part was when we asked to box up our leftovers. The surly guy who came over (not our waiter) was simply going to pack up our leftover steaks and toss out everything else (including sides, vegetables, etc.).
