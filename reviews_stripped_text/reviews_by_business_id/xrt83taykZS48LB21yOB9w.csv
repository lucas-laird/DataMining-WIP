We thought we would give it a try and this deal starts at 2pm to 2am.  Service was real bad but a few slabs of great beef later the slow service did'nt matter.  A great meal for under 15 dollars in vegas.,U015oQpgHPoDxTWZ3RBD3g,0,0,4,ArcvQr1Kl5To99w2XIME3Q

I felt bad for the people next to us because they waited longer but then they left because they got so fed up. It's way expensive and the food was decent. The coffee was really bad. It tasted like water but the food seemed pretty good. The server was nice I guess but still it didn't make up for the long wait and the ""ok"" food.
They need more places open later at night. I don't get it, I thought there would be places more open at night since more people are out later at night.",6qKt5gHp-geDH1nlJXx3Wg,0,0,2,o30GI3MDVQam2ISXV2nMmg

ok service & not enough drink refills-never came back to ask how it was 
sirloin was great, salad was great , green beans kinda sucked cold & hard. soup was good only 2 noodles though. sausage was greasy. and spaghetti tasted like the plastic colainder that was used. yuck!!!
what the hell is green beans w/spaghetti anyways",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,0,0,1,7HPq1VM47I19rPKs4foPpA
