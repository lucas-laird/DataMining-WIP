The food was run low, meats were empty or dried to bottom of bins, and there was no salsa, chips, or guacamole. We were instructed that we would need to wait five minutes for the new freshly baked chips which actually took 20 minutes. A total of 40 minutes up to this point and we are still waiting for the manager to speak with us.

When I asked her if she can work on cleaning on other areas of the restaurant instead of right underneath us, she basically said that that is what she has to do. Shortly after, we were still eating, we were asked to leave because they were closed. My father and I were done eating, yet my child and senior citizen mother was not.

I also do their kids meals, plenty of food to get me full for lunch. They have veggies, you get to pick between brown and white rice (they have some in the back without cilantro if you don't like cilantro). There are also pinto or black bens to choose from. They have garnishes: corn, sour cream, cheese, salsa (green and red), pico de gallo, and lettuce. Their chips are the best, they do a hint of lemon. For the kids meal you get two sides, a tiny thing or chips and a drink (chocolate milk please lol)

First off the service was very slow and it wasn't at the peak of lunch time.  Then the person making the burritos must have been know because he gave me half a scoop of rice, half scoop of beans, and I ordered extra chicken for both burritos.  So it was measly and not what I am used to getting. 

When I did get to pay for my food the cashier was very friendly and quick to get me out of there so that was a plus.

If I am going to spend $10+ on a burrito you better give me the full scoop of beans and rice.  I hate being disappointed with Chipotle as they used to be so much better.


Well.....After I posted this review I thought I would go edit after I read what others had to say about this particular restaurant.  And bingo everyone else said pretty much the same thing as I did about their portions.  Like what a joke I will NEVER EVER return to this location again.  I have give Chipotle chances time and time again because it's a hit or miss but think it's time for me to move on the something better.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,2,0,2,xuUTTI9QfBWfaxojqPQ7pw

There were about 3 tables taken and when we got in, we were the only ones in line. The young African American woman working the counter acted as if she couldn't be bothered. No ""Hello"" or anything. I get it, it's the end of the day and she's tired. Whatever. 

I love Chipotle and we go to a lot of different locations and we always seem to get huge portions. I know this is located at an outlet mall so they need to be a bit stingier than stand alone Chipotle but they are almost closing. We got one scoop of brown rice, less than what we normally get, and when we asked for corn, I swear we each got less than 15 kernels on our bowl and there were a lot left. What is she saving it for? Rice and corn are not that expensive! She gave us very little of everything else. Normally, I'm so full by the time I finished my chicken bowl but this time, all three of us were still quite hungry when we got to our resort. I'm so glad I know not to come back to this location.

The food always taste great but they tend to run low on items that could put a damper on your lunch !!

I have never been to a chipotle where I was still hungry after eating. Usually I can never finish because it is so much. When they first opened the GM said we may ask for a little more with no extra cost. But now they are charging for a few extra pieces of chicken. An after you pay for that extra 3 pieces it is now a right portion.,9kVoC6zbIScuXWsw4OIsTg,3,1,1,wffJM7LbZwP2NVaEZwzWAg

For about $7 a chicken burrito is a so so buy.  The owner is making a killing for a little meat and all rice, bean and vegetable.  It is hot at least.  Taste is ok.

Business is ok for a Sunday night, but it is Christmas shopping season.  I was here on the night before as well, on a Saturday night.  Business was so, so as well.  I guess they do a majority of their business on daylight shopping hours.

The woman who took my order was fast & on her game - almost too fast though because she asked me which salsa(mild medium or hot) really early.  Too much for my simple brain to process maybe, since I hadn't walked down yet and was still standing by the rice. It just threw me off a bit. She also didn't assemble my boyfriends burrito well, a bunch of the filling fell out and she didn't bother to re wrap, making it a messy occasion for him. He had to ask her for a cardboard bowl so he could just burrito bowl it instead. He was a good sport and demolished it despite the unnecessarily wrapping job. The queso was thicker than usual and my burrito bowl was solid,  but not as good as other locations, still so yummy nonetheless. 

The drink and condiment area was clean and really well organized. I like that a whole bunch. I see there is some hour confusions here - I wouldn't recommend by any means to come here unless you're visiting the mall already.

This location had a low rating; once I seen Chipotle I had Chipotle in the brain and thought I'd give it a try anyway. We walk in and everyone is friendly. I had them make our burrito as we always do with no kerfuffle on additions--double everything. We shared a burrito as half of the burrito is quite comparable to a whole one-off you ask me--very filling let's just say. I'm thankful my whole family eats the same way--sharing is caring and sometimes a little goes a long way.

We dined inside and found a spot right away. We consumed our delicious burrito over random banter before heading out.

The past two times we've been in they've informed us that they now count their toppings as sides for the kids meal. So what does this really mean? Their Taco meal comes with three ""sides"" you choose your choice of rice, beans and meat (fair enough). However, they are now stating that it's an extra $1 per topping or it has to count as one of your sides (cheese, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream). I'd love to hear how a topping is equivalent to rice, beans or meat? Also how is a few sprinkles of cheese on a taco $1?",9SiaKMfoX7hsWxqNd-CKaw,0,0,1,NmK2JuK5eolnWz57Waz67g

Earlier today, I wanted to get the kids meal with two tacos and chips etc. I know the kids meal comes with the paper tray and thats fine but I asked very respectfully if I can have my rice, meat and hot sauce inside the taco rather than getting the paper tray and having to do it myself. She swore I couldn't do it but every time I go to Chipotle I get the kids meal and I always ask if they can just put everything inside for me and it's never an issue, SO WHY WAS IT AN ISSUE EARLIER? Is that a written rule that customers don't know about? Is it mandatory that I put my own rice and everything inside the taco myself because it's a kids meal? Because I have ordered this over a 100, this same combo and this was my first time I was told NO. I WAS SO MAD ABOUT IT, I just bought my wife food and just told the cashier I didn't want the food so he trashed it. The cashier was nice and ask if it was anything that he can do to help but I just ignored him because I was angry. I didn't even get full pieces of chicken in my taco I got crumbs lol. My wife was mad I didn't order anything and just talked me into ordering it again, and I just order two tacos by them selfs without getting the ""kids meal,"" and the cashier was very nice and comped my order which would have been like $4 dollars or whatever.

My go to is the burrito bowl with steak and guacamole. I always get brown rice, black beans, no sour cream or cheese, hot salsa, and guac. I am not a big soda drinker but I can't help but be obsessed with a Dr. Pepper on the side with my meal. 

If you have never had a side of chips and salsa and guacamole, I highly recommend you stop reading this review and go get some! Like Ive said in other reviews, I am picky about my chips and salsa, but damn. They have some of the best!
