I always get just one pepperoni pizza and people who order after me get their food right away. The only reason i come here is bc it's so close to my house. The people who take my order forget what i get and think ""i got my food already"" I'm never coming back here.",qK6k1R3emT6qfzfG1awhEQ,0,0,1,YdpYSMVNaw6sFB2EjtCvgw
540797,2017-06-06,0,Wc1i5QsTKheJq6lstPAllA,The reason why I hate this place this because I went to order a pizza and they told me 10 minutes and i waited there for 40 minutes and they did not have my piZZA READY I WAITED FOR 40 minutes so that's why I dislike that I seen everyone else GETTING There piZZA before me when I ordered before them I think the staff is really unprofessional I think they should get fired I heard them talking but I didn't see him working on my pizza Little Caesars claims their pizzas are hot and ready when you are they should really change their name to not ready when you are,TJKl4LAldVAuW6Za3GP67w,0,0,1,1o09NrlL4F5W58zbu2mjvw

When I arrived to pick them up they weren't ready.   There were only a couple ready.  The lobby area got busy and the lady that was making pizza in the back came out and was giving pizza to people that just walked in.  I asked her what about my order and she said ""they only have 1 to pick up and she doesn't want them to wait"".  I got upset and questioned her more and she got irate.  She went in the back and was yelling about me and throwing things.   12:40 I finally had my pizza.   No excuse for service or behavior like that.  My order was large which is why I ordered and paid almost 2 hours early.   Seems no manager to supervise.  Very bad.",5S0Iyb3dw4yFKTmt2EJHAw,0,0,1,yrxKzcbJ3MiMpEvXbEO_8A

Called to let them know after we opened the box at the office for lunch ... management did nothing wanted us to drive us back and return the pizza for a refund. Horrible customer service.

Didn't even BOTHER to put any effort into making one of the most essential sides of the pizza experience. The bread was not cut all the way and there was barley any cheese. We ate them all but they weren't even that bomb  But I guess you get what you pay for ? puras mamadas alv.,0H4_XAt4vX6OPAkO73UmMg,0,0,3,FNjpoe_QBvlUtX76UHGs_g

Great price on pizza I have done two big orders 1 of 11 pizzas and 1 of 22 pizzas and both times it was ready at the time that I wanted to pick it up. It was hot fresh and ready to go. 22 pizzas cost $118.00 not bad to feed 90 people. 

I called in my order a couple hours early because it was a lot of Pizza the guy on the phone was very helpful friendly and wasn't intimidated by my 22 pizza order.

When I arrived it musta taking me less than 5 minutes to pick up my Pizza pay for it and load them into the car and I will definitely be back.

3567365,2017-11-27,0,Wc1i5QsTKheJq6lstPAllA,Hot and ready? Lol this place is a joke. They themselves weren't ready for anybody to order pizza. Been waiting over 15 minutes since time of this review for 2 pizzas claiming to be hot and ready. Still plenty of people in front of me too.

I see 1 staff member taking orders, 1 making food & 3 out here with customers, cooing over someone's baby.

5155268,2015-06-12,0,Wc1i5QsTKheJq6lstPAllA,"This Little Caesars is the worst. They rarely have cheese pizza ready to go. The one that is sitting there, the cheese is brown as if it is burn't. The last time I bought one from there and it looked like that it did taste burn't. The crust looks hard and when you ask if there are cheese's coming up the cashiers always look irritated as if they're the ones back there making it, saying it'll be 15 mins. for the next one. This place did a decent job in remodeling, now they need to upgrade their ovens and customer service. People want to see white melted cheese not brown cheese.  The kids they hire respond to you in slang and act as if they're doing you a favor being there. June 1st @ 8:15pm Some little kid working as a cashier gave me attitude when I asked for another cheese pizza because the one he showed me had of course, brown cheese and was all bubbled up. He stated "" Our Cheese Pizza's always look like this, they not burned. If you want another one you gotta wait 15mins."" Get it together! Find out what oven or how they clean their ovens at the Little Caesars on Maryland Pkwy near Flamingo. They're always on point. If you're going to be a Little Caesars cashier or cook, be the BEST Little Caesars cashier or cook! I try and avoid going to the E. Charleston location but I was giving it another chance.

5382489,2018-04-17,0,Wc1i5QsTKheJq6lstPAllA,"Literally the worst managed Little Caesars franchise in Vegas. 10 people in line during dinner rush on a weekday. 3 employees running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. Orders were yelled out for customers who didn't exist. Meanwhile people were handed pizza boxes with the wrong contents. Every customer was told that there would be a 17-minute wait, but that level of odd specificity was never met and a lot of potential customers walked out. The cashier boy did hang out free cookies to everyone after my coaxing. But after the cookies were gone we were still pissed about the wait that never ended.",k6mtbbo7XJV2V7jpDZVlLw,0,0,1,qkjDUsicNVVHCeazASqMhQ
