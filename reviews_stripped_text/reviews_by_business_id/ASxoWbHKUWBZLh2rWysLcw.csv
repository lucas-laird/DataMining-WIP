333589,2015-12-07,3,ASxoWbHKUWBZLh2rWysLcw,"So I've seen this restaurant change a few times, never really been in here though, so I tried it, never coming back.

So first we sit down, atmosphere is simple and very plain. It was very spacious and plenty of tables everywhere which is good. Service... is debatable.

1. We didn't ask for hot tea, but we got some and assumed it was complimentary but charged us on our bill.
2. Every time we ordered something, nobody could understand us even as we're pointing at the actual picture so there was literally 3 servers trying to decipher our orders. After a while believe it or not, we had to use Google Translate to communicate to them.
3. They don't have most of their dim sum on their menu. I had to ask what they had available instead because most of what I wanted they did not provide.
4. They did not provide us with steamed rice. We asked for some but they just laughed at us. Like was that supposed to be funny? So the server gave us a cup of steamed rice when there was three of us. (There's charge per bowl of rice) It was totally fine, I just assumed it would be a bigger bowl/plate of rice like the other restaurants in Chinatown serve when it's family style.
5. We ordered pecking duck from the dim sum menu, and they decided to cook us the whole duck. When we told them that the order was wrong she said ""It's okay if you don't finish it, eat it for dinner tonight"".......... what? So we got charged for the whole duck. The duck didn't even have flavor and they didn't give us the sauce that comes with it. 
6. The pork chops had sugar on it. Different style maybe? The fried soft shell crabs in the picture had three in it, but they only serve two. The server said the photographer took the pictures of the food in different angles that's why it looks more. But in reality, it's smaller, so next time she said not to believe the pictures..... what?
7. Once we received the fried soft shell crabs they already gone bad. Was not fresh at all, in fact sour. They did make us a new batch of them without charge but we already lost our appetite to eat them.
8. I don't know why but the servers kept laughing at us every time we wanted to order something or ask for water. And it wasn't the friendly laugh. 

For the three of us it came out to $50, and we were still hungry when we left. And I left wanting to throw up too so yay even better. 

I understand that they're new and that there was is a bit of a language barrier. But I'm really hoping that they improve on their service and food a bit more because I want to see a permanent restaurant for that location! Personally I would not come back but if it improves I totally would.",5eL7rlY6Ux7q3GrJpNjYGA,4,2,1,gosza9qXtizkI2BZNCWuOw

Dim sum decent.  Even though its a cart pushing type of dim sum restaurant but it's more like made to order.  No complain there, nice and hot.  Ordered a lunch special dish, tasty.  So, I assume their dinner dishes should be very okay.",lp4kulLRAtIwsVTxwSnhFg,0,0,3,J1iptzoRyQ2iuEND_BSQLg

From the start, the server wasn't very welcoming but thought I'd keep a patient, open mind. We ordered a wor wonton soup and 3 other dishes. After we ordered, a very large party arrived and were served immediately. They were served their soup, rice, and dishes, all before us over the span of at least 15 minutes. The server did notice that we were wondering what was happening. She brought us a couple of items to appease us. When I did express my opinion that it might be a good idea for the kitchen to at least send our soup, she said that that other party had called ahead. She didn't need to give an excuse in a matter-of-fact tone, instead she should've just assured us that our meal was coming asap. At the end of the meal I pointed out that instead of orange chicken, she had brought us lemon chicken, as stated on our check. Instead of being apologetic she took a defensive tone and explained that they always cook their orange peel chicken with lemon flavored sauce and with lemon slices...hmm...  Bottom line, her demeanor throughout our time there conveyed that she didn't care whether or not we came back and so I won't. :(",WvGyLAeL7mp1CkjdPKIAQg,0,0,1,M9-YuJ2sguiv0GBJFX59CA

2496937,2015-09-08,9,ASxoWbHKUWBZLh2rWysLcw,"All gifts from the heart are not created equal...and Fortune Seafood Restaurant's fell a little flat (gratuitous reference for the 0.89% of the world that speaks Cantonese).

There are certainly better options in Vegas for Dim Sum. The real crime is that the worst items we received were seafood items...your name has the word seafood in it...make sure it's fresh! 

We came in on a Saturday around 11:30am to find a relatively empty dining room with only a few other tables occupied. We had a sense that it wasn't going to be that great, but you can only judge 95% of books by their covers...plus we felt obligated to stay and write a review since there weren't a lot of reviews to go off in the first place. The service was great!...fast and attentive.  We ordered many of our favorites and few other items:
Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings)
Siu Mai (Pork Siu Mai)
Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs)
Nor Mai Gai (Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with some mysterious substance)
Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork)
Daan Taat (Egg Tart)
Liu Sha Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Buns)
Steamed Scallop Dish 
Almond tea bund with lotus seed

We generally eat all that we order, or at the very least take the left-overs home. There were two dishes that were bad enough that we didn't want to finish them: Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) & the Steamed Scallop Dish. The seafood was certainly not fresh, spoiling the dishes. 

The simple choice is to find a different restaurant. If you do find yourself here, without the options of leaving, you would do best to stick to the Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs) and Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork). Still there was nothing good enough to recommend outright and certainly nothing to bring us back.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,7,2,eKBd7FdMx3A_-kcOlQTN5w
2518132,2015-07-23,3,ASxoWbHKUWBZLh2rWysLcw,"Apparently this place is fairly new but I was surprised to see only one other party seated when we arrived. I'd read some reviews on this place (duh) and a lot of reviews had one thing in common: the silverware/dishware were dirty. So, as expected, the tea cups was beyond disgusting and I immediately requested new ones.

The language barrier between the waitress and us was so bad that she had to go get one of her colleagues to translate. That is perfectly fine - I am all for that; it makes the place feel more authentic - but maybe put someone on the floor that knows even the tiniest bit of English or at least enough that she can take an order :)

The food was good but not exceptional. My favorite was the beef with bean paste and that was pretty much the only dish that left an impression. We also tried the sweet and sour soup, which was too bland for my taste. The pork buns were good but a bit too chewy, almost as if they were undercooked.

This place is so close to home that I'm actually a bit sad that it isn't better. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,5,4,2,jgtbRLAwqQ8tT5OMPtXsqg

Once inside we were immediately disappointed at its appearance but decided to give it a try anyway.  The waiter, an older man perhaps in his 60s,  was downright miserable. He took our order and was reluctant  to offer any information about any of the choices. He did not even ask if we wanted drinks. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Rarely do we leave food behind, but the food was such that we did not want to be reminded of this bad experience again.   The utensils and plates were not very clean and when asking for more rice, it is doubtful the same  man who was cleaning up even washed his hands before he went in the kitchen for the rice.

We ordered pork shumai and custard bun, they were very moist and delicious, one of the best I have had. We also ordered chicken feet and roast duck. Roast duck was different texture and the way it was prepared, the skin was very crispy and there was no fat on the duck. It was amazingly good.
