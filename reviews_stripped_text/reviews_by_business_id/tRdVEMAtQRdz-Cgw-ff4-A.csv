Previously the falafel platter, according to another yelpers picture, was 4.99 and came with 5 falafels and fries. Now it costs 6.99 and they added two falafels to the patter for a total of 7 falafels. It comes with a ""sauce"" which is basically just seasoned ketchup and hot sauce mixed, for both the fries and falafels. I'm not sure I want to try their other food if this is thought they put into their platters. Thanks, but no thanks.",UJSmPjnHc3YDj0iJHdPZrQ,0,0,1,L_BWXQ6eU78ar7G398IPBQ

Food quality Pricing, friendly staffs and the most important one is the honest owner who cares about the customers and their comments about the food. Very convenient  for students due to the location. I have tried the sosis nadari, persian tanori sassage, jigar and del and Persian spaghetti. All of them were good , tasty and can be customized with their available options ( like more chili, extra cheese and so on) . By the way this is a fast food style so don't expect the fine dining tables or silverwares. It is self serve,fast quick but delicious and tasty.

1667302,2017-10-03,0,tRdVEMAtQRdz-Cgw-ff4-A,"I am going to be really honest because I wanted to like this place. I have been away from home and wanted to find a place that had amazing middle eastern food as I missed home cooking. 

Maybe I am too hard because I know authentic.

Lets start with the location- it is located in a food court that is randomly located and hard to find. There is nothing wrong with it but something to mention. 

I ordered pigs in a blanket with cheese dipping sauce (best thing I ate on the menu) 
as well as the kobideh- ground beef skewers- there were 2 which was nice and rice. 

I asked for onion on the side and that was left out. 

Mostly my lack of stars was the lack of taste and the rubbery meat. It was dry, and lacked everything. I dont know if they over worked the meat and made it too gluey. I honestly ate one bite and threw it away. 

I dont think i will be back even though i typically give places more than one try since there are so many other middle eastern restaurants to try. I know they do Ubereats and everything else for deliveries.",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,0,0,2,p8RIhLzKGSLyUe8IYedviQ

A cheeseburger wrapped inside pizza dough baked to perfection. I'm not sure what sorcery goes on in their kitchen to make the veggies still perfectly crisp and not at all soggy despite having been cooked in an oven underneath a blanket of pizza dough, but damn is it magical. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've never ordered anything from here that wasn't simply divine. I could legitimately live off of the healthy chicken bowl. And all of the praise for the amazing food is a moot point when you factor in how wonderful the entire family that owns this place is.

Delivery was timely and the driver called before leaving the restaurant. Very friendly and didn't need any help finding the place. 

Persian spaghetti was as advertised: spaghetti with peppers, onions, and Persian meat. The meat was delicious but the rest of the dish was fairly ordinary. Pretty tasty, but nothing to write home about.

Moo's favorite meatball bowl was a disappointment. The dish consisted of food service meatballs served over fresh basmati rice with a tiny bit of shredded cheese sprinkled on top. The rice was delicious but the meatballs left us asking ""who would call these their favorite?"" This was OK but not great. 

Chicken creamy and sweet garlic pizza was the shining star of our meal. This pizza has a lot going on and yet the flavors were perfectly balanced and delicious. The crust was properly crispy and light, not heavy at all. All the flavors were very fresh.

I am not Persian myself but grew up very close to the persian family of my best friend and enjoyed excellent persian cooking prepared by her mother;  because of this I am almost always dissapointed when I order persian food from a restaurant. The kabob was excellent, the flavor was spot on. Was it as good as ""mom"" used to make? No, but nothing ever is and I was not dissapointed in the least. I ordered the pizza to share with my boyfriend when he gets home from work but could not resist to try a piece with lunch and it was bomb! Tons of toppings and the crust was so thin and crispy.  I ate 2 pieces and probably would have kept going if I would not have to admit to eating so much later!
