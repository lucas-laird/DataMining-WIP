The manager then gave me coupons for a free taco or two dollars off next time because I waited so long for melted cheese. Then today when I tried using the coupon the manager told me I had to spend at least $8.00. Maybe I don't know how to read but it doesn't say anywhere that there is a minimum purchase.,LACUvCVunyzVki_X8muBrQ,0,0,1,2a3CYumD1OLXCJ5AGRZtyQ

I got my food and I have to say, I am not very please. My bowl has way too much beans in it and very little veggies. I could count the pieces of bell peppers that was on it. It almost look like a bean soup. Extra side of chicken was over priced. You don't get much for $4.99. I am not a frequent Baja customer but I don't remember it being this pricey for a meal.

This was my first visit to a BFMG, and I was impressed.

I selected their Baja Burrito with carnitas, served ""Echilado Style"" (topped with cheese and red sauce).  REALLY good!

My favorite go-to-must-haves are the baja style tacos (two corn tortillas) filled with a fair amount of carne asada, mild sauce (though hot is available), onions and cilantro. Just like those other places, but they are always spot on with their deliciousness. 

A friend used to get all of his burritos 'enchilada style' and he loved it, so I'd recommend that if you're a burrito guy or girl!

I also usually order a small side of guacamole with chips, but man, the guac has a really bitter aftertaste that I can't take anymore. But definitely get the chips, they are salty and crispy and sometimes warm...mmmmmmmmm!

Also, the service is quick and friendly as heck! I love these people. They are on the ball and I've never had them mess an order of mine up. Super, super nice people here!

By far the steak is my favorite meat to pick here.  Their steak tacos, while simple, are very full of flavor and I often get these when I can't figure out what I want.  I hate being that guy that stares at the menu for 10 minutes.

For making food to order they are pretty fast to get it out!  I've never been here when it's really busy, usually just one or two people ahead of me, so I'm not sure if that rings true during other times.

They also have some strange ways of operating business. Their hours, for instance, are 10:45 - 9:45. Maybe it's just me, but I find it odd that a business would close at 9:45 instead of on the hour like all other Baja Fresh franchises. And when we have gone early in the day they have opened up to 15-20mins late. Also, once you're inside it's not the most comfortable wait since the AC is broken. Forget about eating in with the summer heat!

The food we've had here has been consistent with other locations, so I'll still go here out of convenience when I get the craving. But I do wish the ownership/management would do something to improve service. As it is now, you get the impression they really don't care all too much.",Z9mBDuuMNbgn2MjAHlqxLQ,2,0,2,C2zJoExBRxSwAX8KVv93GQ

Not sure from what particular thing that I ate. I'm disappointed because their food used to be great but now not so much. 

Not going back again.",oNMSGUU0g8zFfpfSh--xyQ,1,0,1,WCaS_PD_CzmfNaAQNxRhRQ

I skipped the tortilla shell bowl and added everything spicy from the salsa bar and a ton of limes. What's great about Baja Fresh vs. Chipotle is the food looks and tastes better, and the salsa bar is free. Yum!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,0,3,4mBa3qJZ4vSI2HJw19mMng

Do you you know what will you been eating here today?
Back in July 30, I was here and complained about the sauce flavor and they told ""you're the only person complaining"" well thanks to the inspector for doing their job.",aImkP1kjzXAlxjhl9VHx1Q,2,0,1,M2V0aU0CxD_N6yaBW5oyXw
