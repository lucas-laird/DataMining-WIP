They were all amazing with great flavor! We also did the BBQ and philly cheese potato. Now, we usually try to make it over next door to our office once a week when they are in the area!",vpBFIUvet7puRb-YcdKBNQ,0,0,5,jWIravv1AavrcAuvqu-fzA

2513178,2018-04-26,0,X20bnlwr15SraBzvP7vC4g,Your truck parked outside my office today. Within 15 minuets you had a line. You handled the crowd like a pro.  Your food top notch. When things got long and people just standing around you stayed with the updates. Nice job hope you slide through again. Try the buffalo chicken baked potato. Just the right amount of heat.,5ebuCeDMe0TGGWmEMEbQaQ,0,0,4,5eE190f3egxrCSuStocV2A

2605659,2018-04-29,0,X20bnlwr15SraBzvP7vC4g,"I was super excited for my apple bacon sweet potato fries! The way the menu described them made them sound super heavenly. However upon receiving my order, I was rather disappointed? Most of the fries were burnt looking and worse, super dry inside. They tasted bland and not at all worth it, despite being buried under candied bacon and sweet diced apples. The toppings themselves were delicious and delightful but if a truck can't give that same love to the star ingredient? Kind of a downer. ;(
Can't say I'd come back or recommend this truck to friends.",HoBcmSY15rtQxuxXdGaiYw,1,0,2,kQjD3EBsHzlhnZF5HHj0eA
