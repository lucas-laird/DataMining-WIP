That's all I really have to say LOL But seriously, the main reason I decided to drag my family here early one Saturday morning was to try their mochi pancakes. I was like ""hey, I love mochi and I love pancakes, what a great combination."" The pancakes had a nice crisp on the outside and gooeyness on the inside.  I personally like them plain with no syrup but if you're not like me and like syrup, they do serve it was some yummy coconut syrup. The coconut syrup add a nice touch to the pancakes. Trust me, you won't miss the maple syrup.  The two combined was a perfect match. 

I must add though, that we did have a hard time finding the place initially, since the sign wasn't as visible from the parking lot.  It must be how the plaza was set up though since the sign was in the walkway vs the front.  The shop itself is also a bit small but the service we received here was great.  The wait was a bit long, but then again we did order a ton of food (family of 6 here).  The lady in the front also gave us a heads up that the pancakes will take a little bit longer due to the fact that mochi does take a bit longer to cook than regular pancakes, which we appreciated.  

All and all, I would definitely recommend you try their mochi pancakes.  I can't say much about the other dishes they serve since my main focus was pretty much on the pancakes.  But my fams has no complaints on what their food.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,8,6,4,SKtcKU9VO6y7cjE1EpAuIg

The owners are super friendly and the food is onolicious. Since the food made to order, there is a bit of a wait, but well worth it! The mochi pancakes are definitely worth the wait...light and fluffy with a nice medium crust. By far the best pancake I've eaten.

I was not disappointed there were 3 of us so we all got different foods we wanted to try. 
I heard of the Mochi Pancakes glad I tried it with or without the Coconut Syrup it was great. 
Pasteles was Ono too. 
Lastly the Portugese Sausage they use for breakfast was just as Ono.

So I thought they consider themselves (Hawaiian) Kapuna Cafe is Authentic local food.  I realize they are  pure Filipino owner not Hawaiian but that's ok (maybe prefer to be Hawaiian).  The place was very nice and small it's in a good crossing roads a little old area, parking lot was practically empty.  I tasted everything I purchased it is sad to say, all the sweets I purchased tasted like it was bought and re-sold to customers.  Why I say this comments, I have my own Bakery for 20 years in San Diego and I know when I taste one.  The long John you can just taste it is not baked fresh, I bet this is bought as well??? The custard has a bitter taste after bite.  I didn't taste the hawaiian fusion food because I want an authentic Hawaiian food real local food.

We paid at 1201 and never get our food after 30 minutes. That's when we got my manapua and three pork hash. Then our meat jun plate came five minutes after and another five for my chow fun. 

The chow fun was warm and not hot. Like the cook was afraid to cook the noodles and the amount of spam was a small amount for the large size. It's like two regular spam size cut into 8 pieces each. 

Flavor of the chow fun was bland, could use more soy sauce, sesame oil or something for more flavor. The manapua was ehh, you can taste that it was frozen before steamed and the pork hash was alright. 

I gave Kapuna Cafe only three stars because of the wait time from when you've ordered, not that big of a dining in area, there is no fountain drinks and the drinks that's in the fridge cooler not that cold.",nm6M47JKTbgV8YoRQnbTxw,1,1,3,xBZfTqACZmKwGHuRhV9aPA

If only we would have been warned about the wait up front, I would have thought differently. It was obvious that other people before us had been waiting as well. Therefore, I don't see why we couldn't be warned. On to the food... guava turnover was good. I think it was more artificially flavored guava. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I got the kalbi lunch plate which included 3 strips of kalbi, 2 scoops of white rice and a side of Mac salad. Hubby got the mixed plate (Teri chicken, kalbi, and Teri beef). I wanted to add a pancake order after placing the other items and paying by card but front staff said $10 minimum. I wish she could have allowed a ""return"" and repurchase. After all, we literally just paid $30 sumtin (add the Hawaiian Sun drink). But nope, sadly. It's cool, my error though. I came back with cash from the car about 35 mins later and waited in a line of 3 people ahead of me to order a Li Hing drink only to be told they were sold out. It was between 1040am-1210pm that we were there. I'm really curious about the mochi pancakes still and will most likely come back sometime for them. Other than that, our plates were ok.

2741636,2018-02-12,0,jaqQNaCH-xtdr6uH0MFnWw,"I had the most enjoyable breakfast this morning at Kapuna Cafe thanks to Victoria, her mom, and nephew!! My husband works in the same area and he insisted we support the local community! 

Pro Tip: There is complimentary coffee for guests and it's delicious! Pairs perfectly with their fresh pastries baked in house daily! 

Kapuna is 100% family operated and the menu showcases authentic Hawian meals cooked by Victoria's mother. Today I ordered the 2 eggs and pancakes plate which also included a choice of sausage, harm, or bacon. My husband ordered the 2 eggs and meat plate. We both chose sausage which I hands down recommend!! It's some of the best breakfast sausage I've had in a very long time. 

Pro Tip: The pancakes are actually Mochi pancakes. If at first you aren't sure, just try them!! I promise you will not be disappointed. The flavor is slightly less sweet than a typical wheat flower pancake and the texture is slightly moister than a dry feeling pancake. I wouldn't even say they were chewier than normal like I was expecting. They were perfect!

The pancake matched with the sausage was exactly what I was looking for. I chose the coconut syrup and it was to die for. 100% a must-try.  Victoria also graciously offered us a complimentary pastry ( I'm telling you the customer service  is on point) and let me tell you it was heavenly. The outside was flaky and the inside was moist and filled with cream!  They are definitely worth spending  $2 to try!!

First impressions:

Clean and cute store front. The service was excellent and the food was great! I'll definitely be back. **note this is not a fast food joint everything is fresh and made to order don't except food to be cooked in 5 min! If you're in a hurry call ahead**

Food review:

Portion to quality and value is on point!
To me this is not the ""traditional hawaiian"" food joints we see in the states this place is more than that. It's definitely Asian fusion and I would categorize it as Filipino Hawaiian food and Bakery. Being half Haole and half Pinyo from Hawaii it's like eating at home. The mochi pancake reminded me of a steam cake my mom made when we were kids...delicious! The bbq chicken had the Hawaiian taste but with a little Filipino flare...also delicious!

The chicken katsu was a lot for a mini order.
I ordered eggs and it tasted like it was microwaved, fyi.
I would recommend that you call in your order if you are in a rush or come when you have time to talk story and wait for your food.
Lots of Aloha here, come and enjoy!",hMh9r-pOrNV0FT0uV_h81w,2,3,5,3syDg_ONMExbYHEegORW6Q

The deserts was good. Food was good. Their specialty drink was good. The only thing that bothered me was that my daughter didn't get her food till after we finished our burgers. Then she waited another 10 more minutes. She said they had to cook more rice but the other two people who came their after us got their 2 plates before my daughter.",dmXPfWBNL0ZiPd6RoUTWuQ,0,0,3,RsVrMLgUJh1LW4A4ZVdpzQ

You can tell there is heart and pride in making the dishes. Wait time was average for a made to order restaurant.
Ordered the mixed plate as they had a special Buy 1 get 1/2 off another today.
First was told they were out of Kalbi, but when we got our plates there was Kalbi in it, that's awesome to see the extra effort in prepping the plates to match the menu and thanks!
Also had the Meat Jun and Saimin and both were as good if not better than places back home in Hawaii.
The Coco Puffs were on the smaller side, but that Shaka Long John was too cool to pass up!
The Mochi and Taro ball pastries was also very tasty!
Sistah waiting on us was courteous and even checked on us a few times while we ate there, thanks Sistah, simple gestures like that always welcomes anyone who visits here!
We'll definitely be back here to get some Pork Hash and Chantilly cake and try some of the other dishes that were already sold out when we got here.",qIOCztyFIOMm4oryf3xcZQ,2,1,4,Jd6wiW6XcMslAarln7PObA

Tried their amazing signature Li Hing Mui drink and was not disappointed, such a huge drink too, big enough to share. I recommend getting there a little early, we showed up a little after 4 and all their popular stuff were sold out but I was more than happy with the BBQ mix plate and Meat Jun. The owner came out to ask us how everything was, and it was nice to see a locally owned family business with such amazing authentic Hawaiian flavor. Will DEFINITELY be back, this is my new favorite Hawaiian spot. Our server was also the sweetest, she let us try their house made ube mochi, which I will be back for btw. Thank you so much.

Kapuna has went above and beyond to capture the true paradise flavor that I've been missing with their hearty plates, seasoned noodles, and awesome desserts!!

I ordered a bowl of saimin and my itty bitty son got the mochi pancake short stack. It was a weekday when we went in and so they weren't selling some of the specials that they're known for like the pastele, chantilly puffs and long John's. They were also out of their signature drink. 
They open at 9am, we got there a little after 10am and the complimentary coffee wasn't brewed yet so we had to wait around for that a bit. However, I appreciated that it was comp! 
The dining area is small but overall clean. There's no trash bin which I thought was kind of odd, so our server/counter person just told us to leave our trash on the table. She was very friendly.
This morning there was only one counter person/server and she got busy real quick with no one to take over orders and accept their delivery of products which happened to be at the same time we were ready to order. It seemed like there was only one other person in the back manning the kitchen as well. The wait for our food was a bit longer than I'd like but the pancake was very unique - if you're Filipino, you'd compare it to bibingka. My saimin was good but the dashi was a little too salty for me. 
I don't think I'd order the saimin and pancakes again but I'd definitely be back to try the weekend specialty items and the desserts. Oh and the coffee! I definitely want to try their specialty drink with li hing mui too!",9VljRRFnivDCtc2gDaJsNg,2,1,3,a7NwAm51gA8HIWxKyucz0g

A family owned and operated joint that has been opened now for about 2 months, it's one of the closest comfort Hawaiian food we've discovered in LV... probably because most of their ingredients are brought in from Hawaii.  The wife and daughter aren't big fans of Hawaiin food due to high carbs, but they both enjoyed their lunches yesterday and will be back.  The mochi pancakes are a must!  Now I have two local joints when I'm feeling the carve for proteins and carbs.   

Tip:   If you want to have their tasty pastries and desserts, you'll need to either get there on Fri and Sat before they're all sold out.  OR pre-order then ahead of time.",Mv55A30nEcAl3vk4qow5dA,5,3,5,yey-B_-XB1gUdqB_GoK-xQ

My son ordered the Kal Bi (Korean style short ribs) it was full of flavor, it wasn't overcooked or undercooked, it was great!

I had the loco moco without the egg.  The hamburger patty was thick and cooked all the way through, just the way I like my hamburger pattys.  The gravy over the rice and patty was delicious!

This restaurant was clean, it's a family owned businesses... The customer service was great, they are very welcoming.

This restaurant is located across the North Las Vegas Airport, which I think is a great location.  Its not hard to find, it's in a strip mall near the escalators.

The owners are nice people.    They had prepared and kept on warm burners: Kalua pork, kalbi, chicken katsu, pancit and rice.  The food is just like being in Hawaii at an awesome pot luck.  The cakes are beautiful and yummy too.  Wanted to go back today for breakfast but they are closed.  Looking forward to trying their pasteles and mochi pancakes.

Update!  We went back three days later and had breakfast.  Mochi pancakes are so ono!  I had a short stack. They went down fast.  Also ate a manapua (pork) and a patele (pastele).  The patele is one of the best I've every had because it had a bit of heat, not a lot but enough that it stands out when compared to other pateles I've had.  

The service was friendly and helpful.  I will be going back...for desserts and pancake.

They are new in that space and I'm hoping that they'll put some decorations or some kind of color on the walls and maybe some plants in and outside.  They are in the middle of the strip mall.
