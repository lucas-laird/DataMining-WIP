44723,2011-06-30,0,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,"Yum! I finally tried this truck after following it in twitter. They were located on Durango and Centennial (where they will opening a restaurant soon). 

Down to the food...I ordered the Captains Order and Barbe, which were both really delicious and loaded with flavor. I ordered my daughter the plain jane which consist of cheese and ketchup, which she loved. I took a bite of my bf's pulled pork slider which is really good. So far no disappointment from me. 

The staff was really friendly and helpful because I did ask them which one is the most popular slider and sure enough it was the pulled pork. I'd definitely come back and try some of the other sliders.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,1,5,NspeXn5kqecgXa2ZoCRIdw
113479,2011-07-31,0,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,I've been to the Slidin' Thru truck so many times when they were parked down the street from my house so I was happy when they opened up the HQ down the street from my office. I've taken a lot of co-workers to the HQ and they all really enjoy the food and always order way too much. The décor is very 'young' but the food is fantastic and I've never had anything there that I didn't like.,4IOlM5-tYK1j_b_HcUclTA,0,0,5,EOxa2--DRm6fJZHQdIOl8w
124273,2011-11-14,1,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,"Food trucks have become a huge trend these days, but I'm not one to fight lines and hunt them down around town. I'd much rather go to a fixed location and order something whenever I want, which is why I had to take a trip to Slidin' Thru HQ to see if the sliders in their restaurant are any better than the ones on their truck. Simple answer: nope.

The HQ is located near the airport in an odd office park. There's a bar next door to it that's very easy to find because of all the signage, but the HQ has nothing but a sticker in the window so my friend and I drove by it twice. Maybe they don't want to be found even by those trying to look for them? The interior of the place is something out of a comic book, insane colors, loud music, and comic book style art spray painted all over the walls. It wasn't too bad, but the seating choices were quite limited. I think there were two booths that could seat about six, a round table with a few chairs, and a long high top table with maybe another 8 chairs or so.  Not sure what they do when there's a rush, although based on the location maybe there never is...

For the sake of variety and hoping I would hit the jackpot with at least one decent slider, I ordered three different kinds from a selection of six Angus sliders, a pulled pork slider, an eggplant option, and a 'mystery' selection.  They also offer four different kinds of Super Fries with all sorts of insane toppings, as well as regular and sweet potato.

The first one up was the Barby, which has melted cheddar, caramelized jalapenos, crispy fried onion strips, bacon and bbq sauce. Quite a lot of toppings for a little slider so I expected much flavor, but what I got was A LOT of dryness.  The word 'dry' is going to become a common theme here I should mention. The bun on this slider was extremely dry and a bit hard, but the meat was beyond dry. Luckily(?) the onions and bbq sauce completely consumed all flavor of this concoction, so I was a bit distracted from the dryness by the taste of a bad version of KC Masterpiece sauce. Strike one.

The next one up was the Captain's Order, complete with roma tomatoes, arugula, bacon, feta cheese, sautéed onions and a balsamic reduction. Once again the bun and meat were beyond dry, but lucky for me this time the balsamic commanded all flavor. The bacon had decent flavor, but was totally overcooked and, you got it, dry. Not much else to say about this one, just underwhelmed again. Strike two.

My final attempt at decency came from the Pep Pep, which the guy behind the register described as an 'In-N-Out clone'. This one has lettuce, tomato, pickles, bacon, sautéed onions, cheddar and super sauce. There are few burgers out there that are even close to being as good as the Almighty, but I must say that this one was good. I only wished that I had ordered three of them. Upon my very first bite I exclaimed that it actually tasted like a burger. The pickles were good, the bacon was ok, and the meat somehow retained some moisture this time. The meat on its own had ok flavor, and I was happy I ended on this one and not the others.
 
As for the fries, I went with the Barby Fries which are a play on the Barby slider. That was a bit of a mistake, if you're getting a few different kinds of sliders here, try to get one of the fries based on a burger you're not getting for some more variety. Or, if you're not looking to order a giant bucket of fries for $5 that are more than enough for 3-4 people, try the regular or sweet potato choices. The fries are not too bad on their own, but layered with melted cheddar, bacon, caramelized jalapenos and bbq sauce they become something totally different. They get soggy very quickly, and the sauce overpowers all flavors once again. The onions taste good, very reminiscent of a Bloomin' Onion if you've ever dared to order one. The bacon bits were overcooked and had a burnt grease flavor, the jalapeños tasted good but were buried in the rest of the flavors.

Maybe the most acceptable part of this meal is the price for three sliders: $7. I think it's very reasonable if you could get three that aren't dry that you might actually like, but once you combine that with $5 for the insane Super Fries and a drink, it quickly becomes a $15+ meal which is a bit steep for this. The fries are more than enough to share with a few people so you could split the cost with a few other folks, otherwise I would stick to the regular fries for a much more reasonable $2. 

Overall I fail to see what all the hype is about. Sure the food truck thing is cool, but unless you can actually deliver a good product like some other folks I don't know what to tell you. The interior of their HQ is probably cool if you're in high school, but if you're looking for a decent place to sit down and get something slightly better than fast food you should probably skip the HQ.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,2,LK9f8Ys5lt1AKlLzaGeywg

First off the place is way cool on the inside. Has a street food flavor thats on par with the truck.  Cool old school video games and graphiti style paint. I was greeted with the customary fist bump at the cash register and ordered up some pep pep sliders and pep pep fries. I was not blown away by either. I am not a fan of a seriously thick burger and these were more like a meatball than a slider. All in all the taste was good. I will be back in to try the other menu items but I have to admit that with all the hype I was just ever so slightly disappointed.

247486,2011-03-30,0,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,"After much hype about the opening of their land based HQ I had to check it out for myself. The Ambiance is very cool with something straight out of a comic book. It did not have the cheesy Vegas feel at all, which is a nice departure from what we are used to. But I didn't come here for the cool ambiance I came to try the food. 

To start I was less than impressed with the selection of sliders available. There were only 7 menu items to choose from, and also it seemed to me that the choices were very similar in taste profiles because most had same ingredients ie. bbq sauce sauteed onion, cheddar cheese. I would have thought that the sliders would all be very different in taste. I ordered 3. The Barby. The Captain. The Caprese. I normally wouldn't get the caprese but It was the most different one of all the other sliders. I ordered the superfries as well. It might be me but I did not like the fact the fries had the same toppings as the burgers did not appeal to me. For the most part the sliders had good flavor however the meat was well done and I would guess the actual patty was only 1 oz. so it tasted very dried out and no matter how much bbq sauce you put on it it doesn't hide the fact the meat was overcooked. The caprese did not have much flavor. The mozzerella did not taste like anything and the eggplant was so thin I could hardly tell it was there. The fries were a generous portion but since they were the same as the burger toppings I had had enough bbq and bacon so I did not finish them. 

Overall I think they concept is very cool and brings something new to the table. I really like the fact they have arcade games there to play and they are free! I would say the food needs a little tweaking but it is on the right track. 

For $17 I think something was missing. I want to go back to try the smores fries though!",Y9u9hcRGWzPC4yQ5nRHgtA,0,0,2,SLMKoCwtfMAJvG43VuXSfg

. The barby (Cheddar , caramelized onions, crispy onion , bacon and bbq sauce.) This was my favorite everything worked . 

Capt order:  roma tom, arugula ,bacon ,feta cheese sauteed onions and a balsamic reduction) This was my least favorite , nothing wrong just personal taste . Did not care for the bitterness of the arugula and the dryness of the feta , the balsamic reduction did not off set the arugula or the feta.

  Pep pep( lettuce, tomato,chedder , onion, pickle and super sauce) Nothing special just a plain burger, it was alright.
      The meat in all the bugers were pretty good tasting the buns on the sliders were more like dinner rolls.

It is in an offbeat area (a business park) and is located right next to a bar/gaming lounge (there are no signs on the outside...just have to walk into the lounge to get in).

I definitely agree that the food is top notch.  The menu is only made up of sliders and fries, but the quality of the food is awesome.  You are able to mix and match up to three sliders.  I had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders.  All three sliders were great and each one had distinctive flavors.  The barby is a bbq style slider, the yaya is a greek style slider, and the pep pep is a cheese and bacon slider with special sauce.  They don't seem that big at first, but I was pretty stuffed after eating three of them.

They also have sweet potato fries that are covered in cinnamon sugar, which was surprisingly pretty good.

The place itself has a fun and friendly atmosphere and our server was very nice and helpful.  Oh, and they have an NBA Jam arcade machine that has free play on it...very cool.

I would definitely come back again to try the other sliders and their specialty fries.",tbXrF0IhRCONUGNRWkXwIw,0,0,5,AMxYCzufMlaVp0zAJyjr2g

I remember first hearing about Slidin' Thru after reading an article at work about up and coming chefs in Vegas and the fact that somebody took on the challenge of making unconvetional sliders out of a truck peaked my interest.  

The sliders have always been delicious, and nothing beat getting some ""window love""showing up right when they hit that days location so you can get that mystery slider which has never missed the mark imo.  Although I'll miss hitting up the truck but on special occasions like 1st Friday, the fact that I can hit this place place up any time and enjoy some sliders all but makes up for it.

This place is as awesome as a Hall and Oates Album, an autograph Air Supply poster, and a case of PBR.....yes....it has a special place in my heart. 

A couple years ago, the Slidin Thru truck aka The Slider Truck opened up, and I was blown away by it's magical levels of wonder. Did that last sentence make any sense? No. Who the hell cares?

Everything about this brick and mortar location is aesthetically pleasing and matches the tone that Ric set when the truck opened for business a while back.

The Barbie, the Pep, the Ya Ya...everything is amazing. 

You won't be disappointed with this place, because it truly is a gem amongst gems in Vegas. The only downside, is the location. It's a little tricky to find, so make sure that whoever is sitting shotgun, pays attention.

there's two sides to this building, the door to the left goes to the poker bar, so veer to the right for yummy burger goodness.

the art on the wall... SICK!  the decor and layout is comfortable and clean... colorful and inviting.   it's not the biggest place and doesn't offer a lot of seating, so... they need to add a couple more tables.  

for our first visit... we came in at like 2:30 am after a night of drinking and it was loud.  I guess they had a guest DJ who blasted trip hop music for what seemed like thousands when there really was only 10 people in the whole joint... 8 of the 10 was our group, so it was a bit overwhelming in the little restaurant.   I did my best to drone out the hypnotic music to focus on the most important task at hand:  deciding my burger coma fate! but it was tough.

the mystery slider is different everyday? every week.. idk but on this particular night.. MY  ""special"" was the captain's order...  cucumber, arugula, feta, bacon, balsamic reduction...  holy crap, i was in heaven!  
Barby= my husband loved.. caramelized jalapeno?  WHAT?  
Pulled Pork= we both loved... the pulled pork was excellent. 

i've also tried the pep pep which is also an amazing burger. 

All the specialty fries are super good as well.. but I love the sweetness of the sweet potato fries or ""s'mores fries"".. DUDE.  SO GOOD. althooooough, we did go there one time and they offered sweet potato tots because they ran out of fries?  i decided to skip the tots and overload on the captain fries... which, was the bomb.com.

My favorite burger: caprese  mozzarella, eggplant, basil... sigh. i want one now.

2000489,2011-03-07,0,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,"My friend came home from work one day, telling tales about fries he experienced during lunch that were better than animal style fries. Say what? I'll be the judge of that one. So fast forward a bit, and I find myself at HQ to sample some of these reportedly amazing fries.

I am a huge fan of the slider truck and all of their slider offerings. The new HQ is a cute little spot. I love the murals and whole decor. But it is also a little awkward because aside from two large semi-circle booths, there is really nowhere to sit. (There was a cluster of chairs, but no tables. And a long community table, but no stools.)

I ordered the Captain Fries, which seemed the most adventurous of the three offerings, and a mystery slider. After a bit of a wait, the slider was ready. But the fries had somehow been forgotten. So they rush ordered the fries and I had those a few minutes later. Well, the mystery slider (as is standard with Slidin' Thru) was delicious. It was a garlic steak sandwich with feta, provolone, and spinach. Fantastic flavors. The fries, though, were a big disappointment. The fries themselves weren't very good and were definitely undercooked. And while the toppings were ok, it just didn't work that well. Hopefully, the barby and pep fries work better (and my friend swears they do).

So while I love the slider truck, HQ misses the mark a little bit. I think, ultimately, there is just something about a food truck and that whole experience. And that major element was missing here - it's just not the same and it can't be.

However, props for being 24 hours and for the fries being a very large portion. And again, the decor is rather neat. And the staff is great as usual.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,4,2,3,Ilj-08-M5Iya2jcE_jtfFw

The Grand Opening was CRAZY.  I guess I don't have a problem finding this place because that night it was hard to miss - the truck was there, a video game truck, a TON of cars as well as a crazy line.  They do have a great fan base.  The restaurant directly reflects the feel almost perfectly of the truck.  It's awesome.  Also, LOVE the retro games.  I am a little sad the photo booth disappeared after the grand opening - that was so fun!  It would be a cute idea to keep around for customers to post their pics with their mini-burgs.  =)

Seating is VERY limited and a couple of times I have eaten in their lounge couch-type area.  I half-joking, half-seriously suggested to one of them that they should get some TV trays.  Hey, a TV is already in there.

The prices of the mystery sliders can be a little much but it IS special and the one I don't regretting paying extra for is the Buffalo Soldier.  Do I wish it was a dollar or two cheaper?  Yeah, but I also don't frequent this place enough to nickle and dime their prices.  It is a treat and I treat it as such.  =)

Only downer is the service.  I know the employees are friendly and at the truck I NEVER had an issue, but here they can be *too* friendly -- more often than not when I have been waiting to order or actually in the process of ordering they will greet (and chat for a few minutes with) someone that has come up to the counter instead of addressing the person already in front of them.  I really did not like that.  It's cool that you know a lot of your patrons, but it's still a business.  Customer service is a pet peeve of mine.  I guess if you are someone who comes here religiously or are friends with them outside of the restaurant it's cool, but for most of us who don't really fit in that category it just feels tacky.

What to order: Porky w/o 'penos, PepPep fries w/extra sauce... and the epic, crazy, out-of-this-world, make-sure-you-have-friends-to-share-them-with-or-you-will-get-diabetes S'mores Sweet Fries.

The inside is bright, and when we went it was also loud with a live DJ spinning high above the dining area. The counter staff were friendly and easy to talk to despite the music, offering us advice on which of the burg's were the best.

The food is essentially the same as the truck's menu, with the addition of their super fries! They're like chili fries but better, with several varieties. We tried the barbyfries and they were definitely the perfect kind of thing to sop up beer and set you straight; awesomely convenient considering there is a fully functional bar next door! They were also a large portion, big enough for the three of us to split and still have room for a slider or three.

The sliders were consistent with the quality of the truck in taste and content. We also sampled the mystery slider, which was called something like ""The Dankness"" and had a ton of different toppings.

Got myself 2 Barby sliders for $5, a nice sized slider with a lot of taste and texture, I loved it, the sauce is still lingering in my mouth, excellent combination of sweet and heat. Added some Pepefries for $5 which was loaded with cheese, bacon, and their super sauce, enough for a meal by it self.  And some Calypso Ocean Blue Lemonade.  They have good selection of bottled drinks and sodas for $2.

It really felt like a good chill place to hangout and out of the vegas heat. I like the comic book decoration all over the place, magazine clips on the wall of the restroom, arcade games which is not free, different dining or sitting areas, and food.

I circled the building a couple times and probably would have just gone home, but I decided to go in the bar (Paradise Poker) and ask the bartender where this place was, since bartenders generally know everything.  Turns out, it's right next to the bar, but you can't see it until you actually get out of your car.   I was there with a group of friends celebrating a birthday, and on paper, this seemed like a great place for a party.  They have 2 arcade games and an xbox hooked up on the big screen.  One of the arcade games was broken and my friend had to mess with the TV for a while to get the xbox to work (notice my friend was doing this, not the employees).  The place, although colorfully decorated, was pretty dirty.  It looked like the floor hadn't been swept all day.  The employees working were a bunch of young guys who seemed to care more about hanging out with each other than serving the customers.  One of their friends was just hanging out there drinking a tall can of bud light (do they have the proper license for that??), and they would rather talk to him than the customers.  We all got in line to order our food.  I ordered first and tried to get the pulled pork slider.  He told me they were out of pork.  So I went with the ""mystery"" slider, the barby, and the pep pep.  Apparently they charge $2 extra (almost the price of another slider) for the mystery slider.  He did not mention this to me when ordering.  Like I said, I ordered first out of the group, but everyone else (6-7 orders) got their food before I got mine.  Obviously they forgot about my order.  Almost a half hour later I finally got my sliders.  The employee tried to high five me when he finally brought it out.  No ""sorry for the wait sir"" or anything remotely professional.  Most of my friends were almost done eating at this point.  So now to the food: The barby slider was by far the best out of the three.  The pep pep was also good.  The mystery slider that cost me $5 was just a piece of meat with two fried, overcooked stuffed jalapenos on it.  I took one bite and tossed it.  To top it all off, about 20 minutes after leaving I had a mean case of the sh*ts.   I'll never go there again, and I'd advise anyone who values customer service to avoid this place like the plague.",C-JBJ7GNPUmY1xtqqEXV8w,1,0,1,2nCJp3ZC3mdIzW6Uiuq0EQ

Just off Sunset on the corner of Paradise and Grier is where Slidin Thru HQ is. If you can't find it, you may see signs for Paradise Poker Club first, and its right next door. 

It is kind of small, but it has a patio area where you can eat outside, also an inside area where its very uniquely designed and air conditioned. Enough room to eat inside and chill for a bit. I say its well designed, especially for those who love their food. 

I usually go for the Pep Pep sliders and their Barby fries. The sliders are easily to finish, but the fries on the other hand, are a lot to handle. They are really really good, its just they give you a big bowl of it. Got to love it!

Slidin' Thru HQ is the perfect storm of selection, unique flavors, and value! As a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur, I have tried many burger places in town.  Slidin' Thru HQ ranks as one of the top three in my book!

Let's start with the burgers.  They are the perfect combination of gourmet and and simplicity.  My personal favorite is the Captain Slider.  It has simple ingredients, yet is topped with balsamic reduction and feta cheese.  I also LOVE the Pulled Porky!  This is Slidin' Thru's version of a pulled pork BBQ sandwich.  The devilishly tender pork is topped with caramelized jalapenos!  I was nervous at first, but the caramelizing process produces a sweet heat, rather than a burning sensation.  

No visit to the Slidin' Thru HQ is complete without trying some of their specialty fries.  In a nutshell, they take the toppings from their sliders and pile them atop crispy made to order french fries.  Once again, Slidin' Thru creates a flavor masterpiece in the S'mores fries!  Think campfire favorite meets urban cuisine!  Marshmallows, chocolate, and Graham cracker crumbs coat sweet potato fries!  This is by far the most sinfully delicious item on the menu!  While this may be sweetness overload, the portion size is HUGE!  This is definitely an item you would want to share!  A great date night idea!

The girl behind the counter was pretty nice and friendly even though I was a regular human being instead of a hipster emo scene kid.

I ordered two sliders, the barby and the pulled porky.  Let me preface by saying that I don't like sliders.  They are a waste of money.  Sliders are always too much bun and not enough substance.  These were no exception.

The barby was barbecue sauce and onion straws and bacon.  The bacon was pretty good as it was caramelized.  A pretty standard combination of toppings that is hard to screw up.  Well, they didn't screw up the toppings, they screwed up the burger.  The burger was overcooked and dry.  An overcooked burger with a ton of bun and a little bit of topping is not my idea of a tasty meal.

The pulled pork slider didn't have enough sauce.  I think it would have been pretty good actually if it was wetter.  Also, even though I've mentioned it a few times already, this had too much bun.

The best part of my meal was the fries which I got topped with the barby stuff.  Although delicious I can't give slidin' thru too much credit; it's pretty hard to ruin something as good as fries topped with bacon, cheese, and bbq sauce.  I would have perfered thicker and less crispy fries though.

In short, this place is wildly overrated and is so hipster-centric that it's irritating.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,3,2,3,7Rgg7QKpxrpjSJPXnPFt7Q

They add $2 if you order the Mystery Burger as one of your burgers in the 2/$5 deal.   But of course, they don't disclose this either on the wall menu or verbally.  

The sweet potato fries/smores are a neat idea, but way too much brown sugar and marshmallow creme.  Almost impossible to eat more than 2 bites.  But you might be able to share amongst a group.  

The YaYa burger itself was pretty low quality, tasteless meat.   And the iceberg lettuce on it was very low quality.  

Compare the ingredients yourself with the ingredients at Bachi Burger and I think you'll agree there is no comparison.

They also had their truck out in the parking lot, so I can see why some people got confused and thought they'd be ordering from the truck.  Anyway, once inside, we were transported into a very colorfully decorated restaurant with graffiti art everywhere.

We ordered six urgers:

-The Barby - Great little burger with BBQ sauce and crispy onion strings.  Would order this one again.
-The Yaya - Basically a ""Greek"" burger.  Tasted okay.
-The Pulled Porky - One of my favorites.  Sweet and savory!
-Captain's Order - Came with a balsamic reduction and bacon.  I'm not a fan of Feta Cheese, so I only took a small bite.
-The Caprese - For vegetarians.  I didn't like this one too much - it was too big to bite, though the fresh mozzarella was good
-The Mystery Slider -  FYI - this is an extra $2.  I can't recall everything in it, but it had a TON of meat, which I think was sliced steak.  Seriously - a ton of meat.  I don't recall much else about it.
-Fries - VERY crunchy - almost made me think they were burnt.  However, I like crunchy fries, so I really liked these.

The burgers were 3 for $7 (or 3 for $9 if you order one Mystery Slider).  The six burgers were too much for the two of us.  While the burgers were creative, I wish they'd change their buns.  The buns were really hard (probably bc they grilled them) and too big.  We ended up throwing the top part of the buns away and eating the patty with the meat on the bottom.  I like a bun that is crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside.  These were more like lumps of bread.  Outside of that, everything else was good and the employees working there are really friendly.",JA4Rw3qdKuGDCFbexnbN5w,0,0,4,NqPqNee4z6Na6M3nGWSM7Q

The key is mixing it up and even more key than that is having delicious choices to be able to mix and match.  My first visit to the HQ was pretty sweet.  I saw on Twitter that they were having a French Dip and I've been craving that for a few weeks, ask my pregnant wife (sympathy cravings?).  The French Dip was pretty great as well as the Barby Fries.  I mean, those fries were scrumtrelescent!

5019864,2011-04-30,3,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,"Checked out Slidin Thru HQ during our recent adventure to Vegas.  Interesting setup, as there wasn't an official sign on the building, we found it by spotting their truck parked out front.  The inside is fun and interesting, but they definitely need more seating, that's for sure.

I ordered the Barby, Captain's Order and the Pep Pep.  First off, I'm not a fan of the whole Angus Beef thing.  I love my beef but, I just don't care for it.  With that said however, I actually liked the meat in my sliders.  It was tasty and juicy but even though it's in a slider size, it's still overwhelming.

The Barby was good, it was a nice combo of ingredients, can't hate on the fried onions and bacon, they both can make any burger, or in this case, slider better!  The Pep Pep was alright, probably a little too basic, even though that's what they were going for.  The Captain's Order, yikes.  Although it sounded awesome on their menu, with the feta cheese, bacon, arugula, roma tomato and the balsamic reduction, oh man...it killed my palette.  Balsamic and beef is not a good combination, it almost made me feel like the beef tasted rancid.

However, we ordered the Captain's Order in a french fry form and that redeemed oh Captain, my captain.  That was probably the most bomb order of fries I've ever had, next to Carne Asada Fries.  It was seriously delicious, the ingredient combo worked for the fries, but not for the slider.

The s/o ordered the Pulled Porky, the Barby and the Mystery Slider, which was a French Dip.  Although the s/o was excited to find out that the Mystery Slider was a French Dip unfortunately, all three were quite meh.  What set it off was that they charged an extra $2 for the Mystery Slider.

Speaking of which, the pricing was pretty decent, we both just disagreed with the $2 premium on the Mystery Slider, which made it a $5 slider.  Also, I don't know why they have to be so shady on soda refills.  Apparently, the first refill is free and they'll even mark your cup, but any additional refills are $0.50 each.  The hit my hot button, charging for refills, I consider that bad business, especially for a burger joint, no bueno.

Overall, Slidin Thru HQ was alright, way overrated.  Would I come back?  Yeah, but just for the fries and nothing else.",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,2,1,3,txBH6Wjh08PyJECIFaJDdA
5199134,2011-03-15,9,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,"Yes. That pretty much sums up my sentiments towards this little cutie. Yes, it's stylin'. Yes, it is tasty. Yes, you should be there. In fact, if it is past 2am and you're hungry, there's virtually nowhere else you should be.

Confession: I don't frequent food trucks more than the average bear, but I respect  and love them because they represent much more than a culinary movement, especially around Vegas. Thus, HQ is perfect for me! The vibe does not disappoint one bit. I actually like the hidden, obscure location, as getting there feels like a bit of an insider's adventure. Once you're there, you enter a place full of passion and community. Plus, it is actually bigger, cleaner and better than I imagined! Those upholstered, monogrammed booths are insane! Can I have one please? You can pose as a Slidin' Thru astronaut. #Blastoff! They have arcade games. Wapow! It feels like a secret playhouse where you don't need a password, just an empty belly. 

The food is the same as your faves from the truck, which means I snacked on two pulled porkies. I loved the little porkie as much as ever. Pulled pork and pickles are like candy to my Southern taste buds. I also sampled the caprese, and vegetarians won't be disappointed. We chowed on a selection from their new superfries- the s'mores covered in marshmallow cream. Devastatingly delicious, but you will have to bring four of your closest pals if you want to finish them.

It's a real special spot. Put it on a short list of ""Must Dos"" for Vegas if you're trying to get a taste of the spirit of locals.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,21,5,RnmPWjOHT4RLGlmy7cOoiA

The least liked, Captains order, it was different, the arugula, feta cheese and balsamic reduction went well together, but I am an old fashion burger lover, so I want something simple. My favorite, Pep Pep, it's most like my idea of a burger, simple, bacon lettuce, tomato, onions, pickle, and sauce. 

Couldn't leave without trying some fries, the Captains order something different, fries, smothered with bacon, cheese, onions, and special sauce, it tasted like tartar sauce, something that would go good with my fish burger, I didn't really care for this.

I have heard nothing but amazing things about ""the slider truck"" that roams Las Vegas, and yet I hadn't had my first taste... until this past Saturday. Slidin' Thru has been in business for just over a year now, and yet they are already a local sensation, becoming the first mobile food to open a stationary restaurant. Slidin' Thru HQ has a great atmosphere. It feels just like you've walked into a comic book. There are comfy places to sit, including a retro hand chair! Can't get much cooler than that... except for the spray painted mural. The people who run the restaurant, as well as the truck, are super friendly and just seem like a fun group! 

But all of that pales in comparison to the delicious food. It's really the sliders that keep people coming back for more. I had the Pep Pep, which has the traditional cheeseburger toppings, and it was rather tasty. I also tried both types of fries (regular and sweet potato) which were scrumptious, but if you haven't heard it from everyone else by now, the Pulled Porky is really the star of the show!
