We got the orders of Pad Kee Mao (Drinkin Noodles) and one General Tso Chicken plane (sorry for misspelling it). The only problem we really had was the onion. Our dishes had a lot of onions that took almost 1/3 our plate. OTHER THAN THAT THOUGH, the quality and quantity is there!!!

She literally remember my order better than my boyfriend does because one time he called to pick up, walked in and she said: oh no, if I know it was you we would have left out the onions in your pad Thai. She apologized profusely for something that my partner of 2 years didn't even remember.  She always fill up our drinks even before it gets halfway (my bf goes through like at least 4 cups per dinner and we never find a server that can keep up with him).I seriously cannot rave enough about this woman.

Their food is really well done too. I always get their shrimp pad Thai because the shrimps are always cooked perfectly. Most places really overcook their shrimp making it rubbery. Their orange chicken is hands down the best we've ever had, I know, surprising considering it's a Thai place.

233134,2015-08-17,1,QmVF3KJ07PsdroCFwOC_Ow,"So here is my review of this thai place, we ordered thai som tham (papaya salad) and they didn't put the little dried shrimps which is kind of the main ingredient if you get this dish anywhere else, the other food was ok, however I will say the prices are good, and u get a decent portion .

If the quality was better I would give it 5 stars for sure, but with this being said if u want thai food, and cheap...give this place a shot maybe it's better than my review.

Service fluctuates depending on who's helping you. The older, shorter woman normally serves me and she's great. Very fast, attentive, and she even memorized my usual order. My cup of water never gets below half because she refills it so often. However the other taller younger woman is slow to take your order and rarely comes by the table. It was like pulling teeth to get her to come by and refill my water, but it might be reluctance due to the language barrier. Luckily the younger woman has only been my server twice. 

The calamari appetizer is delicious and the lunch specials are pretty good with decent portions. The specials come with a small soup, salad, chips, rice, and of course the entree. I've had the orange chicken as well as the sesame chicken and both were excellent.

However 90% of the time I order my personal favorite, pad see ew with chicken, which unfortunately is not on the lunch menu so it's a bit pricier albeit not too bad. They ask you how spicy you want it (1-5) and I usually go with 1 or 2. I learned the hard way not to be a hero and go 3+ because it will slowly burn your mouth until becomes hell incarnate. The noodles aren't overly oily like I've seen other places and it has just the right amount of flavor and kick, reminiscent of good home cooking.

Did take out with this spot tonight. Got their Rangoons, jerky and spicy duck basil.

I have arrived home, and to my surprise, the rangoons are still somewhat crispy. They are creamy, and delicious. The sauce that comes with it is a little sweet... but it doesnt kill the taste of the filling.

The thai jerky didnt really have much flavor. I know its jerky... but it was pretty tough, dry and kind of flavorless. The sauce that came with it almost reminded me of a buffalo sauce....and almost made it worse.

Now, for my entrée. 

When i order something that has SPICY in its name.... i expect it to be....you know.... Spicy.

Nothing in this dish was spicy. I dont even think theres black pepper in the sauce....which tasted like soy sauce and maple syrup. The duck was kind of oddly cooked.... with some pieces being decently tender... and others feelings like i was chewing on a strand of yarn.

My mouth was tingly from the spices. They were not stingy on the tofu or the bamboo shoots and it came with a very generous amount of rice.

Service was good, food even better. Best Pad Thai that I had had in awhile. I love Vegas food. I kick myself that I did not detour on the way home and bring some back with me.

The other dish we selected was the chow mein. Huge hit. You get won tons with each dish and either white rice or salad. I do not like dressing and they hit the salads hard with it, only complaint. Dressing should come on the side esp. when the food is ordered to go. It just drowned the lettuce badly BUT the portions of the main dishes were good and actually fed us twice.

I ordered a Thai iced coffee, which was pretty good!  I would have liked it a tad bit stronger, but it was lightly sweet and creamy and had a nice rich coffee flavor.  Small glass, but good stuff.

For lunch I had the Duck Curry, which is a dish I often order at a lot of places.  Ive realized that most places don't do this dish very well, but Chao does a solid job at this one.  The curry is watery, as any good Bankok style curry should be, and packed a lot of flavor.  I ordered a 5/5, and the heat level was pretty solid as well. The duck had  touch of gristle to it, but other than that was a better quality than most Thai restaurants.  I think they might prepare the roast duck themselves, instead of buying it pre-prepared like a lot of Thai restaurants do.  The curry had pineapple, cherry tomatoes, red and green peppers, and basil.  All of the fruit and veggies tasted very fresh and juicy.

It was a unique experience because it was both chewy and crunchy, breaded with chives. I didn't really taste any volcano, but I still loved the flavor. Maybe they considered the sweet and sour sauce the volcano.

I also tried another appetizer that was like an empanadas... And boy was that tastey. It had a juicy potato and meat filled center, with a peanut sauce I never bothered to use.

The service was on par, I had my water probably refilled fifty times. The staff was nice and did not seem upset that I had a lengthy visit due to getting lost in conversation. My last comment is that I was impressed how they split the bill.

The only reason why I give this place four stars is because of the pictures. I ordered coconut that ice cream and got a plate very different than what their picture had. I had a random chocolate whipped cream and the picture had nuts. The cream made the ice cream a little too sweet, versus what the expected peanuts would have provided.

The broccoli was still crisp, just like I want.  The noodles were well cooked.  The seasoning was spot on.  There was a little more heat that I expected for a Se-Ew, but I'm not going to fault them for that because I didn't specify no heat.

I am going to echo the statements of many other posters.  The portion size left something to be desired.  Typically, I will eat about half of my portion from other restaurants and save the rest for another meal.  Here, I ate every single bite.  It was a smaller-square styrofoam box that wasn't particularly full.  For $10, they could afford to give me more noodles.  Along the same line, there wasn't a lot of meat in the box.  I didn't actually count, but I would guess that there were 15-ish small pieces of beef in the entire meal.  There were only six sticks of broccoli (I did count those because it seemed like so few).

So, I am on the fence.  The food is tasty and being right across from UNLV, it is convenient for my night classes... but I would have liked more bang for my buck.  Perhaps the $6 lunch price is more appropriate to the portion of food that you receive.  I'm still giving them the 4 stars because the food was tasty and the service was good.

3033035,2014-02-01,1,QmVF3KJ07PsdroCFwOC_Ow,"The Good:
I really love the flavor of the food in this place. My wife and I would order from them all the time.  We would always get the pad see ew, which is amazing! The crunchy pork with the chinese broccoli is also a favorite of ours.  It's also conveniently close to our apartment and my work.  So if we're craving some Thai food, I just order and pick up.  

Here's a tip, if you live in the vicinity, I suggest you just pick up, unless you're literally just around the corner.  If you order through their website or from eat24.com, even if you live less than 2 miles, they will still charge you $7 for delivery, since for some reason, there's some sort of glitch in the system and if you don't speak Thai, then explaining is not really an option. 

Dislikes:
I would say that there are just a few things I dislike about Chao Thai.  First is that for the price of their a la carte 6.95 and up, the quantity is not that much.  So if you're planning to feed more than 2-3 people on a couple of dishes, you may want to order extra.  Also, we went there tonight and ordered the Mongolian beef. Now, my wife and I LOVE Mongolian Beef and we order it at almost every Chinese restaurant we go to.  It's pretty much how we measure the quality of most Asian establishments that serves the dish (I know, WEIRD).  So we ordered the Mongolian beef and when we got the dish, there was literally, about 15 small pieces of beef and the rest was onions..............awwwkward.  So I asked the waiter and he said that's how it is.  WTF!? Seriously? I wanted to complain, but my wife was tired and told me to just let it go.  She was more upset about it because it's one of her favorites.  The flavor was really great, but the portion of the meat in the dish was HIGHLY disproportionate.  They should have called the dish ONION with a side of Beef............ RUDE! 

Lastly, we ordered from Chao Thai at my office not too long ago and one of my colleagues ordered the Pepper Steak lunch special.  Now, I'm not EINSTEIN or anything, but correct me if I'm wrong, when you hear STEAK, you know it's BEEF right?? Well, I called and asked why it's an extra $1.00 for the beef option?  And yes, when you order online, they ask you if you want chicken, pork, tofu or beef for an extra $1.  Here's my problem with this.  First of all, the dish is PEPPER S-T-E-A-K.  Meaning.......beef is already implied in the dish.  So why not just charge $1 more......  no, they actually give you an option and charge you a $1 more for what the dish is SUPPOSED to come with.  It's not a big deal, but when I called and inquired, the lady I spoke to said, ""beef cost more, that's why it's a dollar extra.""  Uhm, I didn't ask for an economic lecture, Lady! She also said, ""Nobody has ever complained before."" Again.......... WTF? Maybe no one has ever ordered online and got the $1 extra option!! I didn't want our food to be spat on so I just said, fine, just deliver it! 

I would give them an extra star if they stop being so DAMN CHEAP about they meat!!!!! Damn!!!!!

In fact I actually love this about Chao Thai and I'm going to be visiting more often I think. The other main reason to go to Chao Thai over other options in the area is this: Green Curry Fried Rice. I've never seen it offered anywhere else and I guarantee that it alone is worth a try. It has all the flavors of a green curry wrapped up in a fried rice without all the soupy mess. It's almost like the spices get soaked up by the rice and it makes the dish hotter. The level 4 (out of 5) was making me sweat but it wasn't so hot I couldn't keep eating. We also ordered the tofu pad see ew and chicken panang curry. Both were good, but the tofu in the pad see ew was bland and the pieces of tofu were larger than one bite. Honestly nothing else matters but the green curry fried rice. Come here, get that, and anything else you order will be just fine.

3651932,2013-01-22,0,QmVF3KJ07PsdroCFwOC_Ow,"I am always looking for a good Thai place that delivers to my house because I'm fat, picky and lazy.

I think I have found a winner!

When evaluating Thai places, I use my standard order Pad Thai, Prik King and some curry (mostly red or yellow, panang if I'm feeling frisky, never duck always a disappointment).  Bottom line up front:  its good, not great, obviously cheap but flavorful.

How can a Thai place screw up Pad Thai?!  Try Weera and you'll see (FYI weera is the exact opposite of this place, huge portions, terrible flavor)!  This was very good Pad Thai, the flavor was slightly sweet and tangy....perfect.  Chicken was pretty dry and minimal but that is a common thread in all of their dishes.

Prik King is like a spicy flavor explosion in your mouth.  Even if you don't like green beans, try it!  The only problem with their Prik King is the lack of fresh lime leaves.  The lime leaves give it a citrusy pop that combats the powerful red curry base.  The dried leaves they use aren't a very good substitute.  However the dish is still delicious and well composed.  However finding meat was like hunting through a red swamp of deliciousness.

I went with the red curry this time.  Oh so flavorful and tasty!  Again not generously meaty but the spice level and depth of flavor were spot on!  The bamboo shoots weren't the freshest.

And for an appetizer we went with the fried wontons.  Save your money!  There was about a penny sized meat mixture in each dollar bill sized wonton.  The dipping sauce was spot on though.

So the moral of the story is, Chao Thai will cut corners on you (minimal meat and/or fillings) but the flavors are spot on!  I'm so lazy that I will tolerate their less than filling fillings for good taste and a delivery boy.",LnZfyAcTPN7Lc7DJxeGlOQ,0,0,4,sLje4q6INS6M7YySjCrmlA

3715561,2013-05-27,0,QmVF3KJ07PsdroCFwOC_Ow,"Three of my classmates and I went here for lunch one day after school. From earlier that week, they said they had really good food and the owner changed. I went in and I thought ""Hey this place looks better now"" and I started to believe my friends. The menu was reasonably priced, especially their lunch special. However, their customer service ruined my experienced. After we sat down and ordered, 10 minutes later this large group of people came in. The waitress had asked us to move to another table (its not like we had a choice) so the larger group coulld sit together and we moved quietly. This was strike number one. I've been to restaurants throughout the valley and I've never been asked to move for a group of people who did not make a reservation and came after us. If this was the case, then the waitress should be seating people instead. Personally, that group should have divided themselves if they couldn't fit within two tables. Anyways, strike number two: my friend ordered a pad thai 3 with beef and I ordered pad thai 2 with chicken. On a scale of 5, I can't handle a level 3. When our orders came out, the waitress couldn't differentiate between chicken  pad thai and beef pad thai and didn't know which dish had spicy level 2 or 3. She just assumed which dish was which and handed it to us. She did nothing to double check she gave us the right dish nor was she friendly or apologetic. Strike three: The pad thai was extremely disappointing. It is probably one of the worst ones i've ever had. I don't understand how you can mess it up. The noodles were slightly soggy, the flavor was barely there, and I could taste the spice more than I could than the traditional flavor that should be in a pad thai. Needless to say, I don't intend on coming back until they change their customer service. I would rather pay the price and drive some where farther for a knowledgable staff and consistently great food. The only reason why I am giving it a two star is because the prices are reasonable and I am hoping for future improvements.",oOzf7vYQq2C3f5fK1jeMPw,4,0,2,q3uy3RxidDJt17k60C7KBg

I will start with the food. I haven't been disappointed with the flavors. Everything has been good. Portions are a bit small as many others have mentioned. My main issue comes from the 1st and second time I ordered food via delivery rather than going into the restaurant itself. The first time they delivered, it was a $2 delivery charge. They are literally 2 miles away from my apartment. 6 minute drive. The second time, without notice.. the delivery fee jumped to $7. A significant increase. 

I really liked the food enough to order food from them.. Unfortunately, It's enough to never order delivery from them again - with that steep delivery charge.  Doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather drive there.. but it seems a bit shady, so I'm not feeling good about supporting them again. Sounds petty, but it's the principle of the matter I suppose. 

So if you want to give it a try, head over and do not order delivery, unless you don't mind the fee.  Happy eating!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,9,6,3,Wiz7eG4qjwLmrQjdrM04wg

Lucky for me Chao Thai was impressive. The three of us (boss, co-worker and myself) were greeted and seated immediately. We each asked for water to drink and were asked if we wanted lemon in our water. I'm quite sure we were brought water with lime though. No matter. It was still refreshing. 

In the mean time, we each turned directly to the lunch menu. My boss knew already that she wanted chicken pad thai. My co-worker went with panang pork at a spice level 1. I went with panang chicken at a spice level 2. A few moments after we ordered we were brought our first round of food, vegetable soup. Mostly it was broth with cabbage, cilantro and lemon grass. It had a strong ginger bite and a little sour note. My boss couldn't eat it because of the spice of the ginger. My co-worker ate it but said it cleared her sinuses. It made my lips tingle. Not a bad soup but not my favorite.

Soon after we had finished our soups our lunches were dedelivered. We each started with the spring roll on the side. It was perfectly crisp and flaky but not overly greasy. The vegetables and glass noodles rolled within were perfect. Two out of three in our party agreed. The third said she wanted meat in it rather than vegetables. Her preference. My bosses pad thai looked delicious and she confirmed my guess. The panang was just about euphoric as a good curry should be. The pungent curry spice. The sweet rich coconut. It creats a heavenly blend that has a way of putting my soul at ease. This version has bell pepper and green beans. The green beans were an interesting touch I had not experienced in a panang before. Not a bad addition but wholey unexpected. Much like the serrano or jalepeno pepper I got a bite of thinking it was a green bean. I bit into something more crisp and my mouth lit up. I could feel it on my tongue, in my throat and in my nose. It made me cough, sweat and drool. Now, as my co-worker before me, my sinuses were clearing. The burn went away in short order. 

The food was grand and the service excellent. The prices are a fair $6.95 for a filling lunch. The staff is friendly and attentive even telling my boss she had dropped her napkin and bringing her a new one.

When I try out new Thai place I usually go w/ the REGULAR: PAD THAI! If you can not cook a decent order of Pad Thai, I'm cool on trying anything else on your menu.  That's Taco Bell f'n up your tacos and that's what they are known for...smh LUDICROUS 

FYI: no UNLV discount  is given. So if you all up in yo' feelings about them not giving a discount, take yo' ass back across the street to the COMMONS or STU. UNION.

Ok, so I ordered the REGULAR w/ tofu, spice level 3 (spice levels are 1-5), spring roll and endamame.

PAD THAI: I'll give them the GREEN light, it was good, spice level 3 was a tad bit spicier than I expected.  It was killing my palet, its a slow burn, once it hit the back of my tongue my entire mouth was on fire.  Huge pieces of tofu, just right not tough and overcooked nor was it ""juicey"" and under cooked, perfect balance.  It absorbed all the flavors of the pad thai, not over saturated.  Bean sprouts, carrots and chopped peanuts are served on the side

SPRING ROLL: Nice crisp, it does not leave you with greasy fingers and tips.

EDAMAME: um yea, this is where I was like ""I could've opted out on these right here"" Blanched in water and served. Because I ordered my food to go, at home I was able to spruce up and the flavor the endamame to my liking.

Will i go back to the place: YES
It's on the way home from work and it's good, on a scale of 1-10, I'll give them a 7.5. Next time I go back I think I might try their Tom - Kha or the Curry.

Super nice staff, cute little place, a place where you can take a small group and get A LOT of food for a little price.  My order can feed two and have some leftover for the next day.  But this is just my opinion, try it out and see what your take is on it...

TIP FOR THE STUDENT(S) ON A BUDGET:
Now if you're that student on a budget, you can definitely split an 1 entree and 2 appetizers between 4ppl and have change leftover.  Now with your change, whomever in the group that has the 64oz cup from 7-11 and refill for $1.07 and split the remaining $0.33 between the 4 of you.

The pad thai is delicious! I always get a level 3, sans peanuts or carrots. The lunch special comes with a soup, and like a deep fried won ton skin, so good!

There are a wide range of lunch special choices for $5.99!  The Thai iced tea is really good and cheap too.  The salad dressing is a bit iffy but they have different soups each day of the week for lunch, and the lunch special includes soup, salad, and vegetarian eggroll.

I have been to Chao 3 times for lunch - once ordering the chicken chili, once for the spicy basil eggplant, and once for the beef satay.  Overall, everything has been decent.  You get a choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu unless the meat is already specified.  There are 2 noodle dishes on the lunch menu as well.

What I have discovered is that the peanut sauce is really delicious.  Yesterday I ordered the beef satay lunch special - so we started with egg drop soup and basic salad.  Then, I received a beautiful plate (see photo) - it had 4 skewers of marinated beef which tasted great on their own but the peanut sauce elevated them, a mini cucumber-red onion salad, white steamed rice, and an eggroll with sweet dipping sauce.

Thai food is usually family style, and they only offer combo plates during lunch time. Unfortunate for a solo diner, so I settled on the eggplant dish which came with rice.

Wanted to add extra veggies including broccoli, peppers, & onions to the order however there was NO button for this request on Yelp (This is the case with many restaurants- reason for 4 stars). I left a request in the notes, knowing there would probably be an extra charge. I received a call from the restaurant asking about exactly what I wanted and he explained that there would be an extra charge. He wanted to make sure I was ok with it. I just needed to give the delivery person $2 cash for the extra veggies, and $1 cash for the extra egg. Next time I will know to have cash ready and to put it in the notes so it will be a smooth transaction. The food was EXCELLENT! Friendly service, followed instructions, and timely delivery. Will order again. I hope it's consistent. Fingers crossed. :)",YHU8CYdBOXk2IwkKYjEGPQ,0,0,4,J1EzZwVQzJd3D7VzX7ideQ

5278125,2014-08-22,1,QmVF3KJ07PsdroCFwOC_Ow,"The $5.95 lunch special is what initially lured me into Chao Thai Restaurant, and believe me, that is a sweet deal for everything you get. The atmosphere when I walked in was a little chaotic - the waitress was obviously stressed out and the place was buzzing. I decided to get the Spicy Basil Tofu with a spicy level of 3. Less than a minute after taking my order, a small bowl of egg drop soup and a salad was placed before me. What? That's included in the lunch special? This is going to be a great lunch!

The egg drop soup was pretty tasty. It had tofu, green onions, and carrots in it. Unlike most egg drop soups I've tasted, this soup was packed with flavor and had just the right consistency. The salad was nice and crisp and the dressing was perfect. The only downer so far was that I got my drink after I was halfway through the soup and salad. 

Before I could finish the soup and salad, my entree came out. At first, I was weirded out by all the little green bits piled on the plate. Don't be scared of the green things! They're delicious. Anyways, the Spicy Basil Tofu was on point and came with a nice little mound of white rice and what I thought was a spring roll. Lo and behold, it's a fried banana egg roll! Yay! I get dessert too!

You become a snob and nothing is good enough. Wrong! Only assholes do that. I've traveled to at least 26 countries and if I had that attitude/ mentality, I would never dine out again.

My recent trip to Bangkok, I had the pleasure of eating the best pad Thai ever from Thip Samai and I thought I will be ruined for life because nothing compares to it and that I'll come home with a snooty 'tude. Fresh local ingredients, the water, age-old recipe, ambiance and even ones personal state of mind/ emotions at the time all affect how we feel about food.

I've been craving for Thai food since I came home. This tiny restaurant is across the street from UNLV but from my building, it's a hike I was willing to take on a rainy day. I got here and realized I had forgotten my wallet in my car. I dug out $15 from my backpack. Ha! They have lunch specials for $6.60! No UNLV student goes hungry today.

I had the Pad Thai lunch special that came with a soup and salad. The soup is a clear broth with veggies. The salad was a tomato (that I can't eat), carrots and lettuce with a nice dressing. The pad Thai though...man, was I surprised! It was similar to Thip Samai minus the egg wrapper. They were generous with the yummy sauce. The noodles were well-coated with the sauce and it was a remarkable deep orange. Unlike the other Thai restaurants in town with pale looking pad Thai.

Thai restaurants have the best service compared to all other Asian restaurants. Always friendly, attentive and eager to please. This place was no exception. However, seating is sparse so you may have to wait if they're busy.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,4,4,uA0pGqve3-72aFJf4CTZjA

Been here a few times already, but today I switched it up from my usual pad se ew and tried their pumpkin curry with beef. I knew right away I made a great choice. Perfect balance of sweet (pumpkin), savory (curry) and spicy. First time ever trying pumpkin curry and it did not disappoint.

I ordered the pad-see-ewe. Just know that they will ask you on a scale from 1-5 (5 as very very spicy) for spiciness. I was feeling a bit naive that afternoon and asked for a 2 instead of a 1. When the dish arrived, I actually enjoyed the noodles - however the aftertaste of burnt tongue really isn't that desirable. I was able to scarf it down, but I couldn't enjoy my lunch as much as I wanted since it was just TOO spicy for me.

My boyfriend had the Crying Tiger, which is just marinated beef steak with some spices. It was good, but a bit too salty for our taste.

The Thai iced tea was refreshing and yummy! As for dessert, we ordered the sticky rice mango.

5794991,2014-12-05,4,QmVF3KJ07PsdroCFwOC_Ow,"""Meh. I've experienced better."" is completely true. I think I learned a lesson to 1) Only order off the lunch menu and 2) Only order take-out. 

I came in for a study break seeking comfort in green curry. I always order the same thing: green curry with chicken. Most Thai restaurants have their own variations (addition/subtraction of vegetables) and most always have the same flavors and textures. I'm definitely not picky, and mostly leave happy with a belly full of green curry. 

Chao Thai's green curry (which isn't on the lunch special, no big deal) is watery as ever and served with only egg plant and bamboo shoots. If it were watery and the flavors were still alive, I'd have been satisfied, but it was the blandest curry I have had... bland curry seems to be a paradox. I don't know if they ran out of green bell pepper, or consciously meant to cut uncooked jalapeño to look like green bell pepper, but it did not fool me for a second!! Ordering a spice of 2/5 I'm not really sure why raw jalapeños made it in the dish. The rice they serve with the curry is laughable especially with how watery it is. 

On top of my sadness from the great reviews from Yelp and my poor curry, the waitress hated my existence. She hated that I was there and that I thanked her, she hated that I paid, and hated that I left. Bad days do occur, so maybe I caught her on one.

Their panang curry is really good! It's definitely worth a try. The pad see ew was okay, but a little salty. The pad Thai was too sour in my opinion. I don't know if it's just a different chef today or just a change to their recipe. It was just not the same. 

The lady at the counter was nice at first. She continued to refill our drinks and everything. I asked for a box.
