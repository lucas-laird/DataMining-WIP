Off the happy hour menu that's your fault for giving me large portions I only want the cheapo menu. I don't know your sizes I trust you to give me what is on the happy hour menu. When the waitress comes back with the new adjusted bill I look at it I politely tell her she did not adjust the price to the happy hour.

When the roll came it was 8 pieces, each piece the size of a nickel. I have never had a philly roll so small before. The salmon inside had a brown tint to it, not the normal bright pink red you would expect. We ordered one more roll, which was meh and an order of 7 piece sashimi. Normally this would fill the two of us up but we're both starving.

The chef flung the large cooking fork at one of the people at the table, hitting him in the chest and arm. After the person handed the fork back to the chef he continued to use it to prepare food for everyone (health code violation for sure). If that wasn't enough, he accidentally put a shrimp on the wrong plate and asked that person to move the shrimp onto the intended persons plate (seriously).  He sprayed four people at the table with hot oil. When he did the egg-cracking trick, he splattered egg on the same guest at our table that he flung the fork at earlier. I have never seen anything like this before, and I have been to a lot of hibachi restaurants. In addition, the service was slow. After speaking to the manager about the experience (having been sprayed on the arm by hot oil) we expected the manager to give a discount or comp a portion of the meal (you know the reasonable thing to do) instead we were told that we were looking for a free hand out. I have never been so offended. He never apologized for the experience. When we told him we did not want to pay full price for the horrible experience, he threatened to call the cops. His accusation is nonsense and his professionalism is non-existent. I will never eat here again and I highly discourage others from visiting this establishment.",6jbyvRxagOTyIBgudWKDzA,2,1,1,v96gfAJ7HQVIzTQWy8triQ

Then our server jess a hispanic girl that was wearing short shorts with fishnets ( I wondered if this was a club at the strip) Was so lazy and irritated while taking our drink order, that  took 25 mins to get to us. Then we got our soup that tasted like salty water, and salad that has dirt on it, Like it literally  had some mud on the lettuce. Then the chef came in with all smiley faces after he kept us waiting for 1 hour 45 mins acted like a retard trying so hard to be funny and just being so annoyingly loud it was distracting more than entertaining for our family. He was taking to us like we're 9 years old kids, like dude have some self respect I understand  you have to be entertaining but what you are doing to us is just  embarrassing. Why can't you just talk to us like a normal person and not act like a retard. He talked to us parents like we were special I felt like he was a Sesame Street character for a buffoon. The food was tasteless it just tasted like garlic I wonder where this guy got his culinary degree from? Yeah I get that you put garlic butter on everything but at least let my shrimp taste different from my rice and steak and veggies. Last thing I was gonna talk to was the manager but it was was impossible because all he cared about was talking and flirting with the servers. Thats why we can't get a refill with our drinks. We can't even ask for a fork. And this guy had a gun on his waist. I understand this is a free country but was this really necessary? Like is this a bad place to be that you have to carry a gun??

We decided to try it. We arrived on June 26th at 11:30 am. We were the first diners. We were seated quickly, and our waitress was great. I ordered the lunch beunto box. It was delicious. We also ordered the ""Willie Roll"" which Willie Diegel created on the show. It was very good. Another male employee checked on our table several times and refilled our drinks. I did not like how the menu was on a clipboard in plastic sleeves, and neither did Willie Diegel. We were talking about how good the food was but was concerned that when we left an hour later, we were still the only customers. As we were leaving, we noticed Osakas parking lot only had one car in it, and it was ours. The restaurant next door's parking lot was packed with cars. Overall, our experience was great but was very concerned that no one else was there.

Three of us were seated where there was only room for two people.  It took a long time before we were even asked what we wanted to drink.  The Groupon appears to be a good deal but you really can't get the full value.

378324,2009-12-06,0,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"Moving to this area recently, I decided to try Osaka on Lake Mead last Friday. I noticed an advertised happy hour special, so I thought it would be a good deal to take my two sons for an early  sushi dinner. I was very wrong. My family and I will not return to this business due to the following:
 
1) The short haired brunnette waitress/server who seated us was inattentive and somewhat surely in her demeanor. In fact durin our experience another party was seated at the sushi bar and after some dialogue (could not hear it) and some negative body language she was exihibiting, the party of three left abruptly.
2) The short haired brunette server/waitress was not concerned with our drinks or refills and we went long periods waiting for refills or even for her to ask if we needed anything.
3)The short haired waitress/server did not at any point offer any incentives nor suggestions for special food prices or kitchen specialties. She never asked us if we wanted anything from the kitchen, she never asked us if we were satisfied or needed anything else. 
4) We waited at least 15 minutes total after our places were cleared of used dishes, to recieve our check, and then have the check serviced and change returned...
5) for three people, one order of sake and two ice teas, two colas and sushi (of any kind)  the bill was $120!!! -- during a ""happy hour"" and being the only people during this time @3:30pm this is a ridiculous price. No one offered to give us a deal, encourage a special or make recoomendations for a better pricing for our visit. 
6) The two sushi chefs were not busy, but were also less than attentive and we frequently had to call him (only one was paying attention or greeted us) over to continue ordering rolls.
7) The 8-10 dollar rolls contained only four pieces compared to everywhere else (in the valley) that have eight piece rolls. The presentation of the ""specialty rolls"" was plain and unremarkable. The fish was of adequate freshness and taste, but that was undershadowed by the overall experience.
 
 
As you can see I numbered the complaints and I consider this order of importance as the server/waitress was the first and most disappointing impression upon your establishment. Frankly, for a business to steeped in the  upity ""Summerlin"" area of Las Vegas, I am saddened to report I get better service, better prices and no less important, a better quality food product in North Las Vegas establishments.",GgLoj8aMHHeNorVTniXJ3g,0,0,1,L9UaQEDH8qUWOzBu0_R-oA

The first time we went there, we were on a business dinner with people who, as we found out later, were partially owners. We were treated like kings. Everything perfect.
 
The second time, we were by ourselves. The service was noticeably less attractive and the food was not the same as the first time. We thought: ""Ok, maybe this is an off day."" 

The third experience was absolutely horrible. The service was slow, the food quality and presentation was, to say it politely, yucky! The desert was that thing with ice cream in the middle and supposedly ""freshly"" made crisp layer outside. Holly crap! that supposedly freshly made crisp aroud the ice cream was so leathery I could make a genuine Chanel bag out of it. I called the waitress over and asked to get a fresh one. She said that was fresh. I offered her to have a bit and after tasting if she told me it was fresh, I would accept it. She declined. I asked her to send it back and take it off our order as that dessert was unacceptable. She did take it back. She did not bring us a freshly made one but she did charge us $17 for it. I noticed that on the bill and asked her to take it off. She said she wouldn't. I was so tempted to give her $0 tips, but I know better. It is not up to the waitress, especially in Vegas. It is the owners and the management of the place. So, i did give her an acceptable tip and decided that was it. No more Osaka for us. There are plenty of awesome places in Vegas to have Sushi.

We have observed before ""the Groupon effect"" here with smaller portions and light drink pours, but this night was just ridiculous.  Many others have commented on the ludicrous $17 upcharge for anything other than their basics up to $32 (in effect wiping out your Groupon savings and charging you even more than had you not purchased a Groupon).  Obviously, their goal is to ""pin you in"" to their cheaper menu items (which are not ""cheap"" at all...$32 for chicken/shrimp combo?).  What really made us swear off this place for good was that the entree portion of my meal was the smallest I have received at any restaurant.  Ever... Literally five small pieces of shrimp and about 7 small pieces of chicken (maybe 1/4 of a breast if that).  The ""appetizer"" that each person got was another 2 tiny pieces of shrimp....what a joke!  At least our chef worked hard to entertain our 2 year old boy, otherwise I would have rated this place one star.  Total rip off even with the Groupon.  We go to Hoikkado in Summerlin, where their regular prices are about the same as this place once you apply the Groupon, but the portions, service and atmosphere are far superior.  These guys have learned how to work the Groupon system to still make a lot of money, so don't go thinking you are getting a deal.  You will be shortchanged and/or upcharged for a decent experience.

552130,2017-07-25,2,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"Most awkward dining experience ever. My mother and I came to eat on a Monday night. There is a large party nearby but several empty tables so it is not super busy. I ordered a bento box, and mom ordered a roll of sushi. My bento box comes, and mom's sushi does not. The waiter comes by and apologizes a couple of times saying that they had a whole bunch of sushi orders come in at once. So I'm eating mine, because I don't want my food to go cold. I am a notoriously slow eater. I'm trying to eat even slower because essentially my mom is watching me eat. However, I am able to finish my WHOLE meal and my mom has not been served. She's a bit steamed and asks the waiter, is there something that is available ""now""? He says he can get her a bento box like I had. She says ok. He comes back a moment later to ask if she wanted to cancel the sushi roll. Well duh that is the implication if you ask if you can order something else instead. Five minutes later, the manager comes out with the sushi roll. My now upset mom informs her that this was cancelled. The manager gets pushy saying ""can't you take it to go? I can't resell this."" At that point we cancel the other box, ask for the bill, pay it and leave. As I'm paying the bill the server for the only time asks if we want a refill on the drinks. Um no, thanks.

This could have been handled so much better. If they were short handed they could have said that you could only order sushi from the sushi bar so that the dine in people would only order from the kitchen. They could have offered her a miso soup or fried rice so she would have something to do while waiting instead of watching me eat. They could have said at the beginning, look, sushi will take 45 minutes and mom would have ordered from the kitchen.
I am glad they did not offer a discount for next time because there will not ever be a next time.",5C4l2oHzdQSPXmKgz_9_MQ,7,0,1,X5CLc8BTvP83nq_2uwxLuQ

We  order appetizer, drinks and we share our entree.  The food and the service are good but as we received our check, I showed my $10.00 of coupon from my phone .
The waitress said,"" oh let me ask my manager first"". She goes and talks to her manager and comes back and tell us that since we have our entree split , they are going to charge us $10.00 . so there is no discount , is even . 
I can't believe they would do that. First they ask a coupon, then they take it back , as no one ever said about splitting charge?

745864,2012-05-14,0,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"Wow! I should have listened to the other Yelper's and went to a different Osakas.

I purchased a Yelp Osaka deal that stated that I get $15 worth of food for $25. So my family and I went to Osakas on Mother's Day. On the door there was a list of coupons that they did not take , Yelp was not on the list. I figured it wasn't because I thought Yelp had a special contract with the businesses they do deals with. No where on their coupon does it say "" Will not be honored on holidays"". So, we asked our waitress and she said ""no, they do not accept any coupons on holidays"".

We figured that since we were there , we might as well eat. So I ordered a combo box of beef and chicken and TNA rolls. When we received our meal , I noticed it was only chicken. I told the waitress that I ordered the box, she insisted that I didn't. I asked her if she can just make it the combo by bringing me the tempura that goes along with it, she said that she couldn't. So my husband and I continued to eat our small overpriced meal.

Later, the waitress returned and told us how AMAZING their watermelon martini was, so I decided to ordered it. It was lackluster and flavorless. The watermelon that they used must have been unripe. She asked me how it was and I told her it was disgusting. She replied ""Oh, our normal bartender didn't make this one, he just walked in. Everyone makes them different."" She then paused. I expected her to offer me another drink, instead she just continued to look at me with a blank look on her face.

Finally, after eating my meal, and drinking my terrible drink, we received our sushi. I ordered the sushi as an appetizer, but I received it after I was completely done with my meal. She kept on telling me that it would be coming out shortly. By the time that we received it, I didn't even want it. The TNA sushi was alright. The tuna kind of lacked flavor.

Lastly, she came with the check. I was hoping that we would have received something comped, at least the drink because she had herself admitted that there was a reason that it wasn't as good. We were greeted by a bill with EVERYTHING on it. The waitress brought the credit card machine to the desk. Then, they ask you to punch the tip in the machine as they are staring at you. AK WARD.

This experience was terrible. I would never recommend it to a free. 

P.S. I already asked Yelp for a refund for my unused coupon.",mD4vh03Ibawll5J-I_l0DA,5,1,1,vQsNp2ADd8OxjJl4BmrxQw

761723,2015-04-14,0,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"No star! ... First impression always sticks! This place smelled like sewer from parking lot. My wife & I and our 15 month old went to this place knowing it's a totally different menu from the one on Sahara. Lady (looks japanese, maybe the owner or whatever) greeted us and ask if we are bar dining or regular dining. We said regular for 2.5 cuzz of our baby. The place looks like a ghost town with couple on the sushi bar. On the other side is a total mess, only couple of tables almost done eating and the rest of the tables were dirty! Now, I'm a server at Aria and if I walked into a place disarray with one server (young asian dude) running around crazy and it wasn't even busy, there is definitely something wrong. But I have it the benefit of the doubt that lunch rush just probably hit this place. Ok, so the lady decided to sit us in a booth with little room for the high chair at the end of our booth (it's better to sit a family with a baby on a table, if space is limited between tables). The tables in this restaurant are close to each other. Mind you she could've cleaned up a table next to the wall or something so our high chair is not obstructing the pathway!! Ok ... Moving on, the table is covered with a dark color cloth and on top is placed a white paper like its an up scale restaurant. We had to move the paper a little far from the reach of our baby because he grabs everything in front of him and a paper cut will just not be good. Ok .. Underneath this (epic-fail-to-look-upscale) paper is a dirty-ass table with crumbs and stains that looked like she just place a new paper so she could sit us (her name might be Joy, she look like a joy). A dirty place is not how to impress your patrons! I get it, this place is located at Summerlin (woop tidoo), business men and the likes come here and hang out so the place is trying to cater to that. So we were greeted and asked for the drink and water was delivered. The menu did not wow us! My wife loves a certain roll on the Sahara location (which we go to all the freaking time, but they were filming something there so it was closed to the public today, and the brother is the owner) and also I love my treasure island roll (they did not have it). So we decided to just leave and go to SOHO at Jones & Warm Springs (pretty nice sushi joint but we still love Osaka on Sahara). All in all for you peeps that wanna try this place out .. Please consider this a restaurant (OSAKA ON SAHARA) that serves quality food, great service and clean baby friendly environment WILL NEVER EVER HAVE GROUPON or some type of promotion, you know why because they are that damn good and people know it!!! And people pay!!! This joint however does Groupon crap and guess what that 3 star on their review is for a reason compare to the the Sahara location with 4 star .. One star is a big difference! So drive yourself that extra 15 minutes and go to Sahara because it's all worth your time, money and you know that it's a clean environment! Dirty environment equals food poisoning. Disarray restaurant equals promotion to get people to come. My review on this equals poor management/ownership (the sister owns this Summerlin location) Peace!",9ET_RUNztevq4_OLAX80Gg,1,0,1,2URLMMcmy10nCXgXQYReow

Along with that I got an order nigiri salmon roe, not sure if they soak their roe in marinade 1st but personally I don't think so because I enjoyed it, usually when salmon roe has been marinated it's been over done and I could really taste the actual roe not a bunch of other flavors that I wasn't looking forward to....anyhow now the kicker and I mean kicker...because wait til you hear how excited I was leaving lol...
So...I told the Sushi Chef that I really wanted to try something different and unique to Osaka, he then suggested the S.O.S roll(don't panic it's on menu)all I can say is OMG! HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS COMING! It's devilishly delicious with a sautéed medium-sized shrimp for every bite, it's spicy, citrusy, savory... it's a freak'n flavor bomb, I loved it!
Anyways, the Chef sat down a few seats besides me while I finished eating and I told him that I couldn't find anything wrong with it and I usually find something wrong especially if there's mayo on my SD sushi, but I was speachless! When I got up to leave I was so excited as I was walking out I ran right into the glass doors, I kicked the doors with my knee, LMBO...My knee still hurts lol! I don't even care!!!
Go to Osaka and give them a shot, so far I'm very impressed and I can't wait to go back, Oh, and if you complain about the prices get over it because you must be one of those people who are use to eating at  $20 #AllUCANEATS and if that's the case it's definitely time for a change!",WIaVk95dGVH7Sm_Hxun15Q,0,0,5,fDCbQa-iU8oHRh2xQMPMxQ

They also automatically include an 18% gratuity in the bill which normally would have been fine. But the waitress we had was more interested in hanging out with her boyfriend at the front sushi bar instead of servicing her customers. The chef also didn't seem to be very engaged as there was none of the usual flair you get at a hibachi place. All that being said I am disappointed that I spent money on this.

So when I say that this was literally the worst Japanese food I've ever had, I really mean it. Everything, from it's run down 90s era greasy booths, to it's foul bathrooms speaks of it's fading mediocrity that makes a $20 AYCE sushi joint look like a Nobu Omakase feast in comparison.

We showed up at 630 on a Sunday evening, looking for something quick and easy for my wife and the two kids. As a general safety rule, I don't get sashimi at place that doesn't look 100 percent authentic and serious about sushi. This was more of a teriyaki and California roll type place.

I got the salmon teriyaki, my wife got the spider roll (because deep frying is a good sterilizer), my daughter got the chicken udon and my son got the caterpillar roll.

Somehow, this took 45 minutes to prepare what is basically Japanese fast food. The place was only half full, with a majority of patrons enjoying the teppanyaki (Benihana style) dinner.

Note: If anyone from the restaurant ever reads this, please stop calling that type of dinner Hibachi, which refers to a open grate grill. Obviously no Japanese person has ever stepped foot in your restaurant, so I suspect no one knows or cares.

Anyhow, the Spider Roll was amazingly dry to the point of the rice being crunchy. Perhaps the vinegar ran out at the restaurant. My wife called it, ""The worst roll she's ever had.""

Nothing bad to say about the caterpillar roll. Hard to mess up on a California roll with avocado. My 7 year old loved it.

My salmon was predictably dry and soaked with a pool of syrup. They didn't include tempora sauce with the tempora, but they did give me extra teriyaki syrup.

Finally, the udon was nondescript. Other than the lack of adequate noodles in the liter sized cauldron it came it, it was edible.

Needless to say we will never be back. It's honestly amazing that this place still exists. Perhaps the 2.5 star rating and the fact that there were zero Asians in the restaurant except the Filipino bus boy should have tipped me off.

I've been to a few teppanyaki restaurants in Vegas and in other cities across the nation, but this was the first time I tried the Osaka in Summerlin. They had a Groupon going, so I bought the deal and hit the grill with my husband. Part of the fun of hibachi dining is getting to meet your neighbors, and our new biker buddy Ed and his family certainly made our experience more interesting! Ed's group had the Groupon, too, so it looks like that deal was a big draw.
 
My husband had the ribeye, and I had the filet. As per most teppanyaki restaurants, the meals were served with miso soup, a salad, grilled vegetables, and rice (we both ordered it fried). The chef made quite a show slicing and dicing, and while some diners might have been offended by a few of our guy's risqué jokes, they fit right in with us (and Ed!).
 
The food was on par with other teppanyaki we've had, although the chef was a little heavy handed with the garlic. My husband and I each had a Kirin draft (which was part of the Groupon deal), and we also split a large Sapporo. And it seems like they have a pretty extensive sake menu, if that's your thing.
 
You know the place is good when you see local celebrities eating there, as was the case here. Frankie Moreno and his crew were at the next table, and in an ""only in Vegas moment,"" Ed's daughter and son-in-law had just happened to have seen Moreno's show at the Smith Center. When they shared that news with the singer, he sent over a bottle of champagne and happily posed for pictures.
 
Full and happy, we rolled out of the restaurant. Our garlic breath may have lingered a little longer than we wanted, but so will our memories of a fun night with Ed and company. If you try Osaka (and I suggest you do), hopefully your seatmates will be just as colorful and your chef will be a little lighter on the garlic!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,H9MKzi0OaMqsemCqVg14aw

As for the food. It was okay. The ice tea was very interesting in a great way. It almost had a nutty creamy flavor to it but it was tea. The miso soup was good. It was perfect temp for me because I don't like  food too hot but for anyone who expects hot soup, you will be disappointed.

For our entree we had the seafood medley and surf & turf. The menu says it comes with white rice and you can order a side for $4 however we all chose fried rice and the addition to the bill was $3.50.  You would think you were saving a buck until you continue to read down the bill and discover they are charging you $17 as an up-charge as labeled. This was very interesting because when we walked through the door of the restaurant they asked us if we had any certificates. When we said yes we had a Groupon, it was taken immediately.

Upon seating us we were told the Groupon was good for an entree up to $32. We have used many Groupon's  before where they have just taken the difference between what you order and how much they a lot for a meal. In our case both meals would have been $5 each. When we questioned and asked to speak to a manager, there was no one there so the server had to call. She came back and offered us $10 per person for the up charge. When I said no I wasn't going to pay that as it was never written anywhere or stated to us there would be an up charge she let me know her manager said she would have to call the police. I asked her to please do so and with that she went in the back to ""call her manager"" and came back out with a bill for the correct amount.

It's a shame that this type of funky business has to go on. Had it not been for the intentional overcharge, I would have given the food a three star rating. It was good, not great, not bad but man what a sad experience.",gWDEHj_t5UL1jMYO-Rn35w,11,0,1,0BudWjer_CiQ_6LHiK_iZw

The steaks, chicken, shrimp, and scallops I had during the main course were all very well seasoned and expertly cooked, but that can't overcome a bad cut of meat or a flavorless shrimp. I had to make liberal use of the two sauces they provide and that's a shame. Good meats and seafood, when well made, should be able to stand completely on their own. 

The fried rice was awesome. Probably because it's basically impossible to mess up the ingredients. Speaking of rice, the rice in the sushi was also excellent. So I guess there's that.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,3,2,2,YHtVyxSIPxtASzESt2m84w

My sushi was covered in lemon juice and crap because it wasn't fresh. The sushi chef was not amiable whatsoever.

The japanese lasagna here is nothing compared to the stuff they make at the location on Eastern.

I worked in the Summerhill Plaza at one point in time and if they were decent, I would've spent so much money here on lunch/dinner. That's too bad. I hardly ever have sushi this depressing.

My sushi benchmarks are Yellow Tail which was a little on the mild side for me but quite fresh and firm with a bit of buttery-feel in the mouth. The Salmon was superb with the nice fatty richness I look for.

All that being said, my 3-star rating was based on 2 things: The portions here are probably the smallest suhi servings on the planet. The Ngiri slices were about 2/3 of what I would expect with the cut rolls being the size of a generic hot-dog (about 1"" diameter). I've never seen such small portions in the 50 or so sushi establishments I've been to. The other thing was the service. I got take-out and was told :20 minutes. It was more like :40 on a Saturday night. If it's to be :40, fine. I just need my expectation set.  I spent $50 (includes a 10% take-out tip) on 3 Ngiri and 3 cut rolls and was just satisfied ... with no leftovers. That's a three $$$ .. Yelp has them at two $$.

As an aside, the atmosphere was very noisy with little sound-supressing materials or design in the ceiling or walls. Also, the web site is misleading ... it's only for the Sahara location. The on-line menu does not apply to the Lake Mead locaiton ... I had 6 items picked out from the site and when I arrived with my list, they didn't carry 4 of them (Toro, Ebi, Aji and Las Vegas roll).",fwStqPnr2ks06nwFbZv0zw,2,0,3,qab6YrQZhVGk4poJzPqkvA

I food took FOREVER to come OMG and we were getting so hungry. I ordered a California tempura roll, my grandma ordered their 007 roll w/ 2 pieces of nigiri w/ tuna & for my son a chicken teriyaki bento box. I was disappointed w/ my roll, most place I go it's pretty big and filling. The roll is always nicely breaded with the Tempura, at this place the tempura on the roll was really skimpy it basically looked just like a regular CA roll. The taste of it wasn't bad, it was decent but was not what I was expecting sadly :-(.and it only came w/ about 5 pieces, normally it's 8 :-(. My son and my grandma shared her sushi her roll looked pretty good and she said it was good but kind of small pieces. Her nigiri looked way smaller and skimpy as well to what we are used to :-(. My sons bento box was pretty good, we all nibbled on it, the chicken teriyaki was just ok, I've had better but the tempura was pretty good and I always love the salad with the Asian ginger dressing!!! We were all still hungry so I ordered just another CA roll and some Gyoza. The Gyoza was actually really good. Overall the taste of the food was not horrible but I've definitely been to better sushi places. They did let my son pick out a piece of candy from their little candy treasure chest which was sweet of them. I probably wouldn't go back since I wasn't wowed this time. Maybe my expectations were too high because I heard it was really good from some friends. :-(. But I have a couple more certificates to use for this place. Next time I'm going to try the hibachi, I'm thinking that's probably the way to go because I still left their feeling a little hungry :-(. I'll have to see what happens the next time.

I almost forgot to mention that at one point they said they had ran out of green tea for the night :-(, but towards the end they had some more so have us a couple more glasses. And I was not a fan of the menus. I didn't really get it at 1st, it's just a big clipboard with printed out papers, in the paper protectors, attached to it.

The chef came out (Jorge), introduced himself, confirmed everyone's orders, and proceeded to cook the food with the usual hibachi flair. The portions are ridiculously small, and cooked and served ridiculously quickly, and for what you get the place is ridiculously expensive. I like the word ""ridiculously"" tonight for some reason. Anyhow, we were there for approximately 35 minutes. That's how fast the food is served, and how small the portions are (you get through your small amount of food in a matter of minutes).

Way too much for a very rushed meal, which is better described as an appetizer. The one positive was that the little bit of meat (I got the filet mignon... or more actually a filet mignon shaving for $29) was very tasty... that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1.

Anyways.... We ordered Yellowtail sashimi  and baked green mussels as an appetizer. Both were delicious and fresh. Id prefer cilantro on my yellowtail as well as the jalapeño... But let's not be too picky. I'd also prefer a plate without a huge chip in it. It's about presentation as well as taste. 

We sat at the teppanyaki table and J.R was our chef. I mentioned that I like my steaks medium, but I usually order my filet mignon medium rare due to it never being cooked right. He assured me he would make it right... Even gave me a taster, and behold... It was amazing.

A Latino chef doing hibachi. Called me Bro and openly complained how tired he was and how he couldn't wait to leave. 

Asked four times if I wanted rice. Said no all four times. Still given rice. 

Bathroom was a wreck. Needs repairs but also needs the vulgarity etched into the mens stall i. E.  Ethnic slurs removed, Pronto. Keep it classy, Osaka. 

Woman at the door obviously could not be bothered. Hated her job. Could not smile. 

They charged our group of five for the entire table at hibachi. Didn't track of two different families, just slapped the whole bill at us so gratuity would be forced on us. 

Water and tea needed to be refilled often, just sat there for five to ten minutes. 

The hibachi chef's oil squirt bottle was a naked kid looking like he was urinating all over the table.

2009921,2017-06-10,5,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"Our experience at Osaka was mixed, but with the various hibachi/teppanyaki style restaurants in the area, I don't foresee us rushing back as there wasn't really anything that set Osaka apart from their competitors. As a lot of other reviews point out, they are on the pricier side and service leaves a lot to be desired.

We (as a party of 2) had a 6:30 reservation, arrived on time, and were told we would be seated shortly with a larger party when the rest of their group arrived. No big deal, I get that it is ideal/preferable to fill up a hibachi table rather than spread your guests out- there are only so many chefs. So we waited..for about 20 minutes and their whole party was not there yet so they offered to seat us and we agreed as we were ready to get going with our dinner. 

We were sat there for 5 minutes or so and then the rest of the original party we were supposed to sit with finally showed up; we were then shuffled over to that table. 

From this point on, the night was more or less back on track. Food was great and our chef, Jorge, was skilled and personable. However, it is still disappointing that after having us wait an additional 30+ minutes past our reservation to even get a glass of water there wasn't really any sincere or meaningful recognition of the inconvenience from staff or management. 

The restaurant itself needs some attention as well. While I sat at the bar for 20 minutes, it gave me plenty of time to look over the state and cleanliness of the restaurant. The menus are tattered, dirty, and overly worn or damaged. When I'm ordering roughly $45 worth of food and drinks per person, I expect a little pride in the menu at the very least. The space is decorated with interesting light fixtures that function almost as an art piece in and of themselves, however numerous lights were out on almost every fixture. The tiled host stand had what I can only describe as a ""band"" of dirt and gunk building up around the base where it meets the floor. 

Whenever the front of the house needs attention, it's not a good indicator of how things are handled in the back of the house.",PVB0ggrspa1wWUECI7BN6w,8,2,2,gUOEffbzcjEWnk-mta4wrw

Good: -The food is good, the prices are in line with what you would expect of this type of restaurant (a fair amount of people use groupon to cut the cost) the service is good. Portion sizes were good. The chef's did put on a good show.

Now the bad. For the prices you pay this restaurant definitely need a facelift. The outside makes it look really nice but the problems appear when you walk through the door (only one of which was working at the time of our visit) , the walls are dirty and could use a repaint, floors are dirty, the fume hoods above each of the tables could use a good cleaning (I could see a lot of rust just looking up) and the menus need to be replaced. The menues also need to be replaced. Ours were ripped in half and all of the menues at our table were in pretty bad shape and are also laminated and dirty. They look like menus you would get at a cheap restaurant, not one where you are spending on average 30 bucks or more for an entree, our bill was about $92.00 with tax, tip and drinks. We also had to ask the server to clear the dirty plates on the table, there is not a lot of room on those tables so you would think that would be a priority.

 My overall view of this place is mixed.  I gave it three starts( actually it should be 2.5 but there is no rating for that)  because they could do better-much better if they repaint, do some cleaning and replace the cheesy menus. This is definitely not the place for a romantic dinner . It is a good place to take the family and if you have kids. Don't go if there are less than 4  because it is community seating.  As I said we went for my Wife's Birthday and were seated at a table with 4 adults, 2 kids and a breast-feeding infant. The people at our table were friendly but had I knew we would be seated like this I would have gone somewhere else for this occasion.

I walked in here after looking at the paper menu and the prices on that menu, attracted me to the place the happy hour items and prices were very good. It was happy hour, when I walked in and sat down they gave me a plastic menu and I saw that most of the rolls that were on the paper menu were gone and everything else was either 2$ more or 3$ more then what it said on the paper menu.  I showed them the paper menu to compare it to the plastic and they said ""yeah we haven't had time to change it"". Um then why don't you just not give out the paper menus anymore until you change it?  I was attracted to the place after looking at the menu but then you guys switch me to a different menu? Not cool!  I complained to them and they honored the paper menu price rather then me paying the 3$ more but wouldn't make me the roll I wanted that was on the other menu.

I was also charged an 18% services for a table of two like others. I don't mind tipping on the full original total but 15% not 18%.  The reason I really hated this experience was that the Sushi Groupon deal which we ordered (not Hibachi) was the worst Sushi I've ever seen. The plate was extremely small.  They were like miniature playtoy Sushi.  And they were misshapen like a child formed them.  Normally Sushi chefs take pride in the form.,aEqmfr_LItqSHaKiAGXgSw,2,0,1,2nqYQZQy_KXhhYrn7XK-tQ

Upon entering, the hostess/maybe the manager seemed very frantic and confused. We had reservations at 7p....party of 4 and she just looks like a deer in headlights. Took her awhile to get us seated even though the restaurant had plenty of seats available.

We got a Groupon for this place so we ordered two entrees of the Osaka Medley from the hibachi section of the menu. Each entree comes with miso soup, salad (delicious ginger dressing) and steamed rice. Fried rice costs extra.

Everything was cooked to our liking and our cook was entertaining, to say the least. However, they salt the shit outta their meats and fried rice. I've never felt so bloated in my entire life. I seriously must of retained so much water weight that night, I felt like a ripped pumpkin getting ready to pop!!!! Horrible feeling!!!!! =(

Having been to the Sahara location for sushi on several occasions, I saw a Groupon for the Summerlin location and figured ""why not?"" Definitely one of the lower end hibachi experiences I've had, and trust me that I've had my share. I can say that I have no complaints about the service and that was the only saving grace from this being a 1 star review.

But the rest of the experience...meh. Walking into the restaurant, we were welcomed by Pandora ads playing throughout the restaurant speakers. I love Pandora, but they couldn't spare $5 a month for an ad-free subscription? Although we came for the food and not the music, this is tacky.

We were seated fairly promptly at our own grill and couldn't help but notice food and used chop sticks on the floor at the adjacent tables. At this point, I'm willing to forgive the appearance of the floor hoping the food makes up for it so I brush it off. At our waitresses suggestion, we both ordered martinis that disappointed. For $11 a drink, I expect to be able to taste vodka in a martini.

Soup and salad come out shortly after the drinks. The miso soup was fine. The salad was just lettuce with watery dressing and super thin carrot slices on it. No tomatoes or cucumbers like you might find elsewhere. Although maybe a minor thing to complain about, the lettuce seemed a little warm like it was just sitting out. All I know is it definitely didn't come out of a working refrigerator any time recently.

Ok, so our chef comes out. Personable guy, does all the usual tricks, nothing out of the ordinary. I had chicken and shrimp, and she ordered scallops. The fried rice  and veggies were average, no complaints. The meat portions were small. You know the portions were small because both of us finished our meals and that's not usually the case at places like this. I got a tiny chicken breast and 7 shrimp. Her scallops were small for sea scallops and probably closer to bay scallops in size...for comparison's sake, they were maybe half the size of what you'd expect from Benihana and I'm being generous. The worst part? They tasted way fishy, so they were obviously not fresh. I considered drafting this review and waiting to see how we felt in the morning, but thought I'd post it now hoping that just in case we die that someone sees this Yelp review so they know who to sue for our wrongful deaths.

When the check came, I was blown away that this was a $98 dinner. Maybe they need to look out the window and realize this restaurant is not on the strip. At my regular hibachi place in LA, I'd get filet mignon and lobster for the same price as chicken and shrimp here.

However... Once our Chef came out, the entire evening & dinner was great!! They placed a Happy Birthday sign in front of my son and he got special treatment all night. The Chef let him try to flip the egg, engaged him in conversation the entire dinner and they even came out singing with big happy birthday signs and ice cream. Which was an awesome surprise for all of us. We weren't expecting that. 
Our orders consisted of chicken, filet mignon, New York strip and lobster. We also ordered edamame and spider rolls as appetizers. Everything was really good and we didn't leave too much on the plate when we left. 
Just as everyone's commented, if you order over the $32, the additional charge is $10 or $17, depending on what you order. But the hostess explained all of that to me before we even sat down. 
Everyone was very friendly and the dinner ran smoothly, once the hibachi experience actually began.

The rolls were very tasty and varied. The nigiri was just average. The cuts ranged in my order from the unagi being very tiny to an adequate sized hamachi. Flavors and freshness were not bad, but also nothing to get excited about. The nigiri on their late night menu is cheap, starting at $2.50. The hamachi nigiri came automatically with jalapeno on it which is not a traditional preperation and not mentioned on the menu. Don't get me wrong, I like jalapeno but at least give me a choice in the matter.

This particular location is on the other side of town from where I live and I actually think the east side Osaka is much better quality the few times I have been there.

The real issue is the groupon situation was less then great. It says you can get any entree up to $32. The problem comes when the item you want is say $35 they don't charge you the extra $3 they want to charge an extra $10 or up to $17. What was the point of the groupon?

And if u choose an entree that's more than $32, u will need to pay up charge of $17. Paying extra $17 is just paying the whole price. I didn't really save money. The whole groupon is a scam. It's just to make people go in to their restaurant. I didn't read the reviews about the restaurant till it's too late to cancel my groupon. I figured, I guess I got no choice but to check it out. When Jess gave us our check, she added 18 % auto grat. We asked her why since it's only 4 of us. The menu said, auto grat for 6 or more people. She said that it's because of the groupon. So I read back again the groupon & didn't say anything about auto grat. It did say, tip generously!!! 

I tipped the cook (George) since he was great. He is very friendly and great at his job. Food is so so. Sauce could have been better.

We then we're served the soup and salad but had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes before our chef Jimmy came to start the hibachi. Jimmy was worth the wait.

My friends and I decided we wanted to do some hibachi tonight, thought of Osaka, checked their menu online and it said Sundays had ""happy hour"" hibachi all day for $15, so how could you pass that up...right? 

We arrive at Osaka, stand in the entry for, no lie, TEN minutes before even being acknowledged. In the meantime the bartender goes back and forth between the bar and dining room and doesn't say a single thing to us, not a ""someone will be right with you"" or even a ""hi.""

So we FINALLY get seated, then sit at our table for 15-20 minutes before even being acknowledged (again) or getting any drinks, not even a water. At this point we were contemplating leaving. 

So our server finally comes and takes our order and my friend and I asked if we could do half steak half shrimp and she said she would ask the chef...she never asked him or came back to us with an answer, we just got a surprise when he started cooking. Once dinner was done, an hour and a half later, it was so bland and not tasty. You'd think after waiting so long it would be the best thing ever, but no. 

So we finally get our check, and they charged us $18 for the hibachi dinner, then an additional $3.50 for the fried rice which apparently isn't included in the dinner. They never informed us of this so that was another lovely surprise we had at the end of our horrible experience. 

Seriously, don't go here. There are so many other sushi/hibachi places that have good food, good service, no hidden fees and a nice environment. If I could give this review negative stars, I would.

Here is the negative so strong that I will never again go there. As my reviews sometimes state, I'm a big fan of Groupon. I try many, many new places because of it and I eat out far more than the average person. But anyway, I went to take the kids (14, 20, and 21 year old friend) for their amazing sushi platters and since we're all really big sushi fans, I was happy to show them this place. I let the server know I had a Groupon and wanted to order the sushi platter, she informed me that they no longer accepted those for the platters. I showed her the details they themselves had posted and she brought the owner. I hear she is the daughter of the owner of the original Osaka. I explained what the situation is and she said she will not honor it because she has been meaning to change that on the Groupon page. Normally they'll just honor it, admit their mistake, then move on. She became really argumentative to the point of being offensive. Had it not escalated to that, I would have just not used the Groupon and that would have been the end. As a side note, it now states not valid on platters. Sadly, I have heard of other horror stories on the reviews with Groupon use, mostly on the tepanyaki side. I do not understand why these businesses enter into a partnership with groupon to get new business then proceed to treat those using them badly. It's not even that much of a discount. I paid $26 for $40 worth of food and the platter is $90, not counting drinks and appetizers. Like I said, I eat out a lot so $14 here and there really adds up but I am by no means getting a free meal. Plus, I always tip on the full amount. Again, the food was really good, the servers were good, but the management could really use a lesson on customer service.",GbqFbom5aUmteR7ezXAblQ,0,0,1,US5O_iFYIsT1lAeRtIjBVg

As a local for 14 years, I've been to many japanese restaurants. We usually stick to the spring mountain area when we eat Asian. Perhaps this was my mistake.
My husband and I came for dinner on a sat night. We ordered his favortie, the spicy tuna roll. It wasn't spicy at all. It tasted like just a tuna roll with one drop of tabasco.
We both ordered the dinner bento box. The beef was cooked nicely, but we both agreed that the 'teriyaki' sauce was very muted, almost watered down. I think a teriyaki tv dinner would have had more flavor. The only reason why I gave 2 stars was because the tempura was alright. The dipping sauce for the tempura had absolutely no flavor, either. Our waiter was very attentive when it came to refilling our drinks.
Maybe the teppanyaki is better, it has to be, otherwise how would they still be in business? I would advise against ordering the regular dinner menu.

Thanks the great ambiance, loud music and the free smells from the teppanyaki grils. But the food wasn't what I expected. More like something I would get from a no name fast food strip mall. I'll stay with chinatown. Nice try Osaka.",IpO_gn969eK6wbf8xsKGZQ,1,0,2,vDP8QESf-O30UhSykL3D1Q

Our guy had zero enthusiasm, seemed bored beyond belief, cracked egg shells when he attempted the egg trick, all the while never able to crack a smile. Never spoke to any of the guests at the table. Spilled stuff, knocked the onion volcano over.. and so on. None of that matters when the personality is there though and some enthusiasm. But this guy was miserable and the experience became miserable. This group dinner of silence from hell was the worst $100 plus I ever spent on a meal for two. Quality of food was so so.

We ordered our food and the hibachi chef came out, and he barely knew what he was doing. We were the only people in this part of the restaurant so I know it wasn't because they were busy.

We ordered the 007 roll. It was a tempura roll with spicy tuna on top. There was barely any tuna on top and it legitimately tasted like it was stirred in ketchup. It was horrible.

To start off our night, we had a reservation at 6 pm. Apparently they know how to take a reservation, but have no idea how to honor them. At 6:45, we asked the hostess what was taking so long, instead of being accommodating, she offered attitude. We asked to speak with a manager, but was told no one  was in the restaurant. How on a weekend night, is there not a manager/supervisor on site? 

An hour after our reservation, we were finally seated, but we waited another 15 before anyone was by to greet us. We asked the hostess if we could get a sling or high chair for our sons car seat and she was confused. My wife changed our son in the restroom, but they do not have proper equipment to do so. Once the waiter took our drink order, it took another 20+ minutes before he came back and took our food order. 

While we waited and waited for food to be served to us, we watched the hibachi chef from behind having fun with the large group across from us. When he did finally come to our side of the grill, he started with a couple jokes, but then seemed to just want to get out of there. We order a couple NY Steaks and some scallops only to have to have him put it back on the griddle because they were still raw. 

Lastly, the place was absolutely disgusting. Food everywhere on the floors and even large shards of glass as well. Be careful when setting things on the ground or having little ones around.

1.  Sam the waiter was awesome!  Excellent service!
2.  I ordered sashimi. Sam came back to the table and said the sushi chef did not like the look of the fish and didn't recommend it. They fixed me something else. 

Negatives
1.  The food is overpriced for the flavor. Nothing exciting. 
2.  I went for happy hour. The menu doesn't have a good variety. I hope you like martinis and rolls. 
3.  All Osaka locations are definitely not the same, and this location is not the best of the bunch, as far as atmosphere goes.

The place looked nice on the outside and it was equally as charming on the inside. A quaint dining area, a hibachi grill and the sushi bar. We oped for the sushi bar since that is what we were there for...

The only oddity was the music selection, definitely Pandora playing (the non-subscriber channel), chock full of advertisements every 3 songs or so, a bit distracting but nonetheless a decent ambiance for the mainly 20-30s groups in there. 

We decided to go the Nigiri route. Damn they have some AMAZING preparations.... We (each) had the Salmon citrus, scallop, yellowfin, San Diego Salmon, Gralic Tuna and so on...

Everything was delightful and they had Mochi as well, which my GF loves, but we were so full we opted out. I had a Kirin and a small sake (HH Special) and they were trying to get me to order another round.

Took my family out to experience their first hibachi dining so we bought a Groupon for 6 people. Total waste $139. 
Everything is an upcharge.  And not just the difference in price ( $32 entree) they charged an upgrade fee of $17. Ridiculous. 
Our server started out attentive but because they're was another couple at our table, I feel that we got left behind ( maybe easier to cater to 2 than 6). 
Our chef was a joke too. This was my third hibachi experience and this was the worst. Luckily my family didn't know any better. The only ""entertainment"" we got was the onion volcano and the spinning egg spatula flip thing. Which he messed up. 
I can't even remember what we call ordered but the basic fried rice, shrimp,  chicken and steak and red snapper. Chicken was a little on the dry side. And the 2 sauce accompinents weren't great either. Steak was good but portion was terrible. They really need to work on plating evenly. 
The only saving grace was the 2 side orders of sushi that we got.

We dine out a lot, but I can't say that anybody in the family ever craves Osaka.  Ultimately, I feel like the restaurant could benefit immensely from being on one of those Food Network restaurant makeover shows.  It's a shame because this place has a lot of potential.  

We came tonight because we were sold on a great Groupon deal.  6 dinners for $130.  Can't beat that!!  

Let's start with the positives.  Food is tasty.  Not the highest quality meats or fish, but still pretty tasty.  

Service is good.  Our server's name was Ocean.  Very sweet and very accommodating.  We felt bad for her because servers here apparently have to bus their own tables.  Wth?!  That's a personal pet peeve of mine.  Dirty dishes stacked up next to you because nobody is there to clear it.   And drinks don't get refilled.

I think the mood is set when you first walk into the restaurant.  It is so outdated.  You feel like you're back in the 80's.  I was looking around for an old Nagel print hanging on the wall.  

IMO - You can tell a lot about a restaurant from the bathroom.  Their bathrooms look like unfinished home projects.  Spackle on the wall, unfinished paint, really old fixtures, and a tiny desk waste basket for trash.  lol. 

I think a change in ownership could make this a hot spot.  But I suppose their model of discounts, groupons, and promotions pay the bills for now.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,1,0,3,oTNjtcZLCAEzsdriVjrXvg

However, this time around I purchased a Groupon. Unfortunately, this place is extremely sneaky and they knew exactly what they were doing with the pricing structure.  With the Groupon, you are allowed up to $32 / entrée under the hibachi experience. But virtually every hibachi entrée is priced slightly over $32. I wanted the rib eye and shrimp which was priced at $35. I asked if I can pay the $3 difference. I was told that the upcharge would be $17!! So I figured out a work around. I ordered the chicken and New York steak for $30 and added shrimp for $12.  I really didn't mind, because i wanted the chicken anyway. Every other place that accepts Groupons will allow you to pay the difference in price. Keep in mind, I already purchased the Groupon. I didn't get that for free so this place still made money.  When the bill came for the 2 of us, they automatically added on the 15% gratuity. This is normally done with parties of 6+.  Too bad they lost me as a customer due to their sneaky pricing.

Recently things have changed. Service has become quite slow with uninterested wait staff. The food isn't presented as well and the portions have shrunk despite no change in price. The noise level is also pretty high, making it difficult to have a conversation. On my last visit the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted to use a coupon.

We had a wonderful time and enjoyed the quality of the food. I wish I remembered our chef's name - I want to say it was Mark or Ryan. Regardless, he was absolutely great and personable, and it made our experience that much better. He was funny and incredibly skilled, and joked around a lot.

The food was incredibly delicious, and our chef made sure to cook it to everyone's preference. He also gave us some extra items, which was appreciated. 

The only reason I am not giving it 5 Stars is that it took a while before any service started, and there wasn't very good phone reception where we were seated. This made it hard to pull up the Groupon that we had purchased.",37GTo06k6YUmjRgBqVaZBw,2,1,4,1MCd3k8MNQudjrL46JdH2w

It is actually pretty solid in both realm of sushi and hibachi. I have indulged in their hibachi offering once before and we throughly enjoyed it and the chef had a fun personality.

Normally we are there for the sushi. We especially love sushi wrapped in cucumber. It is consistently fresh with a menu boasting something for everyone. 

The service is on par.

I couldn't believe why the ratings are low. Each time we were here, we had good service and experience.

It has a pretty ambiance and I like their hip music. It's a fun place for a date or even a group.

The hibachi meals were served with miso soup, a salad, grilled vegetables, and rice.

Called And Spoke To The lead Server Because Joy was unavailable and he said it was a known issue but fixed. Blamed it on the weather. Then hung up on me. The next day I talked to Joy the owner and she said that she has a broken back door and was told by the health dept to have 30 days to have it fixed and it isn't. The door is by the cooler and the ants get in that way. This happened on a Saturday and they didn't have an exterminator come in until Monday.   Hibachi cook made a joke with the other customers and made us uncomfortable. We asked for a manager and no one was available. The only restitution was offering us a dessert. Really?

This Osaka location is very modern and it kind has a dance club vibe. The lights were dim & changing color and intensity which made menu-reading a challenge. (My family mocked me as I pulled out my iPhone flash light app to read the menu. LOL)The menu was a makeshift clipboard which didn't live up the classy feel of the place. There is even a DJ booth that the server said hadn't been used in some time. 

We had been to other Osaka locations, so we were confused when they told us that they had no relation to the other Osakas, even though the name & logo is the same. Weird.

Osaka was completely accommodating for our family with two children (2 & 3yo) and Ana, the server was super. I was excited that there was a full bar because I like a cocktail before dinner. Many sushi places only have wine, Japanese beer & sake. They even had 2 featured martinis - Lychee and Watermelon. I went with the watermelon martini over my normal Jack&7.... call me crazy... but it was a great choice.

The only beefs I have is when sushi restaurants skimp on goodies in the sushi rolls. Our table ordered 4 rolls, and they were all super delicious. The caterpillar roll had so little eel in it you would think there was a shortage. Also, I felt that some items were a little over priced.

The sushi was tasty, but the rolls are really small; like they rolled it up real tight or something. There was about 8-10 pieces, but the roll itself was small. Does that make sense?

The chandelier was more inline in a Moroccan restaurant but the disco music I have no clue why that is their choice of music in a Japanese restaurant. But the waitress also needs to be more aware of her duties. First she forgets to bring our water and my wife's hot tea.  Maybe she would have an excuse for forgetting to bring our water and hot tea if the place was busy, but when we arrived there was only two other table with one customer already finished eating the the other who was eating their food.  So there is no way she can say she was busy. We had to remind her once we finally got our food.  The food itself is average, but the food preparation leaves much to be desired. My wife and I both ordered the bento box which comes with Shrimp Tempura but her order came with two Shrimp and mine only had one.  Also the dipping sauce for the Shrimp Tempura was totally not adequate!  Just about an ounce of dipping sauce. If the waitress had any common sense, she would notice the portion for the dipping sauce was not enough and she should have at least asked if we wanted more dipping sauce.  But the sad fact is most food servers today are just going through the motion and I guess I should blame management for their lack of training also the chef or the cook who prepares the food should also have more intuition on the food they prepare.
Only positive comments I have about this restaurant was the booth was comfortable.  
I understand the waitress works for ""Tips"", but I still feel ""Tips"" should not be taken for granted and my initially reaction was to just give her maybe a dollar or five, but the bill was about $80 and I guess I should not put all the blame on her and I hope this posting will be read by management who will better train their staff.  I left her $20 because I felt sorry for her.

I arrived at 7:30 on a saturday night with two friends and was informed it would only be a few minutes wait before we were seated. The few minutes turned into a half hour wait, which we understood because we didn't make a reservation. 
After we sat down at our hibachi table is when things got really weird. First off, the room was insanely hot. Neither a waitress or waiter offered to do anything about it. secondly, the waitress told me i was not allowed to order a california roll in addition to my hibachi meal which I found a really strange policy, but whatever. We began to get irritated when it took an hour for our chef to come to our table. During this time, the two adult couples sitting with us were comped wine, but my underaged friends and I received nothing. 
An hour and a half after our arrival, we finally got some food on our plates. It was good, but the portions were really small. Also, none of their hibachi meals come with any form of rice. I thought this was strange considering how pricey each of the meals were. The whole time we ate my friends glass of water was empty, and she ended up having to flag down our waitress from across he room to get a refill.
Our bill came out to $80, and since the adults at our table were comped alcohol we felt it would be reasonable for them to give us some sort of discount or take off one of the smaller dishes we ordered, but we were told that they couldn't do that. They offered us ice cream instead, but it was a little late at this point now that we were finally full. Maybe they could have brought it while we sat waiting at our table for an hour.

The second we sat down I looked it up on yelp and I have to admit I was a little scared. So this is going to go like some of my other reviews. I'll divide this into 3 sections: vibe, service, and food. Let's go!!!

Vibe:
Honestly, the second i stepped into the place its a bit hectic. There was a bar, a sushi bar, teppanyaki grills, and regular tables.With the decor and the set up it had a very chaotic feel to the place. Plus, the furniture looked like they thrifted it. A lot didn't match and there wasn't an overall theme.

Service:
The service wasn't the downfall like some people warned. At least in our case anyway. Our waiter wasn't super attentive but he wasn't neglectful. He checked on us every once in a while.

Now the main event 
FOOD:
So we ordered gyoza for our appetizer and I ordered a salmon teriyaki bento box. To start, our waiter asked us how we wanted our gyoza. You have the choice of deep fried, pan fried, or steamed. We ordered pan fried and the texture was definitely more steamed. The wasn't any crunch to it. The bento came with salad, rice, 4 pieces of California roll, tempura, and salmon. The salad was very light on their sauce but you could taste sesame. The California roll was nice I had no complaints. Now the tempura I had a bit of a problem with...
I'm a bit of a stickler for tempura and this was not OK. The batter was very light bit that wasn't my problem. My problem was that it was soaked in oil still. Some of my vegetables were even soggy. Lastly, the salmon I was disappointed in. The teriyaki sauce was nice. It wasn't to thick or overpowering so it was good. Sadly, my portion of salmon was a bit sad. If salmon was the main protein then I expect there to be a good amount but honestly they gave me a sliver.

When we arrived we had reservations, but still ended up waiting a little while for a table. It was strange, because at this point most of the tables were empty and the restaurant was not busy at all. When we were sat at a table we immediately had to move to another table because apparently there was a mistake. The staff wasn't rude about it, but they weren't apologetic, either. 

The groupon rules were confusing at best. I've never been to a restaurant that had such confusing hoops to jump through to use a groupon. (Your meal could only cost X amount, if you went over that you couldn't just pay the amount, you had to pay half of the cost of the entree extra, etc.) While the groupon was a great deal, it was made really confusing to use. It felt like a bit of a run around, which was annoying from a restaurant that was so expensive. 

The food itself was delicious! Almost everyone at our table had the beef option and enjoyed it. The scallops one person ordered weren't as good as the beef option. And the chef was fun and entertaining, he did a wonderful job.

My family went to dinner here on a Tuesday night around 730pm. Me, my spouse, my toddler, and my infant. We had a gift card for $50, and decided to use $40-ish and apply the rest as tip. You have the choice of sitting at the sushi bar, the teppanyaki grill/tables, or a regular table. We opted for the regular table since we had the kids. 

They do have high chairs, which is nice! The grill-folk do high-fire tricks and a lot of spatula clanging, so if you have a skiddish toddler... probably not the right place to go unless you enjoy eating with a two year old sitting on your head. The seating in the regular table area was a bit awkward. Giant chairs on wheels that you sink into. The waitress chooses that moment as I am weirdly scooting back in while trying not to sink through to the floor to come up and greet us.

She was nice enough, bubbly and friendly. That, however, is the only positive comment to be had about the service. Snail paced is the best phrase to use in regards to food preparation and delivery. 
-15 minutes till we got to order and got our drinks.
-15 minutes for the appetizer (chicken katsu, which was pretty good. crunchy and well seasoned). 
-30 minutes for dinner (2 chicken teriyaki bento boxes. chicken was good. came with a huge portion of tempura shrimp and veggies. very reasonable for $15 or so). 
-30 minutes for the check (I asked if I could use the remaining $9 and change as tip and was told that I could not and would have to take the remainder as a new gift card).
-15 minutes for a piece of banana cheese cake in a box (ordered this because I didn't want a $9 giftcard sitting around. when they finally brought it to me, it was a mushy pile that had been thrown in a box. picture added here to show the cafeteria style glop that was $8).
20 minutes for change (because I could not leave the tip, I had to break a $100 bill. I asked for a $10, a $5, and five $1 somewhere in the mix of that change. I received a $50, a $10, and some $20. So I had to wait an additional 5 minutes while I flagged someone down to get the appropriate change. All this for a tip that in the end I probably should have not even bothered to give! Maybe I should have left my banana glop as a tip). 

Over 2 hours for 3 and 1/2 star food and a box of banana cheesecake baby food mash is a bit much for me and my family. Thank goodness we didn't order anything complicated, we would probably still be sitting there waiting!!! 

I have tried to call 3 times on different days at different times to talk to a manager about the appalling service, have left my name and number each time. Have not spoken to her yet. I was told ""if she doesn't call you, just keep trying"". I find that exceptionally odd. I am trying to let you know about crappy service, and you are not calling me back. Gee, I wonder where your staff get their laid back barely working attitude from. I was trying to wait until I had spoken with her to make this post, but that patience has passed.",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,4,0,2,_h1l8GRXJWjHcOK985ltng

Two of the sushi rolls ordered were for 2 different people but put in same container so closely together that it became a mess when separated to go to each person.  One was the Philadelphia roll which this person had ordered several times in the past. She noticed that it did not taste ""the same"".  She did not say it was bad- just ""different"" and she did not finish it (and it was her going-away lunch)  We also ordered 2 appetizer sized vegetable tempura ( it usually is a decent sized portion) but got 2 tiny sides of the tempura (and only  charged $5.95) but for one of the persons, that was supposed to be their ""meal"" ( and disappointingly , they were almost flavorless).  Only 1 little plastic cup of sauce ( unsure what kind or what it was supposed to go with) came with ALL of the food & 3 packets of soy sauce.  The persons who ordered the chicken teriyaki lunches said their food was fine.  Tje person who ordered shrimp fried rice said it was ""fine"" ( not the highest compliment) . The biggest let-down was not receiving the Rock Shrimp Salad ( but charged). Ok, this happens.  I call the restaurant to explain.  The employee apologized & said it was ready and did we want to come back to pick up?  Uh- no, I could not drive back to pick it up. The employee did apologize and said he would speak to his manager to correct the charge. 15 minutes later, she did call- very apologetic and said she would remove the charge. She asked for my card information in order to make the correction - including my security code # and assured it would be handled. 

Saturday I awaken to a debut withdrawal for the original amount.  I waited until 1130 am that morning to call but no one answered.  Had to leave for a day full of errands and figured that who knows what could happen in trying to collect my 9.95 back.

First the food.  Now I'm not a fan of sushi but I love teriyaki and all I got today was under cooked luke warm wet meat.  No flavor whatsoever.  The rest of my bento box was garbage to me.  Rice, four baby california rolls, tempura with one sad shrimp, some strange orange sauce and a very sad inedible salad.  I also ordered a watermelon martini and the only watermelon flavor it had was the garnish.  Horrible waste of alcohol. 

Now on to the service, which added a mandatory eighteen percent gratuity and the server didn't get a single cent over it either, it was that bad.  Our party was all seated within a few minutes and orders were taken.  Someone was served another persons dish and the waitress insisted it belonged to the person she gave it to.  Food was being boxed up for some people before others even got their meal.  We had to continue to ask her where their food was.  To top it off the person who got the wrong dish was charged for it.

But we're not big fans of Japanese food (I know, I know, it's against the Yelp Creed of Vegas dining, and probably a violation of their Terms of Service).  But once in a rare while we get a yen for a hibachi meal.  Pun intended. 

Though I wasn't enticed to dine here by many of the reviews of my fellow Elites, the $25 restaurant.com certificate we bought oh, maybe five years ago was beckoning to be used.  And I thought there must be a reason Osaka's still in business, sooo...

When we were seated, the guy asked my husband if we had a coupon.  At least he thought he asked if we had a coupon.  More about that later.

The same guy came to take our drink orders while I was looking over the list of wines.  I ordered my usual Riesling, but he said that only the house wine came with the dinners, and the house white was a Chardonnay.  I don't like it, but hey, ""comes with it"" vs $9? No-brainer from whence I come.  Besides, my taste in wine has recently changed to less sweet, so I went with that.  Herb had a beer, which also was included.  (Nothing on the hibachi menu said anything about that).  We were told we could order anything up to the $32 combos, Our confusion was growing, and I went with chicken and shrimp, while Herb had the chicken and steak.

I really enjoyed the miso soup.  Has my taste changed again, or was this especially good?  I usually tolerate it, but don't love it.   The little side salad was cute, with curls of carrots from a Vegetti-like tool making it prettier, but it sure would have been messy on a first date.  Not our problem :) Our chef wasn't Japanese, but from the South Seas islands, and he put on an entertaining show.  He followed our instructions almost to the letter, using lower-sodium soy sauce and no extra salt; he slipped up only once, immediately offering to remake it, but it was the steak, and Herb's not as salt-phobic as I.   

The food was all really tasty, including the fried rice, which we had also been told came with the dinner.  Curioser and curioser.  Until the bill came.  We'd already handed the guy our $25 coupon, and the bill now included the wine, beer, and one fried rice.  

The mystery was cleared up quickly.  I was off taking pics when Herb was asked about the coupon.  I'll never know whether the man said ""coupon"" or ""Groupon,"" but apparently there's a Groupon out there that costs, I think, $49 for a complete dinner for two, and that wasn't ours!  Then, after he explained all that, he took the check back and, without us even asking, took off the drinks and the restaurant.com discount, and gave us the coupon back.  Checking restaurant.com later, I saw that the latest Osaka coupon on that site doesn't even offer $25 off anymore, just, I think, $10.  That is Customer Service with a capital C, and that's why I've bumped it up one star to a 5.  A rare experience, and much appreciated.

I ordered the Seafood Medley (39.95) tiger shrimp,  scallops, and lobster. It comes with vegetables., salad and white rice. I upgraded to the fried rice. I was disappointed to find out fried rice wasn't automatic like most places. It was good but they would come in third with Geisha Steak house and Ohjah in the lead. The scallops were better at Ohjah.  They lacked in taste here. The guy putting on the show was cool though!

I had a dinner reservation for 7:30 for four people. We arrived on time and checked in with the host. After waiting about 15 minutes I kindly asked the hostess / owner if our table was ready. She clearly had forgotten that we were there and waiting and informed me that she had given our spot to a group that had just walked in with no reservation. However, she said this in a rude tone and began to accuse us of being late for our reservation. She had the audacity to raise her voice at my family over this ordeal. I asked her when the next table would be ready and she said two hours and then told me I should have made a reservation -- reminder, I did. The event was very embarrassing and unnecessary. Instead of apologizing for her mistake she chose to belittle and ridicule my family. Very unprofessional for a business owner... 
My family was upset over the indecent treatment, especially because we were there to celebrate!

4664081,2014-02-24,0,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"This is three stars. I ordered the Mount Fuji dinner and was disappointed. But there is context to this disappointment. I am comparing them against Geisha Japanese Steakhouse on DI and Sandhill.

When asked what came with the Fuji as far as appetizers, I was told soup, salad, two shrimp appetizers, and vegetables. I made the mistake of assuming it was tempura shrimp and vegetables like Geisha. What I got was soup, a pretty good salad, and them I got two pieces of 31-40 shrimp that were cooked on the grill. The vegetables actually came at the end of it all. In between I got the fried rice($3.50!) additional charge. It was egg, rice, and soy sauce?!?!?  Then came the chicken, the three small pieces of lobster and the steak. In fairness the steak portion was pretty good, but the steak was more ""Meh"" than anything.  With the fried rice the food was almost $47.50!

For contrast, at Geisha you get the soup and salad. You get to choose an appetizer from their appetizer menu, which I normally get shrimp and vegi tempura. Then you get vegetable fried rice(no up charge), 3-5 pieces of shrimp, chicken, lobster, steak, and stir fried vegetables. On top of that you get soda or sake, or possibly another drink. I believe they are charging $35.95 for this, which is called the Geisha special. 

In this context, this Osaka meal should get a 2, but I am giving it a 3, because price aside it really is deserving of a three. If you go to their website via the yelp app, there is a coupon for $20 off over $100, and a couple of others. 

Geisha is the benchmark, and while it is on the other side of town, it is worth the drive. It also looks like a hole in the wall and it is. Some of the best food comes from places described as a hole in the wall. 

I do however still like this Osaka for their lunch bento boxes.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,0,0,3,2jt6Rgya_NtdzGCBRahmXw

Then to the left of the bar is a full sushi bar allowing you the pleasure of watching your favorite rolls being created. Off to the right of the sushi bar is the dining area framed with numerous grilling tables. 
Our server was attentive and help us with any questions we had. My father and I each had a Sapporo and my mom had their Pomegranate martini. Her martini was garnished with fresh Pom seeds and she told us it was one of the better Pomtini's she's had. 
After we ordered drinks we moved on to the appetizers. We decided we'd get the Calamari and Spicy Edamame. The Calamari arrived fried to perfection. It was light, crisp and very fresh. A dark dipping sauce accompanied it but was a tad bitter with a strange after taste. Next came the Spicy Edamame and let me tell you; these were awesome. I would describe the taste as a somewhat meaty, garlic, red pepper fusion. Either way take my word for it and order yourself some. 
Finally we get to the highlight of the evening; Sushi. We ordered four rolls and split them between ourselves. The Hamachi (yellowtail and chive), 911 (crab,avocado, spicy tempura), California Crunch (Cali roll tempura), and The Taylor (Shrimp,Crab. topped with fresh salmon). Talk a great sushi. The Hamachi definitely had a fishy taste, but was incredibly fresh. I find that yellow tail always has that fish taste. And while you can never go wrong with Cali Crunch (its a classic) this one while incredibly tasty needed just a little more tempura to make it really crunch. The 911 was the best I have ever had! It was the perfect heat, crunch and just pure yumminess. And finally The Taylor  with its tempura shrimp and delectable crab topped with a perfect cut of salmon was my personal favorite of the night. The combination was just right with the salmon giving it a sweet almost candy like chew. -AMAZING- And I don't say that lightly. I am a very picky eater and the fact that this roll was my favorite is saying something.

4883651,2017-07-10,1,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"I have Osaka a few times but this was my first/last time at this location. 

After purchasing a Groupon we had made a reservation for 7pm and arrived a few minutes early. We were told it would be 20 minutes or we could reschedule for another day. I found this interaction to be a little frustrating. 

First off, we had a reservation and we were the only ones waiting for a table seemed a little unwelcoming. Secondly, the quick alternative of coming back another time felt like they didn't really care that we would have to wait or if we were even there. When it was time to get our table they said they could squeeze in with another group. I have no problem rubbing elbows but it was pretty tight and again it felt as if our reservation for 6 people had been given little notice or planning. 

Supposedly, the restaurant was in the process of an AC change and it was not functioning properly so it was very hot before they even started cooking the food on an open flame a few feet in front of us. I looked at the other guests and noticed a few sweaty brows and then the family next to us actually requested the waitress lower the temperature and she said she would try to lower the temperature. More outstanding customer service shining through :-) In the end they brought over a fan which provided some relief. 

The hibachi grill master showed up shortly after and did a wonderful job. He was entertaining and friendly while he prepared our meal. Unfortunately, everyone was pretty uncomfortable with the temperature and it took away from the experience. 

As with the other locations, the food was excellent, however, there is a $10 or $15 upcharge for going over the price per entree of the Groupon. Our Groupon allowed for a $32 per plate entree per person. So if you wanted an item that would be $34 it would not be $2 additional it would be $2 plus the $10/$15 upcharge. This made no sense to me and just seemed like a way to gouge the customers. 

It's hard to make an outright complaint when we came to eat and the food was great. However, the customer service leaves a lot to be desired and limited air conditioning in Vegas during July is just not acceptable. I am not sure if this is a temporary issue or an ongoing concern.",htXolAbmJlOjVZqXcnmQnQ,3,0,3,NizOI0Xe1za0rg4c9eNjKw

We got our salads and soups, and then chef was about to start with just us when another couple walked in, so our server made him wait.

He was super fun, and we all drank sake together and made great conversation. The food was TO DIE FOR. I ordered scallops and my boyfriend ordered the combo of steak and chicken. Thurston added shrimp to our fried rice. I think there were like 8 giant scallops in my order. It was SO MUCH food!!

The two other couples that we were seated with had been waiting at least 30-40 and had already placed their orders when we sat down. After placing our order, we waited an additional 30 minutes for the chef to arrive. When he started the routine of clashing and flipping the large knife and cooking fork, he lost grip of the fork and it flung into the chest and arm of a person. He was thankfully unhurt but the chef said nothing and continued cooking with the same utensil (Health code violation). Our party was sitting directly across from the chef and was splattered repeatedly with hot oil from the cooking process. Even after mentioning it to the chef, it continued to happen to the point that we had to hold up our napkins to keep from getting splashed or burned. Again, no acknowledgments or apologies from the chef. Several times the chef dropped vegetables on the table where people eating and either picked it up to keep cooking it or to place it on a plate. Disgusting and another violation. He also placed some shrimp on the wrong plate and asked the person to give it to the right person. What? The food was mediocre and, at the end of our meal, the member of the table that was hit with the large cooking fork went to speak with the manager, who happens to be the owner's son. The conversation went fine as we were simply trying bring to management's attention our chef's weaknesses. We stated that we weren't upset, the chef was never outright mean but the meal was not worth paying over $100 for between the several health code violations, hot oil splatters/burns and large fork hitting someone. The manager asked for a minute to see what he could do about our bills. He came to our table with a single $20 certificate to be used next time. After we explained the experience we had again, we asked for a discount on the meals we had or to apply a $20 gift certificate to each bill. The manager refused and said, if we didn't pay, he would call the police (which I've noticed is a trend in these reviews) and accused our party of just wanting a free meal.
I have never witnessed a restaurant that was so rude and inconsiderate. Our party intended to pay for our meal but with the terrible experience, multiple oil burns and flying fork at a person's chest, we were hoping for some sort of consolation discount. Instead we were insulted and rudely treated by the young, arrogant manager.

The first time my husband and I experienced this place was a company Christmas party a few years ago. The service and the food was wonderful. Osaka's was the place to go for my husband and I whenever we were in the mood for sushi. We noticed that whenever the manager/owner was not around, the restaurant ran smoothly, everyone was happy and at ease, which made for a pleasant experience. However, when she is around, expect that she, along with the wait staff are running around like chickens with no heads acting busy for no reason. The manager is extremely unprofessional and annoying and has no problem raising her voice to her wait staff in front of customers which I find very offensive.

What do you think happens next? If you guessed that we got seated, you're wrong...  she completely forgot about us! So 15 minutes later, we got up and walked out. Complete crap. It was actually a blessing in disguise because we ended up down the street at ""The Sushi"" on Lake Mead. The best sushi experience we ever had.

The rice was unbelievably salty, the steak tasted like New York steak versus the filet mignon it was supposed to come with. The lobster looked as though they bought langostino lobster in bulk at Costco. We ordered two appetizers, shrimp tempura and fried scallops. The tempura was nothing special, 5 stringy pieces of tempura mostly bread about a quarter of it shrimp. I think the only thing worthwhile was the fried scallops, those were good. We ordered two bowls for the kids one chicken and one steak, let's just say your better going to teriyaki madness for 8.95 you get a teriyaki bowl filled with meat rice and vegetables.

When we arrived, he greeted us by name, (knowing that we would be in) and was a great host. We were seated and served drinks and waters very promptly. The service was amazing. The chef was entertaining and laid back. Made casual conversation and was very friendly. 

Now to the best part. THE FOOD!!!! The food was fantastic. We ordered the hibachi and we got it. I ordered the steak which was cooked perfectly and my fiance' ordered the Scallops which were out of this world. The sake was fantastic and the overall scenery was perfect.

5385762,2012-08-15,6,czx3G3V_f-4ZDg9YKJ0YQA,"I read all the reviews on Osaka in summerlin and I sort of knew what I was getting myself into. I only went because people had coupons and they insisted on going. So... here is the review.

This place is HILARIOUSLY bad. You know those really bad movies that are so bad they actually turn out to be good? Troll 2, Birdemic, Manos: The hands of fate...etc. I think those movies are the best metaphor for this restaurant. It was so bad, now I get to tell stories to people about how bad it was; and, what may seem like hyperbole in the crap department is the honest truth.

Starts out with making a reservation for a regular table (not teppanyaki) for 6:30. We get there and not surprisingly they hadn't written down the reservation. (once again, I read all the other reviews so I came in with no unknown variables). So the invalid girl at the front says, ""Oh sorry, it happens sometimes, I'll get you a table ready."" NOT EVEN KIDDING. basically saying, ""Oh ya, we are screwups and we know it whatareyagonnado?"" 

So we sit at the couch for about 15 minutes at which point we ask the troglodyte what happened to our table. (Mind you there is like 2 other groups in the entire restaurant) and the girl says, ""Oh wait, you wanted a table?"" And she was TOTALLY SERIOUS! ""Actually mam, I just decided it was in my best interest to sit on this uncomfortable couch in this eastern european level sweatbox to pass time.""

I don't have enough room to go into everything about the service there, but just imply that the entire meal was more of the same... knocking over drinks, touching the ends of your hashi with their stank hands, not having shoyu, and just talking in a way that statements magically become questions using the higher inflection at the end of each sentence a la valley girl.

The food was SERIOUS garbage. I could understand this type of sushi coming from a $3.99 off strip all you can eat sushi buffet where people have just abandoned all hope of eating good food, but not from someplace that uses the name of a once stellar Vegas icon. Plus, it was super expensive for what it was.

Let me clear something up for the Osaka sushi chef (who I think was some kind of romanian perhaps?) Sushi only consists of 2 things: Vinegar rice (shari) and anything else (neta). Anyone who has ever had good sushi will tell you, the secret is cooking technique, quality and flavour of the rice; and freshness of the ingredient. Well, the rice had no vinegar in it... no flavoring at all...I would say it was of chinese take-out quality, but that would be offensive to chinese takeout. so... they basically missed 1/2 of the essential ingredients of sushi.  

Next, the rice wasn't cooked properly. I think they just sort of dumped rice in with water and decided ""meh, that looks right."" then put it in the dish steamer which is where, in my mind, I believe they cook the rice.

Finally, they didn't even roll the sushi correctly. Either they had the nori inside out, or the nori was so cheap it didn't have binding, but, before the plate had even gotten to my table, it had fallen apart. When I gave the server a look like ""wtf?"" she just shrugged and gave the, ""I hate my job anyway, nothing you can do or say will make me feel worse than I do already because I have to be here."" look back at me.

The tempura was cooked with the technique of an 8th grade cafeteria apprentice, the batter clearly wasn't cooled because it was as greasy as it could get, and all the vegetables had the consistency of toxic-waste guy from robocop. 

Lastly, people in party got sick.

Verdict: With the rise of really bad japanese restaurants in Las Vegas (with a few exceptions) maybe the new trend is going towards really bad sushi with a really steep price but drown out in blasting trendy music... But if you actually want my advice, stay far away from this place unless you want a hilarious story of caution about the downfall of the restaurant industry.",8KDf_eoUhH3wCS6NYdcLfQ,11,0,1,qundfzRUQXVX-mXYOavtmg

We were instantly greeted and seated - given the option to pick where we were comfortable. First of all, don't understand the decor at all to the point where I found myself looking at the details and getting a little annoyed. White snake print seats with green backing - Indian looking lanterns - in a Japanese setting? Anyway, my fiancé ordered a bento with beef teriyaki and it came out dry. I ordered ramen which took unbelievably long. The greeter and waitress came out twice to apologize that it's taking long. My fiancé was done with his bento by the time my food arrived. I love creme brûlée and they had a trio that included three flavors - green tea, sesame, and the original vanilla. Keep in mind beforehand I asked if I could get just vanilla for all three and they said no. I was thinking it was physically impossible. When it came out it was 3 shot glasses with each flavor - so much for pleasing your guest - why couldn't they just put 3 vanilla shot glasses? The flavored brûlées were horrible - for $10 I don't recommend this dessert.

My friend and I saw the groupon deal and without checking Yelp first to read the reviews thought we had found a good deal. At first we were told that it would be a few moments to seat us. We mentioned we had the groupon and as we went to the bar to wait the the waitress said she lied and we could be seated with another group right away. We sat and watched another group have their food prepared and then eat it for about 30-45 mins before our orders were even taken. We did get drinks and made it clear we had the deal which should've included drinks. After waiting we were given appetizers (soup) and then it took about another 10-15 minutes to take everyone's orders and prepare the food. 

Long story short, while we loved the chef Thurston who was very friendly and personable and the waiter Miguel was attentive, this restaurant does not overall deserve a 5 star rating. By the end of the night and even with a groupon deal we still were charged an additional $59, which made it completely pointless to use the certificate. Plus we had to pay a tip.

    The only good thing about this restaurant was that we didn't pay full price. First the hostess was busy talking to another employee when we entered and seemed bothered that we had walked in. She asked ""How can I help you?"" Which seems pleasant enough but was a strange greeting for a restaurant. When I replied that there were two of us she apparently expected me to tell her whether we wanted dining, sushi bar, or hibachi grill, as she seemed annoyed that she had to ask and I hadn't originally specified. This wouldn't have even bothered me if the rest of the experience had been good, but no such luck.
     The atmosphere (which is usually the last thing I care about) was very lacking. Dirty seats and walls. Paper instead of table clothes. Instead of the dim lighting adding ambiance it seemed like it was covering up a dilapidated interior.
     The menu was completely different than others in the chain. They did not have my favorite dish (spicy chicken) and so I chose the chicken teriyaki. The chicken was dry and not very flavorful. The rice was no where near the Osaka standard I have come to expect. And prices were nearly 40% higher than the Sahara location. 
     The waiter was decent but not great. We didn't even stay for dessert, which is my favorite (Tempura fried ice cream! Yum!), as I didn't want to be further disappointed.

I used to go to Samurai with my family when I was a kid in Ohio- they were the first of the restaurants I'd heard about where the food was prepared teppan style, at your table, which is actually a grill.  Samurai was overtaken by Benihana's, which I never visited, so Osaka was a nice reminder of the fun I used to have at Samurai.

Before all of our group arrived, a couple of us sat at the bar where the friendly waiter showed us pictures of the place during their evening DJ event. Twice a week they have laser lights and DJ'd music that is apparently pretty fun- the DJ even dances on the bar, so it must get pretty lively sometimes. I'm gonna have to check that out!

When you eat in the teppan area, your group is seated at one side of the large table, and a group of strangers is given the other seats. Everyone orders at once so that the chef cooks for the whole table. This means that if one of your party is late, too bad. The chefs are pretty entertaining- very silly, creating a party atmosphere.  

We had a fun time at dinner, as our chef was a real performer. One of the women in my party discovered that every noise she made was incorporated into our chef's performance, which made for some hilarious ""call and response"" moments between the two of them.  Displaying knife skills, juggling know-how and other odd talents, the chefs give you a pretty fun experience.  I suspect that working there can be fun, since each chef likely has his own ""act"".  Ours liked to play the harmonica at opportune moments. 

I like the decor here- very stylish and hip. The food is somewhat pricey, so this is definitely only an occasional experience, but its good, and during happy hour, the food is more affordable. They do a good job with the sushi as well.

Our family will NEVER come back to this restaurant. We normally go to another sushi restaurant and we should have stuck with our regular place.... Here is what occurred... 4 people ordered sushi and 1 person ordered a bento box. The sushi came out and 20 mins later, after we were almost completely through with our meal, the bento box finally arrived. We mentioned it twice to the server. He was very nice and apologized but said there was nothing he could do because the kitchen was behind. We asked to speak to a manager. We started by complimenting the quality of the food and Dylan our server. But we told her how unsatisfactory it was that the person in our party was sitting with no food for the majority of the meal. Just watching everyone else eat is not fun. She apologized and said that should never have happened and she hoped it would be better next time. She then offered free dessert for the whole party of 5. My grandmother was getting tired and we needed to get her home so we thanked her for that offer but asked instead just to have the bento box taken off the bill. It was as if a switch in her was flipped. She turned into a monster for lack of a better word. The rest of the conversation was nothing short of embarrassing at that point. (For her not for us.) She loudly told us that she was the owner and she would not adjust the bill. To quote her, ""Did you eat the bento box?"" Yes he ate it. He was starving by the time it came. Then she said, ""I have chefs to pay and they make more than $10/hr so I can't be taking food off the bill that you ate."" Huh? So you were going to comp dessert for 5 people but you won't credit $18 for a bento box??? For the OWNER to treat customers in such an abusive manner is ridiculous. We weren't a young rowdy group. We were there with our parents and grandmother. We were customers that deserved to be treated with respect. I insisted at that point that she take the money off the bill and she finally did after arguing and mocking me in front of other customers. When she looked at the bill and saw that we had a Groupon, she turned around and loudly said, ""You have a Groupon and you're trying to get something for free?"" That is not the point at all. A Groupon does not mean that we shouldn't get the same quality of service as someone else. And obviously the business is looking for new customers or they would not have offered a Groupon. She then came back and literally threw the bill down on the counter in front of me and told us, ""I hope you never come back here again."" No worries there. And just for the record, Dylan was fantastic and we tipped him 20% in cash on the entire amount of the bill, including the full amount of the Groupon. So the owner cannot say that we were trying to be cheap. We were disgusted to say the least by the owner's behavior.",aVwI5Jf9XcIbDubsO3eibw,0,0,1,X2YIz7bYbLvBI6LABtrWpg

According to the descriptions on the Groupon it states the deal is including 4 entrees up to $32, actually it's not, we order two hibachi specialties each is $37, we suppose to pay $5 different, but we actually need to pay additional $17 for each order. Our sever is Ocean, she didn't explain well on how the Groupon works, and we didn't know what size are the entrees, to be safe, we decided to order two hibachi specialties( $37 each)and two regular hibachi($32 each) The portion was really surprising me! The lobster is very tiny! It's about 2-3 small bites, the scallops dish is 10 little pieces, The prime ribs is less than 5 little bites, I never see the dishes that small! The cooker is fine, I always smile, but he has not much expression, he cooked well on the seafoods, but the vegetables were burned, it's so dark! I regret I didn't take the pictures. after we finished the meal, we still feel hungry. The seafood is fresh, so I give it one star. The bill came, we need to pay $72.17 including 18% service fee. I don't know what is up/server fee mean, so I go asked Our server Ocean, she doesn't have patience, she said I need to read the Groupon fine print, she said it's the hibachi specialties fee. I feel like I got trap here. If I don't use the Groupon, I will pay $37+$37+32+32 =$138+ tax and service fee(this menu price including sake or drinks, and 4 fried rice). I used the Groupon I paid $99+$72.17=$171.17. I think both are about the same price , but Groupon only come with 2 fried rice. So the Groupon they posted its $172 value for the meal are lying, they are not a honest business! BE AWARE if you use Groupon!! We went home ate another dinner after this meal. It's a bad experience for me.

2. the portions and the drinks slimmed down big time, the house saki comes now in this tiny weeny bottle containing maybe 4 ounces...maybe.

Agree with other reviews that food is overpriced (that is why mentioned coupon).  Good for 2 $32 menu for hibachi table. But, if you want something that costs more, there is a surcharge of $10-$17?

Leah was our waitress and KK was our chef.  Soup broth was good, salad, ok.  2 shrimp for taste while watching chef cook. KK was nice. Garlic butter had no flavor. My Ny strip tough (cooked medium well instead of medium), filet was good. Ordered sushi roll w/eel. Rice was a little dry.  KK tried his best to be funny & his skills seemed like maybe needs to change because the chefs have been doing this for years. What is sad is restaurant needs a makeover.

This is a 2-star review for very clear and obvious reasons described below. Thank you to the Osaka Japanese Bistro Summerlin family for doing the best under such horrible circumstances, but let's face the facts as they exist:

A) The entry to this restaurant is a fire code violation. People standing around blocking the only restaurant entry/exit violates City Of Las Vegas fire code. And at any given time the entry/exit was booked by a dozen or more people.
B) Bar staff sucked. I  arrived 15 minutes before 7pm for my reservation at 7pm, and was told by the Maitre D'ame to have a seat at the bar... 30 (tH1rTy) minutes later I got my first drink.
C) It took 96 minutes.. Yes...Ninety Six minutes... To seat a party of two, and the bartender spoke to me twice: once to ask if I  wanted a drink, once to collect my bar tab.
D) service sucked. Hint: if you are on a low-carb diet, ask for (steamed) rice... You'll never get any rice at all. I  finally got my water glass as I was -p-a-y-i-n-g- my bill.

But our mood quickly darkened when the restaurant reservation we had made the day before was nowhere to be found in the reservations book. Fortunately, a group of diners waiting ahead of us decided they would rather dine at a regular table. So, our wait for seating at the grill was not long. But it was 103 degrees outside when we entered the restaurant, and not much of a contrast when seated before the grill. In that warm, sweltering room, a drop of sweat rolled down one eyeglass lens before the grill had even been heated. 

To start off, eager to sample some sushi, I ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll. But I can't comment on it, because it never arrived. Near the end of my meal I realized that I never received this appetizer, and told our server that I no longer wanted it. He just smiled and, without uttering an apology, said matter-of-factly that he would take it off our check. Really? It never should have been charged in the first place. 

But most of the food we did receive was very good. Miso Soup with green onion and tofu was very tasty. But a mixed green salad with Romaine Lettuce, carrot shavings, and ginger dressing tasted bitter and was just okay. Two tender, succulent medium-sized Shrimps only whetted the appetite. Shrimp was available as a side order, and I wished I had ordered it to enjoy a greater quantity. Grilled vegetables--especially the zucchini--were juicy and just exuded flavor. Tender sliced cubes of Filet Mignon were cooked perfectly medium-rare as ordered, although the dipping sauce for the meat was thinner than would be ideal. Lobster tails looked very pretty sizzling on the grill, and the plump morsels of cooked lobster meat were tasty and somewhat sweet. Our teppenyaki master was engaging and friendly, and very skilled at his craft. He certainly knew how to grill! Egg-enhanced Fried Rice was as good as I have experienced. Just delicious!  (Long-grained Steamed White Rice was moist and tasty as well.) 

As we were walking out of the restaurant, I realized that we had received our bill without first being asked whether we were interested in any dessert. The Restaurant.com deduction helped to cushion what would otherwise have been a pricey dinner ($31.95 for one order of Filet Mignon & Lobster alone), but it comes with an automatic 18% gratuity. We still had a good meal, but the multiple miscues certainly detracted from the overall experience.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,1,0,3,MScXBgiALHgtidqxqu7nGw

I told her no & she pointed me back to the bar around 7:18 My entire part was there so I went back to the hostess & her reply was ""When there's a table available then we will seat you""
I concluded that was fair b/c my party was about 20 mins late. But we didn't sit down until about 8:26 .
When we FINALLY sat down they when we were served out soup & salad the waiter nearly spilled soup on 3 people & one person successfully since he was slamming everything on the table.
There were no silverware present & most of the table had to swap drinks.
The chef was very nice but I've never had food so bland in my life .
The portion size was terrible everyone who got chicken legitimately got about 6 mini chunks of chicken on their plate & for the price that's completely unacceptable 
The chicken was overdone & hard as well as the steak the shrimp was pretty good but the friend rice tastes like white rice equal to no flavor. 
I mentioned on my reservation that there was a birthday in the party as we waited to get seated I watched the staff sing Happy Birthday at least 6 times & bring out ice for the birthday person none of that occurred when we sat down even though the hostess did double check if there was a birthday in my party
Overall my check came up to about $130 for 2 people which I've never paid so much for hibachi in my life & it wasn't even worth the price or the 18% gratuity they tacked on that came up to $30 
My experience was HORRIBLE ! The service was terrible from the time I walked in I should have known from that point to turn around but I wanted to give this place a shot .
Do Not waste your hard earned dollars here b/c you will be upset & hungry when you leave !",dQhcjmYLFcG3Ipfx8Yqi3w,4,0,1,gZ3-34GPjaE9loFNsBHPNA

Our reservation was at 8:30, took about 10 mins to be seated, & at around 9:15 the hibachi cook finally came out (granted there were a few birthday parties going on) I waited another 30 minutes for my sushi & fried rice. Maybe the waitress was frazzled from so many people. Idk I will not return because the food was sub par for the price. The only good out of the place was the hibachi chef Jorge he was amazing, he deserves a raise.",eEo3SmqjLZzm6vApdOoLPw,0,0,2,Sxc5w3vYWsa7tHPVytToJQ
