Like she didn't want to be there. I ordered the Carne Asada with shrimp and it was over cooked and dry. The green salsa was nice and spicy. The salsa that was brought out with chips seemed to have too much lemon. So this was a hit or miss place I guess. I personally will not return and unfortunately I can't say I would recommend it.  I prefer consistency in my food.  Good chips, salsa not so much, carne asada dry, shrimp over cooked, rice and beans were good. The weird thing was after we were done eating we all got tired like if we just had thanksgiving dinner. Never saw the waitress after she brought our food. Even the suckers they gave us had a weird taste.",Igd1N4Jf9KSS54iEy9L3nw,0,0,2,WmgYmqCa6UBP0t_yqB2ihg

And it's fact if there's only one person waitressing it's going to take a while until they come and get your orders (but I don't mind because I personally been the waiter in a busy restaurant with no help plus the salsa and chip hold me up for the while.) and it's only happened to me once in like the 2 dozen times I've gone. 

If you place your order to go tho it's much better the wait time in normally about 15-20 min",CXBxQh2ean0gkO7s-R2R5g,0,0,5,ABqFEElNI_RKLaEtoVyOmg
