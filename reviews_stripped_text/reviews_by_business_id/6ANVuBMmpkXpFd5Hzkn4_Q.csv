The decor was stunning, but hey, this was Vegas. The food was just mediocre. I ordered some dumplings and chicken satay. I have had better. I remember my sister ordered some watermelon juice that she kept raving about, so it must have been some good juice! The service was nothing exceptional, we had a bit of a wait to be seated, but that's normal on a Saturday night. It was a nice try, but definitely NOT worth the money,",Hk8P5Obmi4raim9df-F-yQ,0,0,2,Kk9lV5vuenz9piUyNWx5QA
32968,2011-06-01,0,6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q,"Check out the ceiling by the entrance!  The restaurant has a robust atmosphere and can put one in a lively mood!

The best part of the meal was dessert.  So, I'll start with what we had.  We ordered mango pudding and it was delicious!  They also had other desserts that were appealing --- lychee sorbet, coconut pudding, etc. but aside from the mango pudding, we also ordered their fried banana with ice cream. I know it's hard to mess up fried banana.  But Red 8's was fried to perfection -- not too sweet and not too soft!!!

The main dishes we had included mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken both of which were moderately-spiced.  There was nothing extraordinary about the dishes.  I suppose they tasted comparable to chinese food from any China town, only served in fancier plates.  We also had vegetable fried rice and it was average.  

Although we were in a lively mood at dinner, having spent an entire day filled with activities, the food did not necessarily sustain our mood.  I felt a little dehydrated towards the end, which is why I drank a lot of water and ate most of the desserts to neutralize the slightly-salty taste from the beef.",cyV8r3mMYnQ4vV7wRWAzMA,0,0,3,NzIV2XPcjp2maqum-PfxAg

Cantonese Potstickers- lots of meaty filling, but the skin wrapper wasn't the best.

Mongolian Beef-extremely tender cuts of beef, but the sauce wasn't sweet enough (I hate to say it, but PF Changs is better!)

Green vegetables garlic stir fry-probably the best dish as the veggies were fresh and crisp and it included a nice variety of Chinese broccoli, asparagus, baby bok choy, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, and plenty of chopped garlic!

48551,2015-05-24,1,6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q,"I guess I'm not getting all of the wonderful reviews. I thought Red 8 was really just ""okay"". I ate here on a Wednesday night after flying in, and it was a little bit late as well, so the place was pretty empty. It's very low energy, which might be good if that's what you're searching for.

Our waiter was nice enough but not at all helpful - no suggestions, no explanation of the menu regarding sizes of the dishes or recommendations regarding whether we should share, etc. I live in South Central Texas, so although I love Asian food, I'm no expert at ordering it because other than disgusting, huge Chinese buffets, there are no Asian restaurants around here. I needed help knowing how big the dishes were to order properly, so I felt lost. I would have loved to have been more adventurous in my ordering and tried new things, but the menu is just lists of dishes and zero explanation about what's in them.

We ended up with pork steamed buns, spring rolls, a bowl of Hot and Sour soup, and Kung Pao Chicken. The steamed buns - one of my favorite things - were disappointing. They weren't cooked properly, so they were gooey, not soft and delicious, and I found the round, ball-like presentation not what I was expecting since I've only ever had them shaped more like a taco. The spring rolls were fine (it's a spring roll). My mother had the Hot and Sour soup, and she's so extremely unable to tolerate spice that her eyes were watering, she was sniffling, and she couldn't finish a third of it. I had the Kung Pao Chicken, and conversely, I found it bland but decent.

I really don't see any reason I'd go back to Red 8, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.",0c-F2TWIcP8ejWoc5MWajQ,0,0,3,TBXamH7KFT5tuwY0D9Ed8Q

Since it was during the day, it felt more casual although the decor is beautiful and I can image it would be a fairly romantic spot for a dinner with all the red and black colors. 

We had the Curry Vermicelli noodle dish along with the chicken satay app. We also tried the sweet & sour chicken. Everything was phenomenal and it really hit the spot!

We had chicken fried rice, Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef.  There were no standouts.  The dumplings tasted homemade and fresh but were still just ok.

Both dishes were incredibly bland with no seasoning whatsoever.  I had to load up my soup with soy sauce just to make it palatable (something I never do in an Asian restaurant).

Yes, most people know that you can get more value for your dollar if you go down to the multitude of restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd.  But, if you are at the Wynn this is an very good alternative.  Yes, there are no reservations but aside from the Buffet, Terrace Point Cafe (open 24hrs), ZooZaCrackers (deli) where will you dine at the Wynn without blocking off 1.5-2 hours for your meal.  Once you look at the menu one can see that Red 8 is a cornucopia of asian food ranging from Malaysian (the chef is Malay), Chinese, Thai.  There is a small selection of dim sum that is very good.  The highlights of the menu (in my opinion) is the dim sum, Oxtail Soup, Malaysian Beef/Chicken Satay, Malaysian Spicy Fried Rice with Prawn Crackers & Mango Chutney, Roast Duck & Roast Pork Combo, Chilean Sea Bass Salt & Pepper Style, and Coconut Pudding for Desert.  
There are other great dishes.  Ask the staff what the chef would send to his friends.  Also, it appears to me that many dishes have a kick so if you do not like items too spicy I would let the staff know when you order.
Again, you will be paying strip prices but if you do not have reservations at other restaurants Red 8 is a good alternative unless you want to eat the cafe or deli.  
Also, Red 8 is open until 11pm on Sun-Thurs and 1am or Fri/Sat.

598604,2011-11-08,0,6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q,"During a stay at the Wynn, my family wanted a quick and casual meal on the property without breaking the bank.  We had youngsters and our parents weren't in the mood for ""fine"" dining, so we decided to try a ""family style"" meal at the Red 8 Restaurant.  We had 8 people in our group: 3 senior citizens, a couple of young adults and younger ones.  

Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately noticed how quiet things were.  Aside from another small group that came in close to when we were trying to leave, the restaurant was completely empty.  I actually like when things are quiet because the service is usually better, but it was not so at the Red 8.  We were the ONLY guests in the restaurant but they managed to ignore us for long stretches and disappear to the back.  They took our order and brought out the food...and that was basically all we saw of our waitperson.  Of course, this meant that we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get our bill and pay for it, not to mention empty glasses and a bunch of unsatisfied family members, but bad restaurant experiences happen, right?

Before I get to the food, I should say a few words about the restaurant.  It was red, clean, modern, didn't look like your typical Chinese restaurant (but the Wynn isn't trying to give you the typical), and was very dark.  Our parents couldn't see anything, but I can see how they might have been trying to create an intimate or romantic ambiance with the dim lighting.  It really didn't do anything for me, but I can see how some people might like it or be impressed.  You know what they say about dim restaurants - it's dark so you can't see the food.

I have only been here once because I do not have a reason to return despite my numerous stays at the Wynn.  Your experience may be different, hopefully better than mine, though I'm not sure if I'd even take a chance considering the plentiful options and my overall experience at the Red 8.  Basically, the food is very similar to what you would find at a Panda Express.  I know it sounds like an unreasonably low-blow, but if you've eaten here, you'd probably agree with my assessment.  I realize the Red 8 tries to dress up the dishes with ingredients or better cuts of meat, but the taste, presentation, and even the portions seemed to come straight from a carryout container from Panda Express.  I have had my share of fancy Chinese restaurants/banquets, and the Red 8 isn't even in the same class as a P.F. Chang's, which is terribly disappointing considering my high opinion of the Wynn Resort.  

Our total bill came out to about $300 with tip.  It was the worst meal I've had on the Wynn Property, and probably one of the worst overall dining experiences I've had in Vegas.  I'm not sure what's more annoying: paying premium prices for inferior food or the terrible service - that's why I cannot give this place a recommendation.  The Wynn could ""comp"" my meal during my next visit, and I'd still pass because I'm not in Vegas to take a chance on my entertainment/food.  I'll gamble at the tables, but not with my meal.  

In my opinion, the Red 8 Restaurant seems more like a tourist trap for Asian guests at the Wynn than an actual restaurant - if you know what I mean.  Try the Lemongrass Restaurant at Aria or go straight to Panda Express - but avoid the Red 8.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,0,1,HwQrtRkdPT74TsU7Xqkd-g

Red 8 is a pan-asian restaurant.  The dramatic interior/exterior makes up for its quiet-like setting.  We were seated right away with no wait which was nice.  Our picks for dinner:  mongolian beef, ma po tofu (spicy minced pork and soft bean curd), and salted fish fried rice with chicken.  For drinks I ordered the thai iced tea.

We made a comment to our waiter that we were kind of in a rush for La Reve which he understood.  We had about 45 minutes to eat.  As we waited for our food I glanced at the decor.  Lots of red and dark wood surroundings.  I thought they did a great job designing the place.

The dishes arrived fairly quickly that I was impressed.  So quick that I kind of felt bad for the couple who was there prior to our arrival whose dishes hadn't arrived.  The dishes we ordered were well prepared and very tasty.  

The mongolian beef was very tender.  The ma po tofu was great except for the minced pork which I thought was unusual.  It was minced yet they had some thin slices of pork in it but I still liked it regardless, and the tofu was fresh.  The chinese spices made it a wonderful dish.  The salted fish fried rice with chicken was fantastic.  It had the perfect salted fish-rice-chicken ratio.  Our meal was executed well along with their attention to detail and service.  

Not considered fine dining here but I really enjoyed it.  The menu is a little pricey but you get what you pay for and honestly I think you can't go wrong eating at any of the Wynn restaurants.",kP3_daaPvUeLxbr4ZOynXQ,3,3,4,62NUOum5oVYd7KO0XJisYg

Last year when I came to Vegas, I had the best wonton soup (at least in the west coast) in the Buffet in Wynn. Since then, I had cravings for the soup again and again. Born in Hong Kong, I was not able to find the same quality of wonton soup in the States. Expecting the same soup from Red 8, I have to say I was disappointed. 

The reason wonton soup had drifted apart from: 

Wonton: Tasted okay and had better pork compare to other places. Didn't give me wow factor. 

Noodle: They used very thin noodle which is different from typical Chinese restaurant. However, I like the more chewy kind of noddle much better in this dish. 

Soup: I am sorry Red 8, but the soup is the worst, even worse than other restaurants and very blended taste.... Soup is suppose to be the soul of wonton soup, and that was one of the reasons I liked the wonton soup from the Wynn Buffet. Red 8 added very little green onion and no garlic chives at all! 

Aside from wonton soup, we ordered the dumpling noodle. The best of this meal was the Chicken satays. $10 for four pieces. I also liked our waitress who was a Korean lady. She was helpful and made this dinning experience a good one: bringing syrup and extra lemon for my tea, bringing more green onion for my soup, etc. I hope there would be improvement for the food in the future.",nLuNaKK2mXrqBM2M9ikXMg,0,0,3,y2I26tqtdrdNiyhOUHKF7w

i was pleasantly surprised with this place. maybe we just got simple stuff that's hard to screw up:
- rice congee (1000yr old egg with pork). lots of egg chunks and pork. we requested a side of the typical add-on's: pork sung, bamboo shoots, pickled radishes. i wish they would give us more. but 1 order of congee is big enough to share. (unless you like to eat pho bowl size portions.)  **when you are hung over from encore/wynn, you will be glad that a bowl of hot soupy rice is nearby.
- dimsum - shu-mai, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet and pan-fried dumplings. i was really skeptical bc i dont really care for dim sum. but i enjoyed it. although it was $$ ($9 for 4 shumai), it was not greasy, had actual chunks of shrimp, not ground up mystery meat. it was all just clean tasting, not oily or salty. 
- pan fried noodles: ok, you can skip this. it was kinda bland, but anything can be fixed with some soy sauce and sriracha. the egg noodles had a good crisp and chew, huge shrimp and a good amount of vegetables. again, it was not greasy like typical chinese food.

A group of us we're at the pool for the majority of the day and then got hungry so we decided to go to Red 8 at the Wynn side. We approached the hostess desk to get a table for 4 and she told us that she can't help us because they have a dress code and can't seat one of our persons since he's wearing a tank top. Mind you he's not wearing a wife beater and there were a few people seating who had on tank tops. Also to add, we were staying in the Tower suites at the Encore so not like we're rift raft just strolling thru the property. We pointed out to the hostess that they have people seated and eating who are wearing tank tops and all she kept saying was that's their ""resort dress code policy"". I find that amusing since we ate at Jardin a few hours before dressed in the same attire. My group then asked to speak to a manager and someone else came out just reiterating the same thing. I then asked for the general managers name and card so I can contact them. The manager what for and I told her, ( named Ida Shek) to inform them how we're being treated. Both my host and attorney will both be hearing of this. I'm all for rules, laws, and equality.... but don't tell me it's not allowed when there's other people inside dressed the same way.

* Service: friendly and courteous

- Oxtail Soup: $12---flavorful and filling

- Fried String Beans w/ xo sauce: DELICIOUS. fresh veggies w/ flavorful(a bit spicy) sauce.

- Salted Fish Fried Rice: talk about authentic! surprised to see this on the menu and had to cringe a bit for paying $28 (as opposed to $7 in LA), but it was very tasty. We needed to fill up before a looong night of partying, so this dish did the job.

The vegetables were also delicious so I decided to go a hard and try the meat. It was excellent. Very tender and had a great flavor. I would absolutely order again. 

The Jade Dumplings also looked a little bizarre as they are bright green. They were also delicious. Very moist and tasty filling.

If they would like to box up the uneaten portion of their dinner, box it all up instead of half.  Ask them if they'd like dessert or anything else before you drop the check on their table.

So what if I'm not hungry, I came in for drinks, and if I decide later on to order food, so be it. However as soon as I mentioned that I only wanted to do cocktails, the server's attitude changed.  I hope one of the managers reads this soon. I'm having the mandarin mojito, black tea, and some dim sum. I understand quality can take time, but this felt like negligence rather than anything else from the server. she never smiled, and i never felt accommodated. I expect nothing less than excellence in service from such a fine establishment that prides its service, setting, and luxury. 

The hostess was the young female with the short hair, and she was cheerful and welcoming towards me to come on in and try the place. I mentioned to her I felt like having a cocktail and she gladly went over the drink menu with me and recommended the mandarin mojito. I really think she did better than my server, and I feel she was the only pleasant part of my whole experience here.

Growing up near Alhambra, Monterey Park, and Chinatown, I have had my fair share of Cantonese food and Dim Sum.  In my opinion the flavors of Red 8 are a lot lighter than ones from here in SGV area.  All the dishes I had were good but light, and my theory is that the lighter flavors are meant to cater to those who don't eat Dim Sum on almost a weekly basis.  I must say, however, that the texture of the foods were very good.  

We ordered five dim sum dishes, abalone fried rice, and Peking duck.  It was definitely a nice change to experience the lighter flavors, but the price was a little high.  Well, maybe I have just been spoiled from the dollar dim sum dishes here in SGV.  And it is Vegas, so everything is overpriced.

Our thinking started something like, ""It's in the Wynn, they are hyping the crap out of most of the food at the Wynn so maybe this will be good Chinese food.""  

Boy how disappointed we were. We ordered 3 things. The Pork and Pickled Egg Congee, The Maple Syrup Glassed BBQ Pork and the Mar-po Tofu (Mabo, Mapo, people all spell it different ways)

Congee is supposed come with side dishes, otherwise it's too bland. This one didn't and when we asked if they had any pickled side dishes they could give us they said no.

The BBQ Pork was way too light on, shall we say, crust? The part of the pork that has absorbed the basting sauce that makes HK BBQ so yummy so the pork at Red 8 by taste was maybe a 3 out of 5. But worse, half of it was gristle.

Finally the Mar-po Tofu appeared. Just from looking at it it was clear it would be no good. Mar-po Tofu is supposed to be RED because the sauce is red. It's supposed to be SPICY. It's supposed to have pork in it, at least enough to see a few pieces per cube of tofu. This one appeared to have about 3 peebles of pork, it was almost colorless and once we tried it it's taste matched it's look. It was practically flavorless. Seriously, any pre-packaged mar-po tofu at a Chinese market would have been better than this.

For the price we knew we'd end up paying we decided it wasn't worth suffering though this crap so we called the manager, told him we were unhappy with the food and left.

I felt bad for having to take it that far but that simple 3 piece meal would probably have been $80 at Red 8. For that price I expect the REAL THING not this crap.

Where to start... It's Christmas and like tradition we had to get Chinese food. We've been to Wazuzu before and love it, but tried Red 8 as a change of pace.

Positively, we were able to call from our room to put our name on the 1.5 hour waitlist (no reservations). We came down an hour later and were seated 10 min after that. 

It just went downhill from there. We asked our waiter how big the portions were, and his reply was ""a good size."" Wtf. I said ""this big?"" (Gesturing with my hands) or ""this big?"" (Gesturing with my hands)... ""Yeah, that big,"" he said. Thanks for the non-clarification. 

We also wanted to order one of the specialty ""Wynn Macau"" noodles, but with chicken instead of pork. We were told that wasn't allowed, as the soups are ""pre-made."" That should've been sign #1. 

We ended up ordering the following:
-Pork wontons in chili oil: pork had NO taste, and even if it did, the overly spicy and oily sauce would way overpower it anyway disgusting. 
-Marinated chicken with supreme soy sauce: this was kind of like Peking duck, but chicken and way more disgusting. And cold (remember: everything is premade). The chicken was kind of fatty, which is ok because of the style they were going for, but it had no taste whatsoever. 
-noodles with beef in soya sauce: noodles were crispy, but the sauce had no taste. Beef was also cold and stringy and was of poor quality. 

The guys sitting next to us got their food and were staring at it. We looked over and started laughing. ""If the shrimp were any smaller they'd be dust mites,"" he told us.  Enough said. 

all in all, this place is disgusting on all levels. Service and food. Now I'm from NY, so I know my Chinese food and this ain't it. 

We'll be going back to Wazuzu tomorrow, but first we're having a real dinner. Hopefully our second dinner at Zooza Crackers is better.

Noodles: Niu nan (beef tendon) noodle was decent, and for the less adventurous the pork & shrimp dumpling noodle was delish. Everything tasted fresh and well-made - zero MSG after-taste.

1932745,2012-09-19,0,6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q,"Some people may feel that Red 8 serves over-priced, average quality chinese food.  But let me right off the bat say that the food here is actually of a pretty good quality.  It is true that you will pay a slightly higher price for the food given that it is in the upscale Wynn hotel, but then again, if you really crave good, authentic asian food while on the strip and do not have the time to drive out to Chinatown, then Red 8 is probably a good place to settle, because it does have decent food.  So I've giving it a solid three stars becuase it is nothing spectacular, but when you just want a simple Asian meal in a nice setting, then Red 8 is the place to go.  Head to Wing Lei if you want an upscale experience with phenomenal quality Chinese food. 

The setting is pretty casual and you can come in dressed as you are, although I have seen some people dining here who are dressed pretty nicely.  Order their noodle dishes - get it from the section of the menu which offers noodle dishes from the Wynn Macau.  Those are the excellent dishes, and if I remember prices correctly are priced about $15 per plate of noodles. Not bad for the Wynn, I think. 

I've eaten here a few times and the last time I was here I got the Mapo Tofu.  It was delicious.  The sauce was not too starchy (which can happen when too much corn starch is used) and the pork was pretty lean, yet still added flavor to the dish. As an aside, the debate over mapo tofu is usually whether to use lean or fatty pork.  Fatty pork obviously lends more flavor to the dish, but lean pork is preferred by health-concious consumers. 

My wife often ordered noodle soup dishes as she loves them, and the times I have been here for lunch, I always see Asian customers eating the noodle soup dishes, so they are probably pretty good.  As for me, I prefer more saucy or gravy-type dishes, hence my recent pick of their Mapo Tofu.",v9NRkMIK945RLdnPetP7qA,1,0,3,siK6z_kcBKatvg6vDT4f1Q

This most recent time I had the curried Singapore rice vermicelli with shredded pork, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts, as well as the wok-fried chicken in black bean sauce. I always share family style with a coworker. The bill is always $70 something, and I always use the corporate credit card. It's one of the few ""casual dining"" options at Wynn, and still obscenely expensive. It's all relative I guess. This place is relatively shabby as far as Wynn dining options go, only because they do not provide complimentary royal princesses from third-world vassal countries to massage your hands with slightly heated polished rubies every time you have to strain your fingers by cleaning your pasty pasty mouth with a wetnap made of a thousand dollar bill infused with a mixture of 1938 Clos du Mesnil champagne and the sweat of a virgin king cobra.

Not bad considering it was Saturday night right before the clubbing hour.  

The food was pretty good ... and I'm Chinese.  So I've had all sorts of Chinese food.  From cheap to ridiculously expensive.  From street vendor to exclusive VIP.  I really enjoyed it.   You can tell that an actual Chinese person prepared the meal and menu versus PF Chang's where it's Caucasian owned and run.  

We started with the char siu bao, pot stickers and cold cucumber salad.  Both were prepared to perfection.  Everyone at the table had different cravings and decided to not share. I had something more traditional, beef brisket noodle soup.  They used really good meat and it was well marinated.  Since I've been a kid, I've been to scared to eat the tendons, but that is suppose to be the best part of the meal.  And they had good portions of the beef and tendons, both very fresh and tasty!  The broth is also what makes the meal, it was very tasty and not oily like in most cheap Chinese restaurants. 

Yes, the meal was more expensive than what I'm used to spending for a bowl of noodles, but hey, we were in Vegas at the Wynn....and it was tasty!  It's more important that I enjoy what I eat.   I'd be silly to think that it would actually be cheap at the Wynn versus a hole in the wall in Monterey Park. I'd definitely go back.",ggtwHX4GVBY1J7TAVlqvuw,2,3,4,LP2JL_8ZJqxEXZy1UIb1EA

Let me start of with a disclaimer though- you cannot compare this place to Wing Lei, as other reviewers have done.  Not only is Red 8 in the casual dining tier versus Wing Lei's fine dining classification, but Red 8 is meant to cater to a different crowd.  Tourists, yes, but a different type of tourist.  One who doesn't want to splurge on food, just wants something quick to eat, or wants a Pan-Asian meal because essentially, that is what Red 8 serves.

A reviewer earlier described this place pretty accurately- a Panda Express on steroids.  Just throw in some Indonesian, Thai, and Cantonese dishes in there and you're all set.

The food was pretty good- nothing stunning, but something worth its money.  I had the pineapple fried rice, which was very nice since I don't know of any other restaurant that makes that.  And actually, we were all mooching off of each others' dishes, so I can't remember everything I ate!  All I know is that I would go to Red 8 again- not too often, but if there's a small occasion to celebrate.

I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the food.  Noodles Restaurant and other casual dining restaurants that are similar to Red 8 deliver much better in terms of food.  I can't fault the service- it was flawless.  They were vibrant and worth going back just for to see them again.

I was there in December 2016. I went for lunch alone while hubby was working. 

I had dim sum. As a vegan it was so much fun to have choices. The waiter I had was an older gentleman and he truly brought me back to last trip to China. This was heavenly. I also had a nice tea with my dim sum. It was very laid back and took my time to enjoy my meal. The food was very very good. The server was very kind and he was very patient with other diners! I can't judge the price because as a Vegan this kind of options are rare so for me it was a lunch that was more than what I would usually choose money wise, but the level of the quality and presentation and taste was a real gem. In the end, it cost me around $40. But it was such a nice experience that I felt that it was worth it. Not every day, but surely every time I am in Vegas, I will go to have a lunch at Red 8.",0KZGlSaLNpS5HVy03uGvVw,0,0,5,ud6vSwlySBoMr4T1AfDp9A

Was hoping to be wowed by the food because it's a Wynn restaurant with Wynn prices but apparently they're not above fleecing people with marginally average food for exorbitant prices like all the other joints on the strip (*sigh*). 

The Hong Kong seafood was just ok. The crispy noodles did not stand a fighting chance against the gelatinous sauce covering a very dull trio of seafood. The flavorless calamari was oddly cut in big slabs. Bland scallops and slightly less indifferent shrimp made up the remaining medley which after about 10 minutes became a congealed soggy unappetizing mess. 

My friend had the Mongolian beef which she rated a solid 3 stars. 

Chinese broccoli in sautéed garlic was delicious.

My husband and I always love to order their Roasted Duck. Their duck meat is tender and they also provide sweet dipping sauce to complement the taste. You can easily finish the plate between two people. One of their signature dishes is Baby Bok Choy covered in Scallop Sauce. In real life, I do not like to eat scallop. But for some reason, their special scallop sauce brings out the best flavor in baby bok choy. It was so delicious that we finished the entire plate. I also like to order their Rice Congee with Pork and Preserved Egg. They serve it in a huge bowl, and it's enough for several servings. 
My husband also ordered noodles from their special noodle menu. You can pick the noodle of your choice as well as the meat. He picked egg noodle with chicken and mushroom. It was very filling and delicious from what he told me.

For a restaurant inside of the Wynn Hotel, I expected quality and standards to be fairly up there. Unfortunately, it didn't meet that expectation.

The decor is a nice Chinese style feel with a hint of high-end elegance and a splash of modern attitude.

Staff was very friendly and attentive. Everywhere you looked, you were sure to spot a staff member ready to help you. Not sure what happened, but this changed as soon as the food was delivered. 

Once we got our food, it was almost impossible to find a staff member. Once we finally got one, I asked for some condiments (chili oil, soy sauce, etc). After 10 mins, I still didn't get any condiments. It took so long that my food got cold. I had to be that loud/rude customer and call out to a staff member that I requested certain stuff and that my food is now cold. I demanded that they take my food back, cook up another order and not reheat it, and provide me with the condiments I initially requested. They took the food back, delivered the hot chili oil (still didn't give us soy sauce), and 8 mins later, delivered a new HOT order of my dish.

Though they did make up for their mess up, the fact that everyone else was now just sitting around & waiting for me to finish was a bit annoying. Luckily, for them, my wife enjoyed her food... aside from not getting the soy sauce she wanted.

We ordered the following:
1) Fried rice - pretty good, but a bit bland. (Soy sauce advised)
2) Har gow - my wife loved it. Flavorful and 
3) Dan Dan Noodles - Not really traditional.  Pretty tasty, but not as spicy as I'm used to. If you do order this, I suggest getting a side of hot chili oil and adding it to your taste. Just hope they get it to you before the noodles get cold.
4) Wonton Noodle Soup - This is probably the closest to flavor I'm familiar with. If you've had good wonton noodle soup else where, this will be very familiar to you too.

Overall, the food was okay. Not any better than any other chinese restaurant. If it wasn't for the fact that serving staff practically forgot us and my food got cold, it would've been an okay experience. Because I had to send back my order and wait twice as long to eat, this just made the whole experience simply bad.

I had been craving some sort of Asian Cuisine after a drunken night at one of the clubs and  I passed a Chinese restaurant on the cab ride back to the hotel.  They had a nice drink selection...I wound up order a pineapple mojito!  Sounds weird to have a Cuban drink at an Asian restaurant.   We ordered two entrees and two appetizers and shared them between three people.  The shrimp won tons were the best!  Definitely check it out while you are in Vegas!

2717736,2018-06-06,4,6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q,"Pretty frustrated. I'm sitting in the restaurant writing this review. I was excited to have some GOOD or above average Asian cuisine. I should have also looked at Yelp prior. Both didn't happen. 

I am staying as a guest in the Wynn and have many times before. I wanted to grab a quick late lunch prior to going out and eating at SW later. So that's two places I'm deciding to spend my money out of the hundreds and thousands of places to go on the strip. 

I got the crab rangoons, lettuce wraps, and Mongolian beef and a drink. First of all, the crab rangoons were actually good. No issues there. The Mongolian beef was ok and good spice level. PF Changs has better lettuce wraps and bigger portions than Red 8. I also waited over 8 minutes for water refill and had to flag down a waiter to get me it. I was checked up on one time and almost just left alone my entire visit. There were 3 people standing by the walls and staring at everyone, but must have forgot me. Service and lack of food taste/quality for price is the main reason for the low rating. 

I'm pretty annoyed that 2 appetizers, an entree and one drink came to $71 for mediocre food. Overpriced food that doesn't satisfy my is my biggest pet peeve especially that I have thousands of choices. I wasn't raving when I left. I absolutely love the Wynn, it is my favorite hotel in all of LV, but Red 8 missed the mark for me.

There were also gnats and a few flies that came by our table which is interesting since it's tucked away and I never see any of that throughout the rest of the casino.

Honestly, the food is pretty tasty. I got the clay pot with chicken, salted fish, minced pork, and tofu with rice. It had good flavoring to it and the tofu was quite silky. Costed me about $16. Not ridiculous, I'll admit. My husband ordered Dumpling Noodle Soup and it was about $15. Nothing extraordinary.

The lou rou mein/beef noodle soup was very bland in comparison to a typical bowl I would get anywhere in Rowland Heights. I wasn't very impressed; the broth wasn't flavorful, the noodles' texture was very soft and not jelly-like, and the beef, thanks to the bland broth, tasted bland. 

The waiter was very friendly and boasted about the food to us as if he had succeeded in satisfying the ethical people of which the food he served originated from...but unfortunately the chef didn't.

The food stands out and is packed with flavor. The prices may seem steep for small portions, but the amount of meat and goodies they stuff into every dish is quite substantial and great quality. We had several dim sum items, including Cantonese pot stickers (these are awesome!), shiu mai (huge and tasty), Shanghainese pork dumplings (yummy soup dumplings), prawn dumplings and BBQ pork buns (like a fluffy cloud filled with amazingness). We also shared the Kung Pao Shrimp, which did not disappoint one bit.

After a day of raisin-ing ourselves by the pool we were starving for some rice and noodles. Sure Chinatown was just an Uber away but this was right in our hotel so we decided to check it out. We immediately decided to get an order of Shanghai soup dumplings, pork bbq bao and pan fried shrimp bao as well as some crispy seafood egg noodles. As I mentioned, the dim sum came in very small portions with high price tags but it was totally worth it. The pork bao had the softest, fluffiest bun I've ever tasted and a perfect ratio of meat to dough. They actually had this dish at the Wynn buffet down the road, but it did not compare to the taste of this by miles. I had never had a pan fried bao before, but it was an amazingly crispy texture that just melted when it hit your mouth. 

I'd skip the soup dumplings but I loved how each one was presented in a tiny mini bamboo basket to minimize breakage (they left the wax paper on so be careful of that!). Egg noodles were delicious but no more delicious than what you would get at another good Chinese restaurant in anywhere, America.

The menu is on the pricy side but when you are vegan and it is after midnight in Vegas, options are slim so we gave it a try.

Steve Wynn is vegan so all of his restaurants in his hotels have vegan options on the menu.  Something that makes me say, hey Steve, I'm only going to stay in your hotels for the rest of my herbivore life.

We had the Pad Thai with tofu.  The dish was incredibly delicious and the tofu was cooked perfectly.  Believe it or not, tofu can sometimes be a challenge to cook without it being rubbery and there were two varieties of tofu in this dish.  My husband and I split an order and I was left wishing I wasn't sharing.  We also shared some dim sum appetizers which were unique and cooked to perfection.

What I like about Red 8 is you can expect each dish to be made with quality ingredients and prepared in a ""Grade A"" environment. I've been to dim sum places around town that make my tummy cringe in fear; however, at Red 8, these fears are gone. 

Wondering why the restaurant is named Red 8? Well, once you go there, you'll know why. From the red walls to the red place mats to the red roses, there's a lot of red going on. I'm sure there's a lot of Feng shui going on as well, as Steve Wynn opened Red 8 to cater specifically to the Asian clientele visiting the casino (I think I learned that from a Wynn video that plays on repeat on the room TVs). 

Our server was friendly and helpful in choosing the best dim sum to order:
Shrimp Har Gow- 4 pieces
Pork Dumplings- 3 pieces, The dumplings were bursting with flavor and juice
Steamed BBQ Pork Buns- Soft, pillowy buns filled with sweet BBQ pork

We also ordered two Red 8 Signature Dishes:
Combination Fried Rice- Shrimp, chicken, beef. 
A Pan-Fried Noodle Dish- Wide rice noodles and tender pieces of beef pan-fried in soya sauce

I enjoyed all the dim sum, especially when dipped in the vinegar and mustard. However, for the main dishes, I preferred the noodles over the fried rice.

It was very flavorful!

The large tables at the bench seating area as well as the large central tables require that people practically shout to reach each other. I did not appreciate being in the midst of such a noisy place. 
Staff were wonderful. Michael the waiter was superb!
I had the eggplant and pork (although they serve pork belly and have to explain that to you, it is not on the menu which I think is wrong) with cat's eye noodles. It was delicious. I would have preferred to have pork as stated on the menu though.
My husband enjoyed the Kung Pao shrimp very much.  He is a tough critic and stated it was one of the best meals ever.
We shared the chicken satays which were among the best I have had and the peanut sauce was texturally superb and seasoned perfectly.
I am not ever a fan of bench seating but although you are not totally on top of people next to you on the bench, you are so far away from your dining partner that it is very weird and not pleasing at all.

The broth was basically dish water. Zero depth of flavor.  I asked the waiter for more chili paste. I think he sensed my disappointment because he gave me like three tablespoons' worth. I used probably half of it to get any semblance of heat. So yeah, if you like really Americanized Chinese, maybe this place will work for you.",R4flrLR17toLlbBhy6IUCQ,0,0,2,4ZgOoS3GaH4BJk5hLHOc0g

Dim sum is the thing I missed the most since going vegan tbh. This places is amazing. It's quite pricey, but I'd rather throw my money down here and eat a bunch of vegan dim sum to satisfy my cravings, rather than a giant Vegas buffet where I can eat like 4 things. They use a lot of gardein ""meats"" as dumpling filler and also for their ""chicken"" wraps. Really delicious!

The best part is, this restaurant has awesome noodles soups too, so my meat-eating family can enjoy a meal with me in the same place! My dad, who is just about the most judgmental eater in the world, genuinely liked their beef brisket soup with egg noodles. He raved about how satisfied he was and then got the fresh mango sago for dessert (which he also gobbled up in record time). Mom loved the wonton soup with egg noodles, and my husband got the stir fried noodles with beef, which he cleaned the plate of.

Everyone at themselves silly because although the portions are HUGE, the food was so good and no one wanted to leave a noodle behind.

DRINKS: Two of our diners had a mojito and LOVED them - they even had bamboo sticks in them. Really cute. I turned the mocktail lemonade into a cocktail with gin and liked that pretty well, too. Great drink menu for a lunch stop.

Both dishes were so delicious. The Chow Mein does only have 4 shrimp but it's Vegas so that's expected. The Sweet and Sour Chicken is plentiful and so good. The soft drinks are $4.

Kung Pao Chicken- ok, really saucy and very few peanuts, chili oil was separating

THE ONLY really good thing I ate there were their fried turnip cakes with taro. these hold a wow factor that nothing else on the menu can bring!

We went up to the host and asked for a table for 2 and were so surprised to hear that it was a 20 minute wait. The hotel was so quiet and empty! We played a few slots to kill some time and when we went back only 15 minutes later, we were seated right away ... in a half empty restaurant!

It took awhile to get our order placed, waited some more for the food to come out, our waiter seemed to disappear when we wanted our check and we had to ask 2 different people before it finally came. It just didn't have the service I'd expect from a nicer hotel. And I really don't know what they were trying to prove with the wait-time when the restaurant was half empty.

Out of the 3, I would rank them the following in terms of authentic flavors and yumminess - 

1. Red 8 (yummiest)
2. Beijing 99 (delish)
3. Wazuzu (boo!)

I would rank them like this in terms of value

1. Beijing 99 (good selection of entrees and price range between $12-$19)
2. Red 8 (also good selection of entrees and prices between $12-$19)
3. Wazuzu (OVERPRICE ALERT!)

Overall, I would return to Red 8 and Beijing 99 for solid PF Chang-like food with PF Chang-like prices.  

The chicken stirfries at Red 8 hit the spot in the couple of dishes we ordered.  The sweet and sour pork packed a vinegary punch.  The portions are well-sized, and the wait staff was friendly.  Best of all, the entrees are mostly under $21.  That's great compared to other Vegas restaurants that have $40 entrees!

Other things on the menu that we liked - the wonton noodles, and the dim sum.

Mykl was our friendly waiter and delivered great service to us.  We had a couple bottles of sake which did not disappoint, ox tail soup, bok choy with scallop sauce, cold cucumbers and chicken and jelly fish.  

The ox tail soup was the best.  It was pretty simple with green onions floating around and a decent portion of oxtail.  The meat didn't fall off the bone though.  The baby bok choy was okay but the scallop sauce wasn't live with flavors.  The same went for the chicken and jellyfish.  This dish had light flavors to it but once again nothing exciting.  The chicken was soft and the jelly fish was fresh.  I didn't care for the cold cucumbers much.  I thought they would be more soy sauce and garlicky, but they had a ginger sweetness to them I didn't care for.  My bf liked them fine though.

After opening the menu, my eyes almost started bleeding. Combination fried rice $25?!? One plate of normal dim sum $6?! I know it's the Wynn but come on! At these prices we could've just ate at The Buffet and gotten a lot of similar quality food for less.

Since we already sat down and committed to the restaurant, we decided to stay and order. To minimize the damage, we ordered just 3 dim sum plates (cha shu bao, shanghai dumplings, and fried taro balls) and two dishes (broccoli beef and sesame chicken). Growing up in the bay area, I've had my fair share of good Chinese food, and let me tell you, this was not it. The cha shu bao (bbq pork buns) were soggy and the filling was an unidentifiable paste with a few bits of meat. The Shanghai dumplings had no soup in them. The broccoli beef was mediocre.

As a vegan, I was absolutely delighted to be dining at a Wynn restaurant, knowing there would absolutely be delicious food for me to eat.  I started with a soy Thai Iced Tea and I nearly lost my mind, it was so good.  I ordered two vegan dim sums, the white lotus and jade dumplings, at the waitress' suggestion.  I don't remember what's actually in them (spinach?  mushrooms?) but they were both fantastic.  For my main, I had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  It was okay, but a little boring!  We had some hot chili paste with the dumplings so I liberally spooned that over my food to give it some oomph.  Even boring tofu and mushrooms can still hit the spot, and I left quite full.

It was pan fried in like a tempura bredding but spicy like it sat with some jalapenos for a while. Great. I love seabass and this is some of the best I've had. The difference was night and day.

There was a long line outside but lots of empty tables inside; they just couldn't get their act together about bussing the tables!

This time, we got seated immediately and quickly got drink service.  Only four other tables were occupied, a couple of tables already had their dim sum order, so we figured it was good to get there at opening.  WRONG!  Even with more than 3 waiters and a few more men walking around in black tees - no idea what they were since they enjoyed chatting and laughing amongst themselves but not really seat or serve anyone.  At one point, the host was pouring water for guests!  Beats the hell out of me what the other five men and one woman staff were doing!

Our waiter, an Asian guy was good and did the best he could even though it looked like he was out of breath trying to get to every table on our side of the restaurant.  It's not a big restaurant.  They were just inefficient in service.  They sat a party of five at a square table for four and a party of three at a booth where no one actually say on the booth but just on three chairs around the booth.  Go figure!

Dim sum is the easiest way to get your food FAST.  That includes congee!  However, it was a slight wait and some of the food wasn't even warm!  It baffled and annoyed me.  What's worst then eating bad food is food that is not warm!!  The food is tasty but I expected more.

The meal was comped but seriously this place was horrible. Panda express would be an improvement over this place. The bill was 130 for one person for lunch. Of course i had leftovers to take to pops but I felt like he might feel as though I was trying to poison him. I ordered the cantonese pot stickers to start. You could do better in the frozen section at costco. Next up I opted for the upgraded beef dish which is served table side on a sizzling platter it was like pepper beef sirloin or something like that. Really boring dish no imagination. was funny when i was ordering the waiter suggests i upgrade even further to kobe beef,I said well you probably wont get the benefit if its covered in a sauce,he says I will,even though i had a 200 comp and would not have had to pay for it I didn't do it. I asked him how much would it cost ,he says let me look on the menu,after we look together he cant find it he estimates it to cost around 90 dollars,like i said it would have been comped but it seemed too egregious to me. Next I ordered the sweet and sour chicken,total crap again you could do much better at panda express or costco. And lastly I ordered a bbq pork and shrimp combo fried rice,this was the best dish of all and I suspect that it is served regularly at the CCDC on fried crap night. In conclusion im glad i had  the comp but i still had to tip for 20 bucks ,its not the servers fault so i always take care of them. The server was very nice actually.

For example, They no longer cook Xiao Long Bao in small foil. I also tried their pepper and salted seabass and it was heavenly. The crispy pork also taste really good and so was the duck.

In terms of food, the dishes were good but lacking any flavor to really set them apart from typical Westernized Chinese cuisine. The Mapo Tofu dish in particular could have used more heat and flavor, a flavor that I expected since the dish originates in my mom's hometown but didn't get. I did like the soft, tender texture of the beef dishes we ordered though, and the Malaysian Chicken Satay was excellent. The dim sum dishes we ordered were not anything extraordinary to me; I've definitely had better soup dumplings elsewhere.

But instead, my 'Classic dan dan noodles with pork' dish paled in comparison to the Beef Chow Mein or the Mongolian Beef that my friends ordered. My biggest complain about the classic dan dan noodles with pork is that there was no pork and that I had to mix my own sauces and seasoning. The black sauce that came with this dish was super salty so you have to be conservative while mixing it or else you'll end up with a dish that is bland yet overly salty.

We had the pork wonton appetizer which was good and spicy but not what I expected. They were pork dumplings and not fried. Menu was not very detailed about the appetizer. Had the orange beef and Kung Poa chicken. Both acceptable normal Chinese dishes with nothing great.

So if I'm going to pay $20 an entree, I might as well get some decent Chinese food.

The decor is Asian themed and pretty cool.  It's super convenient for those who are gambling or for those like me that are staying at the Wynn and don't want to wander off the resort to grab a meal.

Service was also pretty good for a Vegas restaurant.

The abalone congee was around $25, but the whole time I thought ""where is the abalone?""

The wonton noodles were good, but it didn't taste authentic Asian. It tasted quite Americanized, especially the soup base. Fail. As far as the dim sum goes, it was actually quite tasty -- yes, all of it. It was on the more expensive side, around $6-$12 per dim sum dish, which is actually quite expensive for dim sum.

The attention to detail in just about everything they do is equal to or better than anything you will find on the strip. Sadly, Red 8 is the single exception.

5806973,2007-06-22,0,6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q,"Red 8 is Wynn's informal Asian restaurant, open for lunch and dinner.  It serves a variety of Southeast Asian foods: Malaysian satays, Japanese noodles, Cantonese noodles and, on weekends, Hong Kong style dim sum.

Wynn Las Vegas has an array of excellent restaurants - all of them expensive.  Red 8 tries to fill a niche by providing good food at a modest price, relatively speaking.  Many dishes are in the $15 - $20 range, although there are a few luxury live seafood items that will set you back almost $100.

The breadth of the menu is surprising.  Among its offerings are Malaysian beef satays, Korean kim chee, Japanese udon noodles, Vietnamese pho, pad Thai, Indian mee goreng noodles, and Cantonese roast duck.  There's a single menu for lunch and dinner.

The restaurant is decorated in black, white and cream, with red accents.  Considering its location next to the casino, it's fairly quiet, with an informal feel.  There's a small communal table, but it doesn't seem very, well...communal.  I haven't noticed any conversations between strangers, and management doesn't help when it treats the table as overflow space when no other tables are available.

Service is a weak link at Red 8.  On my first visit, after I was finished eating, my server disappeared.  I waited for 15 minutes (actually a little bit longer than that, as I didn't check my watch right away), looking around for someone.  I finally managed to flag down a bus boy, and asked him to get my server.  She appeared a couple of minutes later, with no explanation.  On my second visit, service was better, but again there were some long waits.  On my third visit, I imitated a gentleman at a neighboring table who took a more direct approach: loudly hailing the server like a passing taxicab.  Crude, but effective.


** DIM SUM
Dim Sum is available for lunch on weekends.  There are no rolling carts; ordering is from a menu.  Each order comes as two or three pieces, so it would be more fun to order as a group, but ordering solo worked out OK.  It took a little while to prepare the food, but the wait wasn't too long.  I had:
*   Shrimp in bean curd rolls.  Like a flat, fried egg roll, it was filled with shrimp, what tasted like shrimp paste, and bits of carrot and some green vegetable.  A dipping bowl contained Worcestershire sauce.  If you like bean curd skin, it's a very tasty dish.
*   Deep fried taro dumplings.  Light and crispy outside, with soft (mashed?) taro inside, mixed with barbecue pork.  Very good+.
*   Sticky rice in lotus leaf.  A rectangle of soft, sticky rice, with small shrimp and barbecued pork, wrapped in a lotus leaf.
*   Thai ice tea.  Layered cream (?) on top of very sweet strong tea.  I liked it, but some people might have been turned off by the sweetness.


** REGULAR MEAL #1
This time, I decided to try something different:
*   Oriental green onion pancake.  Vaguely reminiscent of a quesadilla with scallions, but crispier.  Hoisin sauce was served as a condiment.  It didn't have much flavor; the hoisin sauce helped a little, but not much.
*   Indian mee goreng with shrimp.  Wok-fried noodles, with onion and shrimp, and bits of a very hot pepper.  The portion was very large, probably best shared.  I thought the flavor was good, and the noodles were firm, but it was mostly just a big plate of noodles.


** REGULAR MEAL #2
OK, maybe this doesn't exactly qualify as a regular meal.  However, I noticed a couple of interesting items on the menu, and was hooked.  What seemed so interesting?  Congee.  A thin rice porridge, it's felt to be a healthy dish, appropriate after one has been eating or drinking too well for a few days.  Kind of like thin oatmeal.  However, meat, chicken, fish, and other ingredients may be added to congee.  I chose to add pork and preserved egg.  The egg, sometimes called century egg or thousand year egg, is preserved in an alkaline solution.  Wikipedia has a good explanation. 

The verdict?  Not bad.  As expected, it was pretty bland, but it actually had a little texture.  The pork gave it some flavor, and the preserved egg was interesting.  I don't know if I'd order it again, but I'm glad I tried it once.

I had planned to try an unusual dessert - sweet potato porridge with sago - but the huge bowl of congee had filled me up.  Maybe next time.



Red 8 isn't bad, but it also isn't that good.  Perhaps its menu is too ambitious (""Jack of all trades, master of none"").  Perhaps I've been spoiled by all the excellent restaurants at Wynn.  In any case, I was hoping for better.  Nonetheless, it's convenient and not too expensive - and I don't know if there's any place better in this mid-range category.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,0,3,Ia2mg7J70FQ7M1nVILt5VQ

We had the Salt and Pepper Calamari, Stir-Fried Mixed with Chinese Vegetables, and Egg Noodles with Beef mixed with Soy Sauce.
