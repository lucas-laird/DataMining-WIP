Italian HOAGIE, what a disaster.... they use mini pepperoni slices (like Hormel, pre-sliced), some pre-sliced ham and salami and 2 pieces of cheese on a broken hoagie roll. Husband said the gyro tasted awful. The fries on the side were COLD, neither of us received an even luke-warm fry.... Awful sandwiches. Standard boneless wings. 
Delivery time: surprisingly fast, under 45 minutes. HOWEVER... that does not make up for their awful sandwiches. 
End Result: 95% of food thrown away, $40 wasted and Grand Italia menu smashed in trash can.",_IdZQRzNx1XnexTuQJV6ug,2,0,1,-UcRc4EQba5jHK_IhNF_Gg

I literally could not believe my eyes.  There was hardly ANY meat on the sandwich at all.  My fiancé said maybe they were having an off  night.  I was VERY disappointed, but we continue to order from them.  Last night my girlfriend and I both ordered a cold salami and cheese sandwich.  I don't even know where to begin with the disappointment of this experience.  We waited OVER an hour.  We had to call them, and I'm not sure if they forgot us or what happened.  Finally the food arrives.  There literally was ONE THIN LAYER of meat.  Exactly like the salami from Subway - PAPER THIN!  A pile of lettuce and no mayonnaise.  We could not believe our eyes.  I cannot believe a food establishment puts out food like this ON A CONSISTENT BASIS (sandwiches) and is not completely embarrassed.

The delivery took over an hour. Not to mention,  the delivery guy in the black Lexus wasn't friendly and had an attitude like WE were the ones who were late.

The pizza was wrong and the breadsticks were burnt.
I called the restaurant,  explained what was wrong with the order.

Because I offered to text them photos of the black bread we received!!

995498,2011-07-06,1,M5Nvx_jkTf56Ne7tuXgCLQ,"Hands down the worst meal I've had in over a year. Horrible frozen food re-heated and passed off as dinner. We ordered the spaghetti dinner special which included an appetizer, salad, spaghetti and meatballs, pop, bread, and 2 dessert orders. We had breaded mushrooms as an appetizer, these were about the same quality as something that you would buy and heat yourself in your microwave. The salad was just basic bag lettuce mix but tasted fine. The bread, oh the bread. This was when I started laughing out loud in my kitchen. The bread was a hot dog bun soaked in a garlic butter sludge and then put back together and heated. When I say hot dog bun I mean the kind you get at the store for like 50 cents a package. The spaghetti order was generous at probably a full pound of noodles. How ever they had been badly overcooked and then allowed to dry back out in parts. This was complimented by maybe a 1/4 cup of ""sauce"" which was just enough to color the noodles an odd orange color. The sauce tasted like ketchup that had a few tablespoons of dried oregono tossed into it. In fact that was the only real detectable flavor in the whole dish. 2 meatballs, total, accompanied our dinner. They were obviously frozen and both slightly smaller then a ping pong ball. Looked and tasted exactly like stouffers. We ordered zeppoli and a cannoli for dessert. The zeppoli consisted of maybe 20-25 globs of cold rock hard dough ranging in size from pea, to meatball sized. All were too hard to bite into and tasted like old oil. The cannoli was also cold and filled with what I believe was cream cheese icing from a can, mixed with some mini chicolate chips. I've never had a cannoli lose it's filling when turned sideways before. The 2-Liter of Coke we had was by far the best thing about this meal.

They have 12 lunch specials, everything from wings to eggplant parmigiana spaghetti at $6.95 - $7.95.

The portions were generous, had 12 large wings, fries, carrot and celery sticks and a drink for $6.95.

Ordered them medium, because sometimes hot wings, are too hot for me, The medium had no flavor and they were swimming in oil, the ranch dressing was good, you can also opt for bleu cheese.

I was underwhelmed with the wings, but I will give the italian a try and report back.

I ordered at lunch time, and they delivered fairly quickly

The salad was really nice, but the Ranch Dressing tasted like straight up mayo - very bland, no flavor. I ordered Chicken Parm, which came with ziti pasta. The portions were huge, but the sauce was lackluster. As the previous poster said, the garlic bread was a hot dog bun soaked in oil/butter.",Clj5WdwsjRRBvN5byPvdlA,1,0,2,8rJCGcmC0alhr7a2XdX1jA

The lunch specials ended at 3pm and we were there at 2pm. Then we tried to use there Yelp discount coupon and the lady was rude stating its there address but not there coupon. She said she was calling yelp to fix the issue. We asked her if she was going to honor the voupon and she said no again. I guess now I know why there was nobody in there restaurant.  Maybe the blonde lady working there should take the blue streak out of her hair and become more professional.  She was rude and deserved to be smacked. The owner should shut his doors and hire people with common courtesy.  I will eat Little Caesars before this can get my money,lsl_Le9iVqmt17IcRPEzGA,2,1,1,43i3EPsw1vnpVc4QJ4MC6w

Today the salad was just as good as expected. What made me finally write this review was the pizza we ordered. 

We called in a supreme pizza and when it arrived we were not happy with what we received. The pizza itself was soaking in grease and the cheese and toppings just slid off at the smallest touch. I've included a picture and hopefully you see what I mean.

They sell wings too but they're normally not something I'd recommend. Save your money and buy a large 5lb bag of Tyson buffalo wings. They're cheaper and even tastier.

3870357,2014-12-08,0,M5Nvx_jkTf56Ne7tuXgCLQ,"Have gotten food from here before. I remember their Philly cheesesteak being pretty good. I was laid up with a gout flare up, and was home with the kids. Needed to get some dinner. My wife had the credit card, and was at work all night, so she texted me the numbers so I could order, like we've done many times before. I called to see if they delivered to me. They did, so I placed my order. They told me there was a charge for delivery. No prob. Most places do charge for that. They told me it would be $1.00 to use a credit card. That's a little odd, but again, no prob. I was told my order was almost $40, and usual delivery time. Then they said I needed the card, and ID for the driver. I said I don't have the card, my wife has it. I was told the card needs to be present. There is no reason for that. I asked can't they just run the card. I was told the card had already been run, but they need to send the $ back to the bank. So the card already went through with no problem, but they still won't deliver the food. My wife called them, and even offered to fax a copy of the card and her ID, and they still wouldn't do it. She asked to talk to a manager, and surprise, surprise, there was no manager there. After reading some other reviews, that seems to be an ongoing trend. Lies. The owner may not always be there, but I'm sure that they wouldn't let that place run without someone in charge. Are you telling me that the inmates run the asylum? Doubt it. It's just probably a gutless person who doesn't know how to handle irritated people. So now I have no dinner, and $40 short on the credit card. Was told it will be reimbursed. I wonder how long that will take. If it awaits a manager's approval, I guess I will never get it. Do yourself a favor. Do not even bother with this place. I don't understand how this place is still in business after reading the other reviews. I should have read them first, then maybe I wouldn't be out $40 and have three hungry kids. Guess I have to hobble downstairs, and try to stand on a bad leg to make the kids dinner.

The first night we ordered bruschetta and chicken tortellini Alfredo.  Both were very tasty although I would have preferred the tortellini to be cooked a little longer and more sauce.

The second night we ordered a supreme pizza, half of it with pineapple (hubby's preference).  The pizza crust was NY style and really good.  Would definitely order this again.  We only got through half the pizza, their large was more than we expected.

Both times we were given delivery times of 45 minutes and they came WAY before that time.  Delivery guy was friendly on both occasions.

Only complaint we asked for Parmesan cheese and LOT'S of red pepper flake packages, they gave us one of each.. LOLOL  Hubby wasn't too happy about that one.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,3,1,3,RuoVvCSGcyal5PmL9jnepw

4381396,2012-04-13,0,M5Nvx_jkTf56Ne7tuXgCLQ,"TERRIBLE delivery driver. It's rather unfortunate too. The pizza was pretty good. I ordered a small with pepperoni and sausage and another Ranch Chicken and added bacon. In addition I got an order of mozzarella sticks and a couple sides of ranch dressing. In my opinion the price was a bit steep. But I was informed that the ranch was made daily, so I assumed that everything was fresh. I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. That's about average for my part of town. And hour and a half later I called back to inquire where my food was. The person who answered said any minute. Which turned out to be scary accurate, a few seconds after hanging up, there was a knock on my door. Unfortunately, the delivery driver showed without an entire pizza. Needless to say that this is unacceptable. I called the place back and told them the situation. They told me that they would remake the missing pizza and send it quickly. I reluctantly signed the receipt for my entire order (definitely no tip) and accepted my one pizza, cheese sticks and dressing. My room temperature pizza and Cheese sticks. Gotta say, not spectacular. But then again cold pizza is never anything special. So about another hour and 15 minutes later, the same delivery driver finally gets back. But with BOTH pizzas, so I scored a free pie. Not bad. But this guy hands me my food rather rudely, says here and runs off. In my opinion he's a complete idiot and should be fired immediately. The only reasons I MAY consider this place again is because the ranch dressing was very good. And when I finally got hot pizzas (nearly three hours after my original call)  it was pretty good. Definitely better than any chain place. Also the order taker sounded like he took genuine concern with my discontent. He offered me free dessert and to remake the missing pizza. So I felt that he cared. But the drivers piss poor attitude, lack of apologies and slow delivery time severely effected my experience.",sNN8w_aPSZv-E-KUoQpZug,1,0,2,bIBezAAeHA1DeU6J00vuxg

We called, placed our order with little to no issue. However, upon waiting for the order to be delivered, the driver called with concerns over the address. After clarifying the best we could (The driver has a very strong accent), we waited for our food, instructing him to call us if there were any other issues. After 15-20 minutes had passed (Mind you, the restaurant is within a few minutes of our apartment) we called the store itself. We asked if the driver had actually left, they told us they had. We expressed to them we were not going to pay for cold or soggy food (our order was Chicken fingers in sauce and Fries). We then went through an off and on phone conversation as they put us on hold to contact their driver, where they informed us he couldn't find the place, then he had been there and knocked with no answer (we had been listening intently for the door), he was at the gate to the complex, and eventually while on the phone conversation (the woman on the phone had polite and apologetic for the incident) he knocked on the door finally. By now it had been so long, we had informed the person on the phone we had no intention of paying for and/or accepting the food. They did offer us 20% off (or 3$) for the inconvenience. Once we opened the door, the Driver yelled at us, literally raising his hands (while still holding the food) in an aggressive manner, asking us why we didn't answer the door 15 minutes before hand when he says he had knocked. After a few moments of him harassing us, we closed the door. Finished our conversation with the representative from the store (who again apologized for the incident, and the drivers behavior).
