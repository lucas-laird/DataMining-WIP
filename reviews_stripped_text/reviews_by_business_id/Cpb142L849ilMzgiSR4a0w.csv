886,2015-06-04,3,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,The place is a sit down kind of restaurant . The menu is not very helpful and the food selection is limited. I am used to Filipino food places like Fiesta Filipina where you can come in and pick any food you want quickly because it's ready. I was disappointed to see that it was a sit down place. There is also a distinct smell to the place. I don't want to say it smells bad but it was noticeably present.,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw,4,0,1,gtKhCkG92ZBavVpjpIv4OQ

Got the box combo with the Lechon Kawali, the kawali wad perfectly crispy and NOT greasy at all. The dumpling was very tasty and a good size. I did not get the pickled cucumber (the menu stated, came w the box) but I did get a nice fresh salad. So that was ok. The eggplant was delicious, nice and soft. Didnt care for the veggie spring roll, only because, I dont like mushy veggies. They give a really big portion of rice, which is awesome, because I ate the rest of it with my sinigang. The sinigang was perfection... Tastes just like moms.

We ordered the garlic fries after seeing how yummy they looked in the pics online, loaded with garlic.  I arrive to find out that they do not have the soup I ordered.  instead I got a cup of ""chicken soup"", the only soup they had on hand today....simple broth with cabbage and chicken.  The soup was lukewarm, not hot, had about 3 small pieces of cabbage and a small piece of chicken...broth was ok but nothing spectacular.  The pancit is oily....I can't explain it any other way than it leaves an oily coat on tongue and lips, gross...and the chicken in the pancit tastes old.

1098558,2016-04-30,2,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,"Here's what I ordered:
Fried Bangus (milkfish) w/ eggplant -- $9.99
Pork/Chicken Bicol Express -- $9.99
Ginger and Green Ice Tea (free refills) -- $2.99

with tax my total was $24.84

The Fried Bangus was delicious -- actually better than when I buy it from Seafood City Supermarket (on Flamingo and Maryland) -- so the difference is this:
You can get a HUGE fish from SCS for $4-$10 depending on market price, but this place (Tina's) seasons their fish better and it is filleted -- whereas SCS is fried whole so you have to pick out all the bones... so, at Tina's, you're basically paying the extra $5 for a better seasoned, filleted fish... and it's wonderful

The Ginger and Green Tea (iced tea) comes in a little glass mug and it's tasty. It's $3, which is a turn-off... but when you compare it to the people paying $6 for a Boba... it's well worth it... super delicious and free refills... YUM!

I didn't 'need' the Pork/Chicken Bicol Express... I only ordered it for reviewing purposes. It was much greasier than I wanted... it's basically chopped up chicken and/or pork meat that has been simmered in coconut oil and topped with onions. I'm not too familiar with this dish, so maybe it's suppose to be swimming in grease (I wouldn't know)

The guy running the show is an older white gentleman... ask him about his time growing up and living in Seattle. Awesome and personable staff. Definitely will return for the bangus and ginger tea!

On one occasion, they actually served us lumpia that was hot on the outside but still frozen on the inside. The employee took it from our table and they just put it back in the oil to fry it again. We didn't end up eating it. They should've just refunded us for this. Their lumpia don't have the authentic Filipino flavor. Maybe they have been sitting in the freezer for too long. If I was to only leave a one-word review about this restaurant, that word would be: oily. All their dishes here are extremely oily. See the photos that I've uploaded. Their dinuguan is way too sour. I always end up having to add more than a dash of salt. Even their menudo is really oily. Their fried pork lechon is not very good at all. They're way too crunchy. Service here is average. Once they sit you, don't expect to be checked up on again until you're ready to pay. They also will not give you a table set up unless you ask for it.

They had stuff that I had heard of before....BUT when I talked to some co-workers they were ""yeah that's the stuff that we grew up on!""  So I know that this place is AUTHENTIC!  

I told the owner that I am not very familiar with Filipino Cuisine and she answered all my questions. . .well along with google. . .LOL  I was looking up items that looking at the pics to see if I would to eat it or not.  

I had the an appetizer. . .the name of which I forgot. . .=(  But it was a sampler with fish balls, 2 different types of lumpia and garlic fries.  The garlic fries were ok. . .they were fries but I could not really taste the garlic in it.  The fish balls were your normal run of the mill fish balls. . .now the lumpia. . .OMG. . .they were delicious!  Both types were crispy without being too oily.  I would definitely get the lumpia again. . .the other 2 items, I would pass on.  so for the Lumpia (5/5) for the other 2 . . (2.5/5)

I had the TFC with fried chicken and the lechon kawali the first time.  And the second visit, I had the TFC with Lechon Kawali and bangus.

The fried chicken was a little too done for me. . .but the parts that were not too done were juicy and moist. . .and the sauce was the da bomb!  It was the same sauce for the Lechon Kawali.  The lechon on the other hand was done to perfection!!  It was fried to a golden brown and the meat was juicy and tender but still had a bite to it.  The skin was crispy and crunchy and the layer of fat beneath the skin just melted!!!  It was SOOOOO FREAKING GOOD!  I had to get it my second visit even though I wanted to try something else.  oops!  =)  ASk for extra sauce. . .you won't regret it!  Chicken (3/5), Lechon Kawali (5/5)

The bangus was fried to perfection as well.  But I thought that it lacked flavor until I dipped it into the vinegar that she brought for the fish. . .the vinegar was the perfect counterpart for the fish.  It ehanced the juiciness and the flavor of the fish.  Perfect Combination! (4/5)

Also, get the halo halo. . .it has got to be one of the best that I have ever had!  (5/5)

Their broth is perfect, you want to keep scooping every last drop into your mouth because your tongue is looking for more of that perfect combo of salty/sour/tomato/ginger taste.

Also, the tastiest pinakbet I've had in a long time and I even make it at home (note to self- be a sleuth next time and get the recipe). My fiancé usually does not like diniguan, but he volunteered to eat some, and he actually liked it along with all the other food we've tried here so far.

As for the Sisig ala Bicol express was okay for me.  The presentation looks weird as you can see on the picture.  As for the Turon con Suman, I liked it. New experience for me.

Granted, the few times we've been here, there weren't many people dining in. But I can see how it would take a long time for food to be ready if they were busy. I mean, it is cooked to order. Nothing wrong with a little bit of a wait for that. 

Love their pork sisig here. It's crispy and not drenched in oil. Their meals are a little pricy compared to turo turo style meals, but you get what you pay for because your meal here is freshly made. 

I also liked their Chicken Curry and chicken adobo. I like how food is served when you're dining here too. Gives you that true Philippine dining vibe.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,3,2,5,o_DpJ3CY8-wmcZlcZMCCFA

The second time we ordered lumpia, oxtail kare kare, crispy Pata kare kare, combo meal with adobo and beef caldereta. The crispy Pata was not tender falling off the bone and really no taste. The oxtail kare kare was delicious, everything about it was right. The combo with adobo was all pork fat and the beef caldereta came out as pork which we also waited almost 45 min. It was also all fat, we told the server that it was pork and she said sorry but no attempt to change it. So my hubby didn't eat. 

After that experience it really shows that filipino restaurant will never be better than that. There's good intentions but never the best executions.

2639432,2015-08-16,23,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,"I grew up eating Filipino food and my best friend's Father made thee best Filipino home cooked meals. I would finish all my chores and homework then go plead with my Mom to let me spend a night at my best friend's place. I do miss waking up to the ever so savory aroma of Pork Adobo and Kaldereta. Something about the vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce mixture that makes your mouth water as you smell it. I would be sleep flying to the kitchen whenever I woke up to this. And so I ventured off to Tina's Filipino Cuisine to get my childhood fix.

This place is located on S. Jones Blvd. and W. Robindale Rd., behind the 76 gas station. I went during lunch hours and the place was packed. There was only one table available and I sat myself, because I'm gangster like that. Plus I stood in the middle of this place and I was tired of waiting to be seated. The server seemed overwhelmed and she was everywhere. When she finally noticed me seating at the table, she looked puzzled and asked me what I would like to drink. 

I ordered a Iced Ginger Tea, next time I'll try the Iced Green Tea instead. I had this love and hate with this drink. I can't even describe how it taste like. It taste off, but I kept drinking it. Strange I know.. even I was confused. 

I ordered their TFC Express, where you choose two items from a list of entrees. I chose their Pork Adobo and Pork Kaldereta. It also comes with rice and soup. The first time I came here I had their vegetable Sinigang. It reminded me so much of my best friend's Father's home cooking, I came back just because of that. Instead, I was served Egg Drop Soup this day. I was completely bummed. So bummed I asked the server if there was any Sinigang and she told me they didn't make any today. The server added it's different (soup) every day. Nooooooooooooooooooooo! I thought to myself.. If I wanted Egg Drop Soup I would've gone to a Chinese Restaurant, but if you specialize in Filipino Cuisine.. serve what makes Filipino Cuisine so special.. the Sinigang. Because honestly speaking, it's the highlight of the meal. 

I asked the server if there was any way to make the Sinigang to replace this Egg Drop Soup. She told me that she had to ask the owner and the owner came out to talk to me. Tina, the owner was so kind and accommodating that she didn't even hesitate on making me some. She said you want sinigang? Okay give me a few minutes, I'll make it for you right now. I guess she's the only one that can make this soup. Next thing I know, here comes my soup.. piping, steaming hot. Home cooking at its best. I was on cloud 10. 

Tina told me, next time call me ahead of time and I'll make it for you. I want my guests to be happy here. Easy going, personable, and boy oh boy can she cook! Her hospitality alone makes me come back. She's just the sweetest lady. Tina worked at Salo Salo for 11 years and then finally opened her own restaurant. Congrats to her in following her dreams. Love supporting local places!!! And thanks to Yelp for always providing the cuisine of choice I'm craving.

The bento like box was super cute and plentiful. The Pork Adobo was delicious, but on the salty side. I would ask next time to put no salt and adjust on your own. The pickled cucumber was a great help in taking away the saltiness. Each bite was refreshing. The Pork Kaldereta had white potatoes and carrots. This was perfectly cooked. Flavors all balanced together. I would definitely order this again. Such a great deal with the amount of food you're getting! I even took half of it home, since I was saving room for dessert ;)

For dessert, I had the Ube ice cream aka Purple Yam. It was like eating my favorite frosting from an ice cream cake. Not too sweet, but simply satisfying. It's a neutral flavor and I enjoyed every single bite of it. Even the little waffle stick was yummy! This dessert is drizzled with caramel all over the top. You're welcome ;)

The interior reminds me of being in Hawaii. Cool tone colors and bamboo designs. They have a Filipino soap opera playing every time I dine here. It gets so dramatic, I almost coughed up my food from laughing. And I thought Korean drama was overly dramatic.. watch Filipino soap opera here.. they are on a whole new other level. It's quite entertaining while enjoying some soulful, mouthwatering Filipino cuisine. 

They also sell other goodies at the counter cashier if you're curious to check it out. Can't wait to go back and try some breakfast items! Garlic rice... Yes please :D",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,46,35,5,cvLKw0YJMaHi1v0W-PRTFQ

I really like the $8 combos because you get to eat two different things, and it comes with a really good soup. You wouldn't think that broth could taste so delicious, but the broth here is like heaven! It is not the same broth every time either, the flavor changes! $8 is such a great price for homecooked Filipino meal.

Our favorites here are: 
Curry chicken - this is deliciously creamy and somewhat spicy; my husband's favorite
Crispy chicken - perfectly crispy

? Omg!!! I think they forgot a Knorr cube, salt, something. Flavorless is an understatement. The presentation was great until you ate it. I tried to drench it in the only hot sauce I had (Louisana) and it gave it a kick but was still horrible.

Filipinos are by nature, regionalistic.  They tend to be more comfortable with people they're familiar with.  Normal, but owning a business is a different story.  It would help if the owners and servers paid attention to all customers there and not just some of those they know.  No one came back to our table after the food was served to offer further service.  There was an American guy there who we assumed was an owner/partner?  He took our order and served it.  We told him we wanted lumpiang sariwa (with the wrapper), and he said they had it.  When it came, it was the fried variety, and was very greasy.  My brother ate it because he's from the Mid West and hardly tastes Filipino cuisine.  We also ordered Crispy Pata w/Kare Kare.  Conceptual but not really.  The Crispy Pata skin was crispy, but the meat was hard, not falling off the bone.  The Kare Kare part of it was just vegetables and peanut sauce on the side.  Again, my brother was happy for this since no options where he lives.  Servers should know the menu and be able to understand it.
We preferred not to say anything because it's not good to argue over food.  I live in Vegas.  Fortunately, there are a lot of other choices!!",gZBAENqjq7Lq6TwO5lcFZg,1,0,2,lVmqWp-n3lA9aU7KxqAmgQ

They also have $1 kebabs. The meet is skewered, you pick up which ones you want, then they cook it. We tried one liver and one tacino  

They ran out of calamansi :( so we had the melon and mango, both also yuuuummy

Favorite entree items so far have been the sisig a la Bicol express (pork sisig in coconut milk), tinapa fried rice, and crispy pata kare kare. They do have popular 2 item combos that conveniently come in bento boxes and are a great value for the variety and amount of food you get, but I prefer to get the family style dishes. Their drinks are delicious too, including the ginger iced tea (free refills!). Their desserts are inventive, including the deep fried halo halo which puts a great spin on the classic Filipino dish. I like the ""at home"" atmosphere of the space and is a go-to spot if I have Filipino relatives in town. I recently got their Lauka soup, similar to bulalo soup, and the strong ginger flavor is keeping me warm and comforted through my current sickness.

This little gem is located on the corner of Jones and Robindale. The inside was fairly small so it did have that ""turo turo"" feeling to it which was really comforting. I really liked the place because of that. There was a wait time which was expected in a Filipino restaurant. It was still not as bad as the wait time in DT's. Our server went from one table to another informing everyone why there was a delay or what caused the delay.  We truly appreciated their efforts in keeping their customers informed.

When our food came, we ravished it right away. We ordered the Balikbayan Box and the Kanto Box. It used to be a lunch special they now offer it for dinner. The lechon kawali that came with my Kanto Box was really one of the best I've had. The pork was crispy on the outside but the meat remained moist and juicy. Everything that came with it was pretty decent. I also ordered the Aligue fried rice. I have not had those since I was in college in the Philippines and man, it was so good! The portion was big enough for two people but I felt like I could finish the whole thing by myself! 

Also a few things you need to know, they do not offer fountain drinks here. And, even though there's a wait service, you are expected to go up to the counter to pay after your meal. Still, I would definitely come back to get me some more of those Aligue fried rice! Writing about it now made me so hungry about it already!

I feel a little like this restaurant was newly opened or is under construction since it's sort of plain both on the outside and on the inside. The tables and chairs are rather small, but can be pushed together to accommodate larger parties of people. There is a TV playing on a Filipino channel. Really, the interior design of the place reminds me of the interior of restaurants in Asia, as it places more emphasis on convenience and practicality rather than aesthetics. 

I ordered a two-item special with the Dinuguan and the Lechon Kawali for only $7.99 (not sure if it's just a lunch special). We waited for maybe 15 minutes. My food came out in what I swear looks like a bento box. It was delicious. I loved the sauce for the Lechon Kawali, and the Dinuguan was still hot and steaming. My Filipino bento box also came with rice and a small serving of vegetables. 5 stars for the food.

The service was good, although pretty casual. Our server checked up on us regularly, but somehow forgot our orders a couple of times and had to come back to ask for us to repeat it. In the end, the order turned out perfect, though, so no love was lost.

When I sat down, I noticed a lot of tiny ants crawling on the table... Ew. There were more than 20 - 30 of them so I had to switch the table.

3810801,2015-09-27,7,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,"Am not fond of going to Filipino ""eat-spots"" unless they're highly recommended by Pinoy friends who are as picky and hard to please as I am when it comes to home-cooked Pinoy grubs.  TFC, just recently opened, was recommended by one of them with high praises.  That prompted me to Yelp them and found the limited number of reviews to be somewhat credible.  Hence, my half an hour Saturday driving venture across the beltway with so much expectations.  High expectations, at that!

I waked in and sat myself down on a two-seater table right in front of the tv showing what was obviously a Filipino variety show, and was given a menu rightaway.  Considering the limited number of tables, the small eatery was somewhat busy with, unfortunately, only one lady waiting the tables and working the cash register at the same time.   I noticed 3 groups of Pinoy families enjoying their late Saturday lunch.  The wait staff was unbelievably slower than our endangered and protected desert tortoise.    

After agonizing over two Filipino variety shows, I was still neither offered water nor asked for my order.  I looked around and saw the wait staff serving desserts to the next table to my right, then she served the food to the family to my left.  I was hoping she would notice me but she was oblivious of my presence.  When the family to my right finished their desserts and was given their bills and the family to my left starting doggy-bagging their food, I was already down to my last ounce of patience as I've already waited almost 45 minutes waiting for my presence to be acknowledged.

Hungry, irritated but still keeping my composure, I stood up and approached the counter and nicely told another lady that I was so ready to order and that the wait staff obviously forgot about me.  Bless her heart, she dropped what she was doing and came over and asked for my order.  

Now, the food.  I showed the the lady a photo of one of their offerings from Yelp.  It turned out to be one of their lunch specials:  their version of bento-box special of Chicken Adobo, Lechon, rice and daikon/cucumber slices.   I also ordered a serving of (4)pork siomai.   The food was on my table in less than 5 minutes.  The lady who helped/served me turned out to be the owner/chef.   I was not given the  complimentary soup but I didn't bother asking.  I was too 'hangry (hungry/angry)"" to either ask or complain further.  

The chicken adobo was soupy and a bit overcooked (possibly by repetitive heating/over heating).  The meat was swimming and sadly drowning in its own watery sauce and I didn't get the usual vinegary-soy saucy-garlicky taste I am accustomed to.  The lechon suffered the same fate.  They were either deep fried more than once that it lost the crunchy skin/moist meat combination you would expect from a deep friend pork belly.  I didn't dare touch the side salad of daikon and cucumber.  They looked like they've been sitting for so long that they're turning darkish.  I ate 3 out of the 4 small bite size siomais.  I've had better siomai in a Chinese establishment.   I figured an order of ""halo halo"" would save the day so I ordered their regular halo halo.  For $5, it didn't fare any different from Red Ribbon's, or Jollibee's or Chow King's.  The dining experience was yet again another total letdown.  I should've not expected that much or too high.   Better yet, I should've not expected at all.  

I stayed there longer waiting to be served (acknowledged, actually)  than enjoying their food.  I finished eating in less than 20 minutes.  Didn't even bother washing down the food with the glass of water they provided me.

The bill was $17.24 and I paid $20.  I think I tipped too much for such a mediocre service.   There is something amiss  If a customer is ignored and stood up asking for a service.  Anyway, I  stood up and headed towards the door and left as quietly as possible and vowed never to return again...ever!  (Unless the Pinoy friends who recommended me TFC asked me to join them and foot the bill).",W9C7l46Me0iuzbio_0BhdQ,8,4,2,V3ojXzmJlBNN4UzKLjsmfg

Tina's is located on Jones and Robindale near a terribles gas station.  Every time I came I was able to get parking.  
As you walk in, It reminded me of a beach house that I stayed at in the Philippines.  It's a bit old school but It makes me feel like I'm back in PI.  They have different sized tables inside and you always get greeted by Aunty Tina herself.  You just choose a spot and she'll bring some waters and menus right over.  They serve lots of different foods varying from meat, seafood, soups, noodles, silogs, veggies, desserts, & even Filipino street foods. Prices range from $3-$15 (ala carte) and they also have cheap lunch deals and a buffet from 10-3. 

We ordered the bangus, sinigang baka (beef), and traditional sisig.  The last time I can we also got bbq sticks, kare kare, and I believe kawali.  It does also come with a pot of rice which I think is a good deal.  The food was a bit of a wait, but It was worth It. My favorite was the sinigang because It was sour just the way I like It.  The beef was tender and It even had a sipsip which is what I call the bone marrow. Yummy goodness!!! The sisig was good too but the taste was more like dinakdakan.  Aunty herself will always check up on you and have small talk.  She's the sweetest.  

Everything we bought ranged from $8-$10 per entree which is so cheap!!! We couldn't get any desserts because we were so full :( next time I do want to try some desserts.

4628206,2015-10-05,1,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,"I finally found the one Filipino restaurant that I absolutely love! I'm Filipino, born and bred. Over the years, I've developed an aversion to Filipino food because most of the Filipino restaurants in town serve food that is either too oily or greasy or too salty. Not Tina's. Tina's is different from all the Filipino restaurants I've ever eaten in here in Vegas. They serve Filipino food with a twist. I can't explain it.. I guess that twist is that their food is not overly salty or overly greasy, just the right amount of goodness. We came here tonight for my mom's birthday (there were 16 of us) and they accommodated us. Tina, the owner, remembered my sister from when she celebrated her 18th birthday at the restaurant that Tina used to work in. She took great care of our party and made sure everyone was happy. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place because not only do they serve great food, their service is also top-notch. It's kind of out of the way from where I live, but I wouldn't mind making the drive out here to eat Talonggong (eggplant with bagoong), siomai, sisig, crispy pata (with kare-kare), and everything else on the menu. Seriously, I didn't have anything from this place that I didn't like. We were a big party, so we ordered a lot of food. I ate every single dish that we ordered and was highly impressed. Mind you, I am not easily impressed. The best part is, Tina gave my mom a free dessert (Filipino banana split) and she even gave us plates to serve the birthday cake that we brought from outside. I rarely write reviews on the same day I eat in that restaurant, so this one is really something special. GO TRY IT, YOU WILL LIKE IT!",tXoJxIcIGlEPmcSs_v-Oog,0,0,5,crJI5A1olyJl94URmK9i6w
4658063,2016-08-03,2,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,"It's nice to have a great Filipino restaurant less than one mile from home. If I had done this review months ago, it would've been without question a five star review. The two item combo is an amazing deal and the Filipino food ranks up there with the best I've had in Vegas, if not the best.

However, my recent experience drops this place down one star. I didn't realize there was a brunch buffet on Saturday and Sunday, so I tried it out for the first time on Sunday. When I came in the place was packed and the wait was around 15 minutes for a table. The queue was a couple with a child, a middle aged man, then me. The place is small and Filipino people love to take their time talking and watching terrible shows on TFC, so who knows how long before the tables will turn over. I was already there, so I decided to wait it out and sit on the bench near the register. Probably about 20 minutes in, the couple swoop on a table that opens up, not waiting for it to be bused. Aggressive move, but I approve. A bit later a table opens up near the entrance. Coincidentally, a different Filipino couple comes through the door and sits at the open table before it's bused. WTF. The middle aged man brought it to the attention of the waitress that he has been waiting, but she got bailed out when another table near the front opened up and she sat him there. That leaves me. Waitress doesn't do anything with me, so I nicely brought it to the attention of the waitress. I had been waiting for about 20 minutes and the Filipino couple needs to get out. She realizes her mistake and her solution was gold. ""Do you want to share a table?"" She wanted me to share a table with the middle aged man who just got screwed minutes before. Are you shitting me?? I told her no. She doesn't kick out the Filipino couple and just buys time. Five minutes later another table opens up in the front and she seats me.

It wasn't something worth throwing a fit over because I just came from mass and wasn't in the mood to raise hell. Five minutes won't kill me. Nevertheless, it is something to take note of. Rather than solving a problem, they kicked the can down the road and left me hanging. When I go here on weekdays, the place isn't full and service is fine. On a busy Sunday, the service was extremely lacking and the restaurant had no control of the dining room. I was on my second plate of food before getting asked for a drink. If you're doing a brunch buffet that will result in higher capacities, then you need to staff your restaurant appropriately to account for it. I also overheard complaints from an adjacent table, in which a teenager was saying it had been over an hour since she ordered and still hadn't received her food yet. I don't know whether her complaints were truly valid, but I found it funny that she came to that conclusion by looking at her Snapchat story for a timestamp. Snapchat wins again. As for the food, the brunch buffet was mediocre. Nanay Gloria has more options and the food quality was similar.

I'll still come here for the two item combo and probably pass on the brunch buffet going forward. Minus one star for my brunch buffet experience. Solid four stars.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,1,0,4,mI7KEgEgkrY3Fjv7JqvyxQ

I think their egg rolls are the best in town. I kid you not, it's pretty phenomenal. It's so crispy and good and bad and you get where I'm going with this, it's that good. Bad as in im sure fried stuff is not good for you. Lol. 

The longsilog is my next favorite item on their menu. Ask them to ""tosta"", which just means fry it more, the longganisa & its fricken amazing. 

The fried bangus was okay. Probably wouldn't order it again, personally. 

The sago at gulaman drink was really good! I wish some of the gulaman was a little smoother, idk how to describe it. Lol

When we walked in there was two other tables, both were finished eating. The waitress took about 5 minutes to come out from the kitchen and finally greet us. 

As a waitress myself, I know the importance of serving tables the order they come in. A table came in after us and the waitress immediately took their order although we were more than ready to order. 

I brought my aunt, uncle and mom and they were excited to order all the Baboy Entrees. They enjoyed the food, said it was decent. But it was not fresh and already cold by the time it came out to us. I was disappointed that the only thing I ordered/wanted to eat was the sinigang and because we waited for our food for so long was already cold.

Just be prepared to wait like 20-30 minutes for food to come to the table. That is the key factor though in why I like coming here: food is made to order! I absolutely despise other Filipino restaurants that serve their food cafeteria style.  

For about $8, the TFC express offers you 2 choices for entree, rice, salad, and soup. Honorable mention with the soup: I love their sinigang, which is a tamarind based soup that is known for it's sour flavor. With the vegetables and tender pork, it is perfection! I always go with lechon kawali, which is deep fried pork belly. This is something I do not eat at home, and consider it a treat to have when eating out or at Filipino parties. The brown dipping sauce that accompanies it is crack! I wish they kept this as a condiment on the table. The second entree I get usually varies. The chicken curry is good and so is the pork adobo. When I'm in the mood for fish, get the fried bangus and make sure you eat it with vinegar. 

The lumpia shanghai, the fried pork egg rolls, are good here too! They are made and prepared the way they should be with good meat ratio and fried to golden brown. So basic, but other places skimp on the meat and some burn the darn egg roll. 

My favorite drink here is the ginger iced tea! It really is all that. You have to like ginger in order to like this drink. It was another plus for it to be refillable. 

The service is unbeatable. One lady is single handedly a server, busser, and cashier. She is so nice and very efficient!

This has got to be the best, home-style Filipino cooking I've had from a restaurant, in a very long time!!! Each and every single dish are so different from each other. Unlike other places I've been to, it taste like they cooked all dishes in the same pot. You can totally tell that each and every single dish is individually prepared with care and precise seasoning. Undeniably homemade. Tina, the chef and owner, is extremely inventive, by fusing regional Filipino flavors in classic Filipino dishes, that makes it even more original. Like the Sisig a la Bicol Express, and Crispy Pata Kare-Kare, just to name a few. She is a culinary genius, she puts a lot of thought in her delicious creations, that makes me, and others, very happy! Daisy, our server, who welcomed and sat us, was very warm and inviting. Such a gracious and courteous staff, and the food is simply amazing! You don't have to take my word for it, but I do urge you to go. Try for yourself and see... Or better yet, taste and savor!!!

Sisig is great, i always order lumpia (fried) here. The only reason I can't give a 5 star is because of the many occasions we order here through the phone our orders seem to get lost, i'm pretty sure its not the language cos we speak tagalog. A couple of times I ordered through the phone and tried to pick it up they said they couldnt find the name, its not a big deal to wait but if I order through phone I at least expect to get the food on the pickup time we agreed on.

5517550,2015-10-11,0,Cpb142L849ilMzgiSR4a0w,"My family and I have gone here twice. Both times have been on a Saturday morning about 10ish. My son has his football games nearby so it's a convenient stop afterwards considering we live on the north side. Our food has always come out fresh, but that's most likely because we've come...in the morning. It wasn't busy so both times my family of 6 had no problem getting seated.  Upon entering, I usually make contact with a server or Tina herself then head towards a table ourselves so I know she has seen us, and knows where we are headed. I mean, it's not like the restaurant is super huge inside where a customer can be easily missed anyways. Merely my way of making sure there'd be no excuses should we sit then become neglected.

Hasn't been the case though.

Though I haven't tried it myself, my son and husband enjoys Tina's dinuguan. Both times it did not come out served as if twas sitting in a pot since the day before. The blood wasn't thick nor thin. It had an appealing consistency. Honestly, I'm going to skip on reviewing everything else because it may sound repetitive after reading everyone else's reviews. Some yelper I am. I will say...the pork bbq stick is deeeelisssssh. It's the best bbq stick I've had and I've been to a bunch of filipino restaurants. Sure when you look at the stick the meat may seem a little skim in comparison to other filipino establishments, buttttt...it isn't a stick of pork fat where you have to chew around looking for actual meat. The flavoring is on point and nothing like I've had. I think I said that all ready.

I will say this though...the two for $7.99 is actually a pretty decent deal. The soup it comes with does vary depending on day because our first time in we had sinigang, and today twas sopas (milky colored broth+macaroni elbows+meat+some array of veggies). It sounded like I was starting to type something serious when I started the paragraph off...but what I am about to type is serious--just wished the $7.99 deal actually came with more rice. I mean come on...it's common knowledge amongst us filipinos that our rice is technically theeeee main entree and everything else are just the sides. Lol. 

She has only been open since May. Give her some time to get used to serving and all that jazz which comes with a new establishment. Both times she made me feel like she was an aunty or something. I don't mind that type of service at all. It's very welcoming and comforting.

Would I personally come here again? 
Personally...we have and we will.

Oh, and leave the strollers IN the trunk as there may not be enough moving room to accomodate it incase it's a full-house. Safety first!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,0,0,4,zeMayF2fGmF_EmK2jmbEIw
