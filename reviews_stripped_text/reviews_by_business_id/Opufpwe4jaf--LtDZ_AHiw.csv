Located across from UNLV (next to Roberto's and behind the 7-Eleven), it's a great new option for students on campus or nearby residents for a place to eat. As a senior at UNLV, I was becoming tired and bored of the same food options and am glad to see a new place that offers some variety. Chipotle and Cafe Rio are in the plazas next to this plaza, but this is definitely a place I recommend people to check out if they want some Hispanic-influenced foods. They have different things on the menu.

 When I went there, there were no customers but soon after I ordered I saw 3-4 people walk in. This guy does everything by himself and he makes the food fresh! Yes -- *FRESH*! This even includes the fresh waters and the smoothie. 

The only thing you have to keep in mind is that because there is only one person working, you may have to wait in line if there is one. However, the owner is extremely nice and you can tell he is a genuine and hard-working guy! He personally told my boyfriend and me that he has no time to advertise because he spends his entire day working at this store. He hands out free food for the homeless people nearby so they will pass out flyers.",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,4,4,5,78zyxFMwyK2kkHtT5Kpg7Q
