81958,2017-08-07,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,Overpriced. Tiny portions. I have never wrote a review but this place was a huge disappointment. I thought since this restaurant had Wolfgang pucks name on the sign I was going experience something special. I felt like I paid a premium for a fancy name on the building and was scammed with mediocre food and high bill. Wolfgang Puck should be ashamed to have his name on this restaurant. The name has lost value with my dinning experience here. If you dine here don't expect anything better then mediocre food with a dive bar dining experience at a high cost.,IhwH_mJ-E0vVpLFG8leZvg,0,0,1,6BASbxO9Y7uoz2V-RFrcZw

Both were good with fresh tasting pasta and good sauces. The serving sizes are large enough you won't leave starving but will not stuff you. For dessert we shared an apple pastry.

352464,2014-12-29,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"My husband and I went for lunch today (Sunday at 1:00) to celebrate his birthday and our wedding anniversary.  We waited close to an hour for our food, and in spite of apologies from the waiter, and the excuse that my husbands chicken didn't ""look right"" and they had to prepare a fresh one, no attempt was made to offer an appetizer or even some bread to hold us over.  The place was packed with staff, yet our waters went empty until we asked for refills.  My husbands 1/2 chicken finally arrived, and for $20.00 I don't think it would kill them to put a few vegetables on the plate.  It was a scrawny (free range apparently) semi dry chicken with three sprigs of dried out rosemary sticking out of it.  The side of mac a cheese (that we had to pay extra for) was also dried out.  My wild mushroom pasta was good.  Lots of mushrooms and al dente, so that might have been worth the $18.00, but for the prices they charge, vegetables, potatoes, a salad, or rice should come with the entrée, and if they're going to take an hour to give people their food, some bread would prevent patrons from knawing off a table leg.  The atmosphere was active and noisy, so the ""edgy"" music they played was just more noise that wasn't needed.  This particular Pucks is new and in the heart of downtown Summerlin Las Vegas.  This is an upscale area where restaurants are frequented by mostly locals.  We have countless wonderful restaurants at our fingertips, with ambiance, good service, decent portions, and tasty, reasonably priced menu items.  It appears to us that Wolfgang Pucks is counting on the name to carry the restaurant, and the overpriced, stingy portions and bad service will be overlooked.  That might fly on the strip, but it won't fly with the locals.  We will not be back.",0rdWqhwq8iyV3pjzfDxhyQ,0,0,1,_QuX1XwrKkNVSB62yHy4fA
379343,2016-05-11,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"BEST KEPT SECRET IN SOUTHERN NEVADA!  As i write this review, i'm torn!  On the one hand, i have been enjoying this spectacular dining experience for weeks, practically by myself and i love it!  I WANT TO KEEP THE SECRET!  On the other hand, i owe the dining public, who appreciate fantastic food opportunities, the opportunity to share in this wonderful dining experience.  I would NOT want anyone to hold out on me, after all.  
If you are fortunate enough to get a spot at Wolfgang Puck's table at this location (this is the brainchild of David Robins) [HINT:  make a reservation] you will be treated to a three course special meal, totally at the discretion of the Chef for $25 including a glass of WP wine plus tip!  On top of this, on the second Tuesday of every month this location offers (generous) free samples of spectacular wine from around the world to all diners in the restaurant plus they bring in an amazing singer with a vast repertoire on those Tuesdays.  
So what do you get for that meager fare - $25?  First they start your off with an amuse bouche - i have had a crab cake, a tomato shooter, tomato basil soup, the whole gambit. Then you get what the Italians would call a secondo piatti, i have had pappardella with a meat sauce that was sublime -- among many others.  Then the ""peaches of resistance,"" comes -- Chef Chris likes to bring this dish out personally in a tajine for the element of surprise -- the three most memorable dishes were two fish dishes, one salmon and another bass and the most amazing was shrimp on a skewer in a curry coconut sauce -- it was so beautiful. They take a real farm-to-table approach with their food -- everything is fresh and tasty and cooked to perfection.  For dessert lovers, they have the most amazing pastry chef that makes some of the best -- homemade chocolate pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the most amazing white chocolate cake with raspberry sorbet!  Again, i hesitate to share this because i ALWAYS WANT my spot at the table.  However, i would be derelict in my duties as a foodie if i did not tell a few others about this amazing feast for a small price for some of the best food in Las Vegas.  You owe it to yourself to treat yourself to this amazing opportunity soon -- i don't know how long this will last, but while it does -- Go FOR IT!
PS they also do the most amazing ribs on the weekend that are, as they say, ""to die for.""",s-tYluswb2xphRwdctOTvA,1,0,5,9mequMVVrIBYjJny1rlhBA

Within five minutes, sirens started going off. Flashing lights, klaxons, and a loudspeaker that told us to evacuate the building.  The waiter came to our table, and told us not to worry, they were just testing out the emergency response system. After he left, the loudspeaker again told us to a evacuate the building. It repeated this message at least 40 times.  He said they had to do this because it was a new building.  The alarm was very loud and lasted through the majority of our dining room visit..  

We were given only a feeble apology.  We were never offered a complimentary drink, a complementary appetizer, or a complimentary dessert.

890484,2017-07-27,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"Decent food, but nothing awesome. Overpriced in my opinion. The menu is extremely limited -- out of perhaps 10 entrees, three were Italian. Not really a bar and grill. I had the chicken Calabrese ($25) -- two pieces of chicken with a few cherry tomatoes, a couple of tiny grilled onions and peppers in a nice sauce. That was it -- it would've killed them to pipe a few mashed potatoes around the edge? Something more than just chicken in a pan? My friend had fish and chips ($21). Fish was 6-7 smallish pieces, nicely done and the steak fries were yummy.

The service is definitely lacking. We had to ask for the malt vinegar, we had to ask for water refills, and nobody ever came by to say ""is everything all right?"" This place is definitely bare bones. No bread basket, the entrees don't come with even a basic salad, and there is no salt and pepper on the table. That always irks me as in ""the chef knows what he's doing and if you can't appreciate the subtlety of his expertise, you shouldn't be eating here. There's a Denny's down the street, you peasant.""

He recommended the old fashioned, i like old fashioned's and enjoyed the flavor of their version. A little bit on the sweeter side, but a great way to introduce a girl to the classic bourbon drink.

Short rib was super tender, very tasty and the mashed potato was wonderfully seasoned.
I didn't try my friend's chicken, but they said it was very good, not dry. Just noce and juicy. My rigatoni pasta was a little undercooked, was a little salty, but with a little bit of the cheese, it cuts the saltyness. One little downside didn't hurt my experience at all.

My boyfriend and I come every other week and so - sometimes we sit at the kitchen table, there is really great energy watching the chef and cooks making the food and bantering back and forth. Overall the food is amazing- the Chinese chicken salad and Prosciutto Pizza are ""MUST HAVE"" dishes. I would also add the Truffle Potato chips are to die for, but an infrequent guilty pleasure. My boyfriend and I got seated with the server James our first time and really such a nice guy and great service... we request him every time and we started picking up his historical mantra ""I'm killing it"" around the house. Automatically when we come in he knows what we want or will suggest good specials. One night my boyfriend and I came to Wolfgang feeling kinda down from a long day and we left feeling uplifted with huge smiles on our faces, thanks to James!

1479665,2015-06-14,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"It is nice to have a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in Downtown Summerlin! I have a couple favorites on Wolfgang's menu that had me driving to the strip locations for years.

This restaurant has an nice contemporary but cabin feel with their large wooden doors, wood interior, brown placemats and hand blown water glasses. This is an upscale indoor/outdoor dining restaurant with room for social events. But, you don't want to be sitting in the seating adjacent to the social event room during an event. It has sliders that do not buffer the noise. Trust me, I know.

Since they opened, I have probably patronized the restaurant five-six times as recently as yesterday for lunch. My favorite salad is Wolfgang's classic Chinois salad. Recently, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has reverted to calling it simply the Chinese Chicken Salad. Apparently, the word ""Chinois"" was too complicated to say for our diverse population. My teenage son really enjoys having the mesquite-grilled burger with fries. He says the meat is juicy and flavorful while the bun doesn't get soggy during the meal. I usually steal some of his delicious fries - they are super good.

One thing that set's this restaurant aside besides the atmosphere is the creative extra touches. I really enjoy having iced tea at this restaurant because of the flavor and cool iced tea cubes instead of just ice chips or ice cubes. Also, the menu is not overwhelming and changes by the month/season. They use fresh vegetables and fruits from the local Summerlin Farmer's Market wherever possible. 

My only disappointment would be the fresh blackberry cobbler. Although it has a great flavor, it is too thin and the crust is more like a crumb topping. If you like vanilla ice-cream on your cobbler, it quickly overwhelms the portion of cobbler.  I have had some amazing cobblers over the years - even by Wolfgang and this was not the one!

The customer service has always been awesome, and I do enjoy this restaurant. I look forward to tasting more creations at this location in the upcoming months and years.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,1,0,4,wK8qCCO3Dkt0EkPJyQsP5g

Cut, however, is one of my favorite places in Vegas so I was willing to give this place a chance, and it delivered. 

First, i would suggest a reservation as its usually pretty busy. In fact before I got in I tried to make a res on 2-3 other nights and they were fully booked. I think that has died down a bit now that its been open for a while but its still pretty busy.

Second, I thought the service was great. One small example- as a manly man I am not a big fan of ""splitting"" entrees, there are few things more emasculating than admitting to a server you can't finish the arugula Caesar salad on your own. When I went here I got talked into splitting Steak Frites with someone and as embarrassing as that could have been they brought it already divided on 2 separate plates and gave each of us a monster portion of fries that allowed me to leave with some small semblance of my dignity in tact. Its the little things. The steak was good, but the fries were amazing- I know I know how good could regular fries be? Turns out pretty good. 

Third, Location- its past the movie theater and close to CREAM. There isn't a lot of parking immediately around it though. Having never been to downtown Summerlin I asked a few people for directions and they were all pretty inaccurate. 

If I HAD to come up with a criticism I would say that the App section is a little lackluster.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,15,10,5,fS5jCPqjyEb84G3jjxbRBg

2206274,2015-05-30,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"This is a happy hour review. 

The Skinny: overpriced portions for happy hour review and with the exception of the calamari wouldn't order anything else again(3), service: pretty good in the bar area (4), value: pass -  there are better places to spend your hard earned cash (3).

After purchasing some Wolfgang Puck gift cards from Costco (protip: $100 gift card for $79.99 - this is an online deal only), we still had some money leftover from a visit to Spago. So we decided to hit this place for happy hour and use up the rest of it. 

The happy hour food menu consists of truffled potato chips with Maytag blue cheese fondue, cheese plate,  charcuterie plate, chicken wings,  fried calamari,  meatballs,  and pork tacos -  each dish is priced at $6.

We placed an order for the chicken wings, the calamari,  the meatballs, and the pork tacos. The hubs raised an eyebrow but I told him I didn't think the portion sizes were going to be big. 

Boy was I right! We spent $24 on 2 small meatballs, 4 chicken wings, 2 bite sized tacos and calamari that I could probably fit in 1 cupped hand.

But are the prices worth it? The magic 8 ball says no. 

The meatballs were okay but the marinara was overly sweet. The pork tacos didn't have that robust porkiness and was relatively bland even with the salsa. The chicken wings were nothing no to write home about and the mild Asian hot sauce didn't really distinguish itself in any particular way. 

The best thing was by far the calamari. The batter was perfect and light. We loved the green ginger flavored aioli it came with. 

Service was excellent with a full bar area and our water glasses were never empty. 

Given what we sampled today, I would be hard pressed to return. The portion sizes for the price/quality is pretty ridiculous. 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,1,3,ZoHSw1CjywbyBAF32nYJFQ

2249784,2018-03-25,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"The good - Bloody Mary was excellent, Desserts were very good, burgers good 

The bad - we had a group of 9 for a birthday event, reservations made 2 weekus prior to visit based on the menu that was online up until today.  Got down, sat and looked at the menu and it was pared down greatly.  All of us had looked at the menu in advance, knew what they were interested in and were disappointed that it wasn't available.   

Since we were 9, with gifts, it was difficult to choose to leave to go elsewhere although it was contemplated.   

Lots of what I had wanted was available at Happy Hour, but that wasn't until 3 and we were there at 1.  No notification of the change until we all sat down and looked at the menu.  Hmm they had my phone #...we picked the restaurant due to the diverse items on the menu...well that diversity was gone.   Waiter was good but stretched thin since he was also working outside.  Normally our group  has at least 2 or 3 beverages each, only had 1 due to inattentiveness to our party.  Took a long time to get the drinks, and, when ordering apps, had to ask for plates for sharing, had to ask for salt and pepper.  The caprese wasn't what was expected, which was ok but the tomatoes had the roots in it, too much radiccio in the Chinese chicken salad so it made it bitter tasting.   

We made them aware of our disappointment and the waiter tried to appease and was going to get the manager....he came back out, said we'll give you 20% off.  It was nice but still we didn't see the manager.  

Our brunch ended with 3 free desserts for our birthdays (there were 2 of us celebrating) which was a surprise and well received but again, no plates to share so it was truly 'family style'.   I almost didn't write this due to the desserts and no sign of the manager.  

We expected more in service and variety for the price we paid and were very disappointed.  With many places to choose from in Downtown Summerlin we wanted to try someplace new based on the menu that was published prior to today.   Sad, that they didn't think enough of a group of people, who made a reservation, to let them know of the drastic change.   And it was  interesting that it wasn't that busy when we were there but at 3 pm when the menu had the variety I was looking for - wings, chicken nachos, it got really busy.   

We will not be back....but do appreciate the discount and desserts and tipped the waiter based on the service not based on the management decision.   He tried, management should have presented themselves.  I wouldn't patronize this establishment again.  I was going to give it 2 stars due to the desserts and discount but a place with the Wolfgang Puck name should have done better.",nrl0l7OEOlTzzGcE9hgUJw,0,0,1,w42WNyUWIvsxLbQO2P-YRQ

I had the red sangria, which was good--a tiny bit too sweet--but not so sweet to stop me from drinking three of them over the course of dinner. My boyfriend and I split the calamari for an appetizer, and it was good. I don't remember it too specifically now, so it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had, but I remember thinking it was good at the time. 

For an entree, I had the spaghetti and meatballs. So good. So so so so tasty. The sauce was perfect and there was just the right amount to balance the flavor of the pasta and the meatballs. Two of our dinner companions also had pasta dishes, and they were part of the clean plate club that night. My boyfriend had steak frites.

It was my first time at his Bar & Grill concept restaurant. I have been to Spago and couple other ones. I have never had bad experience but times that just been ok. Bar & Grill fell under the ok. The potato chips with the blue cheese sauce or creamy goodies on top. Perfect combination! The only thing that would have stopped me from raving about it. The worst thing could do with potato chips thin sliced deep fried to order is getting lump of chips. Not individual nicely fried chips that take time drop them in the fryer or move it around rather then dump bunch in walk away. The combination solid. The Creamy Mac 'n' Cheese truffle crumbs. If there was one five star that stole the show was this dish. It not often rave about mac and cheese. I love love the fact that not super thick cheesy but nice creamy. You can taste the hint of truffle in the cheese and still has rich body from the cheese. The pasta not elbow variety but more Orecchiette style. Nice cause in each bite get full effect of sauce, pasta, and the truffle crumbs on top. Winnah. If I could order full size then appetizer I would be all over that pasta. 

I ordered the Orecchiette Pasta, Italian Sausage, Cherry Tomato, Broccolini, fine herbs for my entree.  It was ok. The sauce was more light butter/cream sauce. It liked. It had ample and equal amounts of everything else. I also tried the calamari. Nothing special just ordinary calamari. It was Ohana family dinner so tried piece of my brother entree the grilled flat iron steak. Nothing stood out about that dish for me. Overall really ok no WoW factor or something that would make me want come running back again. 

The service was awesome. The hostess that seated us, our waitress, and later management came checked make sure everything was good. All five star service without doubt for me. Friendly, attentive, and made the dining experience great one! 

The interior decor is interesting. It open kitchen, You have almost chefs bar counter area right in front that can sit down eat. It good spot if dining alone. They have bunch of televisions in the restaurant keep you update on sports. The bar area once walk in on your left like the set up. It one long counter but like the design.

We shared the homemade chips with blue cheese dip on visit numerous uno. They weren't great, the ""dip"" was more like old mayo in a bowl with a sprinkle of blue cheese.

This visit was worse, I ordered the chopped vegetable salad with chicken. In my opinion 22.00 for a small salad with carrots, celery and a few tomatoes is absurd.  The chicken didn't actually come on my salad, I had to ask for it showed up  third of the way into brunch.  My boyfriend ordered the wolf ""Mac"" muffin. Greasy, gross and child size. Also, comes with no sides so after adding avocado he paid 16.00 for a sandwich that he could have gotten at McDonald's for a dollar.

Service was not great, our waiter disappeared and we basically were shuffled through the rest of the servers.

My wife and I when Puck's first opened and enjoyed it enough that we've been back several times.  It definitely has a casual bar and grill feel, and they've set it up to make everyone comfortable regardless of dress.  We've seen jeans and t-shirts at one table, and business attire just a few tables away.  Even so, the fine dining quality found at other Wolfgang Puck's restaurants isn't lost here.  You're treated very well by the wait staff and the food is prepared and served in a manner that makes you think they're cooking just for you.

Recommendations:  if it's lunchtime, try one of the salads or the Italian Sausage or Roasted Vegetable pizza.  At dinner, come hungry and try any of the pastas to start followed by the Scottish Salmon or the Garlic and Herb Chicken.  Or if you're in a burger mood, the Mesquite Grilled Burger won't disappoint.  (I've had fish there twice now and both times it was perfectly cooked.)  Always be sure to ask about the daily specials too.

If you like Wolfgang Puck's, keep in mind they have a room for private dining as well.  You'll need to reserve it in advance.  They also cater.

With Downtown Summerlin being so accessible off the 215, drive over and enjoy a stroll through the shops.  When you're ready for a meal or just want to sit and enjoy a drink at the bar, consider Wolfgang Puck's.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,1,0,3,hqPSPt9-hVyT8rYMSD_wlQ

I seriously wanted to love this place so much. Everything was going so well, decor was gorgeous, appetizer was an amazing start, and attention to our drinks were on point. It was great until I received my pasta. The waiter set the dish in front of me and I'm thinking, wow this is going to be so good. My boyfriend stole the first bite of my pasta which is so typical of him. Anyways, he told me that the pasta was undercooked! I said no... This is Wolfgang's restaurant this can not happen. So I took a bite out of the pasta and you can definitely tell it was undercooked. It was basically raw in the middle. I know you probably think, ""Oh no, it's called al dente."" NO! It was freaking raw. So, I told my server that the pasta was underdone and she had the audacity to say oh no we definitely cook our pasta al dente. Homegirl! No that sh*t is not. She told me that they can definitely take it back and cook it a little bit more for me. Ughhh seriously don't treat me like I'm stupid and picky. I've eaten so much pasta in my lifetime to know what is al dente and rock hard. So my server takes the dish back and I see the cooks in the back looking smug and annoyed because they have to redo a dish. At this point I'm just over it. I tried liking this place but that little comment just annoyed so much that I can't even. Whatever. Food would have tasted a lot better if they cooked it right the first time.

From the moment we walked into the door, until the moment we left it was fantastic!
The service was impeccable, the food was fresh & delicious! My partner had home made past with Rabbit Ragu - YUM!! I had a rock shrimp pizza, which was a real pizza not a flatbread pizza ( Although I love FB Pizzas too) We started with the calamari.
It was a perfect lighter dinner before heading off to the movies on our date night!

What is perfect about this place is you, you could sit down with friends after a day of shopping at Downtown Summerlin and have a yummy selection of 'family style' snack foods for the table, or you could sit down for an amazing 3 course dining experience!

Here is my insider tip- During the colder months, if you make a reservation ask for inside. They did not seem to make a difference between indoor and out door dining with reservations, it is just where there is a an open table. We sat out side under a heater, which was fine for us. But was also watched another table of 4 leave because they could not accommodate their reservation inside even after they said they were cold and uncomfortable outside.

The happy hour cheese& charcuterie board is excellent and offers the perfect amount if you looking for a light bite. They offer a ""Sunday supper"" which is a prefix and that you pay(25$?) per person. However I feel your group size needs to be just the right size so the serving portions are evenly distributed. Because you want to try everything,  you're already stuffed by the 3rd course.

After being seated, we were quickly told by Lauren that no outside food was allowed. I let her know that we would not be eating the food (I and another member of our party had bagged, to-go orders with us from the restaurant we had previously dined at). Lauren said that it did not matter that we were not eating it because any outside food was against Wolfgang Puck's policies. She said, ""so, I could throw it away"" we, of course, decided to leave rather than allow her to throw our food away. We sat by an outside fire nearby the restaurant, and we continued our evening. To my dismay about 10 minutes later a white man and his friend entered the restaurant with bags of takeout...my friends and I watched in disbelief as the man took a seat by the bar, and began ordering drinks! At no time did anyone approach this man and his friend to let them know that outside food was not allowed. I decided to go speak with the restaurant manager about the unequal treatment my friends and I had received. Chelsea (the manager) and Lauren (the hostess) proceeded to pretend (unconvincingly) that they had not seen the man and his companion enter with bags of takeout. They then went on to lie and say that the man's food had been thrown away; the food was still sitting on the bar! When we let the two women know that the food was still on the bar, Chelsea and Lauren suddenly remembered that the restaurant offers patrons the option of placing outside food on the counter. This realization came as news to my friends and me because placing our food on a counter was not an option that was offered to us. Our options were to throw our food away or to leave. It is a shame that in 2016 there are establishments that continue to employ discriminatory policies in an effort to keep the patrons that they desire in and the patrons that they find less than desirable out! I should not have to say this, but my friends and I are all young, black professionals. We have more degrees among us than there were people in our group.

Service was prompt and friendly. There is a nice selection wines at a reasonable price point.
The starter plate chosen was grilled spanish octopus with greens, fingerling potatos and romesco sauce. The octopus was nice and tender but not over cooked. The romesco sauce worked well with the greens and potatos. The size of this dish was just right.
For the main event we choose the DTS chopped salad which large enough to be an entree. The salad had a variety of vegetables and varies by market availbility.

3251898,2015-07-27,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"Mixed review at dinner tonight.  I saw that they offered a Sunday Supper for $25 per person. I asked what the supper menu looked like and it sounded like something the family would like.  It's a great bargain with delicious food.  However portions don't work for  family.  I'd rather pay more and be satisfied.  Their Sunday supper is for a minimum of family of 4.  We have five in our family...which they charged for 5 but gave us  portions for 4.  

Apps:  Calamari, margharita pizza, and tomato & burrata salad.  All very tasty.  One small pizza for the table is basically one small slice per person.  Calamari was delicious, but again not enough for five people. 

Entree:  Rotisserie chicken, rigatoni pasta, and flat iron steak.  The steak was pre-sliced and ended up serving 1 small slice per person.  The small pasta dish was empty within minutes.  The chicken portion was healthy.

Sides:  Broccollini and Roasted Potatoes.  Good portions and tasty.

Dessert:  Red velvet cake and cherry cobbler.  Two regular dessert portions for five people.  My wife and I didn't even get a taste of the cake as we split it up for our kids.

Everything we had was delicious.  Portions were pretty ridiculously small.  

Our server was very sweet and we mentioned it to her.  She talked to the kitchen and brought out another serving of the pasta.  We also ordered another pizza for the table.  

It's a great value with good food.  Portions are way too small.  Mind you...we had two adults and three kids (14, 11, 6).   Five adults would be famished after this meal.   

I would rather pay $35 per person and have an adequate amount of food.

To add insult to injury, our server told me that my credit card was declined.  When I called Wells Fargo, they said that the restaurant tried to charge the card incorrectly so it triggered a fraud alert.

Very disappointed with dinner...despite the excellent flavors.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,3,0,3,eCEI4CrBCtBs7I8-u-IPtA

Bottomless mimosas last until 3pm and the menu includes classic brunch items like eggs and benedicts as well as burgers and pizzas. We came on a typical Sunday and sat outside.

Avocado toast came with just one piece of toast.  It was very good but could be made at home for sure; nothing spectacular. The Benedict was just the eggs and muffins, no potatoes as a side even, which was disappointing. Very tasty but small. The dish was great but a side is a necessity. 

All in all, the mimosa service was the best I've ever had. The glass was always full and the waiter didn't judge.  Unfortunately it was only orange juice in the mimosa, but I still enjoyed it.

From the decor to the service to the quality and taste of the food, everything far surpassed any expectations.

We started out with the grilled octopus, the tuna tartar and the beet salad.  The tuna tartar was exceptional.  I usually don't like beets but this salad may have changed my mind.  It was amazing!  I had a whiskey sour as a little treat and it was delicious - definitely not just something thrown together with sour mix (which I hate).

My friends ordered the Chinese Chicken salad and the burger - both of which they said were thoroughly satisfying and tasty.  I ordered the rigatoni with turkey sausage bolognese which may have changed my life.  It was easily one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.  I wanted to take a picture of it but I realized that I ate almost all of it by the time the thought even occurred to me.  Both of my friends were in complete agreement after trying a few (as many as they could steal) bites of my dish.

We decided to splurge and ordered a few desserts - chocolate lava cake, pineapple upside down cake, and creme brûlée.  We definitely went overboard but we were celebrating so we decided to just go for it.  Everything was amazing, not that we were surprised.  I don't even think we could pick a favorite, it was all so good.  They pair the pineapple upside down cake with pineapple sorbet which was such a delicious combo.

All in all, the meal was amazing.  We will definitely come back and may even plan another trip through vegas just so we can stop off here and eat until we are stuffed again.",-MPPIhmgA97jzmtOz5XaUw,0,0,5,47-29XRJ6_pMZa95YJX1Sw

3517683,2015-01-06,2,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"The menu may not be groundbreaking, but the execution has been excellent almost every visit. Add to that a dark, comfortable dining area with views into an open kitchen and you've got a spot that has gained much popularity since opening in the new Downtown Summerlin shopping district.

Like other Wolfgang spots around town, you'll find pizzas. The Asian BBQ chicken pizza ($14) lacked enough hoisin to give it a distinct Asian flavor, but the chicken, broccoli, chiles and cilantro still made it a satisfying dish. I preferred the potato leek pizza ($12) with its sweet garlic, goat cheese and guanciale toppings. The chewy crust on both showed an ample amount of char and blisters and delivered some great flavors.

There are a handful of pasta dishes on the menu. The hand-crafted rags of pasta that make up the garganelli ($15) were impressive. The turkey bolognese sauce added much savoriness while the basil whipped ricotta added a touch of sweetness.

Among entrees simplicity seems to be the concept behind every dish. The sea bass ($34) looks like a minimally plated dish but is expertly seasoned and roasted, sitting atop a gremolata and garlic spinach. Equally bare is a tender, lean grilled New York strip ($37) topped with an herb butter coating its well charred exterior and accompanied by a handful of skinny fries. Their mesquite grilled burger ($12) won't win any awards for originality, but it's a well crafted combination of aged cheddar, red onion marmalade, and bacon aioli atop a patty larger than the bun it's in.

For dessert the bread pudding ($9) and molten chocolate cake ($9) are tried and true dishes that will satisfy your need for a sugar fix. Their best option is a flaky and buttery apple crostada ($8) with caramel and vanilla gelato.

The familiar fare may not push culinary boundaries, but it should play well to the Summerlin crowd. There are plenty of dishes that are approachable yet elevated when compared to similar spots on this side of town. The ""something for everyone"" approach is great for local families and folks who don't consider themselves ""foodies"" yet still has enough well crafted plates to satisfy more sophisticated palates.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,3,4,sLp6gVKg7oRjTibC6wBT6g

I came here with an open mind and had no expectations other than the what I'd usually expect from a WP restaurant which is exactly what I experienced. I personally find the menu to be spot on given it's a bar and grill and this place fits perfectly in Downtown Summerlin. 

We started out with cocktails, I had the Classic Margarita, and we finished our meal with coffee and both tasted great.

Truffle Potato Chips ($9) - House-made potato chips infused with truffle oil and covered with Maytag blue cheese sauce and chunks of cheese. Get this! The chips taste great alone, but the cheese sauce just takes the chips to another level. My friend and I had no shame when it came to scraping up every last bit of cheese sauce we could from the bottom of the bowl. Very good!

Margherita Pizza ($15) - The sauce tasted so fresh and the crust had the perfect crispness. I loved every bite of this pizza and will absolutely order it again. Not surprising at a WP restaurant that the pizza was amazing. The price was fair given the quality ingredients and they do have gluten free crusts on small pizzas if that's your thing.

We ordered the Heirloom Caprese, Crispy Calamari, Artisanal Charcuterie Platter, Salmon Tartare Potato Chips, and Spiced Cauliflower. Among these, I enjoyed the Heirloom Caprese since it was fresh and tangy, and the mozzarella on the Caprese was perfectly melted over fresh tomatoes. The Artisanal Charcuterie Platter was packed with flavor, and the cured cuts of meat were really tasty with the cheese varieties and toasted bread. I also think this was a good choice since it pairs well with wine. The Spiced Cauliflower was a popular favorite among my group, but I personally felt it to be a bit bland. 

I didn't enjoy the Salmon Tartare Potato Chips and the Crispy Calamari too much. The salmon was lacking tanginess or flavor or something, it just was forgettable. With the crispy calamari, it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked and some pieces felt a bit soggy and it also was lacking in the flavor component. 

For the main courses, we ordered the Rigatoni, which for me was nothing special. However, I loved their Sausage Pizza! The crust was perfect and so was the ratio of cheese to sausage. The bread here in general is yum, including the free bread.

We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation time, and when I said we were early, the hostesses and someone that I think was maybe the manager waved it off like it was no big deal and sat us immediately.  As we walked to our table, we were greeted by waiters and servers as we walked by.  Very friendly.  The first table we sat at was right by the back door to the patio, so my husband asked if we could move away from the door, and she said of course and promptly moved us to a booth without any hesitation.

Our waiter (I think his name was Eric) came right over and was very attentive throughout the meal.  We ordered the cheese and salume board for an app.  It was a nice portion and the truffled honey was delicious.  Word of caution, the horseradish mustard will clear your nostrils out!  So spicy!  For dinner, I had the papperdelle with oxtail ragu.  The noodles were the definition of al dente and perfect.  The ragu had a slightly sweet flavor that made me keep coming back for more as I tried to figure out what it was.  My husband got the roast chicken, which was flavorful and so moist.  He also ordered the sweet potato as a side, but the maple butter on it made it a little too sweet for me.

It's also worth noting that their wines and cocktails are nicely priced.  I had a crisp New Zealand Sauv Blanc for just $8.  Most of the cocktails were around $11.

We waited for a strangely long time, and then the dessert sort of came out. The crème brûlée came out fine, but instead of the skillet cake, we got a brownie looking thing with chocolate sauce. We asked him about how this isn't a skillet cake, and he told us they didn't make that anymore, and they use a brownie instead of the cake. But, he informed us, they forgot to put ice cream on top of the brownie. So, he took it back to get ice cream. We ate the crème brûlée, and it was delicious, actually my favorite dessert. A little while later, a plate of tiramisu came out. The server told us it was on the house. Of course we were happy, who doesn't want free dessert? Then the brownie WITH ICE CREAM came out. It was good, but it was really nothing that special. But GEEZ the server was nice. By the end, we got free tiramisu, paid only three dollars for the brownie, and got twenty percent off the meal for their mistakes. I mean, what's wrong with that. The excellent service here really saved this experience.",sJ4RYCb_KmJonK-WJzjGRw,0,0,5,iuthE8tJx5DuBxNzFLmWFg

Sat at the bar about 5 minutes before HH ended and the bartender was able to get my order in quickly. I got an order of the salt&pepper wings, parmesan fries and calamari. The food was pretty tasty, out of all my favorite were the wings. Definitely try those they are full of flavor. The only down side is that you only get 4!! The fries were a good portion and the calamari was good as well.

Can't forget the liquor - I tried the Summerlin Sour and this cocktail is probably what's gonna keep bringing me back. So refreshing, tasteful and the texture with the egg whites was perfect. Ended up having 3 with my girlfriend. Must try!

Even though Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill has been in the neighborhood for almost three years, this was my first time eating here.  I looked at the RW menu and decided this would be a good way to test the food and service.

This was a $40 RW menu.  For the three courses, I chose the Baja shrimp ceviche with tostada crisps.  The ceviche had red pepper in it and on the rim of the glass.  There were pieces of avocado on the top of the ceviche.  After eating most of the ceviche, I lifted the glass and drank the remaining juices and got some good pepper taste.

The main I chose was the black pepper pappardelle with wild boar ragu and pecorino cheese.  The runner asked if I wanted pepper or parmesan and I asked for parmesan.  He came back with a small contained with freshly shredded cheese that I added to the pappardelle.

For dessert, I ordered the salted caramel pretzel tart.  

The main course was the star of the dinner.  The ceviche was good but the glass was so packed it made it a bit difficult to eat.  I know I have some tomato to make sure is removed from my shirt when I do laundry.  The pretzel tart was OK but I expected more pretzel.  There were bits of pretzel sprinkled on top of the caramel tart and alongside the piece but that was it. 

Service was excellent.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,7,3,sZo9jY-Av5hyh5YlvPg_Cg

Decided to sit at the bar and the bartender and other wait staff are a hopping fulfilling orders for waiting patrons. The bartender took my order and brought me a menu over. She was very pleasant and friendly. I have never visited a bar where the bartender comes to the tables in the bar area and floats around. I am so glad she is able to do this since it makes her job easier, fun, and more involved in the customer experience. 

The heartbeat of the bar is the bartender and the individual that is running this place is highly organized and very focused. She recommended the buffalo cauliflower which was fantastically hot but the burn goes away after a bit. I had a glass of rose to start but then with buffalo anything beer is the answer. To pair with the rest of the buffalo cauliflower decided on the beer flavored Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing. 

The ambiance of the restaurant/bar was so relaxing but still upscale enough to keep up the elegance of fine dining. The wood paneling is a great touch and so is the outside patio area which has a mist system. This being the desert with a great way to stay cool and proper shading the outside patio area is welcoming too, but I prefer good old air conditioning and cocktails indoors.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,17,16,5,NiJQmjBK1p8hk1PBbtSRtg

4146535,2018-03-29,0,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"Delicious meal, exquisitely prepared with star service!

Being in the mood for something special, but one where I didn't have to get changed into something fancy, I chose to dine at Wolfgang Puck tonight. I have been going for a few nights for dinners and lunches, but I have never tried their tasting menu.

Dining on my own, I thought it would be perfect since I wanted to try new dishes, but didn't have to deal with a massive amount of food on my own. Generally, the tasting menu is for 2 or more people, but the staff   took pity on a solo diner. 

It's not because they let me try it that I'm gushing, but it's been a while in Summerlin where I feel I've had a perfect meal. I have my favorites in town, but, let's just say that it's been a while since I've so thoroughly enjoyed my meal like tonight.

To start, the staff was friendly, inviting, and accommodating. The service was well paced, and not intrusive. I portion sizes for the tasting meal was perfect for me, and you get five dishes, so it filled me up. Some may think it small, but I think it's exactly the amount of food - actually they give you more than what one should eat healthily for a dinner. 

The tasting menu consisted of 5 dishes.
1) an appetizer of salmon tartar - two oval mounds with creme fraiche and two large pieces of potato chip. The salmon was seasoned with a bit of crunch from cucumbers. It was mild in flavor, but the potato chips made a difference. It was clean tasting and and just enough to get my appetite going. Really good!

2) I've been eating a lot of their WP Chopped, and never tasted the Apple Endive. It's my new favorite. It has endive, macaron almonds, fennel, apples, and I forget what else. It comes with dots of balsamic, and it's crunchy, vinegary, sweet, and savory. Loved it! 

3) Pappardelle with boar was fabulous. I'm going to run out of superlatives to describe my meal. The pasta was thinner than most pappardelle, so that you can almost see your fork on the other side. The sauce was just sticky enough to coat each of the strands, and it was perfectly seasoned. I usually ask for chili flakes on my pasta, but I didn't even ask for it this time, because it was really flavorful. After this dish, I was getting full, and wondered how many dishes were in a tasting menu here. I finished everything. I'm on a low carb diet as well, but I ate the whole thing. It was just enough for me not to feel guilty. If I weren't on low carb, I'd definitely order this many times.

4) The market fish. I forgot what fish it was, but it was flaky and cooked well. I loved the foam. I think the server said it was some mushroom flavor... I don't know. But it was slightly salty, and ethereal - yeah, it's foam so it doesn't linger. The skin on the fish was crispy. I peeled it off and ate the whole thing first. So yummy. then, I squeezed the charred lemon on the rest of the fish and spinach. This dish is flavorful, but also super health. I'm on weight watchers, and on the program, I can probably eat this all night long. Excellent!

5) Finally, the dessert was cheesecake. Not just any cheesecake, but one that is creamy, moist, with texture that was substantial but also melted with a great mouthfeel. It came with fresh berries, whipped cream, and coulis. It was just the right amount of sweetness. I had to really work on my will power not to finish it, but it hit the spot. 

This was the perfect meal I was craving all day, and they delivered. THANKS for a great meal. AND, for $50, I think I'd go back again. Maybe it's not an every day meal for every one, but it sure felt like a value to me for all that I tried. The portions for me were great, and I'm not overstuffed and feeling uncomfortable after the meal. It was healthy, and super tasty. 

Wolfgang Puck has really kicked it up a few notches.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,0,0,5,677oG_LKPM4BlBCvQC3qjA

The service wasn't bad just would expect a little more attention.  I also ordered the Nutella skillet cake and it was average. The consistency was soft and gooey which was nice but I didn't feel there was much more taste than when I eat Nutella out of the jar.

4484719,2016-05-09,5,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"When all is said and done, it's the manager who makes the difference.

We were 9 people out for Happy Hour, just looking to have a good time.  The saga has a pretty happy ending, but for most of the time it was a struggle to get the waiter to attend to us properly.  He was definitely poorly trained, which wouldn't have shocked me if this was Joe's Coffee Shop, but c'mon, it's Wolfie's (no, not the old place in Florida).

He was abrupt, not sticking around long enough to fully explain our orders, giving us a rush job, and generally being inattentive and unfriendly.  A few of us ordered burgers, all cooked medium.  This isn't the waiter's fault (I think), but all of them came out still attached to the cow, dripping blood, which was shocking.  

Enter the manager, Brad Street.  He took charge, making sure we got our burgers replaced and whipping our table into fine shape.  To make up for the rotten service, he comped us some delectable desserts and a few drinks.

Now for the kicker:  We got a single check for the table, which we paid using two different credit cards, one of which was ours.  We asked the waiter to put $120 on our card, which would include our portion of a generous tip.  He returned and said he couldn't do that, because the amount, along with what was being put on the other card, was more than the bill. Strange, but we decided to leave the tip money in cash.

The very next day my husband checked our CC account online and discovered that the waiter had indeed charged our card for the full $120, obviously pocketing the extra, in addition to the cash that was left.  He went right to the restaurant and explained what had happened.  Brad made reparations immediately, and assured us that he would be speaking to the waiter, as well as adding some much-needed training.  

And that's why I've decided to give Wolfgang Puck four stars, bloody burgers notwithstanding.  It's possible it was the chef, but equally possible that the waiter never communicated - or miscommunicated - our requests for edible meat.  We had a good time, the other food was very good, and we'll be returning.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,7,7,4,9q7LsR73ea-GYey7Tzg3Kg

Our server was very nice & professional right off the bat. I had to wait a few minutes for my friend to arrive so he got us waters & was nice about waiting.

We ordered the house sangria to start. It was very good but not strong at all. We also ordered the crab louie appetizer and charred snap peas (a side) as a second app. Both were amazing.

It was so good. We actually save that sauce to put on our main dishes. The bread was also very good - crusty on the outside & soft inside.

We both ordered salads. I got the kale & spinach and I added salmon. My friend got the chopped and added chicken. My salmon was cooked perfectly but we both agreed that the salads we so-so. They weren't bad, just not wow like we expected after the delicious apps.

Like Wolfgang's other places, this restaurant is consistent and also offers of good selection of tasty delights.  

For my drink, I had the daily healthy fresh pressed juice.  Today's special was spinach, kale, celery, ginger, orange, and apple.  It's not bad combo and tasted alright.

For the appetizer we had the calamari, roasted vegetable pizza, and a side of french fries.  The calamari was awesome, two sauces for you to dip your calamari and some battered veggies as well.  The roasted pizza was very good as well, the broccolini added a nice texture to the pizza.  Normally I like a meaty type of pizza, but for a change I decided to try the roasted vegetable pizza and I'm glad I did.  Nothing special about the fries, skinny type fries, but the nice thing is the side of fries is a nice hearty portion and great for sharing.

For dinner we had the mushroom pasta and a side of broccolini.  The mushroom pasta had great flavor, but the one thing I wasn't a fan of was some of the pasta had clumps of salt which made it really salty for some bites.  The brocolini stir fry side was a nice compliment to the meal, a little subtle spicy kick to it.  

As for dessert, we had the apple crotada.  Basically, a fresh baked open faced apple pastry with a side of vanilla ice cream.  Since it's fresh baked, it takes a few minutes longer.  This was really good, the pastry was very flaky and warm right out of the oven.  The apples weren't too sweet and a little tart which I like.  Definitely a dessert I'd get again.

Service at the table was pretty good.  The odd thing is with the hostess, we got there and had to sit at the community table since we didn't make a reservation per the hostess even though 80% of the restaurant wasn't full at that time.  Even after we were done with our meal, paid and got up to leave the main dining area they had about 40% of the main dining area open not counting the outside patio dining area that no one really sat at since it's cold outside.  It seemed odd to push people to the community table to sit next to each other when it wasn't super busy.  Maybe the hostess was still training, but I'd recommend making a reservation given our experience if you and your party want a more private dining experience.",BoA83SDJI9HV3lJzFs8laQ,1,0,3,ZU-D0AbbHtc-7bY0F5P2lA

The burger (good)
Spaghetti and meatballs (very good - homemade pasta that is, yes, cooked al dente)
Half rotisserie chicken - tasty, and I'm not a huge chicken fan
Special BLT type of sandwich at lunch - EXCELLENT

I've also heard from other diners that all of pasta dishes on the menu are very good.

For a non-alcoholic treat, try their Ginger-Lime Iced Tea. It's amazing!

Crispy tortilla shells, layered with a well-spiced sauce, black beans, eggs and guacamole. Not a huge serving, so eat slowly. But excellent flavors. 

Wife ordered egg croissant. Side salad is very fresh and the size is nice. But the dressing is overly sour for the dish. When fresh greens are slightly bitter to start with, this became too much. Wife LOVED the eggs. They were sooo fluffy. Ham is good, but a bit salty. The egg, ham and arugula in one bite is delicious, so keep your plate organized. And ask them to warm the croissant first. 

Wife had ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, but sent it back. The sauce was excellent...but the meatballs were cold inside and the spaghetti was gummy. It was almost under-done on the inside.

I arrived 3p for a late, leisurely lunch.  The bar was occupied by 3 other guests but the remaining spots were dirty - dishes and place mats from previous occupants.   I took one of these spots and the bartender (working furiously) assured me he would clean it shortly.  I left 90 minutes later and all 3 additional bar diners got the same experience.  They sat at dirty seats and waited quite a while for service.  Where was the manager??? 

Once I got to order, the food came quickly and it was delicious.

We counted 30 plus staff, about 1:1 ratio to the customers dining inside. No doubt just for the opening until things get settled. 

The focaccia bread was nice and my Summerlin Sour was a nice, tasty drink without being too strong, which was fine since it was lunchtime. The recc'd truffled potato chips w bleu cheese fondue was way too salty for me and not strong enough bleu cheese. We asked for the mac n cheese instead and were graciously accommodated. The pasta was fine and al dente, but the sauce was a bit bland and runny. More importantly, the crock it came in was barely lukewarm; mac n cheese should always be hot! We gently pointed this out and our waitress immediately said it would not be on our bill.

Since I had grown tired of dealing with Strip traffic, I nudged my travel companions to checkout Summerlin since I knew it'd be quieter yet as (if not more) upscale than the Strip.  I was not disappointed! 

I had been to a Wolfgang Puck concept in Tulsa, OK a few years back and greatly enjoyed the dish I had (bacon-wrapped meatloaf and mash potatoes), and I found the food just as scrumptious at this bar & grill.  We were greeted by friendly waitstaff as we entered and asked our preference on seating.  We chose the patio as the restaurant wasn't packed.

My dining companions ordered bottomless mimosas (affordably priced!) and enjoyed swift refills.  We ordered brunch food and all had positive reviews on the taste and quality.  I in particular had french toast which had the consistency of funnel cake yet blew my mind!  It was a bizarre combination of high and low but it totally worked.  The toast was served with traditional maple syrup and a berry sauce.  The funnel cake style french toast was so savory that I only used the raspberry sauce and abstained from the syrup.  I also ordered a side of bacon which was acceptable as expected.  

While the food should always be the star of a Wolfgang Puck grill, I found the atmosphere and service to be the standouts.  The patio was designed with foot traffic in mind and we were seated at an adequate distance from our neighbors so as to not invade their space. Seating was comfortable and our metal table was sturdy.  The interior of the restaurant was spacious with a modern flair (lots of steel and smooth industrial floors).  Lastly, we didn't have to flag down our server ever and checkout was a breeze.  Recommended with gusto!",FnNW8IiCYkKsFSL6Uu_Ugg,1,1,5,4mU5D_q0MtscBHvhUWS8FA

5278329,2014-11-05,4,bgXb5YYzQvHXmM8owZB4fQ,"The Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill doesn't officially open until November 5, 2014, according to the wolfgangpuck.com website, but I was lucky to stumble in on their soft opening a day early. All the head honchos were in attendance, from Wolfgang's ""right-hand"" man to the executive chef of Wolfgang Puck (as told to us by our waiter). Customer service, to say the least, was on point. All hands were on deck, and no one was left wanting.

Complimentary bread infused with herbs and olive oil was served in an adorable wooden bowl. The bread was incredibly soft, thick, and flaky too! We told our waiter to keep those bad boys coming. :) 

For starters, I shared the artisanal cheese and salami plate ($16) with my better half. I was surprised that the plate came with only 2 types of cheeses, and was hoping for something grandiose due to the hefty price tag. When the plate arrived on top of a weathered cheese board, the pickings were slim. Call me plain, but the cheeses, sauces, and adornments on the plate were too ""fancy"" (i.e., overwhelmingly powerful and distinct) for my palate.  

My husband ordered the mesquite burger for $13, which is damn cheap for the quality. He was ultimately only able to finish half the burger, so it was decent sized. I was told the burger was juicy, too. The fries were plentiful, fresh, and warm. I had to restrain myself from eating all his fries! There was only one snafu: he had to send the burger back because he ordered it medium well but was presented with a medium rare burger. The kitchen was quick to fix the problem and the manager himself came to our table not only to apologize, but insisted despite our protests that our dinner would be taken care of.  

I ordered the rigatoni dish minus the turkey bolognese sauce ($15), opting for a tomato based sauce instead. The sauce was perfectly creamy and the dish was overall extremely filling. 

The standard of customer service displayed here at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill was unreal. The waiter literally helped seat me by scooting me in my chair and dropped a napkin across my lap. Our waiter was extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable on every menu item we asked about. My water glass was never empty and the employees frequently checked up on us to make sure everything was okay. I think my silverware was changed at least three times. Plates were cleared off almost immediately - it was like magic! When the waiter cleared our cheese plate from the table, he picked up a miniscule crumb of cheese off my husband's place mat (seriously). I was over the moon about the whole customer service experience. 

To sum everything up:
Ambiance: 4
Food: 4
Customer Service: 5+

I didn't save room for dessert, but the Monkey Bread was highly recommended by the staff. I will definitely come back to this new Wolfgang Puck location in Downtown Summerlin. I'm salivating over what I imagine the Monkey Bread will taste like, and would love to try the pizza next time! Customer service quality alone makes a return visit necessary, and is why I rated Wolfgang 5 stars. I hope that their standards for customer service will remain unchanged after some time passes.

I love that they are so welcoming of dogs here. They even bring out big bowls of ice water.

Bri was our waitress and she is a dog lover. Bri brought us the menu and had those bottomless mimosas at our table in seconds. This was our first time here and Bri gave us some great recommendations. We ordered all of them. And I love the fact that Bri was honest and told us the large pizza was too big for just the 2 of us since we were ordering other things. 

We ordered the Huevos Rancheros w/ Black Beans. I order this at every restaurant because it is always different. This was excellent-- I have never had it where the tortillas were crunchy like a tostada. I would go back just for this meal.

Next up was the Small Smoked Salmon Pizza w/ dill cream, red onions and a little dollop of caviar. I did like this pizza but it had way too much salmon on it for me. The BF loved it and ate most of it. If I ordered it again I would probably order it with light salmon. I know that sounds weird but just my preference.

The grand finale was the Truffle Potato Chips w/ Blue Cheese. Yes you read that right. TRUFFLE POTATO CHIPS. Woo Hoo- they were so good. Chips tasted homemade and the the blue cheese sauce was very light and just everywhere. They were perfect. 

You can never go wrong with bottomless mimosas so we made sure to take full advantage of the bottomless. This restaurant is really beautiful and I love the patio seating. It was so nice and relaxing. I love that it's in the back and you don't get the mall crowd walking by staring at you.

Obviously food matters most so lets get right into it:

-Free range chicken wings. I think these are pretty great. I have spoken to people who say otherwise and I get their point, they arent crispy that is true. They have a thick glaze and arent fried but I don't mind that texture. The glaze is great with a small amount of kick. I could eat a lot of these

-Hand made meatballs. Very yummy no question. You can go to all kinds of restaurants and get a meh meatball but this is not one of them. Worth a taste

-Cheese and meat board. Pretty good I'd say. Nothing blew me away but it's cheese and meat and all of them were edible and fairly enjoyable.

-Prosciutto Arugula pizza. I dont see this on the menu so it may have been a special. Not quite my favorite. I've had plenty of these pizzas before and usually like them but the cheese prosciutto and arugula ratios were way off. The arugula amount overpowered everything else and make the pizza bitter.

-Rigatoni Pasta. Delicious and very filling. Bolognese sauce is great as is the ricotta. It's simple and a great meal no question.

So, the place isn't perfect that's for sure. I haven't loved everything I've tried but it's definitely more likely to be a hit than a miss on any given night. I've gone a handful of times and expect to go again. I recommend you do the same.",TZhIAnp1m3RzWevju1mp1g,4,3,4,tJ7lQQOA1IWER4akMSKbtg

Chuck and I were with a friend from Atlanta and we were all pleasantly surprised. Chuck ordered the fried fish and there were three delicious and generous pieces that were perfect (lightly breaded and not oily) simply delicious. My friend from Atlanta ordered a Greek Salad with shrimp. The preparation and presentation were Amazing because The chef was Generous and very creative with the ingredients. I had a new Italian salad salume and it was also excellent . We will definitely return. We loved the decor and ambiance. Perfect atmosphere for a late dinner after a show on the strip.

The first thing that was odd is the manager refused to put our group together at one table. So, we were forced to divide our group to sit at two separate tables in the side room by ourselves?  The service was not very good for having two servers they struggled with simple drink service.  The only food I heard anyone say was really good was the pasta carbonara.  The special salmon burgers were dry with little dressing and big portion of sweet potato fries that came with ketchup.

The truffle fries were divine and we shared calamari, sweet potato fries, a pipette AND the chicken sliders.  We were pleasantly surprised and topped off the evening with a glass of Proseco and a lemon drop Martini. 5 dinner items and 3 cocktails later  (shared) we received a bill for 52.00!!

I thought the lighting was a bit dark for me, for a large table I thought it should of been brighter like the smaller party that sat next to us that had better lighting. I thought we would receive some bread while we waited for our salads and soups to come out but we didn't. I was facing the kitchen so I was able to see the line. I thought it was weird seeing someone who wasn't in uniform come on line and eat food in front of the customers. Even though it wasn't that busy, I think it was a bit rude. Our food came out and it looked and tasted delicious. I had the chopped salad and thought it was a good portion. I tried the clam chowder and it was pretty good but felt a bit loose? But that's just me. We also got the calamari, which I wish had a bit more calamari. The sauces that came with it went well with it. I thought half of it was a bit salty. There was even a fried lemon and was something different. The wait staff was great, our waters were always filled  and they took our finished plates right away. Our main course came out and it looked and tasted delicious. I had the oxtail pasta, which i forgot the actually name was one of the best pastas I've ever tasted. From the fresh pasta which I've seen them made to the bolanaise oxtail sauce. Would highly recommend. My friend, who had here bday here got the roasted vegetable pizza was pretty good, I actually had a slice and dipped it in the bolanaise sauce. Tasted even better and had her doing the same. After we were finished our waitress noticed it was my friend's bday and brought out a bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream. I love the crunchy top to the bread pudding.
