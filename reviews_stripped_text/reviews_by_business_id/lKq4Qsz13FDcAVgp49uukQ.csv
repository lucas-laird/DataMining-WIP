We were seated quickly which was ultimately a reason we pick the restaurant because the burger place next-door had a huge wait. I was really glad we did as everyone like their food. Our server was friendly attentive and helpful. The price is reasonable but in typical Vegas fashion slightly high. I would certainly eat at this place again. They also have a quick takeout window if you just looking to get a quick slice.,2meYHg6FAWmlTbhzoEPNlg,0,0,4,b7tvn8wT8xll0B7UjmX8tQ

I'm out in Vegas 5 or 6 times a year on business and always stop in a few times each trip.  

Ask for Melia.  Fantastic service.  Even when the bar gets slammed, she is able to nimbly manage her way around to everyone, making sure no one ever gets hungry or thirsty.  She makes you feel like you're the only one in the place and greets everyone with a million dollar smile.

But considering this is Vegas and even drinks at Starbucks are priced twice that of everywhere else, this place does deserve credit for $5 beers and $4 pizza slices at Happy Hour!! The pizza itself was above average, not great but not terrible. The beer (Fat Tire on draft) was good. Again, they both felt better considering I had paid $40 for mediocre lunch that afternoon!

The vegan meatball sandwich was good, but the ""Not You're Momma's Garlic Bread"" was amazing - incredibly uniquely flavored, and unlike anything else I've ever had.

We got the special at the time- two cheese slices and a draft beer for $10.  A little more than it's worth, but a good deal for the Strip.

The pizza was fine.  It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't as good as Secret Pizza.  The pieces were huge and my husband and I each had one and we were full.

You can order slices with toppings but those are at least $5 apiece.  Also, if you order a draft beer without the combo special, it's $8.  If all you are looking for is a drink, you might as well just pay the two extra dollars for the combo and feed some hungry people walking by.

I can't see myself making a special trip to eat here (like I have for Secret Pizza), but it's a good choice to have if you are in Mandalay or Luxor.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,1,1,3,IXlal1qMRbXjsH6YyyvBOg

Food is overpriced, most items are $20+ while just a few are $15 and below. The coupon you get when checking into this, does not make up for paying as much as you do.

We ordered an 18"" meat lovers pizza that was $30. We wanted to get a create your own pizza, but doing that with just one topping would have been $25, so we went with the signature pizza instead. It was very greasy, but there was more than enough of meat on every slice. We also got a pasta; angel hair-Alfredo ($15) with chicken (extra $5). The portion was good enough to split with two people, but the taste was very bland, there was also very little cube cut chicken pieces so paying the extra $5 was not worth it.

Before we sat down we noticed one of my family members wasn't doing so well due to his diabetes so we asked our server to please quickly bring us bread, water and anything else they had ready. Although we had stated why we needed it in a timely matter, we still had to wait about 10 minutes before we even received our water! One of our other family members had to go across the store to a mini mart and buy a few snacks for him, and also went in the ""walk in buy a slice"" area of this restaurant to get a pizza.

We also wanted to try the meatball appetizer. Upon placing our order, we are told that there is a minimum of two cheese slices per person...odd! Clearly the intention is to fill you up on cheap cheese pizza so you order less of the more expensive stuff. We didn't fall for that so one of us ordered two slices and had our one slice each.

828129,2015-04-08,0,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"This place was the biggest surprise of my Vegas trip. I went in expecting just some generic meat/cheese replacements, and that is not what I got at all. 

When researching places to eat with vegan options, this one came up, but I immediately thought to myself, ive done the fake za before, many times, might want to go with something different. I am glad I made the time to come here. 

I ordered the not your mommas garlic bread as an app, since it was happy hour this was half off!!!! Then a Back East Buffalo and the ""cheesecake"" for dessert. 

The garlic bread was good. It was probably what I was most excited about, being a garlic bread fan, although it ended up being my least favorite of the three (but still, very good). There were just enough for 2 to share, so if you have more than 2 I would suggest maybe getting a second order or second ap. 

The pizza was great! It was almost perfect, a refreshing bed of carrots and celery with buffalo sauce, vegan ranch, and gardein chicken and daiya. The carrots and celery made this pie for me, and I hate celery! but this was cut thin and the mingling with buffalo sauce and the ranch made it all delicious. I am not usually a big gardein fan, but this seemed to be marinated in the sauce, and tasted fairly good. My only complaint is that the crust was not evenly cooked, with some burnt like spots on one side, but it wasn't very bad, just that part was extra crunchy. 

And now the star of the show, the cheesecake. I was expecting generic vegan cheesecake, and I got a great tasting cheesecake if it were to stand alone, but alas it didn't, it came with a pineapple compote that was probably the best tasting fruit compote I have had in my life! So good, lighly herbaceous, just delicious.

We were first seated in booth overlooking the mall, but I became nauseated from the overpowering scents wafting over from Lush. They moved us without any trouble.

We asked to substitute beer for wine, but no go. House wine was the only option. Two pinot grigios were brought over. It was really sharp, way too much acidity.

We started with the tuscan salad ($10.95) Fresh spring mix, tossed with diced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, sliced red onion, basil, parsley and toasted chunks of herb 
infused bread. Finished with an aged balsamic vinaigrette. And garlic fries ($6.95). The salad was nicely dressed and fresh only complaint was the lack of mozzarella cheese. The fries were shoestring and crisp, but pretty average. The garlic aioli was heavy; not a fan.

Next we had the Margherita ($18.95) pizza and the rigatoni with meatballs and bologonese ($17.90). With a name like Slice of Vegas I had to try the Pizza. I wish I hadn't. The rigatoni was far superior. The margherita crust was tasteless and the ingredients lacked that high quality flavor. It was a real disappointment. The meatballs were ok, they tasted too bready to me, but the bolgonese sauce with the rigatoni was a real surprise. My husband and I both liked it.

If I were judging the pasta and salad on its own, I'd give an A-OK rating, but since the signature item is pizza. This was definitely ""meh"" and we were thankful our tab was about 50% off. It's definitely not worth full price.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,4,1,2,c_2yJGjxzXzHHfkKJysnPw

1123281,2016-09-18,0,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"I am going to rate their Vegan Pizza because they are one of only 2 places that serve vegan pizza in Vegas ( that I know of) 

To start, I am dumbfounded that other places don't offer it. All they have to do is use a different cheese and charge a premium for it. Not like they have to change all ingredients in making the pizza. So I am very glad this place allows me to come with my friends and we are all able to get something to eat. 

I tried their Vegan Supreme Pizza. I have to say that while vegan pizza will probably never be as good as the ""real thing"", this rates a solid 7/10. 

The dough is very good, the sauce used was not that bad ( a little too thick for my personal taste but good nevertheless) the cheese used I believe is regular Daiya, which vegans have a love or hate relationship with. It's not my cheese of choice for pizzas I make at home but it's decent. 

The only con is the price. It is quite expensive, I ended up paying about $35 after taxes for an 18"".  

I understand they charge a solid $7-8 premium on top of the vegan pizzas, and again, no complaints at all, at least they're giving us an option. BUT it's not like I can go there every weekend and grab a pizza, so unfortunately the price is much higher than i'd expect to pay for a pizza. 

Very decent taste. Very Expensive as well. Will I go back?  On rare occasions due to the price. But I can see myself trying their other flavors.",GDY-w1OO_nzLfe9AAVzgGA,0,0,4,K86EQnx0PHXKpK46wjlIBQ

1170760,2012-07-05,3,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"Ok you guys...
Took Sarie out for a little 5th of July lunch.  I was pretty hung this morning, so we thought some sausage and carbs would definitely do the trick. Found a groupon for this joint. It's in Mandalay place, nice location. (It's always fun to stare at Pete Rose sitting at an empty autograph table).
At the podium we were quoted a ten minute wait, which was exactly how long it took. Seated at a crappy corner table, then I asked to move to a slightly less crappy corner table. Oh well.
They have a very nice beer selection. Great microbrews including my favorite beer ever brewed, New Belgium's 'La Folie.' Try it if you dare: a sour brown ale aged in merlot casks. Very well babanced, perfect use of Brettanomyces and tannin. Whoooohooo.
The people next to us had a gigantic pepperoni pizza on the table.  It looked alright, a little soggy for my taste. I also saw some spaghetti and red sauce dishes that appeared to be nothing spactacular.
Sarie ordered a cup of coffee and we relaxed a minute. The menu looked good, we decided to share a 'panini'... We ordered the proscuitto and brie. ""That sandwich is no longer on the menu"" our server tells us. What are you talking about, I think to myself, it's printed right there, stupid. Obviously it's on the menu. How about saying something like 'Oh, i'm very sorry, we're out of that one. maybe you'd like the _____ instead.' But I said Ok, we'll take the meatball sub.  
Big mistake. 
First of all, it had very marginal flavor. The 'meatball' was more like a mushy sausage patty than a meatball. The red sauce was equally flavorless and I only knew it has cheese because I could see it. No taste there either.  AND it was certainly not a panini, which should be pressed and grilled. This was more like a toasted sandwich. Im sure Quiznos has a better one, anyway. 
The garlic fries would have been wonderful if they were not served cold. 80 degrees is perfect for San Diego, not frenchies. I would have sent for some fresh ones, but our server might as well have been David Copperfield's sister, as good as she was at vanishing. We got the bill, and I was surprised to see that Sarie's cup of coffee cost about as much as a footlong meatball sub at Subway (which is where we should have gone in the first place).
Started feeling sick on the way home (although that might've been due to last night's festivities, which included copious amounts of liquid courage and about 65 cubic yards of mentholated smoke).
Oh, and the groupon isn't even good until tomorrow, so now I'll have to go back, although I really don't want to. But when I do, it'll be for 2 bottles of La Folie and some hot garlic fries.
All in all, this was a terrible way to spend $20 and an hour of our time. Blah food, blah service, blah blah blah. I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the great beer list and clean atmosphere.
Thanks you guys. Always a pleasure telling you how it is.",Gu-rR-zYcWo3mPPkUHXUrA,1,1,2,M51Y7lPY77sM-6M7Qw3Q2Q

My fiance was very specific about tri cutting her slices and light on this heavy on that and despite the five people behind us, she kept a smile on her face and said absolutely. We ordered five slices because we didnt want to wait for a whole pizza so we paid twice what we could've if we were fifteen minutes patient. I wanted my pizza pronto!

Extra props go to the poor staff who was forced to deal w/ the masses of drunken Mandalay Bay beach / concert goers who were completely wasted by the time we showed up at 7pm

They took orders efficiently & served up the pizza choices quickly

I also appreciated the fact there were many choices for toppings & you could choose or build your own.  They also had quite a number of good-looking side dishes ( such as spicy, roasted cauliflower ) and I imagine this would have been yummy on their cheese pizza..... alas, Sis doesn't like spicy & we wanted to get something Sis, Mr & I could all share

No way that was a 12 inch pizza. Thank goodness I only ordered one with one topping. I would have been really miffed if I would have gotten one of the specialty ones that was 19$ for that dinky of a pizza. Salads are crazy over-priced- I mean crazy...$12 for a salad they said was supposed to have a variety of items besides lettuce. Was almost all lettuce and a pittance of the other items. Beer prices are a little high as well. Service was a mix- waiter was very nice and helpful. However one of the hostesses was literally a deer in headlights. She must have literally stared at me for 4 or 5 minutes while I stood in front of her. I finally had to say I had a reservation and she was like ""Oh"" It was really weird and then sadly her manager remarked that she's ""highly qualified to be a hostess"" instead of saying he was sorry for what happened. Strange management. Incredibly overpriced. A big waste of your time. The taste of the food is just over a 3 out of 5, but their cheapness in ingredient use and price-gouging lands them an overall 2. If you come here, you surely won't leaving saying the food tasted bad, but you might be mad at yourself for the reasons mentioned above.

I loved this joint! In my hotel, it provided me with excellent vegan friendly choices! I brought back my brother and his girlfriend so he could get involved in some veggie friendly meat substitutions. I tried both the Meatless Meatball and The Vegan Faux Pie- both were delicious. As far as sides go, the Meatless Meatballs were good but a very small portion for the $ & the what I thought were faux 'chicken wings' turned out to be what we in the UK would deem were chicken nuggets? That was v disappointing, but I'm not sure what I expected I would get in a vegan chicken wing! Maybe over-expectation! Great, great pizza's though for vegans!

Available only on 9/5/2016. Incredible deal considering that the pizza is huge and delicious!!! Limit was 1 per guest and additional toppings was $1.75 each.

We were one of the first there so we were greeted and seated right away. Julie was our waiter who waited on us very nice and kept making sure we were ok.

We ordered the jalapeno mac n cheese. I'm usually not a fan of restaurants mac n cheese but this. Omg. So good. It had bacon bits in too. My husband and I shared as an appetizer. It was served in a bread bowl. Which made it even more amazing. We also ordered my boys dough balls to play with while we waited for our food.  They were $2 each and so worth it.  The boys really enjoyed them lol 

Only down fall for me was that they had no discounts on beer for locals. I understand being inside a casino on the strip they up beer prices for that reason. But again being local I wish I got a discount. They had some pretty awesome beers on draft that I wanted to try more of.

Located between the Mandalay Bay and Luxor, this hidden gem is a must try. 

My friends and I stumbled in here after not being able to decide where to eat...

At the end of the night I think the quorum agreed it was an excellent decision.

After a day and part of the night full of drinking and gambling beer, wings and pizza was it for dinner.  

The wings were tasty, fresh and perfect with the side of ranch.  The Parmesan fries were good too! We shared two types of pizzas, the meat lovers as well as the chicken bbq. Both were delicious and were gone in minutes.

It was easy to decide what type of pizza to share and we all had a good time.

Food is reasonably priced and service is fast surprisingly good considering the time we came in.  

Our large group was seated in the rear where there were a few tvs. There was a display of old matches and old memorabilia/art of historic Vegas which I enjoyed. The place was comfy and accommodating.

If I stay at the Delano again, I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again.

Thanks Slice of Vegas for excellent food, service and pictures... you helped make a quick bachelors party memorable.

My friend, who suffers from celiac, and I went because the online menu advertises a gluten free pizza. We were so excited! Unfortunately, as soon as the server found out my friend has celiac, he told us that they cannot promise the food has not come in contact with the flour in the air from the other pizza crust and there could be cross-contamination.  (This information is also posted on the restaurant menu.) My friend, who does not seem to have issues with trace amounts of wheat, decided it was worth the risk. Before we could start ordering again, the server left the table to get the manager. The manager came back and told us ""we do not recommend"" people with celiac eat here... and continued with what the server said then simply waited for us to leave. He didn't ask if we understood the risk or if we were ok with this possibility of cross- contamination. We were just excused. Even as I started to explain that we understood and it was ok he just stood there waiting for us to leave. It was so rude. We have been all over vegas and had so many people go out of their ways to make sure we had an amazing experience and felt comfortable eating there. This was such a shock to the experience. He made us feel so uncomfortable and so unwelcome.

A few moments later, said manager approaches and casually asks about how the appetizer was, while feigning ignorance.

Earlier in the experience I did go for dinner and once again had the hangover pizza. It didn't quite have the same flare as last time so I'm open to trying the meatball sandwich next time since from the previous experience I sampled a meatless meatball and couldn't tell the difference. Not to say that the pizza was bad this time because that's far from the truth as I found the dough very soft and light on the muffin top as I walked away!

Later on after watching Michael Jackson one we decided to come back and mosey up to the bar for some alcoholic hi-jinx. What stuck out was the Italian Creamsicle. It was what I call a sleeper drink because it goes down sweet, but once consumed takes you to an inebriated happy place. The bartender appeared like she was training, but beyond being amazingly beautiful she made sure we were always taken care of. Although the drink sounded fruity on paper with banana liqueur, orange juice, and pineapple juice she made mine a bit more heavy on the rum which I had no complaints about.

I would recommend this for a more quieter paced setting and drink selection was pretty extensive between mixed drinks and otherwise. It was reasonably priced and thankfully not overpriced compared to other places. On a plus you can shell out $14 and get a souvenir glass to take home.

The Jalapeño Mac was awesome again, it's served in a bread bowl and has bacon. Don't leave without trying it. 

The pizza on the other hand was pedestrian at best. Considering the greatness i remembered of the 10 meat pizza, i was expecting at least a very good slice, but i wouldn't consider it better than any mall pizza stop.

2371714,2016-04-16,3,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"Dear Slice of Vegas,
It disheartens me to have to write this letter about the experience myself and 9 of my friends had at your restaurant tonight. 
-Tonight 10 friends of mine all got together to celebrate an upcoming wedding in our group of friends.
-We arrived at Slice of Vegas about 7:45 PM and were promptly seated in your nice back room by no later than 7:55 PM. 
-We were greeted by our waiter who took our drink order and then followed up to take our dinner order with normal service.
-Before ordering we requested our bill to be split about 5 ways, that's just how it is when you are in big groups. 
-When it came time for us to order while ordering we specifically asked for some extra sauce on the side of our meal. 
-All of our meals came out promptly/hot but were delivered by somebody other than our waiter and that's when everything started to go downhill for our group. 
-This is the beginning to when we never saw our waiter again. 
-After 15 minutes of having an empty water cups, and not receiving the extra sauces I requested on the side of my wife and my meal I went out to the main dining area with my wife's and my water cups to be refilled by the bar tender. The bartender wouldn't fill my cups instead she flagged down the original waiter who from the other side of the room shouts ""What do you need!"" In a disinterested tone. I raised up my two empty glasses of water and approached him, he said he'll bring them to the table, I also requested the sauces that I had ordered with the meal (ranch and marinara). 
-He did then promptly came to the table with 2 waters for us after I did this, and told me the sauces are on their way, but he didn't take the time to ask anybody else if they needed anything (3/4 of the drinks, waters and $2.95 sodas were empty). We still had never had the usual ""Did everything come out alright?"" that you get, especially when you weren't the actual waiter that handed out the food. 
-After about 7 more minutes of waiting for the sauces (and ¾ of all the food eaten on the table), I approached the main dining room where he looked at me from across the room and shouted again ""what do you need!"" This time seeming irritated and not caring at all, it was at this exact time the sauces were being delivered by another waiter. 
-We continued to complete our meal, but still had absolutely 0 interaction at our table in the back room with our waiter since we gave him our order at the beginning of the evening. Everybody still had empty drinks and nobody had come by to check up on us.
-After about 20 minutes of us all sitting there, waiting for our checks I had, had enough of this nonsense and talked to the ""manager"" of the night. I explained to him, verbatim what I just described to you, drinks had never been refilled, sauces didn't come until the meal was practically completed, never seen our waiter again. I asked the manager ""Joseph"" if he felt the service we had received was ""unacceptable"". Joseph would not agree/use the word unacceptable, he would transition into saying it's busy, and apologized. I informed him again about the horrible and lack of service that was provided and once again inquired to see if it he felt it was ""unacceptable"" once again he changed the subject to doing their best and it's really busy. So I inquired as to if this is what service should be like and is expected to be like in this restaurant, because if so I'd like to inform my friends. He said ""No, it isn't"" so I informed him then it's ""unacceptable"" isn't it.
-The checks were finally brought out. No nice check folder, just a Hodgepodge of nonsense handing them out willy-nilly. To my frustration, we all found that a 20% gratuity was automatically added to all our checks. This I felt was beyond unacceptable for the amount of service/lack of service rendered for the evening.
-I Approached the manager about it, he said it's company policy and he ""can't do anything about it"", I explained again all the things we had been through in the evening again (we just had this conversation less than 4 minutes ago) he continued with his story of ""it's corporate policy we can't change it"" this went on for over 8 minutes until I told him, if that is company policy then we are all paying cash and leaving no tip at all if that is how the company does business. He then finally agreed to remove the tip, but in a last attempt to still do little to nothing about the situation he tried to just take it off my 1 check out of the 5 at the table. I then requested he take it off all 5 of our checks, which he finally did. After this was all said and done we noticed that your waiter had put 2 $.50 sauces on everyone's bills. There was no notification that it was an upgraded charge for sauce, and not everyone wanted sauce or ranch and I guarantee there were more charges for sauces on all our bill than actual sauces were provided to our table which is fraud.

-It was very clear this waiter thought they would automatically get their 20% tip from our t",Hf1p6Jr6lbFVU50MmDq_fw,1,1,1,OF3bqhRStrJ6h1KXs9WQpw

The pizza looked appealing and had that essential layer of grease but fell short of what I'd even consider passable pizza ala Sbarro. (Setting the bar really, really low). 

The cheese, sauce and toppings were all tasty however since the pizza had been setting out and they don't reheat it prior to serving, the cheese got hard and lost its hold onto the crust. 

The crust was the real disappointment though. The crust had no rise and no chew but it wasn't thin crust. It was a dense crust with a thin ring around similar to what I would expect at a high school cafeteria. On top of that the crust was burnt on the bottom, but not in the good way like you'd expect from a Napoletana pizza. This just had a crispy exterior and a light acrid flavor. 

It's not really fair to judge a whole restaurant based on a slice from the counter so take this review with a shaker of salt.",FPBoO_mRVx6bcCz7EJ-cdA,3,2,2,AZzfCXQWn_jHeA-8wVtJwg

The service was brilliant, all of the TVs showing sports confused me (disclosure, we had been in Vegas for two days at this point, I'm from England, we normally have a maximum of one TV showing the news) and the pizza gave me mixed feelings. 
In the UK I have never experienced a pizza that has a puddle of grease in the middle of it. This pizza tasted absolutely wonderful but you had to hold it up and let the grease drip off of it before attempting to eat it. The portions were also a lot larger than we had expected. Upon finishing both my partner and I felt rather unwell and we had to rush back to our hotel room, there was far too much grease on the pizza and that caused us to feel rather nauseous. 
All in all three stars, after the excess grease had dropped off of the pizza there was a rather pleasant taste to it but after leaving us attached to the toilet for the remainder of the day we weren't too impressed.",BQwXzBBUTYPnY0q-wTFfaQ,1,0,3,9F4gHCzJ0FHEUT_kz0cMIg

1. They sell by the slice as well
2. They have a Happy Hour that runs during the work week.

Other than that, Slice of Vegas would probably be my dinner pick based off of sheer convenience for when I'm being utterly lazy and don't want to walk too far to go anywhere. It really wouldn't be my first, second, or third pick for pizza on the Strip but gets the job done when you are in need. It's not bad pizza, just a greasy knife-and-fork pizza that doesn't leave any lasting impressions of pizza happiness in your mind. (Pin Up Pizza does for me!)

Kudos to these guys for a Yelp discount. As always, expect Strip pricing for anything here, so pricing seems exorbitant for the pizza quality that you get here.

  Our server, Johanna was very helpful. We had a restaurant.com coupon (yes, check them out because they are on there)!

3062184,2012-06-28,2,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"If this place isn't overrated - I'm not sure what is.

I'll start by saying that I was inclined to try Slice of Vegas because of a Groupon.  As a local - it's always entertaining to spend a few hours on a Friday night at the Strip - looking at all tourists so we figured we could be entertained AND eat for cheap.
 
Neither one of is drinks alcohol on any regular basis so cocktails were not in the mix so thererefore cannot comment on prices. 

We started our night with about a 15 min wait for a table - which really wasn't so bad.  The staff seemed friendly so I will give them a + in that department aside from the fact that our waitress was a bit peeved that I only ordered water with lemon.  As someone who tries to pay attention to the calories that I put into my body - I don't normally drink soda or juice and I'm sorry but I'm not paying $2.75 or $2.95 for water that had a Lipton tea bag in it .  There are a lot of things that I spend a lot of money on but I'm not going to be ripped off when I don't even want the item.  Had she not been peeved - she would have gotten our standard 20-25% tip. 

As far as food - we ordered an antipasto app - I think it was about $11.95.  It was decently sized and had a good amount of taste but I think I'm just spoiled coming from back east.  I'm used a really hearty platter when I get an antipasto.  I am also looking for more meat and cheese in Vegas and it seems no one gets it right. In addition to the antipasto - we ordered a 12"" meat lovers pizza.  It too was tasty and I will say that it was MUCH tastier than Grimaldi's (who everyone raves about) but seriously - damn near $20 for a 12 inch pizza and $30 for a large .. You have to be joking.  There is no way in hell that I would EVER pay $30 for 16 inch pizza - I don't care what's on it. 

So - all in all - for a tourist walking thru the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay dying for pizza - more power to you.  For a local - don't waste your money.  There are plenty of places in town with mediocre pizza for less money.",Zemr8otoe_xhutAI62rWqQ,3,2,3,FDEmZ7c_1BhurN9sBlAQZA

Then all of a sudden you could see a lot of movement of the staff and the gate of the restaurant went down. That's when I noticed something was wrong but the staff appeared cool, calm and collected. I asked ""are we locked in here?"" They provided us with all of the information they knew and said we were on lock down due to a shooting. The news will tell you the details of the attack, but I will tell you the details of my experience at Slice of Vegas. 1) the manager Joe was on top of things 2) I truly felt like we were in the safest place in the casino as other establishments kicked their guests out into the chaos 3) The establishment did not charge anyone for their meals because their priority was our safety 4) They offered their employee restroom to us so we wouldn't be in any danger or have to leave 5) They stayed with us the entire time even when they had access to their personal vehicles during a terrorist attack they stayed ensuring we made it to safety. The owner and other high level staff came to the scene and assisted the police department in making sure we were safe and could get home risking their lives for their customers.

We decided on the fries with vegan ranch and ketchup, the vegan garlic bread, and the vegan BBQ ""chicken"" pizza to share. The fries were the skinny cut fries but cooked perfectly and not overly salted. The garlic bread was served with a full head of roasted garlic on the side to smear over the bread which was toasted perfectly and had a pesto spread on top. The BBQ chicken pizza was actually delicious even though daiya cheese is not our favorite, the crust was crispy but not burned, the onions and the micro basil on top made the pizza.

There was a small wait when we arrived because the place was actually pretty busy, which in my book is usually a good sign. My mom can't eat dairy products due to a food allergy, so she was asking the manager if they had a Vegan cheese they could put on the pizza. The manager actually went to the kitchen and came back with a piece of what she called ""tease"" cheese for my mom to try to see if she liked the taste before she ordered a pizza covered in it. Mom claimed it was the best Vegan cheese she has ever tasted.

We were seated and the waiter came up right away and took our drink and food order. He was a nice guy, but it was so busy that he forgot the drinks, so we flagged down another waiter to bring them for us. 

We ordered a 10-meat pizza and a dish of Pappardale pasta with spicy marinara sauce. Both of the items we ordered were excellent! The pizza had a nice thin crust and wasn't overloaded with toppings to the point where you couldn't pick it up...it was perfect! Plus, they made half of the pizza with the vegan ""tease"" cheese and the other half with Mozzarella, so Mom and I could both enjoy it :) The pasta had a great flavor as well, and though it wasn't the best pasta I've ever had, it was pretty damn good.

To top it off, I had a cannoli for dessert, which was just about average :)

My major gripe with this place is the SUPER inflated prices. I understand that we're on the Strip and everything is more expensive, but $18.95 for a 12-inch pizza is pretty outrageous. The pasta dish was $14.95 and the cannoli was $6.95.

Food was extremely greasy. My friend got the pesto pasta with chicken and mushrooms and it felt like olive oil pasta. The noodles were DRENCHED in oil, it was kinda gross. This is the only time I have never liked pesto sauce!!

I ordered the blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were yummy and the burger was alright. The meat was kind of dry but all the other addings made it a pretty tasty burger.

The one cool thing here though is the big glass beer taps you can order and have placed on your table! It is a glass tube that's probably yard size with its own tap on the bottom so you can pour your own glass. Very awesome if you want some beer to go with your pizza or burger!

I'd really only eat here if I was staying in the Mandalay Bay and wanted to eat somewhere convenient. Otherwise, it's kind of pricy for the quality but they do give you huge portions! However, they're not to die for leftovers. There is no 'wow' factor with the food here but it's decent Italian food for a decent price. There's soo much better in Vegas though.

Short: Pizzas were okay and great when you've been drinking, but not Cosmopolitan Secret Pizza great. Crust was a bit bland. Service was spotty. A bit pricey too ($23) for a 18 inch pepperoni 

Came here at 11:15PM or so I believe and they we're half way closed, but no problem could still buy the pizza by the slices!

I could not order any new pizzas, but in case you wanted to, it is $18.95 + $1.95 per topping for a large (18inch), 12 inch was $9.95 + $1.95 per topping and have specialties already made that range something like $25. They had some interesting ones like prosciutto and pesto, but I suppose I will have to try next time. 

The girl who helped us was nice, but did not really listen well. My friend asked her to double slice the pizza and with her verbal reply we believe she understood. Unfortunately we walked quite the distance already to realize that she didn't, nor did she reheat the pizzas. I suppose reheating is a personal preference as the pizza was still warm, but to me, if I'm paying $23 for a large pepperoni, I expect it to be hot.

Located in the Mandalay Bay along with another Vegan-friendly restaurant by the name of Hussong's Cantina, Slice of Vegas offers a full on Vegan menu. It mostly consists of Gardein and Daiya based recreations of their regular menu. Hey, this is Vegas damnit! Nobody comes here to eat salad.

With so many options to choose from, I skipped the Buffalo Pie in favor of the regular version so that my babygirl would be able to share the pizza with me as she isn't too keen on spiciness. The thin crust was so so, but the rest was Daiya & faux meat heaven. I'm not the biggest Daiya fan, but it is great substitute for pizza.

I ordered a side of Vegan Buffalo Strips as an appetizer for myself. If I had known they wouldn't be very spicy, I would've went with the atomic sauce instead. It was odd they put the sauce on the side, rather than smothered into the strips. Perhaps it would've given it more flavor as well as the joy of getting your fingers messy as you much away on Buffalo sauced goodness. I enjoyed this but at $10.95, it's a bit pricey. Even for Vegas...

I wish I was hungrier on this visit as the menu had so many options to from. Various appetizers, pasta, soups, salads, desserts and more. So many pastabilities, so little room in my tummy. The prices could be lower for the quality of the food, but I can't complain too much.

We each ordered a slice of cheese pizza and the garlic parmesan fries to split. The pizza was pretty sad. Dried out, overcooked, not very cheesy. Reminded me of something you'd get in a high school cafeteria or gas station. The fries were good, and I really liked the pesto aioli. 

The crappy pizza is the real reason for three stars. Everything else was good. Even for the cheap price, it seemed pathetic. When your logo is a damned pizza slice, you should make an effort to make a better pie.

The waitress then informed us that the pizza was very small and we would want to add something else to our order. I asked which items were gluten free and she informed me that the wings were gluten free. Upon receiving the appetizer we were told they were cooked in the same fryer and were not in fact gluten free after we had started eating. After leaving my husband got violently ill and called to complain. We were informed that it was our fault for ordering the items because of cross contamination that we should have been knowledgable of. 
We only went to this place because it was advertised as gluten free. We would not have ordered if we knew that NONE OF THEIR ITEMS ARE ACTUALLY GLUTEN FREE
The customer service after this mistake was just added insult. The manager was unapologetic and uncaring of our situation. He claimed that they ask about celiacs disease and give warnings about cross contamination which was not even slightly hinted at. He also said that there was a miscommunication when in fact we were blatantly lied to.

Food. There is a whole back side of the menu that has vegan options. And here's a tip: from 3-6 they have vegan happy hour appetizers. Yay us! The menu is plentiful with so many options I had no clue what to order. Normally I have 1 option to choose from and that makes it easy but I had about 20+ options to choose from. 

We started with the vegan hummus which was very good. The roasted peppers and crispy chick peas on the center were the best. I ordered the vegan hamburger and sweet potato fries. The burger was amazing! It had all the fixings. Vegan cheese and mayo as well as everything else on a normal hamburger. The taste was great, I only wish I hadn't scarfed down all the hummus because I was kind of full. It was a lot of food! 

My coworkers ordered a pizza and chicken parm. Both seemed pleased with the options. It not over the top about them. 

All in all, great place to enjoy! I will say that the options they had on the menu are great but all things I can make from the comfort of my own home and when I got out to eat I like to eat things new. Restaurants that have only 1 vegan option usually have a good choice and something you wouldn't normally have. So although there is a lot of variety, these are things you would have access to at the grocery store or home.

The pizza is ready to go - just pick your slice and they will heat it up.  It is decent quality and size, but not a tremendous deal.  My slice of meat lovers had plenty of meat and a nice crust.  I bought a slice, a water and a coke and it was like $20.  I am guessing the slice is like $10 at that total- not much for what you pay!",xJxtHt9Rvdy75EMvVtcN9g,36,37,3,S7am9f4XiCR3DabmtdsvlA

Their pizza is thin crust, but I've never been satisfied by their crunchless crust. It's never crispy. The portion sizes are huge, but that comes hand in hand with their high pricing. I mean, $30 for an 18 inch with sparse toppings is a bit much, isn't it? Even by Vegas standards? Plus, their little wings are $12! $12! For 7 pieces! (Side note: 7 is a weird number, so they either gave me an extra or I got gypped.) Sure, it came with like 5 sticks of carrots and celery, but $12?!

Service is okay. I tried to redeem the yelp check-in for free fries, but they told me it was for dine-in only. I didn't read the offer carefully, so it was my bad. They gave me a free cup for water (normally $.50) while I was waiting though.

I love Groupon deals because it allows us to try restaurants that otherwise we won't care to visit.

The filet of grilled salmon was tasty and fresh and served with angel hair pasta tossed in garlic and olive oil with cherry tomatoes and fresh basil. My husband had the Bisteaka, chef's cut of steak grilled to how you like it and came with potato hash and red wine mushroom sauce.

It was a little crowded that evening so the atmosphere was a little loud. Dimmed lighting. As crowded as it was, though, we were seated immediately and our server was very attentive, always checking on us if everything was alright.

3992312,2017-02-05,0,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"My experience is based solely on the walk-up counter, I did not dine in.
Had to be down on the strip to fill out some tax paperwork, and thought I'd visit some former co-workers at the restaurant I used to work at next door to this establishment. After I left, I thought I'd grab something quick and easy, and relatively cheap, so I chose Slice of Vegas. 

PROS: 
-The young lady working the counter was extremely warm and friendly, and even complimented my makeup. 
- Considering it's on the strip inside a nice resort (Mandalay Bay), it was only $4.50 for a HUGE slice of pizza. Pretty good value in my book. 

CONS: THE FOOD. I now see WHY it's a good value.. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza (no drink) which came out quick and hot. I am not some super-duper health freak; I've had pizza before that had some grease on top (Chuck E. Cheese comes to mind..) and I'm totally ok with it and i eat it.. HOWEVER, there was SO much grease, it took 2 napkins just to get MOST of it off. There was barely any cheese and the sauce tasted funky. It was burnt underneath, and the crust was so hard I could barely bite into it.  Even after my attempt to drown it in parmesan cheese, it still was.. well.... disgusting. I can count on one hand in my entire life the times I found a pizza inedible,  and this was one of those times. I choked down as much as I could because I was starving,  but I would NEVER recommend this place for the pizza.",PTfIcx4u7-VaDRaGp0mAdQ,0,0,2,vMjg9mTSRGBytJY6FwwPQA

With no real food today, except what cows eat I was really craving something that was a main staple that was packed with protein and carbs too! Been working it so good that it will not even hurt the diet. Or if it was I can work it off on the treadmill tomorrow morning. So it's all good.

Pizza is a main staple of any good diet. My relationship with pizza goes back to as far as I can remember! Now with a new pizza joint that when I walk in is playing Saturday Night Fever, who could go wrong. Everyone is staying alive! Not able to get on the John Travolta moves I can sing in my head and tap my foot to the wonderful beat. It's entrancing too!

The bar is where I chose to sit and enjoy my food. The bartender was very helpful and attended to my needed. The bartenders name was Caitlin, she was absolutely fabulous. She kept such a clean bar, and was able to even keep the dishes right behind the bar clean as she went in the dish washer. The Slice of Vegas rewards the customer for their Yelp check in too. Woo-hoo with Parmeson Fries. They were so good but with a side of ranch of course. I also had a slice of cheese from the happy hour menu. For only $3.00, what a steal! The cheese slice hit the spot since I have been craving pizza. Deciding dessert was a must I ordered the Cookie Skillet. It combine chocolate and Carmel sauce on vanilla ice cream with whip, nuts, and a cherry all made to order. Are you getting hungry yet?

4063010,2017-01-13,4,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"Not the best nor the worst dining experience that I've had in Vegas. This restaurant is located in the Mandalay Place right on the Strip.

I have been to this spot two different times and have experience the good and the bad that comes with dining out. First time I came here, I was here with family during dinner time.We came here to get a bite to eat as we had been drinking and needed to sober up.

We shared a pizza and a Caesar Salad. The Caesar salad was different from any other one of its kind that I've ever had. Made with romaine, broccoli, croutons and their house Caesar dressing, which in my opinion of of the best tasting dressing I've had!!! Topped with fried anchovies, grilled lemon and fresh Parmesan. Cost $11.95. The portion was big enough to share among four adults. We also shared a 18-inch Nonna's Margherita pizza, which is made of fresh mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. Not the best, but not the worst. Flavor was good, but it was dry. This cost $29.95.

Second time I came, I came during lunchtime. This time, we had to wait as there were so many people. I waited about 20-25 minutes before I was seated. I was seated toward the back at a tiny table with hardly any elbow space. To make things easy, I and my guest decided on just getting waters as it took forever for our waiter to get to us. Upon looking over the menu, my guest decided on the Delitalino sandwich, which is made of imported Itailian meats of cappicola, salami and ham. Along with provolone cheese, tomatoes, onions, pickles, romaine lettuce and seasoned with dried oregano and Italian dressing. It came with a side salad of their choice. Cost $14. I ordered the Scotty's Chicken sandwich with a side garden salad. The sandwich was made of a grilled chicken breast, which was so tender and moist. Topped with a roasted tomato, pickle, basil pesto, fontina cheese and jalapeño bacon. The garden salad was made of spring lettuce mix, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and edamane. Seasoned with an Italian dressing, which I replaced with ranch. Their ranch dressing here is so delicious!! This also cost $14. Both sandwiches and salads were amazing. Which almost made up for the lack of service we received during this visit. 

Con's:
1. This place is so popular that there is always a line of people waiting to eat here. The tables don't get cleared off quick enough to accommodate the the customers.
2. It is always so loud. Don't come here if you want an intimate experience or want to be able to actually have a conversation with your guest without having to yell.
3. During popular hours, don't expect to get great customer service. I feel like for the amount of people that come thru here, they never have enough staff working. Our waiter had a huge section all to himself and was running around crazy trying to take orders and make sure his customers were satisfied, but in the process, I had to wait forever to get my lunch and for him to bring my check to me.

It wasn't until all 10 had been placed that cashier started to dish out slices from the case which I had until this point figured had been for display only.

About 20 minutes later, everyone's orders placed she began throwing the slices out. my room was a brisk 3 minute walk away, and by the time I arrived the slice was cold.

This is one of my more favorite places to go out of my way for in Vegas for many reasons:

- It's easy to get to. Since it's on the Luxor side of the bridge to Mandalay, don't even bother with the nightmarish Mandalay Bay parking lot, and opt for super easy parking on the Luxor upper parking deck. It always seems to be a shorter and easier walk.

- They have an AWESOME VEGAN MENU with so many amazing offerings. I'm so glad they are advertising this now because before it was kind of by word of mouth only.  The vegan meatballs are a must! You can also get GLUTEN-FREE pizza, although it's only offered in one size (I believe 10"") and does take a bit longer for them to make. They use Daiya Cheese, which is the best! They'll also add it to your vegan salads and other dishes if you ask nicely.

- Great beer selection. Lots of imported stuff. Lots of good stuff on tap. Read the blackboard for the latest.

- They have a to-go window. Convenient!

- Wait staff is friendly, but yes, a little slow. This place gets busy though, and there is a back room where they have a lot of parties from the conference goers. So most of the available wait staff is stuck having to deal with that. No completely their fault. They could do with one less person at the front.

NEWS ALERT FOR THE VEGANS: was told by the waitress last night that the chocolate cake, cheesecake, and the zeppoli (from the normal dessert menu listed on the coffee cans at your table) are all VEGAN! Don't miss out on these.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,2,1,4,6KtMaNMZ5T2gjWDWQiVIQQ

I kept walking by this restaurant when going to Luxor to Mandalay Bay and back. The smell of the pizza got to me the first day. Once someone suggested we eat it for lunch before heading back to LA, I was all in.

For 3 people, we ordered the 18 inch Helldorado. Let's just say, it was hella good. We all love a little spice and the jalapenos definitely helped, but it wasn't very spicy. Us Koreans love our spice, so we all added chili peppers to our slices. What I enjoyed the most was the whole crust. The bottom of the pizza was cooked perfectly; it had the best crunch that added great texture to the pizza. Plus it wasn't too heavy. It seemed like it was thinner than normal pizzas that I usually have, which was perfect for me.

The only thing is that you can't order by the slice when dining in, only whole pizzas. At first, that was a downer, but honestly, we all enjoyed the Helldorado so much, it turned out to be for the better.",TCGQjK2Xd5KdgkbOp8fkig,0,0,4,Q6cQHvmjSWbULvfEwX3odA

I ordered a 12"" Miles' Ten Meat pizza.  The crust, sauce and cheese or ok.  The pizza comes covered in several different meats.  You get a good amount of toppings.

There are other options as well if you are not in the mood for pizza.

This place is realistically a three star.  I am taking away one star for one petty thing that annoys me.  They offer a 10"" pizza as well.

The menu contains a typical selection of pizza, and my favorite pizza is the ""miles 10 meat"" pizza. like the name implies, the pizza has 10 different kind of meat on it. good thing about slice of vegas is that, the pizza was never frozen, u can really taste the freshness of it. The pizza slices were thin. it has that crispiness that I really like, with a perfect amount of chewiness. and the flavor is really good. 

I have only tried 2 of their pizza at this place, the miles 10 meat and the 4 cheese truffle. The sauce on the pizza was good. its the perfect amount. on the miles 10 meat, the sauce was dark red, and a bit sweet. u cant really taste the tomato flavor of it, which is a good thing for me, since I hate tomatoes. The amount of cheese on it was in good balance. All the ingredients on the miles 10 meat were tasty. The 4 cheese truffle is good, but tends to be very oily. 

Overall, the pizza were really good and I would really recommend it. its not really a wow factor but we are in vegas and not nyc.

We figure that since this place is called Slice of Vegas, we should try their pizza, 12 inch pepperoni. Pizza was pack with flavor BUT the pepperoni was salty and made the pizza really greasy.

The GF remembered this place while wandering from Mandalay Bay to Luxor the previous time we were in Vegas.  It was already closed by the time we wandered through, but she had bookmarked this spot for dinner next time out.

Well, we finally made it back and we came over here from the Vdara.  We actually arrived at 5:30pm so we hit happy hour, which is 1/2 off select booze and select appetizers, as well as individual slices.  This included vegan versions of some of the apps, which was great.

I ended up ordering Not Your Mamma's Garlic Bread and Sweet Potato Fries tossed in truffle oil.  Since they were half off, why not get both?  

The Garlic Bread was fantastic...thick slices of bread and instead of butter and garlic, Slice of Vegas topped it with an almond based pesto that was quite tasty.  They served it with a side of a roast garlic bulb, which you could drop a knife into and grab a clove like it was butter.  That roast garlic but this over the top.

The Sweet Potato fries weren't anything special, but you could smell the truffle oil they tossed it in after.  It wasn't a huge amount, they probably drizzled it and gave it a few tosses, but it was plentiful as a whole and delicious.

Their pies were a little pricey; 12"" for $19.  I did try the crust on my GF's Vegan Buffalo Chicken pizza and it was cooked very well.  She loved it; but I didn't really taste the toppings itself so other than the crust, I can't comment on if it was good or not.  

Service was friendly and excellent.  The waitress was very patient. happy, and cheerful when assuring us that the ranch dip that came with the fries is vegan.

So we booked at the Mandalay, knowing there'd at least be the best pool in the world to soothe the pain of not being at the Wynn.

It's a casual Italian eatery, and coming from the suburbs of Philly, I felt right at home.

Pizza, pasta, salads (really? you're eating a salad?), appetizers, sandwiches, DESSERTS.....oh lordy, they thought of everything.  They left no stone unturned.

I was lured by the meatball sandwich, and went high to hog heaven with the first bite.  A great roll (they even call it a hoagie roll, like my people back east!!), a rich balanced sauce, the perfect amount of daiya mozzarella, and gardein meatballs, which are probably my favorite outside of homemade.  It came with sweet potato fries, and our darling waitress said the magic words, ""Would you like a side of ranch with that?""  WOULD I?!  Gimme gimme gimme.

Sam was perfectly content with his spaghetti and spicy marinara, and would've come back for it every meal if I'd let him.  We stuffed ourselves silly and had no room for dessert, which was the saddest thing.  I even tried to come back later after a night of dancing, but they were long closed.  Alas, I can add this place to my repertoire of super vegan friendly restaurants in Vegas, and I'm very happy that I don't absolutely have to go to the Wynn to be well fed (to the point of bursting).",H183Fg4ku9mIQsmAa0fsOQ,7,4,5,MxsMUgLYo8N24HMVCdw2kA

My BIL got me an Italian Creamsicle to start with, as I needed a drink (one of those days).  Pretty yummy if you like sweet drinks like me.  I ordered the Bowl of Pastabillities (create your own pasta) with rigatoni, pomodoro sauce, and shrimp ($14.95 pasta/sauce + $5.95 shrimp = $20.90).  One of my kids got the spaghetti and alfredo sauce with sausage and shrimp (+ $3.95 sausage = $24.85).

The pasta was just okay, nothing special.  My hubby's meatball sandwich ($12.95) was okay too.  My mom and sister shared a Caesar salad ($11.95) and an 18"" Choked Pig pizza ($29.95), which had pesto aioli, mozzarella cheese, bacon and artichoke mix, topped with chopped basil and whiskey sour cream (they wanted to try something different).  They said that the taste of anchovies in the Caesar salad dressing was strong, and the pizza was eh (I tried it and I didn't really like it).

Overall, the food was average at best but overpriced.  Service was nice so I gave it 3 stars.",zT-5xnkEwhyCmWi2lUorrg,0,0,3,PLOmwvNyq-iZp67dhGRpJg

My friend and I were so drunk; almost felt like this place was a mirage except when we clutched the wall, IT WAS REAL! We did the drunk girl excitement and raised our hands to the Italian Gods for creating pizza dough! 

Before the waitress said anything, she knew we needed a reservoir of H2O. We finally choose to go with the Back East Buffalo Pizza & devoured it in minutes! I'm not that big fan of thin crust because sometimes it's so thin you can't put any yummy toppings on their without falling off or the crust gets burnt, but this crust was to die for (and that's not the tequila talking)! Although the prices may seem high, it's Vegas!! I rather pay more money for quality than have a free nasty meal! 

A good side effect of a thin crust pizza is it's enough to soak up the alcohol, but doesn't make you feel all bloated and nasty and lethargic, so you can still get into your skank dress and not feel like a sausage!",vS90b6C6NOMQ94EI1no3aQ,0,0,5,3mHVtXQibnY5rcC99Ap5qg

This pizza shop is actually inside a mall, which made it a little difficult to park and find at first. Once inside the mall, it was super easy to find and it stuck out.

The hostesses were very nice, as was the female server we had. The boy and I ordered salads...just kidding! What do you think we ordered? Pizza of course! We opted for the 18 inch 'Choked Pig' which had pesto aioli sauce, mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, a bacon and artichoke mix, then basil on top. This pizza was delicious; and HUGE! I think we ended up saving 4 pieces which equated to a whole 'nother meal which was awesome. This size pizza was roughly $30 but they also have a 12 inch for $19, or a 10 inch gluten free for $17. I would have loved to try the gluten-free, and it's awesome they actually offer it.

For dessert, we order the cannolis. The best I've ever had was up north in New England, but these were a close second! You can tell they know how to make em because they only fill them RIGHT after you order them. Lots of places keep them filled and this results in a soggy outside. These were yummy with pistachios, chocolate chips, and chocolate sauce and were nice and crunchy!

Oh, I also had a Restaurant.com voucher and we were able to use it. I think we ended up having to order a coffee or something so we could reach the certain amount of money we were supposed to spend, then we got a certain amount off. Pretty cool!

This is one large pie! The crust is paper thin and to die for.  They put on  just the right amount of garlic and Daiya cheese. Since I polished off the whole thing, its a good thing I had to walk back to my hotel. 

I have been to Vegas before and ate a lot of Subway. This time, I had better options almost everywhere I went.  I saved a copy of the menu so I can reminisce!

The wings were some of the nastiest things I've ever tasted and were left untouched without comment from the server, despite his acknowledging that we enjoyed our pizza. The pizza was good, but at 19$ for a 12 inch pizza, there are many stronger options in town. Tip, a Brita water filter cost 12$. Invest in one, your water is third world.

Good food, but tons of problems!

1st, waitress almost skipped me for drink orders (she would've if I hadn't waved her down as she was leaving!)

2nd, I had to ask for a drink 2 separate times & still didn't get it until friend was like ""he's still waiting for his drink!"", so 3 times total!

3rd, friend ordered shrimp alfredo & it had ZERO shrimp ($2 increase!), so it was sent back only to be returned with a bunch of shrimp tails! It's in a wrap style, so shrimp tails should've totally been removed!

4th, the check was very clearly split up, but still charged wrong!

Not somewhere I'd recommend for groups. It might be ok for 1-3 people, but not sure...

I'm not a person to typically be harsh, but this was kinda ridiculous! I'd've given it a 1 star rating, but my food actually tasted good... But very overpriced!

We ordered Mama's Garlic Bread with Mozzarella. It was very yummy. It came as a serving of four. Four was more than enough to hold us over until the pizza arrived.

We also ordered a pizza. With the waiter advice, we ordered the 12"" Sausage pizza. It was greasy as heck. It had small puddles all over it, but it was just so damn appetizing. It tasted like a oily heaven. We finished every slice of it.

We wanted to order the chocolate cake for dessert, but our wonderful waiter mentioned and recommended the Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel. drizzles, that wasn't on the menu. I decided to order it. It took about 10 minutes for us to get the cookie, but when we did get it, it looked delectable.

We tasted the cookie and it was so warm and gooey. We got maybe half way through the cookie before we discovered that the caramel was salted. Not only was the caramel salted, it was salty. It started to become very unbearable. It wasn't the best. I wish I had just ordered the Cake instead.

Once the lunch was over, my stomach fell. I had to rush to the restroom. Sorry, I couldn't think of a nice way to say it. My friend's stomach didn't start hurting until she got home, maybe 2 hours later. I believe it was the pools of grease mixed with the taste of the cookie.

I know it was sounds stupid, but it was worth it. We will definitely go back. Next time, we'll just  pour off some of the pizza grease and skip over the cookie.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,1,4,EB0cZB6VkmctgeRjiWHY6g

I hit up this place with a Groupon in tow.  I was here on a mission -- try the vegan pizza.  Sat at the bar, ordered a (crazy expensive) beer, and ordered the 18"" vegan ""faux pie"" pizza to share with the BF.  Pro tip: the 12"" pizzas are TINY and a rip off at $20 each.  For $30, the 18"" pizzas are still really pricey, but at least you can feed 4 people off of it. (Or two people with plenty to take home!)

The pizza was super tasty - good crispy crust, nice sauce, good vegan (Daiya) cheese to veg to crust ratio.  If I didn't have to fight my way through the hot mess that is trying to park at Mandalay Bay, and it weren't so expensive, I would eat here all the time! That said, I probably won't frequent this place due to those problems.

They have a great selection of very expensive beers (I think the cheapest is a $6 bud light equivalent), but that's probably par for the course at a casino.  They have a few good quality drafts (Stone IPA!) and lots of good bottles.

They also have a few vegan/veganizable pasta options ($12+) and salads ($10).

Pizza was delicious leftover cold the next day, so if you're staying at Mandalay, just get the large and eat the rest when you're hungover then next morning.

We ordered a few things, including the bruschetta, fettuccini with pesto and veggies (vegan), garlic bread (vegan), and lamb sliders. 

The waiter came back to our table and informed us that they ran out of lamb sliders and vegan cheese (daiya cheese). Needless to say, I didn't get my vegan pizza or cheese on my garlic bread. Apparently they get their shipments on Tuesdays, and we came on a Monday.

The food comes out, and we notice a few things. The bruschetta was a few soft pieces of bread with diced tomatoes...on the side. So that was interesting. We informed the waiter that they can take it back because we weren't going to pay $10 for what we got. The waiter replied with a really stern ""That's how we make our bruschetta here."" He ended up taking it back, but I'm not too sure if he removed it from the bill or not. 

I got my pesto fettuccini with artichoke, mushroom, sundried tomatoes and basil. It came with a rock hard piece of bread, maybe something that would have been better for the bruschetta if it weren't so stale. The fettuccini wasn't cooked all the way through. The pesto was really good, it's hard to find pesto as a vegan without any dairy in it so I'm glad I could get that at least. 

I forgot to mention that as he was taking our orders he asked if I wanted the garlic bread out at the same time as the entrees, I told him as soon as possible would be awesome. We got halfway through our meal by the time I realized he forgot to put the order in. We called him back to the table and sure enough he did forget. The garlic bread was good, but not $8 good. Like, good enough and probably similar prep in your kitchen within a few minutes. It came with 4 pieces of the same bread as the bruschetta. Like I previously said, soft sliced bread. There was pesto on top which had a good taste, and a whole head of garlic on the side that I must have been too dull to realize that maybe it was something that I had to put on the bread to literally make it garlic bread. 

Honestly, this place might have been really good because the menu seems awesome but I won't be going here again unfortunately.",3Db9UHoTJRAA3AYU61t0Rw,0,0,2,FbTcZ3lL1WgEvuUraCzf1A

I made a reservation but I think it was kind of slow. When we walked up, it looked completely crazy but I think a big party was waiting to be sat. 

Our server was friendly and efficient so no complaints there. We ordered calamari and an 18"" ham and pineapple pizza. Everything was really yum. The ONLY complaint I have is that the pizza could've used a bit more cheese. The crust though, omg. I LOVE thin crust pizza but hate how sometimes it gets too soggy or other times it's too crispy like a cracker. This crust was just perfect. It was crispy on the bottom, but soft and chewy on top. If the pizza had more cheese, it would have been AMAZING and deserving of 5 stars. I'd like to go back and next time request extra cheese.

Also, I got the berry martini and it was TINY and tasted like juice. At $10 a pop, I'd skip the drinks.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,4,2,4,cKoajHyiEcQq6ehBeoJKsw

Slice is in the Shops of Mandalay Bay (the connector mall between Mandalay and Luxor) and next door to Burger Bar. Generally, I'd say if you're trying to decide where to eat Burger Bar is way better but I had lunch there recently and wanted something different. 

The interior is nice enough, with mostly booth style seating that should accommodate groups well. For once the person seating me didn't ask ""oh, just one? Do you want to sit at the bar?"" which was nice, because no I do not want to sit at the bar. The menu is your standard Italian offering - lasagna, build your own pasta and pizza. Because it's called ""Slice"" and not ""Pasta"" I had pizza.

First, the crust is really good - nice and crisp with a little chew. I'll agree with a few other reviewers that their sauce is pretty bland - it's just lacking in flavor, period so plan to use the shakers of oregano and hot peppers. Overall, it wasn't as good as the slice I had at Sal's in NY but it was better than the garbage at Famous Original Ray's so a-ok.

Service was a-ok too. My food came quickly but I wasn't checked on after - the standard ""single diner"" treatment again.....",PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,5,5,3,PT5KX7fHyIGomczVMTm18w

For this reason, they rip you off with a charge of 7 bucks for a simple slice of pizza.  Didn't notice this until I had already placed my order and that is on me. But I also added a side salad for almost 4 bucks, which I thought would come in a nice container with it all dressed up. No, it comes in a plastic bowl, just some greens thrown in with dressing on the side. Throw in a drink, with lousy options in their dispensers, and you've got an expensive quick bite for almost 16 bucks.

+ Meatballs: delicious with rich flavors doused in a marinara sauce.
+ Immortal Burger: half pound of meat. Pretty good and is pretty big for one person.

The meal was over $30 for two people, and for that price, I had hoped for fantastic food. Was it? Nah. Just a typical meal. The service was fine, and the booth was comfortable. I think it must be a Vegas thing for food to be so expensive.

The food was pretty good, and I would go back again if I find myself in Las Vegas again.  I had the soup with sausage in it - sorry, forgot the name - and it is a much better version that the similar soup from Olive Garden.  The cheesesteak sandwhich was tasty, although a couple of pieces of the steak were a bit chewy.  Nice thin fries with the meal.

The others had pasta, which you can build by picking the pasta, sauce, and proteins, and they looked very good.  Like any good Italian restaurant, there was more than enough pasta for a meal.

Slice of Vegas offers desserts, and they sound pretty good. However, we were too full from the meal.  Maybe next time.

Build your own Pasta seemed like a good choice besides Pizza, but I was wrong. I chose spaghetti, bologonese sauce (meat sauce), meatballs and mushrooms for my pasta. It came out to around $22 - 24 for the pasta and those two added ingredients. While the spaghetti and sauce tasted fine, it wasn't hot, it was semi warm, and everything else that came with it.

This little gem is hidden in the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and we wandered in during their happy hour from 3 to 6p. If you have ever been to Vegas you know that prices are all over the place and the majority of places range on the pricier end. Looking at the menu, SOV is also one of those places but during happy hour, all drafts, slices, and select apps are half off. SCORE. 

We posted up at the bar and had two bartenders during our venture here - both were lively, super friendly, and attentive. We order two slices of pepperoni and sausage plus their mild wings and a few beers. The slices were large and foldable - not quite NY style huge but close enough for me. The sausage had great flavor and the crust was just slightly crispy... exactly how I like it. The wings were fantastic. Period. Crispy outside. Juicy inside. Mild sauce had great flavor without being too spicy. In fact, there were so good we ordered a second batch and stuffed ourselves full. 

This bar had a great local selection as well - plenty of Las Vegas brews as well as a handful of domestics and other well- known craft breweries. Looking at the menu, I was tempted to order the Miles 10 Meat pizza but didn't have the stomach to do it.... seriously, I was so damn full. But the Miles 10 is cheese and 10 meats. Yes 10 MEATS and no stupid veggies to ruin the heart attack pie. Topped with proscuitto, capicola, pork, bacon, and more, this is definitely going to be a go to spot of mine next time I'm in Vegas just for that pizza. 

The place is pretty small (but hey, it's located inside shops) and I hated to see it closed at 11pm. Maybe it was just the time of year we were there, I'm not sure. But all in all, if you are looking to grab a beer and some grub, this is definitely a spot to go - heads up, be sure to go during happy hour.

Typical ""American"" style pizza.  Not NYC.  Not Chi Town.  The pies are, dare I say, Pizza Hut on steroids.  Chewy, bready crust slathered with sauce, generously topped with quality ingredients, finished with an almost excessive amount of cheese.   Over the top in true Vegas Strip fashion.

Sauces are bold and flavorful.  The pies are well seasoned and not excessively oily thanks to the fresh (not processed) cheeses.  The ""Miles 10 Meat"" pizza with its outstanding three meat bolognese sauce and toppings of prosciutto, pepperoni pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola toppings is a meat lovers delight.  The ""Mushroom Ragu"" is another standout.  The perfect mix of earthy mushrooms paired with creamy, melted, fresh mozzarella.

All is not perfect, the crust in the middle of every pie so far has been soft from excessive sauce.  It becomes the stuff of legend if you like to indulge on cold pizza the next morning.

You can build your own pie from an extensive list of ingredients.  Slices are also offered along with salads, pastas, and sandwiches.

Service is fast and friendly.

Very good selection of beers on tap or by the bottle.  Prices are higher than it's Mandalay Place neighbors.

First off, as said by probably hundreds of people already, SoV is an awesome place for dinner for a group of vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meal. 

SoV's pretty decent. They messed up by giving us a buffalo vegan pizza instead of BBQ, but they were great about it and gave us a pair of free desserts, which they didn't have to do.

The truffle fries were super truffly and, best of all, free with check in (it says garlic parmesan but our waiter let us switch it up.) The two pizzas were good in their own ways. I can't really say which I preferred -- they were both good sizes, but the supreme was definitely more substantial with toppings. Above average tasting pizzas, but nothing earth-shattering. 

I was most intrigued by the cauliflower alfredo before ordering, and it turned out to be pretty good. I think everyone agreed it was decent (or better), but the strong rapini and garlic flavors were more reminiscent of Asian food than anything else to some who tried it. I enjoyed it, but it didn't remind me of alfredo. If you've got an open mind, give it a try. I don't know that I'd recommend it too highly with it costing $20 and giving me DEATHLY gas the next morning, but I enjoyed it. 

The dough balls were alright. They'd be really good with a scoop of ice cream. Half of the balls we got were still raw in the middle, but the ones that weren't were fluffy goodness. 

Our waiter was attentive but not overly so, and the beer selection is decent -- both winners in my book. 

What wasn't a winner was the magician who shouted for half our meal and was nothing but a distraction. My dude, we just want to eat and talk. After awhile he found some kids to entertain.. that was nice. Win-win. 

As I said already, SoV is a safe choice for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike in Las Vegas -- and it doesn't suck. Worth a look when you're staying at Mandalay Bay.",rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A,4,2,4,y4zwprMeDDIctj1dY8g7uQ

We ordered the garlic bread with pesto ($8) and the family sized 10 mile meat ($29.95).

The garlic bread was decent, though I like my pesto spread a bit chunkier where you can distinctly taste the pine nuts and parmesan. Overall, not a bad starter.

The pizza was good, not the greatest in town, but worth coming back to (especially with the restaurant.com deal $25 off when you spend $37.50. Can't beat that!). I like my crust all around to be a bit more chewy and airy...the rest of the pizza was very good, ample toppings. 

The service was friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean. 

+Bonus points for the parmesan condiment on the table being real parmesan (as opposed to the crap they hand you at a pizza chain).

I would return, not at full price, but def with the restaurant.com deal...it was a score.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,5,6,4,s-qU6W6vweG0bXNIs8TGvQ

5278095,2015-02-24,5,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"I've been to Slice of Vegas multiple times and for two reasons: 1) it's a convenient option to eat at right before a concert at HoB and 2) restaurant.com offers up a $25 off when you spend $37.50 certificate, making Slice easier on the wallet. 

Here's what I've had most recently:

PASTA FAGIOLI SOUP ($4.95): Progresso's canned vegetarian minestrone soup packs more flavor than what Slice of Vegas is serving up. I added Parmesan cheese, pepper, and salt to my petite bowl of soup to no avail. There simply was no saving this soup. 1/5

MEATLESS MEATBALL SUB ($13.95): Dripping with marinara, the sub was falling apart before my first bite. I'm already a messy eater- I don't need help. Meatballs were tasty though. 3/5
PRO TIP: You get to add a flavor (such as garlic-rosemary) to your fries at no cost! Fries were on point.

 ZEPPOLI ($7.95): Truthfully, I enjoyed Olive Garden's Zeppoli better. The dough was thick and super chewy, giving my jaw a workout. The added Cinnamon was an unexpected flavor, but the zeppoli just failed to deliver. 2/5

PRICE: On our last visit, dinner for two (even with 2 draft beers) came to $13 pre-tip after the restaurant.com gift certificate. 5/5, especially for the Strip!

AMBIANCE: It's usually noisy here, especially when you're seated towards the back of the restaurant. Decor sticks to a red and black palette and the restaurant has fun fixtures on the wall (like a bike!). Music goes between country and low-key rock. 4/5

CUSTOMER SERVICE: Average. 3.5/5

PROS: Vegan Menu and affordability
CONS: No bathroom in the restaurant, mostly underwhelming food

Return Visit?
For now, I've had my fill of Slice of Vegas. The only thing that has impressed me are the fries.

5278814,2014-08-19,1,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"Items Selected:
Pepperoni New York Slice - $3.95 
Mamma's Garlic Bread - $8.90 with Mozzarella - Italian bread infused with roasted garlic, brushed with more roasted garlic butter and accompanied with a roasted garlic head
'Choked Pig - $18.95 - Pesto aioli sauce, Mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, bacon and artichoke mix finished with chopped basil and a whiskey sour cream
Zeppoli - 8.45 with Caramel - Golden fried pizza dough balls tossed in a mix of cinnamon and sugar, drizzled with chocolate

Located in the Shops at Mandalay Bay close to the entrance of Luxor it was largely a matter of their participation in restaurant.com's discount program that led me to Slice of Vegas and having received $100 in gift certificates to the website nearly one year prior it was with $25 towards a minimum $37.50 purchase that I sat down at a rounded booth made for four, the USA vs. Brazil basketball game and Dallas Cowboys preseason matchups playing on televisions beneath the din of some forgettable pop songstress.  Billed as a space for ""Fun Italian Dining"" with a take-out station to the left and bar-full of craft brews tucked behind it was just moments before 7:00pm that I took my seat and with the majority of diners tourists with small children the scene was decidedly rambunctious, a duo of servers including the young woman in charge of my table clearly struggling to keep pace with large orders despite efficient back-servers helping to bus tables and refill water.  Unapologetically overpriced like the majority of Strip-side dining it was only after a few questions regarding the possibility of a half-and-half pizza (no for specialties, okay if you build-your-own) plus  a description of the daily specials that I eventually placed an overzealous order and with an appetizer slice of foldable New York style thin-crust quickly arriving from the exterior facing window my first taste was quite favorable, the gentle crunch and pliable crumb on par with that at Pop-Up or Secret beneath a subtly sweet sauce and bubbling fresh mozzarella.  Moving next to mundane garlic bread that no Italian mother would likely lay claim to it was fast on the thick loaf's heels that my gourmet pizza would arrive and with ample toppings showing a keen eye for balance over the nearly cracker thin crust the meal was soon back on good footing, the punchy sour cream a particularly inspired pairing to mellow the marinated artichokes and herbal topnotes from the pesto and fresh basil.  At this point just shy of my gift-certificate minimum I was left with a decision between the restaurant's signature chocolate cake, a glorified brownie sundae, or balls of fried dough and opting for the later with a sidecar of caramel I'm confident to say I made the right choice - each of the seven cue-ball sized doughnuts perfectly crisp and virtually oiless beneath a hefty shake of cinnamon sugar as the duo of sauces jockeyed for position on the tongue's already overcrowded sweetness receptors.

Dramatically overpriced without the benefit of a 2/3 discount but featuring a more than competent slice along with the best Zeppoli I've yet to find in Las Vegas there are certainly worse options for quick casual dining on the strip and although neither service nor setting are likely to win any awards I'd happily come back to explore more of the menu if armed with another coupon, a distinct likelihood considering the general dearth of quality on restaurant.com ever since the rest of Mandalay Bay pulled out several months ago.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,3,3,8PU1QH-uANZm8eCmz5IA9Q

Yes, it's $4-5 slices of pizza - you're on the strip, get over it.  

The food was fantastic - good size slices, excellent cook on the crust, well seasoned and tasty.  It's pizza, it's not hard to do it right and they have done that.

The setup/service at the to-go counter is a disgrace.  If it's 12 to 1am on the strip and you're one of only two places still open in this walkway you need to get your staffing right.  I mean, who isn't plowing down pizza at that time anyway!   ONE poor guy there Saturday night doing the order taking, cashier duty, grab the slices, warm the slices in the oven, box them up and get them out to the customers.

It comes with a bulb of roasted garlic that you squeeze out the soften cloves and spread it on the toasty bread on top of the almond pesto. Perfection for my taste buds! http://bit.ly/2kssXHi

We also got an order of the Shoestring Sweet Potato Fries. It comes with options of seasoning. We went truffle style. I'm still undecided if I like the taste of truffle oil with sweet potato. This comes with a side of vegan ranch. http://bit.ly/2jXTjNG

The Back East Buffalo Pizza sounded unique to me. Gardein chick'n, celery, carrots, buffalo sauce and vegan ranch sounds like a good combination of flavors but I don't think I was digging it in pizza form as much as I thought I would. I think it was the pizza sauce mixed with those flavors. Doubt I would order this again but I could see how others might like it. One thing I did appreciate was the thin crust. http://bit.ly/2kTQFNb

Service was great! Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Food came out quick. I'd probably come back to check out the other items on the vegan menu.

5345131,2013-02-24,3,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"We had a free $25 restaurant.com certificate and chose to use it at Slice for no other reason than we saw it on the list of restaurants and recognized the name.  It was a Saturday night and the place wasn't too packed.  There were a few booths available but they sat us in one of those booth/chair combo tables where a bunch of tables are lined up in front of one long booth.  I explain this because it becomes an issue later on.  

We ordered drinks (good selection of beers.  My husband was happy to get Magic Hat #9).  We chose Mamma's Garlic Bread as an appetizer.  When it came out, the runner was going around to each table asking if it was theirs.  Ahh!  I want my garlic bread, come here!  Served on a small pan with a roasted garlic head.  Interesting and kind of waste of a garlic head if you ask me but I'm only a moderate garlic lover, not a garlic-loving freak who needs a side of garlic head lol.  But the bread was pretty good.  

For dinner I ordered a bowl of pasta(bilities) (haha, cute.  Yes, I'm easily amused) and chose rigatoni with the spicy marinara sauce.  The server asked me if I wanted to add a side of meatballs or a salad and I said no.  My husband ordered the meatball hero which came with fries, and he substituted regular for garlic shoestring fries.  I'm so glad he did - they were delicious.  Anyway, my meal arrived with 2 meatballs on either side of it.  I didn't order meatballs so I just scooped them off on to a side plate.  (Not a vegetarian, I just don't like things that are too ""meaty"".  heh.  I just walked into a bunch of one-liners, I'm sure.  But you know what I mean.)  The server apologized and offered to bring me a new bowl of pasta if I was a vegetarian.  I told her there was no need for a new bowl, but I was glad she offered. 

The marinara sauce wasn't bad but it tasted as though a lot of red pepper was the only reason it was ""spicy"" and not regular marinara sauce.  My husband enjoyed his meatball hero.  For dessert we had the sack of dough balls.  I thought these were going to be lighter, like zeppoles.  They could have been a lot more enjoyable if they had more cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on the outside and they didn't pour so much sea salt over the chocolate/hazelnut sauce. 

We're nearing the end of our meal and they seat a family of five right next to us... in a table of 4.  They did this on the side we were sitting on so a young boy wound up sitting RIGHT next to me as though we were in the same group.  This really didn't bother me except I thought that if I were that family I'd be pretty pissed that one of the kids has to sit in between two different tables.  We were almost done - they could have had the family wait 10 minutes to put two tables together.  And of course, I had to slide to the other side of my table to exit, which was only a small inconvenience but just made me annoyed that they would consider this setup in the first place.  

The prices were not over the top, but you just don't get enough ""wow"" for your money here.  A single cheese slice (which I didn't try) is $4.95.  The decor is very hip and environment is pretty chill.  There is an internet juke box and the music playing was very good.  Some classic rock and you could tell the bartenders skip over songs they don't like.  It could be good or bad depending on who's listening.  

Overall we probably wouldn't choose to come back unless we were in Mandalay Bay with others who wanted to try this place.  It was a decent one-time thing.  If you're there and you're feeling it, give it a shot.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,3,1,3,jSFRnmcJA4wRgBlKTilu4A

Service - we had a male server the first night and Franni (maybe Fani, can't remember her name) at the bar the two second times... they were both fantastic... particularly the bartender, engaging but not over bearing, attentive and made a great moscow mule... food always came out promptly and food runners did a great job... TV's are plentiful so its a great spot to just sit at the bar, drink and watch some games..

Food - awesome. We had the buffalo pizza, the bbq one, pasta, garlic bread and a  custom made noodle combo.. all vegan, all delicious... the roasted cloves of garlic on the garlic bread were amazing... pro tip, get the buffalo sauce and throw it on the garlic and pesto bread... you're welcome...

The plan was to get a slice but when that was $6, we decided to sit and have a whole pizza instead.  A small specialty pizza with a ton of toppings was $18 opposed to 4 slices for $24.  You can't get any more toppings than their ridiculous Miles 10 Meat pizza.  That's ""made with a bolognese mix of veal, pork, and ground beef, smothered in mozzarella cheese, and topped with prosciutto, pepperoni, pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola.""

Located  in the shops that connect Luxor and Mandalay, I ate at this place TWICE in one day. Ordered the vegan pie, garlic pesto bread, garlic fries and chocolate cake with peanut butter icing on the lunch visit. 

Lets start with Mama's garlic bread. Holy hell. This is probably the best garlic bread I have ever had. They give you a roasted head of garlic and the pesto on top is life changing. We ordered ours with Daiya as well. I just scooped out garlic (eventually resorting to squeezing every last drop of garlicky goodness from it's vessel) and spread it across the slices. It comes with four pieces of bread, so enough to share, if you are feeling generous. Well, everything we ate the portions were perfect for splitting.

Then the garlic fries. I don't know what kind of magical mayo like basil dip they came with as well as ketchup and a generous heaping of diced garlic sprinkled over top, but it draws you to it like a moth to a flame. The fries are super thin and cooked to perfection. Not over salted as often is the case with fries.

The pie. We ordered the 12"" vegan pizza with diced eggplant, zucchini, roasted pepper and Daiya cheese. It too, perfectly seasoned and portioned.

After all that, we still had room for the moist chocolate cake with whipped peanut butter frosting. Our slice was about 4 in. x 4 in. Atop a chocolate drizzled plate beside grapes rolled in sugar and a sprig of mint. It was nice to go from a well balanced and not overly sugary dessert to that little kick of wow. I have never once thought of doing that to grapes but it worked.

For my return dinner visit I ordered the vegan wings and more garlic, Daiya bread to go to eat on my return flight home. I was pleased to find I still got my roasted garlic in the box for the bread.

The wings were Gardein chicken strips with a sauce cup of buffalo sauce and one of ranch with carrot and celery sticks.  

Vegas is not a place I will be returning anytime soon but if I did, you better believe I would find my way back to this place. Much better than the Cantina a couple of doors down which also offers vegan options (3 star review to follow). I was also impressed our waitress Bianca, though not vegan herself and with us being her first vegan customers had been telling people that the cake was vegan after they'd eaten and raved about it. She said people often have stigmas about vegan food being disgusting and it's just not the case. :)",ELgL08GOBBlzCAA9TteQKA,2,2,5,O7m2iMolvhQXgqTP_HpO_w

My friend lysette was in charge of finding a restaurant to eat. She decided to come to this place since there was a lot of vegan choices for her. Which I love that this restaurant does this.

We decided to order: 
Not your mamma's garlic bread-the bread had roasted garlic with olive oil and pesto. I love pesto. It was super yummy. However, I didn't think it was worth 8 buck but don't get me wrong it was delicious.

House shoestring's fries: we decided to get our fries with garlic and rosemary. Fries are fries. Can't go wrong with them. 

Both appetizers were from the vegan menu which was great so we all got to share together. 

Switching over to the meat-eater menu:

Choked pig pizza-we ended up going with 18 in. It was very good. Thin crust just the way I love my pizza. All the ingredient all came together really well. The pesto, the mozzarella cheese, the tomatoes, the bacon, THE BACON, haha was yummy!

FOOD: 5/5
The food continues to be good. I actually liked the pizza I got last time so much that I got it again. My girlfriend got a chicken Parmesan pasta dish that I also liked a lot. They don't go wrong with the food here.

SERVICE: 5/5
My first time here had very poor service. The owner reached out to me after hearing about my experience and offered me to come back again for another meal on them to give them another chance. They had me set up a reservation so they know exactly when I was coming and they knew exactly who I was when I walked in. We had a very nice, bubbly waitress, Taylor, who was very pleasant. She knew her beers, which made it easy for me to pick mine for their large list of choices.
I was very pleased with this most recent experience, but I guess the real test of their service comes to when I come a third time to see if they treat me the same as this.

FACILITY: 3/5
No opinions changed about the facility, but I will say Mandalay Bay is certainly a nice hotel.

VALUE: 3/5
No opinions changed about the value.

5769825,2017-10-29,0,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"Ok.   I've been here before but I had never even thought to look at the vegan menu.   Boy was I missing out!  I was quite surprised and delighted by the sheer choice and quality of the vegan items.  The regular pizzas I've had here before were not bad so I'm glad the vegan items can hold up. 

The pizza crust isn't my favorite.   Maybe a little too much like cardboard (lacking a bit of flavor and kind of dry) but it served its purpose and I enjoyed my pizza.

The vegan Alfredo was delicious!  Very creamy and it did not have that sulphur smell/ taste that some cauliflower items tend to have.   I don't like replacement meat so I did not enjoy the ""chicken"" but I'm sure others would. 

Also, it's not advertised but the chocolate cake on the dessert menu is vegan as well.   Delicious! 

I live in Vegas so I try not to eat on the Strip but I will say this is a great place to come to when attending an event at Mandalay bay.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,4,y4ZVUunq4_COsqlQcu_NDA

Granted, we went to the deli area to get some slices to-go to eat in our room since we had crawfish for dinner like five-hours prior but does it make that much of a difference to dine-in?  Apparently!

For $21-something, we got three giant slices of pie [one Hawaiian, one veggie, and a meat combo].  The pizza itself was thin and soggy and all the toppings were on the verge of sliding off and into my lap.  Not a great start.  While the bites with toppings and cheese had okay flavor, once you hit the crust, it's game over.  Tasteless!  

Slice of Vegas is quick and speedy but they could use some work on developing more flavor.  What I would have done for a packet of crushed red pepper.  Meh!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,14,13,2,QDjr-klI9FUjB2MSn1zdHg

5823982,2017-03-28,0,lKq4Qsz13FDcAVgp49uukQ,"After 2 days of heavy drinking, a group of 4 dudes (Mr. Bloewen, Mr. Booth, Mr. Buxton, and myself) were looking for an early lunch.  We teetered on an all you can drink buffet and Mandalay, but though for the better to avoid that.  After Buxton was refused service at Burger Bar the night before, we elected to try out the nearby Slice of Vegas.

We were unsure of what to order, and our waiter was hard to find.  We were the only people in the establishment, since they just opened, but the waiter was either busy playing with his phone in the back, or just didn't want to talk to us.  We had to yell at him everytime to finish talking as he quickly was walking away.

We ordered an appetizer of french fries that were good and hot.  We were all in the mood for pizza so asked the waiter what size we should order.  We are 4 average built guys.  His response was, ""I've seen some people eat a large all by themselves, and some split it with 4-5 people.""  Gee, thanks a lot, Guy.

Without any help, we tried ordering the large pepperoni, and know we could order more if that was not enough.  If you are in doubt, I will say that it is more than enough for 4 dudes.  We were all stuffed, and didn't even finish one piece.  The pizza was also extremely greasy, and completely mediocre.  I think that I have to say Domino's is better than the Slice of Vegas.

I am highly doubtful for the continued existence of this restaurant, and assume that it will be replaced (go out of business) soon.  If the quality was higher, i would be more hopeful.",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,0,0,2,N8IhSqooR87LVbGdw97BdQ

I ordered the gnocchi with alfredo sauce and my fella got the barbecue chicken pizza. He really enjoyed his pizza, despite the $19 price tag for a single serving. My gnocchi wasn't bad for price and taste. I would probably order it again, since it's not too expensive.
