1275801,2018-02-02,0,zPBccKsIHYtLUGFNYIi8Uw,My family and i thought we would try this place out bad idea. I dont recommend this place. Lets start with the food not being fresh most the food was a bit cold not even room temperature. Then the selection was poor few items where put out at a time and the food was bland no flavor. Last but not least we all had an upset stomach the following day. Dont waste your time!

1821664,2018-01-15,5,zPBccKsIHYtLUGFNYIi8Uw,"Having my sister put her food on her plate back is NOT RIGHT!  It was our first time at this place due to great yelp reviews and with us are my two sisters visiting from San Diego. How embarrassing and bad treatment of them! We arrived at approximately 2:45 pm and we paid for the lunch fee not knowing that they will be serving the dinner items shortly. My sister got up to get more food, which is poor quality, and when one of the attendants saw she had three Oyster shells on her plate, this lady told her she cannot eat them because they are only for dinner and ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR THE DINNER FEE CAN EAT THEM. My sister was not aware that the item she took is for dinner and apologized, but the lady took her plate away from her. This should have been explained to us when we paid. Someone should have told us that dinner will be served shortly and if we would like to pay for dinner items since we arrived close to dinner time, we could pay for the dinner fee so we can enjoy the dinner items. Naturally, my sister felt embarrassed as there were other customers around her and saw this. They made us feel like we were there to steal their poor quality, salty, over cooked food. 
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE AT ALL. POOR QUALITY FOOD, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WHO TAKES A CUSTOMER'S PLATE AWAY FROM THEM DUE TO THREE SHELLS OF OYSTERS?!?!?!!!!!",-aV7azrzW2rlAm6G4DA-cw,18,2,1,qWUFpaeOXJkc9bAAwMKcYg

1993698,2018-01-06,2,zPBccKsIHYtLUGFNYIi8Uw,"The food is not worth the price. Do not waste your time here. We had high hopes since we love sushi and Asian food but this place was disappointing.

The venue and food are forgettable and most of the dishes aren't great.

The buffet has little to no variety compared to other buffets of the same price.

The buffet advertises a wide selection of sushi but there are only about 12 plates of sushi available, and most of them have the same ingredients (lots of them vegetables, rarely fish).

The seafood selection is subpar. The crab legs they serve are bland. Other dishes with seafood such as shrimp and fish are okay. I tried around 20 dishes and only found 5 to be good enough for a second helping. We came on a Saturday and paid 12.85 per person plus tax. Regretful since the food isn't worth that price. Even if the bill was 5 per person I still wouldn't come here.

Desserts were also lacking. Only around 6 desserts and the 4 I tried were either tasteless or disgustingly sweet. They have a soft serve station but other than that nothing in terms of sweets. The salad bar lacked variety.

Venue is okay. The restaurant walls are pink which looks odd with the rest of the decor. The tables were surprisingly clean and the buffet as well.

Only good thing about this place is the staff. Cashier and hostess were warm and inviting. The service was pleasant but not exceptional. Not their fault the food is bland.

The amount of empty tables at this restaurant speaks volumes. There are other places that have more variety and better dishes for the same price. Don't waste your money here.",hcdE412Ip1mArB3QWLI7aQ,1,0,2,zQdCS8l_rq1dWEYze2ObEg

2529252,2018-05-14,4,zPBccKsIHYtLUGFNYIi8Uw,"Two words: Thunderously Mundane. 

I thought this buffet would be the same as the popular Kirin Buffet in the California Arcadia mall in Los Angeles, but I, and my family were sadly mistaken. Don't get me wrong it could be with the $7.50 for an all you can eat buffet on a non holiday, but today was Mother's Day and it was $12.50 a person all day. Upon entering we paid and the 6 of us were quickly seated. After seeing a couple of the employees cleaning tables and refilling drinks with the same dirty hands, one of our party said ""I'm not sure if I trust the water here, so let's get soda."" We agreed and ordered sprites and a couple cokes.

The food variety was good but quality was par at best. I tried sushi since they tout a sushi buffet and Chinese food. The salmon nigiri was falling apart and mediocre, the shrimp tempura roll had a tail sticking out of the end but the two middle pieces were hard tempura only. The Kung pao chicken was edible and the fried cream cheese wonton was good. The spring rolls and potstickers were hard and barely edible. The wasabi bowl was getting hard and obviously not very fresh. The fried banana was ok. The scallop shells were a tease as the shell was topped with only vegetables and baked. They did have clams and  baby crab legs, which equaled a lot of work to get the little meat they would yield. The beef and broccoli and orange chicken here made Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. I don't like to write negative reviews but I do want others to know what to expect, especially if they know the name of this restaurant in Los Angeles. Even the fortune cookies were more like statements than fortunes :-(...

To try and compliment some items here, I would say the red bean sesame ball and the macaroons were both very good 4/5. The French fries were ok 3/5. They also had an ice cream machine with cones. The honey wonton crisps were good 4/5.

Overall, not the cleanest of restaurants and the family was completely underwhelmed by the food. Sorry, we won't be returning here.",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,8,5,2,fN09iS5GdKbjpHNufGp4Cg

I was expecting more based on some reviews and photos but sorry this is just not for me. 

They also have a weird system labeling the food with some post saying LUNCH and DINNER. So if you came in sometime around 3-4pm and paid for LUNCH you are not allowed to take some dinner dishes. Like WTH? I never been to a buffet like such but I guess it's *the system* can come up with? So beware if you make a mistake about Lunch and Dinner labels, they will take those food away from you.

They have proved me wrong. Even affordable buffet places like this can actually offer you great quality food.
Their food was just ""right"" when it comes to their seasonings and texture control. Most buffets' food would either be too salty, too soggy, or too dry since they are making a lot of food and thus don't have enough time for quality control. This place, on the other hand, actually cares about the small details in their food. Not only their food was great-tasting, even their texture was on point. I haven't tasted anything here that was too salty, and my tongue is very sensitive to saltiness.
Out of all the dishes I have tried here, I only disliked 2 of them. But that's just the way it is, they can't be perfect.

I did go at lunchtime when they had only been open for 30 minutes; however, I've been to other buffets where the food looked like it had sat there for hours just after opening for lunch.   The food variety is mainly what you would find at an Oriental buffet, although I did see a few things I had not seen before, and there were plenty of sushi offerings next to the desert table.  Service was fast and seating area was clean and comfortable.  Only $8.88 for lunch on a weekday and that includes drinks with refills.",1Qg_ZiwEQHpEZNkRxegmAg,1,0,5,Pa9TZEc47S9JwYg7i4JqTg
