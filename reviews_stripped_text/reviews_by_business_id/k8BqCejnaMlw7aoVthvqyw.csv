6048,2011-06-04,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,I totally agree with these positive reviews- old school Vegas style that us locals sometimes forget. It warm and inviting. And live music-- ya just never know who you'll bump into. And just wanted to suggest the pizza for tasty takeout-- far better than one of the pizza chains! Still quick and much better variety of toppings that are fresh not canned. And they love garlic like I LOVE garlic!! Yum mm my!,snBLOw_NEhslK_LSlp48OA,0,0,4,lveRcvN_2Fw8wlFhIXlOgg

It gave me that old Las Vegas feel which made the entire dining experience just great. We walked to the front & a young Man by the name of Roman assisted us to our table. He had to be the most sharp knowledgable young man I have ever encountered. We asked him what is good on the menu & he gave us several suggestions ... It was apparent he was very aware of everything on the Bootleggers Menu. We ended up playing the safe route and went with the classic spaghetti!! Amazing, Roman had told us that the meatballs were some of the best in town & he was not wrong.

When seated the waiter brings delicious in house made signature bread with a dip, be careful not to get full too quickly and save space for the actual meal. As appetizer try the eggplants with parmesan. The lasagna is fresh and soo good. The real test in Italian restaurant is the tiramisu and the Bootlegger did not disappoint, so give it a try and go hungry because they serve plenty of food.

Both were a little overcooked but good the mashed potatoes and the spinach were very good. We finished up with my favorite dessert, creme brûlée; this was not up to par. The custard wasn't set properly and the brûlée wasn't torched correctly what a letdown. 

As far as the service goes it was just so so.

100401,2010-11-16,3,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"What a disappointment! Maybe this review is biased but I'll tell you why and let you take it into consideration. Las Vegas is my hometown, I moved away several years ago but my family is still there and I return a few times a year. After my father sold his restaurant my family would go to the Bootlegger Restaurant when it was located on Eastern Avenue. I always enjoyed their food. That location closed and they are now the Bootlegger Bistro on the south strip. The first time I went there it was for lunch on a Saturday with the entire family....my sister and her kids, my brother with his wife and kids and myself. We were all seated in a party room but they never told us that the ""sisters"" would be rehearsing their lounge show singing act. It was loud and they couldn't sing very well, not a good experience. My brother apologized because he highly recommended this place and said their food was worth it. The food was pretty good still but listening to the sisters still gets a laugh when ever I bring it up. We've had other meals at the Bistro over the years and seemed to be going down hill over the years until the last time. 

When my (then) girl friend and I decided to return to our hometown and get married last January we settled on having the reception at the Bootlegger Bistro, not only because my family had been meeting there for years but because one of the part owners was a high school friend of both of ours. On the night of our reception the service was rushed and rude at the begining when they were serving drinks. At one point my wife was standing in the way of one of the servers while serving a drink and the drink ended up on my wife's wedding dress. The server looked at her like it was her fault for not getting out of her way. The food took forever to be served, I think it was because the drinks were seperate and they were trying to make more money out of my guests. We finally got served. I had the Seafood Fra Diavlo. I only got half way through my meal and had to run to the bathroom. Later I heard that others had the same symptoms, needless to say it wasn't a good experience on my wedding night and for a few days after. Because they were late in serving dinner they rushed into clearing the dinner plates before people were done eating. Maybe that was a good thing. 

The part owner of the Bistro was also a friend of a few of our guests so when we arrived we all asked if Ron was there. We was there but after waiting to see him all evening he couldn't pry himself away from his band and recording studio to say hello to his old friends. I dropped over $1000 in his restaurant, got sick in his bathroom and he didn't have the common courtesy to say hello. I held off on writing this review because I didn't want to write angry. It's been almost 10 months and I can't wait anymore. I'm Italian and I guess some things I won't get over. If you are thinking about having you're special dinner at this place be warned.....they don't care about anything but your money.",ZQyOz3H-dZ88qg1jEKSjLw,6,0,2,7KEKd-fQ6QF2ss3l6wkf4w

208456,2015-07-02,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"You know how they say first impressions are everything, in many cases they truly are. I planned a Wednesday girl's night out (6 of us) for mani/pedis and drinks afterwards at Bootleggers because of it's proximity to Vanity Nails & Spa (which was wonderful and great prices). I called ahead on Tuesday to first verify that they had a separate lounge area from the dinning area so I would know if reservations would be necessary. When I spoke to the waitress on the phone she let me know that they were indeed separate spaces so I did not make reservations. 

On Wednesday the Girl's night of mani/pedis went as planned, wonderfully, then off to Bootleggers around 6:30pm on a Wednesday. We had to stop and ask someone how to find the entrance first, they had outdoor seating but there were no doors open on the north side. We stopped what was apparently a phenomenal piano guy that provided us direction to the street facing entrance (mind you we hadn't even started drinking yet). 

We walk into the entrance and saw a dinning sign that stated to wait to be seated so we moved past to the bar lounge area where a sign said seat yourself. The bar was full so we started looking for an open lounge table next to the bar. Many of the tables were reserved so we found the first one that wasn't and sat. 

We sat there for less than 5 minutes and a waiter walk up to us and asked how many were in our party, we replied 6 total. He then followed up that the ""lounge"" table we were seated at was reserved and we would need to wait 40 minutes to be properly seated. Mind you there was no room at the bar so already Girl's night was coming to an awkward silence. What were we to do, awkwardly wait in the hallway for all the 50 something's to finish dinner so we could be ""properly"" seated or head out and find a new spot. Needless to say we left for Buffalo Wild Wings where there was plenty of bar seating and Girl's night could resume. 

I'm not writing to say that Bootlegger's isn't good, from all the recommendations on this site it would appear the garlic bread and marinara are fabulous but through some haphazard, awkward and confusing encounters or lack there of I won't be back and nor will the other 5 girls. I don't know if it's a ""woman"" thing or a ""personality"" thing but when go into a restaurant/bar lounge with no greeting or direction and I try to figure out what to do based on signs and logic and it doesn't work out in my favor I tend to not ever want to revisit that location.",teawO4sIFzeL1Cf9tNrClg,2,0,1,o5ZAQMzej-LMP7w3jyjtCg

217476,2015-07-26,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"While I was impressed with the feel and decor of the restaurant,  I was disappointed with the prices, the value for the price and the quality for the price.  We arrived with a large group which had many from different walks of life to include at least 1 waiter from competition.  I was shocked to learn that their early dinner choices came with salad included but since we weren't there during that time,  salad was not included with the meal.  My date and I had chosen to order iced tea which cost $3 each,  we did not get a refill throughout dinner. I had the Pollo Angelo which was good but not great and at $24 I expected great.  My date ordered pizza which had a disclaimer of taking 30 minutes to cook abs which he tried to order early so we did not delay anybody else's meal.  We had to ask for a bread refill several times with only receiving the requested refill once, again a sign of an inattentive waiter like the iced tea.  We ordered the cannoli for dessert and for $7, I expected more wow with the taste (presentation was fabulous). And since we were part of a big group,  18% gratuity was automatically added to the check,  which I felt for service was closer to 15% with even that being generous for the service provided.  I understand we were a large group but I felt treated like a guaranteed gratuity. Dinner took 2 and a half hours from being seated to being finished which again felt a little excessive.  I understand that people have off days and perhaps that was the case for the waiter but I will have 2nd thoughts about giving this place a 2nd chance.",FtX2beq_MpUdE6rwdaCNwA,0,1,3,yjBOlI6p1g0cUfuy6rIW4w

My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.

You sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.

I was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.

The card was our choice of a free app or bottle of wine. We were seated right away which was great because I was cold from walking in a dress and heels to the place and was pleased to get to sit right away. It is a 24 joint with a wonderful atmosphere. I loved hearing the singer/piano player throughout the meal. There were several groups there for birthdays and such and he sang to them. The table next to us had several people at it and they must have ordered a whole cheesecake for the birthday girl. We chose the wine even though the waiter said he recommended the apps and said the wine was bad. I disagreed and enjoyed it. We chose a white Chardonnay. Maybe he just thought it was cheap but I liked it and my husband didn't complain. It was a wonderful pregame to the Silverton we were going to after dinner. The waiter told us about our favorites and said if we came with the classics on our mind that was fine but that they had some unique things too. I went with one of the unique ones and it was yummy. I don't remember the name of it but it was a chicken rolled in salami with cheese and came with a nice side of pasta Alfredo. I loved it but didn't finish. My husband got the Lasagna and liked it too. I didn't bother tasting his because mine was so good but offered him some so he could try it.He liked it too. I just had a wonderful time getting buzzed and enjoying the scene while eating one of my favorite types of food-Italian! Price wise-not cheap not expensive. Depending on what you got it could be expensive but my dish was $24 for the unique dish. Rick's was less for the typical dish. We enjoyed the free wine greatly and was too full for dessert.

Looked up the menu online before we went, and a window popped up inviting me to join their VIP club and get a free entree or bottle of house wine with purchase of two entrees. Great, I signed up. When we walked in it smelled funky, like they'd recently had a flood and the carpet didn't dry thoroughly. It wasn't immediately apparent where to go, the door we used entered into the bar. We located the front desk and as we approached it a server walked by and said ""Have a nice evening!"" We said ""We actually need to be seated"". Another guy in a suit who was walking away turned around and came back. I said ""Hi, two for dinner"" he said ""Reservation?"" I replied no. He grabbed 2 menus and gestured for us to follow him. Based on that welcome alone we should have just left. He seated us, dropped the menus and left. Our server, Shawn, came up promptly. He was very friendly and made some suggestions. I told him I had a VIP club coupon for wine that was emailed to me and he said ""Oh, you have to print that on paper and bring it in"" What?? I said ""You can't take the info off of my phone?"" He said no. Who the hell requires printed coupons anymore? I saw a show at Mandalay the night before without printed tickets! We ordered a wedge salad that was $14. It was good, but certainly not worth $14, it was pretty small. I ordered Chicken Picatta, husband ordered Chicken Marsala. Both came with Fettuccine Alfredo. When the plates came the chicken was in 3-4 small pieces, like they pounded a few chicken tenders and sautéed them. My picatta had very little if any lemon flavor. My husband said his Marsala was okay. At $23 per entree they were reasonably priced had they been great. The alfredo sauce was all pooled under the fettuccine, it didn't have enough body to cling to the noodles. The highlight of the meal were the small garlic rolls with marinara sauce they brought shortly after we sat down. We were talking to some local people we met the next day and they recommended going to Nora's or Capo's for Italian. Next time.",oxxH2MpFscZPjBmPoDFk7Q,0,0,3,6dRBqNE9Hm5udyWBZbFK9w

The pianist then dedicated a song to them and sang it beautifully. The food is always delicious but that special treatment that wasn't expected made their anniversary truly special. The server really does have the ability to make your experience dining out better than you could ever imagine. Tralan was awesome and we are grateful that he was our server on that special night who took notice of something very special to our family.,jiEtuDBaiemQ7652DelIkg,0,0,5,cjZmq3l3w_uyweGIWkGzDg
324099,2014-10-30,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,We found this place a few years ago when we were looking to escape from the noisy Las Vegas strip and relax and enjoy some quiet time and good food and maybe some local live music. We were so lucky to find everything we were looking for when we found The Bootlegger Bistro and it's now our favorite place to visit when we are in Las Vegas! We love the romantic atmosphere and old world charm of the place. We especially love the beautiful piano playing and singing by talented musicians and of course we love the food! The best Italian food anywhere! The baked penne with meat sauce is incredible and we love the bread and dipping meat sauce! Excellent service and friendly waiters and bartenders make it a perfect place to dine and relax!,mzjERGOup8YQ_DCWwLTosQ,0,0,5,CrbeuwRzlWTgJaSobbNonA
329462,2015-02-17,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Did some research on a nice Valentine's Day dinner off the strip. Wanted to try something different. Read the reviews on Yelp about Bootleggers and most seemed pretty good. After visiting this place I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

The food is terrible. I'm not sure I ever had a worse Italian meal. Everything on the cold Antipasti plate must have been purchased at a supermarket. Nothing fresh! It came with pieces of Oscar Mayer style Salami and Bologna, canned artichoke and peppers. Sadly that was the best part of the dinner.

Ordered the Chicken Marsala with Ziti and meat sauce. The Ziti with the meat sauce comes on the same plate as the Chicken Marsala which isn't the best way to do it because the two sauces run into each other. That was the least of the problems with the dish though as the Marsala sauce was a watered down mess. The meat sauce wasn't much better. The thick piece of chicken wasn't cooked in the correct way either.

My date ordered the Veal Osso Buco and when they brought that out I thought it must have been a joke. Four tiny medallions of veal that I'm not even sure was on the bone. It looked and smelled so terrible she didn't take a bite. I did however and regretted it as it tasted like a TV dinner Salisbury steak. 

To be fair the place was packed, the service was good, they had a great lounge singer and people around us seemed to be enjoying their meals.  However there must be better Italian restaurants on the strip. A couple of locals recommended Battista's Hole in the Wall if your looking for old school Italian place that actually serves good food but unfortunately I didn't have the time to try it out so I can't confirm.

I will sum up this review like this-If your looking for a great old school Italian meal similar to what you get on Arthur Ave in the Bronx NY then this in NOT your place. If your looking for a authentic looking Italian place with good music and Olive Garden style food then you found your place.",NPfuUc1RAxMxmIBMqGE9DA,1,1,1,ysLuOe9_yuBJnpP6js9HJA

Every time I called, the event manager was not in and I was told to call back later. After a month of trying to call, one of the managers gave me the email address to contact Denise the events manager. She was out of town, so I spoke with Ron. Ron said come in any time and someone will show me the room. My mother-in-law and I went there, FELL IN LOVE with the room, and spoke to 3 people who said it was a Wednesday and its slow and no reservations have been made for 12-12-12. I finally got an email back from Denise a week later, and she told me the date is open, people have inquired, but no one put down a deposit. She also sent me a contract which stated the prices on the web site. When I went to call her, she was at a wedding show, and would not be in until monday. So Danny showed me the room again, and took my $1,000 deposit. After a few more emails trying to contact her to set up a meeting so I could pay in full the rest of the package, she emailed me back saying she would only rent the room to me if I paid $150 a person which would come out to $15,000! (because of the 12-12-12 date). I called her and basically got the reason why : Another couple who inquired AFTER I put down the deposit was willing to spend $150 a person. So I was BACK BURNER because my package was just a basic package stated on the website and they could make more off of someone else. WOW.....they don't honor their deposits! And they don't care if you have family that got invitations flying in from all over the country..... or that you hired a celebrity entertainer that doesn't return deposits. 

Denise did say that she would return my deposit in check form, but I paid cash so I called Danny and he pressed to give me cash back.

Unfortunately,  they lost more than my business over this. A lot of people who were coming most likely would have rented the venue for business on a monthly basis. Or that they could use my celebrity entertainer as a marketing tactic. I will warn them NEVER to book the copa room because of this terrible experience. And the grooms family who have been customers since the 80's will never eat there again.",GVRHtgCRhD0ufbHfIVKxtg,6,0,1,UMH2Xbj6FaiGReMk6qkwqg
371936,2015-01-27,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Decided to try Bootlegger on a recommendation from a friend.  Definite atmosphere of Old Vegas complete with red leather chairs, piano and lounge singer.  She sounded very good!

I was in the mood for a baked dish and couldn't decide between lasagna and baked penne.

I decided on the house blue cheese salad and their recommendation, the lasagna.  I also had an Italian Mule which was a great start.

The salad was very good, plenty of blue cheese dressing with mixed red and green lettuce.  They brought some bread bites as well.  The bread bites were good, but I added some salt to give them a little flavor.  The marinara dipping sauce wasn't bad but I like tangy or sweet and it was a little bland.

When the lasagna came, it was a generous portion, however it was different than any lasagna I've had before.  Most lasagnas are layered with pasta, cheese, beef or sausage, sauce, then another layer, etc.  This was a large, concentrated mound of meat on the right (probably sausage and beef combined), a lot of cheese on the left (I'm sure ricotta and ?), and one piece of pasta covering the top.  I'm not certain this was the way it was supposed to be or if this piece somehow got cut incorrectly but the flavors were completely separate from one another and didn't have that good lasagna combination of flavors.  It was also too little pasta for a lasagna dish. I ate some but since it wasn't what I expected, I wrapped up the leftovers.

I considered dessert but decided to forego it for another time.  I will try the baked Penne next time and see how that is.  Overall it was 3 stars.",3m190IWHASheEZ-j9zOqCQ,0,0,3,Cpe4GVBZZfS7UMF9kkSrTA

We arrived at 3:55 pm for a 4:00 pm reservation and we were not seated until 4:20 pm which was a bit annoying especially with 2 small children eagerly awaiting their dinner. Once seated our drink order was taken and served relatively quickly. We waited another 15 minutes before we saw our waiter again to take our meal order, then another 10 minutes to receive the bread and marinara dipping sauce. This was always my family's favorite part of the meal in previous years, however this time the ""marinara"" sauce was poorly seasoned and watery. A major disappointment. We shared a caprese salad for an appetizer that was decent. For our meals we ordered Osso Buco, chicken parmesean, bolognese, and MEAT ravioli. Now I emphasize meat ravioli because this is where the major service concern lies. The initial ravioli that was served was cheese ravioli, not what we ordered. After bringing this to the waiter's attention he apologized and quickly returned with a replacement serving of ravioli, once again it was cheese ravioli and not the meat ravioli that was ordered. Another 10 minutes elapse and finally the 3rd plate of ravioli comes out but alas the meat inside the ravioli is stone cold. Once management is notified they apologize profusely and offer to fix it but at this time we are so turned off by this repeated display of poor service that we simply forego the ravioli altogether.
Management did not charge us for the ravioli and they gave a 30% discount off of the entire bill and a free dessert.

God forbid she checks on the 2 customers she has at the bar who may need something..
Swing shift is pretty terrible too. The two blondes behind the bar need to be replaced as soon as possible..

Incompetent to Rude Hosts (I think one is the Owner) After arriving on a Monday Night at 7PM as a group of 5 without Reservations and a Huge Wedding Party we thought the place would be Too Busy, however we were told it would be 5 to 20 minutes for a Table and so we waited in the entrance area with group that Did have Reservations at 7:00 PM.

We Both were seated around 8:30 pm, no Apologies - Just Arrogance. It was a Table for four with a chair crowded onto the end in the walkway. Two of us ordered the same item and 20 minutes After ordering we were told there was only One Available. 

So even though it was my wife's Birthday Dinner, she gave it up and ordered a Simple House Salad instead, while I just Ordered Soup out of frustration. The other three in the Party got the dishes they wanted and the food finally arrived at 9:30PM - two and a half Hours after we first entered the place.  Even their Garlic Rolls were not refilled after initially bringing a small bowl for five people - I guess they were hoping they could sell appetizers.

I have many times taken out of town guest there, always Arrogance and Drama and some waiting, Yet Never again. Even my out of town guest stated after we left and all we had been through they would never recommend this Restaurant to anyone and tell them to be sure to avoid it. 

They have enough business and they don't care - so why should We. 
If you go for the Food, it's above average, however be prepared for Arrogance and Long waits with a (Owner) Host that always makes the place Frantic.",V4D4x4QtDB-tmXkwdxgwDA,3,1,2,FWWL3s1Y49wMuqyjlWNbAg

The Piano Player in the other room was a nice touch!  Sat at a machine and ordered a drink.   And again I think the bartender needed a shot of happy or a red bull at least.  Looked at the menu and ordered the eggplant bruschetta togo from the bartender.  Finished my drink and my gaming.  Then moved to the other side of the bar to another machine and had to ask for a drink (and I'm tipping as I go).  That side of the bar was friendlier; the busser guy was more friendly and said hello.  I was bought ready to get out of there when the bartender said do you want your food?  It's over there.  Nice!

However it is added to your bill for $25, then they tax and tip it +18% and plus 10%, and then take the $25 off.  You ultimately pay $7-$8 for it.

Let's get to the real issues.

My wife is very particular about raw meat. She eats nothing less than little pink with brown.  I went through the motions of having the waiter describe what medium is, (red with pink), and medium well is (little pink with brown).  My wife was delivered a raw steak bleeding on the plate.  We asked for flash fry... Plate came back extremely hot... It was microwaved.  Classy.

I was charged $12 to add shrimp scampi to my steak.  My steak came with an onion ring and 3 asparagus. No Scampi.  When the check came I asked about the $12, and he insinuated the scampi WAS on the steak.  This was soooo insulting.  I had to prove it did not come on my steak which was easy to do as I ate less than half as it was a tasteless NY bone off.  They have no steaks Bone-In.

The Antipasto salad  was also an issue.  I don't like olives, and didn't eat any and was fine.  My wife however threw up the whole night mostly olive and tomatoes... Maybe from the raw steak??? Who knows... My poor wife...

Lastly the auto gratuity for my family with 4 kids. (4, 6, and 8 years old)  Seems tacky to force gratuity on such a bad experience and mostly kids at the table.   It took over 10 minutes to get the check adjusted as he started over the bill to adjust the tax and gratuity.  Somehow with 4 kids the bill was over $200 after adjustments.  :( (reminding you there was no alcohol on the tab as the wine was ""free"")

Don't go here.  The food isn't that good, service even worse.  Waiters with memory of a goldfish and then insulting you by not letting you give a deserving tip.  With service this bad, forcing gratuity is the only way they would get tips.",btZU0xAESm78xzf9a1qsWg,5,0,1,ctjfA6S3VCmAcdq9A2P7XQ

The food is good, as well as the service.  We have had many enjoyable dinners and good times at the restaurant.  However, on Valentine's night, something occurred that still doesn't sit well with me.  This all occurred over a glass of house wine.  Yes, a glass of $5 wine.  I have told many people this story, including restaurant owners, business owners, and just your average family folks.  They all agree that what occurred should never have happened, and said it was bad business and just the wrong thing for the restaurant to do.  As a result, the restaurant lost a loyal and longtime customer, as our family will not be back.  That's what happens when you don't take care of people that take care of you.  I would have written earlier, but I was still too pissed off.    

In a nutshell, here's what happened.  My family ate dinner at the restaurant and the bill came to over $400, including a $58 tip for the waiter.  The food and service was excellent.  We gave the waiter an extra $40 cash tip.  After dinner and dessert, my niece showed up and ordered a glass of house wine only.  We stayed an extra 30-45 minutes after my niece arrived.  As we got up to leave, I looked for our waiter because we hadn't received a bill for the glass of wine.  I could not find our waiter, and made my way to the restroom.  When I exited the restroom, I saw that my family had already left the restaurant.  I walked outside to the parking lot, and was told by my family that our waiter had approached a family member asking for money for the glass of wine.  They told the waiter they thought it was paid for. The waiter assured them it wasn't.  My family then paid for the glass of wine.  How embarrassing that was for my family, and totally uncalled for.  We then left the restaurant.  I couldn't believe what had just happened.   

Now, we surely wouldn't walk out intentionally without paying for a $5 glass of wine.  Especially since we just spent over $400 for dinner, and gave our waiter a $100 tip, over and above the customary tip amount.  Really, chase a customer down for a $5 glass of wine?  The restaurant should have bought that wine, since it only cost them about 50 cents.  That's just bad business.  If anything, our waiter could've paid it out of his own pocket, considering the way we took care of him.  Anyway, that's not the way you treat people.  Waiter, I hope you and the restaurant learn from this costly mistake.",OV5ezbn0TYQj4VT-eujPHA,3,2,3,LJdkYre0FlZ4WzvSMV_NkA

Started with eggplant fritti which is lightly breaded eggplant with marinara sauce. There might have been a hint of cheese in it but it was so tasty and fresh. A great starter.

Next I had spinach fettuccine primavera which is broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic and zucchini with pine nuts in a light broth. There was a nice flavor of garlic through the dish complemented but the fresh taste of the beverages and the deep sweetness of the tomatoes. Served piping hot this dish exceeded all expectations and really reminded me why one can have a vegan dish and lose nothing over not having meat.

Had no room to try the dessert which was disappointing.

Additionally service was prompt, quick and courteous.

Aside from the typical cafes at the casinos, this is a pretty chilled place with classic Italian food. They've been opened 24/7 since the 1940s. A definite mom n pops shop kind of restaurant/bar. 

I had the cheese and meat ravioli with their special sauce. It's good and there's no complaint but of course I'm not like blown away. I would say that they're classic comfort Italian food. Aside from this we also had the steak & eggs with potatoes. This on the other hand was pretty amazing. The potatoes were well seasoned (herbs). Steak was pretty well marinated. A definite good breakfast. This is way better than Denny's or Ihops quality for sure.

1123289,2017-09-02,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"We all have a place where we swear has ""The best Italian Food Ever!"" Well, I did too. Then I came here... 

Why is it so good, you may be wondering?  

I wish I could describe exactly what was it about this place and the food that immediately made it my #1 spot for Italian Cuisine. I shall attempt to describe, yet I feel like my attempts at capturing the magnificence of this establishment with mere words on a page will not do it justice, but I will try

1) Food -  Obviously this is my number one reason for falling in love with the place. I have had great Italian food, that I assumed was amazing....on the first bite of a Spaghetti with Marinara sauce, the simplest form of Italian you could go, the flavors of ripe tomatoes, fresh herbs danced around in my palate. The texture of the al dente pasta was impeccable. 

I have been to numerous extremely expensive Italian Restaurants in Vegas and New York City...which while the food was great, it didn't shock and amaze me like the food here. 

I like to think that I have a refined palate for tasting foods yet I could not, for the life of me, put my finger on what made their sauce so unbelievably perfect. I will have dreams of this Marinara sauce for years to come. It is light, yet robust with flavor, no puree or canned tomatoes here I assure you. 

2) The ambiance - Every place you go to nowadays has the same style of decor and feel. You feel like just another body of mass in a place. Somehow this place made me transport back to the golden era of Las Vegas. When judging by the pictures online, I assumed it would be a fancy place, but not in the good sense, more in the ""snobby and stuck up"" sense, I was wrong. I felt like I belonged here (as much as a Latino can feel like he belongs in an Italian joint). I truly adored the booths and tables, so intimate, I can't wait to bring a date here. 

3) Staff - I wish I could remember the name of my bartender/server, he worked the Night Owl shift on Friday. He made me feel right at home, as if we had been buddies for years and i'm not talking about ""playing the friendly bartender"" so he could get tips, I could honestly see that he loved what he was doing. Very polite and down to earth person. 

As we talked he demonstrated the amount of respect he has for the food  they serve and for the family, it is very rare to find a place where the bartenders/servers actually enjoy working at. It's a sign management must be doing a good job and taking care of their people. 


Conclusion: I feel like my entire life has been a lie. What I imagined was amazing Italian food, turns out was just good. I'm upset it took me 2 years in Vegas to find out about this place (damn you locals for not telling me about it). Make this a bucketlist item.

The menu is not perfect and I have had to send dishes back on occasion, but nonetheless it's gives me that comfort of home. They have a constant movie running, the God Father, the machines are always bumping though I have never won anything, and there is a crazy bartender with silver hair he is probably late 30 early 40's and he completes the scene. The calamari is bomb, I usually order the linguine with clams in Alfredo sauce. I know you might be hesitant to try it but I can assure you it's so flavorful. I stuff my face in there without a second thought. Is there better Italian places? Sure, but I would rather go to Bootleggers and laugh with that crazy bartender, my co-workers, play the slots and watch my distant relatives get blown up shot and killed on the tv as I watch God Father, I just feel like I am back on the East Coast for an hour or two, nothing wrong with that!",GJA2e4QAlFHWRKVWbUsF4A,1,1,5,q-w-wtwQpwfX2lS6Bn6mKw

Our server was in training and being trained by someone who never provided her name, to keep it simple I'll call her ""The Trainer"". At the end of our meal we all asked for boxes. The Trainer brought three boxes, which was accurate, and it went downhill from there. The Trainer was standing right next to me holding the boxes, she began asking my friends about their meal, completely normal. My friends had the gnocchi and I had a Philly Cheesesteak. As the trainer was talking to my friends, she walked around the table in the opposite direction from me. She provided my friend to my right her box and proceeded to do the same for my other friend. As she stood at the opposite end of the table from me, I wondered if maybe she was just into the conversation and forgot to hand me my box. I soon found out. She sat the last box on the corner of the table, farther away from me than necessary. I waited a moment, thinking she would realize that she hadn't handed me the to go box. She never did. She watched me reached across the table, trying my best not to let my shirt fall into the food, to get the box. She never apologized and never acknowledged the fact that she didn't sit the box near me. Being black, I am aware that racism still exists. I was aware when I walked into the restaurant that I may have a negative experience. Despite my best efforts to remain positive, I was still proven wrong. I am not condemning the entire restaurant.

We always have the nicest service, I went a few days after getting my wisdom teeth out once I could eat normal food and our waiter suggested something soft. It's always pretty fast service in there, even when it's super busy. 
The bread they give you at the beginning with the marinara sauce is to die for...I always have to be careful because I'll end up filling on that before my meal is brought out! I've had the calamari too and it's a delicious appetizer.

Tonight my daughter wanted Italian after spending her tooth fairy money at the Disney store across the street. I recommended we go to Bootlegger since I hadn't been in so long!  She was hesitant since she has never been...I asked her to just trust me...

We were sat right away on a Saturday night!  Score!  The dining room was packed, we literally had the last available table.  

As we were just getting seated a man began singing and playing the keyboard on stage in the main dining room. My daughter was mesmerized by the atmosphere as an older couple stood up in the middle of their meal and began to slow dance. ""Mom, can people just stand up and dance in here?"" I giggled and said, ""yeah!  Isn't that cute?!""  She threw me the thumbs up and clapped really excitedly for the couple when the song ended. Cute. 

I ordered the Salmone, a grilled salmon (explained to me by our server as ""flown in fresh daily"") w/seafood ravioli and my daughter ordered the cheese raviolis from the kids menu.  We also split the Caesar salad. 

Honestly I thought the Caesar had too much dressing. But my daughter ate it all up!  If my kid will eat a full size salad and ask for more, I'm thrilled! 

Our main course took a while to come out, but like I said it was busy. When the food finally arrived it was hot, beautifully plated and I was very impressed with my meal. As my daughter started working on hers, she said, ""mom, I know why the food took so long. It's because they were making sure it was JUST PERFECT!  It's sooooo good!""  As she was finishing up her meal I asked, ""what's better, Bootlegger or Brio?"" she said ""Bootlegger!  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this place a 20 out of 10!  The kids ravioli was JUST enough for her. No leftovers and I wasn't begging her to finish another bite to earn dessert.  (Trust me, a real Mother's Day miracle!) 

Being that it was the eve of Mother's Day, I allowed her to pick a dessert off of the menu for us to share. Despite the pressure from both myself and the waiter to select the Lava Cake, she went with the Cheesecake drizzled in raspberry sauce. It was very good.

Our check was $66 including tip, not bad. Service was great despite the time it took for our main course to come out. The complimentary garlic bread they have come out is just as delicious as I remember, and their marinara is AMAZING. I'm not sure why I haven't ventured to this place for a meal during normal dinner hours, but with rave reviews from my little one and no complaints from me, we will definitely be back! 

P.s. The mannequin at the front used to freak me out!  Totally didn't even see it this time when I walked in but in the middle of dinner Chloe goes, ""mom, there was a really weird guy at the front when we walked in. He kept staring at me and I waved at him but he didn't wave back. Did you see him?"" I chuckled and said, ""that's just a mannequin, Chloe! Don't be scared. He's a statue and won't wave back to you."" She laughed at herself and said ""oh. I was really scared of that guy."" lol",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,7,4,5,Zay2MAoO3vS48UyXlo-D9Q

We ate--fettucine alfredo, eggplant parm, and manicotti. 
We drank--Mondavi merlot.  

The food and service were excellent and well priced.  The pasta was fresh and the sauces well seasoned.  The eggplant parm was light and crisp, not greasy.  The alfredo sauce had just a hint of nutmeg like I like it.  The ricotta in the manicotti was creamy and light.  Our server checked on us regularly (we were there for almost four hours watching the performances).  

We were not fans of the wine--it was flat and flavorless.  

The entertainment was fantastic.  Open Mic in Vegas means seeing stars have fun for free.  Highly recommend a Monday night visit.",oLt_fYaEzo3MVYbg_97dSg,1,0,4,75IVNfchyUAwZp12-nvf5Q

We had a reservation for 7:30, and got there at 7:00. Hung out in the bar while we waited and had a couple of glasses of red wine. The house red was very good. We got seated right near the piano, where a guy played classic Vegas music. My husband ordered the Veggie Lasagna, and he said it was the best he had ever had - even better than mine! What?!?! LOL! I had the Pollo Angelo, which was awesome. I told the waiter it was my husband's birthday, and for dessert he brought him the Chocolate Lava on the house, which tasted amazing, especially with our 4th glass of red wine :-) I would recommend this place if you like a darker, very romantic ambience for dinner. Food service, food, ambience all excellent!

So why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well, like I mentioned we got there at 7:00. I checked us in at the hostess desk, and she rolled her eyes and said: ""Your reservation is for 7:30, your early and I can't seat you until 7:30"". I said, yes, I know we're early, I just wanted to let you know that we are here. We will wait in the bar until you'e ready. She doesn't say anything, just points to the bar and looks back down to her reservation book. I started giggling, and thought, oh crap, I hope this isn't a prelude for the evening. Well, thankfully it wasn't. From the minute we headed to the bar until we walked out was fantastic!

1665288,2011-10-17,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Wasn't too impressed with this place.  

I went for lunch with a couple of friends and had gotten a seat out on the patio.  All the tables were quite dirty!  I understand that we were seated outside, however, I have eaten at other restaurants before where their patio seating is CLEAN...I guess it doesn't happen at this place.

Overlooking the dirtiness, I wanted to give Bootleggers an opportunity to prove my impression wrong through their food.  As the waitress came out, I saw that her uniform (which was black) was quite dirty also!  Her black apron and shirt was smeared with some red sauce (spaghetti maybe?) and white powder (cocaine maybe?)...Really not appetizing.  I did notice that the inside dining had very dim lighting, so maybe she didn't realize that her uniform was that dirty.  Nonetheless, it's not something I want to see.  

She took our drink orders and handed us the menus.  Even those were DIRTY!  A friend of mine had a coffee stain on his menu and we all had water/sauce stains throughout the pages....They should really clean those!  We should have left then and there, but NO!  I wanted to let Bootleggers redeem themselves through their food.

The waitress came back quickly with our drinks, complementary mini garlic rolls, and took our food order (she was quite friendly btw, which was a plus).  I had the mozzarella caprese and deep fried cheese ravioli.  

The garlic rolls were not really warm...well, let me take that back.  They were warm on the outside and cool on the inside.  Meh, let's say I wasn't a fan.  The mozzarella caprese and deep friend cheese ravioli were both were pretty good.  Nothing exciting or exceptional though.  The caprese needed more balsamic glaze.  They just squiggled three lines on the plate.  The cuts of mozzarella were nice and thick, so was the tomatoes.  The deep fried cheese raviolis came with marinara sauce.  There was a good crunch to them.  However, once again, these dished were forgettable...which is better than being bad dishes, I guess.

I heard the waiters bitch about it twice and the bartender kicked some extras out of their spot to let some other rude patrons sit there. That's unacceptable behavior! Whether bootleggers was paid to host this place for the show or offered it up for great exposure the staff shouldn't be taking it out on us background. If they have a problem they can take it up with the managers when the event is over. You can't kick background out of their seats when they are being filmed for so many reasons, most important being continuity. If it were me she would have told to move I'd have told her off and to take it up with someone else. She let her patrons disrespect the background extras as well, incredibly rude.

1755247,2014-10-07,3,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"After reading the reviews, I decided to have dinner at the infamous ""Bootlegger Bistro"". This place let me down. I was completely disappointed. 
NEVER AGAIN!!! Trust this review. 

For starters, the bread was good, but the marinara was terribly oily. I couldn't even dip the bread in the marinara, without my bread being drenched in oil. 

I ordered salmon Alfredo, with a side Caesar salad. The ceasar salad was good and fresh. Upon receiving my main food, I noticed it was a shrimp dish with pasta, which was COMPLETELY different from what I ordered. 

The server Stephen (who was really nice) advised me to keep my order, as the chef was preparing a fresh piece of salmon for me. Although I was upset about getting a completely different order, I had faith that Stephen would deliver.  As I ate the shrimp dish, I discovered that it was actually shrimp scampi (shrimp sautéed with garlic in butter, olive oil, and white wine and parsley over pasta) and not a creamy sauce like Alfredo is. So, for my server to replace the shrimp with salmon and leave the pasta, would have been pointless. I advised Stephen and he advised he would bring me salmon Alfredo. 

After receiving the dish, let me tell you....the salmon was seasoned and cooked to perfection and was pure deliciousness!!! . The alfredo on the other hand was NASTY!!!! It lacked flavor, was gluey, watery and tasted like it was out of a can. Uggghhhhh!!! Worst I ever had. 

I advised Stephen. Stephen apologized, bought the bill and advised he couldn't do anything about the dish, but took off my Caesar salad. At this time, I noticed the price of the shrimp dish was more than the salmon Alfredo, which is what he charged me for. I informed Stephen that I was charged more than what the I initially ordered. Stephen said, ""The shrimp dish and salmon is the same price. The bill is still correct."" I paid the bill and left the resturant. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I felt conflicted about what Stephen told me. I parked and walked back into the resturant and checked the price. I noticed I was charged more than what I had originally ordered. REALLY????? Stephen over charged me for my meal....and was too lazy and incompetent to charge me for the actual meal they F'd up!!!!! 

I advised the manager on duty, Roman who was completely unprofessional. I WILL NEVER eat here again. What a waste of money. If you want good Italian food, go to maggiano's or Giada's at the Cromwell.",onXW3feeMlULCH5z-ebyEA,3,0,1,9J7gp2VS6sJhD9361OzDTw

If you ever go to Vegas, this place should be on your list of places to dine. I've been here every time I visit Vegas and I've never been disappointed. My brother's wedding reception was also here and they still had stellar service. They are just south of the airport on Las Vegas Blvd, maybe 10 minutes from the strip if you hit traffic.

You sit down and before the second butt-cheek hits the chair, your bread is on the table. Very soon after that your water. I've had several different entrees there and every single one of them have been great! I love their breakfasts too.... especially at 2pm. LOL Their service is exceptional. Their food is always wonderful and I've managed to hook my family on this place too.

I was particularly impressed when they hosted my brother's wedding reception. Even though there was a selection of pre-determined items to choose from, because I'm vegetarian and not a fan of alfredo (thanks to my meat eating brother, this was the only veggie meal in his selection), they had no problem offering me something else and offering it to other people as a selection as well. I loved this. The only complaint I had, as my brother's photographer, was that the lighting was so dim, the pictures were hard to take.

The only thing I haven't had here is dessert. I'm going to have to change that.",LhQ9dbYxnawbAsQ1DVn79Q,1,0,5,VTRdCKw6cTkfvaTVRjstXw

Brittany was awesome in assisting me with deciphering the menu. Determined that the chicken marsala was in order, so I ordered that up. Came with a side of fettuccine Alfredo (delicious). I know you can drink marsala wine but seriously, if they would bottle this chicken marsala sauce I would drink it out of a glass or a cup or a shoe or whatever!

But the real winner in this whole breakfast/lunch/dinner was the bread basket. Think of little pillows of dough that are brought out to the table with marinara sauce... they was fantastic!

1772312,2015-07-30,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"The is old school Vegas Italian restaurant. The night we were there, they had a piano player (the vocalist who was scheduled to perform never showed up by 6:30 when we were finished eating even though she was supposed to go on at 5:30).
The Food: The food service starts with delicious hot bread on the table. It is accompanied by a red dipping sauce (don't remember what it was - just that it was very tasty). Very good and very easy to fill up on the bread if you are not careful. My wife and I decided to share the wedge salad to start. While I frequently get a wedge to start a meal, this had to be the biggest wedge I have ever seen. It was loaded with bacon pieces and lots of tomato with a good bleu cheese dressing. Very delish. Based on several of the reviews on Yelp, we decide to share the meat lasagna. The portion was huge - definitely dinner for two if you like to share. Lots of meat, lots of cheese. This was good but not great. We came to celebrate a birthday. Our waiter brought over a slice of delicious chocolate cake (see the photo - nice presentation). We also got an order of 3 cannolis (we were a party of 5 - one slice of cake wasn't going to make it around the table for a taste!). Also excellent.
The Service: Our waiter came to the table almost immediately. Since we were first timers, he gave us some of the history of the restaurant and some recommendations on the food. The waiter, busboy and food runner were all very attentive. The food came out well timed. 5 star service.
The Ambiance: We came in as a party of 5. They honored our reservation - a major plus in my book. As I said, the flavor of the restaurant is definitely ""Old Vegas"". The tables are very nicely spaced so you are not on top of the next table (there were some very long large tables in the main room that I assume were for large parties rather than strangers forced to dine together family style). Having a pianist playing background music was delightful.He was very good even without the vocalist).
I really enjoyed my dining experience at Bootlegger and will definitely return. I was torn between giving a 4 star and a 5 star review but rounded down because of the missing vocalist and because the lasagna just didn't make the 5 star mark.

Bootlegger is a pretty casual place. Nice atmosphere to it, though. Tables aren't too close, it's not too loud.

The wine list isn't the most extensive or diverse, but it makes due. You'd just love to see some more international flavor, though.

Also, the bread was okay. Not great bread - it's kind of in little squares. I prefer a big fresh loaf coming out of the oven personally.

For the positive - my entree was fabulous. I had the pappardelle with bolognese.  Sauce was spot on, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The portion was really good size, especially for the price, so we definitely left full.

We ordered creme brulee for dessert, though in fairness, I was so full from everything before, that I couldn't give it an accurate assessment. The texture was right, though haha.

To top it off, our waitress was fabulous. Great personality, great recommendations, not too pushy.

One advantage that Vegas definitely has over my years in California is the late-night tipsy food spots. No more begging cab drivers to take me through a jack in the box drive-thru.....well maybe once in awhile.

I got a pizza with a hard glob of what appeared to be microwaved cheese on top, and instead of sauce, I got awkward pockets of herbs under the oppressive glob that were awkwardly distributed, keeping me constantly on the edge of my seat: ""Will this bite be cardboard and cheese? Or will I get 20 flavors at once in one hidden clump?"" I went a couple days ago, and I still get a bit sick to my stomach when I think about it. 

The marinara they dropped off with the sad-looking bread pieces at the start of the meal was also completely watery. The ambiance was nice and the service was attentive, but I could never, ever return for that food. So disappointed.",pcv-MEpcI6t4_ytr49LFpw,3,0,1,tZPxKc5We3c7goXj65EQ3A

They feature live music from time to time, including jazz musicians from Cirque du Soleil shows that get together and have jam sessions.  

Their graveyard menu is very affordable, good portions, and conveniently located five minutes away from the madness of the strip casinos, right down the strip.

The first time I came to the Bootlegger's Bistro was for a work event.  I had a cocktail and with a few friends, ordered up a hot and cold antipasto.  While the cold was very decent, the hot antipasto was DELICIOUS.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and it had the proper amount of seasoning with very decent proportions.

The bar drinks are slow during normal business hours but during the late night hours service at the bar is great.  

Their garlic knots?  Delicious.  Could eat them all night.  And complimentary, to boot.

Their lasagna was excellent but moreover, their SAUCE is fantastic.  I'm very particular about marinara sauce, and theirs was very well done.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,3,1,4,YM1q3xU3Y50OGOCbk07aXA

There's a nice bar area and then a large restaurant area complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Just dark enough, those great curved booths, waiters wearing ties, lots of families and couples, etc.

The bread that each table automatically gets was delicious. Little square bites that were very buttery with some garlic. And served with a great red sauce for dipping (definitely not a marinara).

We opted for pasta dishes, of course. The basic spaghetti with meat sauce and the salmon on a bed of penne pomodoro. I was a bit confused when no sides were offered for the spaghetti (even though it says it comes with one at the top of the menu). And then with the salmon, I was asked if I wanted pasta or a potato. Well, since it is supposed to be a pasta dish, why would I get the pasta? But alas, I didn't question it and didn't say anything when the food arrived - I had no pasta on my plate, just a piece of salmon and a baked potato. Thankfully, the salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly. And while basic, the spaghetti with meat sauce had a good flavor. 

The waiter was very nice and checked on us several times. And despite it being packed, we never felt rushed.

We tried the calamari, fried meat ravioli, caesar salad, caprese salad, Chicken Saltimbocca, Veal Parm, cannoli and tiramisu. First of all, the wait staff is lovely and friendly. Glasses are filled promptly. The little garlic bread ""knots"" and marinara are to die for (and they'll bring more if you eat them all)! I've never really been that big a calamari fan. It's usually a little too greasy and rubbery. This was light, crispy and not rubbery at all. I could eat a plate of the fried meat ravioli. Salads were both fresh and delicious. Our entrees were amazing. The pasta on the side of each was obviously fresh made and cooked. Their sauces (especially marinara was about the best I've ever tasted). My husband loved his cannoli and I haven't eaten my tiramisu yet (too full, but I'm eating it tonight with leftover meal). The portion sizes are large. The atmosphere is great.

We were a party of three and ordered two of the chicken parmesan with their house made Bolognese and angelhair pasta.  I ordered the pappardelle with the rose sauce (bolognese with cream) which was insanely delicious and rich.  The portions were large and we all took left overs.  The scrumptious bread likely didn't help.  I also ordered a blood orange Cosmo which was tasty and strong.

We were anticipating some amazing old school Italian food, as we are big Anthony Bourdain fans and if Anthony Bourdain featured this restaurant on his show, we figured we were sure to have some sort of sublime tastebud experiences. 
When we walked in, the hostess gave us a chilly look and said, ""Do you have a reservation?"" in a snotty voice. To which we responded, ""No."" She acted annoyed, even though the place was about 1/2 full, if that. And come on, honey, it's a Monday night, and it's Nevada. Whatever.
The waiter was similarly standoffish, but warmer than the hostess. I ordered the primavera. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper, and it was still pretty bland. I figured since I ordered a vegetarian dish, maybe I'd ordered the wrong thing. But my other buddy had the meat lasagne, which, seriously, is a dish that's tasty at 80% of all Italian restaurants one would eat at. Not so much with his. He barely finished it, and he usually eats like a horse.
Food was not disgusting, just ok. Again, may I say bland? Unimpressive? Weak? I actually didn't see the episode where Anthony Bourdain ate here. I will lose the respect I have for him if he ate here and said, ""That's good.""

Thursday night, my family and I decided on Bootlegger for an early dinner before going to see ""O"" at Bellagio. I made a reservation for 5 p.m., but we rolled in about 4:15. We were seated in the main dining room and there was an older gentleman playing piano. In case you don't know, Bootlegger has live entertainment just about every night.  And I will tell you that based upon dining at Bootlegger for probably 17 years or more, you never know who is going to get up and sing, or play piano. Another thing that makes this place so unique is that the wait staff has been here FOREVER. I think since God was a boy in all honesty. Lol 

The menu is a book. There are specials for various times of day and there is something for everyone. My go too items are the Escargot. Bootlegger does a really good job with it. They are broiled in mushroom caps in an herb butter sauce. There is also the wedge salad which is one of the best anywhere. For my main entree, I had the Cabaribiti ala Carbanara. (Not sure on the spelling) It consisted of thick spaghetti like pasta in a cream sauce with peas and smoked bacon. It was sooo rich and and had a nice smiley flavor to it.

Bootlegger is still pretty much a locals place. I am thinking it might stay that way because it is so far down The Strip. Although, it is right next to the outlet mall, so ladies, you can leave your husbands or significant others at the bar and go shopping without them.

Our friend's Uncle introduced this place. We came here for late lunch/early dinner, so the place was a bit quiet but it was great to have the restaurant all to ourselves and a few others. There's a Harp player entertained us on the stage, nice! It's a dim light place with cozy atmosphere, surrounded with maroon color. We were seated at the booth, very comfy! We ordered a seafood platter to start: calamari, shrimp, ravioli all together on a big plate. We also had a caesar salad to share. It seems like everywhere we go these days we can't help but ordering a caesar salad to start. Something we love to try in many places. So, for those restaurants that are out of caesar salad, you're out of luck! Anyway, after all that, hubby had his eggplant parmesan and I had my favorite spaghetti with clam sauce and I asked them to make me a spicy one with red sauce. My God! They listened! And they listened well! On top of their listening skills, they also made me the best mouthwatering red sauce that is out of this world. You gotta try this one if you love spaghetti red sauce with clam taste. Usually I would order seafood with red sauce but this one had major clam taste. They chopped those clams and also gave me enough clams on the shells, so my spaghetti was swimming with clam red sauce, killing the swimming team of the Olympic! OK, just order that. I'm a red sauce drinker! I mean eater! So, when a restaurant makes me red sauce for my spaghetti, I'm a bit picky because I taste many different red sauces all my life. This one was really good. The seafood platter was just OK but my entree was terrific! Cecilia was our waitress for that afternoon. Service was ok, no problem. One thing  to keep in mind, Uncle Bert ordered chicken parmesan but when it came out it was a sandwich parmesan which he didn't enjoy as much. I think would be best to inform the guest if there's 2 types of chicken parmesans, so that he knew which one to order. After our meals, we hit a jackpot with the plate of 3 desserts due to Uncle Bert's birthday. Cecilia did it good, she made Uncle Bert's happy. I tried it but didn't think I could handle more than my entree. It was the best experience plus great Harp musician. Definitely would come back. Five stars for my entree. The rest was OK but not bad.

2217148,2016-07-25,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"I've had take-out from Bootlegger before, but I decided to finally try dining in.  We came by around 630p on a Sunday and were seated right away.  The atmosphere is old-school, with read semi-circle banquettes lining the wall.  There was a pianist playing (who was later joined by a singer - they were great).  There is a large center bar in the dining room, with video poker if you're so inclined.  As a note, there is poker but no smoking - a literal and figurative breath of fresh air!

Our beverage orders were taken quickly enough, and we had time to peruse the lengthy menu.  There are options for everyone, including healthy choices and gluten-free selections.  There's a prix fixe menu as well, just in case you brought your eating game.

Most of our drinks came, but not all.  Our server was standing at the table when the drinks were brought over and he sort of scolded the busser for not having the full order.  As if that wasn't awkward enough, he then proceeded to tell us that the busser has been working at Bootlegger for 20 years and is still only so-so at his job.  It was a very awkward interaction to say the least.  But enough about that and on to the food.

We ordered the escargot appetizer - snails in a garlic butter sauce, stuffed into a white mushroom cap.  The mushroom and the sauce were delicious.  The snail was slightly chewy.  Overall it was better than average.

I also ordered a caesar salad.  Not only was this not worth the $9 menu price, but it was definitely not good.  I believe it was made with a mix of iceberg and romaine, which is not only atypical, but also kind of crappy if the price is so high.  There was also something just off about the salad.  I wasn't able to put my finger on it (and neither was one of my dining companions who also had the salad).  It tasted like there was either oregano or dish soap in it.  Sadly, I'm not sure which.

Our entrees were next.  I ordered the pappardelle bolognese.  It's a heaping mound of pasta - easily enough for two if you've had an appetizer and a salad.  The taste was declicious with a very rich flavor.  The pasta was great too.  My dining companions also had great tasting meals (the chicken parm and the chicken insalada).  All told, our entrees were extremely large and filling, reasonably priced, and great tasting.

We rounded out the mean with a coffee and an espresso.  Our server brought the espresso out and the coffee was missing.  When the server came by with the check he asked ""did the busser not bring the coffee?""  I guess he had to round out the awkardness for the evening.

I would defintiely go to Bootlegger for take-out again.  The food is great.  The entrees are large enough that you can probably have half for dinner and the leftovers for lunch the next day.  The value is exceptional (we had cocktails, the appetizers, entrees for three, and two coffees for under $150).  The service when you are dining-in is a little strange - or perhaps that was just our experience.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,1,0,3,4G1-b45WhTYWoOw4k9W-4g

My husband and I ate there yesterday evening.  We were early, 5:30pm, and the place was not very full.  Our service was excellent!!  Our waiter could not have been better and the water glasses were kept full.  When I asked about a certain wine, the waiter said he didn't care for that one and offered me what he thought was a better wine.  It was a lovely wine indeed!

The calamari was lightly breaded and came our hot with marinara sauce that was tasty and hot.  It was a large appetizer for just two people.  the Caesar salad were crisp and flavorful.  My husband had chicken masala with fettuccini Alfredo.  VERY tender and wonderful.  I had the pork chop which was on the bone and a huge meal.  The scalloped potatoes were wonderful.

Just before 6:00 a pianist showed up and played some lovely music.  Everyone that came from then on out wanted to be close to the music.

2220173,2014-05-12,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Let's start with a little back ground information on myself and italian food. My Uncle's side of the family is full italian and can cook so I have had plenty of great authentic italian food over my lifetime. Bootleggers is the first italian restaurant, that I have been to, that produces great tasting, authentic, italian food. 

This place really portrays old Vegas well. You feel like you just stepped back in time to when Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin ruled the Strip. This place is one of the coolest spots in Vegas. They even have a nice piano player and lounge singer on most nights and they are open 24/7.

Now for the food. They start by giving you their garlic bread rolls...or thats what I call them. They are freshly baked garlic bread that is cut into squares before baking, so they resemble a roll. The rolls are served some classic marinara sauce that give them a great taste, but don't fill up on the rolls because the portion sizes here are pretty big. I ordered the spagettig and meatballs and my wife got the chicken Fettuccini alfredo. A true test to any italian restaurant is their meatballs. Every italian restaurant I have been to has meatballs that taste like dog food and yes this includes the regualrs like Olive Garden and Buca de Beppo. Bootlegger's meatballs are fantastic. They taste very similar to my family's recipe and therefore made me feel like I was at home. The spagetti was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of great tasting sauce. My wife's meal came out great too. 

The price of the meal was very resonable, with most entrees costing between 13-18 dollars. The service was average but acceptable. This place is a must visit not only for the food but for the great ambiance.",Ym6GF8TyJMPGV3X-0EhciA,4,0,5,juUksuSvVxxfbx_T2h0JyQ

2268483,2017-05-12,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"This review is about the multiple encounters I've had at this restaurant. 

Usually my boyfriend and I eat here late at night (I'm 21 he's 19), I would say we've been here about 3 times after 11 pm. And the food has always been solid. Nothing great but not totally disgusting. We go because it's one of the only spots open late that serves pasta. We also go for the late night specials, because regular priced items are way too much for the quality of food. This last time we were there a few weeks ago, they checked our IDs because supposedly you have to be over 21 to be there past 10? Wtf? So we left not understanding how we could've been there so many times but this one time they decided to check IDs. 

Today I went with my family (6 of us) and almost everything was wrong. First our waiter was yelling the whole time and constantly talking over us when we were trying to order. Got our orders wrong, probably because he wouldn't stop trying to correct us and make upcharges.  My mom got orange roughy and it tasted like it came from long John silvers. The pasta I got tastes better at Olive Garden. This place is also INSANELY overpriced for the quality of food. Maggianos is better, food and customer service, and a slightly less expensive. 

The food is mediocre at best. Pasta at mama depalmas is better and way better priced. The good parts about the meal was the bread, fresh and delicious. The mussels were amazing as well! The spicy tomato sauce they were in was great. Also, the magherita pizza was pretty good too, even though it has shredded cheese, which makes it just a plain cheese pizza. Nothing crazy special to come back for and certainly not for price.",JQxFyXB2rZK3HURlGF4oCw,0,0,2,EE6SEUtMluunreOpL4m4-g

The food is pretty good but it is on the more expensive side because you're paying for the experience versus than the actual food (which is why I'm giving them 2 stars vs. 1). However, my last trip to Bootleggers will be my last due to their terrible customer service.

A co-worker stopped by after work on a Friday for dinner and drinks. Everything took way longer than it should, but it was pretty busy and there was a performer on stage so we didn't mind too much. The problem came after we left when I checked my credit card statement and realized they charged both tickets to my card. No big deal, I figured I would just call and Bootleggers would fix the problem since it was their error; boy was I wrong. After getting the run around from the manager for three weeks, I finally got the name of someone in accounting who finally looked into my concerns. After she researched it, the manager finally called me back and told me that they would only take the extra charge off my credit card if my co-worker called Bootleggers and gave them her credit card information because we were still liable for the charge. Then they told me I had to be the one to tell my co-worker about the screw up. They wouldn't even take responsibilty and call her themselves to resolve the issue.

The food was mediocre at best.  I had their Marsala with chicken and it was lacking flavor.  I've had better Marsala from a cheap diner for less than half the cost.  I don't believe anyone at our table was impressed with their meal.  The bread they served when we sat down was the best thing I had all night.  Service was very good, though a bit slow at the beginning.  The worst part though was the live entertainment was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation at our table.  The group I was with are co-workers who see each other only a few times a year because we are based out of different areas, so meal time is supposed to be our social gathering to catch up or get to know new team members but that was nearly impossible except for the time the performer took a break between sets.

OH MYYYYYYYY!!! 
It's time to spend some quality time with my friend Kristin before her man takes her away from me to California! She suggested Bootlegger, said it's suppose to be really good! 
SOOO here we are. Kristin started off with some Calamari and the Wedge Salad... Also some garlic table bread with marinara sauce. I'm already slightly buzzed and I am ready to EAT!!! 
The bread and marinara was SO good.. I TOTALLY filled up on it... The Calamari was delish - Can't really go wrong with this dish! And the Wedge was totally good and I'm really NOT a fan of bleu cheese. At all! It was QUITE tastey though!! 
I am a GIANT seafood love and this dish immediately caught my eye on the menu: Seafood Diavolo ""House Specialty"" Clams, calamari, shrimp & mussels cioppino style over linguine in mild, medium or hot spicy tomato broth... OH. MY. GOD. SPICY HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH!!! It was NIIIIIIIIIIIICE and spicy and had SO much seafood and FABULOUS flavor!! I ate about half of it since I filled up on the bread before it actually arrived... I had the rest boxed up though and BC thoroughly enjoyed it himself - we cannot wait to go back and get our grub on with this dish again!! NOM NOM NOM!!!!!!

A few housekeeping things about this place ... it's south of the strip, it's pretty much a locals place, it gets crowded (make a reservation) and it's not cheap.  You're going to spend a $15 - $30 per person (with drinks).  You'll get large portions and good quality Italian food.  If that doesn't scare you away keep reading.

I've been here about a dozen time and have always had great service.  I've had great experiences in large and small groups, they do a great job in the service area.

It's hard to recommend a single dish here because they have all been so good.  I'm going off the beaten path here a bit and say you have to try the garlic knots.  Think bread sticks but 100 times better.  I'd go back for the knots alone.

For entree's we all ordered either the pappardelle bolognese or the meat lasagna. The noodles are very good and the dish comes with plenty of sauce. I tried the meat lasagna my wife had and it's basically deconstructed, instead of a tall classic lasagna, it's laid flat and very meaty / saucy. After eating the noodles and lasagna we asked for more bread to soak up the delicious sauce.

I had some wonderful company, and that's probably the saving grace of this meal.

We started with house Chianti, which was pretty good.  We were brought these fried balls of dough that were accompanied by a marinara sauce of some sort.  They were pretty oily, but because I was hungry, I grabbed the smallest one on the plate.

I chose the linguine with white clam sauce.  When it arrived, it looked like linguine with canned clams poured on top.  There were 4 fingernail sized clams in their shells, but that was it.  The rest of it looked like canned clams.  A big difference from the same dish I recently ordered in Seattle, where there were a ton 'o clams, all in their shell.

It was hot but not enough to burn you and the amount of clams they placed on my plate was plenty! They also start you off with garlic squares and a marinara dip as well. I didn't care too much for the dip because I couldn't get the tomatoes on there, it was more like you had to scoop out the pieces on your garlic square.

The reason why I'm giving this place a 5 star is because of the service. The waiter was great but I have to commend the runner that tended to our table.

What I learned from the Italiano/a  that I know, is  a good Italian restaurant have to have good spaghetti & meatballs, if they cant get that right, it's not authentic. 
So we order the calamari for appetizer, great marinara sauce.
Spaghetti and meatballs, and spaghetti and sausages. ( Both amazingly great, you can taste the fresh ingredients)

Food is above average. It's delicious and the service is always on point. But the real reason why I'm giving them a 5 star rating is because of the ambiance. Once you enter this establishment, it feels/looks like you stepped back into time of the Mafia days.

Been here twice. Both times, I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. Entree is big enough for two days worth of food. I always have leftovers and it tastes just as great the next day.
My date ordered the Papperdelle Bolognese and Baked Penne the second time around. But wow...the Papperdelle Bolognese was out of this world!!!!!! The taste and flavoring of the sauce was like an orgasm in my mouth! O_O Definitely one of the best pastas I've tasted in a long time.

We also got an order of Bruschetta as an appetizer. Great starter item. You can choose between tomato basil or eggplant. We got both but in the end, we preferred the tomato basil.

We made our reservation at 6pm, our party of 10 came together, 15 mins late, right after we got sitted Steve stormed up to the table and said because we are late we have to be done and leave the place at 8pm sharp(on christmas day). His attitude was unacceptable. So we cannot sit and enjoy your holiday dinner? We went to talk to him upfront about this and he cursed at us, while we were walking back to the table. We had to leave Bootlegger, it was not the holiday spirit and cheerfull environment we wanted to celebrate our family  holiday. And it was our 5th time in Bootlegger, we celebrated our special moments here often before, always loved the food,  atmosphere, service and live music. But this host Steve ruined it for us.

I really dig the ambiance it's like an old school family establishment but really big. I'd recommend making reservations as we didn't and had to wait a lil while. It was definitely worth it though. I got the mozzarella caprese salad. The calamari was super good. I got the pancetta carbonara with peas! So fresh and really delicious. My friend got The piccata and she loved it. And  my other friend got the veal. Veal was tender the side spaghetti was lackluster and the sauce was a little to sweet. Overall a fantastic meal.,CaNXmq_0m5oVamImJXn85w,1,1,4,vLi5YC1JtUqvbIl4G8zwNQ

The server was amazing, and very knowledgeable about the menu. We wanted a salad, with our food, but he said the portions were huge, and asked if we wanted to share one. Not only did he make that perfect suggestion, but he split the wedge for us. Between the perfect buttery bread bites and the wedge, all four of us were in carb heaven. 
I ordered Chicken Focaccia, and it was perfect! The fettuccini that came with it, was light if you can believe that Alfredo sauce can be light. Omg! So good! My husband ordered the shrimp linguini, I think. It looked so picture perfect, but I didn't taste it because I had so much of my own.

2746756,2015-11-05,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Erm, I wanted to love this place, but to say I did would be a lie. 

It's open 24/7, so maybe it's crazy to expect fresh fresh food.  However, the prices on the menu fooled me into thinking I would be getting something amazing. I ordered the spinach alfredo primavera and my husband ordered the lasagna. Because of allergies, I asked the waiter to exclude pine nuts from my pasta, but this request was not granted. 

It only took about 5 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. Although this is usually it good thing, it was evident that it was already made and just put on a plate. This is exactly how it tasted. We truly expected to wait a bit and enjoy the music from the harpist, but we had no wait.  When the food is delivered, I instantly noticed the pine nuts and didn't bother complaining. I took a bite without devouring a pine nut and I was interested in correcting my order because it tasted bland and old. I feel like that plate is a joke, just offered in case a vegetarian shows up. It came with vegetables that were soggy and candied red peppers. These candied peppers actually made me chuckle because I never expected to see them in the pasta. 

Alright, alright, I will calm down. Now onto the lasagna. There was nothing really terrible about the lasagna. It was pre-prepared and tasted like ""mom's"" left overs. They cut a really thin slice and laid it on it's side, similar to how a cake wedge on it's side would be. Each bit contained a different bite of the lasagna, either all ricotta or beef. I don't agree with the presentation of the dish, but it was definitely the delicious. 

My husband and I ended up sharing the lasagna and did not touch the spinach alfredo anymore. We were still hungry and finally got to my favorite portion of the meal. Tiramisu!!! This was delicious, moist, and just the perfect amount of coffee flavor. The display was beautiful and I am craving it now as we speak. We ate dessert and listened to the most amazing harpist I have ever heard, Mariano! 

I will be back, but I will come for desserts and awesome music. I'll be skipping the overprice pre-prepared main course.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,2,1,3,ixiv1nWySK1whuJkQCDYfg

Between inhaling mass quantities of complimentary garlic bread (if only to sop up every delicious bit of marinara) & polishing off an appetizer of beef/pork raviolis (with yet more marinara), it was difficult to take more than a few bites of my entree: eggplant parmesan. 

Positive comments all around for his shrimp cocktail & flavorful ribeye, its sauce & accompanying mashed potatoes, in particular, garnering praise.

I'm so upset because we haven't been here in years and my mom was looking forward to celebrating her birthday. It was my mother, her bf, my brother and I. They had ordered chicken dishes and my brother and I ordered a pizza to share. (They have amazing pizza) The entrees came out, 20 minutes later (after we are starving) our pizza comes out. I ordered the pizza that had pepperoni, cheese, and mushrooms because we are simple. It came out with all kinds of stuff on it. Peppers, onions, olives. I immediately told the server that we didn't order that, he looked absolutely offended and said yes you did. I said no we did not. He asked if we wanted that and I said no. He left. 10 min later he comes back with the pizza menu and begins to argue with me telling me I ordered the pizza Classico or something and I kept telling him I did not order that. I ordered the pizza with pepperoni and cheese. He continued to argue 5x with me back and forth in front of other guests that I'm wrong and he wrote down pizza Classico. He told me ""you may have thought you ordered that one but I wrote this one down"" I was absolutely shocked when he spoke to me that way. I'm completely offended at this point. I told him to go get a manager after 5 minutes of arguing basically screaming at me. The manager then came and comped our meal. Well my mothers meal because I didn't get to order the pizza. I am extremely upset because the food here is amazing and I waited 45 min for a pizza and did not even get it and had to leave. I'm appalled at the behavior this server had. I'm a server myself and the guests are always right. I have been in positions where the right dish did not come out and I simply apologize and get whatever they want because regardless if I am right they are enjoying dinner with me and I am not going to argue with a customer. Aside from this at the beginning I ordered a Mountain Dew. He said they don't carry that. I then looked in the menu where it specifically said under beverages Mountain Dew. I pointed he told me ""oh that's wrong, a lot of things are not right on the menu""... what the hell am I suppose to think? 5 min later he brings me a Mountain Dew and apologizes and said ""I don't study the menu""

I have no words for the disrespect I received this evening. I don't recall his name and I wish I had gotten it. I did speak to the manager who apologized but regardless there is no reason someone should speak to a person that way let alone a guest.

Sorry...I was reminiscing on Vegas trip in June 2010 my hubby and I took. Let just say I am a true Vegas fan. 

Back to the topic at hand: Bootleggers. 

I am a fan of as well and would visit this restaurant again. This was one of the restaurants we found that was open late hours and when you are in Vegas, partaking in Vegas activities, late dining will occur. 

When we drove into the parking lot, the restaurant had curb appeal and we were happy we found a descent place. Once you go in, the inside decor and ambiance was very different from what the outside appearance will have you believe. First, not sure if it was because it was  late, but when we enter the bar area, it was dark. It was really dark. Reminded me of some secret hiding place one will arrange to meet up. Like an old mafia style movie. 

Our waiter was the bartender so service was a little bit slow. But his personality and attentiveness made up for his slowness. 

The menu has typical Italian meals and is decently priced. The food was good. I ordered the lasagna and although I have tasted some delicious lasagna, I can say it was decent, filled with seasoned meat and flavorful red sauce. Mama would be proud!

Pros
1) the history of the place makes it interesting and unique. 
2) nice big bar area

4) open 24 hours 

Cons
1) dirty martinis very inconsistent
2) value - 3 small shrimp scampi app not prawns for $15. $5 for each shrimp. 
3) mushroom app the sizes of the mushrooms inconsistent 
4) location for us 

In the middle 
1) baked penne good but missing something maybe more seasoning or ricotta cheese
2) lasagna good not the best but not the worst again missing something

I mistakenly asked my waitress how it compares to my favorite Philly in Las Vegas before I ordered it. She said, ""[other restaurant] is shit, this is way better."" Customer service tip - when someone mentions their favorite place, and you tell them it's shit, you A) had better be prepared to back that up with a quality sandwich, and B) know them pretty well, since a lot of people are unaccustomed to that type of treatment in restaurants. 

I had the Philly cheesesteak equivalent of the McRib, my co-worker had the most uninspiring spaghetti and some sort of sausage (but made fresh, onsite, daily!) that made him wonder if he had actually eaten anything. The waitress came back to ask how much better it was than my favorite restaurant. I told her it wasn't. I didn't mention the whole McRib part of it, just that it wasn't better than [redacted]. She said, ""Well, when you're used to eating shit, I guess you get to like shit.""

Ambience--for me, was a little dark but other than that, I have no complaints. Although I was not a fan of the decor too much, I truly only care about whether or not the food tastes good. My advice here is, don't be put off by the ""lone"" location of this place or the dark interior.

Service--was good. Our server was polite, prompt, and had a great memory. He took our orders without a notepad and remembered what each person ordered by memory--a skill you don't see anymore with servers. As the daughter of parents that have worked a lifetime in the food service industry, this is an old skill that I admire and appreciated.

Food--delicious. They do give you free bread as a starter and this restaurant does something unique I haven't seen yet--they give you the bread in ""bite size"" pieces and a side of their marinara sauce to dip it in. The sauce is good--tomato-y and garlic-y, just the way I like it. If you don't like marinara, you probably won't like this sauce. The bread is decently good. I got the Pappardelle (imported egg pasta with their bolognese meat sauce) and it was delicious. A little salty for me, but nothing that off put me from the dish overall.

2923156,2013-07-02,2,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,When I moved to Vegas a year ago a buddy raved about this place. I finally went tonight 6/26/13. I just moved in the neighborhood and I am walking distance. Decided to sit at the bar and met the awesome bartender Fred. He is full of awesomeness and can make someone feel at home. Split the dinner lasagna and I gotta tell you its the beat I have ever had. Soft. Moist. Cheesy and the best part... It is not heavy. As light as a lasagna can be. We also tried the mozarella sticks. Let me tell you. Not that frozen crap. I took a bite and it was heaven. For desert I got the canoli. With a hint or orange and not too sweet chocolate it was awesome! All in all I will be back at least 2 times a month. Oh don't forget to try their bread. It's a party in every bite. Just remember to add 5-15 minutes of cardio to your workouts after. This not for calorie watchers. Go see Fred and have him guide you through Italy in LV!,CHRClRVBSeVrGtn6pAEbAQ,1,1,5,lpoDIAM9yAp6xINnwgfjNw

I wasn't planning on having desert but when the waiter said they had Cannoli's with a hint of Grand Marnier in them I could not resist...those were incredible, I loved the slight orange flavor.

Prices are fairly reasonable.  My meal, which included the baked penne, a glass of chianti and the cannoli cost about 30 bucks.

Our server was very prompt and brought us complimentary garlic bread balls with marinara sauce. The menu is a little pricey but if seated in the restaurant area with music (on select days), it would probably make up for the steep pricing.

I'm vegan so I asked our server what he would recommend. One of his suggestions was the ""capellini al pomodoro rustica"" and stated it's usually made with chicken stock but he would request it made without. Perfect! The meal was delicious and I was pleased with a yummy variety of veggies cooked very nicely with sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil with some noodles (linguine, I believe). 

My date ordered chicken parmesan which came with angel hair pasta and most everything was covered with cheese. Perfect for him! He enjoyed his meal as well. Service was very good and our server was personable. I really appreciated the attention and ease toward my dietary request!

I chose The Bootlegger for my wedding reception because of its proximity to the ceremony and I am very happy with my choice. From start to finish communication with Suzy the events coordinator was very smooth and professional. I met with her a few days before the wedding to discuss all the last minute details. She actually worked the night of the  reception which added an extra touch of ease to the evening. The room was set up exactly as I had requested and was a comfortable fit for a little under 30 guests.  I was able to come in a few hours beforehand and add my extra touches. The food was delicious from the bread, to the salad, to the entrees-- which were HUGE, to the very cute cannolis for dessert. My guests were so full that they asked for to go boxes which I thought was great! 
Not having to worry about set up or take down was a very big stress off my back.

I was very disappointed after reading several reviews on how amazing the food is and how great the service is.  I stopped in for lunch on Sunday and was greeted by this mannequin that holds a sign.  It said to seat myself. 

I sat myself.

After a few minutes someone came with menus.  The menu is 8 pages long and has the old school feel to it.  I just watched Bourdain scour the Italian countryside eating pasta, so I ordered a vegetable plate and some fettuccine Alfredo.  I was really excited.  I was.

The appetizer arrived after about 12 minutes with fried ravioli and some grilled veggies.  They were soggy and the mushroom cap was leaving that grey water on the plate.  Not bad, but not good either.  The ravioli was okay, but not to die for.  We waited another 10 minutes for our pasta - vegetable lasagna with alfredo sauce and my fettuccine.  

Vegetable lasagna, dear readers, isn't just broccoli sandwiched between layers of pasta and swimming in sauce.  There are other vegetables out there, like eggplant, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions...I could go on and on.  The lasagna was sad.  I mean it literally looked like it was crying on the plate.  My alfredo was sandy, and when I say that I mean the sauce had grit in it that grinded like sand between my teeth.  I stopped halfway through in fear of digesting alien fragments.  

We did not get the bread that was supposed to come with our meal, either.

I paid over $50 for lunch to eat crap.  I was very disappointed, felt like I was raped of my money, and honestly did not have the best time in the restroom that evening.  Needless to say I will never EVER returrn here again.  God willing.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,7,3,1,0doGjAeQM0Xoz9W0kdaDEg

When we walked in, I thought I would be too underdressed, but the environment has a casual feel to it.  It's almost like one of those really nice restaurants with the really good food that you want to go to, but you really don't want to get dressed to the nines beforehand.  Well, then you have found your new Mecca.

The seated us and the nicest waiter that I have encountered in Las Vegas took our drink orders and brought us a plate of bread bites with a bowl of homemade marinara sauce to dip.  Oh my gosh...the marinara sauce is the best I have ever tasted.  The person I was with is more of an Alfredo sauce fan, but she loved it also.

We placed our orders and they brought out my Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken was lightly breaded enough so that it added to the flavor very well, but didn't detract from the fact that it was a moist piece of chicken.  They included a side of angel hair pasta with marinara that was delicious and the entree was so big that I had enough for the next day.  We also ordered tiramisu to go and it was the best I have ever eaten.

It's a huge space which allows you to choose which kind of vibe you're looking for. If you want an intimate experience with live piano, sit in the dining room. If you'd prefer to keep it casual, sit in the booths at the bar. This is just a cool place to be. Probably even cooler the later in the night you stop by. 

We started off with some drinks and an order of the braised pork neck bones. This was delicious but took us by surprise. The pork was super tender and the broth seemed vinegar based, reminding me of sauerkraut. It's such an unusual taste but you get kind of addicted to it. It should be noted that panetti breads (sort of like garlic knots) are provided with the meal so you could get away with not having an appetizer. For dinner I ordered the papperdelle bolognese, my boyfriend had the baked penne, and.. I can't even remember what my parents ordered. Probably because the star of the show was definitely the papperdelle bolognese. I mean how perfect of a noodle is papperdelle? To me, the thicker the noodle the better. Perfect for soaking up the meaty, slightly greasy bolognese sauce. I don't do Italian food all that often but this is probably the only dish in Vegas that I dream of having again. 
The portions are pretty big, especially after eating the panetti breads and any other drinks or appetizers that come beforehand. 

The Bootlegger is somewhere probably everyone has seen driving down Las Vegas Blvd near the Outlet mall. It looks so large ominous that you would never think it would be as intimate as it is inside. It's the kind of place you want to keep to yourself or sneak into after a long night at work. It's certainly a lot more welcoming and cozy than any stuffy Italian restaurant on the Strip.

We walked in and were seated in the dining area by the bar, which is just fine, but he took a good 4-5 minutes before stopping by with waters and to take our drink/appetizer orders. He was very apologetic which is nice, but the place wasn't horribly busy and I needed me some aqua. The food runner brought us the amazing garlic knots and yummy marinara dipping sauce, and our server took our order and we enjoyed some nice conversation. It was a great ending to a good weekend. 

Our food arrived and I was salivating by this time, even after we destroyed two plates of the garlic knots. I ordered Chicken Piccata, which was pretty solid, but not the best I've had. My lady had the baked penne and she said it was very delicious as always, and her dad had the chicken Marsala. He's an excellent chef/caterer having owned AND cooked in at least 3 different restaurants in his day and he could not stop talking about how impressed he was with the ""high quality Marsala wine"" they used in the preparation of his meal. He said it's one of the best he's ever had, and that's saying something. Something that was a little annoying, is the water glasses are very small, and I drink lots of water with my meals. It ran empty for at least a couple minutes 3 times during the meal. It would be nice to get some bigger glasses, or maybe he could keep just a little better eye on his tables. Not a huge deal, but when you're eating steaming hot Italian food, sometimes you just need some damn water a little quicker.

The reason my review isn't 5 stars is the slight lack of service, and my piccata just being pretty good and not ""as good as it gets"" like 5 stars says. I'm a big fan, and will definitely come back as it's always a solid place for some great Italian food, and I love the atmosphere, and it's close to home.

Four of us, waiter was Roger - been there 10 years and he was very good.  Osso Buco and saltimbucco....calamari and the veal marsala...all very good.  My wife thought the accompanying alfredo was the best she'd ever had.  
Second night, water was Vito, also excellent.  And again, all four meals were excellent.  I asked for pomodoro instead of the alfredo side and that was disappointing - tomatos were canned and I could't taste or see the garlic.  But as a side dish, that sure did not ruin the evening at all.
We didn't get to try a dessert - too full both nights.  And the Thursday visit included a piano plyer with ""lounge"" type music.  Far from the best - real far.
So we've got a new go-to in Vegas.  And it was extra nice to get off the strip (about 3 miles south of Mandalay Bay).

The lunch  menu is outstanding!!  The garlic bread they bring out is good.  Our server brought out 3 ramekin's of marinara sauce, once for each of us.  That was super thoughtful, because double dipping is necessary!!  We ordered a chicken parm sandwhich, spaghetti and meatball, and lasagna.

My buddy said the chicken parm is his second favorite in town.  That says a lot since he ALWAYS orders a chicken parm sandwhich at every sandwich shop we go to!!  My other buddy got the lunch spaghetti and meatball.  It came with a house salad that was pretty substantial in its own right.  He said he was kind of full from just the salad and bread, but he toughed it out and ate his spaghetti.  He said it was really good, and overall a great value.  I had the lasagna and it was really good.  I would say it is one of the better lasagna's I've eaten.

3388179,2012-10-07,3,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"This was not my goal. I had heard good reviews over the years of the Bootlegger Bistro but our visit on a Wednesday evening at 10:00 pm was not good for several reasons. 

1. First, the (very) good part. The history of the Bootlegger is alive and well on the walls and the decor. We sat in the old booths where apparently many of the early Las Vegas icons may have sat - fun to chat about. But better yet, one (or more) of the video monitors plays continuous clips of Las Vegas in the 60s and 70s - again, fun and entertaining.

2. Now, unfortunately, the food was simply bland. No Italian bistro should have bland food at any point, it's a fundamental flaw or here, 'the kiss of death.' When an Italian place serves a generic tasting sauce, it's time for one of those TV shows to enter the picture and accomplish some major changes.

3. We ordered Eggplant Parmigiana and a chicken dish, Pollo All Angelo. Each of ours dishes had no taste to it other than a series of generic ingredients, of the canned type, placed together and heated. The pasta was a bit undercooked but okay.

4. At one point the two servers both disappeared for about 5 minutes after another group came in. The bartender was 'quietly' yelling, i.e. arms up in frustration, looking all about, making the gestures along with some additional bar guests seated nearby.

5. Unexplainable part. I had ordered a Coke, it was normal. Then middle of the dinner, I ordered another one, refill, it was strangely different, much more syrup-like.

6. In sum, the food was ~ I sincerely dislike saying this ~ bland at every point, the service was fast-food like, meaning adequate but intermittent definitely, but the atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately, that is not nearly enough to return. I would rather eat great food at a dive or 'hole in the wall.'

7. As for some of the other reviews I see here - I highly suspect one or two as possibly being 'affiliated' with the place. The words just seem too simplistic in one case, too broad in another. Now, if I hear there was new management and an improved menu at some point, we may re-visit, but no time soon. 

Strange thought here - knowing that so many famous people had eaten at the Bootlegger in the prior locale, and hearing about this place for, well, decades, I was looking forward to a good dinner with my wife. It simply failed. The irony is that I had just shared with my wife that Olive Garden doesn't essentially cook anything, no grills, but uses microwaves to re-heat all the pre-packaged items sent to each store.",k_eKYlkhI11VGzb5RxHmOA,3,0,2,PSKLdo7-bCPVgjBK-vyyUQ

This is a great place to meet for a drink and catch up with friends. It's not too loud or crazy. Usually nice and relaxing and there's usually pretty good people watching action.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,7,6,4,Of_rf8W6rUQX_bH81t0yWg

The food was the saving grace. My Seafood Diavolo was so divine. Packed with seafood and it came extra spicy- like I asked. My main gripe with Italian restaurants is that the rarely do spicy. Also the shrimp were huge and really tasty. Cooked perfectly.

3400222,2014-04-25,4,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"This is one of Rosebud's favorites, so we've been here many times. At first it was because a friend informed us that Ruth Brown performed there Thursday nights and we had to go before she died. So we did, and it was great, and then she died as predicted. (I assume they have other fine entertainment but I will let them live in peace. RIP, Ruth). 

 Anyway, we went once when I was not in the mood for Italian, so I ordered the rib eye special and it was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. I also agreed to go on one of the rare occasions when Babygirl and I were on a diet, so we ordered the light entrees: her fish, me chicken. They were both well cooked, moist and delicious, and served with on beds of spinach with sides of steamed broccoli and whole wheat pasta with marinara. We hardly missed the cheesy stuff.

But, mostly we keep coming back because they serve hands down my absolute favorite lasagna in town. (At least since the old Venetian on West Sahara closed down. Sob.)  Rather than a square like is usually served, their version is more like a slice of a tall layer cake, with one of the layers being a big, rich section of ricotta filling. YUM! It's served lying on its side with sauce and melted mozzarella bubbling on top.

 Unless, of course, you're my sister. In that case, everyone else's lasagna was as described. She inexplicably got a cold one. So, she sent it back and the waiter brought it out heated, but it had suffered from its sojourn in the microwave and was now ""too soggy"". So, she flagged the waiter down yet again and sent it on another trip to the kitchen. This time, the brought her out a new one, which was hot and fresh, but by then she had consumed enough of someone else's chicken that she was no longer hungry. It looked like a prime target for scavengers or tasty leftovers, but there was no competition for it. Guess we all put in enough time in the restaurant business to figure no way was that coming out on the third run unscathed.

Anyway, it wasn't the lasagna incident that cost the fifth star (Bad experiences follow my sister around like a black cloud. I promise you it was her and not them).

No, the lower rating is due to my pet peeve: Lasanga is priced reasonably enough at 17 or 18 dollars, but it does not include a salad. Or even bread. You have to buy an order of garlic knots. Nothing I hate more. Jeez. Raise the price a couple of bucks and throw me some damned lettuce. We'll all be happy.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,6,3,4,pKkHKKlDL0dbz2fn2R6vsw

So as we started to put tables together several of the employees said we were not allowed to do that. So when I checked with the host that suggested it, and the manager, they defended their statement that taking 2 tables fit a party of 3 was not what they meant. Did they really think that 3 guest would sit at 2 separate tables? Really ridiculous, and piss poor attitude on top of it. 

Being a legacy restaurants comes with a responsibility. Be helpful, be respectful and be kind. But more importantly being grateful for business.

3482831,2017-03-06,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"THE BEST ITALIAN IN LAS VEGAS!!!

Living in Vegas for the past 17 years of my life and having the opportunity to sample some of the finest Italian Food Las Vegas has to offer, I can definitively say that Bootlegger is number 1!

I've been to this place more times than I can count, and it never ceases to amaze me after each and every visit! I prefer to sit in the lounge area near the bar, as it's more quiet than the main dining area, especially when the restaurant has live performers livening up the atmosphere with music. 

My favorite appetizer is the calamari, and entree has to be the linguini and clams! The calamari is cooked to perfection on every visit, and the portion size for the linguini and clams is unreal. I personally prefer the broth, but the other sauces are delicious as well! The pasta is usually good to serve two people, but I can eat an entire bowl by myself because it's THAT GOOD! If you're not into linguini and clams, I can honestly say I've never gone wrong with anything else on Bootlegger's menu, so take your pick!

If you managed to save room for dessert, the Tiramisu is where it's at! Probably the best Tiramisu in Vegas at the time of writing this review, but that's been at the top for years now. 

Overall, Bootlegger is fantastic! It's a perfect place to visit for any occasion! I would recommend avoiding Bootlegger on Friday and Saturday night for dinner, as it can get quite crowded. Go during the week at around 4:30PM and you'll practically have the place to yourself. You might have to wait a little before the food comes to your table, but that's because Bootlegger makes everything from scratch! 

Once you go Bootlegger, you'll be spoiled for life!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,1,5,D1hZC8-TDLljc40aou3GQQ

While we were sitting there I overheard the couple behind me send back an appetizer of calimari (unsure of the reason so I dont want to speculate) but also the steak was not cooked properly.  My brother had come in the previous night to try out the food and complained about the chicken being super dry.  I think the cook/cooks may have had an off day because the restaurant was packed when we left at 6 to go to our reception.  That many people filling the tables so it can't be all that bad.   The reception food was pretty good as I wasn't really expecting much after the complaints.  The steak however had good flavor but I had to chew and chew and chew..  WOW.. it was defintely fighting back.  The lasagna came in what I can only call a cheese form.  Small squares that held together tightly.  At first I was telling my family that this is kinda weird and spongy but after eating it I realized wow.. this is genius.. Everything in the lasagna stays together as you eat it so you aren't losing anything.   I guess I could compare it to Italian dim sum although it wasn't a dumpling .

House salads..mediocre..a small amt of iceberg lettuce, a few garbanzos, 3 grape tomatoes and mostly oil dressing...not worth the money.
Entrees:
Chicken marsala they call it scallopini w fettuccine alfredo. Both items were overloaded w black pepper...when the waiter inquired how our food was we told him and said we'd push through it, but honestly it ruined both dishes..not only were we choking on pepper but it ruined the taste. To make matters worse he returned after speaking w the chef and said there was only pepper on the fettucini.  Absolutely not true.
The fettucini alfredo was ore like under cooked pasta w/ a white pepper sauce...if there was cheese involved it was nonexistant.
Chicken parmesan was meh..she'd had better.  Marinara sauce was just ok.
Shrimp scampi w pasta our guest said was fabulous and this is the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars.
Also started w coutesy hard bread knots?  and marinara that was good but none of it was hot so we all passed on eating much of it.

Overall, the meal was mediocre at best and absolutely not worth the 22-26 ala carte pricing. 

Also the environment was not relaxing or conducive to visiting since they expanded. ..the room is noisy, overhead loud music, a harpist on mic, bar noise, swinging kitchen doors.  Also tge dining area opens to tge bar...cigarette smoke was coming from someplace...either tge bar or tge kitchen...as nonsmokers it was offensive to us.

Called ahead on a Sat night at 5:40pm to check the wait for 4 + baby.  Was told no wait and arrived within 10 minutes.  Was offered the ""lovely"" table right next to the kitchen...  Totally unsuitable for 3 adults and an active 4 year old, so asked for a different table.  Was told by the blonde hostess (who was the one who answered the phone when I called) that all the other empty tables were reserved for reservations, and we needed to wait 30 mins for a different table.  I guess when I called ""no wait"" was only for that 1 table and she failed to mention it...  Seriously?  She and the bearded host offered no alternatives and wanted to do nothing for us, and they seemed indifferent to losing our business when we walked out.  I guess they are doing so well that they can turn money away.  Lucky them.

They were so rude, I wanted to give them zero stars, but, alas, you can't do that on Yelp.

3653297,2015-06-02,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Wifeypie and I walked in this past Monday, we arrived about midnight.

I would have liked to have given the place a 3-4 star review. The service was not great but I did not expect much at the late hour, so I could get past that. The food was actually pretty darn good!

Why then the 1 star review you ask? We were seated in the bar area as they had closed the dining room, and as soon as our food arrived, one of the employees sat at the bar, not 10 feet from us, and lit up a cig (this employee appeared to be management, the way he was dressed). Next thing ya know, two other employees did the same, so we were sitting there engulfed with smoke while trying to enjoy our dinners. I asked our waitperson if it was legal and I was met with ""ummmmm, it's just what they do when it's after hours."" Keep in mind this establishment is open 24/7, when is after hours? I did not want to make a stink (all pun intended) and asked to be moved, and we were seated outside. By the way, this is not a bar that you would consider you could smoke at in Vegas, this really is a part of the restaurant.

IMHO this was just lame. We were not the only people dining there, and there was no consideration for the patrons. These employees (two waitpersons and the gentleman that appeared to be management) never asked the diners if it would bother them, they just sat down and had at it.

When we walked in there was some great music and again the food was very good, however I do not think I would return. Whoever owns this place, if you read this, you should wrangle in your help!

Just my humble mindya,

My boyfriend and I turned it into a spur-of-the-moment date night, which are my favorite kind of date nights. At first glance, I was nervous that we were a bit underdressed in just t-shirts and jeans... (Y'know how some famous Italian joints can be)... The building had a string-lit courtyard and I could hear a live band covering ol' Blue Eyes from the parking lot, but to my surprise, this place is the classiest casual spot I've ever been to. I mean, it seemed to be the neighborhood's after-work spot, which makes me like it even more. Nobody cares which fork you use first!

The menu was incredible! Pricy, but there's so much to choose from. The boy and I decided to go out on a limb and try something new as an appetizer: Braised Pork Neck Bones. Tbh, it kinda weirded me out at first but the pork was so delicious and fell right off the bone, all while soaking in a flavorful broth that begs to be sopped up by toasted garlic bread. We also ordered classic bolognese and manicotti as our entrees, which were so yummy and came with the biggest portions - Perfect to take home and nuke for lunch the next day.

All in all, I'm a fan of the Bootlegger. Decent prices for delicious food. I'll be back!",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,2,1,4,ETSSyHAcU24ep79u1IPNIQ

I worked in an Italian restaurant for 14 years of my life and I have PTSD (Pasta Trauma Stress Disorder) and seriously just can't even with Italian restaurants even three years after leaving the food service industry. 

I loved this place, inside I felt like a NY mobster.  Round high back booths to plot your hits and tables with actual tablecloths to strong arm your lackeys.  Classy. Dim red lighting.  

Bread nuggets on point with marinara.  Way better than breadsticks! Oh that fettuccine Alfredo...as my friend promised pretty spectacular. 

Dessert.  Normally I can pick one.  Usually one stands out.  But this place had three. I had one there and one to go. I had the creme brûlée. Fuggedabowdit. It's not worth the calories...I mean I ate it because I paid for it, but it was not that great. Lemon drop cheesecake was to go...and oh yeah that's where it's at!

The bartenders both looked like deer in headlights the entire time we were there. There were no more than two to three other guests at the bar also. We couldn't get the bar caddy's to properly fit at the bar when our food arrived... the bartenders answer was to try and stick some napkins under it. Almost impossible to get their attention anytime we needed something! We ended up moving our entire lunch ourselves to a high top table so we could eat more comfortably. We were never asked how anything was or if we needed anything else. When we asked for the check all of our drinks were on the tab even though my boyfriend played while we were at the bar. When we asked the bartender, he said he  thought he saw my boyfriend put 40$ in and not the 100$ that he really put in, I guess he begrudgingly took one drink off our bill. Apparently that was the only thing this bartender had noticed our entire visit. 
We are both locals , born and raised. We have good memories from the original Bootlegger on Maryland Pkwy. 
This was such a disappointment!!! 
The food was just ok. Not great , and over priced. 22$ for pasta on the lunch menu! If I'm going to spend 60$ on lunch , there are a ton of other great restaurants I'd rather go to

One thing to note is that this place gets very busy on any given day so it's important to get reservations ahead of time (unless you're going at odd hours of the night). 

For starters, they brought amazing garlic bread bites to the table with a side of marinara sauce. Needless to say, our waiter had to bring us another batch since we finished our bread so quickly. For the main dish, I ordered chicken marsala which was very flavorful with the sauce and mushrooms. It also came with a side of creamy alfredo pasta. The portions are rather large so I shared with one of my friends. 

Also, I ordered a crème brûlée for dessert, which definitely was the icing on the cake. It had a crispy, sugary outside, with a creamy, rich inside. Words cannot explain how much I loved this dessert.

My co-worker introduced me to this place back in 2007 when we were both working in Las Vegas for a few months. I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, but we did order food to go fairly often (although I've only actually tried two items on their menu, pizza and one salad). Bootlegger was a great last resort place since the food is pretty satisfying and inexpensive.  

Their pizzas are ginormous. The whole pizza is filled with toppings.  Trust me, they are generous with toppings. I normally would eat about three slices. I could have eaten more probably, but I'd risk the buckles on my pants breaking, so I'd normally stop at 3. The salad my co-worker always ordered was also very good too, but I can't remember what it was called.

It's like Brooklyn New York meets California Subway Sandwich! 1 star for the Ceasar salad & another star for the dipping marinara sauce. I couldn't understand what happened to the big portion, enough for 2 days and 2 people size lasagna everyone is raving about. I guess Slater thought we wouldn't notice and didn't I tell him we were hungry? (See photo) the description was meat lasagna with meat sauce and there was noting of the sort. I think there was ground sausage and mostly bread crumbs the meat sauce was straight up marinara. As a matter of fact, I thought he brought as the veggie lasagna and verified with Slater that it was in fact their ""Meat"" lasagna. I think they also forgot the lasagna noodles and tried to cover it up with a huge slice of mozzarella that encased the entire 2 inch by 2 inch piece of Lasagna. The deficient piece of lasagna looked more like a large one side ravioli with a huge piece of government cheese on top. The sausage & peppers sandwich was an assemble of 2 pieces of crunchy peppers ( 1 piece red & 1 piece green at one end of the sandwich and caramelized cold onions at the other end. They didn't even bother to throw the 2 in a pan to hear and combine then with the marinara sauce before putting them in the roll. The marinara sauce on the side? Nothing on the bread roll and barely toasted. Did I say I was on a diet?  Atmosphere is clean and fresh smelling. I would expect some garlic wafting out of the kitchen especially since there are  many large family posters everywhere. Not my mommas house.",U0kiORl1Gpc8K9jOWWgHzg,0,0,2,OP6BxoU0e35OpQOFdTBhgg

I was there this past Saturday with a party of 9 having a 7:30 reservation.  We were sat by 7:40, awesome.  The server came over took our drink order immediately and had the beverages out in a reasonable amount of time.  Then we ordered our food, a few of us ordered salads.  The salads were out in about fifteen minutes.... completely acceptable.  They were all delicious, and while we waited for them we were brought the garlic bread which is always yummy.  Then we waited for our food.  We understand that for a party that size it may take a few min longer.  But we waited and waited and waited.  We brought it to the managers attention after an hour, she was snappy with us saying the kitchen is backed up and we'd have to wait.  By 9:10 I begged the server to please just bring the two children in our party their food.  They received that within ten more minutes.  Finally at 9:35 our food came out, more than an hour and a half after ordering.  We let the manager know we weren't happy and it was unacceptable.  Once the food came out, a few orders were correct.  We had three vegetarians in the party.  We thought we were good ordering vegetarian dishes.  Two orders of eggplant parmesan and a Cappelini de Pomodoro.  The eggplant was delicious, however the pasta with it couldn't be eaten.  The Pomodoro on the other hand had a thick meat sauce.  I ended up not eating at all. The server offered to replace the dish but after the wait for the first time around, I didn't figure I'd make it to work the next morning had I of waited!  The manager reluctantly took off 25%, but after the experience we had that didn't feel like the right compensation.  The manager was rude to the servers who were trying to appease the guests, they were fighting amongst themselves over which tables should get their food first.  It was really an awful restaurant experience.  I felt bad because I really talked this place up to my family who was in visiting from California and it did not compare to my set up of it.",EWHD8LJ6MyYkbfAB3HxYGw,0,1,2,V42DEeZREiO4OkZEJxGihg

It's cool to know the folks that have hung in this joint, the image the deals that have been made, but at the end of the day, everyone is eating.

Nice dining room, with live music and an atmosphere that encourages relaxing, having a drink or three and talking about whatever your business is that particular evening.

Grab yourself a whiskey Old Fashion, Scotch or Martini or even a nice red wine - something to set the mood, that dark, swank crooner era vibe and enjoy.

We started with the Calamari Fritti or your basic breaded and fried calamari.  Meh, little chewy for me, probably wouldn't get it again.  Also, had the Antipasti Classic which is descried as Italian cold cuts, cheeses, olives, peppers and marinated vegetables.  Not that it wasn't those things, but it looked more like prosciutto with some parmigiana, roast red peppers, olives and maybe a pepperoncini.  Again, meh, wouldn't get it again.

For my entree I selected the Scallopini di Vitello and the picatta option.  That is a beautiful stack of veal cutlets sautéed in a lemon and wine sauce.  Yeah, it comes with pasta too.  Veal piccata is not complicated, it's simply a lightly breaded and pounded cutlet, cooked in a butter, lemon and wine with capers, but it's the simplicity of the dish that makes a legit serving stand out.  This is legit, with a complex and delicious blend of flavors and textures enhanced by the tart lemon, salty capers and a delectable pan sauce.

Eggplant Benny
French toast
House stack pancakes
Fried ravioli with marinara
Lasagna
Basilico pizza with artichoke
Panetti breads and marinara
Cannoli

I used to go to the Bootlegger as a tourist when it was at its previous location of Trop and Eastern.  This was the second time I've been to this location.

Meeting at 10:30 so we could try some breakfast items before breakfast service starts, the best of the three items we tried was the eggplant Benny.  This was a unique take on eggs Benedict with the base being eggplant.  I am not a big pancake person but I did try some of this and found it to be light and of good flavor especially with the imported (from the Northeast) pure maple syrup one of the group carries with them for breakfasts just in case a place serves syrup made by someone's aunt.

Of the lunch dishes we ordered, the ravioli were very good.  The menu says it's a light breading and it was.  The pizza with artichoke was adequate.  The crust was not crisp but this is their style.

For dessert, the cannoli were standard except for the fact that they had and orange zest flavor to the filling which unusual to find at most Italian restaurants.  It gave a fresh taste to some rather standard, crispy shell cannoli.

The panetti breads with marinara was a bit of a disappointment for me.  They were too doughy for my taste.

This is a solid place for either breakfast or lunch although I'd go for lunch more than the breakfast selections.  It's a 24 hour place with video poker at the bar and it's a step up from the normal 24 hour places that dot the Las Vegas Valley.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,11,3,u9cBbrXO_sd6WeVEEWRmHg

3983534,2007-07-20,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"It is with pleasure that I write this first review. On a Sunday night, my friends and I attempted to find quality Italian food and found the Bootlegger Bistro sitting in a loud corner of not much else. The atmosphere was dark and the music all over the place. At one point they started to play 90's rock after getting tired of playing the same jazz hit 5 times in an hour. The service was lacking. The waitress seemed to have forgotten us much of the time and sitting there, we distinctly thought we could smell a waft of the good old ganja. She seemed really happy anyway...

Vic called for the Bootlegger Hot Mixed Antipasti. Bland. The Toasted Ravioli might as well have been slightly stale pasta flavored Playdough with very basic marinara used for everything that night. The House Specialty Shrimp wasn't exactly special. Though the calamari was not bad. Not over cooked and normal enough to be edible.

I ordered Manicotti Infornati because I love ricotta wrapped in pasta and served with marinara, but I found that the ricotta was underwhelming and the marinara was lacking in herbs. My main course was overall a thorough disappointment considering that the plates were priced a little heavier than I like. (I like inexpensive. Inexpensive is the joy of students). 

We waffled back and forth on dessert and in the end, we succumbed to our dark love of sweets. One was a Cannoli that had a strong taste of orange liqueur. Maybe Grand Marnier. The liqueur taste was strong, but for once, I was pleased and even infatuated with it. But that's if you're an orange flavor lover like me. The moment of sheer beauty and bliss however, was our Tiramisu. Absolutely fantastic and the reason why this restaurant has 3 stars. There was a distinct flavor of alcohol, but it was superbly balanced with the sweetness and that richness that is Tiramisu. It was in a word: transcendent. I have never found Tiramisu to be an appealing dessert till now, but every time I near Vegas, that will be one of the highlights of all my trips. The Tiramisu.

It's actually 2.5 for the price range.

V reminded me: the either discriminated against us for either age or race (not sure which) because the hospitality was definitely lacking with only our table as the host floated from diner to diner except our group and shook hands with everyone as they left except for us.",rSci7lMJMWO4xTrMlgfikA,1,0,3,swUDX8keX22DMgnzxGgTew

Two dinning options. 
 You can sit in the dinning room with live music or sit in the lounge. We opted for the lounge to watch the game and have a bit less noise. The live music can be a little loud, especially if it is not your taste in music. 
 The lounge area had tables and chairs. The booths and the bar area you have to be 21+. 

They serve complimentary garlic bread with marinara sauce to dip in. It's very easy to fill up on this stuff because it is so good. 
For appetizers we took the advice of our server and got the stuffed mushrooms. Also ordered the wedge salad.
Both were delicious! I had to refrain from licking the left over cream sauce that the mushrooms come in from the plate. 
The wedge salad was good too. Had a creamy blue cheese dressing on it. The blue cheese was just right, not over powering in flavor. 

I was torn between the spaghetti with meat sauce or their pappardelle bolognese. So I went with our server's suggestion again and got the bolognese. The big egg noodles were very filling. The sauce was creamy, meaty and very tasty! 
My guy ordered their chicken fettuccine alfredo. The creamy alfredo sauce was good. 
Portions of both pastas were worth the price. 

I was smart and saved room for dessert. My guy went home hurting from overeating. I picked out the lemon cheesecake for us to split and I am so glad I did! I've never had anything like it. The flavor of lemon had a strong presence and was perfectly tart to balance out the cheesecake. The graham cracker crust was excellent but my favorite part was the top. They had some kind of crumble baked on top that gave the cheesecake some texture. They also topped it with berries adding more flavor and texture.",FANt14cGQpOJskxQUQBK1g,3,1,4,WFUdNovLssZ5GpQcXCU4-w

Minestrone wasn't on the menu but after asking the server he came back with the best minestrone I've ever had.  Fast forward to regular dining hours, the minestrone tasted different but it was still very good, not sure if the first time was because I was so drunk and soup just hit the spot.

We were sitting at our table for 10 min before someone came to greet us. I ordered the chicken parm which was good. Too much cheese for me but the marinara sauce was great.My boyfriend ordered a Marsala and Alfredo combo and hated the Marsala sauce. We rarely complain about food but he has had Marsala before and this wasn't what he was expecting. The server took his food to the kitchen and came back another 10 min later and handed me his plate saying theres nothing she can do because theres nothing wrong with it. What?! After his dish was analyzed with fingers and forks they expect us to eat this and pay for it!? I work in the industry and was pretty appalled by this. I asked to talk to the manager who never came. Instead, the server came back and magically found a way to take the Marsala off our bill and then ignored us for the duration of our dinner.

We heard about Bootleggers from a coworker and decided to give it a try. We arrived early and were seated right away at a booth per our request. We ordered Martini's and a bottle of Pellegrino. The Garlic Rolls arrived before our drinks! Our server, Alfredo (yes that's his real name) was prompt and very helpful! We started with Bruschetta and a side of meatballs. The Bruschetta was fresh and delicious and the Meatballs were the best I've ever eaten!! They were moist and bursting with flavor!! We then ordered salads Caesar and Caprese. Fresh and delicious!! We also ordered a bottle of Bongiovanni Barolo, which Alfredo suggested decanting (Good Call because it had sediment). It was Amazing and paired nicely with our entrees - Lasagna and Seafood Pasta. The Lasagna was the best I've ever had and the Seafood Pasta was packed full of Calamari, Scallops, Shrimp and Crab. My only complaint is the shrimp was slightly over cooked. For dessert we ordered the Cannoli - to die for!! I also wanted to mention the piano player. I didn't get his name but he had a great voice and was a dead ringer for Sinatra! I requested Tom Jones but he didn't know any of his songs and he said he would learn for our next visit.",C6kw0Rny7jZAGjTj0MWA3Q,3,1,5,ozElIRQ6wxwAP-5zOlbNSA

Ordered two of their boneless chicken breast paninis with the pesto sauce over the phone, came in 20 minutes later and unfortunately they made two chicken parmesan sandwiches instead. No big deal, easy fix, cashier was very nice about it. 

What kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the manager rushed in, started correcting my order on their point of sale terminal, slammed her keys down, and sped past me, through the dining room leading to the hallway, and never even once smiled or acknowledged the mistake. While I understand the floor was a little busy at the time, I would have appreciated somewhat of a acknowledgment. 

Still waiting on the food, and the manager just ran out the takeout doors, cigarettes in hand and lighting up as I type, right outside the door. Still no food yet. I can't make this up. This is incredible.

Based on reviews here, it seems like a nice place that truly wants to give that vintage experience, however I feel that my experience missed the mark.

Edit: So disappointed. Menu advertises the chicken pesto panini as coming with lettuce and tomato. Check the picture I uploaded. No lettuce, no tomato, a smudge of sauce, and barely any fries. All this for 11 dollars is seriously upsetting.",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,2,0,1,rX5VJ4PQcuouw1qUWCjekg

4429661,2017-11-27,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Prologue:
My fiancee and I arrived in Las Vegas a few hours later than we had anticipated and we were looking for someplace good to have dinner that was open late.
The attendant at the RV Park where we were staying recommended this restaurant.


The Plot:
After taking a few minutes to look over their Night Owl menu, we started by sharing an order of Calamari Fritti followed by the Papardelle Bolognese entree.

My fiancee also spotted the Steak & Eggs Breakfast on the menu and, since it was nearly midnight in Las Vegas, she decided to order that as well.


The Scene:
The portion sizes were decent and were plenty for the two of us.

The Calamari Fritti was marinated and lightly breaded then flash fried and served with marinara sauce.
My fiancee usually passes on fried foods, especially appetizers. However, she did enjoy this dish and remarked about how tender and tasty the calamari was.

The Papperdelle Bolognese consisted of imported egg noodles with traditional Bolognese meat sauce and shaved parmesan cheese.
Thinking back it occurred to me that it had been quite a long time since the last time I ordered wide egg noodles at a restaurant; it's something you don't see on most menus.
The texture of the egg noodles was perfect for me, the Bolognese sauce was spot on, and this dish took me right back to my childhood.
This was the first time my fiancee tried pasta with Bolognese sauce and she was very impressed.

The ambiance and decor were very Las Vegas, which was a nice touch.
The prices were reasonable for late night in Las Vegas.

The Rest of the Story:
The Steak & Eggs Breakfast was just that. We ordered the steak medium well and that's exactly how it was prepared. The home fries were very good, cooked just a little crispy and nicely seasoned. Otherwise this dish was nothing special.

They were out of the Antipasti Classico, which was a little disappointing.
However, the Calamari Fritti made up for it.

Epilogue:
Good food, reasonable prices, and convenient location open 24 hours deserved 4 stars.
However, we decided to settle on 3 stars due to the Steak & Eggs Breakfast being subpar compared to the other items.
We'll be sure to stick with only Italian food next time.",lNDoRrMrdrK-Gd8Yllgpkg,5,2,3,SvfpMdTynR7S7sD0ct2Ssw

The group of waiters all took care of us and kept up with our refills and kept our table clean. 

The only reason a star is missing is because the male hostess was not very friendly or welcoming. I wanted to sit at an available booth but said we couldn't have it because a person with a reservation may want it later that night. When we walked out he didn't acknowledge us as a hostess should.

We get there, and sit at a little table right in the bar area and were told HH is only at the bar. I am literally, 3 feet from the bar and my left arm wingspan can touch it. Okay, no big deal. We move to the bar order some drinks. The bartender gives us two regular menus and two, ""VIP Gaming menus"" and nothing is showing their HH pricing. We asked what was on HH and instead of five different foods, it was only three   Wings, fingers and mozzarella sticks. Okay. While looking over the menu we notice we have two different menus so we ask which was the right one and she didn't even know, lol. So we decided to order the sliders and a few other things and then she tells us they no longer have those. (we now know which one the right menu is.) We end up ordering the chicken wings and fries with a side of mozzarella sticks. 

I have had a company dinner here numerous times and it wasn't bad, although Ventano's is 100x better. These wings, fries and mozzarella sticks were awful. They legit tasted exactly like the shit from Jack in the Box. It's sad that I know what those taste like but when I go to JITB I know what to expect. I expected a lot more from a well known restaurant like Bootlegger. I am sure they went to the frozen food section at Smith's, grabbed a couple of items to put on their happy hour menu, threw them in a fryer and called it good.

Dining wise:
The Bootlegger's history is well entwined with Las Vegas. This family owned restaurant goes back generations. When you come in, you will be greeted by a mechanical host looking right at you. I can't lie, it has fooled a few friends of mine. The main restaurant is split into two parts: a bar and a more standard dining area. The Bootlegger is open 24 hours and makes decent drinks. The food is traditional Italian with hefty portions. When in doubt, ask the knowledgeable staff. They do know their stuff. One thing I always get is the tiramisu. So good. 

Host wise:
They have two main rooms you can use. The smaller room can hold up to 60/70 people but they will be a little crammed in there. If you ask they can serve buffet style to your guests as well as plated meals. My only problem with the room is that it is pretty narrow for larger events. Not much room to socialize. 

The largest room they have comes equipped with a stage, sound system, fully stocked bar, and plenty of tables for up to 200. It is a beauty of a room!",zKAwyRCGNpZ0fHu67YBUrg,4,1,4,PNimTQFpkPmacNMg8qN7UQ

It's amazing to me that this place is opened 24/7. They also have live music I believe around 9PM which adds to the ambiance. I'd say it has a very classic Italian feel with dim lighting, candlelight, & professional waiters. 
But the important part is the food. I've been here I'd say 3-4 times now, and have ordered something different every time, and I have liked everything. the dinner salads are huge, the chicken piccata is delicious, spaghetti and meatballs a safe and yummy choice. My in-laws ordered the baked penne, and bolognese, both delish. The bread with marinera before your meal is great, warm and always tasty. The only gripe is the desserts we ordered were just ok. Good not great. The cannoli's had a citrusy flavor, and chocolate chips, which to us was just a tad odd tasting. FYI, the bar has video poker, if you like playing while you drink.

Their lasagna was untraditional, or at least, not what I expect from a lasagna dish. The pasta was rolled around the meat, with the sauce compacted onto one side of the dish. We didn't find the meat until we had eaten all the sauce, so we were left with a pile of pasta and dry meat. It was unappetizing. 

I also had a turkey sandwich, which was fine, as far as turkey sandwiches go. I did really enjoy the french fries, although I have a sneaky suspicion that they were of the frozen variety.

I won't be coming back anytime soon, unless friends want to come, and then I would join. I think this place has potential...I just did not have a good experience. 

This actually was not my first time here...the first time was a few months ago...we came in and stood at the front entrance for about 10 minutes, and no one ever came around. We flagged a waitress down and she did tell us that they were super busy and understaffed...so even if we chose to stay, which we did not, it would have been a long wait for food too. 

So I have been looking forward to coming back here since I have heard good things,  and obviously we came on a bad night the first time.  Well, not sure this was much better. The staff was very friendly when we sat down. I ordered the eggplant appetizer, which was good.  Then I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with no meat on top. 

The Fettuccini was very thick and had formed a film on the top from obviously sitting too long. I tasted it, and it was luke warm. I immediately lost my appetite for it.  Another person at my table had the same problem with her Alfredo.  She mentioned it to the waiter, and he offered to give me a fresh plate of pasta.  Well, ok.  I'd love a hot fresh plate of pasta. While I'm waiting, the waiter made a point to come tell me that the cook stuck a thermometer in it and it was 140degrees. Ok?! And!?  I told him the bottom of the plate was warm, so maybe it touched the bottom. So a few minutes later, I get my same plate of pasta, boiling hot!  That would be great, except it was obvious he put it in the microwave, because now the fat had separated from the cream, and the plate of pasta was all oily. Wow. 

Anyway, the manager did come over and apologize and take it off my bill. The eggplant was decent, and the other waiter Alfredo was super friendly. So, I think this place has potential...so I will give it 3 stars for now.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,1,2,3,vJDbJG51pN8KLiHoZDNqxw

The food tonight was worth 4 stars, however the service was a completely different story.

I came her with a friend who has been coming here since the 70s and he said we had to sit at the bar because there is a bar menu which basically gives you half orders.

We sat at the bar and there were two guys behind the bar...we got Fred as our server....

What we quickly discovered about Fred is, it was obvious Fred never met my friend and I know he never met me; so when Fred was all done catering to the regulars, then we got taken care of.  Fred was good when we sat down, he brought us menus and drinks and then we sat and watched Fred cater to the regulars.  When he ran out of regulars to take care of he came back to us.

I have to say this was one of the worst experiences I've had here.  The food was good, but the service should have been better.  My money is just as green as the regulars..to treat me different because you don't know me, gets you the rating above.

I am not to sure about the history in this restaurant but there is an actual mannequin at the check in desk. I am not sure who or what it was suppose to represent or resemble. But it sure did freak my kid out. 
Onward to the food, after we sat down our waiter took our drink order. Which was nice, afterwards our drinks were brought along with some garlic knots. I would say those garlic knots where so addicting and probably my current favorite item on the menu.
After reviewing the menu, me and my son decided to order the lasagna, my son's option was a meat one and I ordered the vegetarian one.
Now the kids dishes are pretty good size, and enough to fill em up. Now my lasagna was decent and not the greatest, my broccoli on top of my lasagna was so thick and crunchy it was hard to eat together and I really didn't understand why it was prepared that way.
I definitely will not order that again and will probably try something else. I just couldn't get pass the weird texture and bland flavor.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,5,3,3,vAUood8R10HpIfloAOlfPQ

4573120,2010-11-23,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"I, as the late night guru, am required to review Bootlegger's. On the south end of the strip, Bootlegger's is an Italian 24/7 restaurant. I would love to give this place five stars but I believe that taste should play a big part in ratings. 

So here goes, start with the positives. The location and ambiance are excellent. Parking is plentiful but scantly lit. Upon entering past 1am, as I do constantly, you have to ring a bell and be buzzed in (Something I really have grown to love, reminds me of old Vegas etiquette. If there were a password, I would have given this place an automatic 5 stars). Bootlegger's eating areas are dark, candle lit booths, very awesome. The service was definitely impeccable, each waiter introduces themselves with a business card, and pretty much never leaves you unattended.

Now, the food. *sigh*
I expected much better after all the reviews I've heard and read. We ordered the lasagna, a tomato/basil pizza, and pomodorro. The red sauce is old style, heavily spiced but still tastes like it's missing something. The pizza was decent, dough was soft yet crunchy with the same red sauce used on the lasagna. The pomodorro is what disturbed me, a simple recipe that's hard to ruin, the tomatoes were passed there ripening. I am willing to give it another try, it may have been that their tomatoes turned and got into all the sauces in my last visit, but we'll definitely have to see.

Give it a try if you need a different spin on 24/7 dining which is seriously why I love Las Vegas so much.",YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA,3,2,3,gerCNCRbCyr-cfhYbv2pVg

After being seated we placed orders as usual. We received some bread and marinara sauce, which was great, and shrimp cocktail.

The food wasn't spectacular but it was very good and above average for sure. It was a nice option for a meal off the strip. 

As much as I enjoyed my dish, I will say the lasagna was the way to go. I can definitely see why they call it their house specialty. I ordered the pollo Francese which came with a side of fettuccini Alfredo. Really enjoyed the light white wine sauce and the chicken was a thicker cut of breast than usual but sautéed well. The fettuccini was thankfully on the lighter side of takes on pasta with Alfredo sauce.

Ordering Mid-rare and getting one under or one over can be ok, but taking it to well is just gross. I didnt say anything to her, not sure why.

This time was around by boyfriend wanted to go. Im always happy to give second chances. Although I love the ""were keeping it old vegas look"" food just mediocre, and service was almost non-existence. 

I had my camera out and was taking pictures of my man when our server asked if we wanted a photo together, mind you we wernt dressed to impress so I  said no, any girl would we looked like shit. Our server nearly insulted us by assuming we were ""hiding"" or ""cheaters"" when we didn't want a photo and kinda chucked away. WTF. Anyways to food and drink.

Drinks: BF-MAKERS OLDFASHION (just ok, think they added sugar?!)
              ME-MAKERS MANHATTAN UP (delicious)

APS: CALAMARI- very nice
          EGGPLANT FRITTI- Love eggplant but breading on it sucks.
          MUSSELLS DIAVALO- eh. Not good. Too much tomato sauce.

They served the same marinara sauce with the bread( which was good), the calamari, the eggplant fritti, and I swear they just dumped the same sauce over the mussells and heated it.

We wern't going to get an entree but I was still hungry and we didn't have anything to cook at home so I got a pasta. 

PASTA: BUCATINI W PANCETTA, PEAS, AND CARBONARA-not bad. Hey I am no aficionadoon pasta but I didnt think that the bucatini was a right choice for this pasta, I meant a bucatini would hold a chunky meat sauce so much better than a no so thick carbonara. Overall it was yum, I took it home to finish:)

Probably not going to give it another whirl, I am not a food snob I just know whats good and what I like. I dont discourage others to eat here, there are tons of people I know who love this place, for me its just not my style. CIAO",y-0Nshj21iCw5Q9mS_N23A,0,0,2,3W0tr1U7jSu8EqeusxK8gA

I assume they use them after midnight when they are open, but they lock the doors and make you ring a bell? We were not that late. 
We got there before midnight and got a late night menu. I was not that hungry, and wanted to keep the price low so I ordered the French Toast mostly out of curiosity that they coat it with Captain Crunch cereal. I expected to actually have crunchy toast and it was not. Overall I wasn't really impressed and probably would not order this again. They give you bread at the beginning and the star of that is the marinara sauce that comes with it. Both my husband and I agreed, it was very good. My husband got the vegetable lasagna and he liked it but it didn't really look like a lasagna, it had a LOT of cheese. I got to try it and enjoyed it, but it felt very decadent for someone that is trying to lose weight. 
One of us ordered tea and never got a refill or an offer for one. Being late the service was eh. The bartender spent all her time talking to locals or regulars or friends? Then one waiter.

I've actually eaten at Bootlegger's a few times before this last visit on Monday night.  Jenny D. and I were on a double-date and didn't realize it was Monday night Cabaret open mic, which was a nice little treat.  

The last few times I've eaten at Bootlegger's, I was NOT impressed with the pastas.  The only thing I had ever liked there were the pizzas, but Jenny had gone in a week before and was ranting and raving about the Diavolo so I decided to give it another chance.  I ordered the Osso Bucco and my date ordered the Lasagna.  OMG my Osso Bucco was SO GOOD.  Instead of one giant shank, it was 5 small ones.  The meat was fall-off-the bone tender and so full of a robust flavor.  It came on top of risotto and asparagus.  I completely cleaned my plate.  Unfortunately I was too full to try my date's lasagna but he said it was the top 2 best lasagnas he has ever had.  

In addition, we ordered the Caprese salad, bruschetta, canoli, and tiramisu.   The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the canoli.  It tasted a bit like artificial sweetener.  

Everything from the food to the service was great.  We lucked out because a reservation for a booth got canceled and the hostess (maître d'?) sat us there.  It was a primo spot with a clear view of the cabaret.  We had an amazing time.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,7,1,5,JrcT0X4Pj_GKBOAnpccLnw

The atmosphere, the service, the food!! All incredible!  The service is so beyond excellent!!

We started out with the house side salad and it was absolutely delicious. I tried the house Italian and the blue cheese and oh my! Both were absolutely delicious. Especially with the small garlic knots ;-)

I ordered the chicken scalopini piccata and asked for linguini with extra sauce instead of the fettuccini Alfredo. My husband ordered the osso buco and our friends had the eggplant Parmesan.

The piccata was very tasty and the portion was very large.  I tend to prefer my piccata a bit more lemony, but the sauce was layered while subtle.  The linguini was sadly not al dente; while I did not ask for it to be, I expect good Italian restaurants to automatically serve pasta al dente. That's the only reason I gave this restaurant four stars instead of five.

The osso buco was absolutely outstanding!  The risotto was slightly crispy and the intricate flavour very nicely accompanied the robustness of the meat.  The heavy dark sauce exploded with flavour.

The eggplant Parmesan was traditional prepared and served with one of the best marinara I have ever tasted. Absolutely outstanding!

We ended the meal with tiramisu and hot molten chocolate cake. The tiramisu was light and delicious, but the lava cake was the clear winner - wow!!!!!!  Foodgasmic!!

Stopped in for lunch and had a very pleasant server named Janie. No complaints on service with her at all! Food was ok in taste but nothing like I remember it! Caesar salad was really good but overpriced for lunch.  Next, came the issue. My daughter ordered cheese ravioli with their rose sauce rather than marinara. We didn't wait an unreasonable amount of time before our entrees were served, but my daughter's plate reached the table with marinara sauce rather than rose sauce! She told the server and Janie did recall the request.  The dish was remade with the correct sauce and of course we ate in shifts because I was finished with my lunch by then.  My daughter requested to speak with the manager regarding a discount on the meal for all the inconvenience.  The server said she would ""get the manager"" and she graciously apologized for the situation.  The so called manager NEVER came to the table and told the server he ""wouldn't discount or take off anything.""  I've never seen such poor customer relations in ANY restaurant I've been to! What makes it worse is that he had no sack to do his own dirty work! He had the server come over and convey his answer! She was very nice and apologetic and I felt bad that he even put his employee in an awkward position. But we will not be going back to The Bootlegger nor will we recommend this place to visitors.

4996133,2016-04-01,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"In the two years that I've lived in the Vegas area, I've frequently heard good things about this place -- mostly along the lines of it being a very good, old-school Italian restaurant & having live music most (if not all) evenings.

I FINALLY got there last night, for dinner with a friend.   

While the owners & I guess the recipes go back 60+ years, their current location is basically in a modern strip-mall complex along Las Vegas Blvd.

They have a small outdoor seating section, which actually would be a lot of fun on a nice day or night, but we opted to sit inside on our first visit, to get a better few for everything.

We arrived at about 6:30PM on a Thursday, easily found parking by the front door, and were promptly seated (no reservation).

The interior is pretty nice -- lots of old photos of the family on the wall, a nice looking bar section, and then a couple dining sections.  We were seated in what was probably the main seating area, since it was where the small stage with a Baby Grand piano was.  Ambience was pretty classic -- dark red tablecloths, red walls, etc. while customer attire ran the gamut.  I was there in jeans & a t-shirt, some groups were semi-formally dressed, and one table had people in shorts & a t-shirt.  
I don't think the management really minds much, however now that I know what the place is like, I would not personally feel comfortable just wearing shorts, a t-shirt & sandals.   This was a spur of the moment dining location for me, & while I wouldn't feel uncomfortable going back in casual attire, if I know I'm headed there, I'll at least wear a nice shirt, but even with that, the staff is still dressed nicer than at least 50% of the clientele.

All the staff was very friendly & professional -- shortly after we were seated, we were offered ice water.  Our drink order was taken when the menus were delivered, and pretty much as soon as we were ready to order, the waiter was there to take it.   Right after our order was placed, we received a gratis appetizer of 'garlic bread balls' & marinara dipping sauce -- good stuff!

My friend ordered meat lasagna, and I (a vegetarian) ordered a side salad, and spaghetti marinara.

My salad arrived within about 5 minutes, and was very good, albeit nothing too special or elaborate.   About this time, a young woman, accompanied by a pianist, started signing.  It was a nice touch, but not too loud to prevent a conversation at our table.

About 15- 20 minutes after we placed our order, or entrees arrived, and we were both offered Parmesan cheese added to the top.

  My friend said his lasagna was very good, and I know my spaghetti was too.   Spaghetti with marinara sauce & Parmesan cheese sprinkles is pretty basic of course -- as a hapless bachelor type, spaghetti with marinara sauce is one of the few meals I can actually make at home  -- but their marinara sauce is clearly something freshly made & the result of true, old-school Italian family tradition -- you won't find that sort of flavor in a can or jar at the grocery store...

Quantity of both my pasta & my friend's lasagna was good.  By no means was it 'family-style,' nor did we have any leftovers, but the portions were enough for two good-sized adult males to fill their bellies.

It AMAZES me to think that this place is open 24/7!   I'd live to get there at 2 or 4AM sometime, just to see how if it's still a classy-casual kind of place.    I expect the late night/early morning operation is subsidized by video poker machines (& players) at the bar.

My one & only complaint?   The prices.   Call me a cheapskate -- it's very true that as someone who lives in the LV area who likes dining-out, I need to be careful with my meal budget.  But I also know that for $15 or less at some casino buffets, I can get my fill of a large variety of decent food plus a drink.  That fact is always in the back of my mind, though I am not trying to compare a relatively cheap casino buffet to a meal experience at a very nice, old-school Italian place with linen napkins & waiters wearing suits & ties.

$16 for a plate of spaghetti marinara?  Well, I'll reluctantly say OK to that, but only because of the overall ambience plus live music.  $3 for my iced tea (free refills)? I can live with that.   But I was surprised to see that my tasty but nothing-extraordinary side salad was $8.   In my experience, at many comparable places, that salad would have been included in the price of the entree.  This place is not some touristy place on The Strip that can get away with charging a lot simply because tourists have been programmed to expect to pay a lot while in the LV area for vacation.  It's almost like there's a surcharge for wanting to eat healthy...

 Our stomaches were pleasantly full so we passed on desert this time.

I absolutely do expect to be back -- curiosity may have me stop by if I'm hungry & in the area at 3AM one of these days, or if I'm on a somewhat casual date, it's a nice lunch or dinner option.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,2,1,4,Zqz5i-v8RP8GkozgeWpEqQ

I knew immediately this would be a place my husband and I would love. I mentioned to Joel I'd like to go there and on a Tuesday he surprised me with an early dinner. 

Bootleggers Bistro is located on Las Vegas Blvd and it's been there forever! Since we were there at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday the place was empty. Which was fine with us. No waiting and they still had some excellent tunes from Sinatra to Louie Prima. It's a dimly lit place with a large bar. They also have a small stage with a piano. 

Our server was on point and quickly poured out water and handed us menus. Bootleggers has all the Italian classics. Since I can eat very little these days it's become a whole new way of ordering. Joel and I decided to split an appetizer and an entree. We picked the Antipasto plate and the Baked Penne. The food came out super fast. First, the Antipasto plate which was huge! It contained the best marinaded mushrooms, bell peppers, and chickpeas. Plus, it was filled with ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone, and fresh mozzarella. I was in heaven. Then it got better when they brought us out their epically awesome garlic knots and the marinara sauce was seriously life changing!! Our waitress brought out our piping hot Baked Penne. This is one of Joel's favorite Italian items. It's probably the best Baked Penne we've ever had. The ricotta cheese was so sweet and creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The sauce and meat the mealies in your mouth along with the bites of cheese and pasta. 

What an amazing meal! I can't stop thinking about every part of it. I seriously will be back ASAP!! The service rocks, the ambiance is romantic ( even at 3:30pm) and the food is mind blowing!!! For your next date night go here! You'll for sure impress. Bonus, Bootleggers Bistro is open 24 hours!!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,5,3,5,Z1gVVdh-8GrqpDI7ufoxjQ

The Restaurant has been in business for over 50 years and has been staying true to the Matriarch's recipes, which separate the Bootlegger from their competition. 

The site is also well appointed with red leather booths, an attractive dining-room and a full service bar. They also had a harp player who made the dinning experience that much more rewarding. 

As for the food, we stared with the Classical antipasto which was absolutely amazing. 
The portion was extremely generous and included fine Italian cheeses, multiple salami's olives and much more (see picture). For the main course we had the spaghetti with meatballs and a Chicken entree with artichokes, sausages and hot peppers which was a special request on my part, which they gladly accommodated.

My pasta which should have been baked and come out piping hot and was barely warm.  Had to take almost the whole thing to go so I could properly heat it myself.  My mother in law ordered the cod and you could smell it the minute the waiter brought it to the table...extremely fishy and it cost $22 so needless to say she was very disappointed.

5033854,2011-10-10,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"I find this restaurant utterly intriguing in theory. It is a 24 hour establishment known for its ""old-style Vegas"" vibe. There's not much of that sort of thing going on out here, so I was game.

Booze and the promise of good ""red sauce"" Italian-American eats (plus a Groupon) brought me to the Bootlegger late the other night. Overall, I think this is a solid 3.5 star place.

The hot, fresh garlic bread was a hit. I thought the red sauce served along side was just a tad thin and missing an ingredient or two. Not a bad base sauce, but not bursting with flavor. The bread was a perfect accompaniment to the big ol' cocktails we started off with.

Our hot Antipasto appetizer came out very quickly, was nicely presented and of a good size for two. I truly enjoyed the toasted meat ravioli (but again with the lackluster side dish of red sauce) and wished there had been more of that and less of the other two selections. The calamari was just okay. The shrimp scampi was rubbery and really didn't have any taste at all despite the pool of buttery sauce. I don't quite understand how scampi sauce can not taste like anything- it's garlic and butter! Two of my favorite things, together in a bowl. I could not taste any garlic nor butter. I really wonder what's in that sauce; it could have been yellow water for all I know. I took a bite of one shrimp and let my less discriminating husband polish off the rest of it. 

For our entrees, we both had veal scalloppini with fettucini alfredo. The veal medallions were tender and tasty, with sauteed mushrooms mixed in. I got the impression that the sauce from the veal was a slightly modified version of the alfredo sauce on the (nicely al dente) pasta. There was very little distinction of the flavors, though both sauces were passably good (better than the red, for sure). Maybe a little bit of salt and definitely some fresh grated parmesan would have set the dish off. The portion size was just right and left us with just enough room to share an outstanding and large slice of tiramisu. 

The staff and service were fine, not over the top, but attentive/friendly enough for me. I did like the dark, fairly romantic atmosphere and oversized leather booths. The Bootlegger reminded me a lot of some of my old Italian spots in New York, which is nice. The meal felt expensive, even with the Groupon, so I don't know how often I'd make a special trip for these hit-or-miss eats, but it's always handy to know about an extra late night choice.",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,2,2,3,OQgv0YKI4N4veFwtSnD8gw

Well, that's hopeful wishing. To even find an Italian restaurant open at midnight is another struggle. We came across bootleggers through yelp! Open 24/7?! Sold! Although No cheesy garlic bread and no truffle chicken carbonara...So I settled with chicken Alfredo and complimentary garlic knots. 

Alfredo was pretty good! I wish it was more saucey! Please don't be shy on that Alfredo juice, no one ever complained about their pasta being too saucey, and if they did, they're a fool. Garlic knots tasted stale. But who cares. You can't complain about free stuff. That's just begging and choosing. So of course we ate it all!! Happily..... 

Environment wasn't rude but it wasn't friendly. Our server did his job, and made sure we got everything we needed and at an appropriate time. Very straight shoot ""get you in, get you out"" type of service. I wasn't upset about it.

This last visit, my party ordered the lasagna, beef and cheese raviolis and fettuccine Alfredo. We were all beyond happy with our selections. Even more happy with the generous portions that three of us went home with leftovers that we enjoyed later that night for dinner. 

Make sure to order the calamari. It is cooked to perfection and has great seasoning on the coating. Also, as good as they are, try not to fill up on the little complimentary bread bites given pre-meal. Those things are little crack bites that will make you want to keep plopping them in your mouth and not leave room for your entree.

No Way!  This place is old school Vegas GOOD.  This is a place you expect to see the characters from 'Casino' at when you walk in the door.

Dark!  At first when you wander in out of the Vegas daytime.  Dark!  But you get used to it quickly.  Just be careful wandering around until your eyes adjust!!!

Eat in the dining area, not the bar area.  Very elegant, nice, comfortable (especially the booths), and sometimes they have live music!!  Not too loud, just right!!

Food?  Exactly what you would expect.  Italian perfection, great service & wine list, and a lot of options.  It's all good.  The antipasti appetizer was especially outstanding. Get the large one!  Their unique bread is outstanding as well.

Throw a dart at the menu... you can't go wrong.

And the service & professionalism from the staff is exactly what you'd expect from a 5-Star restaurant in Las Vegas.  If you're staying in a Strip Hotel, it's worth the cab ride!!!

Enjoy!!!!!",RNKwQjJ3cKRUnsaTjB7NrQ,2,0,5,ZDdPoD9uQCJa5yTSmDxe7A

This is a very solid Italian spot.  The atmosphere at dinner is low lit, warm, and welcoming with the piano bar and music.  Service is fast and has an old vegas / ""home cooked meal"" feel to it.

Prices are fair, especially for the quality and serving sizes.  

We have been here quite a few times, and try to order different things each time.  We have had the mussels/pasta, lasagna, ravioli, etc etc and all have been great tasting and an excellent night out.

I was expecting a restaurant but after entering the door, there was a bar with TV and was almost confused.  Part of the restaurant looked very elegant, from the tables and chairs, and decor looking like it came from the Queens dining room.  But then part of the restaurant had a English pub feeling to it.  Another hiccup I had was the very dim lighting in the restaurant.  My stepdad had to complain to me about how he couldn't read his menu.  It could be his old age or I might have to agree that the lighting was the problem.

We sat down and since we were only looking to eat light, ordered salads.  My stepdad ordered the Iceberg Wedge.  It had, as per the menu, ""Wedge of iceberg lettuce, crispy pancetta, scallion, chopped egg, tomato concasse topped with Maria's bleu cheese dressing.  I ordered Isalata di Casa.  It's prepared, as per the menu, Endive Saald with candied walnuts, gorgonza chees, shaved pear, tossed in house vinaigrette dressing.

After we got our salads, my stepdad looked at his and looked at mine.  He looked a little disappointed and as a good daughter, I suggested we switched.  It was a little hard to part ways with my Insalata Indivia because it looked amazing.  But I wanted to make sure my stepdad had a good time.  Tasting the Iceberg Wedge, I  regretted swapping my salad instead of asking the waiter to change my order to the Insalata Indivia.  Maria's bleu cheese dressing combined with all the other ingredients was just too rich and too much to handle.  I almost wanted to throw it in the trash if there was one next to me.  There was just too much going on with the salad.  Luckily, I was able to taste the Insalata Indivia and was very impressed with it.  The colors and the flavors combined were perfect.

Well, I hope you're not looking to have a cocktail or you have to use the restroom or you have a bad back.

1. We were seated on long tables with a railing behind us. We would have to literally crawl over people to get up to use the restroom, which thankfully we did not need to until the end of the show. The reason for this is below.

2. If I wanted to actually see the stage, I had to either turn my chair so that my back was facing the person I came with, or I had to turn my neck more than a 45 degree angle to even see the stage. Note, not every seat is like this.

3. There was a sign on the table that there was a two drink minimum. Fine, that's great, I'm in the mood for some cocktails and great music! Think again. I watched the entire section in front of the stage get excellent service from a cocktail waitress. About halfway through the show, I finally flagged her down and asked if we could have drinks. She rudely told me she would send over our server, instead of just helping us herself. A heavily tattooed young man came over and gave us our drinks. He vanished for the rest of the evening. Literally the last song he gave us our check. We would have liked more cocktails! But the other waitress wouldn't help us, and literally we could not get up and go to the bar.

I've been here a couple of times, and recommended it for a recent Christmas dinner with friends as we all like Italian food and I remember the décor as just being classic Italian and with wonderful selections.  The food is also delicious (our last Italian place went downhill, and the one before that closed - so on the lookout for a new one - this is the place!).

As I stated, the décor is really great - old school Italian with reds and dark woods.  The service was also really good - my glass was never empty and they were very patient with my toddler and able were able to provide her with a cup of milk with lid and straw.  Some of the more expensive restaurants can't accommodate this, so I always bring a sippy cup just in case.  

The food was phenomenal.  If you're looking for classic, great tasting Italian food, look no further.  Everything was tasty.  We first got a couple of platters of the Hot Mixed Antipasti of which I was able to snag a shrimp and calamari - both were really good, and the accompanying marinara sauce also had really good flavor.  For my entrée I got Baked Penne (easy to share with a toddler), and my husband got the Pork Chop Marsala - both dishes were really good.  My husband really would have preferred Chicken Marsala, but this was a good substitute.  The Baked Penne was also really good, and I had to stop myself from overeating!  

They also served bread with olive oil - my little girl gobbled that up!  As did everyone else at the table.

Overall, a great experience - would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good Italian dinner.

5277529,2014-02-10,11,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"I was invited here for dinner with the promise of being entertained by the most talented lounge singer in Las Vegas. Of course, how do you say no to that? The Bootlegger bistro is an old-school Vegas landmark whose owner was once a powerful lady in this town. The moment I walked in the door, I looked around and noticed that I was the youngest person in the dining room - everyone else had a good 20 years on me. No big deal. I've always been fond of the elderly - with their interesting stories and life experience. 

My friend Doug pointed to the gentleman playing the piano and said, ""there's Jimmy Hopper, the man with an amazing voice!"" 

I nodded then proceeded to order a bellini-tini and the tomato-basil bruschetta. My friend ordered some old-person's drink involving cognac and the escargot appetizer. This is an Italian restaurant with the typical Italian faire on their menu. I eyed an item that sounded delicious, the spinach ravioli in marinara sauce; unfortunately it was under the gluten-free section. After a moment of hesitation as I don't have Celiac disease and ultimately have no reason to order a gluten-free item, I decided to get it anyway because spinach and cheese sounded just way too good. At this point, my friend asked for another cognac drink and the fish of the day (mahi mahi with risotto and asparagus).

I thought the bellini-tini was great and that made up for the mediocre bruschetta appetizer. My friend, being a gentleman, offered me some of his escargot. They tasted pretty good! I don't know how much they cost but there were 4 or 5 of them on the plate so this is a fairly small item.

When my ravioli arrived, it was pretty delicious; the filling was perfect although the pasta pockets were a bit chewy because of being gluten-free I guess. Over all though, this is a fairly healthy item while being a huge entree so you are definitely getting good value for the price paid. 

I also got to try my friend's dish. Oh man, this item was so freaking good! The mahi mahi was flaky, moist, perfectly seasoned and the sauce it was in didn't overpower the fish. But you know what the best part was? The risotto underneath the fish. I could eat a whole bowl of this risotto! Yummmmmmmm! 

Meanwhile, Jimmy Hopper was over there belting out scores after scores, both oldies and songs he had written himself. Indeed, this man has a great great voice. My friend encouraged me to request a song so I did! Guess what song I requested? Royal. Yes! You're probably thinking, ""whhhaaat?! She's crazy - requesting an old-school Vegas lounge singer to sing a pop song!!"" But oh no. I'm not crazy. Because moments earlier, my friend told me that he heard Jimmy sang Royal yesterday and he was blown away at his rendition of Royal. So of course, my expectation was very high.

Jimmy read my request note, chuckled to himself and said, ""Oh man. I'm still working on this song because there's a lot of backup singing and I'm a one-man show."" So Jimmy then journeyed on to another oldie and finally, he turned on something from behind him and started the first notes of Royal. I was ecstatic!

Jimmy had modified this song to make it his own while still keeping true to the original melody.  This man is a genius. I LOVED this version of Royal! Where do I buy a CD of this particular song? 

Later that night, I was blown away again at Jimmy's musical ability when he started singing an opera song. Is there a musical genre that this man can't do? Hat's off to you sir! I'm so impressed!

Okay, so if you are too cool for jazz and lounge music, there's a bar area that's on the other side of the wall where you can just sit and have drinks. 

Come here for the music, ambience and the laid-back atmosphere. The food, though good, is just a bonus.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,21,19,4,m3rrB-xzqudwSRkm2LMmng

Located at the south end of Las Vegas Boulevard with a heritage stretching back to an era long past and a location off-Strip, it was with three friends and a smiling youngster that breakfast bridging to lunch was enjoyed at Bootlegger Bistro, the 24/7 space celebrated for late night music and red sauce Italian proving far more sedate so early in the day.

Not particularly well staffed at our 10:30am arrival, one friend left in a lobby that the waitress admittedly ""doesn't really check"" since most enter through the bar, it was with all soon accounted for that we were offered a cozy four-top alongside the windows overlooking the an outdoor patio, the rose lighting making for challenging pictures while music from the 50s played from speakers neither too soft nor too loud.

Admittedly timing the meal to coincide with the eleven o'clock transition from breakfast to lunch it was with both menus presented that eyebrows raised to bargain-basement prices, the pre-tip total of just over $80 a veritable bargain for such a table twice overflowing with food.

Starting off the day with breakfast, myself particularly famished after a late night and early morning run, it was in a trio of plates that opening bites were entrusted, a Pancake and French Toast pairing showing the former simple and fluffy while the latter was sweet with custard and cereal even before adding pure maple syrup from home, the Benny surprisingly excellent with crispy eggplant crowned in perfectly poached eggs and housemade red sauce.

Offering hot bread with each course, the first a basket of toasts from which ciabatta proved lovely for sopping up sauce, it was with a sizable basket of buttery garlic knots that the lunch portion of the morning kicked off, the fried ravioli stuffed with finely ground meat teaming with spices while the doughy pizza was only fair-to-middling compared to the restaurant's 'signature' lasagna, the enormous wedge topped in meat sauce and mozzarella more than enough to share.

Doing a lot of the legwork during on the lasagna when it came for dessert I almost decided to opt out, but spotting canollis made in the Italian tradition one couldn't help but order a trio, the crispy tubes elegant with bittersweet chocolate chips playing off cream tinged in orange zest.

***  Far better than many traditional 'checkered tablecloth' spots in town with favorable pricing considering the quality of the food, suffice it to say although I'm not sure I'd invest in the crowd and cost of dinner I'd strongly encourage anyone looking for breakfast or brunch in a Vegas Classic to give Bootlegger Bistro a look.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,3,D9jYNvFn0Tz2IfheGSCVWA

The tiny squares of garlic bread are a fun appetizer, served with a light marinara-type sauce. My husband tends to enjoy chicken parm here, though he enjoyed the spaghetti on our last visit.

I have a complaint, though it's partly my fault for not seeking clarification. When I ordered linguine and clams, the server offered the following three sauces: ""red, creamy, or red."" I assumed she substituted a ""red"" for ""white,"" and answered her with ""white."" What she brought back was a CREAMY linguine. Absolutely saturated with cream, guaranteeing an upset stomach because I was unprepared. I was very saddened, but didn't feel like complaining because she was otherwise nice and attentive.

But cream? I have never seen an offering of linguine and clams with cream. Usually it's a white wine/olive oil sort of sauce. Maybe that's somebody's boat, but it's not mine.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,2,3,3,ZGe4ErNIL0CxEg_9Quf4yw

Appetizers, we had fried calamari and a fried vegetable platter. My entree was 16oz NY steak and shrimp scampi and my gf had the 10oz steak and shrimp scampi. For dessert, we had cheese cake and tiramisu! Full course! what what! haha

- Easy parking. South of the strip. Near South LV outlets
- Elegant vibe. Pianist playing classics. At one point, there was a live singer. I was surprised they did all this on a Wednesday. 
-  Great service. Multiple servers. Nice recommendations. Quick refills. 
- Italian margarita gave me a light buzz. Nice amaretto flavor, sweet and sour.  
- Funny that we order American and not Italian. It's an Italian restaurant. 
- Calamari was average. Salty
- Vegetable platter was good. I enjoyed the mushroom and zuchhini 
- I ordered my steak medium and it came to me medium-well. Fail. Gf ordered Med-Well, and it came well done. 2x fail. I guess next time I'll order med-rare to get med! haha
- Otherwise, steak was seasoned nice. Not the best steak, but no real complaints
- Scampi was amazing! Flavor was strong. Loved it. Wish it came with a bit more. I'm not sure if I'd pay $12 for it myself though. 
- The potatoes were presented in slices stacked on top of each other, which I have never seen before. Delicious taste and wonderful texture. 
- Cheese cake was ordinary. Far from Cheese Cake Factory. More like buffet-style cheesecake. 
- I had a great time. Nice ambiance. Video poker if you're bored. Good recommendation for a fancy dine out.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,9,7,4,2gHJaXuT2nfHMXPD5DPx8Q

I loved all the old photos, of whom I assume are all family members. There's a piano in the main dining room but we were too early for the live music. 

Loved the garlic bread and sauce to start. I ate wayyyy too much of it and they happily brought us more. We chose the cheese ravioli and lasagna, both of which were delicious and tasted homemade and not frozen. Enjoyed the house salad, and had a delicious lava cake for dessert. 

I did mention my husband's birthday on the reservation and no one acknowledged it, but they did give us the dessert for free - it was taken off the check as ""Birthday dessert."" I feel like fewer places are doing that these days.

However, the highlight came at the beginning of the meal when we were served a tray of about 16 pieces of fluffy little biscuits that we all gorged on! Full of butter and garlic,  we requested a second tray even before our meals got there. Who can say no to more free bread...right? We got so full, we couldn't even get dessert.

The service is always good and they now take reservations which is also a plus. They just recently changed the menu and have added gluten free choices. I was pretty excited about this as I eat gluten free. I asked the waiter how they were and he said it tasted like crap and was mushy. okay- well thanks for being honest and I will order regular pasta. =)

I always start with the Antipasti Classic. I will say that they used to have to different sizes ( small and large) and now they only have one. It is really small and if you are with a group, you will need to order 2. I wish they would have kept the different sizes. It is amazing no matter what size. I also order the Calamari Fritti which is pretty good, I can't complain at all.

For my meal, I always order the angel hair pasta with the rose sauce ( which is almost like a vodka sauce). Add a little hot pepper to this and OMG- pure goodness. The BF always gets the Papperdelle Bolognese and it is so good.. It can compete with some of the top restaurants I have been to.

The only thing I was disappointed with this time was the desserts. They changed the menu and the options are not very good. Hopefully they will be changing it to something better. Maybe add a mud pie or coffee ice cream cake.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,3,2,4,JV3HAg9EGEIGDsSnEhzQjw

There was such a variance in reviews that I was skeptical because in that scenario I usually side with the one starers. 
My experience....
Bootlegger bistro def has a vintage feel, not sure if it's that ""old Vegas "" feel people talk about constantly or the decor or the older clientele and piano playing guy singing our favorite Sinatra tunes and hits of the 80s. Anyway, calamari was delish ( not too fishy and gross like Kona grill)- I just wished they had an aioli dip because I'm not that into marinara. My linguine and clams with white wine sauce was really delicious in every way. It was made perfectly. This is a dish that is either terribly gross or absolutely superb. They definitely have a superb linguine with clams! So good in fact the members of my party were all eating of my plate to sample and get seconds of delicious pasta. They aren't even seafood people so that says something. My friend had lobster mashed potatoes which may have been a limited special but were equally as amazing. The tiramisu was good but definitely not the best I've ever had and the cappuccino was a must have. I didn't try the NY steak because I don't like meat but everyone at my table said it was really tasty. Only minus- the food took somewhat long to get to us which was ok because we were watching the entertainer sing, eating bread nuggets and debating over which song we should request. I'm a creature of the night and love the dim lighting. I wonder if its this way during the day? That would be awesome. Overall, great place to take a date or anyone you want to eat with in a dim lit intimate atmosphere that's not awkwardly quiet.",tt388DQMt1hhvnmyLbwvNA,1,0,4,PSnbFyXTTDZPUznzYvU0Hw

I had the Ensalata Lorraine with Chicken which was quite good. My friend ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Caprese Salad, and Fried Eggplant appetizers and she ate every bite! She said they were very good as well. The garlic bread was a bit greasy but still good. My favorite part of the meal was the Chocolate Lava Cake which was so rich and moist I would absolutely come back just for this. I also tried my friend's Tiramisu which is made in-house and was extremely light and fluffy, the complete opposite of my dessert.

It was open mic night... What does not mean? Well not some crappy amateur crap show that is for sure. Amazing entertainers throughout town come to bless us with their amazing talents along with the house band on Monday nights. We were lucky enough to hear professional singers belting out any and everything from Sinatra, Jackson 5 and... Yes... Even a little Pink Floyd action.

So the food... Yum!!! First... I LOVE the garlic knots with sundries pesto they serve upon seating. Next, I am a ridiculous lasagna snob and this one sure fits the bill! However, I also highly recommend the stuffed mushroom appetizer. Takes a little longer but so worth it since they are made to order as opposed to sitting around all day. And believe it or not... The ribeye is amaze balls! I recently took my dad to a celebrity chef's steakhouse and practically needed a chainsaw to cut the meat.

The restaurant itself looked like something out of a movie -- an old school Italian-American restaurant set in New Orleans or Old Vegas on Halloween night. 

Quaint yet sizable with a cozy darkish ambiance, this would be a great restaurant to take a date! Or friends! Or family! Or anyone you want to have a good time with!

The little bread rolls they served were cute and delicious -- small curled up snail-like rolls drenched in olive oil and peppered with ""Italian seasoning"" (my palate isn't sensitive enough to distinguish the elements). I ordered spaghetti with the red meat sauce. My dining companion had fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portions were generous and the food was FLAVORFUL + super satisfying in a home-cooked sorta way. I was in heaven! My fellow diner was enjoying his meal too. The fettucine alfredo was delicious!

I had the eggplant parmigiana and a house salad- both were delicious! The ambiance and decor were great, but our service was not. Our server was corrina, who was a little rude from the start.

Although the overall dining experience was exciting, the food didn't convince. Everything was soaked in oil and very heavy. The portion size could be called generous and the taste was OK, but nothing more than ordinary. 

The major drawback, however, was the very limited assortment of vegetarian dishes - despite a very large menu. Even the Minestrone is cooked with a bacon broth and has sausage included. Amazingly, when I asked about the origin of the broth, the server claimed the Minestrone to be vegetarian because the bacon could be removed after the broth was cooked.
To add insult to injury, there is almost nothing a vegan could order. I totally argue that a restaurant in this day and age (in the western world) should be inclusive and also cater to vegetarians and vegans.",u7HOq6sTjBAV7uwQMG_mTQ,3,3,2,bPkerh4lK8jRPWITXQvuzg

Garlic knots were provided for us as our bread, which was delicious & definitely different from the usual plain breads you would be served at any other restaurant lol. We had a hard time deciding what to choose since the menu is vast & filled with so many delicious sounding foods! But our server was very informative & let us know the favorites including their house lasagna as well as the seafood pasta. 

Our party of 8 waited almost an hour for our food to come out so it was getting pretty late but good thing they kept giving us more garlic knots to keep our stomachs happy as we waited. I decided to go with the Salmone which comes with salmon ravioli and I wasn't super satisfied as I had hoped - it looked delicious but was really salty & the ravioli was a little tough to cut through.

The restaurant is divided into a dining area with the live music and the bar that is open 24 hours a day. Our server was friendly & very accommodating which made our dinner a satisfying one.

For dinner, I tried the ""Salmone,"" which was pan seared salmon served with salmon stuffed ravioli. What interested me most about this dish was the squid ink black ravioli shells, which were light but slightly chewy. The salmon itself was slightly sub par, being dry and lacking in the typical juicy flavor of the fish.

5659376,2013-06-02,3,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"Last night (6/1/13) I went here with my boyfriend before I leave for a month long business trip. After a long day of paper work and packing, we wanted something small and not too expensive which is why we skipped eating on The Strip. 

When I see a place is open 24/7, I'm not expecting fine dining prices EVER. Unfortunately, the prices aren't listed on Yelp and we didn't see a menu outside. If I had known that chicken fettuccine alfredo was $19, there's no way I would have stepped foot in the place. 

The lobby looked extra upscale, but the mannequin of a guy sitting at the counter scared me when I walked in. We showed up at 10:30 PM, so yeah, it was late and I was tired. 

Only the bar area was open this late. There were some obnoxious people at the bar being loud, but I guess that's what you expect in Vegas on a Saturday night, I just wasn't expecting that with how fancy the lobby was. 

The prices are insanity. I told my boyfriend that I was uncomfortable ordering anything, so we decided to split. He ordered the fettuccine alfredo and when prompted if we'd like salad, he said ""yeah."" I told the waiter to just bring us a wedge salad ($9). 

After we ordered, they brought us bread squares and a thin red dipping sauce that was good. I've never seen bread served like this so I wonder if it's made in house or if it's frozen and heated in the oven. It still tasted good. 

The wedge salad comes with ""Maria's"" blue cheese dressing. I wonder if it's the same as ""Marie's"" blue cheese dressing from the cold section of the grocery store. There must have been half a jar poured on our salad - it was swimming in dressing. There was maybe 2 teaspoons of bacon on it.. Brio makes a much better, fresher and flavorful wedge and you get a lot more actual blue cheese crumbles and bacon on it. 

Sometime between the salad and the entree, they turned out the lights completely so we ate in the light of the bar tvs. 

The fettuccine alfredo came out with a nice looking pounded chicken breast on top. Unfortunately, the sauce was flavorless. For $19, that better be some of the best fettuccine alfredo that I've ever tasted. This was not. I took a few scoops and let my boyfriend eat about 3/4 of the dish. My non-Italian mom makes killer alfredo, so why can't this joint do that? Disappointing. 

Our waiter was very good, but the food was lacking, it was extremely overpriced and we were sitting in the dark during our meal. This is not my idea of fun. 

When we got up to leave, the front door was locked and it had a sign that said exit through the bar. We ended up on the patio and then figured out where the exit was. Embarrassing!

They also give you some little garlic bread bite things with marinara for a complimentary appetizer and those were a delight.

Very cool place & we've come back many times & had great experiences on each visit.",c-2ycXb0gddd-d6UGGxgNQ,0,0,5,s4Cn6VkSIn7ycwa-KIf9tw

That's what I get for getting my hopes up, this place was a let down.  The guy that brought out the water and bread seemed as if he couldn't speak, just grunted.  The waiter was quirky and not very friendly.  I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was bland, the sauce tasted like it could've been Ragu but that's probably a knock against Ragu.  The wife ordered chicken Parmesan and it too was bland.  Prices don't match the quality of food.  Oh yeah, and the complimentary bread knots and marinara sauce were also bland...well the marinara sauce was.

I love this restaurant. The service is 5 Star all the way. They do it right.

The food is authentic and delicious. I've been a customer since the 1980's and I still love it!

Highly recommend to locals and tourists. It's worth your time and money. Prices are worth every bite you take. $21 for the Orange Roughy and $14 for spaghetti and meatballs.

It was a Friday night and the earliest reservation was 8 PM (I thought that was a good sign) so we decided to go a little early for appetizers at the bar.  The bartenders were great and we ordered the stuffed mushroom.  They were amazing and the only reason I give a 3 instead of a 2.  Stuffed w/ sausage and swimming in a delicious sauce.  The piano player was very good, entertaining and gave the place a great atmosphere.  
We were seated for dinner and that's when the mediocrity began.  Our waiter was curt and not friendly at all.  Maybe the end of his shift and we seemed like a bother.  The garlic bread did come out immediately but they were stale and the sauce bland.  I decided I would have one of the specialties and ordered Marie's Saltimbocca.  It sounded delish- salami stuffed veal with a mushroom sauce.  It was just OK and I was not impressed.  The edges were burnt and the sauce was a basic marsala, nothing special.  The fettuccini Alfredo  severed with it WAS delish.
My husband ordered the chicken parm.  He said the sauce was bland- nothing special.  This morning he has a stomach ache.

5750209,2015-07-25,1,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"The Bootlegger has a nice bar, with dining table seating as well. The main restaurant is good sized and comfortable, complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. It's just dark enough with comfy curved booths.

They serve bread almost automatically when your seated. They call them Panetti's and they are one of my favorite things!  Panetti's are little square bites and are usually very garlicky and buttery. They serve them with a special red sauce for dipping. It's definitely not just a plain marinara. 

The Fettuccine Alfredo is one of my all time favs. The alfredo sauce is SO delicious, tastes fresh and seems like it's made from scratch.  If it isn't, I better not find out where they buy it.  Because if I can buy it, I may never go out to dinner again.  My guy loves their lasagna, which doesn't come the way most of us would expect. They make HUGE pans of this layered goodness and serve big slices of it on it's side covered with red sauce.  But on this night, my guy had the house salad and the Pork Chop Marsala, a 12 oz. bone-in pork chop in Marsala mushroom sauce, served with rustic roasted potatoes and broccoli.  He was in heaven!  The pork was cooked the way he ordered it, and was moist and tender. I know, because I HAD to try some, of course!  

Our waiter, was on top of things and very friendly to us. Eddie, our busser was a great guy! I had asked him some random questions and he was so helpful and nice to talk with. Throughout the evening I saw him interacting with numerous costumers and he always had a smile on his face. He's clearly a hard worker and takes pride in what he does.

Had the calamari as an appetizer , along with the little breads with the dipping sauce.
Both fantastic. Don't eat anything  the WHOLE day before you come here, so you can carb out.

With a side of Italian zucchini.

Our waiter was delightful. Usually most waiters annoy me, sometimes they try to hard, this guy was just naturally cool.

First visit to this place was Sept 28 2:24 AM. A friend and I were out enjoying a girls night out and were STARVING and wanted pizza. I remembered hearing about this place and decided to call to be sure they still were serving food-specifically pizza and THEY WERE!!!! Upon arrival there were only a handful of people in the bar. We sat down and were promptly greeted by the friendly bartender who then took our order. Our pizza was everything we wanted and more. DEEEELICIOUS!!! Starsky and Shane took very good care of us and were very attentive. 

Since my first experience was so great I decided to bring in another friend the very next week. My second visit was Oct 3 9:28pm. A little busier this time and there was a male and female bartender. We sat there a few minutes and the female bartender passed by a handful of times but did not acknowledge us. Then, the male bartender came over from the other side of the bar to greet us and gave us menus and apologized for the wait. He then offered us tasting of wine (Ravenswood Zin) that we LOVED and ended up ordering multiple glasses of throughout our visit. We split an order of Lasagna as we were not terribly hungry, and it was PERFECT. Michael was a phenomenal host who went out of his way to give us a great experience.

A few high top tables off to the side, as well as some booths and tables for dining. Plenty of TV's for viewing sporting events like the Golden Knights game! 

After the group showed up it was only a matter of minutes for a table in the bar area to open up. We sat down just as the game started, and it was 1-0 when the garlic knot bread arrived. Waiter took our order after it was 3-0. My friends ordered the pizza, and I ordered the salmone. 

It was 4-0 when the food arrived. Pizza takes about 30 minutes to cook.
My salmone was absolutely delicious, a grilled chunk of salmon in a creamy buttery lemony sauce, with veggies and salmon ravioli. Oh so good!!!

They start your meal off with a basket of garlic knots and marinara sauce that are delicious.
The price range for the meals run from about $15 for average pasta dishes up to about  $32 for Italian specialities.  Be prepared though with the pasta dishes you pay extra for a salad.  Their manicotti was excellent and you get 2 pretty good sized ones for the price.
Dessert runs around  $8 for tirimisu, but the portion is comparable to other places if not a little bigger.

Even when i know I cannot give my best, I make the effort to make sure I own the guest and accomidate them as much as possible.  My performance directly effects my lively-hood!  I may not be a consistent guest of the Bootlegger Restaurant but I have been eating there and brought several guests with me since they were at their old location on Tropicana and Eastern Ave.  From now on . . . I will not refer anyone to the bar whether it is shift change or not.  I came in on a Sunday afternoon at 4pm.  I asked about happy hour and food service at the bar.  The host having no knowledge of the happy hour menu directed me to the bar (totally ok with because I too am a bartender).  I asked the lovely brunette bartender if I could sit at one of the hightop tables - yes was the answer.  I asked about happy hour and dinner food service at the bar - she specified nothing other than she would get me a food menu.  I asked for a wine menu which she got. I waited 10min. to order and I had to step to the bar to order.  I just went downhill from there.  Her replacement Diane came in who was very nice but neither of them were attentive either in taking my order, following up to see if I needed anything, which I had to approach the bar to do (the only thing I asked for was extra vinegar for my caprese salad) and the bar was empty aside for some return guest from the brunettes home town.  Did I mention that when I asked her if I could get another glass of wine for my dinner, her reply was that legally she couldn't serve me because of being off the clock.  This I understand but it didn't stop her when she sat with her friends from her hometown and served them after I had placed my order.  I still had to ask Diane for another glass of wine.  My entree was dropped not even halfway through my salad so by the time I finished my salad, my food was totally cold.  Did I fail to mention that neither the food runner, busser, bartender asked me if I needed anything or even if the food was ok?  I had to ask to have my plates cleared.

The fetuccini Alfredo is pretty good, though it is actually better at the Cheesecake Factory. The CHICKEN they used on it was absolutely great at Bootlegger, however. Very juicy and flavorful.

In the meantime she was schmoozing the large table for obvious tip reasons.  There were only 3 of us since our daughter met us for dinner and the waitress had dollar signs in her eyes rather than service signs.  Both husband and I have waited tables before and are excellent tippers, but knew what was going on so she got a whopping 5 dollar tip from us.  An hour and 20 minutes later we were finally able to leave after getting the manager so we could get our bill and by now the restaurant was full and he had the audacity to say he was going to look to see when our ticket went up (like I was lying when I said we waited 45 minutes for our food and an hour for my salmon).  Anyway, my husband rates this place a 0, but knows I like it okay so took me there.. Now we're on the same page.  

Glad I'm a local so I can spread the word.  Was fun sipping on one beer and ice cubes since filling up my water glass was too much for our waitress.. It's always more frustrating when you watch the other diners she's laughing with and running around for knowing they're having a good experience for the evening.  Bummer for the 20th.

We had a server named Aaron, hate to call him out by name but watching how his co-workers mingled with their tables to ensure they had drinks filled/ their appetizers/main courses came out correctly I have to say we didn't get that same level of professionalism.

We were sat by the hostess who said your waiter will be right over. 10 mins later we flagged down a kid carrying a pitcher of water and asked who or waiter was? ""I don't know but I will have someone come over right away"" 5 minutes later Aaron came over asked if he could take our orders? 

Didn't apologize for ignoring us for 15 minutes or even try to explain he was double or triple sat, he just carried on like it was normal protocol to have a table sat and ignore them. 

We wanted to start with a drink, an appetizer. We should have guessed what was going to happen when the GF asked if one drink had Tequila or not. Another 15 minute wait for him to find out and bring my beverage and another 10 minutes for hers

After drinks were ordered we ordered an appetizer and was told ""I'm not sure if we have any of that left, let me go check and I will be right back"" this time he was only gone 10 minutes and said ""we can make that for you, do you still want it""? Well yes that's the whole reason we sat here and waited for you to come back! 

If you are counting that's 40-50 minutes and we have only been given two glasses of water and a soda.

We had empty drinks on our table about 40% of the time we were there. Waiters, Busboys and others walked by our table and ignored our requests for assistance to get refills or our bill. (Actually a younger kid seeing our distress did get us refills and our to go boxes) I know the other waiters had their tables but a simple ""I'm sorry I will send Aaron over right away"" would have been nice

We had some good food but sadly not great. I had the Seafood Diavolo, the seafood was fresh but the sauce was a weak bland sauce when I had ordered it medium I was expecting it to have a little bite. If I can convince myself to patronize them again I will try it hot.

The Antipasta Classici, was what he was worried about not having any more and was quite exceptional. Best part of our meal was a plate of sliced meat and cheeses? 

Our server only came back once to our table and that was to give us our bill. There were empty tables everywhere and we should have been given more attention, just like the tables around us. 

The best part of our meal was the guy playing the piano and his sexy singer belting out classic lounge act songs. The singer bantered with a few tables making them part of the show. The two of them were  a nod to classic Vegas and actually did elevate our experience from a horrible one to a mediocre one.

It's delightfully pleasant, and the music with the singers makes me feel good .  They play anywhere from Sinatra to Mario Lanza and just classic melodies paired with decent Italian dishes.  5 stars all the way- tip them if you enjoy it music.

I've been here a few times, sometimes to host, sometimes just to have a meal to satisfy the big appetite.  Think American portions with a flare of Italian to it.  Here's an example, the little bread knots that come out is drenched in butter, a bit of garlic, but still eat them.

The pappardelle bolognese, thick egg noodles, filled with ground beef, thick red sauce and a very filling dish.  If you're feeling up to you, add a side of meatballs, it's overload, but I've devoured that meal on a hungry night.  This is my favorite dish.  4 stars.

Other times, I have ordered the lasagna, a little different than you traditional layers of pasta.  Individual sized dish, with the lasagna baked into every dish, a massive amounts of cheese and meat.  Can be a bit salty, with a overload of carbs, fats and protein.  3 stars.

I don't recommend their white pinot noir house wine, because didn't go well with my food.  I couldn't finish the glass.  To each's own.  1 star.

Come with great company, enjoy massive amounts of food, not the most authentic Italian taste, but still decent.  If you want to sit in the main room, make sure you make reservations, because it can get pretty packed.  Read their history on their menu, it's a pretty interesting one.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,6,5,3,S7wm7inddeeAh-hjOjQX-g

In Vegas I usually stay downtown, I eat at old school steakhouses, and I love the original Oceans 11.  So when my brother that used to live in Vegas recommended this place and told me that it has been around since the Rat Pack days I knew we had to go there.  When we came in were were seated immediately by the friendly staff and our waiter was Johnny on the spot with our drink order.  
We sat in the bar area and in the main dining room was a live singer and a piano player doing old school standards.  The ambiance was perfect.  
My pre-dinner extra dry vodka martini was perfectly prepared and my fiance's ""Italian"" margarita (a house specialty) was delicious.  The bread bites with marinara sauce were a great into to our meal.  
My veal Parmesan was exceptional and the lasagna my fiance had was probably some of the best I have tasted.  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert even though it's not really a Italian dish but it is my favorite and it was fantastic.  Sadly I don't remember the bottle of wine we had but it was the perfect match to our meals.  
The only negative I can think of is now that we have discovered this place I will have a hard choice between here and my other favorite Italian place in town.",EYR6AI-BH__55ADdlkd9Uw,0,0,5,xj39WuRVx6uJ2HPErA7r1w

5893866,2017-01-03,0,k8BqCejnaMlw7aoVthvqyw,"First, go online and read the family history of the four generations that have participated in the smooth and delicious functioning of this historic, should-be Landmark, restaurant and bar.  Almost as famous for it's major Vegas star clientele, circa 1950's, as it is for its quality true Southern Italian cooking, you'll get a whopping portion of each, the former in framed pics on the walls, the latter on your plate.     I've always found it interesting that Big Stars rarely go to those overly decked-out eateries that the rest of us go to when we want to feel like glamorous stars.  I guess they get enough of all that fussing and fakery on stage.  When it's time to fuel up, they gravitate to these relaxed, homey, clean-but-not-dolled-up ma 'n pa joints and saloons, and for some reason, usually Italian. The one caveat is that it must have character that has organically evolved over years of many and diverse cheeks having lovingly brushed those well-worn leather seats.       Last night we lost our res. at Hugo's in the Four Queens, which I've also given a 5-star rating, because I couldn't pull myself, nor could my husband drag me, away from the damn Wheel of Fortune slot.  So we had no choice but to limp, financially beaten, and emotionally bruised, into the Bootlegger at 2 a.m.   It's times like that when only deep fried food will do, and lots of it.  Everything is ""flash"" fried so it's crisp and clean tasting.  What I especially like is that there are different coatings for the fried foods so they don't all taste the same, UGH.  The eggplant is flash-fried in a breadcrumb and parm coating, while the calamari is dipped in an egg batter.  Reasonably priced and a good go-to off-the-strip hideaway for those special times when the rest of your day at the gaming tables really sucked.",6c1t4iWwA-gcKFyyicPulA,0,0,5,Gytaw_173x9Nhg_Ns9XU1Q

We walk in and the men up front we're talking amongst themselves, not once looking at us or acknowledging us. We stood there staring at each other and looking for signs to see if we came in the right way. We even said ""is this the entrance?"" to each other. We decided to walk past the hosts and finally one of them decided to ask if they could help us. 

We get our table and we're served these pieces of toast and marinara sauce which was meh. Our waiter was busy socializing with the other waiters so it took a while to order. 

We finally order our food which we're pretty excited for because we seen the pics on Yelp and it looked delicious. I order the chicken parm which was $24 so I'm expecting a decent meal for that price. What showed up was a dried chicken patty covered in cheese and a scoop of spaghetti with the same sauce they serve with the toast. When I say the chicken was dry, I mean it was dryyyyyy.

The bar has some great staff,  drinks are standard, service is a little slow on certain peoples shifts but personalities make up for it.

Food is excellent, the minestrone is great, my husband and I have been in there many times, with and without each other. The appetizer list is excellent cant go wrong with any of them. Veal Saltimboca is excellent, melt in your mouth. Garlic bread type will only be brought to table after you place your food order, I guess the owner wants the servers to bump up the checks with appetizers. Hit or miss on servers, Danny, Charlene, Elly and Melissa are great. We have had 2 bad experiences with Kevin, he gives off the impression that we are doing him a favor by having him be our waiter, they need to replace him.

The inside of the restaurant has pictures of Sinatra and the Rat Pack all over.  There's also a piano and someone singing live most evenings.  The servers are properly trained and know what they're talking about.  Wine menu includes everything you might need and the mixed cocktails are strong.

But the food is what blew me away!  I can make a meal out of their breadsticks alone.  They're lightly brushed with oil and garlic and served with marinara.  I decided to get spaghetti with meatballs and it was just perfect.  They used a bolognese sauce instead of marinara and it complimented the pasta really well.  The best part is soaking up the sauce with the bread at the end.  Also decided to order the tiramisu as it was recommended and it was a great end to a perfect meal.

Our group of 6 walked in and said hello to the two people at the desk (The tall skinny kid and a blond lady). They literally looked at me, didn't say a word and began talking to each other. No hello, no Ill be right with you, just completely ignored. 

We were finally seated after they were done with their conversation. There was a large party of 20-25 people right in the middle of the restaurant. This group was very loud and disturbing the entertainment of the singer and piano player. They should have been sat in the back room so not to disturb the other diners. 

Out of our group of 6 only 1 liked their dinner. We had a large pizza, veal parm, NY steak (2) and osso bucco. The pizza was terrible, the osso bucco was like none I had seen before. Very small over cooked pieces of meat instead of a large veal shank. Neither person cared for their steak either. The lava cake for dessert was super rich and not enjoyable. 

Not sure what happened to this place. Just a bad night? I hope so but for the prices they charge the food and hospitality did not come close. Will be taking a break from here for a while.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,12,3,2,TbsqL3U2Uspvw2lBlv7edA

I learned of place by staying next door at a Hilton Garden Inn for a conference. I went down to the Wynn on a Saturday night for dinner.

Upon arrival, the three of us were seated right away. We ordered some bottled water (suggested in vegas), and started off with some bruschetta, which by the way was really good. It was toasty perfect starter. The BREAD that they serve here is so good! I think I ate most of it before my meal came out.

Yelp was temporarily down or I wouldn't have even bothered with this place. The atmosphere was nice upon arrival. We seated ourselves at a booth. The server was pretty nice but his service was so slow. We both ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The bread with marinara sauce which was served right before the pasta was horrid and literally dripping grease. The food came quick but the service after that was really lousy. We waited almost 20 min. for the server/bartender to come back around to ask him for refills on ice tea. The fettuccini was so bland bland bland. I had to force myself to eat it. I left more than half the food on my plate as did my companion, who is not a picky eater. The guys in front of us, at the bar started smoking up a storm. Between that and food, which was not settling well, I wanted to just get the check but couldn't spot an employee which is strange for a bar. I could've up and left and noone would have noticed. Total bill for two fettuccini, two iced teas, (which were $4 a piece) was almost $40. subtotal. The price of the food was not even worth it. I wish I would have bought 2 frozen dinners, Marie Callender's fettuccini alfredo, on the way home and called it a night. It would've been cheaper, quicker, and tasted better, and that's sad. This was the worst Italian meal I've ever had in a restaurant. I've always wanted to try this place. I'm so disappointed. So, $48. later, I feel queasy and compelled to warn anyone with taste buds to stay away. If this was the last place on Earth that served food, I'd starve. No joke. If you really dislike someone recommend this place to them. No that's cruel. Try Carmine's Little Italy. The food is just as expensive, but at least worth it. Ugh!
