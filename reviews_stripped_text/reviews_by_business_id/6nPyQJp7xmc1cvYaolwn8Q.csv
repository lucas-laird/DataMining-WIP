1539711,2015-01-18,0,6nPyQJp7xmc1cvYaolwn8Q,We have been waiting for 20 minutes in line cause there is only one worker here today and it's lunchtime.  Not sure why thy would only have 1 worker.  This facility also said it is open 24 hours a day which is hard to understand.  Maybe they spread out the workers but this is kind of a high traffic location.

I'm only giving this location 3 stars, however, because I went a few weeks ago around the same time after a long work shift and really just wanted an Italian BMT. I stood at the door ringing the bell and knocking loudly for over 5 minutes alongside another couple trying to get in with no answer. The couple left for the near-by gas station and returned and told me the employee was actually on her break at said gas station. I don't blame her for being on a break, and I understand break laws (10 minutes for every 4 hours, 30 minutes unpaid meal break for every 8 hours...that kind of thing), but there should have at least been a sign saying she was on break. ORR this location should consider having two employees on shift at all times. Not only for break purposes which would allow them to actually be ""Open 24 Hours"" as they advertise, but also for the safety of their employees. Only one person working that late at night? I feel like you're just asking for outside trouble. By the time the couple told me about the employee's break, I was annoyed for having waited that long without knowing what was going on, and I ended up leaving before she returned.",70-BvOpNGandnO1wBRbBJg,2,1,3,SA-oYM0Xnak1YnLniABRbg

When Hector ran  this place it was nice, it had fresh meats and vegetables. Now everything is stale,  the tuna looks two days old every time I go in there and meets look at least 1 to 2 days old and the vegetables are garbage. Do something to improve your quality or you will close. People who come in they are probably just desperate to get something to eat before they run off to work or whatever. I know I was today otherwise it would not have gotten the food I took one look at the vegetables and they were gross. I took one look at the tuna and it had brown stuff all around the top, this is not the first time this has happened. I used to love subway tuna.

Well here it is....this subway location use to be 24 hours but ever since they got robbed last year they decided to change their hours. Understandable.... employee safety and business could lose money.

Wish the sandwiches were prepared a little nice and neat. Happy eats!!!",Jtoi5k9Pw_L4MOP4SfJTNg,0,0,2,6QVKulGrzVu96bAisDSYSg

I asked for toasted lightly just to melt the cheese. My bread was over toasted, top and bottom bread was like croutons in some places. Then i asked for light mustard she ends up putting heavy mayo instead. I should have asked for a new sandwhich but i hate to see this waste into the trash. So i dine in and notice i wasnt given any napkins with my order, no biggie I'll just ask for some.  then i realize everyone else asking for napkins.

In a world where customer service is valued this has been the worst experience thus far! The owner advised me, I didn't spend enough money to earn their customer service.

I then said, ""so you're telling me you won't make my sandwich because you don't want to re-clean the microwave?"" He said yes. And this is not the first time he has said this to me. He said it a few weeks ago and I just let it go but to blatantly not make someone's food (which is his job) because he doesn't want to clean it after is an outrage!! Not very good customer service in my opinion!!",OGywInURaLcFUXQCUhGT-Q,4,0,1,hBCuU-xFx5l9J2tHytEF4A
4403185,2018-05-20,0,6nPyQJp7xmc1cvYaolwn8Q,"I love subway but this location is horrible, I went there about 2 weeks ago and asked for a foot long veggie delight on white and the young man making my sandwich literally just started throwing ingredients on there (lettuce, tomato, olives) without me even asking for a thing or asking me if I wanted it? Luckily I like all that so I then from that moment proceeded to just tell him what else to put on to prevent him from just making me suicide sand which. The worst part was, I had to ask him to put cheese on it when the MAIN INGREDIENT in the veggie delight is cheese?? I'm so confused as to how this kid works here or if he is just really new and confused. Anyways the sand which was crap, and I would recommend avoiding this location.",0RZANkFmVqO4HI3EQ3RVxA,1,0,1,WyGz5NLkWxKA1AESrZvIGA

I'm disgusted ugh!....Subway ran a promo a few days ago...I decided to give it another try....worst mistake ever....buy a sandwich deal and get another one free! Lie! Lie ! Lie! I asked the idiot girl working there, tell me if you still have the deal for the sandwich and for what size! She said any size and we will match the free one for the same size! When I got to the register the rude man told me my bill was almost $16 bucks! Are u kidding me for one sandwich ? SUBWAY Rips people off by scamming them now ?? ....I was told that the measurements are calculated into the footlong by 4 x sandwiches! What bs is that! I Told the guy that all the other subways are offering footlong deals and footlong free sandwich...he said this subway doesn't ! Really, did he just make a decision for the whole corporation last minute? Three incompetent employees who couldn't handle 10 clients, lied and ran out of bread or just made footlong bread and said they didn't have 6' so they could rip people off ! I'm sure I was not the only disgusted client not only with your nasty tasting sandwich but with the whole subway ! Can't wait to see your doors shut!! Thanks for the promo to remind us never to give you our money, your business is a scam ! Will spread the words to my clients as well...",-CkFNOsa_IfiRwQdUzL5GA,1,0,1,M34_ueZM8yXrHrTREE0YEA
