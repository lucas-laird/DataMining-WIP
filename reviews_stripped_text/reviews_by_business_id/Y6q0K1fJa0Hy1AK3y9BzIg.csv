Not only that, but they chose to mix 2 of our favorite things into one spot. Sushi burritos and Hawaiian BBQ? This place has set the bar.

The customer service was friendly and the inside was clean. We both liked the fact that this establishment chose to go with a closed refrigerator counter top versus the normal open top with a glass barrier sneeze guard. We wanted to ensure we got the full experience, so we ordered from both sides of the menu.

From the Hawaiian BBQ menu we ordered the bbq combination plate with the chicken katsu and the teri beef. This comes with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of mac salad. ""The mac ain't whack!"" My boyfriend I both agree they make a good mac salad unlike some places. (Teri Madness) Sadly, teriyaki sauce nor katsu sauce was provided, but neither of us are really upset about it. Neither meat really needed sauce. The meat was cooked impeccably. Kudos to the chef. I've never had chicken katsu cooked so beautifully. I was impressed. I would go back solely just for this. We used the Yelp offer to receive the free pot stickers and were not disappointed. Free means fried, but it was delicious regardless. The pot sticker sauce has a apple cider vinegar base making it a little sweet, but tatsy. My boyfriend especially enjoyed this part. He tried dipping the chicken katsu in it which gave it a kind of tempura taste and later covered his rice in it. We also got 2 spam musubis. The picture online is deceiving because it makes it appear like they're not using the normal amount of seaweed. Don't worry, they do. The spam slice is pretty thick and the rice ratio is normal. Thumbs up on this too.

From the other side of the menu, I got the ahi poke bowl and my boyfriend did a build your own burrito with seaweed, white sushi rice, shrimp tempura, yellowtail, imitation crab, yum yum sauce, unagi sauce, light spicy mayo, salsa, green onions, cilantro, and avocado. My poke bowl was super yummy. My only complaint was the crispy chips because it made it difficult to enjoy all parts of my bowl. I will probably avoid this part in the future. My boyfriend enjoyed his burrito, however, the darker colored yellowtail was a bit chewy. So not a favorite if you're a texture eater.

Overall, our tummies are happy and will definitely be coming back espeically being 5 min away. We're giving them 5 stars because they deserve it. Being open for only 3 weeks, I hope they stick to the standard and quality of cooking that they do now and for years to come.",1B-y0vJqZCDbyNjVgK6lFQ,1,0,5,Fp6dhwZ165RXg-LaVD7tEQ

+ Menu has both sushi burritos and poke bowls as well as Hawaiian plate lunch meals and bbq. Feeding a family just got easier.
+ Location is convenient, both to my work and for you to pop by next door for dessert at Bover!
+ Free potstickers with Yelp check in and purchase of entree.
+ Service was really friendly and food has been pretty fresh, customization options available.
+ Recommend the Silly Lilly sushi burrito, add avocado.

CONS:
- Prices are a touch higher than they should be, others mention portions seem a little smaller than expected. Order above was $14 with tax/tip. 
-  They go a little heavier on the sauces than I prefer, burrito was a little soggy even after stopping them from adding more sauce.
- Primarily a takeout space with only three small tables, so plan ahead.
- Parking lot gets extremely busy during lunch/dinner, consider the lot to the right of the entrance.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,16,3,cbSs1V2QUYuJ88a2rRzyOQ

It was the first time I remember going to a Hawaiian restaurant that also served sushi burritos. What can I say? I really enjoy their food. I go there at least once a month. I've had their bbq chicken, beef, short ribs, and a few sushi burritos. The Kaotic burrito in particular is fantastic. It's got an extra kick and the sauce is damn tasty. Their service is great too. Family owned. Hard workers. I really hope they continue to build upon what they've created. 

Quick rant. What is up with people on Yelp who say a lot of great things about a restaurant with no complaints, yet gave the business a 3 star rating??? The hell??? I really don't understand how some of you determine what rating to give. Anyways, give Suha a try. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",d9D4w_TOZqB7OvM7T3DFJw,0,0,5,HMT1tbPcgBuEUZMgzzzFXw

Parking is easily found out front and this is a casual eatery similar to typical Hawaiian BBQ / Poke places etc. 

The service was kind of weird from the cashier who kept calling us to the side of her front register to order, but what the heck I'm still deciding based on the menu which I need to read (their Sushi Burritos and Poke Bowl Menu is on the further right side) because their front menu is just the Hawaiian BBQ menu. I felt rushed from her, which was interesting, weak service as I am still perusing the side menu I had to tell her. 

Also they have no condiments or napkins up front for grabs so you have to ask the workers for those items which is behind them. 

I enjoyed my *Kaotic Sushi Burrito*:
-Protein: shrimp tempura, salmon. Sauce: spicy mayo, unagi sauce. 
-Toppings: avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, onions, mixed greens. Deep fried in tempura batter. 
It all went perfectly together and had amazing taste. The flavors and texture of the veggies in it was very fresh and 4 stars for the food. 

I also tried their *BBQ Beef and Chicken combo plate* which was filling and delicious as well.

Very small, but very clean and lovely staff. They were patient as we looked over the menu and ordered.
By the way, they have two menus. One is geared toward more traditional fare seen at most Hawaiian places, such as the BBQ Chicken and beef, chicken katsu, etc. 
The other menu was a sushi burrito menu. Everything from sushi bowls, sushi burritos, and of course, the build your own menu. 
We got a build your own burrito, a spam musubi, and the pork buns. My burrito had surumi crab, shrimp tempura, rice, unagi sauce, cucumbers, and mixed greens.
All I can say is YUMMMMMM. While the burrito was a bit messy and didn't hold very well, it was super yummy. Everything was fresh and well prepared. The pork buns were nice and moist inside, and I couldn't even get a bite of the musubi, so I had to listen to my partner rave over how great it was.

I actually could've had leftovers, but like a ravenous, under-fed hippopotamus, I inhaled it all in an embarrassingly short period of time.

Aside from the food, everyone was so friendly in the store. They asked if I had been there before and welcomed me immediately.

It's brown rice, salmon, seaweed salad and poke sauce.  This trash cost $8.50.  Their version of poke sauce is more consistent of a teriyaki sauce.

Not coming back, and if I wanted Hawaiian BBQ I'll probably drive down the street to Makai Pacific Grill on Rock Springs.

I do not suggest getting bowls here.  They have 4 options of bowls and if you decide to do custom, you're probably picking from only 4 fish proteins then the rest on the BBQ side of things.

4770535,2018-02-27,0,Y6q0K1fJa0Hy1AK3y9BzIg,"Had been waiting for this place to open for some time now. The service was great but took a while to get my food. Which usually I wouldn't mind but I was on a lunch break. I ordered the Thai beef salad and the pork buns. The pork buns were almost $7 but they are the mass produced buns I could have bought at any store. Cold in the middle and all around not that yummy. I have been on the hunt for fresh made pork buns so I guess I am still looking. The salad was good but for $9.50 I would have hoped for something a little fresher looking. I am willing to try again but I do believe for what you get it was a little overpriced.

Update: the owner was so awesome and ran me over some warm, fresh pork buns to work. Customer service is definitely worth giving another try. Next time I go I will order the poke bowl",BmXxLavFvXJEomraMTsc_g,0,1,4,mkYfViHXf2dpaJFDbQ1plw

I stopped by this place because I was in the area and I'm so glad I did! Chicken Katsu is a favorite of mine and it's really good here! The sauce has a great flavor and the breading is perfect! And the macaroni salad has a really good flavor too! I got a bite of the Kaotic roll and the sauce makes it so delicious! I really love anything tempura and the flavor combinations were perfect! I left in a food comma and can't  wait to go back to try more. Also they have Dr. Pepper! I love D.r Pepper!!!!!",CrVC6jLzOp4b-zbMsfveyA,1,0,5,OhHl34jL0LKDdFxI4J7I4Q

5367390,2018-04-06,1,Y6q0K1fJa0Hy1AK3y9BzIg,"Update on my recent visit. We ordered a large garlic shrimp and it was even better this time. We asked for a side of their sweet mayo and dipped the shrimp in that...amazing! We also ordered the Pearly poke bowl with seaweed salad added to it. Portions are perfect - big scoops of crab, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, and just the right amount of rice. Everything was fresh and tasted great. 

The staff remembered us from our last visit and greeted us as soon as we walked in. I'd forgotten to claim the potstickers on check in and he actually brought out the free potstickers to us while we were eating. Now THAT is customer service! 

I'm still really impressed by this place. The food alone makes it worth coming back. But the amazing customer service is what really makes it a stand out establishment.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,1,1,5,XN6i2op1KSoC9tgn8kCoyA

Totally took advantage of their Yelp check-in offer and devoured their pot stickers. Lightly fried. Served with a sweet sauce that's a blend of vinegars, chili flakes, and sugar. It almost has a plum taste to it. 

Suha Bite burrito with spam, crab, fried green onion, pineapple, and greens. Sweet, salty, and crunchy. I curbed my spam musubi craving by having something similar but burrito style. It was really tasty, well prepared, and the staff was really nice. 

It's right next to another new favorite of mine, Bover, so I like that I can kill to cravings with one parking spot. I hope my next visit is as good as this one was!",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,20,20,4,BI6L-dhD30x7lBH5ATf7wg

I was very hesitant, we even sat in the parking lot debating whether or not to eat here or the pho place in the same parking lot but because the reviews were better at Suha bites we decided to give it a try and it DID NOT disappoint us at all!!! The food was amazing the service was amazing and so worth it! We got the pearly bowl(amazing!!!! I highly recommend this!) with added seaweed salad on it, a kaotic burrito and a combo with chicken and beef. I never like the beef at other places it's usually very chewy and tough but here it is so good! Even though they had a large party before us they were able to make room for us to din in shortly before our food arrived. 

After such an amazing experience the first time we decided shortly before closing a few days later to treat our oldest son (who wasn't with us the first time we went). I went in to place the order and the owner was very kind no one seemed upset or pushy to get me out witch was very refreshing! I placed my order and was out in a few short mins. The owner had remembered me and asked how the kids were. There customer service is outstanding and the food is delicious will definitely be back!",g3O9riUD-7_-gJd-KUMLpg,3,0,5,prCu1afNgeUJd-gI4hEzrQ

The spring rolls were also very good. Super crispy outside, even the leftovers the next day. The filling was tasty but slightly mushy.
The Hawaiian side of the menu was not as impressive. Standard bbq combo plate. Chicken was fine, ribs a bit chewy. Macaroni salad was just okay. Spam Musubi was good, worth getting again.
I will most likely get the Veggie Wong again and will definitely recommend it to my vegetarian friends.",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,4,0,4,yL9Pox2fCIFp5eW3W4zFng
