1426462,2018-06-17,0,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"Probably one of the worst places I've ever went to for revolving sushi. It's not the first place that opened up for revolving sushi either. Food quality wasn't good, the fish was warm, and it tasted old. Every time we picked something off the conveyor belt, there was condensation on the lid, and that only happens when it's hot, which was gross considering that we were eating raw fish. The appetizers that were served were undercooked, especially the chicken wings. Service wasn't the best, it was hard to flag down someone when we needed something. Came during the grand opening special, where they took 5 dollars off it's lunch/dinner prices, but was never told that they would charge 18% gratuity on the bill. The menu said it would only charge gratuity if there were 6+ people, and it was only me and another person. We had to ask why we were being charged when we got the bill, and told us it was part of the promotion. Which is odd, because I had 2 friends who went to Konbea belt the next day, where they didn't get charged gratuity, but the promotion was going on until Sunday. Would highly recommend going somewhere else like Sapporo Revolving Sushi, even though it's not AYCE there. Definitely not coming back.",i9XV_JCZ_grgUPgtvJ1K8w,0,0,1,L5vpHz1RSLf5NIwtfoQvlg
1483720,2018-05-24,0,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"Came here for lunch at about 12pm and was immediately seated with no wait time.  The waiter explained the ins and outs to us and left us to get started on lunch.

Selection of sushi on the belt could have been a lot better.  Noticed the belt looked a bit empty most times, although we did get what wanted after a while.  

Very small menu of appetizers, which comes out to you on a train like car above the conveyor mechanism.  Kalbi, pork belly and salt/pepper shrimp were good.  

I guess they do enforce the 45-min time limit somewhat, because just about that time, the waitress came around and gave us a desert menu.  Was that the que for us to hurry up and leave?

As we were leaving, we saw the people next to us get some ikura nigiri sushi via the train.  Was it on a secret menu?  It surely wasn't on the belt!  Too early to be on the dinner menu.

All in all, it was just the experience of eating at a rotating sushi place that my family and I wanted to experience after not having Genki Sushi in Hawaii after 5-years.
 
Will I be back?  Hardly.  Too little selection of appetizers and nigiri.  We also felt very rushed knowing about the 45-min time limit.  Not a pleasant feeling.

Usually, when I eat ayce sushi for lunch, I don't eat dinner because I am satisfied.  1- hr later I was looking for something to eat.

Just some food for thought...",ZvNDnyc0uTSeelyWXSN-OA,0,0,2,q-yPTTKB2nR0emDz-1G6Nw

The sushi was good, probably around 7-10 rolls in rotation, plus Nigiri options. Pork belly was a good alternate option to sushi and rice. The steak was supposed to be garlic, but I found it kind of bland. 

Desserts were all pre-packaged Asian options. Pretty fun actually. The chocolate crunch was a strawberry shortcake type bar with chocolate chips on the outside. 

The only thing I will say is that it's a little hard figuring out which roll is which, so you don't know what you liked unless is very visually distinct. Waiter mentioned that the picture signs should represent the plates they are next to, but they were crazy busy. 

They have a fun little robot train that brings out special orders to your table too. Very instagramable. 

Will try again down the road. Posting lots of fun videos from experience.

I am so happy they made another conveyor belt in Las vegas, because the one down the street called Sapporo does not do AYCE and trust me, that bill will stack if your a big eater like i am.  The service is definitly a 5/5. The servers are very attentive and seems to have a lot of chefs in the bar area.  Im guesssing because they just opened and didnt want to get backed up if they get really busy.  Our server explained everything very thoroughly and on top of that he was from Hawaii!!!!! ( So am I) =]
He recommended the Kalbi and the pork belly which was hot and ready to go because it came straight from the kitchen and not the belt.

There was too much rice for my taste. However, that did not stop my friends and I from eating 100 plates. They really mean all you can eat. Furthermore, they have entrees that were pretty good. I had the garlic shrimp and the korean ribs, which I loved! 

They had a promotion at the time we ate, so the meal was pretty affordable at $16. It also included dessert! I had the Korean ice cream sandwich, and it basically tasted like an ice cream cone!",T0HgSIxF3mpfhhN1q2WV7Q,2,3,4,IG5ZmdrP-56DBRiccsFsmw

2019097,2018-06-17,0,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"This place was just ok. We decided to try it after I saw an advertisement on fb for a new revolving type of sushi place and the grand opening specials were awesome for AYCE. I do really like the idea of having both revolving sushi and AYCE unlike Sapporo . However, the sushi was kind of boring. We went for lunch so maybe that's why? But I did have one roll that I can't stop thinking about. I can't remember the name but it has lemon and salmon on top. It was SOO good. As far as service goes, the staff was friendly, but we were only asked once if we wanted anything off the menu. Water was filled a few times which was great. We also had ordered a green tea ice cream but never got it. I misunderstood the waiter when he asked about it and thought he asked if we ordered it . I said yes. But he really actually asked me if we got it because he brought the check right after that. But no big deal I didn't need the ice cream. Just weird how he forgot that quickly to bring it after we ordered it. I've never been to a place that added gratuity automatically into the bill for just 2 people..so I didn't feel that we needed to leave a cash tip too. Also the atmosphere was very boring, and the place is small. Would I be back? If the price stayed at grand opening prices yes.

So you can order some of their hot foods with a staff member or grab your sushi off the conveyor belt. The hot foods came on a little train. My 15 month old was entertained every time it came by.

2119891,2018-06-14,1,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"My husband found them on Facebook. We've been to this style sushi place before just not here in Vegas. First off, my daughter who was with us is a vegetarian and they wouldn't allow her to be ala cart and us AYCE. Which I understand his reasoning but come on, she's a 10 yr old vegetarian. I would totally be on board if she were an adult but a child! She ate 3 things. She didn't even eat enough to justify the price of AYCE. Sushi quality was ok, not the best we've had but definitely nothing near the worst. The place was very clean and staff was friendly. Efficiency of their staff was ok. We did have to ask for a couple of items twice and they weren't that busy but you everyone has off days here and there. 

Where they TOTALLY lost me was not the food or the issue with my daughter but solely because of the bill. The menu says 18% gratuity automatically added to parties of 6 or more. Well there was just 3 of us and they still added it to our bill. I really can't stand when restaurants do sneaky shit like that. I can only imagine how many people don't notice it and still leave an extra tip. I respect business more when they are at least up front about it but to my knowledge I saw no postings stating that regardless of party size they automatically add gratuity. For this reason alone we will probably never return nor recommend this place.",DGY3ijPigPj9J7_hDvzEIQ,7,0,1,t3tPVW8kpfelihnO7vP06A

2404308,2018-06-17,2,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"Just tired this place for lunch today. 

Parking: small parking lot in front of th restaurant. There is a parking lot to the back, but not sure if that is public parking or for the other businesses around there. 

Establishment: it was and really clean. Not a huge restaurant, but nice. Bathrooms were also kept clean. 

Service: great service. Friendly staff and very attentive. When you put in an order for something not on the belt, it gets served to you by this automatic bot thing. It was so cool. It's above the regular sushi belt and stops right in front of your table to serve you. 

Food: sushi was pretty good. There was a review I read on here that said they gave a lot of rice. My experience was different. They actually gave less rice than I expected, which was great for me. I don't like getting full off of just rice. They have a lot of options including crab for $6 more. 

Reason for 4 stars: there was hair in one of the dishes we had. The server promptly apologized and got us a new one. However, no excuses for hair in food. The conveyer belt was frequently bare. Granted the place was packed, but we were sitting towards the end, so everyone had taken everything before getting to us. No biggie, we just ordered from the waitress, but still. 

We will certainly be back, but hopefully the hair situation was a one time thing.",kq61kSviGeXBsqOv3-xiAA,2,2,4,_gzgPPc0Jo2ERhYuJWfD1g

Picked a couple things of the belt that looked ok, but everything tasted subpar, and extremely dry. Plates were indeed 'oily' and dirty as other people have mentioned. Most items were not the color they should have been; they were either on the belt far longer than they should have been, or were not very fresh initially. Tuna was gray, white part of octopus turning brown, even the beef appetizer had a strange purplish color. Only picked up maybe 3 plates before we couldn't find anything that looked appetizing anymore. Didn't eat remotely enough to make up for the cost. I have never been so disappointed with sushi. We actually went over to the other conveyor belt sushi place, Sapporo, afterward just to 'cleanse our palates' with a few plates of amazing, delicious sushi.

2521133,2018-06-17,2,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"LOVE this place. I came for lunch with my family during the grand opening special. Instead of paying $21 per person (lunch pricing), we paid $15 +18% gratuity. 

Service was great. The food quality was excellent! What I like a lot about this place is the sushi doesn't come with humongous rice to make you full like most AYCE places. All the raw fish I had today was really fresh, and the yellowtail was just so so delicious. 

To my surprise, they also had a lot of tasty appetizers and entrees that is included in the price, like Korean short ribs, kimchi fried rice, garlic fried wings, fried shrimp sew mai, oysters and these amazing fried prawns (must try). 

The conveyor belt is a fun concept as usual, but the coolest part is the little machine that delivers food right to your table on the top of the conveyor belt- this is my first time seeing it so it was a really exciting dining experience for me. It looks like a little sushi express train rolling out from the kitchen! 

For dessert they have Melona bars and other fun Korean ice creams. Don't forget to grab a stamp card at the end of your meal, it's their loyalty program for a free meal after 10 lunch/dinner purchases. 

I also learned that conveyor belt etiquette means to not reach for food on the other side, just in case anyone else didn't know... sorry for being fat I was just so clueless and hungry. I'll be back :)",dqU621Ol6vswgP5BjDPU_w,3,2,5,bwJ5fDIo7KhkNSGaAHYK7A

The customer service though is horrible, waiter with the bowl cut was absolutely horrendous. I came in to eat around 3pm and i was offered the promo AYCE for 20.95 or ala carte which is colored coordinated by the plate.... i took the AYCE... first issue i had was it took him 20 minutes just to tell me they were out of a specific item. Not once did he refill my water nor came up to me to ask me if i was good. Also be cognizant of the plate colors if you are ordering ala carte (see picture below) you have the same item on two different plates. The blue plate is priced at $3.50 and the black is priced at $9.99. Thats pretty shady. Which almost forces anyone who would start ala carte to take their AYCE... When it came down to receive the check he included the 18% party of six or more gratuity. I kindly asked why that was on there and he stated it was apart of the promotion and then he stated well you can pay regular price which i gladly said yes to. One thing is to have horrible service in a sort of self serve sushi place but to have shady promotions to trick your customers into paying additional fees to include more gratuity on top of that is not good for business.

We had to chase a server down to first order our drinks and to get a refill or order appetizers. Even when it was slow with 2 other groups in the restaurant the server never checked on us. Then upon asking for the check we were charged auto 18% gratuity for a 2 person party. Liked the food but I will not be coming back.,8oc9lVj2HmfEpiWzDY88vA,0,0,2,O79kIeeXsfemKKbCCLJKgw

I visited this place on a Saturday night (the 15th) and from the very moment I pulled up into that sorry ass parking lot I knew this experience was going to be terrible to say the l least. First off, location: weak as fuck. I busted 3 U's to get into that small ass parking lot that's so easy to miss. How already inconvenient for an AYCE Asian restaurant in the MIDDLE of Chinatown. Whatever though, we go in. It's packed. I'm there with the wife and my three kids and it takes literally an hour of us sitting outside to get seated. Wow. So this tall Asian waitress with a bow took our order. Im sorry I was stuck with this waitress, because of all the servers working there she looked like she really hated the place the most. And on top of that she made my wife uncomfortable with some highly suggestible gestures. Anyways, we order five waters and she comes back with four sink waters without any ice. But I still maintain my composure. The  waitress takes our orders and we start eating from the belt (since it's an AYCE conveyor belt restaurant). This is where I start getting really upset, because with all these people in the restaurant, you would think the food gets rotated fast to where it's fresh all the time. PSYCH. That shit was lukewarm to the last plate, and I shit you not, they had chicken wings on the belt that were COLD but still RAW. Like how does that even happen? And the entrees were not any better. I won't go into detail, because we didn't stay much long after that to eat (we ended up leaving to go eat at Robertos), but in short: the Dungeness Crab we had was undercooked; the pork was low-quality and undercooked as well (very dangerous); and the slices steak they served tasted very funky and disgusting (almost not even like beef). Anyways, we ended up leaving that dump. Clear warning: DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. Too many way better options in the same area to test you luck at this waste of a new restaurant.

A number of belt sushi places use the feature as an excuse to slack in other areas, but Conbea is a great exception. They have quality service, the waiters move very quickly. Their sushi does not lack any of the fundamentals, and the belt is never empty. Their specialty rolls on the belt were conventional, but very satisfying. The Konbea roll is worthy. One order per customer items, such as ama ebi or wasabi masago, arrive on a track above the belt on a cute sushi robot.
Conbea's pricing is all you can eat, which is a mighty fine step up from other belt sushi bars. It is a much more fun experience to take anything and everything from the belt rather than be concerned about going over budget.
Remember to ask about the Korean ice cream, it's not on the menu, but it's quite good.
The bathrooms are clean, but they're singles. Also, space is quite limited, so expect a long wait time.

Konbea offers a good balance of quality, quantity, and novelty. I hope they experience continued success.",sf7amjFNSd72FlzL2YyLMw,0,0,4,kWL0gDiSmkbExHDylw0NEQ

Love the convenience of having to choose what you want from the belt instead of waiting for your order at other AYCE establishments. Each booth can sit about 8 adults comfortably. There are individual seats as well about 29. Came here on a Tuesday, we didn't have to wait to be seated. 

$25.99 + $6.00 with Dungeness Crab 
Kids 3-7 half price 
Kids under 3 $3.00

The reason that I rated this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because my 1 year old was charged $3.00 but I guess she got her money's worth since she ate 2 plates of tamago ($5.00 worth). If your kid under 3 doesn't eat then they won't be charged. (See following pictures for their rules). None the less, we'll be back.

I really tried to be understanding because they are new, and I know a business is hard to run. However, as a customer, we have standards and honestly, they have to make sure their food is good or at least safe to eat. I never expect Nobu quality sushi at an ayce, but at the same time I don't expect to get sick. First off, there was really nothing ever on the conveyer. All the sushi items, I had to order, and they were of horrible quality. It's like they got the cheapest grade fish from their distributors. I had to stop eating because I was afraid I was going to get sick, and my kids stopped eating because they just didn't enjoy it, and usually they love sushi. The conveyer belt is a gimmick at their restaurant. I guess being an ayce and a conveyer restaurant doesn't really work because the people to the right of my family literally took every and anything that came up.

Well, first off, the nigiri was few and far between coming out on the belt, never even saw salmon in the hour we were there, so we ordered a bunch of hot apps off the menu- not one was hot, not even warm.  One thing I ordered never even came out and I ordered two orders of another item and got eight orders instead. The nigiri was tasty but SMALL.
So cut to the bill-
It comes out, and they took it upon themselves to add an 18% gratuity on a party of two themselves!
I was like WTF to the guy who gave me the check and he was like weren't you told this was going to happen? It's to compensate for the discounted restaurant promotion.
No, I was never told that- and he was like well, you should have been.
Now, I'm not cheap, and I tip well, but it's the principal and I really feel like I was ripped off and scammed by this ""promotion"".
I also knew going in that this restaurant had a lot of good reviews, I also figured that out- they give you free sake when you write a review on yelp.

I didn't want to expect much about this place because I've had better, have my faves - plus it's a new spot! The place is a bit small. But we went right before it got busy so we didn't have to wait too long to be seated-we were a party of 7 including a toddler.

First let me talk about the price. You have a choice to either do AYCE or ala carte. They had a promo of $15 for AYCE. So we opted for that. If you think you'll eat more than the AYCE price then it only makes sense to do AYCE. Ala carte prices ranges between $2.50/plate to $9.99/plate depends on the color of the plate. There's also an up charge of $6 for the Dungeness crab 

Food-Everything that we ordered was delicious! Fish to rice ratio is like most sushi spots. I'm not one to order rolls too much but I liked theirs. I really enjoyed their oyster (limited to one order/person), caterpillar roll, and many others that I don't remember the name of coz we just kept eating. 

Like I mentioned above, place is a bit small but wait usually isn't too long. It's clean and very welcoming.

The staff - Very friendly service. Our waitress was very sweet and checked up on us occasionally. They also came by to pick up the plates as they stacked up to allow more room for the next round. The only reason why they lost a star is because they didn't offer a high chair for my toddler. It took a trip to the restroom to see that they had high chairs stacked up right outside of the women's restroom for me to be able to eat freely without carrying my son. I was ok with it because I was misinformed by my sis-in-law that they didn't have any. But still, as a staff, if/when you see someone w a toddler, please offer a high chair-especially if you have one. It would make our experience so much more enjoyable.

Concept is cool, service is good, fish is alright. Thank you to the staff for working under all the extreme pressures with a smile. I think the size of the restaurant is good. Now, onto the food. 

I came around 5:15ish and didn't get sat until 5:45 because they make sure your entire party is together before you're sat. There wasn't a wait. Most of the fish was fresh and decent. I didn't have much problems with this.

Salmon - It was good and had nice color. I didn't have any issues with temperature. 

Blue fin - YUMMM. This was my favorite and the best item! so good!

Toro - also another delicious item! YUM more please! That beautiful marbling... 

Sweet Shrimp - Good! Didn't have a weird taste and nice texture of the crunchy raw shrimp mmm.

Tobiko - Alright, this was good but I didn't realize the green one was wasabi. There has been green ones I've had that were other flavors. TOTALLY caught me off guard. My nose died. I mean I use a ton of wasabi to begin with. So add that on top ughhh.

Red Snapper - I enjoyed this too.

Short ribs - nice flavor and they included my favorite part, the bonessss attached.

Oysters - nice texture, fresh, and good. However, we had to ask 4 times for it because at this point it was getting kinda hectic for them.

Crab - I opted and tried the up charge of the crab. I regretted this. I don't recommend doing this. Both the flavors are visually the same. I had three ordered in total orders. It was super messy which is expected but yeah I kinda wished they pre-hammered it or something. The crab was dry and overcooked. The black bean flavor was a bit better than the salt and pepper one. I couldn't really taste anything on the salt and pepper one.  

So this is where the experience went bad. When they got busier in the night went later, we literally had zero sushi on the belt. By the time it got to us, we had nothing. Luckily I had some sushi to try already before I ate the crab but when I was working on the crab I didn't get any sushi. 

So I wasn't 100% full because we weren't getting anymore sushi. We settled to just grab dessert and go. PLEASE KEEP YOUR DESSERT! I feel as these would be a costly item and will go away eventually or run out. This was probably what I was excited for the most! They had the ice cream with the red bean sandwich and I was so happy they didn't run out!!! YEEE. Melon bars and some flavors of ice cream were available too! 

I'll probably give this another try when they have their grand opening. I sat on the inner left side of conveyor belt. I still got some sushi but i'm pretty sure much of the left side may not have gotten some sushi off the belt.

3783470,2018-05-10,4,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"A new AYCE conveyer belt sushi joint. It says at the bottom of their menu in small print that everyone in your party MUST order the same thing. Meaning if one person wants the additional AYCE Dungeness crab for an extra $6.00, everyone at that table will be charged an extra $6.00, just a heads up. 

Friends and I went during the Soft Opening late night to check it out. Location is meh, there's limited parking in the front of the joint and the place itself isn't super nice or fancy. However when you walk in most of the seating is bars-style with some booths on the side for larger parties. 

Since it was the soft opening I was not expecting TOO much from them. The conveyer belt had little labels that go around saying what sushi would be there. They barely had any though. You had to your waiter that you want freshwater eel or else you were gonna be waiting til forever lol. The selection of fish wasn't that much either. You got your regular salmon and tuna nigiris of course, mackerel, shrimp, yellowtail and freshwater eel is what I remembered going around yet there was barely any to take. But when you do request for certain foods from your waiter, he will either bring it to you or it gets delivered on the cute little train device that goes straight to your table on the conveyer belt. If you've ever been to Sapporo then you know what I'm talking about!

Aside from the fish, there were also entries you could order which includes the Dungeness crab. The crab was pretty good, not sure if I would pay extra $6 for it again though cuz it was a hassle cracking it open and getting little bit of meat. 

Service was ok. I asked them twice for a cup of ice for my can of coke and they forgot up until we were done eating. For the most part everyone was friendly and attentive when it came to picking up dirty plates.

3906929,2018-06-29,0,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,I've always wanted to try out the whole conveyor belt sushi thing since I've seen it in Cali. So we finally have a couple of places here in Vegas & it seemed like it was going to be amazing. Well I can't say it is. I gave 3 stars because all the appetizers we had were really good. We even paid extra to get the crab legs added to our ayce. They had the dungeons crab with black bean sauce & salt & pepper style. Both so good. We ordered a bunch of apps. I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the sushi :( I guess I didn't like the idea of raw fish & pre rolled sushi rolls going around that belt without knowing how long it's been sitting there & looking pretty old . None of it tasted fresh . My favorite thing to always get is uni. Omg their uni was terrible. Very disappointing. So my boyfriend & I had to order a bunch of apps to feel like we got our money's worth cause we didn't eat much sushi. Butttttt we did also really like what they offered for their desserts. Cute Asian dessert ice cream bars & ice cream sandwich. So yummy. So I'm not saying all bad but quality of sushi should be better then appetizers & desserts. This place is brand new so hopefully they work on that.,owjOkU0v0mchVD-1Ngj4Ig,0,0,3,GGZh7sYYxVI88M9ElveGEg

With that being said there were a few things I think should be fixed one of them being a lot of the appetizers that were on the belt were cold or room temperature i.e (calamari, shrimp tempura) the other thing was how we had to keep waiting for the belt to go around constantly in hopes of the rolls or nigiri we wanted to be put on the belt. I assumed the manager of the place took notice of us waiting so he came and asked if we needed anything so that was greatly appreciated other than those two things it was pretty good sushi not as fresh as other places but definitely not bad at all for the price",9cHVXhXvaU0lXWT44S6T3Q,0,0,4,KRZHjkC1M6VvE_gGUgzATQ

The interior aesthetic was debatable, tacky. Furthermore, the color pallet of the plates were horrendous. A stark contrast with its interior design.
Furthermore, the food was essentially subpar. The miso was bland and the fish was only ok at best. My sushi cravings weren't satisfied. The food was expensive and just multiple logistical issues with the restaurant. One, if you don't finish the food, there's an extra charge ranging from $2-$10, depending on what colored plate. Two, the fish wasn't cut well. The presentation just looks sloppy. Three, there's a 45 minute time limit that's listed at the bottom of the menu sheet that I wasn't briefed about.

You can order certain items such as entrée from the Staff. The order will arrive on a train like machine above the conveyor belt. Or, you choose plates from the conveyor belt to eat. Each plate's color represents a price ranging from $2.50 to $9.99.

All You Can Eat (AYCE) is another choice you can pick. For lunch, 11:30AM-3:30PM, the AYCE price is $21.95. The Dinner Price, 3:30PM to 12AM, is $25.99. You can add Dungees Crab to your AYCE for an additional $6. My friend and I only got the Dinner AYCE price.

The food was delicious and fresh. You can see the Chefs working on the fresh sushi. They have rolls, Salmon, Cooked Eel, etc. There didn't seem like a lot of food on the conveyor belt, and if there was something you wanted, if they don't have the plate on the belt, you would just have to wait a while as the Chefs prepare more to place on the belt. This can represent how fresh the seafood is as they cook for the best quality.

Afterwards, enjoy a nice dessert. My friend chose a Melon Bar, while I picked a Crunch Bar. The Crunch bar flavor was Vanilla, Strawberry, and Chocolate. The food was delicious and the staff were really nice and helpful with our order.

They were playing some throwback K-pop songs such as Taeyang's Wedding Dress, Sistar, EXO, etc. It's a nice place to try and see if it suits your fancy.",SiXUv1oE6uTAbbHXOaXy4Q,4,2,4,ALcpGUowSquRqF19QbTHOA

There was a selection of sushi on the conveyer belt, but a lot of them weren't continuously placed on after they were taken off. It did take some time to wait until more sushi was put on or I would have to ask. There's not a huge selection of appetizers either and especially in conveyer belt sushi, I would think there would be more appetizers. The selection is just not as much as you would think. I really had higher hopes for this place and really wanted to like it, but it wasn't what I thought it was. It's fun to try conveyer belt sushi at least once, but I'd rather stick to going to AYCE sushi restaurants where it's made to order and have more selection.

When we walked in on a Sunday evening, we told the first employee we saw that we were a party of 2. He brought us to the register desk and pointed to the sign-in sheet.  This was rather confusing because we could plainly see there were plenty of seats along the sushi bar (versus the 6 booths) and lots of people waiting.  We added our name to the list and proceeded to wait.  It was very apparent that many other customers waiting were irritated by the long wait when there were seats available.  We asked numerous of times if we could sit at the empty seats and were told ""Just a second."" ""Give me a moment."" etc. At my final attempt, the waiter explained he was only allowed to sit customers in his section.  This made a lot of sense and I understood completely why it was so disorganized.  I asked which staff member was in charge of the seats I was inquired about and he pointed her out to me. I asked if we could sit down at these two empty seats (that have been empty for good while) and also told her we were next on the list as well.  She agreed.  That solved our waiting issue.  

The waitress came by to take our drink orders and to explain a little about the menu.  Overall, the sushi was okay and there was nothing special or spectacular about it.  It was standard sushi and rolls.  The rice to fish ratio was okay too.  One exceptionally bad piece of sushi we had was the uni.  It was really awful and tasted like ammonia.  It was truly horrific and would probably be the cause if I was in the toilet later.  (The oyster on the half shell could also be the culprit as well as it's just a bit too milky to be eaten raw.  The squid was also a bit too chewy as in you end up swallowing it whole since it doesn't break down.) We also never received our ""One Time"" Blue Fin Tuna order.  Okay, so there were a few negative points.

For any hot appetizers, you need to order these directly from the wait staff.  A little robot thing will bring it down to your seat above the revolving belt.  The Husband really enjoyed the salt and pepper chicken wings though as they were quite hot when we saw them coming down the belt.  

Our waitress was great about refilling my water, I never had to ask.  And her, along with the clean up staff, were pretty quick about clearing the empty dishes. So that was never an issue. 

The dessert menu indicated items and had ""One Time"" written next to each one, so we assumed it meant you were allowed one of each kind of dessert, not one total.  So, we were disappointed when we tried to order a second dessert and was told we could not. This needs to be clear on the menu that it's one dessert only.

They also add an 18% gratuity because of their promotion, but do not tell you this upfront.  You discover this when you get the bill.  Again, these are things that need to be clear to the customer.

Suggestions to the owners: Hire a dedicated host/hostess for greeting customers and ensuring parties are seated quickly and efficiently. With only 6 booths, we noticed at least three families who needed high chairs be seated at the bar seats.  I heard the staff member ask each party if the bar seat was okay and they all agree only because they were waiting so long.  It was a struggle for each of these families while they attempted to eat.  These parties could have easily been seated at a booth as there was always one available around the same time they were seated.  (Example: A party of four was seated at a booth on the right section right before a party of 4 plus high chair was seated at the bar in the interior left section.)  With the wait staff being only responsible for their sections, they cannot oversee how to accommodate these parties to be more efficient and that's what a host/hostess can do.

I initially was going to give this place a three star, but after writing this review I had to move it down to a 2.  Even if they fix the host/hostess situation, the questionable sushi will not have me returning.

As a grand opening, I wish there was a sign that said you HAVE to get all you can eat. 
Because, although, our server must've said it. My lady and I were more so focused on how the food at this place did NOT look fresh. Or good. 
I tried a salmon sashimi and the rice was hard. I got to try one piece before I was asked what kind of all you can eat I wanted. We didn't want that. So we told her, we'd like to just pay and leave. 
It took awhile to get approved for us to just pay for our 2 plates and leave. 
If the food was good, ok. 
But it wasn't.

It's feels like they tried to make it high end but completely missed the mark. Cheap Chinese take out menus really throw off the experience from the get go as well. Not a place to bring a date lol

Sitting at the bar made things rather difficult to get a servers attention, which made ordering a hassle. The menu had like 6 food items from the kitchen and the rest was alcohol. You should study up on kinds of sushi before going in or you'll spend your 45mins trying to figure out what they have. ( yep there was a 45min limit...)

The quality of fish is pretty bad, even for ayce standards. The portions were too small and by the time the item I wanted got around to me, they were all gone. ( sit on the right side of the restaurant if you don't want to leave hungry)

If you want good AYCE sushi go to Yama or Kaya. If you want good conveyor belt sushi go to Sapporo. 

I'll try them again later this week or the following to see if they got any better. Until then, 2 stars at best

5139424,2018-05-09,3,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"Grand opening this Monday.!

About a 30min wait for dinner left much anticipation for yet another AYCE sushi option in Chinatown, this one armed with an intricate conveyor belt line and awesome robotic server tray that delivers, direct to you, the best options in the house!

Speaking of, order these items here for an enjoyable meal :

Toro / Fatty Tuna.  Look at that marbling...delicious!!  If butter was a fish, it would taste like this ;)

Salt & Peppered Giant Prawns : Garlic, Green Onion & Serrano Peppers.  VERY good, large prawns with some nice spice and crunchy texture!  Definitely one of the best choices here :)

Fresh Oysters.  Surprisingly good actually.  My two were clean, prepped and ready to enjoy.  A bit of additional hot sauce or wasabi would be welcomed.

Melon Bar for dessert.  Order the melon bar...it's awesome!  Creamy, sweet and so artificially flavored yet enjoyable lol.  I am looking to buy a box next time I am in the right store!  The Red Bean Cake was good, but trust in the melon bar...yum!

The conveyor belt itself loses its mesmerizing effect shortly into dinner however, as you clearly see the lack of variety and a bit boring set of ""safe"" choices made by the staff to pacify the hungry mob.

No sushi was dressed with any soy, wasabi, yuzu, ponzu or the like.  I can imagine the less adventurous eaters taking a dislike to the aforementioned, but it handicaps the sushi from being elevated.  Also, inconsistent fish cuts are found throughout, most likely due to less experienced sushi chefs.  Most cuts were good, but some textures were very unappealing...something I haven't experienced in quite some time.

And lastly, the crab was a bit disappointing.  Good flavor in the crab, but the temperature is luke warm and the meat is overcooked.  Most likely cooked once and then reheated at order.  Still not a bad way to spend $6, just not the best reason to visit.  I also found it a chore to eat along with sushi...had to clean my hands multiple times during the meal.

The server made sure we all understood the menu and answered all our questions. We had no time to be confused, we were hungry! We started pulling food off the belt and we didn't stop for 30 minutes! There were times where you were waiting for your favorite sushi to come back around for a few minutes but something new would catch your eyes and right to your stomach. So about time your favorite came back around, you were stuffed lol. At the end of it all, you wonder how many rolls you've had. There is no keeping count.

If you're looking for sauce drenched ponzu sauce nigiri this is not the spot for you as far as sushi is concerned. I feel like the quality of fish is presented here more as their focus. So nothing is really sauced up besides their rolls. I'm pretty sure you can ask for it and they'll gladly give it to you. My suggestion is when you come eat here order crab and wait to eat that first I think the sushi isn't as great as the crab but it was so good I wish I was more hungry after 2 orders. Salt and pepper and black bean sauce Dungeness crab were the selections and it was worth it. Eat more crab and it's all worth the extra $6.

5349106,2018-05-12,1,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"All you can eat conveyor belt sushi? Brand new place? AND it has crab? Come on, I have got to try this. My friends and I came here for dinner on the day they opened. We got there a bit before 7 pm and was quoted a 30-45 minute wait. They were super packed when we got there but .... there was barely any food circling around on the belt. Uh oh. 

Also, by the time we got there, they had already ran out of toro and blue fin tuna. I guess that's to be expected but I still wish that some places could be better prepared when they first open. Konbea Belt Sushi garnered a huge following on Facebook and that alone, they should have expected lots of business when they open.  

When he finally sat down, we were asked what we wanted to eat. There was five of us and each of us got an order of ocean trout. I added an order of salmon into that as well. There were a ton of cooked foods going down the conveyor belt but very few actual sushi items. We had to wait a very long time before we saw any sushi items to munch on.

Salmon: No taste. Not that fresh looking.

Ocean Trout: Pretty good. The only good item they had imho. 

Halibut: Eh. Not that great. 

Octopus: Normal.

Unagi: Pretty good. But we only found two plates of it on the belt. 

Oysters: Not that great. They dress it with sriracha and that was a little weird. 

Salt & Pepper Prawns: A little spicy. Great flavor but some of the shrimp wasn't that good. Some shrimps were a bit mushy and some weren't. Would be great if they could deep fry it a bit more so the shell wouldn't be a pain to eat. 

Also, the funniest thing is... five orders of ocean trout means 30 pieces. I guess I'll need to re-educate myself on how many pieces an order comes with. But it also took forever for us to get our food cause I'm pretty sure the chefs were backed up. 

What's good though is that they didn't enforce the time limit like it said on their menu. Because, I mean, if you can't keep up then that's your problem, not mine. They also didn't enforce the whole ""if one person in your party wants the add on crab AYCE then you all need it"" which is fantastic. One of our friends wanted to try their crab but not...us so he got to have it alone. 

Dessert was good. They give you a choice of different Korean packaged ice cream products like a crunch bar or melon bar. 

Our server was attentive and was quick to take away dishes and covers. She actually used to work at goyemon so she was very well capable of taking care of our needs. 

I originally was going to give Konbea 3 stars but unfortunately, something did not sit well with me afterwards. I started to get some stomach aches around midnight. I'm not sure if it's related but I got food poisoning the next night and my stomach still hurts up to today.

The prices are on par with other AYCE sushi places.  $21.95 for lunch and $25.95 for dinner.  You can add $6 for AYCE dungeness crab.  I didn't see a stamp card offer.

Items come out on the conveyor belt, so if you are a piggy family like mine, you'll want a seat to the right of the restaurant to get first pick of the items.  ""Entrees"" as well as sushi are all on the conveyor belt.  Rolls come out with 4 peices, nigiri with 2.  ""Entrees"" are really just the hot items that come from the kitchen.  The serving sizes are rather small, what most other AYCE places call appetizers.  But they are tasty.  We tried:
Shrimp fried rice - tasty but not something I'd normally get at at AYCE place.  But dad prefers the cooked stuff
Pot stickers - very good, not a meat fillind
Lettuce wrap - this was primarily mushrooms but really tasty.  Just wish there weren't so much of the fried shrimp cracker type stuff inside
Dungeness crab in black bean sauce - this was my favorite of the two crab preparations but some was over cooked so it was hard to get the meat out
Dungeness crab salt and pepper - this had jalapenos and was a bit salty
Prawns - really good though a little over cooked
Kalbi - nice flavor but a little tough
garlic beef - very tough

They have a few items that are one order only 
Blue fin tuna - out of stock
fatty tuna - perfect!
ama ebi - really good but no heads.  :(
tobiko - they had wasabi tobiko which had quite the kick and the red tobiko which I prefered
oysters - very plump and well cleaned

I don't think there was anything we tried that we didn't like.  Servers were friendly and efficient, especially with such a crazy crowd.

Only downsides I can think of are bathrooms are singles, not a lot of parking, and not a lot of tables/seats so big parties will have problems here.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,1,1,5,uXMMNEWNh8-RMt6gvdqR8w

5515166,2018-06-16,0,BIuXMWuQIlC1ZlC3lTzy-w,"Conveyor belt sushi? AYCE? Sounds like a combination but it fell extremely short.

The sushi itself is subpar. The conveyor belt idea was great and interesting however when I was seated, there were barely any plates on the belt. It took them a good 10 minutes to have everything set and even then, it wasn't great. On the conveyor belt, the sushi, including the rolls and nigri, had condensation on the top of the lids meaning that it was the fish was heated. The sushi itself was room temperature warm and didn't taste fresh which was then followed by a bland texture and an unsatisfying aftertaste.  It was rolls upon rolls and barely any nigiri. There isn't an option to specifically order a plate. 

As a grand opening for two months straight, you'd assume that the prices would be fair. 5 dollars off of the original price for lunch (roughly $17) and dinner (roughly $20) sounds like a great deal however the real annoying part is that they charge for gratuity (18%). No one mentioned that gratuity for a grand opening was to be included for 2 people ($52 at dinner time). Not the staff nor the store owner mentioned this. Even on the menu, it states that only parties of 6+ people are to be charged this. 

They wanted to charge me extra (which is regular price and some extra) for food that I did not enjoy. To have a ""grand opening"" for 6 weeks and to charge extra is disrespectful. If you want to have a good customer loyalty, communicate to them the price. You are a business and good business practice comes with the fact that you acknowledge the customer rather than hiding it when the check comes. 

As a new business attempting to establish itself, it had a lot of potential. Customer service was okay at best, place was clean, and was seated quickly. But I came for the food. The food was bland and followed by an extra charge?

Driving up.. this place has very limited parking in the front but there are more in the back of the building.. 

Walking into the restaurant... the decor is very simple.. with a couple of TVs on the one wall.. 

Music was at a medium volume... and they were playing top hits.. 

You can see the sushi chefs towards the back and of course you'll see the conveyors belts making their way around the restaurant..

Booth style seating on the outside with bar style seating against the belt along the outside and inside as well..

Price is your typical all you can eat prices at $21.95 and if you want some dungeness crab.. its an additional $6.. not too bad.. and if you dont want all you can eat their prices varies on the color of plates you select. 

Food quality was very great and very flavorful. their sushi to rice ratio was ok.. they do come smaller than other sushi spots.. and its usually 2/3 pieces on each plate for sushi..

Since the sushi is on the track.. those who sit where it starts have the first pick and sometimes the hot item sushi can go very quick and youll have to end up either waiting for another batch... or call over the waiter and place an order.. where it will either be hand delivered or it comes on this special express sushi cart that comes right to your table... cool!

staff was very friendly and patient and they would come around every now and then to make sure we were ok and clean up our plates as it started to stack up.. but when it gets very busy... waiting for one can be a while.. 

tip: at other conveyor belt sushi places ive been too.. it was very convenient if the tables had their own tablet where we can place orders whenever i wanted..

also maybe add more items to the menu...

other than that.. i had a great time and my family also enjoyed their meal..

I like sushi with cream cheese and they didn't have it on the belt I simply just ask one of the sushi chef and he made it with out any questions. That is what customer service is about!! I highly recommend this place!!,KlYiUEb8UvZniCOSICrAEQ,1,1,5,VsIxleC_TtUWkk8Njdmn-w
