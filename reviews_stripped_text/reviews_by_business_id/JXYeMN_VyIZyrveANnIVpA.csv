396054,2017-03-22,0,JXYeMN_VyIZyrveANnIVpA,"Worst Subway I have ever been to. Three of us ordered personal pizzas. The very rude woman making them was in a big hurry. She was rushing everything. We would tell her one of things we wanted in it and she would quickly throw it on and then put it right in the oven before we had a chance to say what else we wanted on it. So once it came out of the oven we said we wanted vegetables in it. They said well if we put veggies on it now and put back in the oven it will make the pizza too hard. We said but we were not done saying what we wanted on the pizza. The rude lady didnt even ask if we wanted anything else. She just rushed it in the oven   The cashiers asked the lady making the pizza what happened and she started blaming us. Speaking in spanish that we were being to slow and picky. They didnt realize that our friend that was with us speaks spanish si she understood everything.  Si she called the woman out on it and theu tried to deny what they said. All very rude people working their. Horrible service and the pizza sucked. Mine was nit even cooked enough, my Husband had to have raw veggies on his because theu already cooked the pizza before he was able to add toppings. Just a horrible experience. Avoid this Subway at all cost. .",oz4lC2347nzQOH-Nqg2psQ,0,0,1,uzqkF3Z1ErNIEyUm9Bg8Eg

1600235,2011-11-05,3,JXYeMN_VyIZyrveANnIVpA,"Yeah. Subway. Blah Blah Blah.

They're all the same, right? Not always. This one sucked.

This location is somewhat close to my office. I thought I would pop in for the ""Anytober"" deal. Yeah, I got a $5 sandwich, but the bread was stale, the sandwich was lifeless, and the experience was...forgettable.

If I'm in the mood for a sandwich while I'm at work, I'd rather take my business to Capriotti's or Jimmy John's.",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,1,1,2,boKcRldsvhgxQasxZ0gOlg
1632173,2016-12-23,0,JXYeMN_VyIZyrveANnIVpA,I have been amazed once again by how horrible subway is. I keep wanting to give subway a chance because I remember when it used to be good. But by far this one has been the worst. they charge Waymore than all the other locations the person making the sandwich doesn't listen they don't give a crap. Overall very poor and bad experience will never return to this subway.,mfVpQYxtYiRcnLoa3M7X5Q,2,0,1,LR7aKdi1e0u7JR1gJtoJ_Q

DO NOT BUY a subway card here or even bother using your credit card at this place.  I paid $80 for an unusable fraudulent card here.  Do not make the same mistake I did. Do not eat or shop at this Subway if you don't want to get ripped off.  I bought it card, both the website and their 1800# say it doesn't work, I tried to get my money back and they ""didn't know how to refund"" because the Manager was either too stupid to properly train the employees.

3227457,2017-06-06,0,JXYeMN_VyIZyrveANnIVpA,"The sandwich wasn't sloppily made and didn't fall apart the instant I opened the package.  I ate at a subway in San Francisco that was of that caliber.  So with that being said, obviously, Subways can vary wildly in quality.  

I was staying on the strip, and there was a closer Subway at Circus Circus which I avoided due to all the 1-star reviews.  So I gave this one a chance since it was just a few minute drive.  

I definitely do not regret giving this one a chance, as I've come here a few times during my trip here.  Sandwich quality and customer service were 5-stars, I took off a star due to the price; a part of which is no doubt the location, so maybe it'd be more of 4.5 star location than 4.",h6ot_bquX8eZ5OmYQUlCWg,0,0,4,MsGT4AmpGt3C4H-p4WaC6w
3579313,2015-03-29,0,JXYeMN_VyIZyrveANnIVpA,"This Subway handling of the lunch rush was average.  The wait time on one day was a few minutes, but 10-15 on another day.  They were losing business as people walked out when they saw the line.  

This location doesn't take Subway frequent buyer cards.  Boo!

This is a fine Subway to go to, but not one of the best in the franchise",jD8SiB96Ezm514VRFsYvMA,0,0,3,MabYsnKkpUuUAMYzzBDguA

5278065,2015-06-04,1,JXYeMN_VyIZyrveANnIVpA,"This Subway has some, er, interesting characters that patronize this location. This could probably be chalked up to the fact that the Subway here isn't in the best area. When Thai Pepper failed me and my husband, we ended up here for a quick meal. I instantly noticed that most tables were dirty. When paying for our meal, there was a bit of a language barrier. While trying to enjoy our lunch, we were bothered by drunken fools trying to make conservation with us. I hate talkative drunk people! I highly doubt I'll be returning to this location.
