First thing we order for 2-3 people  all beef so when it served  I started cooking then the waiter came back and said i told u to wait    He wanted to be the one cooking .. I'm like ummm isn't this cook your own !?!  So he keeps coming back and putting  the meat.. I felt uncomfortable coz I feel he comes more than actual enjoying  the food and cooking.. the meat it maybe high quality of meat but who cares if u don't even enjoy it much.. besides if I wanted someone to cook ill go to regular restaurant .. 

Overall I won't go back unless got invited by a friend ..   they should just let their costumer do their thing  or ask them if they would like help them cook ..

Our party was pretty slow with trying to figure out how to go about things like ordering and cooking since it was our first time here. At first the servers were great and friendly with helping us but then after putting the first selection of meat for us it went south. We tried to cook the first plate that came out since we were told by another server to finish so they can bring another plate out. So we tried to cook the meat but then another server was noticeably pissy  by our placement of the meat not being on the center of the grill which we didn't know it was a no-no. We've been to AYCE KBBQ places together before so we're used to just placing it wherever but there are just things you can say in a different tone to not show how peeved you are. Then we got the other plate and another server has to comment on us to move faster. By the time we finished we waited for the longest time, about over 45 minutes for our bill to come. This is after we helped the runner clean our table completely and it was the runner that I had to ask for the bill from or else we would've never gotten it.

They changed the type of grill depending on the fat content of the beef.  They also ""introduced "" the various cuts of meat.  Like many restaurants, it seems like once they get established when they are new, the quality and service start to wane.  My most recent visit was last week.  The server was rushed, the grill was never changed, and the quality of the food was average. My family and I will not be returning.  It actually saddens me.

The place is very clean, and well designed around Korean culture. In the center of the restaurant, they have tables raised just off the floor. We were seated on the outer edge, at the tables for 4, and these are placed at normal height (for Americans). They played american music, and the young Korean staff could be heard singing along quietly from our table. They were in very good spirits. My wife and I ordered the marinated beef, chicken, and pork dinner for two. I also ordered a Hite beer, and they brought out a large bottle of beer, which was like 22 ounces I think. My wife ordered the Korean raspberry wine, of which she gave me a taste, and was delicious. They brought out several sides, among which were Korean glass noodles, to dried radish, and kimchi (which I love), seafood soup, mixed veggies (with its own dipping sauce that was sweet and hot) and dipping sauces for the meats, and a few others that I can't remember the names of. Your table gets literally full of little side dishes. And you're picking off these while the meat is cooking. The staff cooks the meat for you, (probably for health code reasons) so they are frequently at your table. They cook the meats on a grill that comes up through the center of your table. They even change the grill halfway through the dinner so we had a fresh one when they started the chicken. The service was above expectations, and we were never wondering where a person is if we needed anything. The food itself was absolutely phenomenal. They nailed the marinades on each of the meats. The sides were all delicious as well, even though we both had our favorites. At the very end of the meal, they brought out two cinnamon teas in tiny little cups. Just enough to taste, but not too much because you are so full from the meal that you can't drink the whole thing, which you will be. There was so much meat that by the time we got to the last pork protein, we could not eat another bite. The staff reassured us that this is normal, and boxed up the remaining items. The price was just over $90 for my wife and me, and honestly I expected it to be more considering the sheer volume of food we got. I remember we were saying that we could have easily had brought two more people with us to eat everything that they brought out. I would rate this among the most exceptional dining experiences we've had in the Vegas valley, and we will definitely be going again.",97pTP_sg6MIUuvtGp856pA,1,1,5,I3VzVUzwk5eH99MVkFLJ1w

DRINKS: They serve iced rice tea to their customers. It's hard to drink if you're not used to it. They have a full drink menu with beer, wine, shoju, and more.

DINING: Their portions are a little smaller than other restaurants and they do not have all you can eat. Their meat is very low quality and very tough to chew. They serve everything with the small Korean side dishes. I like this place because they give a lot of side dishes.Their menu is pretty full with all your favorite Korean bbq dishes so everyone is sure to have something they will enjoy.

First, the meat.  Three of us shared the beef platter, a series of 5 increasingly fatty, non-marinated cuts followed by Bulgogi.  Between the staff cooking the meat and you taking pieces when they're done to your liking, it works really well.  The first 5 cuts need some seasoning post-cook and you can choose from two flavored salts or a soy-based dipping sauce.  The quality of the beef was outstanding.

Second, the sides.  There's about a dozen or so little dishes that come with the platter and they're really, really good, and you can ask for seconds (maybe more) on the ones you like best. Great variety - kimchi, noodles, two salads, raw vegetables, pickled vegetables, radish and a bunch of others that were hard to figure out exactly what they were other than delicious.  Also with the beef platter comes a choice of soup - we got tofu and it was great - and four small pancakes that they cook prior to the beef.  

All together, the beef platter for 2-3 with the sides and the soup could easily serve 4 adults.

The staff are very helpful and attentive and the interior is clean and mid-2000 modern.  Overall, a great dining experience and a fantastic Korean BBQ joint.",rIBKugmqaHr31-puHAk7cg,1,1,5,e5vOG_TqJNsNAhzRuMNlRA

Decor is amazing and quite different from any other KBBQ place in town. Very clean and open. I noticed they had those ""floor seats"" where you have to take off your shoes and put your legs in a hole areas for larger groups. Nice quiet ambiance. ""Older style"" hoods up in the air causing the smoke to NOT go in and get exhausted (rip) 

Service was pretty immediate and friendly. Very attentive and they cook for you as well. 

My friend wanted the pork platter so we had ordered that

Pork Platter ($42 - Good for 2-3 people) - Consists of Pork Belly, Pork Jowl, Marinated Pork Outside Skirt, and Spicy Marinated Thinly Sliced Pork

Combination platters come with steamed egg and a choice of soup (kimchi, doenjang [bean paste], or soft tofu) 

Other combinations they have are

Beef Platter ($65 - Good for 2-3 people) - Consists of Prime Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Chuck Flat, Prime Flat Iron, Thinly Sliced Prime Brisket, Marinated Thinly Sliced Ribeye

Beef & Pork Platter ($85 - Good for 4-5 people) Consists of Prime Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Chuck Flat, Thinly Sliced Prime Brisket, Pork Belly, Spicy Marinated Thinly Sliced Pork, Marinated Thinly Sliced Rib Eye

Goong Special ($145 - Good for 4-5 people) Consists of Wagyu Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Boneless Short Rib, Wagyu Chuck Flat, Prime Flat Iron, Pork Belly, Pork Jowl, Marinated Prime Short Ribs, Black Tiger Shrimp

They do have individual options too to order (BBQ, Marinated BBQ, various entrees, 

First of all. TONS OF SIDE DISHES ! We were two people in a booth, we almost had our entire table covered in side dishes and what not. Didn't even have our own individual plate/bowl for eating. Lol xD Sliced pickled daikon, potato salad, onion salad in light sauce, jap chae, fish cake, romaine sesame oil dressed salad, black beans, spicy raw octopus, kimchi, chives, iceburg lettuce salad, and a plate of seaweed, carrot and cucumber sticks with a small bowl of gochujang. Each person also gets a dish of green tea salt and normal salt and pepper, and a dish of sauce

Like another place in town, i believe they have their own butchering to provide such a vast variety of meats AND be able to serve raw beef (one of their dishes consisting of julienned raw beef marinated with salt, garlic and sesame oil - needs to be super fresh meat to do this)

------------------------------------------
they have different grills for different meats. Pork tends to be the flat metal plate vs Beef being a more open grate 

Pork belly and pork jowl came out first and was cooked first. Service was very attentive that neither side were burnt and was flipped constantly. Pork especially with lots of fat tends to burn fast later on but none were. Beautifully cooked. Tender and juicy. 

Marinated Pork Outside Skirt was nicely done. Not overly flavorful. Fairly light. Tender and juicy. Awkward various sizes on some pieces but im not too picky about that. 

Spicy Marinated Thinly Sliced Pork is like the normal spicy pork but sliced thinner. Cooked fairly fast too. 

-----------------------------------------
Service was very attentive. It was a slow night. If they can keep this up even when they are busy, that would be amazing

I did notice as we were leaving that one of the waiters were up and cleaning the hoods. I noticed how clean the bottom of the grill was prior to cooking. Maybe they clean each individual one after use? Would be nice if they cook uphold that AND keep it going. 

Definitely would come back to try the beef.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,6,2,4,un-f8ks7OyM4Vp44AxaV4A

I was hesitant to go for dinner because the prices were high but I knew their meat was of superior quality. My boyfriend and I were extremely pleased more than we expected. The large amount of sides immediately made me happy. Their staff was very attentive and nice (which is not common for Asian restaurants) The staff cooked our meats according to our preferences and changed our grill when necessary. The grill heats up super fast too. (I am a bit impatient during grill changes but this was not a concern). I also liked the fact that I got to chose the type of soup we wanted. I love tofu soup and it was probably one of the most flavorful broth that I have ever had in Las Vegas. 

I cannot say that they are better than Hobak because the experience was entirely different but both places are great.  (I might like this place better).

1650088,2017-11-28,3,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"This is our favorite date night outing. It is near our home, I love Korean BBQ, and it is a classy place with wonderful service. The restaurant is spacious, clean and boasts a modern design infused with traditional Korean decorative touches. This is NOT cheap or a place akin to AYCE joints, so I would not recommend if you are on a budget. Another complaint I saw was that the servers are ""overly involved"" in terms of cooking the meat. I appreciate that because it alleviates the smoke, improperly cooked meat, oh-crap moments where they have to run over to a table and douse it in water. It makes for a relaxing, semi interactive experience. 
They have an extensive beverage menu and we always opt for Chum Chubum Soju because I love anything that tastes like peach. It is reasonably priced at $12 for a bottle and it is more than enough between the two of us.
We opt for the Beef Combination Platter ($65) which includes prime rib eye, wagyu top sirloin, prime chuck flat, prime flat iron, thinly sliced prime brisket and marinated thinly sliced rib eye. The banchan is pretty standard consisting of kimchi, spicy radish, soybean sprout, Oi Muchim (spicy cucumber salad), watercress namul, fried tofu, etc. One most certainly gets their money's worth, but make sure to come hungry!
I have always found the service to be consistent, courteous and accommodating. I also don't mind the extra hand in helping cook my meat to perfection.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,13,11,5,0u9jG138M4mexoZSnzAqHA

1674301,2016-05-20,4,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Let's see high reviews again and I jump on any new Korean restaurant so of course I had to come here. After having really good Korean food in LA I promised to never eat Korean in Vegas so I don't get disappointed. But this place has pretty good quality in comparison to other Korean restaurants in Vegas. 

First of all my hubby and I came here and we're the only customers. Later 3 tables got filled up but service was pretty good at first. 

Ok who goes to Korean BBQ for the salad? But really I appreciate a good salad with my food. They brought us two salads. One is excellent and I got many refills. One I didn't touch which had bottled dressing that I did not care for. It was more of an American salad look to it. I liked the variety in the banchan and overall it seemed fresh. I didn't particularly like the little patties, potato salad was good but I try to avoid carbs and stick to salad. Japchae was good.  I found the carrot sticks and I think it was cucumber with red pepper sauce odd (their take on buffalo wings' carrots and celery with ranch?)

On to the meat. We got the combo which it said is for 3 people. It didn't have all the meats I wanted to try but we figured since it's our first time we will try the combo. The majority of the meats were good,not amazing but the portion did seem small of how much of each they give. It ended up filling us up so it was fine. I thought the way the meat was served was cute and in theory sounded good but it didn't end up working too well then labels were removed and they put more than one meat on the grill (some were the same size) and so it was hard to differentiate between the meats and I had to ask waiters a few times which meat was what. 

I like the high ceilings, the non existent smoke filled rooms that usually KBBQ has, the modern look. It definitely sparked my interest enough to return and order a la carte next time. 

Although it does not compare to LA I think it's pretty good for Vegas. I want to try it again before making my final verdict.

I did have a little issue which is the same at all Korean restaurants- do I cook or does the waiter? They start off cooking then it's me then it's me waiting ""Are they coming back? Do we just do it ourselves?"" are questions commonly asked. I don't want to offend them but I don't want my meat overcooked!",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,4,4,4,NMtJjVgFyrxUV65q8GAfbg

I love that the restaurant is spacious, clean and modern. Love the many sides they give and the quality of the meat, this and Hobak definitely have the best meat quality in all of the Korean BBQ places and decent pricing too. 

But I was so annoyed being there, to the point where I could not have a conversation with my friend. We had about 4 different servers taking care of us... you would think this is awesome and service should be beyond expectations..but no. 

It was my first time there so I needed time to look over the menu, I asked the first server to give us some time, then 2 other servers came by wanting to take our order so we had to ask for more time again. 

Then my friend wanted pictures of some of the dishes so we told one of the servers that we can cook the meat ourselves, she let us be but the other servers kept coming by asking us if we are sure we want to do it ourselves. Then my friend wanted to cut the pork belly before it was fully cooked so it can cook more quickly, but a server came by and rudely asked ""You cutting before its cooked?"" - then he took over with the meat and told us ""Don't cut ok?!"" ... Seriously?!? We asked to be left alone... and they keep coming over acting like we don't know how to grill meat. The same guy came back and keep cooking our meats and was putting meat that I did not want onto my plate so he can cook more meat...they kept coming over and being in our faces we had to stop our conversation every time they come by. 

I get it that they are trying to give you good service, they are trying to cook the meat for us and its really nice of them... But they should let us be when we ASKED for it multiple times. My friend and I prefer to cook our own meat so we can eat at our own pace... these servers kept coming by and cooking meat continuously and we felt rushed to eat them all before they are over-cooked. 

They really should not have too many people working the same table, and they clearly don't communicate with each other since we had to repeat ourselves multiple times. The staff here are way too aggressive...it is as if they get annoyed that you are cooking your own meat! 

I really enjoyed the food, best meat quality and a great variety of side dishes. But when I have a meal, I like to be able to talk to my friends, I like to eat at my own pace and I generally like to be left alone so I could comfortably eat.

I am a Korean so I think I have a good position to rate any Korean restaurant.

I rated 4 stars because they provided below

1. Very clean  and comfortable seats  2. Quite so very easy to conversation

3. Very kind of all staffs I met today  4. WOW free 10 over side dishes

5. Prices are reasonable    6. taste of Bulgogi ( kinds of beef and most common BBQ in South Korea)  is so so but the price is only $11.00 per one person. 

7. Interior is so nice and looks over moderate -class 

Recommend this restaurant?    ABSOLUTELY ! 

I could rate 5 stars if I tried other dish because my friend ate Kalbi  and he liked it very much.

The one of the best Korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas,  I think.",P5qVRKWJtT9ZX4uQKmenaA,0,0,4,bkMRyEpm5_b92BG67nF75w

This is not an all you can eat Korean bbq...just wanted to make that clear. We weren't sure what to get so we tried their beef platter. It comes with about 5 different kinds of meat. Each serving is about 4oz. When we got the meat, we were ready to order more thinking it wasn't enough. We were so wrong!! Jay was our server was awesome. He went above and beyond to take care of us so in return we took care of him too (by giving him a good tip). They serve so much ban chans that that alone made us half full already.

We walked in with another group and both were seated at the same time.  We sat there for over ten minutes and no one greeted us. There were several workers surrounding us cleaning up for the night. Although they list longer hours, it appeared that they were ready to shut down. We got up and walked out and no one said anything. It was pretty apparent that they wanted us to leave. 

Pro: We decided to give this place another shot and came in around 7PM. I am SO GLAD that we did. The quality of the food is incredible!! It is probably the highest quality Korean BBQ we have had in all of Vegas. The prices are well worth it! They insist on cooking the food for you as opposed to other Korean BBQ restaurants that allow you to do it yourself. Given that this is my fiancé's favorite part of the experience, he asked if they would mind allowing him to cook it himself to which they said no problem. They did pop over every now and then to offer tips. They also wanted us to move faster than we were (not sure why) but we insisted that we wanted to take our time.

The parking is a bit tricky so car pool or park by the dentist office and get your steps in. The atmosphere was fun and stylish. Each seating area had lots of room with big tables which is so important when eating this style of food. We were greeted instantly and all the server's were very attentive. We went for dinner. I like to cook it myself and I had great conversation with each server that tried to help. I ordered the marinated meat combo and each flavor was better than the last. It may seem expensive but they serve you so much food. Totally worth it. The spicy chicken was a maranade of greatness. They make Lychee Beer and all there own sauces and kimchi.

2155237,2018-05-13,1,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Came here last night for my brother's graduation party and it started out pretty rough but rebounded quickly.  We had reservations for 8 at 4 and when we arrived they told us we didn't.  They eventually found our reservation (for two sets of 4, since each table seats 4) and we got in, 10 minutes later.  We had 6 menus between us and when my father asked for more, the waitress took my sisters and gave it to him...but then I asked for two more and two were brought out.  

We ordered our food, the two biggest things on the menu and the appetizers started coming out and filling our table which is cool because of the variety but the lack of space on the table was annoying.  As she was bringing out the side dishes, she spilled some sauce all over my brother's shoe and then just left it there until like 15 minutes later she got a napkin and put it on the floor over the spill (never picking it up over the course of the whole meal).  She then offered to clean my brother's shoe, again after about 20 minutes.  She took it and cleaned it which was nice but didn't do the best of jobs.  My sister also never got her apple soju she ordered.  I also feel like pop should have free refills instead of $2/can. 
 
Now, on to the food.  The side dishes were plentiful and some of them were indeed good but there was also a fair amount that were just ehh but I blame that on my lack of knowledge of Korean food and how little I've had of it.  The meat started coming out and it looked incredible.  Marbling was perfect, size was plentiful, and unlike some Korean BBQ places, the waitresses at Goong cook your food at your table for you so there's no guessing on when it is done.  The meats were amazing and just about erased my doubts about this place from the service.  They were spectacularly tender and melted in your mouth.  I loved the green salt that we had to add to it!   There was so much that our other table couldn't finish their food so the chefs cooked it up and packaged it to go for them which was awesome.

Even though the service started off pretty shaky, the quality of the ingredients and the fact that we didn't have to cook on a crappy, under-powered plate really brought this place miles ahead of other places in the valley (cough cough Gen).  I would gladly go back here because it was so darn tasty!  Maybe the service was ehh because we had a big group or because they only had one person sserving us even though the restaurant was dead or because she was just having an off day...idk but regardless, if you want some quality Korean BBQ, come here!",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,1,1,4,VNiqGLADTjxhnuG9LGfN6g

Service
Generally pretty friendly and attentive. Meat was brought promptly and cooked well for us at the table. Extra sides were gladly provided as well on request. 

Ambiance 
Fairly standard Korean BBQ place, though they have some unique tables where you take off your shoes and sit on cushions (we tried this). It sounds odd but was actually comfy. If you do this, though, get a table on the end. If you're in the middle there's nowhere to rest your back. That looked not so comfy. 

Food
You can order packages of assorted meats or al la carte (we did this as we wanted kalbi which didn't seem to be in the packages). They bring tons of amazing sides first as is Korean tradition. Then they come prepare the meat for you. We had a spicy pork and kalbi. Both were very good though kalbi was not quite as tender as we would've liked. Generally the meat seemed of good quality. We noticed ""martinis"" on the menu in assorted flavors for $6. Seemed like a good deal, so we tried a peach and a grapefruit. They tasted like juice. I don't think there was booze in them at all. Well, they were delicious juices anyway. 

Mojo 
Overall a good Korean BBQ establishment with quality meat and good service and unique seating options. If you go, ask if the martini has booze in it before you order :)",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,1,2,3,q2mDGbuJwjbCO42x9R-H3A

It says it feeds 4 to 5 people, we we're 3 and a baby and  we all left happy and satisfied. It's different than other Korean BBQs I've been to, they put the meats on the grill for you and like come by and flip them and tell you when they are ready. Took me a sec to get used to that, but honestly the meats were all cooked better than when we've done it on our own haha. I felt like the service is super super attentive. The only thing is, they didnt give us like empty plates to like put the meats on when they are done. I feel like we were supposed to eat them off the grill, but they give you a million sides and apps and salads ( not complaining) and then the meats and they cool them one by one so we kinda felt like rushed a lil bit. I have a baby so I am pretty accupied a lil bit to like hurry up and eat the meats, and at one point they told us our meats were getting burnt haha. But we asked for plates and got them and problem was solved and it was smooth sailing after that. And they have soda by the can and even their tea was canned or bottled and I hate that at any place. But they do give you ice water in cute little cups and this awesome cinnamon tea at the end of your meal. This place was great in both food and service. We will totes be back.

2192781,2016-09-07,4,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"I came to Goong based on a recommendation from a friend that lives for Korean BBQ. It been while since had some so figure mix it up plus never been so why not right. I meet up with my cousin for dinner because Korean BBQ for one really makes no sense. Lol. 

The menu has a nice diversity and since it was both of our first time just made things more confusing. If not AYCE I always find that get the dinner for two or three people all based on the party...safe way too go. We decided on the beef platter for two or three people. Guess most of the meats all Wagyu meats or they promote it very clearly on the menu and in the restaurant. The lists of meats might not seen like lot there was six different cuts. It more then enough food. The SIDES never seen spread that literally covered the entire table. Hell we had no room for bowl of rice or the fact ordered cold spicy noodle dish (it sounded interesting and never had cold buckwheat noodles). The sides comes with two different soups both hell of good. The kim chee soup had great depth not just kim chee heat and the egg soup or custard really really good. I could have ordered big bowl of both with side of rice be happy camper. The sides so many different ones no way going remember them all. I been to other Korean BBQ that give you lot of sides but not only the different sides but some of them nice portion not just tiny scoop or couple pieces. Really no bad side that can remember they all solid plus one was japache. Two different kinds of salad that was really refreshing way to start the meal. The first set of meats comes on a really nice display each marked for the four different cuts. Definitely give it five stars on the presentation!!! They even had tags on them all fancy. They ask you the cut want start off with first. We just went with the waitress recommendation since it was our first time. Finish off was the brisket and last one was bulgogi. Halfway through they changed the grill always something notice and look for at Korean BBQ. The more meat or protein cook that should be automatic. They did! All the meats were awesome! SoooOOOO much food. I went into cow coma by the end of it. Some sides that never got around to cause I was that full of meat. Normally say AYCE Korean BBQ only way to go. Really with the recent rush of Korean BBQ or Hot Pot places around town. Quality over quantity is the Korean BBQ way too go. 

The platters may look pricey at first sight. If you break it down steal of deal in my mind. If you factor in all the sides (literally that could count for meal by itself...no joke) and the different protein. Awesome. The interior is very modern then other places around town. It little more dark on the inside with the decor. I like the way the booth and table set up with the grill. The location can be little deceiving cause it kind of hidden from DQ in front of it. I drove past it by accident. Just look for the DQ. If the parking lot full no worries just park at the one right next too it.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,6,4,gyGbwnulZgvBXTRD5VBIDA

The wagyu and bulgogi was the most tender imo off the meat selection, and being able to get a larger platter to try a variety of selections makes the experience more fun and enjoyable; something I highly recommend.

This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas for KBBQ. This isn't AYCE and you pay more for the better quality... But the fact that you're actually getting decent quality cuts of meat instead of the utter crap that is rampant at your standard KBBQ restaurant is well worth it. 

My love and I came in with Philip T. and Ayumi K. to share a feast of meat and a surprisingly wonderful assortment of banchan...after all, who doesn't love a feast of meat with wonderful sides? The four of us shared the Goong Special Platter that consisted of wagyu ribeye, wagyu top sirloin, wagyu chuck flat, prime boneless short rib, prime flat iron, pork belly, pork jowl, marinated prime short ribs, black tiger shrimp, and a choice of soup for $145. The meat portions were hearty, and It was more than enough food due to the ample and delightfully tasty banchan. Not a brad price per person with four of us...though if you aren't keen on enjoying great banchan side dishes the meat-centric individuals may only want to split this serving three ways.

Our server cooked the meats for us...he was attentive and accommodated our cooking temperatures nearly all of time. The hoods were good, minimizing the notion upon walking out that you just bathed in Korean BBQ...a huge plus! We shared a couple bottles of wine and still walked away at a reasonable price for the four of us.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,32,25,4,QREEs-iiWJHGk9yJHRcI6w

This place is convenient and opens late. But the portions are extra small! My party (4ppl) got the beef combo platter($65). The platter included ALOT, ALOT of sides, from tofu soup, steamed egg, jap chae, kimchi, water kimchi....etc. That was a great plus to our dinner! I honestly could of just been satisfied with eating all the side dishes! When we started grilling our meat. The grill was not set high enough to sear the outside of the meat, instead it started dehydrating our meat! So our first & seconds sets of beef were extra dry! Tasted like beef jerky!! By the time we had the 3rd set of beef on the grill we finally turned up our grill ourselves. After all that I would say their beef is just okay. I personally would of liked my beef marinaded and or seasoned. We also ordered the grilled tiger prawns, it was ok. 
The best tasting item here is probably the free jap Chae. Other than that I don't think I would be back! I'll rather drive the extra few miles down to spring mountain and eat at Hobak! I can't wait to try Magal BBQ soon!",_Ix0imjISj59nrjy25y0OQ,3,1,3,O5zKp-bX0J1h2-RLHwL58A

I'd have to say though, the quality and taste is above and beyond many other KBBQ in town. I'd have to say this takes 2nd best in Korean BBQ in Sin City for me. (Hobak #1).

Tables are large with plenty or space for you to spread out so you don't have to worry about bumping elbows. 

They've got so many different cuts of meat that's it's overwhelming. You're better off going with one of their specials like the Goong special ($145) advertised as being good for 4-5 people. It includes wagyu rib eye, wagyu top sirloin, prime boneless short rib, wagyu chuck flat, prime flat iron, pork belly, pork jowl, marinated prime short ribs, and black tiger shrimp. With that many items it's easy to lose track of what is what. So, you just dig in. I think some of my favorites were the wagyu rib eye... or was it the top sirloin... or maybe the flat iron. I don't really know. Again, it was hard to remember what cut I was eating, but it was all good.

Another thing that was slightly confusing was the banchan... was that all you can eat? We had to request seconds of a couple dishes. And, when the bring out dishes you have to eat them family-style not individual dishes.

3072785,2016-04-16,0,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"I'm originally from Los Angeles, Koreatown and moved to Las Vegas 5 years ago. Good Korean food is hard to come by in Vegas, and it wasn't until I discovered Soyo Barstraunt that I had a ""go to"" spot to get my Korean food fix. When I heard that the owners of Soyo were starting up a Korean BBQ place, I was excited! I tried Goong out yesterday and was not disappointed. First off, the ambiance and décor is very trendy & modern but with a traditional Korean twist. The interior designer they chose did a very nice job. Looking at the menu, we were initially overwhelmed with the meat choices, but the staff did a great job of explaining the menu and making recommendations. We went with the beef combination that came with steamed egg, doenjang soup, and a variety of different cuts of beef including Wagyu prime ribeye! I was most impressed with the ""Chadol-baegi"" or thin sliced brisket as this is the meat that is commonly bad in Las Vegas. Most Korean BBQ places in Vegas will use a very tough cut with no fat and it tastes horrible. Goong used the proper selection of meat, just as you'd find in Ktown, LA. The assortment of side dishes (""Banchan"") that came out was also all very good and was really on par with the food you would get in Ktown, LA. The amount of food was a lot for the two of us, and the price was pretty reasonable considering that this is an upscale Korean BBQ spot, and not some dirty, dingy, place serving low grade cuts of meat. All in all, it was an excellent dining experience and I would highly recommend this place!

3127940,2016-07-31,1,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"I have tried the better known Korean restaurants in NY, LA, SF and Chicago and was never really impressed (they all used too much MSG and other flavor enhancers to mask their skill insecurity), so I only ate when in Seoul at the better places during business trips. However, as unlikely as it may seem, a gem of a Korean restaurant with the highest culinary skills and ingredients has emerged out of all places - in Las Vegas. I was so glad to find this place that I wrote to my friends abroad to try this place when visiting.

Yes, it is pricey relative to ""other"" Korean places but I actually would like to compare this place to American steak houses (those serving Prime meats). Then, the price is actually quite reasonable.

The side dishes are well made rendering their innate flavors without being overpowered with spices. The meats are high quality and the setting including the decor is elegant and minimalist. The restroom is very clean, too. The service is not intrusive, on purpose I think, to give customers some privacy...but will respond quickly if needed.

Our server was extremely helpful in explaining the menu though, so it's not a big deal. We had floor seating where you take off your shoes. Comfy cushions and it's not difficult to get in or out of the tables. 

We ordered the wagyu beef platter. It's supposed to be for 2-3 people, but I would say it could feed more like 4. The platter came with a ton of different sides: kimchi, onion salad, green salad, black beans, squid, seafood pancake, tiny little pancake that had jalapeños, radish, eggplants, soup, and more that I can't recall. Then there was the beef with a large variety of cuts. Two types of seasoning to use and the usual soy sauce to accompany the food. We also had Korean wine, which was so tasty! 

Service was amazing. They helped us cook our food as needed, and we're generally amazing. The manager came to talk with us after our meal, which I thought was so great. The the price was amazing.

I have been here a few times and I can say Goong definitely has the best quality of any of the Korean BBQ restaurants I've been to in town.  They always have a nice variety of side dishes and their entrees are reasonably priced.  They have a few platters for parties of 2-3 or more which are great.  I especially enjoy the Beef Platter.  It's $65 and servers 2-3 people.  They have a pork one as well which is $45.  

The downfall to this restaurant and for my experience is the aggressiveness of the servers.  Each time I've been here with my Korean friend the servers will rip the utensil out of her hand when she is flipping the meat.  At any other restaurant they let you cook it however one time when we came here the server even said something as she was clearly upset that he kept taking the tongs from her.  Today we had only been seated for a few minutes and we were asked 3 times if we were ready to order.  We clearly were not.

Upon entering the restaraunt we were greeted with a warm ""ann-yeong-hasayo,"" Hello in Korean and slight bow. First impression was the formality of the staff and the ambience of the restaraunt. It was very modern and classy compared to other Korean restaraunts in the valley. Seating arrangement was a cool aspect of Goong, allowing you to enjoy a meal on the floor with more of a traditional flare or the option of being seated at regular table. Our server for the evening was, Jun. He was very friendly and knowledgeable with the menu. His service left a lasting impression on us. If you ever get the chance to try this place out. I reccomend him as a server. 

Now on to the food, this is was something we were not accustomed to since most of our experience with Korean BBQ is usually AYCE, with the exception of Hobak which is why I haven't got around to writing a review for Hobak yet. The reason is because I wanted to compare 2 of the most popular Korean BBQ restaraunts in Vegas. 

We opted for the Beef Platter which was good for 2-3ppl. From the very first pieces to the end was simply delicious. The quality of each meat was seasoned just right especially the Bulgogi. However I really enjoy the Prime Flat Iron and Prime Rib Eye. Those cuts of meat were juicy and flavorful especially when paired with the dipping sauce that was provided. The variety of banchan(side dishes) were fresh and delicious. We also got the Kimchi Fried Rice and that was very good with a perfect balance of spices and heat.

Then they changed the grill for our bulgogi and a lot of that got stuck on the grill. Maybe they need to grease it a little?

Wagyu Short Plate (Wagyu Kalbi) $11

The southwest is blowing up big time.  Goong Korean BBQ is a great alternative to Chinatown's busy KBBQ joints.  The food at Goong KBBQ is fabulous and there's never a wait.  All meats are cooked by the staff (not you) and everything is awesome.  Their marinated sliced rib eye, prime brisket, and the Wagyu top sirloin ranks as my favorites.

4055457,2018-03-03,2,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Very solid Korean BBQ. My only standard is Hobak, because I'm new to the K BBQ scene and I'm not sure it's fair to compare the two but life's not fair.  The food was great.  We shared the Goong Special Platter - Waygu everything, short ribs, shrimp.  Incredibly tender but not pre-marinated so not as flavorful as I like.  Unlike Hobak, Goong seems to focus more on the sides (13 in total) and less on the meat.  I'm typically looking for the meat sweats when I have Korean BBQ.  

Service was attentive, if not overly friendly. My only real complaint is that there is no ambiance. It's very antiseptic, like eating in a fluorescent-lit cafeteria.  We had a group of 7 and reserved a booth so we could have back support. If you don't wear orthotics, you might be interested in the cute little tables you sit around cross-legged and perhaps the ambiance is a little better over there.

So much to do for one person that I can understand his occasional frustration, but, geez, get yourself some help.  We had to try saving our prime and waygu meats from overcooking while he was busy at another table.  I dinged them one star for that, and I may have been generous.

4094840,2017-04-08,0,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Was about to go Soyo when I passed this place and it caught my eye. After reading the reviews of this place, it seemed like a legit place for some good KBBQ. I didn't have expectations that it will surpass Kang Hodong in LA, but was expecting at least close in par with Hobak here in town. The bonchon was superb, they brought over 16 different items, and all of them more or less is very good. No complaints there. But unfortunately, that was actually the highlights of my time here.

We got the beef combo, which consist of 5 plates of meat. Each plate has a small amount, but the quantity even though not as much as Hobak, is more than enough for 2 and perhaps decent enough for even 3. The meat themselves all seemed high quality, they're all thinly sliced and looked fresh enough. However, it's not really about how good the meat is but it's how you cook it right? Out of my favorite places on the west coast, Kang Hodong in LA and Hobak in Vegas, they all cook for you, making sure you don't screw up the beautiful meat in the process. This place claimed to cook for you when I sat down, but they seem to leave for a long time after putting down the meat, and by the time they come back, the meat is already over cooked. It's not like it was crowded when I got there, there was only 1 other table at the time. I asked for medium rare, and the 1st 3 plates were all medium well to well done, which just in my experience ruin the reason to eat KBBQ. 

Also, unlike most other KBBQ places, this place use unmarinated meats. Most places I've had unmarinated meats have to be absolutely superb to pull it off. I went to this place in Matsuzakagyu Yakiniku M in Osaka, and they pulled it off perfectly. I don't think you can pull unmarinated meats unless you have the perfect meats, otherwise you should just stick to marinated meats. Hobak does not pretend that they have the perfect meats, and even with imperfect meats they manage to pull off amazing tastes. They also do better soybean paste soup and the steamed eggs. 

From the decor of this place, which mind you is VERY well done, to the unmarinated meats, to the service, I feel like this establishment is pretending to be something it's not. There's nothing that stands out either completely great or completely terrible about this place. However, I've definitely spent less money at other places for a more enjoyable KBBQ meal. It's a shame that my first experience wasn't a more satisfactory one, but I was certainly hoping it to surprise me. Perhaps my expectations were too high.",1Rrbrr16vEI9fGhYKOVOGQ,3,0,3,W-4rnoKcUByDTHDCKuGx6w

4106828,2018-03-12,3,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Las Vegas has seemingly always had buffets, and the norm for Korean BBQ has similarly been all you can eat. Fortunately, we now have multiple high-quality, non-AYCE KBBQ options including this one.

Goong Korean BBQ Restaurant is one of perhaps a triumvirate of (relatively) pricey, premium meat restaurants. Normally, I write about other businesses vaguely, but I'm going to refer to other restaurants by name, especially because I intend to draw some comparisons/contrasts with one of them in particular: Hobak. I have eaten there multiple times. I have not yet tried 8 Oz, the newest kid on the block. I have also eaten at Magal, which I consider to be a lower tier option and which i've only tried once, so I won't talk about them.

Perhaps the best part of the visit was how we were seated immediately at around 6:15pm on a Sunday night. Hobak always seems to have a long wait. The interior here is welcoming and feels more ""traditional"" in a way than that faux-street feel at Hobak. I also like the lantern-esque light covers with red and blue colors seemingly lifted straight from South Korea's flag. I'm told that those represent the ancient balancing forces of yin and yang.

Anyway, let's move on to the food. Rather than order a la carte, my two friends and I split a Marinated Meat Combination Platter ($65). We could've gone pricier, but we had a feeling that this would satiate our appetites, and it did. The meats did indeed all come marinated, but none of them tasted cheap - except perhaps the chicken, but nobody goes to KBBQ to eat chicken, right? Prime boneless short rib was highly marbled and easily tasted the best, but the thinly sliced rib eye, pork ribs, and pork outside skirt were delicious as well. Oh, and an employee cooked all of those for us. One difference from Hobak: no charcoal for added smoky flavor. Fortunately, I didn't miss that so much.

The combo comes with a steamed egg bowl and a choice of soup (one bowl). The steamed egg was as fluffy as hoped and was ideally salted. Our choice of soup was soft tofu (aka soondubu) and our protein choice for that was seafood. I can't remember tasting a cleaner broth in this type of soup before, which let the seafood flavors come out and play. The calamari was al dente but easily chewed apart, and the shrimp was cooked properly too. The tofu was soft. Surprisingly, this was my favorite soondubu in memory.

Side dishes were good if not great. I won't go all of through the banchan in detail because they were so numerous, but they all tasted fresh - y'know, crunchy when it was supposed to be and all that jazz. Seafood cakes (warmed on the grill) were quite good. The pink pickled daikon was surprisingly sweet. The japchae was great. The creamy dressing on the individual salads was not as heavy as anticipated.

Complimentary ""dessert"" was a cool (temperature-wise) bowl of cinnamon tea. It had some balanced sweetness and tasted like cinnamon, and it was surprisingly refreshing. (They do have options for ice cream and such if you're in the mood.)

Despite my initial concerns about cost, I'm glad that I finally heeded Desyree's advice (yes, that Desyree) and visited Goong. It impressed me with service, flavors, and relative affordability. I can't really pick a favorite between this and Hobak just yet, so if you haven't tried either of them, then try both.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,8,5,u4tKJQeHYP57Z5vOOg_fZQ
4118301,2016-06-19,2,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Wow! This is by far the best Korean bbq I've ever been to. It's very nice inside with a floor pillow seating, table seating and private rooms. The cold barley tea wasn't for me but the table next to us wondered where they could buy it. We ordered the beef platter $65 which is 6 courses of beef and we added the shrimp $12-15. Everything was amazing, even the many side dishes. Kimchi fried rice was spicy but a delicious platter. 

4 stars due to the service. We arrived at opening, 11:30 with a reservation. It was our first time in and we were the second family through the door. We weren't offered any menu suggestions or even drinks. I finally had to stand to get attention to order. My husband insisted we leave like another table had as it had been 20 minutes with still no service. I counted 8 tables, most with the same issue. As the huge family of 6 left the only server on the floor stared the family down. Quite rude and unprofessional in my opinion. 

We will be back but we do highly suggest that if your charging good money (our bill was $97 before tip) you don't cheapen the experience with no staff. The entire two hours we were there we received no refills and asked for extra side dishes that never came. Two tables for this environment should receive one server. Two people for the entire place is ridiculous.",XdLQep9R3V7EHwW2fjgK-g,2,2,4,EEH_fZjNHB_gHc36a06Quw

The side dishes, common with Korean food, was simply phenomenal. They served about 15 and literally covered our entire table. You also get a soup of choice. The meat choices were amazing! Flat iron steak, pork belly, thin brisket, etc, were all so tender and delicious that you forget about it not being all u can eat and delight in the high quality and service.

They use 2 different grills depending in how the meat is seasoned. Definitely like the array of quality meats they have here - I ordered the Beef & Pork Platter - and I'm in love with their brisket! I am usually not impressed with pork belly in most kbbq places, but Goong surprisingly had theirs rather juicy and moist without seasoning. Service is definitely on point, most of the servers were generally male and cooked all the meat in a prompt and proper fashion. It was a nice touch having green tea salt as one of the seasonings, I really liked that as I am a fan of anything green tea lol. My friend also noticed that they were playing instrumentals from the Spirited Away soundtrack in the background, which really made my night as it gave a nice bonus to the neutral but grounded ambiance they had at Goong. :) Will definitely come again with friends and family!

This is not an AYCE location which is new for me since I'm used to NYC Korean bbq locations to be almost buffet style.  I been to Gen here in Vegas and it wasn't that impressive.
This fufu-modern Jap-Korean bbq spot is the bomb.  The chic layout is definitely a plus as you walk in.   They have benches with cute pillows you can relax on Japanese style or you can ask for the a nice booth seating.  They wait staff are very attentive and super nice.  I love how they cook for you to ensure meat is not overcooked.  We ordered the beef bbq platter (it looks small but it's a lot), Pork belly, sirloin and green tea and strawberry ice cream mochi.  The barrage of side dishes was a lot and they even gave three rice bowls.  I didnt think it was a lot but for $133 it was a steal.  They even offered a cinnamon green tea sweet drink on the house.  The experience was fun especially the clubby music they were playing but not that loud that you had to scream at each other.  The lighting was bright that you didn't have to squint while searching for cooked meat.  The meat was fresh and clean.  Nothing looked old or marinated to the point that you couldn't tell if the meat was fresh.  Overall it was a great filling experience.  I would highly recommend this place to any foodie.  Be forewarned it is still a Korean bbq spot.  So don't wear your nice clothes that you don't want to smell like meat for weeks.  I don't just endorse spots for freebies.  So come down to this beautiful strip of stores and eat S Rainbows legit good eats.

Decor and ambiance is amazing.  You have the option of the common tables with grills, floor seats where you have to off your shoes, and a separate area for larger groups.

In terms of the service, they were very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive to our needs.  We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering.  

Menu has a wide variety of options.  Lunch was available (until 4pm) when we came in but we wanted to try one of the platters.  We ordered the beef platter and terms of the quantity it was more than enough for 3 people.  My favorite cuts were prime rib eye and marinated rib eye.  It also came with tons of sides which probably were the best I have ever had. 

Parking might be an issue especially on a weekend because of the amount of spaces and restaurants located in the vicinity.  But if you go early I doubt it would be a problem.

Although it was tender and juicy, it was too thin and had too much fat on it. I prefer hobak's pork jowl. Loved how much banchan they had. Mul nengmyeon was a bigg portion.

When we got the table, it wasn't setup.  So they just had us wait for 10 minutes and then wait again for our table to setup while we were there.

5094705,2016-07-10,25,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Good food.  Great decor.  Comedy free of charge.

Comedy first.  Platform seating.  Shoes off, lots of bending required.  Guys, including my two Asian poker buds wearing glorified denim pantyhose AKA skinny jeans.  Just imagine a giraffe trying to sit and you get the picture.  (There are regular tables but what's the fun of that?)

Swanky.   The easiest way to describe the ambiance and what sets this KBBQ joint apart from its competitors.  From glass cases showcasing their beef to thick cut, glistening pink, raw cuts being presented on synthetic black stone slabs.  The design focuses all the attention on the food you're about to cook.

IMPORTANT, Goong advertises two types of beef, Wagyu and Prime.  To avoid disappointment understand Wagyu is a breed of cow not an indicator of quality.  The wagyu breed It is characterized by sweet flesh capable of achieving extremely fine marbling.  ""Prime"" denotes USDA prime and DOES reflect the marbling regardless of the breed.   Not all Wagyu is USDA Prime or higher.  Choose your cut based on the flavor you want to enjoy.

Tip:  Opt for a set.  Sets include all the banchan (including a salad), steamed egg, a choice of soup for the table and a good cross selection of their proteins.  Add additional proteins ala carte if you think you need more food.  A few mushrooms are provided for grilling.  No additional veg.

Standard KBBQ cuts.  Beef cut thicker than most places the quality very good (USDA choice or higher).  Pork has a good amount of fat that crisps up nicely.  Marinades tend to be on the sweet side.  Regardless of set, be sure to order some pork jowl.  Sweet, porky goodness.   Beef lovers, it's all about the wagyu short plate.  Lots of internal fat.  Sweet beefy goodness.

Unlike most KBBQ places, you are in full control of your grill.  Servers will offer to help to start you off but thereafter, it's all you.

Now the food here is really good from service to quality.the meat is cut to order by their in house butchers that you can watch if you want. My wife and I usually the Wagyu package and we'll add some kalbi as well. 

The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is the portion to price. I love eating here but I feel like I'm not getting enough portion of meat for the price.

Not one for all-you-can-eat restaurants, especially the sort where ""cooking your own food"" is considered the norm, it was with hopes of dispelling such misconceptions that a seat was taken at Goong Korean BBQ on South Rainbow, two friends with far more experience at such places providing great conversation and a whole lot of education during the meal's nearly-two hour span.

Considered to be one of the city's more authentic experiences, shoes removed and decorative-pads provided for seating at one of several gas-fired grilltops, those arriving at Goong during lunch hours are likely to be struck by the tranquility of a space devoid of televisions or elaborate decorations, the clean lines complimented by a light soundtrack as servers provide menus and beverages while speaking in hushed tones.

Offering several lunch specials alongside the dinner menu, a la carte Meats as well as party-sized Combos offered alongside a variety of Soups and Rice plates, it was with both Korean and English descriptions that choices spread across several pages, the ordering deferred to others with some input as to a Rice Cake Soup and Pork Jowls that sounded particularly interesting.

Partially familiar with the format, a plethora of small bowls and plates quickly flooding the table prior to the first Meat selection, it was with small bites tasted of each Banchan that the palate was prepared for the flavors to follow, the Fish Cakes and Spicy Eggplant particularly memorable as makeshift appetizers while choices like the pickled Daikon, Onions and Soy Noodles were better utilized with the Proteins, or at least as palate cleansers between bites.

Turning focus now to the grill, a total of three Meats ordered with a second helping of Galbi proving far superior to the sinewy first round, those making their first visit to Goong would be well advised to order at least one plate of the thinly-sliced Chadolbagi that cooks through in under two-minutes as well as a Pork plate, the glass cases in back proudly displaying the sort of quality worth paying for as each is sliced to order in a nothing-to-hide way.

Not one for really hot stuff, even Goong's Kimchee a bit too heated if not taken with some rice, additional plates tasted included the Cold Buckwheat Noodle Salad served with Soy and lava-red Sauce as well as the comforting Dolsot Bibimbap, a large bowl of Tteok Manduguk presented last with Salt and Pepper by a server who all but admitted gauging his table's ""whiteness"" even though the overstuffed Dumplings in Beef Stock were already savory enough.

***  An enjoyable meal as much for the company as for the food, Goong Korean BBQ proved a nice introduction to a new genre, though the service did feel slightly judgmental throughout the course of the afternoon while prices trend higher than would be anticipated for several of the dinner Rice Bowls, Soups and Casseroles.  Also, Mochi is not dessert...",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,3,1g1uZiOhSNxpDd6_1AL_5Q

I eat for 2 people all the time anyway so, the platter options were perfect. Our tables was covered in small plates of ban chan: kim chee, squid, potato salad, chives, salad, noodles, fish cakes, pickled radish, broccoli, carrots, and other veggies.

Beef Platter:
Prime rib eye, wagyu top sirloin, prime chuck flat, prime flat iron, thinly sliced prime brisket, and marinated thinly sliced rib eye. It also comes with mushrooms. The cuts of beef were tender. They'll give you a side of sauce and two kinds of salt so you can flavor your meats accordingly to your own preference. It's a lot of food.

The smaller set can feed 2-3 people (or 3-4 females because of the sheer amount of side dishes). The larger set can feed about 4 to 5 people. 

I think the only difference is whether your party is super hungry or is looking for quality. All you can eat won't have the best quality but it's a great option if you want to try different types of meat and Korean marinates.

There was a choice between sitting at a booth or korean style seating. We decided to go with the Korean style where you have to take off your shoes and sit on a large blue pillow.

1. Food: Decided to go with the prime rib eye, beef tongue, and thinly sliced brisket - all of which was delicious. The way the meat is presented has to be the best I've seen in a Korean BBQ place. Banchan (side dishes) consisted of 14 dishes. Instead of water, they provide barley tea - loved it! The meat can be small in portions and on the expensive side, however the quality is makes up for it. In the middle of the restaurant there's even a little window where you can see the butchers cut and plate the meat.

2. Service: Everyone had all black uniforms, which makes the place look professional - then I noticed they were wearing croc style shoes which I thought were no bueno. LOL
 The servers were very attentive and always checked up on us. They even cook the food for you, but sometimes I would prefer to cook it myself. They were very polite and got whatever I asked for in a timely manner. Every plate of banchan was explained to us, and they also asked which meat we wanted to eat next. 

3. Ambiance: The decor in there is very charming. There are sculptures, golden masks on the wall, photographs, and mirrors. There are a lot of little details around the restaurant that shows they care about appearance. The music in there wasn't too loud or too quiet, but we weren't able to hear it once more people started coming in.

If you have a large group and want to eat in this area, call ahead or just don't bother going. NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY",aQIbgTzn2YN_B18oKeXRdA,0,0,1,ueByGadpF75S3B9yTx0dBg

5529283,2016-05-19,83,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Restaurants all over the place throw around the words ""wagyu"" and ""Kobe"" these days and it confuses consumers.  It gives the false idea that some rural farmer in Japan prepared this majestic, gently massaged, beer-fed cow specifically for their plate.  Because of the lack of uniform rules on beef labeling, this happens regularly with zero repercussions to them.  They can say anything they want!  You think video poker bars in Vegas really have authentic wagyu beef in the form of sliders ready to be served at 2am for $10?  It's a name that catches the eye and allows them to charge more.  Just like ""super white tuna"".  

American tastes have come a long way from when lean meats were king.  They currently take a backseat to pork belly, the ""more white than red"" beef and even chicken thigh.  I didn't ask about the origins of Goong's product, or if they had any concrete proof that it was truly wagyu, but their quality is clearly a step above the standard Vegas KBBQ and that makes it worth going to in my book.  

To shorten time perusing the menu for our party of 5, the Goong special at $145 was the easiest way to sample it all.  This included a nice selection from pork jowl to prime flat iron to wagyu top sirloin.  The ribeye and short rib were my personal favorites and met all my criteria for great grilled beef, which is FJT (fatty, juicy, tender).  I enjoy a little blood, so no piece stayed on the grill for long.

I am normally not very sensitive about service (perhaps all those Chinese restaurants I went to growing up dulled my senses), but the rushed, stop-go service left something to be desired.  I'd prefer the servers either put the meat on the grill and see it through to its completion, or leave us alone to do it all.  There was one point where a gentleman placed a nice looking piece over the fire, asked my friend if she liked her beef cooked ""medium"", she responded ""yes"" and then he proceeded to walk away from the table!  What did that mean? Was he coming back to flip it or leaving that up to us?  Should we just put more on the grill when we're done?  They make such an effort to present the meat so royally with the thick, uniform, labeled cuts in a classy and quiet dining atmosphere; it's a shame that this was the problem.  They were also more reactive than proactive when it came to refilling banchan as we always had to ask about getting something instead of them noticing the empty bowl and asking if we wanted more.  That's all fixable though.      

Constantly losing track of which cuts were being eaten, which I blame on attempting to be social (ha), made some of the meat feel a little less special.  ""Wait.  What cut is this again?"" was said numerous times.  Maybe I need flashing lights that say the name of the meat.  Regardless, I'll be back here to satisfy my fix of good marbled beef. 3.6511111 stars.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,127,104,4,EezXgYPKJ21s-G8cIv0w7w
5532448,2016-06-25,1,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"First Impression: I've been waiting for this place to open after driving by its fancy exterior signage many times. With all the KBBQ restaurants in town, this one definitely stole the spotlight. I finally got the chance to try this place and upon entering, I was fascinated by their interior design from the layout to the decorations of sculptures, mirrored vents, high ceiling and etc. My friend and I came here for dinner around 7pm and there were a plenty of seating available. We had the option of sitting at a booth OR, the traditional Korean seating where you take off your shoes and sit on these large blue pillows. Of course we went with the traditional way to get the full experience!

Food: We weren't super hungry so we decided to order a la carte but they do have party platters recommended for the size of your group. We ordered the prime rib eye, beef tongue (x3) and thinly sliced brisket (x2). They serve 14 banchans (side dishes) naming each one as its being served and barley tea instead of water that is light with a hint of roasty flavor. I would drink this over water any day because it's so refreshing! Your dipping choices are green tea salt (my favorite out of the 3 and super delicious paired with meat), regular salt with pepper and a dark sauce. Some of the meat is served on a black slate which adds a unique touch. The meat portion is quite small and the price is on the pricier side but seeing the quality, color and cut of the meat is definitely worth it!

Service: Everyone was super friendly and attentive. The servers were patient and cook for you all the way through for each meat which was nice. Sometimes I just prefer to cook it myself so I can eat and chat since having them cook in between us gets kind of awkward. One thing to point out is that they don't serve us individual plates. After the meat was cooked, they move it to the side of the grill and we had no plates to hold the meat except eating off of the grill. There was also no napkins to be found. We were always checked up on except it gradually slowed when the dining area got busier which was understandable. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here at Goong. It is a nice place to take friends and family to for the finer dining KBBQ experience than the typical places around Chinatown. I will come back and order the party platters next time to try out all the different kinds of meat they offer!",gF1XjTQ2yiSJe28o60gozQ,3,2,5,arXg8-z_LBfZ55CDGXjF-w

5592613,2018-05-19,1,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"This place had a 4.5 star average, when Honey Pig elsewhere in town only has 3 stars, so I decided to give it a try--a horrible decision.

Upon sitting down, I overheard other customers speaking in Japanese, which gave me high hopes. I read through the menu, which had English/Romanized text, Hangul, Japanese, and ...I believe Cantonese. It may have been Simplified Chinese but I cannot remember. One section of the menu... perhaps the standard Barbecue section... had one sentence explanations of the order in English. A different section, the Marinated Barbecue section, had one line explanations in Hangul. This inconsistency troubled me.

Before we decided on our order, the busman who seemed very happy with his job was cleaning the table opposite ours. Each platter he emptied out and replaced in his cart produced a loud, obnoxious clunk. Perhaps this means the hardware is of good quality.

We attempted to order lunch specials, but because we were dining on Sunday afternoon, we could not order the Monday through Friday lunch specials. Instead, we ordered the beef short rib (kalbi) and bulgogi from the normal menu.

Because Goong is a normal Korean BBQ restaurant without an all you can eat menu, comparing volume is USUALLY out of the question. However, this only holds true when the a la carte location provides quality tiers above the smorgasbord option.

The appetizers came in plenty, as I expected. However, I did not expect to receive five different types of radishes, accounting for more than half the plates. My sub claims the kimchi was good. I dislike chili so I didn't try it. We agreed despite coming in spicy, shaved, sour, pickled, and grated varieties, the different forms of radish did not fulfill our appetizer demands. The remaining appetizers included spicy toufu, sesame oil noodle (I forget the name,) salt and pepper salad, and some kind of mashed potatoes. I expected something including fish or egg, but nothing of the sort arrived.

The white rice came in a small bowl. I remembered seeing ""Extra Rice ... 2"" on the menu, and my heart sinking at the thought. The meat also came in small, but reasonable amounts. You are paying about eight or nine times as much for the meat here as you are at the supermarkets down the street, but they marinated it for you and included a lot of appet...radish. They will also turn the grill on for you, place the meat on it for you, and repeatedly come to turn the meats over and cut it into bite size pieces for you, even if you have gigantic mouths and prefer five times the bite size they cut, like me. They will turn the grill off for you before the meat is well done.

The bulgogi was ... bulgogi. The marinade was fairly weak, but tastable. The meat quality was good, a little bit better than Honey Pig. The kalbi was an interesting cut--unlike the multi-bone with bone fragment hell you get any other place you order kalbi, it was one rib, and the slices of meat above it. The marinade was ... almost absent, but I THINK it was marinated in something. Perhaps it was just the remaining drip from the bulgogi, I am not sure.

At this stage of the meal, we were slowly becoming radish, when I ran out of rice. My heart sank as it remembered the number two and my eyes tried to justify its connection to the small bowl of rice, but luckily the radish across from me let me have the remaining rice. With it, I managed to finish off the meats to perfect my meat-radish balance.

In the end, there is no reason not to drive the extra miles to go to Honey Pig and eat slightly lower quality food (with better selection and, last I checked, 24 hour operation) and get more satisfaction for your pennies.  I will next try Doh down the street, no matter what Yelp says about it.

We paid the check, and on the way out I greeted the hostess with a prominent and thankful ""Xiexie!"" and left, never to return.",ndMHThI6lIqDMdCSpuyPcw,2,1,2,JyiuzZJJt5ZdtjfohuZm5Q

One of the waiters slid my phone off the menu and walked away. They move everything to be able to reach the meats in the most careless manner. The meats kept falling off the grill and they would just put them right back on. I would recommend to train their waiters better manners or just simply stop having them cook the meats for you because they obviously cannot seem to get that right.",fa7Z7ZOAdhjyFg_kdpNcLQ,1,0,2,ICDds1LIh0VFqBPznf9CXA

The platter also came with a LOAD of sides, you can probably get full of them, but we paced ourselves to ensure we would be able to try everything. 

Needless to say, everything was delicious! The quality of the meats were great! We ate our meal by each type of meat in order to appreciate each type of meat. Halfway through the meal, the grill was changed to cook the brisket and ribeye. 

The staff top to bottom was great! There was always a different staff member serving our food, offering to cut or grill the meats, or accommodating any of our other requests. There was no one that gave us a bad experience.

5758911,2016-04-07,2,SEMvJDVnDB4NoPW6tXXO_Q,"Take away:
A place you'll share with friends. 

1. Ambiance:
I always start how a place makes me feel when I walk in and the first thing you'll notice is that it's beautiful. Rainbow Blvd has become Vegas' hotspot for Asian concepts and Goong has set a new bar. If you're from Vegas, you've come to accept the mini-mall as our neighborhood landscape. Used to be that when you have relatives or friends visit, you'd bring them to the Strip. Seriously, options have swung open. You can tell design is important to Goong--I'll take my wife to a date, co-workers for lunch, even client meetings and won't be embarrassed. It's buttoned up, these guys are good. Check out the details, there's a lot of great nuances from signage, photographs, sculptures, mirrors...

2. Food: 
There were 4 adults with us, and ordered the Goong Special ($145) which had so much good stuff with 9 meat items and plethora of wholesome side dishes. We had smiles and waving white flags after the meal. It just tasted so fresh. If you're gonna just have one thing, get the PRIME SHORT RIB (wow). Take a walk down the middle of the restaurant, you'll see the butcher actually slicing the meats. The quality is unlike any other Korean place in Vegas--even have the meat displayed and labeled--very proud to show you how fresh the meat looks. On the display when I was there was Rib Eye, Top Sirloin, and Chuck Flat--all of them Wagyu.

3. Service: 
Servers looked very smart with black unis. Just enough attention and polite when you ask them for things. One of my pet peeves is timing as in when plates need to be removed (hate having empty plates just meandering) and given this is a Korean restaurant with countless of plates on the table, they did a good job. 

----------------------------------------------

Listen up restauranteurs wanting to enter Rainbow Blvd--Goong should be your model as it challenges what a restaurant in ""local"" Vegas should be. You seriously can turn your place to something the community can be proud of and as Goong is in mine, they'll be seeing me a lot.",-YLiMJ0xeWxqny9O9YKzoA,8,4,5,9VwX_GYtiO1YwC4krx89JA

The girl server was very nice and attentive. She asked us which meat we would prefer to grill first and let us eat at our own pace.
