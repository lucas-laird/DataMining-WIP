This was my first stay at Palazzo and I thought it was great that there was a restaurant right by the pool.

I wanted to eat on the light and healthy side so I ordered their yogurt parfait (housemade granola parfait with yogurt and fresh berries).  Ok, so I was wrong that this item would be healthy.  They used vanilla yogurt which was sweet (I'm accustomed to using plain yogurt when it comes to mixing it w/ granola and fruit) and sweetened granola.  It was topped with various berries (blueberry, blackberry, raspberry).  Yeah, it was might tasty but not really healthy because of the sugar content.  

 He ordered the two egg breakfast which comprised of organic eggs (prepared to your liking), smoked  ham, and country potatoes..with a side of English muffin.  Is it just me or what...but don't English muffins typically get toasted?  Anyway, his order arrives and his English muffins were pale; skimpy on the country potatoes (looked like one small potato cut in half and then another 1/2 of a potato.  According to him, the English muffin was toasted...but I guess it was on the super light side.  Proper toasting probably was an extra fee.  Total bill before tax and tip:  $33.

I don't think I'd have breakfast here again...there are so many restaurants in Vegas to try for that.",eRV6uavzjtvLj7Aej59QVg,2,1,3,O0Ig_P6wFYeVuPuTn6jRjQ

It's a Wolfgang Puck restaurant at the Palazzo so I'm not expecting it to be cheap but $18 for a spicy tuna roll seemed just a *tad* expensive. Then $10 for three small pieces of salmon nigiri. Hmmmmm. Ok. Still, everything was very fresh and tasty so I won't hold it against them THAT much. My friends' portions seemed like much better deals. The Chinois Salad, Burger and Fish Tacos were all very large and cheaper. Oh well, I was craving sushi like none other so that's my fault. The burger was ordered rare and it came out medium well. If that had been my burger I would have been very annoyed. I like my meat bloody.

The food was good but nothing special stands out.

I also liked the toppings that came on it (avocado, sundried tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts) as opposed to just lettuce and tomato. My friends got pizzas and burgers and they all enjoyed it.

We ordered a total of 4 items: hot wings, side salad, mushroom and onion pizza, and a burger.

They did not put the wings in as an appetizer so instead of having them to dine on while we waited for the main meal, they came out with the meal which was a huge bummer! We ordered the burger rare, and it came out fully cooked! Not even a little pink in it at all! If a place like this can't make a burger to order then they shouldn't charge $18 for it! 

The pizza was cold and the cheese was already solid by the time it made it to the table! I felt so bad for my friend, but she was starving at this point in time and did not want to wait for another one. 

The saving grace of the meal was the hot wings! They were pretty amazing! However they come plain with a dipping sauce on the side that kinda...well...sucks! We asked for some ranch, but a nice tangy buffalo or some sort of Asian dipping sauce would have been nice!

They were good... not the best I've had but tasty and sat outside poolside.  My friend had the Chicken Caesar salad, which she said was pretty dry overall... not enough dressing... had to get two more sides of dressing and the chicken was grilled to death and quite dry.  Taco's don't come with any side.  You get 3 with an order.  Got a side of fries for $5... although they were pretty good fries, the huge bowl was way too much for 1 person.  Here's an idea... why not make the side an actual side and not charge $5 for them.  Oh, salsa was pretty tasted they served with the taco's.  A little bite but not too much where your mouth is on fire. The iced teas are delicious.  They are unsweetened tea but they add fruit puree.  We had peach and rasberry.  Delicious but the rasberry was kinda sweeet for my taste.  We added water and mixed them together... wha la!

We ordered the margherita pizza, mushroom pizza, chinese chicken salad, and ahi tuna salad.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed about the margherita pizza...despite having a wood-fired oven, the dough was thick, a bit mushy and lacking the crispness I expect in this type of pizza.  The Wolfgang Puck Express at the mall in SF does a better job I think.  The mushroom pizza was a little better, and the salads were actually pretty good.  None of this is mind-blowing cuisine (after all, what do you expect from a poolside restaurant?), but it fit the bill and we were satisfied without having to be wheeled off the property.  

As far as ""healthy"" options go, I would probably still pick this over the Canyon Ranch place.  At least we get to lounge outdoors by the pool, and we even saw Kelsey Grammer!  Not a bad choice for our final meal on our Vegas getaway.",R5i-8R4vBov0wfNBGg2MwA,1,0,3,JePMPhaIqeqUD-hGXxsdKA

My first visit was with our large group of about 18. Our wait was brief, while the hostess & busboys slid together tables & chairs. Unfortunately, we weren't able to sit all at one table, but that was fine. The servers for both tables seemed a bit overwhelmed at first, but eventually they were caught up with our drinks & food orders - they were very attentive the whole time. 

My second visit was with a couple... 3 of us total. No wait at all, and our server was very present, as well. He even filled up my outside water bottle for me. My friends also ordered what they'd enjoyed on our prior visit, and were not disappointed this time, either. 

Prices seemed high (my salad was $22), but this IS Vegas, and my company was paying. I also noticed they have a takeout window for sunbathers. But, with the 115° temps we had in Vegas that week, idk why anyone would want to eat in the blazing sun, when Solaro offers covered seating with fans & misters (only time I appreciated that *dry heat* - the covered shade was almost bearable).

My boyfriend and I split the breakfast burrito and a side of potatoes. We're both originally from New Mexico and we were very impressed with the smooth guacamole and delicious pico de gallo that was included with it. I wouldn't be surprised eating something that tastes similar to this plate in Santa Fe--so if you're looking for Mexican flavor this is the way to go!
