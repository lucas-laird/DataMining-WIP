971317,2014-07-01,0,ueko6OhJaHNDy1Ynfrb3vw,"I was staying in the hotel so I decide to come to the food court to grab a quick bit after my flight. I walked around the food court and this place caught my eye since I haven't seen it in the city before. There wasn't a line so I thought it would be fairly quick since I saw three people working in the food area. I guess they do take their time making your meal because it took me awhile to get my food. I only ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and the meal with tender and fries. I like that there's dipping sauce for the tenders, rand or bbq and I got both. I was looking forward to the sandwich because I was really hungry and it looked pretty good on the picture.  Needles to say the sandwich was a letdown, the bun was cold and there was just a piece of tomato with the chicken.  It also felt dry. From the appearance it looked massive so it got my excited but once it bit into it it felt like I was just eating bread so it wasn't worth the price. On the other hand I really like the chicken tenders and fries. The chicken was juicy and the amount of food was adequate. The fries were pretty good. I'm not sure what type of seasoning they used but it was tasty. There was also a sweet taste to it which I don't mind. 

If I'm in the area I would just go for their tenders and skip the sandwiches because it looks nothing like the picture.  This place is pricey but hey it's Vegas everything is pricey here.",5EimLtrB-oYKiV2tfF6Q2g,0,0,3,d5I82U_JGOP89D8WIDsTnA

The chicken is not bad: it is very moist on the inside. They do, however, sacrifice the crispiness on the outside to ensure that the inside is not dry. 

All in all, a good quick place for a quick bite.

Best advice: SKIP THE MASHED POTATOES as a side. Not sure what kind of gravy they use but it was worse than store-bought/reheated gravy.",W29EqcMVRhr4IN_xDRWK-A,0,0,3,dIm1g6evkP8Q5cUKor3smw

1839528,2016-11-17,0,ueko6OhJaHNDy1Ynfrb3vw,"Fried chicken never tasted... so bland?

The selling point here is that they make good chicken. Now, up until the age of 14 I had dino chicken nuggets at every restaurant, so I think you could say I'm a connoisseur by now.

These little guys did not hit the spot. The breading of the chicken was soggy and the chicken did not taste fresh (I went at around 1 PM, so maybe that had an effect on the quality?) I was really excited to try the southwestern-style sauce - I forget what they called it - and I was so underwhelmed. It didn't taste like anything and only ensured that the chicken got even soggier.

Maybe the mac n' cheese would save the day. Nope! It's got a little ham in it, for the record. Very tasteless and mushy. The caesar salad I got as another side had browning lettuce in it. 

Now if they started making dino chicken nuggets, I might consider returning. But in all likelihood, I'll try something else next time.",DnZz6sIsYeQvzJ_x5xyIWw,5,1,2,2hzCZb3m7NNPfWVONfl27g

You got 2 enormous waffles and 3 thick chicken strips for $12.99.  The chicken was breast pieces and was clearly not formed.  The breading is crispy but not greasy or overly thick.  While the chicken was great with the waffles, I preferred it more with the spicy grandma sauce.  I don't know what's in this stuff, but I wish they would bottle and sell it so I can put it on everything.  Highly recommended, and although the price is high, you got a lot of food for the money.

I got a chicken combo plate. The tenders were juicy and nicely crisp and the spicy creamy sauce went well with it. It came with two sides: fried rice which had a nice flavor, wasn't oily but fluffy and I got caesar salad which unfortunately had no dressing given and stale croutons. I wish I checked before leaving that my order was right.

The size of the tenders were positive, but the small cups made for mini sides. Stick with items like the rice that are dense as my salad was 5 slices of romaine and 3 croutons which ""filled"" it..

It's probably one of the better things to eat here, but because of the snafu with the side salad I would say it is A-OK.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,5,3,U9LQrsQApUq9lOIFQT4tfw

I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly! The employees do not look happy anymore, the quality of food has decreased, the friendly frequent visit card has disappeared, employee meals have increased from $5 to $6.49 with less on the plate. When management is questioned as to why the prices were raised. He states... I've done my homework. Well, so have I as well as a lot of other employees. The other food court options, give us 50% off on select dates without shrinking the portions, include certain percentages off for other dates, have bonus items, as well as value our business. 

The taste of the food is good at Chicken Now but raising prices and slashing quantity can only mean one thing..... Someone needs to do some true homework! 

I hope that when you visit Chicken Now you think about the other restaurants surrounding you and get what you pay for. Customer service is also KEY!",6I6DIjwiFEXfseDwToI4bA,4,0,1,1sv6jWZpo3HGltWrSsws_A
