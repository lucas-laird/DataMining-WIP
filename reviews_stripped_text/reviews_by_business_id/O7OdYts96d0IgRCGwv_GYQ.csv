Hidden gem. Excellent authentic Korean food.  Most of the tourists cannot even find it since it is not near the strip.  We order cold noodle soup (just for hot summer), seafood pancake, hot stone pot crispy rice, and spice beef soup.  Every dish turned out very nice.

Service was good but slow at best.

However, a couple of things: as I previously stated, this place is a hole in the wall. You can see the age from the rickety tables and outdated TVs. The lights are dark because probably the lightbulbs are dying out. You would agree the place needs a total makeover.

The Mae-oon tang (spicy soup? Not sure what it was called in English on the menu, oh and definitely share this one, it's big) and bibimbap in the stone pot is good. They have pork cutlet and you can't really go wrong with it. I actually enjoyed their fried dumplings too.

To be honest, I was on a hunt for KFC = Korean Fried Chicken...but I just can't pass up bipbimbap...so we had the stone pot version with an order of their ""KFC.""    

Our server, a lovely bilingual Korean woman, was surprised that I knew about banchan...and in seconds, out she came with a rolling cart (yes, there were that many), and began to set us up.  From potatoes with jalapenos, spinach bean curd pancakes, kimchee, sprouts, fishcake, seaweed and daikon, pickled radish - and more (there were at least 10) and they were all delicious.  

The dolsot (stonepot) bipbimbap is such a treat...perfect for this weather...the egg was fresh and the yolk was still runny.  The beef had tremendous flavor.  Add chili sauce, stir, mmmmm  

But then she brought out this ENORMOUS plate of chicken wings - with the bipbimbap, it's really more than 2 can eat, but we soldiered on...because...that's what we do...

but it needed one thing to make it all perfect - Hite!

So we shared a hite beer...and I've decided if I can get through the rest of the day without needing a nap, it will be a huge accomplishment.  

We also came to the conclusion that not only will we go back again but we'd help spread the word... and instantly this has moved up to our #1 lunch treat...

Don't expect to find Ma Dang on the door -- look at the reviewer's picture of the exterior -- see the word Garden?  That's what you need to look for -- it's down a few doors south from Birria Jalisco...

4513257,2011-01-23,5,O7OdYts96d0IgRCGwv_GYQ,"As far as hidden gems go, this is simply the most hidden, if that is possible. It's so hidden it couldn't even be found if you combined the ten best treasure hunters in the world and gave them all the tools they needed to find the damn gem. Fortunately for my friends, I am better than those ten treasure hunters and all I needed was my Blackberry. I'm simply the best at finding hidden gems. 

To be honest, my group wandered to Ma Dang on a rainy day haphazardly. We were aiming for a cheap restaurant after Las Vegas ate our wallets and my Yelp App on Blackberry led us 15 minutes away from the strip to Tokyo Japanese Restaurant. The reviews seemed all good despite a $20 taxi ride. Unfortunately for us, Tokyo Japanese Restaurant had closed down and Yelp had not changed the business status - shame on Yelp. While walking around, it was evident the economic turmoil had hit Vegas hard, especially for the restaurants off-strip. Every establishment was closed with crows and pigeons taking over the sidewalks. It felt like the scene from a Resident Evil movie and my friends seemed possessed with the same demonic affliction the zombies had as I felt their stone cold glares. I could telepathically read their minds, strings of ""where did you take us"", ""why am I wasting my time"" and ""I'm hungry"" lingered. Then there was finally a sign of relief just as emotions were about to boil over, as we saw a family walk into a nondescript blue door. We followed and meekly peeked in. An ahjima greeted us at the door and got us seated. We were nervous and skeptical of what they were going to feed us. Seriously, thoughts of them serving us human meat ran through my mind as the desolate mini-mall seemed incredibly ominous. 

The $10-$15 dishes were such a reprieve of the astronomical strip prices that we decided to pig out. However, we were cautious and ordered the typical Korean fare. Duk bok ki, Haemul Pajun, Soon Doobu Jigae, Dol Sot BiBimBap and Jap Chae. The ahjima also recommended the Spicy Chicken, noting tourists love the dish.  We ordered and we waited...

The dishes came out one by one. Huge portions, I mean absolutely worth the money we paid and a change of pace from the high-class, fancy restaurants on the strip. Each dish had a homemade feel to them and served in huge plates. The restaurant was also not cheap on the banchan and provided a table full of small appetizers. Our party of 5 undoubtedly over ordered, but it didn't matter to us as we were just happy to spend $20 each and be stuffed. There were no laggards and each dish was masterfully crafted as if I was over my Korean friend's house. However, the standout was truly the Spicy Chicken. It was unlike any other Korean fried chicken I have ever tasted and I have probably tasted the best of them including BonChon and KyoChon. The sauce used for the Spicy Chicken was indescribable and the chicken was tender and moist, the star dish of the restaurant.

Unfortunately the restaurant is so far and hidden from the strip and the rest of the Las Vegas, as well as being surrounded by failed establishments, that it has not gotten enough fanfare. I would recommend any local Las Vegas resident to visit this restaurant and try out the menu. I really want to get Ma Dang's name out and I hope this review does that. It is truly a wonderful mom and pop restaurant that deserves the spotlight. If you have time or a rental car to wander around Las Vegas, please hit up Ma Dang for some authentic home-made Korean food.",vUHkvDW9OmpvrXlGrC9HfA,8,7,5,BmSGzUqU8tXXHlB9lGUzTA
4571730,2013-05-31,0,O7OdYts96d0IgRCGwv_GYQ,"Ma Dang had been bookmarked forever, but I finally got to try it last night.  I was joined by Jun A., a Korean student that I know from work, and Eric R.  The first part was finding it - I knew about it because I had seen ""Ma Dang"" on the restaurant in the past when dining at Komol.  However, it now says its name in Korean and then its translation ""Garden"" so I was not sure if that was the right place.  Luckily, Jun A. was already there when we walked in.

They key is to come here with a Korean speaker.  The menu has all of its items in English but everything sounded so good I would not know where to start as a first-timer.  Jun A. ordered LA style beef short rib and spicy chicken stew for the table.

Our server was very friendly and efficient.  Jun A. called out to her in Korean whenever we needed something, so we had great service.  We were the only ones in the restaurant initially but soon it had 3 other large groups of Korean eaters.  A rolling cart with banchan brought out 8 initial dishes: cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, fish cake with jalepeno, potato with jalepeno, scallion pancake, plain bean sprouts, spicy sesame bean sprout, and broccoli with sweet chile paste.  Everything was delicious, with unlimited refills.  We also got a 9th banchan dish, very similar to dashimaki tamago in Japanese cuisine (layered egg crepe).  I really liked everything but was especially fond of the scallion pancake.

Our beef ribs came out first on a sizzling plate with onions.  They were deliciously flavored and hot.  We each got a bowl of rice which was refilled on request (I am not sure if there was an additional charge for refills on rice though - don't think so).  Then, a table burner with the chicken stew arrived.  Once the stew boiled we were able to eat it.  Tender dark meat chicken, potatoes, and green onions in a spicy broth surrounded us with great scents.  We ladled the stew into bowls and ate it with rice.  The flavor was great, but the chicken needed work with hands and mouths to free it from bones.  It was hot so a few fingertips were burned, but it was worth the effort!

I would definitely return.  There are some interesting menu items to try including monkfish, sable/black cod, and mackerel dishes that may be calling my name soon.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,7,1,4,1CD3xC-eyXIgtoe-rt9Ndw

4934540,2014-06-22,3,O7OdYts96d0IgRCGwv_GYQ,"I had been to this restaurant a long time ago but for Korean BBQ when I recall they had built in grills at the table. We came here today in search of Korean Fried Chicken. Based on so many people talking about their  KFC here we came to try it. 

A. How to find it-  Done look for Ma Dang.  The sign on the restaurant is in Korean.  Just look for the blue sign and the word Garden.  It is on the East side of the inner rectangle of the Old Sahara Commercial Center.

B. The menu -  The items will not say Korean Fried Chicken. Instead it will say spicy chicken and is located in the normal BBQ section for the food. We also ordered the Stone Bi Bim Bap and the Soondobu. All was just right, tasty and the chicken was the best. And exactly what was needed. The Soondobu had a bit of clams in it,  I did not think I ordered seafood soondobu, but jut plain soondobu.  So, just be careful if you have a seafood allergy to check if any seafood is in it. I personal liked it and if they had a seafood one, I would have ordered it.

C. The service - First class, friendly and very attentive.  We were here for lunch and the lady spoke very good english overall!   

Everyone was excited as they all had their televises tuned to the Korea v. Algeria game.  It was fun and exciting until Algeria scored three goals in like 20 minutes.

We had to fly anyway as we were heading over to Art of Flavors and wanted to get there as they were opening.  

This place is great.  I enjoy it very much. Very low key, in a decrepit old shopping center, very worn out and tired, but the food and the service is awesome.  This is going to be my go to Korean place.  Well, that is until I try E-Jo across the street in the future!

This place was blue and pretty on the outside and had a nice ""open"" light sign.

The inside was nice and homey. Right away you can tell the korean food here will be good.

Been here twice now since I have been in Vegas. Food is absolutely delicious. The banchan is great as well. Service was great! Like any authentic korean restaurant you just call the waitress over when you need anything and each table had a bell button at the end you can just press to ring them over. If we needed anymore banchan or rice we just asked and they gave.

5174400,2015-03-24,0,O7OdYts96d0IgRCGwv_GYQ,"Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find a Korean restaurant nearby the hotel I was staying. I was looking for this restaurant to be located on Sahara but I couldnt find it anywhere. I later found out this restaurant is located behind in this very big plaza that seems to be dead. The parking lot was very big with all kinds of shops all around it but hardly anyone was in this plaza. Not to mention most of the shops were unleased ans were empty.

The outside of the restaurant looks very funny because its so ugly with the royal blue color painting and the decor of it is such a no no. But I was fully relying on the reviews for their food. The lady who was our server for the day was very nice. She was so helpful and attentive with a very friendly voice.

We ordered Soon Dubu Soup (SDS) and Spicy Cold Noodle (SCN) which they just started selijng this sunday. It's a seasonal dish so you can only eat them during summer I believe. My SDS was average. It kind of tasted a little watered down. Also there wasnt enough Dubu or Tofu in the soup. There was an egg already in the soup also. However, the soup tasted a little too spicy for me but it wasnt bad. I guess it was Seafood flavor because they had put 3 pieces of manila clams. Um, whatever.

SCN we had was also average. It had some broth in there like a regular Cold Noodle with Broth. It wasnt as spicy as we expected probably because of the broth. It wasnt the best however, we had very little expectation, it was better than that so it was good.

Side dishes were pretty good. 8 different variety including bean sprouts, spicy fishcake, kimchi and etc.I might come back to try their other food but I find that it was a little too expensive to eat other foods on te menu.

All in all, service was very good. Very satisfying!",_VD870pQZJPqcGd07vxMsg,5,0,3,V69fq3QBbK8mkBZQP60gZA

5267010,2011-08-03,0,O7OdYts96d0IgRCGwv_GYQ,"Wow this place is a-ma-zing! This is the closest Korean restaurant that comes close to my mom and my grandmas cooking. This place is located inside the shopping center and although the Commerical Center. The appearance of the store may look run down, the flavor of the soups and the soondae (Korean blood sausage) will keep you running back to this place. I came here with my boyfriend once and last weekend went back with my cousin. We were done with work and wanted some Korean soul food. you know spicy, hearty, rich soup bubbling as they bring it to your table. Then we dump in our bowl of rice and to lower the temperature of the soup you add in some daikon kimchee or whatever kimchee they have available with the juices. O-M-G my mouth just salivates describing my experience! The lady was super nice because they close at 10:30 and we got there at 10:45 wondering if they were still open, luckily since there were few customers eating she told us to come right in. How sweet! I ordered what is called 'clotted blood of cattle soup'... LOL... FYI the descriptions don't make things so appetizing, they literally translate the Korean title into English. But anyways, I dont like blood cubes in my soup so i told her not to put it in. instead she added more pieces of kalbi. My boyfriend ordered the soondae soup and cousin ordered sodobu (spicy tofu soup). Be careful when you tell her you want it spicy because its was the spiciest soup I've ever had! its delicious but if you really cant handle spicy, just order normal and let them figure out how to make it. Lastly, we shared a plate of soondae. Mmm there is absolutely no gaminess and it was so good. The blood sausage (which is eaten by most countries other than America) was stuffed with potato vermicelli clear noodles, green onions, garlic, black pepper and some other seasonings. 

This place its one of the few Korean restaurants that define what real Korean food is and not just the bbq. Try it out, the hole in the wall restaurant may just fill the hungry void that is in your tummy!",dA0QWjx56wIVbGaL_r52mQ,3,0,5,EbdXuSbBQDawKcLwImyKBQ

The service is very friendly and hospitable, I literally felt like a guest because they served my portions and encouraged me to eat more!  The food was fresh and delicious, came out pretty fast, and we were given 8 banchans.  Note on the banchans: 6 were authentic Korean sides like different types of kimchee, egg pancakes, etc., but 2 were disappointingly American - steamed broccoli with hot sauce, and macaroni salad.  Prices were a little steep, but honestly the food was worth it.  The restaurant itself is a little tricky to find, but after reading the other reviews it wasn't hard.  It's in the center of a sketchy strip mall, and a majority of the other businesses are also Korean.  As everyone else says, ""Ma Dang"" is written in Korean.

We ordered BBQ pork (daegi-gogi), kimchi soup (kimchi jjigae), and fried dumplings (yaki Mandu).  There was plenty of side dishes (banchan) complete with 2 kinds of kimchi, seaweed, 2 kinds of bean sprouts, soy sauce potatoes, cucumber, and korean pancakes.  Everything was absolutely delicious!
