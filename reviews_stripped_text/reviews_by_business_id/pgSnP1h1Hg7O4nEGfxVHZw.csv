200022,2011-09-24,1,pgSnP1h1Hg7O4nEGfxVHZw,"DELICIOUS Mexican Food! I was there the day they opened and had the seafood soup-7 Mares and I LOVED it. 

I have been back quite a few times and every dish I have had, I have nothing but Good things to say and one word says it all-DELICIOUS. 

The fresh guacamole dip is a perfect appetizer with the chips and yummy salsa.  

If you are a soup lover like me don't forget your Tortilla soup before your main entree ;) DELICIOUS! Perfect little cup of a tasty soup.

Friendly Staff, and Reasonable Prices. Can't wait to have the Menudo Dish...my next victom :)",H49K2QxoyAD8qGhQmJwN4A,3,0,5,yOYa-gJtk6h5dKLiyGzOGw

It is fantastic!  I'm vegetarian and usually get simple items like bean & cheese burrito or chile relleno and they are excellent...but my fiance raves about their meat dishes.

The service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean.  The prices are very reasonable.  Overall, there is nothing to not love about it!!",mw7FYKNDtUM8FEOD0HDvxw,2,0,5,Zb5BvPwQCR--FhwVDB_UAw

It is beautiful, clean, roomy and the food is excellent. We were attended to by ""El Hefe"" Jorge himself, and he made sure we had everything perfect. He aims to please and he made our evening wonderful. The wait staff are all attentive and friendly but never obnoxious. Just very pleasing. I especially like their beef enchiladas. The sauce has such a special delicate flavor that I have never tasted before, and the beef is tender and juicy with no fat or gristle. The rice and beans are perfect. Sister had a seafood tostada and nieces had taco salads and cheese enchiladas. Everybody loved their food. This is our new Mexican hangout. One of the best we've ever found in Las Vegas.",AnrIQKzg3QpLO15XVl33FQ,2,0,5,K9u-t7adP-jpdng_qzuC_Q
768359,2011-11-14,1,pgSnP1h1Hg7O4nEGfxVHZw,"Yesterday night was my first time eating at the restaurant.  I wasn't blown away but it was ok.  The food was good enough for the price they were charging and the overall experience was pleasant.

I had:
Carne Asada entree that came with rice and beans.
It was pretty tasty, the marinade was delicious and the meat was very tender.  I order medium and the steak came approximately medium rare?  a little bloody but still acceptable. (i don't expect perfect grilling just because they are not a steak house and it's hard to grill to perfection or as ordered.  not too concerned)  The beans were alright and the rice was ok, nothing spectacular but still delicious.  I ordered corn tortillas to go with the meal and they were good.

the bf had:
Chicken and Steak fajitas.  I don't think you can ever go wrong with fajitas at a mexican restaurant just because in my opinion it's a DIY dish and if the toppings are good you can never go wrong with meat served on a pipping hot skillet.  The meat had a tasty marinade and the peppers and onions were tender enough to enjoy in the wrap.  He ordered flour tortillas and looked pretty delish.  i had a bite of the chicken alone and steak as well and they were good.  I had some onions and peppers later on and they were good as well.  

Chips, beans and salsa were endless and their chips are very crispy and fresh, the salsa seems a little store bought but the beans w/ them were tasty.

Overall, it was a good experience, nothing mind blowing but i would definitely go back and try other things on the menu.",zeOG1kyPgYmu7YSvIcyTCA,3,1,3,Z-Yv6deM4kpzS4HeR7qZGw

Best thing.. Chips and Salsa.. Really good chips.. big flaky chips.. really nice flavor.. the salsa.. kinda spicy and was very good as well. My anticipation climbed for dinner. Chicken Fajitas.. Well.  it was disappointing.. Nothing to it.. was . flavorless and really sub par. My girl ordered Carne asada.. like a piece of meat.. no taste.. just there.. 

Really nice treat was the Tortilla Soup.. really good and hd some spice in it so I was really expecting better food. It was served as a complimentary dish and was a nice treat!
 
Now I wish i had better things to say.. but I don't.. Employees were really nice and I had great service but the food was really plain. No imagination or spice introduced at all.

2525964,2012-04-19,0,pgSnP1h1Hg7O4nEGfxVHZw,I lived in New Mexico very close to the Mexican border for 10years. Good Mexican food in Las Vegas is not easy to fin which has always shocked me. This place is WONDERFUL! Don't judge them by only what is on the menu. They have things for the gringos but also for the die hard Mexican food lovers as well...you may just have to ask! I asked for a spicier salsa and was given the most incredible spicy pico de gallo I've ever had! Friendly service and good food and it's NOT crazy Vegas prices!

I found this place through a friend and fellow yelper who told me about their lunch specials.  I arrived to be greeted at the door and immediately sat down, there was about 5 other people in the restaurant so there was no waiting at all.  

As many others have mentioned, they brought me the chips with beans and salsa. I went ahead with the enchilada lunch special which was wonderful.  All of the lunch specials are $10 and under, and for what you get, you really can't beat that! 

My service was quick, the staff was friendly, the food was delicious.  I didn't go 5 stars because I didn't get that, ""OMG wow the best thing in the world"", but it was still very good",aF0x_jysPRIkR9O-qq8xuw,0,0,4,G74gperBvGo6-JW0m-gG1w

I walked in and was seated, it was early so there was no crowd. The waiter immediately brought the menu, salsa dip and bean dip with tortilla chips and ask for my beverage choice, I chose iced tea. 

I scanned the menu, a lot of variety. I ordered one of the lunch specials, a beef chimichanga.  While waiting I started eating the chips with the dips, both were very good and the chips were freshly made. I'm enjoying the chips, look up and my meal is already here

It was a nice size chimichanga, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with rice and beans. The chimi was excellent, shredded beef and cheese, the rice and beans were average, but good.

All this for $7.50 including the drink. I will be back often.

I have had the Chicken \ Steak Fajitas and the Carne Asada Burrito.

We started out with some ""Chile con Queso Dip"" that cost $7.95. It was very good and we would order this again. The chips that came with is were delicious. 

I had the ""Cheese Enchiladas"" that cost just $7.50. It came with rice and beans. The price was very affordable but I wouldn't order Enchiladas again. They weren't authentic tasting.

My man had the ""Carne Asada Burrito"" that cost $8.95. It also came with the usual rice and beans. He did enjoy it and said he would order it again. It was a nicely sized burrito. 

We each had a couple Margaritas and they were tasty :)

All in all we would come back at some point and give it another try but I had to give it 3 stars because of my Enchiladas not being up to par and I would obviously try something else.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,5,2,3,ircSz_MQz_r7zWYNLu8xHQ

4294575,2011-09-12,5,pgSnP1h1Hg7O4nEGfxVHZw,"I was disappointed. 

I dined in the restaurant Saturday evening. Everyone that worked there was courteous and friendly. Unfortunatley, the food wasn't all that.

The chips and salsa were ok, but the refried beans looked and tasted like Rosarita refried beans.

I order a 2 item combination dinner and chili rellano side dish.

Beef Taco - Beef was tasty, but disappointed in the taco shell - it was paper thin. 

Chicken Enchilada - bland and saugy. The tortilla that wrapped the chicken was thin and mushy. The chicken was seasoned well.

Chili Rellano - it was standard. Nothing spectacular.

Mexican Rice - standard.

Refried Beans - I'm CONVINCED they are from out of the can!

**Overall it was disappointing.**

Prior to dining in the restaurant, I went into the restaurant to obtain a menu and I spoke to the hostess. I asked if their tortillas were handmade. She said, ""yes"". After dining in the restaurant, the tortillas may very well be handmade, but they are handmade paper thin. The tortilla chips were thicker than the taco shell and enchilada. 

My bill came out to about $15 which is typical of a restaurant of this caliber. But for the same money I paid for this dinner, I could have eatten at a Lindo/Bonito Michocan and listened to LIVE entertainment since it was a Saturday night.

One thing that I did notice, there was a large party leaving the restaurant's private dining room. They looked to be Mexican nationals, which I assume were friends of the owners or family. All I could think is ""I wonder how these Mexicans liked the food because as a Mexican myself, it was subpar"". 

My reccomendation would be for the owners to check out Leticia's Cocina located in the NW to experience AUTHENTIC Mexican food.",ZSFvE013RL8Nt57YmRgFQA,7,0,1,6KQaBdcxkthcgV4Jrx2wgA
4556684,2011-09-15,0,pgSnP1h1Hg7O4nEGfxVHZw,"I don't know what's up with the hater below, but I loved the enchiladas.  There were two cheese enchiladas with a large slice of steak on top.  The meat was delicious and the filling was creamy.  The carnitas was pretty awesome too (my 1st trip there).  They were good enough to bring me back, obviously.

And someone else please tell this guy what Rosarito beans taste like.  Go try the bean dip and tell me it doesn't have flavors of onion and chorizo in there.  This is Lindo, except cheaper and closer to home.  I'm not driving to Flamingo/215 or Eastern/Sahara to eat some Lindo.  This place is like 5 minutes of freeway from me...  Honestly, next time I go to this joint, I'll put up some pictures of the food.

The meal started with top-notch chips, salsa and bean dip. Looking over the menu, the average entree was $8-15. If you happen to be vegetarian, the menu does not offer creative options, but you can always go with a bean burrito or cheese enchilada. 

The Enchiladas Tarascas caught my eye. Three cheese enchiladas, skirt steak, salad and beans for $11, and everything comes with a cup of tortilla soup! Sold. My husband took the waiter's recommendation and ordered the seafood chile relleno.

My husband was thrilled with all the shrimp swimming around in his chile. However, my entree was disappointing. The cheese enchiladas were filled with sharp, shredded cheddar cheese that wasn't fully melted. I regret not asking them if this was the normal preparation because part of me feels like they  must have run out of the appropriate cheese! The shining point: the plate was generous with a fresh salad.

If I were going on the enchiladas alone, I would not recommend. However, the rest of the experience and value was great, and I will return for one more try before making a final judgment.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,10,6,3,TpiQDxZc6Kdq9pyTiJTdCw
