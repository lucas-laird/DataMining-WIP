791989,2015-06-25,3,rx1AEnleVRWMNz6vB-YhfQ,"Wonton Soup was very disappointing. Wonton soup is never served like this. It's like they had leftover food/vegetables and threw it all in the dish. Lots of filler product in it.

It's not how authentic and even western Chinese places ( that are good and even on average) make their soup. 

Mystery meat in the soup, whole peas, carrots, cabbage, zucchini, three pieces only of  not even an actual wonton,  shrimp,  mutton(old age lamb),and bok choy.  

Mystery stew rather than wonton soup.  Cheap product and not worth 8-9+$ dollars!

Complete rip off.  

Not proper wonton, it's the wonton noodle over a piece of pork, it's not ground pork (or sometimes shrimp) like it should be.

Also, i did not have the bubble tea/boba tea but it did not look proper or authentic at all. 

Why Asian places in Vegas who specialize in this or Asian food do not make it how it's supposed to be is mind blogging weird. They are truly ruining the food and the experience by giving you crap. 

This isn't the only place that's like this either, seems to be a very common thing in Vegas, you are paying for something that isn't even up to quality or what it is supposed to be.

 Is there no standards in Vegas for Asian food?    It's a shame because when Wonton soup is done well, even the frozen stuff is excellent compared to this. Because it is DONE RIGHT. 

And why the ASIAN OWNED establishments are serving you crap,and not making it like should be.. people actually think it is good and how it should be, when it is not served like this ANYWHERE ELSE.

Wonton soup should not be filled with cheap product and mystery meat, it's a simple soup that you can't go wrong making. Same with boba/bubble tea, it should NOT BE A SLUSHIE IN  A SLUSHIE MACHINE!

Will not order again or come back. Not the real thing.

2.75 per wonton (three not even quality or proper wonton) and the rest is CHEAP FILLER PRODUCT FOR AN EXPENSIVE PRICE.

Heads up to anyone eating at Asian establishments around Vegas!! Especially this one!

JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE ASIAN AND OWN A RESTAURANT DOES NOT MEAN YOU KNOW HOW TO COOK ASIAN FOOD/PRODUCTS, DON'T BE FOOLED PEOPLE.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,3,1,1,U1G5Gqs1lenvqHx7GlSuLg

1588380,2014-02-20,0,rx1AEnleVRWMNz6vB-YhfQ,"Heard about this place when I got a sheet of coupons in the mail. Checked out the menu on the back and found out their lunch specials are valid til 4PM- I'm in! I called in my order on my way out the door from work, and swung by to pick up on my way home. Was told it'd be ready in 10 minutes, was packed and waiting for me when I walked in the door.

Got home and it was still piping hot, always a good sign.
Went for the won ton soup and the combination kung pao lunch special with half-and-half side of chow mein and fried rice. Bummed that the egg drop soup isn't included in take out lunch specials, but I had the giant soup instead. Used a coupon for a free 2 piece of egg rolls or rangoon (picked the rangoon) with $10 minimum purchase. Side note- they didn't take the coupon! I may use it again...

Overall, I was satisfied with the food. The soup in particular was good and despite sitting around for a while, the won tons were not falling apart- a couple, but not enough to make a sweeping statement or a negative impact on the dish. Lots of variety in the soup: bits of bbq pork, shrimp, and veggies in the broth, and plenty of won tons. Would get this again. Initially thought the $6.50 price tag was steep, but it's a meal.
The lunch special was also $6.50, and a hefty portion, too. Compartments of the styrofoam takeout box were overflowing- fried rice was moist but a little boring, chow mein was chewy and a little plain, both both balanced out the crazy combination kung pao. I say crazy here in a good way though- it was a giant portion with every meat mixed in, and quite a bit of chopped veggies, too. Spicy but not enough to scare anyone off, flavorful would be a more accurate way to put it. I did pick out the chiles before I started eating, but was really surprised to see five in my portion. FIVE! So if you're down for spice, go ahead and leave those in.
The rangoons were a nice little treat, small but indulgent, not too much cream cheese, either.

It's so convenient, and the coupons are a nice touch, and the well-priced lunch specials in giant portions (this is easily lunch for tomorrow, too)? I can safely say I'll be back.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,0,4,3PBIOPX_xlMNgGPA4cA08Q

She crafted a way to brew an iced tea for me! She is definitely the star of this China One and knows a great deal about customer service.

Why give 3 stars?
Food *egg drop soup was watery and had corn *rice needed some seasoning asap
*chow mein had chunks of onions and very little prtion of noodles
*orange chicken was hard
And they put 2 pieces of cold broccoli in it
Also as I was eating customers came in asking for some boba tea but they didn't have any at the moment. So they left, then the employees started making fun of them.

5390428,2012-07-03,1,rx1AEnleVRWMNz6vB-YhfQ,"Coworker came over to my office today and mentioned she was in the mood for ""real"" chinese food, and not ""that Panda Express @#$%""  Luckily for the both of us I'd been racking my brain for over 30 minutes scouring Yelp on what to eat for lunch.  I then remembered that I had a takeout menu for China One and simultaneously thought of the good reviews it gets and that they deliver.  My sanity was saved!  

I called the order in and must not have been talking to the same person other reviews mentioned.  I understood everything she said perfectly and in no time our order was on the way.  We both decided to try the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce lunch special.  30 minutes later the food arrived at my office and I dug in.  There was a LARGE portion of chicken and veggies in the sauce, then half half fried rice and chow mein.  They also offer steamed rice but I was feeling piggish.  Also included was a bag of those crispy fried wonton strip thingies that I adore so much.  

I was fairly disappointed in the rice and chow mein.  I'm sure it was just some higher being's way of punishing me for not getting steamed rice, but the chow mein tasted bland and the fried rice tasted generic.   Is it as offensive as it sounds to say that I would have preferred Panda Express' versions of these?  I liked the sauce for the entree quite a bit, it wasn't nearly as spicy as I'd like, but the flavors of garlic, jalapeno, mushrooms and some bell peppers and onions shone through.  The chicken was just okay, and I definitely found the pieces that were drenched in the sauce to be better than the more dry ones.

Price was great at basically $6 for each order, and I don't even think they charged for delivery which was another bonus.  

For food alone, I was considering a 2, but with the ultra cheap price, the free delivery, and the little bag of bribery containing the wonton strip thingies, I'll bump them up to a 3.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,3,3,1EAm18an3sQvvSzqLmmKPg

The lunch special comes with a steamed or fried rice, plain chow mein, a soup, wonton crackers and 1 entree of your choice. I chose an orange chicken with a fried rice.  It did not take that long for the plate to arrive but no one brought me a soup nor the wonton cracker and the sauce. Not even a glass of water. I have to ask for it before they deliver it. The guy only brought the soup but still no wonton crackers, sauce and water. When I tried the orange chicken, it was hard. Taste was okay. Small portion of chow mein but house fried rice has a good amount of it and taste okay too. The only concern I have is the service.

I came back here today (2/21) for lunch. Instead of ordering lunch, I wanted to spend more money and order regular items. Then I realized I had a $2off coupon from Eat24. I asked the girl who was going to take my order if I could order from Eat24. She appeared to be uncomfortable and made faces & said yeah. Then she talked to her partner, who was sitting at the next table from us, is also Chinese & worked there in Chinese. I could tell from her voice tone, so I asked again if it was a problem because I didn't understand what would be the difference since I ordered from Eat24 before. Her partner said me, ""You know it is a 3rd party vendor right? You can only order to go. We prefer you order with us."" I asked why they prefered with them, if they didn't like Eat24 then why they partnered with them for ordering. She started to go off at me & being sacastic by saying ""Yeah Yeah..you can BOSS. That's fine Boss. You are right.""

So, we left. We just wanted a good lunch with good customer services. We didn't want to deal with sarcasm. We would have been more than happy to order thru them if they knew how to communicate with their customers better without being sarcastic and making unnecessary faces. We wouldn't come back again!

Now we are having lunch happily somewhere else on Spring Mountain.",yfOThLCMhjoCn3AD8VmHoQ,2,0,2,RHWPXv1BDp3aO24WjvwJvw

Anyways, me and my buddy took the food home and the texture of the meat was so bad that it seemed as if they took all the fat trimmings and decided to make a bowl out if it (I ordered a basic teriyaki beef bowl), the taste was even worse. I usually have a huge appetite after working out but I have never gotten so close to throwing up after eating fast food until then.
