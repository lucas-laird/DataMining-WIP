I had the carne asada tacos with everything and Verde sauce...OMG! I ate one in the car before I drove away and I was in heaven. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Plenty of it too, no skimping here. It brought joy to my world. I couldn't drive away until I got a photo of the truck so I could find them again. Luckily I got a card...I will find you again my friend :-)",VIbO-UFAeEB0r-dGgIOKcA,0,1,5,L8TsQAa_lPuJZ7yVIVAvoA

I got a quesadilla with meat , and he got a burrito. the quesadilla was about $6 and absolutely great! it was nice and stuffy with meat, and the meat itself had a great flavor. it had pico de gallo with avocado slices inside and beans. and he is not greedy at all. definitely worth the price. my boyfriend got a carnitas burrito and he was in love with it . stuffy burrito as well. great salsa options to mix in with the food as well. we will definitely come back. friendly owner btw!",FhmewaAFaeAEeNnKtc5LQg,1,1,5,9sLKtuxRjuotabN7y4TtRg

The tacos are big, and they have the perfect amount of meat.  
I order the tongue tacos and pastor and they were really good.  Besides the great food Jaime has the best costumer service.  Both times I have been there we talk like we have known each other for a while.  He is from Veracruz and doesn't like the hot weather here in Vegas ;).
Go and enjoy the food, and get to know this awesome man :)",s03Hbpkhb2uklGs9y6k9DQ,2,2,5,45wu2sC3-m6cW5McH5yMgg
4289698,2017-08-11,0,8hZjiPzJIojA1k7_W4hELA,The man had run out of two ingredients for that night but he was very nice and friendly. The food truck isn't there very often. And the quesadilla was good but not the best I've had. Will definitely be going back to try the tacos and give it a second chance.,akTwzcK787FosabmKqR6Vw,0,0,3,_MbT52_CVzxkpbWsifGQaQ
4890387,2018-04-11,0,8hZjiPzJIojA1k7_W4hELA,Just simply some of the best tacos I have ever had. The meat is always seasoned perfectly and the tacos have so much that you are full after two. The price is spot on with how much you get. The owner is so nice and cooks everything fresh.,JZuY5aBZwI1as1o_GdE29w,0,0,5,QaXtt6zulafVSqlMKyjTIg
5204745,2015-09-19,0,8hZjiPzJIojA1k7_W4hELA,Needed some gas for my car and stopped at the 76 gas station & I  saw this little taco stand but its a bit hidden in the back of the gas station but the lights should catch your eye. My hubby and I decided to try this taco stand... Well let me say that these tacos are by far the best I've had in Vegas. The owner was very sweet and made us feel like family. The tacos are big and the meat is on point (totally worth $),fYJf6G30hZlhVxWTOGS1fw,2,1,5,GlpY7MtZyo_ErQWxyDpm8A
