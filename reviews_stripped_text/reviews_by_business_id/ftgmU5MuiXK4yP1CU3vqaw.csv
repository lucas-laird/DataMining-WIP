Rating: Three stars

Service: Underwhelming service.  The server was unable to remember the order for a party of one.  If a server needs to write down an order, customers understand and it is better to write down an onder than to have to ask about it twice and forget items anyway.

844625,2018-02-24,0,ftgmU5MuiXK4yP1CU3vqaw,My wife and I dined here on 02/23/18 for our 15th anniversary. We experienced excellent food and service. My wife had an impressive looking seafood pasta and I had a wonderful NY Strip. The restaurant gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.

996296,2017-08-01,1,ftgmU5MuiXK4yP1CU3vqaw,"A nice surprise at the Tropicana! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Luxor last weekend and decided to forgo the Vegas buffet experience for a quieter, more upscale dinner for the last night of our stay. We were seated right away for our 8pm reservation and enjoyed a seriously amazing complimentary array of warm sesame and olive breads, basil aioli and a bruschetta-type tomato spread to start. We then ordered the tomato/artichoke/mozzarella/ciabatta starter, which had a nice balance of flavors, and the ahi tuna poke. I've enjoyed a looot of poke in LA, and I can assure you that theirs is legit while being as refined as you'd hope for. The plantain chips were a tasty touch and made for a fantastic presentation. The scallop/asparagus/corn johnnycake starter was also lovely--the scallops were perfectly seasoned and seared. 

Our server Alex, who was helpful but never intrusive throughout our meal, guided my boyfriend in choosing the perfect steak among the many options. He was not disappointed in his wagyu ribeye! The (huge) steak came with a trio of cute little sauces for each bite. I'm not a red meat eater, but I was still impressed!

We skipped dessert, but I would return for a try, especially if I happen to be in Vegas again for a birthday or other special occasion. Or, you know, just to have that bread and bruschetta spread again.",j2KjM99Rwgxo6mtId1gnyg,3,2,5,7kR_kFOqZcFWR6OIiPKHvQ

Prices were a bit higher than I'd prefer for lunch, but I don't mind paying for quality. Service was decent. We came in right before they closed for lunch so I can understand the servers may have been a little disappointed as they may have been about to be cut for the afternoon.

Started with cocktails, dirty martini for moi and above the weather for my beau, both were decent, nothing spectacular.  We were brought bread, told it was french and sourdough; I love sourdough, this was a hearty rye, not a hint of sourdough, the butter though was nice with the spiced top.  Moving on..I ordered prime rib with side of au jus, waiter acted like I was asking him for his kidney or something, he said well it comes with it, I said of course it does, I would like some on the side in a ramekin! Then he turns to my beau and starts to ask for his order, I stopped him as I wasn't finished :(  I asked then for a side of truffled mac & cheese *oy*..so he quickly went back to get beau's order.  Beau ordered the Texas Wagu filet rare and waiter was nice enough to ask him if he'd like a side, which he ordered the Brussels sprouts with smoked beef belly  *didn't know that was a thing* pieces.  Food came out of kitchen super fast, really too fast for $$$ eatery.  I do wish I would have taken a picture of my prime rib, it needed a raft to keep from sinking in the au jus pool, but hey good news is there was a ramekin with au jus as I requested..then I look to the truffled mac & cheese..I was surprised to be served gummy, undercooked orecchiette pasta, mixed with something white and cheese like..it was terrible, not sure where they hid the truffle.  I returned it and requested the asparagus, which was vibrant and cooked nicely.  Now the brussels sprouts...tasteless, blanched, then baked..so disappointing, the ""smoked beef belly"" was neither salty nor sweet, looked like brown hanging chads from a indecisive voter ballot, I bet the chads have more flavor.  Plus side, the meat was higher quality and tasted nice.

The lobster bisque tasted burned and watery without any lobster pieces in the bisque. We waited 25 minutes to get out food and then all burned. We brought it to the waiters attention, Carlos who was very nice. He showed it to manager and they didn't charge us for the meal. What I thought was ironic is that we ordered 1 coffee and and 1 ice tea $10. wow and they did charge us for that, dumb. There were other guest who were walking out because they had waited 30 minutes and still no food on their table, SAD. The food court at the Tropicana was GREAT, fresh and reasonable wait time.

It was a Sunday and I told the person on the phone it was my husband's birthday and she said she would make note of it on the reservation. I thought that meant something would be done, like a scope of ice cream or something. I have to admit that was a big let down because I had nothing else prepared like cake or special treat. 
On to our dinner...... The restaurant is beautiful. The service is A+. Our server and wait staff was so warm and friendly. We ordered wine and a cocktail. The server gave us the most delicious breads with bruschetta and aioli. So fresh and good. You could easily fill up on this. 
For our dinner, my husband ordered a filet and I had filet with an 8 oz lobster tail. Yes it was to die for. The steaks were over the medium we ordered them but still melted in our mouth good so we had no problem eating them. We split a big baked potato which was perfect. The piece de resistance was the cream corn. OMG order it. It is the best I ever had! The meal was lovely and something we will never forget.",5yqwgMmb2YLgRJljPLIH6g,2,0,4,-y11hcMwqceIFAXn0GjAyQ

We made reservations through yelp which was all good they sat us right away and gave us booth like requested. The service here is really good our server was super nice and did a great job. We got the crab cakes which were alright my opinion they were way too small but they were delicious and crispy which I like. The oysters were delicious and highly recommended. For sides we got the Brussels sprouts and the baked potato and truffles Mac n cheese. Ok let me start with the Brussels they were my least favorite out if everything we got they were soggy and not very flavorful. Maybe over marinated idk but they could if been better. The Mac n cheese was delicious I couldn't taste the truffle but it was still good. The baked potato was great hard to mess that up. It's a lot on the pricey side so be prepared to spend over 100 here easy.,6cWG68FRJmudUrxddj9Feg,1,0,4,174HLial3qdY4iSqP6oj3Q

Service 2 stars.

We had a $26 credit from the hotel for Breakfast and we decided to eat here, the breakfast options seemed better than the Italian place across the hall.
Antonia the hostess was very nice and friendly, and we got some help from Mark.

However, our main server was apparently not at his best. He did not stop to see us for a very long time, Mark noticed and got our drink order for us...

Once we ordered he stopped by a couple of times, but just like passing by and not really waiting for us to answer (specially when you have a mouthful)... Getting refills was a struggle, and at one time my husband got up to go get someone's attention, but we could not remember what is that we needed.

My steak an eggs was OK, cooked to my liking, but my hubby's breakfast burrito (Chorizo and eggs) did not taste like chorizo at all, it just had a little bit of color but no taste. 
Almost at the end of our meal we had a chance to mention to our server and he acknowledged the chorizo burrito it is supposed to be way better than that. At that time I also asked for butter and jam for my toast, which he said I was supposed to get with my meal.

As I said our food was OK, but I also noticed the table next to us had gotten sandwiches and both of them had burned bread. One of the ladies was eating it as is, and the other one removed the bread (after inspecting it) and ate the rest of the food. One, as a customer, I would have send both those sandwiches back, and 2, as a server, I would have not brought those items to the table.

Overall, not impressed with this place. If for the convenience you decide to come here, have low expectations and stand up for yourself : )",z_tqPytGQF_tDw_buHKJcw,0,0,2,kxANrr_-_cJ2jeiPd88QVA

I was at the Tropicana for a conference and I had sworn to my travel companion that I didn't want to eat at any of the food service providers in the hotel.  The prices were not competitive with what could be found elsewhere.  Nonetheless, I was strapped for time.  I had 45 minutes to order and eat.
The server was friendly, but he was in no rush to take an order.  (Other people from my conference were at the bar and they too were waiting).  The restaurant was also not crowded.
My friend ordered a burger and the lobster bisque.  I asked for chicken on a bun with a side of fries.
The order took the entire 45 minutes to deliver.  I insisted that it needed to be bagged (that caused another 10 minute delay).  My friend told me that the bisque was rancid and that the burger was nothing special.  He even brought the bisque back.  The friendly server took it to the cook and the cook refused to acknowledge that anything was wrong with it.  The server gave my friend another soft drink.
My chicken was dry and the potatoes were all over-salted.  This meal cost $40.  I would not recommend this place and I would not serve the leftovers to a dog.",aFe_uDM1nzzKBpZBmFUIVQ,3,0,1,RhTrqfQw3zTtDvCMFEFTKQ

I ate a carmelized onion soup with smoked bacon brioche and melted gruyere. It was deep and bold. Next I had a smoked scallop chop salad with pickled blueberries and citrus vinaigrette. This meal-sized salad was so good that I would come back to Oakville just for this. I topped my meal off with a deconstructed banana cream pie that was divine.

The heirloom and tomatoes salad tastes just isn't quite right.  The beef all seems to have some kind of salt rub that is way way too salty.  I ordered it medium and it was too dry for my preference.

A few errors on the wine menu stating California wines as being from Washington state, gave me pause to their attention to detail and actual wine knowledge, considering they're naming themselves after a wine region in Napa! When I mention this to the way there he seemed confused and kind of blew it off.

The food was just OK and nowhere near the quality of a steakhouse at these prices.  The brussels sprouts were way overcooked and mushy!  Felt like vegetables that have been sitting in a pot for hours, and not something that I have been freshly prepared for my dinner.

The veal chop I ordered was overcooked, I requested medium rare which was what the waiter recommended as chefs recommendation. But the chop I received was more well done with the edges being dry and hard and the Center edible but still over done.  For $60 for a veal chop I expected significantly better preparation.

Overall, a very forgettable dinner and if you are used to dining in a good steakhouse, I would skip. If you are used to dining at Bonanza this is a step up.",icxa8DoqiVdCJzsb8KMCBg,1,0,2,kJMJXgA6ADCn6aZMVJftXg
