Absolutely the slowest service I have ever received from Subway. Didn't have 2 of the dressings that I wanted and once she was done with the salad, the employer let me know that they didn't have salad lids. Since I was picking it up to eat  later, it would have been nice to know they couldn't cover my food. Will never be returning here again.",qxCogJ4Gn32UL0bTxsATbw,1,0,1,UxuZyByqLVlfVQYM3S59Vg

2071182,2017-03-12,0,l_eFv9Q9Q8RBLqfJJXi9ug,This is my 6th time eating at this location. Either get the bmt or tuna or turkey and I have to say; WOW! Sandwich was made to perfection. Usually certain Subways lack on the sandwich making skills but not this one. This is my new Subway. Every time I have ordered it is the same lady and she knows what she is doing lol.,A1260f7xjSSujYqT2ImiHg,0,1,5,nijMQHV76K_QL029n7fEtg

This subway owner is so cheap.

Just making ""subway"" brand looks bad
Not cool subway",8vYkLL2ARRrwJSkPkgP7ew,0,0,1,ToMM7CJbm1Bj3-hGimdElw

Employee was EXTREMELY SLOW, they didn't have any guacamole, and they were ""all out of chicken"" at 4pm on a Saturday?

Ridiculous

Absolutely unacceptable",hUf_24SvW7laC_9oFadFqw,0,0,1,cy6gb5rGazh5TFB_aoI1Zw

Something told me I should've just made the drive down the street and went to me REGULAR location.  I never have these type of problems at the Subway up the street from Target, and they are open 24hrs.

So on to this raggedy ass location, late night washing at the laundry mat, I was hungry when I left the house but I figured I was only drying clothes so I can hold on for 30mins. Big mistake, 9:30pm what I was in the mood for was closed, and a cheesebuger, taco, pizza, etc just wasn't the palete pleasing meal that I wanted.  So where do you go in a time of some ""FRESH FOOD"" eating? SUBWAY, that's their slogan 'Subway eat FRESH!'...well my meal was NOT FU@%!N$ FRESH and now I see why all 3 reviews written for this location is 1STAR and if they could they probably would rate ZERO too.

I get there 30mins before closing, attitude sucked, lack of personality, NO customer service whatsoever.  I don't care that you're in a rush to go home, you applied to work at Subway, I know the struggle, once upon a time I was also a Sandwich Artist, so miss me w/ the speech on how long it takes you to clean up.  How about you good back there an prep for some bread for proof for the next day b/c my bread was STALE and damn near crunchy.

ONE OF MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES: if I ask for something outside of the normal, I am freaking aware that there is an extra charge.

I asked: Can you add avocado to that for me please (now this is before I knew about the stale bread)

HIS response: well that's gonna cost you $0.75

What pissed me off is that he stopped making my sandwich and gave me a crazy look when he said, so I SNAPPED!. ""No $h!t Sherlock, it's listed on the menu as EXTRA w/ the price to the left, ol' dumba$$.  Did I ask you how does it cost, no I said can you add avocado to my sandwich and I said PLEASE""  I promise if he could spit in my sandwich right he would've.

So I finally get back to the laundromat w/ my sandwich in hand, my stomach is screaming at me, I unwrap my sandwich and it's in 2 PIECES!  No, if that was I would have gone to Jimmy John's...ok, actually I did go to Jimmy John's but they  had closed at 9pm :-(",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,2,1,1,_qUujAXopeCcvYpNDRhqrg
