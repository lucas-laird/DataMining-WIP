I guess I was really hungry at the time. And their fries was awesome. One of the better fries I had in a long time. Price is a bit steep, oh well, your in vegas. Who cares. I came to realize that $20 is literally $1 out there. To me, thats a cheap dinner versus spending $60 plus on dinner.

Overall : not bad. chili dog $5.95
                                 fries $4.00",zx0-Pax_YMd_AIaHBvMcrw,0,0,3,ImbxRAXlTcvFoNCKM4rkRw

Price is a little steeper but it's in a casino so i'm not surprised.  Compared to what else is in the Palms food court it's a great option to have.  

I came here waiting for a movie to start up as i was ridiculously early and this always hits the spot for a hungry man.  And the lemonade is good to.  I mean it's not like FANTASTIC ... this is a food court after all but it beats the minute maid crap that like McDonalds has.

If i had to choose i say either this place or the pizza place next door is where to go for food in the palms food court.",g8E-RUZZGAHwnQoelG1K6w,0,0,4,Vw55yeLIvq2S2YsywTxKBQ

2176269,2014-06-24,2,Kyl7Iaubsz3vvfykxdcmjA,Always liked Nathan dogs. But $12 for a dog and a lemonade? That's pricey. I could've found a cheaper item at the 24/7 Cafe down the casino for a sit down meal.,-fUARDNuXAfrOn4WLSZLgA,2,2,2,jtPqRAKBpYMFvKqGh8bLZw
2346728,2013-12-01,1,Kyl7Iaubsz3vvfykxdcmjA,"Why does Nathan's always sponsor hot dog eating contest? Competitors eat their hot dogs, advertise the Nathan's brand, and win cash prizes. As for myself, an empty wallet and unsatisfied pallet.

From my last trip to Vegas, I wanted to try the popular Nathan's chain. Once I saw one, I had to make a quick stop. When I went to place my order there was no line at all. It took me a few minutes to browse through the menu and decide on what I wanted to eat. I went on to place an order a chill dog with crinkle fries with the friendly cashier. After placing my order, I was handed one of those huge pagers to let me know when my order was ready. 10 minutes later I get a buzz on the pager and went to pick up my food.

For around $14, the plate looked bountiful of fast food goodness! Apparently, the meal didn't taste of a $14 quality.  The chili and hot dog tasted bland but salty. I was expecting some sort of kick from the chili, but no magic happened here. The crinkle fries were the only decent tasting items from my meal. 

I just can't see eye to eye with competitive eaters like Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut. The hype just blindsided me.",xxMg8OyUtXFNJ2QXDXF4dQ,1,1,2,eUtbR0DRokIwWoymZiro8g

I'm sorry, that's all I can say about this place. I work at Mandalay Place, and I decided (against my better judgement) to walk over to the food court place in the Luxor casino.  

The girl that rang me up was nice enough, even gave me the employee discount :) I just showed her my Urban discount card! I thought that was pretty cool. But that's pretty much where all coolness ends. 

I ordered the bacon cheese hot dog. Pretty simple, right? Take a hot dog, throw some melted cheese and bacon on it, and voila!! Doneski...... You would think.

She hands me one of those coasters that light up and vibrate when you have a wait at a restaurant. Ummm, wtf. I thought this was a food court, and all we are serving are hot dogs here.... Really?

After a 10 minute wait (waaaaaay too long for a damn hot dog in my opinion), my coaster goes off. I pick up my dog, then walk over to the employee break room to grab a soda and eat.

First bite, and the hot dog completely FALLS APART. Like, bun completely crumbles, the strips of bacon come flying out, and cheese sauce goes everywhere. So messy, so gross. Even with my discount, I paid almost $6 for some lame-ass hot dog that fell apart the instant i bit into it. Very disappointing, indeed.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,7,3,2,2k5GhAsk797KmxmVSs59qQ

I was dumb enough to think that the picture of they showed was a cheese dog while in actuality the picture was with sour kraut. I was dissapointed that the cheese they used was just nacho cheese in a little hot dog. I give this place 2 stars becasue the hot dog had some potential but for the price I cant really justify that. I would rather eat at pinks and pay $7.

Sorry but your hot dogs just suck for the price atleast places like weinerschnitzel knows they arent the best and thats how they price it out.

Good hot dogs here. I have had the regular hot dog topped with sauerkraut and a cheese hot dog and both get my recommendation. I haven't had the fries so I can comment on that.

Also their lemon drink is quite tasty and compliments the fries and wieners.
