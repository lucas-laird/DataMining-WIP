This was our second visit.  Our first encounter was also unpleasant. My husband received an order that was very spicy, but initially told it was not hot!  When he questioned the waitress she told him the order before must have been spicy.  The wok was wiped out, but there ""must have been residue!  They did not offer him a replacement or an apology.  I shared my Chicken Cashew with him and we did not want to create a conflict.  The restaurant is small and there were several other customers.

Why did we return?  We are new to the area and this place was recommended by a neighbor.  We thought if we reviewed what occurred on our first visit, we would not have any problems.  The waitress told us ""too bad, most people like spicy food!""

We had a big problem!  I was served the chicken cashew.  Immediately, when I opened the styrofoam box it smelled burnt.  I did not want to complain so I added the brown rice.  There was a mild smell and tasted ""edgy.""  My husband was served his order, a noodle combo of chicken and beef.  The chicken was clearly burnt with a strong burnt odor. He brought it to the counter and the woman rambled about the way it is made.  My husband said, ""I can not eat it.""  I saw the burnt chicken and smelled the
contents.  I thought it is either the burnt chicken or bad meat.

After arguing, the woman asked if he wanted something else.  He ordered Cashew Chicken!  It too had a similar odor.  The flavor was different than mine?  He did not eat it, threw it away and we left! 

What is our recourse for this poor service and burnt or spoiled food!  We are 
still experiencing the after-taste.",o8Xvw9W5OqzirWIdk3d6JQ,0,0,1,jk9mBCdNdm8hQgaumFHWIw

So I walk in and look over my options. Their theme here is Chinese/Thai fusion. I see that they have lunch specials which is always good for peeps like me who appreciates decent food at decent prices. If you refer to my pic, the lunch specials are from open to 4 pm everyday. Choose an item from the list along with either Lo Mein, Steamed Rice, or Fried Rice. You also have an extra side option from a Vegetable Egg Roll, Cream Cheese Won Tons, or Soup (Egg Drop, Hot n Sour or Won Ton).

I went with the Orange Chicken (typical right?), Fried Rice, and Hot n Sour Soup from the 5.75 list. Keep in mind a drink is not included but I got water and it was definitely from their tap.

First off, I gotta say that the Hot n Sour Soup was excellent! Not too salty or bland and enough ingredients to round out the taste. It was steaming hot!

As for the entree, the Orange Chicken was crispy and the orange tang to it was good. Only thing I noticed was that some of contents could of been more consistent meat portion instead of extra batter.

Now for the Fried Rice. Wow. No, not the good kind of wow. The what the heck just happened wow. The Fried Rice was not the typical fried rice I was used to. There was like nothing in it. You know like peas, carrots, onions, etc. It seemed like they put a couple drops of soy sauce and mixed in a quarter of an egg. It didnt have much flavor to it. 

Total I paid was $6.20 including tax. I left a dollar tip on the table for the service was ok.   If it wasnt for the Hot n Sour Soup being so good, this would of easily been 2 stars. At least the the above mentioned was edible. Maybe next time I will just go with a large bowl of soup. Either that or risk trying another entree in hopes that the cook was just having a bad day at the time. Either way, I will update accordingly.

4225397,2017-03-23,0,px2l_fl2_LlVthj50T7o2g,"Hi Everyone,

With high hopes of finding a better Chinese delivery restaurant than China-A-Go-Go and China AAA, we tried China Joe's on Eastern for the first time on 3/9/17. We had every intention of posting a positive review for our first delivery, but never got the chance as we placed our second order on 3/21/17. Our first experience on 3/9 was pretty good with the exception of the 45 minute delivery wait time. 

We ordered 2 individual dinner boxes at $8.25 each, which includes 1-choice of rice or lo mein noodles,  1-side  dish and 1-choice of entree. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken while I ordered Kung Po Shrimp, which cost $1.00 extra [for shrimp]. China Joe's did not disappoint and made a great first-impression with [their] tasty egg rolls and lo mein noodles. 

We ordered again on 3/21/2017 - this time around I ordered Kung Po Chicken and my husband ordered Teriyaki Chicken. We both ordered the lo mein and added 1 full order of egg rolls to include extra dipping and soy sauce, with an emphasis on ""dont forget to bring chopsticks"".

Unfortunately, our entire meal was a BIG disappointment. The egg rolls were ice cold and ""blah"" tasting - blah, blah, blah... AND the chicken on both entrees was so tough that we had to chew, chew, and keep chewing just to get thru our meals lol. We only ate enough to satisfy ""our hunger pangs"", then threw the rest away in the garbage can -  which meant, NO Chinese leftovers for breakfast or lunch the following day - a total bummer :(. Also, my driver forgot to bring our chopsticks, IS a big part of the dining experience in my opinion. 

We did not bother to call and complain. To be frank, I am growing very tired of the lack of consistency and subpar food when it comes to delivery and takeout dining. We've decided to simply move past this bad experience and continue our quest to find a suitable Chinese restaurant that delivers quality food in our area.

Since our first dining experience with China Joe's was favorable, we gave them 2 stars. As for our 2nd visit, we reluctantly give China Joe's 1 star as the Yelp site does not offer patrons the ability to rate a company at zero stars or below.   

[Post script] -  I just learned that China Joe's uses third-party delivery companies such as GrubHub to deliver its food orders. Since I live only a few blocks away, it now makes sense why both deliveries took over 45-minutes for delivery.",R1rSIg-W14f3UDATQ-bWZQ,0,0,2,nJj-AXZ0tLqbp2cW-d0hyg

Fast forward to now. China Joe's has gone through ownership changes and they haven't had Curry Chicken on the lunch special menu for several years. As a result, I pretty much never go there anymore. For some reason, I decided to get lunch there today. Being a General Tso's Chicken fan, I went with that ($5.25). It smelled amazing as I was driving back to the office, but when I opened the container, it just looked off. The sauce for the chicken was way too dark, like they just threw a ton of soy sauce into the mix. It actually tasted OK, but definitely not like the GTC I was hoping for. Appearance affects taste almost as much as smell and something just didn't seem right in my mind.

It may be unfair to dismiss them based on one dish, but I don't think I'll be returning (at least for another few years). In a way, I'm glad. Having one less option to choose from makes the lunch decision ever-so-slightly easier.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,6,3,2,eC4T4BH3B1zkn4JSr6DW_A

On previous visits the spicy eggplant was tasty. The wonton soup could of used an additional wonton or two.

You have to wait awhile for your delivery order from almost everywhere (except chains like Pizza Hut and they have a lot of money to just comp assholes like you fishing for free food free shit). They're all about quality AND QUANTITY here. It's a family owned and ran business. This place is truly a hidden gem. This location on eastern only, not the other China Joe's. Sadly, they get mixed up with the other locations sometime and the other locations are not as good. 

I love the service here, very different Asian restaurant environment. It's family owned and operated and they take the time to get to know their customers. The food is also amazing, I LOVE their Thai food! 

They can even make any dish vegan/gluten free!!! Also big portion. Very good quality AND quantity. 

Any bad reviews are probably from the previous owners. Give this place a try, you will love them!",eqwlKcJOy2yTNszoJGY-nQ,0,0,5,GXbrGeyIqgvdGgizxmp7Gw

I finally found China Joe's and couldn't be more thrilled. The service is great, and since we order the same items every week on the same day, the owner just says ""I know you, it'll be ready in 15 minutes"".... love it!

Wonton soup was okay and that's about it. Took forever to make our food. My strong guess is that the chef is not trained in cooking whatsoever.,tv5suOREoF8PVA5mtFWYmQ,2,2,1,bg0WhU0FUezb0lc3oM2c4w

The next time and Last COLD food egg rolls were nasty, we even ordered and extra order of egg rolls, but you only get TWO. Chicken teriyaki was tough as a cheap steak and ICE COLD, inedible food and no flavor the second time. Although I thought the food was good the first time, even though it took 1 hour to deliver, the second time it was nasty, cold and the good egg rolls from the first time were empty piles of mush this time. SAVE YOUR MONEY, even china a GO GO is better if you can believe that. They have some real problems with delivery and food preparation. You need some focus folks, maybe a better GM or District Manager would help. NASTY, TASTLESS TRASHY COLD food, If you order and you get trash, do not bother to call them, you will not get a hospitable response, or your money returned, or have them come back and pick the nasty food up and replace it

I work 2 minutes from this location. No apologies, no remorse. They did not give a single fuck.

I ordered the Pad Thai  with some potstickers and usually have a hard time finding a place with good pad Thai, but they make it with a really good seasoning and huge portion sizes for what you pay for. All their pricing is very reasonably priced. 

They have over 50 menu items that you can choose from including soup, salads, chicken wings, party packs for events, kids menu, and lunch specials. Found out the staff is actually from Thailand so they have a variety of authentic Thai food options you can choose from aside from the Chinese food. 

You have the option to dine-in or take-out. Nice, clean seating area. Overall great place and definitely recommend if you're looking for some good food in vegas!",YwbBk29LlXMukwLLGCKibg,1,0,5,zaYK1i-esUBIoxp3dDkpjA
