I'm from LA and brown so Mexican away from home is rarely an option. Alas, I gave in and very happy not to be regretting it right now. There is no veggie option on the menu but the se√±or making me a burrito made it veggie and delicious. Affordable too!",_ukUrj4glYJm1EKH3DhnYQ,4,4,5,SclQjGtHb3S7wgFaHK_UlA

2972343,2017-07-28,4,mrjhrTycW0iLumjMZCfrzw,It's a tough business when your combining with the greatest chefs and restaurants in the world... But the location in MGM is always going to be healthy. So the authenticity of Mexican food in a food court is always taken with a grain of salt (btw... As some salt people). The tacos were decent and the black beans and rice were also tasty. I'd come here again since the price was nice for the portions provided.,bXF9Fu9VHeKqYq1dMgSsJg,0,0,3,UfNdcommelwUMF43nFTm5Q
3207792,2017-06-16,0,mrjhrTycW0iLumjMZCfrzw,"Food quality not that great. Ordered the carne asada bowl. But their carne asada was more like ground beef. Meat was very salty and way too much beans.. the beans overpowered everything.

Their shrimp bowl is very lemony and salty. Flavor isn't balanced with the portions of rice and lettuce and beans.",s0NBkrdCgbhiF6nA3Vouww,1,2,2,h0dSn5eqqFnE7mlRwtSESQ

I tried to explain 'check-in offer' but she kept saying no.
There is no manager. You will never get this offer.",YKkdz0BYSlB67lXOcnxHQA,0,0,1,QIfBHERNLXvveFow84GRfg
3752570,2016-08-05,2,mrjhrTycW0iLumjMZCfrzw,"Staying nearby for a convention, we saw this place on Yelp and were impressed with the reviews. When we got to Ellis Island, it was kind of a sketchy place with way too loud music. The taco place was a tiny counter service joint. We ordered two tacos, chips and salsa and horchatas and proceeded to eat at one of the three dirty high top tables. The tacos were ok, horchatas were meh and the salsa was just cut up tomatoes. After this lackluster meal, we were in the bathroom all night with horrible stomach pains. Not recommended.",9BeTUOvI9VTLpHohmW1gJQ,1,1,2,pJ24hv8Od_0MUWu0h6T3kg

The portion was HUGE for $7, and you're free to peruse the casino with burrito in hand. If that's not a burrito to rule all burritos, then I don't know what is.",wxJqS9RpBh7l1CbC3HD9Sg,8,7,4,XxPHuc8D43vTjgGv0DhywA
