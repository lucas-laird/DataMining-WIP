Service was spot on upon walking in, I was immediately recognized as new, asked what I needed when the first opportunity arose, and made it clear that I was the pickup order. It was checked on at the bartenders first opportunity, and while she was in there, another bartender came to make sure that I was being taken care of. I was told the order would be 2 more minutes, sat down at a table away from the bar to wait, and was approached by the waitress. These girls are on the ball for fast service. Once the food arrived, I went to work and started eating. The steaks were a good cut, cooked as specified, and tasted great. I admit, I did not have high expectations of a good steak there, but this place did not disappoint. If the drinks are made as well as the food, I'd give this place 5 stars. Only reason I did not here was because I wasn't drinking. I imagine if I went there to relax and drink, I'd bump the rating to 5 stars, though.

I had the cutest bartender, Faryn. She was so sweet and helpful that I think it's my favorite go to bar in Spring Valley.

I want to thank my fellow Las Vegas yelpers for reviewing this great find. The Bar@ Trop and Durango is a great place with great service and great food. It is a great place to watch a sports event. They have a lot of beers on tap....good beers!

I had a pint of Newcastle Brown Ale and a pint of Guinness. Actually they have two sizes 16oz and 22 oz..I thought prices were really good.

The food here is actually really good as well. I had the Jalapeño Burger which was really really good. Good meat on a good bun with great toppings:  pepper jack cheese , bacon, guacamole, 1000 island, brioche bun. 

The other bar food looked really good as well!

I saw The Bar so I figured I had over an hour to kill I'd grab something to eat while I waited. When I walked in I noticed a bar full of Tv's which is great for Sunday football (I asked the bartender if they show all the games, and yes they do!) 

When I sat down, I was immediately approached and asked what I'd like to drink and if I cared for a menu. Looking through their menu and I was stumped on what to get, everything sounded so good!! The bartender Amanda (I remembered because That's my name) was super helpful and suggested the edamame as an app and prime rib sandwich, as it's been a staple on their menu. The edamame was so good and the prime rib dip was beyond my expectations. I didn't know a ""bar"" would have this good of food. 

I must have been in between shifts, because two new bartenders came on and Amanda asked if I needed anything before she left. I said no and shortly after she walked away a blonde bartender Faryn came by to check and see if I needed anything and introduced herself and her coworker Lindsay. I stayed for about 45 Mins until I had to leave and watching these girls mingle around and get to every person who walked in was pretty impressive. This place is very on point. From cleanliness, to delicious eats, and friendly staff, you can expect to see me again, and I'm coming back to try those fried Oreos!

I had the opportunity to have Eric as my bartender and he treated me like a King.  In fact, I'm still amazed at how good the food is.  Guess what, I haven't touched a drink.

I was unaware that ""The Bar"" was actually a chain in town so I read up on the one by Grand Canyon Drive.  This new location is the closest bar to my house so we had high hopes it would be decent enough to become semi-regulars.  

I had never been to this bar when it was previously Bootleg Benny's but the place was completely redone according a patron I talked to and it definitely shows.  The setup is right up there with an above average video poker bar with a few more choices for food than just wings and burgers.  

Happy hour consisted of $2 Bud Light, Michelob Ultra and well drinks.  I was hoping for some food deals but no dice.  Thanks to Rich W's review of The Bar on Grand Canyon, I got the prime rib sandwich which totally delivered.  Nice juicy slices of prime rib topped with deep fried jalapeno slices and horseradish but the real kicker was how good the bun was.  My wife got the turkey avocado wrap but for some reason they forgot to put in the avocado so they sliced up half of one and brought it on a plate afterwards.  That was tasty as well since the turkey was roasted and cubed instead of just being your run of the mill deli meat.

The machines were also kind enough to bestow a couple of quads to us which took care of our bill.  The TV's were pretty good so I will definitely be back to watch a few games.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,12,7,4,fiIoYFL_XF5is60ynZ4Kcw
