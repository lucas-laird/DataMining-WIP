Located on the far north end of the 168 plaza, it is almost a hole in the wall restaurant. They are a quaint little restaurant with not many tables. The waitress who helped us seemed to only speak mandarin so we just went with that. This place offers a decent variety of stuff with a decent amount of the usual sichuan dishes you come to expect

Since we were only 2 people, we only got a few dishes to try. More of the more kind of dishes including cumin lamb, stir-fried water spinach w/ fermented bean curd, and something that seemed like a specialty, spicy pot pork intestines. 

First to come out was the spicy pot pork intestines. Served in a clay pot (most likely not cooked in it), there are a good amount of sliced pork intestines mixed with tons of soybean sprouts, potato?, lotus root, glass noodles, dried chilis, and grounded sichuan peppercorns. For those who dont know about sichuan cuisine, they love using their peppercorns that give that distinct ""Ma"" flavor. What ""ma"" means is numb. Sichuan cuisine does Ma and La. Numb and Spicy. What i did not realize is they had used so much of this peppercorns and grounded it into this. Makes it kind of unavoidable ! Apparently you can request for less, didn't know that either. Flavor wise, this dish was really good. Good depth of flavor with the savory, spicy, numbing

Next to come out was the cumin lamb. The lamb was different than what other places uses. Thicker slices of lamb which was very fatty and juicy. What was a bit lacking was the cumin flavor. Would have preferred to have more cumin flavor. The peppers used were pretty spicy as well. Maybe can request to have more cumin used xD 

Last was the stir-fried water spinach (ong choy). Learned something new recently. Never knew ong choy was called water spinach. I dont think they use the ""water"" version. I don't really know how to explain it but i know my family tends to ask if its water grown.. i guess the other type might be soil grown? DONT KNOW ! But i do know the water version, the ""tubes"" are much larger than the normal version (type youd see in super markets). The water type tends to be more tender and lighter in color vs the other type which requires some more picking. Flavor was good overall. Fermented soybean is a popular style to cook this in. Wished there was garlic and sliced thai chilis in it too XD 

Overall, all the items were really tasty. Do hope to bring my family here soon. My family loves to eat spicy foods, having tried almost all the other similar style restaurants in town.

Unfortunately due to unforeseen events, i believe they are permanently closed due to a fire from the furniture store next door. They did do well with their dishes.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,4,6aVBJckEQ5kJTM4eI5PPYw

3260937,2017-10-28,1,HXJLOVSnv6X_b3mEQYWhEA,"A newly opened Sichuan restaurant in a really convenience location with plenty of parking spot, which means I must go try.
My first impression is it's so clean. So I believe if the outside is so clean then  the kitchen inside must be clean too. 
I ordered kung Pao chicken and tofu dishes because a long time ago, a chef from Sichuan told me to try the basic Sichuan food as a kind of measure for good or bas. It passed my tongue test.
Price-wise and size-wise I think it is just fine with me. It differs from others in that the chicken or fish were cut in bigger pieces, so I do not have to pick the plate to look for fish or chicken.
Finally the desert: black sesame mochi ball soup was so delicious and not that sweet. There are so many mochi balls inside the soup compared to other places. If you do not like the soup with egg flower you can order this desert soup without eggs. 
Anyway. So .....yummy",sf6lSFna7_QluIjw-NpRpQ,2,1,5,UzdC012U9tXXTwrmTqn53w
3442603,2017-11-28,0,HXJLOVSnv6X_b3mEQYWhEA,"Heard about this Szechuan restaurant finally got to come here with some friends for dinner.  They have a variety of items on their menu like pork intestines, fried fish, orange chicken,lamb and a variety of vegetable dishes to choose from. 
We ordered the fish with sweet and sour sauce which is absolutely amazing along with the pork intestines and watercress  veggies, the portions were big enough for two or even three people the whole meal was absolutely delicious. The service was also excellent and their prices are very reasonable. So if you are looking for a great restaurant with spicy food come give them a try. They are located in the same shopping center as 168. I will definitely be returning to this place again.",yN4_omG3SfhS1rDPVN3eEQ,2,0,5,AR_CWErqId_dWQxTGkJNzQ

They have a lot of the typical Szechuan menu items like spicy pot pork intestines, cumin lamb, as well as a large variety of spicy and non-spicy dishes.

I was really impressed by the fried fish in sweet and sour sauce. Not sure if this is really Szechuan but it was perfect for my (Americanized) taste buds. The sauce is one part of it but the fish happened to be fried perfectly and the coating was crispy while not being heavy.

We also ordered spicy pot pork intestines but I don't actually eat intestines so I can't say if they are good or not.

For veggies, we got water spinach in bean curd. Not much to say about it but it was good.

Prices are very reasonable here. I didn't see anything expensive and even a 14 dollar plate of fish could be shared among 2 or 3 people.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,1,5,qP0FKTo7XKv74FVQAhx3jA
3978512,2017-11-09,1,HXJLOVSnv6X_b3mEQYWhEA,"Came here craving spicy food and didn't disappointed at all! What a hidden gem, I had a little late lunch today around 2pm. Being the new restaurant in the same shopping center with 168 market, I already expected the place to not be so busy since they still have to building their reputation. And who knows there were so many restaurants near by. 
Restaurant was cleaned and bright small in the front but deeper with 48 seats capacity. 

Our waitress was very friendly and super sincere about her recommendations. I found out later from my receipt that her name is Lu Wang. 
I ordered 3 dishes and all of them were so good. 
Cuming Lamb $13.99 was one of my favorite today. Also Boiled Fish in spicy soup $13.99 definitely spicy and Wonton non spicy version $6.99 was so delicious because the broth was so tasty and not salty like many places. 
Their portion was big and with two people and three dishes, we couldn't finished them. 

I wish I had some room for dessert but no. 
Give it a try or just stopping by and get some food to go. I'm sure you will love it.",gJFC6DaM5guitce6FSFYxw,1,1,5,rpjrF0w9OrFVs7ANxvs8SA

5349157,2017-11-29,1,HXJLOVSnv6X_b3mEQYWhEA,"I love trying new restaurants! I heard about this new restaurant a while ago but I haven't had the time to go until last night! I went with my friend and my husband to try the new place out!

It's in the same plaza as 168 but on the opposite side of the plaza -- near the far end. Spicy Moment is a quaint little establishment. It's not that big and it doesn't have the hustle and bustle of some of the other busy sichuan restaurants in the city but I kind of like it that way. It's not too noisy and perfect for a dinner. 

Their menu has a good amount of variety to it. Beware though -- like many traditional sichuan or szechuan cuisine, they are famous for their ""mala"" flavors aka the numbing spice. Dun dun dun! It's suffice to say that if you order anything spicy, it'll come with numbing peppercorns so if you don't want a lot of them, let them know!

We decided to order their spicy pot with pig intestines, deep fried fish fillet with a sweet and sour sauce, water spinach (ong choy) with beancurd, and we also got their lemon ice tea drink to try! 

I told the waitress that I didn't like the numbing spice very much so she told the chef not to put that many peppercorns into the spicy pot! Woooo! Winner server right there! I know, I could've ordered something else but I just can't resist intestines! I love the fattiness! It was delicious .. it had mung bean sprouts, vermicelli, cauliflower, and some slices of lotus root with the intestines! It had a good amount of spicy but not too much. Don't be freaked out with how much pepper they use! It's not as spicy as it looks! 

The fish fillet may seem a bit americanized and it probably is but it was really delicious. The fish fillets were fried perfectly and it didn't even seem like it was too oily at all. The sauce is like an orange sauce so it's like orange fish fillet? Haha. 

I absolutely loved the ong choy with beancurd. It's actually my favorite veggie so it's hard for me not to like it. The beancurd was not overpowering at all, which is great cause some people may not be too fond of the fermented taste. What I liked best was that they cut the veggie up into smaller pieces so the veggies aren't going to splatter everywhere when you're pulling at it! It had a great aroma and perfect amount of flavor aka perfect amount of salt. 

Oh ... you have got to try their lemon iced tea! It's in a bottle and according to the server, it's a really popular drink in China! I normally don't like anything too sugary and anything packaged that says ""lemon iced tea"" is diabetes in a can. However! This one isn't bad at all! Even my husband likes it! He rarely likes lemon iced tea hahaha. 

Overall, great food. Great service! My water cup was constantly refilled! You definitely need that when you're eating spicy food. The price isn't that bad either -- it's actually pretty similar pricing to places like Yunnan Garden or Chengdu. I definitely don't mind coming back here ... will have to bring more friends so I can try more dishes!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,1,5,dJEC9yq8EYZ1DBwbRDesbA
5735042,2017-12-24,0,HXJLOVSnv6X_b3mEQYWhEA,"One visit only and I know I will be back again, very soon. Located in the 168 Market Plaza, it's a small place. We had 3 dishes and I loved every single one. I will be suggesting this to my lunch partner tomorrow and get one of their noodle dishes to try. 

We had cumin lamb, spicy pot pork intestines, and white spinach with fermented bean curd. If you want steamed rice, they give you a pot but there is a charge. The entrees run around the $14 range. Our total bill was about $44 for all 3. 

I did order take out the next day for noodle dishes for work but wasn't as impressed with them as my in-restaurant experience. Maybe it's the food or maybe because it's takeout but I'll probably stick to dine-in visits now. Definitely want to try the rest of their menu to see how they impress.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,5,_mryQz8mL8DKZ25ofT91ow
