I asked for the turkey bacon ranch that comes on the ciabatta bread and the girl told me they don't use that bread. She asked the owner and the owner said yes they do. So then we always hey no sweetners and no sugar, once we drank our smoothies they tasted very sweet. I asked what they use to make it sweet and the owner said juice. So a few minutes later I decided to order another one because mine was to sweet. I asked the girl at the register to not use juice and only use water, she told me she cannot do that. 
Not sure why she can't make a change and just add water. Ridiculous!! I have always enjoyed the owner, she is a hard worker, but this new staff is clueless.

After getting a can of whoop-a$$ from Patricia's Kettlebell class down the road at LVAC, this has been our spot to fuel up.

Their smoothies hit the spot, and I don't have a particular favorite just yet...I'd rather go down their menu and try different ones until I find ""the one"". Another great option is their $6.99 deal of your choice of smoothie with either a small salad or half a sandwich.

We are both fans of their Turkey and Dried Cranberry sandwich, so that deal works perfectly for us! Fast, cheap healthy, and delicious! What's not to love!?!? ALOHA!

4147588,2015-03-11,0,UGy0QULAPPRcOUJQSiRmGQ,"I came here one morning after driving by the night before, receiving a coupon flier in the mail that day, and seeing a commercial later that night.  I took it as a sign.  Plus, they were advertising a new limited edition smoothie.  The Avocolada.  That is a smoothie with avocada, kale, coconut and pine apple.  It sounded pretty good aside from the kale.  But there is enough other stuff to hide that, right.  And the avocado should make for an ultra creamy smoothie.  The coconut will provide a good shot of sweetness.  The pine apple will off set that with a bit of acidity.  This is going to be great, I think to myself.

Well, the first thing I notice when I walk in the door at Tropical Smoothie is the total lack of anybody manning the cash register.  The sign said open but there did not seem to be anybody there.  After several minutes I caught the attention of a line cook in the back.  He got the cashier up to the front.  Meanwhile I notice that the place smells funky. I don't know like what. The place didn't look dirty so I decided to stay.  Besides, I needed breakfast. I was already running behind and did not want to try to find somewhere else.  After a few minutes of watching my smoothie made I was on the road with a smoothie in tow.  

I waited until I was in the car to try out this new Avocolada concoction.  The first sip led to instant straw colapse.  I've had thinner milk shakes.  It was almost impossible to drink.  I actually got so much suction the straw stuck to my lip.  I felt like I had a fat lip for about the next hour.  It was still colapsing straws two hours later.  Crazy.  And it did not taste anything like what I expected.  I was hard pressed to find the coconut and pine apple. I could pick up hints of the avocado but mostly it was the kale that I noticed.  It took me a while to pick out what was off about this.  All I could say is that it tasted green.  Like under ripe strawberries or the leafy top of the same.  Finally, I realized I was reminded of the chlorophyll I used to take.  That could only be one thing.  Kale.

I took a chance and was let down.  They have other smoothies that sound like they would be better than the Avocolada.  If they are and this place in particular can improve their service it may be alright.  For now I'll stick to what I know for my smoothie fix, Jamba Juice.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,1,3,8g2pWY3u_8hoG4Kn8HYRdg

I usually buy a regular size smoothie for myself and ask them to pour some of it into a kids cup for Caden. This time they told me that they cannot pour excess into a kids cup. I said that's fine because I'm not asking for the excess I just want them to pour some of my cup into a kids cup. When I went to get my cup they just gave me an extra little styrofoam cup on the side for me to pour my drink into. Which was fine for me but then none of the lids fit on it and we were getting it to go.  So I asked for a kids cup that I can put a lid on and they said that they couldn't give me one. They said they couldn't give me one for excess. I think they don't know the meaning of excess. Because it's not excess if it's pouring from my own drink that I purchased.  I thought this was hilarious. I feel like they don't know what it's like to have a kid. Kids spill drinks and so of course I want a lid for my sons drink. I paid more for a big size so I don't think it should be an issue. I know can pay less for a kids size. It's just that a reg size is more than enough for me and I share everything with Caden. I honestly don't think I'll be coming here again and will just make my own smoothies at home.,b8LcQa2X_s9OfIKZaUl5Nw,0,0,1,UX0t5WpgMWH596XKbQOj1g

I normal am not a confrontational person but this guys ignorance was just irritating and I hate when people assume things when they have no idea what they are talking about. In the end I got my free birthday smoothie...luckily the younger girl who works there was a lot more polite and I tipped her since she was the one who made the smoothie for me an apologized for her ignoranant manager she even had tried explaining to him that this was still good it just looked like that because it started to get low on ink.,ShPDBEGOPMTP3LyVT5nMqw,1,0,1,1A9AeyhLueG4SYnFDLEqpQ

The quality of food at this Tropical Smoothie is above average - it's good.  The presentation is nicely done. The food tastes good.  The owner - and wrap/sandwich maker - takes pride in putting the wraps and sandwiches together.  I will give him that.  I don't want to say that he is SLOW, but it is obvious that it's busy enough that there needs to be 2 to 3 additional food preparers.  I understand that the owner saves in operational costs by not hiring additional help, but the service suffers because of it.  After being disappointed on several occasions, I am finally deciding that I will not spend my time or money at this location.  I am bothered that he finds it acceptable to see customers wait 15 to 25 minutes.  At those waiting times, I might as well go to sit-down restaurant.

Note:  The smoothies are prepared a bit faster.  There are typically 3 smoothie makers on staff.",GrcKDbd_Qsium2hE4hexiQ,1,0,3,OFbfe1-84j_7BfkQHjw3QQ

Customer service is great, 15 minutes to get food fresh made and we'll as a made to order smoothie is not bad on time. The girls who work there are always friendly.",t7TiT2MGG1AMnotGfXtfOg,1,0,3,xdEjRG8J3MQDAnXSF8bPgA
