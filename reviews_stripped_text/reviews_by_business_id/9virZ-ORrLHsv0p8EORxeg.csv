71248,2016-05-09,0,9virZ-ORrLHsv0p8EORxeg,The ice cream for our blizzards was served at a temperature that was warmer than normal.  The worker put kids on the blizzards before she brought them out and did not turn them upside down to demonstrate the thickness.  I'm positive this was done because she knew they were delivering a substandard product.  My dipped cone was oozing down the side as soon as it was handed over to me.  This was a disappointing experience.,KRk-wzVvtJ0OfGiDWNX1dA,0,0,1,bsCx4nrql89UVLRQdI0lDQ
297298,2015-09-12,0,9virZ-ORrLHsv0p8EORxeg,"The quality and organization of the DQ is disconcerting to say the least. I would not visit this DQ except for proximity. I have asked for an Oreo blizzard with extra Oreo every time. 70 % of the time the blizzard is partially melted and 50% of the time the extra Oreo is not added. In order to insure proper service, it is recommended to go in and order. Do not use the drive through. Every time that I have used the drive through, the order has always been wrong or under serviced, such as getting partially melted ice cream.

* Poor service
* Partially melted ice cream
* Incorrect orders are frequent

Do yourself a favor, do not visit this DQ if you have another close by.",dEEY1G77kPJKcUQFz_WZYw,0,0,2,EFK8rty7ffc77V_eSXbskA

Looks like I should have just stayed in the Drive-Thru line because they're not going to get served until everyone in the Drive-Thru line does.

In total I have been here for 20 min and I got back some totally melted blizzards and ice cream that I sent it back and now I have been waiting for my large blizzard.

My strawberry blizzard was only half mixed. The last two inches were vanilla ice cream. Also there were Oreo chunks in it and surprising the family before me got Oreo blizzards.. clean your machines.

Sometimes you'll get that one employee who actually cares about their job and will hustle to get your order ready. But then again, it's your typical DQ with young employees just there for a paycheck who could give 2 craps about you. There were times I was in and out within 2 minutes and other times I was there for 10+ minutes. I've seen the shop super clean and I've seen it when there has been napkins all over the floor. I guess it just depends on the day you visit. But whatever though, they have my yummy chocolate dipped cone and it's close to my house.

3219417,2017-07-09,1,9virZ-ORrLHsv0p8EORxeg,"Bummer.  Sux when you have a place you just can no longer go back to , just out of principle; since the employee who's in charge just has no idea how to handle customer service.

We've been here dozens of times with our six kids.  We always get kids cops with sprinkles for the younger kids.  This time, after our large order for 10, we found that the kids cups were WAY smaller then they ever have been. Literally there was maybe 1 to 2 teaspoons of ice cream in the bottom of the to-go cup, and maybe a half of teaspoon of sprinkles.  
    No big deal, maybe they made a mistake. So I asked if they would top them off a little bit, and the person in charge tells us,""I don't know what to tell you, that's the size, you can buy larger "".  So either they're really terrible at consistency, because the last two dozen times it was probably three times that amount of ice cream, or they just have ridiculously small quantities for exorbitant prices for the kids cups. (Over $2)
    We left there saying, we could just go to McDonald's and get ice cream five times that size for over half the price for the kids from now on.
