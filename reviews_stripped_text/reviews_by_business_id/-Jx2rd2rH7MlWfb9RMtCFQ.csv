They were out of soda and we ended up having to get a refund for our food because we waited over 30 minutes and no one in front of us had gotten there food yet either. The refund took about 10 minutes because no one in the truck knew how to do that either. It would be faster to go sit down at an actual restaurant to eat.,d418o9CfH0VCIMu6En2mdg,2,0,1,BkpWd-8c_jtDpBKjlwJWig

Then took an HOUR to prepare some of the worst Egg Tacos !! They didn't have a menu, no choice, just handed out some under cooked tortillas with scrambled eggs and salsa. This looked like the kind of breakfast you make in 5 minutes, and you run out the door with, not anything that took an hour to Prep.  One co-worker actually tried to eat them, and they tasted horrible. To top it all off, the cook, had the audacity to get in my bosses face because, this was not what was promised or agreed to. I would NOT recommend this truck to anyone, nor would I ever use them again. HORRIBLE FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE.",Iema55hDH8Opf4ya2fh6rg,4,1,1,kdc2sBPnxmLxWtsjquwG_w
1015320,2015-04-23,0,-Jx2rd2rH7MlWfb9RMtCFQ,So the Kraken Cafe Food Truck came to Tivoli today. I figured  I give them a try. For $6 starting the menu is not bad. The operation  was 2 people and orders made fresh. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles and the worker said she had to much orders. I remind u they were here for 2 hours. So she ran out. I ordered a chicken strip  plate and grilled cheese plate. Okay but the hype is not all their with this truck. The fries was missing flavor. Yes it was tossed with parm cheese and some herbs but no taste. It was also not crispy. The chicken strip was okay. 3 pieces.  Really lightly  battered. No great taste.  Grilles cheese was was great on a sweet bread type of toast with nice cheese actually  melted. Also no condiments with the order.,dC9pqTxOJ18Zjh6r5otwSA,0,0,2,QS8W33lXB9_AMQ5_Euz12A

Thee worst food truck experience ever.  The service is terrrrrrrible! Shame on you 1hr for two burgers!?  Lots of complaints from everyone. I arrived on a slow day and they were posted up out front of Tenaya Brewing Co. I waited in a very very small line of only 2 people in front of me and even then they were moving super slow. That should have been my signal that this was not going to be a good experience but I was starving so i figured ""meh, whats the worst I could wait? 30 MIns? well it was double that and they gave my food away to someone else. 
I am glad they at least owned their mistake and did offer to make me a new order but after 60 minutes of waiting and you gave a away my food? Enough was enough! 
I think at some point they should have either told people the expected wait times, or stopped taking any more orders.",yCfgnFtmOQijmRzTP3adzw,2,0,1,21JLQy7knlGT8NILzq6h8A

We never actually received our food (1 grilled cheese sandwich & 1 Kraken burger), after waiting in line for more than 30 minutes to order, then another 40 minutes for the order to be cooked, I asked to cancel my order which was never even started.

The man in the Kraken Cafe truck had a menu which left my innards crying out for every item. My husband had the Kraken burger, which I tried and that was really excellent. My bison burger with bacon and the most wonderful fresh brioche bread was a highlight of my 2.5 year life in Las Vegas. The fries are great. 
Seriously: Kraken should be indoors in a free standing, world class cafe while the brewers are outside in a truck! 
I have eaten a lot of good meals since moving here, mostly in small, off Strip world class places. The Kraken Cafe truck is an experience you should not miss.
Look me up: I will be the person with a grilled cheese sandwich dripping from my lips, a bison burger in each hand, and looking heavenward, ecstatic.

This food truck was one of four tonight at Truckin' Tuesday tonight in Providence LV.  I couldn't decide between the Umami and the Salmon Croquette burger so I went with my first choice, the salmon topped with greek aioli, spring mix, tomato and yes, a fried egg  The buns must be homemade and were fresh which sealed the deal.  You also get herb-tossed fries on the side, delish!!

4382774,2015-12-01,0,-Jx2rd2rH7MlWfb9RMtCFQ,"I was able to try this food truck when they were at Crafthaus Brewery on a Saturday night. I love the idea of food trucks stopping at the brewery. The guys even brought our food into us when it was ready. 

They offer about six different burger options including a Bison Burger, Kraken Sandwich (pulled pork), and Unami Burger. Unfortunately, the night we tried them they were out of half of the menu items. Burgers come with French fries and are priced at $10 which seemed reasonable to me for the convenience and portion.

My husband wanted the Bison Burger, but had to go with the Thousand Island Burger when they were out of the bison. He liked his burger, but didn't rave about it. I had the Kraken Sandwich which is pulled pork with a pineapple glaze and coleslaw. The sandwich was good and I liked the flavors together. Both sandwiches were good, but probably not something I would seek out.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,1,3,Dx4PwJZkcv2J6nH3lUSOkw

Their garlic fries are seriously the best!! I gave them a try during an event in Inspirada!

You could taste the freshness right off the grill! the fries were full of flavor from the garlic, Parmesan and salt, they were delightfully crispy on the outside while potato like on the inside! The burger too was also seasoned and grilled perfectly with a lightly toasted bun and fresh lettuce and tomato!!
