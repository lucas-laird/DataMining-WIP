I am writing you at your home address to prevent an employee from intercepting this letter of complaint.  I first noticed your restaurant, Thai Cuisine, 4420 E. Charleston Blvd., suite #5, Las Vegas, Nevada, several months ago while getting a haircut nearby.  I am a 30 year resident of this neighborhood and when I see something new I like to try it.  That night I placed an order to be delivered.  I was very impressed with everything I ordered, quality of ingredients, taste and cooking techniques were excellent.

Now, the reason for this letter.  Last night remembering how good my last experience was with your restaurant, I placed another order to be delivered for a friend and myself.  I ordered 1-Combination Fried Rice, 1-Moo Goo Gai Pan Chicken and 1-Mongolian Beef, total price $27.05, with a $2.00 off coupon.
 
The order was delivered in a good amount of time.  However, the food was a very big disappointment the meat, both chicken and beef in all three dishes was the worst protean we had ever eaten.  Both meats were cut very thick, very over cooked, very dried out, had no taste and had a very hard consistency.  Reminding us of what it would be like eating boiled shoe leather.  We could hardly tell the difference between the chicken and the beef, except for the color.  Needless to say 80% of what we ordered went into the trash.

It is for this reason I will not be ordering from your restaurant again.  Maybe you should think about contacting ""Restaurant Impossible""

     Sincerely,

First off, I ordered my food from Thai Cuisine 2 through the Eat 24 website, which I love because it allows me to order food online through places that don't have a website/app of their own to use. Plus, I don't have to call and talk to someone over the phone and there possibly be something wrong with my order because they heard me wrong.

Second, TC2 is in a shady location, because I live in the ghetto. Well, in my opinion it's not half bad, but if most people ventured here they'd probably be weary. It's located in a strip mall with a Baskin Robbins, right next to a bar off of Charleston and Lamb Blvd.

I doubt I would ever dine-in, but as far as call-in and take-out goes it will do.

Food - I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry at a level of ""Medium"" (that's how you order it online, you get three options only). It was fairly spicy, but not super spicy, so I guess next time I'll just go with ""Hot"". The rice was kind of mooshy, so when I put my curry on it, it got even more mooshy. Eh, not so great. The flavors of the curry were standard, and the chicken was okay, but pretty sub-standard in my book. Veggies were over-cooked and had a limp feeling to them.

With every order (at least when you takeout) you get two complimentary egg rolls, which are just pretty much egg rolls, nothing special and they give you a bevvy of dipping sauces, which is nice.

Overall it's an okay joint. I would not recommened for a trip out to eat and dine, but for a quick pick up it is perfect.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,3,JWHmTf-riQ3aCixKvo6stA
