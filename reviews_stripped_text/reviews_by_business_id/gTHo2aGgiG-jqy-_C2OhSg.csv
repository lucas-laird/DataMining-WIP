They have an awesome assortment of yummy fresh juices like papaya, pineapple, pepino and more. Great salsa bar and They are really generous with their portions. We really liked the Mexican burrito. The chicken fajita plate we ordered was good but I'm Just really picky person about chicken and probably could have used more spices. 

But we will be back for sure :)",MccU5SfeSlSdjCUiq-jn_w,1,0,4,qHcG_YBXGarwt2XEr1Opdg
1178829,2018-03-12,0,gTHo2aGgiG-jqy-_C2OhSg,My new favorite Mexican restaurant!!! First of all the whole menu is very wallet friendly! That off the bat is great. But not only is it fairly priced but believe me when I say it's mega delicious! Best camarones a mojo de ajo I've ever had! My wife had the steak and shrimp fajitas and they were fantastic as well. Will def be returning as regulars! Great start!,x07nHrWUoOhSx2Oz6ea2OA,0,0,5,PkRro6SFNwT7yTvk6h1e9A
1334793,2018-04-06,0,gTHo2aGgiG-jqy-_C2OhSg,"I decided to stop by for a quick lunch break. It works well for me since it's literally less than five minutes away from where I work.

The place is fairly new and kept pretty clean. I enjoyed the decorations, which was suitable for the restaurant. I didn't know exactly what to order but I remembered what dragged me into coming inside was the picture if the carne asada plate that was posted on the front door.

The hostess was nice and rang me up. However she did ask me what kind of dressing I wanted with my salad, what kind of tortillas, etc. I paid in cash but I would definitely have her double check her drawer when she rings up customers just incase she doesn't come up short.

The food was brought to my table, however they forgot the corn tortillas (which I didn't realize until I saw my receipt at the end)

The food was alright, I've had better at different places. I don't necessarily agree with the price of almost $12, especially since that was literally the smallest strip of carne asada I've ever had. Please keep in mind that there was only one strip and yet they over filled it with rice and beans to cover up the plating. The rice and beans tasted like any regular restaurant, so I was used to it, but the meat was bland, fairly cold, and had no flavor.

I ended up eating the rest of my salad with ranch dressing, but be advised that this particular ranch dressing tastes identical as if you were having L&L's macaroni salad. Although I wasn't very fond of it, I still ate it anyways.. I mean, I paid $12 for it right? The chips and salsa were fine, but I don't think I'd recommend this place to any of my friends.",uUzsFQn_6cXDh6rPNGbIFA,3,1,3,iqtyD7CUOHX7FYSovg_T6Q

2592572,2018-06-24,0,gTHo2aGgiG-jqy-_C2OhSg,"First time here, went through the drive-thru. The girl who took my order was just plain rude. I ordered a taco salad. Worst taco salad I had! See picture attached to this review. You can clearly tell the meat was old and over over cooked! It's common sense that you don't serve meat that old. It might as well have been beef jerky. Not ever coming back and will not recommend to any of my friends or family!",NpztTsQMpUHFK9rQNRHCBw,0,0,1,1fJ4_XzSZjEq3bjF0_WIKg
2713174,2018-04-27,0,gTHo2aGgiG-jqy-_C2OhSg,"I was in the mood for a taco salad when the 11.00 am pre-lunch ""munchies"" hit. I found this place... where else? YELP! It was right down the street from my job and had decent reviews.

First impressions: This restaurant is located in the old Arby's across from SeaFood City. The building still looks like an Arby's but the interior has been nicely redecorated. The booths are super comfy.

Menu: very affordable selection of traditional Mexican and Mexican-American cuisine.

Service: Great! Friendly cashiers and food was out in a jiffy.

Food: the taco salad was ok.  Allow me to explain. I know taco salads to come with ground beef.  When I ordered, I was asked what type of protein I wanted in my salad.  The question threw me off a bit. I was given a laundry list of meat selections and none were ground beef so I chose the carne asada.  This was no longer a taco salad but a carne asada salad.  I was in the mood for a taco salad so the dish didn't hit the spot for me.  Otherwise, the dish was decent.

Overall: I'll return to give them a few more tries. I work nearby and it's nice to see a new local eatery nearby.",xSvbDk6TFQoVn9lioHSssA,0,0,3,oxlITbcRBddjLje_xWlhwg
2889461,2018-06-19,0,gTHo2aGgiG-jqy-_C2OhSg,While visiting came to this place since was close by and had Mexican food which my husband was craving. I ordered a Denver omelet which was good. However my husband ordered chilaquiles rojos and he did not enjoy it. They where dried pretty much only top ones where a bit wet. He did enjoyed the guacamole sauce it was a bit spicy and he loves spicy food. Forgot to mentioned that my hashbrown looked it was not well cooked. Also got two tacos one pastor and carnitas which my husband ate and did not share but he did not enjoyed either. Had ordered my food to go.,EWNKmLce5uhP1BjtHdmbfg,0,0,3,MW9PmVqzcVFeHxj4xXXp9g

It was like a thin hard corn bread with condense milk.

I ordered ceviche which I find hard to come by in Vegas.  I also tried the free tacos  (chicken); both were very good.  The atmosphere was casual and service was good.  I liked that their sign to order was large and easy to read.  
I will definitely return.  Good food good price.  Dig it?",zmFRHyeRAGagONM5hyVWeg,5,3,4,H84B1oykRgfrM8z3Nnd89g

The aguas frescas are good and free refills, love that option. The rest of the items look delicious as well, will be back to try the rest. The only criticism I have would be about the service. The cashier that helped us out didn't seem too happy being there or taking our order. This restaurant is just opening I would advice management to discuss the importance of great customers upon their employees.
