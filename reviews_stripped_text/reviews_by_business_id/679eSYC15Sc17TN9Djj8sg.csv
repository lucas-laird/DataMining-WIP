16461,2012-10-08,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"I work in Town Square.  I Love Burgers is an attractive option for my co-workers and I because of a hefty 40% discount.  That being said, I can understand some of the negative opinions of this place because it would be too expensive to eat here with any kind of regularity.

What I like about this place is the variety of burgers and you get a generous sized patty.  Unlike most fast food burger places, I feel full eating a burger without having to get fries.  My favorite burger at this place is the BBQ Burger - bacon, onion straws, american cheese, and bbq sauce.  On the downside, I don't like the butter-brushed bun, but it's a minor quibble.

The milkshakes they offer are excellent.  The blueberry panshake is my current favorite.

Overall, the food is good, but unless you work in Town Square, you're probably better off just going to Five Guys or In-N-Out.",IPYbq_wHyg5rQllDHkebtg,0,0,4,UagEa6iUqaERYxeL97kbZQ
28602,2015-03-06,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,So I showed up at 7:45pm tonight. Place looked closed from the outside but they are open until 10pm. Must say my food was great and have no complaints. However they seemed to be closing the place up by 8:15pm. They closed up the soda machine so you couldn't get refills. Then when I went up to grab a shake I was told that they had cleaned up the machine already. Wow!  Confused they are open for another hour and 40 minutes. Not very buisness friendly no wonder they were empty. Probably won't go back due to service.,RTgAV9y4f_dg2-9XkqiMLw,0,0,2,wPAXBvsUpS34w1y-agfIDA

No, the service is not amazing (bachi is downright traumatizing), but the burgers come out as-ordered, every time.

The burger was super greasy and overcooked. There was no option for how how I wanted it cooked, so I guess that's how everyone's burger must be. My boyfriend and I both got an I love bacon burger and the burger was lacking in bacon. We shared truffle fries... Which should not be a dollar extra because you can barely taste the truffle in the fries. 

Overall, it's overpriced for what you really get... They seem to spend more money decorating the place in cool chairs, paint, and televisions than they did on developing a good burger.",nfvtDLuHSvSIa1RFFG3QeQ,0,0,2,NY_q7LGCcVcgdNtqL7GkUw

I first noticed that most of the burgers are priced about the same.  This makes it a lot easier to order a burger with more ""stuff"" on it without having to worry about paying more for it.  

I had the BBQ Bacon burger.  It was okay, didn't seem to taste like much.  More BBQ sauce would have done it for me.  Fries were good, although the tots were better.

We came on a Tuesday so to the Buy One Get One Free burger deal was a nice surprise.

He ordered the caprese burger. Although he liked my burger better, he said they were both great. 

I got regular fries, he got truffle. I wish the truffle fries had a garnish on top of some sort. The taste was great, though. 

We also shared a strawberry milkshake. It was good, but I think I'll try something else next time.

197798,2012-09-07,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, so when we saw a meet up group was scheduled to try this place out, we decided to sign up. I haven't found my perfect burger joint in Las Vegas yet, and I was hoping this would be it. 

Not so much. 

The restaurant itself has a good atmosphere.  Chalk boards on the wall that you can leave messages on give it a nice cozy touch.  There is a bar area that you can get alcohol at if you wish, however, the rest of the restaurant is a very family oriented environment.  A walk up counter where you place your order gives the restaurant an additional casual feel. 

Unfortunately, the hamburgers themselves are just not that good.  To begin with, the menu only offers about 6 different burger options.  The woman across the table from me had ordered the ""caprese"" burger, which was supposed to be a twist on a caprese salad.  Which is actually a cool idea.  A generous slice of mozzarella was atop her burger, but the one tomato slice looked sad and carelessly plopped on there, and the few limp slices of basil looked limp.  My boyfriend ordered the barbecue burger, which caramelized onions in place of straw onions.  In a weird twist, the ""homemade"" barbecue sauce is actually a cross between ketchup and barbecue, and the restaurant has neither, plain ketchup, or plain barbecue.  A conservative dollop was on top of his burger, along with soggy onions that appeared to have been swimming in grease, and sitting on a fryer for an extended period of time. (Note that the menu does have options besides classic hamburgers such as veggie burgers and a salmon burger- which I didn't try and can't comment on. However, if you are a burger place and can't make a good hamburger, I just don't trust you to make experimental substitutes). 

I will say that the ""I love bacon"" burger I ordered- a combination of ground bacon, and brisket, topped with bacon and ""bacon mayo"" was pretty good, and the most impressive of the burgers I saw.  It was maybe a bit dry, but then again, that is what happens when you make a hamburger out of brisket.  Finally, our order of sweet potato fries were somewhat bland, a little overdone, and nothing to really get excited over.  The Parmesan garlic fries that our dining companions ordered were alright to munch on while we waited for our food, but again, nothing I would miss if I never had again. 

Overall, it was an OK experience, but given the many restaurants in the area, I doubt I will be back.",BruI-D395yclzw0Xc1-dAg,0,0,2,uoRy1bDylNG9xMDrI-i9WQ

It was pricey for what seemed like an average burger, i.e., the normal toppings/condiments.  I'm not a fan of super fried stuff (other than french fries) so the menu seemed a bit limited to me.  (My husband, on the other hand, had trouble choosing between the different burgers.)

I like that they offer beer, and I believe they have happy hour.  They also have free wi-fi  and were showing various sports games on tv's.

The information posted on their Facebook page as well as one the wall in the restaurant itself just says draft beer.  The only disclaimer is ""*available at the bar only"". Server also did not mention anything about which draft beer was covered under the special pricing. $4.50 was the regular price for other draft beer which seems high to me.
The BBQ burger itself was flavorful but definitely on the small side compared to Five Guys or Fatburger which are the closest comparisons. The skinny fries were normal, nothing special. The weather was sunny and warm so we sat on the patio which was nice.

He also helped with questions about the Veggie Patty Burger and how it was cooked and what it was made with. When the food arrived, it was spot on.

After seeing a movie with the fam we decided to try this place out. We walked in and it reminded me a bit of five guys so I was looking forward to what they had to offer. They have more of a variety than five guys, but charge you $1 ea for the toppings and let's not forget if you want a double patty they charge you the cost of another burger :/ pretty lame if you ask me.

After looking over the menu we order our food. My mom and I asked for medium rare burgers while the rest of the fam got your standard well done. After ordering our food we sat down and I noticed they were using frozen patties (strike 1), we waited about 25-30 mins for our food when it wasn't busy (strike 2), they brought mine and my moms burgers to us first, we took a bite only to find out it was over cooked and dry (strike 3).

I ordered the standard with with pepper jack cheese jalapenos and an order of onion rings and a regular drink. The total came out to around 16 dollars. I thought to myself this burger better be worth it. We sat at one of the tables over looking the kitchen. I like the open kitchen feel you can see how your food is being cooked. To my surprise the onion rings came out pretty quick, hoping my burger would come out shortly. 15 min later my burger finally came out and by that time my onion rings were cold. I would have been ok if both came out at about the same time. The presentation of the burger was good and was pleased to see fresh jalapenos instead of your typical pickled peppers. Upon taking the first bite I found the burger to be very bland and very dry. I asked for a few cups of ranch to make up for the dryness of the burger. Ironically the only thing that I enjoyed was the ranch. Nice and thick and not watered down.

1st:  The burger patty itself tasted as if it had been frozen.  It was indeed shaped like a hockey puck and was dense like the meat had been overworked.  Watch a cooking show for god's sake! This is patty 101.  And how about some seasoning?!

2nd:  $28.00 for 2 people and we didn't even have beers.  Kind of pricey for sub-par food.  We can get a tasty burger at In-n-Out for half the price - no frozen patty, either.  Has any one told the owners Las Vegas is a foodie town?

3rd:  My husband ordered the chicken fingers (3 cooked from frozen) for $6.00?  No fries with that?  REALLY!!!  He also ordered the nom noms.  They were crispy but not very flavorful and the accompanying ""cheese"" sauce was bland and seemed to lack cheese.

Happy hour daily from 4-8pm in the bar. Bar was tiny but that was part of the appeal. Half off apps, ""Yes please!"" Bartender was very casual and nice. Suggested the ""Adult Root Beer Float"" cocktail in lieu of dessert... and it was delicious and $2 off.

AHI SLIDERS CRAZY GOOD. And half off. Inferno burger, get out of town. Cooked perfectly (still a little pink and juicy). Tots were eh. 

My sister and I had 5 drinks, Ahi Sliders, the burger and tots and our bill was $35. What? I'm sorry maybe I'm jaded and have lived in Vegas too long but just over $22 a piece for all that in Vegas is crazy.

Immediately I was off put by the staff. The girl taking orders at the counter was bored and slack jawed. The friend I was with asked for the four square checkin special. I was amazed when she said ""I don't know what that is, so I can't do it."" When he explained and showed her his phone, she said ""Uhh yeah, I don't understand emails or huhu, so I can't do that."" Meanwhile, right above her head is a sign asking for people to review them on Yelp! No problem!

We were hungry, so we let it go and finally ordered our food, watching the socalled staff ignore other customers in favor of their own conversation. The food runner arrived with our meals with a smile and a warm greeting, honestly the only person I encountered here with any customer service skills.

The burger was well seasoned and tasty. The butter brush applied to the bun is a little heavy, making the whole thing greasy, but the flavorful patty made up for it. Even though it was pricy, it was a solid burger. 

The fries however were subpar. No seasoning, thin and flavorless. They were cooked well, very crispy, but they don't justify a purchase. 

Honestly, if you're in Town Square, Yard House or Millers are better options for burgers, with better value at a comparable price. The staff is so poor here though that I don't see this place lasting long. The manager was there, watching the whole events as bored and disinterested as her employees, so I don't see anything changing. I'm not sure who the owner is, but I suspect they have no clue just how poorly the staff acts in their absence. They would be very hard pressed to get me to return.",YwSLnD6LLPuM-li4VUgihA,0,0,2,0D1lS924hQMQS6GNhTLCeA

The sweet potato fries and the nom-noms (fried mac n' cheese bites) are straight up. Nothing spectacular, but fried well.

The main event - the burger. I ordered the Inferno burger and my wife got the Oregon Trail. The beef is what makes this burger special, but it was far from special. It downright sucked. I ordered medium-rare and got well-done. My entire party of 12 got well-done burgers. The patty was under-seasoned or not seasoned at all. I guess that's how they do it over there. A Whopper is more satisfying than these burgers.

993054,2012-01-25,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"Welcome to Las Vegas, a foodie's dream.  And one thing this city does well is burgers.  Not only do you have the chain restaurants (Fatburger, In-n-Out), but you've also got wonderful high-end burger joints that make you oh-so-happy to be a carnivore.  One of these delicious spots is I Love Burgers.

The original 'I Love Burgers' location is within the Shoppes at Palazzo, which I've only visited once due to the steep prices.  They've now added a new location at Town Square, and it's much more in my price range. This new location has a more ""express"" feel, which means no waiters and a self-serve ketchup counter. The atmosphere is fun and casual, with floor to ceiling chalkboard walls for the kid in you.  

So do you want to know about the food?  Okay, I guess that would make sense.  This restaurant is aptly named, because you can tell that love goes into these burgers.  Each delicious item, from the fried mac-n-cheese ""nom noms"" to the juicy 7-ounce Inferno burger, is just as lip-smacking good as the Palazzo location, but the prices are cheaper. And for those who steer away from red meat, they've got chicken, veggie, and fish alternatives.  On this visit, I chose the Upstream, a grilled salmon burger on brioche bun. Great flavor, and the perfect serving size. 

Overall, I give it a thumbs up.  The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  The wait time was minimal.  The food was awesome.  We'll definitely be back.",NWum9pk6P0UPm5TbTEanGQ,0,0,4,g9soldHubKtSMJzTmHqWHA

OK, I'm not going to be Captain Bringdown here. It wasn't BAD. Service was friendly, and wait time for our table was fairly average. Not instant, but also not waiting forever. Burger selection was good. My friend chose the Standard, and I went with the Upstream Burger, which was a salmon patty. Grilled, not fried, so bonus for that.

There wasn't much atmosphere to speak of, but at least it was clean.

And the food was acceptable. Unlike my other reviews on here, I don't particularly have any superlative adjectives for I Love Burgers. It was good. That's about it. Fries were good. Atmosphere good.

There are a lot of places I can get ""good"" though, and for less. Or I could go to Holsteins, Burger Bar, or one of many other places, shell out a few more bucks and get ""great.""

I'm not poo-poohing the place, but the only reason I can think of to really recommend it is if you're in Town Square for whatever reason, you don't want CPK, you can't afford to get Claim Jumper in your budget, and Yardhouse has a game on and you don't want to deal with the rowdies.

It took 10 minutes to take our order, the person taking the order was having some challenges with the system yet the manager did not apologize when she took over.   Instead she made an excuse that it was his third day and we had to deal with the wait.   Then it took 25 minutes to get our small order to our table and when I asked the manager why this was taking long, she yelled at me and said what is it that you want!? In front of other customers and said you want a refund is that what you want?

As my son was halfway done with his burger he spit everything that was in his mouth and said yucky! This is a 5 yr old.  I looked at his burger and it was completely raw (bloody) in the center!  I just told him not to eat anymore. As for my husband he did get some food poisoning.  

We had been there couple times before and never had any issues with food or service but this past weekend was terrible that we will never go back again to this place.

In order to have a good burger - you have to start with a good patty - otherwise you're just covering up a bad burger with a bunch of toppings...just like you can try to cover up a bad steak with a bunch of steak sauce.

I had the inferno burger, which I thought was delicious.  A spicy burger that is ACTUALLY spicy!  Finally!  I'm sooooo bored with all the lame attempts to appease the masses by marketing a spicy dish that disappoints on the Scoville scale.  (I think I've mentioned that I have to plead with my Thai food servers that I really mean 10....maybe even 11)

Our group also shared some onion rings, fried pickles, and fried mac & cheese.  I'm not a fan of mac & cheese anyway, so I won't elaborate on that one, but the onion rings were top notch.  Great crisp, fresh sweet onions, and good dipping sauce.  The fried pickles were amazing!  I love that they use full length sandwich slices and batter fry them.  I would just order those next time.

Full disclosure, and the reason for an extra star (and my visit in the first place): they offered a generous BOGO standard burger dinner special for CCSD employees for Teacher Appreciation Week! 

My guy and I each got the standard, adding cheese (cheddar for me, gouda for him), and shared the truffle fries and a drink. Mad props for having a variety of cheeses to add on: bleu, American, cheddar, gouda, pepper jack, etc were all options, along with japalenos, carmelized onions, bacon, and avocado. Almost added the onions to our burgers but ultimately decided not to.

Service was quick and friendly while we placed our orders. Dining room was clean and condiments/drink station and tables were clean. Order was out quickly.

Burgers were thick, and served medium rare- perfect! Cheese was just melted and veggies were fresh and crisp. Did not detect additional condiments on my burger, but the bun and juices from the patty did not have a dry taste, which is admirable.
Truffle fries were $3, ample and shareable portion served perfectly cooked and crisp. Very tasty with light dusting of what seemed to be sea salt. Would order again, appreciated that the truffle flavor was light and not overwhelming.

Will have to go again and try a specialty burger... and those onions!

I ordered the I love bacon burger. 

When the burger came out it looked pretty fancy. 
I really liked the fried string onions. The patty itself could have more flavor. It wasn't dry but it was really fatty because of the bacon I guess. I got the sweet potato fries with my burger. They seemed like regular sweet potato fries. Mine could have used more salt.

Two of the chefs were outside smoking and engaging in inappropriate conversation about what I could only assume was something to do with their ex girlfriend. Something about not paying her cell phone bill. I'm a biker and don't mind swearing, but it may have offended some other patrons.

At 10:57am the doors were opened and I took that to mean that the business was open as well, so I entered. The two chefs aforementioned had gone back inside by that time and where behind the line prepping. After seeing the counter/bar to be empty, I went over to the pass (kitchen) to ask if they were open (again, two minutes before posted time.) I was told that they were not open for another two minutes and was left to wait at the counter. After the allotted two minutes someone else approached the counter and greeted me. I tried ordering, but they left without warning while I was in mid sentence. Passing this guy on the way back to the kitchen was another worker, who seemed to be a bit out of it. He looked hung over. I ordered my food three times because he couldn't remember three simple items. I then paid and went to my table. I was given a number and told to place it on the salt/pepper shaker.

My food was ready is about five minutes (Ilovebacon burger, fries, and a small drink). The burger itself was cooked to a perfect mid-rare, the bacon was still raw. The fries, which were advertised to be home style were frozen and from a bag. When I was given my food, it was from the first guy who walked off on me. He failed to retrieve my number and just kinda slapped the food down and walked off.

2223006,2011-11-26,1,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"Alas, the catty title writes itself: I *don't* love (these) burgers.

Despite a friendly staff (albeit three tries at the cashier to get our order right), the savvy shown by offering a sit-down, waiter-free, casual dining experience with a customizable burger menu at Town Square (right by the movies!) does not extend to the prowess in the kitchen.

I was really excited to try the vegetarian burger because it's a black bean patty made in-house, not some nuked Boca disc. Unfortunately, the patty not only started squooshing beyond containment at first bite, but it severely lacked flavour. I'm used to dealing with squishy vegetarian patties that require hand gymnastics to keep them in the bun (LBS, Burger Bar), but usually the taste redeems the annoying acrobatics. Here, the taste was just sludgy. 

It's not a good thing when, with every bite, you have to wipe (and wipe) a wall of paste off your front teeth.

Maybe the burger would've been better if it'd been served as advertised, with alfalfa sprouts on top, but I doubt it. I'd added Swiss cheese to my order, and normally cheese will distract me from many taste issues, but not this time. Thank goodness for the serve-yourself condiment bar. There I got mayonnaise packets to add the tang I'd been expecting from the burger's red pepper sauce. (In addition to mayo, the condiment bar has pumps-and-cups for ketchup and mustard plus packets of Tabasco sauce.)

My chosen beverage was the triple chocolate shake. I didn't say anything as I drank it (and drink it I did, because I was thirsty and didn't want to pay $3 for bottled water in addition to this $6 concoction), but when I coaxed my husband into taking a sip, his first thought was the same as mine. ""Is this just ice cream? Slightly melted ice cream?"" ""Yeah, I think it is. With a big, scratchy drizzle of chocolate syrup."" I couldn't taste where it had ever been near a blender.

My tator tots were okay, about what I'd expect from a frozen Ore-Ida bag at home.

My husband was even less than impressed with his Inferno burger (although it was definitely hot) and onion rings. The taste just wasn't there, not even with the first few hunger-sating bites.

We were both sad that we'd wasted a meal out on I Love Burgers, but it seemed like such a good concept, like a more hip Fuddruckers. For just a little more money, we could have crossed the sidewalk and enjoyed something at Yard House. Despite not having eaten all day, I left half of my burger on my plate, and my husband left with regret that he didn't do the same.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,1,2,rWnSuN2dIJCJWXVdVzjC6w

I am a fan of a good burger and actually enjoy making my own from scratch so I'm always curious as to these burger restaurants and how they compare against my own and other establishments. I Love Burgers is ok but I probably wouldn't frequent the restaurant. The ordering process was easy with variety of burgers to choose from. You can pick between 1/3 pound patty or a 1/2 pound patty (more to love) for $1 more. I chose the Inferno Burger more to love (1/2 pound patty, with pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, and a spicy mayo). The combo was $4 more (and it came with your choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries, or tator tots and a drink). I chose the tator tots. 

The burger itself was jiucy and pretty tasty. However, it was overpowered by the amount of jalapenos that were added on to the burger. I didn't feel like it was that large of a burger for the price that I paid ($7.99) and for the price of the combo meal, left a little bit unsatisfied. The tator tot side is a nice touch and option instead of fries.

For the price, I definitely feel like I can have more food elsewhere or get a better quality burger for the price at another place (like Bachi Burger).",6QFyYvYgN1XcVfxMMMWxGw,3,2,2,uXDSSUDbJ-kXkqPVBaqNEg

You can draw and write all over the walls while killing some time and waiting for your food to come out.  They also wrote their menu on it.  Just watch out when you're walking around because you might forget about the chalk, bump into the wall, and get chalk all over your clothes. LOL I didn't bump into the wall but someone else did and of course I told um about it, not right away.

Their kitchen is open so we get to watch as they create our burgers, apps, and shakes.  They also have an outside dinning area.

I came here with a free standard burger coupon, a quick lunch.  It was free so it was pretty good but had I paid, it probably wasn't worth it.  I've had nicer burgers with good fries for the same price in nice restaurants. This was the ""standard"" plain burger just a burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato in a bun. Their other burger options on the menu seems tasty.

There really wasn't any customer service.  There was a cashier, you order and pay when you come in, and the person who brings your food, that's it. Self serve soda and condiments.

I'll probably be back since I only tried the standard burger and haven't fully experienced I Love Burgers.  Plus it's in a good location near yard house, blue martini, and rave theater. Maybe I'll try the triple chocolate shake or some desserts, the menu online says there's creme brulee and bread pudding, always fan of those. There's parmesan garlic fries, not a fan regular cut fries anymore so I have to see if they can give me parmesan garlic steak fries instead.

Now... Onto drinks. We went on over to the bar area that's located near the balcony seating. Our bartender was Aaron.. What a rockstar! He suggested great drinks to me and my boyfriend with us just mentioning what kind of liquor we prefer. I mentioned that I like whisky/ dark liquor, so he made me a Pain Killer.. And wow the taste was great! Very smooth drink, but definitely creeps up on you  my BF ordered a melon ball & a Collins. Both great also!!

I ordered the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and a strawberry milkshake. I wasn't going to make my order a combo but I really wanted a milkshake so they told me that I could just make my burger a combo and makes my drink a milkshake and the fries were basically free, so why not. Okay, SO I really did love the burger but the downside is that it wasn't as big as I thought it would be for what $6 bucks? And the fries weren't huge or anything it was just a little serving, keep in mind that a side of fries are 2.50. Their sweet potato fries weren't the best, they added cinnamon or something to them and it made them taste kind of weird, yeah not a fan. The best part was seriously the milkshake!! I absolutely love strawberry and when it came it was topped with marshmallows, I LOVE MARSHMALLOWS!! My boyfriend got The Inferno burger which I took a bite of and it was amazing! I liked it better than mine actually. It was a perfect spicy burger. If you like jalapeños, go for the Inferno. He got the natural cut fries which were awesome, perfect crunch!

The place isn't as bad as I thought it would be. But I'd like it better if it was a sit down restaurant, because the prices are more of a sit down restaurant.

Natural cut fries.  Not really sure what that means.  They are machine cut and flavorless.  If they aren't frozen they have done an excellent job of recreating that experience.

Unfortunately I am a med rare guy.  I am a minimalist with toppings so I chose American cheese and a squirt of ketchup.  The burger is lightly salted and heavily peppered and very average.

1. BBQ burger with apple wood bacon and onion straws, and 
2. The standard with American cheese, lettuce, and tomato. 

**** The burgers were juicy , and the buns were soft. The regular fries were not too salty, and were pretty good. We also tried the tater tots in honor of Napoleon Dynamite ( Napoleon, give me some of your tots. No, go find your own.)

My 3 year old son seemed to like his grilled cheese sandwich, and the tots. For dessert, we decided to split a $6.00 triple chocolate milkshake. GOOD -- but not worth the money.....

Our total bill was about $40.00 and in my mind was about $10.00 too much. I don't think I would come back for burgers unless I took advantage of that movie ticket/food combo they offer for $15.00. That seems like it might be worth it..........",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,0,0,3,A7U3wcF77TA7nhvE07Z9Sw

Burger Bar - Ok, again, not awesome.

Service was super busy, and it took a while to get our food.  Without asking, they deducted the cost of our drinks from the bill.  Very classy.

Now for the food.  The burgers were ok.  My wife's burger said it had bacon but there was none.  The barbeque sauce was not very good.  She also ordered Onion Rings and they were to crispy and the sauce that came with them was not very good (tasted like a bad thousand island dressing.  My fries were ok but they were very thin and obviously had been frozen.
  
The worst part of the meal was the $6.00 for each shakes.  My wife ordered the triple  chocolate which came with powered chocolate on top and was just to strong for even a triple.  I ordered a strawberry which was totally uneatable.  I had marshmallows on top and some terrible spice mixed in that made it so bad after one taste I had to put it down.  $12 for shakes that we could not eat.  I was expecting great things from such pricey ice cream.

Our whole bill came to over $35 and we both said we could have had a much better meal for that price.  I do not mind spending money on food if it is worth it but clearly this food was not.  I wish we had checked Yelp before we decided to try it.",GSig6zAkM625nx4NKj7YJg,0,0,1,8kdQVI1ZibRgdMaY4o1ugQ

The food quality was bad, too much bun, small meat patty and it was dry. The fries needed work and the cheese they used for the fries was too gritty.

The burger was really juicy considering they don't ask how you want it cooked, and it was almost well done.  But I can see how people may think the place is expensive considering my burger alone ended costing 10 dollars.  By the time you add a drink and fries, you're ending up with steakhouse prices.

Definitely not a place like it in Vegas.  More upscale restaurant prices.  Fast food service.  It's almost like you want the burger to taste bad so you can not like this place.  But the burger is good!!  I really liked it, that spicy bite you get and the pepperiness on your tongue.  It was really good.  I'm not sure what to think!!!!

Both burgers were tasteless to a point that condiments gave little re-leaf.  I ordered my burger without the Buns, and told them to wrap it in lettuce. They only put one, torn leaf of lettuce over it. WTF! To add insult to injury, the paper thin sheet of paper they had at the bottom of the plastic tray was soaked with grease, and it tore itself to shreds and came off with the burger when you picked it up.

This time I got the bacon cheese burger with truffle fries. Ok so I'm a bit weird I love pickles on my burgers and hate tomatoes. So add the pickles and remove the tomatoes.

We walked in - and first thing I noticed was that even though there were maybe five tables seated - no one had food yet. Everyone was waiting. Ok. Maybe they just got a rush. We order at the counter, and the girl was very pleasant, even when our total came to almost $60. Really?! This was for nom-noms, chicken fingers (no fries), two burgers with fries, and three milkshakes. One would think that for this price, food and service would be impeccable, especially when it is set-up like a glorified cafeteria. Oh but no ...

Food arrives. My son's order is wrong and needs to be sent back. (He ordered a BBQ Burger and was given a cheeseburger.) My younger son's burger is undercooked and needed to be sent back. (We like our burgers medium. This was RARE. Like, tar-tar in the middle.) It may have been tasty, but too risky for my 6-year-old to eat. Fries were good. Chicken finger 'appetizer' which were @ $6? Only 3 fingers. $2 a finger. Umm ... ok. Shakes were tasty, but for $6 a pop, they should exceed mere tasty.

Here's the kicker. We chose a table that gave us a great view of the cooks, who spent A LOT of time laughing, joking, chatting (I'm all for fun in the workplace, but they were LOUD, in an already loud restaurant), and every time a woman would walk by, my children and I got to hear a full review of what they thought of her chest, her butt ... whatever.

I ordered a not fancy cheeseburger, fries and a soda.  There are approximately 8 tables of people here in a space that could seat 50 families comfortably. Having said all that, 35 minutes is too long to wait for food.

3248180,2011-12-13,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"If I had to sum up I Love Burgers in three words, they would be ""didn't love it"".

My wife and I ducked in here during a visit to town square. Yardhouse looked busy and we wanted something more casual, so we thought we would give this new place a try. It certainly looked low-key.

I ordered ""The Inferno"" and a side order of onion rings. It was rather expensive for what you got. The onion rings were fine, tasty enough, but at around six bucks for the serve there were so few that you were looking at just under a buck per onion ring. for this price there should be enough of them to share with the entire table -- even at a place like Town Square --- particularly when you can get a gargantuan tower of much better onion rings, mere feet away, at Yardhouse for not very much more.

The burger itself was OKish - I know they call it ""inferno"" and I LIKE hot things, but I have become used to hyperbole when dealing with ""hot"" fast food where words like ""inferno"" simply mean, spicy. They aren't kidding around here - The Inferno burger comes with fresh, not pickled, jalapenos, complete with seeds. They are only lightly seared and remain a little bit crunchy, so it's almost like you have partially raw, crunchy, cut up peppers in your burger. After a few bites my eyes began to water, my nose began to run, and I had to take a long drink after every bite. Hot and spicy is one thing, but as another reviewer said, the jalapenos in The Inferno totally overwhelm the other flavours. I also wasn't crazy about the very soft buns here, either. I prefer a slightly crusty bun, but I understand that in the US people generally prefer the soft bun, so I'll put that one down to cultural preference and leave it at that. the problem is, though, that everything about the burger -- soft bun, soft pattie -- (with the exception of the crunchy jalapenos) was a bit gummy and mushy. There wasn't any feeling of substance to each bite.

Overall, I Love Burgers serves up a product that I don't feel is vastly superior to places like Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. Yes, it IS better than these places in that the ingredients are clearly of good quality and the burger is well assembled, but at the end of the day it's still very clearly a fast food offering. With prices and a location like this, I feel that these guys could go that extra mile toward turning out something truly remarkable, worthy of reminding punters why burgers are something they might one day fall in love with all over again.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,1,0,2,WGsGGkp33Lt_7ye5anxB7g

It is fast food, but it makes you feel like you aren't eating fast food. My favorite burger is the the INFERNO. It has pepper jack cheese, jalapeños, and jalapeño aioli. If you don't do spicy, you may not want to try it. But if you like jalapeños, definitely give it a shot. They also have nom noms which is fried mac n cheese.

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a nice girl with a welcoming smile. She assisted me with my order and gave me a number to put at my table.  Prices were a bit higher than expected but I did elect for some extras such as cheese, fried onions, and bacon.

In any case, the layout of the restaurant is strange. They had a few televisions tuned to the game but you had to pick certain seats and they were all taken. So from the seat I had, I couldn't watch the game.

Food was delivered quickly and I thought the size of the burger was bigger than average.  It was cooked a little longer than I would have liked it to be but it was still delicious. The fries were top notch as well.

Interesting setting, lots of TVs around, and everyone was pretty friendly.  It took just a tad bit too long to get our food but they do state they cook everything to order and it takes 8-10 minutes so we were warned. 

The burgers are 1/3 lb and thick but small in terms of diameter (think like 2-3 standard McDonalds hamburger patties stacked on top of each other).  The quality of the beef was good, but they were dry burgers.  I don't mind getting a medium steak, but when it comes to burgers it has to be well done.  Still, almost every well done burger I've had from fast food to casual to upscale steakhouses has not been this dry.

The fries and tater tots were very good.  Even the regular size version of either is enough for 2 people.  

Overall I'm happy about some things and unhappy about others.  I think paying $8-$10 for a burger of that size/quality is off-putting.  I'd rather pay 25-50% of the price for almost any fast food burger.  If they could pull off a casual burger like TGI Friday's or Applebee's for the same price then this would probably be a 5-star review (and I'd be talking about how great a deal it was).

Price - This is the main reason for 3 stars.  3 burgers, 2 milk shakes and an order of fried pickles came out to $57 dollars.  when a milk shake is $6 and its served in a 8 oz plastic cup its way overpriced.

Food - Burgers and fries were good, but there are a lot of good burger joints in town with many of them cheaper than here.

Location - Yes its in Town Square, but unless you are going to Valet Parking in the back its hard to find. Its behind Yardhouse and it almost seems like an overflow for when Yardhouse is full. We went on a Saturday evening at 6pm and we were the only table in the joint.  a few folks started walking in right when we were leaving.

Decor - Cool chalkboard paint on the walls so everyone is encouraged to draw but nothing that made it stand out.

He was very kind as was the girl who took my order. I added on some ""Nom Noms"" which were mac n cheese balls that were fried. The food was pretty quick maybe ten or fifteen minutes and considering the place was pretty busy that seemed pretty impressive. The burger itself looked absolutely amazing. The bun was a beautiful golden brown and looked as if it was baked on location and to order. The patty was a nice medium rare which is just how I like it. Perhaps I am spoiled a little bit by In-and-Out and their toasted buns and super fresh and crunchy veggies. I was really missing it with this burger. The bun was super soft and doughy and although it had a thin layer of lettuce and tomato I just didn't get any crunch or texture out of it. The patty was decent but I just wasn't tasting anything special. The cheese was a nice visual but offered nothing in terms of flavor. As for the nom noms... they were pretty tasty. Primarily because of the cheese dipping sauce. I wish they had given me enough to use on my burger. I guess the bottom line with this place is if you are in Town Square and want a burger for 6 bucks then go for it. It wont blow you away but it will hold you over compared to a lot of the expensive places located near by. 

Good Service, good quality, lacks any type of wow factor though. For 6 bucks you get a classic burger which is a single patty with cheese, lettuce and tomato.

Located in Town Square, I Love Burgers offers a good selection of made-to-order burgers with some original creations on their menu that are worth taking a look at. 

The interior was clean, and despite it being a little busy for the lunch rush, there was plenty of seating left. I also liked the chalkboard walls, which made it easy for my group and I to embrace our inner child and start doodling away while we waited for our food!

I had the Oregon Trail burger, which according to the menu, consisted of: ground buffalo, aged cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onions, and a roasted garlic aioli all between whole wheat buns. 

When my burger came, I was actually a little surprised at how small the patty was (even the tomato looked bigger than the actual burger patty)! Whatever... the aroma was tantalizing my senses so I just wanted to dig in!

The burger was cooked to a medium, so it really is juicy and filled with the savory flavor of the lean buffalo. The bun tasted a little dry, but I wasn't sure if the bun being whole wheat was what made it taste that way. The juiciness of the burger made up for the dry burger buns, so it wasn't that bad.

The sweet potato fries were not burnt and they have the perfect sweetness to make my tastebuds happy. I feel like they give you a lot of fries, but maybe the size of the burger makes the fries look like a bigger portion.

I like the little branding of the restaurant name on top of the burger bun (nice touch!). However, it wasn't enough to completely win me over. 

From a place that specializes in burgers, I expected something more. I don't know if it was worth it because the burgers left me underwhelmed.

Some items are a little pricey compared to fast food but I don't consider this a fast food joint. It is more of a fast casual diner. You get grass fed beef for a reasonable price. I have bought grass fed beef at whole foods, so I know it is not cheap. 

I am always greeted by the employees when I come in. In fact Sandra who works the register knows me by name and knows what I like to order. She always gives me great service. The managers always come by and ask how my meal was and if there was anything else. I see that they care about providing great service and food. I am sure if I had a problem or suggestion they would take it seriously. Hence why they are always reading yelp reviews. 

I have had pretty much everything on the menu. My go to is the BBQ chicken salad. The BBQ burger is good. The caprice is a very good burger if you are tired of the same old burger every other place offers. The biggest surprise I found was the turkey burger, it comes with some really tasty stuffing.

I had no idea where I was going and ended up parking in a weird parking spot by vallet and saw this place. The name and outside was so cute and as soon as I saw ""shakes and beer"" I had to go in. When I went in I saw 2 other customers and a very flustered manager I would assume at the register. I only ordered a shake because it looked like a storm was moving in and I had a long drive back to California. I ordered the Triple Chocolate Shake which was over $5. I instantly thought of a quote from Pulp Fiction. Anyway I sat down and waited for my shake. The manager was very all over the place she was in the middle of taking someone's order and an employee came in and she went straight into conversation with her and totally left the customer waiting. Behind the counter where my shake should have been made no one was doing anything. The waiter in there was socializing and not doing much of anything else. Finally I went up to the manager letting her know I had ordered a MILKSHAKE over 15 minutes ago. She then told the waiter and he looked at the order screen and said ""oh yeah you're right"" then he went on to aruge with another employee about if I wanted it to go or not. Then a girl yelled to me across the restaurant asking if I wanted it to go. The shake wasn't that good and was about 12oz in a plastic cup!

Also onion rings are no long available along with a few other things. Very disappointing.

Ok I get that it was early in the day & maybe they hadn't made ice tea yet, which is weird, but it almost made it seem like they weren't going to offer it anymore. If that's the case #1 tell your customer when she asks & #2 remove the ice tea maker. It may be a small thing but it really irritated me.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was a joke.  The special was Bloody Mary's and I had to keep correcting him, by the time he was done...they were a site and he said he'd been working there over a year.  One patron had to ask multiple times for their check.  Another patron asked for a beer with no fruit, the bartender was insistent on adding fruit and the patron stated that she did not want fruit in her beer. He commented, it's a citrus blend, there's already fruit in it. 

The bartender was constantly touching his face, and didn't wash his hands before squeezing lime into the Bloody Mary's, when he couldn't get the garnish of lime on the rim he tossed it in and said ""oh well.""  When were limes in Bloody Mary's?

The bartender then disappeared for a bit, took others orders, fiddle farted around...I finally piped up and said we were ready to order.  After our food was brought out, he never checked on us. The fries were over cooked, and our drink glasses were empty.  We had to ask for water and refills.  He tried to take away my friends food before she was done, but left 3 empty drink glasses in front of my other friend. 

The picked up trash off the floor, then started cutting limes without washing his hands.  After he cleared our dishes, he disappeared again, and we sat there waiting to pay.  He came back and started working on another task and I had to ask for the check.  He bright the check, we paid by credit card, he brought the paperwork back for us to sign and just stood there.  After we filled it out and signed it, he still just stood there, then he said that he was supposed to get the signed copy and I said I know, we are not ready to give it to you yet.  

In summary, food was not as good as it used to be, and the bartender who had been there for at least a year, needs to be trained in health and safety, customer service, and the items on the menu.",ZKIqI0VnqnRFnDCPro-ePQ,0,0,1,YjVQJY0nIjXEuDZ7Zta7Eg

Waiter was friendly (must say service on the Vegas strip is usually very friendly) and suggested that black bean party can be subbed for the meat patty on any of the items on the  menu. Went for the spicy hot burger  (with hot green peppers) with beef subbed for the black bean patty. I believe the original veggie burger recipes is  better - so will not recommend the switch to others. Moreover, the kitchen got the order wrong initially and served the burgers with the beef patty (as per the menu). So be double careful if you do insist on subbing. Luckily, the friendly waiter caught it on time for me but was a fraction of a second late for my colleague. She had already taken the first bite but luckily did not swallow. Not a very pleasant experience after that. The place attempted to make amends and made our drinks on the house.

3968225,2012-12-12,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"I totally dug this place! There's been a big trend in Vegas for upscale burgers, and so many places who make amazing food forget the environment that's meant to go with a burger. I Love Burgers in Town Square has nailed it! Not only are they pumping out incredible burgers, fries and fried pickles (they're tasty, seriously), but they also have the atmosphere of a true burger restaurant! When I eat a burger I want to use both hands and require a million napkins by the end, and this place gets that. You don't have to worry about dressing nice or spending a small fortune.

If you're a bacon fan (and these days who isn't?) be sure to check out the I Love Bacon burger. There's bacon IN the burger, and in the sauce, and of course on top of the burger. And don't be afraid to create your own, or add a few things to one of their awesome burgers.

Friendly staff, excellent (burger) environment, and the perfect location to walk off your meal afterwards. Also be sure to check out the movie theater combo deal; $16 gets you a burger and a movie ticket. Considering movies already cost more than $12, this is a great deal. We didn't get it, but the manager mentioned it to us when he asked how our meal was going and we'll definitely try it out next time.

The bartender noticed there was no other food on the table and asked if we were ok. We told him no and he told a lady that we never got the hotdog and not believing us even though the table only had one plate on it she asked to see our receipt kind of rudely like we were lying.

It was drowning in their mayo and I could not pick out anything distinct in the flavor profile and it just did not seem to work for me. We shared some truffle fries and they also disappointed me but it may be because I prefer truffle fries to be thin/shoe-string and these were thicker so it just absorbed the oil.

 I will say that I liked the decor of the establishment of the chalkboards. It was fun to look around and see what people have written and add my own art.

We had a BBQ burger w/ sweet potato fries and a I love bacon burger with regular fries. Came out pretty quickly and was suitably hot. Thumbs up on both burgers. Cooked nicely and were quite tasty, however the meat could have been a little juicier. Fries were crispy and well seasoned. 

I do think it's pricey for the product; hence only three stars (average). Not great value. Chalk it up to high rent at Town Square.  I think they'd better up the quality if they want to make it there. 

I personally think one can get an equal or better burger at just about any tavern in town, not to mention In'nOut, Smashburger, and Five Guys. Not sure if we'll go back, since there are many other options for food there.",Nrxse9AoBKKLGHrf7I2fKQ,1,0,3,lMYCqDghbGY6K3hiTORk2g

I don't love these burgers. The staff was friendly enough. That's the one star.

We got here around 8pm on a Thursday. It was positively deserted, save the wax figure of The Rock accosting you upon entry. (I have no idea what that's about.)

The burgers, for the smallest one, is $5.99.  And if you want anything on it, it's a $1 per item. And if you want fries and a drink? ANOTHER $4.99!  So basically, you're paying like $12-$15 for a burger n' fries. If I'm going to spend that much, I'll blow the extra $5 and go to Holstein's. If I'm eating food out of a basket, I expect to pay under $10 for it.

The atmosphere is very ""off campus burger joint"", not something you'd find in Town Square. But a college student couldn't afford to eat here.

It was all tables and chairs, so it didn't really seem like the kind of place you'd hang out in and drink beers at happy hour, which is something they push heavily. There's lots of ads and chalkboards for happy hour cocktails and beer bucket specials.  

Their burger options were kind of minimal, too. The turkey burger seemed to only be available if you got it with cranberries and stuffing, which defeats the purpose of a healthy turkey burger. No bun options, either, so no wheat for me.

So I got the smallest burger they offered (5 oz).  When it finally arrived (we waited quite a while), it seemed like far more than 5oz.  And it was DENSE, like a hockey puck kinda. It didn't taste bad, per se, just a bit dry and like I said, dense. It was a bit bland, as well. 

I asked the hostess what kind of beef they served and she proudly declared, ""100% angus beef!"" and I said, ""can you tell me how much fat? Like is it 80/20 or 85/15?""  I asked because usually a burger that dense and dry is rocking a 7% fat content.

After, I swear to god, 15 minutes and lots of confusion and chicken without a head-type running around, the cook came out and told me -- get this -- ""It's 80/20, but when we're done cooking it, it's 85/15.""

That's not quite how that works, sport, but ok.  It's one or the other, you don't have the authority to determine how much fat is in it after you've cooked it. You have to go by what's in it before.  But after all that running around and looking in the freezer, clearly, no one has any idea what they're cooking.

I shan't be going back here, unfortunately.  Like I said, the staff was nice enough, but other than that, it's not my bag.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,1,0,1,zrn1qYzGOJWIW_AdQ4ZJtw

I paid 11 after tax for one burger with NO fries. The Inferno + Fried Egg = $10.xx, the combo of fries and drink were an extra $4.00. Didn't seem too bad however I already bought a beer at their bar thus making my drink useless. My friend had ordered fries so I would just take a couple off him. 

For an 11 dollar burger, this was a poorly made sandwich, as if they did not know how to properly assemble a burger. (patty loosely formed, bun not toasted (but somehow stamped with their name). The bun literally felt like it came from the refrigerator. It was also very undersized for an eleven dollar burger, it resembles the size of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese from McDonald's, perhaps just a little more height from my egg and my lettuce/tomato.

The flavors were decent though, it seemed they really tried with their housemade jalapeno mayo, and the patty did have the beefy taste that people look for in a burger. However, just a rock solid bun would kill any joy derived from the highlights of their burger.

Sorry to say, but the fries were pure garbage. For 3.29, they really dropped the ball. Can't really pinpoint what it is, however they do not resemble 'fresh cut' at all.

I belong to a local Meetup.com group of ""foodies"". We've decided to try various burgers around town. Lots of high-end and low-cost. So I booked a table for 10 here, to give it a try.

To say I was VERY happy with the service is an understatement. As we were a larger group, they offered us the ability to RESERVE in advance as well as table service (vs their standard order-then-sit, which they offer to the gen pop). They were FANTASTIC. Back room, separate checks, constant attention, we must've driven them CRAZY, as like I said, this is a fast-food establishment (order first, get table after), not a dining-with-service place.

The burgers unfortunately were a little disappointing, in that their ""medium"" turned out to be more ""well done"". (We prefer rare to medium rare, anyway.) But this is fast-food, not fine dining burgers like Burger Bar or such. And yes, they were expensive. But the Inferno (the hottest flavored offering of the bunch) was, indeed, HOT! YAY! And the ""I heart Bacon"" was good, lots of bacon on and IN the patty! Both had nice flavor.

But the best thing in the place was the fried pickles! It was the best example of fried pickles we had ever tried. EVER. And then there were the NOM NOMS: deep fried mac & cheese cubes. They were light and flavorful, and the dipping sauce was great.

Oh, and their chopped salad had a CUMIN dressing! In a fast-food burger place! Really fresh and tasty.

The burgers: These are not overwhelming, greasy, cheese-slathered burgers. Not petite, not enormous, I'd guess they're a 6-8oz patty of something around 80/20 ground beef. The buns are very high quality and nicely toasted, the vegetable toppings crisp and fresh. I've had both the beef and buffalo patties and I can say it's for sure buffalo when you order it. Has a nice gaminess to the taste and when ordered medium rare, is prepared medium rare.

The sides: I can only speak to the tater tots. I like this unique choice and they give you a very, very generous serving. They're well seasoned with a nice crisp, not greasy at all.

5075378,2012-10-01,6,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"Decided to meet some friends here for lunch.

This establishment is located in town square.

As we entered the place we were greeted, the staff is friendly and nice, reminds me of a high end fancy Mc Donald's.

You order like you were at a fast-food place.

I ordered the regular cheeseburger classic with skinny fries and it came with a drink all for $15

WOW! right? for burger and fries, kinda pricey.

Honestly i was disappointed.  For the price I paid i was hoping it tasted more like Burger Bar inside Mandalay Bay.

Instead the cheeseburger didn't  taste good at all. I felt like it was your typical backyard burger at your uncle joe's BBQ. Infact uncle joe's burger is probably tastier than I Love burger's burger.

If your looking for good burger i would suggest Grind Burger or Burger Bar or if your cheap go to IN N OUT burger! :)",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,10,7,2,BtTrJghG8OxPnzlpm6aVhw

5085074,2015-08-12,2,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"It was my mission to find a child friendly eatery for my toddler, since we were at Townsquare for a play date. I usually like to knock off bookmarks every time I eat out and this place definitely not on my bookmarks. My first experience here was a couple years back and definitely not that memorable. Service was average, but I was not at all impressed by the food. I ordered the burger kids meal (choices were between a hot dog, burger, or chicken fingers) with sweet potato fries and a side of nom noms. 
My kid actually fell asleep, which was good in a way because that usually gives me an opportunity to thoroughly enjoy a meal...mommies and daddies of toddlers can relate! 

Nom noms - 8 fried mac and cheese squares with cheese dipping sauce. Pretty good actually. ILB gets kudos for this one. My kid and husband tried these later on at home and they liked it.

Burger - This is just your plain ol' hamburger with green leaf lettuce and a slice of tomato. I do like the freshness and quality of the veggies, but seriously I ordered a burger...and I expect the beef patty to be the star. The patty itself was too small for the rest of the burger. It was tasteless and dry. I took a couple bites and was annoyed. The burger was for my son, but I'm allowed a taste test right? When my son woke up and finally tried it, he spit it out. Condiments could not even help this sad burger. 

Sweet potato fries - Sweet! Maybe a little too sweet. These fries are dusted with some kind of cinnamon, brown sugar mix. I think with a little refinement, these fries could be better. 

The interior is decent in regards to space. There are several different areas to dine, a bar area, a patio area and I swear I saw a private room. I don't think this place ever gets too busy, so you can pretty much enjoy your meal a good distance away from the next patron. 

Bathrooms were clean and decent and had a changing table. My only pet peeve is that there is a mirror that I am only able to see my forehead and above. Wtf? I am not that short. 

They offer happy hour, but only on alcoholic beverages. It would have nice to have some apps included in that happy hour. 

Overall, we won't be back. Not even sure why I came back after all those years. There are better places to eat at Townsquare. Do your research first!",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,2,2,3,TOb1XeIItsrMMaM18Wpndg

Two red flags popped while I was there.  1.) It was a Friday night at 630 PM and there was NOBODY there, not a good sign.  The bartender claimed it was because the PBR Championship was in town but I wasn't buying it.  She then said it was like that the day before.  Not good IMO if you are empty Thursday and Friday, especially in a place that gets tons of traffic like Town Square. 2.) They don't ask how you would like your burger prepared.  I guess I was expecting more than a Johnny Rockets or 5 Guys type preparation process, but that might have been my fault.

I loved the hamburger buns that they use almost so much that I was questioning going up and seeing if they would just let me buy a bag of those. This place just opened up in Town Square which is a nice addition. When we went we had no idea it was only their second day open because it was running quite smoothly. Another great thing about this place is that it is great for kids cause as you wait for your food the walls have that chalk board paint so kids can play and write on the walls to help them be preoccupied while the food comes. They have plenty of TVs which were on the football games when we arrived. When I am back in town or at the town square I will defiantly go back here for lunch. NO DOUBT!!!

The only thing was the staffs acceptance of a regular named ""Jesus"". He was friendly at the beginning of the night but grew more and more intolerable as the night progressed. His lack of boundaries and inappropriate touching was and is the reason we left and won't return. When we asked the staff about the regular who was driving customers away the response was ""he spends a lot of money here."" As a restaurant manager with 20 years experience, I understand how that thinking occurs. But after watching 4 different tables become annoyed with him and then leave (some without receiving their already paid for food) I can't imagine how much money was lost.

When you walk in there is a friendly hostess (or girl behind the counter). She was helpful when I ordered answering my questions. I ordered a burger and fries and a soda. I took a seat and waited for my burger. The guys making the food looked busy and it smelled like burgers, so I was hopeful.

My burger came and it looked decent, but one bite and I was not happy. It was the most dry burger I've ever had. I put a whole packet of mayo on it and a bunch of ketchup... still super dry. The bun was about twice the thickness of the meat, so I had to take off half of the bun. The meat was overcooked and cold. It was as if they cooked the burgers then put them in the fridge and then tried to reheat them when serving them. I ordered blue cheese on my burger and it had no flavor. Blue cheese with no flavor! WHAT!

I then moved onto the fries in hopes that I wouldn't have to go hungry because the burger was not edible. The fries were cold and flavorless. Even ketchup couldn't save or help these fries. I drank my soda and said to my fellow diner, ""at least the soda is good"" my friend then replied ""how could they screw that up!"" Well I went for a refill before leaving and that time the soda was only soda water with  no syrup.

It was kind of hard to find the place in the town center. Had to circle around a few times to find it. It was quite empty when I went Monday early evening.

With so many mixed reviews on this place, my friend and I thought it would be best if we gave ILB a try during their happy hour. Monday through Friday from 3pm-8pm they do half off draft beers, martinis, and appetizers. 

The offering for happy hour is weaker than the other options in Town Square. The appetizers are not enough to fill you up and even if you ordered a couple it is all fried food. After a few items, we called it quits. 

The onion rings are some of the best. The outside is a nice golden brown. The coating possessed a solid crunch factor and helped maintain the integrity of the onion within. The Nom Noms were also very good. Fried mac'n'cheese bites are always welcome. The Hebrew National hot dog with fries should be passed upon. As for non hh offering, we shared the BBQ Burger. It was a good burger. I can see why people complain about how expensive they are. Especially since it is this awkward half fast food, half dine in set up.

But their Tuesday happy hour from 3pm-8pm which included $2 draft beers, half off all the appetizers, $2 off all specialty cocktails AND THEN buy one get one free burgers from 1pm-5pm could not be passed up!

So commenced our one meal day at 4:30pm to a mostly deserted restaurant.  I was bummed when ""Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza"" closed down at this location about a year ago.  They've kept the same set up and it was a nice enough day to open up the front bar area to the patio so we sat there.  

Thanks to other reviews, we were aware that the burgers were kind of small so we went with the ""more to love"" size but it came off looking like a standard size burger.  We didn't opt for fries since they wanted regular price ($5) for them.  

Why get fries when you can get the ""mac and cheese nom noms"" for $2.50?  These babies were five stars by themselves.  Those cubes of breaded and deep fried macaroni and cheese had to be one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  Total bang for buck.  We had two orders!

On to the burgers, I went with the ""I Love Bacon"" which was a blend of sirloin and applewood bacon patty with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda and onion strings on top.  No point in going half assed on burgers when you can go all the way!  Maybe they should finish off the plate with a syringe full of liquid bacon fat stuck on top of the burger.   Unfortunately, the brioche bun was kinda dry and the patty came off that way as well but I figured all the applewood bacon in the patty made it so.  Not great but I'm fine with paying $4.50 for it.  

My wife got the standard burger which was a little more well done than she preferred.  We didn't realize until later that this was the only ""upscale"" burger place that didn't ask us how we wanted the patty done.  Kinda weird.  Again, this burger wouldn't be worth it at regular price but it was acceptable for the hh price.  

The bartenders as well as the rest of the staff were friendly.  I would only come back here for the noms and $2 beer on Tuesdays.

5574067,2014-05-17,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"So, this place. Located in the back corner of Town Square, stands out from the surrounding places. A) It's super close to the main parking lot in the back and B) It's sign I Love Burgers can be seen from the parking lot, making you crave burgers on the spot. Trust me, it's exactly what happened as I seen it. 

The atmosphere in the place is pretty low-key. It has indoor and outdoor seating areas, which is nice. You also don't have to walk through a door to get to the outdoor area, which is double nice. You just walk outside from the inside. Ta-da! Done. I'm assuming they shut that during Winter, but you know what, there really isn't a winter in Vegas anyway. There are chalk board walls scattered around the area whit random drawing on them which makes it pretty unique. 

Service is good. There isn't much to be done. You order when you walk in, take a number, and if you are sitting down they come find you, then give you your food. Ta-da. It's more of a ""fast-foodsie"" place, so everything is self serve, besides for the food. 

The food is decent. I've been roaming around the city for a good burger off the strip and have yet to find it. This places burgers are decent, but nothing to write home about. They are decently big and appropriately priced, at around 6-7 dollars depending on which one you get. I got the BBQ and was okay. With a name like BBQ, I thought there would be a lot more barbecue sauce on it then there actually was. The burger itself is comprised of: Lettuce, Tomato, American Cheese, Applewood-Smoked Bacon, Fried Onion Straws, and Homemade BBQ Sauce. I could hardly taste the BBQ sauce, since there was only a dab of it in the middle, which was horribly outnumbered by the bacon and onion straw taste. 

I also got an order of sweet potato fries because I've become a fan of them recently. I wasn't particularly impressed with those either. They add a lot of sugar and cinnamon to them, which makes a weird taste, in my opinion. I'm not a huge super sweet person, and the place I've had them before didn't put extra stuff on them. 

All and all, if you are in the area and need something to eat relatively quickly, consider this place. It's cheap-ish, fast, and pretty good, but it's not a place I'd travel from my native Hendersonville (haha) to go eat at.",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,2,2,3,LnqpnBHtO6r9wjRqjnWhEQ

She asked to see my ID with my bank of America check card (which has my picture on it) and I told her the purpose of having your picture on it is so you don't need to show your ID with a $18 purchase.

I was coming in for lunch with a friend and we both ordered the I Love Bacon Burger because it was their ""signature"" burger. If they had a signature burger, I was honestly expecting better! When you order a drink/combo, you go up to the soda machine and grab your own drink. You grab your own table. You put your number on a condiment stand and wait for your order to be served. 

For the quality of the food, it's not worth the price. 
When I first saw it, I was excited! It looked so delicious! It even looked fancy with the imprint ""I Love Burgers"" on the top bun!! The only place I've seen with an imprint on the buns is Unami Burgers. After a few snapshots of this beauty, I didn't expect the taste I had in my mouth - or the grease for that matter. I took my first bite and grease immediately squirted out from below my burger. As I continued to feast on this, oil/grease was dripping down from below my burger and my hand became messy. The burger tasted okay but it felt more cooked than it should be and it didn't really have a taste to it. The best part of the burger was the bacon and that's all I wanted. Bacon. :( The order also consists of fries and if I remember correctly, you have 3 options: reg fries, truffle fries, and I think sweet potato fries. 

I wouldn't come back if I came to Vegas again, but don't have high expectations for this place if you do plan on coming here.",pwuBqBf6VnC0JPTHP18Tfw,0,1,2,b6EdEUYlfNjwIQmKQc52dg

5674403,2013-08-28,1,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"I am really surprised about all of the bad reviews of this place.  I recently dined here for lunch with out of town friends during Restaurant Week.

The RW lunch menu was $20.12 per person, for 3 courses.  I went to their website beforehand and it appeared as if this was a decent deal - if you ordered the most expensive of each option, it would equal about $20, and the restaurant was donating $5 from each meal to charity. So they weren't really trying to make a ton of money off of this.

When we entered, there was a bit of a line.  Which was fine, because it gave us time to look over the menu and decide what to order.  The RW menu consisted of:

Nom Nom's
- These were really delicious! When they brought out my order, I thought it was for the 3 of us to share - but they weren't! My friends orders came out shortly after and I ended up taking a ton home.  For those that don't know - these are fried mac n cheese bites.  We decided we thought that they would be better if they had bacon inside.  I really liked the spicy nacho cheese dipping sauce on the side as well.

Choice of any burger with regular cut fries or sweet potato fries + a soda:
- I had the inferno burger.  I really liked it, because I am basically obsessed with jalapenos, but I didn't find it to be really HOT.  It also wasn't small, so even if I had purchased it individually, I wouldn't have been disappointed.  My only gripe was that the burger was super greasy, but that's not a huge deal.  The bun was really good and I like that they char ""I Love Burgers"" in to it.  I got the regular cut fries, which were only OK.  Nothing bad, but also they didn't wow me.  The addition of the soda was a bit overkill, because of the last course....

Any Shake:
- Their shakes are AMAZING!  I ordered the oreo shake and my friends each had the coffee shake.  Both were very delicious.  We had SO much food that it was really hard to fully enjoy it, but I managed! The bartender who made our shakes also told us that they could add alcohol if we wanted (we declined).  Good to know!  They serve the extra shake in the metal container on the side, and I was nowhere near finishing mine!

We sat at the bar, which is kind of small, but cute.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  They have a special on Sundays - BOGO mimosas or bloody marys.  And everyday their I 3 Burgers beer is only $2.  That's what we ordered, and it was what you'd expect for $2 (sorry, I'm a beer snob).

The place seemed pretty busy, but the manager stopped by to ask us how everything was and if we had any suggestions on how to improve the experience.  I thought that was really nice, and it shows that they are dedicated to improving on past complaints (of which we had none).",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,2,4,Bme5FHPPEVoAQHsa9rJAVQ

Because of the name I thought there would be a lot more burgers I would never eat on their menu, but there wasn't. Perfect for me since I like just regular ol' cheeseburgers, and mushroom burgers are about as adventurous as I get when ordering a burger. However after looking at the menu the ""Inferno Burger"" sounded tasty. It came with fresh jalapeños, jalapeño mayo, and pepperjack cheese. I love spicy food so I wasn't scared of the different types of spice it had. I got it with sweet cut fries with brown sugar and pepper. I also ordered the best thing on the menu, ""Nom Noms"" which is their fried macaroni and cheese appetizer. My bet friend ordered the same thing, only instead of fries se got tator tots.

5813218,2012-05-16,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"I had the Inferno. Incredible burger.

I love burgers. Let's get that out of the way because everyone else does a pun of sorts with this restaurant's name.

Apparently everyone had a terrible experience with this place except for me. I will admit that the price is a bit out of touch with reality - $6 for a 5 ounce burger is overpriced, to say the least. On the strip or in an amusement park, I would understand, but this place is overpriced for its value.

That being said, whether you put it in the category of Fast food or not: (Fuddrucker's, In-N-Out, 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc.) I will say this burger is incredible and contends as the champion of them all.

Their $6 Orange Delight shake was also overpriced, but it was ""Pulp Fiction"" good and I was wow'd to the core. I might return for the shake alone. 

The service was very above par.

5837406,2011-12-13,0,679eSYC15Sc17TN9Djj8sg,"**AN IMPROMPTU UYE AT I LOVE BURGERS**

Following the Elite Yelpy Santa Snack Attack and Town Square Shop Local Crawl CMYE, Misti Y. said she was hungry and was going to I Love Burgers, and asked if any local crawlers would like to join her for what turned out to be an impromptu UYE.  For, six crawlers ultimately did.  Besides myself, they were Anthony M., Diane T., Heather, Kevin P., and Vincent.  I looked forward to my meal, because since Restaurant Week when I just did not have time to fit it in, I wanted to sample I Love Burgers' hamburger at The Palazzo.  Now, here we were instead at a fairly new second location at Town Square.

Employees were very friendly, and seemed pleased to have our group there.  I was initially surprised that the menu was much more varied than just a few burgers, so it took me awhile to order, and I ultimately decided to sample various items.  In the end Misti shared her Fried Pickles, I shared my Nom Noms, and Kevin P. shared his Sweet Potato Fries.  So, we had a nice sampling among us, except for the intriguing milk shakes in several unusual variations.  Maybe next time!

To my further surprise, I was more impressed with the Nom Noms and Ahi Tuna Sliders than the 5-oz. Classic Burger reflected in the restaurant's name.  If I see a food item in a restaurant's name, I just assume that this will be its featured and foremost dish.  Not so this night!  While the burger was good, it was not real juicy.  It was covered by a fresh tomato slice and nicely melted cheese which I liked, but also a leaf of dark green lettuce which was fresh but not crisp.  And, I prefer my lettuce crisp.  I very much liked the soft bun on which the burgers are served.  And, as I suspected, 5 ounces of meat were plenty; the 7-ounce patties should be reserved for the most serious carnivores, or those just focusing on a single burger--not someone like me adding three sliders and Nom Noms.

I had ordered my burger medium-rare, as did Diane rather vociferously, and we were told that the burgers would be prepared medium-rare.  While mine was cooked a little beyond that mark it was close to medium-rare, so I have no complaint about that.  But by its appearance I could tell that Diane's burger was plainly cooked medium-well to well done.  And poor Vincent never got his ordered hamburger at all until we were about ready to leave.  The kitchen had somehow forgotten to make it!  Not a good sign!

I found the French Fries to be crispy and very good tasting.  I also liked the one Sweet Potato Fry I tried.  And, while Fried Pickle slices were rather thin, they were good and tasty, too.  

The ahi tuna in the sliders was fresh, cool, and rare, just like they should be, with quite spicy slaw but cool avocado slices and carrot shavings to offset its hotness.  Buns were soft and pliable.

And, the Nom Noms were great!  I would come back just for them!  These large bites of fried mac 'n cheese were so cheesy and rich that I only ate two of six, and gladly gave the remainder to my dining companions to see for themselves what I was raving about.  The Nom Noms had been deep-fried, and when bitten into exuded gooey melted cheese just waiting to be released.  These heavenly bites could also be dipped in an accompanying cheese sauce for even more cheesy goodness.

Ordinarily, I rate a restaurant based on just what I encounter, based on my tasting of food items, and my own overall experience.  Rather than relate what dining companions would like me to add to my own observations, I generally advise them to write their own reviews based on their own dining experience if they feel strongly about something that occurred to them.  So, here, based on my total experience alone, I was ready to award 4 stars.  But I don't feel that I can ignore Diane's overdone burger or Vincent's missing burger, which I saw with my own eyes.  They were part of my observations, too.  Thus, I regard this as a 3-star overall dining experience.  

And, while I would rate many other places that are known for their hamburgers higher for that single food category alone, this is not just a hamburger joint.  And, that should be kept in mind by diners who like a greater diversity of offerings in one location, including salads and chicken as well.  Or by eclectic diners like me who like to mix things up in the same meal.  So I think I Love Burgers has promise.  And, I will probably return.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,2,3,U6Kf33e7l2I3ny_9AoDs9w

The reason they aren't getting 4 or 5 stars is that I feel as though they are a little pricey for the fast food atmosphere of the place. Not to mention I've had better garlic fries at less qualified places.... (while watching a giants game in San Fran) with that said though.........
