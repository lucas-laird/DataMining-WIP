1192,2011-05-19,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Ate at China Poblano when I was in Vegas last week and hadn't looked at any Yelp reviews prior. I'm surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here. I thought it was AMAZING. Most importanly, it was priced appropriately, unlike so many places in Vegas.

Some notes:

-The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!)
-Service was great
-Food was creative and delicious
-A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word ""ugly"" in the name), but most were spot on. 
-Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound. 
-The salt-air margaritas are genius.",Te1y5afUMwaTe62ZiB8Igg,0,0,5,h9y-jgYduS-bffPLxZdLnA

17448,2010-12-28,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"My wife and I were eager to try this restaurant having just finished a five year stint in Washington DC where we became big fans of Chef Jose Andres.  China Poblano didn't disappoint.

We sat at the Dim Sum/Noodle Bar (there's also a Taco Bar as well as regular dining tables) overlooking chefs meticulously preparing different dim sum dishes.  My wife ordered a margarita, which comes topped with a salt foam in lieu of the traditional salt-rimmed glass, while I ordered a Singapore Sling.  Both were quite tasty.

While we looked over the unique menu we ordered up some lengua tacos (don't knock 'em until you try 'em), which were one of our favorites at Oyamel (a Jose Andres restaurant in DC).  The tacos were as delicious as we remembered them.

Meanwhile, the dim sum chefs in front of us inspired us to try some lamb pot stickers which had a nice flavor highlighted by some cumin and other seasonings.  A gentleman next to us was eating some type of Chinese sandwich which looked and smelt fantastic. We decided to get one for ourselves to see if it tasted as good as it looked.  Sure enough, the Rou Jia Mo sandwich was simply awesome.  My wife and I agreed that it would make a great late night snack...especially if you had a few drinks.

The one downside about most of the dishes at China Poblano is their size.  If you go on an empty stomach, plan on ordering a few dishes.  Of course, that also means you get to try more dishes which is something I can live with.

Now that my wife and I are based on the West Coast we go to Vegas often, and now that Jose Andres has a great place like China Poblano here I'm guessing we'll be frequent visitors.",suFnkZ3clVb1aqdWkfpAog,0,0,4,cLZ-JcfKuhZ837xZlVifgQ
22452,2012-07-16,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"On our recent trip to Vegas, my mother and I came here because of a rave review by some people we met on the trip. My mom wanted Chinese and I wanted Mexican, so the restaurant seemed perfect. 
The prices were shocking ($5 per taco? seriously?) so we ended up sharing the chips & salsa, Mongolian beef, and 20 vegetable fried rice. The food was delicious, but the prices are outrageous. It was $32 for the beef (which was basically a glorified salad). It was a delicious strip steak, but tiny, we were expecting more. The fried rice was delicious but not worth $20. Plus, the amount of food we were given did not satisfy us.
When we arrived my mother was starving, and she left unsatisfied so we ended up having a second (tiny) dinner at Serendipity 3.

56225,2015-06-02,4,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"My review is based on the Mexican side of China Poblano.  My buddy highly recommended the tacos here, ""you got to try them, they will put a smile to your face.""  I was skeptical because what would a Spaniard know about tacos?  A tortilla is considered an omelette in Spain.  But, I ran with my buddy's suggestion. 

I did find myelf to be in an identity crisis when I walked in because the restuaurant is literally divided between Chinese ladies making noodles on my left and Mexican ladies making warm tortillas on my right.  I decided to sit on the right side to see the ladies make fresh hand made toritillas.  

I had a few tacos: lengua (beef tongue), fish, hongos (mushrooms), pork belly, and barbacoa (braised short rib).  All the tacos had high quality ingredients, from the condiments to the meats.  My notable favorites were the beef tongue and hongos.  Beef tongue was very tender and seasoned well. Hongos had perfectly sauteed mushrooms on top of fresh guacamole. Very tasty.  

Service was slow but staff were apologetic.  I would definitely be back for the tacos again.  I appreciate that Jose Andres maintained a traditional taco and did not kill it with unnecessary fusion techniques. I definitely did walk out with a smile on my face.",jLTC4D4IrL5HPh3Vv7Y92w,4,4,4,Ts2uI7W3iASGsdEfbBO_cw

93116,2016-08-07,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Not impressed at all. After a long night, you just NEED that noodle soup. Since I'm staying in the Cosmo, I noticed this place and performed a quick Yelp. Ive noticed most of the reviews mentioned the service was lacking and the food is good. I had a complete opposite experience, buy anywho. Eddie my server went through the menu and I explained to him all I really want is the noodle soup so he guided me to swallow in the cloud (their version of a Hong Kong wonton soup).  Great, I love wonton soups. So for the price the portion is small. Which I get, branded by a chef and I am in Vegas. The first thing one should do when they are handed noodle soup is to sample the broth. I'm not sure how they make their broth, but I might as well have drank water.  The broth was tasteless  and unsatisfying. To make it a little better, I had to use ALL the chile sauce that accompanied the dish. Which is fine because I enjoy spice, but what about the next person who cannot handle spice?  Anyways, the noodles was overcooked. It lacked the chewiness that noodles should have. Everything else was tolerable. 

The only saving grace from me walking out was the server who served me. Eddie thanks for making this meal tolerable.

107542,2014-02-13,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"My friend talked up Chef Jose Andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to DC that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to China Poblano at the Cosmopolitan, I figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it. 

I'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and I'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good. 

Just know what to order. 

The 18 Monk Noodle was so amazing. You don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. Our waiter suggested we opt for the Tuna Ceviche as opposed to the Ceviche Pargo and I could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. The tuna was so fresh. The soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. 

We also ordered the Queso Fundido, and the XO Scallops in XO Sauce. I wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and I don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. That was our mistake--but don't make it yours! A side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve GREAT, okay?

After dollar signs kept racing through my head as I tried to figure out the damage, I wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her Mango Sticky Rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #YOLO 

Anyways, it was so incredibly good! It's not your traditional Thai-place-MSR by any means. It's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as I write this all I really want to do is drive down to the Cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. 

As far as the service, and given it was a Tuesday night, we got seated right away. Our waiter, Miller, was awesome! He didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and God bless him for it.",8zb_IBPGPJjh97qe98BDWw,1,0,4,_cbb11U16PcVb0GoSLxDQw

115134,2011-01-29,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Let Down. 

The concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre ""tastes"" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.  

For the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.  

**This review is based upon trying the following:
--pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart)
--When Pigs Fly
--Dan dan noodles
--Lengua tacos
--Pork belly tacos with pineapple
--Carnitas

Mediocre service was the icing on the cake. (no water, no silverware...

Being from San Diego it was just ok.  The salsa for it was worth the $5.  For the main course we got the Mongolian beef lettuce and Kao Lao Loa noodles.  We were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  If you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  The one piece off beef I had was good.  Too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  The worst part was the noodles.  When I order noodles I expect a plate full of noodles.  This was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  There was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  I almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.

The Mongolian beef tasted like a few pieces of beef soaked in watered down soy sauce. The dish had a ton of old lettuce and really should have been called a salad.

The Twenty-vegetables fried rice was simply not good. Like some of the other reviews said it did not taste like fried rice. Adding chicken for the extra $5 was a mistake as it certainly did not make the meal taste better.

The idea of this place seemed like a good idea but as my group looked over the menu, none of the food was what we were expecting.  I understand the concept of this place being that you all order small dishes to share within the group.  The waitress explained that normally you need about 2-3 dishes per person to fill you up. Keep in mind each of these small dishes are about 5-25 dollars.  With a large party, this place is not worth it for you.

Our waiting asked if we would like to have some chips and salsa for the table. We said sure so they brought out two sets since we had 7 people. Then she goes, I can bring out some guacamole if you guys would like as well. We said, sure. So they brought out two bowls

I was really craving tacos but noticed it was 5.50-10.50 for one. I asked her how big the tacos were and she said 2-3 bites worth. Sorry, I don't care how good this taco was... It's not worth that price. I can get a better tasting taco in east la from a taco truck. 

Their ""famous"" fried rice didn't wow me either. Tasted like something I could get at any regular Chinese place. 

When we got out check with a grand total of 171 dollars we were pretty confused since we only order a taco each and some fried rice. We then noticed we were charged 12 dollars for chips and salsa and then 15 dollars for each bowl of guacamole. Pretty shocked at this point. Cool. 

Got home and looked at my bank account to find that 15 extra dollars was charged on my debit card from them. So overall, I'd never come to this place again.",LRpUOwB9JCMVuG8I7q7zuw,2,0,1,5rTRlMVMzb-r8eqUNJ73gw

Start off with the salt air margarita. It's a brilliant idea (you taste the salt with every sip instead of having to lick the salt from the rim off the glass) and is well executed.  Some of my favorites: the mushroom taco is the best vegetarian taco I've ever had; the brussel sprouts are divine and dressed in a scrumptious salsa verde; and it's hard to put your fork down with the tuna ceviche and shrimp mojo on your table.

China Poblano was no different and is now my favorite of all of his restaurants (I've previously been to Zatinya, Oyamel and Jaleo in DC).  I went in December of 2012 while staying at the Cosmopolitan.  It is a very casual place with a fun, relaxed vibe.  We ordered the Golden Pigs (lightly fried BBQ pork buns served with condensed milk) and Har Gau for appetizers.  My boyfriend was skeptical of the milk being served with the buns but they were delicious!  The perfect combination of sweet, savory and salty.  For our entrees we ordered one carnitas and one lengua taco which were both perfect in every way.  The waitstaff was quick and friendly, the food amazing and the prices extremely reasonable for Vegas.  I am returning to Vegas in July and this is the first place I am seeking out for lunch.

Our server was very attentive and very knowledgable of their menu, he gave the best recommendations and checked-in on us regularly. I was quite impressed at how each dish was explained to us as they were being served.

As for the food, we ordered the pork belly tacos, chicken wings, 21 vegetable fried rice and golden pork buns with condensed milk. Each was a winner, but my friend and I both agreed that the golden pork buns were little pieces of heaven. I would drive back to Vegas anytime if it means I could have this dish again.

Must haves:
Salt Air Margaritas!!!! These were divine. The salt foam is interesting in a good way. Our table could not stop ordering them.
Sui Mai! Small, but DELICIOUS and they have gold flakes. Come on!
Gaucamole - spicy, but exceptional quality great with tortillas or the chips
Queso Fundido was good, but not over the top delicious
Viva China taco
Scallop Ceviche! These come out as little scallop shooters on half limes. You shoot the scallop and squeeze the lime with the spices on it. SO GOOD. Along with the margaritas these were our favorite of the evening.
When Pigs Fly - Great pork buns, better than most dim sum I've had. Not too much bread.

Meh:
Lobster taco - didn't care for it
Porkbelly taco - too much sauce!

After all, what could be better than a restaurant that serves both Chinese and Mexican food?  How amazing would it be to gorge myself on salsa and crab wontons?  

I was a little disappointed in our magical adventure into Chinese/Mexican fusion, mostly because the Mexican far outshined the Chinese.  We enjoyed the fresh made chips, salsa, various tacos, and homemade margarita mix.  In my opinion, the number one item on the menu was the bean taco.  Whatever they did to the refried beans made them super smooth and full of flavor, I actually ended up ordering another after my first.  

The Chinese portion of our meal fell very short.  Usually one of our favorite dishes, the Hot and Sour soup was so gelatinous that we barely even ate any and the pork buns lacked flavor and were not cooked well.

Trendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending on your view, but I took it as cool).  It has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from Mexican and Chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  My wife and I shared chips and salsa, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  I got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  My wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.

For our ""main courses"" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), I had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  The shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  My wife had the Beijing glass, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different Asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  She loved it.

Some people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  Well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  The wait staff tells you that.  Our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had ordered -- and we were.  Far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but China Poblano serves properly sized meals.  Two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  If not, I dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the Strip instead.  If I'm going to spend $30 on a meal, I'd honestly rather have high-quality food than ""all-you-can-eat.""",zDkfei4w7N7sWyODh3RepQ,2,2,5,zCORoC9oNDxuYD70ISRTOQ

However, I feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at China Poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to STAY AWAY. Seriously, avoid this place and save your money. I used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. The service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (Save for a delightful bartender named Steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but I chalk that up to the general attitude of the Cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. Since they opened, I've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. Alas, that is no more. It's been a couple of months since I dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. The dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). This was irritating, but not shun-worthy. That was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. Our server, Richard, I admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. Once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. This was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. Why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. My companion and I each ordered salads. Her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and I the tuna ceviche (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). The pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. I waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. I finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who I mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps I might get my lunch before my companion finished. His response was a dippy 'Well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. That is the single worst excuse I've ever heard, and frankly, as I learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to EVER take out only part of a table's order. Not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. I feel just awful that I inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. I felt that unwelcome. No matter - I will never take another guest there again and I hope to save many a dear Yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster.

I tried two dishes.  The deep fried wantons and the Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup.  Both dishes were delicious.

Scallops ceviche:  DO NOT ORDER.  Its three tiny scallops... and thats it!  

Tuna ceviche:  A decent portion and has good flavor.

Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich:  Amazing!  The best thing we ordered but I think I killed it in three bites.  Its a slider size so dont expect a lot of food.

However, my brother was entertaining a client during the exact same time in a different area of the restaurant and he said his service was perfect so I guess it is hit or miss.

I will question the management because when you are in Las Vegas and go out to eat and 3 of the items we ordered were all out and it was only 7pm . Bad bad bad bad management .

The tacos were very good . Salencia and chicken tacos were wonderful . Guacamole, both spicy and regular were very good also. Didn't care for the salsa at all . Tasted like a bad attempt at a smoky bbq sauce . 

My service was so off the wall. We ordered an appetizer but that was the very last thing we received . Shouldn't that be the first thing you receive with a meal? Our meals came in bits and pieces . I would receive one taco and then 10 minutes later I received my other taco. This was the same for every guest in my party . One gentlemen in my party received his entree first and then 20 min later received his salad . Just seems all backwards . We had to remind the waitress at the end that we ordered salsa and she finally brought it . I wish we had just forgot because I didn't care for it .

The dishes overall were just okay. Some of the flavors were good, but the portions were small. I ordered the lobster taco, which only had two small chunks of lobster. The tacos are tiny. My taco was only two small bites. $10 for that? My friends also ordered tacos, and were extremely dissatisfied.

Went to Cosmo on busy Saturday night with family in from LA -we were starving, unfamiliar w the restaurants & after skimming the menus- seeing like 100+ people in line (and SITTING ON THE FLOOR)waiting to get in the buffet we settled here- (by settled I mean gave up here) same as others reviews said :""the hostess' were lifeless zombies who said its a 25min wait -you can sit at the counter it's faster(25 min was the faster option) then she repeated 2+ times in a snobby way "" you can do take out"" we were like take out what and walk around eating it?? Lol
We waited the 25- my brother inlaw & his girlfriend got a cocktail @ the burger/shake place @ put their name down for a table seeing who would seat us first.. This place sat us (burger place was supposed to call on the cell when table was ready & NEVER did-lmfao) so we sit @ the dim sum side(mexican side had more life to its side) where three very focussed dim sum makers bang out sheet pans of something wrapped in dough.
Menu : tacos 4.50-10.00 per taco ..
Noodles-1 fried rice w/out meat-
dim sum not on a cart-
$15 guac-..no free chips n salsa=($4 )
Like everyone says: carnitas taco was tastiest.. But @5.50 the other persons right- they had carnitas @ del taco which I could have easily had
8.88 ""street"" sandwich size of egg mcmuffin- & I'm not sure what ""street"" serves this but we sent it back based on =size+taste+price
Had $15 coctel de Cameron was no where near a coctel @ Mar y Tierra -had like 3-4 decent sized shrimps =Fifteen dollars..
Fresh chips where good Bcz we were starving
Mole fries where not crispy @ tasted like frozen fries.. Mole was heavy on the cinnamon & unappealing

My wife and I came here for a quick snack on May 9th around 3 pm.  Unfortunately, our quick snack turned into an hour long exercise in patients.

The food was okay to good, the service was although polite, slow and disappointing.

We were seated quickly, as there were only 10 or fewer people in the restaurant at the time, and ordered the Golden Pigs and Quail Egg Siu Mai.

Let's talk about the food first.

The Golden Pigs:
- These are fried and comes with a side of condensed milk.  Quite tasty and the condensed milk is not super sweet which was a pleasant surprise.  The filling of BBQ pork was also very nice.  It seemed like a good ratio of bun to filling, be aware they do come out hot! FYI if fried is not your thing they have a steamed variation without the condensed milk, and you will be pleased.

Quail Egg Siu Mai:
- My wife and I are suckers for eggs, and she has been talking up these Siu Mai for years.  For me, it seemed like a pretty standard Siu Mai, but with the quail egg, it was something different and definitely worth a try.

Our waitress was nice, and we always had full water.  Unfortunately, our experience diminished from here.  After we had our food we did not see our waitress again for around 30ish min.  We even started to consider asking another staff member to find her when we finally saw her come out of a back room. 

Overall, the food and atmosphere are interesting, but the service was unfortunate (as previously stated, the restaurant was fairly empty at this point), and the price point for the items I feel was high for what we got.  But hey it is Vegas!",rgPJB0RecLErKXxaKI_wOg,0,0,3,bzSOwgnMkw5TdbHg_ChIew

Like many of Jose Andres' other restaurants, China Poblano serves small plates.  Thus it is possible to try many dishes in one sitting.

The Queso Fundido, the Shrimp Mojo, and the Cochinita Taco were superb dishes that stood out above the rest.  The Queso Fundido is wonderfully rich, as one would expect, and is accented well by the spicey chorizo.  The Shrimp Mojo had a nice harmony of flavors between the garlic and the roasted poblano peppers.  And, the Cochinita Taco is everything you would hope a slow cooked pork taco would be.

Huitlacoche Noodles - for mushroom lovers only, but if you love mushrooms and quite a hefty amount of spice - you'll love this dish.  They fail to mention the chiles in the dish.

The music and decor created an upbeat, enjoyable atmosphere. Although seating is limited in the dining room, they do offer seats at the bar(s). They have two sets of bars.

The lamb pot stickers were okay. The pot stickers presentation was nice. All four of the pot stickers were elegantly made together to appear like a pizza with four perforations that made separation from each other much easier. They had an odd smell and no real flavor. The pot stickers were simple there to eat. Would I order them again? No. 

The second item I ordered was the Ocean's Nest. It had a wonderful medley of vegetables and seafood nestled on top of the crispy, fried noodles. Although I expected soft noodles for the dish, the crispy noodles become soft as the lightly sauced dish saturated some of the noodles. I wasn't a big fan of the crispness of the noodles particularly when trying to cut the noodles so it was easier for me to eat. I thought the dish wasn't bad.

Yes, prices are higher, but what else would one expect for Las Vegas, let alone a Jose Andres restaurant?  Be prepared to drop at least $60 for 2 people, but it does provide some unique dishes and ambiance that makes it worth going.  

Went there when the brunch menu was up.  A rundown of some of the items we got:
Barbacoa Taco-- the beef was soft, tender, and flavorful.  Cactus added a good texture.  Great taco choice.
Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich-- tiny and cute, but also very tasty.  Didn't know what to expect, but essentially a small circular pita-like bread and some braised pork put in the pocket.  Tender pork and fried bread=yum.  
Carne Machaca-- probably the least impressive dish, the spicy sauce overpowered the whole dish and the beef cut into strips was chewy and dry, not very tasty.  I wouldn't recommend getting this...
**Chilaquiles con Chorizo-- comes served in a small skillet, and DELICIOUS, hearty and filling.  Great balance of sauce, tortillas, chorizo, egg and CHEESE.  Seemingly simple, but the quality of ingredients makes a difference.  YUM.  If you go to brunch, I HIGHLY recommend getting this dish!!!  This dish made the trip worth it.
**Tres Lychees-- was originally debating between this or the mango sticky rice for dessert.  Definitely made the RIGHT choice in going with this!!  The lychee cake was topped with fresh lychees, lychee sorbet, and a rum foam.  The rum foam was a bit much, but the lychee sorbet was fantastic.  Lychee sorbet + lychee cake = best dessert choice, indeed.

**Best of the meal.  I would get these dishes over again.  Bam.

Very filling and tasty, and we had a very attentive server (Christin) who wasn't annoyed that we kept adding to our order as we continued (instead of ordering at once). And the food came out in a timely manner.  Only mistake is that they gave us Chilaquiles when we hadn't ordered it, and they apologized and found the rightful customers.

796199,2014-02-19,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"The food here was fantastic. It is designed to be eaten as small plate, family style dining, so we ordered 7 plates for 3 people for dinner. That was a perfect amount of food for the three of us (all girls, but one big eater!). Plus we split two desserts, but could have easily done one.  Everything was delicious, but the standouts were the golden pig steamed buns, Dan Dan noodles, mango sticky rice and the duck tongue tacos. 
Cocktails were tasty. Reasonable for Vegas, although definitely pricey if you are going to eat a full meal with cocktails, mains, and dessert. 
My one huge complaint was the service, and only very specifically in regards to the hostess. When we arrived, we checked in and were told without a reservation the wait could be 45 minutes to an hour, but since we were willing to sit anywhere that was first available (bar or table) usually something would open in about 20 minutes. We were escorted to the waiting area, and a server came by very quickly to offer us drinks. Then we were basically ignored for an hour and a half, when everyone around us (also without a reservation) was seated first, despite having similarly sized groups. When the hostess did acknowledge us, every time she promised that we were next to be seated and we were just waiting for a table to open up. Except that each time, she indicated a different table that we were waiting for.  When bar seats finally did open up an hour into our wait, she told us that we were just waiting for a table to leave - that they had already paid, and then showed another group to that table. When a table finally did open up, there was a huge miscommunication among the staff about who was going to get it, which arrangement and so on.  I feel like if we had not been persistent about being seated, we would have been completely ignored. 
I wouldn't have been so cranky about the wait time if my expectations had been properly managed from the beginning-customer service 101. When, 40 minutes in, she kept telling us that we would be seated right away, we just got more irritated every time that turned out to be untrue. If we were honestly kept apprised of the situation, we likely would have elected to come back another night with a reservation. 
Since we had been basically repeatedly misinformed, my friend asked if we could please have a complimentary guacamole for the wait. The hostess was super reluctant to help us and said she would have to ask her boss, but as soon as our server came to the table, the server offered to bring us some on the house. After we were in the server's hands, the dinner was fantastic. Food came out really fast and the servers were friendly and efficient.  The hostess was likely enough to keep me from returning, at least for awhile, and definitely not without a reservation. When I pay $180 for a meal, I expect to treated with at least honesty and courtesy by every staff member, especially the ""face"" of the restaurant.",SX_tu9_A3kAio8Vm6lAg1Q,0,0,3,0d1XL5xqagWYGiR1wy-YKg

803108,2013-01-27,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"While I really enjoyed the ambience of China Poblano, and the love the idea of a restaurant like this, the food was really hit or miss.

Tuna Ceviche: Outstanding! The unexpected touch was the amaranth seeds, which contributed a wonderful crunch that made this dish memorable. It was so tasty and refreshing that we contemplated a second order.

Chilaquiles: These were not the casserole-style chilaquiles I am used to, but it was a welcome difference. They more closely resembled nachos, but were among the best nachos I have had in recent memory.

Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice: My opinion of this rice might be different if this dish didn't cost $20. I understand that it costs a restaurant a fair amount to obtain that many different vegetables, and I certainly don't mind paying for that...but this dish just had no punch! Many of the vegetables were indistinguishable from one another, and the dominant taste was soy sauce. It was beautiful to look at, but that's the best I can say. I much prefer the $6 fried rice I can get at my favorite sushi place back home.

Tacos: The tacos, unfortunately, were a miss. The chicharron didn't bring anything to the party on my Cochinita taco, and I didn't care for the aftertaste either.

Bottom line -- China Poblano is worth a visit for the ambience and certain dishes, but you can definitely skip the tacos. I'm certainly looking forward to going back to try some of the Asian dishes.",gx7Qhdu6hDBF2LajZYQlYQ,1,0,3,UGAmGg7YOOinCD5703bmqQ

I came to China Poblano during its opening week. A couple feet ahead of me, at the front of the restaurant, was Big Papi himself: Jose Andres. Wearing baby blue, tweeting from his Blackberry, eating what looked like every single dish on the menu, teaching his three daughters (who were sitting in descending order by height) how to use chopsticks - how cute.     

Anyway, the food. The bottom-line for me at any restaurant is the final product. The flavors, the textures, the temperature contrasts, all the good shit, working in unison to evoke memories or tell new stories. Value, ambiance, service - that stuff's nice, too - but I'm not going to knock off stars from any restaurant if the waitress didn't fill my cup of coffee six times, or if I couldn't understand the gibberish coming out of the Filipino waitress' mouth. Notably, the ambiance and service at this restaurant were super-chill (like, 5/5 chill). 

Having said that, the food here was generally very good, too. (We ordered the guacamole, fried potatoes with XO, chicken mole tacos, the lemon-tree shrimp, and some other stuff I can't remember right now. The ocean nest was fine, too.)

To start with, you might like to read this informative story about the ideas behind the place: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13andres.html The decor is very intriguing, with design coming from SEED. The hybridity of Mexico and China is reflected in the interesting visuals--Mao next to Frida Kahlo and other variations. The entrance includes a fast-food looking window (Chinese Food), complete with noodle bar, and a second fast-food window (Mexican Food) with a tortilla bar. The visual design elements heighten the diner's sense that something hybrid is at play here. We really enjoyed our server who was very informative about the choices. We sampled the Love Is in the Air (a molecular gastronomic take on an heirloom tomato salad). We found the play between salty and sweet to be incredible. The sugar foam is very interesting and I found my taste buds unable to determine, at any one moment, whether it was salty or sweet. The Beijing Glass was perhaps the best noodle dish that we have had. It was outstanding in every respect. Dancing Eggplant is a visual dish that includes bonito flakes that move up and down due to the steam rising from the cooked eggplant. Again, an outstanding dish with perfectly cooked eggplant and a delicious sauce. The only down side was the taco (Chicen Mole). As other reviewers have offered, there is nothing to write home about in terms of the tortillas. They don't seem to replicate street food quality. The chicken was tender, but not the best mole. Perhaps they can work out those kinks. Overall, you shouldn't miss this place. The experience and food is intriguing.

The menu was more small eats/ tapas/ small portion type foods instead of large plates for each person, so sharing is a good idea.  I was a little skeptical about how the food would taste but it was actually good.  We ordered - 

1) Queso Fundido - like a melted cheese and you eat it with corn tortillas.  Kind of a small portion, and somewhat expensive, but it was still good. 
2) Pancita al Pastor - pork and pineapple taco.  It was small, but it was really good.
3) Hot and Sour Soup - came in a super large bowl, and tasted much better than the typical take out.  I think they added some mexican spices to this soup
4) Chips and Salsa - typical

+Unique concept of Mexican and Chinese food in one restaurant
+Great variety in the menu
+Tried the duck tongue (""Silenco"" taco) and it was very tasty and memorable, meat was tender

The meh:
-Servers did not make eye contact when serving and communicating with us.  I felt a general feeling that the person serving us just did not want to be there.  Enthusiasm was very low
-Prices are way too high for what you get, value is low
-Ordered the lobster taco, meat was dry, pieces of shell was in the meat, hardly chewable and edible ($10 a lobster taco)
-One tortilla is not enough to support the contents of the tacos they serve.  Filling of taco would fall through.  I'm under the impression that they don't have the logical sense to place 2 tortillas to support the contents of the taco or that they are very stingy on not using 2 tortillas.  Either way...not good, it defeats the purpose of eating a taco when the contents fall right through the tortilla

Because the menu is Chinese and Mexican food, I felt the need to try a taco too. I went with the setas taco, which is wild mushroom and guacamole. And also very tasty. To drink, I had one of the juices of the day, which was cherry. If I drank alcohol, I could've had that as a mimosa. When I was finished, I was presented a dessert menu. Now, I knew better, but they had churros, so I had to go for it. Those were decent and came with Mexican hot chocolate for dipping. I personally found the flavors didn't mix well, but others might think it's delicious. I ate the churros and drank the hot chocolate, win-win.

China Poblano isn't cheap, but nothing within the walls of the Cosmopolitan is. I was on vacation and I didn't care. If you are on a budget, I'd take a look at the prices first, but I promise, it will be money well spent if you go for it.",KmKC1eX7AqPGVKsQJrFtSw,0,0,4,XdIvZgV6DO69hgWZ36mkBg

The pot stickers were very juicy inside and crispy outside, but the flavor was nothing special. Everything else was exceptional. Also ask for the hot sauce.

1099085,2011-03-26,5,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"There are certain DOs and DON'Ts when planning a trip to Jose Andres' Chinese/Mexican restaurant China Poblano, located inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

DO: pronounce the name right.
It's China, like Chee-nah, Poh-blah-no. Next person I hear calling it ""Chai-nah"" is getting chopsticks straight up the culo.

DO: realize its Chinese/Mexican, not fusion.
If you're looking for wacky dishes like orange chicken tacos, it's not happening, bub. Although they have a few plates that play with both sides of the aisle (like the Viva China tacos), the ""fusion,"" as it were, is in the juxtaposition of the cuisines. How many times have you been eating a taco and thought, ""This is brilliant! Now if I only had a wonton to go with it..."" I mean, if I only had a nickel for every time, right?

DO: go in a big group.
Food at China Poblano is served dim sum style, which means you'll be ordering lots of small plates. Get a group of about 5 or 6 and have people try to order different items, and you could have a veritable cornucopia of food at your fingertips. Dim sum is most fun when you have a lot of people anyway.

Here's the problem with China Poblano (which I believe is Spanish for ""Chinese Poblano"") -- there's a list of DON'Ts as well.

DON'T: go in famished.
In fact, don't even go in quite hungry. For China Poblano's menu is mostly ""dim sum"" style, which is Chinese for ""frackin' small."" If you're going in for a hearty meal, I'd pass right on and head down the hall to Holstein's. If you're ready to proverbially eat a horse, you'll have to get three plates in before you even register a proverbial hoof.

DON'T: go in on a budget.
You're going to break it. I promise. The dishes range from $8 to $25. Yeah. For dim sum. I had a plate of 6 wontons, and two fish tacos. Add a Diet Coke and I was up in the $26 range. For two dishes and a soda. Again, if I had gone down the hall to Holstein's, I could have had a huge burger, fries and a beer for less.

China Poblano is NOT a bad restaurant. The food was tasty (although I've had better Chinese AND Mexican food -- thank you Emily), the atmosphere was kitschy, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Plates usually showed up less than five minutes after you order them too, which is a nice touch. But in the end, one of the most hyped-up restaurants in the resort drops the ball somewhere along the way.

If you REALLY must have Chinese and Mexican on the same plate on the Las Vegas Strip, there's a Panda Express that shares the same space with Chipotle next to Harrah's.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,5,4,3,fFWNMvzSxm1EGGR9ynX9Hg

We had an assortment of tacos (carnitas for her, beef tongue and pork belly for me) along with the shrimp dumplings (my friend had never tried any kind of dim sum so we figured, why not). Pretty good tacos, not sure what to think of the dumplings. The mango sticky rice was a little strange and not what you would expect but still kind of cool.

While this would not be my first choice for Mexican food or Chinese, it is a cool place to go to in Cosmo with fairly decent prices or with a big group (lots of things to share).",3CMiTAhq_o_GP1tLs-ihbg,0,0,3,2k5GakYayTDYm3YrIVYhyw

I have stayed in the Cosmopolitan before and seen this place quite a few times but never stopped in, so I was intrigued to try a place that served both Chinese and Mexican cuisines. The mexican would be a hard sell though, since I'm from San Diego, but we tend to have horrible Chinese food so I figured it might be a good balance.

The wait staff was very attentive, and for that, I was very appreciative, and if Yelp allowed me to break out my star reviews into different categories, service would get a full 5 stars, while the food itself.... would get the 2. The portions are quite small, but that's to be expected in Las Vegas, especially for a sit down restaurant at a higher end resort such as the Cosmo, so the price to portion ratio honestly didn't bug me all that much, and the waitress let us know that it would probably be best to order at least 2 items from the menu apiece (although she did point out one or 2 items that had more generous portions). Again I really appreciated her letting us know this ahead of time.

The two dishes I personally had were the Dan Dan Mian noodles, and the Pork and Shirmp won tons, and the table had some chips and salsa to share. The Dan Dan Mian was an unmitigated disaster. There was decent spice to the dish, but it literally tasted like gooey flavorless chalk. I couldn't taste a hint of pork, or any discernible soy or pork flavor to the sauce, although the noodles were cooked well. The Won Tons unfortunately were also pretty much flavorless as well. So flavorless in fact that I couldn't tell which won tons were which (they serve you some pork and some shrimp), they were just small marble sized lumps of unseasoned meat paste. The Won ton wrappers themselves weren't too bad of a texture, a lot lighter and less greasy than some I've had in the past.

The chips and salsa were pretty standard, which I expected. It's hard for me to not be a chips and salsa snob when I live 15 minutes from the mexican border, and have tortilla chips made fresh, only feet from the table as we are sat. So they were decent for non so-cal chips and salsa.

All in all, I wouldn't go back again, but that being said, there was nothing so horrible that would make me tell someone to avoid this place at all costs, since tastes certainly differ from person to person, and the service was very good.",Bzqc8L1MPc5amuU4NXbG0Q,0,0,2,d8FgykbO59q6LrabU8sEyw

I was really excited to try his new restaurant in Vegas, and it did not disappoint!  I came here with a group of 4 people, and we ordered 11 dishes I believe + 2 desserts.  They have a few chefs working at the front of the restaurant so people walking by can watch them make handmade tortillas and hand pulled noodles.  They also have two take out windows with a smaller menu that you can order from.  The decor is modern with Chinese and Mexican elements and made me think of something I would see in an Urban Outfitters catalog or on display at the MoMA.

The guacamole and hand made tortillas were to die for!  I could have just eaten guacamole for dinner.  And they have the best tortillas I've ever had.  My favorite presentation was the scallop ceviche, which they place on a carmelized key lime.  They lightly spray vodka on it, you eat the scallop, and then squeeze the lime into your mouth.  Almost like taking a tequila shot.  I also thought the hand pulled noodles were amazing and cooked to perfection.  We ordered the Unruly Monk soup, and it was very light and refreshing, but at the same time, full of vegetables.  I would probably come here for lunch and order just that and maybe a small side dish.  We also ordered another soup, Caldo Tlalpeno, which I thought was more fusion, and I also enjoyed that soup as well.

We ordered the Nice, but Naughty dish with lotus root and pea shoots which doesn't taste very Chinese because the pea shoots were somewhat raw but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I also enjoyed the Chicken Ji Song and liked the presentation of it, especially with the fried sweet potato on top.  We tried a bunch of different tacos, and I think flavorwise, I liked the beef tendon and it was melt in your mouth tender, but also the greasiest taco out of all of them.  We didn't end up order any dim sum because I knew I could probably eat tastier (and cheaper) dim sum in Chinatown.

We ordered the flan and the happy buddha giggling taking a bath.  The flan is deliciously creamy and easily one of the best flans I've ever had.  The happy buddha is really cute and he really is taking a bath!  It's one of the most entertaining desserts I've ever had.  It isn't your normal jello.  They make it from scratch with fresh strawberries and use seaweed extract instead of gelatin, and it has a very smooth flavor.  It's very refreshing at the end of a huge meal.

The dishes aren't that expensive but they do add up very quickly, and we ended up spending more than I wanted to, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention yummy!",Y6GosB-E8CNVgurIpmFYQw,1,1,5,xJcJdYXxduSxBJw8TCtt_Q

Came here to eat cause we didn't want to venture too far from the room, and we were a bit hungover.  It was pretty late in the afternoon so there was no line and we got seated right away.  

Got the swallow the cloud soup, cause we really wanted some soup.  The noodles were well made and prepared, but the broth was just average.  Got the monks chili on the side ($2.88) and that helped a lot, but come on now, $3 for a side of chili???  It's usually free and left in jars at the table in most asian restaurants. The whole plate wasn't ""destroy the noodles and slurp every last drop of soup"" satisfying. There are some places on the strip that make much better noodles.

Also got the Sui Mai Luck 6 platter.  Decent Sui Mai, but again, you need the chii to boost it up in flavor.

$6 for ONE small taco!

Go ahead...I'll wait. 

....he brought about a table spoon of soy sauce (no joke); n charged us $3!!!!! WTF- GTFO for those of you who know what that stands for.  

I had to double check again that this was a Chinese Resturaunt; and I don't know where  y'all are from; but even in the getto soy sauce is FREE! Ok? It's f***ing free...



Anyways, again I asked for a chilly sauce; charged again

I called in and spoke to the manager, he confirmed it. I was in fact charged an extra $6 for the heck of it; but it would take 72 hours for that to go back to my account! WTF again!!!

There was no one in the restaurant when we arrived and I should have took that as a sign of trouble, alas my spidey senses were not tingling...and later on nor were my taste buds.

Arrived with a group of four (3 being from China). I figured this would be a fun place to experience being a mexican/chinese fusion restaurant.

It began with the ordering of hot water that arrived in an iron tea pot, visually pleasing but left a terrible metallic aftertaste. The dishes we ordered were indeed tiny and expensive as other reviews state. My company had two orders of different soups and the fresh handmade noodles but had to quickly report to our waiter that all three dishes were incredibly salty, we're talking ""preserve your tongue for the winter"" salty. Our waitress advised us that a lot of asian customers have this problem, ""Americans just expect lots of salt or they complain that there is not enough flavour"". I found this a little hard to believe being that all other restaurants we tried in Vegas were well under the ""tongue preservation"" level of salt. 

They offered to redo the soups but we had enough of the trouble and decided to cut our loses and shared the noodles and a fish taco (a very rubbery fish taco but with nice hints of flavour). 

It was then that the hostess provided the bill which included the two dishes that we did not even eat, after reminding her of this they quickly changed the bill but the fact that they tried to charge for everything showed no care at all for customer experience.",nSFHdQ4geNFThpM-rFxtbQ,0,0,1,1eRUP7ew8TFFNJRX_Rf6ug

As for the food - I only had a couple of tacos, but they were *fantastic*! I plan on returning to eat my weight in Tacos Napoles y Queso. Seriously. These little unassuming tacos are some of the best things that I've eaten on the Strip. Somehow, they've managed to capture the essence of campfire smoke and infuse it into the cheese - making this an amazing and delicious treat for those who love smokey flavors (like me). 

The only downer? Price.
Granted; it is not ridiculous for The Strip, and from what I can tell, the food quality is very high. But living as we do in what must be the Inexpensive Mexican Food capital of the U.S., I still have trouble paying over $20 (with tip) for two tacos and a small coke - no matter how fancy. 

So, I'll start saving now for my upcoming taco bender - but this will have to be a rare treat, rather than a regular thing.

To put it very plainly, China Poblano is a tapas bar and restaurant that specializes in both Chinese and Mexican finger food.

The thing is everything here is a bit pricey.

That being said, I elected to just get some chips, guac, and salsa.  I'm normally pretty picky with my guacamole, but I must say that it was probably the best green stuff I've ever had that I didn't make myself.  That says a lot.  The chips were fresh and the salsa added a nice spicy kick.

We orders some ceviche, tacos, dan dan mien, and chilaquiles. My overall favorite was their ceviche. Decent flavor with a good amount of tuna. Nothing spectacular though. Different cuisines are prepared in different kitchens so food comes out at off times. Their noodles were okay. A good kick of spice but obviously not traditional. The chilaquiles was a joke.

1338449,2016-05-19,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I have Celiacs and I originally found this restaurant on a list of ""gluten sensitive"" restaurants in Las Vegas. However, the ""gluten sensitive"" menu offers very few Chinese choices - I'd say the menu is roughly 98% Mexican and 2% Chinese -- which was personally upsetting since I was really looking forward to gluten free Chinese food. Chinese food is typically hard to make gluten free - as soy sauce contains gluten but gluten free soy sauces do exist!! There was one noodle option on the menu ""Kao Lao Lao"", oat noodles with tiger sauce, next to this option was a little asterisk that just said ""contains soy sauce"". I asked the waitress if the soy sauce was gluten free and she said ""No"", and kind of chuckled and told me ""I wouldn't recommend that dish without the sauce though because it will just be plain boiled noodles."" Ok. WHY WOULD THEY EVEN PUT IT ON THE MENU?! So the only options left for me were tacos. So much for my Chinese food craving. Whatever. Heck - even PF Changs does Gluten Free Asian food. 

Additionally -- we weren't totally sure but the waitress never disclosed to us that food would be served tapas style and arrive at various times from THREE different kitchens. Had we known in advance of ordering that this was the case, we probably would have ordered differently. As everyone's dishes arrived separately, within 5 to 10 minutes of each other. Even all the tacos came out at different times. Food was just ok. My friend had the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice - which was apparently featured on Food Network - everyone at the table (aside from me - as it wasn't gluten free) agreed it wasn't special and tasted like standard take out Chinese food -- kind of basic. She had also added chicken to the rice for an additional $5; however, we were only able to find several chunks of chicken amidst the veggies. Not worth it.

All in all food was good - not great. Servers were nice - not welcoming. I don't think I would go back, there are better places in Vegas.",d6QmDxRSZmWX-q_p-GUUAg,0,0,2,fwpPfYPFVH5_myFmhDC3Ug

First warning sign was that 20 Vegetable Fried Rice. It's $20 and doesn't even have a protein, that's $5 extra. Twenty bucks for rice, vegetables and egg fried up?! Come on now that's just insulting.

Next, the baked pork buns were without a doubt the worst pork bao I've ever had. Try Noodles next door at the Belagio and you'll find the pork buns you're looking for. We couldn't even finish them. The insides were tasteless and the outside was a chewy mess. Oh, and they don't have spicy mustard for them and want to charge an extra $2 for some chili oil, explaining that it's made in house. We're talking about pretty standard condiments here.

We also got some tacos, the best thing I could say about them is that they were mediocre, and so was the service. We had to send 3 people back to finally get some soy sauce and never saw our waiter again after taking our order.",2LQBqqZstQAfk4UXtutQxQ,0,0,2,2xkxVvn4cL_d5Ro-QK_0jQ

Top Ramen tastes better than the soup I ordered, Swallow a Cloud ( Hong Kong wonton/shrimp/pork/bok choy ).  The wontons were the only things I ate.  The noodles were undercooked and did not absorb any flavor from the broth.  It is not worth $17.
The Traditional Sui Mai was delicious.  The price was $13 but it's probably because they were sprinkled edible gold flakes.  I'm sure I wouldn't have tasted any difference.

My friend had a couple of the tacos and said they were pretty good.  Unfortunately, I can't remember which ones.  I think one had carnitas or pork belly (a special).

Luckily, 5 minutes after chatting, 2 people got up so that we could sit. (Bonus points for the purse hooks under the counter!)
(Since China Poblano is located across Marquee, it was crazy to see how long the line was at 8:00PM!!)

I'm only rating on a few items, because that is all we had to try.  We ate a good brunch and some Sam Woo (boo) mid-afternoon..so we ordered only 2 tacos to try.

I ordered the Pancita al Pastor Taco:  slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple $5.50 - I ate it in 2.5 bites! It was okay..NOT ""GOOOD"" like I was hoping.  It didn't really satisfy my tastebuds.  But the way they sliced the pineapple long ways and so thin was interesting.   I did not feel that the taco was worth the $5.50.

My hubby ordered the Viva China Taco:  soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 - done in 2 bites!  He said is was VERY SALTY!

Someone orderd the Papas Fritas with mole poblano / Mexican cream / queso fresco.  Nothing to rave about.  Just fries with the mentioned above ingredients.
The best thing I tasted there was the Salt Air Margarita.  Think Margarita Martini with a Salt foam topping instead of Salt Rim.  Very eye catching too!

A few weeks later, I found out, to my surprise, that my Mom's favorite Chef, Jose Andres owns China Poblano - which made it a little more dissapointing.

The decor of lights, changing LCD picture frames, bicycle wheels was really different and neat.  I don't know that I would come here again - because by the time we go to Vegas again, there will be more and other places to try.

 Viva China Taco, beef tendon and Kumamoto oysters is one item that I found that had some kind of asian and mexican mix. I thought it was ok, the tendons are thinly sliced and fried and raw oysters placed on top. Te texture was not what I expected though, soft on the outside, crispy and crunchy on the inside...next!
 Silencio tacos, made with duck tongue, another chinese delicacy that talked its way into the tortilla,  tasty and sweet because of the fresh lychee that tops the taco but nothing too memorable, something I would only eat once in a lifetime and now is done and over with. 
After the less than stellar appearances of the viva China and silencio tacos I decided to stick with the tried and true. I ordered the carnitas, baby braised pork topped with chicharrones and a green sauce, also I ordered the Baja style fish taco which ended up being the best of the tacos I tried that night but at 6.50 a taco it was expected, those two bites had better be packed with memories. 
This may be a chinese and mexican restaurant, two of the most economic cuisines, but being this another creation by the famous Spanish Chef Jose Andres, be prepared to drop a heavy peseta.
Service was awesome, everyone from the hostes to the servers were very attentive and efficient...definitely not chinese service. The room is nicely decorated, very modern, very colorful and fun, not the typical mexican sombrero on the wall...it is more of an Asian theme. 
 Next time I'm here I'll try some of their Chinese dishes or maybe I'll try some of the other mexican plates or why not, I might just be in the mood for some CHINACAN and order both.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,7,8,3,PFV2KcjCc4tMxB60qPP3UA
1372607,2012-07-23,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Located in The Cosmopolitan - I have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where I could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out. Pork buns + Take out = Win! (not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.) 

Chinese cuisine + Mexican Cuisine = China Poblano. I'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see. 

Order consisted of: 
When Pigs Fly (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88
Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00
Lychee Sour - yummy drink $12.00 

So our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish. The pork buns to me were correctly portioned, I split the order with a friend thankfully because she had ordered a single $10 Lobster Taco and $14 Tuna Ceviche. The waitress really wasn't lying on small portions I give her credit for her honesty. 

The food was overall pretty good. I loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold. My noodle dish was the kind of spicy I enjoy but I had to ""pace"" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (I didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?). The lychee sour, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. It was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how I love lychee.

Overall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor. Perhaps I'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given I could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.",PVs2hLuFD8Eq3pVPzkSxoQ,2,3,3,Ad8aU3I_84C_lmHL0OfAjg

This place is exploding with unique flavors. I tried two things I'd never had in my life here: beef tendon and duck tongue (both in taco form). The tendon was just a bit too greasy for my taste and came with a raw oyster on it. The combination just wasn't my favorite.  The duck tounge taco was surprisingly yummy and served with lychee fruit.

Definitely you MUST have the quail egg and pork shumai. My friend ensured me it would change my life and it did not disappoint as it exploded in my mouth, like a tiny contained eggs bennidict.

I was leaving Vegas at noon, so my friend and I squeezed in a meal here to find out what the hype was about.  Unfortunately it was a brunch menu so we didn't have much to choose from.  Besides the fact that there weren't much to choose from the menu which didn't really bother me that much, the first thing I noticed was... there was no fusion between the Chinese and Mexican food.  (I actually got to take a look at the full menu later but the only thing that was kind of fusion was a taco or two where they used some Chinese ingredients... but didn't sound too appetizing)

So to try both Chinese and Mexican, I got the breakfast taco and a Chinese pork sandwich.  Breakfast taco wasn't that great.  The pork inside the pork sandwich was good... but it's pork fat, of course it's going to be good.  After a few bite of the pork sandwich, the sauce overpowered the taste of the pork so much that I couldn't even finish it.

Usually not at a loss for words, I found myself struggling to think of what to say to let the server know we were not together without sounding insulting or dismissive to the other guest. 

Fortunately, she took care of this by saying with a smile ""Oh, we're not together."" 

Thank you whoever you were!

Okay now onto the review...so I like this place well enough. It has a very diverse and unique menu blending Chinese and Mexican dishes. Service was smart, friendly, and prompt. Based on a few recommendations from my server, I tried three dishes: shrimp and black peppers, a chicken taco, and a beef tongue taco. Each was tasty, nothing spectacular, but good. Beef tongue taco was fine. If you've never had it, it's basically like a nice cut of roast. 

The portions are VERY small. I had three tacos and went to have lunch somewhere afterwards. Think "" very light appetizers"" and you'll get along just fine. 

So based on the mediocre food and very small portions, I'm going with three stars. But the service is superb and I love the atmosphere and location, right in the heart of the Cosmopolitan's busy second level.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,1,0,3,Y5HGwsjb4TF90u8PnHPuXQ

I had dinner here with a party of 8. With the prices they had, I thought I'd be in for some amazing fusion cuisine...

Queso Fundido - $10 literally just melted, buttery cheese. I can't believe we paid 10 bucks for this!
Papas Fritas w/ Mole - $7 Was interesting at first, but then no one wanted to finish it.
Setas (Wild Mushroom Guacamole Tacos) - $4.50/taco I got two. I didn't even want to finish my 2nd one, so I gave it to my boyfriend.
Cochinita (Yucatan-style BBQ Pork Tacos) - $5.50/taco My friends said it was okay. Nothing special.

We request the same waitress, Christine, every time and she is wonderful and will recommend good dishes for the table. The only reason that China Poblano doesn't get 5 stars from me is due to the prices - like everyone else on here says, it's overpriced.

It's all one texture - SOFT - which means you can't even pick it up to eat it.  If the tortilla had been crispy it would have helped the filling stay inside, but as it was a soft corn tortilla, the over-soft beans and sour cream inside just wanted to squeeze out.  I had to just dump it on a plate and eat it with a fork.  Didn't particularly even enjoy it that way so took two bites and let my friend finish the rest.  The one really delicious thing is the mango sticky rice dessert.  It's not a traditional sticky rice but it's really good.  Overall, the only reason I keep going back is that my friend works for this restaurant group and he gets a discount.

1466433,2011-09-08,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"This is definitely a go to spot when I'm in Vegas and if you're in town you should give it a try but that being said I would lean more toward the Mexican side of the menu (not because I'm half Mexican either) and less on the Chinese side. So for the record I love Chinese food...I do live in Alhambra...one of LA County's Asian food Meccas.

I was hearing about how bomb China Poblano's tacos were and I was like ""ahhh tacos are tacos""... right? 

NO...not so much. The first time I ordered we ordered Lobster, Carnitas and Chicken tacos. Each taco has it's flavorful meat lay on a freshly made warm tasty corn tortilla. Also, a bit of fresh in house made salsas that are loaded with flavor and not so heavy on spice and some fresh cilantro are added.  I have to say each and every taco I tasted was fantastic. 

However, the stand out star of the show in my humble little opinion is the Carnitas Taco, it is a very succulent braised baby pork meat... but it is topped off with an in house made small fried pork rind. Can I say that after I had that little added crunch in my taco...I thought to myself ""why in the hell didn't I think of that"". If you've had chips in your sandwich you know what I'm talking about. This extra little crunch make it pop and sets it apart from all other tacos. Ohhh...yum! The freshly made guacamole is so so good, perfectly made and even there chips are very very good and there just chips!

In addition to ordering the tacos the first time we ordered some Chinese food too. I love veggies ...very big on vegetables and among my favorite is eggplant. Naturally I ordered the Dancing Eggplant from menu and the Lemon Pepper Shrimp dish. The shrimp was a little to spicy for me personally but it was fine, nothing to write home about but not bad. 

The only item that went array was the eggplant. I don't understand how anyone could go wrong with eggplant...it is so meaty and absorbs flavor when cooking it like no other veggie. Not only was this the worse eggplant dish I've ever tasted it was the worst tasting food I've ever eaten period! I think it must have been steamed and it was if someone sucked all the flavor and life out of it...nasty. Sorry CP it was bad. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. However, as horrible as that dish was everything else I've had and every time I've eaten there I enjoy it. 

By the way you can dine in or order take out...and eat it in your room. Oh and it is on the pricey side for tapas style food...but hey it's Vegas :) . Enjoy!",p3rz9RbCLcoMxLDLObxGlg,0,0,4,lA-6txLP-YAWbR6igFMDmQ

The highlight was avocado margarita, which was surprisingly tasty, the blended avocado gave it a thicker texture and the tequila used for it made it work. Since there were four of us we tried everything on the restaurant week many. The chilled corn soup tasted like raw corn, the consistency was weird. The potato salad was shredded raw potato, with Asian ingredients, and peanuts, the combination did not work. Second course consisted of a fisk taco and a mushroom taco. The mushroom taco was tasty, mushrooms and seasoning worked. The fish taco was not so good, the fish was partially cooked and it was not sushi grade, I had a very long stringy piece that was not eatable in my fish taco. Once I pointed that out to the server they brought another taco to the table, so that was nice. Third set if items were pork belly noodles with Chinese spices, the pork belly was not crispy, actually very fatty and difficult to chew. Also, a chicken tamale with mole was served, the seasoning was overwhelming, the mole had way too much chocolate in it and was way too much on the plate. Last items were dessert items, a flan made with goat milk, caramel and pineapple, this items was pretty good, the textures worked as well.

I stayed at the Cosmopolitan 4 nights, and on my last night there, sauntered up to the hostess stand around 8:00 and asked to be seated. She asked if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar. I glanced to the left and realized sitting at the bar gave us full view of the ladies making sushi and other Asian dishes, so naturally I wanted to sit there. 

Now, I had a friend with me and we had spent 3 hours in the early afternoon, next door at the Holsteins bar eating apps and drinking way too much. Alas, I was hungry again and he was not, so this review is for my meal and drinks only.

I started with the Margarita flight and was not disappointed! It includes a Salt Air Margarita, Pomegranate Margarita, and Ron Cooper Margarita. They were all delish. Started with the Ron Cooper, as it has mezcal, and being the whiskey/scotch girl that I am, I fond this smoky,  spicy rimmed rita absolutely intoxicating. It was perfect. The other two were perfection, as well. Had I not already drank so much at Holsteins, I would've ordered a full sized Ron Cooper. Mmmm

My friend ordered a single Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich (Asian, red braised pork). It was small, but flavorful and perfect for him, as he was still stuffed from all our food and drinks earlier that day. I went with the $55 Chefs Experience tasting menu. O.M.G...

Every selection was heaven in my mouth. Started with chips and the best guacamole I've ever has in the US! I'm from Texas and have super high expectations for guac and this was excellent! Next, I was served a delicious Carnitas taco. It should've been double wrapped with 2 corns tortillas, instead of one, as it fell apart easily but the flavor was on point. Next came a single, delicious Siu Mai, topped with edible gold leaf. It was my favorite dim sum. Ever! Then came a scrumptious, large bowl of vegetable fried rice, that I had to share. The texture of the perfectly crisp veggies with the expertly cooked rice was exceptional! 

To top it off, I was served 2 desserts that were over the top tasty. First came a churro that I devoured in about 5 seconds! Then, a mango, cream and rice krispie topped selection that was a prefect, light ending to the experience! 

Our bartender/waiter was a tremendous asset and knew the menu and expertly explained what I was being served and provided excellent service,  as did the food runner that brought each selection. It was an AMAZING night and unforgettable meal!",Iq6JklL94vqSu5ZVunNImA,0,0,5,wyrVEtO9Rk2t6uJms18hig

The food wasn't awful.  Inauthentic and disingenuine, yes, but it wasn't the food that even captured my attention.  It's the strange fusion decor really detracts from the mediocre fusion food.  How do you have flashing pictures of Chairman Mao next to the Dalai Lama, who is in fact Tibetan and heavily oppressed by the Chinese government? 

Actually read up on the history of China Poblana: ""This is story of a young girl who was snatched from her home in India by Portuguese pirates and sold into slavery in the Philippines - and of the odyssey that took her half-way around the world, where her dress wound up starting a fashion craze...She's known as La China Poblana, roughly meaning ""The Chinese Woman of Puebla (Mexico)."" She wasn't Chinese, but in old-time Mexico, anyone or anything from Asia was tagged Chinese.""

If you read the top portion of the menu explaining the significance of the restaurant's namesake, claiming that it was an homage to a Chinese girl kidnapped by pirates (possibly raped and assaulted) and forced to spend her life in Mexico and she was known as ""China Poblano.""

Sorry to say, but can't support a restaurant that capitalizes off historical inaccuracies, pictures of a dictator next to an oppressed religious monk, but then again it's Vegas where truth, content, and respect doesn't really matter.

The dan dan noodles were good, nothing to write home about. The chiqules (I butchered another dish name) was amazingly tasty. Um the Pappas were delectable. The 20 vegetable fried rice was also super yummy. And for dessert, the tapioca pudding ball thing was great. 

Me: really 20 vegetables?

-Pollo con mole taco
-Cochinita taco
-Tuna ceviche

Our waitress was very accomodating and helpful. The restaurant also allowed us to bring in our own dessert for the occasion. 

I know some reviewers have commented on how expensive they think China Poblano is for the food, but for us it was a great deal.

Not bad at all considering it was a nice, fun meal with delicious food that lasted over 2 hours.

1601735,2011-10-02,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We were scoping out the spiffy new Cosmopolitan Hotel when we passed by this very interesting looking restaurant. There were two ""to-go counters"" on either side of the entrance--one said ""OPEN: Chinese Food,"" the other ""OPEN: Mexican Food."" Intrigued, we decided to see if we could get in for dinner on the spot and got lucky scoring the table of a no-show reserved party. Vegas can be a gamble, but sometimes you do win!

As its name (and exterior!) would suggest, China (pronounced chee-na) Poblano is an experiment in mixing Asian and Latin cuisine. From dim sum to tacos to noodles with huitlacoche (corn smut, apparently), this is where Chinatown meets the Mission. Yes, I'm sort of from San Francisco.

I give this place 5 stars for the decor (and service, which was also very good). The outside that's set up to look like a city street with cheap Mexican and Chinese eateries side by side is a front for a very swanky restaurant on the inside. Bicycle wheels hanging from the ceiling, random Asian and Native American-looking knickknacks stacked upon the walls in artsy fartsy fashion, splashes of colorful paint... I was in interior design heaven. Great job on that.

On the other hand, for the food and its value, I can only give three stars. It was delicious, but ridiculously overpriced. $12.88 for four pieces of har gao? Teeny tiny pieces too, like a third the size of the shrimp dumplings you can get at any authentic Chinese restaurant. $15.88 for won ton noodle soup?? $15 for guacamole?!?! I get it that this is a trendy fusion restaurant and that the chef is famous, but come on now. Ethnic street food in a fancy hotel in Las Vegas is still ethnic street food, which means it should be cheap. Essentially, you are paying to dine in this very nicely and expensively decorated business venture.

All things considered, it was a satisfying meal and I'm glad I got to try this place. Our party of six ordered about half the menu and doubled up on some dishes as well. Clearly I was not buying dinner that evening... I'll save whatever money I bring back from Vegas for my neighborhood taqueria, thank you.",emF8KqAfI2VL6Sfaek9gFg,2,1,3,osasZcyx-p4O-psgHpe94Q

We had a reservation for New Years, the place was swamped. There was six of us and we each had different dishes. 


We ordered guacamole, and chips and salsa to start off. The salsa was really good and gave us time to check out the menu. 

We had ordered drinks which took around 15-20 minutes to arrive. They were simple drinks; beer, vodka soda, gin soda, etcetera. 

The server said he'd explain the menu eventually but never really got around to it. 

I ordered chilaquiles and added chicken to them (which is very common in the original dish), the chicken came separate and seemed to have been dipped in oil. I still threw it on the hot pan that contained the chilaquiles and mixed them together (which should've been done in the kitchen, I think), and proceeded to eat. They were okay, nothing remarkable. 

At the end, we got the check all together for the group. I guess the rush did let the server have separate tabs(?).  Surprisingly, they had already added the ""gratuity"" in the check and the server forgot to mention it.

1625700,2016-04-28,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a Chinese Mexican hybrid restaurant. The two cuisines are literally worlds apart and I don't associate one with the other. But it kind of made sense when I saw the menu. Instead of combining the two flavors on one plate, the dishes fall into either one of the two food categories. It's still a little odd to see Chinese noodle dishes next to tacos on a menu but at least they're not mixed together in the same dish. 

My boyfriend and I chose to go the Mexican route and each ordered a taco (Hongos for him and a Pollo a la Parilla for me) and the queso fundido to share. We also ordered a side of chips and salsa to use with the queso since the dish is only served with a side of tortillas. The queso is quite stringy and a bit difficult to scoop but tasted great. Of course, how could you go wrong with a bowl of cheese?!? Ordering the chips was a good decision though as it gave more variety to the appetizer than just making quesadillas. My chicken taco had great flavor and, since I asked for the guacamole on the side, I was able to put a little on the taco and use the rest to dip my chips in. My boyfriend had no complaints about his mushroom taco. Were they worth $5? Probably not but this is Vegas and the $5 taco was still one of the cheapest options. 

Our friends went the opposite route and ordered mainly off the Chinese side of the menu. They were far less impressed. First, they started with an appetizer of ceviche. For $15, you would think that it would be served with some kind of chip to scoop the fish but just as we had to order chips for our queso, they had to order chips for the ceviche too. While our table agreed among ourselves that this was odd and not what we've experienced at other restaurants, the waiter insisted that this was normal. I can't remember exactly which other dishes that they tried but I think one was the steamed buns. They weren't feeling the dishes though.",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,8,4,3,JTiYQxK3Z2qe8UzqQXRiIw

It's broken up into Mexican style dishes and Chinese style dishes. Our server said it was similar to a ""tapas"" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. I ordered the Mexican asparagus and the Chinese Dancing Eggplant. The asparagus was amazing and I devoured all of it. Honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. The eggplant wasn't really what I expected. It's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (I forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). The eggplant was not the texture I expected. Was hoping for something I would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. The taste was okay but I couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. We had them bring chips and salsa for the table and both were really good. I ordered the classic margarita and was not disappointed. If I ever make it back I really want to try the margarita flight, as a friend did and said it was amazing. Our server was great, answered all of our questions and made some great recommendations around the table that were raved about. He had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!

My gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, I had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which I was really excited about).

After leaving the restaurant I looked at the receipt again... I realized that they charged $2 for a side of hot sauce. The hot sauce was served in a small dish. They did not give us the bottle.

Being the only 2 casual eateries not counting the hidden pizza place in otherwise expensive restaurant land Cosmopolitan, they are slammed all the time. I passed by everyday staying there and it was like a street mob scene. Regardless, they had hired a bunch of cool cats who handled the situation well which I really liked because feeding hunger after walking around all day is one serious business.

The food was superb. Very very fine for street food. I loved it. Of course it was also because I expected nothing at all* Bah! Jose Andres? Oh no, not another Jose Andres joint, Tacos? Dim Sum? Oh whatever. So thats how I went in. But blow me down, I was dead wrong. They executed very well for what was just mindless street food in an expensive hotel. I shared  their beef tongue taco (excellent, low fat) , har kow (nice twist), viva china taco (didn't like this one, too fried), Cochinita taco (good), lobster taco (not special enough), Roujiamo Sandwich (good enough) and that was about it. I really loved the quality of their meat cuts. 

Pricey? Yes, because tacos, dim sum etc. are not usually, thats the problem. But was it worth it? Yes again.

Atmosphere-- casual. So after all the partying and dressing up for great dinners, this is a welcome change. People are happy all around, not high and drunk like the other casual eateries because they don't serve up cheap fruit punch cocktails here.

Service was great but what's going on with the food, the pricing, and the portions. 

The food started off great! Chips included with the chips and salsa were delicious and fresh. The chipotle salsa not so much. 

Thee 18 Monk Noodles was fine. Noodles were very good but the soy sauce was way overpowering. 

Mongolian beef wasn't great either. Actually it was terrible besides the fact that the Beef was cooked perfectly and served over romaine lettuce. The sauce was overpowering and not pleasant at all. 

The tacos are expensive, bland, and contain little fillings  

Tinga Poblana, Carnitas tacos are very bland. The only thing you could taste is the corn tortilla. 

We also had the spicy pork noodles. The sauce was not good at all and made me not want to continue eating.

Both were delicious but way out of our price range - the pepper was $16! We didn't know it was going to be such small portions.

1741311,2012-09-24,18,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***

China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  

I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.

The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.

I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.

Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.

For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.

Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.

Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.

In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.

I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.

1775550,2014-01-29,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. Given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in Vegas, I would skip it. If you are a Jose Andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the Dan Dan Mian. 

First of all, the outside seating is not fun. You're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. This makes me sound like such a pansy. Not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. Also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. Not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here. 

Anyway, I went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. We got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. Here's what we got and what I thought.   

Tacos: Tinga Poblano - I mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. Not anything special at all. Also, teeny tiny. Very little chorizo. I know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. You end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. PASS. 

Dim Sum: When Pigs Fly - Ugh. I didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if I'm being honest, this is another pass. This tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! For $14! We love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. But like, it was totally standard and not special at all. PASS.  

Noodles: Dan Dan Mian - This was pretty good. I'm a fan and if I came back I would get this again. It had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. I need to note that even though this is the one thing I will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. But I'd do it again. PLAY. 

From China: Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice - I am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. The waiter says Travel Channel liked it? Yes, ok, yes please. And then out comes this extra small portion of fried rice that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. PASS.

From Mexico: Papas Fritas - I really didn't like this at all but to be fair I'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. Also I never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. You can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. And sometimes I forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and I try it again and it's like UGH FLEECED AGAIN. But that's neither here nor there. PASS.

In hindsight, this really makes it sound like I hated it. Which I totally didn't, I was just very underwhelmed. As I'm originally from the DC area, I've tried several of Jose Andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. So maybe I've set the bar high because I've had such good things from his places before, or maybe I'm just extra judgey because I grew up eating both these cuisines so I've had much better at cheaper prices before? Dunno. Either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. Again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. I think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.",YsrEpsQmtDCwNDUQvg2i6Q,3,0,2,RQfnbYRwj2-rfhERXpWyrw

Man, she couldn't have been more right.  Everywhere I looked it was style over substance, women trolling for a golden ticket, men trying way too hard to look pensive in staged photographs, popped collars for miles....and absolutely no sign of that furball that creates the one-thing entourage of my daughter's deadbeat boyfriend.  Let's face it, that beast has no sense of style.  Chewie's idea of suiting up is picking the birds that got trapped in his fur out of his natty ass backhair.

Fortunately for me, black is always in, so I had no trouble getting into China Poblano - which, on its surface, presents the awesome combination of Mexican and Chinese food all in one place.  Why has nobody in the entire galaxy thought of this before?

I will say this:  What we got was absolutely delicious.  I will also say this:  There really, REALLY should have been more of it.  Look, I get that part of being one of the ""beautiful people"" is only pretending to eat your food, so I'm sure for the regulars of that hotel, the 2 bite meals are more than sufficient.  Let's face it, though:  Nobody would ever claim that I needed to eat a damn sammich.  And if I'm going to pay 20 dollars for a damn 20 vegetable fried rice, it should be substantial enough to where I have more than 1 little bit of each kind of vegetable.  12 dollars for an object I could eat in one bite?  Jesus Christ, even the WATER was small.  No, seriously, tiny glasses, and they never even completely filled them on refills.  What the hell is it with this kind of philosophy?  Made me want to go out and Force Choke a kitten....or at least the beloved Marie Osmond.  But my quarrel was with this restaurant, not the Flamingo Hilton.

Sorry, but you're claiming a combination of Mexican and Chinese cuisine, both of which historically consist of larger portion sizes.  So why try to integrate tapas style sizes with steakhouse-like prices?

Maybe the owner should focus more on balancing the value of his cuisine instead of kowtowing to perpetually pouty-lipped 20-something gold miners looking for someone with enough mastery of The Force to use Jedi Mind tricks on the Jimmy Choo salespeople for free shoes.  My recommendation?  The recipe for the SUPERB 20 veg fried rice is readily available online...I almost never say this, but make it on your own spaceship and save yourself the expense.

1794937,2015-11-11,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"This has become one of my favorite spots in Vegas! Mostly because Mexican & Asian food are my top 2 favorite cuisines. When you walk into China Poblano, to the right is an open kitchen and you can see their staff making food for their Mexican dishes such as fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole. To the left is another open kitchen, where they are making some of the Asian foods such as dumplings, dim sum, etc. You can either sit at the counter which looks into the open kitchens or in the dining area, which has plenty of small tables, as well as large tables for big groups. The restaurant is very colorful. Mostly red color and has a lot of interesting decor, big portraits, and fun lighting. 

99% of the reason I come here is for their Asian food! They have great selections of siu mai which were all very flavorful and tasted authentic. However the 2 dishes I ALWAYS get when I come are the Golden Pigs and Dan Dan Mian. The Golden Pigs are great if you like chinese bao buns. These are like bao buns that are taken to the next level! The buns are filled with chinese bbq pork, and then fried. It is served with a side of condensed milk for dipping. To sum it up, you are pretty much eating a bbq pork donut. Yes it sounds strange, but I've forced all of my friends to try this dish and they all go crazy over it! It is the perfect combination of sweet and salty and fatty and fried. Great hangover food. And their Dan Dan Mian is the best Asian noodle dish I've ever had. The noodles are hand-cut wheat noodles, with spicy pork sauce and peanuts. So addicting! It is pretty much like a spicy, Chinese version of bolognese. And the spicy pork sauce has a szechuan kick to it, so you'll definitely get a hint of smokiness to that dish. I love it!

However the only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was disappointed with their tacos. People that love Mexican food will usually order tacos off of this menu since they have a good variety of tacos to choose from. However for $5-$6 PER TACO, I don't think they are worth the price at all. I ordered the Tinga Poblana taco and didn't taste any chipotle flavor. And the chicken had a weird texture. It was almost too mushy, like tofu. At one point I wondered if I was even eating chicken. It didn't taste at all like I was expecting it to. I also got their Refried Bean taco and there was barely any chipotle salsa on it. The tacos also weren't that good which was a let down, since they are made fresh in the restaurant. I've definitely had better tacos at other places. However their fresh guacamole is spot on! I will definitely get guacamole when I feel like eating Mexican food here.

I'll definitely be back, but mostly for the Asian dishes. The Mexican dishes can use some improvement in my opinion.",XABhvb_428o3kTg254P_pQ,1,0,4,zlfW0cdTlKBjkf3ok82wwQ

Unfortunately, China Poblano fell short of expectations. The Al Pastor taco had very little pork belly and was overwhelmed by sauce. The portion sizes were small across the board. The guacamole was pretty good, but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up guac.

1811533,2012-09-11,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"If not for the out-of-this-world carnitas tacos (yay for pork rinds!) I think I would have given this place only 2 stars.  It advertises itself as ""chinese/mexican fusion"", but the menu is really just split up into various mexican dishes and chinese dishes (mostly of the dim sum variety). As an overall note, I think that the Mexican dishes were much tastier than the chinese items, so if you are wrestling b/w the two, I would go with Mexican. Here's what we tried:

TACOS
Carnitas - yum yum yum.  Definitely order this if you order nothing else.  And get two, so that you won't have to share. A+

Viva china - this is a kumamoto oyster/beef tendon/sichuan peppercorn sauce taco.  The combo of the tendon and oyster was underwhelming, and if you really love that peppercorn taste, you're not going to find much of it here. C-

Barbacoa - we ordered this because it came with ""cactus paddle"".  Still have no idea what cactus paddle is, but it's an awesome name!  The beef was alright, though a bit salty, and the cactus unfortunately didn't really taste like anything at all. C-

fried fish taco - the fish was fried nicely, and I liked the pickled onions that came with it, but it was close to 7 bucks for two tiny tacos and pinky sized pieces of fish, so probably wouldn't order it again.  B-

CHINESE

Fire Phoenix - This was pretty much a variation of popcorn chicken, with pork rinds on the side.The sichuan peppercorn salt was really good, and fried chicken never tastes bad when it's fres, but there really wasn't anything that special about this dish.  C

MEXICAN

Tuna ceviche - Comes on a bed of ice and looks delectable.  Tastes pretty a-ok too. I think they put soy sauce in here, which gives it a nice depth of flavor.  A-

Coctel de camarones - This was pretty much like a cold cocktail of shrimp, crab, and avocado, mixed with what is essentially a cocktail sauce.  I love lump crab meat and I love shrimp, but I didn't come here to eat those things with cocktail sauce.  I can get that for 3.99 anywhere else.  C

Shrimp mojo - This actually did taste like a fusion dish, though it was a bit heavily sauced.  The shrimp are nice and garlic-y, with a hint of spice from the poblano peppers.  Good, but could have used a side of rice or something.  B-

In a nutshell:  I'd recommend just stopping in and sitting at the counter and ordering some tacos (especially the carnitas ones), and then going somewhere else for dinner.  As a disclaimer, we didn't order the famous ""twenty ingredient fried rice"" that was featured on food network, but I'm taiwanese, and I just don't feel right paying 20 bucks for fried rice.",7VhXchEryix_jrWv3ziRZg,1,0,3,Wpb6CYfKM8xVgiIA20cMrQ

Hostess said ""I don't know, go take alook."" Really? I work in this business, I would never! I understand it was restaurant week and they were busy, but after 11 days you would think they'd get it. Now for service....never saw our waitress till aftet we recieved food. Then it was to drop off our drinks, yes I said drop off our drinks. Manager took our order after sitting for almost 15 minutes. I'm sure she heard us bitching. First coarse was just ok. Then some server dropped off a dish and didn't even look at us and left. It wasn't ours but no one came by so we ate it.....not good.....what do you want for free. By the way it was the 3rd time someone tried to give us food we didn't order. But that one topped it. Just mumbled, dropped it, and left before we could tell him it wasn't ours. It sat there and no one even came by so we tried it. Then came the 3rd coarse. No 2nd coarse. We had to ask the food runner for it. Oh did I happen to say we still haven't deen our waitress. Now she shows so we can order our dessert, nice enough but game over. The oddest thing is her name on her name tag wasn't Beatrice which was on the check. Will not be back....oh did I say I'm in the business and live in Vegas.

1822430,2011-06-20,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"First, let me tell you what this place is NOT.  It's not cheap, although not terribly pricey by Vegas standards. If you want a cheap fast meal, I would recommend grabbing a couple slices at the Pizzaria upstairs.  It's not really Fusion, since most of the dishes are clearly either Mexican or Chinese, with only a couple that successfully fuse the two.  It's also not a fine dining experience you would expect at some of Jose Andres' other restaurants. 

However, we did enjoy excellent service and very tasty and often creative food. The server was very knowledgable about the menu and seemed enthusiastic about the food. Service was very attentive and the manager even stopped by to make sure everything was good. 

They have two nice open kitchens where you can see homemade dim sum made next to handmade tortillas. We mostly tried the Chinese dishes, since we have plenty of good Mexican in LA. The lamb potstickers are juicy, delicious, and beautifully presented.  The 20 vegetable fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever had. We also tried the chilaquilles, which were delicious and filling. The tacos seemed pricey at $5 a piece, but we didn't try any. The mango sticky rice was very light and refreshing, but don't expect any actual sticky rice.  Try the ""tea for two"" for an interesting cocktail.

Chips and salsa: I appreciate the warm chips. The salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. Maybe it needs cilantro or onion.

Tacos: We ordered 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). Nothing special in the way of flavor. Every taco had a chunk of fat in it. And at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up. 

Lamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. They were light on flavor. We asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. The sauce added sssooo much. If it weren't for the sauce I would have had a hard time eating it.

Gazpacho something: a fruit salad. This was very good, but again a very small portion.

Tuna ceviche: I didn't eat this because I don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.

Shrimp mojo: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily.

I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, but seeing as it is surrounded by amazing restaurants it got pushed to the bottom of my list for a while. After exhausting the other options in the Cosmo, it was China Poblano's time to shine. Unfortunately it did not. 

Everything was either over seasoned to the point where it assaulted my tastebuds and I couldn't taste much else other than salt or it was bland. 

The Golden Pigs dim sum are fried and filled with BBQ pork, served with a side of sweetened condensed milk. Sounds okay at a glance, especially since it was recommended, but after tasting it, all you could taste was SWEET. It tasted like a fried dessert dipped in icing, and the pork was completely masked by everything else. Disappointing. The Tuna Ceviche was so salty it was like eating ocean water, which is not something I really want from ANY meal. The same goes for the Queso Fundido. Really unfortunate. The only thing I enjoyed were the corn tortillas served with the Queso. The were fluffy and delicious. Other than that... not much else impressed me. 

If it wasn't surrounded by a plethora of amazing options, I might say give it a chance... but that isn't the case. Don't bother with this one.",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,5,2,2,zp1i1ACVklY6lMnyw1sahg

Having grown up eating a lot of Chinese and Mexican food, I was excited about this fusion of such different cuisines.  Furthermore, I had high expectations for a restaurant of Chef Jose Andres.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by my experience at this new casual dining restaurant.

First, service was not up to par.  Despite our 7 o'clock reservations, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated.  We were comped guacamole and chips for the long wait, which was a nice gesture.  Servers kept bringing us dishes which were meant for other tables, which became annoying after the third time.  

Second, the food was just okay.  The menu is split up between Mexican cuisine and Chinese cuisine, with a few fushion dishes.  I thought the whole menu would consist of fusion dishes. We ordered a variety of dishes from both sections of the menu -- nothing really stood out as being delicious.  The al pastor taco was good.  The fries with mole was interesting. The hot and sour soup was salty.  The dishes are all very small, tapas style and they bring out everything as it is ready. 

For dessert we ordered the chocolate warrior and giggling buddha.  Both looked interesting but neither tasted good. 

As for decor and ambiance ... the restuarant is casual, the atmosphere is fun.  The decor is kinda tacky looking.  With all of its bright colors and funky decorations, it kind of reminded me of Pink Tacos.

All in all, I love the concept and the history behind the fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. I also feel like the China Poblano has a lot of potential.  However, it definitely has a lot of kinks it needs to work out before it can be a big hit.",kAeqEOGvQyI6quLXv8y1hQ,2,1,3,Rr9TnJdB9tuZg1u_cPi7QQ

I perused the menu online and saw that they do take out which was awesome!!  I placed my order, I decided on the tacos de lengua, cooked in pasillas and a Saison DuPont (beer).  
China Poblano is in the Cosmopolitan, a beautiful hotel and casino that is across from Planet Hollywood.  The restaurant is brightly colored, reds that invoke both asian and mexican influences.  

The take out window is a nice touch and my food was ready!  The smells from the kitchen were enticing but I was surprised to not see the restaurant portion not completely packed.  

The tacos were good, the meat was tender and cooked they my mom used to cook it!  The tortillas were nice I wish they put two, because they put so much meat into the tacos, a second one would've have helped!  I liked them, I wished it had more pasillas but it was good.  Jose Andres' Jaleo is wonderful, all of his tapas have wonderful flavor.  I was hoping the tacos would too, maybe if I went with the pork or lobster ones.

I like China Poblano, next I will make a reservation and order an entree.  The selection of beers are great!  The Saison I had was delish and refreshing.  @JoseAndres you are a great chef and I love ThinkFood Group!",nY1JmIt0JMe8bHBw9nzI2g,0,0,4,hIhZEEUu8gGXw58KFIlzFg

I went here for brunch, as the Cosmopolitan is limited on breakfast options.  The group I went with was also not very familiar with the fusion concept.  When we were looking through the menu, many of them were confused because the menu wasnt clearly communicating what was a ""traditional"" asian item, ""traditional"" mexican item & ""fusion"" item.  They also didn't have a good enough description as to what was in a taco, on a tortilla or what was a soup/ceviche on their brunch menu.  Most of my party had no idea what they ordered until it arrived.

I thought it was too expensive for what you got.  First, chips, guacamole, salsa were all extra costs.  Our salsa literally looked like a splash of salsa in the bowl.  If you're going to charge me for it, it better be a bowl of salsa.  Many of the items were about $5-$10 and you literally got (1) taco with no sides of beans or rice.  You would have to spend about $20 each to get a decent meal.

I got the chilaquiles, which are normally my favorite brunch item.  When they arrived, it was not what I qualify as a good chilaquiles.  The chips barely had any sauce on them, it was too cheesy and chorizo was just plopped down on top of it.

WRONG.  So good!  They recommend that you order 2-3 plates for each person and share.  So, almost like Chinese tapas... with a Mexican flair. Choices are available from dim sum, noodles, tacos, soups, etc.  We ordered some of the more traditional choices, like shu mai and tacos (both chicken and barbacoa), which were very good.  But the best were the off the beaten path items... the rainbow congee (soup with sausage, carrots, and snow peas) was delicious.  It seemed like it had polenta or some similar base, and the flavors complemented each other with the added crunch of the veggies.  By far, the wen rou salad was the best!

Not to mention, I am close to being a 40 year old woman...come on!!!  My husBAND approached them again and politely questioned their policy.

The service from that point on was spot on.  Absolutely no complaints in that department.

I've enjoyed my visits to other Jose Andres restaurants, so stopping here was only a matter of time. I ended up coming in with a friend for their Restaurant Week 2018 menu- 7 dishes across 4 courses, and we added on their queso fundido because cheese is life! The queso was stringy and flavorful, served with fresh, hand-made tortillas that complemented it well- made a good add-on at only $10. 

The first three courses were served as duo dishes with one Chinese and one Mexican option each, starting with coconut ceviche spoons and traditional shu mai. The ceviche marinated young coconut meat in a way that made it texturally resemble fish, and I was quite impressed by the robust flavors. The shu mai, while prettily plated with gold flake, tasted standard to me. Second course was the Ensalada de Chayote and Golden Fried Pork Buns. The salad was gorgeous but lacked flavor despite the unique components (squash ribbons, peanut praline sauce, hibiscus dressing), while the buns were surprisingly impressive with a perfectly crispy, chewy skin filled to bursting with a flavorful barbeque pork, well complemented by house-made condensed milk that I almost didn't even try! Third course was a pollo a la Padilla taco, made with more handmade tortillas and grilled chicken, and smelled and tasted amazing, paired with a massive bowl of 20-vegetable fried rice. The rice was well-made and nicely accented with carrots cut into butterfly shapes, but by then we were so full that the rice largely went unfinished. Leftovers made more than enough for a second meal! Dessert was a churro with Oaxacan chocolate- a small but tasty bite. I enjoyed the chocolate more than the churro, which was more soft than crispy. 

All in all, this was a great meal and a great value- four courses at $30, spanning a good deal of their more recommended dishes. If you miss Restaurant Week, they also have a $45 tasting menu (see photos for courses) that looks like a decent deal too- my experience was so positive, I'd consider coming back for that!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,14,4,C7dFLdO5K5S67x487HMx-A

It says you can do family style, but some of the things on the menu are bowls of noodle soup and things that are hard to share.

High prices, very courteous service but slooow, and heavy sauces on the food.  Kinda reminds me of PF Changs.

This time around we opted out of ordering tacos as I get way better tacos at Tacos El Gordo for half the price. I was craving soup so we ordered posole as a starter as well as chips & salsa, chicken flautas, 20 vegetable fried rice, and dan dan noodles. The posole was salty and the soup thick. I had to ask for more lime to offset the saltiness. The vegetable fried rice is good but not at $19.

I thought i was walking up to a window to order some chow mang noodles but it was just a hole in the wall with no one in there! so i went to the other side and i thought it was a window to order some tongue tacos but no one in there either! then i realized it was just 1 restaurant trying to be smart and combine 2 different kinds of foods!! Chinese and Mexican foods!! i bet its a white man with this stupid idea. I dont want no chung main tacos, carne' asaba boiled beefy bowls, carnitoe char su bows! that sounds icky wicky ticky my pinky pretty please with a pinky toe on top!! when we got inside they had old brown azn and latin people being projected on the walls! So what, we are just art pieces now? I looked around and seen all these white people looking at the projections and saying stuff like ""hey bro look at mr. miyagi over there!"" damn that sucks man, mr miyago is dead BRO. let him rest in piece in karate heaven. If he was here he would do a damn flash kick on you and your damn mama and papa and while you in the air he would jump up and stick chop sticks in ur boom boom holes and remove them swiftly and make you smell each others sticks!! so you would smell your mamas and papas bunghole sauce!!

Im trying to do good stuff!! after i got so mad sitting there. I ordered a bean taco and meditated while i waited for my 1 bean taco. i sat and cleared my mind and i transported to this crazy place that ive never been to before!! i usually transport when i meditate but i usually go to my grandmas tranquil garden and eat a orange on the grass with her while we both float in the air sitting in lotus position. This time i transported to a weird house with a old Voltzwagon van in the driveway, i was scared but curious, i very quietly said ""hey boys, anybody home tonight?"" and i hear a old voice say ""hi!"" and slowly comes out MR MIYAGI !! im not lying to you! i dont lie, trust me! PAT MORITA come out and he tells me to calm down!! and then he tells me to start waxing his van!!! i couldnt believe it!!! i told him i dont wanna wax your damn van, that thing is old and dirty as hell!! then he gets all mad and says its part of your meditation training and i was like i dont need training i just meditated and transported into a fictional movie of the 1980s!!! he then said ""you passed the test!!"" he said only a imbecile would have started to wax that old stinky van! it was then quiet for a minute, it was completely silent, so silent that you could hear a cricket toot a poof! he took a deep deep breath and his chest filled with magic air, he then said to me ""HERE IS YOUR BEAN TACO!"" i was like what?? then i felt a slap on my shoulder and i awoke to a lady giving me my bean taco. I ate the taco and realized that it was just beans from a dang can! i paid $4 plus tax for a scoop of beans! i could have bought 4 cans of beans instead!! Even with the bad restaurant experience, i couldn't believe i had a meditative expedience like i just had. I paid, left some lucky belly button lint as a tip and walked out. as i was walking out, i noticed one of the projections was actually Mr Miyagi, i swear, the projection then moved, looked at me in the eyes, and WINKED. I then looked at the Bro who made that insensitive remark and i winked at him. he blew a kiss at me. then i was kinda caught off guard so i just waved my right hand at him like foorest gump does when hes waving at lieutenant dan on the shrimp boat. he came over and we talked about life, i got bored talking to him so i just kept saying uh huh yup thats cool man. and he kept wanting to hang out, but i was like im tired i gotta go. he was bummed but its alright he will find someone else that matches his personality. im too advanced for him. i mean i just transported into karate kid thats so crazy.

Expect to be paying about $5.50-$10 for ONE TACO.

I mean don't get me wrong, the tacos are pretty good, but DAMMM its expensive for such a small portion. They don't even use special taco shells, its just regular tortilla tacos.

Viva China Taco
(beef tendon/kumamoto oysters) $5.50

This taco was really unique. The beef tendon was dried and had the texture of really thin beef jerky. It was glazed in an asian flavor sauce. Served with ONE semi-raw oyster and seaweed. It was different but good.

Carnitas Taco $5.50
(braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda)

This taco was basically filled with pulled pork. Topped with a spicy salsa that resembled spicy guacamole with chopped onions. Then two small pieces of pork rinds. It was good as well.

18 Monk Noodle $14.88
(hand cut wheat noodles, shiitake, crispy sweet potato, soy sauce)

Honestly, these noodles were kind of disgusting. First of all, it was a really tiny portion served in a large bowl. The noodles were completely over-sauced and drenched in soy sauce which made it salty. It was definitely not worth the price tag and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!

I was in Las Vegas for work recently. Vegas is not my favorite place. I'm not into seeing woman being pathetically objectified, losing money, or big flashing lights while I'm trying to catch my zzzzs.

That being said, the food in this town is outstanding! China Poblano was recommended to me by someone I met at a bar while in town. I had a friend accompany me on this dining adventure. And an adventure it was!

The restaurant is located in one of the fancier malls. Not the most elegant place, but colorful and cheery instead. The food is, as the waitress explained, ""both Chinese and Mexican, not fusion."" Okay, interesting!

We started with drinks... the Salt Air Margharita. Hands down, this is the best cocktail I've ever had. It was foamy and lovely and lightly salted and oh my! may I have another?  Apparently, they have a to-go window. You can walk right up and grab one of these spectular drinks as you puruse the fancy shops. 


Mexican cuisine was served first then the Chinese. Dish after dish. Different aromas, tastes. It was a trip around the world in my mouth. Heavenly!

For all it's hype (and man, was this place hyped as part of the newly-opened Cosmopolitan), China Poblano fails to deliver the amazing meal that could have been from the combination of Chinese food and Mexican food on one menu.  It has interesting choices, but the dishes just don't rise to the quality of the better Mexican and Chinese restaurants in Vegas and China Poblano is double the price.    

First, the Mexican dishes.  We ordered several tacos.  The mole chicken was bland.  Seriously, the mole sauce was bland.  A chocolate-based sauce was bland.  The other tacos we ordered combined braised pork with a fried pork rind.  It felt gimmicky. The pork rind just took away from the impressively tender and tasty braised pork.  Remove the pork rind and that's a pretty tasty taco.  The pork itself was delicious, but not enough to bring me back when I'm craving Mexican food when Vegas has so many tasty taquerias.

As for the Chinese offerings, we ordered the Vegetable Noodles and the bbq pork dumplings (When Pigs Fly).  The noodles were good and the sauce was delicious, but again, it just didn't rise to the level of amazing that I expected.  On a positive note, the dumplings in When Pigs Fly were tender, the bbq sauce was sweet and tangy and I recommend them if you head over to China Poblano.

We also splurged and tried the dish ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" which local reviewers have been raving about.  It's a tapas-sized portion of fried quail with dragon fruit in dragon fruit sauce, which is beautifully arranged (as were most dishes -- one thing this place knows is artful presentation).  But after having the dish, I don't quite understand the rave reviews.  Dragon fruit is essentially tasteless, but juicy and offers very little to the dish other than its undeniably cool name.  The waitress told us that the chefs add citrus into the dragon fruit sauce to add some flavor, but when we had it, the flavors could be described as subtle at best, and absent at worst.  The quail itself was pretty damn tasty if you don't mind crunching through a bone or two in your fried nuggets.  At $8, I'd say it's worth ordering.  At $15, stay away. 

The best parts of our meal were the fresh guacamole, pomegranate margarita and the entire desert menu.  The guacamole was exceptional and included a wonderful mix of Oaxaca cheese.  The pomegranate margarita is a little piece of food art with a sweet, sharp taste and topped with an inventive salt foam.  And this place is known for its deserts.  We had the flan and it gets a big thumbs up.

Bottom line: 3 stars with some dishes rising to the level of ""good to great,"" but most sitting around ""not bad:.  Add in the high prices for tapas portions and it's a solid 3.

They accommodated us quickly, although it was at the outside tables but that's fine by me...more people to watch. 
Our server was great, I have no complaints about the service. 
My husband & I ordered chips & salsa which were great, good seasoned chips, salsa was smokey and far from any pico de gallo. We also ordered 4 tacos...2 fish, 1 cochinita (BBQ Pork) and 1 carnitas. We've had the fish tacos before and they were delish...this time they were totally different. The fish wasn't very battered, and the salsa was way different. Definitely not as good this time around but still very decent. The other tacos were full of flavor but very small! We both said we could eat 4 more! So after the chips & salsa & 2 tacos each we were still hungry so we ordered dim sum. A 4 piece order of When Pigs Fly and they were a knock out. Very good. 
Now, a part of me wants to take a star off because of the high prices. This dinner was over $70 and I really couldn't justify paying more than $35-$40. You can't call this a full dinner. It was more like a lite bite before a concert type thing. 
The kicker was the 2 cokes my husband ordered during dinner. They came in glass bottles and are imported from Mexico. I've seen them at my local grocery store...they sell them 10 for $10. For all of you yelpers that are not math geniuses, that's $1 ea. China Poblano charges $5.88 each!! Holy coca cola! $12 on two cokes?! That's a little unreal.

To be exact on my rating, it is a 1.5 stars. I reward 1 star for the decor (and because we have to) and another .5 stars for effort, and then rounded up to get a measly 2 stars.

Our order was the Phoenix Chicken or something like that, Guacamole, and the 20 vegetable fried rice. All dishes were not up to par in terms of taste. The chicken and the fried rice were recommendations from our server.

The fried rice was bland and it was maybe the equivalent of 3 bowls of rice at a chinese restaurant. This is not a lot of fried rice for about 20 dollars. 

The chicken was actually a cornish hen I believe. It tasted okay, but I would have preferred a chicken from el pollo loco, to be honest. That dish was also in the neighborhood of 20 dollars or more, and if you know how small cornish hens are, you might agree that 20 something dollars for that amount of hen is stupid. 

The guacamole was a whopping 15 dollars. This was honestly the only thing we ordered that I enjoyed, but it wasn't worth 15 dollars.

The service was pretty good until our server asked if the fried rice she recommended was good, and I replied, ""It's okay."" She then asked, just okay? And I confirmed, "" Just okay.""

When we paid, it was another silent transaction void of any actual speaking on her part.

Water doesn't come with ice. The decor in the place was interesting, but I would never come here again.

To sum it all up, the portions were small, the price tag was high, especially for substandard -tasting food. We came here because we wanted to give it a shot.

I'd heard good things about this place and decided to make a reservation to meet a friend for dinner. There were 2 hostesses that clearly had very poor communication skills. While waiting to be seated, the one hostess with whom I'd checked in per my reservation completely misdirected another pair that took our table. Mind you they had no reservation. Strike one. After being seated, we placed a drink order. I asked for ginger ale and my friend ordered a martini. What they brought me was ginger BEER (I'm not a drinker). The waitress apologized and made a joke about she herself being a lush. Strike 2. My friend made a joke about how she'd probably just drink the beer herself. I think he was right. When I asked about a particular entree I'd heard about she told me thet no longer served it and it was too bad because it was ""really good!"". Strike 3. I have to ask, why the HELL would a server describe something (which isn't available) as ""really good""? Also, why would she not recommend something else? Complete fail. At the end of the meal, I had to ask for a water refill and our server came over with an order pad and stood for a minute. Apparently she'd heard ""order please?"" instead of ""more water please?"".

As a dim sum snob, I had some pretty high expectations for $13 har gow (shrimp dumpling). It was actually very flavorful, possibly a little too flavorful for har gow. I had the caldo tlalpeño, which is perfect hangover food. It's a nice, savory but light soup with lots of healthy vegetables so you feel real good about eating it. It normally comes spicy with chipotle sauce, but I requested it on the side and ended up not using it because it was savory enough on its own.

For cocktails, we had the Salt Air Margarita and Mexican Mimosa. With the Mexican Mimosa, we ordered the first one with papaya juice (good, but a little boring) and the second one with guava juice (amazing). The Salt Air Margarita was particularly exceptional. Such a great and innovative way to do a margarita - and it definitely tasted far better than your typical margarita.

We started off with the queso fundido. The fresh tortillas were fantastic, but the queso itself was a bit of a let down. While it was good (and we certainly ate all of it), it didn't have a lot of flavor to it. Basically, we were expecting more.

We then shared two sets of two tacos - the barbacoa and Viva China. The barbacoa were incredibly delicious! So many great flavors, and just the right amounts of juiciness and crunch. The Viva China were interesting, but were quite salty. And the two Viva China tacos actually tasted different - one meatier and saltier, and one crispier and less salty. A good and interesting flavor experience, but we probably wouldn't order them again.

For dessert we ordered the flan. It was unlike any flan we have experienced before. It was served with ice cream and these awesome seared-like pineapple squares. All the flavors together (flan, ice cream, and pineapple) were absolutely incredible! And it was all even better when paired with the guava Mexican Mimosa. One of the best desserts we've had in a long time.

It was a little pricey (especially $6 for a bottle of Coke), but everything we had was delicious (so it was worth it). And the service was exceptional. Our server was very attentive and knew the menu well. One of the better service experiences we've had in awhile. And the space and decor is neat.

-Sui Mai scallops dim sum:  Yes, it's a traditional dim sum item you can get in any dim sum restaurant but done very well.

My friend ordered the fried buns with the condensed milk glaze.  I wasn't sure about them but they were actually kind of amazing.  I ordered the chicken poblano taco and the lobster taco.  The poblano taco was really good.  I should've just ordered two or three of those and been done but the lobster taco sounded so enticing.  Um, not so much.  It wasn't great and at $10, it was highway robbery.  All the other reviews are right.  These tacos are all crazy overpriced and they're tiny.

We decided to give this place a try since we are staying at the Cosmo and wanted to find something within the hotel. The front of the restaurant has a very eclectic vibe with many different colors and Chinese/Mexican heritage decor throughout. I love all the loud colors from the exterior, and inviting decor. 

The hostess at the entrance was nice and got us seated right away. Our server Theron, was on point on providing special recommendations. The food is definitely an acquired taste. Don't come in thinking that the food found here is what you'll find in some fast food because it's not anything found in fast food places. The food here definitely has a fusion kick being that the food is definitely in the fancier side, than normal. 

The plates are on the smaller side, so the idea of this restaurant is more tapas and family style. The idea is to order multiple dishes that you can share with amongst everyone on the table. All in all after ordering 5 dishes with 3 alcoholic beverages of bill was just about less than $100. 

Would I recommend it for friends to try? Let's just say I'm not rushing to tell my friends about this foodie experience.

2070248,2018-05-22,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"You should know when you are dining at a ""celebrity"" chef's Las Vegas eatery- you are most likely eating upscale Applebee's. Sure there are some exceptions but by and large the quality is subpar what you would find if you were say eating at a Jose Andres establishment in DC. You want the real thing you have to go to the source, not a cash grab restaurant deal. I'm not mad at the chefs who have done this, I would do the exact same thing if I was in their position.

China Poblano is the Vegas version of Jose Andres' DC China Chilcano. I like the concept. I chuckled when I saw the $45, 8 course tasting menu; I even ordered it on top of a few tacos. To the food. The table side guac was ok but not what I would expect for $16, too much salt, but I think it was to balance the unseasoned/unsalted house made tortilla chips. In the end it works and we finished it off. The salsa was heavy on the poblanos and smoke but we kept going back to it. The Mexican inspired dim sum was great as was the sweat pea salad. The beef tongue & carnitas tacos were solid. It was the 20 vegetable fried rice and mojo shrimp where it went off the rails for me and it became evident it was just upscale TGI Friday's . 

The shrimp were swimming in mojo and a little undersized for what I was expecting. The fired rice was the main course of the tasting menu. There was a lot of it and it too was swimming in oil. I will say I liked the idea of a 20 vegetable fried rice and I plan on making it when I get home, just with less oil.

All in all it was good- everyone dining was happy. But in the back of my mind I couldn't help but think it didn't live up to the quality I expected.  Would I go back? Probably not, I would go to one of the many hidden gems off the strip in China/Korea town. Would I chose it over one of the other celebrity chef's Vegas money grabs?

There are a few foods here (like the signature Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich) whose ingredients I couldn't quite decipher (maybe braised pork belly with char siu???) nor find in another restaurant.  And they have a fried quail/rose petal menu item called ""Like Water for Chocolate""! (I'm a fan of the movie).

However, the overall taste was disappointing.  The pork filling in our street sandwiches was salty (even when eaten with the bread).  ""Swallow A Cloud"" (which was really just a wor wonton noodle soup) was also salty, and I thought that my favorite Chinatown restaurant did a better version (cheaper too).  When served with tea, we were advised to give it a few minutes to brew... I wish I ignored it because by the time I poured it out, it was too bitter.  The lunch was very expensive compared to the experience I got.  I don't mind paying $30/person for lunch, but I think I deserve to be guaranteed at least a satisfying dining experience at that price.

PS: Even though I was a fan of ""Like Water for Chocolate"", I decided not to order the namesake dish after tasting the foods they started serving us.

I was super excited to jump into some amazing culinary experience, but just too exhausted to find it. Starving, we stopped here for what we thought was a quick-service meal and what turned out to be a meal to remember. 

The entire experience was very notably high-end and more than worth the price. The staff are all clearly trained and groomed to uphold a very high standard. I am honestly very confused by the reviews that say otherwise. We were seated and served quite promptly. I swear we had 4 different people ensuring our meal was perfect, keeping our water glasses full and bringing out one dish after the next. I noted that, although the place was crowded, a clear path was made for myself and my mother when we came in, went to the bathroom and left. Very much appreciated due to her handicap. I also saw a waiter check every plate and utensil before putting it on our table. At one point he he noted a spoon that was not satisfactory and went to get another without missing a beat. Quality is clearly a focus here. 

We had the Chef's Tasting - a tour of China and Mexico that includes a few particularly notable bites. I refuse to describe it because it's an adventure you should take on your own. If you are wanting a typical Mexican or Chinese food experience this is NOT for you. If your are wanting a fusion of the two, not that either. The chef is clearly being innovative and attempting to provide a new experience that compares the relationship between these two worlds. 

There were a couple items that were not particularly notable, but nothing was if poor quality or taste. I must say that the shumai was the best dim sum bite I have ever tasted, and I am from San Francisco so it's something I'm quite familiar with. Do not be fooled by the ostentatious gold flakes on top. The flavor is fresh and unique and yet very clearly shumai. I will never forget that one bite. Additionally, I'd like to mention that they use very fresh ingredients and nothing appears processed in any way. Even the tortillas were recognizably hand-made. 

If you don't mind the hustle and bustle and perhaps a few minutes of waiting here and there (good food takes time), I would very much recommend giving this a try!",6AGPOajvqzWi_NCm2PoHyQ,0,1,5,LT9p9cEnxkTPOovASUFNSg

We weren't even really sat down - it was more ""oh are you planning on sitting there?""

Another 10 minutes later he comes out and says he'll take the order and he recommends some dishes that seem okay. 

They come out pretty quickly which is probably the only redeeming quality about this place - applause kitchen staff. The Lucky Dim Sum and wonton soup were pretty good too. But the beef and lettuce dish was too salty. I asked for the server who finally showed up to come switch it out and he comes out with a plate that just has less soy sauce.

When he brings the check over he asks if I want change. And I say yes. In my opinion - that is one of the rudest things a server can ask. Do you think you deserve a tip? And even so, it's not required. He huffed and puffed his whole way back to the cashier and made some racial remarks I'm sure about me and my grandmother being Asian.

My friends and I were in a huge group and we ordered a lot of food. The server was on top of all of it. I was pleased to see they had a lot of vegetarian options. We started with some guacamole and a few appetizers and everything was really good. The portions are pretty small so if you have a big group, you will need to get multiples of things. I got one of each of the vegetarian tacos: cactus and beans. Both were delicious! I liked the cactus one the best, but both were quite good. My friend and I shared the Kao Lao Lao noodle and loved it. It was very interesting and delicious! It looked like a honey comb. My friends who ordered meat options were very pleased were their orders as well.

2132044,2011-06-21,4,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Allow me to preface, i seldom give 1 or 2 stars: A lot had to be missing for any dining establishment to fall in this category. 

it was a saturday night at the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino.  H and I were in a hurry to grab a quick bite before heading to the Marquee Night club.  The cafe would surely prepare a hearty meal, but as the minutes ticked away, we knew that time was not on our side.  Luckily (or unluckily in this case) China Poblano jumped out of nowhere and had a sign that said ""to go or take out.""  instantly, i'm thinking it's kinda like Taco Bell fast, but let's just say that we're lucky to get our food in less than 20 minutes.

the menu was a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  unique? not really.  anybody can make any type of meat and throw it in a tortilla shell and call it mexican food.  anybody creating this type of concept needs to think it through to create a unique dining experience for everyone who passes through the doors.  come'on, people travel from all over the world to come to vegas.  is this is best meal the Cosmo can offer?  i believe not.

THE PORK SIU MAI were a disgrace to Chinese people who invented this dish.   i have eaten this all my life in OC & LA & even SF and have never seen anything so tiny.  it was literally the size of a quarter, all 6 of them, looking pretty sad and lonely in this takeout container that it was tossed into.  no shredded lettuce or cabbage for garnishment.  just 6 puny little siu mai's squished to the corner of the container.  i finished them in 2 minutes and naturally was not full at all.  the taste -- it was ok, not spectacular.

THE TACOS that H had were another dismal dish that appeared from the same menu.  i can't quite comment on the taste but the size was disappointing.

the prices.... were not cheap. both microscopic & macroscopic items came in slightly less than $30.  what?  does money grow on trees?  Asians are taught to get the best bang for the buck and to bargain our way through life... this time i felt jipped & helpless.  left the establishment with a more than half empty stomach & feeling robbed.

THE EXPERIENCE:
ok, granted we order takeout, but there was no place to sit outside in the hallways of the hotel.  it's just not sexy or classy to eat in the hallways.  meanwhile inside, the bar was completely empty (as in zero, zip, zilch, nada patrons).  We asked the girl cleaning the bar if we could please sit there for a few minutes, and she said yes. then, like a bat out of hell, the hostess stormed over and said we cannot sit there.  what?  did you not realize we were not fighting for seats but actually making your establishment appear fuller than it is?  so, she escorted us to these benches behind the bar with pillows that we could sit in.  for all the commotion that she caused by moving us, we could've finished our food in the 2 minutes that it requires to consume our so-called meal.

IN CONCLUSION:
this place is not suitable in such a gorgeous hotel as the Cosmopolitan.  it does not compare to its elegance, its grandeur, and its sophistication.  the people who work there need to grace better manners and accommodate its patrons a little better.

i would highly suggest you save your money and go to the cafe downstairs or win a couple of hands in blackjack and eat at Blue Ribbon Sushi or STK instead.",4Tl0MS3HwKjJPfRNWk3wDw,8,4,2,ExZU6L-mmg4awKrQ-Sghcg
2134081,2011-07-14,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I really enjoyed our dining experience here. If I could live on a diet of  just salt air margaritas, I would.  What a delightful concoction! We went for more of a Mexican feast than Chinese, so here is the breakdown.

The Tacos: 
Pancita al Pastor (slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple) - Great play on flavors. The pork belly had good crispness to it and complemented the pineapple. 

Viva China* (soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce) - My husband's favorite. Great fusion taco. The tendon was cooked just right. 

Silencio (duck tongue/ fresh lychee) - Neither of us had tried duck tongue before, so we had to try it. FANTASTIC! The sauce had a bit of spice to it that really made work. 

Barbacoa de Res (Oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/ pickled cactus paddle) - The was a big taco filled with flavorful barbacoa and nopales. I'm not sure if it was worth the price, but it was tasty. 

Carnitas (braised baby pig/pork rinds/ spicy salsa verde cruda) - This was the favorite of the night. The carnitas were perfect, but the addition of the pork rinds really made this taco off the chain! We could have eaten 10 of these. 

The Rest:
Huitlacoche Noodles (wild mushrooms/ fresh Mexican corn truffle/ knife-shaved noodles) - The huitlacoche actually worked well in this dish. I wasn't sure going in, but felt adventurous. The noodles were cooked perfectly. This is a dish that is big enough to share. This dish was surprisingly spicy, so beware. 

Queso Fundido (melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas...with chorizo) - TASTY! Maybe a bit expensive. It reminded me of being with family in Mexico and eating fresh tortillas off of the comal with cheese. 

Mango Sticky Rice - The was actually a cream of sweet rice on top of Mango shave ice topped with crispy rice (think rice krispies) and fresh mango. Very refreshing!

If you don't like large crowds, this is unfortunate, if you like to see a lot of pretty people dressed in their sexy Saturday night bests, which is what you should expect when you even think about going to the cosmo, you will feel right at home.  I wasn't expecting much from China Poblano after reading all the negative yelps, but I was pleasantly surprised.  You cannot go to a high end Chinese or Mexican restaurant ready to compare it to the tastes and prices of hole in the wall joints in Sgv or East LA.  That is the problem of a lot of yelpers out there.  You have to realize your surroundings, you are in a high end hotel in Vegas and a Jose Andres restaurant.  You should know what to expect in prices, but you should also know you are getting good fresh ingredients and beautiful decor.  And last, you need to try the food with an open palate and not expecting the tastes that you grew up with at neighborhood restaurant.  Here's what I tried:

Carnitas taco - excellent
Barbacoa taco - good
BBQ pork buns: different, but good, no your typical fatty pork
Shu Mai: again different, but good
Ha gao:  ok
Glass noodle salad: excellent and refreshing
Mole fries:  not too good
Queso fundido with chorizo: excellent
Chicken and rice soup :  spicy but good

There are also two food bars you can sit at, one has a view of authentic Chinese people making dim sum and the other has Hispanic people preparing guacamole and other yummy foods,  which I thought was pretty cool.

2135052,2014-11-07,3,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Jose Andres has basically taken over the culinary world, and China Poblano is his way of throwing his weight around.

A chef and hospitality group has to be very confident in the Chef's star power to pull off a fusion of two dissimilar cuisines, but China Poblano works because Chef Andres doesn't offer Mexican-Chinese fusion, instead, he merely offers Mexican and Chinese food on the same menu and under the same roof.  Both are done well - sometimes average, sometimes excellent - and overall the experience is satisfying.

Like all restaurants in Las Vegas, the cost-value ratio is skewed to high cost, even though the value isn't actually exceptional.  While the tacos are tasty, I've had better out of food trucks and paid half.  The twenty-vegetable fried rice is perhaps the tastiest expression of fried rice a diner might ever enjoy, but making it a meal requires adding shrimp and beef, meaning you'll pay about $40 for a bowl of friend rice!

My coworker and I swung by for a late night snack after not being able to snag a dinner reservation. I had high hopes because this is a Jose Andres restaurant and I have been dying to try The Bazaar. 

These hopes somewhat fell flat. Our selections:
Shrimp Mojo: shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano pepper
Silencio Taco: duck tongue/fresh lychee
Viva China:  soft beef tendon/Kumamoto oyster/scallions/Sichuan peppercorn sauce
Barbacoa: Oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/pickled cactus paddle

I appreciated the interesting mix of ingredients but the Silencio & Viva China really fell flat on the texture side. They were all just kind of mushy. The most flavorful was the Barbacoa. The pickled cactus added a nice balance to the otherwise strong barbacoa meat. The shrimp mojo had a lot of good flavor but perhaps it would have gone better with steak. The delicate texture of the shrimp was completely lost amongst the sauce. 

What really saved our meal was dessert: Tres Lychees: a new take on the Mexican classic. It comprised of the soaked cake, whipped cream, ice cream, fresh lychee & fresh flowers. It was an amazing mix of lychee textures and flavors. Everything tasted like lychee but played off of each other harmoniously. Each flower had a different flavor that also complimented the dish.

The tacos are literally street tacos. The ones you can finish in 2 bites. I didn't think any of the tacos had much flavor or kick to it. Being priced at $5.50/taco, this is absurd!

The guacamole you can rave about, but it is $15 for a small order. Really? We needed two for our table.

It added the perfect touch to the already rich and comforting broth.   A bit pricey, at almost $18 for the bowl, but you're talking about and Andres restaurant on the Strip.  

Those fearing asian fusion fare will be relieved to know the fusion is minimal. There is a Chinese side and a Mexican side, with some dishes borrowing from both cultures.

Lucky 6: beef is good as well as traditional, the beef has gold leaf which is a nice presentation.  I didn't like the internal texture of the scallop pair.  Could possibly get more dim sum dumplings at a local restaurant but without the luxurious flair.  
Snow pea leaf salad: fairly good, nothing out of the ordinary.  Just not that memorable. 
Papas Fritas with molé: average typical fries, the molé sauce is savory and hearty quite unique 

Service: we sat at the bar and the server was pretty good.  Watching him make the cocktails was interesting.  We kept having servers bring items that we did not order.  We ordered the lucky six but was brought the six traditional.  They fixed the order but it was awkward.  

Ambiance: very pretty, feels like a definite mixture of Latin and Asian style.  Not too crowded or cramped but we did sit at the bar.

When you have food runners and bus-persons handling your tables... There is no excuse for you to be hard to reach. 

We came in last night, party of 11. Our server took forever to take a drink order. Our food order. Forgot about certain questions we needed answers to. And just down right looked like she didn't give a crap about her job. No personality... Not even a smile from this girl. 

She came over only once to see if our food was ok. And not to the entire table either... She came up behind one end of the table and asked with a low voice if we needed anything. Any other time.. We had to stop her from avoiding us to call her over. 

Didn't seem like she was busy either. I watched her the entire time. No rush. No pep. The only table she bothered to table touch was the party of 2 in front of us!

The basic job requirement: drink refills, wasn't even done! I purposely waited to see if she would come by and offer me another iced tea. (Because I had a water to get me by) Not once. That cup had bare ice all throughout my meal. 

To management: We stiffed Kimberly on a $340 tab... because she didn't deserve the tip that was suggested. She's lucky she got anything at all. I'll tell you who did earn it though, and did get it. Manuela. The bus woman who made sure we had extra small plates. Brought us limes/lemons. Refilled our drinks. Asked how we were doing on more than one occasion. You know.

Definitely a neat concept. The space is really cool, you can see them making the tacos and noodles from the outside.

We made a reservation which was the right call since the place was pretty full. The waiter recommended ordering a few dishes to share, so that's the route we went. We ordered, tacos, siu mai, wings, mongolian beef, and the queso fundido (basically make your own quesadilla). The food comes out as its ready, so it's kind of fun waiting to see what comes next.

The item was the tacos and I have to say the barbacoa taco is easily in my Top 3 Tacos of All Time. Absolutely amazing. I regret not ordering more them. We also got the carnitas which was good but can't be compared to the barbacoa.

After that came the beef siu mai which I thought tasted a little off. The rest of my party did not finish it either. Luckily the asian wings and mongolian beef arrived quickly after that. I really liked the wings, but the mongolian beef could have been from any corner Chinese shop.

And that was it. Oh wait, what about the queso fundido. It still hadn't come 20 minutes after the previous dish. We asked our waiter about it and it had either never been reported to the kitchen or they lost the ticket. Either way it came out right away after we asked, but they were not apologetic at all.

What I DIDN'T do is check the Yelp! reviews, and I'm glad I didn't. What we experienced was so far different from most reviews that I've just read!
OK look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. And the ""salt air margarita"" (I just HAD to try one) was worth every cent!  I have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. 
The wait staff were friendly and efficient. The manager, Iñigo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo. It came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. Adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharrón topping. I had a fish taco which was fantastic, and K'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). 
The drinks were what really got me excited. After the ""salt air margarita"" I had another specialty called a ""Mexican gin and tonic."" It's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and I don't know what else, but it worked. For dessert I had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!

But if was able to eat there I think it would go a little something like this:  ""Hello waiter, may I come indoor and order hot food?""  ""Ce Senor, would you like the chop sticks?""  ""Yes, my new best friend, I would.""

Absolutely awful!!!
I'm writing this review while sitting here regretting that I even stepped in. 
I am literally choking to death on the ridiculous amounts of salt in every dish we ordered. 
Thank god for the chrysanthemum tea that's currently cleaning out the pound o salt I just ingested. 
I don't even care that it cost $8 for a tiny pot of it. 

I couldn't even taste any of the food due to the overwhelming salt level. 
Someone needs to inform the chef that there are other forms of seasoning besides salt. 

To top it off, our bill for 2 dim sum dishes and 2 soups totaled $80!!!

I will not eat here ever again and suggest nobody even dare try it...unless you like eating salt!",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,1,0,1,iAI4JsqsOnqYsogJIYh3ug

The place had a good number of customers but was not packed.  The food was great! I cannot rave enough about the food  The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because of the horrible service.  

When we arrived our waiter was nice and polite, though this quickly changed as our meal progressed.  Our waiter (gentleman with a pony tail) was visibly upset as 3 of us wanted to try the tasting menu while the other 4 ladies chose to order separate dishes.  We understood his initial issue, he was concerned about the fact that the tasting menu is composed of 14 items and are served progressively.  He clarified that the ladies order the tasting menu would finish eating last and the others would be stuck watching us eat.  The thing is, these ladies did not mind it at all, they encouraged us to order the tasting menu, they themselves could not order it as it includes seafood and they do not enjoy it. There was also a bit of a confusion as the waiter took a couple of the orders wrong, the ladies asked for ""carnitas taco"" and they brought out ""cochinita pibil.""  They brought it out twice even though we clarified that they did not want cochinita, they wanted carnitas.  The waiter's attitude was horrible, it was simply not needed and very unexpected for a Jose Andres restaurant.  The rest of the wait staff was great, very friendly.  I must add that though there were 7 of us, we made sure to make it easier on the waiter by paying in cash and not making a fuss over anything. 

Now to the food....it was AMAZING!!!!! 14 delectable dishes!! the steamed bun was one of my favorites, as was the dumpling.  The hearts of palm salad had a bit of a tang, that dressing was like crack! I also tried my friend's salad, the meat on that salad was sooooo tender! It was like biting into a cloud! I want it right now!!!  My least favorite dishes were the soup and the carnitas taco.  The soup was too fishy for my taste, I drowned it in chilli paste and it made it so much better.  As for the taco, there was no novelty in that dish.  The only thing about the taco that stood out was the chicharron, it was light and crispy, but besides that, I am totally ok paying less at my local mexican market.

I hope management takes my review into account when training the staff.  The horrible service made a dent into what could have easily been our best dining experience in Vegas.",YjJJCrkAKvRzbqo8oNQxdA,0,0,3,CFZ3eFcg-cktTcmN_52tvQ

The twenty-vegetable fried rice was recommended by the waiting staff, so I tried it.  It lacked a lot of flavor and was not at all like fried rice.  It was more of a kamut and vegetable salad mix, if you ask me.  The rice had a nutty flavor that was nice, though, and it paired well with the vegetables.  However, I would hesitate to call it ""fried rice.""

The chilaquiles and tamale rojo were pretty good; I highly recommend the chilaquiles if you are a fan of cilantro.  

Nothing really stood out to me about this place except for the churros--the churros were delicious.  They were served hot with a chocolate dipping sauce, which I think was made with Mexican chocolate but I'm not quite sure.  I wasn't a huge fan of the dipping sauce because I'm not a fan of chocolate that tastes like tootsie rolls.

This place was awesome.  The decor is super casual and friendly.  There are some cool displays throughout that attempt to define the fusion aspect of the restaurant.  In Chef Andres own word's ""we must build bridges not walls with our differences"".  There are a various array of choices from both Chinese and Mexican small plates.  

The setas taco, the lengua taco, and the silencio taco arrived at our table in such a rapid succession I was instantly transported to a blissful world of flavorful bliss. The sea air margarita was so light and refreshing I had to marvel at its creation.  No doubt about the true genius behind the cuisine at any of Chef Andres's restaurants, but this one feels as though they are really trying go the extra mile. 

The staff was so down to Earth and friendly.  They know that their menu is unusual and are more than willing to work with you to figure out the best choices for your group.

CHINA POBLANO

Working ourselves from light to medium on heaviness, we ventured to what is another Jose Andres restaurant, China Poblano- a Chinese Mexican (not fused) cuisine that confuses and delights at the same time.  It's definitely a split personality (akin to that psycho you may have dated at one point....)
but if you go for the ride, you may be pleasantly surprised.  I tend to favor more of the Chinese cuisine, and their appetizer/dim sum selections is quite addictive and a perfect fit to our second leg of the Food Crawl...
         
The interior decor is an attack on the senses, an onslaught of hyperbolic technicolor thrown together miss mosh, like graphics on an side street in Tokyo...chaotic.  And with two unseeingly mismatched cuisines housed under one roof, so is the the decor; the room is bifurcated down the middle, Mexican on one side, Chinese on the other (a modern West Side Story? Jets and Shark Fins?)

As for drinks, we started with a Cantelope Agua Fresca; this beverage is naturally sweet and just the right amount of nectar and water, no sugar comas or bouncing off of walls like the Tasmanian Devil on a pogo stick.

An alter.....to what? it's so friction strange, I dunno, do you sit here, or pray....? but the food's good, so I let this one pass...

As I'm partial to the Chinese Dim Sum offerings at CP, the Har Gau: Shrimp, Pork Belly and Shitake Mushrooms wrapped in a translucent skin and steamed, creating the perfect little bite.  Devouring every piece, I love to add Soy and Chili Sauce to punch it up till it's over the top with flavor.

This dish my favorite: Lamb Potstickers 'Stuck on You': six dumplings connected together with a crispy lace-from a visual standpoint, it's so delicate and fragile as you break off a piece, but it's another story when you put it in your mouth.  The dumplings are fried pouches full of unctuous lamb meat, full of juice and fat it bursts in your mouth, the cumin is just a powerhouse of spice, making it a hearty dish.",NVA5YEBmV_OdgCuI5RGp3A,1,1,4,sfqGdWuR5jmZ3W-hvVJaOA
2263303,2011-07-27,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"This time, we dined inside the restaurant for some of the tastiest, most exciting dishes I've tried recently. Our server was extremely knowledgeable on the entire menu and quick to offer suggestions. It was a little awkward hearing the waitstaff explain to each table that the portion sizes for some dishes are very small (i.e. dim sum), but fair warning, as the prices are a bit steep. But if you're willing to pay for quality, China Poblano certainly delivers. 
All the food was executed perfectly. I enjoyed the huitlacoche quesadilla with chihuahua cheese that was featured as a chef's special that night. The signature 20 vegetable fried rice was something like a garden party in a bowl, with baby carrots and greens sprouting from the top. Each bite brought a new vegetable surprise: snap peas, several varieties of mushrooms, crunchy jicama, cauliflower, carrots shaped like flowers, and easily silenced my usual complaint that fried rice never contains enough vegetables.
And, as to that dessert I'd been waiting to try, the mango ""sticky rice""  was as fantastic as I'd anticipated. I'm a big fan of the traditional Thai version, but I'll dream about this coconut custard, sweet cubes of mango with lime zest, and whipped coconut cream topped with caramelized crispy rice, all perfectly complemented by the crunch of the mango granita hidden inside. I will definitely be back for more.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,1,1,4,VPExjReOqnaOqYqoX5Cyjw

BUT ... and this is a freaking ginormous BUT ... the prices for what you get at China Poblano are downright ridiculous. Although above average on taste and presentation, the foods themselves do not merit the prices they charge.

$12 for 4 ""When Pigs Fly"" which are basically roast pork buns. The dough is very light and the filling is tasteful. BUT it is SPARSE. There was barely any actual filling in the bun. Ludicrous.

A typical roast pork bun costs $1.50 at a Chinese bakery on Spring Mountain and it is FILLED with roast pork.

2267525,2012-07-08,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I tried China Poblano for the first time on a Thursday night. The menu sounded good but something stuck out right away. It says in bold type at the top, ""What brings Mexico and China together?"", and goes on to briefly answer this question. Now, to me, it would seem there was an effort to blend the two cuisines. However, looking over the menu I could see this was not the case, save a couple of dishes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but the menu intro suggests fusion when in reality it's more like co-habitation. 
We sat at the bar where you can see the tortillas being made fresh constantly. The ambiance was noisy but not over-bearing and the lack of a DJ certainly helped things unlike some other Cosmopolitan eatery that rhymes with Coal Screens. The service was prompt and I felt the server was very good at explaining menu items that may have been spicy, contained raw foods, or were otherwise out of the ordinary. 
I ordered a Carnitas taco and a Viva China taco. The tortillas are about 6 inches in diameter and not overstuffed so be prepared for this before you go. This is not Tacqueria (insert name here) that serves heaping piles of food with beans and rice on the side. The tacos are served by themselves and any sides are extra. That being said, the tacos I ordered were very good. The Viva China taste is a bit dominated by the raw oyster. The Carnitas taco was top notch. Both tacos seemed a little on the greasy side but most of it was the sauce/salsa leaking out the bottom. 
And now to the price. Yes, this place is expensive compared to an actual street vendor but it's in a casino. The menu is posted outside the restaurant and freely available online. Do a little research ahead of time and you can decide for yourself if the price is fair. 
China Poblano is great if you just need a quick bite to eat before a show or before heading out for the night. The take out window is a nice amenity if you're just passing through and need a bit of sustenance. I would not recommend China Poblano for a big meal simply because the a la carte nature of the menu can add up quickly.

For foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  Super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  

We started out with the Pozole Rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  This was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  You can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. Apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  Hair of the dog, you know.

Next we tried the Viva China taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a Kumamoto oyster, and Sichuan sauce.  Yes, beef tendon in a taco.  This was extremely tasty.  I could eat ten of these.

We also tried the Cochinita Taco ($4.50 each).  It's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  Pretty good, but the Carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.

Another great dish was the Papas with XO sauce ($6).  French fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  They serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  But it's actually really, really good!

The big surprise of the night was the Gaspacho Morelia ($10).  This is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  Some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  Pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. Very good and light.

The cocktails are also very inventive.  I don't think I can ever have a normal margarita again after having the salt air margarita ($12) served here.  The salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  My husband had the lychee sour ($12) which was also very good.  

$63 before tip and we were very, very full.  Service was impeccable and very friendly.  Just focus on the more creative dishes.  Yeah, you can get a pork bun in Chinatown for cheaper.  Of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  Come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,8,6,5,arQx8EqJF5VXY3YO8VI7hQ

We were all first timers. We all enjoy eating and drinking. So talk about spread of food!!! It felt like ordered half the menu or close enough could barely walk out of the restaurant post dinner. Lol! Awesome.

My first impression was confusion to be honest. It not often see menu half the menu is Chinese and Mexican. Not that options are ever a bad thing in life. It makes me paranoid. China Poblano does great job of staying true to the two styles of cuisine. 

Mexican side. Holy Guacamole!! It not often get fresh Guacamole. I can not say in words the difference it makes being fresh made right in front of u. Plus the show is little bonus entertainment. Light, just right amount of acid or lemon juice, refreshing, and fresh chips. I could have Guacamole and chips all day. I ordered two each of carnitas and lengths. The carnitas was by far the winnable of the two. The meat was cooked perfection and the fried chicharonn brings it all together. It pairing never think of but it works!! The lengths taco was ok. Lengua it was thin sliced pieces rather then diced. Different. 

Chines side.. Twenty vegetable fried rice by far the winnah!!! Not sure if twenty vegetables in it. All I know was it had great depth of flavor, hearty, HUGE bowl of it, and fried rice at its finest. Mongolian Beef Lettuce Wraps was good. The beef had great seasoning  and enjoyed the dish. When Pigs Fly is basically Manapua but bland just ok.

Didn't make a difference.  We were there to have some drinks, it is Vegas after all, and to have a really nice dinner, but we didn't even feel like ordering a second drink.  What a boring dinner.

We complained again, at that point we just wanted to leave.  We asked for our check and we noticed the waitress took the check to the manager, and he said ok and brought the bill to us.  Not only was the service lacking, but we ordered more salsa and they nickled and dimed us $2.18 for the extra little serving of salsa.  I was shocked that a restaurant who charges $15 plus dollars per drink would nickel and dime us on the salsa.  We were charged 4 times for extra salsa.  Also the desert lacked any flavor, it was mango with whipped cream and rice krispies tossed on it.  Mostly whipped cream, this dessert should have been called rice krispies with whipped cream.  It was strange and not what we expected in a 5 star Hotel and Casino.  Vegas is all about the service, and this place is lacking.",Kfbxl1fSRZGP6A1IroJcvg,1,0,2,jYJ6vScZfxvfNB4qt7RitA

It's supposed to be a fusion between Chinese and Mexican food... However I did not see any true fusion. The menu was half Mexican and half Chinese, there wasn't a blend/fusion which I was hoping for. I was expecting g something unique line a Chinese inspired dumpling with Mexican infused flavours... However I didn't see anything like that.

Coctel de Camarones - on the pricey side for it's size ($15), though very nicely presented.

The moles and pipian had no resemblance to the rich and flavors we find in Mexico, or good Mexican food in Oaxacan restaurants.

4- tacos: I believe they were lamb tacos with chicharrón. The chicharrón added a nice crunch factor. I really enjoyed this dish.
5- salad. Honestly, not overly impressed with this one. Sure it was a decent salad, but felt like a cop-out. Would've rather had a soup or something.
6-shrimp in a mole: this was to die for. Was enough for 3.3 shrimp each for 3 people. I could've easily have eaten all 10. If nothing else, this and then next dish are musts.
7- 20 vegetable fried rice: surprisingly the star of the meal, my friend and I (all proud meat eaters) could not get enough of this. I have never had so much flavor in fried rice before. Would love to get this recipe. If I can add even half the amount of flavor, it'd be a hit at parties/potlucks.
8- mango sticky rice: wasn't in love with this. Was expecting traditional Thai mango sticky rice (which I really like) so the giant heap of whipped cream on top of some crunchy ice cream wasn't doing it for me.

Service: decent service. Nothing terrible, but nothing stand out. My water was empty a few times and I had to call someone over to refill.

What we got:

Rainbow Congee. Amazing especially after a late night. Easy on the stomach and very flavorful thanks to the sausage (there are snowpeas and carrots in there too, so you've got your daily veggie instake). At $8.88, very cheap for five-star hotel restaurants and the serving size is quite large.

Carnitas & fried fish tacos. Tasty but rather small. Us girls easily consumed 3 tacos each and guys can probably do 5 no problem. At $5-6.50 per, that's quite expensive for just tacos. 

Caesar salad. Taste like Caesar salad everywhere else, but $12 for a very small serving.

Cafe Sierra for the Lobster Buffet

This place is pretty bad in which I have to share my experience to save others from trying it. 

Back to this review, it's finals week, Im procrastinating and I wonder to myself. LA Food and Prices spoils me. San Diego forces me into this misconception of what prices should be as everything is 1-3 more dollars expensive in San Diego than it is in L.A while quality is just the same if not worse. Now you're thinking 1-3 dollars isnt that much but when you add in another 1-2 dollars in tips. that's 5 dollars more per meal.

As a starving college student on a low calorie diet ( trust me i'm down 60 lbs) I probably shouldn't be eating out so I shouldn't complain. But even the poorest college student has to have their starbucks every morning. 

Now on to the story, being that it's in Vegas, I was pretty much drunk the whole time, from Thursday night until Saturday, completely drunk ALL day. I ended up needing nail polish. oh lord. 

Being as how I was drunk the whole time I forgot to eat. Being hungry I looked around for food and saw a pizza place, I should have went there cause it was a lot better than China Poblano. But at the time I saw, ""Oh wow Chinese food and Mexican food? this is interesting let's check this place out"" 

The first thing you notice about the place is very fancy cause it Vegas, but your jaws gape and your eyes bulge when you see the prices. The prices here ranges a fancy restaurant but the food is no where near fancy. 

Now when I was in line it looked at the taco they had here were actually pretty fresh as I saw them make it from scratch, however, it seems like the Chinese food here comes from some back room in the back where you do not see how they attempt to make your food. 

Back to this review. I order Swallow A Cloud which already has the imagery of swallowing some strange white liquid as the liquid itself was actually brown, but I should have been weary when they give Chinese Won Ton the name of ""Swallow A Cloud"" I did absolutely no swallowing as I threw away most of the Won Ton that I ordered. But seriously, who came up with these names.

Now you're trying to swallow misty white cloud, sounds sketch right? well you shouldn't even attempt because it was absolutely horrible. 

The description state that is ""fresh""white noodle and wonton but it tasted no where near ""fresh"" as it was absolutely horrible. You get 3 small pieces of wonton, half a handful of crappy package noodles, and a unflavorful broth for 20 bucks. At the time I was thinking, 20 bucks, it CAN't be that bad. I should have went to wicked spoon or panda express. 

i have absolutely no idea how this place gets 3\5 stars

I'd probably have more luck finding ""chinese"" food across the street at Panda Express. What a sad statement right?",QnO9I7wLQzmUtM865H-tCw,0,0,1,wl-Wxme_wybgMkMZU1CWqw
2448235,2014-01-06,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"One of my favorite spots for lunch in Vegas! I love the atmosphere. It's festive and fun without being loud and obnoxious. Their salt air margaritas are absolutely to die for, and my friend has been re-creating them perfectly for at least a year. It takes some work to make the ""air,"" but it's totally worth it! One of my favorite drinks anywhere.

The concept of Mexican-Asian fusion seemed a little bizarre to me at first, but there is plenty of separation on the menu if you are not an adventurous eaters. It's fun to mix and match Mexican and Asian small plates and go between.

I have been here 3 or 4 times, and have tried a variety of dishes. Almost every dish is a small plate or appetizer, and my friends and I always get a variety of options to share. The guacamole is outstanding, and there are plenty of gluten free options (including the chips), which pleased my gluten free friends. When Pigs Fly is one of my favorite appetizers. The steamed buns are super filling, but delicious.

I would recommend trying at least one of the sui mai options, and if you are indecisive, try the combination! The Dan Dan Mian noodles are delicious, but definitely on the heavy side. The twenty-vegetable fried rice is also a go-to, especially if you are feeling the need to eat more vegetables during your time in Vegas!

I am very picky about Margaritas and I must say that this was the best one I have ever had.  The salt foam was fantastic.  Ok, so yes, the food is expensive but it is delicious, and its from a celebrity chef at a Las Vegas restaurant so what do you expect.  I still think it is worth the high price.  My husband and I each ordered a taco and shared two appetizers.  This was a perfect amount of food.  We each loved our tacos, I had the Tinga Poblana which was awesome, kinda like a gourmet breakfast burrito.  My husband had the Silencio, which was a duck tongue taco, he said it was great and the tongues had perfect texture.  We shared the When Pigs Fly Dim Sum which was a good steamed pork bun.

2465524,2012-03-13,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"My brother wanted to try this place out and rightfully so.  I mean how many places serve chinese and mexican food under one roof?  Notwithstanding the concept, the bright lights and artistic decor you felt like something was a bit off.  I expected to see a fusion of dishes on the menu, but instead it was more like two restaurants on one menu.  Although I feel like its a novel concept, the prices are high for what it normally costs.  Now granted maybe it costs more to maintain this kind of a restaurant, but the general knowledge of mexican and chinese food, is that it shouldn't be extremely expensive without some fancy hard to find, hard to spell, impossible to make dish that's tagged for $$$ dollars 

Ordered:
Chips and Salsa $4 (The chips were good and the salsa was fire roasted)

The Unruly Monk - hand-cut noodles/ wild wood ear mushrooms/ poached egg/spicy sauce $17.88  (Very good, although I've had this at a standard chinese restaurant at very good tastes for half the price.)

Lengua  - beef tongue/salsa pasilla $4 (Fantastic melted in your mouth)

Viva China - soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 (One of the strangest things I've ever tasted, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not.  The consistency of the oyster just makes the whole thing a little off.)

So in summary, this restaurant is an interesting idea, although I don't think its implemented quite right.  Pre established bargain cuisine, such as Chinese and Mexican, can certainly throw someone well versed in that universe into a frenzy with prices.  Although our waiter was great, the service just didn't justify the prices.

If you don't plan to eat much, then it's $$, but if you plan to actually eat a meal, then make it $$$.

I found myself exploring the Cosmopolitan on my own when I came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced Chinese food in one window and Mexican food in another.  I stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what I thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.

Since I was dining alone I was seated at the dim sum bar where I had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=zE32BWJoqOAZL4TmaNlT3w) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  I decided to order from both the Chinese and Mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.

For starters I ordered one of two Agua Frescas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=W60P4p4WhAKZMHqhVyGHmw) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  From the Dim Sum menu I selected the Sui Mai Scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the Har Gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  From the Tacos menu I selected an individual Carnitas taco and the Pescado Frito taco.  I agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.

The Pescado Frito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=8cIp34h9uM_xmdh4LajsUg) taco arrived first.  On paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a Mexican salsa, but the fish I had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  No matter its preparation I liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  This was a very simple but very good fish taco.

The Carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=9WJy0kQq33M7dBVaCtAbNw) was up next.  This was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  When the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  If I really wanted to pig out I could have easily devoured another three of these.

The dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until I was ready to enjoy.  This helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while I worked on my tacos.

I had the Har Gau (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ugVecr8s4E13Ak4f0t3P8w) first.  These were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  The shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while I didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.

I saved the Sui Mai Scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=OG_yUcneFS9wu0I9ejqQLg) for last.  These were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais I've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  In terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  The soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  I enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food I just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.

A quirky but compelling mix of Chinese and Mexican cuisine (but NOT ON THE SAME PLATE, thank GAWD!), you're free to mix-and-match however you please, just like the decor, which I can only describe as ""Big Trouble In Little Chinese Tijuana.""

We started off with chips and salsa. I am a sucker for fresh, warm chips and these pretty much RULED.  Most with a palate for something a little kickier will find the salsa wanting, but having been burned by too many MUY CALIENTE sauces in the past, I found this one just right.

Bear kicked it off with one of the tacos as well - I don't remember which, but the blissful look on his face was recommendation enough for me.  I decided to mix it up with two tacos: the chicken and mole poblano and the BBQ pork with marinated onions, along with ""When Pigs Fly"": four delicately steamed buns filled with more BBQ pork.  Bear had the ""Special 8"" Dim Sum - (probably not getting the name right, but I won't forget that taste!) - delicate, tasty jewels of meat, spices and veggies swathed in very light wrappers. I had bites of the chicken and pork...which I will have to definitely try in the future!

It was all A-MAZING. Paired with rum-and-Cokes for me (Negra Modelos for Bear), the tastes of each item are light and exquisite - tender meats, flavorful but not overpowering sauces, but don't sit brick-like in your stomach as most chain-restaurant style Chinese and/or Mexican foods have a tendency to do.  

Because I'd really had a taste for some pho noodles all week (nursing a pretty wicked cold earlier), I knew I wouldn't get them here, but when I saw ""Dan-Dan Mian"" noodles on the menu, I knew I wasn't leaving until I had some, which I ordered in lieu of dessert.  I love good ""Dan-Dan"" as much as the next Chinese food enthusiast, but THESE? Not saying it wasn't a healthy sized portion, but these bad boys made me wish for a kiddie-pool sized bowl that I could jump into and do the backstroke in. Oh, yeah.  They are THAT. FREAKIN'. GOOD.

Bear had a dessert I did have a bite of - mangos with a light creamy sauce and maybe pine nuts? - that I made a mental note to have next time we visit.

To sum it up - awesome food, great service from everyone, but most especially from our bartender/server Casey. However, I only have one 'caveat' to present.  When the bill arrived, it did give me one of those ""RUH-ROH, RAGGY!"" moments when I saw the total.  Not saying you have to be Mark Cuban or Steve Wynn to eat here, but if you have a more-than-healthy appetite - and we do, you may want to put China on your ""Special Occasions Only"" list.  It's just that all that wonderful food DOES add up (all tacos, dim sum and other items are priced separately), so you may want to have a ""point guard"" with you to keep an eye on the rising tab. 

Other than that, I would dare say that we'll be back!",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,2,2,4,Q39WL4YyO-5tw45Msp4pqQ

Three Stars

I always get excited by dumplings and Asian/Mexican fusion but I am usually disappointed.  This place was no different.  The atmosphere was fun and had unique eye catching design elements.  The Negro Modelo was only $6 dollars which was cheaper than any other place.  We started with Chips and Guacamole for $15 which was good but I rather make my own.  I had a $5 Carnitas Taco with Pork Cracklings which was delicious.  I also had the Lucky 6 Pork Dumplings ($13.88)*, which had three different types with three different garnishes: Tobiko, Radish, & Gold Leaf.  The dumplings were overly salty and you can easily get better ones at any Chinatown restaurant.  

I guess I was hoping that there would have been more fusion but instead it was just place to eat Mexican or Asian food.

We liked it so much that we came back for dinner and ordered the hot and sour soup again, the shrimp mojo and the tuna ceviche. The shrimp mojo was very good - it was stir fried with sweet black onion and poblano pepper so it was very tasty. The tuna was also great. It was a very nice cut of tuna topped with amaranth seeds, soy sauce and pecans which made a very good yet unique dish - not your average tuna ceviche!

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango ""sticky rice""- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The ""rice"" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate ""terrain""- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.

This is an interesting concept: Take the best of both culinary cultures, and blend some to create unique dishes. It's fusion, but not totally, since some of the dishes remain faithful to the traditional recipes.

We ordered and shared family style, so that meant we sampled a bunch of tacos and noodles. Some were nice hits, some were really bad misses.

Highlights:
Huitlacoche Noodles - I've always wanted to try huitlacoche (corn smut fungus), and it integrates seamlessly into this Chinese-styled dish. However, they skimped on how much huitlacoche they gave. Also it takes on flavors so well that I couldn't tell what was the corn itself or if it just absorbed the black bean sauce. Still very tasty though.
Pozole - I love pozole already and it's funny because there's tons of hominy in this dish (whereas the huitlacoche was lacking). The twist is that they give Chinese shrimp crackers to dip instead. Yum.
Dim Sum - In general all the dim sum was good, but not great here.

Lowlights:
Unholy Monk Soup - The blandest, blandest soup evar. Don't monks usually deprive themselves of earthly pleasures? Eat this and you'll feel like a monk too - this dish deprives you of all flavor. Don't give alms to this one.
Viva China Tacos - This has oysters. I pretty much only like oysters fresh & raw with lemon. When oysters get messed with any more than that, they tend to taste funky. The rest of the taco - very good. The oyster part - bad.

So while this place has a great concept, some of the dishes just aren't very good. I like how they maintain both traditional and want to mix it up too.

2608458,2011-01-24,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I enjoyed some of the food and drinks at China Poblano, but I am baffled as to what the fuss is all about.

My biggest pet peeve with this restaurant was that it is pretentiously creative.  I agree that the concept of Chinese and Mexican food served together is an interesting (and successful) one, but then it goes too far.  For example, I ordered gazpacho, expecting some semblance of a cold vegetable soup.  When the waitress brought a fruit plate with orange juice drizzled on top, I assumed the kitchen had made a simple mistake and tried to send it back.  She explained that it was, indeed, gazpacho.  But where was the soup?  She said that the orange juice was the liquid (but literally, the juice was squeezed on like you might squeeze lemon onto a piece of fish...there were only a few drops).  Call it a fruit plate, but don't call it gazpacho.  Gazpacho is a soup.  This was not soup.

The same thing happened with dessert.  I ordered the mango sticky rice and, behold, there was not a single grain of rice on the plate.  The waitress proudly proclaimed that it was ""their take"" on sticky rice, which was really a milky reduction with some mango puree.  If it had blown my mind flavor-wise, I would have been fine with it, but as it was it was a weak little dessert and the texture was slimy.

Also, unless you're dining with only one other person, the concept of sharing at this small plates restaurant will be frustrating.  I spent a relative lot of money on a not-too-substantial amount of food.  Plus, the carnitas tacos were too salty.

The service, too, was unimpressive.  Our waitress completely forgot to bring a drink my friend had ordered, and the servers were repeatedly bringing the wrong dishes to our table.  Everything seemed disorganized.

I loved my margarita, the salt breeze margarita (served with a delightfully light and airy salt foam on top).  I also loved the guacamole.  But, really, I can find good margaritas and guacamole at plenty of other places in Vegas.  On the whole, China Poblano was a disappointment.",brGQl0MPcRkYALg5RLj6aQ,1,1,2,V307w8mlGlBUZtoA1jGaRA

We had the heavenly pigs (roasted pork buns with condensed milk), a 20 (or 24) veggie fried rice, ha-gau (shrimp dumplings) and a vegan mexican spiced hand cut noodle dish.

Let's start with the good, the decor and ambience are on point. You feel like you have gone into a hidden authentic Mexican or Asian village. You have the option to eat at the bar and watch them make the tortillas. Great for groups as well and they have an outdoor window you can pick up and go. 

What makes this such a disappointment is the actual food. They have plenty of choices, but they don't do it justice with the flavors. We got the guac and chips which is made table side, which I lvoe because you can see the ingredients they put in it. Where they failed: stale chips we had to send back TWICE and the guac mixture. They bring you the guac and put it next to you. Then you wait until your server is free so they can mix it up. for us, it took 20 min for our server to mix it and she did a terrible job. The guac has huge chunks and we ended up remixing it ourselves. This leads me to my next point, Service. Terrible. I'm not sure if this is a Vegas thing or just in general at the Cosmopolitan hotel, but service is just terrible everywhere we went, especially here. No one provided recommendations of the menu, asked us for drinks, and took forever to just get some water. 

After the guac and crap service we ended up getting the fish tacos and shrimps in aijio. I'm happy we stopped there because we were going to get the fried rice and some dim sum, but the tacos and shrimp were so bad we said forget it and left somewhere else. The fish tacos were overly fried and overly drenched in mayo to the point it was disgusting to look at. The shrimps did not look like all the other yelp photos. It was beyond soaked and swimming in the sauce that as truly terrible. I NEVER like to leave food, but here we could barely eat it.

I have eaten her 2x. Once in a hurry before entering Marquee and last  week in no rush for a late lunch. The place was calm and somewhat empty so we got great service. 

Sure they hand make dim sum here but I think they are creating dim sum for elves/fairies! I needed a microscope to see my siu mai. They are packed with flavor but not worth $14 for 6 TINY pieces. 

I think they need to work on their portions and maybe hire some dim sum chefs from the bay area. They are on point with the tacos so I won't ding em there. Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for food that costs next to nothing at home.

You also have front row seats to how they prepare their fresh guacamole. It's a lot of fresh avocados and a whole lot of smashing / whisking. I usually order tacos as they fire quick and the flavor profiles are robust. This trip I ordered two Silencio (duck tongue with lychee) and one Viva China (beef tendon with an oyster). The flavors of the duck tongue and lychee compliment each other quick nicely and leave me craving more. The beef tendon has a very intricate prep where each bite you take (3 should be norm) you are left with thin crispy salty crunch bombs that are mixed with the oyster's natural sea water flavor.

While I am not a fan of the Cosmopolitan's brand of chrome and disco decorating, I was immediately taken with the bright colors and fusion of elements in the China Poblano Restaurant.  Immediately one becomes aware of two contrasting cuisines.  As you enter there are two bar areas where diners can watch various food preparations.  One side is devoted to Mexican food and the other to Chinese food.  

This dichotomy is reflected in the menu as well which is divided up largely by types of dishes and the two cuisines.  A closer look shows a comingling of cuisines within though.  

The 20 vegetable vegetable fried rice was so yummy.  As full of vegetables as its name suggests.  The Lamb pot stickers were served under a dome of incredibly thin and delicate pastry.  There was the hint of cumin lurking around the dish that was a beautiful almost haunting harmony with the delicious pot stickers.  One of my favorite dishes while I was in Vegas!

We also enjoyed the guacamole and Golden Pigs (fried AND steamed pork dumplings that were served with a sweet condensed milk sauce, a wonderful balance between sweet and salty flavors).

Finally a Jericalla which was described as an Oaxacan chocolate custard with  passion fruit and chocolate sorbet.  This was an amazingly light and lovely dish.  Beautifully layered as a parfait with solid chocolate in with the creamy elements and contrasting in texture.  Just an amazing combination of tangy fruitiness and deep chocolate flavor.  Really worthwhile.

While this is slightly expensive for casual dining, the quality of ingredients, thoughtful food combinations, beautiful presentations and wonderful service made it a terrific choice for us.

My first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and I believe I have a review for ""the worst thing I've ever eaten"" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. About a year and a half ago I went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices. 

A few weeks ago a friend and I were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to Drais for Chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, I guess I blacked out momentarily from hunger, because I was like ""okay! let's go here!"". WRONG. It was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a Friday night. We each ordered a blood orange margarita at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. We split the queso fundido, and there was nothing fun about it. It was a glop of starchy melted cheese. A 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. A very expensive block of $10 cheese. 

I had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the Dan Dan Mian Noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. She had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. WHAT. 

Jose Andres- what are you doing. You are amazing, Jaleo is amazing (the one in DC is 10x better), Bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain on your reputation.

-Carnitas taco
-Golden Pigs-4pc fried delicate buns/ Chinese barbecue pork/condensed milk: I love dim sum and you pour the condensed milk into the bun for a sweet and savory flavor!
-Beijing Glass -bean sprouts/jicama/ avocado/cellophane noodles/carrot/Chinese cabbage/sesame dressing: This was a very healthy and refreshing noodle/salad, the dressing isn't too heavy with an amazing oriental dressing flavor.

Do Not Recommend:
-Chilaquiles tortilla chips/green tomatillo salsa/Menonita cheese: The chips were all soggy, the flavor was great but the consistency was missing the few Crispy chips that usually come with this type of dish.

Pros
1. Food is good and fun and interesting. It's a mix of a few of your favorite things from a Mexican or Chinese Restaurant. Tacos or Dim Sum, Posole or Won ton soup.  Definitely didn't leave full but I did drop $90 for me and two others (Not sure how that's a Pro) ah yes the set up is pretty awesome that's what drew me in!

Cons
1. That being said while the variety is fun and interesting, it is expensive and the way the menu works has the feel of appetizers and small plates. Tacos run at least $5 for one small taco. While it is good and you can taste the freshness, I know a couple places I can experience an authentic taco for $1.00.

2805276,2011-06-10,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Delicious and amazing food.  Takes a really interesting concept and executes it brilliantly by maintaining lots of traditional Chinese and Mexican dishes in their authentic form, whilst peppering the menu with surprisingly tasty 'fusion' dishes.

As for the traditional fare, the Guacamole and freshly hand made tortillas were delicious.  There wasn't a great deal done to the guac, but the avocados were clearly top notch so thus you let them speak for themselves and the tortillas were as perfect as you've ever had.  The cochinita and barbacoa tacos were exacting and spot-on in their traditional flavor.  For the Chinese side, the 'Traditional Shumai's were light, airy, eggy and packed with umami.  I want a bowl of those Dan-Dan noodles with spicy pork for every hangover I ever have again for the rest of my life.  They were so comforting, and no-nonsense delicious!  The Har Gau's and Whens Fly were both great replicas of what you would find at a great underground Dim Sum restaurant.

For the edgier 'Fusion' dishes, the Scallop Ceviche made my day.  I'm very familiar with Jose Andres' restaurants, and find the 'fluff' and 'molecular' aspects of his cuisine at times to detract from the flavors and enjoyment of some of his dishes, but this one hit it out of the park for me.  The dish is served with individual bay scallops served on a key lime half that has been crusted with what I can assume from my margaritas was more 'Sal de Gusano' (salt, chile powder and roasted caterpillar, yes, caterpillar), and a table side spraying of tequila on each bite.  You're instructed to eat the scallop off the lime and to squeeze it and suck on it while you take on the scallop.  Freaking delicious!  The 'Silencio' taco with duck tongue and rambutan was another delicious 'fusion' dish that I feel doesn't get enough credit because drunken bimbos that wander in here after a night at the Marquee aren't going to try 'duck tongue.'  The lamb dumplings were very interesting and satisfying as well, as they tasted like baby lamb empanadas with a baked cheese crust.

As far as drinks go, you have to try the Margarita con 'Sal de Gusano.'  It will be hard to ever go back to a traditional salted rim ever again, I am in therapy about it now that I'm gone.

My girlfriend & I went on two occasions in our three days at the Cosmo and this was our favorite place.  We did the tasting menu at Scarpeta and loved that as well, but this was the kind of place I could eat at twice a week.  The service was also fantastic and enough has been mentioned here about how cool the design is inside also.

Highly recommend this place for people that know what good dim sum is, know what good Mexican is and are open to trying the new and interesting as well!",oHf5AekLSw8yMsV-osHxSQ,1,1,5,_9RXqzpnRBO4W4Vlu6DJfA

I sat at the bar and received great service...friendly, attentive, and overall well done. I ordered two dishes: Shrimp Mojo and the Sunfish ceviche. Both were awful -- the Shrimp Mojo was covered in a black garlic sauce swimming in vinegar. I took the advice of my server and ate it with the warm corn tortillas...those cut the sauce enough for me to eat it. The service size was generous enough -- there were eight large shrimp, but the sauce ruined any fresh flavor from the seafood. The sunfish ceviche was not ceviche -- rather it was super fresh fish (yum!) drowning in fresh lime juice. The whole point of ceviche is to allow it to marinate long enough that the acid from the lime juice breaks down the fish...still sharp, but more mellow. It was difficult to choke down...again saved by the tortillas and the blob of guacamole at the bottom of the bowl.",n1DyL17mf4M4QJqmUVLnQg,0,0,2,W3FTxvDv2zyuLIELVXIeXw

To start with, I always order a drink with Tuna Ceviche. I have eaten Scallop Ceviche, but tuna is way better than scallops, I think.

I would recommend the Chinese inspired taco, Viva China. They are very tasty. Fish taco was really good, too.

For dim sum, I recommend ""when pigs fly"", its a BBQ pork buns. Delicious (its a bit sweet side, tho).

All the sui mai is very good. Gold leaf on Sui Mai??? Funny but they are good.

However, noodles in the lower price range, Kao Lao Lao and Dan Dan Mian are my least favorite. The taste is flat - too greasy and boring. I dont recommend. I guess you get what you pay for.

2829225,2012-09-07,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"You know how when you go to a gas station and pay using a credit/debit card before pumping gas? And you know how the gas station ""pre-charges"" you for a certain amount to guarantee you can actually pay for those 21 gallons of gas your gas-hog vehicle guzzles up? You know how those ""pre-charges"" are immediately returned to your account once you complete your gas purchase? Well, China Poblano treats its customers' like gas pumpers at the good ol' Gas 'n' Goods.

Hold on. Let me back up and write a review for the actual dining experience before I get into the real reason for my 1-star review.

My actual dining rating is probably closer to a 3-star in terms of food taste and ambiance. I had eaten at China Poblano before, while on a date. The food was good and the drinks were well made. I didn't care at the time what the prices were because my date insisted I get whatever I wanted. So the overpriced menu wasn't an issue until my return visit with friends. 

During my return visit I chose items a little more conservatively. Only one cocktail, some guacamole and some duck something-or-other. My total bill including the automatic tip of 20% (for parties of 6+) was only $39. Not bad at all really, even though I realized I should have just ordered twice as much guacamole and skipped the duck-whatever. I LOVE duck and always order it when it makes it onto a menu. This wasn't watery-mouth duck. It was over-cooked, barely-recognizable duck. The food isn't so amazing that I would suggest it for large groups in which only one person pays. It is more of a cute place for a date or a place for a group of friends who are paying separately. It isn't even really a fusion restaurant, per se, so if you are craving Mexican or Chinese you should probably just go to the restaurant you crave.

A fusion restaurant usually makes it a point to FUSE two types of cuisine into one dish. This restaurant merely offers items from two different cuisines in separate sections.

Anyway, the restaurant is cute. The decor is different. The only chairs that have backs to them are the booths. The servers are lazy. Oh wait, what's that? Lazy servers at an overrated restaurant that serves undersized and overpriced food? No way!

Now for a better explanation of why this restaurant went from a 4-star on my first visit to a 1-star on my second/third visit:

After my friends and I ate our meal and paid for the meals individually with our debit/credit cards, we spent the rest of the night enjoying some Mario Kart in the room and some hot-tub lounging because well, we were staying in Vegas a full week and this was already night #5. It seemed like a great night all around.

Then when we woke in the morning, one of my friends decided to check his account charges on his phone app. He panicked when he saw that China Poblano had charged an extra 30%. He too had paid $39 including tip and suddenly had a $51.70 charge. Granted, that wasn't an insane amount of money. Only $11.70. However, when you consider that the total bill for the table was over $200, that 30% upcharge now looks more like a hefty $60+ charge spread out over all of our accounts. We all checked our accounts and since we have all been servers in restaurants before and realize that sometimes shady/desperate servers like to add-on a little extra tip and hope that no one notices, we stormed over to China Poblano determined to fix the issue and get our money back into our accounts. We at least wanted a genuine apology.

When we arrived at the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager about the extra charge, the hostess stated ""Oh, yeah we get this all the time."" Ummmmm, what? You get this complaint all the time?

Well, the manager explained to us that the [cheap ass] credit card processing company they use temporarily charges an extra 20-30% for transactions to guarantee that the funds are available. JUST LIKE A GAS STATION. The only difference is, at a gas station you are pre-paying for something in which the final price is unbeknownst to you until you are done pumping. At a restaurant (especially when the tip is included in the bill) you know exactly how much you are paying right then and there when you sign the receipt. The server then enters it into the computer and there is no more need for any extra charges. 

We tried to explain to her that this is the ONLY restaurant that we have ever encountered that has such ridiculous practices. Not only do they give their customers a small panic attack when they check their account balances (imagine if you were someone who went to a special dinner and reluctantly threw down $500 for a nice dinner out with your family and when you look at your account there is a charge for $650 instead) BUT ON TOP OF THAT they don't seem to think it is a big deal or let customers know of this extra temporary charge ahead of time. On top of all that, the manager was very condescending, smug and without an apologetic bone in her body.",FpTuy9U92NKcr9YI__TT1g,4,0,1,Ro616DGCkre1CDJ6t6ESnw

Guacamole - absolutely DELICIOUS. even in a to go container, I can taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. As well as the freshly fried tortilla chips. 

Traditional Sui Mai - a little different from actual traditional Sui Mai but still delcious none of the less. 

Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich - No comment. Because I never received this with my order and I'm truly upset about it. 

After receiving my food, I grabbed by bag and rushed back to Venetian as I had to get ready for the night. When I reached my hotel, I opened by bag and I only had those 2 out of the 3 items that I ordered. Frustrated, I called the restaurant back and spoke to the ""manager"" on duty. (5:10PM, Saturday, December 17, 2016)

He asked if I wanted to come back and get my sandwich but I told him I was all the way at Venetian and it would be a major inconvenience to go back. So he offered to give me a refund so long as he spoke with the person who gave me my order. However he told me that said employee had already finished and left their shift. I asked what was the appropriate thing to do and he said he'd call me back tomorrow after talking to said employee. So he took my number. 

The next day came and absolutely no phone call whatsoever. On top of that, I still paid for the sandwich. 

I understand that the restaurant is busy but taking a costumers money without giving them their complete order is practically fraud. As a costumer, I deserve better than this. I hope that others who come to enjoy this restaurant receive better than this because from what I had, the food is great. The customer service however (be it a one time mistake) was not.

2885135,2011-08-19,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I came here for dinner on a weeknight because I was intrigued by the venue and concept.  The first thing I noticed was that the prices seemed quite high for Chinese/Mexican food, but this was the Cosmopolitan, so not surprising.  We had a combination of Chinese and Mexican Food which was good, but really nothing special.  What really surprised me was the disjointed service.  All of our food was brought out piecemeal.  My girlfriend ordered two tacos and my buddy and I eached orded a soup dish.  My girlfriend got one of her tacos brought to her first.  Then she sat there and waited for my buddy and I to get our food, one at a time, several minutes apart.  Then my girlfriend's second taco came.  Bringing out the food piecemeal would make sense if it was a family-style meal, but I think it was pretty clear we each ordered our own dish.

The kicker was that we ordered chips and salsa, and didn't get it until we were almost done with our dinner, and then only after I asked about it.  The waitress was very friendly and pleasant, but this restaurant was just kind of off this night.

I think a restaurant that charges these kinds of prices for this kind of food needs to compensate by offering something unique, whether it be service, a special venue, etc.  I just didn't see it here, and there are way too many other great dining options in Vegas.  I'm glad I tried it, but will probably not go back.",I8nXQrK1paWqG3eJfUQfeQ,1,0,2,v3iz1FMX0Fn0Diogb626iA

The concept of combining Mex and Chinese is an interesting one... but it is not reflected in the menu. I was hoping for something along the lines of Chifa (Chinese-Peruvian -- check out my review for Little Dumpling), which really blends the flavors of otherwise dissimilar foods... unfortunately, ""never the twain shall meet"" rings true at this resto. The menu was divided into several sections, making clear that Chinese was separate and distinct from the Mexican options. SIGH. Service was very good (it was a nice touch that the manager introduced herself to us; and our waitress was very enthusiastic), except for the server who, while squeezing orange on a lovely fruit salad we ordered, shot both my man and me with the orange juice and seeds (and didn't both to say sorry!) while squeezing the orange over the salad. The only delights were the fruit salad; the fried fish taco; and the shrimp mole. Disappointments were: the pomegranate salt-air margarita (WAY too tart); the tuna ceviche (again, WAY too much lemon); the lobster taco (lobster was entirely too tough); and the lemon-pepper shrimp (the lemon-pepper sauce made me gag).

I mean I know this is Vegas but this charge for white rice definitely takes the cake. Especially when rice doesn't come with the saucy entrees (like mapo tofu) - how do they expect someone to eat these kinds of dishes without rice?

Overall, I thought the entrees were overpriced given their extremely small size, and the flavors were just okay (not fantastic). My parents thought the food overall was just really salty.

I don't eat a lot in general, but even I thought my portion of food was really small. My dad ordered dan dan noodles and while the flavor overall was not too bad (although a tad bit salty), the bowl was only filled halfway with noodles. I ordered the cold sesame noodles and received a similar portion size. The flavor overall was okay but I definitely didn't feel full.

For the gua bao they only give you one and charge you $8.99 for one very small gua bao about the size of a McMuffin. In most places they usually give you two gua bao.

The mapo tofu portion wasn't terribly large but still really saucy. It didn't come with rice as I mentioned earlier, so your very small entree really costs like $15+ 

The hongos taco only came with one taco (really expensive) but my sister said it was good. It was just incredibly small and overpriced.

2927332,2012-07-11,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. The service was very attentive, but I felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. Our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. I honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied. 

Guacamole ($15): Although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. There were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something I could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. The only thing that I didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. It was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.

Large pot of Jasmine Downy Pearls ($8.88) - Very aromatic and tasty. I would probably come here just for the tea.  

Chips and salsa ($4): I hardly touched the salsa, but I ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. Definitely worth the four bucks.

Pescado Frito ($6.50): Not very flavorful and not very ""fried."" If I'm going to pay $6.50 for ONE taco, I expect it to be pretty damn good. 

Dancing Eggplant ($9.88) - The waitress seemed a little reluctant when we ordered this. She made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. I had the feeling she didn't like that at all. We thought it was just okay.

Traditional Sui Mai ($13.88): I really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the Sui Mai. The edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. 

Don't Be Jealous (Hot and Sour Soup) $8.88: This was the most disgusting Hot and Sour soup I have every had. It seriously ruined my palette. The whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. I have NEVER tasted Hot and Sour soup like that before. I couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. Don doesn't even like Hot and Sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. 

Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich ($8.88): Way too salty and saucy. And for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it. 

Jericalla ($11) - Have you ever had Abuelita Hot Chocolate? It comes in a package like this: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/abuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: http://beautifulspitup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cut-abuelita.jpg. Well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of Abuelita Hot Chocolate: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V1zh1nc2VASkoNUsyJS5JA/l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. I felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. I mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but I couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. Plain and simple, it sucked. 

Overall, I loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. The Hot and Sour soup really killed it for me. The only thing I think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something I would drive over here for.

Warning: If you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to ""pre-authorize"" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears.

I started out with a fish taco. It cost over $6.00 and was slightly bigger than a street taco. The taco seemed very freshly made but.......the fish taco was too acidic for my taste and sort of flat tasting. This taco was made with a very fresh tasting but very thin corn tortilla that got soggy and fell apart.  It wasn't bad just not yummy. 

I sort of fell for the hype about the 20 vegetable fried rice. This dish was featured on Food Network TV's Show, ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate.""

Total lunch bill for 2 , 1 beer: $70, ( really a lot for the tiny portions)

A brunch menu and regular menu, we ordered something from both menus.

Chinese noodle soup with eggs, pork and veggies., it's one of the bigger portion choices on the menu, it was meant for sharing, it tasted very very bad, we didn't know what kind of food was that.... Definitely not Chinese! 

Traditional ShuMai: 6 tiny pieces with some gold stuffs on top of each one. They looked fancy but tasted disgusting.....I think they dipped all of those in soy sauce and dried them up....Extremely salty....

Chicken Ji song: 4 tiny chicken lettuce wraps with fried potatoes on the top, they were OK 

Mexican grilled chicken taco: I don't think I have ever had a taco that tasted so bad, most disgusting flavor ever! They put some sort of salty Chinese sauce or paste with green onions on top, those things just don't mix! Think chef confused it with a traditional Chinese wrap dish. 

If we weren't super hungry, I don't think we could have had even swallowed the food, they were soooo bad! Honestly it's a shame to a celebrity chef, Jose should've just sticked to Spanish tapas, forget about Chinese and Mexican food!

It looked promising.  We were expecting a little fancy schmancy for the meal, price-wise and portion-wise, but we were in for a shock.  Extremely pricey for extrememely small protion sizes.  I understand the whole tapas concept, but these tapas were barely enough for one person to share with himself, let alone TWO whole people.  We ordered the scallop ceviche, which unbeknownst to us, was deconstructed.  I believe it was a $16 plate consisting of 4 parboiled baby scallops, like a large bay scallop (think: size of a little bouncy ball you get in a quarter machine), each sitting on a half key lime, sprinkled with what looked like paprika on top.  It tasted like a parboiled scallop sitting on top of a dry lime, sprinkled with something flavorless on top.  I cringed as I ate each scallop, thinking this was SOOO not worth $4, even for Vegas, ESPECIALLY for Vegas.  Next came carnitas tacos.  2 tiny street size tacos, which i will admit were very tasty, but again, very tiny, not filling at all.  At this point we were dying.  Then came the pork siu mai to save the day.  I believe these were one of the cheaper menu items, but it had twice as much food as our first 3 plates combined.

When the waiter hands you that collectable little aluminum bottle of Diet Coke, you have just learned that refills aren't going to be free. Get ready for lIttle dinky mini-soft tacos and little everything, all tasty, but again, you end up paying.

i was so shocked that it was only ONE carnita for that price..dont get me wrong..it was pretty damn good. but DAMN, seriously?  i ordered their hot and soup since our waitress did say their plates do run small and now i know why she meant by small ..she meant quantity. (hence the ONE carnita!) she did also say it is a sharing type of dining experience but how am i supposed to share with that one carnita and a med size bowl of hot and sour soup?!?!

my bf ordered their mole carnita and yes it was small and there was only one. my guy can eat and i dont know why i was more dissapointed than he was lol. you guys can tell i was hungryyy and my fattyass side was showing. he also ordered their street pork sandwich which was $10...and it was a the size of a mini and i mean MINI pancake.....i even said...""are you serious??"" 

service was good, a little too invasive and too pushy for me..probably it was b/c our waitress was training but it was little bit too much..always trying to talk to us when we were eating..trying to make us buy more small size entrees...i totally get what they are trying to do but girl i gotta eat in peace!!

our bill was $30 for those 2 carnitas, 1 small ass sandwhich and a bowl of hot and sour soup. 

i personally wouldnt try this place again bc of the portions and prices but if youre looking for that asian/mexican fusion place...this is it for you.

for food we had the unruly monk wc is a noodle soup dish. nothing crazy. i thought it was alright. we had the  other noodle soup dish with the corn truffles. very interesting, had a good spice to it and loved he corn truffles. we had the twenty vegetable fried rice. pretty good but pretty standard. we also had the nice but naughty bamboo shoot salad. very refreshing. love the heart of palm in it. a little mayonaise-ey at times.

on the mexican side we had the babrbacoa del res tacos. omg the beef was seasoned perfectly. so flavorful and cooked so well. the shrimp mojo was fantastic. perfect spice and had a roasted quality. the like water for chocolate was really interesting too. the lotus flowers were tasty.the sauce was fruity and on the berry side.

for desert we had the flan. very good with slices of roasted pineapples drenched in vanilla bean. and the ginger ice cream was great. i also had tried their sticky mango rice dessert. it is not your typical sticky amngo rice. it is the modern version. it was the deconstructed version.

all in all a great culinary experience with very interesting fusions. a greta menu, from lamb potsitckers to duck tongue! ambiance is great. casual and very fun. could get pricey once you start ordering you just cant stop! u wanna try everything! and it helps that its at cosmopolitan hotel, the best one on the strip right now.",PTbKv5hX3lC9jqwwDfh8rA,2,2,4,TyvyCxl9Sn1BYz3Ryyuojw

Lining the rim of the glass with salt is so last century and China Poblano evolves the drink by making the salt into the foam at the top of the beverage. Let's ignore the food for a second and talk about this.

I'm not a huge fan of margaritas, mostly because the salt/rim/booze/drink ratio is wildly inconsistent. Either I've got a mouth full of salt and a little bit of boozy taste or I'm tasting the margarita with some watered down salt from an area of the glass I've already drank from. Look, I'm a busy guy. I'm too busy to look down at my glass and play rotation monitor with my salt level. As a result, I'm never too pleased with my drink. 

With the invention of the salt air margarita, the salt/drink ratio is perfect every time. I don't need to look away from the person I'm with or my important stock bond real estate portfolio hedge fund papers so that I can assure myself a proper drink. Each sip is engineered to not screw with my ratio. It's great.

We ate practically every meal in the Cosmopolitan (where we were staying) and we were SO pleased with every restaurant we had dined at. Our expectations were high for this one, and we wanted our last night's meal to be special. Alas, it was not.

The restaurant décor was cool, and our waiter was great. After having an amazing meal at Jaleo the night prior, we were really into the ""tapas-style"" of dining, where you get to sample lots of dishes. We were excited to try this Asian-Mexican fusion menu! The first few dishes we ordered, the waiter told us they were out of them that night (ex. Aguachile de Cayo, which I really wanted to try) . So we started with the Beijing Glass noodle dish. The family liked this dish but I found it too spicy (I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness, I freely admit it). The Happy Buddah Vegetable Spring Rolls were the typical fried spring rolls I've had a million times before. Good, but not unique or special in any way. The Palmitos was a strange ""ensalada"": I did not like this dish at all; it was so bitter and had an off after-taste. The kids weren't keen on it either, but hubby said it was ok and he ate it. The family ordered a few other dishes (I forget the names) that were WAY too spicy for me (and a bit too spicy for them as well). 

I hardly ate anything so I asked the waiter, what was the least spicy item on the menu, and I said I did like seafood and fish, and he recommended the Shrimp Mojo. OMG, it was crazy spicy for me, I got rather ill afterwards (I only had one shrimp, too, and I had to scrape off the black peppered sauce). The kids also said it was spicy but they were able to tolerate it ok. Even my hubby, who has a very high spice tolerance, admitted it was quite spicy. 

So either the chef this particular night was super-liberal with the peppers and spice and we just hit this restaurant on an off-night, or this place just serves really spicy food in general. Be forewarned.",NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,0,1,3,vIFTFsV8_XtshLMshIE8cg

I think we were fortunate price-wise and portion-wise; as we came away full and with a relatively inexpensive tab.  Maybe it's because I wanted to save my drinks for the great bartenders at Chandelier, or because we weren't that full to begin with.  Nonetheless, we spent less than what we were prepared to spend, which is always good.

This place is not a Chinese/Mexican fusion.  It's primarily a menu with Chinese items and Mexican items.  The pozole soup was great and had an excellent spice.  The tacos were freshly prepared, I'd recommend the al pastor or the pork belly.  The Chinese menu was somewhat lacking, as if the items were forced on the menu without any great execution of the dishes to fit the theme.

It was pretty rowdy inside, but maybe because I was sitting next to a bachelorette party. I get the feeling it's like that normally. All in all, it was a nice experience, but I think I will stick to ordering from the to-go window.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,3,1,3,Kk7aYW-98IVGKVjEtvTiYA

From the mediocre guacamole to the over salted mojo shrimp most things were edible but just not that good. The chicken wings were so small they had to come from Cornish game hens.

Besides their intimate connections to communism and controversial personal lives, they also both appear as projected photographic wall art at China Poblano.

China Poblano has a fresh concept, delicious food that mixes quality ingredients with creative combinations, and an artistic urban atmosphere.

If you come alone, sit at the bar, it's communal and gives you a peek into the kitchen with cooks demonstrating their skills.  If you come with a group, sit by the wall with exhibits of colorful Chinese masks and Mexican figurines, which appear surprisingly similar when displayed together, (these tables also have cushioned benches that are much more comfortable than the ones under photographs of Mao & Frida).

Everything is tapas style, we discovered about 2 items per person is a good amount of food.  Scallop dumplings are very tasty and served in authentic bamboo steamers.  I also love the Dan Dan Mian, wheat noodles in a spicy ground pork sauce.  Hot & sour soup has real content, not just broth.  But my favorite is the Singapore Sling, their signature cocktail.  It's very good gin paired with pineapple juice that they make in house plus other delicious things that come together for a fabulous concoction.

Hostess was really nice and made us a reservation for later that night. We did have to wait a little bit for our table when it didn't look particularly crowded later on when we came back, but nothing to really complain over. 

Service: was good. nothing extremely noteworthy but I felt like they checked in on us frequently enought and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. Our waiter sugessted some of his favorites and overall I think the service was nice. 

Cocktails: I had the Lemon Drop which is a ""noodle"" inspired cocktail that comes with chopsticks. I didn't love it and for $12 a pop I wanted to love it. After a few sips the noodles got to be annoying and it was a little too sweet for my taste and I like sweet. 

Food: we ordered some appetizers. Got the lamb potstickers Stuck on You. I liked them but I wish the lamb had a bit more flavor to it. Needed more seasoning of some sort. For my entree I got the Ocean Nest which is scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables. Heads are on the shrimp so if that freaks you out its good to know before hand. I really loved the broth of the dish and the whole thing all together, but it was really difficult to eat.

To top it off, our server Corrine rarely checked our table and we waited about 30 minutes before we could flag her down to pay for our bill. The kitchen staff operates differently and they bring out your food as it is ready so if you want your group to eat together, half of your food will be cold.

To begin with this place is socially oriented. What I mean is that you sit with strangers most of the times. In addition to this, plates are meant to be shared. To reinforce this, they will tell you at the beginning that each dish is prepared at different stations that do not operate as a unit, which means that plates will come out at different times. The venue is simply amazing.

We ordered dumplings and queso fundido. Both were delicious. The dumplings were a bit of an acquired taste as the ingredients were a bit out of our normal range, but the meat was cooked beautifully. The queso was rich and also very ""authentic.""  Our friends ordered angel hair pasta which was absolutely delicious. 

The plates are so small and delicate that you really just taste a little bit, good, but just a little bit.

We got a guacamole and vegetable fried rice for the table. The guac was good but the vegetable fried rice was just lame. The veggie fried rice at my local Chinese food restaurant is 10x better (and 10x less expensive!). I also got the fish tacos at $6.95 per taco which were very unspectacular and kind of soggy. All in all came out to $160 for 3 people (one guy was still hungry) without drinks. Would definitely not recommend.,tMrFi4iLcktbL0xtQb2gwg,0,0,1,VBSXXXxWWSDfFffG1wdEfA

The cochinita tacos are amazing- and there are very few places that you can get this specific type of meat. The servers are always nice. We've never had any dishes off of the Chinese side of the menu- so no comment there, but the Mexican food is amazing. (And husband is Mexican so he would know).

It's a blend of Mexican and Chinese, which definitely worried my wife and I at first. I got the tasting menu with the drink pair and was very pleased.

The drinks were very unique, you need to have an open mind and like all kinds of alcohol for this one. I enjoyed all 4, but I think for two, a sample was enough. The whiskey one I could drink all night.

3162972,2011-03-02,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"While wandering around looking for a place to eat, my friends and I stumbled upon China Poblano.  Once someone pointed out to me that it is a Jose Andres restaurant, I knew I had to try it.  Although I didn't think it was his best, I enjoyed every dish I had for one reason or another.

Like most of his restaurants, China Poblano is more of a tapas-style place in that they serve up smaller plates intended to be shared amongst a group.  Eating in this manner, I was able to try three different dishes. The first were the lamb pot stickers which were small in size, but surprisingly filling.  I enjoyed the ""crispy lace"" (in essence, extra fried bits from the pan, which is never a bad thing) and thought they were well made, but overall didn't find them different enough from anything I've had before.  On the other hand, the two types of tacos I tried were both tasty and very original.  The Viva China taco has soft beef tendon, Kumamoto oyster, and a touch of a slightly spicy sauce on top.  The oyster was the real standout here, as the softness of it complemented the texture of the tendon, while the natural saltiness of it really added a punch to the dish.  The other taco I tried was the Pancita al Pastor, which is slow-cooked pork belly and pineapple.  If you know me, you know I love pork belly, so this was a big winner.  The saltiness of the tender pork belly balanced so well with the sweetness of the pineapple and made for a great dish.

We also ordered some drinks.  I shared the cold ""tea"" for two, which was a mixture of green tea, tequila, and beer.  The presentation was nice, as it comes out in a tea pot and is served in a couple nice glasses, but flavor was a bit off.  Although I found it a refreshing drink, I thought they added a bit too much lemon to it and wished there was more of a green tea flavor.  Another friend ordered the lemon drop ""soup,"" a lemon vodka drink with lemon ""noodles"" made out of a gelatin-like substance.  It also seemed very refreshing, and the ""noodles"" were an interesting touch.

Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch at China Poblano.  Although it was a little expensive for a normal lunch, spending $25 to share 3 dishes and a drink at a Jose Andres restaurant seemed pretty reasonable.  Although it wasn't quite good enough to break into 4 star territory (felt like more of a 3.5 to me) I would definitely recommend checking it out if you are a fan of his, or if you are just looking for something different to try.",MlrfB4bA9lDx8O3dnIBpcg,0,0,3,mNRtje8ZeZjkqTohthRr-w
3168540,2014-03-21,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I am very turmoiled about this place. I've seen it several times and my guitar instructor/friend has been here 5 times and loved it every time. I had big expectations. 

Thursday night, the middle of the Pac 12 tournament week around 9 o'clock in the evening. Not too crowded but people were scattered around the edges of the restaurant. With all the room in the restaurant, we end up sitting at a table against a wall nestled in between about 4 other tables a super tight sardine type squeeze. 

Our red headed male waiter did not come around for awhile, but we watched him attend to the table directly to the right of us and a few tables left of us. I kind of felt like we were playing that childhood game, Red Rover, wondering if I was ever going to get picked and the anticipation was killing me! I just wanted to order. 

He finally comes over with his rehearsed speech. Yes, my hubby and I order margaritas, and then he disappears for a long time again before we get to order food.

Fast forward sometime later.. The guacamole and chips, hubby's choice, make their appearance first. Very good stuff. Not mind blowing but definitely worth a try!

I enjoyed my ""air"" foam topped margarita and my chili pepper spicy margarita. I had one of the most unique tacos I ever had - a duck tongue - lychee corn tortilla taco. Although I really enjoyed the duck taco, I definitely liked the beef lengua taco more since the duck tongue taco was too unique for my tastes. I also loved the Hao Gao dim sum - the insides combined pork and shrimp when its usually just shrimp. Very tasty stuff. The six pieces disappeared in my tummy quickly!

I also ordered a carnitas taco, but it never came out. I inform the waiter of this and he said I never ordered it. I could have sworn that I did. What happens next? We receive our check, and the carnitas taco was on the bill! The supposed taco that I never ordered! I think the manager noticed my dejected look. He came over and asked us if we were okay and we told him what happened. Our waiter never returned but the manager helped make the correction on the bill and sincerely apologized. 

My summary: Food very interesting! Manager and hostess very friendly and nice. Waiter - I think you were having an off day or honestly forgot about us. You probably were tired or overworked and were ready to be done with the day. We had come in from a long road trip and just wanted to relax and have drinks and food. It was just a bad date between us and the restaurant that night.",eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA,8,4,2,AGu3a6LYvnm_De7JZkzy4g
3173214,2012-08-09,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I honestly don't even want to give this place ONE STAR. I was there this past weekend.. the girls and I are all STARVING after the pool party at Marquee and we wanted some food pronto. This was right there when we were walking out and we thought it was Chinese fast food. Yannoe? Something quick and yummy and hopefully, cheap. Boy were we wrong on ALL of that! I guess I should have been alarmed that this place serves BOTH Chinese AND Mexican food? Hmm... 

Anyways, we walked in, got seated, and checked out the menu. Everything was pretty expensive, but since we were already seated, we decided to just go with it. We ordered 3 hot and sour soups, 2 noodles, and 1 fried rice.. TRUST ME when I say this because I'm not exaggerating when I say that EVERYTHING TASTED DISGUSTING -- keep in mind that I have not eaten in 8 hours and cup noodles would have tasted heavenly.. But no, the food was completely nasty and they got a little vinegar happy on all our dishes. Not only were the food gross, but the portion was TINY. The waitress even said that you'd have to order 2-3 dishes per person to even be full. Really?

After what seemed like days for our food to come out, we decided to cancel the fried rice. We wanted to pay, get the hella outta there, and find some REAL FOOD. Our bill came out to $90ish dollars. It was ridiculous how BAD this place is. Nasty food, tiny portions, overly priced.. need I say more?

But yeah.. Keep in mind that this review is more for their Chinese menu, but I will not be back to find out how their Mexican food tastes like. Please save your money and go to the Panda Express down the street if you want Chinese.

The concept of serving Mexican and Chinese food in the same restaurant is intriguing and in an odd way, works extremely well. No matter what dish you end up ordering, the food is definitely good. That's where my two stars come from. So A+ on the food and even the unique decor. 

The service though... oh man the service. Quite horrendous. First, we had a 20 minute wait for a table, but when our name was finally called we were sat at the bar (apparently bar is not self-seating here, but requires a host to seat you here). My boyfriend and I like sitting across from each other during meals, so felt a little odd to be next to each other, but nonetheless, it didn't bother us much as it was kind of fun to sit up where we could experience the action of the bartender and tortilla chef first-hand. We started off by ordering a drink each and an order of chips and salsa (which I must say, considering 95% of Mexican restaurants give chips & salsa for free, this was a little pricey here). They weren't bad, but I have had better elsewhere. We then ordered 4 tacos (2 tacos each). About 20 minutes after ordering, 1 taco was delivered. Where the other 3 were, we had no idea. We asked the bartender, who was also our waiter, and he had no idea either. He went to the kitchen to check and came back to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. About another 20 minutes passed by, and 2 more tacos were delivered. We were still missing the 4th and questioned where that one may be. Finally, another 10 minutes later, the 4th and final taco had been delivered. This long wait for 4 measly tacos was just ridiculous to me. The bartender did try to help, but it fell a little short. He could not offer to compensate us for the drinks we've already ordered, but he did tell us we could each order one more drink and those would be on the house, so we took up his offer and ordered 2 more drinks.We then got our check, paid and left, dissatisfied, and still very hungry. 

The next day, my boyfriend noticed that the amount charged on his card was more than was on the initial bill. They ended up charging him for the 2 ""on the house"" drinks. This issue has still not been resolved.

On the outside, you can order food at the ""take out"" windows (left is Chinese, right is Mexican). The type of food you get is made in that specific kitchen so everything comes out at different times. The interior decor was just as good as the outside. Mad props to the decorator. 

ALSO, came with a group of 12 without a reservation, though the place was busy they managed to seat us in 5 minutes on a Saturday. The service inside was just as good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable.

Pretty much everything here is made to share, with the exception of the tacos. They suggest that each person have 2-3 plates to themselves. If you eat a lot like me and are on a budget, this place isn't for you or maybe just get a taco.

Highlights:
*Canitas Taco $5.50 - pretty good but was oily
*Mongolian Beef Lettuce $18.88 - type of meat they used was great, lettuce was good with the sauce. Highly suggest this dish.
*Pozole Rojo with a shot of reposado tequila $15 (w/out shot $12) - they tell you to add the shot to the pozole but I suggest you don't and just take the shot straight. Some people liked it in the soup, and others didn't
*Dan Dan Mian $12.88 - not bad/pretty average.
*Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice $19.88 - really good! You can add meat for an additional price but it's great the way it is

I really had a lot of hope for this place, but was sadly disappointed.  

We had to make reservations as apparently this place gets pretty packed.  It is located outside of Marquee and next to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Reading some yelpers and also having followed Chef Jose Andres and his accomplishments, we figured we'd give this place a try.  The place was jammed packed on a Saturday night, and did have to wait a few minutes, but it allowed us to see the decor of the place which I really did love.  It's a Mexico meets China fusion restaurant which is a very interesting concept and worked out well, sort of...

The various tacos were great, I would say this is the highlight of the place.  Definitely a fusion of flavors and not your run in the mill choices - worth n order or two.  The other tapas were ok, some better than others but no where near the chef's best - after ordering them, we sat there thinking hmm, should I have just gotten a taco or two more instead?  The drinks were inventive: salt air margarita (salt foam on top) and lemon drop with jelly noodles (looks like chicken noodle soup).  The margarita was hard to say the least.  Strong salt in your face followed by a heavy handed (strong) margarita - was pretty hard to drink.  Then tasting the lemon drop (w/jelly noodles) was hard to sip in itself.  More like a soup than a drink, and strong yet again.  I thought it would be an alcoholic boba-ish drink, but it came up very short of those expectations.  All in all, for some tacos, its a great place, but anything else, maybe hit up Holstein's next door and grab a drink at the chandler bar before marquee.",Qdqhuz60PTdSsIjJk2_TXg,0,0,2,nPSZtKD2Zqcup47rde7ajg

I'm not picky so I figure why not let the staff send out the best that the menu has to offer! Every dish was absolutely delicious. A few of the dishes I tried included the chilaquiles, golden pigs, all the siu mai, tuna ceviche and for the kill.......PALMITOS!!!! Everything is certainly worth trying but the palmitos....I simply do not have words to describe how perfect it was. It was so fresh and the flavors combined seamlessly to create a delectable bite every single time!

Dessert was also fantastic, though by the time we got it, I was pretty full so I couldn't finish either of them and I cannot remember their names. It was a grapefruit one, and another one with a coconut whipped cream and chocokrispies!!! I think I'll eat less food next time to save more room for dessert! 

The staff was attentive and knowledgable! Our server, Josue, checked on us throughout the meal and chatted for a bit here a there, not intrusive at all, which can be hard combination for a server to nail down when you're in full blown girl talk at a table!  The cocktails were also wonderful. I am hesitant to drink tequila or mezcal due to previous unfavorable encounters but I left feeling very happy! The manager, Edgar (tall, dark and handsome btw ladies!) touched the table, which I love seeing at restaurants because it simply completes the experience!  I am looking forward to going back very soon to try everything else that I didn't get around to this time, however I will have the palmitos every single time!

The cocktails (margaritas are topped with salted air which were refreshing and unique) and beers were spot on and the service polished and sharp. However the overpriced food was hit and miss. Sui mai should be avoided (weird spongy texture and off tasting) as well as the weird tasting Dan Dan Mian and the ugly Dancing Eggplant. 

Bright spots were the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice (awesome), Unruly Monk, Guacamole, Rou Jia Mo Sandwich and the Queso Fundido. Tacos are 2 bites and are $5.50 for one which I couldn't swallow the price tag so we skipped the tacos. Bill was $240+ tip for 3 people.

We ordered the $12 guac which was pretty much like guac anywhere they make it fresh, so the price was a bit crazy.  The house-made tortillas were fine, but not mouthwatering buttery softness like when I make them which is weird cause I just use Maseca...

The shrimp mojo was the best item we ordered though I thought the shrimp had a very strong aftertaste.  The combo of sweet garlic, poblano, and onion was good though

The spring rolls were fried so in my world that would be an eggroll. Either way the veggie mixture inside was less than average in taste.  The flavor is indescribable except that I would not ever order them again.

The refried beans with cheese and crema (less than a spoonful) came out looking like a turd on a plate.  Even the waiter laughed when we looked  at it.  They were not worth 7 bucks but it was average.

And finally the Glass noodle dish.  I ordered it to be my main course.  It was cold, which was nowhere in the description, which was a disappointment to me because the restaurant itself was freaking Antarctica.  Besides the initial disappointment, the flavor was not great, salty and over-bearing sauce drowned the veggies. 

The portions are very small as well.

The waiters kept bringing food to our table that wasn't ours and then looking at us like we were crazy when we explained we didn't order anything like that (mostly it was tacos and later a soup\...wtf?)

The meal started off great. The chips and house made guacamole were really good. I couldn't stop eating the chips. Sodium was a absolute treat tonight. I could definitely taste all this good stuff.

Each of the dishes, served tapas style, was definitely small and probably meant to be shared. I had the six dishes below. Most of them lacked flavor. Maybe it was the chef's off night. The best dishes though were definitely the Shrimp Mojo and the Gan Pung Ji chicken wings.

The Shrimp Mojo - Not the most appealing to look at, but each piece was delectable. We should of just ordered more of this.

Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice - At the very least, taste like something, please!

Dan Dan Mian - What exactly am I eating? There's so little pork that I only taste wheaty noodles and peanut sauce.

Chicken Ji Song - This looked like it was going to be good, if only we were able to find where the chef had hidden all the flavor.

Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos - The grilled hanger steak, another dish that looked great, but alas, it too suffered from blanditis.

The Gan Pung Ji chicken wings - The only other dish worth ordering. So tasty...and so spicy too.

We looked around on the second and floor and ended up walking into a restaurant that had Mexican food on one side and Chinese Dim Sim on the other.  So we thought hey, here's the food court! Let's go grab a seat. We get seated by a host and thought it was weird that a food court had a host..then we get handed a menu, only then did we realize that this place wasn't a food court, it was a full on restaurant!  At that point I think we both debated if we should leave, but in the end we decided to stay and give it a shot.

I have to admit once you sit down and look at the place and you see the Dim Sum station vs the Mexican grill, its very foolish that we couldn't figure out that this place was something different; and it sure was.

The Mexican-Chinese fusion food they have here is something I have never experienced in my whole life.  And that's actually pretty surprising considering I grew up in San Jose, CA where there is an abundance of Chinese Restaurants surrounded by Mexican Restaurants in the Eastern Part of the city.  Well we get cracking and I remember I had a few orders of dim sum and a few tacos.  I had no idea that gourmet dim sum and tacos could exist..let alone exist in the same restaurant!  The fusion food will keep you coming back for more, I know that from now every time I'll go to Vegas (which seemingly appears to be every 6 months) I'll be making a stop at this tasty little restaurant!

-When Pigs Fly (steamed BBQ pork buns) were OK but nothing special especially when a $1.99 dim sum item is inflated to $11.88... Even the local gourmet Food Truck in SF charges half the price but produces better quality.

-Sui Mai yielded the same result as the buns however at an increased cost of $12.88

3333566,2017-06-28,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I went for Restaurant Week 2017.  When restaurants give you a tasting menu to sample their menu during one of these experimental events I always expect to overpay and leave wanting more.  Yes, I will probably experience many of their most popular dishes, but at a minimalistic portion size. This meal was $40 for dinner and 9 courses.

The first few courses were exactly as I expected. I began with a very lackluster jijama-wrapped guacamole that was barely a bite size.  This was followed by a small shumai, although known for, seemed absolutely average.  The dumpling layer is cooked in-house which I respect, but the dish itself wasn't as good as many dumpling houses in the area.  The meals began growing on me though from the two starters forward.

The next dish was the tuna ceviche spoon - absolutely amazing.  I'm not sure how many come in a typical serving, but this dish looked beautiful and tasted even better.  There was so much going on in only a spoon-sized portion.  This was my favorite dish of the night. The next offering was the refreshing palmitos salad closely followed by the chicken taco.  The salad was a very nice palate cleanser with palm and grapefruit and came as in a considerable portion size that would rival a typical salad starter.  The taco was cooked very well, with the notorious guacamole that China Poblano is known for, but not a must have.

Next was one of my top choices of the night - the golden pig.  Delicious pork belly filling with a hard bun.  I was expecting more of a steamed bun so I was caught off guard when I was served this bun, but still a very good dish.  The inside was fantastic and the outside with a dessert type of coating was very refreshing.  The final two dishes were the fried rice known across the strip and the shrimp mojo.  The shrimp had a little kick a very nice garlic sauce, but the size was very small.  The fried rice, on the other hand, was two times as large as you'd expect.  20 vegetables (I didn't count but there were a lot) and fluffy sticky rice make this dish a must.  After this meal I took home my leftover rice and easily I can make a meal and a half.  The dish was perfectly cooked and when mixed was perfection.  The night ended with a very tasty ""mango sticky rice"" for dessert, though it seemed more whipped cream than mango.  Good, but I'd rather get full on the main dishes than the dessert.

I really think the Chinese side of China Poblano outshines the Mexican.  Besides the ceviche, I enjoyed the bun and rice options much better.  The prices are high at this restaurant but know that Jose Andres rarely disappoints.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,gQIx85dfJo0anv7zS5OJ4A

I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. 

The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty. 

The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing.

Since my friend and I were starving when we got to the Cosmo, and China Poblano was open, I decided to set aside my reservations and negative associations about Jose Andres restaurants and give it another shot. However, I wasn't surprised when I didn't love the food. Since it was around 2:30pm on a Saturday, there were only a few other tables occupied and we were sat immediately. I tried:

-Carnitas Taco (Braised Baby Pig, Pork Rinds, Spicy Salsa Verde Cruda, $5.50) & Silencio Taco (Duck Tongue, Fresh Lychee, $5.50) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-poblano-las-vegas-2?select=6eXGIf_eU7YK4rt55SedgA#6eXGIf_eU7YK4rt55SedgA]: I enjoyed the carnitas taco a lot more than the duck tongue one. The carnitas taco had good flavor, and the ingredients worked well together. The duck tongue and lychee combination created a slimy texture, and I wasn't a fan of the combination- skip!
-Papas Fritas (Fried Potatoes w/Mole Poblano, Mexican Cream, Queso Fresco, $7, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-poblano-las-vegas-2?select=6eXGIf_eU7YK4rt55SedgA#WqRIXfHzRhF3CnxRCVLazg): The mole sauce was really bland, and the potatoes were limp/soggy. There wasn't much flavor overall in this dish, and I definitely wouldn't order this again.

The worst part about dining here was the service- it was INCREDIBLY SLOW. For a restaurant that is mostly empty, slow service is just unacceptable! Our server disappeared a couple of times, and we had to flag down another random server so that we could get our drinks, check, etc. It also took them over 15 minutes to bring my friend's drink so we ended up just cancelling it- of course, the apologies were sparse at best. I will definitely not be dining here again, and will likely avoid all Jose Andres restaurants in the future.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,0,0,2,CKdBa7ALa35VCPpBMdg6Xg

The drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. They also have a large variety of different mescals. 

This is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. The shrimp mojo and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  The tuna ceviche was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good.

However, China Poblano was absolutely terrible. My husband and I tried items from the Mexican AND the Chinese menu and while the Mexican was slightly better, everything we tried was awful. Everything on the menu is tapas sized, so you are expected to order 3-4 items per person. Luckily we decided to start slow..We had a number of different tacos (lobster, fried fish and mushroom) and all were greasy and tasteless. The guacamole and chips (which was $15!!) was ok. LIttle did we know that it would be the only truly edible thing we ordered! We then decided to try some Chinese items and got some traditional shu mail dumplings and mongolian beef stir fry. The dumplings had a bizarre raw pork flavor to them that was so disgusting that I actually couldnt even swallow the dumpling and the mongolian beef stir fry was completely bizarre... tiny little chunks of grisly beef stir fried with pieces of romaine lettuce?! And then the icing on the cake was the bill.. I know this is Las Vegas and I certainly wasnt expecting a budget dinner, but since we ordered very little food (4 tacos, an order of guac, the dumplings and the beef) and only ordered two agua frescas and no alcohol I was absolutely FLOORED when I saw that the bill was over $100!

Yes, this place is definitely pricey. Newsflash to everyone: EVERYTHING is overpriced in Vegas and if you don't want to spend money, stay home. 

My rating is based on service, selection and quality of food -not price.  

We ordered ""Cold Tea for Two"" that combined the flavors of green tea, tequila, and beer; this was very refreshing and interestingly delicious.  The green tea in it made me feel less guilty about drinking alcohol so early in the day. 

Then we ordered their guacamole served with handmade tortillas -this guac is just like my mom's with generous slices of jalapeños! Best thing about the guac is that they make it to order from this huge mountain of avocados and you can choose how spicy to make it. The Guac was a meal in itself -but I felt like a vegetarian pig and ordered more.  

The vegetable spring rolls were delicious and our waiter was so attentive about my needs that he let me know that the sauce had fish in it and made an alternative soy sauce to dip them into.  I ended up dipping them into that guacamole and felt like I was eating Asian taquitos... 

Then came the ""Setas"" taco made with wild mushrooms on top of MORE GUAC! -supper yummy! My carnivore boyfriend ordered the ""Rou Ji Mo Street Sandwich"" that looked more like a ""gordita"" with carnitas.  He said it was very tasty. 

Yes, there's more... We decided to try their ""Tres Lychees"" dessert that took the concept of a traditional ""Tres Leches"" Mexican cake and added lychees in three different forms: Lychee Ice Cream, Lychee whip cream, and fresh Lychees on top. Perfection!

Second course: Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll - Crispy and jam packed with fresh veggies and noodles. Made-in house and doesn't take like the frozen variety that's sometimes found at restaurants and buffets in this area. Legit.

Third course: Ants Climbing a Tree - Oodles of cellophane noodles galore with sesame seeds, chicken, and bok choy that'll give your taste buds a spicy kick. 

Fourth course: Mango Sticky Rice - This isn't your traditional mango sticky rice dish. The rice and coconut are and blended together to creamy perfection and topped with toasted Rice Krispies.

The Enmolada had very good steak but wished for more tortillas.  The mole was good too.

The Lamb Pot Stickers weren't my favorite.  I was hoping for some nice pieces of grilled lamb but this was more of a gyro type consistency and too mushy.  I love good sliced grilled lamb...

There were a few meals that were definitely family sized including both the 20 vegetable fried rice(a must have) and the noodle/soup dishes. The tacos themselves are very different and each has its own unique taste/texture. Duck tongue taco? Yes please!

There was a problem with one of the dishes and it literally came out about 10-15 minutes after we were done eating so we no longer wanted it.

I was however very disappointed in the XO noodle dish. It was a very small serving with 4 shrimp, one scrambled egg and noodles rolled in balls. Flavor  was very faint. I could have skipped this entirely. They fooled me twice with the mango sticky rice dessert. I had my heart set on traditional mango sticky rice however the rice was not in the dish.

the decor was fun.  a mix of Chinese and Mexican art.  On one wall was a panel of different Chinese opera masks and Mexican art pieces.  The other wall had two large video screens with images of Chinese and Mexican people which changes.  The feel was casual and elegant at the same time.

Our server was Nicole.  She was very courteous, knowledgeable, and gave great recommendations on food.  On her suggestion, we ordered the day's special:  marinated beef skirt steak with poblano peppers.  It was full of flavor.  It tasted better with their homemade guacamole and tortillas.  I also tried the duck tongue taco.  I know it sounds strange, but the flavor was great:  sweet with a crunchy texture of the tongue.  It had a few pieces of lychee fruit on top also.  The scallop ceviche was fun too.  a fresh scallop served on top of a small wedge of lime.  You're supposed to put the scallop in your mouth while squeezing out the lime juice at the same time.  Lastly, the dessert was excellent.  I don't remember the name of the dessert, but it came in a chocolate shell in the shape of a Chinese soldier filled with chocolate mousse served on top of ginger ice cream...very unique.

Overall, a great experience.  It's a fun restaurant.  The main downside is the price.  the dessert itself cost more than any other of the dishes we ordered.  The food is served tapas style, so you only get a small amount per order.

Drinks:
My brother had the Margarita Sal de Gusano which was pretty cool. The salt was a layer of foam floating on the top of the drink instead of on the rim. 
The Lychee Sour was perfect for me. A play on the Pisco Sour, this one had Lychee puree in it.

We were visiting Las Vegas for the night on the way back to New York, and were looking for something that wouldn't break the bank but that would be different than what we can get back home. Vegas is mostly full of the same restaurants as NYC and Miami (I've lived in both) so this was actually a tall task. 

China Poblano came highly recommended by my boss, and I couldn't pass it up since it combines two of my favorite cuisines. 

Drinks: very very good and fairly unique; I liked the salt air margarita and the mezcal negroni best, and highly recommend the $32 cocktail flight so that you can try 4 different ones. They are generous portions and the flight is perfect for sharing.

Food: everything was very good, but my favorites were the 20 vegetable fried rice, and the carnitas taco (great verde sauce). I want to go back to try everything -- so many options and everything on the menu looked amazing.

Service: excellent! The waiter was super knowledgeable and helpful in guiding us through the menu, and everything was very prompt...which was great since we had a flight to catch!

Atmosphere: a very cool vibe. I wouldn't call this place super family friendly, but it's the perfect trendy casual spot. You can go in jeans or be dressed up on your way out for the night!

So come on people..

My rant is over...  After having eaten at China Poblano, which my first José Andrés dining experience, I will likely name my first child after him, then force my child to name their first born after him.  The food and drinks are playful and just flat out phenomenal.  I opened the night with his Salt Air Margarita, which has salt water foam on the top of it rather than a salted rim, and it was hands down one of the best margaritas I've had.  The bartender explained the José developed the idea after he was swimming in the sea and swallowed some salt water, then viola!  To kick off the food, I ordered barbacoa and pescado tacos.  Have you ever had food that is so good that you just smile after eating it?  Well this does just that.  I then switched gears to the China portion of the menu and had When Pigs Fly, which is 4 BBQ pork steam buns.  The buns are light and doughy while the inside is a burst of unbelievable flavor.  Last, but not least, I had to fuse the two worlds, so I had the tuna ceviche, which was an interesting take on the classic by adding soy sauce and roasted amaranth seeds.  

I was convinced the first time here would not be the last, but unfortunately I had scheduled work dinners throughout the week that screwed this plan up.  Luckily, I was able to convince a group to take me here, and the second time was just as good as, if not better than, the first time.

If they opened a food truck that served Carnitas tacos I would follow them around the country getting fatter by the day. Most of our group ordered from the Chinese side of the menu, and everything they ordered was disappointing. The dumplings were tiny and the noodles were flavorless.

The highlight of the meal was the salt air margarita. It is a shaken margarita served with a light airy foam that replaces the traditional salted rim. The salty foam cuts the heavy handed pour of tequila, making it the perfect way to start a night of excess.

I had their signature salt ""air"" margarita. It's not really air, but salty foam that floats on top of your drink. Not only is it super cool and inventive, but it gives you a hint of salt in every sip. Delicious!

Even though Jose Andres, the Spanish chef behind China Poblano, is world renowned, I was curious to see how he'd do Mexican food. I grew up eating Mexican food and am very picky. All my cynicism was gone as soon as I read the menu. The queso fundido, a melted cheese appetizer served by nearly every Mexican restaurant, is made with queso Menonita. Most of you have probably never heard about it, but that's what queso fundido is SUPPOSED to be made with (not Monterey cheese most restaurant use.) To know Chef Andres has it imported from Mexico is really special. 

All the food we tried was great, especially the tuna ceviche. The one thing we had that was kind of blah were the tacos. That's why I'm not giving it five stars. You can find way better tacos in nearly every taco shop at a fraction of the price. Even the $10 lobster taco ($10 for one, little taco) was just okay.

But, I digress. My wife and I stopped by China (pronounced ""chee na"") Poblano after already eating dinner a couple hours earlier. So we only got 2 things. Now, on to the food...

Langosta tacos ($16) - lobster, salsa Mexicana, arbol chile sauce. 2 per order. The lobster was a little tough and the tortilla was too small compared to the amount of filling. The tortilla was also too fragile -- it tore apart as I picked it up to take a bite. They should have doubled up the tortillas for each taco like typical street tacos.

Coctel de camarones ($12) - fresh shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, avocado. It's basically a soup bowl of salsa with a few shrimp and bits of crab meat and avocado thrown in. It's served cold, which I wasn't expecting. If you like fishing out your food from a bowl of salsa, this is the dish for you. I wasn't a fan.

Singapore sling ($11). A delicious cocktail made of gin, brandy, pineapple juice and some other stuff. It goes down a little too easy.

The bottle of coke that my wife ordered was cool. It's hard to screw up Coke.

I stopped in looking for something different for lunch while I was out on the strip and China Poblano did not disappoint.  I sat at the bar on the right side of the restaurant and was quickly presented with a menu.  Service was good, not the best I've had but it was perfectly fine.  The food was outstanding!  

I started with the lotus chips and they were crispy, and uniquely seasoned.  I then got the Lengua taco and the lamb potstickers.  Both of these were also delicious and perfectly seasoned.  Since I had been imbibing at the Diamond Lounge I did not order any drinks.  The food was 5 stars easy, the service was between a 3 and 4, but the prices . . . man it hurt.  Seriously $6 for one taco, and that was it just the taco, and $13 for 5 potstickers?  I know it's the strip but I'd expect these prices up on the third floor of the Cosmo not the second.

They have a separate vegetarian menu & can accommodate vegans and those who don't want eggs. The menus are clearly marked & the staff are well educated on this. They have fresh fruit based drinks (aqua frescas) that change daily - be sure to try them. They guacamole is made fresh right in front of you & was very good. The chips are cooked in the morning in vegetable oil before any meat items are cooked. The spring rolls are very good - not very oily & with a good variety of vegetables. The tacos are unique, soft  wrapped, light & full of flavor. I enjoyed the hongos taco (on the menu last time I came), the taco nopales, & the refried bean taco - all were great & light - they come in orders of one. The chayote salad is a very unique item & was good - it is not your typical green leaf salad, so try it. Finally, the terra cotta chocolate & paloma deserts were very good. Bottom line - great vegetarian food with taste & creativity. The service was very very good. The atmosphere is nice. For a party of 2, I would get 2 tacos, the spring rolls, & the guacamole, adding on another taco or two if hungry, along with the aqua fresca.

3568599,2011-01-09,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I love Oyamel and Jaleo, so I was eager to see Jose Andres' latest creation, and I had really high expectations for China Poblano.  I had this idea that Mexican-Chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, Oyamel and Myers+Chang (a funky pan-Asian restaurant in Boston).  We decided to try the Asian side of the menu at China Poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.

The good: the tuna ceviche was great - the soy sauce did NOT make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that I wouldn't have thought of, and I liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  The monk's noodles had a nice texture, and I was pleasantly surprised by the fried rice - it really distinguished itself from your average fried rice.  As far as drinks go, I had a margarita with sea salt ""foam"" (standard at Oyamel, still tasty here).  The lemon drop with ""noodles"" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  Yes, I bought into the cutesy presentation, and I enjoyed it.

Also good: the service.  The host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  Our waitress had recommended the tuna ceviche to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and I always like candor from the waitstaff.  There was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  The entire staff was very attentive.

The bad: we had the ""when pigs fly"" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  Even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  The same thing goes for the ten treasure noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  It's difficult to get the broth just right (Tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups on your menu.

I'm willing to give China Poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  I will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so I'm not sure when or if I'll be back.  The bottom line is, Jose Andres does a fantastic job with Mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  My visit to China Poblano just left me craving a visit to Myers+Chang and Oyamel.  I didn't take the ceviche and tacos at Oyamel for granted before, but I will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.",T9Rb5sVWzzNd-R9MwiFAYQ,2,0,3,SK1PcdIHpTwG5bo8WyWqJA

Tips:
Ask for their separate vegetarian menu.
I am surprised at the additional array of items they can make for you - not mentioned on menu! All you need to do is tell them your preferences!

Upon greeting us the waitress explained the menu and suggested per person you order a couple of items because the portions are small.  At least she was honest!  The standout items to me were the twenty vegetable fried rice and the Rou Jia Mo street taco.  I had a few other items as there were six of us so we ordered and shared a few dishes.

Since it was a Friday - we got a early preview of a few Bachelor and Bachelorette parties (but they weren't partying together - separately). 

So - what did we have?

Dan Dan Mian - yeah this stuff was pretty good.  Not overly spicy (I could use a kick up) but had good flavors.  

Siu Mai (Lucky 6) - we mixed it up with traditional, scallops and beef.  Tasty - plus gold flakes on them to get you all amped up for Vegas b/c what's Vegas if not flashy.

Then to mix it up - Shrimp Mojo. Mmm mmm.

This place is great when you can't quite decide if you want Mex or Chinese or if you're with someone who wants one or the other.

The service is impeccable every time I go, the small plate food is fresh, delicious and flavorful! It is pricier than other places (welcome to the Las Vegas Strip!) but it's definitely worth every dollar.

I brought my mom to join me for lunch. She makes her own bomb guacamole, yet she craves the guacamole from China Poblano. You know it's gotta be good! Shout out to the hostess for being attentive when seating us, she was gracious in offering another table right away when we weren't too keen on the first (it was tight fit for us lol)

Please please PLEASE try the table side guacamole! Rumor has it the place might discontinue it, and I say keep it! The server makes the guacamole in front of you, and it was to our perfection of taste. I understand it's more difficult to offer this when it's busy, just have a dedicated person to make it on those busy days. It's such a nice touch that makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.

Onto the food: we ordered the chips and salsa with the table side guacamole and When Pigs Fly for our main lunch items. The portions are small, they are small plates after all. But we were left quite satisfied with this. The salsa is made fresh, no heat is added so if you like spicy, let your server know! When Pigs Fly is their take on Chinese pork buns. They're Toby compared to what you get in China Town, but the flavor of the barbecue filling is to die for. Plus, the pork is leaner, not much fat which I like.

We ordered the buñuelos and the mango sticky rice for dessert. These are not made in the typical fashion, so keep an open mind when ordering! I won't ruin the surprise, that's what pics are for anyway. Again, the flavors were so delicious, especially that coffee ice cream.

Samantha was our server and she's the best we've had.

The taco has salsa with a crème that blends together. A friend of mine order this too and said ""I love meat but this taco is SO GOOD."" The chilaquiles was a little more bland for me.

A little too soy for my taste, but it would be a great summer time dish (it's served cold). This was a more hearty dish compared to my taco, tons of vegetables. This one dish could have served 2.

We ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype. They were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something I think a crisp vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed. We also ordered the Beijing Glass noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer. The noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist. More of a side really. It seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor. Since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good. Wrong. The Tinga Poblano was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse. The pork had a bland dipped-in-A1 taste and the onions didn't add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco. The service was terrible. Our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady. The decor was enjoyable and the idea I think is awesome.

However, as a quintessential Angeleno, I much much more prefer fusion rather than those so-called authentic food. And China Poblano is the very reason why: it combines the distinctive taste of both worlds. Plus, it's José Andrés (see my reviews on ""SAAM"" or ""Jaleo!!"") 

So, after BF and I sat down, without any hesitation, we immediately ordered ""China Poblano cocktail experience."" On an average meal, we each can drink 2 to 4 cocktails easily, and $32 for 4 cocktails that's paired with the dishes we are about to order? Who in their right mind would've missed that?

As for food, we ordered: Langosta (seared lobster taco, I love how they served this dish out first and the grapefruit on the taco worked like an ""amouse bouche"" and ) Viva China (beef tendon/kumamoto oysters taco, the thinly sliced tendon was deep fried to the point like ultra thinned cristino! ) lamb pot stickers stuck on you (this is probably BF and my favorite of the entire meal; juicy minced lamb wrapped inside of dumplings that's topped with crispy fried pancake. An absolute culinary success,) Traditional Siu Mai (with edible gold on top,) Dan Dan Mian (I love how surprisingly spicy this noodle dish was,) Shrimp Mojo (my favorite second dish, not to be confused with Jaleo's garlic shrimp, the mojo sauce was actually blacken,) tres leches cake (by far the best tres leches I've ever tasted, and trust me I've tasted tons of them,) and churros (this dish was served fresh, so when I bit into the churro I can taste the exterior crunchiness as well as the soft and moist interior, not to mention they were served with a cup of hot chocolate as dipping sauce.)

China Poblano embodies attentive and friendly staffs, delicious food, drinks, and dessert, plus, modern and ""fusionized"" décor. It also was the first restaurant we went to after we arrived and checked into Cosmopolitan. Thus, the impeccable dining experience at China Poblano set the bar up pretty high for the rest of this trip. If I do have to nitpick, I only wish they had more items on their menu.

Also, the bartender did nothing but try to push stuff down our throat.  I've never had such an aggressive server at any establishment, made us feel like we were being ""sold to"" -- at dinner!?!

That said, some clever dishes, and they serve nicely sized portions.  Perhaps we came on an off-night?  Only gave it the 2nd star due to memory of the first visit.  Proceed at your own risk.",E3WaRvwaDg16pSuIwVkI5w,3,0,2,cVbbGTdqZQn3maVA-lBRbA

I should have known that a Chinese/Mexican restaurant would not be a good idea.  There is a reason why I've never come across this mix.  It's because it simply does not work!  This restaurant should either focus on making better Chinese food or better Mexican, not attempt to make both types of cuisines.

I had the dan dan noodles and some soup with wontons (the name escapes me now).  The dan dan  noodles were okay.  The soup didn't have much flavor.  It's only saving grace were the wontons.

My boyfriend ordered one lobster taco (because they are $10 a pop) and two chicken tacos (mole sauce on the side).  He said the lobster taco was good, but the chicken was just whatever.

Overall, the best thing that we ordered was the guacamole and the Mexican coke.  The chips and salsa were decent.",euYwTWKxSPk-oSV7ljFfNg,0,0,2,6E0P4NECLFlbwi2Ftpt2OA

So during my last Vegas adventure, the girls and I stopped in to China Poblano...the beautiful baby of when Mexico and China do it.

The decor was cute. Not only a mix of Chinese and Mexican iconography, it was also a mix of casual and a tad more upscale. The staff was friendly and on point.  Quick with the smiles and the conversation.  But the real pride of the litter was the food.

We ordered:
Guacamole
When Pigs Fly
Beijing Glass
Tuna Ceviche
Mexican Mimosa

It was all fantastic.

First of all, the guacamole was flavorful, smooth and had enough kick to make the table of Latinas eating it nod in appreciation.
When Pigs Fly (pork buns) were fluffy and rivaled the traditional buns I've had.
Beijing Glass was zesty and refreshing.
Mexican mimosa was refreshing with just the right bitch slap of booze to make it interesting.

But they all were dwarfed by the sheer awesomeness that was the Tuna Ceviche.  There were so many textures, flavors and spices that we all could barely contain ourselves!  It was the perfect marriage of Mexican spice and Chinese textures...exactly what this place is all about.

3707917,2013-11-19,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"The notion of intermingling Chinese and Mexican cuisine is intriguing and exciting, and when I saw China Poblano on Yelp it seemed ideal for a late afternoon lunch. Any excuse to walk to the beautiful Cosmopolitan is actually motivation enough for me. Unfortunately, though, the restaurant ended up being an expensive, huge let down. 

My initial impressions of the interior were pleasing. The space is flavored by festive reds and other vibrant colors, exuding a playful ambiance. As I continued to make my way inside, the lack of ventilation become apparent -- extremely warm. Peeling off my sweater was a quick fix, though. After sitting down, you notice that the walls are graced by rotating projected images of Mao Tse Tung, and random images of Chinese peasant girls, little boys, and Mexican adults. It was strange.

After being seated, we were shortly met by our waiter who inquired whether or not we wanted chips and salsa. Without hesitation I said ""Yes, please!"". The chips were served warm in a small basket and were, admittedly, quite good. The accompanying chipotle salsa was also tasty. What I didn't realize was that the chips and salsa were $4, not complimentary as this San Diegan is accustomed to. The couple next to us had an attractive bowl of guacamole that they were noshing on. I wanted the same and requested it. Loved the flavor, but wouldn't have ordered it had I known it was $15! We quickly ran out of the small portion of chips and requested some more to have with our remaining guacamole. An additional $2 for the chips. It was my fault for not carefully reading the menu, but, seriously, I would have never expected chips and guacamole to cost $21!!! Who would?

We ordered margaritas. $13 each. Glass was very small. Do they put tequila in their margaritas? Tasted as if I was drinking straight lime juice. Gross.  

Finally, we ordered a dim sum item, the Sui Mai, a 6-piece dumpling dish ($14). Dumplings were very small and too salty for my liking. This is an item that would probably cost no more than $4 at a typical dim sum restaurant. 

After the parade of disappointments, we decided to cut our losses and treat China Poblano as an appetizer spot and move on elsewhere for dinner. Unfortunately, it was an expensive appetizer experience:  Around $70+ with tip. Overall, this restaurant just didn't live up to my expectations at all.

The service left much to be desired. First, when I asked our waitress what the margaritas in the flight experience were, she referred to notes and only listed two of three, and said, ""I think the third is this..."". Did she go confirm? No. It was odd and LAZY. I was a little puzzled that she wouldn't go check.

One of the dishes, the ""dan dan mian"" was highly lackluster. No flavor, lukewarm and just bad. She came back and saw we barely touched it, but just was about to take it away without asking if anything was wrong. I interjected saying, this dish wasn't as good as the others. She responded, ""Yeah...depending on the night, it's hit or miss""...

I was shocked. Does Jose Andres think his food is HIT OR MISS? I would LOVE to hear you say that with him standing in ear's length. Any chef would be highly offended of this comment. 

The kicker? She didn't take it off our bill. So we took it off her tip. 

I won't be coming back. Or to any Jose Andres restaurant. Especially if he has servers saying his food is ""hit or miss"". Yikes.",pOGoWnHqeV_XkW1IEH0TsQ,2,0,1,PDIXzqIFmfU8Ad6HVvQmuw
3729044,2012-12-15,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"As we were gathering our things after touching down at McCarren airport,
our main concern was of course food.
I suggested Mexican (per usual) while my friend had been thinking Chinese. Well you can imagine our surprise when the concierge mentioned a Mexican-Chinese fusion restaurant within our very hotel.

This is not your standard Mexican. So be prepared to shell out a lot of money for
each very small taco. However, it is somewhat worth it. My friends ordered Green Tea Sour cocktails (with an edible marigold) while I tried a new beer: Moutai - it was light and exactly what I needed with my food. 

I tried the Barbacoas and Carnitas tacos. The Carnitas was quite delicious but I am not quite used to the consistency of pork belly, so it was a bit of shock to bite into something so... jelly-like. 

We ordered the Twenty-vegetable fried rice because apparently it was on some
well-known foodie list and we weren't disappointed at all.

Like all of our food, it was light, incredibly fresh and made with simple ingredients. 

For dessert I had the Mango Sticky Rice.
Coconut milk is boiled to a cream and then added to shaved mango
and sprinkled with crisped rice to create something incredible. Loved.
 
 The decor inside China Poblano was... interesting. There were steering wheels
spanning most of the ceiling, an altar of buddhas near the entrance, 
low ottoman seating and a red/orange color palette. 
 

What I loved? There is one ""bar"" for Mexican  and one for the Asian inspired dishes. Each were incredibly clean and each dish is served as it is ready so if you order several things (as you will need to) you do not have to place the same emphasis on some of the more traditional dining rules.
 
 While I enjoyed my experience there (for the most part...) I do not think I would go again. It is definitely a great place to pop into if you are in a bit of a rush and not 
particularly hungry, or else $6 per tiny taco just becomes a bit annoying.",uSTze3kFhbgu4GCf1IlbUQ,0,0,3,BieZsOIrpxe8iWopv_d-LA

I'd be willing to compromise and say that my disliking for the restaurant was due to ""denied expectations"". However, recipes aside, the food was bad in basic fundamental ways that anyone could understand. We started with the Queso Fundito which was super tasty, yet it's was just melted cheese, so idk how anyone could mess it up. Speaking of which, it was literally JUST melted cheese in a small shallow saucer sized dish; why is it $11? I tried 3 different tacos, each costing $6. The carnitas was dry, the fish was rubbery, the tortillas were soggy, and the bottoms fell out. My friend ordered the ""Silencio"", and it looked like she was eating a taco made of arteries. I ordered some shrimp mojo for $18, and I got eight overcooked shrimp swimming in sauce. It tasted alright at first, but with each bite, the overpowering flavor was too much. It didn't taste bad; the flavor was just obnoxious, and the shrimp was rubber. It tasted like some kind of sugary tamarindo sauce mixed with chili paste but without the spice. We also ordered some other fried rice dish which look okay until the waiter plopped a sloppy runny cured egg on top. I won't say it tasted bad, but I'll say the flavor was esoteric; meaning, the taste is something not many people in Vegas are going to understand or enjoy. I'm willing to concede that the waitress did give us a small warning upon ordering, so I guess it's our fault. However, I have to ask: why have an item on the menu if your staff is going to discourage people from ordering it? The restaurant states that the dish is authentically Chinese, which I give them kudos for. However, I'm not even sure how authentic it TRULY is due to the fact that the Mexican food was ANYTHING from authentic. This honestly could just be some overpriced garbage dish being peddled out for profit. Most people in Vegas would rather NOT have a dish that looks like it's daring me to eat it, especially when the bill came to be nearly $100. I felt like I was on an episode of Fear Factor.  All of that aside, the basic fundamental ingredients in our food was disappointing to say the least.

On the other hand, the sui mai I ordered was a big disappointment. It was almost to the point of raw and tiny compared to typical dim sum restaurants. I didn't like the fact that I just had guac and then took a bit of dim sum after. 

The biggest reason I'm giving this place 1 star and never coming back is the seating arrangement. The tables are about a foot away from each other and when I went, the place was near empty and the hostess still sat a group of men at the table right beside us.

$5 for ONE taco
$8 for FRENCH FRIES the size of an in n out fries.
$12 for a bowl of SOUP/POSOLE


Then we were like screw it we are hungry so we are just going to order. The restaurant is located in Cosmo on the second floor I believe. It's casual but pricey. Half the restaurant is Asian cuisine and the other half is Mexican. We came in cause it looked casual and the ambience was nice and colorful casual informal unlike many of the other eateries in Cosmo. 

Food was average not that great for my expectations of a $5 taco and $8 fries.
French fries were just whatever in a small basket with a mole taste like soy sauce dipping sauce. We asked for ketchup. NO KETCHUP?? But you serve fries I just don't understand. 

Soup was all right. Posole. Usually I like posole but this one was Okay. Had to add a bunch of limes.

Between me and two other girls, we split: papas fritas (fries with rich mole sauce), open sesame (chilled noodle salad), Beijing glass (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).

I had a Mexican Mimosa and other people in the group had the lychee sour cocktail and blood orange margarita.

Seriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  However, considering how many dishes we ordered for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable fried rice), I think we did just fine.  Sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in Vegas and you're at the Cosmopolitan.  The Strip is littered with Panda Expresses if you want something cheap.

3923439,2018-04-10,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"China Poblano is one of my favorite casual restaurants on the Strip. One plus is that for smaller groups or going solo, you usually won't need to wait long if at all for a table - and can always eat at the bar too. They also have a window for takeout orders.

First off, must get this out of the way:  This is NOT a fusion restaurant - they have Chinese small bites / street food and Mexican small bites / street food, served independently. This is pretty clear even from the restaurant's website and I don't at all get why people expect differently and then rate this place poorly for it.

My go-to dishes are the tableside guac (strongly recommend tortillas), twenty vegetable fried rice, lamb pot stickers, and the silencio, cochinita, and lengua tacos. The chilaquiles, ""gan pung ji"" chicken, and dan dan mian are all solid dishes and worth ordering if you're a fan of them generally, but not particularly outstanding.

Based solely on the food, this place is a pretty easy 5* but the service is rough sometimes (the waiters/waitresses are all usually friendly enough, but are often inattentive / slow to get things done). Similarly, when the place is busy, the cooking stations can get really backed up and the dishes take forever to come out (on a recent trip, the wok station was backed up and several of our wok dishes like the fried rice took nearly an hour to be prepared).",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,1,0,4,ErYQCAneHrHSU-pHwung8g

Steamed Shui Mai, (taste = 4 Stars)
Chicken Taco (taste = 3.5 Stars)

This is not a fusion of Chinese and Mexican.  Different cooks cooking, so all your food does not come out at the same time.

3955673,2016-01-04,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"The trickiest part of this Chinese/Mexican fusion idea is that as much as the Chinese dishes sound interesting, hold back your temptation and just get their tacos. Open up your mind and tastebuds to eat like a real Chinese person, AKA not to say eww at everything. 

Came here three times (2012, and twice in 2015). I'm going to ignore 2012 because that was when anything edible was good. Part 1 of 2015 was after hearing good things about this place from a friend for decently priced meal. Ended up getting the Beijing Glass, which is like a cellophane noodle salad that looks like a bibimbap, and a side order of Viva China taco, raw oyster taco. Noodle was basically a disappointment, bland, took too much work to chew or pick up. The taco however was packed with various tastes and textures. You have this soft taco shell with a thin crispy beef tendon, and this piece of Kumamoto oyster that's on the sweeter end and not meaty. It's a good 3-4 bite of surf and turf.

Came back another time and only got 3 tacos and split the Siu Mai sampler. Had to go back to my Viva China, discovered my new favorite: Silencio (duck tongue and lychee, sweet and savory), and Pancita al Pastor (pork belly, pineapple). The pork belly one was tender, but not too memorable. For those who are hesitating to try the Silencio, if you can eat lengua, it's just more chewy in texture. The sauce is similar to the one you eat with Peking Duck, the lychee is just a refreshing component to throw your taste buds out of the box. Fusion does work when it comes to Asiany tacos! Yes, the tacos are pricey, but how often do you find some fascinating combination of ingredients? Siu mai sampler was a disappointment, the dumplings were fairly small, traditional one wasn't even as good as your local dim sum restaurant's, the best one was the scallop. The thrill and enjoyment of that 1/3 good dumplings wasn't just as luck as they were called on the menu....",w3iXYLy7b89aoDxfU96i5g,0,1,4,8nIcvhGrzWrytKF4L8WFbg

Price and portion aside, the food wasn't that good. The shu mai making skills of the expressionless Chinese women in the open kitchen was extremely robotic, but it was really interesting to watch. They've reached the highest peak of their mastery of dumplings and now they look bored. There was no interaction between the cooks and bar occupants. At least you can confirm the food's authentic.

My bf and I wanted to taste a couple to start so we ordered 3 items and the couple with us went crazy and ordered 10. They gave my plate to them which ended up sitting on the side with their other 5 plates and so mine got cold before they corrected the mistake. That was also realized only after I inquired the whereabouts of my shu mai. The waitress was going to set my food down, then was stopped in her tracks by a manager(?) who ended up swapping the dish with our friend and then I finally ended up with my plate...which was now missing a dumpling. It's not a big deal since it was our friend who ate a shu mai thinking it was hers but I can't believe that's how the staff handled it. Anyway, the dish fell flat for me. I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference eating supermarket frozen shu mai. My bf ordered an expensive taco and ceviche that was pretty good but any slightly positive thought of the food was overshadowed by the bill and my still empty stomach.

Well, actually, it did...only 25mins after the wife finished her salad?? They were pissed. And frigid to the wait staff. Who did try their best to apologize. Multiple times. But really, nothing would get them to budge or lighten the mood. And these tables set up are RIGHT next to each other. Their bad mood was spilling into our table. 

But anyways, it did take a while for all our foods to come. Nothing comparable to the neighbors experience. I meannn, at the end of the day, it's really not the wait staffs fault. It's the operations and kitchens tbh. It's a strange set up. I get it. You're trying to be interesting and unique...but it's not being optimized to its full potential. 

ALSO. Aside frm the set-up and staff, the foods just not very good. Every single dish was over-vinegared. The bud and I thought it was super strange. I understand that you're trying to do a china-mex thing, but it just didn't taste very good. And you're charging $20 per dish!! After tip and tax, I paid almost $72 for just my portion...pretty ridiculous. My dishes were the shrimp mojo (main), woodear fungus (side), glass noodles (shared), and ceviche (shared app). The seafood was very fresh, but the flavors were strange!! Too much vinegar ahh. 

Okay, overall, 2.5 stars, but I'll round up to 3...",-lf3oTyr2K-CzBG67zZ6LA,1,1,3,i5Ds6_WTacyiQKFVqn8GjA

We were starving but knew we had a dinner to get to later with his family so we came for mostly a snack to hold us over. We ordered:

- Traditional Siu Mai
- Carnitas Taco
- Swallow a Cloud

I wish we could have ordered more to try other things because I was super happy with what we got. 

Traditional Siu Mai doesn't taste all traditional like you would get at a real dim sum place, but it was still pretty good in its own Vegas Chinese Mexican restaurant type of way. 

Carnitas Taco....bf and I cheers with the chicharron they put on top and enjoyed a pretty delicious taco with an awesome salsa verde. But $6 for one taco hurts the heart a little bit. But what can you do...it's Vegas. 

Swallow a Cloud (wonton soup basically) kind of surprised me. I didn't have high expectations for it and just thought it was going to be a salty mess. Wontons were flavorful, broth wasn't too salty and noodles were just right and not too soggy. But of course $16 is pretty rough to pay for a small portion of soup. 

Overall, pretty good dining experience. Service was friendly, but didn't refill on my water often. Food was delicious, but definitely overpriced. But because it's Vegas, I'd probably end up back here again the next time I'm in town.",FzkDfNqLQDjlJX6hw7UOBg,1,1,4,fEdIATIR1NpSoPArEZp-zA

My hot & sour soup was neither particularly spicy nor sour... but it was noticeably oily and somewhat lacking in traditional seasonings. 

On top of that, the food was overpriced for the portion sizes... if anything, the only thing I could say that was good about the price was that they decided to be cute with the Chinese side of the menu and make things $X.88 ... i.e. my soup was $8.88 --- my friend's dish was $12.88 ...  for those not in the know, 8 is a lucky # in Chinese culture... so - good try to be ""in touch"" and cute, but maybe knock down that first # by a few digits and then we can try to be friends.",-1pSQDWlS3HUU__Xt5Veow,0,0,3,h5RexQ1m4TiqAzY4BNBgIg

3996701,2014-01-12,3,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"There's no Mexican-Asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. It's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a Mexican restaurant or Chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. I love both Mexican food and Chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. Two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.

We ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both Mexican & Chinese food:

Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita ($15) - I liked this margarita a lot. I don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.

Guacamole & Chips ($15) - Handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what I would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. Chips were light, crispy and fresh.

Tacos (about $5 each) - I'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. I got the Tinga Poblana and it was good, but unless I'm expensing my meal to work, I would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.

Lamb Potstickers Stuck on You ($12.88) - 6 pieces - This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The lamb inside was tasty and I liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. Would recommend this.

Sui Mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - The only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. The rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. At a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.

Dan Dan Mian ($12) - Wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - This was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. At least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.

Col de Bruselas ($12) - These are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. I wouldn't get this again.

Shrimp Mojo ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. Sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.

Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos ($20) - Grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. It was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.

All in all, it's an interesting concept and I was there for work so I was able to expense my meal. With tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, I would rather eat at a Mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. With so many other options in Vegas, I'll be going elsewhere.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,9,3,1,lA2R4otFpZv63ttj-r382A

The three of us ordered the dan dan mien, wonton noodle soup and the beef lettuce dish to share. My favorite was the beef lettuce dish, only because the other two were  disappointing. Portions were pretty small overall, sadly. I really wanted soup, and the broth in the noodle soup was bland, but the wontons were yummy! There were barely any egg noodles.

The chewiness of the dan dan mien was perfect though! And the service was exceptional too. I also enjoyed the restaurant decor because it was really fun and cute, and loved the wallpaper and Asian style decorations.

4004621,2014-01-02,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"As a concept, China Poblano is classic Jose Andres. The tapas-style menu is perfect for groups and a good selection of Mexican street food and Cantonese dim sum staples will offer something for everyone. However once price comes into the equation, things get a little worrying.

China Poblano does a few things very well. It's hip, casual atmosphere is right at home at the Cosmopolitan and the quick service and sharing nature of the food make it a good lunch spot. 

The Good: China Poblano's tacos are easily the highlight of the menu. The braised beef barbacoa and chicken with chorizo are delicious options, but keep in mind they are quite small. The chilaquiles are another highlight with a bright tomatillo salsa and lots of melted cheese. The service was fast and friendly and the waitstaff were good about explaining each dish.

The Bad: For as good as their Mexican options are, China Poblano struggles more with the Chinese side of the menu. The Mongolian beef salad was described as lettuce wraps on the menu, only when it arrived we discovered that wasn't the case. The beef came laden with a corn syrup sheen found only at the very best bad Chinese spots and it was very tough to chew. The restaurant's prices are high, too high for what you're getting. China Poblano is clearly catered towards to street food crowd and over $6 for a taco (2-3 bites) is too much.

Andres is doing great things for gastronomy throughout the world and while the Mexican food at China Poblano is excellent, you pay a bit too much for the Andres stamp of approval.",tbhiRhBpVCfopKBfKBx5WA,1,1,4,brM_BiaMWeEitbGHNKLT3g

In addition, the burger place next door, Holsteins, is DELICIOUS and we've eaten there a few times so we thought we'd give this place a try.

The two of us wanted to sit next to each other, but the host would not let us. Apparently, all tables with adjacent seats were reserved. This place was only 30% full. When sat down, we sat next to each other anyway so a different host came and apologized, and pushed together another table for us so that we are more comfortable. Meh, whatever. 

We ordered When Pigs Fly, Barbacoa de Res, Don't Be Jealous, and a quesadilla off their ""specials"" menu. Also, a $6 bottle of a small non-refillable coke. Rip-off. When we got our food, they came one at a time so it was more like eating a bunch of appetizers. Which didn't bother me too much, but it bothered my boyfriend that he couldn't try a bite of each at a time, but instead was forced to finish one plate at a time. We had to send back Don't Be Jealous, a hot and sour soup. It had a thick layer of sesame oil and simply put, it just tasted like crap. They took it off the check so props for that.  The rest of the food was just meh. The Barbacoa de Res was $5.50 for ONE taco. Literally. It came wrapped with ONE corn tortilla so of course, as soon as I picked it up, it split in half and just fell all over the place. I've had better $1 street tacos. The When Pigs Fly was a microwaved dumpling. I can tell because I'm Asian. How disappointing. The filling was just bland sauce. The quesadilla was the best out of the 4 dishes and even that I could have made a better one at home, and it was 4 bites for $12. Let me just say that we don't mind paying stupid amounts of $$ for small plates, as long as they taste good. 

Wow. We were so upset that we didn't just go to Holsteins instead. Bad even for a strip restaurant. As a local, I hope this review will help others avoid this tourist trap restaurant.",ClxauyWzuiDI3SS8ODQdjw,0,0,1,b-KYugwhljBgyCVm8qu2cg

There's the ""kitchen"" in front that you can watch through a window from outside as a few chefs who given their appearance are most likely direct Chinese imports, acquired to boost authenticity both visually and gustatorially. There is the real kitchen that you don't see though, and most likely all the food that isn't a steamed bun is created back there by who knows who.

Fitting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, the digs are stylish and interesting and modern. Service is excellent and the menu has great variety, but prices are steep. I was surprised to see that they had rou jia mou on the menu, being somewhat obscure here in the United States to the average person, but I didn't order it. My friend did, and my initial reservation about the price to size assessment were correct. A typical rou jia mou is something like sauced pork in a flatbread sandwich about five inches in diameter (to simplify the explanation). This one was sized accurately and slipped into a protective waxed paper pocket to keep fingers clean. $8.88 is much too steep for such a ""snack,"" even in the somewhat stylish surroundings. The meat in the rou jia mou had the same shortcomings that I've seen in other restaurants in the same dish and in beef rolls. The sauce is correct, but the meat is flavorless-if it is done properly, the sauce flavor permeates the meat instead of just covering it.

I had the dan dan mian, the noodles being very good, but the sauce had no kick, no spice. That seemed to be a re-occuring theme throughout our table's dishes- weak flavor.

I'm tempted to return simply because I hadn't explored the Mexican side of the menu, especially because that is one thing that this country does ""right"" more often, but my reservations continue to be about price. Perhaps if I'm in the casino again and flush with winnings, I'll return. Otherwise, there's much more culinary turf to explore in the city.",S8kjaodas_r7jZw-O_vURw,0,0,2,-efQN5JjMeNmmAcUO5SBbw

That wild mushroom taco was so delicious!!!! I have never had anything like it. Priced at $5.50, it is rather expensive for a teeny tiny taco but I LOVED it and that makes it totally worth it. I thought that the noodles and fried rice were also pricey, but really good and surprisingly filling. Try counting 20 vegetables in the fried rice... try it! J really enjoyed the pozole. I'm sure he wished it came in a larger portion too. The lotus chips were thin and crispy, not greasy at all.

Unfortunately, I was ultimately disappointed.  The service was actually quite excellent, but the food ultimately fell short, considering the price.  

It was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  A Mexican kitchen and a Chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  I was hoping for more fusion entrées, but there were only a few.  The menu was predominantly Mexican or Chinese.  

Setas Tacos: Mushroom tacos.  Nothing special.  It felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.

Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: Actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  Good flavors, season well.  Is it worth paying $16 for fried rice...however good it may be?  Questionable.

The Unruly Monk: Hand-cut noodle soup.  When it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  The hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  The broth lacked flavor.

Beijing Glass: My friend had this one.  It actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  I'd call this dish a success.

Guacamole: This was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  But $12 for only one cup of guac????  C'mon...that's crazy talk. 

Papas Fritas with XO Sauce: Interesting concept, but WOW...that XO sauce is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  I had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.

Happy Buddha Giggling Taking a Bath: It seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  How can you not like a jello mold of Buddha sitting in lychee foam??  It was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10. 

All-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  Great service kinda made up for it.",dXgvqyCc67GQAYC1hQHQbQ,3,2,2,jPJvq4qWu-qUenbT2enHNg

I was curious to see how his Vegas efforts were doing, so checked this one out on a recent Vegas trip.

Even in a town full of esoteric and unusual design, it has an eye catching design and great decor.  The number of tables inside is limited, but there are 2 large bars, and various randomish seating outside.  It's pretty unique looking, bright colors.  There's a carryout window.

Service was over-attentive.  The female server thought the habanero salsa was far too hot to possibly have by itself (we found it hot but enjoyed it by itself)...

That salsa and chips were both very good.  A chinese-mexican fusion taco wasn't worth repeating.  A barbacoa taco was some of the best barbacoa I've had!  Drinks pricey but strong.  The GF had one with ground-mezcal-worm on the rim, I had one less exciting-- both great.

The prices are highish-- this is a fancy restaurant, it's Jose Andres, and it's on prime real estate.  A full dinner will set you back if you have much appetite at all.  Two tacos, a small steak entree, two drinks, and chips/salsa were about $75 after tip.

This is Vegas, and there is people-watching-- there's a fair amount of foot traffic from people staying at the Cosmopolitan.

If you're looking for American-Chinese food (you know, the crap they serve in altogether far too many suburban joints) or for Tex-Mex, this isn't the place.

For some top-shelf drinks and innovative cooking, you've come to the right place.  Just expect dinner to be expensive!",tw1cog0v0KLoQkvwM9kUYA,1,1,4,0HH4uA83-EFAYySln3joHg

Not a fusion by any means, the menu is split and offers an array of choices; small and large. 
The immediate difficulty we had was understanding what the dishes were. The descriptions weren't easy to grasp. We ended up choosing four things to split, one of which the waiter suggested. 

+ The ambience was cool; lots to look at it, and it wasn't too loud. 
+ I had a glorified warm steak salad that was delicious.
+ All of the food came out in less than 15 minutes despite how busy they were. 

- We weren't served water promptly.
- Our waiter almost got our order wrong. Luckily I caught him as he was entering it in the computer.
- The shrimp ceviche was bland and needed more acidity. 
- The noodle dish that our waiter recommended was nothing special, it was actually better a few hours later when we reheated it.

The caldo tlalpeno wasn't that good had a odd flavor.  The 20 vegetable fried rice ($19.88)was just ok, until I added monk sauce($2.88), it added some flavor to it. The rou jia sandwich was pretty good, the pork was very sweet tasting.  Now the shrimp mojo, looked bad, but was very good.

The Viva China (oysters + soft beef tendon+ peppercorn sauce) taco was quite tasty as was the Huitlacoche noodles with mushrooms and Mexican corn truffles. The best cold dish has to be the Palmitos (hearts of palm + grapefruit salad) which was ideal to combat the Vegas heat. 

No matter what the server suggests, the shrimp mojo (shrimp + fermented garlic sauce) is not worth it for the tiny bits of shrimp. It's something a Chinese mama could make for a lot less.

However, even megastars like Jose Andres gotta be rooted somewhere in the real world, therefore A-OK.

Service: affectionate and easygoing, if not slightly awkward and inefficient. Generally when I spill a boatload of water as I pour it from pitcher to customer glass, I like to wipe it up -- but hey, that's just me.

Cocktails: my girls Megs and Les, they don't shy away from the good ol' flammable stuff. I opted for the Lychee Sour, which was perfection, but Les didn't particularly care for her Singapore Sling, which I also liked, so we switched. Megs got the Lemon Drop Noodles and while the novelty of a gastronomy-inspired ""noodle"" inside an alcoholic beverage was always there, the satisfaction with the drink itself was not. Slightly too sweet and therefore too concentrated.

My Mexican half:
Chips and salsa -- can't go wrong. Especially if you like the smokiness and texture of a fresh homemade chipotle salsa, start out with this. Just beware -- doesn't come with a whole lot of chips.
Queso fundido -- melted cheese, baked in a traditional clay bowl, with rajas strips placed on top. Delicious, surely not for the faint of anti-cheese heart.
Coctel de camarones -- the best part of the Mexican cuisine IMO. Perfectly seasoned with gigantic pieces of shrimp, avocado, and crab. Delightful, but pricey.
Fried fish taco -- fried to perfection and topped with a complementary green chile salsa. Divine. Don't forget that squeeze of lime it seriously needs though.
Carnitas taco -- comes with chicharrones. How can you go wrong? My girl Les doesn't do onions and it came with a generous topping of 'em. Buyer beware.
(BTW: Extra tortillas, while deliciously fresh and piping hot off being handmade about ten steps away, cost $4. Buyer REALLY beware!!!)

My Chinese half:
Har gau -- the promise of shrimp and pork belly is, without a doubt, irresistible to most. This comes out awesomely fresh and still appealing to many a dim sum lover, but... salt much?
Ten treasures (?) -- this is SOUP noodles, not regular fried/dry noodles. with ham, shrimp, fresh veggies, enoki mushrooms and noodles. I loved it, but again, couldn't deal without our side of soy sauce. Salt much?
Siu bao (or whatever they call it here) -- the meat is absolutely delicious and the bread is kneaded to a perfect consistency. But seriously........ it's called salt.

The bottom line: China Poblano is gorgeous -- a well-thought-out, neatly decorated space that no doubt will attract a ridiculously large clientele due in part to its being in the newest hotspot in Vegas, but also in part to its well-known celebrity chef backing. Personally, being part Chinese and practically 'raised' Mexican, I do appreciate this sort of ""fusion status."" However, it's a simple matter of seasoning and salt in most cases, and for how much we paid, I'm not sure it should come down to that. Would I come back? Sure.

-Shu Mai Scallops (6 pcs) - Shu mai was more gooey than the usual plumpness that I expect from shu mai. It wasn't that great, especially for the $12 price.

-Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich - A tasty, juicy pork sandwich. By far the best tasting food on our table. You only get one per order. And, it's tiny.

Overall, the apps were mediocre. The food is puny, bland, and pricey. Ended up spending over $30 a person and we were still hungry.

We stopped ordering food after receiving plate after plate of disappointment. We ended up going to the hidden pizza shop upstairs to make up for this mediocrity. Spent $4 there and enjoyed that meal that made my stomach and wallet happy.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,5,3,2,6B_94ImddcZtNHsjeBVQvA
4242974,2013-12-05,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We were pleasantly surprised by China Poblano, so I'm glad we didn't read the reviews before coming here.  First off, I'm not sure this is actually supposed to be a fusion restaurant.  From the outside, it looks like an Asian restaurant and a Mexican restaurant that just happen to be next to each other/share the same space.  And pretty much, that's how the food is as well.  We came here in the early evening the day of our arrival in Vegas and sat at the bar.  This probably enhanced the experience as our bartender/waiter/greeter was extremely friendly, personable, knowledgeable, and whatever other superlative -ables you want to add on there.  There's also some obvious advantages in having the waiter and the liquor right in front of you the entire time.

I ordered one of the special cocktails of the day, which was some sort of blackberry mojito.  It was good, but far outshined by my mom's salt air margarita which we are still talking about 8 months later.  Who knew foam could be so delicious?  The food was generally a success, with the tortilla chips being warm and fresh, the salsa having just the right amount of kick, and the tacos being messily delicious (try the beef tongue, trust me on this!).  On the Chinese side of things, mom adored her hot and sour soup while I would pass on the BBQ pork buns next time.  They were fine, but nothing special and for the prices you pay, special is a requirement.

With the number of options available in the Cosmo itself, not to mention all along the Strip, I'm not sure I would make a point of hurrying back here, but if someone suggested it or I found myself in the area with a craving for Mexican and/or Chinese, I would be perfectly pleased to pay them another visit.",Xsuv6bKcPUVDWih0DtEBbA,2,2,4,sHc3V2o4tntnP19-tmyGrw
4243890,2011-01-03,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"The first thing that went wrong was on the wall. At first, I liked the decor --a casual, colorful blend of Chinese and Mexican motifs --Chinese opera masks, Oaxacan wood carvings, red glass lanterns, bicycle wheels on the ceiling (not sure the country, but cool). They also had portraits that were actually large projections, that switched every few minutes. So you had Frida Kahlo, the Dalai Lama (not Chinese, by the way!) and random peasants.

What pissed me off before our food even came out was that they were projecting a photo of Mao. If you were running a German restaurant, would you put up a picture of Hitler? Because that's basically who Mao was in China. I know it's considered hip and trendy to use Mao's image as a cultural icon, but THIS MUST STOP. 

Okay, on to the food. The next thing that went wrong was they brought out the wrong order --we'd ordered duck tongue tacos, they brought the beef tendon with kumamoto oyster. My husband took a bite and realized the mistake --and also that the oyster was really off. I could smell it across the table, and no way should a fresh oyster smell that strong. Kumamotos are my favorite oyster so I am very familiar with a fresh, sweet specimen. This was wrong. 

Our server was very friendly and seemed sharp, she took it away with an apology and we got the duck tongue. I took a bite and it was pretty tasty. However, I couldn't get over the fact that I was chewing on a tongue, and tender and flavorful as it was, I couldn't take another bite. 

However, the salsa that came with the tacos was DELICOUS. I was eating it with a spoon (since I didn't want any more tongue). One of the best salsas I've had, it ranks up there with Papalote's in SF and Cancun's in Berkeley. Really amazing. 

The Beijing glass was fresh and healthy --a big mixture of chilled glass noodles and veggies. It was underdressed, however, and finally we asked for extra dressing which helped a lot. 

The gazpacho was a big surprise --we expected the traditional soup presentation, but instead, got a bowl of cut fruit, and a server squeezed orange over it, tableside. It was delicious, with jicama and dragonfruit in the mix. 

We also ordered the scallop ceviche at the recommendation of our server and this was a HUGE disappointment. For the price (about $12, I think) we got 4 bay scallops (tiny). The concept was cool --they were served on top of limes that had chiles and sugar on top. You popped the scallop and followed with a squeeze of sugary, spicy lime juice. It just underwhelmed because the scallops were so diminutive and less than stellar. For that price and with that presentation, you expect stellar and full-sized diver freshness. 

The dessert we got was great --Tres Lychees (a play on tres leches cake). The lychees came three ways --in a milk-soaked cake, whole, on top of the cake, and as a foam. 

Our whole lunch bill came to about $75, and I was still a little hungry afterwards. If you go, I recommend being extremely judicious with your ordering, read reviews to see what's good, and maybe stash a snack in your purse.

Some people have complained that there isn't enough ""fusion"" on the menu --but most of the dishes (even if they're listed as ""Mexican"" or ""Chinese"" only) have a twist. We discovered that the twists are not necessarily explained on the menu, and you may get some big surprises (like our gazpacho). So I appreciate what the restaurant is trying to do --blend two disparate traditions in a delicious way, surprise with ingredients, and use molecular techniques when it enhances the food.",h4RPNNmFZPwJXQuFe1M9mg,2,1,3,kt4ZUTEg29MYveLeY1j6nw

The $15 guacamole should have been a tip-off ... the waiter swore it was THAT good...so we gave it a try.  I'd say at best it might be slightly above average.  Unless its amazingly hard to truck an avacado into Las Vegas though, at $15 for an avacado, some lime, and a tomato they are making a killing on this dish.

Next up, salt and pepper tofu. This dish is best described as bland and unsatisfying. I love me some good tofu - but good this was not. Basically it was 4 pieces of tofu doused in corn starch and fried. Seasoned with some salt and pepper. There was a small chile garnish, but it was pretty bland and didn't give the tofu any flavor.  $12.88 for that gem of a dish. Disapointing.

The waiter raved about the famous fried rice, featured on food network, yada yada. I was really looking forward to it... It was ok. I appreciated that the vegetables were nicely, uniformly diced up for texture, but man it was HEAVY. Very greasy dish.  Again for $20 I expected something a bit more sophisticated. 

My wife had Gan Pung Ji Chicken, which to her was a big bunch of averageness for $23.00. 

Another annoying thing about this place is they bring your food out at random times. That meant my wife was done with her entree before I was even served mine. The waiter explained this was just how their restraurant worked. WHAT?! Why? It makes no sense. What kind of restraurant thinks that is normal?

Definitely would under no cirumstances eat here again. There are a lot of other choices in vegas that provide MUCH better food and MUCH better service at a MUCH better price. 

To summarize, if you are in Vegas and want to throw away some money. You can either hit the tables or hit china pablano. The tables are a lot more fun and at least there is a chance you may come out ahead. At china pablano however you are gauranteed to be a loser.",AXeRt7PBUjRAFBvcgkdx_g,2,1,1,5dNheo-jqUKlx77OO0j7Ew

We had my baby nephew in tow . . . and he's a heartbreaker. So we got terrific service. A high chair, attentive service, helpful beyond the norm. Our server clearly knew the menu too and offered us lots of great suggestions. 

My one regret is not ordering more Mexican food. I was more intrigued by (and our server offered more suggestions of) the Chinese food. It was tasty . . . although we didn't love the dumplings: too much dough, filling was too sweet. The tacos that we ordered were awesome, though. We got the carnitas.

I like them mutually exclusively & never got on the fusion food bandwagon. I went in a party of 6, and we shared everything family style - that's the way to go! 

Sitting on the ""patio"" is a great place for people watching, as it's across the way from Marquee and the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan. 

Some highlights from our meal:
- Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: absolutely delicious and strongly scented of sesame.
- Chilaquiles: the Menorita cheese was so melty, salty and perfect
- Shrimp Mojo: Light spice. I like the addition of the black garlic
- Kao Lao Lao: Little rolled noodle sheets served with a fermented vegetable sauce. Very rich, umami flavor
- I didn't personally get the duck tongue tacos, but those that did were blown away!

My only gripe was the price of alcohol. On a whim, we decided to order a pitcher of margarita & a few a la carte drinks - which pushed our $200 meal to well over $300. Oopsies, should have looked at the price beforehand. They were mediocre, so pre-party elsewhere.

I am so sad that we only came here for lunch so I only was able to sample a few items. Thankfully, Vegas is only 5 hours away from San Diego and I will be sure to  eat at China Poblano the next time I visit!

Firstly, I just love the ambiance of Jose Andres' restaurants. They are worldly, fun and adult at the same time. Between courses I was entertained by watching the pictures on the wall change from Chinese and South American peasants to Mao Zedung.

The margaritas we ordered were spectacular. While I was tempted to order the margarita with the salt air (to brag about the pretentious ""salt air"" LOL) I went with the blood orange chile pequin margarita. It was balanced, but SUPER strong. One was enough to start my Vegas party blood pumping!

My friends and I ordered a variety of tacos, which were all fantastic. I am a sucker for carnitas. While I have no shortage of those tacos in San Diego, none of them are topped with chicarrones like the ones at China Poblano! It added the perfect crunch to the perfectly cooked and tender pork. The carnitas weren't overly salty as they can be at other restaurants.

We split the Dan Dan noodles that came with black vinegar (oh black vinegar, how I love thee) and were so delicious. The guacamole was rich and flavorful. I love that it was served with tortillas and not just chips. 

My favorite dish was the Siu Mai with quail egg. I have grown up eating Siu Mai - it is among my top favorite dim sum dishes...holy crap China Poblano's Siu Mai was amazing! The quail egg on top was so perfect (see my picture). The yolk was runny and gave the already delectable Siu Mai flavors an extra kick.

On the count  of texture, taste, and quality, these completely succeeded and I offered the perfect teaser for us to delve into a more serious entree. 

Next came the pork and quail egg Sui Mai which completely blew me away!! The delicate unbroken yolk of the quail egg perfectly cooked on top of the soft pork Sui Mai generated the most winning flavor with the light soy sauce.

- Chicken JiSong

Barbacoa de Res taco - bbq beef with chili and cactus - YUM!
Pancita al Pastor taco - slow cooked pork belly with pineapple - My Fave!!!

I had heard about China Poblano but couldn't totally wrap my head around Chinese Mexican fusion. But extreme hunger and the lure of the fluorescent pink sign outside lured me in to give it a shot. 
I walked over to the hostess still a little unsure of what I was getting myself involved with. She sat me at the bar and highly recommended trying the chef's experience since I was solo. I explored their menu and looked over the Chef's experience menu and decided that I would go with her recommendation. 
First and foremost let me just tell you for $45.00 this is about as much as a bargain as you will find food wise on the strip! There was so much  food!!! Initially when I looked over the menu I thought that I was going to have to choose an item from each of the sections on the menu, it wasn't until I saw someone else sitting near me eating that I realized I get EVERYTHING from the Chef's Experience menu. Holy Moly!!!!!

My waiter suggested a great cocktail that wasn't on their regular drink menu, I am stoked that I went with his suggestion and tried this absolutely amazing cocktail. I can't remember exactly what was in the drink but it was a crazy delicious cocktail that had hibiscus and tequila. If you go, I highly highly recommend trying this drink. 

With the Chef's Experience I was served the following, 
Chips & Salsa
Tuna Ceviche Spoon
Traditional Siu Mai
Snow Pea Leaf Salad
Carnitas Taco
Shrimp Mojo
Twenty Veggie Fried Rice 
Mango Sticky Rice 

I was initially served my chips and salsa, the salsa was pretty good. I was then served a single Siu Mai with gold leaf flakes on top. I wasn't blown away by the Siu Mai, but it was good but likely one of the more forgotten about parts of the meal. 
The Tuna Ceviche Spoon was really well balanced and it had the right about of acid/salt and heat. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the Snow Pea Leaf Salad. It was just delicious. It consisted of Pea Shoots, Snow Peas, Orange, Lily Bulb, Walnuts, and Pomegranate Seeds with a sesame dressing. It was just so refreshing and well balanced that I will be going home to try to recreate this salad. The Carnitas taco was pretty good, the tortilla was delicious and the pork was super tender but I felt like it could have used a little more heat and maybe a little more cilantro. But that's my own personal preference. I like things a little spicy and I am a huge fan of cilantro. I put a little bit of the sauce that was served with my Siu Mai on my taco and I thought it added an interesting element to the taco. The Shrimp Mojo was also like the Siu Mai and was a little on the forgettable side. I felt like it really just fell flat flavor wise. The Twenty Veggie Fried Rice was really good, I LOVED how they put a bit of the Snow Pea Leaf Salad on top of the rice, It really lightened up the dish. The Mango Sticky Rice was the perfect way to end the meal. It was super refreshing and delicious. 

I am honestly surprised that this place doesn't high a higher rating on yelp. From my experience it was really delicious and prices were on point. Service was a little spotty at times and I was stuck with multiple dirty plates in front of me during my coursing but those things are all easy to fix.

Next time I am in Vegas and not solo I will be back and am excited to see what delicious items they feature from their full menu.",5jz-BicrPZGCp-Mi-oBRUw,8,7,4,F8WKhYHCP95slUEpfaE2ZQ

We both tried the MasterCard tasting menu, which came with a variety of dishes to try and two ""mini cocktails.""  The staff was extremely accommodating and tweaked my husband's dishes since he does not eat seafood.

We started with guacamole, which was creamy and spicy (but not too hot). It was served with warm tortillas instead of chips. We had more guacamole than we could eat with the tortillas, so we ate some with the other courses as a garnish. Our first cocktail was the salt air margarita, which was delicious. The salt foam was fun and tasty. Next I had the tuna ceviche, which I would never have ordered, but it ended up as my favorite dish. The dim sum course was ok (the siu mai was flavorful). The veggie rice was really great - I can see why other reviews have complimented it so frequently. The spicy shrimp was cooked perfectly and packed a punch. We had spicy noodles (which I think was a replacement for the shrimp for my husband) and it was awesome too. The texture of the noodles made me think they were home made. The taco was good (pork I think?) but not as unique as a lot of the other dishes (we still ate every bite of it).  The last cocktail was something with bourbon and grapefruit, which was a crazy combo, but it worked. Dessert was churros in a delightful chocolate sauce which I could have drank straight from the cup. 

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. If we were in town longer, I would go back and try more things (or even just order the guacamole, cevice and rice again!!). I totally recommend China Poblano and will definitely return in the future!",694WUhj3NuURhkFvjQeDrQ,0,0,4,EZXv4cua3IrBLIt-IxoJNQ

Like the decor but the small benches were not comfy after a day of deadlifts. In order, lamb pot stickers--decent. Juicy insides needed a fruit base or vinegar dipping sauce. The crunchy ""lid"" was flavorless. Next a squash salad with sweet peanut and plum sauce. Super bland unless you pile every component on the fork. Then Chile green bean noodles. Those were yummy with the pickled daikon radishes. Next skirt steak mole. Please! Where is all the great mole in the city?? We have a huge Mexican community.

- Super cute and trendy decor, we had such a great time noticing the small details around us as we waited on food.  It almost feels like dining in an eclectic art gallery, fun.

- The service was pretty solid, not rushed nor too pushy -- but very attentive with water glasses filled at all times, friendly rapport and helpful suggestions.

- The drinks were interesting.  Not strong or obsess about the cocktail menu until you return amazing, but definitely stood out above most of the rest of our Vegas beverages.  In particular, the Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita  had a unique flavor (not as spicy as we'd like it, but that's not unusual as we're freaky about our spiciness) -- and the Salt Air Margarita was an experience.

But now for the food....

It was just 'meh'.  Probably lower than meh... 'eh'?  

I love fusion cuisine and small plate dining as much as the next food geek, but for the price and build up everything really fell short.  The chips and tortillas tasted store bought (or crappily made, if actually done in-house), the ceviche tasted borderline 'off', even the queso fundido was barely mediocre (who knew you could mess that up).  

For the price and the buzz we heard, it was a total let down.  A great meal and a couple of nice dinner drinks are priceless in our household.  But this particular dinner for two set us back around $160 and was instantly regretted.

-Prices were more reasonable
-Food, in general, was tastier (for my taste at least)
-It was something of a hybrid between tapas and regular entrees, so some dishes you could order were sizable enough to actually fill you up
-Food came faster, and so it was a more casual experience overall

The brussel sprouts were amazing.  The charred and sour notes just made the sweetness of the brussel sprouts pop that much more.  It was an unbelievable dish that I don't think I could every replicate without it being too sour or too burned.

Second, it's owned by Jose Andres, who is absolutely one of my favorite chefs, but who is a master of Spanish molecular gastronomy, not either Chinese or Mexican, so what's up with that?  Third, it's in the Cosmo in Vegas.  Nothing makes any sense about this place ... and yet it works.

We were in desperate need of food after running the Vegas Half Marathon, and everything else in the Cosmo seemed to be swamped by suits from a convention.  This spot looked interesting, so we figured, what the heck?   Boy are we glad we did!

We had the char siu bao, a standard version of the Chinese dim sum classic barbecue pork in a steamed wheat bun, although theirs had a lot more barbecue pork inside than usual, which was a very nice touch!

We also had the wings with fermented black bean paste and a dry rub.  These were a great variation on your standard wings, the dry rub was spicy and salty, and gave the wings a lovely crispy exterior.  The fermented black bean sauce was okay, but I don't know how much it added to the dish.

The highlight had to have been the pork and shrimp shu mai with quail egg.  The shu mai itself was pretty standard fare (albeit a nice rendition), but they cracked a quail egg on the top before steaming it, so it came out with a perfectly poached yolk sitting on top. When you bit into the shu mai (please, do it in one bite), the yolk exploded, elevating the shu mai to something amazing.   Every dim sum place ought to adopt this!

Finally, we had ants climbing a tree, cellophane noodles with a slightly spicy pork sauce on top.  Another pretty classic chinese dish, and again done well.

China Poblano is a ""nice casual"" Chinese/Mexican fusion restaurant at the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas.

Queso Fundido - THIS IS A MUST if you like cheese.  One of the best queso dishes I have EVER tried, complete with handmade, fresh tortillas!
Chilaquiles - Delicious and filling...not necessarily sure you need to get this if you are getting the queso fundido, as it is the same cheese.
When Pigs Fly - Awesome ""dim sum"" style pork buns...yum!
Beijing Glass Noodles - Wonderful cold noodle dish, sort of like a noodle salad...that might not sound that intriguing, but this is a must try as well
Papas Fritas with Mole Poblano, Mexican Cream, and Queso Fresco - A great fries dish not to be missed!
Twenty-vegetable fried rice - This is what they are famous for.  It's good, but not my fave of what I have tried.

Staff was all friendly and tried to be very professional Except when they dropped a lime peel on the floor and picked it up and continued to use it. They were training someone on how to make a garnish, and they said ""this is just a practice one"" when they picked it up, but they put it back on the clean cutting board and kept going...probably should have started over.

Happy hour menu has decent selection of beverages. Tried the salt air margarita which was recommended but not on for happy hour menu. It was good, but not the best margarita I've had. Rather that a salted rim it had a salted ""air"" (foam). 

Happy hour wings were tasty. Mild but had a decent flavor. Serving was 4.

Happy hour quesadilla was decent tasting, two small triangles.

Also, if you have an allergy, like at all the José Andrés restaurants, they have a special menu for you! I recommend trying something Mexican and something Chinese. The Dan Dan Mian is not spicy (tastes like Korean Barbecue) but amazingly delicious. The Beijing Glass is fresh and a lighter, healthy fare.

- Steamed Chinese pork buns 
     == Yummy. I've been eating Chinese steamed pork buns since I was a little kid. These ALMOST taste like the ones my grandmother made. So good
- Flautas in mole sauce 
     == These little crispy guys were decent. The mole sauce was pretty tasty, but this dish wasn't mind blowing. 
- Beef Shu Mai 
     == I've had tons of shu mai before, but these guys were a little different with the watermelon radish on top and a little bit of lime zest. Don't get me wrong, they were yummy, but had a little something different from homestyle shu mai.
- Pozole Rojo
     == This was the best dish of the entire night. The soup was spicy full of flavor. The pork was super tender and the additional radish, avocado, onion, and cabbage made the dish phenomenal. I would come back here for the pozole. My only complaint is that it was a tad on the salty side.
- Chicharron Quesadilla
     == A quesadilla is a quesadilla. This one just happened to have crispy little chicharron pieces in it. It also came with a spicy chili sauce. 

We also had some drinks there (The Singapore Sling, The Orient, Blood Orange margarita and Pomegranate margarita) and they were all delicious. The Singapore Sling is a sweet and fruity drink so if that's your style, go for that. The Orient was like a fancy spruced up gin and tonic. The Blood Orange margarita was awesome and spicy. The pomegranate margarita had a salt foam on top which was totally different, but a little too much of it for my liking.

I know, I know after all this is Las Vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. It is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. During this particular visit I arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). One of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Judging by it's miniture size I doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars! 

Next up is the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. It was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone! 

Then my hunny and I split the Shrimp Mojo per the waiter's recommendation. It was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. It was $16 for eight pieces.

Again my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions.

There's actually TWO sides to the menu, Mexican and Chinese. This is not a fusion restaurant in the sense that the dishes are an amalgamation of both cultures and flavors, this is actually TWO cuisines co-existing on the same restaurant menu.

We came here for a dinner, pre-clubbing in Vegas. The location at Cosmopolitan is nice, easy to access (2nd floor pavilion near Marquee night club). We had a big party of 10 and made a reservation, were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. We had a few energetic waiters/servers and they explained the concept and threw out suggestions.  We all deiced to order and share...so people began ordering...Mexican tacos, guacamole, tuna ceviche, empanadas...and Chinese pot stickers, 20-veggie fried rice (my choice), cold noodles, etc.

We ordered a LOT of food. I think I tried everything, and you know what...NOTHING stood out...NOTHING was ""oh my god good"" and it was surprisingly bland, surprisingly meh, and surprisingly not all that filling. It just didn't do it for me.

Weird concept, bland food, confused and concerned taste buds and tummy, HUGE bill (like $600 huge), and we all didn't feel like we ordered and ate $600 worth of food and drink.  It was suffice to say...a MISS...and we should have gone to some other concept place like Mesa Grill, etc if we had really thought of it...only nice thing was proximity to our first club of the night...this was not what I have heard and experienced from Jose Andres' and we all left very disappointed.",3NnPbhmv_vEfPTBp2pnn9Q,3,1,2,0PdbY5Xt8qYqIFlTLBgMNg

Pros: Affordable food prices; Amazing, changing decor; Friendly servers and wait staff; Incredible cocktails (Try the Salt Air Margarita); Not at all stuffy or pretentious; Straightforward menu presentation; Welcoming atmosphere;  INCREDIBLE FUSION FOOD.

Cons: Still getting used to paying $8 for a Tsingtao (I don't think I pay that much for a six-pack back home); Tacos are good, but pale in comparison to the rest of the menu.

Do get: Dan Dan Mian (spicy, vinagery, peanuty, sticky, delicious noodles); Golden Pigs and Stuck on You dim sum...Still in shock about these.

Don't get: Lengua tacos (on the blander side, even for beef tongue, with a near-tasteless brown sauce on top).

A major advantage to this restaurant is the vegetarian options. The only disadvantage, which has nothing to do with the food is the seating options.

I love the concept of Mexican and Asian. It is honestly a dream come true for me. Tacos and Noodles! What an awesome combo, especially if one is inebriated. I usually only dine here based on the sole reason of convience.

Tacos and Noodles (especially the noodle soups) just dont seem worth it to me to pay those extra bucks. I understand that it is by Jose Andres, and I understand that its expensive, and I understand that its meant to be in small portions, and I understand that its suppose to be gourmet-esque, a cream of the crop type of ideal.
BUT...
I just dont see the possibility of tacos and noodle soups being capable of elevated at that high of a level. Its like taking something wayyy out of its comfort zone and making it work. 

Long story short, the food is delicious, the prices are pretty high, the portions are very small, the location is very convenient for those staying in the Cosmopolitan.

I got the barbacoa and was told the mushroom was highly recommended. At 4.50 a pop, I'm expecting some high quality stuff. But alas, all I got was some pretty ho-hum tacos on a nice looking frosty plate. My friend ordered the cochinta, and said she'd come back for that again

Like most of the reviews say,  the food is Excellent,  but it adds up quickly with the small dishes.  If money were no object, I would go here once a week.  But at that price, its more of a special occasion.    the Cocktails were Fabulous,  and very tasty,  as were the pre-cocktails we had at Chandelier Bar.  

My Favorite dish was the Traditional Shu Mai,  the ""gold"" flecks were a nice touch.  They were moist and yummy and flavorful.   The 10 ingredient soup was a very unique blend of flavors.  good,  but next time I'll try a noodle soup.  
The Guacamole was super yummy,  it had cucumber which I'll have to add to my next batch.  

My other favorites were the Carnitas Taco with green sauce and chicarones, mmmm and the Tuna Ceviche with sesame.  

For the barbacoa taco,  i was expecting a traditional mexican slow roasted beef,  not something with bar-b-que sauce.  Although I love nopalitos (cactus) on anything.

My girl and I wanted to have a great culinary experience at this place, but we left disappointed.  The decor was pretty cool, taking pieces from both cultures.  However, for being more of a tapas place, the table was tiny (couldn't fit more than two or three plates) and the chairs were kind of uncomfortable.  The service was alright at best.  The prices were not very friendly at all.

The food was nothing spectacular.  Being from LA, I could get just as good a taco from several trucks straight off the street.  But, I did enjoy the lobster taco (way too pricey tho $10 for a small corn tortilla taco).  We also did like the queso fundido w/ chorizo.  That was definetly a tasty way to start of the meal!  The scallop shumai were alright and the other tacos were ehh.  Overall, we greatly overpaid for a mediocre brunch.

The place seems pretty cool, but once you sit down and start eating, the allure of the decorations and swankiness seem to just fade.  You leave with a lighter wallet and an unsatisfied belly.

Note: For being a new place you would expect decent facilities right?  Well my girlfriend comes back from the restroom and tells me that the lock wasn't working and that some girl had almost walked in on her using the restroom.  Ladies beware!

4587818,2011-06-14,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Admittedly, part of the reason I may be a little hard on this place is because I was planning on spending about seven bucks on a slice of pizza and a diet coke at the hidden pizza place in the Cosmopolitan before exiting Vegas, but a last second swerve turned into throwing down over $30 here instead.  Anyway you look at it though, I just don't think this place was all that great.  

Although the whole concept of having Chinese & Mexican food on the same menu might sound interesting, at the end of the day it's not as if the menu here is combining the flavors of both cuisines into some sort of fusion dishes (THAT would be interesting...I'm not sure if it would be any good, but interesting).  The menu is essentially divided into Chinese & Mexican sections.  

I decided to go w/Mexican.  I had two two tacos & well as chips and salsa to be exact.  I had a chicken mole taco, which was okay.  I'm a huge fan of mole sauce, and I can't put my finger on what it was exactly, but I just wasn't a huge fan of the mole here.  part of the problem was I think they used too much of it.  It pretty much drenched the chicken.  I also had a fish taco.  It was nothing special, pretty much your run of the mill fish taco.  I was just looking to get a little food in my system before hopping on flight and not expecting to get a full meal.  That's exactly what I got.  Each taco was about two or three bites.  As for the chips and salsa...once again nothing special.  One of my dining companions went the Chinese route.  She got soup and some sort of gyoza, which I tried and thought was kind of greasy (she felt the same and felt her soup was okay).  

Between three of us we spent about $90.  One dining companion ordered the same two tacos I did and we split the chips and salsa (the third got the soup & gyoza).  A big portion of our bill was the diet cokes we ordered (which  were a necessity IMO after all the alcohol we consumed over the weekend).  They were $5 a pop each for an 8 oz bottle and we each had two.

The food at China Poblano isn't horrible, and the small portions are what's expected, but I still wasn't a big fan of this place...",W5cwxNwGiZJd393PCDQEvA,1,0,2,k8I4DCbFbQP1PJHGN3A2nQ
4593239,2013-08-26,4,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I absolutely LOVE the concept at China Poblano -- Chinese and Mexican food served side by side, with no fusion -- but I was also apprehensive about the middling reviews.

I'm glad I swept my apprehension under the rug because my lunch here was wonderful!

Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, China Poblano is bright and inviting, with lots of color and neon and bold decorative touches.  (I dig the giant walk-through Buddha in lieu of a door.)  It's one of Chef Jose Andres' casual joints, in contrast to the fancier Jaleo and é upstairs.  The place fills up fast at lunchtime, but I was lucky enough to score a seat at the bar without waiting at around 11:30am on a Saturday.

The menu is divided into Chinese and Mexican small plates.  Everything is served tapas-style.  Nothing is particularly authentic, but what do you expect in a Las Vegas hotel-casino?

I started with one of the specials of the day -- elote and squash blossoms.  Loved the flavors and textures, especially the crunchy bits of elote sprinkled throughout.  Everything was very fresh, light, and enjoyable.

Next, I had the dan dan mian (wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce and peanuts).  This was a good complement to the elote, because its profile of flavors and textures was the diametric opposite.  The noodles were rich and heavy -- probably too heavy for most people.  The spicy pork sauce was almost like thick clay in consistency.  I didn't mind, but I'm also not sure if that was intentional or not.

I washed my lunch down with China Poblano's specialty beverage of the house -- the salt air margarita (spiked with pomegranate).  This was a unique take on a classic cocktail, with a salty foam on top in lieu of the traditional salt rim.  Very refreshing.

Bar service is very upbeat and friendly -- and so are the other patrons!  Everyone eating here seems to be coming or going in an alcohol-induced haze, so expect revelry.

Prices are definitely high.  I'm still smarting over that $14 margarita.

I was skeptical about eating a fried pork bun but it went really well with the condensed milk sauce. The other dish we tried was the dan dan mian. This dish was the most disappointing to me. The portion is pretty small, I didn't like the flavor and it was way too salty! We sat outside the restaurant and service was pretty good.

I ordered the Silencio, the taco with duck tongue with lychee. It was a little on the salty side, but the flavors complimented each other. Definitely spicy!

Ordered When Pigs Fly, which was your basic bao (steamed pork bun). Nothing special really. Linda small to what I am personally used to back home.

The Dan Dan Moan noodle was noodles in a self-mix sauce noodle dish. It was alright. The sauce was kinda plain, noodles more doughy than expected. Not bad, worth a try.

Ordered the Ocean's Nest. Okay, it was Hong Kong style pan fried chow mein, with lobster. Still not impressed and definitely not worth $46.

The Empanada de Pollo con Mole Poblano was really good. The mole was complex, savory, rich, and authentic tasting. The outside was crispy, and the meaty filling was cooked just right.

For dessert, the Mango Sticky Rice was hyped up by our server. She described it as ""light and refreshing,"" which it totally was. The rice was actually toasted rice krispies sprinkled on too of a coconut creme whipped topping. The mango underneath was so sweet and delectable, very nice finish to the meal.

4656408,2016-08-09,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"One star is one stars too many, which is a bummer considering how excited I was for their menu selections -- Spanish and Hong Kong style dishes are two of my favorite profiles. Needless to say, I am more than willing to spend $30 on a plate of noodles when the chef is renowned and the menu is enticing. ""Never judge a book by its cover"" has never rang so true. While the food was ok, it wasn't worth the service, money or time wasted. I literally regret not going to the burger place next door. (Ew.) The pork buns were the best out of the 3 dishes we ordered (Hong Kong style soup and BBQ Pork noodles). 

Here'e the thing. If my review was based solely on the food, maybe I would have given 2-3 stars for presentation and taste (come on, heat the damn noodles up.) But based on the service, staff and overall experience I had -- I would give negative stars. Never, in my life have I been treated so poorly by a restaurant. Let's start with the hostesses who took one look at us and decided to make us sit out on the patio instead of inside. OK, fine, we just came from the pool and although we were completely covered, I can understand. She then told us it would be ""a while"" to get service. Except there was nobody there, so why would it take a while? I went ahead and asked her for water instead of waiting. Waiting for menus and water in 100+ degree weather is unacceptable, especially in an empty restaurant. My friend has food sensitivities and wasn't able to choose anything off the menu, she went next door to get food which she was able to eat - told the hostess she would be back. She comes back and the hostess BLOCKS her physically from coming in and says ""you can't come in here."" 

My friend, whose bachelorette party it was over the weekend was intoxicated, alone and turned away without any reasoning or exception. I don't care what your 'rule' is, if a young female, alone and intoxicated is turned away from being with her group because of a hostess on a power trip, the ethic and moral compass of the company which employs her is seriously in question. We don't live in a world (ESPECIALLY in Vegas) where that should be tolerated. I asked for the manager, which again, I was told would take a while. When he finally comes over and apologizes but tells me she can't come eat with someone else's food, I said she wasn't even eating, just waiting to come back and sit with us until we were done and could leave. But did we have a chance to explain? Nope. He then tells me that if I would have came and gotten him earlier he could have made an exception -- but it took 10 minutes for him to get off his ass and see where the customer complain was happening?? RIGHT. Then apologizes, brings me my bill and leaves. Yes, I am infuriated at this point and seriously considering not paying my bill. (I paid, out of sheer respect for the industry and personal ethos.) I however, did not tip. 

Here's the best part: A waiter, who was not our waiter came to pick up the check, noticed that I didn't leave a tip and asked what my problem was. I kindly told him that I didn't have a good experience and that it wasn't personal, it was my experience. He slammed the check on the table, crossed his arms and got very close to me and said that ""he shouldn't be treated like this because of my experience."" He proceeded to get in my face and I got up and left. The hostess condescendingly said ""bye."" WOW. For a city that thrives on hospitality it sure seems that they would put more effort into customer service. 

My company travels to Las Vegas anywhere from 5 -10 times per year for week long trips and we base our food & beverage allotment, hotel reservations and accommodations off of past and present experiences -- I can tell you now that our annual budget will NEVER be put towards this restaurant or The Cosmopolitan hotel ever again. No person should ever feel that they are not worthy of customer service. Best of luck to the chef, the concept is promising but with a staff like this you won't last.

We started with some drinks. I had the ""salt air"" margarita -- and oh my. This works a lot better than salt around the rim because you can just get a mouthful of the salt while drinking. The undesired effect is that you might get a ""milk mustache"" after you drink it, but hey, it's cute, right? Definitely a must-try if you like margaritas.

The food here is served in small plates, so it's a good idea to share everything so you get to try a bunch of stuff. We ordered quite a few things to share, and some of them, unfortunately, were on the saltier side (smoking chef?), but other than that everything tasted good.

Of all the things, I recommend trying the siu mai (thin skin, delicious pork), the chile en nogata (the walnut cream really made the dish) and the lamb potstickers (it's got that crispy lace which is oh so hard to make!). They have a few items with the Shirley Lee family XO sauce, but I'm not a fan of that...I prefer other brands' XO sauce much better. If you like handmade noodles, you might want to try them here too -- while they're not the best I've had, they were hearty and rustic, and will surely win a few hearts.

Yes, the decor is a little odd. Seems like the space in the center was wasted with a large display, but I thought the rest of it worked in a modern eclectic way. I had great service both nights too. The food seemed to be priced to compete with other nicer Vegas restaurants.

When you go in the bathrooms, the ""wall paper"" is a combination of chinese and mexican currencies, which was really cool. Great ambiance. The food was good also. 

CON: I don't know why I expected this place to have bigger portions for the prices, but my single little lobster taco was $10. My mom and I came here because we were starving and we didn't want to pay $25-$30 to go to a buffet, but in the long run it would have been a savings compared to how much food we had to order to fill us up at Chino Poblano. Everything is served tapas style - little plates, so it is very pretty and nicely presented (just expensive). If you're watching your cash I'd say don't come here, but it's nice if someone else is footing the bill for you or if you don't have to worry about cost. Otherwise to feel satisfied with what you eat, you'll prob pay at least $50 pp.",DZiuvJrrBxbihNm8z6FtjQ,1,1,3,zQYOi83v8137CvwcaZh33A

First, we had trouble finding this place coming from off the street. At the time, there was a bit of construction going on outside the hotel, so that definitely led to the confusion, but it's sort of tucked away with a few other places in the back corner of the hotel. 

Second, this place was frigid cold and mostly empty and it appeared that management was interviewing people at a vacant table on the side. Don't you have a private room where that can be done? 

The food portions are very small and just not that tasty.  I had the Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice dish that was around $20 and it was just meh. 

Service was ok. Nothing to write home about. My husband got a real Mexican Coke which was cool and he enjoyed but of course, that wasn't cheap.

The restaurant name hints at Fusion, though if I had done any reading I would have realized that the restaurant is not positioning itself as fusion style but rather as Chinese and Mexican side by side. This is a good idea, as it can satisfy groups of people with multiple cravings or be a good settler in a ""where to eat"" article. 

Surroundings were nice, though the heavy stools with no handles have to be coaxed out from under the table and are on the uncomfortable side. Not a place to linger for long in my opinion as it is not relaxing ergonomically. 

Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, though the ""we're Tapas style and recommend 2-3 dishes per person"" line they volunteer in advance to all diners, seems to ring as more of a minimum spending request, than it does as a guide to dining satisfaction. Each ""Tapa"" runs an average of $15-$17. The one negative in the service area was the busboy who was almost OCD in his desire to rush unfinished plates off the table. I had to finally tell him that we would let him know when we were done with a plate.

Okay, so if the food were good, the nitpicky items above may not have even been mentioned. Sadly it is not. The Spring Rolls were greasy and mushy inside. The dipping sauce actually made it more unpleasant. The Lamb Postickers seemed like a great idea and were set up fine texturally, but the heavy handed cumin made it seem as if I were eating a cumin dumpling, not lamb....and I like cumin. The Beef Siu Mai was non-descript and forgettable. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were so underportioned for the price with tiny and sparsely placed chicken bits, that this is where I began going from ""not the best place"" to ""I'm a sucker."" The Glass Noodles with Chicken featured the same chicken bits and was somewhat over salted, but we did actually enjoy it, though it was the final dish and we were already a big jaded. 

$120 later with tip and tax. The kicker here is that Jose Andres' name is what sold us entering the place. Now I realize that just like Wolfgang Puck, the name is not a guarantee for a great meal. Gems for restaurants with duds sprinkled in. This one is ....a dud.",n2ieuOZei4ZQXf56kOPxJg,2,0,2,fcOSHn3VgmAY_J0iiyALzg

Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):
Food: 5 stars
Drinks: 5 stars
Atmosphere: 5 stars
Service: 5 stars
Price: 4 stars

The food is a marriage of Mexican and Asian cuisine. It's unique, and it's delicious. My favorites are the guacamole (medium style has just the right amount of kick); When Pigs Fly (steamed pork buns); Shrimp Mojo (shrimp with sweet black garlic and roasted poblano peppers); pork belly taco, lobster taco, tuna ceviche, and, the all-star, the chocolate terra cotta warrior. It's a chocolate mouse filled warrior-shaped chocolate with ginger ice cream, cookie crumbs, and caramelized banana. It is the most unique dessert I have ever had. Yes, ever. You have to order it. and you won't be disappointed.

Drinks: Food: The margaritas are phenomenal. You should get a pitcher.

Atmosphere: Vibrant, lively, and fun. 

Service: 5 starts. All the servers I've had have been knowledgeable and attentive. Food starts coming out almost right away and continues to come out as it's ready. The hostesses are friendly too.

Price: It's not a cheap place, but it's worth the extra $ because the food is so good. Just not a place to come if you're on a budget. Definitely a place to come if you value a great meal.

First let me say that I am a big fan of Jose Andres. I ate at Bazaar and Jaleo multiple times and love it.. so I decided to stop by China Poblano for lunch today.
I sat at the bar and my waitress was very friendly. I had the agua Fresca based on her recommendation and it was delicious. I also tried the Lemon Drop and it was very nice. I quickly ordered a Gazpacho and the quail... And it went downhill from there.
Let me first say that the place was NOT busy at all... 
It took at least 25 mn to get the gazpacho. My waitress apologized and I told her that it was not a big deal and things happen. Now, call me difficult but if the first course took much longer than expected, you would think that they would make sure that the next course doesnt? Wrong.. Bottom line is, I placed my order at 11:45am.. I received my second course at 12:25pm. During the whole time, no manager approached me nothing, I finally lost patience and asked one of the waitstaff to check on it. He did but came back behind the bar without saying a word to me... So I asked him again and without looking at me said "" it is going to be a few more minutes... "". I pointed out to him that the couple next to me came later , ate and was already gone. The brought me chips and salsa. 
And the quail? Well, no one really checked on me to see if I was happy with it.. some of it was raw. For most part the dish was pretty boring. A piece of dragon fruit in the middle and 4 small pieces of fried quail. Big deal. Obviously I am upset. I think that they missed the mark as to how to handle guest complains.

The traditional had some gold leaf on top and the scallop was topped with tobiko. The beef wasn't too appetizing for me. The flavor combination of whatever was in the beef didn't work for me. 

Next up were some tacos and the Chinese street sandwich. For the tacos we had fish barbacoa, carnitas and silencio. They were all just a little better than the tacos at a traditional taco stand. The duck tongue was a nice spicy treat that you don't usually see.

Been to several of the places here (DOCG, Beauty and Essex, Eggslut and Henry) and this was right up there. It's a little stuck between casual and more upscale but for me that means pretty inclusive. It's termed a mix of Mexican and Chinese but leans more heavy Asian. What you notice upon entry is that they have two large areas for noodle, bun, egg roll and tortilla making from scratch. I sat at the bar since I was Lonely Guy traveling solo and got to watch the process of the bun and noodle making by hand. I was hoping for a TV to avoid awkward alone guy but it was fascinating seeing these guys make the doughs by scratch. That led me to try the steamed pork bun for appetizer. So awesome. I started out saying I would only eat one of the four large buns but ended up eating two and the filling of the other two. Perfect steamed texture and pork BBQ filling. Best Chinese invention since karate/Jackie Chan. Next I went with the Mongolian beef lettuce dinner. I thought it would be like a lettuce wrap but ended up being more like a steak salad but very tasty surprise. Beef was very tender with great soy sweet flavor on rope of smaller cut romaine that made my no carb desire a reality (you don't worry about the pork buns in the first part of this review - who are you- my Mom?).

20 vegetables fried rice which is their signature dish and they offered to make it without eggs & oyster sauce
Col de Bruselas - caramelized brussel sprouts
Guacamole with fresh tortillas
We even ordered the Papas Fritas which we weren't a fan of and they promptly took it back without any questions and even offered to get something else. 
The food in general was pretty good but slightly over salted for our taste. 

We were a bit skeptical to try this out considering some reviews but our experience was good! Will definitely return. We've enjoyed our experience at other Jose Andres restaurants.",6gkFp1xOSMh8cXdBsRXvZg,0,0,4,bwhJZs4mDJzwSwXRfeVhWQ

We picked 2 cocktails to start, the unique twist on a classic, Mexican gin & tonic and a Jade Garden. Both were enjoyable. 

For the meal we picked 2 from China, 2 from Mexico. Our favorite from the Lucky 6 Sui Mai was the beef with the traditional a close second. The scallop lack the flavor the others did. The steamed pork buns were spot on. The Caldo Talpeño soup had great flavor with a nice touch of heat. Our ceviche citrico was pleasant though was least exciting of the dishes we chose. 

If we chose dessert, it would have been a full order of the beef Sui Mai.

For some things there is a reasonable price and for some things not at all. We snacked on the lotus chips and they were great. We got the lamb gouza which sounded good but didn't blow us away. I liked it more than my BF did. The duck fluatas on the special menu sounded interesting and the mole was good but the duck was dry and lacked that fatty rich duck flavor. It was a disappointment. The BF said both of his tacos were pretty good. The stand out was the shu mai sampler. They were REALLY delicious. It was around 65 dollars before tip for two tacos, lotus chips, gouza, shu mai and fluatas and no drinks. Honestly we could eat a lot of really delicious things in Las Vegas for less and I am a person who would happily pay more for food it it delivered in both quality and taste. You could tell the quality was there, the taste was inconsistent across our dishes and that leaves me feeling like there was not a value to our meal.

4821967,2014-01-29,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I'm really surprised this place has only three stars. The boy and I came here on our last night in Vegas and it was easily the best meal we'd had all weekend. Since I imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, I'll break down what we had:

Salt and Air Margarita: probably the best margarita I've ever had

Taro chips: unbelievable. We ordered these for our ceviche, but I was gobbling them up on their own. Insanely crisp and delicious.

Tuna Ceviche: delicious. And quite a large portion for the price. The only complaint I might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. Might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.

Siu Mai w/ Quail Eggs: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai I've ever had. And trust me, I live in Queens in NYC, I know my Asian food. The meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.

Pork Buns (When Pigs Fly): disappointing. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun I come across. Not necessarily bad, but not great.

Duck Tongue Taco (Silencio): I am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. I commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing. 

Beef Tendon Taco (Viva China): Outstanding. The beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. The sauce is delicious. 

Carnitas Taco: My absolute favorite. I've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco. 

Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice: this one was interesting. First of all, I should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so I sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. I bet that would really add to the flavor. However, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. At first I thought ""meh, it's fried rice,"" but with each subsequent bite, I began to realize, ""wait, this is the BEST FRIED RICE I'VE EVER HAD."" Every bite had a new vegetable. And the boy literally licked the bowl clean. 

Chocolate Teracotta Warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with SOME kind of dessert. The presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but I could've done without this one. I have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.

The service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. And the vibe of the place was very nice. Casual, but upscale.

My friend is a huge fan of the chef who created this restaurant so we came here at her request. 

I ordered three tacos:

Viva China (beef tendon and oysters) $5.50: Delicious! A very strange combination especially when on a taco, but hot damn was it good (yeah, I just said hot damn).

Lengua (beef tongue) $4: REALLY delicious! Easily the best flavored beef tongue I've ever had. 

Carnitas (pork, green sauce, and pork rinds) $4.50: I was a bit thrown off by the pork rind, but it really worked! Its a hard call, but this was probably my favorite taco.

The three were pretty darn small, but hey they were bomb.

The traditional Sui Mai (mini dumplings) were really good. But everything else I tasted food-wise was just ok. 

The drinks however were all delicious. Great selection and bar tending.

This time my wife and I came for lunch while the Cosmopolitan was getting our room ready.  The restaurant has one of the cooler buildouts in town - stylish and chic yet still comfortable.  The design aesthetic borrows from Chinese and Mexican traditions, much like the menu.  What was interesting to us was that we didn't sense much ""fusion"" between the two traditions - they menu is segregated between Chinese and Mexican dishes.  We had a mix, but no single dish we had really fused the two cusines.

Let's start off with a story.  Just after we sat down, a party of 4 sat next to us.  After a quick look at the menu they asked the server why they didn't see quesadillas and burritos.  The server explained that China Poblano's Mexican fare comes from the cuisine of Southern Mexico, while they were thinking more about the food along the US border.  The server expertly encouraged them to give the place a try, and they wouldn't be disappointed.  No dice - they got up and left anyway.  The server told us that happens a lot.

That was their loss.  We started with the special Chicken Tinga Tacos with chorizo, onions and potatoes, which my wife and I LOVED.  The potatoes in particular made the tacos, and they went great with the sauce, one of my favorites in the Mexican lexicon.

We also really enjoyed the Don't Be Jealous Hot and Sour Soup.  This was not your traditional Chinese hot and sour soup - the color was much darker, the sesame flavor really popped, as did the cilantro.  It had much more depth than we expected and was almost smoky.  

Of the Lucky 6 Sui Mai, we liked the scallop sui mai the best, then the beef and then the traditional shrimp & pork.  All were delicious though, and sui mai is always a personal favorite, whatever anyone puts in it.  

The Shrimp Mojo was good too, but the shrimp was a little overwhelmed by the sweet black roasted garlic.  It was a good dish, but I'd have preferred a little bit more shrimp flavor.

We came mid afternoon so there weren't many people in the restaurant at all. We were seated quickly, and our waitress was attentive during our entire meal - big plus (service upped this place to the three stars I gave it). 

In terms of food, nothing really stood out. While looking at the menu, the only thing that sort of stood out to me were the taco combinations. Other than that, everything else on the menu was very much either a Chinese dish or a Mexican fish. Not much fusion going on with the menu items. My sister and I ordered more than enough for the both of us. I'd say we tried a little bit of each type of dish offered. I was not impressed by any of it. The only thing that I remember was the golden pigs entree, which consisted of fried bbq pork buns served with condensed milk. Strange combination with the condensed milk but it worked really well. 

I wouldn't recommend this place but if you're dying to give it a try, I'd suggest going with different tacos if you want the whole Chinese Mexican fusion experience.",9zJ3okFLCpHVspc8g0sWlw,0,0,3,8gwAta-joeDkWtqQN_oVVA

Don't get the ""hot and sour soup"" unless you want to contract instant hypertension. They might as well rename the dish to Salt and Sour Soup. 

Tuna ceviche, also salty AF. Whoever seasoned this was over zealous with the salt. It's so salty it is almost rendered inedible. 

The Dian Dian Mien... did we only order a half portion??? For $14, you'd figure you would get more than what appears 14 noodles. $1/noodle??? Portion size is overwhelmingly disappointing. Also, SALTY AF.

Mongolian Beef Lettuce... HELLA EFFIN SALTY!!!!! I get that lettuce tends to be bland, but there's no need to drown the lettuce in salty ass sauce. 

Cheese Fundido was cool. Tastes like tequila! 

Traditional Shui Mai was ok. (Cost value, no bueno. Gold flakes does not compensate) only eat 1 piece... the 2nd one is too salty! 

Har Gow was ok. Smallest har gow I have ever seen! 

Sticky Lotus Rice was ok. Well, the first bite or two. Then it also becomes too salty. 

Pozole was pretty good! 

Piss poor choice for tea cups. Cast iron???? You guys know it conducts heat, right??? So you end up with a hot AF cup. FAIL. The cup is so hot you're burning your fingers to pick it up.

It sounded like the perfect place for my husband (Hispanic) and I (Chinese), but it ended up to be a very disappointing meal. My husband has been there once. He warned me about the food wasn't that good, but we felt like I had to try at least once. 

We started with the chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and crispy. The salsa was fine, but nothing special. We have had much better salsa in other places. 

We had three tacos. The homemade corn tortillas were great. LENGUA (beef tongue) was very delicious. The tongue was tender and the salsa was refreshing. Best thing of the night. Silencio (duck tongue) was disappointing. It was a taco with Chinese cooking style and flavors. Sadly, the flavors just didn't go well with the tortilla. Kind of weird. Pescado a la Plancha (fish) was ok. Just a fish taco. Nothing amazing. 

For dim sum, we got the traditional siu mai. $13.88 for 6 siu mai? They better be good! My husband liked them, but they were just ok for me. The filling were a bit loose. The siu mai fell apart easily after one bite. I felt that I am paying for the gold flakes more than anything. Please take away the gold flakes and give me some decent and cheap siu mai! We also had the lamb pot stickers stuck on you. I was very exciting about pot stickers, especially lamb one. Not only we can't taste the lamb, the spice seasoning overpowered everything. The spice didn't taste anything like Chinese or Mexican food. It was more like Indian flavors. Other than the crispy skins, we didn't like these at all. 

We also got the 18 MONK NOODLES. I think they have switched this out of the menu now. But it was very tasty. I like hand cut noodles, because they are usually al dente. And these noodles were. The flavors were earthy and savory. We enjoyed it. 

At the end, we paid about $65 (without tax & tips). All the food we ordered were nothing fancy. You can get all these food in a Mexican or Chinese restaurant for just half the price.

When an internationally known chef puts his name of a restaurant one expects a certain level of well prepared food and professional service. Neither of these things exist at this restaurant which led me to ponder whether Mr. Andres had ever visited his own restaurant to sample some of the food here. 

This restaurant features a unique idea of combining Mexican and Chinese dishes existing in tandem on the same menu. Unfortunately this fresh take on offering two different cuisines on one menu does not materialize on the plate. We ordered a variety of dishes from both the Mexican menu and the Chinese menu starting  with Guacamole which was so heavily seasoned with lime juice as to make it off-putting and unappealing. The pork belly and pineapple taco, served in a flimsy and very small tortilla (5"" diameter), was layered with one tiny shaving of pineapple so thin you could read through it and an equally thin shaving of pork belly with a dab of red sauce and a shred of lettuce. I could go on and on about the equally disappointing Chinese dishes we ordered but I'll spare the reader. As a final word, I've had better Chinese food from my local strip-mall Chinese take-out joint for 75% less money. My advise: avoid this place. The quality of the food is poor and grossly overpriced.

4891132,2014-07-24,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Spent our 24th anniversary at China Poblano and we were so, so satisfied.  But be warned this is a trendy ""small plate"" big price restaurant which means both your wallet and your stomach could be left empty. However, the food is delicious, the atmosphere fun and the service impeccable, if a bit pretentious (each food runner describes the dish you just ordered as they deliver it to your table in case you are so drunk on their incredible tequila offerings that you need reminding). 

China Poblano offers both Mexican and Chinese dishes side by side, hence the name.  I was hoping for more of a fusion concept but dove in with all tastebuds firing. 

Number one: Get the carnitas taco.  At $5.50 it is moist, flavorful and meaty!  Yes there should be at least 2 if not 3 tacos for that price but trust me, ignore the price and just order a lot of these! 

The guacamole and warm tortillas are delicious and filling.  The quail egg shumai are great and you get 6 of them in one order.  The pozole is good and satisfying, not the best I've had but good.  The dan dan noodles were earthy tasting and not my favorite although the actual noodles were wonderful, the topping tasted of pungent, ground earth, maybe not bad, but not my taste.

For dessert, we ordered the churros with Oaxacan chocolate.  This was off.  The churros were flavorless and not sweet enough although the texture was right.  The chocolate was bad.  The flavor was mingled with an unrecognizable savory, spice that we didn't care for at all.  

Had a fabulous 1.5 oz. pour of tequila.  Their tequila menu is extensive and organized by Highland and Lowland brands.  Also their take on the classic margarita is really fun with a salty foam topping that is delicious for those who enjoy a salted margarita.  

The prices are ridiculous which is why I am not giving the place 5 stars. But it's the new Vegas and long gone are the crappy $1.99 buffets about which I am certainly not complaining.  However, it seems we've moved to the opposite end of the spectrum, serving higher quality food while gouging people with prices 4 times the actual cost of the ingredients.

I was tempted to grab dim sum, but seeing how overpriced it is tuned me out.  Instead, I grabbed the only sandwich on the menu.  However, it ended up being a small bun compared to the price-to-quantity ratio I had expected.  Though since this is Vegas, I probably should have lowered my standards even lower.

I grew up  eating home-cooked authentic Mexican food  and this place somehow not only matches but surpasses that experience !  If you are looking for good Mexican food this is the place ! My fave items so far: guac w/tortillas, tamale, ceviche, lotus chips, and tacos( my favorite tacos are the Carnitas and the napoles)

Some things are meant to be shared like the guac, ceviche, etc.  Others like tacos are more of an individual item.  The guac comes with tortillas which are delicious but I always get ceviche which comes with tortilla chips and I also get a side of lotus chips so I have an assortment of things to dip in my guac haha.  

 For chinese I reccomend the 20 vegetable fried rice.  I tend to stick to the Mexican side of the menu just because I love Mexican food haha but seriously you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.  

For dessert, I highly recommend the mango sticky rice, their rendition is so unique and delicious.

Everything is prepared in open Chef stations so you know they are keeping things clean!  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  I try to eat here every chance I can.  I still have so many more things I want to try!",HQF6pQ9mC52J3BEEDSevOw,3,1,5,7beV8-pwGHxz8PZyRjxz1w

I came here with a great friend from Hong Kong so the expectations were good quality Chinese food.

The food was very average with there signature ""20 vegetable fried rice"" for $19.88 being nothing more than your average fried rice that was actually over-seasoned with oyster sauce making it terribly salty and almost unpalatable. 

The pork buns were average but (4) for $13.88 was hefty price to pay for average dim sum pork buns.

The hot and sour soup had a strong after taste. 

The service was good and quick. The food came out very quickly which made us wonder if it was all prepared before hand.

One MUST TRY is the the drinks! I highly recommend Jose Andres' margarita . They had option to add pomegranate and that was just one amazing creation.

It's located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  I felt for Vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.
Miller D was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and I believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. He recommended the Sueno Cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. He was kind enough to do Half/Half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. Both my friend and I really enjoyed the drink.

The main thing I was dying to try was this taco that I read about called The Viva China Taco , but we also ordered a Happy Family Jiaozi  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and Golden Pigs ( Fried Pork Buns) and some Beijing Glass noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). Overall I LOVED EVERYTHING except that Taco I wanted so badly to try. When it first arrived I took a bite of the Beef Tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top I felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. It just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. Maybe I got a bad oyster I don't know but overall it was an experience I will not quickly forget.

Everyone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. The only reason I have to deduct a star is I somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. Thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and I am dealing with that situation but I definitely feel like this place is worth checking out!

I ordered 3 tacos: Lengua, Barbacoa, and Carnitas. The meats/fillings were dry and the combination of items (marinated onions, salsa, etc) were bland and didn't add any flavor to the overall bite. Definitely didn't leave me wanting more than I ordered.

Dan Dan Mian is probably the most decent dish we had but the portion was TINY. It should be an appetizer instead of an entrée.

The Mongolian Beef Lettuce was more like a bed of romaine lettuce with some overcooked steak tips on top. Can totally skip this dish. 

Guacamole was decent and queso tasted like melted pizza cheese.

We shared the restaurant's version of hot and sour soup, which was spicy and creative and delicious.  I ate most of it.  Then we ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice and the bok choy.  The twenty vegetable fried rice, for all the youtube videos we'd seen about it, was a bit of a let-down, because there was a lot less veggies than the promo's had celebrated.  It was also a bit oily, which was a surprise, as I figured they'd had that part perfected.  The flavor was good.  The bok choy was also interesting, as it had a bit of citrus flavor, and it was thoughtfully prepared and not overcooked.  We also tried the guava agua fresca, which was refreshing and not too sweet.
Overall the food was better than good, and the service was great.  However, the place looks like a fast food joint from the outside, totally degrading its menu.

Drinks-Singapore Sling- Traditionally made and perfect! (where did these go America)

Salt Air Margariita- Crazy good with a salt flavored foam.

Apart from the way overpriced food, I was surprised to see that someone forged a generous and undeserved 30% tip on my credit card bill, when I clearly left 15% on the receipt.

The waiter was kind and willing, however his recommendations all fell flat on the palate. While the food was beautifully presented the taste was not impressive at all. We started with the Carnitas tacos which were bland and extremely oily. Next came the Lamb potstickers. The lamb filling was also not seasoned. Lastly we ordered the food network recommended 20 vegetable dish and added shrimp. Again the protein was bland and unseasoned. While the rice was somewhat tasty, it was not something to rave about. At the conclusion of our meal, we were somewhat shocked to see an $85 bill for the amount and quality of food that was ordered for 2 people. Despite the disappointing food, our waiter was nice and returned to our table multiple times to check on us. I believe this was mainly due to the fact that our order took a long time to arrive.

We're big fans of José Andrés, his restaurants, and his food.  However, despite multiple trips to Las Vegas, we hadn't yet dined at China Poblano.  Arriving around a little after 8PM, we had to wait a few minutes for seating at the bar to come available.

After a quick look over the menu, we decided to keep the decision-making process simple and have the Chef's Experience tasting menu ($45/person) with the Cocktail Experience ($32/person).  We received a nice selection of food from across the menu (Chips & Salsa, Tuna Ceviche Spoon, Siu Mai, Snow Pea Leaf Salad Carnitas Tacos, Shrimp Mojo, Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice, and Mango Sticky Rice).  Likewise, we received four, tasting sized (thankfully), cocktails from the cocktail menu (Salt Air Margarita, Ma, Jade Garden, and Mezcal Negroni) representing both Mexican and Chinese elements.  We had also ordered the When Pigs Fly (steamed barbecue pork buns), a supplemental item to the menu, which we didn't receive.  However, our gracious server, brought us a Churro in Oaxacan Hot Chocolate, to make up for the service oversight.  It was completely unnecessary, but much appreciated and a positive reflection of the restaurant's focus on customer satisfaction.  Going the tasting menu route worked well for us to sample as much of the menu as possible without leaving the restaurant uncomfortable full and/or inebriated.

Did China Poblano break any new ground or do anything better than traditional Chinese or Mexican restaurants?  Not so much.  I've certainly had better Chinese and Mexican food elsewhere and in most cases at a much lower price.  However, that's misses the point of China Poblano and why we went there for dinner.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience that honored both Chinese and Mexican cuisine with thoughtfully conceived and well executed food.  The same goes with the outstanding cocktails.  However, it was the service was the one facet of our experience that truly impressed and set China Poblano apart from most restaurants.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,5,5,4,m15P-nc6kb4Vvl2GOvd_Yw

5032490,2013-12-27,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We were visiting from Out Of Town over Christmas and saw this place on one of the Hotel Channels in our room. I am a huge foodie, as is my partner and this place caught our eye as being a GREAT IDEA. 

My boyfriend LOVES Dim Sum and all things Chinese Food while I am a BBIIGGGG fan of Latin Food, especially Ceviche. 

While wandering the mall Christmas day we stumbled onto this spot by pure chance and decided to jump all over it. We were seated right away and initially noticed and beautiful decor. Whomever designed the inside of this place really had a solid idea in mind, the colours are bright and the themes meshes well with the Asian/ Mexican fusion. 

We ordered the drink we had seen on the ad, which was there Salt Air Margarita. It was really yummy. The Salt Foam really does coat the tongue and give you a very different experience as far as margarita drinking goes.  

For our food we ordered the Dim Sum Pot Stickers and the Ceviche plus a Taco. 

Dim Sum - Fair. Needed more flavor, stuffed with enough meat, but was lacking a solid taste.

Ceviche - Bad. We had the Snapper ceviche. It was so very bland, almost no flavor. I had to ask for Lime wedges to add onto the dish to give it some flavor. There was ZERO spice, and I am fairly sensitive to spicy foods. I'd HIGHLY recommend they add some sort of cirtus to their Cevich. 

Taco -  Decent. Meat had solid taste and was really tender, the tortilla was grand. 

Over all, it's a really great idea to fuse these two cuisines, I just think the technique missed the mark a little. They seem to carter to a specific type of person who doesn't seem to explore a lot of foods and it would be great to see them branch out and add more true flavors.

Come for the drinks. Not for the food.",0gGcIkHOTDMl_6p5RGnuFw,1,0,2,99j4mNyqJdkJBHcO-gF8zg

The decor is modern, kitsch, and very inviting. Seating is limited at night, so make sure to make a reservation. The food here is actually not ""fusion"", per se, as asian-inspired and Mexican dishes are served on their own, and not ""mixed"". So, you can order pork dumplings and carnitas tacos separately. I believe this idea is lazy, but I would rather have well executed authentic food, rather than a failed attempt at some fusion. The Cochinita Pibil tacos are delicious, perfectly seasoned and very authentic. They taste very similar to what to would eat at the Yucatan peninsula. Of course, here they are way overpriced and served on a special taco gadget that keeps tacos standing up (to prevent spillage, I would assume). The Barbacoa tacos are also very authentic tasting, as well as the Pork Belly tacos. We also tried the 20-vegetable Fried Rice, as we'd previously seen someone on the Food Network claim it was the ""best thing they ever ate"" in Las Vegas. I would not go as far as saying it was the best thing here, but it is delicious. The ""Mexican mimosas"" are also very refreshing, though there is no such thing as a ""Mexican mimosa""... The Margaritas, on the other hand, are modern and very tasty, as the salt element is done as a foam instead of only as a rim on the glass. Inventive and great. Do not order the Cajeta Flan, as it has NOTHING to do with a Mexican flan. I understand the chef was trying to add his own spin to this traditional dish, but I believe he should stick to what he knows best. It was nice, but it should not be named ""flan"", as it was more of a ""crema catalana"" (a typical dessert of the Catalunya region of Spain). The tortillas are hand-made, and you can reall taste the difference! I have to go back to try the Asian food. Overall, portions are tiny, so be prepared to order 4-5 per person.

Okay, so first off the server indicated to us that there were no scallops, no lobster and no crab so we had to change up our initial choices.  We ended up with the Mojo Shrimp, Steak Mole plate (I forget the name), sui mai quail eggs and sui mai scallop. So, the Mojo Shrimp was slightly undercooked and it tasted like it was doused in soy sauce reminding me of like Filipino adobo sauce (not in a good way).  The sauce was super salty.  We couldn't even finish the green beans in the sauce.  The Steak Mole plate according to my eating partner was cooked very good but it tasted like steak that I get in my local taco places around my apartment.  ( I live in the mission in SF so I'm surrounded by very satisfying Mexican food).  The mole sauce was pretty bland. The mushrooms and onions were super salty.  The sui mai was okay.  We were told that they could do scallop sui mai but we suspected that there were no scallops in it.  The quail egg sui mai was probably my favorite.  But again I live near a Chinese restaurant that does sui mai so I wasn't blown away. However, the quail egg was something I've never tried before and I wished that the whole experience was like that.

     quantity- super small portion 

lotus chips- only delicious part of entire meal, crisp & properly seasoned.

the rou jia mo sandwich was horrible- buns fall apart and are oily-- the ""braised"" pork was cut in cubes and was sooooooooo SALTY.  it seemed to be braised in nothing but soy sauce - lack of any asian/mexican seasoning it seems.  such a disappointment. 

tuna ceviche- lack of seasoning in initial bite and then salt creeps up on you slaps you in the face. 50%  nuts/filler fufu crap, no substantial amount tuna. absolutely disgusting. not what i imagined and chinese mexican ceviche to taste like, no explosion of flavor, lacked acidz 


second- service by server ""Franco"" was absolutely horrible. he was rushing the entire time as if there were more people to serve (place was practically empty). he grabbed our plates before being finished

Pescado Frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just OKAY, doesn't justify the cost. Beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --DIMSUM, I've had better.

I don't know if the kitchen was off that day but I rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. We got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.

Our bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure.

It's a restaurant designed for us, really - Mexican and Chinese. Not fusion, but three separate kitchens taking care of both of our food needs at once, without one of us sitting and watching the other eat. Being that it was José Andrés, we had high hopes, and they were met easily.

His plate: Papas Fritas with Mexican cream and queso fresco; Carnitas taco (braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda); Pescado Frito taco (fried fish, salsa Mexicana)

Her plate: ""When Pigs Fly"" - delicate steamed buns with Chinese barbecue pork; ""Ocean Nest"" - scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables; ""Salt Air Margarita""

To share: Chips and Salsa - fresh tortilla chips, house-made chipotle salsa

The chips and salsa were good, though nothing out of this world. The pork buns were the only actually disappointing part of the meal - the dough is a little gummy and maybe overworked - though the filling was flavorful and moist, and happily not over-salty. We ended up taking these home and they were better as cold leftovers in the middle of the night.

My pan-fried egg noodles were nice and crisp, with a deliciously oceany broth. There was no king crab, which I'd been looking forward to, but the shrimp had their heads on and were fantastically fresh. The bok choy was the perfect choice for the 'seasonal vegetable' and I'd definitely get this dish again. The ocean flavor was just so good.

The fries were described as good, but not memorable. D's tacos were both fantastic, full of flavor and great textural contrasts. The carnitas were not slimy, as they are at some restaurants, and were nicely accented by the pork rinds on top. Since we've been home, the tacos have been mentioned a few times.

5105794,2014-06-11,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"the food is good, the prices, not so good. 

i had the barbacoa taco, golden pigs, and quail egg siu mai. 

the barbacoa taco had a spicy, tender beef in it. it was $5 for a small taco, but what do you expect in vegas?

the golden pigs ($14.88/4 buns) are ""fried delicate steamed buns/Chinese barbeque pork/ condensed milk."" basically, fried bbq pork buns -- they're perfectly fried and not greasy at all. the meat inside was piping hot, flavorful, and the perfect mix of sweet and savory. the condensed milk is kind of thinner than what i'm used to, but it is the perfect complement to the sweet and savory bun. i'm undecided if this should be a dessert item or not, but it's that good. we had 2 orders of this. 

the quail egg siu mai has shrimp/pork/peanuts/ poached quail eggs --- basically, siu mai you'd get at dim sum, but with a perfectly poached quail egg on top. also costs 5x more than your average order of siu mai (6 pcs for $16.88!). 

also, get the monk chili sauce. it's a spicy chili oil to dip anything and everything in and it adds good flavor and heat. 

other favorites among my group include the duck tongue/lychee tacos (sweet and savory combo), and the viva china taco (beef tongue, kumamoto oyster, scallions). my bf also loved the lamb pot stickers, and he usually hates pot stickers that ""aren't made at home with TLC."" haha pot sticker snob. 

the prices here are definitely steep, but the food is good. you can really tell that every ingredient is fresh and high quality. there are unique flavors and items here, and if you're willing to splurge a bit, take some friends (it's small plates/tapas sized portions) and dig in.",zlqbbhAujrMla0eDiK7mIw,2,1,3,kjiYwkJ8fZ6-4yTQgDr0KA
5110117,2012-08-13,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Chinese food and Mexican food in one - what more could you ask for?

I'm honestly pretty shocked about the lack of positive reviews for China Poblano.  It's Vegas - everything is expensive and probably not big enough (insert double entendre here).  Stop your whining and realize it's tapas-style.  If you have 10 hungry bachelorette party girls like we were, order two of each type, eat family style, order a strong drink, and shut your trap.

For Vegas shu mai, I thought it was pretty good.  We ordered two servings of the Lucky 8, which I recommend so you can get a taste of each type of shu mai they serve. All were tasty and topped with something interesting, like radish or goji berry. The har gau was ok; I have had better. The Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup had a wonderful kick of spices. Drinks ordered included the Singapore Sling and the Lychee Sour, both of which were flavorful and interesting. I myself had vodka with fresh cantaloupe juice, which snuck up on you and hit you like an unruly child. Other dishes ordered at our table included a caesar salad (with way too much parmesan), When Pigs Fly, shrimp, and numerous tacos. As far as pork buns go, the When Pigs Fly was a little meh. I like the pork to be red and drier than this was.

The coup de grace of my palate was the Viva China taco. This is definitely the best non-traditional taco I've ever had. A taco with beef tendon and oyster - the crispiness of the tendon punctuated with the creamy oyster was mind-blowing. 

Lots of good tastes, a few mediocre tastes. But definitely deserving of a higher rating than the uno estrellas some other folks are giving. I'd go back.  Viva China Poblano!",QTsAZpgR1kKVDjOLJYa2MQ,0,1,4,rmQ1n_59s2CSzahlPiZEeA
5113515,2011-12-05,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We ended up here about twice in just as many days, because there was almost too much to try in one sitting.  They've got a couple open kitchen stations - one for some of the Mexican items and another with a huge steamer for the Chinese dumplings, plus an area for making noodles.  I have to say that at the rather odd hours we were in, we didn't see much more than a few egg rolls being wrapped, however.

They have a fairly large cocktail menu with some interesting, though confusing things, and notably have a couple Chinese beers by the bottle that I had not seen before.

We tried a couple tacos - Silencio, with duck tongue and lychee, was quite good, the duck tongue being very approachable.  Viva China, with tendon and oyster, was similarly unthreatening.  In general, though the flavors were good and the textures were decent, these tacos put so many different components together that they often got lost in each other.

Lamb Potstickers were good, and reasonably, but again not emphatically, lamby.

Huitlacoche Noodles were a little disappointing.  The noodles had a nice texture, but we had a hard time detecting much huitlacoche flavor.

The braised pork sandwich ( Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich ) was awesome, but about two bites.

We came back specifically to try the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice.  Expensive at $17.88, it is possible that they did in fact include 20 vegetables, cut into very small cubes, somewhere within the rather small portion.  But in the end it was just that:  fried rice.

We were hoping to see a lot more fusion on the menu, but most dishes were segregated onto one side or the other.  We enjoyed both our experiences - the servers were accommodating, though very casual, and there was a lot to look at in the space, from the cooking going on to the walls of offbeat art.  Overall, and keeping in mind that this is in a fancy hotel casino in the middle of the desert, the food is remarkably good for the location.",JjTusdmnjHxKe-Kqwr0YGA,2,1,4,JN0Vitaca_ifM6zATvfDtg

The tacos are pretty good but seriously these prices are absurd even by Vegas standards especially the portion size.  I can get tacos in many places in LA or OC for $1.25 that are many times superior (2 Guys, Taco Leo).  Taking aside these huge issues the tacos are good but not as authentic - I don't care how many abuelas you have making toritllas in the front of the house.

The Chinese food is like a more authentic version of PF Chang but dim sum style.  Again the food is tasty but about 3x in price of much better stuff I can get in dozens of places in SGV.

You have to try it to understand what I experienced.  I loved the barbacoa tacos and wished they were bigger but at least I had room to eat other things.  The carnitas taco was also good.

Wontons: I've been looking everywhere for this thin wrapper for my homemade wontons, but I'll happily pay for the ones at China Poblano. Perfectly crispy and crunchy, with a solidly delicious filling and the dark soy sauce is yummy. Ask for some chili sauce to up the flavor explosion. These really remind me of the wontons that I've had in Trinidad so I'm obsessed. 

Dan-Dan Mian: I liked this but the sauce was a bit salty for my taste and even though I mixed it, didn't feel like I was getting the right amount of pork/peanuts. That's probably user error. The hand cut noodles were perfect though. 

Siu Mai: the traditional siu mai was simply delicious pockets of heaven. This is a must try!

Mongolian Beef Lettuce: this was also delicious and a large portion. Loved the shishito peppers and the sauce was perfect. The beef filet tips were also perfectly marinated.",Krgb0K0z9WZs1YaXYJD5vw,2,1,5,k4TmwtGDarnZkhT1yQ0NIw

We discovered it totally by accident while roaming through the newest building on the strip, looking for a fun meal. The initial outside appearance of the restaurant made me think it was a food court, but once I saw the name Jose Andres, I knew we were in for something special,  and I wasn't disappointed.

That was over a year ago, since then we have been back several times.  The highest compliment that I can pay to the food is that every time I leave China Poblano, I leave energized, excited, and euphoric.

When China Poblano gets it right, they get it very right, witness the Viva China, beef tendon and Kumamoto Oyster taco.  It's simple, yet enthralling, an amazing contrast of texture, temperature, and flavor.  Every time I have one, it's just as good as the first.

There are a number of other shining stars, like the Barbacoa and Silenco (spicy duck tongue and lychee!) tacos, and several of the desserts (I still dream about the Tres Lychees, why did they have to take it away?!?!?!).  The noodles I've tried were quite good (especially the spicy Dan Dan Mian), but not quite up to the level of the zany tacos.

I have sampled a few things that I'd classify as merely ""good"" like the chocolate terra cotta warrior, and the fried wantons, and there is a large swath of the menu that I've yet to try.

Yes, it can be a bit pricey for the quantity of food/drink, but consider the location, and more importantly consider the creative, meticulously prepared food.  You get what you pay for.

However, those items that I love make China Poblano a destination entirely on their own, not to mention the fun atmosphere and excellent service.  On that note, our servers have always been not just friendly and accommodating, but very knowledgeable about the food as well, and I think that really makes a difference in the overall experience.

I'm always happy to be coming back to China Poblano.  It's a great place to start or end your Vegas trip, or perhaps even for a late night in the middle.  This last trip, we did all three!",xWW2kQBv4osvW7_idaUlAA,1,1,5,f4OUEOnnsWxz_DmkXsw7sg

We hit up China Poblano because it was in the hotel and wasn't fine dining  and looked more interesting than the burger place next door. I was honestly disappointed. 

The food was average - some of it was very good, like the dumplings, and then some of it I've had better at super cheap joins in Chinatown. I was feeling boring and ordered tacos, and they were really bland. It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't worth the price. The cocktails were good and the service was great, however, so kudos to the staff. 

The worst part for me, however, was the seating. I would have enjoyed this experience infinitely more if I hadn't been expected to sit on a bench or a stool. To my eye (we sat on the ""Mexican side"" of the restaurant) there was only ONE area where any of the seating had a back - along a wall, which faced ... more backless, wooden stools. It was so impossibly uncomfortable, I found it really difficult to be objective about what I was eating. Half the seating looked like high school lunch tables. It was really awkward.

I love the atmosphere, as if you're walking into the LSD trip of a luchador on a dragon boat. The waitress was notable in her attention to our questions regarding dietary restrictions. If you have a dietary restriction, they take it seriously, which is always a good thing to know. However, our water glasses did remain empty for a quarter of the meal. Nothing worth complaining about too loudly, just an odd disconnect between the quality of service we initially received. 

As for the food, we started with some good ol' chips and salsa. Why? I am not sure, but I would resist. The salsa was a-ok, but didn't  thrill my buds. We each had a taco. I went for the pastor with thinly sliced pineapple, and the pork belly was good, but I thought the sauce could have gone in a different direction. It overpowered the lovely pineapple.

The two standout dishes were the chilaquiles, a must if you adore cheese, and the snow pea salad dressed with citrus. I confess it was my first time eating snow peas raw, and I find this a distinct upgrade on a lettuce salad. It is quite stemmy, but I don't care.

My friends and I wanted just some small bites before going out and this place seemed like it would fit the bill. I'd been to Jose Andres' Bazaar in LA so I knew this place would be pricey but probably worth a try. The dishes are actually pretty straightforward and tasty upscale versions of Chinese and Mexican street food. By upscale I mean gold leaf flakes on the dumplings, oyster in a taco, etc. and tiny portions.

Our group got to share:
- Sui Mai (Traditional 6pc  shrimp/pork/water chestnuts/mushrooms/peanuts)
- Dan Dan Mian (hand-cut wheat noodles/spicy pork sauce/peanuts)
- Cóctel de Camarones (fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado)
- Papas Fritas (fried potatoes with mole poblano/Mexican cream/queso fresco)

And I got for myself in addition:
- Viva China (soft beef tendon/Kumamoto oysters/scallions/Sichuan peppercorn sauce)
- China Paloma (tequila reposado/house-made grapefruit lavender syrup/soda)

I'd have to say my fave item was that Viva China taco! The beef tendon was perfectly crispy/chewy/fatty and the oyster added an extra dimension to the flavors--very good! All told with others ordering a drink of their own everyone's share came to about $35, which is pretty dang pricey for small bites. The service was also decent so I thought it was worth a try, but next time I'll probably save my $$ for other places.",oSN3M4_WKdlTsnpgqPDiBg,3,3,3,Z3otXuaXr6rU_onQv1wV9Q

The food was better than just ""good"" the drinks were very tasty, and there was a wide range of selection in regards to how daring one might want to be. The dumplings and the pork buns definitely stand out and the top favorites as well as the guacamole. Most at my table happened to prefer the chinese selections that we had made but really, everything was very very tasty overall. We went for a lunch so that we could walk everything off later and the place was almost empty. Although, we were probably eating much earlier than many who visit vegas. The meal was expensive, but it was well worth it. I will say, that while the drinks were good, I think that they were overpriced based on what you are able to get in the area for less. However, overall, I am a fan and would enjoy going there again for maybe a slightly smaller meal (we definitely over-ordered since we were so excited about all of the options!).",-aQfQ4cKZbSrjZauRf4ZEw,0,0,4,q5_UYHvtB030InIuvjS56Q

We were most definitely not going to eat at Jaleo since you can throw a rock out the Washington Monument and hit one.  China Poblano was to be our JA experience at the Cosmopolitan.  

The restaurant is on the small side, but, as all of JA's restaurants, colorfully decorated.  We got When Pigs Fly, which are the more traditional steam Chinese buns and not the type of buns you would expect from a ramen house, for example.  Vietnamese also eat these type of buns - ban bao - usually filled with an egg and meat.  These buns were just ok, but not what i wanted or expected.  I got the fish tacos, which were just seared fish with marinated onions.  They left something to be desired.  The BF got the Queso Fundido, which was the best thing we had.  It was melted Menonita cheese, tequila and he added chorizo.  The tortillas were warm and tasted oh so gooey and ooey once we tore the tortillas up and dug into the melted yummy-ness.  

China Poblano was good, but like a typical Jose Andres restaurant, a mixture of Spanish and Asian spices and tastes, where some of the dishes are a standout and the rest are just fillers.

5279822,2011-01-06,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Conceptually ""Chinese Mexican fusion,"" China Poblano is billed as a blending of the two rich cultures.  Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  With an entryway shaped like Buddha and ""Mexican Takeout"" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  With an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from Chinese Opera Masks and Lanterns to Luchador Masks and Oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  In addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant Chinese and Mexican individuals.  To see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.

Arriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from Langosta.  Described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol chile sauce ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and I felt the chile sauce overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.

Silencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  Unfamiliar with rambutan until this time I was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  While not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.

The Cochinita tacos, described as Yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   Savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.

Carnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  With the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  Tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.

Coctel de Camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  Essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.

Love Is In the Air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  Nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an ""mg"" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.

Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  While slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the mélange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both Hispanic and Chinese cultures.

Ocean Nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  With crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not I don't think I'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.

The Unruly Monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the Ocean Nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local Chinese restaurant in most mid-sized US cities.

In the end I think the verdict is still out on China Poblano - I'm not willing to rule it out, but I'm also not ready to say the ""concept"" (which is exactly what it is) ""works.""  While certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of Americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  Looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit I already see many changes and given Andres' propensity for exploration I've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,3,gvayweFpf4hmy2sdUz1nVg

The service at China Poblano was good.  I loved the interior.  Images of Mao, Frida Kahlo, the Dalai Lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.

I had the Jasmine Downy Pearls tea and it was amazing.  It was fragrant and it tasted good.  It was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  We ordered a bun of different things from the menu:

Golden Pigs:
4 fried BBQ pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  Dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  Sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5

Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich:
A braised pork sandwich.  The bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. If you look at the menu, you'll see ""Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich"" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  Honestly, I hated it. 1/5

Tacos (Carnitas, Langosta, Viva China, Pescado Frito):
The Carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  Just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. Great taco variety. 4/5

When Pigs Fly:
4 steamed BBQ pork buns. Yep, that's all I can say about that.  Nothing special. 3/5

Lucky Six Siu Mai:
2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5

Papas Fritas with Mole:
I wanted fries with my sandwich.  I had to pick between mole and XO sauce.  Fries + XO sauce just doesn't seem appetizing so I went with mole.  The mole was overpowering.  There was a scant amount of Mexican cream and queso fresco.  I can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5

Queso Fundido with Chorizo:
Again, nothing special. 3/5

Mango Sticky Rice:
This was the best thing on the menu.  Instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5

Chocolate Terra Cotta Warriors:
The name ""WARRIORS"" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  It looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  The presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5

Cajeta Flan:
A flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  The flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5

So why 3 stars?  For the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  It's like they grabbed the queso fundido from Viva Zapatas, steamed BBQ pork buns and siu mai from Spring Mountain, fish tacos from Rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.

5322939,2016-02-10,10,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I've been to China Poblano several times now. It's one of my go-to options in the Cosmo as it has a diverse menu, affordable prices, and the layout is unique. One half of the restaurant is Chinese, the other half is Mexicano. Those lookin' for a celebrity chef experience, Jose Andres provides one, at a price that doesn't break the bank.

Dishes are severed small plate (tapas) style/ small bites. Great for sharing (which I recommend) as there a lot of interesting, unique flavors; some of which are very hit or miss.

First, I always order chips and salsa, it's sad that you have to pay for that, but it's the Strip, I am surprised water doesn't come with a service fee (I jest). When is chips and salsa NOT a solid choice? Never. Order them. It's a big bowl of salsa and warm fresh chips! Nom.

My favorite taco by far is the Pancita Al Pastor, something about pork belly and pineapple combo has always won me over, CP was no exception. Never met an al pastor I didn't like. The Viva China with steak and a oyster was a must order because it was a unique take on surf and turf. This was interesting, not bad, not outstanding, very unique. Glad I experienced it, probably would order it again, but haven't. The Pescado Estico Baja was probably my least favorite fish taco ever. The flavors were just wrong. I do like that the fish was grilled (usually fish tacos are fried), but the flavors were just whack. Skip.

My FAVE FAVE FAVE dish is the Dan Dan Mian. Spicy, sweet, savory, nutty, porky and noodly. This dish is just perfect. Any time I can eat noodles with chopsticks I feel like a cultural boss. ORDER this. My second favorite dish is the Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Each time I've gone my counter part has ordered this and it's amazing. The vegetables included are seasonal so the dish was a little different each time.

Solid beer, wine, and libation varieties. CP also has several vegetarian options. All in all, affordable choices, friendly, prompt service, a unique atmosphere, and unique, interesting ambiance and flavors that will please many palates.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,13,11,4,p_WxC_m1CbuGoTg-bkM6MA

Two dishes were particularly amazing. 

Beijing Glass: a chinese noodle dish accompanied by Mexican vegetables such as jicama and avocado. The sauce soaked into the glass noodles making the whole dish an amazing melange of flavors! Plus, the portion was large and easy to share among several friends.

Silencio: a sweet barbecue taco composed of duck tongues. Andres has always been one to test his diner's culinary limits (just check out my entry for his DC restaurant) and at first eating a bunch of little tongues can be unnerving. But after a few bites, you will not be able to put down this dose of deliciousness.

Other dishes were less memorable; however, they were all good. My biggest complaint were the prices. With the exception of Beijing Glass, portions were a little small for sharing. You had to order more which raised the price a bit high!",gdak_oV3zff4bknarwtOpQ,1,0,4,dbTac-T3uMhTcMiA6xVYMA

5390836,2014-04-25,3,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We were running late on a concert night at the Cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   While doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon China Poblano as:

1) ""Tacos sound kinda good right now""
2) ""It's Jose Andres!   That dude's been on Bourdain and Top Chef so he's legit""
and
3) ""It gets 3 stars on Yelp!  That means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?""  

So we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty Yelp threshold of place to visit.   I'm glad we did.    We started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   I wanted the Aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something I don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very ""manly"" like ""the Snow Willow""   or ""The Kitten's Purr""   It had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    Naturally my friend ordered my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   I tried both and all I'll say is, the Aviation was delicious! Quick wait service update:  After we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what I felt was a long time.   We sat without drinks and without placing our order for I'd say a good 12 minutes.   We were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.   

So given that we had a bit of a break, I went to Yelp to try to find some recommendations.   I went with 4 tacos (they're small and I'm big).   and my dining companion went with Mongolian Beef Lettuce.    As long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   It seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the Mongolian Beef Lettuce showed up.   

For my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos I ordered and ate

1)  Lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   Melt in your mouth, well seasoned.  
2)  Viva China (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   I must admit I'm not a HUGE oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.   
3) Carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and I loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided.
4) I cant find the 4th one I ordered on the menu.   Either that or I had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   It was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile I thought.   It was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   It didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though

Overall I was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   The tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   We actually ordered some on the side to go with the Mongolian Beef Lettuce.  As for that dish I thought I was a bit underwhelming.   The beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   The tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   I like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   Not many places, especially at the Cosmo, give you that option.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,3,4,zobByod9SMwskk3S7jnxqA

We've tried several other restaurants at the Cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. The experience started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. There was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. Once seated, everything changed. The server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. The service seemed a bit rushed at times. We ordered six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. I have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   I'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. These dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. They are creative, complex and well executed. The prices for small plates is high, but again, Cosmo on the Strip, what do you expect.  Now for the food: 

Vegetable spring roll - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good spring rolls. 

Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. OMG. It's been a month and I still can't stop thinking about it. 

20 vegetable fried rice. The price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. The time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. 

Carnitas taco - awesome. The spicy verde cruda sauce...I asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. 

Pancita al pastor. Had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. Good, but not my favorite. 

Queso Fundido - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.

Don't get me wrong.. you definitely see (and taste!) the Jose Andres flair in the menu but CP just doesn't feel special enough to match the food.  It's a simple space w/almost a fast food feel to it... I half expected to go up to the counter to order.  Gladly, we did have waiter service and our waiter was pretty great -- answering all our questions and coming by to check on us quite often. 

The food prices also don't warrant the casualness.. I spent $70 on my half of the 'casual' meal which was well worth it in terms of the food, BUT for that price I'd like to enjoy my dinner in a space that makes me feel like it warrants that amount, know what I mean? 

As for the food, the duck tongue taco and the pork belly sandwich were the standouts. I thought everything was very good but the noodle dish was rather 'meh' and I also didn't quite see what the hoopla was about with the fish taco -- fell kinda flat for me w/not much flavor.

Enjoyed it.  Menu could still use a little refining - but amidst the overpriced nature of the Strip - this place was exciting food at a reasonable price.

A few thoughts:
-love the decor inside.  funky and fun - highlighted by the chinese fertility dolls in the middle/center, which are also where people sit while waiting for a table.

-cocktails were great.  had the salt drink, as described by others, and it was phenomenal.

-excellent service.  Ali, our waiter, was attentive and just a very nice dude.


And, food was a really unique mix of flavors.  Loved the tuna ceviche dish.  Also the eggplant was really different (in a good way), loved the consistency of it.

If I was to give this place a few suggestions it would be: a little less red meat/pork on the menu; tacos, as described by others, were a little greasy; and while the eggplant itself was cooked very well, the sauce on it was a little too heavy.

Lastly, GET THE CHIPS AND SALSA.  Some of the best I've ever had.",0wm2SsmZNxcqKGQdNNh2Ew,0,0,4,RKp_mJE7_cAGq5uPSiorPw

I had no interest in going to the western outpost of Jaleo (when there are so many better tapas options in town) but I was intrigued by the concept of China Poblano. And it did not disappoint.

Joined by two friends, we ordered a sampling of dishes from both sides of the menu - but the thing that sticks in my mind the most is the cocktail I ordered, the ""lemon drop soup."" Vodka, citrus and noodles. Yes, noodles. In a drink. The ""salt air"" margarita was no less creative, and the ""cold tea"" of green tea, tequila and beer is just out there.

The absolute best dish I ordered here was the guacamole - it's $15 for an order (served with warm, fresh corn tortillas) but OH EMM GEE it's good. Special trip good. Take out window late at night good. And they'll make it as spicy as you want - always a plus for me.

Of all the dishes I've had, the only one I didn't love was the rainbow congee. Aside from that, pure unadulterated awesomesauce. The Mongolian beef is a New York strip. The sui mai dumplings contain gold leaf. The mole poblano tacos are morsels of joy.

5515029,2012-02-24,9,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"When I first saw China Poblano, I thought it was just some gussied up Chinese joint at the Cosmopolitan.  When I looked a little closer, I realized it was some kind of combo Mexican-Chinese restaurant.  When I checked them out on my phone, I learned they were a Jose Andres creation.  When my friends suggested them for lunch, I was game.  When we were done, I was sorely unimpressed.

Now, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, I was under the impression that China Poblano offered a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  In reality, they mostly offer Chinese AND Mexican food.  As in, one and the other.  Not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  Disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  After asking the waiter for suggestions, I took his advice and ordered a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were ""small-ish""):

- Dan Dan Mian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=1znpnNpUi4mUde6NTXRxEA) - underwhelming.  The noodles themselves were okay and I liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  Really, the only flavors I could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  I didn't expect much and they still fell short.
- Carnitas Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=BqnTT9gfKS5Ol5gszHWr2A) - FAIL.  Unlike my noodle dish, I actually had hopes for this one.  Rather than crispy, grilled meat, I was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  No bueno.
- Pescado Frito (fried fish) Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ilJU8hdfD1EXVL_EZKfFeA) - by default, it was the best thing I had.  On its own, it was only decent.  The fish and pickled onions worked, but I thought the flavor was too muted.  If it was a little stronger, I would have liked it more.

Given the celebrity chef owner and China Poblano's location on the Strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  To charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  With just the $12 I spent on the tacos, I can find a better Chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  Unless you're a big Jose Andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like Holstein's next door).",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,12,9,2,CaxtrMFYygGDSPeSXHvP4A
5518260,2015-07-02,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I came in with decent expectations. Walking in, they were lowered a little bit. Very gaudy, flashy decor. But once you look at the menu, it speaks for itself.  

The food isn't really fusion. They have a mexican side and an asian side. The cocktails are made with agave-based spirits and they have some agua frescas too.

I started with a horchata. It was good.. A little chalky compared to others I've had, but not too sweet. My friend got the mango and it was DELICIOUS. 

We ordered many small things to share, starting with the lengua taco.

Best lengua taco I've ever had. Meat was seasoned, tender and simply garnished with radish, onion and cilantro. You can tell the corn tortillas are fresh and made in house (you can watch some ladies making them as you walk in).

Next we had the golden pigs. Similar to Chinese pork buns but deep fried. The dough was slightly sweet and delicious. They're served with a side of house made condensed milk. YUM! 

The fries came next.. They were loaded with mole (perfectly balanced), crema and queso fresco. Fries are hand cut. They were yummy. A carnitas taco came out too. Again, best carnitas taco I've had. It was garnished with salsa verde and pork rinds.

The duck tongue taco and a Chinese pork street sandwich were last. The duck tongue was glazed in some delicious sweet sauce, garnished with fresh lychee... A bit hard to get over the mental block, but I still gave it a shot. The pork sandwich was very full of flavor. Chopped pork braised with 5 spice. 

Overall, everything was very well executed. They mentioned almost everything was made in house. Service was fantastic. Definitely recommending this place to friends visiting Vegas! It won't break the bank either.",hejBq4wRk5Oe21lawuudrQ,0,0,5,edoFSu_U7-fGf2FEYifH2Q

5548968,2012-03-30,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"This restaurant is like a metaphor for Vegas itself - stylish to the point of distraction, creative and wonderful conceptually, and absurdly overpriced. And like just about every other Vegas restaurant I've eaten in, the food just seems not quite as wonderful as it should be. As a case in point, my dinner a couple nights earlier at The Palm. I've eaten at the Palm  100 times in probably 10 cities and its always consistently excellent. At the one in Vegas, it was good. For whatever reason, presumably quality of ingredients in the desert, I'm yet to have a ""holy shit thats good!"" moment dining in Vegas - even at the very finest places.

Anyway, back to China Poblano. The menu is really interesting and just about everything sounds great. You could probably eat there a half dozen times and be excited about trying new things. I had 3 dishes:
 - lamb potstickers, which were good. Beautifully and unusually presented under a fried disk of something which I frankly have no idea what it was. The edible marigolds on top added their own interesting flavor note.It was good - basically the Vegas thing where it sounds awesome, looks awesome, but just tastes good. 
- dan dan noodles. Also magnificently presented, with a very rich flavor of something different than the usual version. The hand cut noodles had a distinct and wonderful texture. And the taste was good. Just good.
- a braised pork tenderloin special. This was a very complex dish with meltingly soft tenderloin with crispy on the outside chewy on the inside fried plantains that added the perfect sweetness to go with a complex mole type sauce and some diced fruit (not sure what) and some couscous. It was very good.

Now back to eating here a half a dozen times - yes you could, but you better bring a big bankroll. I had 3 dishes (as they recommend) which was just about the right amount although I could have eaten more and a light eater probably would have leftovers. The bill - with one beer - was $60. While it wouldn't be the same innovative versions, an order of potstickers, dan dan noodles and roast pork - of similar portion size and similar quality (along with a beer) would be well under half that at a fine Chinese place. 

If the food was as wonderful as the concept and presentation, I'd be in love with this place even at the absurd prices. With 2 drinks (or some wine) and one more dish I'd be pushing $100 for a casual meal for one, but if its fabulous so be it. But they haven't hit that here - its just another one in the line of super-creative, insanely stylish but meh food restaurants that defines Vegas. I'd go back (and I have to say, I couldn't possibly think of a better hangover menu) but only because its Vegas (and I'd hope it was a comp, or someone else was buying!)",Dn7-gET_2Je-lM1cBHCS6w,0,1,3,XCI6Njmbcs4G8Kq6WGoegA
5550125,2011-03-02,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We ended up here at 4:00pm in the afternoon on a weekday after being turned away from both the Buffet at the Cosmopolitan and from Holsteins.  I have no idea why they were both closed, but regardless, this was our 3rd choice of dining and we were massively hungry as my husband and I had a busy day of running around town all day.

As others have said, every dish except some of the salads and noodle dishes are served as small plates.  Everything is massively overpriced, however, as if you were ordering regular entrees.  I have been a fan of José Andrés since I saw him on 60 minutes last year, on Anthony Bourdain's Washington DC show, and his activism regarding the Child Nutrition Act that went through Congress recently.  He had so much heart and passion about food that he serves, that it made me want to come visit his restaurants at the Cosmo, eventually.  I didn't really see the heart and passion at China Poblano.  Concept wise, it is cool, but in execution the food doesn't really work.

We tried both the Chinese and the Mexican side of the menu.

When Pigs Fly - these are just steamed pork buns.  My husband ordered these and liked them but felt they weren't memorable.  He still misses the pork buns from Pike Place Market that we used to get all the time.

Har Gau - I ordered this, and they were soooo tiny.  The shrimp was okay, but because they were smaller than my pinky and chopped fine, I believe the flavor suffered.  There was supposed to be pork belly in it but I could not taste it.

Pancita al Pastor Tacos - husband ordered this and thought it was the highlight of the meal.  I had a bite and thought it was okay, my favorite part was the fresh pineapple.

Queso Fundido - This is just melted cheese with roasted poblanos.  While it was good, there was nothing remarkable about it.  The menu stated that there was supposed to be white tequila in this, I could not taste it.  Again, my favorite part was the poblanos, but I wish there had been more.

Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice - okay so I ordered this because the concept of twenty vegetables intrigued me.  I thought maybe it would make the rice extremely light and fresh.  While the presentation was pretty (see the picture I posted), I found the execution of the rice to be very heavy and greasy.  It was kind of a disappointment.  I was happy to see they added some silky tofu in the dish, as obviously it was created with vegans/vegetarians in mind.  For the inflated price of almost $17.00, this was the most expensive and overpriced dish of our meal.

My husband's barber apparently cuts the hair of a manager of this restaurant. While I have no idea how restaurants in casinos operate, he does not work directly under José Andrés, but for the Cosmopolitan directly.  So this might be where the disconnect is as far as the quality of food versus the price of such a well known celebrity chef.  Maybe José Andrés should visit Vegas more often and make sure the staff knows how to cook the food he puts his name on, as I've seen Charlie Palmer done at his restaurants when he comes to visit every month or so.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,2,2,I8LXYwnn_YLqgM-cA6egPQ

The girls and I needed a quick dinner and it was rather early, so I was hoping there would be no wait.  Luckily, I was right.  When we first sat down, the bus boy brought us water immediately, but then no one came over to us for what seemed like 20 minutes.  We eventually had to flag a waiter down, who was very apologetic and proceeded to provide the best service ever!  Not only was our server very attentive, so was the rest of the staff.  Even the hostess came by at one point to check on us, which I found rather strange but funny, all at the same time lol.  

We started with the fried lotus chips with mole sauce.  Just an FYI: the fried lotus chips do not come with mole sauce.  The waiter offered it to us for making us wait, I believe, and I sure am glad he did.  The fried lotus chips are good, but a bit plain.  However with the mole sauce, it was delicious!  One of the girls ordered the pozole rojo, which was good, but it was nothing compared to the caldo tlalpeño the other girl ordered.  The caldo tlalpeño was so flavorful that it was hard to believe that it was only soup.  Here's a warning: if you cannot take spice, then the caldo tlalpeño is definitely not for you.  Sorry, sucker lol.  I ordered one each of the lengua taco and the barbarcoa taco, which were both delightful.  Lastly, we shared one order of the diver scallops and green beans in XO sauce.  I love scallops, green beans, and XO sauce...however this was a tad salty.  It was mostly the XO sauce so I made due by not getting too much sauce in each bite, which worked out nicely.  

Finally, to make up for forgetting about us, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert, mango and sticky rice.  I love this dessert anyway so I was pretty excited when he brought it out, but of course it had a twist to it.  Normally, it doesn't come with whipped cream on top, but this one did with what seemed like crispy rice treats inside.  Anyway, I don't normally eat whipped cream since it's so fattening, but I figured hey, I'm on vacation...live a little!  And man, am I glad I did!

They also have a noodle show where you see  some guy pull a piece of dough into noodles. 

According to everything, hand pulled noodles are supposed to have excellent texture compared to machine made noodles and should be awesome. So i was super excited about the idea that maybe i won't have to fly to china to enjoy hand pulled noodle anymore. 

Well I should've taken it as a bad sign when I asked the waitress for the dish with the hand pulled noodles and she looked at me like it was the first time she's heard of it.  She tells me the Unruly Monk dish should be the one that has it. 

Next I also ordered a beef tongue taco.

As I waited for the food I watched the chef pull the noodles and then another bad sign. I realized he never once successfully finish pulling the noodles. Half way he would quit cause he messed up. For my entire meal he ""finished"" making noodles twice but he never brought them to the kitchen. They just sat there. Which made me wonder if the noodle show was just a show.

When the food arrived I was very sad. For 16 dollars you get the saddest amount of super soggy noodles. The texture would be described as noodles left in broth overnight. 

The tacos were okay but you can totally have better ones in  downtown LA and at a wayyy better price. 9$ for two mini tacos?! that taste average?!

5576303,2013-08-12,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"We were seated pretty quickly as a table for 7 at 7pm without having a reservation by two very hospitable staff. After 4 days in Vegas, the first positive vibe I picked up on was that the front of house staff were very humble, gracious and genuine - a welcome change to the a few of the other restaurants we ate at. 

Despite the warm welcome, we were left sitting without a visit from a server for at least 10 minutes. And at most restaurants, this would be fine if not just slightly annoying. But here's why it was a much bigger problem at China Poblano: the menu and how/what you should order isn't easily decipherable without a bit of guidance (or having been there before). 

I'd suggest to the managers of CP to have the staff who seats you stick around for an extra :15 and give a one or two line spiel on how the menu is divided, portion sizes, what's shareable/not shareable, and recommended quantity of order per person. We all started to confuse each other and actually started to discuss leaving to go to somewhere that was a bit easier on our we're-in-vacation-mode brains. 

Our server came by just in time before we left and explained how it all worked, but then left and proceeded to give us another 10 minutes to ponder our life as well as our food order. He didn't take a drink order. So in the end, we sat for 20 minutes before we even get a drink order in. It's almost impossible to sit anywhere in Vegas for that long without being offered a drink. 

Orders go in and the food starts rolling out pretty much immediately. Highlights for me were:

- Queso fundido
- Lucky 6 Siu Mai
- Gan pung ji chicken (table fave)
- Carnitas taco
- Chipotle salsa

Lowlights:

- Viva china taco
- Lamb pot stickers 
- Guacamole (tasty enough, but poor value)

There were a few mix-ups with the service - some people didn't get their tacos till the rest of the table was pretty much done their food. I chalked that up to the shared-plates approach, but a bit more attention could have easily saved one upset and ignored diner. We were also missing a side of the ""monk chilli sauce"" which was ordered because we were - and still are - very curious as to WTF it would actually be. 

Loved the decor of the restaurant and felt that the music was very well selected. Not really sure about the choice to project a picture of Frida Kahlo up at the same time as Chairman Mao. When you take into account his political decisions were responsible for like 40-70 million unnecessary deaths,...  Maybe it's art or irony, I dunno. It certainly sparked a conversation at the table where we concluded that the designer was probably more into the superficiality of the icon of Mao, like Che, rather than the politics and the fact that he's pretty much one of the greatest modern mass murderers. And we're looking at him while eating. In Las Vegas. Ok, maybe it is irony. Unintentional irony? Moving along...

TL;DR version: interesting spot, food was generally tasty, I found it priced pretty reasonably with a few exceptions. The menu could use a bit more explanation - ideally, immediately upon arrival - and the table service could be a bit tighter and attentive. 

I also think this menu would benefit from being slimmed down by a few items, and then perhaps divided by portion size.",HdpjFSDMT6vbRDFjpzPDVg,1,0,3,fN42UWDZKbecHhf8cR7duQ

We had an inkling to try a breakfast place around the way but the line was just ridiculous so we actually went to China Poblano by accident. I'm sure glad we did. 5 of us were seated at the counter which was perfect as we were just looking for a quick meal before we got the day started. The host at the counter explained to us the whole concept of asian and mexican/spanish fusion under one menu. I was a little skeptical at first but you know what? The food I ordered was great. The concept? It works. I was pleasantly surprised. I shouldnt be surprised. Chef Jose Andres is the man.

It was suggested we try the tacos by our host and he did not steer us wrong. I had the carnitas taco ($6) and it was excellent. Shredded braised pork served with diced onions, pepper and cilantro and topped with chicharrones. It was really really tasty. The carnitas was legit and the tortilla was hand made. The crunch from the chicharron was great. It's like street taco style but about double the size of your typical taco truck taco and utilizing only 1 well formed tortilla. It was also double the meat you usually get from a typical street taco. I def recommend getting the carnitas taco. 

The other appetizer I got was the fried wontons ($11.88) for 7 pieces. It was also very good. Great crunch on the outside and great pork/shrimp flavors inside. The accompanying sesame sauce was perfect with it. I also highly recommend this appetizer. So tasty.

Great food. Served fairly fast. Located inside our hotel at The Cosmopolitan. Friendly service. What more can I ask for? I've stayed at The Cosmopolitan many times and have visited plenty more and I've walked by this place so often never knowing how good it was. I wont make that mistake again.

It is sort of tapas style and intended for sharing.  Almost every dish included pork, even the one with tofu.  My friends shared some steam buns (when pigs fly and didn't love them) and some dumplings which were also just ok.  I shared the kung pao chicken lettuce wraps which were good.

The service was very friendly and knowledgeable but really really slow. It was a Sunday night, and busy, but it was no excuse to take more than 10 minutes to get our first cocktails.

The cocktails are so fun! Go for some of the margaritas and specialty drinks. We also had a flight of excellent tequilas. If you like tequila, this is the place to go.

We were trying to eat light before our concert so my husband and I each opted for one taco. He got the duck tongue taco and I got the oyster +lychee taco combination. Both tacos were excellent. Very interesting flavor combinations. 

Following our tacos we got a plate of the lamb wontons. They were delicately folded and full of lamb goodness. Beautifully presented!

Lastly, we shared an epic churro dessert. The churros were worth it. Each one was crispy, fluffy and best dipped in the Mexican hot chocolate sauce.

Quail Egg Siu Mai 
Not as egg-mazing. Sigh. I actually didn't particularly enjoy all the flavors bursting together. It was bit overwhelming. I wasn't too fond of the slightly too salty egg in my mouth either. It just didn't work for me, the flavor the taste and the appearance. 

Lucky 6(Traditional, Scallops and Beef siu mai) 
Overall just a-ok. Nothing that stood out to me that was really bad or a #musthave

- Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos, grilled hanger steak, Oaxacan mole, ancho, guajillo, costeño, wild mushrooms might have saved the meal for us.

He probably got the munchies and thought, damn I need to get me some greasy ass Chinese food or Mexican food.  It would be great if there was a place that served both. Bingo!

Then he sobered up the following day and created the menu as well as the prices.  It takes the clarity of corporate gluttony to take well-loved comfort food that is cheap and then charge more than 4 times the norm for it.  And it takes an idiot like me who will walk in and pay for it.  So I'm gonna call you out right here, Jose.  You have had me shell out tons of my hard earned money at your other establishments for fantastic cuisine that clearly distinguished you from your peers as well as served as an homage to your roots training under Adria Ferran of El Bulli. But you won't fool me again in ordering your f***g pathetic excuse of $25 fried rice. I felt like I was eating at Disneyland or at the airport.  Yes, I know that high quality ingredients adds cost.  But the food should taste better than the fried rice dish my sister made for me when she learned to cook at 9 years old..not an exact replica.

But the tacos here are pretty good, despite the sticker shock.  Chilaquiles are also good, but probably not as good as you mom made them, unless your mom was Chinese.  But that is what everything more or less tastes like here.  Mexican food like it was done by a Chinese chef, and Chinese food like it was done by a Mexican chef. Somewhat creative, good quality ingredients, but lacking the comfort that we expect these foods to provide.

But I would definitely not classify this place as fusion cuisine. It is more like what you get when you come across a Lousiana Fried Chicken - Hong Kong Express joint.

5654233,2017-08-20,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"This is by far one of the worst restaurants we have been in a while.  First, the concept.  This is not a fusion restaurant, but a restaurant that has some Mexican dishes and some Chinese dishes.  Neither one crosses the border to the other and they do not really match either.  Second, we waited a very long time to sit down even though there were empty tables and they were actually empty for over 1 1/2 hours before anybody used those tables.  Even if they were reserved, they were empty for at least 2 hours.  This is not a very big restaurant, so having 2-3 tables that were not occupied for that long span of time is a big issue.  

When we finally sat down the very unimpressive menu became even smaller.  When we started ordering we were told they were out of at least 3 things on the menu.  I can only eat chicken since unfortunately I have allergies to some of the other proteins, being out of 2 of only 4 chicken items on that menu was a big issue.  When we finally order, and not until after we ordered, we were told that the food comes from 4 different kitchens and it does not necessarily come out at the same time.  3 of the people in our party were completely done before the 4th person had received his meal.  

We ordered the roasted chicken taco(Pollo a la parilla taco) , the duck tongue taco(Silencio), the Caldo Tlalpeño , Tamal Rojo, The Chinese Pork Buns(when Pigs Fly) and the Mongolian Beef Lettuce.  Surprisingly enough the one that took the longest seemed the easiest and fastest  to cook.  The Mongolian Beef Lettuce(which is nothing more than grilled pieces of beef and a lettuce salad drenched in what I assume was a soy sauce vinaigrette (it only tasted like sauce) took the longest.  By the time it reached the table the meat was not even hot.  

We did not try dessert since we had already had miserable service and even worse food.  It is not a place where I would go back at all.  

Perhaps we were there on a bad night, but to us the menu does not really make sense together and given the fact that they were out of so many items at 8 pm, was very disappointing.",iOPBJjTUhpYtDv305gOqoQ,0,0,1,V0Liu_mJ_zr5-d4AeCX50Q

My friend and I started off with their fresh guacamole and chips. Let me tell you people.... I have never had a server come out with three halves of an avocado, spices, and MASH ALL THAT JAZZ UP in front of my face! It was like boom bam wham, suddenly the freshest guacamole I've had was made in minutes! The portion was enough for 3 people, and I craved it even after dinner as much as I craved their house made chipotle sauce. YOU MUST GET THIS!!! It's a sin to leave without trying it. Another starter we had was the tuna ceviche which came topped with crispy microscopic balls that added a fun crunch to this fabulous appetizer. 

For entrees, we shared their Caldo tlalpeno soup, dan dan mian noodles, and chicken ji song lettuce wraps. Chicken ji song wraps were sooo refreshing and light, the fun crunchy sweet potatoes straws on top were my fav part. The texture of the dan dan Mian noodles was the perfect chewiness, its as if they crafted their noodles in the morning for optimal freshness. Although I got full, I could not stop picking at the last few bites while waiting for the check, cause they were simply just that irresistible.

Once we saw that portion size, we knew we could not eat a bunch of other stuff, so each of us selected two tacos (carnitas and chicken).

Honestly....the guacamole was the BEST, and it was a big portion with lots of chips.  So, with the tacos, which were also VERY good, it was plenty of food.  That left us with only one disappointment which was that we didn't even get to try the Asian food.

We sat near enough to a couple of other tables, where we had conversations with others who did have other things and everyone agreed.....everything they make is very good.  Give it a try!",oJSrYYLwAu3Uh3R49hr92w,0,0,5,IhKT40irYMa4bfTfo_K_1Q

The food was great and surprisingly affordable. Despite ordering two noodle dishes, a side of papas fritas and two margaritas, our bill was less than $40 INCLUDING TAX AND TIP.

Thats nutty prices for how good the food is.

What really made our meal was the service. Our waitress, Kimberly, was not only kind and prompt despite the restaurant being busy, but she was paying excellent attention.

Then, when she made our tableside guac and we asked for the red onion and cilantro to be omitted, she asked if we wanted these omitted from our other dishes too.

The shumai weren't really anything to write home about, but the lobster tacos were the real disappointment! As my coworker put it, ""for $10 a taco, I expected them to taste good."" The lobster was completely overwhelmed by an abundance of lime and grapefruit, making the tacos quite acidic and sour. The mango sticky rice was an interesting twist on the classic Thai dessert, as the rice was puffed and sprinkled on top of mango and ice cream which was covered in quite a lot of whipped cream.

The place looked interesting with it's very casual atmosphere, and so, although I was kind of skeptical about a place serving Chinese and Mexican food, we decided to keep an open mind as it looked pretty decent. But boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.

The hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. The server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but I had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something. Anyway, we decided to try a mix of dishes since the server recommended we perhaps try 2 Chinese dishes and 2 Mexican dishes just to mix it up. We  didn't want to order too much since it was pretty late so went ahead and ordered the Chips & Salsa, Beijing Glass noodles, Dancing Eggplant.....then we looked over at the next table and the dish they ordered looked interesting so we asked them how and what it was? ...it was the Gan Pung Ji Chicken and they told us it was very good! So ok, we went ahead and ordered it just to try something different.

Oh boy. The eggplant dish had a thick black sauce over it that totally overpowered the eggplant ....kind of tasted like and overly sweet Hoisin sauce, but whatever it was, we didn't like it at all. The eggplant itself was cooked ok, but would have been tasteless without something on it, but not that strong. Next, was the Beijing Glass noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself. Something tasted off about these noodles, and again, we didn't like it at all. Next was the chicken dish. It's basically a fancied up lemon chicken type dish. sauce was starchy and way too sweet.

I think the best part of the dinner was the Chips and Salsa which tasted fresh...and together with our Coronas and red wine....somewhat made us forget about the Chinese food we had just ate. 

I can't say I will ever come back to this place as there are so many better places to eat in Vegas. And the prices of the dishes here are not cheap for what you get!

There are bike wheels on the ceilings and pictures of monumental figures on the wall that change with time. There are two bar areas to sit and order food or drinks.

There is an amazing place to wait if there is no room immediately for a table. It is really unique!!! The food was excellent and so diverse. I loved the chinese/mexican fusion. We ordered the langosta taco's, vegetable spring rolls, chips & salsa (seasoned so well), vegetable jaiozi dumplings (dim sum), my fiance had the chicken lettuce wraps, and we split the churros. The churros come with a chocolate milk sort of dip it's not solely chocolate. I wish they served it with just chocolate as traditional churros are typically serviced with. They were also a little too sugary. I also wish that they had more dipping sauces. They only have soy sauces. I don't like soy sauce so I was hoping they would have a lighter sauce or some type of orange sauce but they did not have it. They also do not have coffee. If they work out some of those issues, this is a 5 star restaurant :)

Also, again it was a small amount of fries and it was worth $7.  'Scuse me, but I could go to Robertos and get a huge ass box of Carne Asada Fries for that same price.  I would get five times as much as you gave me. My grandma got the pork buns (Siopao) and man.  That really disappointed me.  After being an avid Chinatown visitor of both LA and Las Vegas, and being of Filipino descent, I was appalled that these four, dainty buns were $12.  If you're going to charge that much, these buns better be damn good.  Nope.  I ate it all though because I didn't want to waste food that was expensive. it ended up being over $40 for just three plates.  Mind you, we didn't even order other beverages.

5769975,2018-05-22,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Can I premise this by saying that it actually pains me to give this place a 2 star rating?

I've come here a few times over the past 8 years.  In the early years, I would dream about when I could come back because I thought everything tasted so good.  The tuna ceviche with the amaranth is a literal wet dream for me.  I fantasize about it constantly.  Well, not anymore.

First, be warned to read the menu before you come.  It isn't really super true fusion.  It's more like Chinese and Mexican food on the same menu.  Some items are almost there in terms of fusion but not quite.

The food quality seems to have taken a dive.  Everything we got just wasn't as good as it should be.  This was the first time I've come for lunch so maybe it's that?  NO!  No excuse.  The food should be good no matter what time you go.  The tuna ceviche was drowning in sauce and waaaayyy too salty.  The 20 veggie fried rice tasted like nothing.  The tendon tacos were soggy.  Like the tendon and the tortilla were soggy.  How did this happen?  There isn't sauce.  Did you just give me old leftovers?  And the oyster did not taste fresh.  My mouth revolted it once I put it in there.  

The service has always been slightly below average but it seriously was bad this last time.  Our server seemed a little pushy and rushed but we need time to look at the large menu.  We tell him that my mom can't have spicy things so he suggests the Beijing glass.  The menu has no mention of spice and of course when it comes there are peppers on it.  Luckily it doesn't come mixed so we took it off but dude, this is service 101.  By the end of the meal we didn't have the tacos.  We tell him this and he says, ""you didn't order tacos.""  That's funny because I was trying to order the silencio ones but you were out so you told me to get the viva china ones.  Then he goes back to his notebook/order pad and sees we did order them so he comes back and says oops I'll put those in.  NO!!!  I don't want them anymore.  Well, he did anyway.  And he gave us the wrong amounts.  I didn't need 3 more tacos.  I just didn't.  Now I have to pay for these tacos I don't want.  I guess I could have made a bigger stink myself and forced him to take them off the bill but he should have offered.  This tells me this place is all about gouging their guests and not providing a great experience.

Let me remind you that I was (mostly) sober at this point.

The siu mai was bomb. Maybe I hadn't had siu mai for a while and really missed it. Maybe very slight intoxication made it yummier. Who knows? But I thought it was great. So great in fact that the day before the trip ended, I just had to come back.

And yes, it was still good the second time around (and totally sober this time). Plus they had a dish called Like Water for Chocolate. Come on. Bookworm that I was, I could not resist. And yes it was good. Dragonfruit and rose petals and quail! Exotic and delicious.

The when pigs fly was very good. The steamed buns with Chinese pork and BBQ sauce was very flavorful. 

I had several of the tacos. The best was the lamb , Barbacoa Cordero.  Very tasty and buttery. Melted in my mouth. The other favorite was the Barbacoa de Res. The beef was flavorful and tender. My only improvement would be to layer I some more flavors. They could have used some salt and a little

I got the crazy nachos topped with a fried egg, because who doesn't like some greasy food to coat the stomach after a hard night of drinking. It was their attempt at a ""fancy"" gourmet chillaquillas. It was mehhhhhhhhhhh. Even my desperate hung over state couldn't appreciate this. 

I shared some shiu-mai for 13 bucks, and that was a disappointment. We also split some tacos (barbacoa and cochinta). Barcacoa was whatever, but that cochinta was quite unforgettable. It had some crispy pork that gave it a nice crunch. The toppings were amazeballs. I'd skip everything and come back for this one taco. 

I think I drank about 7 glasses of water, because it tasted sooooo dang good. I totally thought it was some special water, only to find out from the waitress who said, ""Oh, it's just tap water.""

Our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. It was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to Mexico in one bite.  We ordered chips and salsa as well which were very good. On the Chinese side we went with Traditional sui mai, Lamb pot stickers, And 2 noodle dishes. Everything was good but not outrageous. Plus I'm accustomed to dipping sauces with Sui Mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. The sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce.

However, we were passing by and happened to see a bunch of dim sum steamers through the window and that totally changed our minds! We are suckers for Dim Sum. 

The restaurant is a unique fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisine and it does it right! The set up of the restaurant is unusual with bench ""comunal table"" type seating or bar style. The first thing we noticed was the very high prices, especially for Dim Sum!!! We come from LA and the OC, where Dim Sum is plentiful and cheap. The Dim Sum menu here is pretty small, and many things are $13 a plate! that seemed crazy, but we thought it might be worth trying just once. And it was- we were not disappointed!
We ordered:
-Golden Pigs (pork buns) which comes with in-house condensed milk for dipping. These are petite char sui bao that have been deep fried. It was very pricey but it comes with so much flavor and many layers of textures; from the crunchy outer layer to the soft insides to the sweet and salty porky center, all dipped in th sweet and creamy condensed milk sauce. It was a very fresh look at a classic dim sum dish.
-Chicken Shumai. These were very small but very tasty and moist and full of flavor and topped with a goji berry. 

After two dim sum dishes we decided to share an entre from the Mexican side of the menu: Shrimp with a pepper sauce. These were very tender and a bit spicy but good altogether. 

The best part of it all, Dessert! Mango with Sweet Rice....The best we both have had anywhere!! It had a ton of flavor in every single bite. This restaurant is probably getting that 5th star just because of this amazing dessert. It is like nothing you have ever had, I promise. First, the rice is cooked in coconut milk and reduced to a near liquid, and is then whipped into a light and airy mousse like texture. At the center is a mound of icy, sweet, mango granitas and the whole thing is topped with cramalized rice crispies and chunks of mango.

The service was also very personalized. The wait staff and even the bar tender chimed in with their favorites when it was obvious we couldn't make up our minds.

The hostess kindly seated us immediately. The menu has a variety of items. We ordered fried wontons, queso fundido, and chicken ji song (lettuce wraps). The chicken ji song was my favorite dish. China Poblano lettuce wraps was fresh and the ingredients blended well together. The fried wontons and queso fundido was average at best in my opinion. I chose mango sticky rice for dessert. China Poblano sticky rice was innovative compared to other restaurants I've visited. The unique spin on the mango sticky rice was cool literally (served cold). I enjoyed every bite of my mango sticky rice. The sticky rice is perfect for a hot Las Vegas day. Our server wasn't very attentive (restaurant was not busy). We had to flag her down for refills constantly. The ambience at China Poblano is awesome. It's a good place for drinks and enjoying the Cosmopolitan eye candy.

5895141,2015-12-11,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"A creative concept, but execution is mediocre.

Honestly, the idea of a Chinese and Mexican restaurant usually would have me running in the opposite direction (I HATE fusion places), but the Jose Andres connection really drew me in. This place isn't a fusion restaurant, it's really just a bunch of Mexican and Chinese options. 

My sister and I got: chips & salsa, 2 tacos (hongos & pancita al pastor), 1 order of Dan Dan Mian, 1 order of Swallow a Cloud (wonton noodle soup), and 1 order of Golden Pigs (fried pork buns with condensed milk dipping sauce).

The chips and salsa were okay - salty chips but good chipotle salsa. The tacos were also okay; the hongos (mushrooms) one was way too citrus-y and could've used more guac to balance out, and the pancitas al pastor (pork belly) was good because of the pineapples in it. My sister did say that the pork belly could have been a lot more tender, though. Dan Dan Mian was not good. The noodles were off, and the peanut sauce was salty and too spicy even after adding the vinegar brown sauce on the side. The Swallow a Cloud wonton soup was also mediocre because of the bland noodles. I think the winning dish was Golden Pigs - who would have thought condensed milk to dip fried pork buns into is actually really yummy? 

The concept is creative because there are a lot of options, and the drinks menu looked good, but the food itself was just mediocre. Maybe coming from California set the standard high for Asian and Mexican food, but this place was a little too expensive for just the mediocrity.",8YUo5Jx-ZCB_hHuGTmo35g,1,0,3,xO2O-8E6x6RBVkSeG28dig

5912216,2012-03-31,1,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"Pleasantly bizarre. I guess that's how I would sum this place up.  Watch the video on their website if you want to get a feel for the vibe of the restaurant.  If you are looking for a more classy, quiet, date-night kind of place you are better off going to one of the eateries on the third floor.  This place was rocking on the Saturday night we were there, electrified by the massive crowd just outside the door waiting to get into the club.  But I was in a good mood and enjoyed the music and people watching while we waited for our table perched high above everyone else on what appeared to be a mod style version of a Mayan pyramid... except that there were golden Buddha statues on top.  Yeah.  So now you are starting to get it when I say this place is weird but cool? Did I mention that there was a digital painting on the wall that alternated between a portrait of Frida Khalo and the Dalai Lama? And a sculpture roughly in the shape of a human head protruding from the back wall onto which they projected digital images of Kim Jong-il?  OK, so you got it now, right?

I agree with the other reviewers that I wish they had more fusion dishes.  I was disappointed that the majority of the menu items were either Chinese or Mexican but not both.  And most of the food was just average.  Good but not great.  And yes, ridulously over priced. But at a hip restaurant in what is arguably the hottest casino hotel on the strip right now, that is to be expected. So now, for those of you still reading this, here is a rundown of what we ordered.

Guacamole - My husband made the comment that this was not even the best guac that he had eaten that day.  I am not a big fan of the stuff in general but I would have like to see some kind of twist to make something that is so easy to make at home worth ordering here.  Maybe a little five spice powder or some ginger for that Asian influence.  Are you listening José Andrés? And you really need to serve it with chips.  Those tortillas were pretty darn good but it is a texture thing.

Pot stickers - Beautiful presentation.  Really, just gorgeous. I even took a picture.  I truly enjoyed the flavors and it was a cool twist to get lamb instead of the traditional pork.  But where was the sauce? Everyone knows the best part about eating pot stickers is the sauce. That was another little thing that just made the dish seem lacking and also a missed opportunity to bring in a fusion experience (How about a little chimichurri or mole sauce for dipping? Hello?)

Coctel de Camarones - I was so disappointed in this dish, I can't even tell you.  For those of you who have ever had true cocteles at an authentic Mexican seafood place just don't bother.  If you are the type that enjoys salsa out of a jar, then you might like it.  Once again, though, they were missing the accompaniment. Traditionally, this dish is either served with saltine crackers or tostada shells. However, when we asked our waitress if we could get some chips or something to eat it with she said we were supposed to eat it with the spoon, like gazpacho. wtf?

Chilaquiles - This dish was not authentically Mexican either but I really enjoyed it.  My husband, who had apparently ordered it without reading the description, did not. He was expecting red sauce instead of green but I loved the tangy tomatillo salsa and the cheese was delish. But I agreed with him that there really should have been meat or eggs on there. And the chips were not really cooked into the dish, it was more like nachos than anything else.

Mole tacos - We both liked these though they were a little bland.  I guess not everyone likes spicy but I was expecting at least a little heat.  Gourmet tacos like these are pretty common where we live so I wasn't surprised by the price or size but meh, I've had better.

Palmitos - This salad saved the day for me.  It was truly special.  I love hearts of palm but these weren't the limp white tubes you get out of a jar.  Crisp and fresh, mixed with other equally fresh julienned vegetables, it was a hearty and satisfying salad.  But the dressing is what really blew my mind.  Sweet and sour with a strong tamarind flavor.  It tasted like those Mexican tamarindo candies... except more crisp and organic.  The whole dish was just so clean and brisk.  I know not everyone's palate is the same and someone else might find it too strong, there was a lot of fresh lime juice in there and definitely some kind of chile.  But that is perfect for me. I may return to this place just for that salad... or if I in the mood for some ethnic Vegas style kitsch.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,3,1,3,xCnleg5Qyp3nm20NYN0Fag

Service was fast and superb, the chips and guac tasted really good. They bring all the utensils and make the guac in front of you and ask how spicy you'd prefer it. All of their drinks were yummy. The presentation of everything was clean and nicely prepared. This is the first and only mexican/chinese combined restaurant I've been to, so I really didn't know what to expect. I thought this place was going to be like a mexican and chinese food fusion type of place, but they literally have mexican food and dim sum. 

The flavors of everything were great. We ordered lots of dim sum and everything was A1.This was actually my first time trying dim sum too.  My favorite was the traditional Siu Mai and Har Gow. My other favorites were the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice and Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings. The chicken wings were kind of spicy and the fried rice was good as well. Just wished there was an option to add chicken or meat in it and it would've been perfect. 

Dessert was the best part. The mango sticky rice was really sweet but the whip cream really complimented the cold mango. And the churros...Probably one of the best churros I've tasted in my life. Nice, hot and crispy. I didn't dip it in the chocolate sauce cause I didn't want a heart attack but man the desserts were so good.

Overall a solid place! If you have any cravings for dim sum or tacos this is going to hit the spot and fill that void.",fRzmU2Z9hoxBcRk3vCIKNg,0,0,4,DBrI_pxpP2nloI10snieaA

Dessert: 5 stars. We shared a serving of flan which came with candied pineapple and a Magnolia flower. I ate the flower, it was an edible adventure. The flan was like creme brulee without the hard brown sugar top. I have yet to find a flan that compares.

Decor: 5 stars. Asian flowers, Lucha Libre masks, dragons on the walls, it all makes sense. Fusion, in every sense of the word.

The bartender was very attentive, he quickly took my drink order and made suggestions for my food order. I personally love the salt air margaritas (I opted for pomegranate, yum!). The foamy salt never mixes with your margarita so you just get a lovely taste of salt with every sip, less salty than big chunks of salt on the rim of the glass in my opinion.

The Bartender said the Dan Dan Mian was one of their most popular dishes and that the shrimp mojo was a personal favorite so I went with those 2 items for dinner. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Mian, the noodles were the perfect texture and it wasn't too spicy for a spice wimp like me. The serving size is a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. The seasoning on the shrimp was really delicious, though a little on the salty side.

Yes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the Cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). Yes, the portions are small. Yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all). 

We always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)

Favorite items:
Guacamole with chips and salsa - $15. Handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. Bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging

Viva China taco - $5.50. Rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. Bypass if you do not like foods with ""weird"" textures. 

Lamb Potstickers stuck on you - $12.88. Pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. Must have

Dan Dan Mian - $12.88. Love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. Could be spicier. Have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so I could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. Must have. 

Don't Be Jealous - $11.88. This is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup I've ever seen in my life. Definitely meant for at least 4 people. Not a traditional hot and sour soup. Is pretty thick. Very good. 

Discontinued items?:
They had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. It did NOT look appetizing but was DELICIOUS. It looks like a frog with red warts on it. I no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, I recommend it!

They also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. Tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. Sprayed with tequila. You are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. I no longer see it on the menu, though.

Drinks:
Salt air margarita - $14. What fun! Yummy, boozy fun. 
Blood orange chile pequin margarita - $15 / glass. Yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy!

Not such a fan of:
They always push the 20-vegetable fried rice because Johnny Iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show ""Best Thing I Ever Ate."" I find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.

Dancing Eggplant - really pretty! I don't really like eggplant in general, though.

Cons about the restaurant itself:
The restaurant is literally right outside of Marquee. At lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. At dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. Luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng. 

The chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. I'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. There are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,2,0,4,xo2qAq4QTxf6DGDGjhOV7g

This place has been a dining fixture for me since it opened. I love the chilaquiles and the monk sauce is delicious. While the food is good, the last time my wife and I went we felt the quality had slipped some. 

Still, a solid 4 stars, but used to be 5.",4M3KNM28yq6RdLyO_Pc-nQ,1,0,4,zlNwuI4mO6hJ8wun5zHwOg
5986860,2014-07-21,2,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! The only reason it deserves a 1 is because their Micheladas were pretty decent. 

Where do I start? The prices, portions, excessive use of salt and sugar? To start off I ordered chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa arrived I was excited to try the salsa since it looked dark and spicy (I'm Mexican and this resembled the salsa I make at home). WRONG!!!!! This salsa tasted so sweet it was such a disappointment. For my main entree I ordered two tacos one of which was the carnitas and the other was chicken. The carnitas was excessively greasy and the chicken taco was again very sweet. My fiancé ordered the shrimp poblano which was again extremely sweet. I understand not all Mexican food is made the same but the food at this particular restaurant tasted very foreign to me. 

Not to mention they played a lot of bachata music which is not Mexican at all!! However, since there were tons of white people dining here they wouldn't know the difference. 

In conclusion, I was very disappointed with my meal and since the prices are not fair for the quality of the food I will not be coming back to this restaurant nor will I recommend this place to my family or friends!",b9UOf4gpqgl2SCP8fxuQsA,3,0,1,zpMrI5uAwEfQsXjePwTKvQ
5993236,2014-07-28,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,This place is great! I ordered the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich and the reposado flight of tequila and was very impressed.  The sandwich was an Asian flair of a BBQ sandwich and the tequila came with 2 great reposado's and an equally great mezcal and a palate cleansing drink to sip on.   This place is great!,kWce-2vPkcZUBeKXu5Hk9w,1,2,5,AYpxW7HwImYX4JM0T-060Q
5995269,2017-05-04,0,GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,"I get the issues with this place. It's in a crappy location in the sense that it feels like you are eating in a fancy mall (you basically are) and there could easily be an Orange Julius next door.  Other high-priced restaurants in Vegas are able to pull off dealing with that issue a bit better.  I like the theme as Asian and Mexican cuisines are at the top of my list.  The atmosphere was pretty dead when I was there but the bartender was friendly and the drinks were tasty.  I was able to try many things which is both good and bad.  Good because I tried many things and bad because my wallet paid dearly for me not really getting full all that fast.  I enjoyed my taco fine but not for $6 (have had better $2 tacos at local taco trucks).  The pork buns and dumplings were very tasty but again, small and overpriced.  The dam dam noodle was by far the tastiest dish.  The food is definitely 4 stars in my opinion but the value and atmosphere just aren't there given the ton of other nearby options.",Q-wZgSosVo4x4arPKHtKeQ,0,0,3,I-gL4_mdRbWBEX5T4AN6yg
