We were really looking forward to this place opening up because it is right around the corner from us. What a let down.

We went soon after they opened and we were excited when we got home. We were soon incredibly disappointed with the portions, taste and temperature. 

1) Everything was ICE COLD. Not slightly less warm from travel more like never was warm. 

2) Very weird proportion of toppings to meat. Huge scoops of salsa on top of a tiny pile meat.

3) Nothing at all was seasoned. the guac was a pale green paste. For a place called hot head, nothing had heat or flavor. 

I don't mind paying some good money for an in and out Mexican place but it is hard to justify their prices.",9OzwGCq2m6FNJ0jNp3_ZAA,2,0,1,SOG24onA90ZdmECSlnHkYA

146418,2016-06-30,0,UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA,"Place is similar to Chipotle/Qdoba.  Stand in line walk through and build a burrito, bowl, etc.

They even have a smaller burrito and smaller bowl.  I thought both small versions were still pleanty of food.

There are various other similarities different salsas and toppings including two different cheeses and lettuce.  Now here is where things start to get different.  They have MORE meats.  There are spicy versions of the chicken and steak and the have a BBQ pulled pork (i really like it).

Now here is the kicker.  They have maybe ten different ""sauces"" that you can finish off your meal with.  My favorite is the house hot head sauce.  Its garlicy sweet salty and has a slight kick.  Id put this stuff on my cereal if I could figure out how to make it.  

The only thing i dont like is that it seems like the food doesnt stay hot long.  Not sure if its a packaging issue or how they build the burritos or what.  I can get a burrito from robertos or don tortaco for breakfast and still burn my mouth at lunch.  Well maybe one more thing sometimes the staff don't do a good job of rolling the burritos so they kinda explode all over you but that's why I get bowls.",9CeKCGRwlXMzo9c62xiUPw,1,1,4,ElvTNcPlEvl3eWooQMPjBA

We didn't care for it. A family of four, we all ordered burritos and they were sort of season-less muck. I am a vegetarian and their offering was confusing with huge chunks of squash - which if they had been anywhere near hot - might not have been so bad. 

While it is understandable that the store is a relatively new addition to the strip mall and the crew are just getting the hang of things - it doesn't leave us with a enough faith to try them again.

I was really impressed by Hot Head's! The individual ingredients were great (I got the pork like I usually do other places), but what really made it unique was all the sauce choices. I got the sweet habanero in the burrito and the hot head sauce on the side. Being able to mix and match sauces livens up the options instead of the same old combinations.

Service was super friendly, since the place is still really new I cut them some slack on the little stuff (two tries to roll the burrito, etc.) but none of it really effected my experience.

2008189,2016-01-17,21,UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA,"Hot Head Burritos is an Ohio based chain that just opened up in the Southern Highlands area at Southern Highlands Pkwy and Cactus in the center near Smith's and Subway. 

The concept is simple. It's pretty much just like Chipotle in which you pick what you want and go down the line of items and let them know what you want. The menu options are burritos, bowls, tacos, nachos or quesadillas. Then they have various ingredients you can add: plain or brown rice, black or pinto beans, pico, corn, verde salsa, wild salsa, sour cream, cheddar or monterey jack cheeses, lettuce, banana peppers, jalapeños, onions, and guacamole ($1.00 upcharge).

The thing that differentiates them from being labeled as just another Chipotle rip-off is the fact that they have a bunch of different sauces that you can put on top to give it an extra kick or flavor like Hot Head sauce, Tabasco chipotle, Cholula hot sauce, honey bbq, ranch, sweet habanero, taco sauce, buffalo sauce, extreme habanero, and straight habanero.

For what it was, it was good, not great. Don't roll up in here expecting the second coming of the Chipotle Gods but if you are looking for something very similar with a bit of a different flair, it'll do the trick. I didn't notice any gristle on the meat, like I have at Chipotle, which is why I stopped eating there. Plus, Chipotle has had some big issues lately with an e. coli outbreak in many locations so I wouldn't risk it, at the very least until they get all that straight.

Cons - the workers were so unprofessional. Not one of them asked me if I was ready to order or acknowledged me. 2 of the female workers were busy goofing off with their buddies. When I went to pay one of the workers' buddy reached over to playfully hit her right in front of me which I had to avoid him. I thought that was really rude and unprofessional. When I was picking selections I kept asking questions about certain items and the female worker looked annoyed that i was asking them. So I just made my selection quick and simple. It took forever to ring my order up because again the female worker was too busy chatting with her buddies.

Pros - it's close to my house

If you are going to come to this place, which I HIGHLY recommend you do, then make sure you try their sauces. This is what they are known for. 

The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about everything. The manager was really cool too. The actual sitting area was small, but they said that they are going to be opening up 2 more locations in south Las Vegas soon. Give them a try, and find out for yourself!",lxsPd5bbMWypaE80Pjtnkw,0,0,5,nocaYr8u22UtcTXrS-sVPg

I felt like I was looking at chipotle with a makeover, staff was dull and when I got home the food wasn't impressive either, brown rice was so hard it crunches, put very little meat so paid extra for double which still seemed like very little.

We were greeted by a few gentleman and I presume the business owner. I came in with my co workers around 12:30 today and I got the most delicious chicken bowl (keep in mind I hardly ever eat meat) the process was absolutely painless and I was in and out in about five minutes. They packed my stuff to go because I'm a dainty eater so I get to definitely save some for later. 

I will be coming back and this will be my new lunch spot. Clean, quality food, and great prices. Thanks hot head! :)",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,4,4,3,dRKMvPss0abOchnLlAUaiQ

Today I had chipotle of which I had not visited in quite some time with the recent issues. Hothead is way better and about the same cost. So that is my comparison test.

I had a bowl with brown rice, black beans,spicy chicken, pico, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. Clearly, I had a lot of flavors going on! I got home, ready to dive in...it was blah. Not bad, just blah. The rice had no flavor. The chicken would have been awful without me adding the spicy sauce. 

This place has great potential, if they can up the flavor factor. I'd be willing to try it again in a few months.",94rmRlAhItB4etRDJ7CVQA,1,0,2,Z8gOHWKHdwyfqcjn9MteiQ

When I walk in the door I'm greeted by the best damn staff on the planet. Super friendly, extremely attentive. Jonathan even gave me great sauce combos to try. Hands down the 4 star rating comes from the amazing staff.

Now to the food. It was missing flavor. Rice, meat, even the beans.. All devoid of flavor. Had I not tried a small amount of the special sauces that Jonathan packed in small cups I would have totally been upset.

5556719,2016-01-18,3,UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA,"when I walked into Hot Heads I immediately thought of chipotle.  With the chipotle E. Coli outbreak ... could this place fulfill my chipotle needs ?  

The men at the register greeted me immediately, super friendly and excited.  You can tell the workers down the line were looking nervous and shy (which is normal for a new place, they'll be pros soon). It was quite packed when I came in and I felt a little rush to order, so what do you do?!  ... order what you would at chipotle and compare so this review is based solely on that.

The set up is similar, choose between burritos, bowls, tacos, or nachos and then add the ingredients you desire.  

Meat.  The steak was cold and overcooked.  Cooked too dry for me, but I'm a girl who enjoys steak done medium rare or medium.  My fiancé had the chicken and I would recommend that as the alternative.

Corn.  I love corn, so I ordered a extra side of corn.  I would prefer a little more flavor added, but it wasn't bad.  

Guacamole.  If you enjoy a smooth texture you may enjoy their guac.  It was a little too mushy for me.  

Overall ... I wasn't satisfied because of
flavor, however Hot Heads has a bunch of different sauces to add to your meal to kick it up so I need to test them out (like I said before, I was feeling rushed because of the line and the workers didn't really mention the sauces so I just ordered my burrito as if it was chipotle) 
Also they mention they will have ""different"" flavored tortillas soon.  What kinds ?  They weren't sure yet. 

Ok Hot Heads I gave you 3 stars because it was just ok, but I'm definitely coming back to try your ""mild 2 wild"" flavors ...
please don't let me down.",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,7,4,3,sOGOk3EfgVBRwpEOWu_n0Q

Their menu of custom sauces make it so you can change up the taste in your order. I recommend Hot Head Sauce, which is a garlic based taco sauce. Of all the meats options, I prefer their chicken. Good flavor, marinaded, lean. I also like some of their meal deals. We get the family pack, which comes with two burritos, two kids meals, chips and drinks for all for $27. 

UPDATE: Returned on 7/22/17. Tried to order the ""Family Pack"" which we have ordered numerous times before. Item was posted on the menu for $27 as it has always been. Was promptly told by the employee that they have a new system and new ownership and that they had to ring everything separate instead of in the pack so the price would be higher. We protested that this was a posted item and price. We stated that they should tell the new owner they should change the sign. He said that he was sure they would eventually change it. After informing them that the last time we were there they had a new system and they still honored the price. After much protest we decided to leave, at which time they stated they would honor the price. We told them it was too late. I commented that this was why no one was in there and that's what they should tell the owner. We went across the street to Del Taco. It was delicious.

5745674,2016-03-16,0,UUfioP3G4Qowm0x2HQlPtA,"You've got to give this place a chance. Their meats are absolutely delicious. The Barbacoa is spicy! Chicken is seasoned perfectly. The steak is steak. If that makes any sense. 

In the last 24 hours since our initial visit, there is amazing consistency in their food quality. The establishment is well maintained and cleaned frequently. We've tried most, if not all, of their sauces. Don't drown out your meal by piling up all the add-ons. They drown out the fantastic taste of their meats. I ask for the sauces on the side and can add heat or sweetness as needed. The wild salsa, was spicy on top of their extreme habanero sauce. Holy moly!!! 

We will be back. I've left my original post below. But, I think I'm loving this place. 

-----------------------

I really wanted to love this place. The owner and staff are super friendly. The restaurant is very clean. Prices are the same as Chipotle and Qdoba. Food portions are comparable. 

But there was no flavor in the food. I had the spicy chicken burrito bowl, easy white rice, black beans, Pico de gallo, med red salsa, sour cream, lettuce and cheese. They gave me a couple sides of the sauces - hot head and ranch. The sauces were great it was necessary. 

I'll come back again and try it with the other sauces. Because I really want to love this place.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,1,1,5,fhpYPifuUeIX2psu05G_HQ
