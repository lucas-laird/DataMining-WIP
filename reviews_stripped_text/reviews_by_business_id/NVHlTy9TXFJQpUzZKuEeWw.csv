Pizza is greasy, toppings slide off when picking a slice, cheese flavors weren't particularly prominent. Didn't really like how onions were chopped so finely instead of in strips, and somehow tasted almost slimy? Pie itself seemed undercooked.

2688786,2013-04-27,3,NVHlTy9TXFJQpUzZKuEeWw,"NOTE: This review is not for the food, because I left without eating.

The reason I did not eat was because of the following scenario.  We were all starved, and walking home from the nearby Smith's when we saw Sarfino's.  I love pizza, so we beelined in.  The place was completely empty, and the only two employees were two extremely unclean looking guys behind the counter, which was pristine clean and stainless steel.  While I was standing there, deciding what to order, I pulled out a wet-nap to wash my hands with, as the guy stood at the counter watching me.  I then approached the counter, and put my purse down to get out my wallet and tell him my order.  

Here's the bizarre part: this weird employee took out a ballpoint pen and proceeded to *draw* blue pen ink all over my freshly washed hand.  I was annoyed, confused, and unhappy with that.  Im not sure what he was trying to do - flirt with me, or just be an ass - he certainly accomplished the latter.  At that point, after I got my speaking abilities back, I told him to cancel my order, as I'd thought the better of ordering from his establishment, and we left.  

There are a lot of far better places in town if it's pizza you seek.  My advice is to avoid this joint, in spite of the glowing recommendations I see, because the guy in there gave me the serious creeps, and the place didnt smell like pizza. Ive always been taught that if you go into a pizza place and it doesnt smell like pizza, its best to leave.",GwY8RwgYPuer3PmSfgyKwQ,1,0,1,qU4HiZyfLCd0fMhqD-Yl4Q

4147704,2012-11-20,2,NVHlTy9TXFJQpUzZKuEeWw,"I seem to recall ordering from here once before I ordered today though I can't seem to remember when that was or even what I ordered.  I guess it wasn't too memorable.  So before I forget again, here is my review for the day.

My office ordered from Sarfino's for lunch today.  I ordered a lamb gyro.  One co-worker got a lunch special #6, a meatball sub with fries and a Coke.  Another co-worker ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  My gyro was loaded with onion which I don't like but it is my own fault for not ordering without.  I should have known better.  Aside from that, the meat was flavorful but on the dry side.  The tzatziki sauce was thick and very good.  The fries were soggy from sitting in the box.  The meatball sandwich ordered looked incredible.  Three big meatballs smothered in cheese.  I shant repeat myself on the status of the fries.  The Philly looked good too.  A good amount of meat with a lot of yellow cheese.  If you want cheese on your steak be sure to order the cheese steak rather than the plain steak.  Sarfino's has several varieties of steak sandwich.

When I placed my order,  hanging up the phone at 11:04, I was told it would be about 45-55 minutes.  I waited for one full hour before calling to check the status.  I was told the driver had left and should have arrived.  The driver called about 1 minute later.  I thought this was a long wait for a couple of sandwiches.  Then I realized that Sarfino's is not all close to my office.  I think we are on the edge of their delivery zone.  So the time it took to arrive, while irritating, is acceptable.

Perhaps now that I have written my review I will remember ordering from Sarfino's in the future.  It may be a while before I order from here again.  The food is okay but not for how long it takes to prepare and deliver.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,3,1lkHnpKhB_z_uEnqRTKeWA

4243550,2009-11-11,0,NVHlTy9TXFJQpUzZKuEeWw,"I learned about this place because they had slipped a take out menu underneath my door at the hotel I was staying at. Even though I adore pizza, I was feeling less than enthusiastic about ordering from some random business that I didn't know a thing about, but we ordered a large veggie and salad anyways. Turns out, the pizza was actually quite good! The crust was amazing - nice and fluffy and totally edible. Plus, they didn't skimp on ingredients - both on the pizza and on the salad. I really hate it when restaurants get cheap when it comes to giving you your vegetables, but Sarfino's did not disappoint.

It was bad on both of those last visits. I was really counting on the nourishment since I was in for a long and active night in. On one of the visits the pizza was even burned charcoal black on a few of the slices crust. 


Ok so my biggest issue with eateries is that some of them are just not consistent. When I have a good memory then visit and it is bad, it really sucks round hanging flesh!

One day a pizza is great then the next it is thin, dry and bare of cheese and toppings. This is what has happened the last two times. 

I understand having an every day pizza special, but come on put some toppings on the pizza. If I wanted baked plain dough that is thin and dry chewy I would ask for it!

I wish I had snapped a photo of the last pizza we got, it was  bare with so many bubbles that were not even covered.

Bad, Bad, Bad.
