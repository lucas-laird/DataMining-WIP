I saw dishes that looked good.  Much better than virtually all of the Chinese food in Austin. 

Personally, I just ordered a few pieces of sushi for lunch with a glass of wine.   The sushi was good, albeit overpriced.  They had fatty tuna!  (I'm excited because it doesn't exist in Texas that I know of.)   The fish was sliced thin -- but was really really good.   I very much enjoyed it.

But the food was horrible. I can taste the MSG in the sauce. And the meat didn't even taste like meat. It was so mushy I felt like I was eating tofu shaped beef. I tried the singapore noodles, which was a bad idea. It was very bland... that's the best thing I can say about it.

2144053,2013-11-21,0,NFOj3uboFzeNF5X-dWUd_w,"I was looking forward to a tuna melt at the Cafe in Harrah's the night I arrived, unfortunately, the 24 hour cafe was closed on Thursdays for several hours in the evenings.

So, right next door was Ming's Table!  Perhaps the cafe being closed in the evening hours is a ploy to drive more business to the casino's other restaurants?  Anyway, I was hungry and didn't want to pay for room service, so in I went.

I was seated immediately.  Seating is ample and there is a nice little seating area fenced in out front where you can watch the human element as they trek by.  If you like to people watch, ask for a seat there.  Personally, I had my kindle in hand and just wanted a quiet table tucked away in the back where I could eat and read in peace.

Sadly, the best part of the meal was the hot tea.  It was a green tea, light and fragrant and they bring out the entire pot so you can refill your mug at your own convenience.  

I ordered a sushi roll, the Dragon roll.  It came out almost immediately which concerned me somewhat as there is tempura shrimp in it which should normally require cooking before assembly if the roll was made fresh!  Well, it wasn't fresh, it was pre-cooked and perhaps just assembled to order.  At least the spicy tuna molded on top of the roll was tasty.

I got the Pepper Steak for dinner.  Unfortunately, while the portion was huge (served on a family serving style platter), it was terribly bland.  The sauce had no heat or spiciness whatsoever and was overpowered by the amount of fragrant ginger used in it.  The meat wasn't carmelized at all, it looked like it had been boiled and dropped into the weak sauce.  The peppers were poorly cut... big ole chunks, including from the bottom of the bell pepper... who wants to eat that??  I'm experienced with a pair of chopsticks, but I had to work overtime to get these things from plate to mouth without firing them off in all directions.  In the end, I only ate about a quarter of the dish, and while I had a fridge in my suite, I didn't bother asking for the rest to go.

I had the spring rolls, which were unremarkable. Maybe there's no way to make those things good. (Or maybe I just don't like them very much and should order something else!)

The special fried rice was decent, with a good flavor and good selection of meats and veggies throughout. It was not too oily. The hallmark of lousy fried rice is that it's swimming in oil. That was not the case here.

My order was taken by the hostess, who was unable to answer any questions about the food. ""What's in the ____?"" I asked. ""I don't have any idea,"" she said, ""I'm just helping out the waiter."" Well, not really, you're not.

So we started off with some appetizers. Had the crab rangoons, minced chicken lettuce wrap and pan fried dumplings. When it came out, I wanted to get up and asked if someone had stolen our crab rangoons. There were only 4 rangoons, and 2 pieces of chicken lettuce wraps that I could have easily snorted up my nostrils with 1 hit. It was difficult to split everything when there's 5 of us with 4 rangoons, 2 lettuces with minced chicken and about 5 dumplings. I didn't find any of it tasty because I was frustrated.

When the food came, it was just chinese food that I could have easily ordered from a local chinese take out. I don't know why they make it seem so upscale for.

Food:
-Grouper with the soy sauce and scallions-doesn't taste like anything buy soy sauce and scallion
-green bean with xo sauce-the green beans have a nice crunch to it, but the sauce made it a bit salty
-thin crisp noodles w/scallops, shrimps, and veggies-not my thing
-clay pot with veggies, beef and other stuff-nah
-salmon sashimi-i ate the piece that had a slice of lemon on top, the killed the buttery salmon flavor that i enjoy most...no bueno
-hamachi-taste like it was previously frozen
-passion tea with fresh fruits-YUMMMY!  we had even asked for some to go!
-green tea icecream-you know how some icecream was in the freezer for quite some time and when you eat it, you can taste the ice filming on it?  yep yep, that's what I had.  In addition to that, the inside of my icecream ball was hollow :(

My bf's mother had just checked in to her room and taking the time to research a good restaurant or walk around to find something familiar would've taken too long. I ordered the Salt & Pepper Pork because I loved eating Salt & Pepper chicken back home & figured this would taste similar. My bf ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp & Scallop Fried Rice (which didn't really have scallops. Scallop flakes were just mixed in with the rice). His mother ordered a seafood soup. The food came out and the soup was the first thing that I had. It tasted okay. The seafood in it was bland. Then I went for the Salt & Pepper Pork. The first bite that I took, I spit out. It tasted like fat! So I bit into the other end and it was still fat! So i tried another piece just to see if I just happened to get a fat piece the first time, but nope! The second piece that I tried was fatty too! Hated it!!! I went for the rice next and it wasn't so bad. Not as flavorful but it was definitely better than the fat that I had just eaten. Sad that the meal wasn't going as well as I had hoped, I was willing to give the Honey Walnut Shrimp a chance. Wrong decision. It was nasty!! The glaze didn't taste anything like the typical Honey Walnut Shrimp glaze that I was used to. Tasted like fatty mayo was glazed all over it. I wanted to raise my voice as I complained about the food, but I also didn't want to start trouble. I think I was also just shocked at how many large groups were dining there. I wondered if they actually liked their food cuz non of them had that disgusted/dissatisfied look on their faces. It could be that they weren't as affected by the food because they were enjoying each other's company, or it could also be that they weren't starving before they ate, so they weren't as let down as I was.

After traveling for over 14 hours to get from DC to Vegas, and enduring BO and disobedient children (other people's) on the flights. And dealing with the front desk at Harrah's who tried to stick me in a smoking room....I was exhausted and starving.

We tried to go to KGB Burgers first, but after standing around for 5 minutes waiting to be seated, we left. ZERO stars for them!

We headed over to Ming's Table. Now, I have had my fair share of excellent chinese food in DC and San Fran- so keep that in mind with my review.

We ordered Chicken and Seafood Udon Soup. 

We got Chicken and Seafood Udon stirfry. (It came out really fast)

As this point we have been awake for almost 20 hours. We told the waiter nevermind, we'll just keep it.

It actually was quite tasty, good fresh large pieces of scallops, shrimp, 

But it isn't what we ordered. When the waiter brought us the bill, he didn't even comp our $3.50 pot of tea. The entire bill after tip and tax was $43.

Steep for what we got, not horrible I guess for Vegas.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Ming's. If you are staying in Harrah's and it's late and you don't feel like going out, nor spending a lot of money and you're in the mood for Chinese, it's not too bad.

The best part was the Dan Dan Noodles.  Lo Mein noodles with chopped pork, water chestnuts and mushrooms in a great gravy poured over top, with as few or as many thinly sliced jalapenos for spice.  SO GOOD!  Definitely the best thing we ate there.  The Supreme Lo Mein was good, but not great.  The shrimp were cooked really well, which is sometimes a feat in itself.  The BBQ Spare Ribs were basic.  The Volcano is a huge bowl of tropical fruit juices and rum, with a shot of 151 floating in the middle.  Yum for sharing! 

I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service was not great.  Our waitress visited the table next to us three times before even coming over to say hello to us.

Whenever I walked by it was never busy so no need to wait in a line like many restaurants on the Strip. Nice service but not overly friendly.,HPJY5cQ7Za6Hi07eB3gvZA,1,1,3,QZdT5JT5O0UBOcY9khqvuA

It was just incredibly greasy, poorly prepared food. The only dish that was decent was the pork fried rice. Pretty tough to really mess this up but surprised they didn't!
Food served quickly. Then service disappeared. Strange place. Never again.",mswloq-IjRr9yXLhBqBPAw,1,0,1,jz4TUW0uKLf0Zsa16rj-0w

All the dishes were way too salty.  The house special soup was cold!  Everything was expensive.

The only good thing that I can say is that it did not get a 1 star rating from me.  We will not repeat coming back here again.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,1,0,2,BjFHW7bvgWn3-UkOTQGYBA
