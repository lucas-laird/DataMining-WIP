So I decided to give this place a try. My boyfriend and I walked in. He didn't see anything appetizing in the food trays. So I looked at the menu and immediately saw crab Rangoon which my other place doesn't have. I ordered two and waited in excitement only to pay and get to my car. I took out the sweet and sour sauce didn't even want to try it because it was completely watered down. Then I bite into one of the rangoon and it's really hard, oily, and there's only some kind of nasty cheese in it! My boyfriend ate the other one and he gagged from the cheese. I won't be coming here again. There was a Latino and white guy cooking. I'll keep going to MB China where there are oriental cooks who know what they are doing!",uPA6ma0oYNTFRjBK4W0Fxg,0,0,1,05g74xTcWf8smo3bHirkkw

   I frequent the area a lot because I get my haircut in the same strip mall and so I arrived here and should've quickly turned back around and out the door immediately after spoting the dirty trays as I peeked over near where the food was.  Completely appalling.  Tried the food only because it was in a to-go box and to no surprise wasn't impressed.  The sesame chicken was hard, the plastic fork couldn't go through it.  Decided that was enough and left.",FaeY4ILFh6r1WpJDWc19Tw,1,0,1,c3lgU1zJcqC1kRppzctzRA
4351819,2012-09-02,0,Q_adT88BLalj0dRlnD_ibw,One word...WOW!!!! Amazing! I have finally Found the Chinese restaurant that I've been looking for. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and it was exceptional with a healthy amount of shrimp. I also got the sesame chicken and it was perfectly sweet! The kung pao chicken is spicy without being overbearing and the egg rolls and Rangoon are perfect! I recommend completely.,ToDmZW47JEoa5pFDDwtjfQ,1,0,5,bJd012vjfq9FDDcCUN119w
