78485,2015-06-07,0,hgeXEGD9lRX4ohj7afSJnw,I saw many good reviews about this place so I wanted to give it a try.  Sadly I  have to say I was disappointed in the one item I ordered. I ordered an or of Pad see eew for lunch and it came out very quickly. There was only 1 table dining when I placed the togo order which I got in less than 5 minutes. I paid about $10 bucks but wasn't  able to enjoy it at all. The noodles were so greasy that there was a layer of oil at the bottom of the togo box. The noodles were all broken into small pieces and soggy. Total disappointment!,95XWgSWlid_Y37RcYJNE1w,0,0,3,ghVj3F87xA3ipgGE9ibqyg

They forgot one of the order so we had to wait an additional 20 minutes, after my whole party had finished eating. The waiters had no interest in customer service. Our waiter was by himself working the whole restaurant, he did the best he could. They need to hire more servers and probably more cooks.

I asked for a refund and they voided the wrong order and I had to come back once again to get my order refunded. They had no commission and still wanted to charge me to reorder the food even though they were the ones that made the mistake.

Then a lady came took our order and our meal came out one at a time every 5 to 10 minutes later. Our food should have came out all together. But it didn't end there it seem they made a mistake with one of our order and it never came out so we ask them to cancel it because it seem they had  made a mistake and had not put in this order with the kitchen or wrong order was put in. This is when the fun begin, their server didnt even apologize and try to make us pay for the mistake when we told them to cancel it. The server said ok and we told them we will pay our bills. The cashier didnt give us our bill and just gave us a total amount (illegal) which we gave her our card. Then we realize the amount didnt add up so we asked for the bill there is when we found out they charge us for the cancel order and didn't want to show they charge it by not trying to show us our bills. So we had them void the last charge and charge the correct bill minus the cancel order. Still no apology and just yelling from the cashier. We will stop going to this place.

At first, I thought the soup was good but as I kept on eating I felt the soups we ordered (duck noodle and beef noodle) were a little too sweet for my taste. Usually Thai food comes with the seasoning sides, I prefer pickled Thai chillies than jalapeños (that's what they serve).

900948,2015-10-02,1,hgeXEGD9lRX4ohj7afSJnw,"First off, loyal customers and fans of this place. I never thought I would 1 star this restaurant, it was my favorite place just before what you're about to read, I swear! 
But just as I would go to a restaurant with mediocre food and great service, I will not support a restaurant with good food and horrible service. PLEASE, be non bias when reading, thanks.
Ordered a few panang curries and 2 noodle items, carryout. The panang curries were very watered down and tasted like it, usually it's perfect and that's why we ordered there so often. But hey mistakes happen, no biggie right, right.
So... We called... They asked us to drive back the food, for replacements. At first I didnt want to call, because it was 10 minutes there and then 10 minutes back and the rest of the food not messed up would be cold returning home. But I called because every restaurant deserves a chance to correct their mistake. So I called, they told us if we drove the food back they would have our replacements. So I went, because hey, that's $25 of food I paid for and 20 min to get what I paid for right? 
No problem I guess, seemed like an easy fix even tho it took an extra trip, but that's NOT what they did. 
I walked in and the management immediately, let me say again, ""immediately"" got angry and raised thier voices at me. I was shocked, thrown off and confused. I thought I was just picking up replacements of a few mess ups as I brought the food back like I was told. Walking into a place I go to on a regular and then getting yelled at for something I had no control over (food mistakes).
So I cut off both of them yelling at me, and asked them questions. 
I asked why they were mad at me for the mistakes they see and admitted to, no reply from either manager. I asked why would they yell at me, a regular customer, after I drove back and brought back the food as asked. Again no response.
THIS IS WHERE THE 1 STAR KICKS IN FOR SURE.
They didn't replace the mistakes they made, right they said they would over the phone. Even seeing it for themselves first hand. 
They had us drive back there then changed the offer to, remaking 1 of 3. WOW, really? 
Not only did I have to wait for the 1 of 3 to be remade, I paid for 3 and got 1 remake (that's not what I was told on the phone), I had to drive back there and waste my time, returned home to 2 cold noodle dishes that are supposed to be served hot.
Returning home to the cold noodles and 4 hungry friends/coworkers. I walked in feeling frustrated and still confused to why they did that to me, why they got mad at me, the customer. My friends suggested yelp after I explained what had happemed. They said they will back up the yelp, as they were let down on their first experience with the restaurant. 
SORRY thai style noodle house, but I've never in my life experienced such rude and disrespectful behavior from a business I truly once enjoyed.",5gvtyPUpmel_gHUW8SuN4A,2,1,1,x2RiXkoeBw2XNrZDN2EVAg

off a check and come back whenever the patron is done.

Tried the N.H. Style Pot Stickers as an appetizer. They were good. 

Had to ask for the Thai Spices as none were on the table. Had to get up from my meal to go ask for Salt. 

2 shrimp in the Chicken & Shrimps Silver Noodle. Come on Shrimp is in the name of the dish & you only get 2? And they were small on top of that. I've had bigger shrimp in Shrimp with Lobster Sauce at Chinese restaurants.

The food was pleasantly good.  Not like your average Thai place where everything tastes good but doesn't look good.  They definitely plated with thought.  Things looked and tasted clean and refreshing.  

The pork beef jerky was amazing!  Not too chewy, packed a ton of flavor.  I was craving soup and the Tom Yum had the perfect balance of spice and citrus from the lemon grass.  It's a great detoxing soup and they were on point with the flavor.  

We also had the panang pork curry- level 3 which was perfect to taste the deep and rich flavor.  Any spicier you loose the complexity of the dish.  The chicken satay was chicken breast marinated in a curry coconut and not just sated like most places. I appreciate that extra step of LUV.  I wish the dipping sauce had more peanut punch though.  

The real Winner were the pot stickers.  Nice crunch and dressed up like it was on a date lol.  Looked and tasted like a dish from a nice sushi joint.  The spicy mayo and contrast of teriyaki drizzle and sesame seeds left you wanting a second date!  Lol

Well I finally discovered a stir fried noodle dish that freaking rocks and I have never had this dish anywhere else. It's so freaking good!!! This is one stir fried noodle dish that they have been totally rocking it out on....Khua Kai. It's apparently a Chinese influenced dish lightly seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce and fish sauce. All I can say is that it's deliciousness! They basically cook the large flat rice noodles with egg and fried tofu in my case and place it like a large pancake over bean sprouts. They serve this with sweet chilli sauce. And I add some sambal for heat.  They almost seem to char the noodles and that charred flavor adds a little smoky flavor to this dish that's top notch!!! For me.... Perfect flavor and perfect texture on the noodles!!(5/5). :)

I ordered the Chicken and Shrimps Silver Noodles. I was in the mood for a nice hearty noodle dish for lunch. This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp, nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch, al dente, and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.

The service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me.

2345175,2017-10-03,0,hgeXEGD9lRX4ohj7afSJnw,"This is a small Thai place with a BIG flavors. I found this place over 6 years ago at their first location (Spring Mtn and Wynn) and could not be happier when they finally opened one in my neighborhood. Great authentic taste, great prices, quick great service and generous portion. 

Recap of what we had this time:
Appetizer: Crispy Calamari $6.75. Delicious crispy fresh calamari. It's crispy on the outside and chewy fresh on the inside. Comes with hot and sweet sauce. 
Entree: 
- Green Curry Pork $7.25 - my husband thinks this place has the best green curry in town. Couple of my co-workers second that statement as well. One thing to be aware of: their spicy level is not the same like other Thai joint. If you do not like spicy, try to level it one or two down and you can always add more spice later on. We ordered spicy level #5. Their curry has a perfect balance of spicy anda little bit of sweetness from the coconut milk. Must try! 
- Seafood Tom Yum with Flat Rice Noodle spicy level #7-  $8.95. You can pick your own noodles: thin rice noodles, flat rice noodles, yellow egg noodles or vermicelli. This is a SPICY soup. Perfect for winter. It'll warm your body up. 
- Pad See Euw $7.25. Generous portion for the price. 
- Crispy Noodles with Seafood & Wonton (their Chef's special menu) $8.95. I recommended this dish to try, especially if you like crispy noodles. 
- Tom Kha (coconut milk soup with seafood) $7.25. If you like thai style soup but not on the sour side (tom yum), then this would be a perfect one to try. 

Desert: mango sticky rice $4.25. My favorite desert! 

We had to take some home due to their generous portion. Recommended place to go when you crave Thai food. If you pay with yelp, you'll get some cash back too!",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,0,0,4,ONwSn3s65EaessRYePxD8Q

Be careful of the spiciness though! We ordered 3s and 4s and it was a little much for me. The calamari was delicious, very crunchy and soft on the inside, would definitely recommend. I'd say the pad Thai was above average, not the best I've had but pretty good.

I could get triple the portion for just a couple bucks more elsewhere.

Upon arrival, My boyfriend and I were seated in a booth. The booth that we were seated in was kind of uncomfortable for me bc my seat seemed to be broken? It felt as if I was sliding off my seat the whole time. But it was fine.

Although I'm not Thai, I grew up in Thailand for 15 years. I think people eating here need to remember that this place is called noodle house. That's means they're known for their noodles. This place is the closest I can get to actual Thai street noodles. Although the service could be better, I don't go to a restaurant based on what it looks like or based on the service. I go based on the food and this place hits the mark for me. One of my favorite places to go for Thai noodle soups. 

On another note, Thai noodle soups are also very hard to find here in the US. You can find pho anywhere but, for some reason it's hard to find a decent bowl of Thai noodles.

Found this place through Yelp. (Of course.)
Came here for Saturday dinner at 8 pm. It was not that busy so there was no wait to be seated in this nice comfortable booth.
There were two waitresses working that night and they both waited on us. They were both very nice and attentive.
Their chicken satay had very strong curry flavor but not spicy. I loved it. The peanuts sauce was not just sweet but it had a little spicy taste because the sauce was in some kind of spicy oil. It was good.
Seafood Wonton soup was nice and flavorful. Came with a lot of rice noodles. It's nice  you can pick noodles from four different kinds. 
I ordered my red curry spice level 7. A bit spicier than regular spicy curry. Usually, they never get it right. I often have to send my curry back to put more spice in. Wow. They got it right. It was the perfect spice level 7 taste. I enjoyed my curry very much. Chicken was tender. Lots of veggies in it. 
I saw two Thai customers eating at this place. (I saw them speaking in Thai with the waitresses.) I figure that means the food here is authentic. I don't think I ever saw Tai people eating at other Thai places. Usually I see a lot of Indian people at Thai restaurants lately.

We saw the good reviews on Yelp! and decided to give it a shot.

Wow! What a gem!

Things I like-

- Ordered the Tom Yum soup with vermicelli noodles ($6.95), the chicken pad see ew($6.95), and the BBQ chicken fried rice (also $6.95) Portions were very healthy for the price point and everything tasted so yummy!
- the chicken pad see ew almost had a subtle sweetness to its flavoring that made the dish very tasty! Not overpowering, but still noticeable ...it was just right! :)
- the chicken fried rice was very tasty and the rice was soft and fluffy!
- the tom yum was served in a HUGE bowl and this was the first time I've had it served to me in town with the vermicelli noodles. So tasty and full of flavor!
- service was friendly and competent. 
- the actual restaurant itself is very spacious and is tastefully decorated. Lots of purple and pink!

Things I did not like-

- the soft drinks, once again, served in a can ($1.50 each). Argh! 

Aside from the whole soda in a can thing, I love this place and will definitely be back on numerous occasions! Great food, in healthy portions, at a reasonable price! This place is somewhere you definitely want to make a point to check out if you appreciate some good Thai food!

I asked to keep a menu so that I could order a to-go item to take home and the server actually told me he needed it back so that was that. The tea came up right away and my daughter commented that it mostly tasted like milk and sugar. The beef noodle soup came up next and was no more than mediocre. The beef sliced seemed rubbery and lacked flavor. The basil chicken was alright, but it the vegetables were extremely undercooked...more like slightly warmed up, but still raw.

3386703,2015-10-30,2,hgeXEGD9lRX4ohj7afSJnw,"So, I'm disappointed. 

For me, one of the most beautiful things about living in this town is the accessibility to good food and even better service at all price points at the drop of a hat. 

AMAZING restaurants with little to no wait...EVER. I started going to Thai Style Noodle house a few years ago at the Ft. Apache location. They have amazing food, at great prices...it was my ""go to"" for takeout dinners. 

To my pleasant surprise, I found this location near my work. I frequent Soho House and Scoop in the same strip mall (both of which are spectacular). 

So let's get some perspective. My husband and I are in our mid 30's. Both professionals, and eat out 6 nights a week...solid. We don't cook. We go to Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, American, Indian...you name it, we like it. We are true foodies. 

To be fair, the food/price balance here is excellent. I've never had anything but delicious food from the Ft. Apache location. 

But this location.  Ugh. 

We order from this place (from the office) on average once every 2 weeks.  I get the same thing for lunch every time. Every time, I get pad see ew with a level 3 out of 10 spice.   Side note: I put sriracha on my foods, I get the hot salsa at Mexican restaurants...I'm good with spice. But at lunch, with the pad see ew, I get a 3 because I don't want the spice to take anything away from the delicious flavor of the noodles themselves. 

Sometimes I'm sad and I can't taste any of the spice. I figure, it's ok. Still delicious. 

But today...today we ordered the same. When I opened the box, I knew there was a problem. I could see red everywhere. Every single bite I loaded on my fork had visibly 10-15 specks of red chili flakes.  I took 3 bites and was literally sweating. SWEATING!!  My pregnant coworker who can't get enough spice had ordered a level 5 out of 10 and couldn't even put down 3 bites!!  

We called, politely explaining that the food was nearly inedible and guess what we got??? 

ATTITUDE!  

We were told ""WELL IM NOT CREDITING YOU UNLESS YOU BRING BACK THE UNEATEN FOOD"". Wow??  Who asked for a refund?  We want lunch. 

Then when we said ""ok, we can bring it back"" we got a lecture about spice. 

Anyways....

When we walk in, we get eye rolling from the young man working the counter. And he proceeds to tell us (literally, no exaggeration) ""WE CAN NOT CONTROL THE SPICE. IT DEPEND ON THE CHILLI"". 

Are you EFFING kidding?  Have I not eaten Thai food a thousand times?!  Then he refuses to make the food with any spice. 

I've never met a ruder person. To be so rude and diva-like to two women who just want some edible lunch!!  

I won't be coming back. I guess that's why this place is always empty. Lol. 

I used to feel bad and always suggest it to people. No more!!!  Stay away!!!  

There are a dozen other Thai restaurants in a 5 mile radius. Go elsewhere!!  

To management or the owner, take note that customer service MEANS something. And you've lost a customer (and anyone I can tell).",YORMpDXL2s7X1JD2iUAWtw,6,0,1,vK5-k6cqW_1uK7bZnUFpoA

Along the far left wall, there are three more booths that offer more privacy -- kind of like having your own VIP section. A regal wooden paneling envelops one side of the restaurant dotted with white tufted single chairs. I know they're trying to look modern, but for me, it comes off disjointed and more of a beauty salon look... but hey, at least it's clean! 

Food: Of course, my bf ordered the chicken yellow curry. His review of his dish is that they skimped on the chicken and used sweet potatoes instead of regular ones. Fair enough. I had their pad see ewe with tofu. They give you the option of soft or fried, so I went with the latter. Let me just say, this is probably one of the best pad see ewes I've had! (Yeah, really!) It was just the right portion and they sprinkle it with some type of fried garlic on top. Price-wise, they're a little bit cheaper than comparable Thai places, so I was quite surprised. 

Service was good. It could have been better considering there was literally only one other table besides us there, but the workers seem to be on their own breaks? Not sure, but I'd definitely wouldn't rule them out. We'll be back!

Next, they did not even check up on us if we needed anything else. (Napkins, refill, if we are doing okay, etc.). The food was bland and was horribly made. Would not recommend. I don't know how this place is getting 5 stars!!

Since no one came by at all I had to go up and find somebody just to get my check. The weirdest part is that this place was nowhere near busy! So why didn't they check up on their customers? Why do I have to walk from my table all the way to the counter just to ask for someone to take our order, get us items, and our check? 

When I left this place, the server FOUND ME ON FACEBOOK AND MESSAGED ME. He sent me a photo of the receipt and asked if I had put down my real signature. SO INTRUSIVE!!!!!

I used to go to their Chinatown location, then started going to the Fort Apache location and now that there is one literally 5 mins from my house, it just makes it too easy to order for pick up or dine in.

So far, I've shared this restaurant with all my coworkers and they all LOVE this place.  Everyone's favorite (including myself) has been the duck noodle soup, I get mine with egg noodles and add wonton.  For a year or two, it was the ONLY dish I would order...I would look over the menu and tell myself I was going to try something else but always went back to the duck noodle soup..crazy right?  Well one day, I saw a Vietnamese family all order the same thing at the table next to us.  I asked the waiter what they were eating and discovered Rad Na...so I started ordering Rad Na for a while.  It was delicious!  Flat rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and your chose of meat in a yummy gravy..my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

Gradually I've worked through the menu, it was been at least 5 years since I've discovered Thai Style Noodle House and I have to say my current crush and my go to lately is their Pad See Eew and their Spicy Eggplant with rice, but the must have with any rice dish (you can find it on their sides menu) is their egg omelette with pork.

Are they the BEST in Vegas? No if you take into account Lotus of Siam, BUT, they are great if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg.

First off, when we got there a lady brought us water, with 1 little piece of ice? Not a big deal ok, but then we noticed all our drinks had things floating around in it?? We ask the lady to get us new waters. She kindly did, brought it back again with no ice. I asked for ice because I like my beverages cold. She tells me ""oh the ice is dirty"" I'm like dirty? She said ""yes that's what's floating in your water.""

Should have just walked out then.. Regretted it.

We ordered our food, ordered SHRIMP FRIED RICE, Pad Thai and Padse eww.

The lady brings us SHRIMP rolls and states ""I'm sorry for the Inconvience"" we atomatically assumed it was a comped treat due to the fact that they had dirty ice in our drinks. So we ate it!

Then they gave us the pad Thai, don't get me wrong it was alright. Could have been better.

And 15 min later came out with the pad se eww, we thought the fried rice was coming since the food was taking forever to get to the table. Finally 15 min after we got the pad se eww, we asked where our SHRIMP FRIED RICE was. The lady comes and tells me there no record of that order, when the server clearly repeated my orders to me before he walked away! Oh already livid she brings me the check..

AND GUESS WHAT!

She charged me for the shrimp rolls that I DIDNT ORDER! I asked her why she charged me, stating that I ordered shrimp fried rice and you didn't get me that not shrimp rolls. 
She then asked ""why did you eat it?"" I informed her we assumed it was compd since you said sorry for the Inconvience when giving it to us.

She then went to talk to the chief and server and came back stating THEY!! READ THAT, she said THEY!! Made a mistake with my friends rice & that we ate it so we have to charge you. I informed her if I knew you ordered it for us, then we wouldn't have at it.

I love the food at the other location. At this location the first time I came the Khua Kai was consistent with the other location. On my second visit it was not appetizing. The noodles were barely seared and there was a pile of pepper in the center of my dish. If this was my first time here it would be unlikely that I would return. :( I love the food at the other location so much so I may try it again. It could be that they are new and working out the kinks so I may give it another shot.


[DECOR]
I'm a huge fan of the other location on Tropicana and Ft. Apache. This location is a little awkward. It's too spacious and it feels very empty and unwelcoming.

[SERVICE]
When I arrived the server was assisting a to go order at the register. If I hadn't been to their other location I wouldn't have known that I needed to wait to be seated. The server didn't greet me with so much as a smile while she was assisting her other guest or say ""I'll be right with you"". I would recommend putting a sign to the right of the entrance similar to the other location that says ""please wait to be seated"" along with a sofa or bench where people can sit while they are waiting to be assisted. Currently there is just a tall plant there. 

My plate arrived almost 10 minutes after my husbands plate did. I had requested extra sauce and had to repeat my request when my plate arrived, and again after I finished half of my meal. About 15-20 minutes before the bill arrived I finished my Thai tea and wanted some water but the server never stopped by my table. During our meal there were 2 servers and three tables including ours...

But then, for $6.95, the bowl of soup was pretty filling and I must say I was please with the portion for that price. 

On the other hand, the service I got towards the end with the male cashier will stop me from returning as a patron.  The girl who took my order and served my table was very nice and knew the meaning of customer service.  But the male cashier was beyond rude.

5084704,2015-08-20,4,hgeXEGD9lRX4ohj7afSJnw,"Common question of a work day: ""What's for lunch?"" 

Common answer: ""Thai""

I love Thai places at lunch that offer lunch specials because it's such a bang for your buck. Recently, my go-to, Archi's failed me. Disappointed with their pad thai, I was left to venture out other spots. 

Guess what? Thai Style Noodle House does NOT offer lunch specials, but their prices, portions, and taste make up for it! 

The pad thai was pretty good, not the best. It came out with a zero spice level, due to the server not asking ""how spicy."" I had to ask for the spice rack to cater to my taste buds. I also ask for lime, which they did not have. Um, ok. They had lime juice, which I accepted. 

Yellow curry with tofu was tasty and they really hook you up with the tofu! The curry did not taste sickly sweet like some other places. 

Since my child was with me, I opted for a ""bland"" side dish. I got the scrambled egg with ground pork dish for $3ish. Perfect. It looked and tasted like a Filipino torta. It was a big portion and only dented 1/6 of it. 

Those on 30 minute lunches, I would advise calling in your order and picking up. Those with 1 hour lunches, it may not be realistic to dine in either. From ordering to receiving our food, was about 30 minutes. Then you have consider driving to and from, plus actual eating time, paying, and boxing everything up. 

Interior is cool, modern, and spacious. Seating is like 90% booths. Service was average.

I think this place would've gotten more stars from me if the portion sizes had been a little bigger, for one - they seemed to be on the small size for my taste; and also, there were only a few vegetarian options on the menu.

We asked several questions since many items were unknown to us, though we're very Thai-food-savvy.  Our server recommended the Three Flavor Grill Salmon which we ordered, along with the Pumpkin Curry with chicken, both dishes at $8.95@.  

First, the atmosphere...  the restaurant is large for an Asian one & the booths are painted bright purple, with unusual seating configurations.  If we had known before ordering that the radio was coming on with news, etc. we'd have made our exit.  Second, the rice... it was not Jasmine but a very cheap variety.  The silverware is for picnics & the small white plates are plastic.  

Third, the food... the pumpkin (butternut squash) was too soft and the sauce really tasted canned.  The other ingredients are what I dislike in Asian food, big chunks of white onion, carrots & green bell pepper.  As for the salmon with chopped chicken, it was very fishy & the sweet sauce tasted, again, like canned & not fitting for these ingredients (which also contained the onion, green bell & carrots).  No basil or other greens were on the plates.  And our server never came over to inquire how we liked the food & when we got to the salmon dish, called her over to complain about the very fishy taste.  No substitute was offered.

The menu choices look terrific & all prices are reasonable.  If you are, however, familiar with Thai food & have enjoyed it all around town, I believe you'd be disappointed here.  I think I've learned my lesson... if someone recommends a restaurant, I'll first ask how many times they've dined out on the particular cuisine, and where.

The chicken fried rice was delicious and light. It did not feel oily like how other Asian style fried rice dishes can be. The chicken and rice was seasoned well too. I ordered the chicken pad thai spicy level 6 (1-10 scale). Unlike other places where spiciness can overpower flavor, their take on it balanced both really well. The peppery heat from the spice came first with each bite, followed by the savory flavors every pad thai dish has.

So, I had ordered dinner to go and the lady who helped me was extremely helpful and friendly. Their pad Thai is awesome, and chicken wings is super yummy and crispy too!

The only down side to this soup is the amount of lemongrass stems still in the soup. They are totally inedible so you really have to work your way around them but other then that it's a great soup. 

The servings here are closer to a tapas style size so try and order some dishes that you could share among the table. We normally order the soup along with a beef and broccoli and a a spicy chicken dish for two and we finish off most everything, we like food!  The Beef and broccoli is a little greasy but it has delicious flavor. The coconut soup takes the cake though. Get it.",WnheFaHC4RyDNTf6scisyg,0,0,4,XGVGze9h4G-oUUQryETwYg

Foods that I've had and liked: 
Beef Pad See Ew 
Orange Chicken 
Kung Pao Chicken 
Thai Coffee 
Fried Rice 

Only thing I had and wasn't a fan of was the chicken panang curry. The sauce was watery, and the chicken was tiny strips that have a weird texture and there just wasn't much of it. It was mostly just water sauce and rice. It wasn't horrible, but I want order that again.",jkdMtyXTD0o78FzPBZzrxg,0,0,4,4dk_Jzo8jQXiKAnUWsirpQ

This was my husband and son's first Thai experience. They both really enjoyed the food. We ordered Chicken Pad See Eu, Bbq pork wonton soup, and fried chicken over fried rice. Everything was great. The fried chicken was a sweeter version of chicken katsu. It was delicious. I do have to say that the restaurant serves soda from the can. It's weird. I'm assuming refills aren't free.

And another thing, when I called at 9:39 PM to pick up some food to go, knowing they closed at 10, but apparently I can't, because they're already closed the kitchen... so yeah alls I'm saying is that if it wasn't because of the food and the location so close to my home, I'd never come back.

5786921,2016-10-26,1,hgeXEGD9lRX4ohj7afSJnw,"I'm so disappointed with this place. My finance and I decided to grab some Thai food tonight. So of course I search Yelp and Noodle House 4 was on the list. I've been to the one on Fort Apache numerous times and I've never had an issue or a complaint. Well this one really ruined it for all the Noodle House spots. 

So my fiancé orders the jungle curry with no meat just veggies. The waitress asked him how spicy from 1-10 and he specifically said 2. I even made fun of him for choosing a 2. He does not do well with spicy food. I order the Pad Thai and ask for a level 4. I love spicy food but tonight I was going to take it easy and just do a 4. 

Our food arrives and guess what?? My Fiancés Jungle Curry tasted like a 10. He started coughing from just breathing in the broth. So of course I had to test it out because what's spicy to him is not to me. He wasn't kidding...I mean his meal was even way too spicy for me. It was inedible. How is it that his food was way more spicy than mine and I ordered a 4?!? I call for the waitress and I explained, she then sends over this guy so then I explain to him. He looked over at me and asked me if I eat spicy food. I replied ""yes, I eat spicy food""! I told him I ordered a level 4 in spice and my food isn't even  close to how spicy his is. The point is my fiancé ordered a 2 out of a 10 and his meal was over a 10. 

The waitress said he is going to bring some of the broth to take down the spice. Umm okay. How about you replace his inedible meal? We are not asking for a refund just food we can actually enjoy. So instead he brought hot water or some kind of broth and sugar?? No joke. See photos attached. How can you even think that's okay as a business owner?? This restaurant isn't going to make it. I'm sorry to say but you're competing with thousands of  amazing Thai restaurants in Vegas that would never treat a customer this way. Be kind to your customers and they will be kind to you. I wish I could say good luck but I don't think that will help.",FEJP5TWedLvux5d3GfyYng,3,0,1,TdjOeXbBh_T9Qe9TVWlMdA

Mongolian beef is very salty. Beef is not tender, and you can't taste anything but the soy sauce.
Roasted duck, the broth is on the sweet side. Feeling impressed at the first sips, but got tired of the way too sweet taste and can't drink more. 
Wonton is big but juicy and flavorful. 
The highlight of the whole meal is the shrimp rolls which are perfectly deep fried, thin crispy wrap and a fresh shrimp inside!",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,1,1,3,cxCN0M3vREHWawKDlJ1wxQ

The restaurant is cute. Very modern and spacious. So far I have tried the shrimp and avocado panang and the crispy pork and basil dishes. The panang was perfect. Creamy, the perfect texture and flavor. The servings or rice were really generous. We first thought we were sharing the one they brought us and then were surprised when they brought us another plate. The pork with basil was amazing too. Spicy and great flavor. The veggies were crunchy and perfectly cooked.
