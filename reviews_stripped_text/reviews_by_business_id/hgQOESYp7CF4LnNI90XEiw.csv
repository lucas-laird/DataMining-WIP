153415,2015-11-07,0,hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw,"I've been to the one in the SLS twice, the first time was incredible. I ordered a gluten free pie, the girl asked me if I was celiac, I said yes and she proceeded to clean all the surfaces, change her gloves and prepare my pie. She notified the baker that the next pizza was celiac and both of them insured me that the oven would be wiped down as well... I ordered a Margherita base with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was divine.

The second time, this evening I went down to order the same thing, before I packed for my trip home in the morning. I asked for the gluten free crust, I instantly knew that it wasn't going to be the same. The first guy nodded at my request and started preparing my crust, not once asking if I was celiac at this point even at the risk of intestinal distress I wanted to see how far they'd go before any consideration was taken with the possibility of cross contamination.

He did not change his gloves, then passed it on to the next girl who also did not change gloves and looked utterly annoyed with her life in general and didn't add the drizzle of olive oil that's supposed to be on the marg base. She passed the pizza on to the baker who fiddled with the crust (same gloves). Then put the guy behind me's pizza in first... Slid it across the bottom then put mine in right in front. Then she fiddled with it constantly and still managed to burn the crust to ash. She missed a cut, so i had two double-size slices that were awkward to eat. 

The service the first time was amazing, the second time was the worst. Despite cross-contamination I still ate it (I was starving) with the aid of Gluten Cutter and still not an optimum solution. I could have mentioned I was celiac on my own, but I was blown away by the complete disregard for potentially debilitating food allergies I couldn't bring myself to do it like looking away from a train wreck. 

Thanks 800 Degrees for assuming that everyone ordering a gluten free pizza is doing it because it's the latest fad, rather than something medically necessary.",VKcjimcyWql77Jjh4P8MPg,1,0,2,BN-fZBUthAcu6DdC0LcxEA

I was most impressed with how quickly the pizza cooked. This place prepares all of its pizzas in an 800 degree brick oven, hence the name 800 Degrees! Cue aha moment! 

My only criticism is that the crust is very very thin and made it challenging to keep all the toppings on top of the pizza. Next time I visit I am going to have the mozzarella melted on top of the toppings in hopes of keeping them in place on the crust.

It's ""soggy"" in the middle, the toppings are applied sparingly, and each pizza is about the size of a Frisbee- ON PURPOSE. You will likely need to use a fork to consume your pie. Go ahead and Google ""NEAPOLITAN pizza"" if you don't believe me, I'll wait.

Now that you know what to expect, you can disregard all of the reviews posted by those who didn't. The walk-up ordering counter leaves something to be desired in terms of service. Their featured pies should be better, considering they're featured. Don't waste time on the salads or ""small bites"", but take note of the burrata options: beet, artichoke/olive, tomato/pesto, and prosciutto/melon. Unexpectedly well executed.

Unless you want a Margherita pizza, most other styles here will not have sauce- I personally prefer the Verde style with pesto, add mushrooms and/or truffle cheese and/or prosciutto if you like. If you're feeling especially adventurous, try the BLT, with bacon jam, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. It's a very confusing party for your mouth.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,2,3,5oLDQL2telx8EBPr-xEpqg

Once I got there I decided why eat something like seafood in the middle of the desert when I live in the most amazing State and area there is for seafood. So the hunt was on for something tasty and inexpensive.
I like the concept of this restaurant. It's almost cafeteria like or Panda Express'ish. It turned out to be a little expensive for my taste as it was a dollar fifty for a small handful of a topping & I'm talking mushroom & onion a dollar fifty each. The salad that I chose is a chopped salad with chunks of meat: salami, pepperoni, ham & such, along with a little cheese & chopped peppercinis and a really good oregano vinaigrette. All in all it was a nice meal the total came to $29 and that included a small pizza the one chopped salad which was enough for two people & 1 soda that cost $4.00!

2150590,2014-11-03,0,hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw,"The Skinny: fall apart pies with soggy middles and really odd tasting Caesar salad(2) service: counter service...make sure they give you a ticket after you order your pizza and salad. They missed our salad so we had to wait to get it. (2), value: although the ingredients are good, the crust just doesn't hold up. Throw in a horrible Caesar, I'd pass on this place. (2)

FYI- they serve Pepsi products here in a sleek, small digital soda machine.

This joint tries to make thin crust Settobello-type pizza in a counter service environment. You line up at the pizza making line, design your masterpiece or choose a specialty pie, order your salad/appetizers. After that, they print you a ticket which you give to the register. At the register, you order your drinks and wait for your order to be fired. They call your number when the pizza is ready. 

They have water cups, small plates, utensils, napkins and small boxes for leftovers on a side counter where you help yourself.

This is the type of pizza that doesn't hold up well so be aware and eat it at the restaurant and do not get it to go.

The hubs wanted to create his own pizza and I warned him not to go overboard with ingredients. Like 2 toppings is probably the maximum you want to get. He insisted on the marinara (all sauce with garlic and oregano) with ricotta, sausage and mushroom. As the pizza maker loaded the pizza with 2 large scoops of sauce, this was a disaster in the making. The pizza was horribly soggy in the middle while the garlic was not evenly distributed in the pizza so you ended up with mouthful of garlic. The sausage and mushrooms were bland too. Textural violation number 1 of the night.

Okay, shame on us for making a bad pizza. 

But for the Tartufo, I expected them to make a quality product as it is their specialty pie. Again, terribly soggy pizza, greasy as hell from the excess amount of olive oil - literally dripping down my hand as I am trying to eat it. There are too much toppings for such a thin crust and it totally does not hold up. Ugh! Textural violation number 2 of the night. Flavorwise, this one was okay but nothing special. The truffle was a bit understated while eating the pizza.

There are 2 problems because the pizzas were fired correctly (anymore, the crust would be burnt). Either the crust is the issue or it is too much toppings. My vote goes to the amount of toppings because the edge of the crust was fine.

The Caesar was horrible. Probably the worst Caesar I've had in a long time. There was a very weird fruity aroma that permeated throughout the salad. I think maybe it is the type of cheese they used. Or maybe some other elements from another salad got mixed in. Whatever it was, it was very off putting. I didn't taste any garlic or anchovies in the dressing at all. The red leaf lettuce they threw in became limp quickly from the acidity of the dressing and having too much dressing. Textural violation number 3 -it's a hat trick!

End of the story, I am glad we got to try it as a half priced local deal. Full price I would have been mad. Skip this joint. You can get better quality pizza and salad elsewhere for a better value. (2 starred review)",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,0,2,IFYSDxtAM2junRan6ZmoOg

If I'd been feeling more experimental, I'd have tried the Verde base which is pesto sauce with mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano , but I went for the traditional margherita base with crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, olive oil and basil.  (There is also a white base and a no-cheese marinara base.)  From there, you select your toppings, and there are plenty to choose from.  I went with salami (they were out of soppressata *wail*) and peppadews (yum!)  The pizza cooks in seconds because of the thinness of the crust, and it came out hot and delicious!  It was a great portion size - about 10 inches, and I inhaled it.  It was just what I needed.

Prices are fair, considering location ($8.95-$9.95) for your pie, with each additional topping running extra($1.00-$1.50). 

We each grabbed a Neapolitan pizza with one additional topping each. I opted for the chicken, while my friend chose the Italian sausage. The service was adequate, but certainly nothing special. I encountered 3 employees here and did not see a single smile. 

Going through the line was fairly quick, but the cashier was a bit slow. I guess they serve alcoholic beverages as well, but we just chose to grab a couple of fountain drinks. When we got our pies we were handed a receipt that indicated $24 in charges. I can live with that, I'm thinking. At the register, I added 2, 20 ounce sodas. The new total was $33! Holy crap! $4.50 for a fucking soda?!? Seriously, I get that I am in a casino on the strip. I get it. But almost $5 for a 20 ounce soda is excessive even for that!

The pies were actually good. The chicken on my pie was tasty and I really enjoyed it. My friend was equally satisfied with his meal.

If i didn't get raped on the sodas, this would have been a 4 star review. But, in all honesty, I am one and done with this place. I like to enjoy a soda with my pizza and that price is a straight up joke.

Not only that, a big pet peeve of mine is when I tip and receive no acknowledgement. Even after getting violated on the sodas, I still left a few bucks for the employees(after all, they don't set the prices, right?). No ""thanks"", no anything. I don't expect you to kiss my ass, but sheesh...say something. I work for tips and every time someone leaves me something I always make it a point to say ""thank you, I appreciate that"". I guess they must be rolling in it over there.

Anyways, I was less than impressed and won't be back. Too bad, the pies were actually good for the price, but all that other mess assures I won't be back.

This time around, I came because my friends and I were looking for food before our race and because we got 10% off for running the Rock and Roll Half Marathon.  The restaurant is located to the left if you are coming in through the front doors.  The place was pretty empty but then again we came around 2pm on a Sunday.  i saw the words arugula and truffle and immediately knew I wanted the Tartufo.  I asked for half roasted garlic and half minced garlic.  The pizza was decent.  Nothing too special. I liked the garlic flavor with the whole cloves of garlic but it was still pretty plain.  The other pie we got was the Zucca because I saw the words butternut squash.  Unfortunately, they ran out of squash so the server allowed us to substitute corn.  Not a one for one substitution but it was pretty good.  The pizza was sweet and savory with the corn and bacon.  I say it was better than the Tartufo because of the combination of flavors.

The place is good for a quick meal but nothing too impressive.  The pizzas are also pretty expensive when you think of the other fast food, build your own pizza places that are off the strip. Also, you have to pay for extra toppings.  800 Degrees is more high class than the other pizza shops but I don't the $1.50 per additional topping justifies the cost.

The seating is far more cafeteria style than the LA locations, and I could see how things could get a bit tight if there's a crowd. It's also totally open to the gambling floor, which depending on who you are can be a good or a bad thing.

3516994,2017-04-07,41,hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw,"Located inside SLS, 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria is putting out a legitimate Neapolitan pie. They often have a pizza of the day that's half off the regular price and promote it on their social media accounts. I noticed they were having a promotion where locals with ID got 50% off their whole bill, so hubby and I got in on that action. When I let the cashier know about the promotion and showed my ID, she accepted it with no problem and was courteous. The pizzas are baked for 60 seconds in an 800 degree oven. I did find the pizzas here comparable with those served at Settebello as far as taste, texture and overall expertise in knowing how to make a true Neapolitan pizza. If 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria had an off Strip location like Settebello, they too could have a large local following. A lot of us don't want to mess with going to the Strip, so while I loved my pizza, I can't see regularly stopping by here given the location. 

Fountain Drinks ($4.00) - What a rip! I know a lot of places mark up the beverages, but come on, $4 each is totally ridiculous! 2 fountain drinks shouldn't cost as much as one pizza. Should I ever come back again I'll just stop at a corner store first and grab a fountain drink which is something hubby and I do often since we are getting the food either to-go, or we eat it in the food court of a casino, so it's not odd to see people with different beverages. 

Margherita Pizza ($9.95) - Crushed tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Basil and Olive Oil. These are personal size pizzas. I really liked the flavor of the crushed tomatoes and the crust was on point being soft and chewy with the right amount of blistering around the edge of the crust. Definitely a worthy margherita. 

Sausage and Peppers Pizza ($14.95) - Italian Sausage, Peppadews and caramelized onions. This one might seem pricey, but with the quality of ingredients used it's priced just right. The toppings had good flavors and all complimented each other well.  

Gluten-Free Crust is available for an extra $1.50 and imported mozzarella can be substituted if your wallet feels like paying an extra $6. You can choose from the ""Chef's Favorites"" part of the menu like I did, or customize your own pizza.

4049853,2015-02-01,1,hgQOESYp7CF4LnNI90XEiw,"I tried another location of this restaurant and loved it.  Unfortunately this location needs work.  I went there on a crowded weekend at about 10pm.  The environment was horrible.  There is no separation between the casino and the restaurant.  On a Saturday night there are clubbers all lined up surrounding the place making getting in or out almost impossible.  I suppose if that's your thing then go for it, but I came here to just eat.  The volume level in the entire place made it almost impossible to order or eat.  So I yelled that I wanted a Margarita base with some toppings.   I was really surprised that they charged $1.50 each for each of the six toppings we chose.   The toppings were good, but really sparse.  When you do the math, the pizza cost $7.65 plus another $9 for toppings.  Incredible.  None of this was noted on the menu wall nor was it mentioned to us.  There was no communication from the employees at all.    They need a walls.   There is no wall at all in the front.  On the side there is a low wall, but it was surrounded by dozens of people standing around talking loudly waiting to get into some club.  There is a great deal of smoke visible outside even in the dim lighting.

We also ordered a Caesar salad.  Next we paid and went to get our drinks and a table.  While we were getting drinks they were over there yelling our number over and over again.  Now I understand that due to the volume level there is a need to yell, but there was simply not enough time to sit before they were yelling for us to come get our food.  When I finally put my drink down and came back to get the pizza there was nobody there.  I was really disappointed that they did not do like their Santa Monica location and give people a number for the table and bring the food out.   Service really was horrible, too.  Nobody came to our table to ask us anything except if they could remove an empty plate.  Which was disappointing because I had issues with the food.  The salad was really plain with almost no flavor or dressing.  Just a little shredded cheese and a few croutons.  No tomatoes or anything else.  I've had better salads at fast food restaurants.   I looked around the place and there were no condiments anywhere.  No vinegar and oil.  No Parmesan cheese.  No peppers.  No salt.  No pepper. This food needed something.

Now on to the whole reason you go do a pizza restaurant.  The Pizza.  It had good crust around the edges, but it was incredibly soggy everywhere else.  Our pizza had more than the average amount of toppings.  You need to allow for this when cooking.  The toppings were almost raw and the dough did not cook.  I want to give this place one more chance.   Next time I will try it for lunch and hopefully they will improve.   I want to like this.    

If I had to sum this place up in two words they would be Loud and Soggy.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,0,0,2,BqVl4waU9zgTZ1puLbbEng

Saw a review stating they were too thin in the middle and my husband and I both agree about that opinion. We both chose the margherita base, minus the basil for my hubby, he needn't have bothered as mine had all of 2 leaves. Where the dough was thicker it was really good, however the middle is so soggy I gave up after 3 slices. My hubby ate a couple of mine but the crust was so burnt that's really all I tasted. It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place. At $36 for our whole  meal, 2 pies, a soda, tap water and a glass of tap wine it's not a bad deal. Just really wanted my lunch to taste better.

There is a lot you can do wrong with pizza toppings, so I usually choose on of the menu, when going to a new pizza place. They usually know what tehy are doing.

Starting simple, I decided on a Pepperoni on a crispy crust.. which wasn't the best idea.

The crispy crust was pretty soft on the first look. Lifting the first piece half of the slice bend down and the topings fell onto my plate. There was nothing crispy about this pizza at all.

At the end there were more topping leftovers on my plate than in my stomach. The pizza was overall wet and soggy. Probably due to too much tomato-sauce and fat from the mozzarella and salami.",BESxyg1_yyqGf9fu9Nah0A,2,0,2,8EyMy3A9HbkTV6OzpaMIoQ

Nope. It was very gross.

My friend had a pre-assorted mushroom truffle pizza.  And although truffle oil is not my favorite, her and other of my friends who like truffle, rave about it.  

I made my own, with the Bianca white base (I requested no garlic as I don't care for it).  The Bianca is olive oil, mozzarella, oregano and garlic normally.  Then I added, a raw egg, grilled chicken and fresh basil.  OMG it was out of this world!  Cooked perfectly with my egg just right with a little runny yolk to dip in, but no runny whites.  The crust was perfect blend of slightly crispy but soft, not burnt. 

I've eaten at Novacento several times and this 800 Degrees crust is 1000 times better.  its more fluffy and light and easy to bite.  The toppings also seemed fresher and lighter and they have more base sauce options.  

We shared the small $5.00 Gorgonzola salad.  Its quite large for a $5 salad and the butter lettuce and toppings of cranberries, feta, and walnuts were great.  The dressing was light and fresh and one of the best I've had.  

There was easily accessible nice glass plates and real silverware (not plastic), and pre-made to go boxes for left overs.  They thought of everything, for a quick, affordable nice experience.

My only tiny complaint is,  clean the empty tables faster so you don't have to select an open table based on what is clean,   and level the table feet on any tables that are wobbly.

When we were done, the pizza chef made a point to confirm if we were happy and everything tasted good.

Service was confusing, not in a bad way, in a ""everything looks and sounds like I want to cram all of it in my mouth right now"" way.  Too bad they have the entire fixins laid out in front of you which propelled me to add sausage to the quattro formaggi.  That much cheese...this kid needs some meat to make the magic work and I anticipated saltiness which some sweet sausage might help balance but more on that to come!

We ordered 2 apps and 3 pizzas.  The first to arrive were the Quattro Formaggi and the Zucca.  The Zucca was the one my dining partner heard about and it was ""a must.""  It looked gorgeous and I decided to nosh that one first.  Well played and well ordered.  Fresh mozz, butternut squash, caramelized onion, bacon...SCORE!!!  If I remember correctly neither of us even knew there was bacon on it, but if you say bacon I put on facepaint and a loin cloth and dance around an open fire gratefully praying to pagan gods.  True story.  No it's not, but close.  

The flavors were fantastic.  FAN-TASTIC.  So much so I completely ignored the fact it was fairly oily, and incredibly limp.  Limp as in pick it up and it droops down like grandpas brown polyester pants.  My grandpa doesn't wear those but I heard yours does!  Heeey-oooh!  All said and done this pie was tops, disregarding my very recent nitpicking and douchebaggery.

Next I put on my water wings and dove into the quattro formaggi WITH sausage.  If salt had a fist I just got punched by it.  I am not down, by any means, with this consistent socially acceptable wave of,""Salt, salt, salt, salt"" BUT.....this was saltiness from mucho cheese and I mucho like mucho cheese.  If it was the plain pie as is, I'm not sure if I would've enjoyed it as much.  We had the sausage which helped plenty, but, I think, to send it over the top, possibly some pepperoni and/or chili flakes to add some heat or pepper to counteract that wonderful cheese and make a harmonious balance of divinity would've been the best choice. As the previous pie, oily and limp.  But taste made up for it.

The meatballs and the Margherita came out.  Meatballs....maaaaaaan...the meatballs came out in a little silver whatchamadoodle, like straight out of the oven.  Gorgeous bright red marinara (the sauce, btw, killer) and the tops of the balls were burnt, not brown, but black, and that black....ooooh boy, I'm telling you.  Sent dem balls to the stratosphere...as in the sky, not the hotel/casino.  Meatballs are outrageous and a must order.  MUST ORDER!!!  The Margherita had enormous bits of tomato.  Multi colored and quartered.  This one, also, unfortunately, limp and soggy, but like the others, flavor stood out more.

And now the sad part of our story.  I made the mistake of trying the burrata last.  After I ate enough to lose some interest in food.  In this was a great folly.  The burrata was something I would've enjoyed leaps and bounds more if I ate it first as I was supposed to.  Luckily, I'm still alive and can do things properly on my next go.  

I loved the hotel and this is a great place for grab n go dinner or lunch.  Texture fails but taste dons body armor with shield and sword and wins out.  Definitely on the cheaper side as well.  3.5 to a 4.  Can't argue with the place.",KjkfZKzbybO6QfxNZDfWag,5,6,4,hnMWjekxFAu29Arut84hww

Let's just start by saying, I'm from Chicago, so I'm not easily impressed when it comes to other pizzerias when I'm away from home...but I digress. I ran into four women, varies ages, but strolling together through the casino, carrying individual pizza boxes from 800. I stopped one of the ladies to ask her about the pizza and she went into a hallelujah chorus about it...and the other three joined the choir. I didn't know them, but based on their enthusiasm alone, I decided to give it a try. The ordering process was easy enough. There are pre-selected topping choices, or you can create you own. You start with the crust, select a sauce, proteins and topping/fixings. I ordered the sausage and caramelized onion pizza. They restaurant has a wood-fired brick oven, so the waiting time was less than 10 mins tops. When I got to my room, my mouth was watering with anticipation, so I opened the box and dove right in. I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but this was the most tasteless, seasonless pizza I had ever eaten. Although my pie contained fresh mozzarella, it wasn't melted uniformly. The sausage was ok, but did not adhere to the cheese, so most of the meat just rolled right off. The crust...and this is how I judge all pizzas..was disappointing.  Although it wasn't thin to my personal liking, it was thin enough, but soggy, perhaps due to the thin sauce. This experience really disappointed me, not only because I was really hungry, but I felt this property should be able to offer award-winning Neapolitan-style pizza.

Then you can tell them if u want one of their specialty pizzas on the menu, or you can start with the base of a Margherita, which includes sauce, mozzarella, olive oil and basil, and then you can add any other toppings you want, and just like subway, they are laid out so you can see them. And it's a lot of topping choices.

The dough is really thin and the workers let you know you shouldn't add more than 3 toppings or put extra sauce because it will get very soggy. They do have a crispy crust if you wanted to pile high on your toppings which cost $1.50 each. Anyway, I love the white pizza! It doesn't have the red sauce so it's really not soggy. If I get the margherita pizza, I ask for very light sauce. The toppings here are great, the spicy salami is the best.

Located in the SLS, with a second local found outside The Monte Carlo at the other end of The Strip, it was largely an effect of travel and an ever expanding local 'to-do' list that had prevented me from visiting 800 Degrees until Saturday but armed with a $30 off $60 coupon provided by The Code for my birthday it was with a friend I sat down within the languishing casino, our 6:30 arrival seeing more than half the table games without a dealer and nearby restaurants Katsuya and Cleo less than 1/8 full.

Conceptualized by Adam Fleischman, the man behind Umami Burger and a growing empire of restaurants rolling out in the Golden State as well as parts East, the heart of 800 Degrees is the wood burning oven and capable of turning out a Neapolitan Pie in less than two minutes with any number of artisan toppings for under $15 it was only after careful deliberation that our selections were made, the $60 tab proving far tougher to target with just two diners than one would imagine but three pies and two sides achieving the goal with a glass of wine and iced tea to boot.

Exemplifying the 'quick casual' counterside ordering concept overtaking much of America's mid-range dining culture these days, but left to collect items from the cashier when a number is called out, it was perhaps an unfortunate aspect of the size of our order and a few parties following us that the pacing of our meal was marred by having to stand up from the table thrice to gather the goods, but once everything was finally obtained one would be hard pressed to find fault in the quality of any of the cuisine served - a first bite of creamy burrata and beets tinged in balsamic speaking of high quality sourcing soon to be found in each of the oven-singed plates.

Obviously focused on the pizzas, but happy to partake in charred balls of meat slightly smaller than a Titleist or Ping, suffice it to say that the four tender orbs were amongst the city's best for the price and with plenty of brightly acidic sauce left-over for dipping of crust it was onward to the Margherita DOC that our tasting progressed, each cherry tomato bursting with flavor beneath a bit of salt while milky mozzarella bubbled atop the smoky, pliable crust.

Said by some to be too 'wet,' but in reality a near-textbook rendition of the traditional Neapolitan pie, it was next in two 'Bianca' style discs that we sank our teeth and topping the Quattro Formaggi with a bit of crumbled sausage the smoke and savory composition sang, a similar bit of praise to be levied on the oft-praised 'Zucca' that matched tender butternut squash to briny bacon with caramelized onions and topnotes or rosemary tickling the palate in each and every bite.

No more expensive than Settebello, despite its Las Vegas Boulevard locale, and featuring far better ingredients than most 'artisan' pizzerias located throughout the 702 those looking for a top quality Neapolitan pie at a fair price would be well advised to check out 800 Degrees - one of those rare 'chains' doing things right, a rarity to say the least.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,11,4,VJU7XjTFZDf2v5g_xtL34Q

A lot of people were ordering a pizza for each person in their party, but one pizza was more than enough for two of us girls.  (It's comparable to a personal size pizza at Grimaldi's, which is smaller than a small.)  The Caesar salad was good too and the small was enough for the both of us.  They've got gelato too but you can pass on the gelato.  What does it take to get some good dessert at SLS? :p

For those who have never been here before, the ordering system is like that of Subway.  You stand in line and place your pizza order, and as you walk down, before you pay at the register, you can place an order for salad/appetizers.  For those with a sweet tooth there is a separate counter/register where you can order gelato.  There is a drinks/condiments/silverware area, and you pick you seat, and leave your plates for the workers to bus.  Be prepared for the food line to move slowly and the pizza to take a little bit of time to cook.  While you're waiting, look up at the ceiling - you'll see some interesting scenes :)  

I wasn't planning on eating here, but the rainy weather prompted us to stay and eat at the hotel.  I'm glad we ended up at 800 Degrees - the food turned out to be delicious!",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,1,0,4,twDhr_oop04k6lvr_mAjDQ

You can order one of their specialty pies or custom make your own by choosing your crust, base, and then toppings. They then assemble the pizza in front of you and fire it in the wood burning oven. We ordered the spicy meatball ($12.15): beef meatballs, ricotta, jalapenos, and calabrian chiles; and the gorgonzola salad ($8.00): buttered lettuce, candied walnuts, and dried cranberries. We love this kind of salad because of the nice balance of flavors. If you like spicy, the spicy meatball is for you. It had great combinations with calabrians forcing me to break a little sweat.

The service was very good as they run out the food to your table and they'll bring any plates or silverware that you need. They have plenty of toppings and I'll probably choose to build my pizza on the next visit.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,1,0,4,FzR8eV7VfgUe4mBlOu0Bww

The portions are decent but I have been able to finish an entire pizza myself because of the thin nature of the pizza.  The salads are made fresh as well as the pizzas which makes me coming back to this spot over and over.  Open late till 2 am I believe makes it a great late night spot to dine with friends or solo for a quick bite.

They were both amazing but I kinda liked the pesto one a little more. 

The concept is very unique. You go down the line and chose your ""base"" which is the sauce. Then you can choose from their specialty menus which has toppings pre-selected of you can just pick your own. The open up a ball of dough right in front of you, and they dont use pre-shredded mozzarella. They use fresh mozzarella balls and tear it up and put it on the pizza right then and there. It takes some time to bake of course but its really good pizza and hits the spot!!! You can easlly get a pizza for less than 10 bucks.

It is amazing! We loved it!
When you walk in most the time there is a line but it goes pretty fast!
You tell the guy what kind of dough you want and then the toppings.... move a long the way and once you have ordered everything they will charge you, almost by the time your done paying the pizza is almost done!
I am serious we no sooner paid and got our drink went to find a table they were calling our number!
The flavors depend on what you want to put on the pizza. I did the fresh Mozzarella and fresh mushrooms and I think he had Fresh Mozzerella, pineapple and jalapenos on his.
They were both very flavorful and cooked just right,
I know he keeps asking when we will go there again cause he is craving their pizza.
I have to say I am not big on pizza and this one was VERY good. I mean it really was so fresh tasting.
I would say we will for sure go back! No doubt!!

The concept is simple. It is a thin pizza served with any type of topping you desire.

We decided on the sausage & peppers pizza, Italian sausage, peppadews, carmelized onions. $12.15

My friend had eaten here previously and mentioned the only thing is that the pizza is often soft and not as cooked towards the center.

My friend was correct, the pizza was much more crispy towards the crust and a bit limp and soggy in the center. The pizza was good however, I feel they skimped out on the sauce, cheese and toppings. I am sure you can asked for extra or double for an extra charge but why should I have to?

I tasted mostly sauce and dough in most bites, the cheese was skimpy.

Anyhow, it was cool, I tried it and may visit on a 50% off locals Sunday night. I also enjoy that the SLS has one selected restaurant each Sunday that is 50% off for local diners.

My first time here I was hungry for just a slice or two of pizza and ordered the margarita pizza thinking the menu price was per slice. To much of my pleasant surprise it was for a whole individual personal pie!! I love how you get to choose a great array of top ingredients such as truffles. I'm a huge fan of truffles. Whenever I come here (average 3 times a week now) I always order the pizza with truffle oil truffle salt and truffle cheese. The aroma from the oil when added to the food just brings out the flavors. One choice i always get is their truffle cheese bread. A huge portion big enough to satisfy a foodie like me who loves leaving a restaurant full and happy. The staff here from the pizza makers to cashiers and managers have all been very friendly and accommodating especially once they've gotten to know me and see me come by many times. Plus one of the girl pizza makers is hot and cute . It was also very nice of Kenny (I believe he was a manager) to have bought me a pistachio gelato, thanks Kenny. This place is so good I encouraged all my local and visiting friends to come try out their food and the response from them were all positive all of them said they enjoyed it so much they came back for another 2 or more times. One friend of mine who I kept insisting they try their food kept hesitating so I bought her several pizzas and a truffle cheese bread for her and she is now a regular like me. That's how much I believe in their menu items that I was more than happy and willing to just pay for it all. Now on a separate note I was there last night and tried the side of meatballs with my main order and was a bit disappointed in that selection. Felt that it was not worth the $7 for a few tiny bites but no worries I just won't order it again the pros of their food makes me still come here regularly.
