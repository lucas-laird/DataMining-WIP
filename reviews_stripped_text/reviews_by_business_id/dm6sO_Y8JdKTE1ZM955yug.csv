It was portioned as an appetizer and was lacking for a $20+ entree.   Still one of the greatest in town but it cost them a star in my book.",yctYv9E1rK6AYTx1FHU3gw,1,0,4,HFaypnseIQO-ZaTWkzKuXg

Compared to other Thai restaurants the flavors veer much toward sour and tangy much to my delight. Even the spice level was heat but much more than one note. The sweet and oily tastes that are normally very prevalent were more undertones. Usually I finish a plate of Thai food and there is greasy sauce on the plate. I love it when there is not.

My favorite - the lettuce wraps so flavorful with a tamarind sauce. The crab was overwhelmed but the other flavors made up for it. The rib eye salad was good with a lot of fish sauce as long as you like that. The stir fried pork was ground pork and I thought it would be pieces but good although surprising that it wasn't accompanied by rice or something - very spicy. I would definitely return. The sides were fresh and everything was presented with care.",voXU5A3FfOcXZ2VNsJ0q4w,0,0,4,RpOHm8fordKFbLeAVnf1wQ

I like the prices more at Chada and food is just as good. My recommendations include pad kra pow with pork belly, fresh oysters, and panang duck.  It is very comparable to the Thai in SF, NY, and Los Angeles ( which I think has the best thai in the country).  I didn't get to try their coconut with mango dessert because it wasn't in season.

165840,2012-12-01,2,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"It was with great anticipation that we watched and waited for this place to open. We attended on opening night and noticed food critic, John Curtas, in the house. We were simultaneously intrigued by the tapas style concept yet apprehensive as well. In our experience, ""tapas"" often translates to expensive small portions. Unfortunately, the reality left much to be desired. Long story short, Chada Thai = overpriced small portions of mediocre food combined with subpar service. For our party of 3, we ordered about 10 dishes plus two $1 bowls of rice which cost us $80+ before tax/tip and we still left hungry. At most other Thai places, you could pay half that amount, leave stuffed silly, and it would taste better too. The ""highlight"" of the evening was how they handled the raw potato in the Massaman curry. When we brought it to the attention of the manager/owner(?), he asked if the chicken was cooked enough. When we replied yes, he just walked away and ignored the issue. There was no offer of redoing the dish, taking it off the bill, or offering any sort of discount. At the very LEAST, they should've offered to give us a properly cooked potato! Especially during these economic times, you need to offer customers value for their dollar: good food and decent portions at a reasonable price. This place offers neither and combines it with crappy service to boot. I don't see Chada Thai lasting very long unless it makes some dramatic changes to address its deficiencies.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,3,3,2,xk1pUtqB66GwUlJKke37rg

Good atmosphere, delicious food, and great service. This is the place you want to go if you want a slightly nicer Thai food experience. Food is going to be in the $25/plate range, but everything melts in your mouth. 

They are well known for their crispy duck and, if you try it, you'll know why. It is perfectly tender on the inside, deliciously crunchy on the outside. Seasoned just right, it is a dish definitely worth trying if you like duck. I usually get the drunken noodles with the crispy duck.

195290,2016-03-31,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"Wow, I've been here once before, but I was really impressed this time. Here are the standouts:
Larb - I know it's basically just ground pork, but the spices they use in this raise it to another level. Sweet, sour, and spicy.
Pad See Eiw - Definitely the best I've had. I didn't know Pad See Eiw could be so good.
Moo Hong - Pork belly that's soft, moist and melts in your mouth. The only complaint is that I wish the portion size was bigger on this one.
Duck Panang - Yelpers had this one right. The crispiness of the duck is the best part.

The other dishes we had, green curry, Pad Hed (mushrooms and brussel sprouts), and Yum Nua (beef salad), were all good too. The only dish I didn't like was the Kang Kua Kaduk Moo (braised pork ribs in some kind of turmeric spicy sauce)...I wasn't digging the sauce and the spiciness was kinda too much for me.

Cherish the moments in which you get service, because they are short on staff. Here's a mnemonic device to help you remember, at Chada service is nada. Short, kitschy and easily digestible, unlike their dehydrate fish chunks.

There are books near the entrance, but that is a ruse, because the sub-literate narcissists who haunt this establishment are for want of all that is cerebral, and choose to be mind-numbingly facile in their enjoyment of life and its pulchritude. Translation, the scourge of humanity dines here: yuppies, vulture capitalists, Daddy Warbucks' parasitic Hilton-esque daughters, foodies and just about anything who would make Peter Singer, were he dead, rollover in his grave.

I'm excited to see how Chef Bank's new place, Chada Street, turns out.

After 3 visits in 2 months with groups, this is one of those places where just about everything is excellent. It's fine to go alone or for 2, but IMHO it's pretty ideal if you want to eat family style, and that way of course you get to sample more of the delicious food.

They also keep their recipes fairly simple.  I've enjoyed most dishes from Chada, clean, clear, good combination of flavors.  Not much to complain for the price, minus chicken wings appetizer being overcooked and with too much sauce for my taste once, everything else is well executed .  I love the simplicity of their desserts, like the sticky rice with mango but I wish they also offered something more elaborated.  Chada has become one of my to go places in the area, in the same mall as another favorite China Mama.  I would definitively recommend to give it a try.",Vda6MY-EPTF9CFlSx8-R9A,0,0,4,du6B7Rwf0ffCtkrcutELXw

992638,2015-03-05,1,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"Folks have been singing the praises of Chada Thai & Wine for two years strong, it seems to be quite the hit with Chefs and gourmands alike. I was happy when friends suggested we meet there for dinner. Pulling into the strip mall, you wouldn't expect anything special beyond Chada's door, but you're in for quite a surprise. The decor is sexy with dark woods, crimson accents, dim lighting and a wall of wines. The list of Rieslings go on for days, ""Chada Thai & Riesling"" could very well be appropriate. You'd expected nothing less from Bank Atcharawan at the helm, who gained fame as former sommelier at Lotus of Siam. 

Don't sweat it if you're not a fan of Riesling, there are whites, reds, beers, and sake to choose from. The menu specializes in Southern Thai cuisine, with a focus on seafood. It's a little overwhelming at first, but our group settled on Pad Hed, mushrooms with brussels sprouts ($8), Spicy Herb Fresh Roll ($8), Por Pia Tod, vegetable egg roll ($6), Pou Nim Ma Karm, crispy soft shell crab with tamarind ($19), Shrimp Pad See Eiw ($10), Chicken Pad Kee Mao ($8), and Chicken Pad Thai ($8). 

We thought we'd try a mix of unique dishes and standard Thai fare. The seafood dishes were better than those with chicken. The brussels sprouts were a bit soggy - I like crunch! and I anticipated bold flavor, but it didn't deliver. The fresh roll, on the other hand was bursting with zing from the ginger. The shame of it, was that it was so potent it overshadowed the other ingredients. The vegetable roll was crispy and on point. Overall, I was disenchanted with our choices. The sum of the parts didn't tally up to a memorable meal. Perhaps, I should have been more adventurous or maybe we caught them on an off night. Service was quite sluggish too. When competition is as fierce as it is in Chinatown it's hard to forgive these shortcomings.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,3,3,R1wMFzyWVzJKICTzs6wPXg

On to Chada- the space is not just updated, but far more refined than Lotus. It's not by any stretch capacious, but it is comfortable. That being said, the reason this place doesn't get five stars from me is strictly due to the lack of a bar/ counter space.

The food is easily on-par, if not above, it's protege's. If you love the food at Lotus, you're going to love the food at Chada, possibly even more. Service is more attentive,and the atmosphere is updated and comfortable- no lunch buffet steam-tables or faux-patio lattice work indoors.

Bangk has a passion that translates to guest experience- the alchemical golden equation of the restaurant business and experience.

Sautéed pork with raw garlic and Chinese broccoli (waiter recommendation that was on point!)
Grilled prawns and eggplant (Would not be anything to write home about except for the cilantro dipping sauce which our group started eating by itself over rice it was so good!)

1409475,2012-11-02,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"New place opened in the same plaza as Q Karaoke, Icy Juicy, and HK Star. Apparently it is opened by the Sommelier from Lotus of Siam. 

We went kind of late (10:30PM on a Thursday evening). There were two other groups there. The restaurant was designed nicely with a nice atmosphere. Left wall is designed with framed wine labels. Far end of the restaurant (coming into restaurant) is the wine rack. 

The restaurant was designed contemporary style with white dinnerware (square plates, ""oddly"" shaped bowls, etc) 

We were seated and served with water. The water was in a container with no ice. Not sure how to describe the container but its something you sometimes see in a korean place for the flavored soju. It has like a plastic ""cork"" like cap and a metal thing that u pull away and lift up to take off the cap. XD 

We had ordered 3 things. 

- Miang Pou (Lettuce wrap w/ crab meat, ginger, roasted coconut, peanuts, lime, and onion) 
- Tom Kah Kai (Coconut soup with mushroom - chicken)
- Kai Tod (Fried half cornish hen w/ garlic) 

with a bowl of rice on the side ($1 extra - not included)

Starting off with the Miang Pou (lettuce wrap). (refer to picture for presentation and reference). The wraps (5) were oriented around the plate like a star with a shot glass in the middle filled with the sauce. Each ""portion"" had a little of each ingredient on a baby leaf of romaine-like lettuce. A note that was not listed in the ingredient list above, each portion has a small thai chili piece in it (if u cant eat spicy, dont eat it). The sauce that was included was a little too? citrusy/sour, (probably from the lime), and probably contained a sauce made with peanuts, lime, and onions. For some odd reason, there was something bitter in the wrap, but i couldn't pinpoint what it may have been. 

Next would the the Tom Kah Kai. It was served in a large bowl. Not like some other thai restaurants, where it is served on a sterno heated pot. This soup, was also a little citrusy/sour. It was flavorful but both me and my friend would prefer it to be more rich (more coconut milk) vs the sourness. Decent amount of ingredients. Still delicious when eating alone or with rice !

Last but not least, the Kai Tod. This was actually the most delicious dish out of the 3. It was nicely fried. The breading was light and crispy. Not thick. The meat of the hen was juicy and flavorful. As i was eating the piece of hen, i noticed how the seasoning was actually inserted in between the meats and around. Maybe a little heavy on the black pepper but it was still good. (i like black pepper anyway) . There was approx 6-7 decent sized pieces. Wish they put more fried garlic (i love garlic !) 

Overall it was an ok experience. The lettuce wrap kind of seemed a little expensive for how much you get. Was a little saddened by how the soup was like. 
Wished the menu was a little bigger but the food wasn't bad. Service was decent. Price was ok. Little more expensive than the average thai restaurant.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,1,3,qwZJfyCojAnJ9cvab1FXpg

The wait staff seems completely incompetent.  Perhaps some blame could be shared in the back but there is no excuse for the drop in quality of service and to a lesser extent the food.

Last night we ordered soup for the table. After about 15 minutes the waitress came over and asked if we wanted to order the mains. We said sure. They then brought out bowls for the soup but no soup. Waiting another 15 minutes we flagged down the server and inquired about the soup. She said it was coming. 

The soup appears and we take our first bites when (you guessed it) our mains came out. When I pointed out that we had just gotten the soup she had a deer in the headlights look and tried to pull the entrees off of the table. We told her to leave it. After eating the soup and the mains the same server comes out with the appetizer salad that had been ordered and hour earlier and evidently forgotten.

While brings the same memory as the first time at Lotus, the food and vibe is completely different.  Casual, but demurely hip, if you KWIM.

With its clean lines and simple color palate of grey and red, Chada reminds me of simple modern start up restaurants in NYC...that is a nice look.  While not very big, the place seat about 40 people comfortably. 

As of this point, Chada does not have a liquor license so no alcohol served.  We did take advantage of their courtesy BYOB with no corkage fee!  However, I look forward to their wine selection in the future, though. 

The menu style is all small plates, but the portions are equivalent of atleast 1.5 main dish servings. I hope that doesn't change,  because the dish prices range are extremely affordable ranging from $6-18; most dishes averaging in $8-12.  Some of the fish and beef dishes are in the higher price ranges, but well worth it.

My husband got the spring rolls, which was $6 for 4 rolls...pretty reasonable.  We got 4 oysters in chili sauce and mint for $8, the crispy pork belly with sauteed greens (choy something) for $10?,  Seabass Tod Krueng was phenomenal...extremely tasty, unique generous portion even at $18, and sauteed ribeye in fish sauce.  While execution was still a bit ""slow"" it made for a nice relaxing meal while we sipped on our favorite wines.  Every dish was prepared beautifully.  I can't wait to come back and try all the other dishes too.

A few things.  You can tell the establishment is new, servers are still learning the menu, but they were polite. The menu lack organization, but that can be a good thing, because it makes you look through the entire menu. Once ordered, dishes came out one by one with a bit of lag time in between, but again, it really gave each dish time to be enjoyed.  I can't wait to go back; it better be soon, because I know Chada's popularity is going to skyrocket to the height it deserves.

The quality of food is absolutely fantastic! My favorite is PAD KRA-POW, YUM WOON SEN SEAFOOD and home made beef jerky. They are all amazing and I can eat this everyday.

I should have listened to my instinct that told me to run when I entered a restaurant full of white people in the middle of Chinatown. I stayed though because I trusted the Yelp reviews.

We were asked if we had reservations which we didn't, but we were seated anyways. The restaurant wasn't at all full. I understand that it's necessary to have empty tables sometimes so that the kitchen can keep up with the tickets and people won't be waiting too long. However, I found it puzzling that the host was turning away people when there were only four other occupied tables.

Chada has a good wine selection though not as voluminous as LOS. We were very happy with our riesling, and the pricing was good.

We got two starters, the vegetarian green papaya salad, and the beef jerky. My husband thought the jerky was weird, and he didn't even finish the salad which is saying something because he has a huge appetite.

We got red curry, his with duck and mine with tofu. I thought the tofu was prepared well, but the curry itself was no better than what I can get at my neighborhood place. My husband's duck tasted fine (not too chewy) but the skin wasn't crisp like the duck curry at LOS.

1849225,2016-01-27,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"This was almost 5 stars for me.  I'm vacationing in Las Vegas for my birthday.  Everywhere we have eaten on the strip has been overpriced and mediocre so we decided to eat somewhere that was not on the strip.  The food at this place was amazingly good and the prices were fair.  I got green curry with pork and I cannot explain to you how good it was.  The pork was moist and crispy at the same time, just perfection.  The sauce was yummy.  I ordered sticky rice to go with my curry and it was yummy too.  My husband got panang curry with hanger steak which was also good.  My best friend got some kind of lobster dish which was also good.  (We all taste each other's food). The restaurant has a long wine list, some wines on the list are quite expensive.  I got a glass of Syrah for $7, nothing expensive.  I feel overall that I loved the food at this place and I would to eat there all the time but I can't give this restaurant a full 5 stars because of these reasons:

1. When we got there our waitress told us all our portion sizes would be small and rice does not come with the dish and we have to buy the rice separately.  Usually rice does come with food so I wondered if the small portions and extra rice charge was just a cash grab thing.  It was kind of off putting.  However in the end I feel my portion size was fine and the price was fine overall as well.  It would be nice if rice were included though.

2. My wine was not chilled.  It was hot and I didn't like that.

3. My waitress questioned my tip and I felt that was a little rude.  My waitress was polite enough but she didn't do anything exceptional.  If I have a waiter or waitress that wows me I tip more.  I have tipped people a $20 before for being awesome.  I tipped this lady a $5.  My husband and I were eating with our best friends who are another married couple.  At first they brought us the check with all four orders combined.  We asked if it could be separated into two checks, one for each couple.  Instead she separated it into 4 checks.  So my husband told her, hey just pay these 2 checks with the same card then.  Then he wrote in one tip.  She also made us write a tip before she even ran our card because she said it had to be done that way due to the fact that the credit card has a chip in it.  Then she came back after she saw the $5 tip my husband wrote down and said, ""this is it?  For both checks?""  That was beyond rude.  I suppose she thought if she made 4 checks she would get 4 tips.  She literally asked us about a tip about 5 times before she finally ran our card.

Based on those three things I can't give this place five stars.  If you go to this restaurant be ready to enjoy some good food.  But just know your wine will be hot and they will pressure you to tip them more than they deserve.",ATrXGiyjKIovKj6UApVFEw,0,0,4,GKhF-8hB8HnxCXxjfjoccA
1870740,2016-03-31,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"My girlfriend and I discovered this place late one night and it is one of our favorite spots in Vegas now! 

We try and get something new every time, which is kind of scary because the food from each previous visit is so good that we are afraid the new item isn't going to be as delicious...but nope. Everything on the menu is amazing!

The panang duck is incredible and if you want to save some money, you can get chicken or steak instead of duck and it's super cheap. Like $9!  

The Moo Hong (Black Pepper Pork Belly) is one of our favorites!

The larb is much better than Lotus of Siam, in my opinion.

The drunken noodles and pad Thai are excellent too!

Everything is really really good and the prices are shockingly cheap compared to other Thai restaurants we've been to.

Then there's the service. It was always good before, but after introducing myself to Chloe and Gap after the third visit, they've been even more friendly and amazing. Before, the service was 10/10, but now that I know the staff, I feel like family every time I walk in!  Service is STUPENDOUS now!  3,892/10!  Is that a realistic score?

It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot in a busy Chinatown plaza, with great décor touches like a giant red chandelier and a wall-size wine rack. Start off with a glass of the Riesling or the Textbook Cab, $8 and $9 respectively. 

PAD HED: One of my favorite apps. Simple but great stir fry of Brussels sprouts and mushroom with lotus root chips, with a touch of oyster sauce. You'll want the whole portion for yourself. 
SOM THUM: Classic papaya salad with an excellent lime-tamarind dressing. Presentation was nice but the whole large wedges of cabbage were problematic as we were only provided spoons and forks. Splurge the $4 more to add shrimp. 
GREEN CURRY: So creamy! Love the crispy grilled pork. Lots of textures in here, rice is a separate side order for a buck or two. Very fresh and sophisticated.
SPICY DUCK RICE: Giant portion of rice but minimal duck (couldn't have been more than 2-3 ounces). Nice spicy, building heat to the dish. Again, nicely but inconveniently plated with large, thick slices of cucumber that we could barely cut into with our provided forks. Maybe that's supposed to discourage me from eating the garnish.

Beautiful setting definitely makes this a good date-night pick. Service was polite and professional on our most recent visit. I suggest reservations, as we had a poor experience trying to drop in one night. They were half empty but the host had an attitude about us walking in casually dressed.

In fact, on my last trip to Vegas, I Lyfted from the strip to this location no less than 3 evenings for dinner.  Chada's attentive service staff have always been spot on as my water glass never ran dry.  My all time favorites dishes are:  
1) Nua Dad Diew an in-house beef jerky. If you like jerky, this is for you to try.   
2) Miang Pou - this dish is a star. It is served on carefully prepared lettuce  leaves, coconut, peanuts, crab, ... WOW.. I could have 2 of these and be in nirvana! 
3) Spicy Spring Roll - This is a good take on fresh spring rolls. I love the spicy components. 
4) Coconut and Sweet Rice - round out a meal

As for the wine selections at Chada, I am not a wine SME.  My preference are whites and mostly Eiswein or desert wines.  What I can report from this visit is what I heard from a table nearby. They were quite ""impressed"" with Chada's wine selections and by the end of the meal, they had finished 2 or 3 bottles.  

Before other posters rib me on, ""... What about the other 3 or so other very good Thai restaurants in Vegas?""  Yes, I've eaten at most all of these and I shuffle between them.  Yes, you cannot go wrong at those or at Chada if you are in mood for Thai.  Reservations are always recommended, especially on weekends and it's an easy Lyft from the strip.

One of the best pad kee mao I've ever had, though my spice-sensitive partner might disagree. We ordered medium and it was SPICY but I loved it. Also nice tofu with it.

The mushroom/brussels sprouts dish was nice but kind of bland, and the same goes for the fried mushrooms, which really need a dipping sauce (comes with nothing).

Service friendly but pretty hands off. 

I would definitely come back for the nice Thai dishes that aren't found on too many menus as well as the traditional dishes. Really appreciated the less sweet and more authentic tastes.

Even more, I appreciated the lack of televisions! It was quiet and undistracting. We had come to District One originally but fled when we saw the sports-bar-like TVs everywhere. The calm and quiet Chada won our business.

Insider tip: TOTALLY FULL parking lot, even in the off-season. Maybe the back of the horrible strip mall has parking? We grabbed the last open spot.

Complaint: They give you styrofoam for your leftovers. It's as if all of Las Vegas is trying to drown the world in styrofoam. More restaurants should set better examples and be more green. I think they brought straws with water too.",NMGpx_BYBwx9Z7SyI3Wd4A,1,0,4,gwzKbG_FNe6t7F8q-jUbAg

My hubby was scouring online for all the new restaurants that were going to hit Las Vegas and hit on Chada Thai - a tapas style Thai food joint. Opened by a former employee of Lotus of Siam, this place was on his immediate ""need to go"" list. So we went on opening day and I believe we were one of their first customers in the restaurant.  (FYI - John Curtas just edged in before us.).

Now let me get this straight - I'm a little leery when someone tells me it's a ""tapas"" place. Because my brain translates this to - ""we're going to give you 50% less food  but only reduce the price by 20% so you can 'share' and try more things."" It's a FOS total cash grab marketing scheme of which Chada Thai is no exception. We ordered approximately 10 items for 3 people (including two $1 bowls of  rice which they charged extra for) which ended up being about $82.16 pre-tip and left the restaurant hungry. Yeah - we left f&(king hungry and s&*ting gold f&*king bricks afterwards.

We ordered two vegetable dishes - a grilled eggplant dish and a stir-fried mushroom dish. The grilled eggplant ($8) consisted on half of an eggplant marinated in kind of a green papaya salad type dressing. The flavor combination was nice however the grilled eggplant was a little bit tough texturally. The stir-fried mushrooms ($8) consistent of 2-3 different mushrooms with a sliver of lotus root and 1 brussel sprout mixed in. You heard me -1 brussel sprout. There was too little wok hai to the dish and hence the dish was swimming in too much liquid. The flavor was alright but nothing special.

The braised pork belly ($8) had a nice melt in your mouth texture and good flavor. However there were only 5 small slices of meat to go around.

The kai tod (garlic fried chicken) was good ($10) and one of the surprisingly more reasonably priced items on the menu. They actually gave you a large portion of the cornish game hen. The meat itself was tender while the outside was crispy and well seasoned.

Pad see ew ($6) was one of their better dishes of the night - good flavor with some good crisping of the rice noodles. Their pad thai ($7) though was one of the worst dishes. It was a little unusual for the rice noodle dish to be completely encased in a omelet but we went with it. The omelet was a little bit tough from the overcooked egg while the noodles were completely bland. Not recommended.

We also ordered the steamed sea bass with the plum sauce ($18) which I found to be a little too sweet for my tastes. I would not order this again.

Massaman curry ($9) had a nice flavor however was devoid of any real amount of vegetables or meat in the stew. Literally 2 chicken drumsticks, half of a raw small potato and perhaps half an onion.

Oh and about that raw potato -- so we informed the manager/owner? that the potato in the dish was raw. His response - ""but the chicken is cooked, right?"". ""Yes."" And that was it. He did not offer to correct the problem or even acknowledged that it was an issue at all as long as the chicken was cooked.  He didn't even offer an apology for incorrectly cooked food. That is poor customer service and speaks to the inexperience of the staff that work there.

Although I appreciate that we went on opening night, I have to say for really hit or miss quality Thai food (I would perhaps get maybe 3 out of the 8 items we ordered again) at over the top pricing for the small portions I would probably not return. However with the added poor service response, I would recommend avoiding this place like the f&*king bubonic plague. 2 starred review.

At the time we went, they didn't have a liquor license but they allowed BYOB without charging corkage fees. Woop de doo.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,6,2,NyFlKlVZpqFsr7hPsaa9Sw

2309509,2012-11-22,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"We had a party of three arrive at 10:30 PM on a Saturday night.  We ordered soup and two appetizers and told the waitress we were still looking at entrees and requested the aforementioned order to be placed.  We decided on three entrees and ordered at the server's next pass.  The soup arrived first and this version of Tom Kah Kai was overpowering in citrus.  If the soup had been hot it might have been passable, but the soup was certainly prepared fresh and hot, but then plated in a cold bowl and then portioned in individual cold bowls for our party of three.  By the time we took the first spoonful, the soup was merely warm.  As we were eating the soup the two appetizers arrived.  Shortly after, while still eating the soup and prior to a single bite of appetizers, all three entrees arrived.  As the three dishes were being placed on the table I asked if they usually serve all the food at the same time.  The server laughed and smiled and I said it really wasn't funny as I had ordered in courses and now all the food would be cold by the time I was able to eat it.  He asked what I wanted him to do and I told him to do whatever he wanted.  He took two of the three entrees away and said he would have them prepared after we finished the soup and appetizers.  Not sure why only two of three but I told him to do whatever he wanted.

When the entrees arrived for a second time, they were served on stone cold plates along with the rice, which is extra, served in a cold bowl with no covering.  So despite the efforts to bring the food when we were actually ready to eat it, this restaurant showed how poorly food can be presented and amateur hour at its best.
I will say that two of the items ordered, the oyster appetizer and the curry crab entrée, were exceptional for taste and quality.  The fact that all the hot items were so poorly presented, and initially presented all at once, really shows what little this management knows about proper service.  This was my one and only trip to Chada and I will drive a few extra minutes to eat at Lotus where they know how to run a restaurant.  At Chada prices, it is somewhat offensive to be charged extra for white rice and for hot tea.",zXFyGQuMZ6zVaj4yP92vQQ,3,2,2,UPI0dZaD5na8jcz0pzcBAA

Staff: They're awesome! We're regulars and T always treats us like family. He remembers what we drink and what we eat. In the event we stray away from our norm, his recommendations are always on point and in line with what we're into! 

Food: If you're into Thai, Chada takes the crown. Comparing it to other spots locally like Lotus and Natayas, Chada is above and beyond. Better tasting / quality food and nearly unbeatable prices. Their somewhat traditional Thai menu can please just about anyone. I recommend the Spicy Mushroom / Lemongrass soup (pronounced Tom Kah?), Drunken Noodles, and the Mango Sticky Rice (If it's available). 

Drinks: An awesome wine list, by the bottle or by the glass. My girl loves the Banshee Pinot by the glass! Beer list is small but has my favorite beer of all time. Very good Thai Tea as well.

Hands down it is the best looking Thai restaurant in all of Vegas, they did a fantastic job with the inside.  It has a dark, wine bar feel to it.  Red glass chandelier hanging from the top, wine covering the back wall, and another wall filled w/ framed pictures.  You will be pleasantly surprised when you walk in.

Rib eye salad appetizer is money!!  (For all of you who do not understand the urban slang ""money"" it means 'of unusually high quality, very good.'  For example, Kobe Bryant is money).  The whole menu actually has rib eye options if you don't want their regular beef chicken, pork or shrimp.  Bless their hearts for not putting fatty rib eye either, I gotta give them that, it's money!!

The server recommended their grilled pork dish.  Also a money dish, big pieces of sliced grilled pork over a bed of Chinese broccoli.  Not a saucy dish by any means, very simple, but very satisfying.

Last recommendation was the crab curry.  It is served with three spirals of rice noodles.  Also a money dish, the crab is not over powered by the curry.  You definitely get the essence of the crab if that is your thing.  It doesn't have that strong flavor that you are used to in other curries like panang for instance.  It's a light dish, I would share it with friends, I wouldn't make it your main entree.

The least money dish was the drunken noodles.  Typical, sweet noodley dish you can get anywhere.  I would instead try the three dishes I mentioned earlier.

Perfect example of a restaurant having a decent rating and not a lot of reviews but still being excellent (or I should say money).

The pad-see-ew tofu (vegan, no egg, no fish sauce) was seriously the best I've had in *YEARS*. Like, damn. It doesn't get better.

The pad thai (vegan, no fish sauce, no added veggies- that seemed weird to us) is not at all spicy, but was quite good nonetheless.

The fresh spring rolls (tofu) were unlike ANY other fresh roll I've had to date. Try them! They had some kind of very lightly pickled veg mix inside, which sounds gross, but they were really quite good. Very unique, but a nice change of pace.

The phone order went really smoothly, my order was done in 10-15min, and they had an understanding of their veganizing abilities, which is always a plus. I would love to go back on a date, as it really is a cute place with ambiance & the wine options are tempting.

The service is very professional, and the wine selection is very extensive.  I came here for lunch with a couple of friends and ordered the Tom Kha Khi ($8), Pad Kee Mao ($8), Sen Mee Kang Pou ($12), and Moo Hong ($8), all ordered hot. 

Overall the food was good.  I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao (with pork) the most.  It had a really dry, herbal flavor to it.  The pork was moist and well prepared, and the veggies were plentiful and spot on.  The balance in flavor was well done while staying interesting with intense herbal flavor.  The Moo Hong (pork belly in a soy sauce) was good too, although it tasted kind of like a Japanese dish.  The pork was tender, perhaps slightly dry, but fatty and flavorful.  

I had mixed feelings about the See Mee kang Pou (crab curry on fermented rice noodles), and the Tom Kha Khi.  Both dishes used a peanut sauce to add sweetness, and I just am not used to that, especially in a Tom Kha.  Still, the flavors were nice and popping, although perhaps not super well balanced.  I could have done without the peanut sauce in either dish.  

This rating was a tough one for me.  I enjoyed the food well enough, and the wine selection was impressive.  However, the portions are definitely small.  The curry was served in a small bowl, the pork belly only had about 8 small bites.  The Pad Kee Mao didn't have a lot of noodles (a lot more veggies).  Although the Pad Kee Mao was a really fantastic dish, the others were around a 3-3.5 for me.  Combined with the low value of the smaller portions, I have to end up at about a 3/5.

I've taken a few friends and my mom here and they are now loyal addicts of this place.  We usually order the crispy beef (wonderfully tangy flavor...originally the wait staff's recommendation when we asked what was popular...and now frequently order it).  One thing to note though about the crispy beef, if you have wheat/gluten sensitivity like I do, this dish might make you bloated or hurt your stomach.  I think the coating might have some flour in it.  Some days I decide to take the discomfort for the amazing dish....if I were on a first date, probably not.  Around my boyfriend, I don't care.  All else, I've never had any reaction to.  In the past, have ordered the onion/mint/lime/fish sauce-flavored  pork larb, green curry, mussamun curry (which is their closest to ""yellow curry""...Mussamun being closer to a Persian version, or at least that's what the name means), Pad Kee Mao and appetizer Miang Puo.  I can't think of a dish that has disappointed.  A lot of times, there will be maybe one dish that is ""okay"" but this place takes trophies for all the dishes we've had so far.  It's impressive.

I watch my budget so don't eat here as frequently as I wish I could because of the price....but nonetheless, it's been satisfying in terms of excellent cuisine and service.  Me and my guests have never ordered wine so unable to review that portion.

Deep fried prawns with sauce vs Lotus of Siam Garlic Prawns.   I think Chada is better priced but the Lotus of Siam (LoS) Prawns taste better.  The sauce at Chada is good but it takes away from the flavor of the prawns.

For a party of six, 7 dishes was barely enough, we could probably have gone with 9 dishes.  I would double up on any dishes that you like.  We got 2 prawn dishes but 5 single dishes.  The dishes are really small here so you can't go for seconds in a large party.

I probably would have eaten & been out without any issue of taking a table needed for another party. But the hostess chose to lose a very probable regular customer. Who would have generally been a party of 2 or 4.  The owner may have super business now, but as is well known in the restaurant industry, repeat clientele will dictate your survival.

I suppose that shouldn't be a problem for me.

As others have mentioned the sommelier from Lotus of Siam opened this place, so many people expect this place to be similar to LOS. It's not. It also doesn't have to be. But it should be good and reasonable. The flavors were good.

I ordered the

Lettuce Wrap: 5 small pieces of lettuce with crab, crispy garlic, a Thai bird chili slice and some sauce in the middle, delicious yet not filling. Referring back to location, I think it's safe to say that it affected my thinking because anywhere else in Chinatown where I would order lettuce wraps, one lettuce wrap would have been equivalent to the five little ones combined. However, that said, I would say that lettuce wrap was enjoyable.

I also tried the 

Pork Belly: 5 slices of almost-tender belly, balanced in fat and lean meat, but lacking in melt-in-your-mouth texture and smoothness. The dish was well-seasoned.

I was surprised (unpleasantly) by the

Massaman Curry: 2 chicken drumsticks, two pieces of onion, and 2 pieces of potato with only enough curry to dress the morsels of food. There was no rice included. I have never had curry served without rice. Curry is meant to be eaten with some carbs. I ordered a side of white rice. I recommend that the staff should put the rice in a small bowl then cup that bowl of rice into the bowl they are serving it in, so the rice looks presentable and appetizing. The way the rice was served shows lack of experience.

Maybe all they need is time and a couple of reviews to help them out. There are many great places for Thai food. I don't know if I will be back considering their price to reason ratio.

I, the old curmudgeon who wants to enjoy dinner at least 24"" from the next person's body, was thrilled to have the server place us exactly midpoint between others in bench seating and she took away the place settings of the four person table where we sat. The tables were placed an appropriate distance apart.

I like privacy and space and so this was great for me. Married to a guy who wants to join everyone else's conversation it is difficult to find respect for space.

Well we knew we already liked the food last time. This time it was great! My husband loved the spicy crab curry and a pad thai. I thought the pad thai was one of the best ever. I ordered the grilled tilapia with spicy garlic and mint sauce. Sauce is to die for! One of the owners offered to filet my fish which made it much easier. We gulped down shrimp satays and shrimp cakes for appetizers.

The wine list is good but you can only get certain kinds by the glass. I wanted a Schneider riesling wine but accepted a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. He had 2 Singha beers. We spent about $82 without the tip.

When dining here, we usually order a bunch of different dishes and try them all.  They also change their spiciness based on the diners' request.  I love spicy and Chada does not disappoint in that department.  Their Pad Thai is exceptional and all other dishes are very good as well.

3517691,2014-03-07,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"Great for date nights, or just hanging out with friends, Chada Thai has become one of my favorite spots in town. The space is cozy and intimate, with lighting that's dim but still bright enough so you can see your food and music that provides enough ambient noise to entertain without forcing you to raise your voice to carry a conversation.

If you're a fan of Brussels sprouts, the Pad Hed ($8) is a must try. The silky smooth quality of the sauce had hints of sweetness that enhanced the savoriness of the mushrooms, lotus root and Brussels sprouts.

A challenger for best dish at Chada Thai (at least from the ones I've tried) is the Moo Hong ($8). Tender cubes of pork were covered in a thick, subtley sweet and acidic sauce. I have no idea how they develop these flavors, but they're unlike anything I've had in town.

Wanting more heat, we tried the Nua nam tok ($12) -- charbroiled rib eye with rice powder, onion, cilantro, chili powder, fish sauce, and lime juice. Even ordering it as a mildly spicy dish it still produced a good bit of heat. The kind of heat that lingered in my mouth and lips and made my nose run.

On the more mild side, the Mussamun curry ($9) impressed with its depth and complexity. The pork in the Kana moo krob ($9) was reminiscent of the dish Lechon with it's crispy and crackly exterior, while the drunken noodles, chicken, and sauce in the Pad kee mao ($9) was perfectly balanced.

With dishes that will please those that love heat and those wanting a milder experience of Thai food, Chada delivers the best of both worlds in a spot perfect for locals and worth the drive as a dining destination for tourists.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,2,5,1AYdWB9vP4yx-LKQF87CMg

They have impressive wine collections offering wine at reasonable prices with hardly a mark-up.

The menu focuses on food from Southern Thailand (including Bangkok). The prices are very reasonable, with most appetizers, soups, and curries hovering in the $8 - $23.

For appetizers, try
Spicy Herbs Spring Roll New: lettuce wrapped with ground pork with ginger, onion, lemongrass, and thai basil. It was flavorful and seemed healthy.

Yum Kai Nok Kata: a flavorful appetizer of fried quail eggs topped with dried shrimp, cilantro, and red onion tossed in a spicy lime dressing. Yummy!

For entree, try

Chuchee Cripsy Prawn: Deep fried Prawn served with chu-chee curry was divine. It was hot, juicy and full of flavor. Really enjoyed them.

Yum Woon Sen Seafood: Bean thread stir fry with tomato, onion, cilantro, chili, lime juice, and fish sauce. Also delish.

It is located on Desert Inn and Jones in an older shopping center, but the interior is very quaint with modern feel.

It was amazing. The pork has a nice citrus leaf marinade and the grilling gives it a nice caramelized flavor. The curry sauce was perfect and the dish was well balanced, like all Thai should be. It was not overly sweet, like most Americanized Thai tends to be. I also had the shrimp satay appetizer and still walked out of the restaurant under $25.

One thing however, surprised me. They charge you a buck fifty for the steamed rice.  I was told by the management that they were charging for the rice so they can stay competitive with their pricing. 

I don't believe it would make much of a difference if they raised a buck fifty for the rice entrees because the crowd they attract are wine lovers to whom a dollar fifty doesn't mean a whole lot.

I took foodies from NYC and LA to dinner with me, and we all agreed that it was the best Thai we've ever had. 

The chef came from Lotus, but here he moves beyond the traditional Thai offerings ... those are there on the menu too ... to more innovative Thai dishes. The restaurant is in a strange setting for visitors to Vegas who may not be too familiar with the Chinatown neighborhood. And I was still skeptical when I parked in the strip mall parking lot. But upon entering, I found a beautiful space and very friendly hosts and servers that created the perfect atmosphere for our group meal. 

Everything we tried was phenomenal. The soup was the best I've ever had in a Thai restaurant, and it came in a large bowl for sharing. but I'll have to say that my panang curry duck was unbelievable. It consists of small chunks of duck fried in a batter then covered in delicious panang curry. All of the curry dishes were excellent. The brussel sprouts were awesome. The Pad Thai is just right.

I separate Thai food in Las Vegas into three categories: 1. Standard and solid: these are affordable go to places that always get it right and are always satisfying. 
2. Below average: these are the random Thai places that you try once thinking how can someone mess up Thai food and leave without finishing your food and don't take the left overs to go.
3. Those above average Thai places that are elite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas that everyone knows about.

My mom is Thai and I get my Thai fix at home often, but not every dish made at home is restaurant quality. When I tried the spring rolls here it didn't remind me of a Thai dish, but it tasted like the epitome of Thai food. I think we got 4 orders of this. It was the perfect bite. Crunchy and soft texture with sweet, salty, and sour flavors.

Their Tom kha gai was also really good with perfect amount of broth to coconut milk and a good balance of sweet, sour, and spicy.

I also applaud the quality seafood they use. Big tiger prawns. Even in a ""civilian"" dish like pad Thai I thought they did very well. 

Then the mango sticky rice dessert at the end was perfect.

If I ever want to eat something my family doesn't make on the regular I'll definitely be back to Chada for their delicious food. Those spring rolls are a must try.

Chada Thai & Wine is widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Some even place it above the nationally renowned Lotus of Siam. I finally got to experience the upstart restaurant today. I knew from visits to the area that it's in a large plaza on the eastern edge of Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn. Its sign is modest, so look for it in the middle of the plaza, between a karaoke place and a much more prominent District One.

Chada only offers dinner service, and the interior is appropriately dim. Despite my photos attached to this review, the colors were definitely muted by the low light. The restaurant is also relatively cozy, with not much more than forty seats available. Despite that, it wasn't crowded at all on a Wednesday night and we were seated promptly even without a reservation. I also love the alternative rock that they play in here (Muse, Imagine Dragons, Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, and others), which makes this restaurant one of my favorites anywhere music-wise.

My mom and I were far more interested in the Thai than the Wine. We didn't get any alcohol, but we shared a number of dishes.

Kai Yang ($8.00): grilled marinated Cornish hen w/ spicy fish sauce. Moist chicken, nice spices, very sour sauce. Quite delicious, especially considering that it's just a chicken dish. Go easy on the sauce.

Panang Curry ($9.00): slow-cooked hanger steak in Panang curry. Rich coconut curry that still had quite a kick when ordered ""mild"" (results may vary, but I'm pretty sensitive to spicy foods). Delicious, tender beef. What more can you ask for?

Kana Moo Krob ($9.00): Chinese broccoli w/ so-called crispy pork belly. The Chinese broccoli was nice, and the sauce was also tasty. The pork belly was certainly not crispy as advertised. It was very tough to chew and a bit too salty, as if overcooked, and the pork belly skin that should've been crispy ended up being a sticky, chewy mess, as if it had been allowed to soak up the juices for a while. I don't know what happened here, but whether it's improper execution or something else, I'm really not sold on this thing.

Pad Kra Pow w/ sliced pork ($8.00): stir-fried meat w/ chili and Thai basil. It's a relatively sweet dish but doesn't go overboard. The pork is meaty and works well, but I wouldn't mind trying a premium protein (crispy duck, rib eye) or an equally inexpensive alternative (chicken, beef, ground pork) on a different occasion. Overall, not as impressive as the Kai Yang or the Panang Curry, but certainly better than the Kana Moo Krob.

Sides of rice ($1.50) and sticky rice ($2.50) complemented the tasty courses. They're reasonable portions for the cost. The regular rice is served in a bowl. The sticky rice is wrapped in plastic and served in a basket. No issues with either.

Prices were reasonable for the portions. We probably had one extra dish's worth at the end. Service was fine. Pacing could've been improved slightly. The kitchen had almost all the dishes come out at once, and probably would have gotten them all simultaneously had I not waited a few minutes on the Pad Kra Pow order. I would've rather had two dishes to dissect at a time rather than all four, so I'll have to remember to request that next time.

Based on tonight's experiences, I'll probably return to Chada Thai & Wine and delve deeper into their menu. I'll just be sure to skip the flawed pork dish.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,7,4,XWNsG5yJknvi72Y7nSje0Q

The Good:
Food quality is excellent top of the line. Wine list is long and extensive. Service was good food came out quickly and the portion sizes were good. I also liked that after you eat your appetizer they change out your plate. Price is good, the bill came out to $103 we got 2 appetizers, 1 soup, 3 entrees, 3 sides of rice, 2 sake, and 8 beers. 

The Bad:
I highly recommend you make a reservation. The places opens at 5pm so I would try to call the day before. Place is small, tables are ideal for parties of 4. Their consideration of spicy is not what you would normally consider spicy, we asked for medium on one of our appetizers and it was the hottest thing I have ever tired in my life, usually at other Thai places medium spice in no where near that hot.

I had the duck fried rice, tom yum salmon with bok choy, and the chinese broccoli with crispy pork. I'm used to going to thai restaurants that serve food in family size portions, so the sizes of the portions here are a bit small. Luckily I only went with one other person, so three plates were enough to get us full.

For some reason, everything seemed to be a bit salty to me (it might have just been me though because we also went to mastro's the next day and I thought the food there was also salty). My boyfriend thought everything was fine. Out of the three dishes we ordered, the duck fried rice was my absolute favorite. I've found myself to crave it every so often, but have yet to find a restaurant in California that does it as well as Chada Thai. 

I was really looking forward to the chinese broccoli with crispy pork because I love all things pork and crispy, but found myself chewing on really tough pieces that were almost inedible. The tom yum salmon was a very interesting concept, but this was the plate that I found to be on the salty side.

I found Chada Thai on Eater.com's top 30 restaurants in Las Vegas, and I decided to give it a try.

 I must say that the quality of the food at Chada Thai was some of the best I've ever had. You know when you go to Asian restaurants, and you feel like they've given you the worst parts of the chicken or cow? Well, at Chada Thai, the meat and the vegetables were fresh, crisp, and simply great. Also, the prices were excellent too. $8 combination fried rice would normally cost you around $15 at other places.

On thing that I found a little bit strange was the fact that on a Tuesday night around 8:30, my friend and I were the ONLY people in the restaurant; thus, the service was excellent! I'm pretty sure that this would be a chill and great place if there were other people.

The service was great.  We had a party of 5 fairly adventurous foodies, and our server (T) helped us select dishes.  We had Panang Duck curry -- amazing.  Drunken noodles (very good, but not really special).  Really good green curry.  Another highly spiced curry (amazing).  Some amazing pork belly.  Great soup (the unique one they serve; I'm sure the classics are good too). A couple great appetizers.

It was great getting the check for 5 at the end: $110. Even with a good tip, this is less than I've spent as a single diner on the strip for a far lesser meal.

The restaurant is small, it probably seats only 40 people. Which is nice, it gives it an intimate vibe. Usually when I go to Thai places I choose a curry of some sort but decided to venture out and try something different. We started with the lettuce wraps, which are not the basic lettuce wraps you can get anywhere else. These are so good with a tamarind dipping sauce. For my entree I chose the prawns with spice lemongrass salad. My friends ordered the sea bass and the basil and lemongrass tilapia. The dish is the whole fish, and they de-bone it at the table. I tried it, it was very tasty, it had a strong lemongrass taste. I didn't try the salmon but my friend said it was very good. My prawns were excellent, excellent, excellent. I opted for a glass of Riesling to go with my meal. For dessert I ordered a scoop of coconut ice cream, which I really enjoyed since it was not too sweet and it had shaved coconut on top that gave it a crunchy texture. Everything was super fresh and tasted wonderful. The service is very, very attentive. Two different waiters attended to us and they were both very nice.

I think some people may have disliked the portion sizes. Most casual Thai places in town serve huge portions of food. The portions here are smaller, but it is fine dining after all. I left feeling happy and satisfied, but not over the top full.

Interior: Dark and intimate that resembles a sort of firefly ambiance which is appropriate since it is a thai tapa's restaurant. The wall by the kitchen is decorated with a wall of wines which adds a nice touch.

Service: Somewhat attentive although the servers can get distracted with some of the bigger tables which is understandable. Our server had good recommendations on the alcohol and especially on the dishes. I had a few leftover and the server kindly took my plate and store it in a to go box with a side of rice to accompany it and two sets of utensils (Thank you! :)

Food: Most of the dishes are in it's native name but with a description underneath. I had gotten the Kai Tod (Marinated cornish hen) which was very very dry and served with a sauce that was a bit bitter with a hint of spicy. Next was the Pad Hed (shitake and shimeji  mushroom stir fried with brussel sprouts and lotus root) which was great but tasted more like a chinese dish rather than thai but now i'm just being too critical.  Finally the duck panang which was absolutely amazing.  Now I love panang curry and who doesn't, it's creamy, sweet, and spicy but with a neatly cut duck that was perfectly cooked with fried skin now that blew me away. 

Overall: I like this place and especially that duck panang curry which is seriously the best panang i've ever. Intimate setting with plenty of alcohol to enjoy between a friend or a loved one.

By 10:15 still hadn't put in a order or talked to.

On more of a positive note. The food was prepared with perfection. The dishes are not to big and great for sharing. You can sample a lot of variety with 3-4 people. The pad hed was a memorable dish. The place is modern and clean. 

To sum it up, if you walk in and there is a large party 10+ come another night. It is worth coming back for. Unfortunately I hit it on a night with a large party and 2 servers. No busser.

Once you walk in, you are are taken with the atmosphere one would find at a luxury, trendy boutique hotel such as SLS Hotel. The red chandelier, the dim lighting, the framed wine labels, and an extensive wine list, I can imagine this restaurant in a trendy hotel such as Cosmopolitan on the strip or somewhere in NYC.

What you can expect here is a wine list curated by their owner/sommelier. As flip through the pages,  you might be overwhelmed by their selection of wine, especially Rieslings which perfectly perfectly with Thai cuisine. Their Riesling selection by the glass was the best I have ever tasted -- light, sweet which compliments the flavors of the dishes.

The plates are smaller (tapas style) than usual, so I suggest sampling many dishes to share with your table. Everything we dined on was unique and dishes I've never tried before. 

Recommended dishes:

Duck panang 
Pad Kee Mao
Sen Mee Kang Pou

We were greeted and seated moments after walking in the restaurant. The ambiance reminds me of Chada Street - quaint, inviting, and dimly lit. Quite the intimate setting.

My friend that I went with is a very proud certified Som so I let him order the bottle of wine, a Viognier. I've never tried this white wine before but it tasted like what would be if Pinot Grigio and Riesling had a child. Very crisp and refreshing, pairing nicely with the Thai dishes we ordered.

APPS:
- Peak Kai Tod (Spicy fried chicken wings)
Delicious large wings (5 pieces) drenched in a zesty spicy brown sauce. My friend wasn't impressed but I really enjoyed! I am an abnormally large fan of chicken wings though...
- Shrimp Satay (Charbroiled Shrimp Skewers)
There were 3 skewers total and the shrimp seasoning was just a tad salty. I love sodium so I didn't mind. Came with a peanut dipping sauce and a small side of cucumber salad

ENTREES:
- Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle stir fried with garlic, basil, and spices)
I added Rib Eye Steak as my protein and asked for medium spice. The portion was huge and this noodle dish was SO tasty! The heat was just right and I inhaled the whole plate
- Duck Panang
Crispy duck in Panang curry. The curry tasted on point and the duck was cooked to perfection!

I wish I remembered our server's name. He was soft spoken and a little quirky. We enjoyed his company... He was very polite and filled our wine glasses and waters frequently.

The only con was that the food took a while to come out. Granted we went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was full. Both the apps and main entrees took longer than the typical restaurant but we luckily had wine to enjoy while we waited.

The worst of them all, by far, was the Strip steak which was extremely overcooked! So overcooked, we literally couldn't swallow it. Even the accompanied sauce was atrocious. The other dish which none of us cared for was their Wings which were dry and unappetizing. But overall the meal was good.

Service:  The staff was great. They were very attentive, and made a few mistakes, they remedied immediately. I made a mistake ordering the wrong spring roll (not as big of fan of the fresh over fried...it's the country girl in me...we fry everything!  LOL! ), and they replaced with no complaint. I beefed their tip for that one! 

Facility:  It's located in the middle of a strip mall, and is a fairly small cozy spot. They have tables and chairs and some half booth seating along the walls. The decor is modern and beautiful, with their wine bottles displayed elegantly along the back wall. 

Food: The food was very good. I tasted the crab curry everyone raved about and it was delicious 5/5, but warning, the portion is fairly small, so I only took one small bite of my friend's. The guy who ordered it was very disappointed, and had to order more food. 
Fried spring rolls: 3.5/5 they were good. There were 4 rolls and some sweet and sour sauce on the side. They were crisp, but the inside lacked a little flavor. 
Pad See Ew: 4/5 This is my go-to dish to determine if I like a place. The flavor was truly delicious, but the noodles were overcooked and bordered on mushy, and there wasn't very much pork in it. But it tasted so good, which is why it has a high rating. Oh, and I ordered it extra spicy, but it was only about a 5/10 on the spicy scale for those fellow heat lovers.

You have to call to make reservation and you can't call before five because they won't answer the phone.  However it's a great place to share a meal with your friends as we found out. It has a very extensive wine list so we started with a bottle of white wine. I would generally drink red but the friend I was dining with always drinks white so I'm game. We each picked an appetizer and we shared those.  After that we decided to each pick an entrée and share that also. The food is so good you could just keep eating and eating. They didn't seem to mind that we ordered our dinner in stages and they didn't seem to mind that we lingered over our wine even though as the night wore on it got busier and louder. I can't agree that it's better than the Thai place near the green  door (still an absolute favorite of mine) but it is really excellent Thai food and I agree that if you don't like Thai food you should go anyway--it's that good!!!,m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,0,1,4,_Vg0dMf4oFUhfIBjBC6Lgw

The bottles are on an artfully pleasing wall display, but not temperature controlled.  We needed to chill our wine in an ice bucket to bring it to a proper quaffable temperature.  Chada - please invest in a good wine refrigeration system!

I got the Beef Panang Curry and it was amazing! Very tender beef and perfect texture for the curry base. Not too soupy and not too thick, it was just right. The spicy level I got was medium and it was just right.  
NOTE: The portions are kinda small. So you definitely sacrifice quantity for quality. 

Sister got the Pad Thai. Very good pad Thai. Worth getting.  Not the best but still very good.

I would of liked to see more of a variety of curries and fried rice selections on their menu. Portions were somewhat small and they charge you extra for rice. Last time I checked all Thai restaurants served Jasmine rice with their dishes without an extra charge. Lotus of Siam and Archie's have a larger menu and more selections for Thai cuisine.

The ambience is perfect for a first date... or any date for that matter.... dim lighting, lovely interior, and an impressive display of their wine collection.

Now if only the food could match up to the service and pleasant decor of the place. 

Fresh Oysters:  average, but still the best thing we ordered. 
Pork Belly:  unimpressive sauce and overcooked. 
Sea bass:  usually our favorite fish but here it was definitely overcooked, and there is nothing worse than overcooked fish :(
Drunken noodles with ribeye:  this dish was requested to be level 12 out of 10 spicy and it came out at just about 5 or 6. I can tell they don't use cheap ribeye, but once again, this was also overcooked. The quality of the ribeye must be decent though because it was still semi-tender when cooked well done. 

Needless to say, we usually pack any leftovers but we left ours on the table. I still have high hopes that the cooking may improve and match the restaurant's elegant ambience.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,2,2,2,zn1qs2VTVEe9RyxValaeyQ

It is a cozy place but you don't feel cramped or like you are sharing a meal with the table next to you lol. The ambiance is relaxing, comfortable, & elegant. 

The wine list is fantastic. That is kinda their thing haha. I didn't order alcohol but I can say great quality & selection. 

The menu is full of various options and you can substitute tofu and vegetables for the meat in any entree. Not your typical thai restaurant selection. They have curries, noodles, rice, soups but they put unique twists on them. They also have entrees with seafood and all meats.  The sea bass looked great. May have to try that next time. 

I tried the spicy crab curry, Tom kah Kai soup & pad kee Mao (drunken noodles) with tofu and veggies. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. The soup was the best thai soup I have had. Perfect flavor, spice and freshness. You can select the level of spice you would like as well. 

Something that put my wonderful experience over the top was our waiter. I wish I got his name. He made sure our needs were met while not being overbearing. He made great recommendations as well.

At least it gave me a chance to taste it. There wasn't much crab meat, or anything else besides rice for that matter. The chicken pad thai was pretty good but something unique from other Thai restaurants I've been to, they lay an entire egg over the top. Another issue I had is I asked for medium spice and they brought it to me much hotter than medium. Since I like spicy food it wasn't a big deal for me but I can see how it could've really been a problem for someone else. Also, I was still hungry after I left, which almost never happens after I go for Thai.

Where else can you get SERIOUSLY good food at 2:30 am? I'm not saying any greasy, drive thru option that tastes great due to the mind altering substances ingested in some way shape or form as the night wears on.

They do subtle things that end up making a big impact. Bell peppers, fresh veggies with broccoli and Chinese broccoli. The sauce is fortified and ample with a sweet soy and a mixture of other concoctions that my palate wasn't able to discern but it all worked. Flat wide noodles were buttery. I am literally salivating writing this.

I asked a friend in Vegas to bring me back some and that's how much I liked this place.

We had one evening off where we wanted to try something special in Vegas and unfortunately couldn't get seats at Raku, so decided to go for some Thai food in the Chinatown area instead.

Price: Food was reasonably portioned at most dishes will run you about 7 dollars per appetizer to 10 dollars for most entrees. Seafood items can go upwards of 20 dollars.

Food: Flavors were bold and tasted right, but food was either overly sweet or overly salty. Spiciness level was just right, but just know that medium spice will have a pretty good kick.

Som thum (Green papaya salad) - presentation on this was pretty lousy. Most classic papaya salad will have blue crab, basil, cherry tomatoes and crushed peanuts all mixed together but this was pretty hastily thrown together. You have plain shredded green papaya doused in some fish sauce, with tomatoes and a wedge of cabbage on the side. The flavors were there but the textures were not varied.

Drunken noodles - too little noodles and way too much vegetables and oil. Could barely find any wide rice noodles at the bottom and most of it was just salty stir fried veggies.

Panang curry with beef - probably the best dish of the three we had ordered since the beef was very tender hangar steak that had been braised. Nicely sweet, but again, overly salty. You'd have to order two bowls of rice in addition to this to help dilute the curry sauce.

Thai iced tea - way too sweet. Diluted this with equal parts water and it was only drinkable then.

Service: no problems here. water was refilled quickly.

Overall: flavors are there but some dishes were either too salty or too sweet, just looking for something middle of the road here. Wound up drinking a ton of water to help with the salt.

The service is excellent, some of the best I have experienced anywhere in Vegas.

The food is all across the board.

Some dishes seem like chaotic mismatched Dr. Sues food, such as the crab lettuce wraps. Way too many ingredients other than crab in these, impossible to taste the crab or even to feel it's texture. Toasted coconut, raw onions, raw ginger and peanuts completely overpower. Any crab that might be in there is lost. A lot going on but no harmony.

The spicy herb spring roll is similarly complicated, but this one actually works and is delicious. It's filled with ground pork, ginger, onion, lemongrass, mint, kaffir lime leaf and Thai basil. Serious fresh herb overload, in a good way.

Other dishes are refined and elevated Thai classics. The drunken noodles with beef is a fantastic dish. Noodles are near-perfect al dente, wok fired and drenched in a rich smoky sauce that works beautifully with the beef.

Mango and sticky rice dessert comes with delicious dairy free coconut milk ice cream, topped with traditional crispy roasted mung beans.

Portion sizes here are small, don't expect a lot of food with any of the dishes. It's like Thai tapas. A fun place to come with a group when you want to sample a variety of flavors. There's something for every palate.

Som Thum $7- unforgettable papaya salad with tomato, peanuts and spicy lime dressing. Hot as **** but soo soo yummy. If your about that spice life I recommend it.
Sen Mee Kang Pou $13- Crab curry with thin rice noodle by far my favorite dish. i recommend taking it easy on the spicy to enjoy the bold curry flavor.
Hed Tod $9- Shitake and Shimeji mushroom stir fried with Brussels sprouts. Boring but edible. 
Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) W/Lobster $23- decent flat rice noodle and generous lobster tail overpowered by basil.

 The Thai Iced Tea was good, but the mark up is crazy when I could have gotten it at home.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,4,2,3,ev7SLQhJAWEw3L0r7MxCkQ
5001618,2018-05-12,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"I would give this a 3.5 star. Nice and cozy place.  It's located in the same strip as District One. Came for dinner with dw and had a romantic ambiance. We ordered with the young lady and asked if it was too much and she said no it's good. So we got the Tom Kah Gai (chicken with coconut milk soup) and a larb (pork salad) to start. The soup was very flavorful and not too heavy.  The larb was the best out the whole meal, but was missing a bit of spice (for me). It was rather a large dish for an appetizer.  Next we ordered the crispy duck with curry was very tasty and still had a crunch when you bite it despite the curry on top.  The crab fried rice (was a few pieces of crab meat on top of a small mound of fried rice (will not get this next time). The soft shell crab consists of 2 good size crabs fried whole and then sauteed with garlic and onions. It was a bit too sweet for me and again missing some spiciness.  The yam woo sen (seafood vermicelli salad) comes with squid, mussels, shrimp,  salmon pieces mixed with vermicelli. We asked more than once if this was too much and each time the waitress said no.  Well, the portions are quite big so this would have been enough for 4 people.  Guess the waitress wanted to ring up the bill and/or think I would pack this for leftovers (I did tell her we were not from here).   Service was good throughout (the other 2 fellows kept coming to pour water, etc..)  The dishes looked good but unfortunately didn't wow me or convert me to Chada (hint use more chillis and cut down on the sweet).  I much prefer Lotus of Siam for a unforgettable experience. thanks",gIGdonekINnT2n_8lw-pAw,0,1,3,KSiGOZUm1eM96tnfyUsO1A

Here the space is much smaller, so make a reservation for bigger parties, and the menu is much more condensed. I guess it caters to different concepts. Chada street has more street food options like tapas and smaller bites. Here you just have the more traditional options with upscale ingredients like ribeye and seafood. Of course you pay an upscale price for the upgrades. 

I got the drunken noodles- pad kee mao with ground chicken. It is extremely flavorful and saucy but super super salty. I downed like 4 glasses of water trying to get through that thing. That dish was pretty bad.  It just just plain too salty.  

The pad Thai is another huge miss. It doesn't taste like pad Thai to me. The noodles looked off, the color looked off and the taste is definitely off. It doesn't have that sweet taste I'm used too. 

However, I also got to tried my friend's pad see ew which was very good. It wasn't overly salty like mine and very flavorful. The Tom yum soup was also very good. It was clean, sour, spicy, and full of hearty ingredients like mushrooms and shrimp.

5022978,2015-04-27,3,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"When we're in town, the wife and I like to get away from the Strip and experience some of the places frequented and loved by Las Vegas locals.  After doing a little research, we decided to grab dinner at Chada Thai & Wine on a Wednesday night.  We arrived a few minutes before our 7:30 reservations and were seated promptly.  I was surprised at the restaurant's very small dining room, a marked contrast to the widely-renowned and much larger Lotus of Siam.  That said, good things come in small packages and Chada Thai packed a lot of goodness in its space that equaled and, in some respects surpassed, Lotus of Siam.

We ordered the Pad Hed ($8), stir-fried Shitake and Shimeji mushrooms with Brussels sprouts and lotus root; the Duck Panang ($18), roasted duck with panang sauce and kaffir lime leaf; and lastly, the Sen Mee Kang Pou ($12), crab curry served with thin rice noodles.  We accompanied our meal with a bottle of the 2007 Ridge Monte Bello.  I love mushrooms and the Pad Hed was a delicious dish.  The Duck Panang was even better with its perfectly crispy skin and moist, tender flesh.  My favorite, though, was the Sen Mee Kang Pou.  I love Thai curry and I love spicy Thai food.  I could tell it was appropriately spicy as it made my forehead sweat just a little, but didn't overpower my palate with a spicy burn.  I've found the food in many Thai restaurants I've been to be way too salty.  Chad Thai hit the right mark with its seasoning.  All of our food items were reasonably priced and great values.  Similarly, the wine list, while certainly not the largest or most diverse in town, contained a solid selection of wines at varying price points.  Our bottle of wine was not inexpensive, but knowing what it cost retail, Chada Thai's markup was surprisingly reasonable.  Service throughout our meal was attentive.  Our only negative from our experience (and it was not the fault of the restaurant) was that being visitors to the city, we took a cab to the restaurant.  After calling several cab companies, it was impossible to get a cab to come pick us up , with all of them stating it would take 30 min. or longer (on a Wednesday night, no less).  Boy, it would've been nice to be able to use Uber.  Thanks, Las Vegas cab mafia!  We walked halfway back to the Strip up Spring Mountain before being able to flag down a cab to take us back to our hotel.

Chada Thai & Wine is definitely a local gem.  The food and wine was top notch.  I'd gladly go again the next time we're in town; however, we may have to rent a car on our next visit.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,7,4,5,Cg88406K93VH7RjwUCJsPw

Their menu was really confusing, some traditional items but the rest random and really Americanized. They didn't even have satay! Only shrimp WTF that's so weird. They had a lot of made up seafood items

We ordered the brusselsprout shiitake mushroom stir fry... It was undercooked, raw, and cold. We had to send it back it was so bad and so salty! They gave us a second plate and it was so much better... I don't know why they gave us raw cold and salty food in the first place? I feel so deceived by the ratings.

We got the beef panang which was perfect and very spicy just how I love it cause I had to request it to be spicy. And we got the shrimp pad Thai which was also good. It's so weird that all these dishes don't come spicy.... What kind of Thai restaurant is this????? Their beer is really well priced! Hoegaarden for $4 I can't complain.

It was also really bad that people who came after us got all their food so quickly and everyone around us and we haven't even had another plate come out within 15 mintes...like wow really???

5094903,2013-11-16,13,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"Not imperial Thai or even Americanized Thai.  It's Swanky Thai, keeping the traditional flavors but replacing the primary ingredients with upend versions.

It doesn't work.  A Chilean sea bass is destroyed.  It's subtle oily flavor hammered by a fiery chili paste.  Marinated Cornish hens with garlic so overpowering that only it's shape and mouth feel let you know what is.  Just the opposite, using rib steak in the drunken noodles robs the dish of the beefy flavor and  sinewy, fatty texture that a humble cut of beef would bring.  

Thankfully there are more traditional dishes that really shine.  

The Pla Tod Yum Ta Krai (fried whole tilapia with lemongrass salad, dried shrimp and cashew nuts) is excellent.  The flesh of the fish, overcooked and rubbery near the skin just as it should be.  The slight muddy flavor enhanced by the dried shrimp, perfumed by lemongrass and brightened by a lime, chili, and fish sauce drizzle.

Lo-Ba (braised then fried pig ear, tongue, and heart served with fresh cucumber and ""sauce"") sounds disgusting.  It's well worth the try.  Trust.

Too adventurous, the Moo Hong (Braised pork belly with black soy, palm sugar, and black pepper) or the Pou nim pad prik Thai (fried soft shell crab with soy, garlic, black pepper and green onion) both make for good eats.

Large wine list with useless ""bragging rights"" labels.  Good selection of Rieslings.  Inexpensive.

Efficient service.

Small plates meant to be sampled and shared.  Reasonably priced, considering.

Owned and operated by Bank Atcharawan, local king of Riesling and former sommelier at Lotus of Siam, Chada Thai and Wine had been on my 'must visit' list for some time but without a car during many previous visits to Las Vegas and largely without friends or family interested in the cuisine it was with good fortune that I finally found myself seated at a large table with five new friends on a Saturday night in early November for a two hour meal that would prove my best experience with Thai food to date.  Dark and moody, almost romantic aside from the unexpected modern pop soundtrack, and decidedly more intimate than LoS as soon as one walks through the doors it would be mere moments after seating that we were greeted by our server and told of a few daily specials the laborious process of trimming our order from ""I'll take the lot"" to something more reasonable began - the end result ten plates of food including a double order of the truly remarkable century egg, a dish certainly amongst the ten best I've enjoyed in 2013.  Served in waves as we worked through two bottles of wine including a lightly sweet Riesling that proved an ample compliment to both heat and acid it was so frequent that someone at the table would proclaim their love for a dish that to describe them all would prove redundant, a simpler suggestion as relates to my palate being to order everything you can that features an egg or bird while disregarding any preconceptions you have about 'heat,' instead preparing your palate for complexity and balance.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,5,f2ppAFNnNs6FCrBKkT3U7A

5390847,2013-04-03,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"Chada Thai & WINE.  Oh you fancy huh?   No this review was not written in 2010 as much as that opening would have you believe.   I decided to try take out from Chada for lunch yesterday as I was in the area and to be honest I rarely make it out to Chinatown for dinner, and combined with the the whole wine and fine dining-ish premise that I usually avoid, I figured it might be my only chance to indulge in the John Curtas heavily praised restaurant.  I went with my standard order of Basil and Chili Chicken lunch special (non-wine version), and entered 10 minutes later to a nearly empty dining room.

The food was ready very quickly afterwards and the guy handling the payment and handing over the food was very friendly and accommodating.  When I got back to my office and opened it, I was literally taken aback by the site.  No hyperbole, this was the best looking Thai take out meal I've ever had.  I uploaded a pic which probably doesn't do it justice, but for being in a standard white Styrofoam container, it looked about as good as it can get for me.   Plus I love that they actually give the soup to go!  That's one of my Thai food pet peeves, that so many places advertise the lunch specials coming with soup, but more often than not they don't provide for to-go as I assume they don't want to deal with the extra to-go containers or just some minor cost cutting. 

Well chada had a small container of Tom Yum (I think?) that I thought was a fairly standard version for the most part.  The mushrooms seemed to be of slightly higher quality to me than usual, though I'm not a mushroom expert by any means.   I then moved onto the egg roll which was tasty (and also had mushrooms in it which I'm not used to).   It had gotten a little soggy from being on top of the other food.   I find I prefer egg rolls to be separated when provided with a takeout order, but overall a solid fried log of goodness.  I then bravely tried the salad even though I hate salads generally, and was quite surprised.  The greens tasted fresh and best of all the dressing had a nice hint of ginger to it which seemed again like a step above what I'd normally expect.    Chada, you made me like a salad.  Respect.

Lastly I tackled what I expected to be the Pièce de résistance, the basil chicken and rice combo (note: I forgot to ask about brown rice so not sure if they offer it?).  I was so excited from the look of it all mainly due to the chicken looking like nice, freshly sliced chicken without a lot of fat hanging off of it.   Unfortunately this is not the norm for Vegas Thai restaurants that I've been to, so I was happy to see it here.  Sadly I ultimately was disappointed in this aspect of the meal.  When I called I was asked if I wanted it mild, medium, or spicy.  I said somewhere in between medium and spicy.   Well, I'd say it feel somewhere in between mild and medium, and more on the mild side.   Spice notwithstanding, the chicken just tasted bland.   Like 75% of all losing dishes on Top Chef, it could have been helped with a little salt.  I also like having a lot of sauce when I order this dish so I can soak the rice a little bit while eating.  This was almost devoid of sauce which was nice to not have to worry about spillage, but the meal suffered in flavor because of it.  The quality of each individual component was excellent.   This was almost undoubtedly the best chicken I've ever had at a Thai restaurant, but again unfortunately it lacked the flavor and spices to perfectly go with it.

I was really torn between a 3 and a 4 for Chada.  On the one hand, having a somewhat bland main course is one of the biggest sins a Thai restaurant can commit in my book, but on the other hand almost every other aspect from the rest of the components to the service was impeccable.   I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to Chada and award a 4, and I will most certainly be back to judge again.

Their lunch specials are a couple dollars more than you usually find, but I think the addition of the soup and high quality ingredients it could be worth it.  Then again maybe they're spending more on those and not as much on salt and spices.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,1,4,MoS7qFRYr0KVoycit7cvew

However I suspect that several yelp users are throwing out stars like they are candy.  The restaurant would have received a 3 stars for food just because the meal the four of us had was overall average. However the service & atmosphere bumped it up to a 4.  It's not your typical Thai decorated restaurant. However,having that said, there was no real wow factor to the decor. The other reviews had hyped this place up so much that walking in was a little let down.  It had a chandelier.  Big whoop.  The service was excellent - the food was served fairly fast. We tried 4 different appetizers - the house specialty was crab lettuce wraps. Sorry to say someone in our party referred to them as cat food.  
We also had the spicy spring rolls that were recommended.  These were pretty tasty.  The Quail Eggs were good.  Had some sort of deep fried pork & shrimp app that was bland on its own without the accompanying sauce.
Massaman Curry Pork was actually not spicy at all even though we ordered it as medium spice.

Crispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.

Crab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try.

The wine list WAS impressive.. especially for a reasonably priced Thai joint such as this. I knew I was going to go spicy, so I chose an off-dry riesling from Rheingau (they have a great German/Austrian riesling selection!) We started with the som tam (papaya salad), larb (ground pork with mint and chiles) and the fried quail. All were phenomenal! We ordered medium spiciness and it was perfect for me. Spicier than what typical American medium would be though, so beware if you're not a heat fan.

For my entree I went with the green curry with pork. It was rich and full of flavor. A little sweeter than I'm normally used to, but the spiciness and sweetness actually played VERY well with the wine. The pork was perfectly tender and flavorful. My friends got the crispy pork belly with some green veggies (amazing!), the ribeye with some yummy sauce, and the pad thai. All were wonderful.

I would give 5 stars, but the service just wasn't quite there. It was alright, don't get me wrong. But something was off.. I would have expected better wine service for a restaurant that prided itself in their wine list.

Our server had some recommendations (maybe since we were taking too long making a decision) and the one we went with was freakin awesome.  The Sen Mee Kang Pou which was a homemade crab curry with thin rice noodle was a slam dunk for both my wife and I.  She said it was one of the best Thai dishes she's ever had and I have to agree.  If everything the waiter recommended was this good then I would have had him pick everything.  

We also tried the Miang Pou.  That was a lettuce wrap with crab meat, ginger, roasted coconut, peanut, chili, lime and onion.  Nice starter and I liked how the filling was arranged in the lettuce to where you get the crab and spice at the end of it.  It was kind of like an appetizer money shot if you will.  

The final dish was the green curry which I wasn't too into getting.  My wife always wants it but I was sure glad we ended up having it because it was terrific. The curry had grilled pork, bamboo shoots and eggplant.  The sauce was really good but the pork was cooked perfectly.  It was so tender and tasty that it made the whole dish for me.  That's a protein I never consider for Thai curry but I definitely would now. 

Sure they have all the usual items any Thai restaurant does but I don't think that's what you should come here for.  Pad Thai schmad Thai yaaawwwwwn.

They also have vegetarian and vegan options, just let your server know and they'll help you out on which dishes they can make accustomed to your diet! 

The servers are always so nice and friendly whenever we come in. Also, they do reservations which is a plus because they can get pretty packed since the restaurant is kind of small.

5601702,2013-11-22,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"When I knew that my next Vegas trip was going to be with the No1DP, I wanted to introduce him to eating off-Strip. Vegas is considered a foodie destination city but according to foodie sites like Vegas Eater a lot of the gems aren't on the Strip. No1DP obliged, knowing that there was going to be a cab ride to and from the hotel.

CONCEPT: The restaurant of chef/sommelier Bank Atcharawan ""the Riesling dude"" (formerly of Lotus of Siam - helped develop the wine list there with focus on Rieslings), who won one of the ""Sommeliers of the Year 2013"" from Food and Wine. While Lotus of Siam's focus is on northern Thai cuisine, Chada Thai is focused on southern Thai cuisine, a region unexplored by many Thai restaurants. Bon Appetit also listed this under its top 50 new restaurants. 

CAB FARE: ~$13 from the Palazzo. 

VENUE: Like most Vegas off-strip restaurants, especially in Chinatown, it's located in a nondescript strip mall. The cab almost missed the restaurant as we approached the area where we thought the restaurant was and I had to look through the door to confirm that this was the restaurant. 

The inside has a minimalist look. Picture frames were along the wall where I sat. The main focus was on the large wine racks in the wall closest to the entrance to the kitchen. No1DP notes that the main focus would be more on the wine list and food. For a Friday night at 9:30 there were only several groups dining in. 

SERVICE: Good service, considering they only came by when they thought they were needed and left us alone most of the night. They also made good menu recommendations. While we were eating they also told us that 15 minutes prior to leaving they can call and arrange a cab to pick us up as they noticed that we arrived here via cab. 

WINES
No1DP: Reuscher-Haart Piesporter Riesling, Mosel, Germany (Riesling, $8). A crisp and slightly sweet Riesling. I normally don't like whites but his wine was better than mine and I seriously considered sharing another glass with him. 
Me: Bouchard Pere & Fils Bourgogne Pinot Noir, Burgundy, France (Pinot Noir, $8) Light and earthy and made a good sipping red. 

FOOD: No1DP and I decided to go a la carte.
Som Thum Goong Pao ($11) - Green papaya salad topped with grilled prawn. Papayas were crunchy, sweet yet slightly tart. Shrimps were grilled just right and had a slight crunch. 
Yum Kai Nok Kata ($6) - Fried Quail eggs, topped with dry shrimp, cilantro, onion. Spicy lime dressing. Egg was a mixture between poached and over easy. Yolk melted in mouth yet did not leave a mess on the plate. Dried shrimps definitely added a sweet and spicy kick. 
Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) with Lobster Tail ($21) - Flat rice noodles, hot chili, garlic and basil. Lobster was separated so that the dish can easily be shared. Lobster texture suggests it was cooked just right. More notably the noodles did not have a heavy taste, which meant that it wasn't cooked with TOO much oil. 
Seabass Tod Krueng ($19) - Pan fried Chilean seabass glazed with chili paste. Fish texture was SOFT and could be separated with a fork. The chili paste gave the fish a kick. No1DP notes that unlike cheap spices, where the spice is sharp and dissipates quickly the spice kick just lingers in your mouth a minute. Right amount of ginger.   

Most notably about these particular dishes was that sub-par Thai dishes have a very heavy feeling after you eat them. That was not the case with this restaurant and every dish we had was still quite light. This was a pleasant surprise as we wanted to have room for 3-course dessert afterwards.

Definitely will be back to try out more dishes and to have a crack at Bank's Riesling collection.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,3,3,5,--m02lMlYUHnKBuDic7_xg

I didn't have any ""regular"" dishes like pad Thai or curry so my review would not be good for that. 

I did have a bunch of other things which I will highlight. The oysters are very different. The topping they put on it makes it a different flavor than you would think and is a plus in my book. The shrimp comes with this sauce that is good with everything so you can put it with whatever you like. The fried rice dish was one of the best I've had in the city. Although I label myself a carnivore and stay away from veggies they had a mixed vegetable plate that was my favorite.

After all this, we did manage to try two desserts - though I'm not sure how we squeezed them in. They offer a moderate beer and wine list but do not have cocktails.

Give Chada Thai & Wine a try, you won't be sorry.  Make reservations!
ATMOSPHERE- 4 Stars
I have had Chada on my 'must try list' since I read about the opening of Chada Thai & Wine a couple years back.  The back story said 'Bank' ran the best Riesling-based wine program in the country (at Vegas's Lotus of Siam), and has since created a sensational wine list at his new Thai restaurant, Chada, where he is both sommelier and chef.  A 'quickie note' on Lotus of Siam, Food good, wait long, atmosphere packed like sardines, not so inviting.  Flip to the opposite at Chada.  Location also in a strip mall leaving entry 'uncertain'.  But, once you open the door a sexy, warm, hip, clean atmosphere pulls you in like gravity. I had made 8:30 reservations and commented ""guess they weren't needed"" as I scoped out only a couple other tables occupied.  (I ate those words along with the delicious food) In a blink of an eye this small, cozy spot filled to the brim. 
The dark colors, dim lights, large center red chandelier and romantic vibe makes you want to linger and soak in this experience. Great Date Spot.

SERVICE-5 Stars: Spot on from start to finish.  Total team work from the wait staff.

WINE-5 Star selection with by glass offerings top notch taste: mine- St. urbans-Hof Riesling Estate old Vines QbA, Mosel 2013 Riesling $8 and BF had- Oliverhill Shiraz Red Silk McLaren Vale, Australia 2012 Shiraz $8 

FOOD-5 Stars- some of the best Thai ever--portions/ entree's a bit on small side.
POR PIA TOD (4) Fried vegetable egg roll $6 (we actually ordered a second round of these little beauties)
YUM NUA * Rib eye steak, onion, tomato, cucumber, cilantro, chili paste-lime dressing on bed of greens $12
TOFU SOUP Soft tofu, ( had them leave out the ground pork), Napa cabbage, green onion $7 served in large bowl and held 4 cup servings...yummm
PAD KEE MAO (Drunken Noodle) Flat rice noodles, hot chili, garlic and basil With Seabass  $25 * so wonderful words won't do justice!
The Chef very accommodating - we ordered a plate of stir fried vegetables to please my 95% Vegan diet ..and a side of sticky rice.  No hesitation in a not on menu item..also so good we ordered a second vegetable plate.  
We had a second round of wine each and the total tab was $100.00

-- There's about 5 small pieces of ""lettuce wraps"" so it's like tapa size. Not going to be fulfilling for that price. It's a bit spicy and it was okay but nothing special. It had crab meat, ginger, roasted coconut, peanut, chili, lime, & onions.

Tom Kah Kai $8
-- coconut soup w/ chicken & mushroom; don't forget to get some rice with this ($1 per bowl). Nothing special to me.

Kai Tod $7
-- This is a fried half Cornish hen w/ garlic and it was the best thing out of the 3. I'd definitely get it again.

Overall, it was decent enough but nothing really stood out to me. Just A-OK. The good thing about this place is the hours so you can come out at 12am and eat here since they don't close till 3am. They don't have their liquor license yet, though.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,0,0,3,xalhd2SMSdpHrDh75lkwNA

I have been dining at Chada triweekly at minimum for the past 4 years. I seriously cannot get enough of this place! I made a major mistake and recently moved quite far so it's a bit of a commute, but honestly, it's so worth it every time. Chada is perfectly executed and authentic and everything is prepared to order so you can modify a dish if you like. I am both vegan and gluten free and have been able to enjoy almost every dish with tofu in place of meat and sans fish sauce, oyster sauce, and regular soy sauce. I highly recommend both the larb and pla nua tod. Both dishes are amazing and all omnivores I have shared with have raved about them too! 

I would also like to note that the staff is incredibly accommodating and welcoming. They are very helpful when inquiring about the ingredients or the flavor profile of a dish. Definitely check out Chada if you're a fan of Thai food. Of course, if you're a fan of wine, they're great for that too (I rarely drink so I am not the one to comment extensively). Last but not least, make a reservation if possible; they fill up quickly and can't always accommodate walk-ins.",rJvKwSkbrHphPUK66Fw86A,7,6,5,geyFgbVfeb2ileUECW_oRQ

Som Thum (papaya salad)

But as far as Thai goes here in Vegas, this place is every bit as good as Lotus Of Siam, and on many things better. Their menu is just slightly more limited but also much less expensive. Anything with their Chu-Chee curry is off the charts. The Penang curry is similarly perfect. Of course the industry foodies go here and the wine geeks ooze from the place for good reason. 

The oysters are always crisp and the chili-lime-garlic-cilantro touch is the bomb. On rare occasion their fantastic shrimp cakes are slightly over-fried but they still almost get swallowed whole. I will confess, that the superb selection of Rieslings and such are not always my thing , but they cover the bases with beers and the Singha is always consistently nice and cold.

But the real reason to come to Chada is the Tom Yum Koong lemongrass and shrimp soup. It can cure the common cold or get your head straight. Just writing about it makes me get in my car and go get some.

5854415,2014-09-27,0,dm6sO_Y8JdKTE1ZM955yug,"I truly enjoyed my first experience with Chada Thai & Wine!! I really enjoy the different food and flavor profiles from eating eastern cuisine, with Indian and Thai being my favorites. The complexities and layering of flavors and taste are amazing. Chada Thai delivers those things with vibrant balance and lives up to it's well deserved reputation. My GF and I arrived around 5:30 on a Tuesday evening.

SERVICE -

Considering the day and time, seating was quite available and there was no waiting. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and reviewed the menu. Our server and staff we always prompt and attentive.

FOOD -

We opened with a Thai Beef Salad (Nua Nam Tok) and Spicy Lemongrass Soup (Tom Yum Koong). Both were simply amazing and popped with flavors and complexity. I could write a page alone on the wonderful flavor layering with just the appetizers.

We ordered Pad Thai Hor Kai w/ chicken and the dish was wonderful. The noodles were moist and tender, not limp or soggy. Flavor balance was great with a slight spice and mild/sweeter finish. Great complement to the rest of our meal.

For entrees we ordered a whole Tilapia dish (Pla Tod Ka Tiem), a crab curry dish (Sen Mee Kang Pou), and a charbroiled pork dish (Moo Khum Waan). All 3 were staggeringly well made. The Tilapia was whole fried, crispy and not greasy at all, and the fish was moist and tender. Crab Curry was LOADED with pieces of real crab meat and has a smooth sweet open with a very spicy finish. The pork had a nice char, but again, the meat was very moist, tender and FULL of flavor.

ATMOSPHERE -

Chada Thai is a very small restaurant, so the space can feel a bit cramped and claustrophobic. With that in mind, if there are few patrons like there were this evening, the feel is more intimate. There is some bench seating, which for me is such a no no, but enough individual tables that you don't feel like your sitting in your neighbors lap.

All and all, the food is truly the star here and carries the establishment all the way to a top rating!! THIS PLACE IS A MUST!!",bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w,2,0,5,ZUeet9Dj55olCsppyC-lcQ

I thought Lotus of Siam was my #1 spot for spicy thai food with their never disappointing deep-fried crispy duck curry, but wait....Chada makes an equally AMAZING but not as deep-fried crispy duck pad kee mao that has this amazing flavor and is topped with fried basil. 

I can't decide which I like more, so it's a tie!

I also got the Thai iced tea (which was a little overly sweet, but still delicious), and the pork larb (which was tasty but definitely more than just ""1 chili"" spicy).  The number of chilis next to an item supposedly demarcates how spicy that item is...you can ask for spice level mild, medium, or hot as well.

The restaurant interior was low key but modern, with one of the walls proudly displaying part of their wine collection and another wall decorated with framed fine wine labels.  Pretty classy impression on a moderate interior decorating budget.

The service was good. I was parched but my glass of water was refilled frequently without having to ask the wait staff to do. After looking over the menu for what felt like 1/4 of eternity, we finally picked out three items to try for our dinner.

My favorite is probably the Pad Hed - Shitake and Shimeji Mushroom Stir Fried with Brussels Sprouts and Lotus Root. Excellent!  And it was the first item to disappeared from our table.

We also tried the Panang Curry - Slow cook Beef in Panang Curry.  The beef was tender and has good flavor. Overall, a decent dish but nothing that will screams ""You must tell everyone to order this!"".

Last but not least, Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) - Flat Rice Noodles, Bird Eye Chili, Garlic and Basil and Ground Pork.  Decent but still wish the portion was larger.  

Taste: (3.5/5)  I think the key is finding their better menu items.

Price/Value:  (3/5)  Average price, but portion on the smaller side.

Service:  (4/5)  Did a good job.

~3.5 stars.  But I think we have to do a better job of finding better items to order for our future visits.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,3,4,aluX9f9j12LDWqzSTB5LMw

All of the food was really good. I was initially appalled that the soups were $10 each, thinking it would be a single appetizer portion like I am used to in Thai restaurants, but Chada gave us a giant bowl of soup that offered the four of us more than a portion each. The herbal spring rolls were my favorite appetizer; while the crab lettuce wraps were good, they didn't do it for me.

For my main dish I ordered something with pork that was spicy and delicious. 

As the name would suggest, Chada Thai & Wine also has a pretty decent wine list, particularly for a Thai place, as well as about 10 bottled beer options.

Why only 4 stars? Two reasons: One, the restaurant was understaffed and service was correspondingly slow. I think this might have been some sort of accident (like a server calling out last minute), so I wouldn't let it stop me from going back. Two, the food didn't arrive at remotely the same time, so we had that awkward situation of ""Should I eat and be rude or wait and have my food go cold?""
