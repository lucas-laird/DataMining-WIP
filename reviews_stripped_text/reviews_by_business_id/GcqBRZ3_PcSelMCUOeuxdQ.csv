Sometimes I wish they would bring back the $.39 tacos, haha, just a suggestion.  This location is pretty fast with the orders and I haven't had a problem with any orders as well, check it out if you get the chance.",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,3,1,3,6Q4GiSt3JM9Qnv7aPI69cA

357999,2016-04-29,0,GcqBRZ3_PcSelMCUOeuxdQ,"Absolutely disgusting. Started off in the drive through. Ordered 2 shredded chicken mini quesadillas and 2 chips with cheese. Received 2 shredded chicken and 2 beef mini quesadillas. Usually we wouldn't have bothered and would've went straight home. My partner insisted  so we went in and asked for what we ordered. They were polite and refunded the overcharged amount and fixed the order. Got home. Took ONE bite to find a long black HAIR inside the quesadilla. Pulled it out. Opened it up and found a SECOND black hair in the food. 
 I have blonde hair and my partner has red hair. Needless to say... No longer going to this location. Professional staff but poor quality of food.",Q_th82nn3WDyVvGPSup5Ow,0,0,1,T3zwReYduh-ASSjSKocSIQ

I ordered my food tonight and got home and it had a hair under the cheese of the Mexican Pizza. At the sight of the hair I threw to food up just to me on the safe side. Who knows what else could be in there. I WOULD RATHER BE SAFE THAN SORRY! I tried to call and complain and of course  they didn't answer. It's probably  because they are putting hair in people's food on purpose! I will NEVER eat here again.",CMfQaxfeLk0wk7H47U93LQ,0,0,1,bamPgMNJiod5E3HSjwnrXw

Too many high school kids hang around sometimes, but that must be due to the cheap prices. Prefer this over Del taco...better hot sauce too!

Two stars mostly because the lady's attitude sucked & having to repeat what I wanted so many times made me cut my order short just to avoid the hassle of ordering additional items (or trying to) with this overwhelmingly joyful employee.",IIhCyixlXzFjSkFy1QdT3w,0,0,2,bT9sORvbldrBPnFqQrrA3A

1009733,2014-02-09,1,GcqBRZ3_PcSelMCUOeuxdQ,I've been eating at Taco Bell religiously for the last 8 years (mostly for the Mountain Dew) but this one is by far the best! It is always clean and the food usually comes out before you even fill your drink! They don't skimp on filling the tacos and burritos (a lot of taco bells do) which is always good. I'm not a fan of the new red Mountain Dew but the baja blast is very good. As with all franchises some are better than others and this location is by far the best in Vegas!,4gMMKt0iSQuMJe7lgz7KbA,1,1,5,QzC55Xi5XDVIFAtEs0OwYA

I always change my food up (customize it) and never have a problem.
The manager of this location is very good and friendly; as are the employees.
Very clean, restrooms always clean.

They have these new menu items that are like a crunch wrap but they are only $1.00.  Sweet price and all kinds of warm and melty cheesy gooiness.,8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,0,0,3,yDlppNIzvMNJCLZJZl8c6A

Anyway, they were open before their open time, and I went through the drive thru which was super fast!

The staff was friendly and our order was up in quick fashion. As I typically do, I just went with regular crunchy tacos. The others got Cantina Bowls and Nachos Bell Grande. My tacos were good and everybody was happy with their choices. All in all it was a good experience, however, it was so cold in there, my nipples could have cut glass. It was a nice break from the heat, but OMG! Basically, a four star experience, but the shrinkage forces it to stay down at three.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,2,2,3,uhYvTyRSLD5Z6od9Be8qGw
