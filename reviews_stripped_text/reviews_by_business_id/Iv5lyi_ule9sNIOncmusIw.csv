14036,2017-12-08,0,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"Mad respect for new exec chef Justin who brings a lot of talent and passion to Atomic.  His rustic refined cooking is something that has been sorely missing from Vegas for a long time.  Haven't had a chance to work through much of the menu yet, but Kingsley Wing is great, harrissa carrots a classic  (coriander cream, yum), and the Cuban is a flavor bomb of porky goodness.  Chef is also a madman, already putting out fantastic specials nonstop.  The chicken livers with mushroom ravioli and greens was amazing.

Drinks are also fantastic.  Should sell the Glass Onion as an aromatic mist to be enjoyed throughout the day.    And be careful you don't get so loaded your inner fat kid starts crushing bread pudding at the bar ""to sober up.""",5v-aMWCpiJ-nroqk88J_qA,1,0,5,8kbJmlo-AMqfjshtHIFH2w

They have a large bar and large booths, some high tables and some low tables inside, outdoors on a large patio are low tables. The menu has a small but good selection. We opted for LuLu pretzel with 2 dips one a spicy mustard  and the other a smoked beer cheese both were awesome. Wedges and blue was good- the dressing had good flavor but it was to thin. We shared the KJ prime rib dip, very good ! Our waiter Recommended the Frostie & fries, the ice cream was awesome except I wanted more- I'd lose the waffle fries and make it a little bigger and add waffle cone pieces and crushed malt balls!",F-eBGfQ_UOa-XVbpm3eQjQ,4,2,5,CFwEiIY23XMbXL3Kn93xIg

They had a dish I have not had since leaving New York.  Steak tartare!!! That won me over.  It was served the way i like it abd it was not over killed with spice.

Clean, open, appropriately lite, all around great atmosphere. We were greeted by Justin who was excellent. Extremely knowledgeable and passionate for the food. We ordered a few things to share and they came out when ready. Only issue was had which was more than justified was the tri tip special took a little longer, but Justin was uber apologetic and kept us updated on the refire.

It's on the edge of downtown, away from the Fremont complex. Once you were inside, it's a nice atmosphere. Weird music mix, which we mostly liked (James Brown, Eagles, live Stones and then some more techno sounding stuff).

Our waiter was fantastic. He was passionate about the menu, which changes periodically. He described the menu items very well and highlighted ingredients as well as the eclectic changing list of craft beers available.

Food was great. We both had sandwiches. My wife said her eggplant sandwich was the best food she had on our stay. I had a tri tip BBQ sandwich, which is like a brisket cut of meat. Made with their own fresh rolls, they are both great. Highlight was dessert, though. Bread pudding reminded us of French toast, with a lovely spiced whip cream.

Officially, the best foie gras that we had since we moved to the USA (We are French.) The Chef nailed it! It was followed by the Hen Gone Wild Chichen & the Roasted Fresh Catch.

1399277,2017-11-11,11,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"Reasonably priced and great food will be found here. Arrived early on a Saturday with friends to try out this spot. We were some of the first diners that evening since it recently opened for business at 5pm. 

Dining area has a nice open feel and you can sit inside or on patio. We opted for the patio on a beautiful autumn day. Service was excellent. Our server went over the menu. Menu is simple and not too over the top. Great selection of gastro pub cuisine as well as a ribeye if you are feeling like a big spender, albeit you will only shell out $18. Menu items are inexpensive. Food is delicious. 

I went with the spaghetti squash. Excellent choice and very filling. I noticed my friend's appetizer was served on top of a huge waffle. Turns out that waffle was a pepperoni pizza infused waffle. That sounded to me like the greatest thing invented since sliced bread. It was my favorite thing on the menu. It was spot on. They only charged me $2 for it. It was like hitting a small jackpot on a slot machine. 

Drinks are great. Order up one of their signature cocktails or have a few beers. Excellent choice of craft beers available on draft. If you're feeling old school just hit up atomic liqours next door for some after dinner drinks like we did. 

Good food and service. Easy to find in downtown just a few minutes walk from the Fremont street experience if you're an out of towner like me. I always encourage visitors and my crew to get away from the hotels and hoopla to find the best eats Vegas has to offer. Try them out.

1531186,2017-09-09,8,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"I love the concept and space at K@A! The menu is refined, the space is modern, the crowd is grown-hipster. I've been by twice and the beer menu is a thing of wonder (the Chai on draft is perfect for fall!), but food execution seems to vary based on who's in the kitchen.

I love seeing beef tartare on a menu, and this one with cured egg yolk was sufficient but would benefit from a bit more seasoning. The Mexican-influenced Caesarette with grilled cactus and corn nuts was a surprise hit, and I really like the lime in the dressing. An entree-size version would make a great vegetarian dinner! Props for having a spaghetti squash shakshuka and a veggie burger for those who are unable to eat meat.

Chicken thighs are the cut I work with most at home, and I really liked the gravy and chicken-fried mushrooms used in the preparation here, but it was a touch salty and the cuts of meat were oddly small and rubbery in texture. My guy opted for the Surf & Turf and the giant tiger prawns were easily the star of this dish, while the tenderloin was a touch tough. We shared the PBJ Bread Pudding, made with brioche. The flavor profile successfully nailed the nutty-sweet balance, but the hot buttered sherry sauce was unnecessary and overpowering. Perhaps it's because we went in right at their 4PM opening, but the dessert was also cold in the middle as if it'd just been taken from the refrigerator. 

We were informed that they were training new kitchen staff, which may explain some of the missteps above. I really am a fan of the menu and the space, and will be revisiting to try other dishes (specifically the wings and scallops!) in the hopes that the execution will be a bit tighter than my last visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,15,3,6JYtjApKulg4C10A9TwFmg

Today it's a sexy bar & restaurant with garage doors that open to Freemont street which makes it that much more fun! People watching is epic down here! 

To the drinks and food. I'd like to say I had way too much to drink here and it's because every drink on their menu sounds delicious and they are.

My man loved the chicken wings which come with a pepperoni waffle with this blue cheese mousse thingy. The presentation is also very playful. The hot dog trio was delicious but I prefer my dogs with lots of grill marks. The caesar salad was my least favorite item with a weak dressing and bitter greens and the highlight of the evening was a fresh and warm soft pretzel that comes with spicy beer mustard and smoked beer cheese. So decadent and worth every bite! 

The desserts were ok, nothing memorable.

2251606,2017-08-12,1,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"After my third visit in as many weeks, it's safe to say I'm a fan. Downtown is my favorite part of Las Vegas, and it is partially because of the great bars and restaurants. 

Comfortable seating, a bar that is the showcase is the room, and great old photographs around the dining space. Their menu offers enough choices so everyone can find something, without having too many options, it's all condensed down to one page. 

For appetizers I've shared the wings on the pepperoni waffle, the mac and cheese bites, and the pretzel. The pretzel was my favorite, and honestly as a carb queen, I would be happy with getting it as my meal with the wedge salad. 


The burgers are why I keep going back. They have a rotating weekly selection, or a build your own. Tonight I went with the weekly, with balsamic reduction and caramelized onions, blue cheese, and bacon - yum! I love their buns and how they are branded with the logo. 


For dessert I've had the frosty, and also the donuts. The donuts were my favorite - definitely shareable as they were pretty large. I wasn't crazy about the lavender ice cream but that is just a flavor aversion I have. 

The frosty and fries were good but the frosty was a little hard to eat, next time I would just ask for a straw.

2553350,2017-05-16,1,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"One of the great things about living in this day and age--the day and age of Yelp--is going to a town full of very touristy things, staying in the place full of tourists, but being able to suss out the really great finds. Such was the case with this restaurant. I was staying a few blocks away, and saw this pop up on the Yelp app as a hot new business. I was intrigued, but it was definitely not part of the main tourist section. If that had been my only reason for the trip--touristing--I would have never made it in. But lucky for me, I was there for more Yelpy reasons, and was able to get away from it all and chase down this place.

On the outside, you can see the story of two Atomics. The venerable old Atomic Liquors has been in that spot for ages. AGES. And the building has been maintained but still has the patina. Next door at the new kitchen, however, you have a new shine, a new patio, and it looks slick. Which is not to say it's not old. Apparently, it's an old mechanic's garage that had been there since earlier in the twentieth century. When it closed, Atomic bought the space with the idea of adding food to the booze side of things, spent a year remodeling, and opened a garage-esque restaurant as an homage. The old steel beams still hold it up, though they had to pour a new foundation.

Inside it's polished. It's nice but not fancy by any means. And over time, it will take on more character. I was greeted by Hannah at the door, who was sweet and suggested I take my party of one to the bar. There I was greeted by Chase, who was in the midst of serious ice making. They take their ice seriously, and he does the cooler trick to freeze clear ice, then has a fancy copper contraption to make the ice cubes into perfect spheres. I was mesmerized.

The menu is bifurcated into two schools of thought. On the one side, you've got bar food. Fried things, apps, shareable things. On the other, you've got nice, plated items. And it really is the kind of space that can pull both off. Back that up with an already proven bar program and you've got the makings of a flexible spot.

I went with the bar side of things. I started with a mini hot dog trio, which was actually a sizeable plate. I liked the Chicago dog best--Detroit dogs aren't my favorite, and the third (Columbian?) was topped with an adorable quail egg. On Chase's suggestion I got the burger and added avocado. They brand the bun with their logo which is a nice tough, and it was served with a big ol' pickle spear. They have a lot of options (21 by my count) to add on to your burger, which is kinda cool--you can certainly make it your own. It was super juicy, and although I don't love horseradish, the sauce was smooth enough to complement the whole thing.

I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to catch my flight, because I could have stayed for a while. Everyone was super cool, and there was a lot more menu to try. Total chill spot, probably will get rowdier on the weekends, but it's just far enough outside downtown that you're getting some good folks in the door, drawn to good drinks and a food program that looks like it will take hold.",HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,12,8,5,_8WrLSbQsBMoJwA2YOGTNQ

3016753,2018-06-14,1,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"I had been trying to get in here and eat for a few months and was pretty excited to finally walk in the door.  We were seated immediately and although it looked moderately busy, there were only a handful of employees working.  A server came over pretty quick at first and took a drink order but a while passed before he returned with the cocktails.  Cocktails were good but not worth the over 10 minute wait.  The food took a while to come out as well, including about 20 minutes for the oysters as appetizer.  Here's a breakdown of what we ordered.

Grilled oysters 5/5
Probably the best thing we ordered.  Great flavors, cool presentation 

Beef tartare 2/5
The flavors were bland and the portion size was huge.  The choice to serve them with fries didnt really work

Eggplant sandwich 2/5
When it arrived to the table the food runner says ""by the way we were out of eggplant so we made it with squash instead.""  We probably would have ordered something else if we had been told that before.  The sandwich itself was ok.  Fries the highlight of the dish by far

Coriander carrots 1/5
The carrots came out rock hard (as in raw and uncooked). I'm not sure if they were supposed to be served like that but they were nearly inedible.  

Ny strip special 2/5
We ordered the steak special which was served with (suprise) fries again.  A little more menu variety, especially with the specials, wouldve been nice.  The steak comes out and it is a very medium well ( we ordered it medium rare).  As people that are in the industry, we even used the flashlight on a cell phone to check it in the light.  The server takes it back to the kitchen and then returns and says ""The chef says the steak was the medium rare temp 134 degrees but we will cook you another one"".  I'm not sure why try to argue with the guest when the temperature was obviously wrong.  The next steak came out about 15, 20 minutes later and was much closer to the medium rare temperature we requested.  The steak tasted ok, nothing too special.",DCKvIfwBPxTUzb9Y1PGXCQ,0,0,2,jVMX1w1PTCf6lcWgXV9vCA

I've always loved Atomic and had an incredible experience at Atomic Kitchen when we first visited a little over a month ago, but they have since hired a new chef and changed the menu. Tonight we took some previous Vegas residents there and had the most awful food experience I've EVER had at a restaurant.  Both of the meals that were ordered were the worst I've ever seen. The pork was well over 50% fat with no side to offset the strange entree and the chicken was mediocre with a terribly bitter side that was no help to the protein for the meal.

After complaining about the terrible entrees we opted to replace them with a Cuban sandwich & fries, which were delivered incorrectly at first! After 15 minutes we got the corrected version which wasn't much better, it was overly greasy with a crazy amount of fat on the pork.

The redeeming factor of the meal should have been the incredible drinks Atomic typically offers, but those too were tainted by the new menu and were awful.

The issue was that a large group of what looked like Elite Yelp members or something were catered to over us - for over an hour. They received drinks, food, anything they needed. They wandered around the patio taking random pictures of their food and cocktails. Meanwhile we ordered drinks and an hour later we still didn't have them. I myself had ordered a draft beer...not quite sure how that can't be served immediately. I even get a 10-15 minute wait, it was fairly busy after all. But an hour? I promise I'm not exaggerating.

3705136,2017-04-09,11,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"Super stoked for the opening of the Kitchen at Atomic! After watching the building slowly come together over the past several months, it's cool (& convenient) to be able to hang out at one of my favorite bars AND be able to try some new, tasty food just steps away. The Kitchen shares a patio with the original Atomic, but also has its very own lengthy bar within, complete with a unique drink menu. With that being said, try the Imposter! It's a new favorite cocktail of mine, alongside the Atomic's good ol' Hunter S. Mash.

If you stop in at the Kitchen, you NEED to try the food. My friends and I have been here twice now already (lol, it's only been open for 4 days... oops?) and things just keep getting better & better. The menu has a good variety of things to choose from - including veggie options, meaning there's a little something for everyone! And each dish is so carefully & artfully put together. You can tell Josh Horton and his crew are really taking their time with the details.

So far, my favorite dish has to be the Ribeye Crown. It was sooo juicy and tender, being cooked just as I like it (a perfectly pink medium) and paired with delicious sautéed carrots & a ""smashed"" potato. Luckily, my friends and I are super into sharing, so we've all tried just about everything on the menu already: Scallops, spaghetti squash, ""Atomic"" chicken wings, macaroni bites, a soft pretzel w/ the fixings, Fat Man Fries, lemon-ricotta donuts w/ ice cream, etc... Seriously, almost EVERYTHING... and it's all AMAZING! I'm positive we'll be returning soon and often. We might even make this a weekend tradition. I know they're still in the opening stages and are still getting into the swing of things, but I hope they expand their menu and add more dishes!

Literally mind blowing food. We ordered the tomahawk and it was cooked perfectly....so so buttery. We ordered the Maitake mushroom Mac n cheese and baby potatoes w/ aioli. 

Mac n cheese was extremely creamy and the pieces of mushroom were such a good addition. The potatoes had a great crisp to them and the aioli paired really well with it. If I was alone in the restaurant I would've licked the serving plate the Mac n cheese came in.

3876007,2018-03-07,1,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"There's so many places that have a fantastic appetizer/small bites list that their entrees (given either their price point or their taste), don't quite live up to the expectations set by the prior courses. I think that The Kitchen at Atomic suffers from that as well. 

Our dinner group tried a number of snacks including the country pate & toast, foie gras slider, and the tri-tip beef tartare farm egg & wedge fries. Of the tree, I loved that foie gras slider. It was $19, but damn, that was one of the best pieces of seared foie gras I've had in a long time. It came with an assortment of pickled plums and granola, which was an interesting, but delicious platter. The country pate & toast was a great platter to share and the staff quickly came by with more slices of grilled toast. I believe the spread came with both a pâté mousse and a terrine, both of which went delightfully with the grilled toast. There was also a number of pickled vegetables, and mustard, all of which went quite well together. My least favorite was actually the beef tartare and egg, which I didn't really get too much of the flavor I was seeking. 

For sides, do get the maitake mushroom mac & cheese. It's a delight if you're a fungus lover like I am. Of the bowls, I also liked the ballerina pasta. Shallots, garlic, and squid ink really go well together. 

As for the entrees, many people at the table commented on how salty everything was. I had a taste of everything including the pork belly steak and the pasture bird cooked two ways, and I do have to agree on the salt. I ended up getting the central coast tri-tip, which had a large generous serving of tri-tip, but I found the meat to be very rubbery and chewy. My favorite was probably the chicken, both the white and dark meat. You could really taste the garlic grits with the white meat and the wine with the dark. 

While up to that point the meal had its highs and lows, we didn't expect dessert to steal the show. The whiskey bread pudding was a showstopper. It was an amazing treat. The bread was perfectly crisp on the edges and topped with cardamom whipped cream with smoked sea salt caramel. This should be a must-try for any diner here.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,12,5,3,dZEVWgm-v7akNNVqwqgAuA

The service was fair but argumentative and not only were we not asked if we wanted desert ( no way after what we had already experienced) but we waited 8 to 10 minutes after we clearly were not eating and finally flagged down a waitress to ask for the check. Four or five minutes later the original waiter brought it.
The Roasted Olives, Tomatoes, and Peppers was a wet mix of olives with straggled pieces of tomato and a bunch of tiny little pickled peppers with no taste or heat. Nothing had been roasted, maybe it was boiled.
The blackened Romaine salad had been on a grill but only long enough to give it a meat smoke taste, no grill marks and i think it was already wilted before it saw the grill. The only thing black was the overdone squid ink dressing.
The foie gras slider was not bad but it was served with a strawberry garnish that was a large, very pale thawed out frozen strawberry, that was mush.
The Tri-tip sandwich had over done cut up small chunks of meat with gristle and fat. Three quarters of it went home to the dogs.
The pork sandwich was basically inedible. A mixture of pork, overcooked to the point some was too hard to chew, smashed in a brioche, with something else not tasting good. Only the Labrador was allowed to have
this one.

4061446,2017-05-15,4,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"I visited on a Saturday night at 8 PM without reservations with the Fiery BBFF.  We were extra bored, hungry and found ourselves at the recently opened Kitchen at Atomic looking to smash our boredom.

Service: 4.5/5 The hostess was great. She asked how the night was going and if we wanted a table inside or outside as the weather was lovely. Our awesome waiter Justin Z. was very attentive to us from beginning to end.  After discovering this was our first visit, he mentioned that the restaurant use to be a Garage and was featured in the movie ""Casino"" He was helpful with telling the how the servings worked with the the mac n cheese bites we were eyeing (5 pieces)  He checked on us frequently and kept our Tito's and gingers coming.  Shout out to the waiter who we mistook for Justin after our 3rd Tito's.  He had the same stylish haircut and beard, friendly attitude but was wearing glasses.  He took our order for the 4th Tito's without hesitating as if he was assigned to our table himself.  Fantastic...lol

Food: 4.0/5.0 On our quest to Atom smash our hunger, we were either going with stacking up a burger with their awesome additions (see pics) or going with a more traditional dish in the ""main"" section.  I stacked up a burger with horseradish cheddar + sriracha bacon and of course a fried egg.  All additions were so tasty and the fried egg was cooked perfect to the point where not too much yolk flies out after the first bite.  Very impressed, with this tasty burger.  Waffle fries were the perfect compliment. The Mama Johns Mac Bites were tasty , but only came out in 5 small pieces.  3 more small pieces to get to 8 would be perfect.

Value:4.0/5.0 Our burgers started at $9 and each addition is either a $1 or $2..  The high quality additions were fantastic. (see pic) They had 7 different cheeses to pick from & if you've been following me you know that cheese = bae.  Our Tito's and gingers were $7 and mixed well.

Ambiance: 5.0/5.0 The courtyard outside has long tables to accommodate large parties. (10+) and there's plenty of seating inside the ""Garage"" with additional outdoor seating on the side.  The vibe and energy is great.  Great contemporary industrial feel in the garage with still some old school Vegas flavor and history.  The Atomic Bar, is a stumble next door and is perfect place to park for more drinks after dinner.

Summary:  We came in hangry and bored, and left full and recharged for a Saturday night downtown because of the great food, excellent service and vibe.  I look forward to heading back and either trying something off the main side, or stacking another burger with excellent cheese combos.  Afterwards we headed over to the historic Atomic bar that's connected to the kitchen, but that's another yelp tale. =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,10,7,5,M12tOw7x2NR52l9114chyQ

4240988,2017-05-26,17,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"I fully expected to love this place, as adjacent bar Atomic Liquors is a longtime favorite, and the Kitchen came highly recommended by friends. But I couldn't get behind it.

I mean no offense or disrespect -- service was great, and they seem like super nice people. The atmo was fine, except for the fact that, if you order food, you can't sit on the regular street-facing Atomic patio and people-watch the bums and weirdos -- you have to sit in a little walled-in inner courtyard, with nothing to watch but your fellow hipsters.

But the menu is what really got me down. The drink menu was confusing and just TOO weird, even for me -- and I'm someone who drinks some fucked-up shit! It was all anise cream and Scotch and flowers and shit, like one of those gradeschool cafeteria challenges where your friend mixes up every disgusting mis-matched condiment and liquid and dares you to drink it. WTF happened to regular-ass drinks?! Does every fuckin' drink have to have artisanal whale piss and a fox-endometrium floater to be served in polite society these days?!

The food menu was heavy on the burgers and hotdogs, but not the pedestrian ones you used to be able to buy off the cart outside the bar -- this shit is deconstructed af, and you pay twice as much for the privilege. The rest of the fairly slim menu was all over the place -- duck bacon, a frosty, scallops, shredded spaghetti squash with eggs and ratatouille al over it. Again, I like some WEIRD ASS FOOD, but this menu was really hard for me to wrap my head around -- there was no theme or unifying concept, just a bunch of weird-ass shit paired up with hot dogs, bacon and burgers. 

My sister and I had the two least-offensive sounding cocktails on the menu, which were pretty good, fairly strong and around $10 apiece. Mine also had some kind of seasonal flowers muddled up at the bottom of it, if stuff like that matters to you.

Then we shared the lobster mac and cheese bites, which were fine, and she had the veggie burger (which she said was kinda dry and not that flavorful) and I had the aforementioned spaghetti squash with eggs and some kind of tomato sauce on it. It tasted about how it sounds -- I'd call it hot'n'soggy. (I ordered it because I didn't want a burger, and nothing else really looked good....I mean, I have *never* had such a confusing time with a menu. I EAT EVERYTHING!).

Another friend joined us and had the frosty and waffle fries -- a desert item comprised of a small chocolate frosty with a side of waffle fries, which I guess are meant to be dipped in the frosty. The waiter recommended he add a side of duck bacon, which supposedly somehow adds to the party. My friend ate it all, but seemed underwhelmed/unimpressed.

Overall, I just felt like this place was trying too hard to be weird (or progressive/edgy/nouveau/whatever you'd call it). I see the other reviews are almost all raves, and I feel like a backwoods rube for not ""getting it...."" but I just don't get it.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,19,12,2,qJ0mJC-s5eR5ho0kAhHjGg
4346055,2017-07-13,1,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"I'm a fan! Came here on a Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed the ambiance, food, and dranks. 
The Kitchen at Atomic is actually located next door to Atomic Liquors, not inside as i anticipated. It carried more of a restaurant feel, rather than a bar. It does have a fabulous bar area though, if you're not interested in sitting at a table. The contemporary decor fits in nicely with the space.
The food menu is simple, yet every dish seems to have a twist. The mister ordered a 4th of July burger with waffle fries. And I opted out for apps, wings with a pizza waffle and mac n cheese bites. We also shared the soft pretzel. Everything was spectacular, except one... 
I was not feeling the mac bites. They came out kind of dry, with no signs of lobster. I took half the order to go and threw it out when I got home, realizing I was not going to eat them.
The soft pretzel was the first thing we tried and were immediately impressed. It was a ridiculous good pretzel! I loved the smoked beer cheese as well and ended up dipping my pizza waffle in it as well. It's like it can be part of a commercial, ""Smoked beer cheese, I put that B%!$h on everything""... The pizza waffle and wings were impressive too. The waffle had a pronounced pepperoni flavor making it perfectly savory. I took half of this app home as well, and actually finished it soon after :) 
My honey enjoyed his burger, it was topped off with bacon, hot dog, and beer cheese and a side of waffle fries. He offered for me to try it but it looked like a freaking tower in his plate, I did not know how to even attempt!
I typically like to have an adult beverage with my food. I opted out for the Impostor, why? tequila, that's why! It was a light, yet potent. A few rounds got me pleasantly tipsy.
Our server was wonderful, he gave us a little history on the establishment and was very attentive.

The food is where my main disappointment came from. To start there weren't too many vegetarian options to chose from which kind of surprised me considering it's downtown. The menu was very small and limited in general. Either way I decided to order the vegetarian pot pie. When it came out it looked beautiful, but the flavor was so bland and boring. I think the best thing in the dish was the tomatoes.  

Also back to the service part - our food all came out at different times which I get for a group is somewhat normal, but the last two meals didn't come out until way later after everyone else was already finished with their meals.

The entrees were all on point. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I had the u10 scallops which were seared perfectly, med/rare, and succulent and sweet. Most places over cook scallops.

Anyone who knows the Vegas bar scene knows the Atomic, the oldest and most iconic dive bar in the Fremont badlands with a solid selection of craft beers and bourbon.  

So what gives?  They convert the neighboring mechanics shop to a separate, freestanding restaurant, The Kitchen at the Atomic that has nothing to do with the original Atomic Liquors.  Some millennial urbanites idea of a bar; polished concrete, glass, pompous mixed drinks and trendy food (you know, truffle this, foie that, brioche, miso, yuzu, demi).

Ignoring my disgust, the food is OK by Vegas' very high standards.  Lulu's soft pretzel, a warm, chewy pretzel roll with beer mustard (whole grain mustard) and spicy beer cheese (oh yeah), not traditional but satisfying.  Mama Johns Mac Bites aren't as successful.  Basically lobster mac & cheese balls atop an excessive amount of gruyere béchamel.  Extremely rich and creamy but the flavor of the lobster is lost.

The burger, thick, free formed patty, well seasoned, cooked to temp, A-OK.  The addition of thick cut siracha bacon and pickled jalapeños and a fried egg (toppings sold separately, $1 - $2 each) made it sing though a regular bun would have been preferred to the brioche that rapidly got soaked with the burgers juices.

Finally the rib eye crown.  This is the best deal in the place.  A grilled rib cap for $15.  Tender and fatty in all the right ways.  Aggressively seasoned. Roasted carrots a nice touch.  Great dish to share.

Very friendly local service.  Inexpensive food prices.

I love that the restaurant is open to the outside, great for summer. Our waiter (I think his name was Justin) was so fantastic and took his time to explain every little detail about the dish when we had questions, from the start of ordering to when we actually received it. I had the Mac Bites and Scallops which were phenomenal! The fat fries were delicious as well! Towards the end we got the lemon donuts and that was one of the best desserts I've ever had! Definitely will be going back!",mO-AAuRLEAaGUuGYw_Q6Yw,3,3,5,XFSu6sQSTdfCftA2Pl2YLw

5278869,2018-04-18,5,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"When Justin Kingsley Hall took over The Kitchen at Atomic it was almost certain that Downtown Las Vegas was about to receive another great Restaurant and having already been impressed by Dinner service it was together with three others that Brunch was sat down to on Saturday, Chef Hall's various former homes inspiring a menu that lacks for neither quality nor creativity.

Opening the garage door looking onto East Fremont widely, Las Vegas' early-Spring as well suited for al fresco enjoyment as Sin City always is for day drinking, it was seated in a rounded leather booth that guests were greeted by a server named Cameron, the menu as yet difficult to find online tempting with sections labeled Small Plates, Sides, Entrees and Seafood Shenanigans.

Restricted to folks 21-and-older, an understandable limitation not uncommon in Sin City, it was as the likes of Led Zeppelin played at low volume from speakers overhead that Brunch began with a slow roll-out of plates, the first of two $4 orders of Fries crisp and delicious whether with Ketchup or aromatic Saffron Aioli alongside deboned Smoked Trout and Vegetarian Hash that offer plenty of temptation themselves, the former simply allowing excellent Fish to shine while diced Spuds enlivened by Peas and Citrus provide an inspired alternative for those who've had enough of Avocado Toast. 

Nowhere near as busy by day as in the evening, a combination of factors including Atomic Liquor's storied history as a late-night favorite likely at play, it is on the Menu's backside that diners will find a handful of Cocktails created to compliment the full Bar and whether one opts for a Mimosa, Bloody or the Cold Brew-based ""Not Your Average Joe"" they can rest assure that the price is right as ingredients are as carefully selected as those that make up the Cuisine.

Smartly making familiar plates his own without abandoning the original concepts, Hall's side of ""Bacon"" in reality thick slices of Pork Belly cured on-site with Coffee and Orange, those seeking a dish that truly stands out would be well advised to request at least one order of ""Beefy Monkey Bread"" featuring three caramelized Rolls presented sticky beneath Bresaola, though the meatless contingent is certainly not forgotten whether one selects the daily Urban Seed Salad, fragrant Baby Potatoes or Atomic's take on Shakshuka that adds Chickpeas for texture amidst spicy Tomato Sauce and poached Eggs.

Allowing plenty of time to linger over Coffee and conversation, the large space and high ceilings offering a far less frenetic feel than eat or Carson Kitchen, those with more robust appetites will be pleased to know The Kitchen at Atomic does not hold back when it comes to plates labeled as Entrees, the Burrito named after a Street in Hall's hometown of San Luis Obispo easily enough to feed  two from its assortment of Eggs, Cheese, Potatoes and Beef while Chicken Fried Steak reportedly dedicated to Other Mama's Dan Krohmer sees 10oz of Grass-fed Beef  from Tasmania flattened and exquisitely tender alongside two Farm Eggs and Toast for just $21.

Never one to pass on Grits, the Southern staple here whipped thick with Cream and Garlic, those looking to end things on a high note will be happy to learn that the SLO-boy's famous Whiskey Bread Pudding also makes an appearance at Brunch, here ditching the Cardamom and skillet in favor of a French Toast preparation completed by Barrel aged Maple Syrup and lightly sweetened Cream. 

FIVE STARS:  Well-culled but offering plenty of options to suit a variety of appetites The Kitchen at Atomic immediately becomes the weekend's best reason to be in DTLV for Brunch unless one is below the legal drinking limit.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,13,5,UPIJ50dazhgJo3NtFc_ZFw

5428880,2017-06-22,0,Iv5lyi_ule9sNIOncmusIw,"Saw that this place finally opened after anticipating it and I can say it sort of lived up to expectations. There are a lot of unique and interesting options that sets itself apart from the other restaurants in downtown but keeps it familiar at the same time.

We ordered:

Steak Tartare - Don't know if it was supposed to be this way but normally the steak tartare is usually wet and mushy with the egg yolk mixed it but this seemed to be a little bit more drier a crumbly. Different but def not the worst I've had

Fat Man Fries - shiiit this is basically an entree itself. If you ordered this with a burger your fucked cause you gonna be full. Similar to ordering Oxtail Chili Cheese fries and a burger at Bachi....everything you want in here, chili, hot dogs, bacon...even though the hot dogs can be better....but for the  

Chicken Wings - Wings were ehhh but the staple to this dish is the pizza waffle...shit is pure genius and has potential if paired up differently like a chicken parm and waffle type situation.

Hamburger - reminds me of the burger i had at Andres so you know its in proper quality


Overall very excited and anticipating what they do in the future. Most def an excellent addition to DTLV",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,2,1,4,mvDJSo9pq5P1_BYXkqpCpA

I went with five people and we all got a variety of menu items which we absolutely loved. Everything from wings to steak tartare, wings with pepperoni waffle (a pleasant surprise beneath the wings), lemon ricotta donuts, and a bottle of red blend for 18 dolla!

An urban twist on traditional bar food - but with a traditional bar food price. 

Justin, our gallant bearded server, was extremely knowledgeable and attentive in all matters regarding the menu. Knew the wine list and cocktails like the back of his hand.

Love the vibe in here!

We shared the Cigar City (cuban sandwich) with fries.  Oh dear lord, it was the best cuban I've ever had!!

The roll was pressed and buttery. The shredded pork was definitely slow roasted, tender and juicy. The right amount of fat for flavor. Yum! Tons of cheese! Homemade pickles, mustard. So good! The fries were perfectly crispy and hot. 

I would love to try more food.",3B-lK3FZqog0TwYc8D0guQ,1,1,5,3QNan26m3euj5GlrO3dpmQ

The place always has a good crowd and vibe
The drinks are creative and they have a very deep variety of alcohol. 
The small but we'll executed menu is fantastic!
The bartenders are proud of their drink creations and will engage in a discussion of them.
Prices are upscale but not outrageous.
My favorite menu item is the decadent shrimp cheese sticks. About an inch around it is a combination that works surprisingly well.  Their hamburger is one of the best in the city and you choose what goes on it from a list of toppings. 
Definitely worth a visit.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,7,7,5,6lkguBXmoKvtPtRIf8bl2w

However, we walked in directly friendly staff with a big smile on their place 5 of 5 directly.

The food and drinks was good but the best part is the staff is super friendly specially Jamie she is amazing server and funny everything was quick from the appetizer we had.

AppetizerCorn dog on stick, hot dog with some topping don't remember.

Dishes: Burger delicious

Dessert: Donuts with blueberry ( My dates favorite) It was so good but to bad I was too full to finish it. 
My date finished it and he is a geek when that's comes to donuts.

All in all good food and the staff was amazing defiantly coming back here next time I'm coming to LV.

After cocktails at Atomic Liquors, dinner at The Kitchen seemed like a logical choice. Weeknights seem to be pretty mellow in the dining room so we sat at the bar. The bartender made me some sort of mezcal cocktail to keep the night going. It was delicious. Smoky, yet refreshing. 

I loved the burger. We split it and got the onions and cheese on the side because my friend can't have dairy and doesn't like onions. I know, I know. I don't know why we are friends either. All that aside, the burger was delicious and juicy. The bun was soft and didn't fall apart. The fries were thick cut. Loved. 

I got the chance to chat up Chef Kingsley and I love his passion for the menu too. He has some cool plans for dessert that I can't wait to experience. We skipped the bread pudding this time but next time it's going down.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,22,19,4,0MrDWI3l7jmad0mPYLTZQg
