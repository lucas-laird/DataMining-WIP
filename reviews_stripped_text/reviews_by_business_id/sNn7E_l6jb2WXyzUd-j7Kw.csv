Where there's one, there are typically many... very comforting. 11:55AM and they had no fries ready for the lunch rush, I'm going to guess that there was some sort of communication issue behind the counter on whoever dropped the ball there. They also have a window company replacing a shattered glass window in 106 degree weather during their lunch rush.... not very comfortable for dine-in customers. Maybe that should have been scheduled in the early morning or late at night... Worst Wendy's experience I've ever had by far.",VLjpkVGMbDby08vK2sv19A,0,0,1,YhEYc7Hr0i8Rj2Gud4nndw

They didn't have the drink I ordered and they had me waiting without letting me know, finally I get told that they don't have my drink and asked if I wanted something else; when I told them what I wanted they still had me waiting.

I got up and went to the counter to ask whete was our food and the lady in a screaming tone said I lost your ticket what did you order? So at this time we were still waiting for our food and we were not getting serverd. We finally got our food and my wife was furious but she didn't say anything.

We went back a week later and my wife was on the mood for some nuggets so she got down an enter the restaurant about 15 minutes later she came back steaming the same old lady had taken her order and she did not gave my wife the food she was dispatching people who order after her, my wife confronted her and her escuse was that the other orders were smaller, and made her wait a bit more. When she arrived to the car I ask what is wrong she told me what had happen so I told her it's ok to calm her down and that she need it to call corporate so she did, we she spoke to the person they were apologetic and they told her some thing was going to be done after my wife laid into the corporate person.

3 days later my wife gets call from the store manager with another apology and to pretty  much justify the employee  for her actions my wife refuse to acknowledge  the manager apologies after all he was justifying  the employee,  in order Words calling my wife a lier I sincerely want to ask to any other customers  with the same or similar experience  to not to stay silent either call corporate or post it here so some thing is done.

And for the record we will not stop until something  is done about this crappie  customer service fats food joint and the poor management.",RvO7E-qES3E89TY5-9dxAw,0,0,1,PXP-RRL-_vHN43YL3lOhzQ

But this location, man. I ordered one of their over-priced fancy entrée salads, and the portion was more of a side salad than an entrée but still set me back like $5. A little ridiculous considering they don't offer hardly any other ""healthy"" options on their menu.

Luckily I'd added on several dollar-menu options for the BF, so I wasn't totally screwed out of a meal. But this is pretty much cementing my decision to steer clear of fast food places- or to just resort to this place for the chili in emergency lunch situations.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,0,2,fAdQFR2NGqs-1_lB0MDrfA

Travis your employee there made an inappropriate
 comment while the nice gentleman took my order and was explaining that I didn't want a bun to whoever was making my burger. Travis said verbatim ""well someone's on a diet"" loudly when I was online and other patrons were behind me. Well I have Celiac's disease (I am allergic to gluten which is wheat hence the no bun) after all the employees got their laughs he handed me my fries and didn't apologize after me voicing my concern. The manager never corrected him or apologized for the incident. Just now I am eating and the guy who took my order came over and apologized. I will not tolerate this behavior. Carl's Jr. From now on.

Like many, I'm sure, just stopping by here for lunch while my car oil gets changed next door. Didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised at the level of attention to customers they have at this location. With a smile, referring to me by my name they politely assured me that my food is getting done fresh and will be ready in a few more minutes. And it was.
Food. Of course it's fast food, so don't expect me to say this was the best meal of my life, however, it was pretty fresh and tasty for fast food. I'm surprised how they could get their chicken so perfectly juicy. 
So 4 stars is just right for this spot.

3684557,2017-11-18,1,sNn7E_l6jb2WXyzUd-j7Kw,"Drove up to the speaker and the girl acted like immediately like she didn't want to talk clearly into the mic. As if she was being a little dismissive when I got to the drive-through. As I pull up to the window, I sense that there was an attitude. she was very sharp and stern like is if she did not want to be at work. Asked for a grilled chicken sandwich with no honey mustard but adding mayo, light salt on french fries. I always asked for light salt on french fries because I like my fries fresh. And that's normally how it's done. As she gave me my bag I opened it to check to make sure everything was correct. Everything but my fries of course.  I check the sandwich and everything seem to be fine but as I'm checking it, it seems like immediately the whole staff came to look into my car to see what was going on like as if I was a celebrity, because as I put my sandwich back into the bag, I see them all staring at me! Lol. Very awkward. 

 I got home and I started digging in the bag for french fries and guess what, my fries was not cold. I ate the sandwich before I got there but I was so hungry I didn't complain about how stale the bread was. I just wanted a quick meal after the gym. But I got a attitude and  awkward stares for no reason. Stay away from this place. It seems like anybody can get a job.",i7FmWeaHiD8BrhgvyIvJBA,1,0,1,F19OaZRGE_TCr7TLLDlx0g
