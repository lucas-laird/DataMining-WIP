I expect overpriced in Vegas, so all I hope for at the very least is friendly service and a good product. Sweet Chill knocks it out of the park in both respects. The people there were dishing out free samples like they were getting paid to do so. I tried close to ten flavors and all were fantastic. This spot gets the 5 stars because it had one of the best coconut gelatos I've ever had, and I try it everywhere. Tons of shaved coconut going in the scoop, it was the realest of real. Great flavor selection included carrot, gingerbread, turtle, nutella, to name a few. The people there seem to love their job and love the ice cream. I feel them on that.",dlQk03MstQOBlwqVqMwx7A,1,0,5,jlo7U0mpbETGAuo94ZqnAw

Sicherlich  man muss nur suchen oder Bescheid wissen. Im Aria (http://www.qype.com/place/1621121-Aria-Hotel-Casino-Las-Vegas) Hotel gibt es diese Insel des Rückzuges, wir haben sie selbst erst sehr spät entdeckt.
 (Siehe Foto unten) Sweet wird interpretiert durch die Farbe Pink!
Das Sweet Chill erinnert an die Barbie-Welt. Pink dominiert als Farbe, ergänzt mt andersfarbigen Tupfern der Stühle. Viel Plastik und Glas, der ganze offene Raum wirkt klinisch sauber. 
Abseits des Trubels im Erdgeschoss liegt das Sweet Chill auf der Promenade-Etage. Eine große Rolltreppe führt hinauf, aber die muss man erst einmal finden. Einfacher geht es mit dem Fahrstuhl, aber auch hier heißt es gewusst, auf welchen Knopf drücken. Die Lösung: P = Promenade. Auf dieser Etage sind ein paar wenige Edelboutiquen und es ist der Zugang zum Außenpool-Bereich. Wir entdeckten das Sweet Chill, als wir in Bademäntel gehüllt zu den Außenpools gingen.
Eine gute Entdeckung: Coffee, Espresso, Pastries and More! So wirbt das Sweet Chill für sich. Das More ist besonders wichtig, denn frische, leckere, gesunde Salate laden ein, wie auch jede Menge Sandwiches. Alles für den kleinen Snack zwischendurch. Zu angenehmen Preisen im ansonsten hochpreisigen Aria-Hotel.
Von 7 a.m. bis 7 p.m. lädt das Sweet Chill zum Verweilen ein. Take away  auch möglich. Und damit wird das Sweet Chill zu einem richtigen Tipp. Gerne weitersagen!
Fazit: A sweet way to start the day!  so steht es am Eingang. Richtig, aber auch ein sweet way to stay at noon or to end the afternoon preparing for a wonderful Las Vegas night. Four stars!",j0rsg8j7TnLjO6pH2jA64w,0,0,4,Qx68KLN3lfDsrfBR66Mhyw

The only thing that I don't like is the cup.  When you ordered two scoops, they gave you a coffee-like cup.  It was kind of difficult for me to enjoy the two flavors at the same time.

2557725,2010-09-24,1,TZM4eiv3CtR9CBPtknXgDw,"The college of frozen desserts

Some people cannot tell the difference between gelato and ice cream.  Their loss.  Although ice cream has more butterfat and more sugar than gelato, gelato has more flavor.  The fruit or chocolate flavors are not muted by the butterfat.

This lesson was well learned on our trip to Sweet Chill.  As a former college student that spent years trying to pay off college debt, I know that any education can come with quite a large price tag.  I expected a dessert-lunch (yes, I was having gelato for lunch) at Aria to cost as much as my college education.  Afterall I was about to learn something.

To start, I learned that pistachio ice cream (er... gelato) isn't my cup of tea.  Neither is Nutella.  Total cost for these lessons, zero.  If you are questionable about a flavor, just ask - they'll happily give you a small spoonfull.

I also learned that a small is like $4.75 while a large is $7 and change for 3 times more of the Italian confection.  Since I was there with my wife, we went with the large 3 scoops (Strawberry, Chocolate, and Blueberry Cheesecake) and saved a few bucks.

I also learned that gelato is denser than ice cream.  Ice cream is about 50% air, making it easy to scoop (if you've ever melted then re-froze ice cream, you know the stuff is rock hard without the air).  Gelato on the other hand is only about 25% air.  It's freezing point is kept in check with less fat and a scientifically-balanced amount of sugar to maintain it's softness.  This results in 50% more edible dessert.  If you eat with your eyes, you may feel that $7.57 (after tax) for 12-16 ounces is pricey, but you stomach will be filled as if you just ate 18-24 ounces of ice cream.  A fine lesson indeed.

Finally, I learned that Aria (in the City Center) must truly be an expensive place, because even though I was sitting in a kid-friendly location (essecentially an ice cream parlor) I didn't see signs of a single kid.  Tables wern't sticky, floors were clean, chairs were spotless.  But the decor was all hard plastic, so maybe after a group of kids come through, they just close the doors and hose the whole place down with a high pressure firehose.",cMAiTrM0Fxm8vKLQag53jg,1,0,4,N62ok9EGE1yOhvG5Pj3-jw
2664938,2010-01-27,8,TZM4eiv3CtR9CBPtknXgDw,"Yes, the Aria in the new City Center is a very chic, very European, and very out-of-my-league-so-don't-bother-trying kind of place. So I would expect nothing but a tres-chic ice cream parlor in a hotel as fancy-schmancy as the Aria. With its perpetual video showing on the outside wall to draw you in, Sweet Chill is just that type of place in all its muted day-glo rainbow glory. Its clean, pinkish and slightly retro-look is meant to evoke an earlier time when people enjoyed sitting on plastic, butt-contoured chairs (see photos). It's as if Paris Hilton opened her own gelateria, bitches.

They serve sandwiches and salads, but the eye candy is really the variety of ice cream flavors to be seen in their long glass display case. Prices are not surprisingly on the high side with a large cup a whopping seven bucks. Jamie W. and I shared a small cup of peanut butter gelato for the comparative bargain of $4.75 (see photo). I say bargain because you do get three small scoops which you can lick slowly to take in all the colors of the seats in the place. Eventually, the cacophony of pan-EuroAsian voices does make your ears bleed - and you have no choice but to leave and go back to your $80-a-night hotel way, way down the Strip.

ICE CREAM - 4 stars...judging from the peanut butter, very creamy and tasty if a tad pricey
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...chic while you lick with abandon
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit non-descript...it is a new place
TOTAL - 4 stars...stop for your sweet tooth and then do fifty laps in the Aria pool around the corner",m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,12,11,4,WEx1uQRzXx2FL0_l1t8P1g
3176205,2010-02-28,1,TZM4eiv3CtR9CBPtknXgDw,"Looks like I am the only one who didn't think Sweet Chill was worth more than 2 stars, mainly for the way we stood off to the side at ""ORDER HERE"" but no one acknowledged us, even after they saw us standing like dummies, in a line that was non-existent. The gal who saw us just went back to sloshing around a scoops, utensils and other imaginary pots. We asked someone ""are you in line"" and she said yes. That's how we found out ORDER HERE really meant, no, the line is over here.

Ok, so....Coffee cost $3.50 for a small - not bad, but it was so-so. I drink coffee black so I like a good cup but it wasn't better than say, McDs.

Ice Cream...excuse me....Gelato - $4.50 for what appeared to be a smallish scoop. Fortunately I didn't even need to buy ice cream since they give you a sample if you ask for it. I sampled a pistachio and it was, again, just average tasting. I didn't want to part with my hard earned gambling cash to blow it on a scoop of just-average gelato.

Decor - super duper cute with pink-everything: floors, tables, neons. Chairs are also in candy-coated colors. 

Ideal location for = ambience, first dates, young people who like pink things, older people who like over-priced gelato, rich people, fantabulous models who like to pose with equally beautiful ice crea....oh excuse me, gelatos.

We came here a couple of times in our four day stay and I wish we had time to have gone here at least once more.

Yeah it is a bit pricey but if you order a large gelato you get FIVE scoops for $7.00 instead of a small one with two scoops for $4.50.  I wish I would have asked that the first time, I could have saved some money and shared.

I'm not giving them a 5th star because they charge OUTRAGEOUS prices for their drinks.  They wanted almost $5.00 for a SMALL soda.  NO way...and a bottled water was the same price.  They gave me a free cup of a water and I was happy with that.

When my eyes met the long strip of radiant colors coming from the escalators, my friend anticipated my desire to look and asked if I wanted to get some. The answer is always yes. We thought that we would save ourselves some calories by splitting a cup. Seeing the single scoop cup, we didn't think they would give us too much. We wanted two different flavors anyways, so we opted for the double. We drastically taken aback when we saw the worker pile on this frozen delight. For such a fancy establishment, I was expecting to get gouged, but instead we got our moneys worth and more. 

We got one scoop of Oreo and one of butterscotch cookie. You can never go wrong with the black and white childhood favorite. On the other hand, the butterscotch outshone the Oreo in every aspect. While both were creamy, smooth with a silky texture. The butterscotch was complex with a lingering taste of cinnamon. For $6.75, I was left feeling more than satisfied. 

Out of all the gelati shops in Las Vegas, I know where I will be heading when I have the urge for decadence. I am glad that we passed by Jean Philippe and found this place. 

The extra bonus is that a swimsuit store is located across from Sweet Chill. While you are indulging in this sugary fix, you know exactly why you can't fit into those board-shorts or bikini.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,0,5,0SCC_NSWf1--xMm9-aywgA
