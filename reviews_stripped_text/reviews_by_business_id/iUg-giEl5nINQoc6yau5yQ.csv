Is this a ""latest and greatest""? No. Is it still a great find? Yes.

South Point has a laid back atmosphere. You can show up without a reservation and wear jeans...you'll fit just in! The split pea soup, mashed potatoes, and english cut prime rib are delish. The spiked mac'n cheese appetizer is amazing too!

Point of this post: If you're looking for a super upscale prime rib joint, this is not your destination. If you're looking for a super upscale prime rib joint, you also wouldn't be complaining about the $16.95 (prime rib, potatoes, salad/soup) pricing here because you would KNOW that the same dinner would run you $100 per person at said super upscale prime rib joint. This is good food at an incredible price!

If you want to complain, go spend an extra $80 per person at Lawry's (YUM!). All I know is that for the price, quality, and the fact that I don't have to fight the Strip tourists to get there, this place gets 4 stars in my book!",aWtij20vVUm0uglJViiCxQ,2,0,4,5Af4ZHUF1e3PFlRAfbKZag

(I don't count the coffee shop as a restaurant.)  This time we got a late start home to L.A., so decided to have dinner before hitting the road.  

There was no wait on a Wednesday and we were seated promptly.  I had the South Point cut of prime rib (this is their specialty, after all) and my wife had the chicken pot pie.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The South Point cut was just the right size for me and it was done as I'd ordered.  It was not too fatty like so many other prime ribs I've had, and was perfectly tender.  Combined with their horseradish sauce, it was great!  The baked potato was also good, and that's coming from someone who isn't a big potato eater.

The table service was friendly and efficient, and the prices are reasonable.  This is not exactly a high-end restaurant, but it is definitely a notch above average.  I agree with yelper Vick D.'s review about the bread, salad, and atmospheric lighting.  I'd say this is a solid 3 1/2 star restaurant, a 4 star on a good night.

If you are in South Point playing the slots and have a hankering for red meat, I'd say Primarily Prime Rib is your best bet!  It is one floor up from the casino.",1gNFHMw9N3LuNO5-rU3_Eg,1,0,4,sq-5_1o_Cugqx5-QAkeCFw

The good:
-Food was tasty
-Service was friendly/ attentive
-Price was right (Went during Restaurant Week  and 4 of us ate for $140)

The bad:
-Strange location/ ambiance. Not really casual, not really fine dining. Generic decor, lacks a true identity.
-Uninspired menu/ sides. Same ole stuff, nothing creative, nothing new or noteworthy.
-Small-ish portion sizes. The oz. of the prime rib was not listed, and the heartier eaters in our group would have opted for the ""Cowboy Cut"" if they'd have known how dainty the ""South Point Cut"" was.
-Servers just took our leftovers without asking if we wanted to-go boxes. While their wasn't much food left, we have two big dogs that we carefully excised the fat of our meat for, and the servers just took our plates without asking if we wanted to save anything.

Overall:
We will probably be back since we live around the corner, and the price is right. If you are hungry get the bigger cut!",MO7NAGoPvyjFpFdvE221JA,1,0,3,TJuhXvsQ1R1TT5K9DBLDpA

Atmosphere - simple yet intimate.

Service - top notch ( Ask for Joseph ). He checked in on various questions we had, was very knowledgeable and was not overzealous and working for his tip. 

Food - great for the price! Compared to known prime rib names the cost and size of food is amazing. We ordered: 

Wine: Ballard Cabernet ( wine of the month special ) and it complemented the beef well

Appetizers: Me-mushroom Parmesan dip (great flavor, good consistency, could eat it on anything). Hubby- shrimp cocktail (overpriced for what it is but good).

Entrees: Country cut as end cuts (20-22 oz for only $28 each). Came with choice of salad (ordered spinach salad - good amount of balsamic and strawberries and red onions went well in salad), choice of potato (ordered mashed potatoes - creamy and good butter flavor) and a side (me - creamed corn and hubby - creamed spinach). Both sides were missing something but a dash of salt and pepper helped.

Desserts: Me-peach bread pudding (warm bread and a good custard. The Peaches seemed canned). Hubby-cheesecake (average taste, nothing special).

The service was mediocre at best. I will give it to them that they were OKAY at refilling water. But our waitress acted like she really couldn't care whether we were having a good time or not. She quickly took our orders, would come by our table and ask how we were in a really apathetic tone, then walk away before we could even answer.

Usually if the service is bad, I don't mind as long as the food tastes okay. Well, it didn't. I ordered the chicken farfalle, which is pretty much cheese topped grilled chicken placed over a bed of pasta in a tomato cream sauce. It came with a soup and a side, so I got the ""red"" clam chowder and the mashed potatoes. I always thought red clam chowder was called ""Manhattan"" but I guess they made something different? The soup was okay, it tasted like tomato chicken soup. My main plate was average tasting at first. The pasta was okay for the first few bites, then I was just tired of it. The sauce was rich in a way that wasn't pleasant for my taste. I will give them props for not overcooking the pasta. As for the chicken, it was unfortunately dry and that ruined it for me.

The weirdest thing was the mashed potatoes. My date asked me to try them and see if I could taste a certain ingredient. I couldn't put my finger on it, all I could really tell was that the potatoes were more rich than usual. So then he told me what he thought they tasted like... CREAM CHEESE. And I tried it again, and it TOTALLY tasted like cream cheese potatoes! Props to being creative, but honestly, it tasted more like cream cheese with a dash of potatoes versus mashed potatoes with cream cheese. It was weird.

After being done with dinner, it took at least 10 minutes to get our check, where she proceeded to put it on the table and say ""have a good night"" and scurry away. I was really confused because didn't we need to pay first? So strange.

After this not-so-great meal, I ended up getting a huge stomachache. So I'd have to say that due to poor service and unappetizing food, I will have to recommend that you do not eat at this place.

The five members of our party all ordered the South Point prime rib which included a great soup or salad plus one side for $18.95. Everyone's meal was cooked and served to perfection. Several of the party had mixed drinks that were also well prepared. Although the desserts looked great and reasonably priced at $5.95, we were all simply out of room.  

Our total bill, including a generous tip came to $32.00 per person.

1505734,2012-01-24,0,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"What an underrated place!  If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, because it's just that much better than so many high priced cow places I've been to.  I'd give five stars if they were to kick up the side dishes just a notch.  Field greens and arugula in the salad instead of bagged iceberg, perhaps?  Twice baked potatoes?  Garlic smashies?   I know these niceties might add to the cost slightly but I'm willing to pay it.

Since we were staying at Southpoint, we were motivated to have dinner here.  So easy, just downstairs, and they were having a deal that was ridiculously cheap.  I don't remember the exact price but it was CHEAP!  Like, $16 for a whole dinner with all the trimmings.

We ordered the single-cut prime rib (I think it was called Southpoint cut), baked potatoes, and the house salad.  Nothing fancy, no frills.  Each item came out on a separate plate.  You people who hate for your food to touch... this place is for you!

Our prime rib was done to a turn.  Perfection.  It was perched in the middle of its own plate, atop a pool of clarified pan juices.  The waiter offered us horseradish, which we accepted.  The meat and horseradish tasted amazing.  I could tell the meat was aged and it was seasoned beautifully.

The house salad was fine; nothing special.  The waiter tossed it at our table and that was a nice touch, albeit sort of unnecessary from our point of view.

The bread was fresh and warm.  The butter had been pressed into a rose-shaped mold.

We ordered two bottles of wine:  one white Sauvignon Blanc, one red Petit Syrah.  Sorry I don't remember the variety of wineries.  But they were good.

The service was prompt and personable.  No complaints.  The atmosphere was nice too.  The restaurant is on a level above the casino floor.  So you won't hear all the racket or breathe all the smoke.  The lighting is soft, the booths are roomy, appointments and fixtures quality but not extravagant.  

I remember walking out of the restaurant, telling Gary I really enjoyed my dinner.  Looking back, yeah, I enjoyed it, especially in view of the meal we'd had the night before at Triple George.  By far, this restaurant had better food, service, wine, and atmosphere.

The best part of all this, is we left the restaurant, having had plenty of good food and wine, for well under $100, including tip!

Pilot information:  Southpoint is easy to access from Henderson Executive Airport and McCarren Int'l airport.  The hotel has a shuttle that will take you to/from either.  At least it did when we were there.  You should call and verify first, just to make sure.",iNFdV_f9qqVHze1C5upiNQ,2,0,4,HVWHp75vWcWLnwC2e1plpg

Service: Emilio and Jayme were our servers. Jayme was at our table almost immediately after we sat down to get our drink order and then brought a basket of fresh bread. Throughout the meal they were by our table multiple times to make sure there was nothing more that we needed. Our water glasses never got to even half empty before they were there to refill them. Emilio tossed our salad at table side. He also prepared our baked potato at table side. Very classy and very Old Vegas.
Food: we ordered the rodeo prime rib steak. This is a huge slab of thick cut boneless meat that was more than enough for two of us to share. It was cooked exactly as we ordered. The meat was tender and flavorful. We also got a side order of sauteed mushrooms. This proved to be a perfect additional side dish to the baked potato.

When the bread comes out at first, they give you butter that is shaped like flowers. I thought it was a cute touch. The bread was really good and fresh and warm. I opted for the salad with thousand island dressing - thought it was good with just enough sauce. I don't normally like it when they smother the salad with dressing. The boyfriend got the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup. I didn't taste it but he said he really liked it. When our meats came out (I got the southpoint cut and he got the english cut), they were already drenched in the au jous (? I don't konw how to spell this). I liked how it wasn't too salty. My friend had eaten too much horseradish was was crying LOL Be careful with it because its spicy! One word of advice is to get the baked potato and not the mashed potatoes. I got everything on the side and made the potato to my liking. Oh - the southpoint cut is one slab of meat that is not too thick and not too thin, and the english cut is like three thin slices of meat. I honestly think its a preference thing.

My friend and her parents were visiting and staying at South Point. They made dinner reservations at 8pm for 7 people. We were seated shortly after 8 at a large round table in the main dining room. We were not greeted for some time, and our server finally popped over to say he would be with us shortly. Finally after he came by, we had been seated for about 15 minutes. Drink orders were taken and we were brought warm sourdough bread with butter rosettes. Good thing, because it was almost 8:30 and I was getting hangry!

We all ordered the prime rib, many of us chose the Southpoint cut, which is a 10oz portion that comes with a salad or soup and baked or mashed potato. I chose the salad with ranch and mashed potatoes. I felt like my cut of meat was fattier than everyone else's, but it was still yummy. The potatoes were really creamy and delicious and I am glad I chose that over the standard baked potato. 

For dessert my friend ordered the raspberry tartufo and I was able to snag a few bites and that was deeelicous. It was Italian ice cream, covered in white chocolate and raspberry sauce, with whipped cream and fresh berries. I don't even care for white chocolate, but it was very good. Some other people had the carrot and raisin bundt cake with lemon cream cheese icing which looked amazing.. All in all, the food was good and I would come back for that.

Very stiff.  I went risky with my second app; the squash soup.  Not too bad, but not the best thing ever.. I just felt that it would be better than a dull salad.  Finally, the slab..

If you like steak. And you don't want to break your bank to do it, primarily prime rib. For $30 including tip, you can have the best blackened cajun prime rib I've ever had. 
I've been to the restaurant twice. The first time, they nailed it first try. A nice spinach salad to start...could use a little crunch. And pea soup to start...was okay. 
But the Steak, was the best blackened cajun roast beast I've ever been served. The meat was swimming in pure steak juice and the ends broke off like corn beef, that's how tender it was. And it had just enough fat to make sure the flavor went all the way through. When I finished the steak the first time, I literally wanted to run down stairs and smoke a cigarette in order to relive the flavors I had just had. 
The second time I went, I was craving this steak. So I forced the issue. I asked for just pink...it came out medium rare. That completely changed the taste of the meat. I didn't hesitate to send it back, but within five minutes they produced a repeat performance of the original. 
'I feel sorry for the poor guy who's steak they must have stolen in order to get me mine' 
But not really. That's how much I enjoy this Steak. 
The mashed potatoes were okay. Few lumps which I like but not enough flavor, very flat. Although, it only took a little butter to really get them back on track. 
As for service, the first time I was there, was on point. 
The second time, I almost had to chase down the server in order to fix the original mistake. 

All told, $30 including tip at a steakhouse...

We were seated by a girl who had no personality at all. Our waiter, Charles was nice enough though! We sat in a crescent shaped booth. It was comfy, but the table was leaning to one side......pity the person at the end of the table if someone spills their drink! There was also a dull rumbling from maybe the A.C. Not so annoying once you get used to it!

Now to the food.....Bread basket came with warm bread that was pretty darned good, but the butter was frozen, not chilled, but literally frozen! Even the warm bread couldn't make it spreadable. The salad, which is tossed in front of you, was average. Not too small, not too big. Per my hubby, the prime rib had no taste. The presentation was poor. Just a piece of meat thrown on a plate. There were mashed potatoes served in a bowl with an ice cream scooper. Want sour cream with your PR? Here's a spoon full, I'll just plop it down here on your bread plate. As for the burger? Worst burger I've ever had! I ordered it medium well, it wasn't. The meat and bun were dry, I do mean dry! Did I say the whole burger was dry? Yup......sure did! Came with fries.....I love fries! Not these ones! Pretty sure the oil they were fried in was old. I managed to eat half the burger, took the other half in a to go container cuz my man will eat anything if he's hungry......it's in the trash.

Sorry, this place really missed the bus on beef. I typically will give a restaurant a second chance, but I wouldn't recommend this place. Too many negatives for my liking! Find another spot to eat.",_DpPh-pN2nscXdwRnNDc1g,1,0,1,Cw5zOuwXkAI6RN3V0VbTSQ

Service: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. The waiters were professional and top notch. They made my Martini solid and piercingly cold. Food was spaced and paced adequately and they had the mandatory 3 person wait staff present for all tables. 

Food:
Wife and I had the Prime Rib, which were excellent in terms of quality and price. The Prime Rib was cooked well and came with all the accoutrements. I had my prime rib cajun style and boy oh boy... for the price I paid.. Im coming back. It wasnt a religious experience like when I converted to the church of prime rib at the Parish of Lawrys.. Amennnnnn.... but it will be a permanent place for vegas stops..

Upon entering the restaurant, it reminds me of the 'old style' Vegas look of the 80's. Dim lighting, large tables with high back chairs, plush booths, spacious layout with a romantic and intimate setting. I'm romantically inclined, what can I say!

PPR specialty is, well, prime rib, and that's just what my wife and I ordered. We start off with warm sourdough bread and Caesar salad. Our South Point thick cut of medium rare prime rib in au jus juice was generous in portion and prepared to perfection. Succulent and not fatty, served with mashed potato. Brought out to us on a cart with the plates topped with metal covers. I loved the visual effect it presented.

Our daughter ordered the home-style chicken pot pie, nice pieces of chicken breast and vegetables with a light flaky crust. Instead of salad, she opted for the lentil soup. She enjoyed her meal.

Staying at the South Point, we were given two coupon books, each had a free dessert coupon for the PPR, Yippee!  We shared the following desserts;

Peach bread pudding
White chocolate & raspberry tartufo

My gfs and I were starving after our drive back to Vegas from CA and wanted to try Primarily Prime Rib. A friend and I wanted to try the cowboy cut ( 26 oz. bone in for $29.95) but found out that there is a $10 extra plate charge so we all decided to go with the southpoint cut ($18.95). It came with your choice of prime or spinach salad OR their soup of the day AND a bake potato OR mashed potatoes OR vegetables.

You start off with a sour dough bread and some butter. I enjoyed the sour dough because it wasn't super sour and it was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

We ordered 3 southpoint cuts, 2 cooked medium and 1 cooked medium rare. I got the mashed potatoes and the spinach salad with dressing on the side. I would recommended getting dressing on the side because they did drench my friends' prime salad in thousand island dressing. I did not like the dressing that came with the spinach salad so I used balsamic vinegar but I'm sure you can swap the vinegarette out for something else. I was surprised to find out that the mashed potatoes weren't made from a box. There were actual chunks of potatoes! However, the baked potato looked a lot better and its made table side so I would recommend the baked potato. They added sour cream, butter and chives. If you want any of those on the side, make sure to let them know. All the prime rib entrees came out perfectly cooked. They were soft and not too fatty. Both of my friends enjoyed their meal. 

Service was really good. Lighting was perfect, not too bright nor too dim. The music wasn't playing super loudly either. Booths were comfortable. Its a good spot to bring a date or to celebrate something. While I have had better prime rib, for the price, service and quality, it was a good deal!

I was a little apprehensive about coming here with my dinner group since I had never been here before and the menu prices were somewhat cheap but it was recommended so I took a chance and made reservations.  

Not being a lover of prime rib I ordered the NY strip steak, medium on the inside, charred on the outside and that's exactly how it was served to me.  The steak was intensly flavored, juicy and very  tender.  I was impressed.  
 
Bertha ordered liver and onions and said it was one of the best she'd ever had, tons of onions and bacon.  
Sandy had the beef medalions with a sauce to die for and she too liked it very much.
Maureen loved her strip steak and remarked at how perfectly is was done, (medium rare).
Jeannette was the only one who ordered the prime rib although she was afraid there would be a lot of fat as most prime rib cuts can be.  Not so with this one.  We were surprised at how well it was trimmed and she commented on on well it was prepared.  

Baked potatoes all around, separate dish, loads of butter and sour cream on the side.   
The salads were fresh, crisp and ample.   My Caesar had a tad too much dressing but didn't stop me from finishing it.   Maureen raved about her blue cheese dressing so naturally we all had to dip our forks into the pitcher and give it a taste.  She was right, it was some of the best blue cheese ever with chunks of cheese.

The price for my steak was  $21.95 with soup, or salad, and potato.   A bargain I thought.    Take a look at the menu online and see for yourself how the prices range.

Service was wonderful, we never had to ask for anything; one of the two servers we had was always aware that water needed filling, wine glasses needed re-filling, plates needed to be taken away, etc.   

Ambience was very nice, somewhat quiet,  cozy and very comfortable chairs.  We lingered for over an hour after finishing dinner.

Customer service:  we arrived a little early for our reservation and were greeted warmly and told that, if available, we will be seated early and they are very happy to see us.

I enjoyed how the baked potato was prepared in front of us; this artisan approach enriched the experience nicely!

While you are indeed Primarily Prime Rib I was very impressed with the Salmon; it was moist throughout, flavorful, flaked nicely, and still felt light and not over-buttered.

I also must complement you on your cappuccino; for any true Capp drinker the foam is where it's at and yours was perfectly thick and creamy with a nice balance of boldness and smooth finish to the brew.  Well done!

The atmosphere was wonderful; it was so easy to share a conversation with friends without having to talk over others (and truly I apologize if we reversed that experience for anybody else) the waitstaff were friendly and attentive, and when I asked for recommendations and opinions I truly appreciate the open honesty I received.

The baked potato was so yummy (I know it's just a potato but it was impressive), the meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because of a little mix up towards the end of the meal where we waited quite a bit to put in the dessert order, and honestly the desserts we had (cheesecake and chocolate cake) left a lot to be desired.

It was a party of four, we made reservations for 9:30pm & came in an hour early to see if they could accommodate us earlier. Unfortunately they were still busy, but we were seated by 9:15. The atmosphere was nice, most of the tables had enough space between each other so you can have some privacy without hearing the conversation of the table next to you. We ended up getting a nice booth along the wall across from the entrance. I decided to get the English cut, with the cream of cauliflower soup & mashed potatoes. My family shared the spinach & cheese dip for the appetizer, along with the complimentary warm bread & butter. 

The spinach & cheese dip was good, small chunks of artichoke & not too thick/creamy. The cracked bread that came with it tasted similar to skyflakes crackers [to all the Filipino ppl you know this is not a bad thing! haha].

The cream of cauliflower soup did have a thick texture, & I told myself I wouldn't finish it all because I knew I wouldn't finish my steak, but I ended up cleaning my bowl. It was really tasty!

By the time I got my English cut, I was full. I was sad because I knew I wasn't going to finish it, but I did have one of the three slices in my belly :) My prime rib was good; cooked medium well, tender & flavorful. The mashed potatoes were good, I just think they added so much butter I wasn't use to it.

Service was decent, the busser got us our drinks right away & refilled our drinks just before we would finish our water/sodas.

I always made reservations and each time we arrived, we had to wait 15 mins for a table. I wouldn't mind if they had a decent place to sit and have a drink but the upstairs bar is packed with gambling addicted drunks who are slobbering all over the place. My wife, daughter and I just chose to stand in a dark corner and wait behind the other 25 people who were in line waiting for their table.

When being seated, you will appreciate the dated and crumb-laden furnishings, but a quick brush of the hand will rid your seat of most of the crumbs and other varmints! I will say that the water/drink girl was very attentive during each visit. If only they spoke a language that I was familiar with, I could have actually ordered something other than a warm casino beer! I'm not sure why a restaurant such as this hires people who don't even speak english to act as servers. They obviously cater to a lot of foreigners. If you do choose to try this restaurant and aren't fluent in multiple languages, I would suggest bringing pictures of your favorite drinks. 

 While waiting for your food to arrive, most will appreciate the opportunity to view the ""other half"" of society in their untamed habitat. You will see the most downtrodden and classless people that a casino can chew up and spit out! If there is an old, crippled, mentally disturbed or horribly disfigured person within 10 miles, you can rest assured that they will be seated at the tables all around you and complaining about everything! You can throw the dress code right out the window! If you have an old stained wife beater, dirty underwear and a pair of ratty flip flops, put them on and proudly walk through the doors in style, knowing that you will be the best dressed person in the place! If you want to see sloppy drunks spilling their drinks and yelling at the top of their lungs, this is the place for you! I have never witnessed such a ""diverse"" group like this at any other restaurant in Vegas (at least not 4 separate times!). Perhaps if the drink girl could have spoken some form of English, alcohol would have made this specticle much more tolerable!

I understand why many people give this place 5 stars; it's cheap and the prime rib is pretty good! If I had to break down my rating I would give:

Prime Rib: 4 stars
Price: 5 stars

3412119,2011-11-13,0,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"I've been here a few times. So it's time to review.

Food - I've only had the Southpoint cut medium rare with the salad. Salad is your usual bagged lettuce with usual veggies. I've had the rice pilaf which was tastey as well as the baked potato. The servers need to learn how to portion the butter and sour cream that they add to the potatos. A small potato shouldn't come with a glob of butter almost the same size as the potato... ruined it. The prime rib however has always been great. Well seasoned, not overly fatty, always cooked right. Deserts were satisfactory. Peach bread pudding is very dense. Cheesecake is run of the mill.

Service - is nothing to write home about. Our server took a while to do anything. After we were done eating we still had some wine to finish and she wanted to rush us out. We told her we were going to stay and chat while we finished our bottle and we never saw her again. It took us 25 minutes from us telling her that until we were able to get someones attention to take our credit card. Her helper/busser had ther personality of a smashed kitty. Even trying to engage in conversation with him, all we got was a blank stare. Being locals, we recognized his accent and even asked him where he was from to try to spark up convo since they weren't busy. Still just a stare. Very weird since we also work in service industry. 

Atmosphere - Very clean and tasteful. It wasn't very busy during the Saturday night 630pm dinner rush. We did have one large table of drunkerds next to us and you would think that they would sit smaller tables away from those types. Was hard to hold a decent conversation at our own table with a table of 18 drunks next to us. 

Overall, I think it is worth $15 for a full prime rib dinner. The service/management definitely needs to be worked on though.",QyyCQb7i4YHZeHLPeLfYLQ,2,0,3,aJI-SEg-OLKIw2PIZjIvew

3505131,2013-05-27,2,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"Being Memorial Day weekend, I thought it might be a good idea to make a reservation. My wife and I arrived about ten minutes before our reservation and gave our name. The woman at the front desk just looked at us, wrote something down, and started doing something else. We stood around for about five minutes before another woman came to seat us.
The dining room was dull and old. Our booth was full of crumbs and the waitress who came to bring us water didn't speak English very well. I think she was trying to take our drink order but neither my wife or I could understand her. She gave us our water and disappeared. 
Our waiter told us about the special but did not give any explanation about the meal. I heard a waiter from another table describe the special very eloquently. I had the Southpoint Prim Rib and my wife had the salmon. 
The split pea soup was pretty good. Good texture without being mushy and had just the right amount of ham and carrots. My wife like her tossed salad with bleu cheese. We were disappointed with the bread that came out before the salad. It was so hard, I had the use my steak knife to cut though the crust. The very center was ok, but WOW, it was like it had been sitting out for hours or even days. 
My wife really enjoyed her salmon but was surprised to find out that substituting veggies for potatoes was a $2 up charge. My prime rib, medium rare, was perfect. Just the right amount of fat and very tender. I was not impressed with the presentation. A piece of meat on a play and a side dish of mashed potatoes. THAT WAS IT. No garnish, no vegetables, no frills at all. 
Our food was good, better than good even, but I'm pretty sure we will no return to this restaurant because of the poor atmosphere and the lack of customer service. The prices are a plus as well.
If you have no expectations of good customer service or anything resembling ambiance, this is the place for you. Otherwise, check out any of the other scores of steakhouses in Las Vegas.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,2,1,2,QAhFPCQPWmKzSPV7lrdK_Q

3547316,2016-12-12,0,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"To start off, this place has good food. Don't let my 2 stars take that away, we do come here quite often. That is not why I'm writing this, clearly plenty of people like this establishment. However, over the weekend my family and I had reservations for 12 & a baby for my grandfathers 85th birthday. Now I understand its Rodeo week at the South Point, so everyone was here and this place happened to be busier than usual but we did have a reservation @7. When my family arrived before me, they were told no one could sit until the entire party arrived. Since we were surprising my grandfather, this made it quite hard as he could of shown up any minute. By the time I arrived, about 15 mins prior to our reservation, I stood at the host stand with my family waiting for the host, who was actually the Manager, to acknowledged me. As more people walked up, it seems she was less interested in us and still never once looked up at me or even bothered to ask if we were all there. She then walked away and a young man greeted us and took us to our table. She returned and even as I eyed her down on the way to our table, she still didn't look up. I know she saw me, reading her name tag.. poor decision on her behalf. They sat us at a round table with chairs basically forced next to each other while mind you, we also had a toddler who needed a highchair. Eventually one was brought and everyone was able to sit, tightly. I believe our server was also another Manager, who you could tell was quite overwhelmed with not only how busy they were but the fact he had to take care of our table. The vibe coming off him was pretty depressing. He didn't seem to interested in our table and seemed to want to get us ordered and out. Large parties should never just be sitting empty while waiting for dinner. Bread was brought out the second we sat down but never got refilled. Salads showed up not to long after we all ordered but then we waited another 30 mins or so for all the prime rib to show up. Which obviously 12 steaks will take time to cook, then you should time anything before the main course appropriately. When food finally did come, of course we all enjoyed it. Like I said, the food is still good. Then we were told ""don't get too full, wait till to see the desserts coming out."" Then they brought out a piece of chocolate cake, and 2 small pieces of cheesecake on a plate that said ""Happy Anniversary""... we told them of the mistake as it was clearly a Birthday with balloons and gifts and it was corrected and brought back saying ""Happy Birthday"". However for 12 people to share this small dessert, with no plates and just a fork, basically saying pass it around and each of you take a bite.. was a complete joke! Nor were we offered any more desserts to choose from, only coffee or tea. Needless to say, we were all quite disappointed with the services that night after spending 2 hours there. My father was a restaurant manager for 40 years, lived in 5 different countries working at some of the finest places and this was just sub-par service. Can't say I want to go back after that or even recommend it to anyone. Yeah sure the food is good but I can find a great Prime Rib at many other places.",G917VZT12pVqinRFdNpFlA,3,0,2,pzs4FecO0Xhf5M3DfyDXhw
3577057,2017-05-30,0,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"My wife and I went the other day and they were not too busy.  A nice plus is that there's a bar right outside the restaurant with some good drink deals and you can bring them in.  

The menu prices are very reasonable, although the $10 split plate charge is a bit high given the other prices on the menu.  I got a burger and my wife got the filet medallions.  The bread served prior to the meal was pretty good and we enjoyed the salad & split pea soup we got.  I thought my burger and fries were fantastic, but my wife did not really care for the filet.  She thought the mushrooms on top were good, although the sauce was not.  She got a separate side of mushrooms and did not care for those.  We also split the mac & cheese with shredded beef & bbq sauce in it.  The mac & cheese was totally overpowered by the bbq sauce.

So, I'd say the food was a bit above average, but the service left something to be desired.  Our server, Marija (I think?) was attentive at first, but less as the meal went on.  At one point she said our main entrees would be coming out in a couple of minutes and it was almost a 10 minute wait from that point.  Additionally, and this is my biggest pet peeve, we were finished with our food for over 10 minutes with no check.  Eventually we just got up and went to the front podium to ask for our check from the manager.  It took an additional 3 minutes to get our check at that point.  At no point did the manager or our server apologize for this.  Maybe if we had a different server this would be 3-4 stars instead.  

On top of all this, allow me to wax poetic for a second.  Why are there three steakhouses at South Point?  I can understand that there's a really high end one in Michael's, and the ""regular"" one is Silverado, but what purpose does Primarily Prime Rib serve?  They have the usual deli, coffee shop, ice cream shop, buffet, and 24-hour cafe options, plus specific restaurants for Italian, Asian, Mexican, and seafood.  Additionally they have the only Steak & Shake in Vegas.  Essentially they are totally killing the restaurant option game when it comes to non-Strip casinos in Vegas.  They really should consider moving some of the more popular menu items from the Primarily Prime Rib menu to Silverado instead and then put something even more unique in its place.   Perhaps Indian, Thai, teppanyaki, or even a gastropub.  Or, just nix it entirely and use the space for a new high limit area that's set apart from the main casino even more.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,wa8RQM9CTNcIrpUs2xgGFQ
3608064,2016-06-20,0,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"Based on reviews I was expecting a tasty experience. The atmosphere is nice for a prime rib joint and prices reasonable since soup or salad and a potato accompany the entrees. Service was friendly and attentive. The food was presented nicely, the sourdough bread basket was fresh with rosette butter pats but I was disappointed with my meals flavor. It was as though the cooks were afraid to season it. The taste of everything I had was blah. If it wasn't for the fresh peaches, dried fruit and candied pecans the spinach salad lacked flavor and acidity. It was all sweet and not enough acid to give it any dimension.  I ordered Chipotle Glazed Salmon. Yes, I could feel the heat but otherwise there was no flavor.  I rarely salt my food but tonight that salmon had no flavor profile. The lime sauce that came with it was sour cream and lime juice with diced tomatoes. The teaspoon dollop of this sauce on the salmon with four diced tomato pieces really could have been called a garnish because it didn't add anything to the dish. The photos of this salmon in the gallery showed colorful and crisp looking green and yellow squash and carrots. They must have run out of carrots tonight. My vegetables were over cooked, limp and had no flavor either. My accompanied guests enjoyed their prime rib and baked potatoes. .

I put quotes around that last item because a lot of the people in my group of 16 ordered a cocktail with dinner, only to find out after getting the check that we were charged $6 per drink. We asked our waitress about what obviously looked like a billing error and she said that those of us who had ordered an iced tea or a soda before ordering our cocktail were charged separately for our cocktails because that soda or iced tea counts as ""a cocktail"" for the menu's purpose. What the what? Since when have Pepsi and Lipton manufactured cocktails? 

Very dishonest way for Primarily Prime Rib to make more money off of a fixed-price menu. If they and the menu would've been honest upfront and said ""one beverage (alcoholic or nonalcoholic),"" there wouldn't have been any problem; some of us would've still ordered a cocktail, knowing it was going to be charged at full price.

As for the food, the spinach dip was good; the salad was salad; the turkey dinner was okay--stuffing tasted like gooey Stove Top, cranberry sauce tasted like oversweetened cranberry jelly, baked potato and mashed potatoes were good; the chocolate cake was superrich and tasty.

Our order for iced teas were taken promptly.  We were brought a basket of sliced bread and some butter.  My wife ordered the Cottage Pie with split pea soup for an appetizer.  I got the South Point cut of prime rib with a baked potato.  For my starter I got the prime salad with bleu cheese dressing.

My wife enjoyed her soup.  My salad was tossed table side on a classic style steakhouse cart.  The greens and dressing were in the wooden bowl when he pushed the cart to the table.  He mixed the dressing and greens together.  It was quite good and a server gave me some freshly ground pepper.

Our main courses arrived and my prime rib was very rare as I ordered.  My baked potato was loaded with butter and sour cream as I asked and I was given a side of creamy horseradish.  I opted not to get the blackened cajun thanks to Philip T's review.  I also don't like that the ""blackening"" process cooks the meat more than I care for.

For dessert, my wife got the tartufo, a white chocolate and raspberry dessert that consisted of a ball of raspberry sherbet surrounded by some vanilla ice cream covered with white chocolate.

However, if you ask your server, they'll usually hook up this Surf n' Turf for a small additional price.  The salmon is flaky just how I like it and not fishy at all.

4180382,2010-05-07,1,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"This restaurant was interesting, the menu was kind of off the wall. I get the prime rib thing, which is fine, but then you have chicken & dumplings as an entree? They really need to tweak the menu and give it some of kind of theme, it's just all over the place right now and confuses the customers.

I had the prime rib, it was great. Cooked to a perfect medium rare just like I asked, it was swimming in a pool of au jus which was kind of messy, I like it better when I can dip it myself. The rice pilaf was disgusting, had too much rosemary or something, it wasn't very good at all and I barely touched it. I had the split pea soup which was good, thick but good.

The service was a little awkward, our waitress was a space cadet. She kept telling us someone stole her peppermill and took 5 mins to go hunt it down, she was a weirdo.

So all in all, if you go there to eat prime rib, you will be happy, but the side dishes need major help and if someone doesn't like prime rib, they won't be able to eat with you, since the menu is so funky my friend ordered 2 appetizers cause she didn't like the other entrees, and ended up not eating either one because it wasn't very good. It's OK though, she stuffed her face with the Chocolate Fudge Cake for dessert.",B0ENvYKQdNNr1Izd2r-BAA,0,0,3,KoRrERHfMljEGBeKGyRuRQ

I have to say that everything from the taste of their ranch dressing to the bread to the double cut bone in thick prime rib itself was absolutely great..  this prime rib had FLAVOR. 

The service was fine.. we had Boris, and he was very accommodating, didn't make us feel like we had to rush or anything. hand mixed our salad. 

I guess the only thing that I can complain about is the mashed potatoes looked like a sculpture.. kind of like if they were sitting out forever and then when ordered brought to the table. there were also huge chunks of potato in there that I had to eat around, if you like brown gravy with your mashed , order the demi glaze with them. they don't have brown gravy but the demi glaze works perfectly with them instead.

I will be back to this restaurant, thanks so much for making up for Lawry's",-Ng6kNjzZee-hT-RZYg_Eg,2,0,4,ALEWToysFJ2Ldaso0m_ODQ

With your prime rib order, you can choose between soup or salad. I got the salad and my friend got the soup of the day which some sort of creamy chicken based soup that I don't exactly remember the name of. The salad was average. I wouldn't say it was the freshest of salad as it looked like they literally opened a bag of lettuce from the local Smiths and let it sit on the counter for a few hours till the edges were slightly browned. The soup was a much better option in my opinion. We both also got the mashed potatoes with our prime rib, but our waitress almost walked away without giving us our mashed potatoes until I asked her if those were for our meal. 

The prime rib itself was cooked well, and the au jus was flavorful. It wasn't too salty either. It's a good choice if you're craving prime rib and need to get your fix in.

The decor itself is pretty depressing. It looks like it must have been very popular in the 90s going into the mid 2000s just like the rest of the hotel/casino. With the dim lighting, I could barely read the menu let alone tell you what color the carpet is.

TLDR- well priced, but you get what you paid for in terms of service and quality. I feel like it's trying to be more upscale without hitting the mark.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,4,1,3,uPj15AbDqJH4-Wr9_XZC0w

Sure, this place is in a casino 10 mins south of the strip, but it's worth the trek. Good service all around. The sides to the prime ribs are a bit too old school tho.

Dinner came with soup or salad, baked or mashed potatoes, or julienne vegetables.
Salads were tossed table side, chopped fresh greens, tomatoes, corn, cheddar cheese, red onions and choice of dressing.
Also, we had some bread with butter while we were waiting for our dinner.

I didn't see the point where I could wait another 20 minutes for my meal. I was hungry! I ate all of it!

The service is great and you should make a reservation just to be safe. I ordered the cowboy cut because it's the biggest. It came with a big bone too. Not sure if that was part of the ounces. I could've eaten the whole thing. I believe it came with a big potato and a salad or soup. I chose the clam chowder. The chowder had good amount of clams in it but I still think progresso soup tastes better. It's not SF Wharf clam chowder in a bread bowl quality.

I was disappointed with the beef. Maybe charred Cajun would've been better. It really wasn't that tasty. It could've used a bit more salt and peppercorns or something.

The prime rib was cooked properly but it had some gristle that you did into halfway into the cut. That was just a turn off for me.

Not only did I check their menu online, but I called the restaurant and asked about gluten free items.  The manager on duty carefully explained all the steps they would take to insure my food needs were met.

So we get to the restaurant and I asked for the gluten free (GF) menu.  It was very extensive and included starters, meats and even dessert!  But it's what happened afterwards that really impressed me.

Our server's knowledge about the do's and don'ts associated with a GF meal was fantastic.  When ordering the salad, I asked about a different dressing - he went in the back and checked and recommended that I not order the one I asked about due to uncertainty.  No problem, there were others I liked as much.  When my salad came, it was, of course, without croutons and most of all - it was covered to prevent any cross-contamination.

My prime rib was fantastic and surprise - it came with its own GF horseradish sauce!

4981362,2014-08-15,5,iUg-giEl5nINQoc6yau5yQ,"A reservation snafu at my FIL's timeshare and we were booted out a day early.  A day early for OUR plans at least.  So we were without a room and needed a place to stay one more night.  Luckily my BIL hopped into high gear and got us a totally smoking deal at South Point Casino and Spa.

We felt like we lucked out because now we didn't have to go out to have dinner.  We could have a more relaxing evening than if we had stayed at the timeshare because the timeshare doesn't have a real restaurant.  That day we hiked and enjoyed the unseasonable weather, then headed back to the hotel for some relaxation, drinks and eventually dinner.  After some in room cocktails we chose to figure out where we would eat when we got down to the main floor.

On our way down in the elevator we ran into a bellhop and we asked him where we should eat.   All of us were a little inebriated and didn't actually notice his hesitance to give us a suggestion.  And it was telling when his suggestion was....don't eat at the Mexican place.  Our tipsy selves said No Problem!!  And headed to this prime rib place.

Darn.  I wish I had noticed his pause because I can now assume his pause meant his mind racing through the thought.  ""I can't tell them NOT to eat in the hotel because that's not good for my job....but hell I don't like eating here!""

Anyway the meal was meh...and for being reasonably priced that makes it even more of a disappointment.  I was really hoping to get a better product and be able to rave about the place when I got home.  Instead all I can say is that everything was overcooked by at least 2 levels.  The steak was ordered black and blue and it came out black and brown, the prime rib was brown and dry.  In fact the steak was so bleh that my BIL had to ask for A1.   I know I know, no A1 at a nice steakhouse.  But it needed something.  So when the saucer was brought back and deftly set on the table with something like...""There is your A1 sir!"", The second important pause of the night happened.  The table just took a second to process what we had heard and my BIL said...""Well!  Definitely not going to use THAT on my steak.""

We were probably all being paranoid and he probably was just trying his best not to sneer at A1 as a condiment.  But it was strange how we all got the same vibe from him.

As we walked out we knew we would never be back....even if we worked as a Bellhop at South Point.",LkXNQQaIc5yrKu9Ap87RrA,4,3,2,z_F932Y3rN4NEkPGp5pv7Q

Located on the second floor, we were greeted at the front of the empty restaurant and were quickly seated in the gray booth along the wall. The inside of the restaurant is quite intimate- perfect for a date or anniversary dinner. We were attended and  served quite quickly. I looked on Yelp for ideas on what to order and I ordered the south point prime rib. It was good and only $19.99. Alcoholic drinks are only $8.

I ended up with their orchard salad that has apples/peaches/candied pecans, south cut roast prime rib with mashed potatoes, and spice grilled pineapple on toasted pound cake with vanilla ice cream. I also got their malibu splash cocktail! Malibu rum, cranberry juice, and sprite. It was very light on the alcohol compared to their other drinks.

I guess everything was just ""okay"" to me. The salad was good and was a nice refreshing start. The prime rib was too tough for my liking. Actually, half of it was tough and the other half was just okay. It took more chewing than it did when we make our own steaks. Even with all the au jus they use, it seemed almost dry at some points. The pound cake on the dessert was more like a dense and tough cookie than a cake. 

Overall, the most enjoyable thing on that menu was probably the mashed potatoes. I'm probably not going to return. I don't mind paying a bit more for better quality. I guess if this set was $30, I could pay $20ish more and dine at Lawrys.

===Service===

Our waitress started out perfectly. She was very informative and polite. As we were finishing up our meal she stopped by to refill a water. As she was putting it back down she knocked it over onto someone's lap. She ran to the back to get a couple more napkins, but as she returned, she was more worried about the water on the table then on the persons lap. Wait, what?? She gave an insincere apology and walked off. As we brought it up with her later she just shrugged and said, ""don't worry, it's just water so it will dry"". She was just unbelievable... 

===Food===

Cowboy cut: Succulent prime rib at an extremely reasonable price? Yes please! It was absolutely delicious. The cowboy cut is almost double the size of the regular cut. I highly suggest this if you are hungry and want a nice, juicy piece of meat. 

Beef stroganoff: Tenderloin tips in a rich sauce. This dish was good, but I felt like it was a bit salty for my liking. 

The food here was delicious and even though our waitress was terrible, I felt like the quality of the food for the price was worth 4 stars. I highly recommend the prime rib, but if you don't want beef they also serve some chicken and fish dishes. The only downside is South Point is pretty far south of the strip, but it can be worth it if you want a good dinner at a reasonable price!",QIy3iLXjBUBqRzwd2lnWGQ,2,0,4,VihiGRns_K14k6xbzg-0Vw

The setup primarily felt like something straight outta the 50s.  The music was also primarily weird.  It was like someone hit the demo button on a Casio keyboard or something.  

Waitress was nice.  My wife got the Southpoint cut and I got the blackend/Cajun cut.  Both cuts were better than buffet cuts..leaner and thicker but I preferred her cut over mine..primarily due to the blahness of the spice/flavor on the cajun cut.  I ended up scraping off the spice off my cut.  Our entrees came with salad which consisted primarily of lettuce and a side.  My wife got the rice pilaf which wasn't very good and I got a dry baked potato.  We were too full for dessert primarily due to the serving portion of the prime rib.

The restaurant is located upstairs, next door to a Mexican restaurant and also near a small bar (which I never knew was there - you learn something new every day!).  We did not have a reservation, and the hostess was very friendly and was able to seat us immediately.

The restaurant was larger than I expected, but not huge.  It is dimly lit, with booths surrounding the outer edge and tables inside, with booths on the inner edge as well.  

It only took us 2 seconds to decide what we wanted to order, so when our server came to take our drink order, we advised him that we were ready to order our food as well.  We both ordered the same cut of meat - the South Point cut.  It is $15.99 and comes with a choice of soup or salad and choice of mashed potato, baked potato or rice pilaf.

My salad (and my Mom's soup) came out quickly.  The best part about the service is that everything is brought out on a cart.  The salad was tossed table side, which I thought was a nice touch.  My Mom's soup was split pea and was REALLY good.  It was creamy and smooth and super delicious.  The bread basket was nothing to write home about, but who cares?!

There was not much of a delay between our salad and entree, which was good.  Once again, our dishes were brought out on a cart.  I like that the meat is served on it's own plate, swimming in the au jus, rather than serving a seperate cup.  I had the rice pilaf, which I thought was really good.  It wasn't dry and was seasoned really well.  My meat was medium rare and just bloody enough, and was very juicy.  My Mom had a baked potato, which they prepared tableside.  I thought that was a really nice touch.

It took us quite awhile to get our check, but other than that, it was a great meal.  We were really impressed by the tableside service and rolling carts and the overall quality of the meal.  I will definitely be back.  Including tip, it was just about $40 for our meal.  Considering all that we got, the ambiance and the amazing service, I think that is a steal!

Cooked perfectly and just cut. The service was good and wanted to thank Kyle and Todd for their attentiveness. My mouth is beginning to water just thinking of the great piece of prime rib we had. 

The restaurant was nice, but honestly I was hungry and could care less what it looked like. When my dad comes to town this is going to be one of the first places we go!!",lG6kP4x-u5E2cGohgxFcdA,0,0,5,GT_PYbveV84zPmrkPhg2ig

Prime Rib was tasty, cooked perfectly and not overly fatty (I've had it in some restaurants where 1/2 the slab is fat). Also had the green beans, mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and baked potato between myself and my husband and all were very good. We had the chocolate cake and peach bread pudding for desert - both were very good. I will say the atmosphere felt a little old fashioned for our taste but we will definitely be eating here again.",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,5,T-OpAM-E8MacJ2KGlRkQvA

He tried the New York steak and found it just right, cooked perfectly. I had not had prime rib for a long time and decided to give it a try. It was delicious. I had the most popular cut. I liked sitting in the curved booth. The wine of the month was a Cabernet from the Columbia valley and complimented the beef nicely. The bread was a sourdough with a great texture, nice and crusty. Perfect with the white bean soup of the day. Service was outstanding. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I hope the rest of my trip is as satisfying.",iKMSkHTaJOl35Gfz53XjZg,1,0,5,RB1fW_MyvBcT2PPgTSkjVw
