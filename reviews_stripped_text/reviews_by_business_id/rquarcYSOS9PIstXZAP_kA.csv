The decoration of the restaurant is cool and it has that ""skateboarders at the beach"" southern cali feel to it. They have a wide variety of food there but like any spot  I go to that serve Mexican food I gauge the food by how good the carne asada tacos are and I must say that although they are a little bit pricier than what I am normally used to paying, they were very good! The meat was flavorful and juicy. The setup is similar to Chipotle or Zaba's were you pick what kind of filling you want. I went with the simple ""authentic"" onions, cilantro and salsa. The guy who was making the tacos was like ""is that all??? no lettuce or cheese?"". I know that most people who like to eat more Americanized tacos like to have lettuce and cheese and all that but no self respecting authentic Mexican food lover like myself would do that to a taco. I can see how that would justify the $3 each asking price though if you get one of those ""super duper supreme look i got all this stuff in my taco"" kinda tacos so I'm not knocking them on that. The other thing I got was the chicken flautas which actually were really good although I think they were frozen and not fresh. If I go back, I will have to try the enchiladas cause I love me some enchiladas too.

Oh and the staff is really nice and friendly too. I wasnt able to find a lid for my drink and one of the girls notice me walking back and forth lookin for them. She apologized and ran in the back to get some more and said that next time to tell them right away and they will give me a bigger drink for free! Pretty cool if you ask me!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,1,2,3,Aa64rKA48vGAJG9OI9tYNw

The food is okay. I had an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco, and I tried a few bites of my wife's chicken burrito. It was all just okay - can't say anything bad, but not really anything good to say either. I'd honestly rather hit Taco Bell, and I can think of 10 Mexican restaurants/taco shops in Vegas I would rather go to.

The staff was friendly, but a little unorganized. We were one of 3 other parties in the place and it kind of took awhile to get the food. Maybe the staff was new or something.

I get the whole graffiti thing and trying an alternative casual look, but it's a little over the top. Sharpie marker written all over the walls, rails, seats, and everything else that seems to be written mostly by teenagers wanting to be hard-core by dropping an F-bomb via permanent marker.

The only way to get there from my side on town - the SW - is to risk your life via several roundabouts. I'm a skilled driver, but I despise those things. We made it in one piece without incident, phew.

Now give me food to calm myself.

Not able to decide on what I wanted, I ordered three tacos: fish, carnitas and carne asada. My brother tried the chicken and carne asada. We were the only people in the restaurant and the staff seemed highly annoyed by our presence. 

I grabbed a diet coke from the soda machine and it tasted terrible, flat yet it tasted only like seltzer. I couldn't drink it. I don't do regular soda so I was out of luck.

I dug into the tacos. The fish taco wasn't the worst I've had, but I wouldn't call it good. Edible. The Carnitas were the best of three. The carne asada was so salty. I about died. It was inedible. My brother agreed on the carne and thought the chicken was decent. 

I couldn't believe I risked my life on the roundabout deathtraps for this! Leaving, I was forced to gamble again. A few close calls, but we made it home safely. Thank goodness, I would not want Chronic Tacos for a last meal.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,0,2,9wo36YIRugcru3P62nZnXg

Places like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Qdoba have similar recipes, but the there are some difference that make Chronic Tacos stand out:

Spanish red rice-- Chipotle doesn't have different choices for rice, Zaba's has brown rice, and Qdoba doesn't have a variance in their rices. But Chronic has Spanish rice! :)

Carnitas-- marinated pulled pork! It has a sweet taste to it that I haven't tasted before!

Flautas-- deep fried taquitos! Ask for Baja sauce and enjoy!

It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, ""I want that.""  Very stoner.

I've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.

The carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.

They have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.

Both were the size of my dog. Both burritos were really good. I'd describe them as halfway between Chipotle and actual Mexican food.

From the door I thought I was going to be in heaven considering it was so packed and the menu was awesome with burritos, tacos, and tortas and they had pastor and carnitas, in the end I was let down.  I got a steak burrito and a pastor taco.

First the burrito was priced ok at 6 bones and it was a buck more for guac, not bad.  The carne asada was not good, like really finely chopped up meat stewing in taco sauce that tasted like something made from a package of taco seasoning mix, and it didn't have a good steak texture.  To be honest it really reminded me of crappy taco meat.  The rice tasted bland and the refried beans tasted canned to me.  It wasn't too big either, chipotle or cafe rio is way bigger for the price.  Also the tortillas weren't really good, not going to put it into words why I didn't like them but rio has some awesome tortillas and this place didn't.  It absolutely tasted like some one made mexican night at there house with taco meat, rice a roni spanish rice, canned beans, and mission tortillas. 

The pastor in the taco had good flavor for sure but it wasn't that meaty and was mushy in texture, one taco was 3 bucks and it was a little skimpy too, nothing memorable and except for the pork it had that same ""generic"" flavor as the burrito.

Now the service was extremely friendly and what looked like the owner came by and asked how everything was and was real nice too.  I did have to wait a while but I saw the line so no negative thing about that.  I have waited a long time for slider truck and it's delicious so no big deal, what do you expect when a place is slammed. 

My advice for anyone who cares or is listening, better seasoning of the rice and beans (home made if it isn't), and grill up some real carne asada.  The portions aren't as big as rio or chipotle, the quality isn't as good as rio or chipotle, and it isn't cheaper than rio or chipotle, something isn't adding up.

YES!

The second I walked into this place I was blown away.  Tucked away in the middle of Summerlin is a place called ""Chronic Tacos"" that breathes new life into this other wise sterile shopping center.

First impression of the place that hasn't been open a week... what is all this writing on the wall? Did all this writing happen in less than a week?

They supply the sharpies and you are welcomed to write on the walls and tables.

They have an employee come up to you when you first hit the line and they get you a drink while you wait on what seems to be the honor system.

They carry coke products and I opted for the safe choice of Minute Maid Lemonade.

I came at 8:30pm at night and this place was still busy!  The music was blaring, the line was friendly, the staff was friendly, the entire place was like entering your cool friends house in high school.  

When my turn came up, I opted for the Carne Asada Burrito which I had made with: spanish rice, black beans, ""baja style"" sauce, pico de gallo salsa, cheese, cilantro and onions.  My meal with the burrito and the drink came out to under $9.

Let me tell you, all the staff are super friendly and I have never seen a group of people that appear to absolutely love their jobs!  A very refreshing experience.

After we sat down to eat, we were greeted by 5 different people that offered to refill your drinks or take away your trash.

I am definitely coming back to this place very soon!

(1) they will mix up the orders and try to put other people's burritos with yours so that when you get up to the register, there are magically three burritos they want to charge you for, or 
(2) ask what you want on your nachos when you ordered a quesadilla and you have to tell them multiple times that those nachos aren't yours but that quesadilla that somehow got pushed to the back of the assembly line is.

I also don't like how you have to pay extra for chips and salsa, yet they don't have a slasa bar.  You have to ask the crazed assembly line people for salsa and good luck if you need more salsa, because you won't be able to get back up there without standing in line again.

And then the decor...they encourage you to write all over the walls, booths, napkin dispensers, and even in the bathrooms.  Just gives the whole place a dirty, cheap vibe.  ""Come to Chronic Tacos and be the hoodlum you've always wanted to be!  Draw a penis on the wall if you want!!""

I tried, I really did, but I just can't find love for this place.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,1,0,2,KnkCiWoNj-S__giFExMl8Q

I workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next to Chronic Tacos and came out to find Chronic Tacos flyers on the cars in the parking lot, including mine (see pics).  That's lame, taking to sleazy nightclub tactics to promote the business....blech!  One more reason not to go there for me.

***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
I passed by this place yesterday after having lunch at Upper Crust Pizza....it was very busy and looked cool, so I said I would try it the next day.

Well....I stopped by for lunch after a workout at the gym.  It was 12:15 pm and there was a big line of about 20 people.  I decided to wait it out and see what everyone was waiting for.  While I was in line, it grew to about 30 people.

The place is decorated like a teenager's bedroom.  The walls are made of plywood and you are encouraged to tag up the walls with whatever (see pics).  I think the owners are MMA fans because there were MMA magazines all over the place and the guy who brought out my food had a MMA T-Shirt & hat.

Food - I was going to try a Carne Asada burrito, but I wanted to try 2 dishes, so i opted for the Nachos (no meat) and a Carne Asada Fatty Taco.  It's a typical setup like you find at Qdoba/Zaba's/Chipotle where you order your food and you move down a line of people to add the toppings.

The Carne Asada Taco ordering process went smoothly, but the Nachos didn't....they forgot to make it as they rely on someone in the back who's not part of the assembly line to make it.  They yell out the order and I guess someone is suppose to pay attention and make it....well, they didn't.  No big deal at this point, it's only Nachos and it doesn't take a long time to make those....so, they told me when I paid that they would bring it out.

I had a pretty good workout and built up a huge appetite, so I scarfed down the Carne Asada Taco while I waited for the Nachos.....it was pretty good, not great but good....nice flavor but it wasn't ""authentic"".  i guess growing up in SoCal makes you a Mexi-Snob when it comes to Mexican Food.

After a few minutes my Nachos came out....I was surprised to see that there was only cheese on top of chips.  Normally at Baja Fresh/Qdoba/Chipotle/Zaba's nachos are fully loaded with all the toppings....hell, I even paid extra for guacamole.  I asked the guy who brought them about it, he apologized about the guac and said he would come back with a cup of it....but he said that's how the Nachos with no meat are prepared, with just cheese.  What a disappointment!

To make matters worse, the cheese is shredded cheese that they melt on top of the chips....that in and of itself isn't that big a deal....what was really a big deal is that the cheese wasn't fully melted, just the top of it so it didn't stick to the chips and it fell all over the place because it was still cold and shredded underneath (see pics for details).  The guacamole was bland too.  I still ate it because I was hungry.  What a bad meal....I should have went somewhere else.

The place was crowded and the majority of the people in there were younger (early 20's and teens)....I guess they like the atmosphere.  Since I don't follow MMA at all, it didn't appeal to me.....and the years of writing crap on the walls are decades behind me.

I would have rated the place 2 Stars if the line was shorter...but because the hype was built up and it didn't deliver, I gave it 1 Star.  It's the 1st 1 Star joint I've rated.

Will I return?  Nah.....unless someone else was paying the bill.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,5,1,1,iZgcrU6lPzCYAv6uFNuqZA

Actually, the chicken burrito was pretty tasty once I put Tapatio on it.  But the baja fish taco was a bit underwhelming.  Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though.

4120414,2011-08-09,1,rquarcYSOS9PIstXZAP_kA,"Please stop referring to this place as a ""California"" taco shop, the only thing Cali about this place is it's reference to a certain drug in it's name.  The place looks like a tatoo parlor, nothing ""surfer"" about it.  The food was just eh and they do not even have a salsa bar.  NO self-respecting real mexican joint goes without a salsa bar. 

I ordered the beef flautas and a cheese quesadilla.  This is comman fare in any mexican stand.  The flautas were actually very good, generous amounts of meat in them and happily not over cooked.  They were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.. but not very flavorful, you definitely need guacamole or salsa with them.  The quesadilla was a flop.  Their first attempt at my quesadilla resulted in one that was so over cooked that the line cook could not cut it with his knife.  He had to saw into it and he ACTUALLY thought he was going to serve this to me.  I looked at the cashier and said, ""don't you think that's over done"".  She immediately told the cook to make another one.  Take two - this time the cashier stood over the grill and cut it up herself for me.  I think the problem here is they are making the quesadilla's in a panini grill and it toughens the tortilla before the cheese melts fully.  Any decent cook knows to make them on the grill and flip them, this way the tortilla doesn't have a chance to dry out and the cheese has time to melt.

I'll wait to go back to San Diego and have real mexican food rather than go back to this place.

NOT TO FORGET:  A plain cheese quesadilla is 5 bucks, WTF?",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,0,0,2,cE8xHQt0EjdOBpwcws5IEg
4227537,2011-02-28,0,rquarcYSOS9PIstXZAP_kA,"Chronic Tacos.....is pretty delicious. I decided to go with the Chicken Taco and a Carne Asada Taco...while making it a meal. They have two options a combo with a drink and salsa with chips or a meal with chips and salsa, beans, rice and a drink. The wait time was a lil long for a ""fast food"" type of joint, but it was worth the wait. The fiancé ordered the Chicken Burrito and that thing was huge! The chicken was definitely moist and tasty, my favorite out of the two. The lime rice was awesome and the mild salsa was a tad bit spicier than what I think a mild salsa should be, but I am a wimp when it comes to spiciness. Overall, I think this might be a place to go to for some yummy tacos and I definitely will be back to try more tacos!

She said its on their ""secret menu"" so I got an order of those.

My friend said his enchiladas were good. My sons taquitos were also very very good and he loved the chips and salsa. I tried my potato tacos and I was like YAY! They were super delish!

I think the fish tacos are much better here then Rubio's but the Shrimp taco impressed me the most ! I was expecting it to be made of popcorn shrimp but they were good sized shrimps for the money you pay. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito he said it was better then Robertos....I was like, ""Are you sure""? The reason I questioned him on that is because Roberto's is our ""go to place""  for So Cal comfort food . He said that he liked that their burrito didn't have a lot of meat fat (he hates meat fat) and it just overall tasted better. If you don't like beans or rice in your burrito make sure you tell them you want it on the side. We also ordered the guacamole and chips which I wasn't a fan of. I don't think they give you a lot of Guacamole compared to how many chips and it wasn't spicy enough for me. I liked their drink selection which had sodas, teas and Orange Whip ... it's like an Orange Julius.

4539270,2011-07-17,0,rquarcYSOS9PIstXZAP_kA,"I'd heard pretty mixed things about it from people I know, but the reviews on here are positive for the most part. I went there last week and found the food to be just OK. I got the beer-battered fish taco and and a carne asada taco. The fish taco had a good-sized piece of fish on it, but it really had no flavor. It was pretty much a giant fish stick on a tortilla. I'm not even a huge fan of fish, but this seriously had no fish flavor to it at all. The carne asada seemed a bit more like big chunks of ground beef sitting in juice. The flavor was good, but not really what I've come to expect from carne asada. The tortillas were good and the toppings and sauce on the tacos had a nice taste. 

The last part I took issue with were the chips: All I could smell when they were anywhere near my face was the grease that they were fried in. I like fried foods as much as the next person, but the oil smell was so overpowering I couldn't eat more than a few chips.

The best part of this place - and what sets it apart from any other place I've ever been - is that they have Gringo Bandito hot sauce on the tables. If you don't know what that is and you like hot sauce, you really need to check it out. It's such a flavorful sauce and goes well on pretty much anything. Well done, Chronic Taco staff, for having great taste in hot sauce.

I might come back to try some more things if I'm in the area or some friends want to check it out, but I don't think I'll be making a special trip by myself.",yQSb5pj4tXzslWlgysqhzw,1,1,3,bBmw_4lfwINMrauSVcRE4w

Flour tortillas and ground beef? No thank you, sir. So Chronic Taco reminds me of those taco shops that weren't that good, but you went because you were desperate and broke. And they always left you with belly full of grease. That's what Chronic reminds me of. 

Behind the faux-cool interior decor that includes graffiti tagged walls, Chronic cannot serve decent food consistently. I work nearby, so I know what's up. I think. At times, the food is good. But the next day can be downright gross. Their chicken tacos left me nauseated. I like their vegetarian and potato taco the best. The potato taco is probably the most interesting item in my opinion, it's like a mashed potato taco that is deep fried. Blasphemy right? It's actually tasty (in moderation, of course!) .
