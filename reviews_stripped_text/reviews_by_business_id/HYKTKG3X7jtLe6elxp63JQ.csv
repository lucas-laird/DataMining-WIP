After 25 years finally a place in Las Vegas that has absolutely the freshest, flaky, flavorful fish. Absolutely the best Fish & Chips I've had in years. This will definitely be my go-to place probably at least once or twice a  week. I can't wait to try everthing on the menu. The place is clean & and the Owner/Chef Dan has a passion for high quality.

125365,2016-12-05,1,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"I can't find anything to complain about.  I went to eat here with my kids and they are picky eaters.  They hate seafood but for some reason they like fish and chips.  I read the reviews going into Off the Hook so I was mindful of some of the negative comments. 

We ate the Family basket of Fish and Chips.  The fish tasted clean and I agree with the management rebuttal about lack of taste. Cod should be clean and fresh tasting.  It's not like Salmon that has a more flavorful taste. The condiments were good at adding flavor to the Cod.  The Coleslaw was not overbearing, not the most flavorful but again, tasted clean and fresh.  I can handle that.   

The family basket came with hush puppies, maybe a little overlooked, but not enough to deduct a star because they still tasted great.  I dipped the fish and hush puppies in a tangy orange colored type sauce that's probably got ketchup, mayonnaise and some seasoning mixed in. That was really good.  The fries were cooked right, not over cooked, not soggy and not undercooked. 

My kids like this place and so did I.  Like I said, they are picky.  As far as the price, almost $30 for the family basket not including drinks. Not cheap but not too expensive.  You go to any bar in town and Fish and Chips is easily $10/person.  So Off the Hook was about the same.  I would definitely come here again.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,0,0,5,XKvk2nr5yJjUeN9BjlS47g

I've tried Nine Fine Irishmen (NYNY), RiRa (Mandalay Bay), McMullan and Crown & Anchor.  Off the Hook is hands down the best (a 8 out of 10)!  Nine Fine Irishmen is not bad (7 out of 10), and you can forget the rest (probably better off buying the frozen fish from the grocery store and oven bake them yourself).

The fish at Off the Hook is super tender & moist on the inside but very nice and crispy on the outside in a light batter.  Exactly the way it should be done.

If you're a serious fan of British-style fish & chips, do yourself a favor and check out this neighborhood joint.  I'm certainly glad I did today...finally found myself some awesome fish & chips here in Sin City.",oGBOgwbslHQGCImmCULP3A,0,2,5,DHlReu1dHAZ1Y-vpWbBK3Q

336667,2015-12-02,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"There are three things that bothered me about my visit to this restaurant, and two things that I enjoyed.

*  I purchased a Groupon and when I got there, I found out there were restrictions on what I could order.  I went back and checked, and it was clearly stated on the Groupon, yet I was still annoyed.  I wasn't allowed to order the shrimp or scallops.  That made no sense to me.  Why are they limiting my selections?  

*   This place is a fast food joint, yet they are trying to force table service into a facility that clearly isn't designed for it.  It just seems silly that I can't order my food at the counter and take my tray back to my table.  But okay, if you want to have a server come to my table and take my order, then spruce things up.  Put in real tables, not the Burger King things that are there.  Don't serve me food in plastic baskets.  Don't give me plastic knives and forks.  

*   The prices are outrageous.  It's a fish fry.  Two pieces of fried cod, french fries, cole slaw, and a pop are going to run you seventeen dollars.  Everything is expensive on the menu.  For the prices they charge, I expect a lot better ambiance and presentation.  

*   Our server was nice.  Charlotte, I believe was her name.  She seemed invested in making us have a positive experience, so that was welcomed.

*   The food was somewhere between good and excellent.  The fries were nothing special but fine.  The cole slaw was above average.  The fried cod was perfectly cooked - flaky and moist.  The batter was just okay for me.  After a conversation, I was allowed to order the blackened shrimp appetizer and it was outstanding.  The tartar sauce, also, was very impressive.  It was thinner than one would normally see with nice lemon notes to it.  A far cry from your typical mayonnaise mixed with pickle relish.  

I wouldn't be against returning because the food is good.  However, I can't bring myself to pay these kind of prices when I can get the same type of food at Long John Silver's for a fraction of the cost.  Not as good - no doubt.  But it's fried fish.  I find it difficult to get too snobby about any food you batter and throw in hot oil.",7jFoW90fQ4zR_3Dkz2W4nw,0,0,3,H4bJnHD1dUQB-2sVyyQGTg

Anyhow, to the food.....I had the combo, one piece cod, 3 scallops, 2 huge fresh shrimp. ($15.00)

The shrimp were honestly some of the best I have had in Vegas; very good size, fresh and scrumptious.
The cod was just OK, had better, had worse, homemade sauce that was ranch dressing based.  
Afterwards he told me he had another sauce option, I am a hard core tarter sauce person, ranch doesn't get it.

The scallops were a waste of money, barely quarter sized and bland....

The cole slaw was OK, not special, fries decent.

My wife had the fish tacos,($9.00) the 3 tacos were very good although small.
 They had  a slightly sweet chili sauce mix, cabbage, pico, avocodo. 

I was a small business operator, and realize how tuff it is too make a go of it. 
 
He has been open barely 3 months and paying his dues in the business world, I hope it works out for him.

His  seafood prices are very high compared to a larger operation, probably due to his low volume.
He is still tweaking his menu and offerings.

797907,2017-06-09,1,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"Arguably the best fish n chips I've had. I ordered the large because I came in with an appetite, and I was planning on letting my aunt have a bite of my food anyway. (Large comes with 4pc of fish, chips, and a side of their homemade Cole slaw +tartar sauce)

I expected each piece of fish to be average sized (every other place I've been to have had similar sized pieces) but these came out scorching hot, and each piece was the size of a toddler's arm! They don't over-cook their fish like some places, so every piece was perfectly crispy on the outside and flakey/ JUST cooked through on the inside. Not dry at all! After pummeling through 3/4 of the chips and 2 toddler-arm sized pieces of fish, I was stuffed and satisfied. 

I also have to commend them on their tartar sauce and Cole slaw. The tartar sauce is thick and on point. The Cole slaw actually has good flavor, and is pickled enough unlike most other slaws that just come out tasting kind of like bland, wet cabbage. 

Overall 5 stars for quality of good, as well as service. Definitely recommend.",i3vl5hdpZE4ESDjQp-9Tog,3,0,5,Mw8CTj11PKithNFuwSm2UQ

The Fish is fresh and delicious!  I've seen reviews stating the fish batter was bland; I beg to differ!  It was just enough to compliment the fish and allows you to get a delicious crunchy bite. The chips were cooked perfectly. The coleslaw was yummy, my only suggestion would be some celery seed to add the additional kick of flavor.  You can taste the passion that comes from the kitchen. 

The woman behind the counter was very kind. The positive attitude from those working gives yet another reason to come out and support them.

875395,2015-06-25,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"I'm a long time lurker of yelp.  I've used it 100s of times when traveling to find top restaurants in unfamiliar cities.  I have never left a review before.  Usually the good places have plenty of reviews so adding one more doesn't seem necessary. 

Off the Hook was so good that it got me out of my normal lethargy.

I'm a self proclaimed  fish n chip expert.  I've tried it in countless restaurants throughout the US, through Asia, Europe, (Brits are everywhere!), and around 20 renowned places throughout the United Kingdom.

Off the Hook is one of the top 5 Fish and Chips places I've ever been to.  It's truly excellent.  I can't believe that such a great place is hidden away in the desert.  

The fish is excellent quality cod and has a good flake to it.  The breading is close to perfect.  It's light but has the perfect crunch without being greasy.

The chips are more American style than English, so a visiting Belt might quibble with this aspect.  To an American though these fries will be much more pleasing.  They're close but not quite as good as 5 guys fries, for the east coasters reading this, which to me are the pinnacle of American fries.

I can't recommend this place enough. My first thought was that a bit pricey but I quickly discarded thought after my first bite.  Its worth every penny.  If this guy was on the Strip he could be charging double and it would be considered one of the  great Strip food deals.

To top it off, the owner/cook was a super nice guy. 

If you're a local and don't go here regularly, for shame!  Visitors find a way to go if you're a fish and chips fan.  It's worth the effort.",4WogffF1sf4idvGpqAYB8w,2,0,5,7GH3gauzzGfm_Srt-cV5vA

I was searching for the best fish and chips place in Las Vegas online, and after reading several reviews, I took a transplanted New Englander here today -- and they absolutely loved it, as did I! The food was amazing!!!!!!! We ordered the 2 pieces of fish and chips (we actually ordered it with half fries and half onion rings) that came with the most delicious clearly homemade cole slaw (I got an extra side order) and equally tasty tartar sauce, that had just the right amount of subtle flavor. The fish was fried to perfection -- each piece was SO flaky and tender inside, and the batter (perfect and light!) was nice and crispy outside. The portions were huge, and we were both impressed that the entire restaurant was spotless. Everything was so clean! The owners are a father and son who apparently took over this restaurant recently -- and they couldn't have been nicer. Angelo (the son) greeted and waited on us. He's a genuinely sweet guy -- the entire vibe of the place was SO welcoming! My lunch guest is disabled, and Angelo couldn't have been more loving, patient and accommodating. I saw that they had a Treasure Chest on the counter with little toys and treats for kids -- and I thought that this place would be perfect for bringing children to. While we didn't have dessert, next time I'd love to try a fried Oreo cookie... My guest and I were really blown away by how delicious everything was, and by the friendly, loving atmosphere that was made that way by the wonderful owners who also work there (there was also a very lovely waitress who we also liked a lot). This place, this food, and these people at OFF THE HOOK are the REAL DEAL!!!!!!! If you're looking for a no-frills restaurant with GREAT fish and chips (they had some fish tacos and a fish wrap on the menu that sounded delicious that I'd love to try next time!), large portions, and the nicest people around... you'll love it here.

Fish and chips is what I ordered and was spot on. Large pieces of fish. Fish is fresh and flaky, not just a bunch of batter and thin fish. Batter is thin and super crispy. Best fish and chips in town by far.

You are going to pay for it though. Seems a bit high in price, my guess is to support slow business and expensive fish. If you mention Yelp they give you an extra price of fish if you order 3 pieces or more. Definitely large enough to split if you get 3 pieces and 1 free.

We got the 2-piece fish and chip dinner the 1st time and were taken back by the price ($13 each) but it was too much food. We now order the 1-piece ($8) and it fills us up.

Service was polite enough, and the menu is mostly fried items (including desserts).

Opted for fish and chips on my visit- their specialty. The pieces of cod used were of good quality, and the fry was good. But the batter was bland and tasteless. Good crispness, and not too thick, but no seasoning. Chips were generic fries found frequently elsewhere- not sure what I was expecting but was underwhelmed. I will say that the tartar sauce was a homemade ranch dressing?-  smooth for dipping instead of chunky and light on flavor, but most definitely NOT tartar sauce. WTH?
Interested in trying their fish tacos, hoping they add a chowder to the menu.

Felt this place was a bit heavy on prices: meals from 1-5 pieces range from $8 to almost $30, with apps like onion rings (1/3 pound?) and fried zucchini going for $7 and cajun prawns for just under $10. I didn't feel that the quality was yet up enough to justify the prices.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,7,3,oidNY4KdCuzxevsPuiOD_Q

We got two orders of the fish and chips and it did not disappoint. At first we had been debating if 2 would be enough but they are huge pieces. And so filling. The fish was nice and crispy and brown in the outside, and pure white and soft on the inside. It couldn't have tasted any better.

We got an order of the Mahi Mahi Tacos to share. My husband loves these. The Mahi Mahi was delicious, it broke apart so easily. But I don't care for their sauce. It's a kind of spicy weird sauce .

The cups were dirty that we were drinking from. Asked for lemons he brings 3 out on a napkin. We ordered fish and chips and the Mahi tacos. My daughters tarter sauce had something brown at the bottom of it. My tortillas were cold and not warmed up. Go to use the ketchup with my fries and the ketchup bottle not full and nothing but  watery liquid came out. The tapatio sauces were not the usual bright red it was dark and more brownish. Where I was sitting I could see in the back the cook was not wearing gloves no hair net either. I guess I should've been happy a baseball  cap was on instead. Soda machines out of order they had other liquids in pitchers sitting on the counter. The back of the kitchen dirty and unorganized. Asked for ranch theres 3 of us he brings out 1. Got the fried oreos and it tasted like the grease from the fish. At Smith's theres a coupon that has a buy 1 get 1 meal and 50% off the desserts and it's not being honored any more.

Not this place, you have the option of the el chepo fish or the premium which is cod. Spend the extra money and go for the Cod. The batter has the right amount of spices. My wife and I split an order of 4 pieces which was just enough for both of us, she also ordered the key lime pie for desert. We took that home- the pie was just average-skip it.  I did enjoy my lunch here, the only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is the ambiance of the restaurant itself, its great for fast lunch but I wouldn't take out of town guests here for say dinner, they need to try and upgrade that a bit.

Really, our quest is solely for fish-n-chips. I was excited to find such a highly rated NEW fish-n-chip joint in my neighborhood. Tonight felt like the night so, off we went... 

Location/Ambiance; The restaurant is ingeniously tucked into a shopping mall that includes two HIGHLY rated Yelp restaurants; Baby Stacks & KoMex. The outdoor sign is temporary as, this is a new restaurant starting up. The inside is very clean, chairs & tables new & comfortable. Bathroom was spotless. 

Service; The owner was the guy-next-door kinda fella. Just a really nice, friendly sorta guy. 

Food; Both Hubs & I got the fish-n-chips- to go. OH.MY.GOSH. This is GOOO-oood! I got a (homemade) tangy tarter sauce that was sooo flavorful & amazing! The cod tasted fresh & had a firm flaky texture. The breading was light & crispy. My Brit Husband, whom has lived in Vegas over 21 years said; ""Best Fish-n-chips I've ever had in Vegas"". That's saying a lot. The chips were crisp & tasty. The coleslaw.... Ehhhh. It's was ok. We read through the menu planning our next trip. He's got fish sandwiches AND Deep fried desserts of all kinds; Oreo's, Twinkies, candy bars, cheesecake. I've never tried, but always wondered.

I previously tried Lazy Joe's in LV, but was a bit let down by the experience that I had just written fish n chips off in Vegas. I had remembered Off the Hook (great name, btw) was in the same plaza as some of my favorite places (Komex, Chef Zen) so I decided to pop in here for dinner with my husband. 

The food here is solid. I enjoyed the flavors in my Fish Wrap, which had cod, avocado, cabbage, Thai sauce and fresh pico in a tomato-basil wrap. This will be something I'd order again and again. Their cole slaw was crunchy and refreshing and the fries were hot and crispy. My husband enjoyed the fish in his fish n chips and the cod used was very 'meaty'. He'd like to try the cajun seasoning next time for added flavor in the batter. Tartar sauce was perfectly tangy and the owner read our minds and replenished our supply when needed. 

What I'm actually most impressed by is the amazing customer service from the owner. He was doing everything on his own - explaining the menu, taking orders, checking in on tables, refilling drinks, cooking, etc. At one point, there were 6 parties in the restaurant and he took care of everyone so seamlessly. It was way better service than I've gotten at a sit-down restaurant with more staff available. He never made anyone feel rushed or neglected, and he showed a lot of compassion to an elderly woman that was eating by herself and wanted to chat. It was the kind of genuine service that really leaves a positive impression on you and this is a business I'm rooting for.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,9,7,4,904jBSvXGgJ3d_ORDZC9NA

The scallops have the same kind of plumpness of the shrimp (little more flaky though) and has an interesting oceany flavor that scallops tend to have. The cod is very tender and flaky, although the biggest impression it left on me was how huge it was. (Also I think I came close to closing time so I got an small bonus piece along with my 2 main ones) The breading for the sea food seemed to be all the same, a light pancake like batter, little sweet and was fried perfectly.

The sauces can make of break the taste of all the awesomeness mentioned above, and I got two kinds, the red cocktail like sauce and a white tartar sauce. The red sauce was really good with a little tang and was not too salty with fruity notes. The tartar sauce is decent but i would like it to be a little thicker as it doesn't stick on to the batter that well.

I will definitely be coming here again and would like to try the desserts next time.",RGCG6LsZcUohGx4ApvG9Lg,6,0,5,uST1Bp--EZuGlzF_B7cBUQ

We were given the option to sit at one of the 2 top tables.  Feeling restricted and limited to a table choice with only 2 tables in there at that time, I was about to leave but decided to give it a shot.  During the visit only one of those ""reserved"" tables was utilized.  My guest and I did order the lobster roll.  I was surprised to see on one menu it just advertised lobster roll (found on the web), also indicated on their special board it showed ""Lobster Roll"" and the menu in the restaurant indicated it was lobster AND crab. However it was probably 80% crab and 20% lobster.   I would like to state, the sandwich WAS flavorful, the fries were hot and crisp, the coleslaw was good and, the food came out in a timely fashion.

I almost always get the two piece cod which are large portions.  The cod is crunchy and moist.  Tastes fresh frozen, but what can you expect being far away from cod country.  You are served fries (chips) and demitasse of cole slaw with two cups of tartar sauce.  Served on a serving platter.  All for $14.  Beverages are ala carte. I got the bottled water$1.00.  The menu has many options from catfish too white fish. They also have appetizers to choose from. The ambiance is sparse with about ten tables.  They have tried to follow a nautical theme inside but that's about it. You can order take out or eat in.  The place gets busy from 11 am onward.  The tables were in need of wiping down, at least the one I sat at, and the table condiments like the malt vinegar bottle had finger prints.  Your food is brought to the table by the cashier/waiter.

Within a few minutes of the confirmation text that my order from Amazon and the withdrawal on my checking account I received a text telling me that part of my order was cancelled.

I immediately called the restaurant to find out what happened. The woman who answered the phone was not very pleasant. She explained that they couldn't make that item so it was voided. I was disappointed that the restaurant wouldn't even attempt to contact me to see if I was interested in substituting for something else. I guess one of the two people who intended to eat were just supposed to go hungry. Also the amount of the refund did not match the price of the item. Based on the lack of customer service and math problems on their end I decided to cancel the entire order. I told the employee that I needed to feed two people and a partial order wouldn't work.  I asked about replacing it with something for the same price (what I paid not what they refunded). She said since they already refunded that item there was nothing they could do. I told her I would be cancelling the order and needed a full (correct) refund. She hung up on me. 

The refund and cancelled order was not sent to Amazon Restaurants. I waited for almost an hour (they would be closing soon) then had to contact Amazon. Amazon had no record of my cancellation. It took 30 minutes on the phone until they could confirm with the restaurant that they weren't making my food.

We repeated couple of times our order then the server said she got it. But when the order came, they were wrong, we got the 3 piece fish and chip with regular fries and also another 1 piece fish and chip we didn't order. We decided not to bother her. She was nice and friendly otherwise. Maybe she was overwhelmed that day I don't know.  After we got our food, the waitress came with someone's else's order and then realized it was for the table next to us. I ordered Coke but they gave me Diet.

Walking into the shop reminded me much of a little British fish and chips shop, and they had everything you'd expect, except the mushy peas. It's very cosy inside and it filled up with people quite quickly. 

There was so many options on the vegan menu, pizzas, burgers (with good FYH cheese) and more! But, it just happened to be friendly, which meant $9.99 AYCE vegan fish and chips was on the menu. Who could pass up on that. My table of three all opted in for this experience. 

I never was a coleslaw fan, but let me tell you, this coleslaw was really good. The fries were perfectly thick and warm, and the vegan fish was really tasty. To top it all off the tartar sauce was everything I could've dreamed of. 

Needless to say, we all left the place with our pants unbuttoned and our wallets felt unaffected. If you have $10 on a Friday, there's no better place to go. I can't wait to try all of the other items on their vegan menu!",bc8mJG5B-QWCOJPF4qn-0w,2,0,5,o3r6yPr6myA3TxF9Pmh2Uw

The place was clean and the service was great and very friendly, that deserves 5 stars but the fish was just not good. I should have read more reviews. Like Diana H said the fish was bland and in my case it was under cooked. I asked to have it made well done and they gracefully brought me a new platter but in my opinion it still was not well cooked. I couldn't eat it. I spent $25 on a meal I did not enjoy. They were large pieces, which is good but maybe the pieces need to be smaller before they are fried but what do I know. The coleslaw was ok but could have been better too, too much mayo. I also tried the zucchini, it was soggy.

Kudos to my friend for ordering mahi mahi instead of fried cod for diversity. I was surprised at how delicious the mahi mahi tacos were despite being grilled and tasting healthy and refreshing.

The owner asked us if we would like the twinkies to come out after the meal, so that they would be fresh. Good call for that, because the fried desert was a nice way to end our meal.

Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but for the quality of service and food, it's worth it. I would come again next time i crave some fish and chips.

The roll itself was small but with lots of lobster. My husband had suspected it might be fake lobster given the quantity and price and a taste not of lobster he couldn't identify.

Call me a purist, but lobster rolls should not have any tarragon.  Don't get me wrong.  I like tarragon.  I just don't think it belongs on a lobster roll and if you decide to use it you need to know it's a powerful herb.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  Also I want to point out that this was not crab.  It was imitation crab and if you're going to serve it you should not be calling it crab on the menu.  I may be wrong, but the lobster seemed more like langoustines than real lobster.   Still the bun was spot on.  It was grilled perfectly on both sides and was shaped like a real New England hot dog bun.  It had just the right mix of mayo for the meat.

The fish n chips were OK.  I didn't really like the batter.  For one thing they were somewhat overcooked.  The fries were fresh and well made.  The portion size was good.  The pieces of fish were quite large.

I was really close giving 3 stars, but I went for four because I like seafood and the service was good.  Any time a seafood place appears that's better than average I want to give it a try.  I'll try this place again for something different.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,2,0,4,jtQyKMjaNqaV1lEGf63xeg

The restaurant is small(ish) but it's clean, well lit and cozy comfortable. Even the potty wasn't the scary trip we encounter so often.

I found this lovely spot on Groupon but didn't buy a coupon and didn't need one. The price is reasonable and the volume of food is well above the average.

I have to say a word about Dan, he has absolutely gotta be the nicest person I have ever met (really) and and he adds to this delightful dining experience like no one I can remember.

If you're over that way for any reason, hungry or not, this is a treat that you should not pass on. We fish lovers plan to reture real soon.",yH0ScnRKtvYlhbwvJVhtMg,4,1,5,mrma_MXXxN4mJ5bwuUBggw

The curb appeal at Off the Hook was not great, but I shrug it off as many places with good food lack that. The place was not crowded but there were alot of take out orders. The staff was friendly and service was fast. The cod was definitely the star of the show! A little more breading than I would like but still crispy and the fish was nice and firm. My kid ordered the regular white fish. It was much more flaky but he enjoyed it. Now things go south a bit. The coleslaw was too creamy for my palate and lacked the crispness that I enjoy.  The fries were descent but not fresh and a bit under seasoned. We also had a few chicken strips but would not recommend them (its a fish place anyway!) The portions were generous so unless your really hungry, stick with the 2 piece meal. Overall, I would give them 3.5 stars. If you are just serving fish and chips you need to elevate your game and I don't feel they did. Off the Hook is just a bit off the mark. I feel if they made a few changes it could be a ""go to"" place but right now I will settle for a few good pieces of cod now and then sans the chips and slaw.",Q8_NyRxJYb2ROPYasOIdAQ,1,0,3,qKX-3WfHNRHSs3l3Vn00bw

After months of saying we're going to try this restaurant every time we're nearby to raid Pokémon gyms, we finally found the opportunity. Three of us just came from work and were hangry so we started right off the bat with the Family Size order of fish 'n chips and added the spicy cauliflower bites and Cape Shark tenders for good measure.

The tenders and bites came in first with the tenders proving to be irresistibly addicting with its crispy batter and flaky-tender hearty meat complemented by the tartar dip--we'd order more if it weren't for our large order coming in. The cauliflower bites are fantastic spicy bites, it is so crunchy and delicious you'd forget you were eating your veggies!

After almost being full from the apps, the star of the meal came in hot and golden. Our first scorching bite was absolutely delicious! The (huge) fish strips was perfectly cooked: light and crispy outside, tender and flaky inside without being dry or soggy and paired so well with the coleslaw and creamy tartar 'dip' (I mixed mine with Tabasco for some zing!)--definitely one of the best if not the best tasting fish and chips we've ever had, and it's not just the hunger talking. Did I mention the crispy, golden chips aka fries is just as good as the fish they came with?

We'll definitely be back for more as there's a lot of good items on the menu to be explored, not to mention that I can play Pokémon GO and spin the stops while waiting for the food to be served by the awesome folks who work there.",J4LGq7xYlHDfbfHbwbyK8Q,2,2,5,YiC9-a9ZybBa9mNykilcVA

I received and extra piece of cod yum! I ordered my food to go and it was made to order. It did not take long but it gave me enough time to check out the restaurants decor and cool pictures throughout.

The cod is huge! I can normally eat my cod and shrimp but this time I could only eat one piece of cod and two pieces of shrimp with a little fries.

They have mostly fried stuff so I'm glad they have something  grilled like the  mahi-mahi tacos which are pretty good and well seasoned. I also ordered the lobster roll which I had to throw away, as it had a funky formalin smell like those artificial crabs. I would have been more than willing to pay for more if they serve the real thing. I wish I've known about this before I ordered. 

I also found out they have daily specials which are pretty good deals.

One table was so upset because my friend and I received our order before them (they were there before us) they left without paying after they ate.

We ordered mozzarella sticks, a medium (2 fish sticks) & large(3 fish sticks) fish & chips both had the chips and coleslaw.

During our visit, we ordered a couple items, including: 
1. Hush Puppies
* 6 little puppies that are exquisitely delicious...I can't even describe how well the flavors were blended, and the fact that they were NOT rock hard is the reason this may someday be the sole reason I drive halfway through Vegas* 
2. Lobster Roll *disclaimer* 
We should have read the menu a bit more carefully because unfortunately we missed the word COLD in the description for this bad boy. I love my seafood, but I think this one was a little less lobster & a little more other seafood for me. The first bite was excellent, and then the second bite...I was ready to get my fish & chips back. 
3. SAILOR combination plate 
* 2 piece fish & chips w| 3 jumbo shrimp.* 
Now THIS is definitely one of the finest fish & chips in Vegas. I'm content we chose this platter rather than just fish & chips or shrimp...cause we got the best of both worlds. The fish was thoroughly fried; the batter wasn't overbearing -- and that's how fried fish should be...more fish, less batter! 

The proportions of ALL dishes were more than enough for our party of 2. We actually ended up getting a to go box because we couldn't finish.

Off the hook.  Off the chain! Off the  motha-effin-shelves even with a elf holding it down.  I'm from NYC and most of our best spots are spots like these.  Just places with people who love what they do and they do it well.  This place is the truth!!! It's a hole on the wall restaurant.  Everything is fresh and everyone inside is friendly.  They even let us stay an extra 32 minutes.  I was with family and they just was nice about it even though they were tired.  One of the dudes look like Action Bronson and he was mad chill.  After we left the place we chilled outside in the parking lot chatting just like in NYC.  The food didn't make us feel sleepy or oily.  Vegas folks are just down to earth.  The food was RIDICULOUS! It's most fried foods (So effin what?!) It's vegan friendly! it's just made from love and you can tell.  We ordered the lobster roll (good).

This place reminds me of a restaurant I loved back in Newport News, VA in which their menu items are similar to this restaurant. I knew I wanted hush puppies and I also ordered their 2 piece fish special ( comes with fries and coleslaw). Now the hush puppies weren't my favorite and the sauce I believe it comes with was just okay. BUT the fish and fries was so so so so good! The fish was fried to perfection while still being moist on the inside and the fries were cooked perfectly. Lastly let me just say I HATE coleslaw and normally I would ask for no coleslaw because I don't like being wasteful. But I decided to give it a try and let's just say I couldn't put my fork or the cup it comes in down. That coleslaw was divine and so refreshing.

4813856,2017-07-12,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"I have been wanting to try Off the Hook for some time now seeing how this was the ""spot"" in Las Vegas.

I attempted to stop by for lunch with my mom, who is a huge fish & chips lover, but it was closed on a weekday. Their hours of operation have seemed to change since then because they are now only closed on Sundays.

My boyfriend & I came in for lunch & I walked in surprised that it was a sit-down restaurant.

This is a minuscule detail that only I would get excited about, but they have bendy straws! Why can't all restaurants have bendy straws? That excitement was short-lived, however, because I spotted ""gunk"" in my boyfriend's water. I don't have a word for it because I'm not sure what it was, but we informed our waiter immediately. Apparently, there was an issue with the machine & my water had to be taken away as well even though I already had a sip because I was so excited to use my bendy straw. Yikes. We were given a cup with ice & a water bottle.

We got a glance at the menu already on Yelp, but it seemed to be updated & prices were lower than we saw previously.

I ordered their daily special, which on a Monday, is a lobster & crab roll served with fries & cole slaw. My boyfriend ordered scallops & the ""Sailor,"" which included 2 fish & chips, also used the Yelp check-in offer to have 1 additional fish & chip, 3 jumbo shrimps, fries, cole slaw & he upgraded it to cod fish.

I enjoyed my lobster & crab roll & although it wasn't as big as I thought, I got full from it. For it to include fries & cole slaw, $9.99 isn't a bad price at all.

My boyfriend enjoyed the jumbo shrimp. He could have lived without ordering the scallops & surprisingly, he didn't care for the fish & chips. I did try it & it's not the best I ever had, but it's probably going to be the best in Las Vegas that I've tried so far.

It wasn't the greatest first-time experience, but I would give this place another chance & bring my mom again to be a judge!",QSMsF78PxVYiAwwwHeZ7xA,8,2,3,jq0EPrNbYV4Cpkm06Z7nTw

Waste of money - if you're going to restrict menu options, it shouldn't be buried in the fine print so that you end up with angry customers when they show up.

I've never encountered a Groupon where specific menu items weren't included, and I can't begin to figure out why they would do it.  The whole point of a Groupon is to bring in new customers and convince them to come back and become a regular customer - why in the world would you not let the customer order what they want?

I traveled through New Zealand last summer and I've been to the United Kingdom and I can honestly say without a doubt that Off The Hook's fish and chips were among the best I've ever had!  

I grew up hating fish because I thought it tasted as bad as it smelled, and then a friend of mine told me that fresh fish doesn't have that fishy smell.  He also told me you can taste it.  That fishy smell and taste?  You won't find it here.  

My partner and I ordered a basket of the Regular Fish & Chips (Whitefish) as well as the Premium Fish & Chips (Cod).  The breading is great and was perfectly fried both times that I've been here.  The regular Whitefish pieces are actually a little bigger than the Premium Cod so you do get more bang for your buck there.

Inside of this place, there were plenty of customers that are already inside of the restaurant. I have ordered Fish & Chips + Chicken fingers combo, instead of fries, I asked for onion rings for extra $2 charge. My girlfriend ordered Fish & Chips + Shrimp combo with onion rings instead of fries also.

To start off, fish was melting in my mouth, so tender, crispy outside, which was what I have expected to have. It was great size also, So I really thought that the price was reasonable. Onion ring was a bit burnt, and salty in my opinion. But you know what? They insisted to comp my onion rings because there were a bit of delay, so which was good. I really liked my chicken fingers, but I believed that the size was a bit smaller than what I have expected, and it actually was salty too. My girlfriend loved the fish too no fishy smell, tender and crispy outside, but she actually was not big fan of the shrimp and onion rings with the same reason that I had, salty. She said she had some strong fishy smell into shrimp.

5279217,2018-02-25,4,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"Raised Catholic on the Great Lakes it was for Lent every year that Fish-frys overtook Friday night, the local Churches offering up whatever random White Fish they could find after depleting the Walleye, but here 20+ years later it was a billboard about Ash Wednesday that inspired a second visit to Off the Hook for anything but the boring options of childhood.

Originally visited in early 2017 and largely unchanged in the thirteen intervening months, the street sign on Buffalo listed as only Fish N' Chips with nearby KoMex Fusion as well as Babystacks still doing bang-up business despite their mediocrity, it was with an order placed online that Off The Hook was entered at 11:45am with the kitchen running behind by just a few minutes, two lunch specials plus a Side and Dessert tallying just over thirty dollars for enough Food to easily feed three people.

Recently adding some Vegan and Gluten-Free choices to a laminated menu plus daily specials featured on a blackboard it was with Styrofoam clamshells and cardboard boats wrapped in plastic plus paper bags that several pounds were carried upstairs to the office and unpacked, two Hushpuppies that were supposed to be included with the Catfish missing but everything else exactly as described on the menu and nicely presented despite being packed and driven almost fifteen minutes.

Hand-breading and frying a wide variety of items to order, line-caught Cod from the previous visit this time served as smaller nuggets on Tortilla Shells with Spicy Sauce, those looking for a filling Lunch for under $10 would do well to check this out with Regular or Sweet Potato Fries, the former additionally offered in a spicy version alongside the 8oz Catfish Fillet dusted in Cornmeal that comes across with all the expected flavor while remaining light and virtually oilless.

Finding Off The Hook's Coleslaw more enjoyable than most in part due to the thicker cuts of Cabbage and a light sweetness it was likely a result of the lengthy drive and steam inside the bag that Onion Rings were unfortunately found to be flaccid despite fairly good flavor, the $6 price for twelve a bit steep when compared to everything else while the Key Lime Pie once again showed well without adding a bunch of food coloring like so many others, the creamy texture and bright Citrus nicely balanced on the Graham Cracker Crust with just a stripe of Whipped Cream.

***1/2:  Definitely better for dine-in than take-out, but superior to similar local spots either way, Off The Hook remains a worthwhile stop for those looking for good fried Fish and French Fries while the menu offers enough variety that everyone can probably find something they'll enjoy.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,9,4,MMuiqht6SXWgxqdQrxqj1g

Let's face it... we all need some golden brown fried deliciousness in our life from time to time.  If you're going to do something fried, you've got to do it right.  The good will deliver you to the promised land, the bad is.. well bad.  Off the Hook really knows what they're doing with their fish and chips.

The batter on the fish is perfect, and not soggy or wet.  The batter sticks to the fish, and doesn't fall apart.  The fish is light, flaky, and very clean; no fishy taste whatsoever.  I've only ordered the premium fish which does cost a few bucks more, but it's amazing so I see no reason to change it.  

The chips are crispy and soft, and not under salted.  Both house made tartar sauce and malt vinegar are available.  I'm not big into tartar typically, but theirs is fresh and better than most I've had.

I'd also recommend picking up the hush puppies, they're to die for.",cB5M0WvNLk3bJi2IMsPH9w,0,0,5,M6oW0XHlJTdkvnvPt4ZXgw

I had the fish and chips. It was Pretty tasty and a large portion. I got Cajun fries instead of regular. They're slightly spicy not too bad but a delicious flavor. The vegan fish looks like it might be tofu. The breading for the vegan fish is  fried and a good thickness.  

I also got vegan tarter sauce and ranch. The tarter was good. The ranch seemed to be missing salt or a little more dill. Vegan coleslaw was okay (I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw). 

Overall good experience. Clean atmosphere, nice employees. 
I'll probably be back with the hope that they'll find a way to make vegan clam chowder. 

I got my food to go and they placed the food in an open basket and put it in a bag. So be careful not to throw it in the car and go. I wasn't aware of this but luckily my food made it safely to my house.

The fresh cod in beer batter, it was absolutely amazing!! Save room for dessert...the deep fried cheesecake with vanilla bean ice cream was another amazing favorite! This is definitely a hidden gem.

5849733,2016-03-24,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"I'll start by saying that yes, it's kind of expensive. But you absolutely get what you pay for. We had two of the medium orders of the cod (2 pieces each but they threw in an extra half piece with each order) with fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw is fantastic and so are the fries; they're super crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. The cod was especially good! They're huge pieces of fish and really meaty. And I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce but it was tangy and delicious. We also ordered a grilled cheese for the kiddo and it was huge! For dessert we ordered the fried cheesecake with blackberry and strawberry sauce and it was awesome! The vanilla ice cream rounded it out perfectly. They also had Coke AND Pepsi products so everyone wins!

The service was fantastic as well. We were informed that they've just changed ownership and may be opening on Sunday and/or Monday to bring in more customers... I hope they do! The owner was incredibly friendly and helpful. He also gave us a card and told us we could call in our order the next time if needed. I'm hoping this restaurant gets some recognition and stays in business because it's a new family favorite!",VruMFEJRddtg2GeoVC7gMg,1,0,5,9e7yj5Mh92lPORXKLJAtoA

5874479,2015-11-06,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"Dan is the owner and such a nice person, really great customer service. That being said.....the food is a cut way above standard fish and chips. Everything is so fresh and delicious. The breading is light and crunchy, just perfect. Freshest Cole slaw I've ever had, like home made and not over saturated with mayonnaise. The French fries tasted like fresh potatoes as they should, thick and really good. I have nothing negative to say, it's all good. Dan made Clam Chowder for the menu, a new item when we walked in. He gave me a sample...it was as good as any New Engand Chowder I have had and I'm from there so when I say it was good....it is.  Even if this location is out of the way, it is well worth the few extra miles. I highly recommend this great restaurant!!!",hlZr3cVCDRzTuypjWqD9_A,0,0,5,EnKDWuKjO_Fr-PZEMB_uig
5878495,2016-07-31,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,"They are under new ownership and took over about 5 months ago. That means they have different hours and actually open daily unlike the last owners.  

This was my first visit here, and the decor is fresh, very fitting to the theme and pleasantly clean.  

My husband and I shared the mixed plate. It came with 2 shrimp, 3 pcs of the cod+ 1 smaller pc for yelp check-in, 2 scallopp pcs, all over a bed of fries.   The star was definitely the large pieces of white cod meat covered in a thin layer of crispy batter.  The food came out fresh and fast, and I was really impressed with the thin layer of batter.  

The dipping sauces like tartar, cocktail sauce for the shrimp along with vinegar and ketchup for the fries were all delicious.  If I had to complain, I like my fries a little more well done to get that crisp. Either way, we devoured that dish and it was perfect for sharing.  

Overall, fresh seafood makes excellent fried food.  The beautiful white meat from the cod is super tender and easily worth the $18 price tag.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,6,6,4,lxvIW_SzdxWVIGrXo89Itg

5988690,2017-05-07,0,HYKTKG3X7jtLe6elxp63JQ,my 2nd time here.. I was here awhile ago  I left a review.. my last review I had put about the tartar sauce being very mayonnaisey..no flavor..and still is the same..the owner replied back and was going to check on it... I feel with such a good quality of cod..which was great ..u should make sure u have a equally good paired tartar sauce.. especially with the prices..which i dont mind paying if everything is equally made to perfection..tartar sauce should have lots of lemon juice..sweet pickle relish..very finely grated onion and fresh dill..cole slaw has no flavor but mayonaise ..and to the owner or whoever the chef is I read some reviews..about ur tartar sauce..u said u guys make it in house..I think I would just say u buy it like that..if ur a true chef u wouldn't serve such crappie sauce..u really should use my recipe in this review.. guess people dont know good slaw either..if guess u guys are big on mayonaise overload. .also this time ordered the jumbo shrimp..it's actually jumbo batter..the shrimp was tiny..it's was all batter..u couldn't even taste the shrimp..its like at long John silvers where everything is made with the same batter..and everything taste the same..and other thing if dining in..when u move ur chair at anytime it's so loud and annoying..easy fix..go to home Depot put those little tabs on bottom of legs of chairs..there's so much competition with places to eat in vegas..these are little fixes that make a huge difference..then ur place would be a gem and worth ur prices...,8DUBy2yBwrtgQ3kwd71_pw,0,0,3,B8adfmlkDvdoj8XR71K-9A
