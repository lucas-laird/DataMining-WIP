I highly recommend these gluten free desserts! You can even order them online or pick them up locally in Las Vegas/Henderson! Yeah! :) We used our treats for a birthday party we had at a restaurant that had limited gluten free menu options! They were perfect in size after a large meal. If you need gluten free try their dessert! Thank you to the owner of this place for doing gluten free that tastes good!",dYjTyQdfUi_wShDQaixViQ,0,0,5,8E_rO_AJPXwNompfLqABCQ
