Place is a little hard to find - in a back alley of the Chinatown.

After looking at the menu (that hardly makes any sense to a person that doesn't read mandarin) I ordered something called Chairman's Mao pork.  It turned out to be braised pork belly.
Portion was enough for 2... It was good and I probably could've ordered it more spicy.

All the dishes were authentic Hunan.  While eating, my husband said that if we could nail reasonable airfare in the future, we would come back for another meal.

You want spicy?  Hello sweaty time.  Authentic dishes, very reasonable prices, and really friendly people.

  I really hope this location works for them, because it's never that busy in here.  They are just far enough away from the hustle of Chinatown that they'll miss out on some business, but at the same time, it's quite obvious that everyone in here knows each other, and the wait staff is sure to recognize you if you are a repeat customer, which you should be.  

All dishes I've had here are great, from lamb dry pot, to mushroom/pork, and boiled beef/tofu dishes.  All cheap, and large quantity.

It's a cozy place in a good way, nice decor, and they do take away orders, which is alway good.",hBLPLzTW6j7zHDd0Rk1xww,3,0,5,zbTbJo2wJWdKbCeK6Mp5-Q

2 rice fried, one with chicken and the other one  with pork, it was very tasty.
We also tried the sweet and sour chicken...OMG, it was very delicious!

By cons, all dishes  was really not HOT HOT HOT at all.

As for the service during our most recent visit, we were disappointed the frequency of drink refills.  We pushed our ice tea glasses to the edge of the table and tried to make eye contact with the waiter, who I suspect was the owner's son, we still had to wait and eventually had to ask to get refills.  

However, what is lacking in service is definitely made up for by quality and authenticity of food.  The first time we ordered the wild mushroom hot pot, which was wonderful.  This time we tried the beer braised duck, eggplant and long bean, smoked beef and hot and sour soup.  The eggplant was by far my favorite, it had a wonderful flavor.  The hot and sour soup also had a good flavor but did not contain much in the broth, such as chicken etc. I liked the flavor of the smoked beef, however, probably due to the smoking process it was too dry for my taste.  

Although the service was not what I would have hoped for, and what is holding me back from giving this establishment five stars. We will definitely go back.

700325,2014-09-20,0,JdoBiBRgeS_KKaNaU1sofA,"I read the reviews on Yelp, and I was eager to try this place. I asked my friend who had previously went to this place how it was. She said it was okay and nothing would be awesome because she's from China. So, I decided to try this place because I was in an Asian mood. 

First of all, the location was not too difficult to find. It is in the same plaza as Jinya Ramen.  My friend had already been sitting there, and we chatted so we were not ready when the waitress asked us if we were ready to order. 

We ordered the chicken gizzards with pickled radish, lamb with cumin, pork tongue, some fish. Now, the meat entrees all tasted and looked exactly the same. It was as though they just changed the meat. The entrees had bell peppers, cumin, and just all in all tasted the same. 

We really wanted fish and tofu, so we asked them if they had any dishes like that. They told us they could add tofu to the fish, but it would take about 20 minutes. We were fine with that. Our fish came out, and they asked the table behind us if that fish was theirs. The couple said no, and they brought out our fish to the table.  Later on, they said they made a mistake. They brought out another fish without tofu, and gave it to us. My friend told them. We wanted tofu. They said oh we gave it to the wrong table. Uh... How is that our fault. We specifically wanted fish and tofu. The owner agreed to bring out a new dish with tofu in it. The fish tasted really good. It was really soft and delicious as well as the tofu.  The fish was my favorite part of the meal. 

They do get quite a few tour buses. We were sitting there eating, and the owner would receive a phone call every so often telling them how many people the tour guide was bringing. I guess they get a lot of business from that. I prefer Yunan Garden way more!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,2,BuGBTdJXjBmGU3YdHwn6fg

When we got there, I was impressed by the clean, rather cute decor.  But the place was empty except for one other group.  My parents started having their doubts, but I remained positive.  Maybe it was still early...

First mistake: my family doesn't eat spicy food.  So we asked for everything mild, which they made for us.  But if you don't eat spicy, why bother going to a Hunan restaurant?  D'oh.

I actually thought the meal was okay.  Nothing was truly bad but also nothing was great.  My parents hated it though...so much they wanted me to write this review.  Apparently one of the dishes was supposed to feature shrimp...and instead consisted of huge bunches of broccoli and a few sad little pieces of shrimp.  And no one really touched the catfish.

If you don't eat spicy food, then you can find better Chinese food elsewhere.  But if you like your food hot, then I still think it would be worth trying this restaurant.",dGkU_WEGvWHLS6UAFJPfxg,0,0,2,lQ89zwAvqSPK1tXs4FoIQA

We ordered the smoked ham with bamboo shoots.  Sauce was salty, meat was dry and it was just too oily.  We also ordered the beef stew noodle.  The soup looked more like chicken noodle soup with beef and pasta noodles.  No veggies at all. Plain flavor. 

The hot green tea they served was in a tea bag and hadn't begun to steep before we finished eating.  So basically we had hot water.

The second order was a Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot. It doesn't come with rice so that was an extra item to order. And the hot tea is complimentary upon request at no charge. When the food arrive, I was disappointed with the lack of vegetables (it's just bok choy and bean sprouts) and their version of Chow Fun is a thin rice noodle instead of the usual wide noodle.

No, it's not all that close, but at least it's on the same bus line.  Besides, I wanted some taro yogurt from Queen yogurt and some winter melon buns from Sunshine Bakery afterwards.

I had the Ma's Spicy Diced Chicken, and had to persuade the waitress to make it good and spicy.  I also had the stir-fried eggplant and long beans because they were out of ong choy.  The only thing I didn't care for was that both dishes were too similar in color and flavor, although individually each dish was really, really good.  The chicken was extremely salty (probably from all the preserved black beans) and chewy without being stringy.  And there were plenty of both fresh and dried hot peppers.  Chewy chicken suited the dish far better than mystery soft meat or tender chunks of white meat ever would (ugh).

Next time I'll have a lamb dish, or a dried tofu dish, or chairman Mao's pork, or some other pork dish.  There are lots of appealing offerings on the menu.

Now, if you are used to Panda Express and P.F. Changs and like that Americanized style of Chinese food, they have a list of those kinds of dishes too, but I'd guess that you get what you deserve if you order them.  I'm as fair-skinned and blue-eyed as any other gaijin, but when I want Chinese food, I want **Chinese** food, and this place delivers.

My only issue, do not pay online before pick up- they seem to have a only one person that knows how to see whether it is confirmed or not. Better pay in person to avoid an unnecessary sometimes difficult conversation. Very friendly staff!!",moIyziGNOBWNpjymfzCSvQ,2,1,5,eViyd6JD0J34bqYoWlEsbQ

Things were promising when I saw the Health District ""A"" pinned on the wall.  Too bad that I saw napkins dropped onto the floor and then picked up (presumably for re-use?) instead of being tossed.  But worse was the well used kitchen rag that wiped down our table... and left some remnants in its wake.  BLECH... and the only reason this place isn't 4 stars.

On to the good:  all of the food.  ALL OF IT.  Seriously.  Service was also awesome, with the waiter painstakingly trying to explain what we were ordering.  Go -- you will love it.... but look the other way when they're wiping down your table.",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,0,0,3,sAqVTJZZTlUoie26emWNhg

It looked like a meaty Christmas wreath with all that green and red.  Did I mention that it was great?  Like the showoff I am, I ate every single chili pepper and my stomach felt like a furnace for hours.  If you're white and you visit Dong Ting Spring, don't feel the need to eat every pepper and melt your guts.  I already represented for you!

A customer who was so nice, helped translate for me. SO, I got mixed vegetable lomein. It was great!!! I was so pleased with it. My husband got the Kung Pao Shrimp. He was raving about it. He really enjoyed the peanuts in the dish. He got it medium hot and I was surprised that it wasn't overpowering. I thought it would still be incredibly hot and it wasn't. The shrimp were little, which I dont like, but  I wasn't eating it,  he was. He said the dish was delicious and he didn't care at all that they were small. I asked for water but I dont think the waitress/owner understood me. She smiled and said yes but never came back with water. I would have liked some but it didn't effect my meal whatsoever.

-Wild Mushroom Hotpot:  different types of mushroom, thin slices of pork, leeks, and tons of pepper.  Ooh wee, it was spicy but oh so good.  Highly recommend, as many other yelpers have already done so.

-Eggplants with hot peppers:  I love eggplants and I love the way the lightly sauteed them with the peppers.  Very good.

3577098,2011-01-19,0,JdoBiBRgeS_KKaNaU1sofA,"I'm a pretty fussy eater and won't eat much of what's on the menu but still if I want some Chinese food this is the place I'll go.  It's in the same location as many Asian businesses:  off of Spring Mountain Road.  It's actually hidden away a bit and difficult to find in one of the newer strip malls in the area.  It's very much a ""hole in the wall"" type place and a bit hot inside, but it's clean and the service is fast. 

A friend who is a real foodie recommended it to me, and two specific dishes:  Ma's Spicy Diced Chicken and Dong Ting Spring style fried rice.  I've probably eaten here a dozen times since then and I've consistently ordered these two things because they're so good.  

They have another dish on the menu which is just called ""Spicy Diced Chicken"" or some such, so I don't know what the difference is but Ma's Spicy Diced Chicken is chunks of chicken with peppers, some oil, and a few black beans.  Depending on how spicy you ask for it they actually use different peppers.  I would strongly suggest getting it as spicy as possible, otherwise the flavor of the dish is really diminished, plus I can't imagine anyone would want to eat the harder smaller peppers on the medium spicy dish.  It's a slow burn and even if you love hot foods you'll have a few sniffles at the end.

The Dong Ting Spring style fried rice has the perfect consistency.  It doesn't feel wet or mushy or crunchy, it's just right.  It has bits of pork in it.  What differentiates it from a normal pork fried rice?  I have no idea and I'm not going to find out because it's easily the best fried rice I've ever had.  

Prices are low, portions are large and two people can comfortably eat one order of the chicken and fried rice and I imagine it's much the same for their other dishes.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,1,5,lWBHoQB_zZgWVwyWrJ0bDw

4975611,2010-12-17,1,JdoBiBRgeS_KKaNaU1sofA,"Wanting some spice in our life, we headed in the direction of food from the Hunan province.  Our usual go to spot would be Yun Nan Garden, but we decided to change it up a bit and give its neighbor ""Dong Ting Spring"" a chance.  It's conveniently located right next door to Yun Nan and taking a peek inside, you can see which one has more customers.  That's okay though, we're an adventurous bunch and we'll give any place a go!  (It doesn't hurt that all their reviews are between a four and five star.)

Walking in, we were warmly greeted by the waitress and shown to a table.  She asked in Mandarin if we wanted tea or water (or at least I think that's what she asked.)  We confirmed tea and it arrived quickly, along with a menu.

Utilizing Tony T.'s posted pics, it helped with our dinner choice.  We figure it was a bit of gamble, but was confident we'd be satisfied.  After putting in our order, the waitress asked us how we wanted our spice level and we chose medium.

* Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot ($11.95) - The first dish to arrive and it comes sizzling with a flame below it.  It's a combination of mushrooms, some sort of meat, peppers, and packed with flavor.  Great choice!   

* Shredded Potatoes with Vinegar Sauce ($6.95) - We discovered this shredded potato dish at Yun Nan and really enjoy it.  But when it comes with vinegar sauce, woah - what a tangy contrast!  One bite and I knew the Husband would be loving this dish.  Something so simple and basic, but yet has so much flavor.  We're down with the potatoes!

Steamed rice is 50 cents per person.

Service - although English is limited here, the friendly face and patient look on the waitress's face makes ordering and eating here a much better and pleasant experience than other Hunan restaurants in town.

Although it's not quite as busy as their neighbor, we did notice families eating in the back and a group of regulars arrive shortly after us.  So they do have a steady following.

Overall, you can't go wrong with Hunan food.  It's just so full of flavor, spice, and kick.  Their food is far from bland.

Our only downfall was not making this a group thing.  The more the merrier, and in this case that means more dishes to try and share!  Next time you want to add some spice in your life, do it with a group - it's always better that way!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,6,4,rbp7mP7oFXmQC4gUo1DHsg
5053347,2010-04-29,0,JdoBiBRgeS_KKaNaU1sofA,"Hot? Yeah, well, it's Hunan food - isn't that part of the point? A buddy in Vegas suggested I stop by Dong Ting Spring after he overheard me complain that I hadn't had good Hunan food in years - and he was absolutely correct. I had the smoked ham with dried turnip as well as an order of eggplant with long beans. The smoked ham was as good as I've ever had: high quality meat, plenty of it, with leeks and chilies like you wouldn't believe. The eggplant was super tasty as well with fresh, delicious long beans mixed in with another generous helping of chilies.

Best of all are the staff: friendly, patient, and keen to make sure you enjoy your meal while making you feel welcome. The restaurant is spotlessly clean with an wide variety of dishes on the menu - it's shame I don't live in Vegas because I'll never get to try everything they serve!

The only downside is the lack of a liquor license: iced water and hot tea are offered right up front, they do have some sodas, but alas no beer.",dvO3RLbJnIV8ptpAnZzOBQ,2,0,4,cBtKsoFWFotDloWXcCgVbg

5349228,2013-10-02,1,JdoBiBRgeS_KKaNaU1sofA,"I gotta say. My friend and I got SUPER confused when we found this place. We didn't know whether or not we found the right place. When we looked at the picture of the restaurant front on yelp and the actual restaurant, there were some differences. But then we compared the chairs/background and it matched what was in the restaurant so we were at the right place. No worries guys, I am extremely helpful: I completely forgot to take a picture of the front of the restaurant. But also no worries, it's the ONLY Chinese restaurant in that plaza! And I also believe it has the word ""CHINESE"" on their sign after all the Chinese characters.  

Anywho, we went for dinner and it was kind of empty, which is sort of weird. You know how when a restaurant is empty during the peak hours of dinner, it's a bad sign. But we walked right in anyways because we have to try their SPICY WILD MUSHROOM HOT POT that I've been seeing so much on this page. I just gotta try it! 

The hostess was very friendly. Asked if we wanted tea or water. We opted for both and she didn't even blink and eye and got it for us. After much decisions, we ended up going for the Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot (of course) and the Lamb with Cumin Sauce. At first we weren't sure if we had to order rice or not but rice auto came with our meals. 

There are three spiciness levels from 1 to 3, 3 being the spiciest. My friend and I LOVE spicy stuff so we choose 3 for both of our dishes. We figured, hey, why not. Let's enjoy our meal now and we'll deal with the bathroom portion of it later if our stomachs did not agree. 

Spicy Wild Mushroom Hot Pot? Yelpers definitely don't steer you wrong. It tasted AMAZING. It wasn't bland because they had strips of pork in it to give it some flavor. The spicy peppers add a kick to it as well. It is definitely something you should order and try if you like mushrooms. As for the Lamb with Cumin? It was good too! Though the pieces of lamb kind of bunched up together because they probably used sliced shabu shabu style lamb. The only problem I had with these dishes was that it was SUPER oily towards the bottom of the dish. But it was SO GOOD. We ate some of the peppers too and they were SPICY. You know how in some dishes, it'll say ""Jalapeno ____"" and you eat the supposed jalapeno and it's not spicy at all? You won't have a problem here. But be sure you can handle it. 

Oh, remember how I said the rice was auto'd into our meals? It was also auto'd into our bill. Rice is $0.60 per person. Which isn't bad at all cause we took some of the food home and there was a good portion of the rice that we took home as well.

It was my groups first time, but it felt like one of our regular haunts. The staff were courteous and gave us time to look over the menu. Even though we were not ready to order, they did not look upset when we sent them away to continue to browse. 

The food is hit or miss. There were dishes that I loved and then there were the lackluster misses. As everyone has stated, the wild mushroom hot pot was delicious. The spice was tame and more on the sour side. It was apparent that the chili they used was the red vinegar chili sauce. The mixture of pork, straw mushrooms, onions, red and green bell peppers gave the dish a visual appeal. The sauteed potatoes in vinegar sauce was tame for my taste. I like a vinegar dressing to be extra tart. The flavor was simple and clean. 

The dishes I was disappointed in were the sweet pork and the fried rice. My friend speaks Chinese and ordered a dish he got while in California. It came out and tasted like sweet and sour pork without the pineapple and vegetables. When he ordered, I believe he was hoping for a Mandarin style pork dish that has a deep red sauce. The fried rice was also mediocre. I had a scoop of it and went back to the white rice. The pieces of spiced pork was sparse and added little flavor to the overall plate. 

The menu is extensive and has many uncommon dishes. When I do go back, the more exotic dishes will be higher up on the list to try.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,3,suFlPzi7AgGehGo6lmXI6Q

We got the baked tofu with garlic scallions and the garlic sauce eggplant.  The tofu was taaaaaaaaaasttttttteeeeeee.  Mmm.  The eggplant was also very good, with a pungent sauce that was really heavy on the spices.  You could really taste the 5 spice.  
The flip side of that was that it wasn't spicy at all.  I guess it was a good thing because I could taste the rest of it, but I just am a little disappointed when spicy food isn't spicy.  Even the chili soy bean oil on the side wasn't spicy (but again, unique, with really heavily smoked chilis that added a little something-something je ne sais quois that you don't normally get).
Rice was unevenly cooked, tea was kinda boring, some pepper seeds were oddly hard, but it tasted like real Chinese food, at least.  Just kinda wimpy Chinese.  I'm giving it a 4 mostly because I have no idea what to expect around here and it's not like I have the highest standards for rando restaurants in the middle of the desert.
