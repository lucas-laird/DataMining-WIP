Limo is very well kept, clean and upgraded with everything. I would definitely rent this again when I'm back in Vegas 

There customer service team is awesome too! I had no issues with getting in contact with anyone at any point during my reservation when I had to make changes an they are really quick to respond.",xz1vSELSL7Gto__hXG2LLQ,0,0,5,ILvnPi0jQNuUdoW-NgiPnA
1994843,2017-12-06,0,S7jW3urXh4dal_OgycrxVQ,"I used Yelp to find a limo service and thought I found the right one because of all the great reviews...I was wrong! It was so bad that he forgot to even call me back to schedule the service...MULTIPLE TIMES! All I wanted for our group was the airport pick up and Vegas sign service that everyone else raved about and I got excuse after excuse after excuse...only to finally get blamed for it ultimately not even getting scheduled. Adam talked a good talk...and even sold me on all the other stuff he could do...skip the lines at clubs, etc. But what he couldn't do is basic customer service 101...simple follow through! 

I was able to book with another limo company and received amazing customer service through them!


Well that didn't take long...JUST LIKE I SAID...blame the Customer! Ha! I have the text messages to back the truth in the story!",1Y2iAH99EOKL_U1snHyfaQ,0,0,1,6QX3XW9g4CLlJF9nLtbeZw

Not only was it easy to book, the driver checked in multiple times leading up to our reservation. He was always on time and was fun to hangout with. We had an amazing experience and will definitely be using him again.",MmF3ZGQX-tr1JFQxiwHaCg,0,0,5,KFBeaIQ8Z8Aad4FjWMn60A

Very reasonably priced and always cheerful,sharp, and at time hilarious. I wouldn't ever consider calling anyone else but him he has become a great friend of mine and my families over the years. Even when I am not there I can trust my customers/friends will be taken care of as I would. Best part about Adam is I remember one time I called him because spur of the moment we decided to grab a limo and head to Fremont street from MGM rather than taking multiple cabs, but Adam was booked already within 2 min I kid you not he called me back and said meet this guy out front in 5 min and he had one of his other drivers get us in a very nice,sleek, badass Jaguar stretch I may add.",NWUZdhL05cU8tiKbw84rnQ,0,0,5,Q5ZkfnHGEDZKfZKKoXEaUQ
