Food was hot & fast just in case of a zombie attack I was ready to fight...
The service was friendly and made me feel safe so I didn't have to watch my back when I was eating...

 It's a great spot to stop after a long day in the wasteland we call Lost Vegas Or when you just want to refuel after killing zombies all day. Good job Zombie Dog in keeping the common wealth fed. I will see you on my next voyage across the wasteland.",K3pn8ImP4Q31ZrthJXJRHA,0,1,5,JcksQdH5K_-hIkaBuZ3F1w
