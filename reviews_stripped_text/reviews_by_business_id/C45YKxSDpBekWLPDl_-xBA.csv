This has become one of my favorite food places...I can't even tell you how many times I've been comforted by the food as it's made with so much love...it's a bit pricey but gadayum is it worth every penny!!  Now, maybe you don't feel like being enclosed by the darkness of this place..maybe the blinky lights and the hooping made your head spin a bit after a more than a few pickle backs... but have some water, visit the prestine potty and make sure you rub the glitter or lipstick off before we take it outside! The patio (choir of baby angels sing)..be swept off your feet and have a seat..you'll find lovely potted plants and, if you look closely, find some precious little gems hiding in the soil. But before you get too cozy outside, make sure you don't leave without dancing a bit ! I know I have always been enchanted by this place..great events, awesome staff, delicious nomnoms, and I always find some very colorful characters to chat with or to be held by unless I am blinded by the plate on my face *lick lick*",nRE1JWGAez1NQYO1LKyfZA,0,0,5,tu_XLNOhhFz4OrvFTMXrgw

I don't drink so I was only there for the food. The owners are fixing the place up but it is very nice and clean, had good music, does live karaoke at 9pm I think, just a very fun and casual vibe. The bartender was super nice and friendly, my friend said no other place makes Moscow Mule like this place...and she knows her drink so I believe it! 

Happy hour is buy one drink gets one free! The food was really good! The taco-nut was delicious, fried wonton topped with rice, salmon and sweet sauce. Nacho was loaded, tons of meat and cheese. Lettuce wraps were HUGE! Lots of meats and goodness! Pot stickers were fried, served with chili oil which I LOVED! 

I don't know how much the bill was but I'm assuming it is nothing crazy expensive. Pretty big menus, lots of appetizers, pizzas, sliders and burgers and sandwiches. I will definitely be coming back for happy hour.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,0,4,A5cNuWkfO9oTxmDp_Zu5Ew
2509836,2015-04-23,0,C45YKxSDpBekWLPDl_-xBA,"In a city where cuisine is tightly scrutinized, The Kitchen here at The Phoenix Lounge reigns supreme! All of the food they have to offer have beautiful presentations that soon become ground zero for the obliteration you create as you devour the savory and well balanced dishes. I've had the Blazing Burger as well as the Taco Naughts and you truly will not find better combo to have. The Taco Naughts provide a gentle and textural subtlety that has a lift of sweetness and an air of Asian flair, as for the burger...well let's just say no one was allowed to share that with me! A definite place to stop and devour some dishes!",oKLcAAnGUtt-iBZdDibj1w,2,2,5,pmlkjeN8I-zBCkZwNTz3uw
2662811,2015-06-23,1,C45YKxSDpBekWLPDl_-xBA,"Unexpectedly excellent food in a bar setting.
Everything was cooked as if a talented chef cooked it. The wings were hot and crispy. The wafflewich had hand-whipped cream which made it unexpected and delicious. The ""taco naut"" was fresh seared salmon on sushi rice on a Mexican tortilla, really delicious. Will come back again.",d2nTbozNsHPeTv37uTsKmw,4,0,5,6_uWGNSk5bV9XHt0msDk1g
3313602,2017-04-08,1,C45YKxSDpBekWLPDl_-xBA,I wasn't going to order anything but a lady named Deb set next to me in the shared her wings and fries with me so I give her a couple bucks to put up girl's butt up on stage. She didn't do it and I promised her that that girl's ass had a dollar bill acceptor,h9HcpA7sDfs41v7w-4vC-Q,0,0,4,U1vA_DNsTgdnSknm1n5wDQ
3996659,2015-04-23,0,C45YKxSDpBekWLPDl_-xBA,"This unique menu is blowing my mind. The salads are so good, the taco nauts are going to be famous, and the shrimp (Gambas al Ajillo) are to die for! I have been living off of this menu for weeks, and I'm picky. So good.  Check them out, check in on YELP & get 10% off the already GREAT deals. Oh, and the deserts...MMM! Only one thing I'm not a fan of, but the same people keep ordering it...maybe I just don't like that particular thing in general, never had it anywhere else anyway..two thumbs up for sure!",_yP8TIEkpYYfw3ReDIe-UQ,0,1,5,NtTi93mHEyKEDnb1OKx4QA
5076340,2018-03-12,0,C45YKxSDpBekWLPDl_-xBA,THE lgbt bar to go to! Never a dull moment at the Phoenix!

Enjoy video games with some Phoenix fingers or a burger and a dragshow. You will always enjoy your time at the Phoenix!,hPTKzqOCMbVklYJu79itpQ,1,0,5,ci4Ngk88lpdxL3aOGTWRtQ
5487650,2018-01-17,0,C45YKxSDpBekWLPDl_-xBA,"Excellent food, better than restaurant quality. We have ordered a lot of things at this place. The sushi tacos, carne asada Tacos, pizza, and chicken wings are the most recommended in my opinion. The staff (just like at Phoenix Bar) is very friendly (Shawna is adorkable!), and they will find you anywhere in the bar to go serve the food to you!",5x-oeGbDdUSogKeVPihrvw,0,0,5,XkpYzH6C28CSoiMcPXAjdQ
