There must have been 6 un-bussed un-cleaned tables. The bathrooms (mens, womens) obviously had not been cleaned or attended to all day as there was trash all over the floor. The toilet paper roll was on the floor (the roll holder was broken), and there was no soap or hot water available (we reported this to the health dept.)

Do yourself a favor and eat at the 4* Chuck Wagon Restaurant in the Longhorn Casino 100 yards to the north. The only reason we visited this Denny's was that the Longhorn was crowded.",df616h7n58jbHfYO5OdbvA,1,0,1,QytHiNPKbFexP_RxzHaYOw

There are about 8 choices to select  pancakes, bacon , hash ,grits , toast etc can't remember them all.
      Anyway it was nice to just pick and chose instead of the usual , playing the substituiton game.   I gave it the third star for the build your own slam option, ok .  It made me happy that's what counts , Thank you",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,0,0,3,6e8VcdGFCRVNqzUqpkDs-A

856448,2013-10-21,0,8nDEOGVVvReXFJ2zjPh4Pw,"I work at the Cannery and have an ever changing schedule.  I've give this Denny's a chance over and over again.  It has never been great but recently I had the worst experience of my life.  I was in last Thursday and had a server named Cameron.  He seemed completely uninterested in helping us.  He told us that he was off soon and just seemed to be counting down the minutes.  He seemed to be ignoring our table even though I never say him running around waiting on other tables.  I felt like we were rushed to eat our meal and after having just worked all day, we were not interested in being rushed.

In this review, I want to give another review, which is the only reason I have even bothered to give one.  

Tonight my fiance came over after I got offer work and she wanted to go to Denny's after I got off.  I tried to get her to go elsewhere but she really wanted Denny's.  We went in and I have to say, this was the best experience I've had.  I was bummed because I wanted a scoop of chocolate ice cream and they were out of it, but I was pleasantly surprised by our service (which has previously been my issue).  Tonight Bart waited on us.  He was so refreshing after the last experience I had here.  He was interested in providing us with a positive dining experience, and nothing else.  I watched him with other tables and he seemed to treat every table with the same amount of courtessy and respect that he treated us.

I really have no desire to ever go back to this location at any other time rather than when Bart is working.  Sadly, I don't attend Denny's all that often after 10PM which seems to be when he is working.",pvKF6u9IkfFN2fWEH2amtA,0,0,2,qUmdsy6Cp_WsGe30vvx-IA

Looked like there was only 2 servers 1 manager and 1 busser. They were noticeably understaffed. Anyway, I asked for a breakfast skillet with eggs over hard, but got my eggs over easy. Skillet was hot so I didnt make a big deal about the eggs because they finished cooking on the skillet. The food was decent. After we got our food I wanted hot sauce, but our sever was no where to be found. I waited for about 20 minutes with my food un touched before my fiance finally got up and asked a different server for hot sauce because they didn't have any on any tables nearby. Server never came by to ask if we were good on drinks or anything. We had to wait, until she came by with the hot sauce before we could ask for water.

I called and was greeted by Gustavo.  I placed my ""special"" order.   I wanted mushrooms left out, and the fried onion/bell pepper mix, as well as the bourbon sauce, on the side.  That way, I could build the burger at home, and eliminate the soggy bun that would have certainly been there, if I had let them put it together in the restaurant.
I know that seems simple enough, but trust me, most of the time they don't get it right.  I hate when that happens!  LOL
TONIGHT was different.  Gustavo got everything right.  My salad was perfect, and the burger was hot, juicy, and all the goo-makers were in little containers on the side - EXACTLY like I wanted.  
He gave me a time to pick up, and was was right in time.  That meant I got home with crispy fries, too!

She came to get my order only to discover she had forgotten to give me a menu card.
She ran off and retrieved one off another table.  I sat back and talked with the lady at another table who sat down about the same time as me, she was just laid off from Station Casino's coffee shop, at 78 years old was afraid she wasn't going to be able to get another job. We both commented on the poor service and how things are not as they used to be. My food finally came and I pointed out they lady had been seated about as long as I and hadn't been served.
I had the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. It was a new memory in the making; the food was cold, except for the bacon, which dripped of grease.

They also messed up another order at my table. The customer service here was terrible in general.

We go dine in and Katrice(she told us her name was) denied us the coupon because it wasn't printed out when her boss confirmed to us that she would honor it just to get people to come in. The service was terrible, waited almost 30 mins for our food. Not only that but when we've ordered take out they ALWAYS forget something.

I visit here usually every Friday for dinner with my boyfriends parents and tonight the service was awful. It took about 10 minutes for us to order and get our drinks. We were waiting about 45 minutes for our food, and when the food came out it was cold. The only ones to blame is the management. NOT the waitresses. 

Rachel wasn't our server tonight like she normally is. That girl works her butt off! She is always amazing and incredibly friendly. You can tell she's stressed out but a smiles always remains on her face. She definitely deserves 5 stars, but I can't give Dennys the same recognition as the management needs to get their shit together. The past five or six times I've visited Rachel is usually the only the on the floor and is running around doing everything. Really!? It's a Friday night, have more people helping the girl out.

We went in very late like...2-3am late on a saturday night. It was fairly slow and only one server but our server, Bart, was rushing around from table to table and more then friendly. Most people working graveyards at places have the attitude like they dont want to be there, but he was energetic and happy which made up for the shitty food (we didnt even complain). He works there most nights apparently so chances are you won't be too disappointed if its a late night Dennys stop. Now as for the food...we got the bacon and cheddar fries...and there was barely enough cheese on them to taste, then they forgot the tomatoes on my sandwich, but my friend did enjoy her burger, I just don't know if its enough to ever order the same things from here.

They changed the menu - drastically - and it sucks. No French dip, no salmon salad, no chicken Caesar. Had to settle.

I used to love their chicken noodle soup. Figured I'd drown my sorrows in a nice big bowl. I got a big bowl, alright. A big empty bowl - barely 1/4 full. I paid for the bowl, but I bet the cup actually had more soup in it.

Got the steak cobb. Lots off lettuce. Lots and lots and lots of lettuce. If you look at the picture, do you see the steak? Me either. After digging through the first layer, I found another layer of lettuce. The piece of steak I did mine in all that lettuce was so salty it was nearly inedible.

It's sad that Dennys has actually managed to go downhill - I guess the hill was bigger than I thought.

Oh, yeah, the service. Pretty typical Dennys. If the server asks if you need a moment SAY NO! Even if you have no idea what you want, don't let him leave or you will never see him again. Refills? Forget it. Extra dressing? You'll have to jump in front of him because there will be no eye contact as he runs by. 

Made the mistake of using the bathroom on the way out. Ewwwwww!

Nearly a 40 minute wait for a cheeseburger. I was  told that medium well done was my only option for the burger, no mediam rare. I never experienced that at any other Denny's locations. Milkshake normally comes with a full glass plus what's left over in the the tin. The menu even says extra is in the tin. I had to ask for the remaining shake in the tin and the waitress thought that was a joke and went back to the kitchen area complaining that I actually wanted what I was paying for.Manager appeared stressed but did a good job of keeping a happy face and was actually working hard to keep customers happy. Waitress, named Dawn did not do a good job of appearing to give a damn. Slow waitres who did not appear to want to be there. For $10 burger and a $4 milkshake go to Johnny Rockets..
