384481,2015-11-30,0,3yhdmUXeZS5j9xZRcuIv0g,Tried to order online. Had a special of 2 med pizzas for $7.77 each. Website wasn't working so called in. Asked for same special given site wasn't working. They refused. Stated something about different systems as if there was nobody there that could adjust the price of a pizza. Bad business. There are lots of pizza options. Choose a place that actually values your patronage.,hwZVKDco3hjuM_6CX2MyNw,1,0,1,67N30iCYSeEoUdUH2mgEow

We didn't know they closed at 9:30 for take out but the lady inside still took our order and when we got there, they said take out is closed and we can't receive our food. Solid waste of time. They were all outsides smoking blunts when we got there.",u3_RXRt7pQMOJDRr26OX3Q,1,0,1,8eZM4jIRh8yYo4EKzHgJIQ

I ordered extra cheese and it looked like normal amount cheese once it arrived. Gave the store a call, he gave me a free pizza for the trouble on my next order.  When I ordered it the next time, it was absolutely perfect because Cam put a note in the computer about it. When I ordered this time, I called after placing the mobile order just to make sure they actually put a legit amount of cheese on it so I could avoid any problems like the first time. Guess who answered? Cameron. Guess who said he remembered my name and already took care of it? Cameron. What. A. Boss. 
! Oh, and their delivery guys are so fast and so nice. We had Keith tonight. Our pizza was here in 25 minutes. Boom! Happy customer alert!
And btw, I'm adding a picture of these cheesy goodness so you see what you get when you pay for extra cheese and Cameron is on the job.",vPTs4B-c2jZU-StZKTmuJA,0,0,5,rIe6SKE52tWFNhjaYGdZPw

But I always order for delivery but something in my order is always wrong or missing :/ The garlic sauces are missing, my toppings are wrong, my wing orders are missing/ wrong, and when ordering a drink or dessert it always ends up being forgotten.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,2,1,2,E_FKhaN8kx2WkSbKAkZS0w

There are always deals on the website/app or online coupons you can find easy via google. I just learned papa johns now has the pizza tracker too...a link is included in your confirmation email when you place an order online or through the app. Love!,sxxL6TjvDolUE7GeWBRZrg,0,0,5,ULUm7hrnzuhr_yy6wjOlJQ
