The food was fresh, tasty & well spiced. I rarely eat American style Chinese food, but eat authentic Asian food most days. This was a wonderful change of pace.

Every other order there is a mistake; nothing to stop me from ordering again, but white rice instead of brown, not enough sauce, forgot the ginger, etc. This last time... Will be the LAST time I order from them! Horrible customer service, the woman on the phone blatantly told me I was a liar when I said I had used the Yelp email coupon for free delivery and even showed the delivery guy what my total should be in confirmation as opposed to what the receipt he wanted me to sign said. When you give your order over phone, they barely speak English so often have to repeat multiple times and when you question, she walks away from phone or says ok and then gets order wrong. Delivery guy speaks no English either. It's so frustrating! But to treat a customer so blatantly ugly is just inexcusable. 
       Oh yes, she tried to call me back and say she made a mistake, only after eat24/Yelp called them and told them to call me, but too little too late...

The chicken teriyaki was bland and the recipe needs an overhaul. We all felt ill after the meal.

A miss on both. 

But their simple fresh sushi rolls were pretty good. Spicy tuna was spicy, very cold though, felt like they froze their tuna before serving! But their yellowtail was perfect!

The seaweed salad was good, and the white rice was fluffy. Other than that, not a fan.

This may help some people: they DEFINITELY use MSG and a lot of it. I had a horrible allergic reaction not long after we ate dinner. Full body hives, itchy throat and the works :-( I wish Chinese restaurants would stop using it, it's so unhealthy and causes so many bad reactions.

I really wanted to have an amazing, satisfying Chinese ""go-to"" within minutes of my house but China AAA didn't ""bring it!"". We were a family of 6 tonight, we ordered kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice, lemon chicken, chow mein, potstickers and won ton soup. 
The good:  won ton soup, kung pao chicken and chicken fried rice.
The meh: chow mien
The bad: pot stickers 
The ugly:  lemon chicken
I'll start with the good... The  wonton soup had great flavour, lots of vegetables, nice large juicy pieces of shrimp and meat, the kung pao chicken was very flavourful, had lots of fresh vegetables and peanuts (YUM) and with just enough heat that my kids didn't gag. The chicken fried  rice was also very tasty and had a decent amount of chicken and mixed vegetables without being too greasy, it's hard to go wrong with chicken fried rice IMO. The meh, you know, the chow mien was just ok, a decent filler, but thats it....Now for the bad... I did not like texture of the potstickers they were wrinkly, charred and stick to your teeth gummy.  And now for the ugly...the lemon chicken was breaded and pounded flat, reminiscent of school lunchroom chicken. I was looking for shape and texture and it wasn't there. There is an offer for free egg rolls with your order, Im not positive but I  believe the minimum amount is $25, but they won't give it to you unless you ask for it...
The service was just average.  Bottom line:  the wonton soup, kung pao chicken and chicken fried rice were good enough to get again so I will be back for those. The service and staff were fair,  no smiles, just doing the job.",f3670JXvEcEbTvqBc1Igrw,1,0,3,xaUSkPnMK8xL340bbtUUkw

The Orange chicken merely tasted sweet. Not orange. just sweet. Like all they did was used colored corn syrup. Same exact thing can be said for the lemon ""sauce"". The fact that the orange sauce and the lemon sauce and the egg drop soup all looked identical should have been a warning.
The sesame beef was pretty much the only thing we ordered that had actual flavor, but that flavor was an overpowering sesame. I wish I had something good to say about this place.

My husband and I love Chinese food... But we don't always know where to go in the area around our house. All of the places are brand new to us. So this time we decided to look up something on Yelp and try it out. Wow... All I can say is... This totally paid off. We've ordered from other neighboring places before... And those have not really worked out. Not only did those places not work out... But they were absolutely terrible. This was a huge gamble. 

I didn't keep close track of the time, but I know that the amount of time from when I placed the order to the moment they showed up at the door was so fast that I was actually confused and thought a neighbor was knocking at our door. That right there was incredible... I know pizza places that take way longer than that. 

The food was just so... Delicious. My husband and I were so happy.

I saw the reviews were either great or horrible so I didn't know what to think,  and just prayed it would at least  be average. My prayers were not received.   

We ordered pick up through yelp,  it gave us a crazy wait time, so I called to verify time.   They told me the correct wait time,  and then got a message through yelp as well with updated wait time.   They were ready about 10 minutes after time estimate with the food.   The bag was heavy as heck so I thought,  ok good portions that's great,  and prices are low maybe there is hope... 

So we got crab rangoons,  chicken fried rice,  normal fried rice,  orange chicken,  and the Singapore noodle. 

Crab Rangoon was OK, only thing that was not awful. However,  the dipping sauce had the weirdest after taste.  It was like concentrated tap water.   Also no spicy mustard sauce in the bag we got just lots of soy sauce,  which makes no sense with the items we had.   

Fried rice was obviously loaded with msg.  It had that heavy salt and almost chemical flavor.   The onions were still to raw and took over.   

Orange chicken dry just like the other reviewer had stated,  and the flavor was one note.   It just looked congealed and sad. 

I didn't touch the noodles because I couldn't handle spice that night.. And I was mildy afraid at this point.

CRAB RANGOON  (8 Pcs) $4.95 ok/so-so.  I'd say the ones from Panda is better.  
CUCUMBER SUNOMONO SALAD= typical salad.  Not bad.  
HOUSE SPRING ROLLS 2 for $2.95....It had a surprise..not all veggies and had a big shrimp in it.  

So....for now....they got three STARS.   Not bad.  I like to try it again for second chance before they go on the GREEN list or RED list.  

They get a bonus thumbs up for DELIVERY and only cost $2.00.  That's pretty reasonable considering how much gas costs nowadays.  

It's pretty good when you're sick and can't fix yourself some food or go and get some.",LT1Lsa0zLR7RkPUGsLiy3w,4,1,3,B7v7dWteLoEvJrBWEKda_Q

Never was an order incorrect, were we disappointed with the amount of food for the price or did we have a complaint of any kind. We're about to place another takeout order and I felt that it was finally time to share a review. Give this place a try, but remember that the minimum order is $10.00 and the delivery fee is $2. I really like the Hong Kong Chow Mein; the vegetarian in the family has tofu options and there are appetizers for the family to share as well. The hubby loves the Orange Chicken (old faithful).

I placed my order at around 8:30pm and my food was here before 9pm which was shocking because normally places take extra long. I was already very pleased.
The food was also great! I ordered the chow fun noodles, beef w/ spicy garlic sauce and honey walnut shrimp; which were ALL GOOD! The honey walnut shrimp was seriously the best I've ever had. It has a hint of lemon in there which made it super good and not too rich. The portions were perfect as well.

We searched Yelp for Chinese delivery and decided to try this place. 

The poke salad was awful. I know it's fish, but it tasted fishy and had an overwhelming smell of fish. I hesitated, but tasted it. It tasted like metal and seaweed. 

The Pad Thai...ummm...if you even want to call it Pad Thai. It was bland and the chicken was questionable. Not sure it was even chicken. Plus, it didn't even have crushed peanuts. Don't bother ordering this. 

The orange chicken and fried rice were the only things that were edible. Even if this was the only thing we ordered, I'd only give this place 3 stars.

We enjoy the Hong Kong style crispy noodles, fried rice and orange chicken. Our least favorite is their honey walnut shrimp. The first time it tasted funny like floral and bitter. We called and they apologized explaining that someone might have put too much lemon powder. They gave us a credit which is why we decided to go back a second time. The second time we went back we decided to order the honey walnut shrimp again. This time I didn't go and sent my sister. They let her try it before she left and she said it was ok and better than before. However when she brought it home and I tried it, I still didn't like it. Although the floral and bitter flavor wasn't strong, it was still noticeable and present. My husband and I both could not stomach it.

I feel like the ""spicy"" was more than what I got when I ordered ""very spicy"". Either way, they both COMPLETELY lacked on heat. 

When I order ""very spicy"", I want my mouth to be on fire. This was as mild as can be. No kidding, it had ZERO heat. It's like they don't pay attention to customer's orders and make whatever they want.

So far I've ordered the moo goo chicken (if you like things on the light side), the Singapore noodle (if you like curry), the chow fun, and Kong Pao chicken. For chow fun, I hate it when all the rice noodles are clumped together and when you eat it, one side has seasoning and the other side is just plain white. The rice noodles in chow fun does not do that here. This is when I can tell the chef is skilled. Kong Pao chicken is just what I expected also. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm craving some Chinese take outs!

P.S. I'm not sure about the non-typical Chinese dishes that's on the menu and I don't think I will ever try it. If you want pad Thai, go to a Thai restaurant, if you want sushi or raw fish, go to a Japanese restaurant. Why would you want to eat non-Chinese dishes at a Chinese restaurant is out of my concern, but I can guarantee that you will be disappointed. Don't let the menu fool you.
