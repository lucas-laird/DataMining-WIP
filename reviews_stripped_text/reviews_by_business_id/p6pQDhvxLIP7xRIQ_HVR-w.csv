774719,2017-03-03,0,p6pQDhvxLIP7xRIQ_HVR-w,"I would just like to comment on The Ultimate BEST Port of Subs in Las Vegas,  and probably the State of Nevada!!! It starts when you walk through the front door.  You are greeted by the owners,  a lovely couple who have made this restaurant a very awesome place to come and enjoy a relaxing, delicious lunch! You also feel a sense of pride in their business,  because the restaurant is always clean and well organized from the lobby,  to the food line.  It's always stocked and looking deliciously inviting, and very clean and well presented.  They are always smiling and very happy to see you again, and make your order to your specifications.  It's that personal touch, and caring personality that makes me love their restaurant so much!!! I think that the Corporation of Port of Subs should recognize their restaurant for being The Best one on the Planet in every aspect from the front door,  to the back door, including the restrooms!!  It's a 5 star store! So if you want a fabulous atmosphere,  great food, and friendly caring people who are grateful for your business,  then visit Port of Subs on West Flamingo and Jones!! You'll say,  wow! That lady really knew what she was talking about!!!.....Yes I do!",tGVpgmkarOSxVp4J3oru9Q,0,0,5,kMHQf2thx4Xq6FVtAcu2KA
981122,2012-10-11,1,p6pQDhvxLIP7xRIQ_HVR-w,I used to eat here regularly for years then new owners took over and I heard they were not good and stingy with the extras so did not go back. But a few months ago I decided I just wanted a sub really bad and they are just around the corner from me so gave it a try again. First time we had a little communication problem because I want my sub just so and they wanted to go fast. I was the only 1 in there at that time so asked them to slow down. Today was the 3rd time in the past 2 months I went and everything went great. Many tables full and the help is excellent and so courteous. The place is spotless. Best Sub I had had in a long time. Think they just needed to adjust and slow down and listen to what customer wants. Fast is not always great. All extras fresh and plentiful. Love when they always have jalapenos.,qykHInytjng9e8nrJa5VzQ,0,0,5,iutgBrGTKFdyZBxI_U2RIA

I have noticed that the sandwiches they make are skimpier than other Port of Subs locations. They put exactly two small napkins in your bag. (There are no napkin dispensers out for customers to take them like other places.) If you ask for more, they yell at you. The attitude they have is one of ""cheap"" instead of ""pleasing"".  They also do not take corporate coupons.",d7PExbmCMloi87tLvKeudA,2,0,3,Imivn28sRNMbddwtxCM2og

Their store is always clean and stocked. They greet you when you come in and always remember the way you like your sandwich made, and I am very picky. Their condiments are always stocked and fresh, and I feel that makes a huge difference on the taste and freshness of your sub. I refuse to ever eat at any other port of sub's, because when you have perfection, you can't duplicate that... I feel that the corporate office of Port of Sub's needs to pay a visit to this Awesome store to fully appreciate how unbelievably Great it is, and then they should give them an award for the Best on the Planet!!! 5million Stars!!!!!!",LnOAKIcZQHV-TICzEfq5pg,0,1,5,gfKgQ8CqR4ulSkpk8e7cmA
2081011,2015-01-12,4,p6pQDhvxLIP7xRIQ_HVR-w,"Port of Subs is one of my favorite sandwich shops. I always get the 12"" number 9, which is turkey and provolone on white bread. I add the mayo/mustard mix, lettuce, tomato, peperoncini, pickles, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and it makes for a delicious and filing sandwich. This particular location is family owned, and you can tell they care a lot about the store. The whole store was sparkling clean, from the make line to the tables and the floor. I will definitely be back when I am craving a sub sandwich.

Port of Subs does not have the ""Wow"" of Capriottis or some of the other non-chain places but I know what I'm getting and without an insane amount of calories/points.  
  This location is spotless and the owner (I don't know her name) is friendly, cheerful & gracious (unlike some of the other sandwich establishments where the apathetic-usually-teenaged-or-unmotivated-20-something-staff could care less about you or your order and in most cases screw your order up...)

5522427,2014-07-29,1,p6pQDhvxLIP7xRIQ_HVR-w,"They don't deliver. Well, that may not be true--when I called to try and place an order for delivery, she asked if it was a catering order. Unlike the South Rainbow location, which the Port of Subs website says offers delivery but in fact does not, this location is listed on the website as offering delivery with a $50 minimum order. Which makes it sound more akin to just catering orders, but given the fact that a lot of other reviewers have indicated skimpy portioning practices and scarcity of included napkins, one can draw some conclusions about the location and its service as a whole.
The lady seemed friendly enough for somebody who wasn't actually really apologetic about the fact their location won't deliver unless (possibly) you pony up some serious dough for sandwich fixins, but after I called the location down south on Badura and had not only a great sandwich delivered to my location (which no other Port of Subs in the area would do) but a very pleasant time talking to the attendant who double-checked my order and ensured I knew about any prospective delays, menu options or pricings, I won't likely stop by this location because let's face it--there's a better one that brings the sandwich *to me*.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,1,0,3,Gis2AO0_iPwvNAmJ-q78TA
