They were having a stressful day because it was national ice cream day. So they were busy I get that. But the little African American girl working the register had an attitude with everyone and laughed at customers. She even had the nerve to cuss and say fuck this, fuck you, and what the fuck. Like seriously?! These are the people you employ? She needs to be fired. I'm contacting corporate and finding out who the district and regional manager are. You don't cuss at me sweet heart I'll make sure you end up on the unemployment line. And tonight when I went there she gave me an attitude at the drive thru and kept slamming the window shut on me. I'm going to tell the better business bureau about them too. They're so rude here and the managers don't even speak English when you try to tell them about their awful employees.

1813822,2017-07-30,0,tzLBPCVz6uB7vWgDTU6Ujw,"This is hands down the worst McDonalds I have been too.  I pull up and order a muffin with egg and cheese meal. They ask me what I would like to drink and I tell them a Large Dr.Pepper. They advise me they're out of all coke products, so I ask for a ice coffee. When I pull up they tell me my total which had an extra charge for adding a ice coffee. That already upset me because I had to pay for the meal which includes the drink but had to pay an extra 1.49 to get the ice coffee. Whatever I let that go. Than I pull up to the window and the woman ask me what I order..... I told her a sandwich... She looks at me and says welll what kind of sandwich I tell her what it was. Than she closes the window without saying anything. I mean I feel like I've been to McDonald's enough to know they should have my order on their screen. When she comes back she hands me just a sandwich and closes the window. LOL so I wait for the rest of my order. A guy comes to the window I tell him that I'm missing my hash brown and my ice coffee and hand him the receipt. He looks at the receipt and closes the window. Again without saying anything to me. While the window was closed I look at my sandwich and my muffin is burnt. A little burnt is okay and I'm not picky but this muffin was burnt and hard! So when he comes back to the window he hands me a large vanilla ice coffee. The ice coffee looks like it has no ice. I tell him my sandwich is burnt and he asks me to pull up to the parking spot and takes the sandwich. As I pull up I take a drink of the ice coffee which I notice there is ice in the cup it just feels like it's very small as if it had melted. When i take a drink it taste like it had been sitting out and the ice had melted. I was so upset at this point. So I go inside and tell the cashier she was the only one that smiled the whole time at me as well. She made me another ice coffee and it was great! Than I tell her hey I'm also waiting for my sandwich and that I was in the drive thru and my sandwich was burnt. She's like okay well did they tell you to pull forward. I was like yes they did but I'm going to wait in here tell it's done. I waited like 10 minutes seeing people order and get their food. I went up to another cashier and told her I've been waiting a while now and I still haven't gotten my sandwich. She tells her supervisor and than 2 minutes later here is my sandwich. By the time I went to my car my hash brown is now cold and I'm even more upset. What makes me really angry about it is that not one person apologized for anything. Not one. Not even the manager. Now I understand we all make mistakes and things happen. But I have never had such horrible service with such disrespect for customers ever.",-537A2EbsqHJejSx-JKKfA,0,0,1,i92b0h6FhxHAtD7RkX-_Kg

The drive through was packed, so I parked at the convenience store parking and went inside.  The staff was very friendly.  The only issue I had was with adding to my Arch card account.  They couldn't remember how to do it.  After awhile, a light bulb went off and I had some money loaded on the card.

I got my Oreo McFlurry and I sat in the restaurant to enjoy it.  It was good--typical McDonald's--it's the same at each location.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  There was a table that needed clearing but other than that, it was neat.  There's also free wifi which made checking my email a breeze.  It was very snappy.

There are some pictures on the walls that look like they are made of jigsaw puzzle pieces. One was of Ray Croc.  I couldn't tell if they were real puzzle pieces or if the art had been designed to just look that way.

We go to this one the most (though we really don't eat fast food on  a large scale anyway, ever since, our lifestyle changes), the Drive-Thru window mostly, and on occasion, inside too (clean, locals). This one is about the same distance from our home, as the one at Paradise/Sahara (way more tourists and way more cars at the Drive-Thru too), but this one is less crowded. Inside is a little smaller, than most locations, since it's sharing space with the Terrible's Gas Station and Convenience Mart.

Since we only get three items on the menu, our order's pretty easy (cone sundae, or sandwich), so it's usually right. There are usually a few cars in the Drive-Thru window too, BTW. But it's never too long of a wait.

My husband and I were in Las Vegas for our honeymoon in June of 2013. On our way out of town we decided to stop at this McDonald's. My husband and I both ordered the double quarter pounder combo. 

They were so good that my husband STILL talks about it. Every time we go to a McDonald's in California, where we live, he always compares it back to this location's food.

The woman who took our order, I clearly remember because she was so happy!! She was an older woman who greeted us as soon as we pulled up, told us to take our time, we pull up to the window and she greets us there with a huge smile and asking us how we are. I wish we had gotten her name or I saved the receipt because she was just the nicest woman ever!! 

The food was completely cooked, not under or over cooked. The hamburgers were hot, the french fries were actually cooked the right way, none were soggy and none were too hard. 

Great food and great customer service!!
