The food was amazing and the service was awesome! We got to meet one of the managers named Doug and he was such a blast to talk to! 

Pros: 

- the ambiance was incredible, felt like you were in a coastal home enjoying a home cooked meal.

- the food was delicious. I come from a family that cooks Mexican food almost every meal and it was fresh, tasty, and beautifully plated.

- the servers were quick on refills of drinks, chips, and salsas. Super friendly and accommodating. 

- Doug was so friendly and really made us feel at home. We are coming back specifically because of him!

- the live music was just loud enough to hear, but never overwhelming. 

- all in all, such a great experience. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this place! I have already recommended it to everyone I work with. 

Cons: 

- my only con is that they close pretty early. I felt guilty still eating almost half an hour after they closed.

I hope nothing but the best for this place, and I will be back again VERY soon!!",yfGE-f7nxLpIWrsVaqSb-w,2,0,5,ZZPK6MjLW_yo3doR6hYakQ

The brunch is supposed to come with fresh fruit and champagne, neither was offered to us by the waiter.  I had to ask about the fruit and it was brought out towards the end of the meal rather than a starter.  Never offered champagne.  Then I asked about the bunuelos  which are also included with brunch.  Waiter came back with flan because they did not have any more bunuelos.

The first negative sign was when we nearly finished our chips and salsa before our order was even taken. The second negative was when I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and never received it. After our main entrees arrived I mentioned this to our server and he apologized and later gave an additional discount which was very nice. The last negative was food quality. Let's be honest, most Mexican sit downs seem to taste the same unless they have a signature stand out dish/item, or the style of cooking/preparation is different. Pancho's was no different. There was nothing about their food that justified the price point. 

Unfortunately,  we didn't even stay to use  the Yelp fried ice cream offer. We paid and left. However, I had the last laugh and ordered a second helping of the free chips and salsa...",DUdvqIDmNjPyDj-8jNbPpg,4,0,2,w23e3oAueIM8iArY4szakA

301417,2015-11-13,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"I just don't see how this place is going to last.  The prices are just too high for the quality of food provided. The only reason I went was because of the happy hour half off appetizers and discounted drinks.   

The chips were cold and seemed like the type of cheap chips you'd get at a grocery store.   And the salsa was completely uninspiring -- typical boring, tasteless, spiceless garden salsa that could've easily come from a grocery store bottle.  I asked if they had a hotter, habanero type salsa -- and was provided with habanero Tabasco sauce (I like Tabasco sauce, but not exactly what I was looking for)

Tried the naughty maggie Margarita.   Found it to be no more interesting than a standard Margarita. 

My main dish was the queso fundido appetizer (it was just me, so the large appetizer was a full meal).  Well, it looked nothing like what I'm used to seeing with queso fundido at other Mexican restaurants.... looked more like a plate of sour cream. Flavor was okay but not something I would order again. .. and had I paid the usual full $16 price for this appetizer, I would've been very disappointed...instead of just moderately disappointed.  

When the check arrived,  the happy hour discount amount for what I ordered was incorrect so that had to be fixed.  But it actually couldn't be fixed and instead I had to be given an additional dollar off (so double check the pricing for those going for the happy hours deals).  And I was charged the full price on the Margarita because apparently that was not part of the happy hour special discounted drinks (something that was not clearly explained by my waitress when I ordered.... even though I had expressly asked her about the drink specials just before I ordered it -- so she clearly knew where my head was at and allowed me to order the non-discounted drink instead ..... a little bit deceptive if you ask me).  

I'm sorry to say but there is just nothing good to report about this place. I hope the restaurant that takes over this place after they inevitably close does a complete overhaul.   I had high hopes for this place,  but having gotten a small bad taste, there is simply no reason for me to ever come back and try anything else.

If Yelp allowed for zero stars, that would've been my rating.

Would someone please message me and tell me where I can get some decent very spicy, but smooth salsa in this city!!  Is that too much to ask for?",4BN6fq_Glvkgx6Su8dUiAQ,1,0,1,99lcC5xkuAsOCO1CarF3sg

510413,2017-05-04,1,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"So today I experienced Pancho's for the first time. I walked in with our party and was treated to live guitar music from the bar area stage. Nice way to set the mood. Short wait then our party of 16 was seated. Chips were average, while warm, still tasted commercial grade not fresh. Salsa was meh, no heat at all. Once again, commercial grade. But the wait staff did replenish them in a timely fashion. I ordered a Blue Ribbon Margarita. It came out in a basic margarita glass you find in any Mexican restaurant, salt on the rim etc, plenty of ice. Took a sip and it was room temp.. If a margarita is on the rocks, shouldn't it be shaken? I decided to let it chill, so it could chill. The margarita was like the glass, basic. As I looked at the menu the Enchiladas de Langosta (Lobster) stuck out to me. Seemed like a winner so I ordered it. Salad came first with the Pancho's vinaigrette, nothing special, red and green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, and chickpeas (I believe). Nothing spectacular, middle of the road as far as salads go. We didn't have to wait terribly long for our food to come out even at peak time (6 p.m.). My entree came out a fish shaped plate... different but I guess it distinguishes seafood entrees. Took a bite of the ""special"" green rice first, undercooked and bland. Then took a bite of my enchilada, tasted ok as did the black beans. Took another bite with the sour cream, and guac. Took a third bite with the sour cream and guac where I could really distinguish the lobster. After this bite I took a long pause, I could feel a slight wave of nausea wash over me. I was puzzled as to why this was happening. I sat for a second to see if the feeling would pass, it didn't. I asked a waiter for the restroom and proceeded there. Handicap stall, in use, regular stall FILTHY, and added to my nausea. Waited a few min for the feeling to pass, went back to my table. I sat back down after a few minutes and engaged in casual conversation. I decided to try my meal again. This time I scraped off the sour cream and guac and dug through the enchilada to just get a piece of lobster by itself. 1-2 minutes after I ingested it, I got felt that familiar uneasiness from my stomach. Im convinced the lobster or the sour cream was the culprit. I gave up on my meal and ordered a Sprite. The Sprite helped somewhat but I still felt uneasy and ventured again to the restroom. Light was off when I entered, regular stall, still FILTHY. The handicap stall was still locked and I then realized that it was not in use the first time, but locked from the inside. I assume this was for a reason and cringed at the potential horrors it could have contained. I sweated it out for a few minutes at the sink, and was able to keep my composure. At this point I gave up on Pancho's, and decided for my gastro intestinal well being to cut my losses. I texted a coworker to let my boss know I was leaving as I wasn't feeling well. I drove home swiftly, immediately grabbed a ginger ale to settle my stomach and aid me in completing this review while the memory was still fresh, which is more than I can say for my meal. Pancho's..

627366,2016-05-16,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Quite possibly the worst 'Mexican' food I have ever had.  I have traveled all over Mexico - even lived in Oaxaca for the better part of a year - and I have never seen anything like this there!  I think it's an attempt at 'Tex-Mex,' that horrible sauce laden aberration that comes from the land of George W. Bush.  I had a chili-relleno and a cheese enchilada.  Of course, both were drowning in the same horrible red sauce (thank you, Texas) but the cheese was strictly American and the Chili was barely cooked.  It was so crunchy, it bordered on raw.  What once may have existed as an eggy batter was musched up with that gross sauce, I mean:  just disgusting!  Anyone claiming that this is 'Authentic' should be flogged.  The only Latino faces in the place belonged to the servers who, I am sure, were secretly apologizing every time they lay down a plate.  The price is as bad as the food - at least 30% more than it should be if not 50%.  $7.50 for a glass of Dos XX in the middle of Sunday afternoon?  Puleeeeeze!!!

We came on a Sunday around 1:00. They had a brunch menu in addition to a dinner menu. Huge selection of entrees on the dinner menu, all ranging from 17.95 and up. The four adults in our party all agreed that there wasn't anything special about the food. I had a chimichunga and the chicken was super dry and the shell was over fried. Rice, no Bueno. The menu also stars at the bottom 10.95 minimum per person. Seriously!  Not sure if they would have enforced it. 

They brought some of our drinks in plastic cups. For $18/person you ought to be able to put the drink in a glass. 

Kids meals were $10 each as well. Fine if you don't want to cater to kids but seriously. My son had a pizza and before you say it... yes, don't order pizza at a Mexican restaurant.

It's all about the taste and quality of the food. I will pay $30 for a $30 steak. I will pay more if I am in a casino or high tourist area. I expect quality if I am going to pay this much and this place failed miserably.",faKqh7zKcaZzr1luUSBWZQ,4,0,2,nLqe4aTqjrFc-6TfBIpUnQ

If yelp had another category on venue you  would score a 5++++ 

The food on the other side was a disappointment, really once I walkin I fell in love with the ambiance. During our meal I was still wanted to find reasons to go back! 

Sadly we won't. 
 *The chips and salsa were good portions the salsa, taste and looks like the the Tostitos salsa from Costco and the chips are not consistent half of them stale half of them good.
* Order a appetizer fried taquitos flavorful but odd to serve with Verde tomatillo sauce. Weird it wasn't spicy I guess it was for dipping didn't think it needed. Chichen was moist beef was ok.
*They don't offer agua Fresca's only soda product not house made lemonade.
*The abondigas soup broth was too thick the meatball itself was very flavorful and traditional but the broth and vegetables lacked seasoning.
* ordered Lobster enchiladas they came with black beans green rice the green rice was blend no salt not sure if it was supposed to be cilantro rice enchiladas were okay black beans  good.
* Then ordered chicken green mole was horrible so much cumin and bland. Accompanied with red rice and pinto beans the rice and beans were the best part of the whole meal.
This is not an authentic Mexican style restaurant it caters more to the American palette, the has no indication of what real Mexican food should taste like.

In summerlin people act like they have money. The prices didn't bother me as much as the food is not worth the price. If the food was outstanding I wouldn't mind paying for great food and the amazing atmosphere the venue has. 

The service staff on the other hand was very polite very cordial very helpful. Service staff was great so they get a a 5-star! :)",NA6fxvAMLAORgvJhkr8QAw,4,1,1,CPQkIGqIzyp-NdBS4YQu9A

My experience at Pancho's was spectacular! It was just what I was looking for to start my weekend after a very long Friday at work. When I walked in, I felt as if I was transported to the middle of a Mexican jungle, instantly all my work stress was left at the door. The lush greenery, authentic aztec/mayan relics, stained glass windows, and beautiful water fountain created a very calming and soothing ambiance, in what was still a very busy restaurant. The wait time was brief. When I got my table, I ended up getting seated upstair. This was great because I received a wonderful view of the entire restaurant. Sitting upstair you could really get an expansive view of all the detail that went into designing this restaurant.

As soon as I sat down, I was greeted with warm chips and delicious salsa. The waiter was extremely professional and instantly introduced himself. He asked if we had been here before and then began to give us the story of Pancho's. Very interesting story, I had no idea the history and tradition of this place that dates all the way back to 1945 in Southern California. 

The menu at Pancho's is extensive. They serve classic items like a combination plate but I suggest exploring one of the many authentic dishes they have to offer. In particular their seafood section! I ended up going with Enchiladas de Langosta however the Shrimp Diabla Puffy Tacos did catch my eye. While I waited for my dinner, I ordered a Naughty Maggie Margarita (A MUST ORDER AFTER A LONG WEEK OF WORK)! This was one of the best margaritas I have had in Nevada, 3 or 4 of these and you are in for quite the night. As I finished off my chips and salsa I was quickly replenished with more before I could even ask, love this type of service! Especially when the chips and salsa are this tasty. When I received my meal, it was fresh out of the oven, the cheese was still bubbling and I was warned of the hot plate. These enchiladas were excellent, the lobster was cooked and seasoned nicely and the chipotle cream sauce stole the show. It was accompanied with delicious rice and beans. Very large portions, I was extremely full and I highly recommend this dish. 

After enjoying my dinner, I got up and headed downstairs to the bar. When I walked into the bar, I was excited to see the ample amounts of space and TVs. I sat at the bar and ordered another Naughty Maggie Margarita which was of course accompanied with some more chips and salsa! I thought I was full but ended up finding some extra room for them...I guess they were that good! The bar was perfect, comfy seating, great margs, beautiful women, and lots of sports.

As the games were ending, I noticed that a band was setting up. At this point, I was ready to leave but wanted to know what was going on. The manager, Abbott (very nice guy), informed me that there is live entertainment 7 days a week. He told me, the entertainment consist of comedy, karaoke, and live music depending on the night. I was thrilled as I knew this would be my next date spot, I mean who does not like live entertainment and strong drinks! I ended up staying to hear a few songs from the band. Classic rock cover songs, yes please!!!! 

I highly recommend Pancho's for any occasion and definitely suggest checking it out for yourself. The atmosphere alone is worth the trip!",zjiwy4RiBVR48XhUClOufQ,0,0,5,c-gKwLKgsIRYGvpDwSQV_g

The wait for a table on a Saturday evening was about an hour so we decided to eat in the bar area. Well, we were informed you can only be served drinks and appetizers in the bar. Really? Big mistake, Pancho's! I know of no other restaurant with such a ridiculous policy. The margaritas were okay and we liked the chips and salsa. Bar waitress was fabulous and fun. I did notice that the Tiffany style chandeliers (I don't know how these fit the Mexican theme) over the bar were an afterthought as they were run on exposed electrical conduit which perplexed me as the building was just constructed.
 
We were called to the dining area after approximately 45 minutes but of the 5-6 hostesses ready to seat us, not one had a clue of what to do and we waited more than 5 minutes at the hostess stand while they figured it out.  Upon entering the dining room, I literally felt as if I had walked into a jungle. The place is filled with an extreme, almost obnoxious,  amount of artificial plants and trees. Clearly the concept of ""less is more"" was lost on the designers. The lighting is very bright (might want to heavily consider dimming in the evenings) and there was no background music playing so we weren't impressive with the atmosphere. Our waiter was very good and attentive which made for a pleasant dining experience. I had the lobster enchiladas (really delicious!) and my husband had chicken chimichanga (he liked it but it didn't knock his socks off).

1069230,2015-12-14,1,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Went to Pancho's on Saturday December 12th for the first time and sat in the bar area with my five girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. The first thing you should know is there is nothing on the menu that is less than $20.00 except for the taco salad that was $16.99 and a few appetizers that were $18.99. Now, I am not cheap and I don't mind paying for a good meal so I was expecting with these prices to have great food and great service to celebrate my friend's birthday. We were sadly disappointed. 

The taco salad was pretty much just lettuce and sour cream with a few beans (not exaggerating - maybe 7 beans throughout) and a very small amount of ground beef at the bottom with a couple chips (again not exaggerating - probably 2 chips total). The Queso Fundido was tasteless. Oh and I could smell the Ceviche my friend ordered from 5 feet away- I was convinced she was going to get food poisoning from rotten fish. As it stands, I cannot guarantee she didn't - food poisoning and too much alcohol cause similar symptoms... 

The food was not even the worst of it though...the service was horrible!  Our waitress Adriana/Ariana was terrible! She was so slow. Took 20 minutes just to get our first drinks and another 20 minutes to get some chips. Then the worst part of the entire night - THE BILL...(cue the horror music). The bill took 2 hours (again not exaggerating - we finished eating at 9pm and we were there until 11pm figuring out the damn bill). Why? Because Adriana/Ariana had apparently never rung up a bill in her life. From the 5 of us, she split the bill for 3 on one and 2 on another. I was on the bill with the 3. One of my friends on that bill payed in cash and the other two of us said to split the rest of the check. I'm sure you could see how this could go wrong - She could only charge one of us...she could not split it evenly...she could charge us for the completely separate bill for the other two girls at our table..wait! Yes! You read that right...she charged us EACH for the other bill at the table. So round and round we go for 2 damn hours. In the end,  I still show a pending charge on my bank account for $53.00 for my taco salad and a coke...when it should have been $26.00. 

I know what you're thinking, you would have asked to speak with a manager and cleared the whole thing up - no need for this drama mama's review. But you would be wrong because I asked to see the manager TWICE and no manager ever came. In fact, no other waiter PRETENDING to be the manager even came (yes, I used to work in food service and this happened all the time). After two hours, I couldn't wait anymore and I wasn't going to make a scene and embarrass my girlfriend on her birthday so I left...

Please don't waste your money here, folks. It's too bad because the band was actually pretty good and the place is really beautiful (decor and such). Worst dining experience ever.",AXYSomQL9fApiW-AXDZXbA,5,1,1,ouSsVyvAd2NzP1qM8KfjpQ
1075543,2015-11-08,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"I would give a 3-1/2 stars for food and price but because of the decor I gave 4 stars. Had the tacos de pescados. The mahi mahi was grilled well, not rubbery but just a tad dry. Tried the fish by itself and it was good but once you add the sides, lemon, and sauce then the taco was really good! The rice was decent and the beans were ok. They melted the cheese on the beans I believe with a torch, like you would with the sugar on creme brûlée. The chips were of medium thickness, not greasy, and the salsa was pretty good. One of the waiters offered us a free refill on chips and salsa which was a plus. I've read comments where a bowl of fruit is also complimentary but we didn't get any. Might have been a special or grand opening thing. Lastly, they added a nice little touch to the tacos. They pinned the tacos closed with a strip of bamboo (I believe) shaped into a sword (tied a knot at one end) and used radishes as stoppers. Check out the pic!

As for the decor, gorgeous! Just look at the pictures other people have uploaded. There is a nice little outdoor waiting area that is very charming. Slightly hidden and intimate. I looked at the colorful patterned tiles that were everywhere and from I can tell they are all hand painted or else stamped but none were completely identical. We were a table away from the fountain and didn't smell ""mold"" like what one person said in review. We walked by it and I took a whiff and didn't smell a thing. We did however get one of the two tables that is right next to the kitchen entrance. It was busy and kind of distracting but luckily no accidents this evening. The ""uniforms"" of the hostess' were a nice touch, subtle Mexican styled dresses. 

I would definitely come back but not as often due to the prices. This would be a great place to take friends and family for dinner due to the ""WOW"" factor of the decor. By far the coolest looking Mexican cuisine restaurants I've been to. Looking forward to trying the flan next time, it looks similar to how my mom makes them.",OvHYa3jg6ZJceNH1XU772w,0,0,4,n7WeqaSZlUH4fbAbp9pLyA

Let's start with the unfriendly and borderline snarky hostess.  I didn't get her name, but she had dark brown hair.  The restaurant is lit so darkly at the tables that you can barely see your food.  Which is probably what they intended so you can't see the horrible presentation of the plates.  I ordered the 2 cheese enchilada combo.  The enchiladas had so much cheese on top of them that that's all I could taste.  The rice was hard and not at all like any Mexican or Spanish rice that I've ever had.  How can you possibly serve awful Mexican rice at a Mexican restaurant?  My meal was under $20, which is completely overpriced!  My friend wasn't that hungry so she ordered a side of beans and rice.  The serving she got was baby sized and was $6.  My daughter ordered from the kid's meal a cheese quesadilla.  The kid's meal was $10 for a tiny quesadilla and hard rice.  Let me say that she's had better at Taco Bell.  The tortillas were hard as rocks on her quesadilla.  The flan I ordered for dessert was ok, but was drenched in cinnamon.  I've had Mexican food in many places, even in Mexico.  I've been to taquerias that were amazing and sad to say that I'd rather go to Taco Bell than ever return to this place.  The price point at this place does not match the quality of the food or the service.  The waiter was barely present until I asked our bus person if he could bring my dessert.  We were done with our plates a while, and our server never came back to ask if we were ready for dessert or how our meal was.  He did however bring us the check, and after picking it a back up he opened it right in front of me to see how much tip he received.  How completely rude and unprofessional!  He was a jerk period.  I don't mind paying this price for good food and good service, but this restaurant has neither of those things.

We were brought a complimentary glass of champagne and a small bowl of fruit while waiting for our food which by the way, was delivered quickly and perfectly hot (hate cold eggs!).  Neither of us ate the fruit, not sweet, out of season, appeared a bit old --  they should forego it altogether.   Overall a great experience, just a little surprised when we received the bill -- tax and our 20% tip (would have liked to have given more to Miguel to be honest) came to $90.00 total.  We each had one margarita,  one brunch item and we split a brownie dessert.

Decor gets 5 stars but the food is not good, bland on top of bland with an extra side of bland. Nothing we ate was good, service was nothing special, and the food is EXPENSIVE for what you get. I guess they figure they can price gouge you because its in downtown Summerlin.

The carnitas were tough, flavorless, and did not appear to be fresh. The carnitas burrito is $17.95, came topped with cold Chile queso sauce (bland) and not a side of rice and beans in sight. For 18 dollars.... Really? The side of guacamole was 8.95. For a modest scoop of once again, flavorless guacamole. I mean, there isn't an authentic thing about this place, the plates are garnished with parsley for goodness sakes. Where's the cilantro? The limes? The flavor?!?!?!

We paid our $71 tab (no alcohol) (for two people and a toddler) and walked out quietly. The first thing we said to each other when we got to the car was, ""never again."" Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, nope you won't fool me twice.

Have lived in Vegas 3 years and have not found - until today - a place that could make a chili verde that I actually loved. Today I found that place and its Panchos. 
Anyone complaining of price have obviously never been to a high quality Mexican restaurant as Panchos. 
They're prices are consistent with other restaurants and yet Panchos food is better.

I ordered chicken quesadilla for $16.95 and the chicken was shredded and tasted horrible. I have never seen shredded chicken quesadillas in somewhat of an upscale Mexican restaurant especially for the price that we got charged.  The shredded chicken is a low quality form of chicken that is very cost affective for restaurants . Most if not all Mexican restaurants, I've visited use grilled chicken breast instead. 

I returned the dish and decided to ordered the Tacos Al Carbon which suppose to have Carne Asada for almost $20.00. Guess what? The red meat used was not Carne Asada, it was low grade red meat with a dreadful rubbery after taste.  
We honestly did not mind the price and the atmosphere, but the quality of the food especially the meat products does not justify such high price on the menu. 
I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic and high quality Mexican food. We will definitely not visit this restaurant again.",8cfZtb94HO0Qrmk7L_kADA,6,0,1,x6uC4V9nU9MvNm42c5EAOw

We started with chips and salsa and queso. The chips were decent and salsa was good but nothing particularly delicious. 
The queso had mixed reviews at our table some members of our party loved it. Other hated it. If you are a fan of artichoke cream cheese dip you might be interested in this.

The steak salads were decent. Meat seemed overly salted but overall not bad. 
The chicken tacos were the flop of the evening. Extremely greasy and tasteless. 
The beans and rice were fair. 

The carnitas enchiladas were the favorite at the table. I recommend those out of all the dishes we tried. 

The fried ice cream was so - so. The only downfall was it was greasy... 

Mediocre food but the real kicker was the price of the food! $20 for two tacos with a small side of beans and rice is outrageous. 
That's the reason for the two stars. Average to below average Mexican cuisine at sky high prices.

The hostess takes us upstairs to our table. They aren't very observant. Maybe she should have asked if everyone in the party can get up the stairs...it would be a novel idea to offer the elevator. Waitresses and hostesses are plenty nice. 

Manager came by and asked how the queso fundido was. We said it could use a little more spice. Then suggested maybe a spicy one and a not spicy one for the menu.
Manager cracked a stupid sarcastic joke that maybe the restaurant could be half Chinese and half Mexican. He acted and looked like a clown. He was a jerk off.

I ordered the Carne Asada, the GF ordered the seafood chimichanga. The old folks ordered a combo dinner and a beef chimichanga. The Carne Asada they serve is a hunk of sirloin. It is tough and chewy. Authentic Carne Asada dishes are usually made with skirt steak. 

Girlfriend loved her seafood chimi. Heard no complaints from the olds regarding their food.

Bartender in the Bar was pleasant and helpful while we waited and the three waitresses were fun to talk to.

We ordered no alcohol with our dinner and the bill was well over $100.00

 The girlfriend said she prefers Robertos Taco Shop for tastiness of food and price. I agree with her.

Funny thing is that I have been to Panchos on Rosecrans 100s of times for over 30 years. I remember the food being better and the price not as expensive there.

For starters we had the guacamole. This was pretty good, and they were able to give it to me without cilantro! That's a big bonus for me, because I'm one of those people for whom cilantro tastes *terrible*. This also means they are more likely to have made it fresh, which I like.

My wife and I had entrées that were also good. The menu is so big that now, a few days later, I can't remember what I had. 

I think that is a good example for this restaurant and why it gets 3 stars instead of 4. I remember that it was good. I remember that I enjoyed it and that I would eat here again if I were in the area. I don't remember anything really stand-out or special about it enough to really remember what I ate.

1636807,2015-11-19,8,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Not a great meal.   The star is literally for the company and the nice looking building.  

I was yet again disappointed in another execution of so called Mexican food and why they think it's acceptable to charge so outrageously for. It's not like you get gold plated beans served here. In my opinion you can't even call it Mexican just because you stuff a tortilla with rice and beans. Maybe we are actually helping to pay for the building, décor and uniforms.  I actually was whishing I was at Café Rio since at least their rice is eatable instead of hard grains that can do some real tooth damage.

 The seafood burrito I ordered tasted like the seafood was one minute away from going bad.  It was just not okay by any stretch.  And it wasn't just my dish.  I think only 2 out of the 6 of us enjoyed their meal. The average isn't good. 

The server was okay in the begining and just got mediocre towards the middle and unhelpful at the end. They seem to put more emphasis in replenishing the chips than anything else, but too bad I didn't come here for the chips.

I can't even take a risk coming back to try something else.  Also if paying $$ for Mexican food makes you think it is high end or of better quality maybe you need to try a $ Mexican food place and compare... just for kicks. Que mala comida sirven aqui.

I've been watching this building come together for months so I was super excited to finally walk through the beautiful doors. 

When it comes to first impressions, it was love at first sight. A major wow factor! Whoever designed this place deserves 5 stars. They brought the beauty of Mexico to us in Vegas! It reminded me of the movie ~ Original Sin with Angelina Jolie. 

I do have one note about the design and that's the little room behind the beautiful staircase. I highly suggest that room is used for private parties & events only because customers don't get the true experience sitting there. We were guided over to it and I said no way, then we were sat in the lovely courtyard & I couldn't get enough of that space! Art, central fountain & greenery surrounded us and I loved it all. 

The service was fantastic & I'm even going to give a shoutout to Jason who took great care of us and was also very sweet & funny. 

The food was good, not amazing. I've definitely had better but everything also tasted better sitting in this space. We also only tried one thing but that's how it goes sometimes. We ordered the enchiladas de Langosta which were filled with lots of luscious lobster. Prices are high here but they definitely didn't gip us on the seafood. I also need to add that the portions are HUGE. We shared and couldn't even finish everything. 

The black beans lacked in flavor & were a tad undercooked. The green rice was perfect and the creamy chipotle sauce was super rich, a tad too rich for me. Overall it was good but not amazing.

But when we got there and saw the food they all told me it was a good choice. I loved the one in Manhattan Beach Ca. and they didn't disappoint and even had some of the same employees from Ca.. I see people complain about the price but the portions are really BIG. You can easily split a burrito and it would be plenty for 2 people.

1819328,2015-12-21,1,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"First off, if you are looking for the same michoacan garbage that is all over this city don't bother. This is Cali Mex, through and through. Fresh ingredients, clean flavors. Also, it's not cheap so if you're offended by a $19 plate of solid mexican food, go elsewhere. For some reason people will pay that for just about any other type of food here without thinking about it but when it comes to mexican food, they think it should be cheaper. I completely disagree but if that's your take, go hit Roberto's & eat half warm food out of a Styrofoam carton.

Salsa here is slightly chunky with great fresh flavor. You are not going to find runny ""hot sauce"" here. We both ordered the combination plates and there was not a single item that we didn't absolutely love. I especially enjoyed the cheese enchilada which almost had a creamy cheesy consistency & husband especially liked the beef tacos with shredded beef which were encased in a perfectly cooked corn shell, not too hard & not too soft. We also had a half-order of the guacamole which again was incredibly fresh tasting & didn't included a bunch of shredded lettuce at the bottom that many restaurants use as filler. 

The service was incredible (shout out to Jason & his manager) and the interior was beautiful with lots of plant life. It gave the impression you were sitting in one of San Diego's great mexican restaurants.

It's completely refreshing to have an alternative to most of the other nuevo mex & michoacan you'll find in this city. We'll definitely be back!!!",2gn2io-RYEFeCOf5GSuH7A,1,2,5,znNezK4VQxo1WA9zqkCv0w

There was a sauce to put on it but it had a skin on top of it because it had been sitting so long and the beans were almost cold. The best thing we ate everyone agreed was the fries with the chicken strips my daughter got. The chicken pipian received a frown from my husband the shrimp tacos were again just OK. The cheese appetizer had cream cheese in it? The taquitos were OK. The service was good it was loud and my husband says the beer was good. I could imagine going to try happy hour maybe that would be a better experience but with the coupon the bill was 130 before tip.

When I finally dined there the place was really underwhelming. First of all there is no carpet in the restaurant & it sounds like a warehouse. I ordered a chili verde burrito which is a staple in Mexican kitchens & it seemed that the pork was cooked separately from the sauce which enables them to use it with multiple sauces. The pork in Chile Verde should be cooked or braised in the sauce which emparts meat juice in the sauce.

The tamales were very dry. My cheese enchilada had no taste to it. My husband said his taco was ok. I think Roberto's has much better food. We checked in with the Yelp app and we got a coupon for a free Fried Ice Cream. We thought ok, how can you mess up fried ice cream right? Wrong! It came in a fried tortilla shell bowl sitting in some dark brown watery substance. We had no idea what it was. Was is chocolate? Still have no idea. It kinda tasted like oil, cinnamon, sugar and a tad bit of caramel. We tried to spoon out some ice cream and it flipped over because it was a round ball floating in this strange substance. It tasted ok, but not like any fried ice cream I've ever had. 
Maybe I'd try this place again but not for food. Maybe for a drink in the bar. They really need to drop their prices.

I had a cheese enchilada and taco combo.  I've had tastier microwave Mexican.   There wasn't anything wrong with it, but you would have a better experience at any chain Mexican restaurant. 

The other big issue is the insanely high prices.  Expect to pay $17-20 for items that would be $9-11 at most other restaurants.   If the food was unique and flavorful this would be OK... but what we had?  Meh.",6UPFrXF2dlzlHn5D7cEt5A,1,0,3,atmO9ltgwQ5U7PcOtbc0zA

Location: 5/5
This place is gorgeous.  There is plenty of beautiful art to gaze upon as you graze on your complimentary nachos.  There was live music when we came in about an hour and a half until closing, and it really lifted the atmosphere of the place.

Service 2.5/5

I feel that many of the reviews have felt that the price for the food is a bit steep.  I wouldn't complain about the price if the service was a little better.

We we in absolutely shock when walking into this establishment, whoever designed this place deserves a bonus. Tiles, pictures, bricks, and plants were so authentic to Mexican culture (I say this from experience in different Mexican cities). The food was amazing and portion sizes were large. Still not quite sure why people are complaining about prices, they seem more then fair given the quality of food in such an amazing establishment. 

But anyways, We went two nights in a row, the first night in the garden for a romantic evening. And our second night in town we wanted a little more upbeat tempo, so we tried a couple  local bars nearby (lazy dogs and one other) and ultimately ended up back at Pancho's in the bar area. I wouldn't suggest going into the bar unless you want a lively and active environment like we did on this night, the garden and dining will give you the relaxing experiencing you are looking for. We didn't make it in for happy hour at the bar but were told t's from 2:30-6:30- half off appetizers and margaritas. Not sure if that is all days or not.  Also the mentions comedy nights and karaoke nights but not sure which nights those are either.

I don't know if his Pancho's is affiliated with a location that was once in My hometown of Houston, TX but I decided to bring my dad here. Everyone seemed to have loved the food they had chosen. I had eaten my full plate before I even knew it (within 15mins if receiving it). I believe we all either got some type of enchilada or burrito. I was the only one who ordered an adult beverage and tried the cucumber-jalapeños margarita. I initially was going to get the regular jalapeño margarita but the server said this other one was better. Unfortunately, the taste of the cucumber completely took away the spicy kick of the margarita. I was disappointed with it being a Mexican restaurant. To be fair, maybe because Houston, TX is the best place to get your authentic Mexican food and really delicious cocktails. We live our margaritas frozen, and I've only found one place that actually makes a stellar frozen margarita here in Vegas. I would advise not to get the cucumber jalapeño margarita- just stick to the plain jalapeño margarita instead. Besides the good food, I think the entree's were priced almost $2 too high.

First, the restaurant looks like a house and the main dining room has a courtyard feel. It is open and full of fake plants and trees (it's a bit much). Our server was polite and the server assistant also quickly came with their chips and salsa. Pancho's salsa was excellent with a nice kick and their chips were good as well. I ordered the wahoo fish tacos and my partner got a very large burrito of some kind. My tacos were also excellent and he said the burrito was great too! I did order a house margarita on the rocks and it was just ok. It was quite strong, not really that good, and was over $10! This was for their house margarita! To me, this is a bit overpriced, especially if the house margarita doesn't consist of premium ingredients.

All in all, we will definitely be back to Pancho's. My fish tacos were really quite good and I love a good salsa.

The chicken did not have a morsel of flavor & the beans were overcooked. It's also worth noting that making up the salsa were so many huge chunks of what looked like stewed tomatoes that I could have used them to make homemade pasta sauce. & there was so much cilantro in the salsa that it may as well have been a side salad.

While their website says people love this place I can't say we had s good experience.  A friend went to pickup and order.  Strike #1, they don't take orders over the phone.  My friend went to the bar and ordered without looking at the menu since we did that online.  Strike #2, no prices online.  I get this for really expensive gourmet restaurants, but not Panchos, really?  He gets the food and the bill.  $127 before tip for 4 people!  He gets home and tells us this fact and eat only to find out that the food is DEFINITELY not worth the price we paid.  Strike #3, cost to value of the food is NOT worth it.  Major fail!  We will never go back or recommend this place.

I'm a little surprised people are saying the food was overpriced. I ordered a combo plate with an enchilada and a taco, my roommate ordered a combo of 2 chicken tacos. Both had huge portions of rice and beans, and the tacos were served with guac and sour cream. We each got a Diet Coke and the bill was $39 and some change, roughly $20 each before tip. The value of the food for the price was as expected, and not outrageously over priced - to those people I would say that if you can't afford to eat out, simply stay at home; cook and serve your own food if you don't want to pay for it. 
As far as the actual food goes, it was very good. I've been looking for good Mexican food in Las Vegas ever since I came from California, I finally found it! :)",oTLY1xiJBheerlvuulXocQ,2,1,5,ZqHsEmb_r3_bK4BUdvBLtw

On my combination plate, the cheese enchilada, rice and beans were all prepared and presented as they should be, and I enjoyed them.  The chicken tamale, however, was not as good; it had large chunks of chicken breast which were dry and not especially flavorful.  I normally steer clear of chicken dishes in a Mexican restaurant, but that was the only kind of tamale they served and I had a hankering for a tamale.  My mistake.

The guacamole was plentiful and tasty, but with just a bit too much lime juice.  The salsa had way too much cilantro for my taste.  But the prices were reasonable, and the decor was pleasant.  The service was okay.  Our waiter was sometimes a little difficult to find, and there is more to friendly service than simply addressing the table as ""mi amigos,"" but I really wasn't expecting the level of service at Le Cirque, so it was fine.

The atmosphere is nice, and so is the server, but when you had to wait about 20+ minutes for Mexican food off-Strip on a Monday night, it's either amazing, or there's something a bit wrong.

I'm actually shifting towards the latter.  The atmosphere is a great place, and perhaps they justify the cost due to it being in Downtown Summerlin.   But, there just wasn't anything enlightening about it.  Maybe it's just me.

The burrito I ordered cost about $19.  Honestly, it's probably worth about $12.  Unless the ingredients were all fresh, farm raised, organic and all that, I just don't see it.  Maybe they do... Trader Joe's is right across from there.  Somehow, I doubt it though.

I had heard through the local grapevine they were having some opening bumps, and had decided to wait a bit to let them work it out. When recently invited to meet friends here for dinner, I thought it was perfect timing.

Right off the bat, you are greeted with big smiles, polite staff across the board.
Our waiter was awesome. All of that is perfect. 

So now you are asking....sounds great, why only 3 stars?
The reason for 3 stars is the food was really super mediocre. 
And I wanted it to be great! But, sadly it was definitely not. 
On top of being completely average, it was very expensive compared to other mexican places of this food caliber. I had an enchilada and a chili relleno, and it was just shy of $20. I could easily list 10 places that are close to 1/2 that price and better food. I suspect this is why the online menu does not have any pricing. Most people in the area will know that it is high. My sentiment regarding the food was the census at the table, no one was thrilled.

Don't get me wrong, I have NO ISSUE with a $20 entree! If the food is amazing, that is all I need to know! But here, the food is far from amazing. Bummer, because it is really a beautiful space, filled with an awesome staff!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,2,2,3,v1G-c0R8zCqzSGc-IXyylw

3016002,2016-02-08,1,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"This is the PF Chang's of Mexican food. I don't mean it as a compliment, but I also understand the need for such places. It is regular Mexican fair at double the price. Maybe it's necessary because of the expense of the DS location. Yes, the food is good, not great, but I wasn't disappointed. The salsa actually had a kick to it. It wasn't watered down. But $15 for a burrito with no sides? I've tried to argue that I could've gotten the same burrito at Cardenas or Roberto's for half that, easy. But then again, Roberto's and Cardenas market food court isn't exactly where Summerlinites would go out for a family meal or a date. I get it.

Just look around you. How many actual hispanic people do you see there (besides the employees)? ZERO. Why would that be? I personally don't eat at Korean restaurants where there are no Koreans eating there no matter how nice the place looks. But I still gave them the benefit of the doubt because of the demographics of Summerlin. But Vegas as a whole has a big enough Hispanic community that you would see at least one person eating here on a busy Saturday afternoon if this place was really that good. The Michiochan restaurants are full of Hispanic families.

The entire decor is designed to attract the non Hispanic Summerlin crowd into thinking they're eating ethnic food without having to drive down to questionable parts of town to do so. I would rather eat at Cardenas market and get similar quality for half the price. But yes, it's not a viable option for some people. Again, I get it. So you must pay double for the atmosphere. 

But the final punch in the gut was paying $9.99 for a kids meal that was 1/3 frijoles, 1/3 rice, and 1 enchilada (or 1 taco, but to make it a fish taco was extra $). NO DRINKS included. I guess we live in Summerlin so we can afford to pay, right? It's what Upper-Middle Class people do, overpay for EVERYTHING.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,1,0,3,iGGQjzvBOFLsk0bvX2vxEQ

My three littles each had enchiladas. They enjoyed them. No complaints.

I ordered Enchiladas de Avocado y Artichoke. It was lovely. Everything I could've hoped for after reading the description. My jalapeño margarita scored a 7/10.

Hubby enjoyed some steak tacos & a beer. 

In addition to our entrees we also ordered a large Guac for the table. $15! I know we are in Summerlin but JESUS!

Our check came to $123. Roughly. Typically I wouldn't budget a dinner for the 5 of us for over $80. Fortunately I snagged a coupon for 1 free entree and left a $24 tip. So $130 out the door.

So to break it down for you:
Expensive. Great service. Good quality (fresh) food. Don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. 
The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL.

But $130 for four entrees, two sodas and four beers is just way too expensive for a standalone Mexican restaurant, even in Summerlin. They need to rethink their pricing in my opinion, if they want to be around as long as Lindo Michiocan or Frank & Finas.

Just too expensive to rate higher than 3 stars.",7rpo8FIDz_qG5knwQ3Z8rw,1,0,3,pl2zLDEIlIAr_87QzIAyTw

The lowest thing is a plain burrito at 13.95.  So - they started sending out coupons 2 for 1 for dinners but there's s catch.. you have to order two drinks. Watch it a simple soda is 3.75 each!

Had the mole enchilada...no good rich mole flavor. More like a bland and somewhat gritty sauce. 

Used the yelp offer for free fried ice cream. This was not fresh, probably one of a batch from early in the day or say before. Ice cream was hard frozen and icy in the middle and the cornflakes were chewy.

Also, this is an aside and perhaps just an issue for that evening but the bus staff was constantly bringing rolling carts of bus trays, glasses and dishes thru the main restaurant.

First, I thought the service was excellent.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  As soon as we sat down, we were served chips and salsa.

There is a lot of food on the menu, but I don't see that as a bad thing.  There's a lot to choose from which means you don't have to get the same thing over and over when you come back.  I had the Trio Los Pancho's and they were amazing.  My girlfriend had the artichoke quesadilla and devoured it.

Some of the reviews say this place is a bit pricey, but I guess they've never eaten in Las Vegas before.  I felt the price was right on par for downtown Summerlin.

Someone sure spent a lot of money on the building and its very nice on the inside. I ordered the two beef tacos with double rice, Tasted bland was not anything extraordinary at all.

First off - $20 for a steak quesadilla, guacamole for $15 - AYFKM?

I could go on and on about what a ridiculous absurdity this place is, but I think it's best summed up by the following:

Pancho's - please FOAD!

I have this strange desire to laugh out loud in the face of the fool who opened this place - even if it gets me a sock in the eye.

I ordered the carne asada quesadilla and a beer.I figure a quesadilla is as good of benchmark for Mexican food as any, after all you get a tortilla to see if it is freshly made or not, steak or chicken to see how they season their meat, guacamole and salsa all in one dish. The kitchen took 20 minutes to make the quesadilla, but clearly spent no more than 20 seconds plating it. The presentation was what I would expect from Taco Bell, not a top dollar Mexican restaurant. 

If after looking at the pictures you agree that it does not look appetizing, just wait till you lift up the first piece and see the waterfall of grease pouring down. I seriously had to grab a handful of napkins to soak up some of the grease that would not drip off of each piece on its own. After each slice of quesadilla was removed and de-greased, the plate was left with an ocean of grease that was starting to declare war on the guacamole. 

But I wouldn't feel sorry for the guacamole, at $15 a serving, it has the budget to defend itself.

If there was something you could add to insult, after insult was added to injury, it was already added to that nasty quesadilla - it was just plain awful. The steak had a flavor, but a flavor that should be added to rodent repellent, not food. It left a nasty taste in your mouth that would not go away, even after drinking a gallon of salsa.

The salsa was decent, I have to admit. But then again it was free. The guacamole wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't worth $15.

I never got to judge the tortilla, it was soaked in so much fat there was no way to tell if it was handmade or not.


Let's just sum this crap-hole restaurant up this way:

""Poncho's - please leave Downtown Summerlin and never return. You are a cancer on an otherwise precious young flower that deserves a chance to bloom.""

Having said that, the bartender Steve was a pretty decent bloke.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,29,11,1,4g9I8Tc0H5q2OiXusxa1Qg

A friend decided to have lunch there so we did.. 
The decor is nice but that's it.. The place was pretty empty so we got our table right away .. We ordered two margaritas , they were just ok nothing worth getting excited over especially the high price !!
Next we ordered guacamole for an appetizer .. I was expecting a table side creation but that wasn't the case , waitress went to the kitchen and brings a cute ""little "" bowl of guacamole and chips!! Tasteless , flavorless and down right bland!! We had to add salsa to it to give it some sort of taste !! 
Next up ..... Chicken quesadilla and carne asada quesadilla .. We split both and I preferred the carne asada ... 
It was ok but again nothing worth $18 for .. 
So for 2 margaritas , guacamole , 2 quesadillas.. It came out to $77 FOR LUNCH! $HIT really ! 
Service was fine , food was subpar .. I figured that because they are located in downtown Summerlin they think they can fool the locals with subpar food and gouge the shit out of us!! Seriously Panchos ?? Think about what you're doing .. I'm a Tex-Mex and have lived here for 25 years, you have no idea what Mexican food is.. Stop trying to fool people with your crappy over priced food .. Totally out of line ... Either drop your prices by 50% or make better food by 100%..

Pancho's, while your atmosphere looked beautiful, I was hoping that the food would look and taste just as good, but that's where it went south of the border...WAY south! Our party of 6 decided to check it out after hanging out at nearby TPC Summerlin all day.

The building and decor kinda made you feel like you weren't in Vegas anymore, but when it comes down to it, TASTE is everything. Heading straight for the entrees section of the menu, I like to try a Mexican restaurant's Chile Relleno as a test, so I ordered the three item combo which also came with an enchilada and a taco. Chips and store bought tasting salsa are also brought to the table as well. Entrees arrive, and as I bite into the chile relleno, it has a slight crunch!? A sign of the pepper not being roasted enough before being peeled and stuffed.
The enchilada was okay, and the taco shell was stale with the meat being dry. I also tried a bite of Wifey's Seafood Burrito and the seafood definitely wasn't the freshest.

Apparently, there are two kinds of rice served here. A green, and a red. Those in our party who had the green rice enjoyed their order, while people with the red rice had crunchy bits in them. a sign of either sitting out uncovered, or prolonged time under the heating lamp as orders were being filled. Prices here are ridiculously up there(I believe all entrees were $16 or higher). The Company was good and service was pleasant, but I wish I could say the same for the food quality here. With tons of other dining options in Downtown Summerlin, you are seriously better off elsewhere. Just read the reviews and tips if you still plan to take a chance here.  ALOHA!!!

The waitstaff is good about filling beverages and chips. That's it.  You are paying for the decor and construction costs, and not getting quality or tasty food in return. 

I ate here last week for lunch, after being told there was a two hour wait on opening day (despite the restaurant not being full).  I was seated immediately this time, after the hostess rudely remarking that she remembered me from the previous week.  I was brought to a table near the base of the stairs... So far so good.  Although the water in the fountain was green and cloudy.

I ordered a chicken chimi and iced tea. This was around 2:30 pm and it still took about 45 minutes for my food to come out.  By that time I'd eaten way too many chips (yeah they're good although the salsa is just meh) and wasn't very hungry.  Which is good because my chimi was the smallest burrito I've ever seen.  It was dry and lacking in flavor and I left half of it and the beans and rice (also meh) on my plate.  Definitely not impressed.

When they first opened, the wait was too long and I didn't find the quality of food and drinks to be worth the prices that are considered by some on the high-end for Mexican. When you consider what you're getting, it's not really overpriced. It's authentic style Mexican. So if you're looking for Chiles style cheaper meals, you won't like it here. The atmosphere is great, the service is spectacular and the margaritas are divine. We get the ""special"" margaritas with the extra Grand Marnier on top. The guacamole is delicious. I usually get fajitas, but this last visit, I ordered the steak quesadilla and split it with my daughter. It was also delicious. My husband usually orders something the waiter recommends and is always pleased. To our surprise, our waiter remembered what my husband had ordered a month prior and asked if he'd like the same or to try something else. This is what sealed the deal for us. When the wait staff is this attentive, management is as well and the entire restaurant reflects these attitudes. Towards the end of the meal, the manager stopped by and was super friendly and just like our waiter, seemed to enjoy his job. He asked for some feedback, and I shared with him how the word around town (or at least amongst our friends) is that they are overpriced. He asked what I thought, and I explained how after this visit, I have come to realize you pay for what you get. I further explained about the atmosphere, food and drink quality and staff are what we are also paying for. He appreciated our comments and bought us a round of shots.

I ordered a Titos Cosmo, it was served in a tiny martini glass with a teaspoon of Titos in it. It was more like receiving a communal sip of juice. Hardly enough to flush away this girls sins.

My girlfriend ordered a simple cheese quesadilla which she found most palatable- at the tune of $17 (or more), I tried to verify this by looking the price up on their Internet menu, but... they don't show the prices on the Internet, curiously supportive of my claim that you're about to be gouged for food that you're likely to be disappointed with.

The service is fair to good but the food and value is poor. Shrimp fajitas around $26 and if you want a combination of shrimp and chicken then shuck out $31. And that doesn't include a drink, tax  and tip. Around $40 for fajitas that were awful. I'm not a huge fan of Baja Fresh but even their fajitas taste better. This is a huge problem.

3988619,2016-07-24,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Last minute decision, to have dinner here. Yelp rating on this spot could be misleading. It clearly is way out - 3 stars really -- Panchos is closer to 4.5 - 5 stars.

Our experience was 100% five stars

As you enter this restaurant, you are transported to wealthy Mexican house - wow what a foyer - decorated with classic Mexican art

We were quickly seated, table for two, the restaurant was packed, we got the last two seater. Within seconds we were attended by, one of best server experiences we have had in Las Vegas, Lee. We are new to Mexican cuisine, a fact, we shared with Lee to - right away we were give a full introduction to the highlights of the cuisine and based on our taste preferences what we should try. A prudent way to introduce you to cuisine you know little about. 

So for appetizers, we were served a guacamole and hop spicy dip along with Corn chips. That went really well with us, and we waited probably 5-7 mins for our entree. My wife and me shared a entree - it was Grilled Chicken, salad, rice and beans. It is a big meal
 
The Chicken was really delicious, very well grilled with back ended BBQ flavor. Done just right.My wife enjoyed the bean and rice, I was not a huge fan. But overall the meal was very good, full marks to the chef. 

After the Entree, we were offered Fried Ice Cream, to me that was good - not amazing like the 
Entree and Appetizer. You can get this free with your Yelp Check-in 

What really deserves 5 stars was the Service, Lee the server was amazing, the Manager dropped in - was polite and genuinely wants to look after his guests, there is warm feeling at Panchos - they want you to enjoy your meal - like being in their house. 

Highly recommend this location for party or date night.

My husband, daughter and myself were in the DTS area and decided to have dinner.  Wanting Mexican, we decided to try it out.  

We were given a lackluster greeting by a young girl who clearly was bored and taken through the dining room to our seat. We were promptly given chips and salsa and then shortly after asked for our drink order.  We looked through the menu and were totally floored at the cost of what appeared to be pretty basic food choices.  We were going to order guacamole until we realized it was $15 and  NOT even table side. Decided against it and ordered just entrees.  We nibbled on chips and boring salsa with too much heat while we waited for our food.  Our meals were delivered by someone other than our server and we were not asked if we needed anything else. Our server came by shortly thereafter though and asked.  We requested sour cream which he quickly brought.  But that was the last we saw him.  He never returned to ask how the food was. If he had, I would have told him the chicken tamale was dry with a disgusting flavor.  When he did return it was to clear our plates. But he never inquired why I hadn't finished my plate or if I wanted it boxed. Maybe he knew it was gross.  And I couldn't even wash it down because my glass was empty. ALL of ours were. No offer to refill just a question about dessert.  We decided to cut our losses, pay the $65 tab and leave.  When we walked by the hostess, there was no thank you, goodbye, how was it.

The restaurant is very cool. It's like a big open atrium inside with lots of trees, hanging birds, a fountain and so on. A huge negative - we were seated right next to the fountain and it smelled like mold/sewer. Every time some passed by it wafted towards our table. Very unappealing. They have a big menu with loads of options; the prices definitely run a little high. 

Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with our food. They serve complimentary chips and salsa And the salsa is tasty. We ordered the artichoke queso fundido. It was like no other queso fundido I've ever had. It was essentially a skillet of warm sour cream/cream cheese. The consistency was like a dip, not like ooey gooey cheese. No caramelization. No bueno. We also ordered the beef taquitos described as spicy. They were bland. No flavor. I had the sopa de albondigas (meatball soup); this did have nice flavor!! Others at the table were disappointed with enchiladas, chile rellano and a seafood entree. Everything lacked flavor and pizazz and seemed overpriced. 

I didn't have a cocktail or I might say to come for the surroundings and a drink.

4074532,2017-05-04,11,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Bring your wallet! Just because this place is in Downtown Summerlin, they think they can get away with charging outrageous -- and I do mean OUTRAGEOUS -- prices for simple Americanized Mexican food. Yes, the restaurant is gorgeous inside, with colorful clay tiles and a fountain in the middle of the dining room, but they are putting the high cost of their primo real estate onto unsuspecting customers' backs. 

I love Mexican food and Pancho's drew me in with an appealing menu. The first sign that this was going to be a disappointing meal was when the waiter brought out complimentary chips and salsa for the table. I judge a place by its chips, and these were pretty awful. They were cold, not salted at all, and honestly tasted like they were out of a big bag. They had to be. Ditto for the salsa, runny and bland and just gross. Pass. 

Next up was the queso fundido with artichoke hearts. This tasted more like Paula Deen's artichoke dip than Mexican queso, so don't order this if you just want tasty melted cheese. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Wouldn't get this again. 

I was dining with two friends and one had a beef quesadilla with a margarita, and the other had fajitas. I ordered the Especial de Cabo. The food ranged from truly inedible to mediocre, and all of it was grossly overpriced (see the pattern here)? NOBODY was happy with their meal. 

The kitchen was easy to work with and swapped out grilled vegetables for the rice, which I appreciated. The veggies were good and the flavor of the dish was acceptable, but what was so nasty was the huge puddle of water that settled into the bottom of my plate. It was extremely unpleasant to have to dig my food out of this murky water. The kitchen needs to do a better job draining the water and grease off of the food! As expected, my meal was very light on the meat (chicken breast, shrimp and crab meat -- it had like 3 shrimp total and one little scoop of crab meat), but there were at least some decent sized avocado chunks. This was a pretty good low carb dish in terms of creativity and flavor, but it was just too pricey for me to justify eating it regularly.  

The biggest offense here is that the tortillas aren't homemade. Every good Mexican restaurant ought to make their own tortillas. (At least they brew their own iced tea, and it was delicious). 

One friend ordered the fried ice cream for us to share and it was the superstar of the meal. But really, how can dessert NOT be delicious? I laughed at the miniature American and Mexican flags that were stuck in the top of our dessert because this had to be the most inauthentic Mexican meal I have ever had! 

The service was abysmal too. We had to wait forever for drink refills and for the check, and our server brought out our queso appetizer without any chips or any plates, so we had to sit there while our queso got colder and colder. Epic fail on the inattentive service. 

The three of us were left with disappointing meals and a disappointing experience all around and a whopping check for $165 for lunch. LUNCH! One hundred and sixty five dollars!!!! Talk about a genuine rip-off in the greatest sense of the word!

I won't be returning to Pancho's.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,23,11,2,60yteRZVBMa-iQRN7Piamg

Ordered the chili Rellano and The poblano was still crunchy and cheese was not melted in the middle. Two people $70... Should've went to Tavoli!!!!!

We went there tonight at 6 p.m. with a party of four. Started with premium margaritas all around which were weak and tasted like a lime slurpee. We asked for no salt on all ... nope. Wait staff was very kind and courteous; however, when we received three of our entree's ... the fourth never came. Not for a while. After we decided to ""go ahead"" figuring the fourth entree' would be right out ... the manager stopped by. He asked how everything was going and we replied that we had been waiting for one of the ordered entree's, ""carnitas"". He was very apologetic BUT after another 5 or 10 minutes  or so, the entree came ... Fish Tacos. What? The manager came back and was bumbling with excuses about how carnitas couldn't be properly cooked here in Las Vegas unlike in Manhattan Beach, California where the other Pancho's is located. He said, ""Princess it must be perfect to serve &  I'm sorry we will not charge you for the entree that you didn't get"". Really? So while we waited for the entree' I ordered a Carona Lite (after finishing my watery margarita). We ate the food and all complained how salty it was but so be it... that's a matter of taste (even though all 4 of us said the same thing). The icing on the evening was I never received the beer I ordered. Again, the manager apologized and took one entree (that was never received) and a beer (that was never received) off the bill of well over $120. I paid the bill but needless to say this place failed miserably. Our first time here and we'll not return and tell everybody we know how crappy it was. We have lived in Las Vegas for over 25 years and are used to waiting ... the restaurant was packed. Don't know why as our experience was disappointing compared to even Macayo Vegas which has better quality and for less than half the cost ... BUT they don't have those fun, pretty festive colors.

After a 20 minute wait on a Friday night, our buzzer went off and we were seated at our table of 7. Our waiter came over to deliver chips and salsa, take our drink orders and answer questions. My hubby rapped in Spanish with him after noticing some food item mentioned Tijuana and really the food origin was Mexico City.  After discovering the waiter and us had lived very close to one another in Mexico City, he brought us over guacamole. Delish!!! 
Food items ordered; chicken fajitas (very good, mushrooms with onions and sliced bell peppers), chicken mole (good), a mixed pork and chicken platter (said to be tasty) and chicken tacos and a taco salad for the kids (all said to be very good). It's definitely not ""authentic"" Mexican, it's that Americanized Tex-Mex, but it's still good. The prices are a bit steep, but that's to be expected in this area of Summerlin. Total bill for 7, 4 kids meals, 3 adults, no cocktails was $145, tip not included. We ordered cocktails at the bar, 2 beers and a vodka-club was $40-ish. 
Service was amazing, drinks refilled immediately and our waiter and multiple bussers came to add drinks, clear plates, etc. 
We lied and said it was our friend's bday and could they sing happy bday to him. They came over at the end of the meal and gave him fried ice cream, put on the sombrero and sang. Oh, the stupid stuff we do for a 40 second laugh... We're lame....

The food is a little pricier than Lindo (which was our previous preferred spot for disappointing Mexican food) but you're paying for ambiance, and for us, convenience. The service was very attentive and sincere.

We enjoyed the pescado ceviche (yum! - the more sour the better), Carne Asada quesdilla (meat was tender and flavorful), and the shrimp/crab enchiladas (I was so happy to be able to choose one of each!).

Sure, there are places that are more rustic and more authentic, perhaps less cliche, but this place fills a void in the Las Vegas arena of Mexican fine dining. Everything was tasty! Bring your parents here! It has a place in my rotation for sure and I am a regular at the more authentic places. Great job on the decor too, it felt like a place that's been around a long time.

My only criticism is price. It's 10-15% more expensive than I'd like. Let's face it, that building wasn't cheap! Maybe when things settle they'll give us a break or some coupons or something.

As far as the negative reviews, most of them sound like what happens when you open a new place. It'll get better.

I ordered some carne asada tacos and it only came with two ok size tacos for 17 bucks! You get the other nonsense like beans and rice. Let's be honest we are there to eat the tacos not the beans. I thought they gave you soup with every meal, that isn't true. So why is it so expensive for some decent tacos! 

You get chips & salsa which is always nice. If they ask you for guacamole say NO it's 9 bucks! The food flavor is just normal.

The enchiladas by themselves were alright,  but the rice & beans were awful. The garnishment on the rice looked like a side salad of carrots and cabbage....WAY TOO MUCH!  Service was decent.

4533517,2015-12-07,14,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Preposterous. Avoid this place at all costs unless you like to be ripped off. As a Vegas local, I do NOT like to be price gouged just because a business has an expensive building and high overhead. I have a million other choices. Just because it is Summerlin also does not excuse how ridiculously marked up Pancho's entire menu is. There are plenty of restaurants in downtown Summerlin that are good and don't have these outrageous prices. 

I made the mistake of not checking Yelp reviews before trying this place. I wanted an unbiased opinion because my friends and I have been waiting for this place to open for so long. It seems a lot of the Yelp reviews echo our thoughts as well. The exterior and interior *are* very beautiful. I like the openness feeling when you walk into the front entrance. The seating for waiting is a little awkward, some wooden benches and not enough of them. There is a fairly sizable bar area but we did not get a drink in the bar. My visit was on 12-5-15 on a Saturday night at around 7:30pm. We were given a pager and waited about 20 or 25 minutes, then we were led up the staircase to a small table overlooking the downstairs. 

The ceiling and decor are elaborate, yes. It's very beautifully decorated. Our server was nice and friendly enough. I didn't catch her name, but service wasn't anything to write home about. And that's where anything positive ends. 

They don't have a drink menu anywhere, and the little drink signs on the tables only list the brand of draft beer. NO prices anywhere. My friend ordered a Pacifico draft and I ordered a Titos vodka and club soda, and ice water. Guess it was our bad to not ask how much the drinks were... 

This place isn't authentic Mexican anything. Complimentary chips and salsa are cold chips and store-bought jarred salsa with zero flavor. No hot sauce to be seen anywhere on the tables. 

My friend ordered carnitas enchiladas ($19.95) and I ordered tacos de pescado (with salmon) also $19.95. It seemed that NOTHING on this menu is under $19.95... everything was extremely overpriced. The price did not reflect quality. My tacos came out and there are just two of them, and a slop of some weird beans. Yuck. I tried to pick up a salmon taco but it just falls apart. It had a lot of fillers in it, where the heck is the salmon? It's chopped up into tiny pieces, and the rest of the taco is filled with tomatoes and chopped iceberg lettuce. Disgusting. It lacked flavor, so BLAND! I tried to pick it all apart with my fork, it just wasn't worth the price. 

How many freakin people do you need to constantly interrupt us to check on our table? I can count at least 6 people besides our waitress who kept trying to take our plates away. I felt a bit rushed and I don't like that. My plate didn't even look like I touched it, and my friend had quite a lot of food still, and an older gentleman came over to our table and asked if he could take our plates away. He already had his hand on my platter before I said anything, and by this time... I was SO over it. Just take it. It's too bad, I was still hungry but completely lost my appetite here. 

There was some band setting up downstairs in the bar area and we could hear them practicing. Our waitress, although she was nice... seemed to rush us with the bill. Then when we got the bill, holy cow we both about lost it. $9.75 for a short glass of vodka and club soda!!?!?! $7.50 for a Pacifico DRAFT!??! WHAT!!! Our bill for two people, two drinks each, and two basic dinner entrees came to $79.95!! I saw they had tres leches on the dessert menu but seriously, $9.95 for a piece of moist cake? No thanks. 

After seeing the bill with the drink prices, my friend and I were completely ticked off. And then, suddenly when we wanted to pay there was no one to be found upstairs. After all those people that were stopping at our tables, suddenly they all just disappeared. We flagged down a different waiter and settled our bill. Just a total let down experience overall. 

If you want real Mexican food at reasonable prices with REAL homemade margaritas and salsa.... take my advice and go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas on Ft Apache and Tropicana on the southwest side of town. They treat you way better at Juan's and their food is so much better. Wish we went there.

Gorgeous Mexican Restaurant!! Beautifully Decorated Throughout.

Super Staff! Friendly and Efficient 

Appetizers Are Really Good- note- Get The shredded beef nachos ;)

Atmosphere is perfect for a family gathering or a nice dinner for two. 

Dinner was pretty good. Our waitress Carrissa was extremely professional, friendly and offered Wonderful customer service. That is ALWAYS a  plus when you go out to eat!

Our Appetizer (Shredded Beef Nachos) came out promptly. It was more than enough for the 3 of us to share. 

The shredded beef was really good and the nachos had an exact amount of cheese, shredded beef, jalapeños ratio going on to make it a delicious meal within itself.

My enchilada sauce was a bit different. Not quite red, not quite brown basically a combo of the two colors. It wasn't hot at all. Maybe it was tex-mex? I'm not sure. I personally did not care for it. I think I will go with a Verde next time.  

Husband had a shredded beef burrito which was delicious minus the cheese sauce NO BUENO. It wasn't good at all.

 Personally, I believe, if the sauces were changed it would help the dish be the amazing dish is was meant to be!! Nothing can kill a dish more than a  meh- nah sauce that drowns out the delicious flavors under it. For now,  I recommend skipping the sauces. Just my opinion of course. 

In all fairness- My suggestion is that  I  would love to see this restaurant create another Red Chile sauce. You know more traditional Mexican Red Chile Sauce please :)

 Beans and rice were pretty good.

The margaritas are a nice size and they don't skimp on the tequila. You can get any one of the dozens of tequilas they have on the menu. I tried the queso fun dido but I didn't like it. They told me it was their own spin, meaning people must order it then complain. The fun of fun dido is wrapping The gooey cheese around a fork and wiping it in the tortilla. Panchos is very runny and I didn't care for it.  The free chips and salsa are excellent, one of the best salsas I've had. Got a little kick to it, which is how I like it. I recommend this place highly",WYSf63EuLpUbSqco5BsSKQ,0,0,5,rOV-MljslZTstKKUlXj3XA

Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table so we went to the bar for a beer and a margarita. $18.95 for 2 drinks, ok a little pricey which now pushed my expectations to a higher level.
We both had soup, the Albondigas and their Chicken Tortilla soup were both very good, hot and flavorful. Our entrees were Carnitas Ramon and the Artichoke and Avocado burrito. portions were huge and both dishes were very good. The carnitas was very very lean. Over all the food was plentiful, and delicious. Our server was very polite and helpful. Besides being a little pricey we enjoyed our experience and will be back.",cWgkHtLt3d1pavi6gRjqVw,1,1,4,7enoyZoBoC2dZzFAyulJhw
4848141,2015-10-17,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Service was fine, food was OK, prices are insane.

This is a great looking restaurant, and I was so excited to visit that I went on the second day it was open. I won't judge the service too much since it's always crazy during the opening, although I'm not sure why waiters always feel comfortable complaining about their day and other customers to me (this happens at many restaurants, not just this one).

Pancho's is basically a '90s throwback Mexican restaurant with Americanized Mexican food, which isn't a bad thing. The obsession with authenticity has made me miss this stuff, but I can't imagine the reviewers who are calling this authentic have ever been outside their all-inclusive in Cancun.

We ordered an appetizer platter, which was about $18, and while it was big, it would've been cheaper at any other Mexican restaurant. The quesadillas were great, and the rest was standard. My husband got the steak fajitas, and this was the tiniest serving of fajitas I've ever seen, but he said the steak was excellent. I got the Pancho's trio of enchiladas, and they were your usual enchiladas, both in size and flavor.

We thought about ordering the $16 guacamole, but the waiter said we can try the side portion that comes with our appetizer platter. It's pretty much just mashed up avocado. No flavor whatsoever, and they charge more than any place I've ever been to, including those on the Strip.

All the food was good but in no way justifies the fact that they charge twice as much as every other Mexican restaurant. This is probably the most expensive Mexican place I've seen, and there was absolutely nothing special about the food. They'll need to cut the prices by nearly half to keep a regular clientele. We spent $67 on those three items, and went to Casa Don Juan the next week and got the same stuff for $28, and it tasted much better.

Another problem was that there were little kids running around all over the place. None of them were with the same party, but for whatever reason, everyone felt comfortable letting their kids run around in circles in a packed restaurant full of rushing waiters. It's common to see someone who doesn't care what their kid is doing, but it's just weird when it's a room full of careless parents.

The waiter said seafood is their specialty, so I'll go back to try it and see if it's any better than the rest. Unlike what the last reviewer said, we are not cheap. We regularly eat at restaurants that are more expensive than this, but the quality matches the price at those places. Pancho's just doesn't do it. I figure this restaurant will attract the same flavorless Summerlin soccer mom crowd as Crave.",1bLbofVz5HEVZNhXJI0M_g,2,1,3,maa6JvZFdDsUWOW0ehduWA

The place is beautiful, 5 stars if that was all you were rating on.
Go into the bathroom, i mean holy cow!
We went on a Monday, to catch the Vegas Cakes show and the place was pretty quiet.
We sat in the cantina since that was where they were showing it and it was occupied by one other table of people and sat with a shark floating overhead.
They have high tops and a couple regular height tables to choose from.
Not sure if it was because we sat in the cantina, but the four of us received one menu and one happy hour flyer, the good news is we were going to be there a while so we passed the menu around.
Ordered a couple margarita and they packed a punch, children had virgin daiquiris which they enjoyed.
You get chips and salsa which is nice, chips were edible, but nothing to get excited about. The salsa was decent, but expected a lot more flavor for a high end Mexican place.
Monday had 2.50 tacos in the cantina, we should have stuck with these, the tacos were decent and 2.50 would be a good deal.
Two tacos, maybe half a cup of rice and same for beans will cost you 6 times that.
The chili relleno was soggy, tasted alright though.
My son beamed over his chimichanga
Service was pretty good after we ordered.
Check in on yelp to get a free fried ice cream.
This is a fried ice cream with a lot of cinnamon. Cannot complain since it was free and it was dessert!
So the food was decent, better than the rest of the countless Mexican restaurants in the valley? No.

So it boils down to okay food, good drinks and awesome decor.

So, me and my friend come to eat here after I tell her I ve been waiting for this place to open, I call and found out this place just opened ! 

The ambiance and architecture are beautiful. When you go inside, you feel like you went on a vacation, it doesn't feel like the Las Vegas desert anymore ! It feels tropical and the glass windows add something new and inviting !

It is in the parking lot where Trader Joe's is and has lots of parking .

Upon entry I fell in love with the decor ..

We were here around lunch time and had Agustin as our server he was super friendly . Their menu is large and it isn't ""cheap"" which I admit at first alarmed me but let me tell you the quality of the food definitely made up for the cost .

We got our free chips and salsa and chowed those down a long with our Diet Coke which came with a little pitcher that lasted our whole meal . It's a pet peeve of mine to run out of soda so I was stoked about that .. I definitely saw tons of stuff on the menu I wanted but opted to let our server choose by asking his favorite item on the menu .

Just my luck he loved the Philly Cheesesteak Burrito and helped my Mom pick this chicken and mango salad and they both were awesome . Which was delivered to our table with a smile and friendly greeting from Gustavo.

The steak was super tender and the veggies delicious but not too over powering and the red sauce on top was top  notch neither of us could finish our whole portion but man did we try! I tasted the salad my mom GoT and the chicken was really flavorful and not chewy and the greens and fruit were super fresh it had mango and grapes and pepita seeds ? I think but either way it was yummy!

If you check in here you can currently get a free fried icecream but we were too full to try it out ..

Over all for $40something we got two sodas and entrees and could of had dessert.. but even Hector was super friendly while clearing our table ...

When we were leaving I stopped to take pictures of the bar area ... guess who else is super nice??? Daniel the bartender who wanted to pose for a photo and who comes around the corner ? My server Agustin to joke around saying I don't want one of him..

Since their opening, we've heard the same reviews (and Yelp reviews confirm the rumors) that the food is yummy but very overpriced. We heard the best time to go is during Happy Hour so we finally decided to check them out during their Happy Hour. Quickly into our visit, we immediately agreed the prices were very high, including happy hour. The ambiance is awesome and makes you feel like you're not in Vegas but the prices remind you that you haven't left the city, even with the happy hour prices.

We sat at the bar and the service was great from bartender, manager and food runner but ugh that doesn't compensate the high menu prices. Mexican food is affordably reasonable but $15 for guacamole??? I couldn't convince myself to pay that price. My bf ordered the Wahoos tacos ($19, 2 tacos with rice & beans) but that was his only meal for the day so he splurged. He said they were yummy but expensive.  

Also their menu is very long. You feel like you're reading a book when browsing through the options which immediately turned me off. Honestly it took me a bit to find the guacamole b/c I was scamming the menu looking for it and it blended right into the other menu items.

5077363,2016-02-07,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Wow!!! I like other reviewers wrote I wish I would have read the reviews before dining at this place. I will start out by saying that this is not to intend harm on Pancho's but there is a point to where a restaurant should offer soe sort of value to its patrons. This place doesn't. My actual rating would be about 1.5 star so I'm rounding it up.

The atmosphere:
I've seen this place many times before and watched the construction. We decided to dine there on a Sunday for lunch. It's decor reminds me of something you would find near San Diego and the atmosphere is decent. But to me atmosphere doesn't make the place.

The food:
My step-daughter and I ordered the chicken chimichanga which was about $18-19. Definitely pricey for lunch. At first glance I noticed it wasn't in the large side nor was it extremely small. The flavor was ok but the chicken was very dry. The rice and beans that came with the meal could be replaced with any other average rice and beans from another restaurant and I would not have noticed. My wife had the chili relleño. I asked her how hers was and she said she's had better. My daughter had a chicken quesadilla which was, get this, $17. Now, she said that it was really good. But this is coming from a 10 year old girl who thinks microwave popcorn is the bomb. 

The service:
Our waitress did definitely make herself seen. The bus person always filled our waters. But no was was overly friendly.

The Overall:
I base a restaurant on whether I would visit it again. This one I would not. All-in-all the meal was under $80 and that is with all of us only ordering water. Really? $80 for lunch? Add in a tip and my bill total was over $92. I've definitely had better food and larger portions at local taco shops and spent less than a 1/3 of that for my entire family.

Sorry Pancho's but listen to your customers reviews. A lot of them are saying the exact same thing as I am. Even though most of those reviewers may not be back, you can protect future patrons. And only very few people decide to leave reviews. You have no idea how many people, who decide not to write their opinion that decide they will not come back because of the value.",06X7m5d7om3RbCsyQhRNDQ,1,0,2,8GHmoNFbG7xOAkq450_5Uw

Ambiance - 5 stars
Service - 2 stars
Food Quality - 3 stars
Price - 1 star

Unfortunately, ambiance doesn't a good meal make.

We walk in w/ a party of 8 on Sunday at 6pm.  The hostesses look at us, one rolls her eyes, then they ask if we have a reservation.  We didn't, but asked if they could accommodate us and they said it would  be a few minutes.

We walked into the bar area to get a drink while we waited.  The bartender was fantastic, I wanted a skinny margarita w/ no triple sec.  He made a delicious concoction with a grand marnier float and it was fabulous.

They call us up and ask my husband if we want the 18% auto-grat added.  He declined as if the service is good, we generally tip 20% or more.  

They seat us up on the second level, which again, was beautiful.  We are greeted promptly by the server and bussers and we order additional non alcoholic drinks.  Not long after, we had some chips & salsa delivered to the table that were rather good.

We start looking through the menu and realize everything (and i mean EVERYTHING) is over priced.  $20 for Ceviche?  $15 for Guacamole?!? Are you kidding me???

Anyway, we were there w/ family so we decided to just deal.  My husband and I are vegan and noticed very few vegan options on the menu.  No big deal, we'll just modify.  They have a Vegetarian Salad (THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL IT) that includes the Mexican style rice.  Thing is - the Mexican style rice ISN'T vegetarian!! It's made w/ chicken stock!!!  Why would you put a non-vegetarian item in a vegetarian dish??  I am SO GLAD my gut told me to ask.

That being said, I ordered that salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream and it was actually rather good.  The dressing they put on it was great too and it was loaded w/ squash and carrots.  I did ask for beans since I wasn't getting the rice, cheese, and cream and they happily obliged.  However, this was a $17 salad.

My brother in law is pretty picky and ordered the philly burritto w/ o the onions or peppers - basically just meat and cheese.  My sister-in-law ordered the beef & beans burrito.  My bro in law's burrito came out w/ just meat.  My sister in law's came out chicken & beans, instead of beef & beans.  Neither came with ANY sides.  For $15 (it might have even been more), it should come with SOMETHING on the side.  My brother in law sent his burrito back and decided he would just wait to eat until he go thome instead of overpaying for the dish.  My sister in law ate hers, but said it was just ""meh"" - she could get better for a fraction of the price at Roberto's.

We had to ask for ketchup for my nephew's dish 3 times, and had to ask for the check twice (the second time almost 20 minutes after the first).

The manager came over and told my brother in law he wouldn't need to pay for the burrito (said it multiple times like it was some big favor he was doing us).  It was nice he stopped by, but that was a given - I sure hope we aren't paying for food that we sent back because it was deemed sub-par.

I ordered a second margarita, and started to explain to the server what I wanted but then stopped and said, you know what - the bartender will remember, he just made my first one.  The server smiled, shook his head, then walked away.  After I get my second margarita and it tastes NOTHING like the first, I see there's another bar upstairs.  He knew I came up w/ my first margarita...why didn't he ask me to continue because he would be ordering from a different bartender??

I'm just thoroughly disappointed, I really wanted to like this place and was excited about a late night bar (the bar is open until 2) that isn't a pub opening up in the area, however everything is way over priced (just because you're in Summerlin doesn't mean you can overcharge), the food was average and the service was subpar.

5314638,2016-09-05,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"So I happened to be at downtown Summerlin, and I stopped in to try this place on a Sunday, and discovered a gem. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and the bar is awe inspiring. It is probably the best designed Mexican restaurant I have seen.

The fruit and champagne was a great way to start. I ordered the puffy shrimp tacos, and could barely finish them. All of that plus the cinnamon  bunuelos made the price of $20.99 worth it.  I did think that some of the items were overpriced, like the guacamole and huevos ranchero, but enjoyed my meal.

I stopped in again on Monday which is ladies' night and had an even better experience. 1/2 prices apps, and $5 margaritas, plus live music, by a guy named Edgar, whose mix of classic Latin sound crossed with some modern songs made my night.

The service I received from Jason who was behind the bar was amazing. Not only was he attentive, making sure I never had to ask for anything, but the guy makes a mean margarita! He talked me into trying one of his bloody Mary's.  The best one I have ever had was at a bar in Los Angeles back in 1989. His blew that one away! As I watched him make it, his ratio of ingredients should not have worked, but was I wrong.  It will be even longer before I find someone to top him!

Jason talked me into trying the chile verde, which was a great call. I would not have been able to finish it even if I had not ordered an app before hand.  Portion size was ridiculous.

This has no become my favorite Monday night hang out because of the amazing cantina area, great bartender, and entertainment.  Well done, guys!",h2emjCcYrH3ZN8BXmfTtkQ,1,0,5,2O5Fx-B_LrggMZu4oUNPuQ

The prices were so much more than all the other happy hours in town that we decided to split an order of $17 FAJITAS on regular menu.  I wanted a margarita but my only choice was $7.50 so I opted for a $5.00 Negro Modelo.   The chips and salsa were very good and so were the nicely charred chicken fajitas, an ample portion.

The best part of our experience was our very competent & personable server Claudia who belongs in a 5 star restaurant.  We also appreciated the ambiance and the fact that their TV screens are terrific & well situated for watching a game.

With the huge population of Mexican restaurants in our city, as well as happy hours at almost any restaurant, Pancho's has much competition.  They could begin by dropping the prices and changing the music.  We're waiting (way too long) for this town to come out of the clouds & take advantage of fine music for ALL generations.

Their fajitas are ok, the meat is very tender and has a different flavor, however there wasn't much of it. Tried the cake for dessert and it was a very large portion that tasted OK. I've never had Tres Leches cake before so I can't compare it to anything, but I probably wouldn't order it again. 

There was no drink menu on the table which I thought was kind of odd. Two managers (I think they were Managers) came to the table more than once and interrupted us. I appreciate their concern, but more than 3 times of checking on us is a bit excessive - let the servers do their job! 

I agree with other reviews regarding their price point, it is a bit high and I'm not sure why -- Nothing about the food was special and IMO being in Summerlin is not a good reason.

5367305,2015-10-29,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Just to be objective in my assessment, this is visit #3.
I ordered Enchiladas de Mole, traditional Mole Poblano made from Ancho and Pasilla chiles, sesame seeds and peanuts. It was good BUT, what I should have ordered was the Pollo en Mole Verde with a green cilantro lime rice. The food after three visits here both at lunch and dinner is consistently good, spot on high quality ingredients. 
The service: in all fairness, my first visit was chaos because it was opening week. The following two visits both dinner and now lunch, the bar staff is exceptionally engaging and gregarious (Kelly & Jessica). 
The Margaritas: base tequila is Cuervo Gold. Total liquor is 2.25-oz. at a painful $10.50. The three closest competitors within less than a 5mi radius use a 100% Agave tequila unlike Cuervo's (mixto), pour 3-oz of liquor at $11. One establishment has it at $10 using Patron at 2.75-oz.
The bottom line: Food is good, service is good, booze is above average albeit value-wise it fails. One final note; it is truly a shame that anyone can Google their Manhattan Beach menu and see that the Las Vegas pricing is a whopping $3 more straight across the board! Did they not think that the Las Vegas locals were not smart enough to investigate that??? The happy hour is loooong! Starting at 2/2:30 through 6pm but, it is so complicated!! And, worse yet, of no real value. A $2 savings is not a happy hour although, I suppose if you milk it by staying the entire 3+ hours then MAYbe it's a better value.",6_OsfMU6GhlnhKE1g28r9g,3,0,3,O_au0M51YRUCCmo1CxtiZQ

5504358,2018-06-25,1,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Honestly this was not the restaurant that I thought I wanted to dine at. I knew I was gonna be in the area for shopping, and I knew that part of the name was Pancho's, and when I looked on yelp I thought I was going to the place that I had bookmarked. I don't know how I made such a mistake but what brought me to the supposed restaurant were the pictures, the vegan menu options and such. Nope this was not it! and I didn't realize my mistake until after we placed our order, and was wondering why there was only a breakfast menu and a dinner menu. I thought, 'oh, it must be the weekend so there is no lunch menu'. So I looked on yelp again, and saw the actual menus which didn't look nowhere near the ones I just looked at. oh well..

Anyway, it was too late to leave even though while looking at the menu I realized it was a little pricey for Mexican food. I felt like maybe it was because the area we were in? I'm not totally sure but what we ordered was one taco and cheese enchilada combo, which comes with rice and refried beans,  and the divorced eggs, which is a beef enchilada sandwiched between two over medium eggs, and rice and black beans. I never heard of divorced eggs entrees and I thought if we gonna spend a little more try something new. I liked how the refried beans came out with cheese on top and looks like it was broiled. 

It was ok, nothing special. I was a little disappointed in myself for making such a mistake. I don't like to pay for expensive mexican food that's just standard. There are too many other places around, such as Roberto's taco shop that I am quite fine with. 

The restaurant itself had nice decor, with a bar area and an upstairs. The hostesses, bussers and waiters are nicely dressed. The service is definitely good.

5607665,2015-12-31,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"Let me start with initial impressions.  Making a reservation was efficient, friendly and painless.  The building is beautiful and it is obvious that it was well thought out.  The interior is equally beautiful with a great looking theme. 

Unfortunately the praise stops there.   After we were seated it was just under 9 minutes before our server acknowledged out existence and took our drink order.  Upon his return, he got two of the three incorrect.  Upon his second return he still had one of them incorrect.  

After the drinks merry-go-round we ordered our meals. While awaiting our entrees we munched away on the fresh made chips that honestly were the shining star of the food offered here.   A server assistant wandered by and proceeded to refill the half empty glass of Sprite with water.  We pointed out the error and he replaced it fairly quickly.  

Our entrees arrived in a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately only two of them along with a partial order for another table.  The third entree was delivered by the manager a couple of minutes later.  Part of me wishes that they never brought them to us.  What an uninspired, boring, and quite frankly tasteless group of entrees.  The chicken tacos has some very flavorful meat tucked inside a corn tortilla with little else.  The refried beans appear to be out of a can and the rice was bland.  This was an $18.00 entree!

The chicken burrito was just downright awful.  I think I have had a more flavorful burrito at Roberto's and Cafe Rio.   The chili verde burrito had some life in it.  The pork was properly cooked, the verde sauce was flavorful and it was presented nicely.   It was not served with the normally present beans/rice which was the same for the chicken burrito.   You would think that for $17.00 it would be a meal not just a burrito on a plate.  

I spoke to the manager at length when he came by and sat down at the empty fourth seat.  Nice enough fellow who apologized for the service issues and heard my critique of the meal. I don't think he took my honesty to heart.   

Overall I can say this place has some systemic issues that will close the doors within a year if they don't correct them.  The service is awful, the food is mediocre at best, the pricing is way out of line for comparable establishments in the Summerlin Mall.  I won't be back and will not be surprised when the name changes to RANDOM_NAME Michoacan.

I met some friends here for lunch prior to some shopping in Downtown Summerlin. It was our first time eating at Pancho's, although I had heard a lot of good things about the restaurant. We definitely enjoyed ourselves.

We started with guacamole, which I believe was around $7. Only thing is, it was a HUGE portion and we didn't even come close to finishing it. It was really good.

I ordered one of their combo meals (cheese enchilada and chile relleno), which came with rice and beans. Everything was fresh and tasty. We enjoyed their chips and salsa as well (probably too much).

5692307,2016-08-28,6,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"I have to agree with most of the reviews. It's average at best and for a few reasons. 

We came on Friday night after trying to decide where to go. We had received a coupon (ha!) in the mail and thought really this is the only way to justify overpriced Mexican. 

The bar was really bright and they had a cover band  singing  80's/90's rock which was very odd. We opted not for the bar and sat in dining room. It's actually really pretty inside with palm trees, string lights,  fountains, and Spanish tile. 

The salsa was good. The guac is 14.95 which is a joke. We didn't receive it after ordering so we canceled it and saved ourselves 15bucks. The food was good enough and decent portions. Still hard to justify 20 bucks on menu items like quesadillas and burritos. 

Glad I gave it a try since I see it so often, it's close to home and I love Mexican. Prob would go back to try happy hour (maybe) but def not for regular priced entrees. With so many other great places in the area, it feels semi insulting to offer average food at such a high price point in an inauthentic atmosphere.

5704035,2015-10-16,0,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"I am writing this review feeling very disappointed. I was looking forward to this restaurant opening and hoping for really great, authentic ( or at least USA style authentic), Mexican food. The building is very nice and the server was very polite and attentive....other than that.....

We went early on a Thursday afternoon ( 4 PM) and the restaurant was not busy at this point. The hostess took us to what must be the worst table in the restaurant. It was in the back and near the kitchen door and  the server station. Normally, I would have objected and asked for another table, but this being our first time there, I wanted to see what else was in store. I am familiar with the concept of filling tables back to front, but this was a bit extreme based on the hour and the number of customers. It did give me a good view of part of the kitchen, which looked clean and well maintained. The server was at our table almost immediately and took our drink order. I ordered a traditional Margarita on the rocks. Hubby had a draft beer. The Margarita had a minimal amount of Tequila and was not at all remarkable in taste.Chips and salsa came to the table, and the salsa ,while a bit spicy , was lacking in any depth of flavor.
I decided to go with  a classic combo, beef taco and cheese enchilada and my husband ordered the Carne Asada Al La Ab. The combo, priced at $17.95,does not come with salad or soup. Unusual in my experience. My husband's entrée did get the soup or salad choice. The Carne Asada has Hanger steak and my husband was not asked how he liked it cooked, which I assume represents that it's already prepared. The entrees were delivered in a timely manner.
My entire plate was lackluster and had none of the savory deliciousness that I would expect from that plate. The shredded beef in the taco, the cheese enchilada and even the rice and beans were all very bland. My husband's Hanger steak tasted OK, it was medium well to well done...but had some taste to it. The other components on the plate were the same as mine.
Unfortunately, I see no reason to return to this place. The food is pricey for Mexican, which would be OK if it was really good, and it was, at best, just OK.",tOZSL8plD7JGsa_A-ZKiNg,4,0,2,f9sCYErs9PcKQEfY5vA5rw

The complimentary corn chips were dense and hard. This could just be a matter of taste but I like them light and crispy. I asked for them to fry up some flower tortilla chips, which every other Mex restaurant I've asked to do that, does so with a smile. The waiter asked the kitchen and reported back that the flower tortillas were to thin. I had flower tortillas with my meal, they were normal tortillas, so, translation, I don't want to. And the guacamole was on the bland side. This is quite possibly the most expensive restaurant I've ever been to but when you read the last page of the menu, you discover why. I'm guessing a build out of well over a million. After dinner we went downstairs to have drinks and listen to a rock cover band, a much needed venue in DT Summerlin. We've said since DT Summerlin's opening that a music venue was sorely lacking. thanx Pancho's for filling the gap.",4_x6qrBcYNhXwWm9UZBUOg,0,0,5,5OgJZFoOmJdYrYMD3iY1LQ

I did not accept the wrong food, but was inexplicably charged for the more expensive combo he had originally brought me. Unbelievable.

She was so sweet and came to check on us several times. For the management I can't say the same. There was a older gentleman that would walk around and say hi to the tables and make sure everything is ok. The whole time we sat there he did not come up to us once. The tables around us, yes he did but seemed to just pass us by every time. I thought it was odd until I brought it up to the other two other people with me. They noticed the exact same thing. What did all these tables have in common? They were all white and so was the manager. There were two other  tables he did not go up to. Another table whom were Hispanic like us and a table with Asians. This manager will sit and chat with each table once or twice but yet never made it to our table or the other two tables.

My son was mesmerized with the suspended shark which decorates the 21 and older bar area, but were able to capture a photo of the two of them together. Our Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas, shopping in Downtown Summerlin, was thoroughly enjoyed with Mexican sumptuousness.

Miguel our server managed a magnificent job with us.  He split our order of an Ensalada de Camarones con Miel. The greens and jicama were fresh, cool and crispy.  The mango slices were sweet and abundant.  He recommended an accommodation to the Children's Menu for us when I requested a side order of one grilled chicken breast (similar to the chicken breast available for the salad).  He replaced the Chicken Tenders entrée with a marinated, grilled and cut chicken breast, with a side of pinto beans de la holla and rice (with a cilantro pesto). Children's Plates served with rice, beans, or fries children 12 years and under. 

The bean choice are the whole pinto bean cooked in a pot, black beans, or traditional refried beans.  Also, there are two types of rice of choice. Each of our meals were accompanied with a fresh, fruit bowl appetizer including watermelon, apple, pineapple and cantaloupe chunks. Crisp chips were paired with a red, zesty tomato salsa.  

There are several reasons for Pancho's to be a kid-friendly restaurant. The women's bathroom has a changing table. The décor is festive and fun. Music plays lightly in the background and on designated evenings there is live music.  I am looking forward to mariachi music perhaps the middle of September!  A child's dinner includes a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Chocolate milk is a drink option.  

For Pancho's to gain one more star from me, I would like to see organic and free-range options on the menu.  Also, the emphasis on local produce would be a nice addition to community support.  And since I am always reaching for the stars, I would like to find a restaurant where patrons can watch tortilleros hard at work while enjoying an authentic Mexican meal.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,2,1,4,GN-JYLw_bx0R72QfnfD-dA

5837982,2015-12-12,2,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"As the new Mexican restaurant on the block in Downtown Summerlin, I decided it was time to give Pancho's a try.  Upon our arrival at night the restaurant was loud with live rock music from singers on a stage, but the decor was lovely hacienda style.  Guacamole in a metate with a tortilla chip base was real spicy, but there was a ton of it.   We waited a substantial time before anyone appeared to take our order, and then were first contacted by the manager, followed by the hostess, and finally our waiter.  Not too many chips were in the basket provided, so we had to request more; they were quickly supplied.  

I enjoyed a good Shredded Beef Taco and an ultra-cheesy Burrito Ranchero with shredded beef, but the interior of Diane's Quesadilla Del Mar (with shrimp) was made wrong, and it seemed to take forever to correct the error.  The lights in the kitchen went off before arrival of the correct version, and we thought the entire kitchen staff had gone home.  But not to worry--the belated replacement entree arrived at our table shortly thereafter, and was accurately prepared to order.

3-1/2 stars overall, but as others have noted, one can find better Mexican fare elsewhere in the city at a much lower price point.  So, it seems dining patrons are being charged extra for the fine special authentic hacienda ambiance.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,3,3,EcmjueUObMVB7LDxtkqkaw

5854301,2015-11-11,6,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"It's very rare for me to eat at a 3 star restaurant (yes, I am a food snob) but I will make an exception when it's a brand new restaurant.  I don't think it's fair to rush out to a brand new anything and expect it to be running like a well-oiled machine.  Everyone and everything is new and needs a little time to get acclimated as you do at a new job or at something you have never done.  I was willing to give them a chance and I'm glad I did.  I have been twice in the last week and both experiences were great.  The hostesses are warm and welcoming and get you seated fairly quickly.  I was able to make reservations which I always appreciate and they sat us before the entire party arrived which is a plus.  Both servers were attentive and got our orders correct.  The manager stopped by our table both times to make sure that all was well.  

My husband really likes the cadillac margarita and the fajitas.  The queso is very different (cream cheese, cheese and artichoke hearts) but was very good.  You can't skip dessert at a Mexican restaurant...Flan, Tres Leches and Fried Ice Cream...oh yes!!!

I need a new paragraph for this item, the Carne Asada Quesadilla.  Oh my word!!  It happened to be cheat day and a quesadilla sounded delicious but it's hard to find a good one.  I couldn't be happier that I ordered one here.  The tortilla was super fresh, perfection really.  The cheese was plentiful.  Then there is the carne asada, oh man!  If you are a fellow quesadilla snob you know that your quesadilla could come out with big chunks of beef, no thank you, or fatty pieces of meat, um no, or hardly any meat at all, no bueno!  However, Pancho's has got it right with perfect small strips of super juicy carne asada with perfect flavor.  Oh man was it good!  Cheat day + Pancho's Carne Asada Quesadilla = One happy girl!

The prices reflect location, it's Summerlin!  If you live in Summerlin you are use to paying a higher price tag and if you are driving from afar you must realize you are driving to Summerlin.",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,10,9,4,0wugYhOqj1annGkrRh4lSg

The people had to walk in between 2 customers chairs to get in and out. They shouldn't have table at that spot. Overall they need to remove some tables from the place period!! Not comfy seating environment. The manager dropped a dirty fork on my friend's shoulder and didn't even apologize. We asked for a move, which took another 20 minutes because the host forgot about us. Finally they moved us to another table. The manager came smoozed with us after but he never acknowledged the fork incident. 

The food is mediocre, I ordered a $25 menu item which should've of been $11.99 at most places. It's very overpriced, these prices work for Manhattan Beach , CA for their original location, not Vegas. The food is bland and uninspiring, especially when we have amazing Mexican food here like Lindo, La Mojarra Loca...etc etc. To diners who love food, this is a skip!",I0bI_DAQ4h-9WPrVWdwolg,12,3,1,VmVjBlpuzw0dnTUctbsaTA

The wife order the ""Wahoo tacos"" and I order the Enchilada de carnitas. The tacos tasted like frozen, over cooked fish, that they tried to cover up with bagged cabbage. So much so, that my wife sent it back, which never happens. The staff was understanding, apologetic and was willing to replace the meal. The enchilada de carnitas tasted ok, at best. The meat was tough, not tender or savory. My daughter order a kids meal quesadilla which was cold. Every meal on the menu was at least $20. This is place was disappointing.

We always start with a house margarita- one with salt for my boyfriend and one with tajin for me, the chips are always warm and the salsa is great! Depending on our appetite and mood we will either share the steak fajitas which we always request medium rare and comes with tortillas and all the sides or a three item combo with a chicken taco, and two cheese enchiladas.

5910926,2016-03-20,3,m-xsH8VkcYtTTvp2Fa6Ajw,"This has got to be the cutest Mexican restaurant with a real Spanish hacienda house feel!! The decor is beautiful and festive :) 

However, the food is PRICEY.  It's almost like paying Strip prices!! All entrees are approx $15+. 
Now, I get it....Mexican food is often marginalized and placed in the ""cheap food"" category, like most Chinese restaurants outside of the Strip and Chinatown.  If you're looking for a really great/fancy Mexican meal, you should probably be charged for it. But I argue that the price here does not match the food that is provided.  I ordered a chicken & mango salad and it was $18.  The salad was good, but not $18 good.  The salad portion was like the boxed greens from costco, and the mango was not very ripe. Chicken was juicy and had some great umami flavoring, but not overly impressed with the salad as a whole.  My friend ordered the fish tacos, which came in a cook fish-shaped plate! Also $18, and likewise not worth the price. 

Ultimately, Pancho's is a fun and festive restaurant but it's catering to the wrong crowd. If you have a cartoon character wearing a sombrero as your sign, you prob shouldn't be charging up to $20 for a meal.  Just sayin'. 

Would def recommend for a fun date night or bday.

Went for happy hour in the bar on a Saturday afternoon, plenty of room to pick a seat and quickly taken care of.

The food on the happy hour menu is good on the weekends even though the menu says drinks only Saturday and Sunday. The waitress made sure we were aware. Started with chips and salsa and they were really good. 

Ordered the appetizer platter which was amazing. So good and highly recommend. My friend got the tortilla soup and said it was delish. We also ordered the Queso- this tasted like a dish of sour cream, and was huge. The waitress noticed we weren't eating it and asked about it, we told her it wasn't our favorite or what we expected and she said she would take it off the bill no problem.

Hubby's taco combination bland - no salsa, no taco sauce on them or even on the table.

They started the service with chips and salsa. The chips were crunchy and tasty and were paired with very fresh tasting salsa. It's also nice and spicy which we appreciated. 

The salad was so-so but a good option for those wanting a fresh start. If they could add a Mexican cheese, a bit of guacamole and a salsa verde instead of the regular vinaigrette that would make this dish even better. Ask for a salsa verde on the side. 

The tacos al pastor were very good. The meat is generous and marinated well so it was quite tasty. 

The taquitos are a must-order. Typically I stay away from taquitos because it is so oily and heavy. But these are not the oil-laden taquitos you get from the neighborhood restaurant. They are lightly fried and stuffed with well-seasoned meat. They were generous with toppings and came with an awesome salsa verde. 

But the best part of the night was the plate of carnitas enchiladas. The dish was deeply flavorful. There were so many layers of taste that came out that you can tell someone took great care to make this dish. The pork was so tasty but not overly seasoned as some carnitas can get. The garlic onion and cumin flavors are subtle enough to just bring out the pork flavor. The salsa cut the fatty taste of the pork in just the right way. The cheese and sour cream added heft to the dish. I loved it. The refried beans that came with the plate were not that glop of mush that you normally get in other restaurants. They were whole beans that had wonderful texture and taste. 

Lastly, the service was great - Fernando was our server and was very nice. He worked fast and never tried to push us to order anything. When we asked him for suggestions, he didn't push the most expensive dish on the menu and actually told us what he thought was really good. The manager, Doug made sure to go up to every table and ask how things were going. It helped round out a great dinner.",60OhUP904CWpFUOWKdI1gg,0,1,4,1WOa6zrZ3R7RJY7Tzh1bbw
