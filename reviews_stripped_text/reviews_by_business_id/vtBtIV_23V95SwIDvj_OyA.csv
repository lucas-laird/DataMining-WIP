They have a variety of fresh-made rings (boiled for the NY taste!) and house-made schmears, which always make a great breakfast. I enjoyed the Super Egg (egg + everything seasoning) with scallion. I did not notice a lox sandwich on the menu, which is my usual go-to.  
 
They offer lunch and dinner service, as well as a case of pastries (didn't see black and whites) and various daily breakfast plate specials. Several reviews compare this spot to Bagel Cafe, and I can see how this is a smaller alternative to consider if you live in the area. I can recommend this location but it's a bit out of my way to come regularly myself.

TIP: Grab your bagel and schmear to go, then pop by Aware Coffee en route to the freeway!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,13,4,sTZCNgJRr8SmPHPtNNpmSw

She never asks or tells you what sauce or side salad comes with your order. The burger is really good but they still refuse to use a higher quality bun instead you get a bun that looks like it came from the store that cost .99 for an 8pk. I ordered a fried chicken breast sandwich. Breast being the key word. Only to find it was 2 fried chicken tenders instead. I guess tenders are technically breast pieces. There was more batter than chicken. This place could be better they are cutting corners obviously. I'll give them one more try but not on a Monday.

They have more donuts than bagels (which all looked like heaven by the way ). Not only that but there are tables right in front of them and there was a family sitting there enjoying their breakfast and I felt like I was on top of them while trying to pick a bagel (sorry family).  There is NO menu when you walk in. The nice hostess came up to me when I was in line and asked what I'd like to order- ""uhhh do you guys have a menu?"" She apologized and went and grabbed me a little menu pamphlet. Once I ordered there was no place to wait without being in the way and stepped outside then came back in.

Everything out our meal and experiance was perfect!!! Truthfully I wish more of my experiences were as good as this one.

Today we tried three menu items and thanks to the Yelp Review Special we received a free doughnut. The staff was really sweet and made us feel like we were regulars. We ordered the Biskets and Gravey, the Breakfast Croissant Sandwich  (sauage with american cheese), and a kids menu chicken fingers. 

1. The biskets and gravey were a 4/5 for me but a 5/5 for my daughter. The sausage is really really good and the gravey has just the right amount of pepper and salt. The biskets are fantastic. I'm going to try something different next time but would definitely recommend trying this if you are lover of B&G.

2. You guys, the breakfast croissant sandwich was very best breakfast sandwich I've eaten in Las Vegas (...yes I paid for my meal and yes, I'm still telling you it was THAT good!!!) The croissant was the perfect amount of crispy but NOT DRY!! I chose sausage and I'm so glad I did!! For $6.50 I will never bother going anywhere else. Also comes with the most delicious fruit bowl. 100% I must try.

3. So my daughter turned 10 last month and we are going back and forth between the kids menu and the regular menu. Today she chose the chicken fingers off the kids menu. She and I were both pleasantly surprised. You know how sometimes kids meals just come out gross .... this was not the case at all. I hate to keep saying that everything was ""the best ever"" but realistically after one bite my daughter said ""these are the best chicken fingers I've ever had"" . The French Fries are what I think of when you order fries somewhere. Fresh and crispy. P.S. for all you ranch Fanatics you have got to try there's. Oh my God delicious!! Thank me later 

Can't wait to come back back and try all their other goodies. I didn't even get to talk about their pastries and fresh bread! That's for the next post!!",g73QLrVANuqE8bdMlnIOXQ,3,1,5,INYs7a07Tn5PICv_tdyRvw

The first time we came here my girlfriend and I ordered 2  cheese omelets with sausage. The lady in the front told us that the meals came with a drink and also asked whether we wanted our sausage on the side or in the omelet. We got specialty bagels so they costed extra. My girlfriend didn't get charged for the cream cheese or the bagel. And I know this because my girlfriend and I paid separately and she paid 11.37. Her meal consisted of a cheese omelet with sausage ON THE SIDE , with a raisin bagel and strawberry cream cheese. My meal consisted of a cheese omelet with sausage INSIDE, with a plain bagel with jalapeño cheddar and I paid 14.37, they both came with drinks. So I got charged 3 dollars and more just for a specialty cream cheese? Seriously? 
I don't understand why the prices were different. I even had to check my bank statement just to make sure I wasn't trippin. 

The second visit, which was 1/27/18. Both our meals costed 11.37, ordered the exact same thing and when I asked the cashier if it came with a drink she said no. She handed us our food and asked if we ordered anything else but the bagels weren't in the bag. She would've forgotten our bagels if we didn't ask for them? Also, she didn't ask if we wanted our sausage inside the omelet or on the side.

Our drinks were empty and eventually my Mom just got up and filled them herself. Her sandwich fell apart as soon as she got it and she had to eat it with a fork and knife. We took desserts to go, so hopefully they are good. My soup was good but would have been better if it actually had the noodles I was expecting. The service was severely lacking.

I have to say I was extremely pleased with everything!! Whoohoo! Honestly, the bagels at Weiss and Bagel cafe are just a tad better. Also, they have salt bagels which are my favorite. But Jamboree didn't have salt bagels. However all of that is minor. Overall the bagels got 4 out of 5 stars from me, the cream cheese was delish and gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and the apple fritters..... well they get a 10 out of 5 stars from me!

The beef dip was OK, but I didn't receive the 3 specialty bagels I paid for. Wasted $30 but now I know it's not worth the effort with so many other places to eat at on centennial drive.",EhO3ra8phpmydiX6lq268g,0,0,2,pukskbaDpVMzIqgCT9Ao-w

He said it was super yummy. I had poached eggs with bacon and toast.  My eggs were cooked perfect.

Went here this morning for breakfast, our coffee came out with bubbles in the mugs when my mom asked the waitress where the bubbles came from she said it happens when she pours the coffee. No thanks. There are 8 tables and 6 people working there they are so disorganized one girl runs around doing everything. They put all of the food in their microwave before they bring it out so it seems like it just came off the grill. They must have forgotten to do that with my moms pancakes because There were cold. We had to get up and refill our own drinks. Food was okay not great. We will not be back",xG6RnvIT_UXxGnlGC0P7zg,0,0,1,iHPHsYQJ3A33LHO5910Mzg

They don't make their own pastrami. Omelet was OK, but didn't look like they used fresh eggs, maybe egg beater. Asked for chicken soup, sorry not today. Some items on their website are no longer on their on site place. I really wanted a bologna sandwich, but not on the menu. Place is very simple looking.

Their prices are right on par with other homemade bagel shops, and they do 14 bagels for $12.50.  I will definitely make this place my new home for fresh bagels.
