Once there, I notice it was pretty empty, the cashier area was a little messy, kind of a red flag. Anyhow, ordered horchata it was SUPER thick, & tasted like super sweet whole milk. I order the chicken pastor tacos, eh, I also order a fish taco. It was ok. Here's where I was really dissatisfied. The churros were sooooo stale!!! Not even my 3 year old daughter ate them. I paid $6! For two. Yikes. Food looks pretty & good on the gram, but I don't think I would go back. Sorry, I really wanted to love this place.",_V2NKoKLRN17b4j6n1JF_w,0,0,1,wh5ZE9__ZR9XBbL1EgfF0w

Ever since I moved into this area I have been looking for a decent Mexican place, with no real luck. I was excited to try Bruno's because of the great reviews, and it exceeded expectations.

It's a new place, and they've started with a small menu, as they probably should. Several kinds of tacos, chips with guacamole, and not much else. Great! Taco me.

These tacos are no joke. The guacamole is no joke. As good as it gets.

And here's the thing: if you're with that one annoying friend who needs vegetarian options, they've got you covered. It's not just one vegetarian taco and that's what you get; no, here, all of the various taco varieties have unique vegetarian options! If, as in my case, your one annoying friend happens to be your girlfriend, you will be delighted to have found this place.

They give you four different salsas, ranging from mild to hot, and unlike other places, ALL of them are amazing. The hottest one is a revelation. I just love it.

It's cheap. You order at the counter and they give you a number and bring your food out to your table. The people are really nice and friendly. This place is perfect. If you don't go here you are really missing out.",JV0asALxmnJGmnfrHul0tg,1,0,5,pDVJr78llvBP00GbuKeHrQ

1263747,2018-04-04,0,R_z9LFtqbBB9pANO530w9w,"Found this while scrolling through Instagram. It is definitely is an Instagram kind of place. They offer lattes w/ just about any picture you want placed on top of it. You download their app and select what you like from their options. There are 100s of options. If you don't like any you can submit a photo of yourself too! 

When you walk in you can see that it is a VERY clean place. Not just because it's still pretty new of a few months, but you'll know what I mean when I walk in. There is about 6 tables and 2 family style table tops. So you could get about 40 people in this place comfortably. 

The excitement to come here was pretty high. I had a friend that came in and told me about their bacon guacamole. This has bacon, not just on top, but INSIDE. Bacon in every bite! So then there were the options of all the tacos. They have 7 options and the option to go vegetarian. They bring you a flight of 4 hot sauces. 

Chicken - SO tender
Cauliflower - it doesn't taste like it though, more like pineapple
Baja fish - LOTS of cabbage, like waaaaaaaaay too much
Steak - Very well marinated 
Short Rib - OMG! 
Carnitas - spot on

I saw that they brought out green shelled tacos. No one told us about this as it was St. Patrick's day. Not only that, but we weren't offered ice cream to go on top of our churros. We were overwhelmed w/ all the goodness it would've been nice to have a little hand holding w/ these two things. 

This place is right up the road from my house, so when I'm home I may just have a new taco spot to frequent.",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,2,1,4,PPOn6kC1Dm0iNdngZ_vhPA

Located across from Southern Hills Hospital, it sits in a shopping complex just west of the hospital on Fort Apache, just north of Sunset. 

The restaurant is very open and bright with lots of high bar tables and chairs and tables around.

The menu is very simple. Consists of 7 different tacos and a possible ""Taco of the Week""

(vegetarian substitute - marinated portabello mushroom)

Churros (2 per order - 4 pieces when cut in half) in cinnamon sugar, caramel, chocolate and coconut, almond and chocolate, or fruity pebble. Add a scoop of ice cream for $1.50 extra 

----------------

We had ordered two tacos each and I decided to get some churros as a surprise dessert as well ! She had wanted the 'Potato Chorizo Taco' and 'Carnitas Taco' whereas I had gotten the 'Grilled Skirt Steak Taco' and 'Baja Fish Taco'. Originally cashier had mentioned a pork belly taco that was the taco of the week, but apparently on Wednesdays, that's when they change it and was still in the midst of R&D. I had gotten the 'Chocolate & Coconut' churros for us to have as a nice sweet dessert as well ! 

You have the choice of picking either flour tortillas, corn tortillas, or lettuce, or lettuce wrap. I chose flour tortillas for all as I was curious on theirs. 

You also have the choice of hot sauce, ranging from 1 to 4. I asked for mild and hot but got all 4 anyway. 1 was like a jalapeno tomatillo? whereas the 4 was like a mango habenero

Their flour tortillas are fairly big. Maybe about 2x the size of a normal taco tortilla. 

The 'Grilled Skirt Steak Taco' had a lot of against-the-grain cut skirt steak topped with a yummy chimichurri sauce. Skirt steak was tender and flavorful. Due to the size of the flour tortilla, it made it seem like there wasn't much meat but there was a good amount. Unlike the other tacos, there is more toppings. The skirt steak doesn't have much. 

The 'Baja Fish Taco' was the larger of the two. Topped with cabbage slaw and pickled onions, using the number 4 hot sauce made it really yummy. Large battered fish filet spanning the length of the flour tortilla topped with a nice light slaw and pickled onions was quite yummy. It's been a long while since I've had fish tacos and this one fit the spot quite well. 

The Chocolate and Coconut churros were decent. Freshly made in house made the churro more crispy than chewy. I think there's a bit too much cinnamon sugar but the drizzled chocolate and coconut flakes were nice. Could probably knock off half the sugar though. 

The pricing may seem a bit more than other places but their tacos are definitely larger. You pay around 2.50 - 3 bux each for street tacos but you have a much smaller double corn tortilla'ed taco with a few pieces of meat. They load it up here for less than double the price. They box each taco individually (not sure if its cuz we had 4 different tacos) 

I saw a plate of the guacamole come out while I was waiting and you get a ton of chips on a plate with a bowl of the guacamole in the middle. 

Overall, not bad. Yeah mildly pricier but probably the best quality tacos I've had so far in vegas. Too bad no beef tongue though. Would definitely come back but not definitely for dinner. Im pretty sure id go broke if i did",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,n2vQBn-2lI8SoTVJYo7Scg

We ordered flank steak, fish, and carnitas tacos as well as chips & guac and 2 lattes. My kids enjoyed their steak. My husband said his carnitas was good but nothing impressive. The first initial bite of my fish tacos were good but the batter was a bit much and became soggy rather quickly. The portioning was way off too. Same with the chips & guacamole.. the guacamole to chips ratio was way off. The lattes were good and fun since we got to personalize it. The variety of salsa was good too, though the pico de gallo looked more like water with some onion and tomato in it.",3vdmLTUfhFjsMds_ii0qvw,0,0,3,y112FHHS5dN_9-dDlgcuXQ

1682364,2018-03-02,0,R_z9LFtqbBB9pANO530w9w,"First of all, I just yelled at the waitress for 3 minutes about how good the salsas are. They don't sell them by the bottle either which I can understand but at the same time, can't understand. The tomato jalapeño has such a unique flavor, the Pico is made with green tomatoes which is a cool twist to traditional pico, the tomatillo was hotter than I expected but still smokey and delicious, and then there's the passion fruit habanero which sent my tastebuds to actual hell in the best way possible.

Chips and poblano guac really set the tone. Lots of places get chips and guac right and Bruno's was no exception. 

I ordered the carnitas, chicken al pastor, and short rib tacos all on corn. The tacos weren't overdressed with topping or sauce which I liked. It allowed me to appreciate the flavor of the meat which really held its own. The short rib was melty and flaky, so it's good quality meat that's cooked properly. The chicken was charred and juicy. The carnitas were your standard carnitas but with a chicharron on top, still absolutely worth a try. 

Also had the Chile mango margarita. Speaks for itself, really. 

Finished off with the chocolate almond churro, no ice cream because I needed to leave with at least some dignity. Churro was crispy on the outside but oh so soft and gooey on the inside (much like myself). Had some chocolate drizzle with like 6,000 almonds on top which actually might have been too many almonds for this churro but I'm not complaining, because almonds are tight, and I fuck with almonds. 

The service was great! Very friendly and helpful staff. It's a well lit and spaced out dining room. So many beer options which is unique for a walk-up style restaurant.

1749436,2018-06-13,0,R_z9LFtqbBB9pANO530w9w,"The quality of the food was good, but not worth the experience of the rest.

This is essentially a tapas restuarant. Over-priced tiny plates & drinks. If you like over-paying, this is the spot for you.

I arrived around 5:45pm and was greeted abd ordered a couple drinks. Too expensive, but I was there to meet up with friends and have a good time. $60 personally in food & drinks +tips (plus what the 5 other people in my party had eventually ordered) later, they ran out of the beer we were drinking and refused to substitute 2 bottles when I placed the next order of 5.

Overall, I spent almost $100 here in food, drinks, and tip (then add what the rest of my party spent...). The quality of the food was great but not worth the price of the quantity and then add in the disservice. I have friends whove come here for the last few weeks that Ill be immediately discussing finding a replacement. 

If youre looking for a taco shop with some varying recipes that serves beer definitely consider Fuzzys on Rainbow & 215. The menu is a bit different but the tacos are less expensive and the beera are much larger for much less. If youre looking for Authentic street tacos check out Pepes on Rainbow & Flamingo.

We waited about 20 minutes after placing our order to receive our chips and guac. It was another few minutes for half of our order and about 10 minutes after that for the rest. I had to ask about an agua fresca I ordered, only to be told it was sold out. My husband's latte took about 40 minutes.

It seems their concept is quick casual, but it's anything but quick. After that wait, my expectation is the food should be phenomenal. Again, it was not.

The portabello mushroom taco was drenched in liquid (it wasn't the chimichurri) and the flavor was just okay. The chicken al pastor was also bordering on good, but didn't blow me away.

The guac was great and I really enjoyed the salsa assortment they provide. This was the best part of our dining experience.

Overall, if the service had been better, it could've compensated for the food, and vice versa, if the food had been outstanding, it could've compensated for the service. But it was a double whammy of disappointment.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,4,0,2,T7eaUAEM_srF_fVt3qbiZw

2029942,2017-12-15,16,R_z9LFtqbBB9pANO530w9w,"Aside from the Walgreen's and Top Shelf Wine & Spirits, the plaza that Bruno's occupies has always been weirdly vacant. I hoped since moving here a few years ago that, one day, the plaza would start to see an influx of local food choices. 

That day has come and it happened, seemingly, under the radar. 

Fun fact: Had it not been for my husband asking if I were aware that a new taco spot opened down the street from us, tonight's dinner (and this review) would not have happened. 

Anyway... 

The space is bright and inviting with an ample selection of high and low-level seating. Ordering is done at the counter, where a nicely-sized and easy-to-read-menu is posted. Oh, and the lighting is pro-food porn. 

Once your order is taken, you're given a number and, well, you know the drill...

The menu itself is well-balanced. There are two beef options (skirt steak and braised short rib), one chicken option (pastor), two pork options (chorizo & potato and carnitas with chicharron and guacamole), one fish option (baja-style), one veg, and one taco of the month. BUT - AND IT'S A BIG BUT - for each of the meat options I listed, THERE IS A VEGETARIAN OPTION.  Carnivores and vegetarians can now sit at the table and enjoy a carnitas taco or, its equivalent, a shredded jackfruit taco. Game changer, friends. Game. Changer. As far as the tacos went, I tried all of the options except for the vegetarian alternatives, and they were all good. My ranking keeps changing but, for now, I'd say: 1. chorizo and potato (which is never the case), 2. chicken pastor (also never the case because I don't count chicken as a legitimate taco meat choice), 3. baja fish (nice crunch and beer batter flavor), 4. carnitas, 5. guajillo short rib, 6. skirt steak (beautiful slices of meat), and 7. calabacitas (my carnivorous colors come through, again, but still good!). 

My husband and I chose all corn tortillas despite the ability to select those, flour, or lettuce wrap. The corn tortillas were a surprise treat. They were warm and soft, thanks to being handmade on-site. We were able to try the flour tortilla, which was equally warm and soft, with a flour feel that can only come from being super duper freshly made. 

We also ordered the classic guacamole, which comes with those thick, crunchy tortilla chips that cause me to black out and wake up finding that I inhaled enough chips to have turned myself into a literal dough of masa. The guacamole was bright and crisp (though I may have liked more salt). There are three other options that I'll need to try again soon (tropical, bacon, and poblano/queso fresco). 

Our meal was served with a salsa sampler that was plated in order of heat. I didn't find anything to be particularly spicy (I prefer heat). However, the salsas were clearly fresh and all had good flavor. 

BONUS POINTS: Alcohol available. I had the pineapple jalapeno margarita. I mentioned later that I felt the drink could use more heat. For those like me, I'm told this can be requested when ordering. I will definitely do this next time. 

SUPER BONUS POINTS: My husband ordered the horchata. His reaction upon sipping, ""YO! This might be the best horchata I've had."" Skeptical, I took a sip. Mind you, I never order horchata. I usually will take a sip of my husband's and am reminded why I never order it because it's usually bland, too strong, or too watery. This one was nicely flavored and creamy AF. It makes me actually interested in having an horchata latte from the coffee menu (yes, there's coffee, too!). 

SUPER DUPER BONUS POINTS: Though not listed, one can absolutely order a michelada. And that's important because we all deserve a michelada every now and again. 

By the end of our meal, we were too full for dessert. Hopefully, I can keep some space available next time to venture on to the churros menu (6 flavors, all with the option to add ice cream!). 

Currently, they are only open during evening hours. Lunch hours are on the horizon after the holidays, as well as happy hour specials.

But they actually bring the food and drinks out to where you are sitting which I thought was a step up above the rest. Somewhere in between a restaurant and a Chipotle. 

The food: I tried the chorizo/potato taco and the vegetarian friendly zucchini ribbon taco. The chorizo taco was full of flavor on a corn tortilla. It ad delicious flavor but could have used a bit more potato. The drizzled sauce was delicious. The zucchini taco had great flavor for a veggie taco but the water content in the zucchini made it a little soggy. 

The lady who brought our food out gave us a sample of four different salsas which went from a tomatillo salsa to a chipotle passionfruit. They were delicious.

The final note on Bruno's is the beer selection. They have an impressive selection of craft beers which I thought really took it to another level. Tacos and beer, couldn't ask for anything more! I will come back with a friend.",IvzfT_UoNxl0VL-mhnuwsw,0,0,4,jHvb5ZN5WcQjza8tMo0t9g

Small little joint with GOOD food and great customer service. I like how their menu is simple with just a few items categorized into tacos, guacamole, churros, and drinks. It made it easy for me to make up my mind on what to eat haha. 

As for the food I got-
Braised Short Rib Taco $4.25 each : this was my favorite. The meat was tender, juicy, and melts in your mouth. 
Chicken Al Pastor $3.95 each: I loved the pineapple pico that it comes with it.
Classic guac $5.00 : simple, came with chips.
Chocolate almond churro with vanilla ice cream $7.50 : OhhEmmGee yummm.
They have vegetarian options. With the tacos, you can get them on flour/corn tortillas or lettuce. Your table will also get 4 samples of salsa. It goes from mild to hot. I was able to do the hot salsa....which means it's not that spicy. The place was packed on a Friday evening.

They also left off the slaw that contained crema, but kinda wilted some fresh cabbage up so is still got that component. Then topped with pickled onions!

I ordered my churros and ice cream and when the super friendly girl behind the counter (I didn't catch her name) told me about their $2.00 draft special I knew it was something my husband would appreciate. 

My husband ordered his beer and had a potato and chorizo taco.

Now what caught my eye were two things: they have Tecate AND they have a salsa sampler. I'm from SoCal and can appreciate an ice cold Tecate and as a Latina i definitely appreciate my salsa.

The taco was great, the churros were yummy and the ice cream was a nice touch. 

Good tacos are hard to find here so my husband and I are excited to try everything on the menu. 

Did I mention the freshly made tortillas??? Yup, FRESH and so so good.

· Chips + Guac - 
Tasted fresh & homemade. The guacamole was super good mixed w/ the passionfruit habanero sauce. Both needed a hit of salt & w/out the sauces, guac needed some acid. 4/5 
· Potato Chorizo Taco - 
Not very pretty as it arrives to the table, but fold that sucker over & dive in. SO GOOD. It is one note on texture, but it's yummy enough not to worry about it. Ordered this one on the fresh homemade flour tortillas, would do that every time! 4.5/5
· Skirt Steak Taco - 
I was skeptical, from fellow yelper's photos, I noticed it lacks toppings (I love toppings!). Thinking it could be dry & low on flavor. Nope! I was impressed, it didn't need to hide-behind-a-thing. It's like, ""That's right, I am literally just meat. In a tortilla. What?!"" Not very photogenic but the meat was so juicy, cooked perfectly pink. Steak tastes like it's marinated for a couple of days, packed with garlic-y & bright chimichurri. Paired really great with the warm corn tortilla, too. Hubby mentioned how good the combo of corn/meat were. I agree, the flavors pair like Scooby & Shaggy. 5/5
· Salsas:
4 sauces arrive w/ your meal, mild to hot. My favorite by far was the hottest, the habanero passion fruit. Bottle that, I would buy it. My second favorite was the pico, more of a Pico de Gallo Verde. The sourness of the tomatillos made it an interesting & tart twist on pico. The 2 mixed were fire: tart, sweet, hot.
· Pineapple Jalapeno Margarita - Ordered it extra spicy. The lovely lady mixing drinks added a chili powdered rim to up the spice, which was my favorite detail because it made it interesting, otherwise it was very sweet. Mine had 3 jalapeños; I was still looking for some heat & tequila flavor. The pineapple wipes out a lot of that. Next time, I'll give the chili mango a try, which they recommended to me originally. 3/5
· Fruity Pebbles Churro - 
Yes! It's a little dangerous that these are available close to home. 5/5

Service was welcoming. It's a fast casual set up, where you order at the register and orders arrived at the table. The ladies were great at explaining what each dish was, gave some recommendations - like upping the heat on the drink for me. They waited for our mains to be done before bringing out piping hot churros. Much appreciated as they were fresh and warm instead of sitting out while we ate our dinners 1st. They can tweak a couple of things, but overall the simple menu, the flavorful & filling tacos, their vegetarian and lo-carb options, their beer menu is awesome and service is warm & on point- it's a 4.75 from me so let's round up :)

Before getting my nails done, I needed lunch. As I looked around in the plaza, at first I was going to get a personal pan pizza, but the pizza restaurant didn't appear they had any seats available. I then decided on Bruno's and I'm so glad that I did.

My lunch order consisted of beer battered fish taco and the potato chorizo taco. Almost forgot, I also got the watermelon drink. I did ask if they had any sides as I do like Spanish rice and beans with my Mexican dish, but unfortunately they don't offer any.

To keep this as short and sweet as possible, everything I ordered was super YUMMY!

Watermelon drink was so good and refreshing. It seems like people come in just for the drinks and rightly so.

Tacos are delivered to your table with a flight of sauces. I tried all four of them even the very spicy pineapple Habaneros (sp?) sauce, which wasn't spicy at all.  The sauce on the potato chorizo taco was spicier.

I enjoyed the potato chorizo and I'm looking forward to my next visit to try out the potato and soyrizo, the vegetarian option.

And for the beer battered fish taco -  Please Bruno's Taco Bar, make a fish and chips version!! The beer battered fish is just too good to keep it in tacos.

I stopped drinking because of my obnoxious alter-ego, but if you can handle your liquor, Bruno's serves up beers and margaritas.

The only thing keeping this review from being 5-stars, is the price and the lack of sides. My fish taco was over $4.25 while my chorizo taco was over $3.65 and my drink $3. So for two tacos and a drink, my total came out to over $11.

Fruity pebble churro 
Tecate beer.

Both tacos were DELICIOUS! The skirt steak on lettuce was perfect, although I will say it seemed a little skimpy on the chimichurri. 
Chorizo potato was filling and the spicy crema was delicious! Not too spicy either.
The fruity pebble churro was very good, I recommend you split it with someone. I wouldn't be able to eat the two pieces by itself.
The beer prices seem fair and decent.
It's brand new so it's very clean.

More importantly the customer service was amazing. 
The staff remembered our names when we went up to order dessert, they seemed happy and pleasant.
I'll be back! 
Please open your restaurant for more hours though, I keep recommending your place to friends but the times and days of being open don't work for some people.",WZojlBpeuNhNew_EjB7GLA,4,5,5,v8x3N2D1876k5WV6W0pGkg

The tortillas are made hand fresh and you can taste the quality. I had the skirt steak and short rib tacos and both were excellently prepared. The chips and guac was delicious. They definitely don't short you on the guac it's a perfect size portion. They have a flight of salsas that come out with the food which gives you plenty of options on how spicy you want to make your food. The churros are fresh and great. This place has only been open for a week but they are definitely doing it right. You won't regret coming here for food but you might regret leaving here without buying something to take home.

I ordered my food (the carnitas taco) and it was very plain when I got it. The only thing on it was pork and guacamole. Not to mention we only got one taco, with no side at all. I had to spend extra money to get chips and guacamole, which was pretty stupid. The orders also came out one at a time, which meant that since the portions were incredibly small, I was finished with my food before the rest of my family even got theirs. The only good thing I could take away from this restaurant is it was relatively clean, minus the bathrooms. It would have been nicer if they had rice and beans or something as a side, but no. We got one small taco for a meal. The food was pretty average and plain and it didn't have a lot of flavor. With just carnitas and guacamole on my taco it was hard to enjoy it.

When I saw the hilarious, high-quality latte art they produce at Bruno's on Instagram, I knew I had to check this place out. And when I saw that they have vegetarian substitutes for ALL of their tacos, I knew I was destined to be a regular customer. (By the way, their latte art is machine-based, so you can even submit your own vector image to them and they'll make you a custom latte with your picture.)

On a whim, we ordered lattes with Tupac and Big E. They turned out great! Although I've never had a horchata latte before - I guess I assumed it would be like a matcha latte and not contain coffee? I was wrong, and that's my bad. I only had a few sips before handing it off to my husband so he can have an extreme caffeine high. It seemed good though! 

I tried the soyrizo and jackfruit tacos - and both were really good and pretty large for street tacos. They also gave us a huge assortment of salsas to try while we ate there.

For starters, customer service is great! They are all so nice and polite and just a breath of fresh air for something that's a little more fast paced.

Secondly the ambience is equally as amazing. Nice and clean, very modern little taco shop. It has a less authentic taco place kind of feel for it, but the flavor of the tacos and how well they season it definitely makes up for it. 

So now the tacos. The tacos make me excited just writing this review! I had the fish taco and their taco of the week, which was sriracha shrimp, and my boyfriend had their short rib taco and grilled skirt steak and we shared a portobello taco. I am on some sort of flexidiet where I eat primarily pescatarian but I will have bites here and there of meat. And trying my boyfriends tacos made me want to devour the whole thing! (A very rare rare desire) the tenderness of both meats were unreal. The short rib was a little too salty for my tasting, but that did not make it any less delicious. The skirt steak was cooked at just the right temperature, flavored with just the right seasonings. Now my tacos. Lol. A tad less excited for, but they did an amazing job having vegetarian options available as well as fish. Their fish taco has an enormous beer battered fish on it! I had to put some of their salsa on it (WHICH BY THE WAY, ARE ALL SO SO SO GOOD) The sriracha shrimp one was the better one out of the two. It was battered as well, perfectly crispy and saucy and just amazing. And lastly, the least exciting of them all - the mushroom taco. I had tried a mushroom taco elsewhere and fell in love it, this one not so much. It is the vegetarian option for the skirt steak, but I loved everything about the skirt steak and not too much about the mushroom one. I felt like it needed more mushrooms or sauce bc I tasted a lot more of the tortilla than anything else. 

So there ya have it! Definitely make this one of your taco Tuesday spots to try out!! So good!!",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,6,2,5,KJNWooamqGTBFAYvU8Fo5Q
4183191,2018-03-16,0,R_z9LFtqbBB9pANO530w9w,"Came here for lunch. It seems this place is more bar than taco. The taco menu only had 7 tacos. There was a ""taco of the week"", but they were ""out""? The beer and liquor menu was huge though. They also have a guacamole menu, churro menu, and coffee menu. I was only interested in a simple lunch; tacos and a soda.

I ordered the steak taco, fish taco, and a pork taco. These tacos were really delicious; however, they are about $4/ each and only à la carte. They also don't have fountain drinks, but instead, mexican coke. So after 3 tacos and a soda, my lunch was almost $18. One thing I did really enjoy is that they bring you out a flight of salsa. The salsas really help put the tacos over the edge. 

I would love to come back to try some of the guac, but coffee and tacos doesn't sound appetizing, and beer during a work day lunch isn't going to happen. I'll probably have to wait for a weekend when I can get the full effect.",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,3,1,4,6_PAao8FvzPFlmYJkydULg

Carnitas taco had a slight spice, again very flavorful topped with chicharron and guacamole.  Boyfriend got the chorizo and potato taco, wow!  Loved it.

When deciding which tacos to order, they explained everything in delicious detail.  You can tell that they have pride in their restaurant.  We order the skirt steak, carnitas and short rib tacos.
The grilled marinated skirt steak with Mexican chimichurri sauce was so tender. Not fatty, but juicy with so much flavor.    The braised short rib taco was out of this world good.  The salsas ranged from mild to sweat on my temples hot.  Even with the heat, I couldn't resist their flavor.  I had chai tea latte with shot of espresso with almond milk.  Not too sweet and yummy.  :-)  My BF had the Saint Archer white ale.  They have a good selection of draft and bottles.  I can't wait to try their margaritas!
We took the Cinnamon sugar churros to go (school night)  They were still delicious when we got home.
We will be back!

UPDATE:
Next visit, I tried my tacos with lettuce.  Each served on a piece of butter lettuce, I tried the fish, chicken adobo and skirt steak (again).

The inside of the restaurant is clean simply decorated. There were large tables, small tables, and some bar style seating for solo diners. They had more seating than restaurants like this usually have which is nice. 

Food is ordered and paid for at the counter and then brought to the table. The food came out quickly and the employee serving our food explained the different salsas. Salsa types are also on a list on the table, they range from mild to hot. When we ordered the woman at the counter offered to bring our churros later in the meal so they'd be warm. This worked out well and the server remembered to bring them without us having to return and check on them. 

We ordered a variety of items and loved almost everything we ordered.
Passion fruit Margarita- yum, the passion fruit puree tasted fresh and it was the perfect balance of the sweet fruit and the alcohol
Salsas- four ranging from mild to hot, loved all them, but my favorite was passion fruit habanero 
Bacon Guacamole- topped with plenty of crispy bacon and the guacamole itself had a great flavor and texture, chips were good
Chicken Al Pastor Taco- delicious, tender and well seasoned meat
Grilled Skirt Steak Taco- great flavor and tender meat, loved the chimichurri sauce, my favorite of the tacos
Baja Fish Taco- my least favorite of the tacos, good flavor, but the breading was too thick on the fish and a bit on the soggy side
Guajillo Braised Short Rib- great flavor, but a little saucy and not my favorite of the tacos
Potato Chorizo Taco- awesome, loved the flavor, crispy potatoes made this taco
Cinnnamon Sugar Churros- warm, crispy yet soft inside, delicious

Everything we ordered came to around $45 which didn't seem outrageous for five tacos, guacamole, a margarita, and an order of churros. Individual tacos may seem a bit pricey, but the tacos are larger than street tacos so the pricing made sense to me.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,7,5,5,93eO_mUypHtp75gtaR0mTw
4389150,2018-02-18,0,R_z9LFtqbBB9pANO530w9w,"Maybe I'm missing something, but this place was weird. 
First of all, it's only tacos. Most of them are $4 or more each. One single taco. They do have chips & guacamole, but no rice & beans. They do not have iced tea. 
We ordered the following:
1 carnitas -mediocre, carnitas with guacamole on top, nothing else. 
1 chicken al pastor- bland
1 skirt steak- just an average marinated steak taco with zero toppings 
1 cauliflower al pastor- tasty but lukewarm and nothing super special. The pineapple salsa was the best part. 
Four of us went together. The tacos came out one at a time. It took about five minutes to eat a taco, so by the time I got my taco (last) everyone else was done eating theirs. Mine took about fifteen minutes to arrive to the table.  
I'm giving it two stars rather than one because I like the concept. I think they need to add rice & beans/combo plates. They're cheap & a good filler. They need to make the food come out at once so everyone in a group is eating at the same time. 
This was like an appetizer. If you get several tacos it'll be like $15/person not including drinks.

What sets this place apart from others is the sheer trendiness of it all; the walls and overall decor are begging to be put on social media, they have (surprisingly delicious) lattes that have completely customizable artwork on it-which is how I originally found out about this place, churros with unconventional flavors such as fruity pebbles, etc. I love going here, and I highly suggest trying  it out!!",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,0,0,4,Jv1Q677p0BXJzMavJJ-tLw

My friend girl & I stopped by for tacos and of course their irresistible hip-hop latte art!

(5) Tacos
-The coconut shrimp ""taco of the week"" was decent; no exceptional flavors to rave about.
-Baja Fish Taco $4.25 was okay; breading a bit excessive though
-Carnitas Taco $3.85 The jack fruit was pretty bland but the guac was great. 
My best-friend really enjoyed her carnivore tacos.

(2) Horchata Lattes- I legit enjoyed every sip of my Drizzy lyrics! I could drink these all day long just because. 
(1) Chocolate & Coconut Churro $7- No Bueno! 
(1) Caramel Churro $5 (+1.50 for ice cream) Definitely recommend with the ice cream if your about that sugar life!

$45+ Tip that added up real quick! Unsure if I'll be back for tacos but I'm certain I'll return for a creative latte YOLO!!",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,8,7,3,JsiDgRJmqeZJlVCevzuPrg

They have a good amount of tacos on the menu & I love that they have a few options to make the tacos vegetarian. I was going to give this a 3 star review but settled on 4 after writing this and I'll tell you why.

Let's start with the iffy:
- It could have been because they were short staffed but I felt the service was a bit slow for a ""quick"" taco spot
- The tacos came out one by one, slowly... I'm not sure if that is what they were going for in concept, but I would have liked to have all my tacos come out at once. 
- Lacking in salt for me.. which made all of the tacos taste very one note. 

The better:
- The options of salsa, the tomatillo & habanaro were my favorite & helped to add flavor to the tacos 
- The guac & chips.. probably the best chips I've had in awhile. They didn't feel one bit greasy & were light in texture.
- The chicken pastor taco. It was my favorite out of the 3 I ordered. 
- The churros. I'll leave it at that, they know what they are doing when it come to them. If I hadn't tried them, this review would be sitting at a 3.

I'm thinking they had an off night, with the lack of salt, so I may give the tacos another shot. But right now, if I were to return it would probably be just for the churros & coffee",d-5KtOxrKM6Jer1UhlKrng,2,1,4,WpNSpfaE3EJ4T4Y9StW-GQ

The bacon guacamole and salsa bar were also great. And we definitely couldn't pass up the caramel churros before we left. Staff was friendly as well. 

My only gripe would be that the tortillas got cold too quickly, but I'm a slow eater too ? Also, the single ""$"" here on Yelp is deceiving because the tacos are definitely pricey, but worth it in my opinion.",oGOnU_guFnJe79XaKHWKPw,0,0,5,YH5d7pBtXpTZCmppN_EyIw

Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted. The menu is pretty simple: there are seven types of tacos with the option of substituting the meat with cauliflower. There's also a variety of churros, drinks, and guacamole with chips included. I ordered a fish taco and the chicken al pastor taco, and my boyfriend ordered the potato chorizo and a steak taco. You have the option of choosing flour or corn for the tortilla. The tacos are about six inches long, which is larger than your typical tacos at other eateries. What really stood out to me was the avocado cream that was used on the chicken al pastor. It was so, so flavorful. In addition, the battered fish taco tasted fresh and light. The breading wasn't too heavy either! The food is brought out with a sauce tray with four different spice levels. We also ordered the watermlon agua fresca which was a refreshing addition to the meal. Honestly, it was pricier than other taco joints but I would definitely return for the avocado cream and to try the printed lattes.",52FeOAXrqwKuwZXmH5q_fw,0,0,5,8KRtHsGjVHTGF5ef8BUzqQ

The staff were friendly and the food came out fairly quickly! They were busy, but we waited longer in line than we did in waiting for our food! 

We started with bacon guacamole and salsa bar. The chips are fresh and crispy! The bacon guacamole was freaking amazing!!! I want to have gallons of it at home! They have 4 salsa in their tray. The first is mild and refreshing. They go in order from hot there. The second was ""mild"" but definitely had a kick! I couldn't try third or fourth, but hubby did and he said that he felt his tongue burning  

We ordered the steak taco and carnitas taco. The steak is so good! Tender, flavorful, and the chimi sauce was fresh! They should serve it with huevos rancheros for breakfast! #steakandeggs ! The carnitas were cooked well; tender and great flavor! I couldn't finish mine because there was a ton of meat considering! 

We finished off our delicious dinner with churros! Do not skip the churros!!!! We got an original and a fruity pebbles. I am in love with the fruity pebbles! Hubby loved the original! We didn't try the drinks, but the margaritas looked delicious and they have a wide selection of beer too!
