Recently, I ordered on the app for pick up. I now understand the long wait time. My pizza was ready for me, but there seemed to be about 10-15 pizzas ready to be delivered and picked up! The one thing that bothered me was when I walked in, there were about 8 employees all working; they looked at me but no one greeted or came over to help me...not the best customer service. We enjoy the pizza though.",pGGeh-G4UUxh1QKVWcV_UQ,0,0,4,J3OTfX3O0HOknwaitioXdg
1765040,2017-12-25,1,AmIJMMd9OeT_mUj9DAn2ow,LOVE Papa Johns so I was excited to have them move into our neighborhood!  When I picked up my pizza it looked smaller than normal and I asked the guy who was super super nice about it and he wasn't too sure because he was training. I had a coupon so I really can't complain but they shorted me an inch all around . Even tho they shorted me this time I'll still come back.,ViL7T8ustNSpbVcNHlgJhQ,0,0,4,DLQliEOjan4L2lDvxwGIpg

3593567,2018-01-01,0,AmIJMMd9OeT_mUj9DAn2ow,"Call on 12/31/17 at 9:28pm to place an order for (1) large pizza. On the first call, the guy answered ""thank you for calling Dominos...I mean, Papa Johns."" He then asked if he could place me on hold. I said ok. I was on hold for literally 5 minutes before hanging up and calling back. Same guy answered and just said he needed to put me on hold. I waited another 4 minutes before hanging up and trying back. The third time I called, he just picked up and put me on hold. I hung up and tried again because I wanted to see what the heck was going on at this point. He left the phone off the hook. 

I live about 4 minutes away, so I just drove down there. I parked in front and there was no one inside. A saw a delivery driver leave and, at this point, it was about 10pm. Before I could get to the door, someone locked it and turned the ""open"" sign off. I went to the door and a guy in the back saw me, frowned and turned his back to me. 

Unbelievable. If this is what we have to look forward to from our new neighborhood pizza establishment, then I'll just go back to my older options. So disappointed! I've included screen shots of the calls I made so you can see that this is 100% true...",MI4XFB0Z6Se8dI4Gne9nlA,3,0,1,2RBkIhdxZFEnwGFk7iNgxA
3912444,2018-05-21,0,AmIJMMd9OeT_mUj9DAn2ow,"-0 Worst Customer Service, After an Hour Of Waiting, I called an Some Idiot Answer Stating Pizza Had Just Left And Might Be another 35 Minutes. This is Why Places Like Little Ceasers Are Taking Their Business. Rather Spent 5 Minutes Driving Over Waiting For 1 1/2 Hour Just To Deal With Rude Idiots With No Customer Service at All. My 3rd Time Ordering From Here. Last Time They Brought the Wrong Order and When Finally Arrived it was Cold.",_uzwHsQFMRGLTUwOwkNHRg,0,0,1,PNE_vGT0fadjg1EiTNhOzg

Called, had to hold, gentlemen on the phone ""Isaac"" very nice, communicated very well. I was on hold for a minute maybe. He took my order and was having issues with the system.. so after about a minute of frustration, he let me know he was switching to a different computer and reentering my order. (I've been in the food and beverage industry for 6 years now) I feel that he had very good customer service. My order arrived quicker than estimated.. I'm eating it now, it's delicious. AND HOT. I don't know, everyone has different experiences, but I've never had a bad one. Whether I order for delivery or go in and grab one, every person I've dealt with has been friendly. 

Can we talk about this pizza tho....",kJB7nm1GuhTZuswaxCGMSQ,0,0,5,Qder5qCtxW9zWVnQGK0u8Q
