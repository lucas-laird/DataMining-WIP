Won't come here again! If you're going to be 24 hours be open 24 hours!",3TQ5BGkGc8imRhnC06KNFQ,0,0,1,_YSH16RgvEal3d7tQ26jMA

I am not a disgruntled employee, but I want to make aware to the public that the produce is not as fresh as you think it's usually 3-7 days old. They change the expiration date early in the morning to pro- long the product and to save a quick buck. The cookies are hard as a brick and the bread is as hard as a rubber boot and if it's soft it's undercooked. I once found a rotten piece of chicken that was in a batch and brought it to my managers attention and it completely went over her head, there was also a coworker (Virginia Flores) that would make herself a salad during her lunch, then when she was done she would wash it with water and put it back on the rest of the clean plates that's getting served. Other than food the manager (Araceli Mendoza) was very unprofessional, she had that ""if they don't know don't tell attitude,"" she couldn't train if her life depended on it and on top of that she said if we worked more than 8 hours we get a break!! One good thing I can about this location is the lobby and bathrooms stay clean 24/7, but I would definitely reconsider another location.",fFdWjC-9nvHz_Hq3HE5GsA,0,0,1,THZsnuYOSE6KbU-MsEMi_Q

I am thoroughly impressed with the speed of his response and the fact that I was apologized to. This manager seems to be someone who really cares about his restaurant. I will be re-posting after going back. Who knows, everyone has a bad day, maybe that was the issue.",r7NQ5zhrku8jc-PDGsQI7w,0,1,3,Bn7ZhYaLy23dItw9UdT4iA
