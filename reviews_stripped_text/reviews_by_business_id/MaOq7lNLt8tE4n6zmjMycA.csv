I'm shocked this place isn't more crowded in the AM, and for lunch.  Her cinnamon bear claw is delicious!  This place makes me want to throw rocks at S-bucks :)",tT35CXTczsgP7GjOEKTZkw,1,0,4,pmMXe8gFGQabsYYW0EY70g

Julie not only gives great customer service, she gives back to her community as well.
Thank you Julie :)",xSiqnq7BURWWAdPz7SDu3w,0,0,5,64e7BmMX4e69g5TztfpFQA

Owner Jullie pours her heart into every cup of java and freshly roasted beans from all over the world. If you are looking for a great cup of coffee then stop by Daybreak Coffee and try the special treats baked daily!,URgCSr30wj1Z7OedzPPiIQ,2,0,5,obkbz0B62fwzBhs5msUuxA
753418,2013-02-21,0,MaOq7lNLt8tE4n6zmjMycA,Enjoyed my visit to this cute little shop. Just ordered a smoothie and it was tasty. The owner was very sweet and friendly. I noticed that the sound really carried and it is such a small space.  There were only two other people there but it was very noisy. Overall a nice place and love to support small local businesses.,z1tGfRDgfhfkV8ehNLiJrQ,0,0,4,1oAYew0d3QsDeQXdSxX_yQ

They also have fresh- daily sandwiches, breakfast burritos and wonderful pasteries.Salads and soups are also on the menu, made by Chef Monet. Jullie roasts her coffee to order, and can make specialty blends for customers. A tea drinker? Jullie also carries specialty teas packaged for her by Little Candle Teas, a new Las Vegas tea company. So whatever you have a craving for, stop in and enjoy!!!!",nhJAAbel-sLlm40-3zYRSg,1,0,5,PMMBeT0tJSLgYxPH_8FEQg

The coffee is great, my favorite is the iced vanilla latte! I normally stop on my way to work and its not too busy! The ham, egg, and cheese bagel is always hot and fresh!

There are cute gift baskets and mugs you can buy, along with bags of coffee!! 
Julie is the owner and she is always very welcoming and helpful if you aren't sure what to get!!  I highly recommend making this your new coffee shop!",qLOroQUDFnHO8IPBUE5PwA,4,1,5,0B6-m83WKnQlT5-ayumhjw

Daybreak does have decent sandwiches and salads (albeit without much flair).

The proprietors seem earnest and I feel good about supporting them with my business.

Check out the Ham and Cheese on Texas Toast. It was very tasty and freshly made.

I would come here again.",m7PHRlijydOKOGhN6aXbtQ,1,0,3,PO-x8QjD6q7Lrz2_xvLQjw

We each got the ham and egg breakfast sandwiches and they were amazing!  My boyfriend kept saying 'the ingredients on the sandwich are in the perfect proportion!""  It was very delicious and the owner was very friendly!  My boyfriend was going to buy 2 waters, and she suggested to drink the filtered water that's fresh - for free!  I would go back in a heartbeat!",ZsEmVA6cNvInW9Hx6ZeEzA,1,0,5,OtCtkf4gBJxdUf5B-nGBpw
