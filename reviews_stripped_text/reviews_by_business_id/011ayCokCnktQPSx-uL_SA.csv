When I arrived to order my meal the man at the cash register didn't make eye contact with me when I said hello instead he rolled his eyes at me and said yes??! In my head I was like ok how rude... I ordered my meal and he seemed like he was annoyed when I was ordering my meal. After me and my husband got our meal the burgers were burnt, very messy, and had barley no sauce. I took the burger back to him and I stood infront of him with the burger in my hand staring at him and he ignored me for 2 minutes when there was no one in line. He then acknowledged me and said yes do you need something so I proceeded with the explanation that the burger was very well burnt and dry. He snatched it off my hands with an annoyed look and checked the burger to see if I lying. He threw it in the trash with anger and walked away. Didn't even tell me I'm sorry we will fix this right up for you just give us a second nothing he said nothing. Then the man in the back who was preparing the meals gave me a new one and guess what... it was worse then the worst one! ridicouls",jbkUJaG3wGWBdctKCJg8CA,0,0,1,hVJsyE38IMqpO2pyCSNBbw

I ordered a large fry and the lady gave it to me within 30 seconds. I tasted one, handed the bag back to the lady asking for fresh fries. She gave me a few mins later some ""fresh fries"" which were just as greasy and soft and oily as the first ones she gave me. The food quality is disturbing.",VDsnV9Xc-akVbJC0hVtAQw,1,1,1,pxbWMcg-eAJx-ZkuhzRCWg
3166548,2017-06-29,0,011ayCokCnktQPSx-uL_SA,So I treated myself to McDonalds today and ordered a sweet tea and some hash browns and pancakes and McDonald's treated me to a creature infested sweet tea.... I'm so appalled and intend to call everyone I possibly can about this because that is a joke I have been in and out of fast food since I was 15 years old and these were grown ass people working this location who obviously don't know a goddamn thing about sanitation.,lSmfCpGH61hiKujqms3WbA,0,0,1,uQ35RviXAjECsQ316g2q_g

I was in a hurry and me and the chillies (children) was starving so we hit up Mac Deez (McDonald's). I can't say I have had too many bad experience at Mac Deez but overall just wanna make better food choices for my health.

Any who, my wife sent me some coupons which made this experience even more sweet! I felt like this was a cheat meal... for all my health heads know what I mean rt rt...? So I thought the manager would give me a hard time for the coupons but he didn't! 

He was actually great he took all my coupons and was super customer serviced out (meaning he was on point). He took my order and had my food out asap. The kids got a 2 for 1 kids meal, cheeseburger no onions, and nuggets for the other. I got a special signature barbecue chicken sandwich on artisan bread and that was delicious! 

I really enjoyed my food and the kids did too! Shoutout to the manager who took our order, I'm still not a fan of Mac Deez but if I'm ever starved and low on duckets (money) I'll probably not think twice about sneaking in (in disguise)!",rTuxNHmaxiG-29uKgPRzZg,0,0,5,OWavn5e0P8TgqckmJGDc-g
