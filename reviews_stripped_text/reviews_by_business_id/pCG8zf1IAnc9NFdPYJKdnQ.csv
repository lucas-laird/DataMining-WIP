I love container park, you can sit outside and eat your hot dog, and it is a nice view of the central playground. Adults are allowed on the slide too haha.

One star off because the veggie dog gave me that extra heavy/groggy feeling. I know its a hot dog. But i thought since it was a veggie dog, i wouldnt feel that sluggish after eating it",DmS31Jk9fq7Msl5fNSLjkA,0,0,4,6bSxLX1__9PqmFXL0TMByg

The hot dog was decent and the price was not bad for also getting a beverage.

Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure the bun was not vegan. I don't have a photo of it because it was dark outside, but the bun was *bright yellow* -- and if you've been vegan for a while, you'll know it's important to stay away from yellow breads (hamburger buns, hot dog buns, dinner rolls, whatever). That usually means the bread contains egg. And this bad boy definitely had that eggy look.

CLASSIC CHEFFINIS: Grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. $6 for a gigantic dog overflowing with toppings that didn't sound like they'd work, but somehow harmonized. Didn't expect to like the pineapple sauce, but I did.

MOSHI MOSHI: Grilled frank, caramelized onions, seaweed, jalapeño, wine sauce, spicy mayo. I love a good Japanese dog, this one was simple. Asked for it sans jalapenos and received a rather sad-looking dog with very few onions, but flavor was good. $7 price tag seems appropriate for the area and toppings.

Now for the service. Walked in to one person in line waiting for a drink refill. Through the kitchen window we could see the cook hard at work, but the cashier was nowhere to be found for a solid five minutes and the cook never acknowledged anyone waiting as the line grew to five more people.

Located in Downtown Container Park, attached to the Black Cup Coffee shop. This tube steak eatery provides a different style of dog with available toppings like chorizo bits, pineapple sauce, chimichurri, crushed potato and chipotle guava. Now of course this isn't all on one dog, but a taste of the difference they offer. 

I ordered the ""Grandfather"" which is ridiculous. A grilled frank and pork belly, red bell peppers, caramelized onions, crushed potato chips, spicy mayo, basil aioli, pickle mango, topped with a fried quail egg. This was amazing, I loved the pork belly paired with a runny quail egg and the crunch from the potato chips was also nice touch. This was stacked with toppings and I do suggest trying to eat this classic way for at least for one bite, but then grab the fork and knife because it gets messy. 

The other dog I tried was the ""Classic Cheffinis"" with, onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. A classic dog, but on steroids, there's no way really to eat this with your hands, there's just too many toppings, but they all taste great together. I really enjoyed the Pineapple sauce with the jalapenos and the fresh tomatoes. 

The one thing I didn't enjoy was the mozzarella, I usually love mozzarella on everything, but the cheese was cold and not close to being ""melty"" which would have been much better. Cold cheese and hot food, not a great mix.

I've had Cheffinis bookmarked for quite a while and after walking by where it's supposed to be at about 11:30, I was pretty disappointed to see they were nowhere to be found. So, we decided to head over to Wayfarer and grab a drink. Luckily, he pulled the cart out not to long after that and we were down there faster than you can say ""hot dog"". Ok, maybe not, but we ran out of that bar quick haha.

Thanks to Mark for reading all the reviews beforehand, he knew to order one with everything underneath the dog itself. That's definitely the best way to go about it if you're ordering everything or a lot of toppings. It keeps everything from falling off the top and you can get nice balanced bite...from what I hear. For whatever reason, I got a super dry bun that crumbled and fell apart making me feed the ground anyway.

Now, I'm usually not a fan of boiled dogs and I believe that's what these are. The flavor is decent but it has that watery feel to it. They are pretty good size dogs though which is appreciated. Who likes a tiny dog in a giant bun?

The topping selection is pretty extensive with everything from the standard ketchup, mustard and onions to some unusual stuff like potato chips, mozzarella cheese and a pineapple sauce. With it loaded up, the flavor is surprisingly good. Even though mine was falling apart a bit, I was able to see how you can get spicy, sweet, salty and even crunchy all in one bite. 

Was it the best hot dog I've ever had? No, but I bet when you're about to pass out from hours of alcohol abuse, they taste amazing! I won't go out of my way to come back but next time I'm downtown, I'll definitely grab one and bring cash to save a $1 on the credit card fee!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,4,3,XDQJNUHjv1k_nem87JMxIw

The tastes I had were pretty decent ( if expensive ) so I won't give them one star. But the service was a total bust, hence the generous two stars.

There really isn't any steak n eggs or pho downtown so what to do the hipsters eat when they get out of Griffin? Hot dogs with chips on them.

Cheffinis is a small stand located across the street from Commonwealth... but I guess it can move around cause well it is on wheels after all. Its the defintion of small business: the owner (I think he is Cheffini) makes a hot dog while his wife/gf/sister/whoknows takes the cash and helps out. Its really cute, and hopefully not Incestious.  

Hot dogs are about 3 bux and they come with all kinds of toppings! You can get avocado, cheese, potato chips, and all sorts of random stuff on em. And it all tastes good! I am not a big hot dog fan or any penis shaped food but the toppings and novelty of the whole place make a stop by worth it!",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,6,2,4,rtcgVeIg5bZpH3a-EsSENQ

After placing my order I was told it would be just a few minutes. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for just 1 hot dog because 2 employees were making food for themselves first. 

El Mexicano ($6.99) - A bacon wrapped hot dog with avocado, tomato, onion, cherry pepper relish, green sauce, chipotle guava and garlic aioli. This hot dog just had way too much going on for me. Everything on it sounded good, but it didn't work all together. The bacon that was wrapped around the dog was very hard and dry. All I tasted once I was able to chew through the bacon was onions and plain mayo. Apparently sides of sauce are .25 cents each and after looking at my receipt I noticed that I was charged .50 cents for 2 sides of extra sauce. I didn't even ask for anything extra I just wanted the hot dog I ordered. Like the bacon, the bun was hard. My total with tax was $8.10 and that's too much for just one hot dog that didn't even taste good.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,38,33,1,Ssii4NaW7uCx6KTq_nzKzA

5349099,2015-06-18,3,pCG8zf1IAnc9NFdPYJKdnQ,"I would've never known about this little hot dog cart if my friend never told me about it. After a night of drinking, we got hungry, and she suggested this little hot dog stand. And guess what? We went to it. 

This little cart is located right in front of the Beat Coffee Shop, suite 520 on Fremont St. It turns out that the owner has been doing this for about 4 years now and even has his own brick n mortar in Container Park, which is located on 707 Fremont St. so don't get confused! This is the little cart on the street! He typically opens shop at around 11 pm I believe -- probably after the coffee shop is closed. 

His hot dogs are $4 with a variety of toppings that include: mozzarella cheese, ketchup, mustard, jalapenos, potato chips, pineapple sauce, mayo, and tomatoes!

Let me tell you, the flavors and the different textures were really amazing! Or maybe it's because we were hungry after drinking and the alcohol makes it even more delicious? Who knows! 

But definitely worth a try after drinking on Fremont St!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,5,5,5,3ssBxcswmvi1d5p-DEOn5w

I love that they have a meatless option. Probably the best veggie dog I've had in a long time. Service is ok too.,iHGsi2zgjGEm2zEQg8w0og,2,2,3,eQraPU_MZsEtX3dYYU8iOA

So I yelped hot dogs and  Cheffinis came up. It had great ratings so I thought ...lets give it a try. 
So glad we did!!
They are in Container Park which I love. The service was great. 
Hot dogs were yummy.  We each had the Naked dog with 2 completely different toppings.  I had  it with Mustard and cheese...dad...mustard and relish and mom cheese and bacon. 
I ordered an order of cheese fries for us to share.  Homemade cheese sauce and shredded cheese...YUMMY.  Great cheese sauce. 
It was perfect weather to sit outside and enjoy people watching. 
Great experience....will definitely be back!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,0,0,5,PKGixg2tyiXLhWXZmO3kQA

5516294,2017-08-19,0,pCG8zf1IAnc9NFdPYJKdnQ,"This place is the bomb! And for downtown has reasonable prices. My husband, daughter and I came to the downtown container park for a children's event and we got hungry and decided to try this place. They did not disappoint, my daughter had the plain hot dog which she devoured. My husband and I both got the burgers and fries. Delish! They even give you ""fry sauce"" which is equivalent to the sauce and in and out, but spicier. 
We also split a beer on top which was the perfect drink for a hot day. Def will be back. I did take off a star bc seating and space is pretty limited.",Zm2rOksCSgNK_o0U1Vt-qQ,0,0,4,zs0DQ3jUASqA8cKV6iEblA
5542544,2014-09-15,3,pCG8zf1IAnc9NFdPYJKdnQ,"So you will have to bear with me on this one. I tried Cheffinis around 2am after having quite a few adult beverages ;). So my taste and my memory may have been a bit altered. 

When I got up to the hotdog stand I had no idea they had all these different options! I just asked for one with everything, the guy working the stand was super fast and super nice considering he had to deal with theses tipsy girls asking him a bunch of silly questions. I have no idea what all was on my hotdog, I think some potato chips, the pineapple sauce and an array of different toppings. My taste buds were pleasantly surprised! I was not expecting all that. And as an extra bonus he took credit cards yay!!! 
Ill definitely have to try this stand again when I am in a better state of mind, so I can really appreciate it.",xBMH3N0Fbua5pDtG1Y1mYQ,0,0,4,4mZNwJidQHiH5zrRdZ519g

BRILLIANT  business model--working 11pm-3am selling quality weiners to drunks.   like the $1 beverages.  $3 for such dogs is more than reasonable.   interesting tasty buns the like i've never had before.  good meat.  nice staff.   i went 2 nites in a row & got 2 dogs each visit & used the newspaper machine as a tabletop.   i wondered what the tasty crunchy topping was; potato chip bits !,P9tsVSYF79fwRvMEjtTvWg,1,1,4,v6cYKPpz_25eV9dYFdZ7yw
