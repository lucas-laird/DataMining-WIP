The meat dishes weren't too bad, like chicken basil, except they were very oily.
My biggest problem with this restaurant was the overall cleanliness of the place (poor).  It really felt almost dangerous to eat there.  Fortunately, fried or stir-fried food is pretty safe in almost any locale, so none of us got sick or anything.
There are many better Thai and Vietnamese places to choose from around Las Vegas, so I don't recommend this one.",hvbj_NW7sEEmLqmc_WCybw,0,0,2,p9HtV6tIHTKqBW7VcrfPaw

I tried the chicken larb and it tasted different than the larb I've had at other Thai restaurants. It was very crunchy, like there was dried onion (or galangal) mixed in with the chicken. I'm not sure if crunchy larb is another version served by some Thai chefs, but it was unexpected. Nonetheless, the larb didn't have much flavor so the crunchiness might have been the only good thing about it.

We tried the Vietnamese rice dishes and pho. These also did not taste remotely like anything they're supposed to. The pho broth was very sweet (not flavorful, just sugary sweet), and the spices were not familiar. These entrees weren't bad, just not very authentic at all. If you want authentic Vietnamese, you'd be better off eating elsewhere.",5jgGp15H_0GRS_daM2AC7A,1,2,3,69d1NCxnagWXKAkPpCG0Xw

The basil wasn't as fresh as I've had but I will write it off as an off day and will report next time on this when I go back. The variety of pho is the most out of the three restaurants except for maybe the other place where you can custom make your pho. The broth was mild in flavor but I wonder if it's because I got the seafood instead of a meat selection. My pho did come with thinly sliced onions which added to the flavor. The dining area is small but clean and is my second favorite regarding decor.

The rice wasn't actually Thai Fried Rice and was rather bland. I always order Thai Fried Rice at Thai restaurants because this style is my favorite. So when the dish came out with no tomatoes, it was a surprise, especially since the menu describes it with tomatoes (as is standard). Instead, it contains carrots, corn, and green beans. WTF is this? When I asked why the difference from what the menu describes, I was told that they removed the tomatoes ""a long time ago"" because customers didn't like it ""so fishy"" ... uh, what? When have tomatoes ever been fishy? And green beans? Corn?

I live less than 5 minutes from Lilly's and decided to give it a shot when a random jones for Pho Ga hit one night. I've eaten at some A-list Vietnamese places in San Fran and the East Bay area when I go to visit family there, places so legit you won't hear a word of English when you go there. Lilly's wasn't far off the mark - delish white meat chicken with bean sprouts and noodles, not too salty. The pot stickers and spring rolls were good, but the summer rolls were a level up on the intensity. Massive portion, hint of cilantro, perfect with peanut sauce. The bun ga nuong cha gio was excellent, something new for me, tasty and unique. Large thai ice tea that was better than most, the thai spice was spot on, sweet but not over the top like some can be. It was pretty quiet when I stopped by later at night, there was only one person eating in. The kid at the counter was friendly and we chatted for a minute. I'm looking forward to trying the Thai food to see if it measures up also. Very solid as far as Vegas goes, I will definitely be keeping this place in my back pocket. It was tough to find for a second as there are a couple rows of strip malls packed in behind Vons and the new Anytime Fitness that just opened. Lilly's is 2 doors down from Madhouse Coffee on one side and next to a dry cleaner's on the other. Definitely worth a look.",_kQkkZUKOmJBD6t0CA-eHQ,0,0,5,p0SOq2k1ep-Uwnezp7FKLQ

Pho Tai: broth was okay but wtf happened to the noodles? When I poured the soup into the noodles they didn't separate. So I started to stir it around and then the noodles starting breaking and it became blocks of noodles. 

Tom yum: I asked for it to be hot and I swear it was less than mild. It wasn't even sour so it tasted like watered down tom yum. Plus I thought it was weird they used cherry tomatoes.

Spring rolls: $6 for two spring rolls and you're only going to put one shrimp split in half in each spring roll? Then stuff the rest with lettuce and noodles? I feel like they just robbed my money after I ate that.

I ordered fried calamari. Most other places I get fried calamari, it comes squishy and gooey. Not Lillies! The calamari was super light and fluffy with a nice crunch. Also the size of the pieces were pretty big and the sauce that came with it was amazing.
I also got the green chicken curry and got it spicy medium. The flavor was great and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. Also the chicken was amazing and juicy. 
My friend got the combination pho. It was kinda mediocre. The flavor of the broth was there but the consistency was thin and it was really oily. The noodles were already kinda hard which is an easy fix but still we had just got it so it should've been like that yet.

The restaurant is a small space in a strip mall in the Von's plaza on DI.  I was told I could sit wherever I wanted, and I was brought water and the Thai iced coffee I ordered for this hot day.

Looking over the menu, I stopped when I came to the duck selections.  It was simply a matter of choosing which one.  I opted for the Ka pao duck which is boneless, roasted duck topped with a spicy basil sauce.  I was asked how spicy I wanted my dish.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I chose 7.  The server questioned whether I liked spicy foods and told me that they use fresh Thai spices.  I stuck with the 7.

After a reasonable amount of time, my dinner was brought and it smelled really good.  That matched the way it tasted too.  I would get a spice level of 8 another time but the 7 was good.

I was asked if I wanted chopsticks or silverware.  I opted for silverware because I don't eat Thai food with chopsticks.

Service was good.  I need to return to try some Vietnamese food they have and see how it stacks up against other Vietnamese palces.  There are also a number of duck dishes to get too.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,5,3,HohCF3-m5oOWpuQIjxsYuw

The quality of the meat and the amount of the meat were lacking. This place is uninspiring and lousy. I would rather go to any other place for pho. On a good note, the service was good. SIDE STREET CAFE ACROSS THE STREET IS 100000000 TIMES BETTER, AND THEIR PHO IS ONE OF THE BEST!",ScwVhHmUFLZwVW9E5fvKjw,0,0,1,fN0LQPtmalb1rb7rN9pPmA

Maybe it's my fault as I didn't order a Thai dish but with so many Vietnamese dishes on the menu I thought it must be one of their specialties. The rice noodles were fine, prepared well, the fish sauce is fish sauce (I think they all buy the same one) but the charbroiled pork wasn't very good (thick chunks that were not tender or charbroiled looking) and the eggrolls were disappointing. If you like this dish got to Kim Long on Spring Mountain, it's wonderful. I may try Lilly's again but if I do I'll order something Thai.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,0,2,kE_imI1E7e4hJ5pSrP6L5Q

They have a lovely dining area. Open floor plan. Average four ppl per table. 

Offer lunch specials, great variety too. Most locations limit what they offer. These lunch specials are great. 

The portion is a nice size. About half the plate and and egg roll. I nice size plate not a little one. Lol. 

Easy to find as well. Definitely want to come try the duck dishes. Smell so good.",dfoCSad8XDZmufEI2MnfKQ,0,0,5,lrl9rIuIeB8qlTjiy7zwbA

This surprised us because the spring rolls were the best we have had since leaving Chicago.  We used to live a block from a Vietnamese business district and were introduced to spring rolls there.

The green curry was hot and spicy enough with a 6 rating.  My wife also had a vermicelli noodle dish and it was delicious.

Service was personable and the restaurant was very clean.  Great job!",ucBhntEp4LYdFOExHdvhZg,1,0,5,oFKaxgUAPov7PaWVw8-0tA
