I would highly recommend this place to anyone that has a taste for more authentic Mexican food.,2oc5vhbsxgA9g3jzllSOLA,1,0,5,KVDcz0BMXRCb179fbluJ5Q

There's nothing that goes together better for me like peanut butter and jelly than seafood and mariachi, so I had to really try this place.
We started with a dozen of raw oysters, fresh, juicy and intensively delicious, we also ordered the mariscada, a platter with a generous amount of seafood items to share and also the botana mixta equally served generously and they where both out of this land! 
Buckets of beer are half price from Monday through Thursday  and shrimp cocktails 2 for one during those same days. All I had to say was "" thank God Is Monday!"" 
Mariachi was a no show but that didn't stop us from listening to some corridos from the never tiring juke box, I believe mariachi is only on weekends as most places are but 12.00 corona buckets and a music machine was enough merryachi for me.
Service Is great  place is clean and prices are awesome.
Ok there's something else that goes better together......gin and tonic, but for the morning after hangover I got you on my list Mariscos el mariachi.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,3,4,5,tPi1JHp2rmJ8RPCbxCKmXQ

2800721,2014-05-22,8,VR2LTEsJByan97fcYRkl5w,"Ok so last Sunday I called around 8 to ask what time they closed. They told me they close at 9, I asked them ""if I get there a couple minutes before 9 can we still get served? We are coming from very far away and we really like the food that's why we travel so far"" the lady on the phone, one of the waitresses asked me what I would be ordering and I told her, she said ok that's fine we will see you here. I arrived there at 8:55 pm, before 9 obviously, I tried to open the door and in was locked, at first I thought I was just not pulling hard enough so I kept pulling then I realized it was closed. I had my daughter in my arms she's only 14 months, and the wind was crazy, I grabbed my phone and I called them, yes I am still standing in front of the door, the employees are staring at me as well as the owner and I tell them "" hey I called earlier and I was told if I came before 9 you'll still serve me, I even already told the lady what we wanted"" she said oh no we're already closed. "" but i cálled and i was told it was ok"" she then told me ""the owner( la señora) said were already closed and she clicked on me. While I'm standing right outside the door. No hey I'm sorry we're closed already, they literally just ignored a client that drove more than 30 min to get there. The owner of this place is a joke, I can  assure you this business won't succeed. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. If you don't treat your customers with respect, they won't come back! And you can be sure no one from my 55 + members in my family will be coming here anymore, and I will make sure to tell everyone I know of the terrible owner and staff!

I read a comment below where it said a lady like that served them and my god she has been the rudest server I've ever encountered she said they don't serve horchata and then suggested that if we wanted to leave we could go and it wouldn't be a problem? What kind of service is this? She's definitely a relative to management or is management. There is no way she can get away with such rudeness. She was also rude to another couple who asked for something to go and they repeated themselves and she replied ""yes I heard you the first time"" she has no customer service skills. The food looks better than it tastes and after our first encounter she was rude to me the entire time. she purposely made my dining experience",DFPtT2ogFd7PNm8ZlTh2bg,2,0,1,aaCs069DuM63QMMp4ZkW7g

I wasn't expecting high quality mariscos like in Mexico but If you want close to that I would go to Bajamar seafood and tacos was close to it and the food was better quality and a lot cleaner, So please be aware of this place, I don't want anybody else to get sick!

4088576,2017-03-26,1,VR2LTEsJByan97fcYRkl5w,This food sucks and so does the service. The lady with the high bun and dark makeup was extremely rude to me. I asked for a torta ahogada with no meat to replace with beans and potatoes and she said we can't make that you have to get it with meat?? I've never heard of a place say such a thing. Then she was being impatient and said just call me when you're actually ready. So this is why I will never be back here. The food is not worth the price it is (overpriced) so if you're looking for quality Mexican food for the same price and better service head to London Michoacán. Also this place is really old and dirty.,j8Dts8irvVBwEhEEae_-wA,1,0,1,Gu4yaoJQ5vb8kmqx6Wb4Aw

4578843,2017-11-05,0,VR2LTEsJByan97fcYRkl5w,So we were seated and the waitress took about 10 minutes to come ask for drinks. Then to bring us chips and salsa another 10 minutes. The food? You probably guessed it right 20 minutes after they brought us chips and salsa. My torta tasted bland and tasted like nothing. Jack in the box would have been alot tastier. I seriously will never come back.  You are better off going down the street to La Choza much faster service and food is alot better.,vJMR1DAhyypXpGNgSoj3ng,0,0,1,AbQ5VgAkWVW-HBjRIDeuzQ

There were like 3-4 people outside the door like waiting, so I waited as I kept looking inside for like about 5-10min. I then decided to leave then after looking and looking for another place I come back at about 9..This time there was noone waiting outside the door so I stand inside, right by the door when a young waitress comes up to me and says..there's no place to sit right now, but wait a minute someone might leave soon! I waited about 3 minutes when another young waiter comes and tells me, ""Hey, the house is full!"" So, I was in shock!!! So I whispered in his ear, ""Hey, I came earlier and left and now you're telling me to leave?"" Thanks, never again! Very bad customer service! Very rude, to say the least. I don't recommend this place. I recognized from the last time I had been there a few years back, like 3-4 of them? I think this place takes preference over some regulars and treats everyone else like shit! They don't care. Also I heard from friends of mine that took me there the first time, that they open their Karaoke time with my voice singing Amor Eterno too? Crazy, and definitely not good at all.
