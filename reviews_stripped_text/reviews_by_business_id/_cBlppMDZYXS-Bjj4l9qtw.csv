Oh and last time I check atol de elote is supposed to be thick and not soup in a cup.,y0Et2mb7Ngn-LHXts8b0JQ,1,0,1,uLJ9zeRluWbCZ7YYSDnWzQ

Bad experience, the tamales where not Guatemalan, no flavor at all and the pupusas where also not good, and the size of a quarter, very small, not good at all,.
     I,m not going back!!  The prices are very high!!",k80uQeP1m0DMefD_ZI7aXQ,2,0,1,xrRI8OVrmUavrZ1cMqDaaw

I just happen to see this place during our marine corps ball visit. What caught my eye was that it said that it had a mexican, guatemalan,  salvadoran menu.
 I had the mariscos soup and pupusas with Atole de elote to drink. It all taste like I was at home in my Abuelas house in El Salvador or in Guatemala. Friendly staff. They are slow but not their fault. This isn't fast food. 
Also my favorite handmade tortillas Central American style. You can't complain about that. It's a must try!!",K9iQTuH_mS7G5JRCtM5yPg,1,0,4,sltgD6uNnF-M9PccOK_OkQ
