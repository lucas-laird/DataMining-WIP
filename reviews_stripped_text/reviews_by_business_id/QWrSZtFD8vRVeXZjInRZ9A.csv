However, me being the picky Italian that I am, have noticed that this place is really, really inconsistent when it comes to their food, and I'm getting sick of it.  There are times that I go when the pizza is good (i.e., the toppings taste good, the pizza is thin and crunchy), but there are other times when I go and the pizza is terrible (the crust is way too thick, the toppings seem undercooked, and the pizza is just bland).  I feel like the pizza I get depends on the day I go, and it's a crap shoot every time I go there.  I've concluded that either the pizza maker is schizophrenic or he just doesn't know what the hell he's doing.  

Oh, circa 1995-2000 Villa Pizza.  How I miss thee.  I don't know what's up with these franchises, but they just aren't working for me.",XEiocbijRm1YLbZJwvAlQw,0,0,2,u-q7yM_d5oy88VN_1_yzdA

They had the absolute worst, tiny dried out things they pass off as fingers, waaaay over cooked (and I've tried this place more then once, always the same) Horrible bland pizza and not to mentioned waaay over priced. Over $7 for an order of crappy fingers. I called and talked to the manager, he said he'd make it right for me the next time I was in there, gave them my name, etc. So I go in a few weeks later and guess what? He had no idea what I was talking about, said he never said such a thing....That was over 2 years ago and I've not been back since and they will NEVER get a dime from me again",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,1,0,1,exRyJXd2HyUK7-96yUhb5A

They apparently do not like honoring the coupons they mail out -- seriously, if you treat your customers like criminals when all they're trying to do is redeem the things you mail out en masse, you're not going to be around long.

We usually get Villa from the store on Durango, but we were on the other side of town visiting friends and this was the closest one.

After this fiasco, we decided to head over to Rocco's instead -- Villa will not get anymore of our business.",qq_5_DPHNHgBjN7-A_rInQ,0,0,1,FSnOc4DlJsTwydDoQuS_iw

The service is always fast and friendly. I have ordered the chicken wings, pizza, garlic knots, garlic fries and the salad. I can honestly say that it has always been above average. The garlic knots are my kids favorite. I personally LOVE the wings because they are always crispy and fresh. We often order the wing and pizza special to take to a friends house for potlucks. The ranch dressing here is amazing... we like to order extra because it seems to disappear quickly.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,3,4,RRpJJFqsjUnFmYL1w7JEKA
