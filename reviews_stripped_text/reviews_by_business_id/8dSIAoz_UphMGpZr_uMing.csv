That being said, I am not likely to return. A few weeks back my husband and I stopped in to grab some food. We were 2 out of probably 10 people in the restaurant. No waitress of bartender to be seen anywhere. Waited for a good 15 minutes before I got up, went to the pizza pickup window and waiting another 5 minutes to even see anyone because they were all in the back and couldn't see me. Totally ridiculous considering there were 8 other people in the restaurant eating and drinking. Strike 1-

I call them to order delivery (as I'm only a few blocks away and have done this before) and they tell me it's weird my zip code says 8 miles away when my cross streets are right down the street. Instead of delivering anyway (as they can tell my cross streets are so close) they dismiss me since their gps is malfunctioning and tell me to come pick it up instead. Completely bizarre and what I consider awful customer service. Strike 2-

1012913,2016-03-12,0,8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing,"COUPON USERS BEWARE...We went in for dinner tonight after receiving a coupon in the Valpak mailer earlier this week.  Coupon stated ""Happy Hour Special, 4pm-6pm Weekdays, 50% off Pizza, Dine-in only.""  We ordered our food (x-large veggie and 2 very diluted iced teas & 1 lemonade) ate, then the server brings us our check w/out the discount.  I inquire about the happy hour pizza special and she says that it only applies for weekdays Mon-Thurs, so I break out w/ the Valpak mailer which states nothing of the Mon-Thurs and then she changes her response to, ""oh that was an old coupon that they are no longer honoring.""  So I ask to speak w/ the manager or owner and she says they are not onsite today, but after repeating myself she changes her response and tells me the manager is in the back.  She comes back out and tells me the manager is busy at the oven and that she wouldn't be able to honor the happy hour special but would be able to give me $5 off.  At that point I'm beyond frustrated and demand to speak w/ the manager in person otherwise the police would be called.  I'm sorry I know this may be a little extreme but I refuse to let some fraudsters rip me off, no matter how insignificant the discount is, so I stood my ground.  The manager ends up coming out and then proceeds to blame Valpak advertising, stating she did not know why they were still printing the coupons since they were no longer honoring them.  I tell her that was not fair to their customers as that is false advertising and they could get sued & her exact words to me, ""I'll take my chances."" She finally relents, begrudgingly and honors the 50% off happy hour special as advertised in the March 2016 Valpak mailers.  Perhaps I should've known this was going to be a bad night as we waited about 5-10 mins when we first came in before we were even greeted as there were no employees in the front, dining area or even at the bar.

Looks like we will be finding another pizza join in the future to value customer experience.

2711746,2014-02-06,0,8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing,"I really wanted to give a 5 star review because the food is so good, but the staff, consistency and cleanliness has much to be desired.

First the staff.  I normally call in to do pickup orders, so when I come in the ""pick up side"" there is usually no one at the counter.  I think there is a door buzzer, but it's next to the door, not in the kitchen where everybody apparently is, so when I come in I usually just stand there until someone happens to wander up front.  What's worse is sometimes there a waitress walking back and forth from the dining room and she of course can see me at the counter because we make eye contact, but again, nothing.  I don't even think she mentioned I was out there. On another occasion I ordered a SMALL deep dish pizza and when I came to pick it up the girl at the counter pulled out a large pizza box.  I said ""I ordered a small"" she said ""this is how they come, the order is right.  Like a dummy I believed her because I didn't want to be rude and open it in front of her, not to mention if it was right she would probably have another remark for me.  So of course I got home and it was totally wrong, a large thin crust pizza. However the manager did call me back to warn me I left my pizza there. I left my pizza there?  You gave me the wrong one!  I hate checking the food before I leave.  I'm not sure why that is put on me, they should be getting the order correct.

Next is just a small complaint, but they advertise the Chicago Bears (being a Chicago based food establishment), they even hand out Bears refrigerator magnets with all the dates of the Bears games.  There was even a sign that advertised ""come watch the Bears games here"".  However when I came one Sunday, the girl in the dining room said ""we only get the televised games"".  What a disappointment. So I just went to a sports bar down the street that had the game televised. If you are going to broadcast the Chicago Bears and their games, maybe invest in a Sunday Ticket with Direct TV so the Bears fans have a place to go.

Consistency.  Not too big of a deal, but every-time I order the Italian Beef Sandwich, its random if I will get hot gardenia, on the sandwich or on the side. Or if I will get Aj Jus at all. Also it doesn't feel like the staff is well versed on Chicago foods like Italian beef, when I asked for it ""dipped"" I sometimes have to explain that is when you dipped the entire sandwich in the Aj Jus. This also worries me that they might not have the right utensils to properly ""dip"" a sandwich. Which leads me to the 3rd issue:

Cleanliness... There's no excuse for this, and I've had some pretty gross issues.  Again, back to the Italian Beef. I brought the food home and started eating the sandwich about halfway through I end up pulling a 12 inch piece of hair out of my mouth. Probably the grossest thing to ever happened to me food wise. That is until the NEXT weekend I thought I would give it another chance. Again I brought the food home and halfway through the sandwich I pull a strand of stainless steel wool cleaning pad from my mouth! Now we are not talking just gross human hair, but potentially dangerous foreign OBJECTS in the food. It's almost like the Aj Jus sauce bin is used as a trash can.  I have yet to try the beef sandwich again. The thought of what is going on back there to allow steel wool and human hair in beef broth is beyond gross.  My assumption is the staff doesn't care (which I mentioned before).  The must be no pride taken with cleanliness. 

Here is the actual sad part, the food is excellent tasting! Well, that is before the mental stigma of gross objects being in the food happens. It bothers me because the is the closest thing to ""Chicago food"" within a few miles of my house.  I'm not saying this to be mean to Rosati's, I really want them to address these issues so I can come back. I just think they need to get the staff involved or get a staff that cares. Other than that this place has a lot of potential.",gij38wU44AZtOq8AXSeKaQ,3,0,2,V_GW4H0CJtRsgsdgp93idg

The thinner crust which I thought was traditional because she explained over the phone has always been good and the pizza was pretty good to me in the past! We also ordered chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks forgot the Mariana sauce and fingers were over cooked. But not too bad. I was the most annoyed with the antipasto salad, horrible! Never had one that had pieces of parmesan cheese and the other cheese was the same cheese they top the pizza with. No rolled up meat and cheese just horrible pepperoni and maybe the smallest amount of ham you can imagine. I took a picture below I ate from it but I did not eat any ham or pepperoni being that I don't even like the two, the ham isn't the kind I prefer!

2911372,2015-01-26,8,8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing,"I had Rosati's once about 2 years ago when I lived in a different area of town. Honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. I was going to wait to try it a second time before reviewing it, but that just never happened. 

Well, since moving to a different neighborhood, I noticed there was a Rosati's less than a mile from where I type this. It took a minute, but tonight I finally got to give them a second chance.

    ....and I am really glad I did!

Located on the northeast corner of Windmill and Rainbow, you will spot Rosati's Pizza Pub in the Smith's shopping center. It is much easier to find off of Windmill Road just east of the Smith's gas station.

I haven't had a chance to enjoy the actual pub its self since we just grabbed our pie to go tonight. That will just have to wait for an updated review.  

That pie however was tasty as hell! Two things that stood out for me were the crust and the sauce. The crust wasn't too thin (which I can't stand) or too doughy  but nice and crispy! Just right! The sauce was lightly seasoned and had a unique taste in it's own right. 

The employees were all very friendly and engaging and were fun to chat with as well. Definitely no complaints as far as service goes!

The only reasons I can't give it 5 stars is...

- it is a bit on the pricey side. $20 for a pizza isn't the most I've paid for a pie but it certainly isn't the cheapest either! Sometimes you have to pay for quality I guess..

- I am not a big fan of the square slices. Not a huge deal but I definitely prefer the traditional slices..

I live so close to Rosati's and love the taste of their pizza so it is almost a guaranteed certainty I'll be back. After all I still have to try their garlic knots, wings, and have a brew in their Pub!

If all Rosati's made was deep dish Chicago Style pizza, I would give it 5 stars, and I don't usually give anyone 5 stars. The reason is because people on yelp 5 star places all the time, and you get ratings that are not accurate.

I love the deep dish. The pastry like crust,  savory sauce, high quality cheese and toppings are what I call lasagna on bread. It's a beautiful product and what I think is worthy of being with the top pizza's I've ever tried. 

So why the 3 stars? 

I have tried the double dough and the thin and crispy and they are not even in the same league as a wal-mart or sam's club take and bake pizza. 

SO DISSAPOINTING! 

I ordered a veggie doubledough on one occasion and it was tasteless, soft and watery from all the veggies. I don't remember what I paid because I also had a deep dish with it and that made me forget all about the money I wasted on the DD.

Whats with the square cut on a round pizza? Can someone comment as to why they would cut a pizza that way? You get all these weird pieces that don't have any toppings on them. Weird......

Today I ordered their monster pizza thin and crispy XL size (18'') I asked for the wedge cut because the square cut really annoyed me, and took away from the quality of the product. This is like a supreme pizza with meat and veggies.

It looked good, but that's as far as it went. I ate one piece and was so disappointed I threw it away. The crust wasn't bad. crispy yes, but not enough salt in the dough. Kind of like a breadstick. 

It had evidence of cornmeal which is a requirement for that style pizza. 

Thin watery tart sauce, I could not taste one topping from the other. it was literally tasteless. 

The sad part about this is I paid about $33 for this failure.

I have no problem paying 40 bucks for their large deep dish because it has proven itself every time I've ordered it. 

I have also tried the lasagna and their antipasti salad both of which were not really anything worth trying again.

The pizza is so humongous that I can only eat 1 slice.  Your pie is piled high with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, ground beef, mushroom, onion, green pepper, green and black olives.  I swear, eating 1 slice of this pizza is comparable to having half a large pizza at one of your big box pizza chains.  And this tastes much better!! 

As you eat your slice, toppings are piled so high that they will eventually fall off.  But there is so much that you won't even miss them.  Half of your pizza toppings could fall off and you wouldn't miss a beat.  There is just that much topping!!!  I do, however, recommend using a fork and knife.  It is much too daunting of a task to grab and eat a slice by hand.  

The dough is thick with a nice chew to it.  The bottom and crust is nice and crispy.  I find myself ripping off the crust and loading it with my ""man overboard"" toppings.  No topping left behind is what I say.  

You can debate over what is and isn't an authentic Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is.  What I can tell you without a doubt is this.  The Deep Dish from Rosati's is truly a deep dish pizza.  Toppings are piled high, the 18"" Monster has to be over 10lbs.  First thing you'll say when you lift the box is, whoa this is heavy!!  And above all, this is a supremely delicious pizza that you will thoroughly enjoy.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,4,1,5,8ZoCfleI-vGwh_aMALWGIQ

We have ordered from them 3 times now and have not been disappointed. We tried the deep dish and it's very good, crust not quite as buttery and flaky like back home but a solid effort. The Italian beef sandwich is very tasty too, love the hot giardinara on it. The au jus is a tad too salty for me but this sandwich satisfies my beef cravings quite nicely. My favorite is the thin crust. Tasted just like what we used to eat back home. Crispy, cut into squares. Like a thin crust should be and slathered with an amazing tomato and topped with the freshest. Toppings and gooey cheese. Was pleased to see they use real Italian sausage and not pork breakfasty tasting stuff other pizza joints try to pass off as sausage. 

Rosatti's has made me a believer and I have them on speed dial. :)",W_HwGW3zoda31p1FmlcgbA,7,4,5,DA0W8n9_HoySRXbUbzGNnw

3652369,2015-09-01,1,8dSIAoz_UphMGpZr_uMing,"So it's only my second stop on my quest for the best Chicago deep dish in Vegas and I think I'm ready to call it. 

Don't worry though, I'm gonna keep on looking because I love pizza and trying new places and writing about them.

Back to Rosatis...

This place is decorated very nice inside, really clean design with a brick wall for the bar. It's very well maintained and when we visited, it was pretty immaculate inside, with a very inviting fresh pizza smell.

There's plenty of comfortable seating, booths and high tables. It's not too tight in there at all, lots of room to get around, even when it's busy.  There's several TV screens, even a projector on the back wall. The game day deals make it an ideal place to watch sports if that's your thing.

I wasn't impressed with the beer selection. They had the usual suspects, along with blue moon and Stella. Kind of a disappointing selection, but that's okay.

We decided to order a few appetizers even though we knew we'd have plenty of pizza.  We got the cheese fries, and despite them being just boxed crinkle-cut fries covered in mozzarella, we rather enjoyed them.

We took the advice of so many Yelpers and got the garlic knots as well. These were an interesting and delicious take on the common breadstick. Warm, fluffy, covered lightly with butter and fresh minced garlic. With a side of marinara and ranch these apps went down easy.

We got the extra large Chicago style pepperoni deep dish pizza, thinking we'd have it again later in the week.  What a mistake. The pizza was beyond massive. My wife and my sister-in-law barely ate one slice. I'm a pretty big guy, and I eat a lot bigger than I seem like I would, but I struggled to get through my second slice. At the time of this review, there are still two King Kong slices in my fridge.

Not because the pizza wasn't delicious, it was.  It was served screaming hot, with plenty of bubbly mozzarella and pepperoni. When you remove a slice, the pan is bathed in melted cheese, which is always a sign of things being done right somewhere along the line. Rosatis strikes an awesome balance of thickness and toppings. There's a ton of toppings but they hold back just shy of making you feel like a jerk for finishing a whole slice, and I appreciate that. There's lots of cheese, but not so much that you question what you're doing with your life by eating there. The crust is deep, but not too thick. There's a certain thickness that lets you know you're dealing with a serious slice, but you know you're not getting a giant bready brick beneath your glorious toppings. There's a science to figuring out the proper ratio of crust to toppings in deep dish pizza-making, and I believe Rosatis has mastered it.

The crust itself is wonderfully flaky, not too hard, not too thick. Has a subtle buttery taste but it's not overpowering like other places I've tried in town, and I can tell the guys in the back know just when to take the pie out of the oven because it was perfect and golden all the way around.

There's a huge menu at this place: other styles of pizza, calzones, sandwiches. If I can somehow not order Chicago pizza when I come here, I think I'd definitely like to explore what else they have to offer.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,2,1,5,MnbFxWzl8kkI6U6cPKyi4Q

My son told me the chicken was really good, but fries were lacking in flavor. The fries were hot, and not soggy though. The total for all of the above was $51.00, and hubby picked up. I think they should include fries with the chicken, but the side was a very good size. The girl who took our order was friendly and knowledgeable.

The pizza was not up to par with the other location less sauce n not as tasty, I guess each franchise location is different. 

Warning if your diabetic don't drink the diet soda here.  I got home from the place and checked my blood sugar it was well over 1100 which 80-90 my normal range is regular.  1100 is ridiculous one can slip into a coma if not careful.  I was furious had to shoot up over 30 units of insulin to bring it down to 150.  When I called to tell the lady at the place who when I was leaving said to me thanks for coming see you next time.  She told me hold on let me go check and  then she hung up on me.  Real nice customer service. I would not recommend this place and not return after the rudeness of my phone call.

I asked that question ( not using those terms ) of the counter chic and she said that my pizza was probably with the delivery guy. This made me smile as I imagined the dude who ordered the double cheese and pepperoni with sausage getting my ricotta cheese, spinach and mushroom pie.

The pizza can range from very good to not cooked/too thick crust/sparse toppings. I once ordered a salad with grilled chicken and there was a bug in the salad.  

The pizza and food is pretty pricy compared to other places, not valued enough for the hit or miss service they supply. 
I've also ordered from the Rainbow location and the Summerlin location, both times service was nice and friendly, pizzas were hot and loaded with toppings.

9:05pm: We ordered a veggie pizza godfather style with the garlic bread. Tina who took the order, did not confirm the order. I asked for a veggie pizza... paused and said godfather and garlic bread. The whole time she was rushing the order and had a tone with me because I was trying to figure out the order. I give it to her, they were closing in an hour at 10:00pm. 

9:52 pm: When the order was delivered, I took a bite of the pizza and it was a beef pizza with jalapeños. I  called back and said we just received the order. Tina went ahead and cut me off and said ""he should be there any minute"" I said ""no I'm actually calling because the pizza is not veggie. "" she said that the ""godfather"" was what I ordered. I said no I ordered a veggie godfather style. 

Boyfriend took the phone and said that he is from Chicago and that the godfather is actually a style of pizza. He told her he did not want to argue with her. She proceeded on telling him to bring back the pizza. (When we brought the pizza back they even opened it to see if it was intact). 

He drove there and asked to speak to management. She threw the business card and said he can call
Mark tomorrow and to wait for the pizza.  She kept saying
how I messed up the order. But he let her know if she heard me say veggie pizza and godfather then shouldn't we have two pizzas? She did not say a word. He kept telling her that he was not receiving good customer service.  

While the pizza was being made, boyfriend heard the men giggle in the back and heard them say ""spit."" 

He asked Tina if they were going to spit on the food. She said they would never do that. He then said ok well give me the pizza and I'll get it tested for bodily fluids. She then went back to check with the staff if they did that. Customers were watching and were telling her and boyfriend to calm down it's the holidays. 

Some dude came from the back and told boyfriend to calm down.  

Long story short, my boyfriend has been coming here for three years and loves the pizza but it looks like it is under new management. 

We won't be coming back.

We recently moved here from CA and ordered pizza for some people helping us move.  I didn't realize it at first but this is a chain and we had one a couple miles from our house in CA which we had been to a coupld of times.  

The delivery person had made an error and did not bring the garlic knots, so I called them and let them know about it.  Without hesitation or offering to give them to us next time we came in or something they made a special trip out.  Delivery is usually faster than they quote too.

The pizza here is good and reasonably priced for Chicago pizza places I have been to.  The deep dish is good but very heavy (duh) and the thin crust has a cornmeal feel to it with some good flake also but not crispy.

It's extremely frustrating as a vegetarian that I can't order food and be relatively certain I can eat what I get if they make a mistake.

The fettuccine itself was delicious, though small for the $13.95 price tag. The slice of garlic bread was soggy from being in the box with the hot pasta but tasted fine after I popped it in the toaster oven for five minutes.

It came with a huge heap of pasta, that could have used more sauce and cheese. Felt like we got a spaghetti dish with a side of Chicken. And the bread that came with it, was so hard, it hurt my teeth to finish it, so it was thrown away. Definitely not worth $13.95. The Chicken Alfredo was very well received by the person who ordered it. As always, no complaints about our Medium Thin Crust Cheese Pizza. We also asked for some ranch on the side.

Conveniently located within walking distance of several major 300+ unit apartment villages in the southwest neighborhood of Enterprise. Most Mountain's Edgies can count on the Chicago pie being better than the coupon stuffing national chain delivery places, but hey if you want Heatza-Phut, Little Pizza! Pizza!, or that Papa more power to you. This restaurant offers dine-in, pickup, and delivery. 

The pub has several great beers on tap and a selection of drinkable wines and huge televisions playing all manner of popular sporting events. Seating is limited because of the immense popularity of the business from surrounding renters looking for a chill sports bar with good food. This location is conveniently located within Smith's Shopping Center at the corner of Rainbow and Windmill and is a big draw for the hugely popular neighborhood.

The pizza comes in several delicious varieties: thin, double-dough, pan, and Chicago style deep dish and even calzone. Pastas, wings, and salads available.

Stable, friendly crew with charisma and charm. Only minor drawbacks: wayyyyy busy , nicely crowded because of popularity ( brainstorm: buy out the comic book store next door and expand!! #dreamingon ) , no hard alcohol (#drats), not open 24 hours, no gaming. Aw, heck... these all sound like advantages instead of disadvantages.

What do you call sauce so thin it barely covers the pizza? ROSATI'S
What do you call so few ingredients on the top of a pizza that an ant would starve walking between them? ROSATI'S!!!!

We ordered and they gave our pizza to another house! They called and said they were sorry and did we still want to order a Pizza? SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! Are you kidding? It was after 8 and now we have no dinner! So they said if we wanted  them to remake, we could get 50% off...NEXT TIME WE ORDERED! Earth to Rosati's: WHAT NEXT TIME? I suggested a discount RIGHT NOW! They gave 50% with a promise of 30 minutes. Over an hour later they came... with cold pizza. The pizza was extra cheese, black olives, mushrooms and tomatoes with bacon and peperoni on top of that for one half. You couldn't find more than five mushrooms on the 18"" pizza. Cheese was very thin and only covered the middle with at least a two inch ribbon of the flat part of the dough with no cheese, very little sauce and not other ingredients on it...then the crust of another inch and a half wide. It was undercooked dough and cold. So they clearly took the 50% off the bill and also off the ingredients! It was the worst pizza I have ever had, made even worse by their absolute ineptness.  

They said their double dough was like hand tossed. WRONG!! It was so thick it didn't even COOK! It was like most pan Pizza would be. The dough was rubbery and raw and tasteless. The sauce sooooo thin it was pink instead of red. The cheese was also barely noticeable...and remember, I ordered EXTRA CHEESE! Do yourself and your family a big favor NEVER ORDER FROM THIS FAILURE OF A PIZZA PARLOR! If you have hated, despised, awful people in your life, send them to ROSATI'S for the worst pizza they will ever eat. I am surprised people who take their kids their don't lose the kids for abuse!
