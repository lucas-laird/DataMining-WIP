Also, the music is really loud, so I wouldn't bring a date here.  You literally have to yell to each other if you want to say something.  Also, you have to put up with the karaoke divas.  Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're not.  It's a risk you have to take.  The dance floor was dead, but that's because none of the music was hype.  Lol.

Aside from all that, the food is really good!  They make hella good sisig.  Also their crispy pata is good too!  I tried their pancit a while back and had no complaints.  There's not many places to get sisig in Vegas, so this place can satisfy that craving.  Good food, just some things you have to put up with.. ^_^",Y3sfm2jsyxa4n_Q1E-1L4Q,2,2,3,Ix3U29RVVmgPiuJBFSh-Gw

Their sisig is not the typical one that you would get anywhere else.  Sisig is supposed to be various pork meats (I'm not even mentioning what cuts of pork it is) with peppers and spices with a side of lemon, served on a sizzling platter.  Their version is what I would call chicharrón chopped up into smaller pieces.  But nonetheless...it saves me time from picking out the ""bad"" pieces of pork, and instead lets me enjoy it instead.

Their sisig, or whatever is should be called is delicious!!!

It can get ""ghetto,"" depending on the night you come in.  It's pretty much hit-or-miss.  One night, it was ""tango"" themed.  Pretty cool watching the couples dance formally.  Some nights it'll be middle-aged women getting their groove on.  Not a pretty picture.

It took me forever to find a parking spot which I did not mind because it's a Friday. Then when I was inside it took me forever for the waitress to take my order. Or even ask me what I want to drink. The waiter seems to be interested in attending their regular customers so said to my self maybe this is how things work in this place. And then finally after waiving to the waitresses like catching a cab someone came and took my order. So I ordered the SISIG when my order finally arrive I was kind Off dis

appointed because the SISIG is dry and the taste is not what I am expecting. Although I keep on tasting it trying to figure out why the taste is not good and dry. 

And then finally I called the waitress so I ask her is this a chicken or pork SISIG. Since I ordered a pork SISIG the waitress said it's a pork SISIG. So I ask her why is it dry any way all I can say. If you are a regular in this place maybe you will say thumbs up. But for me this place sucks the service sucks.

They made reservations for up to 12, but for most of the evening, there was only 9 of us.  To seat us all, they had to move two tables for six side by side.  As the night wore on, a large group of people came in, and wanted to sit together.  The solution of the waitstaff was to move our group of 9 to the table of six.  Without telling us a thing, they began to move all the food down to one end of the table, then tried to have us shift down toward the end.  Well, if you can imagine it, some of us were still eating food, and would have to move our plates to where someone else was just eating...no cleaning the spot, nothing.  I don't know what the extra three people were supposed to do in this scenario, it wasn't explained.  Well, at the time I was raising hell about being moved from a table I was eating at because another group arrived and wanted my space, two more from our group arrived, and then we had 11 of the 12 slots filled.  They decided not to move us, but they did communicate to me, that because I was loud (having to complain over loud music, a normal tone of voice would not be heard) they thought of cashing us out and making me leave, at least.  I'm not sure if the intent was to completely ruin someones birthday or not.  Anyway, they made it clear that I was wrong.  Me. The customer.  The guy that was eating food at a table with my friends.  A guy that was ready to pay the bill for the food, table and service.  To their credit, they did not make me leave.  I was informed that they had to change waitresses because I raised a stink.  Clearly, the customer was quite wrong.

Now to review the rest.  The new waitress was capable and attentive.  The music for dancing was fine.  The place had good energy.  I had fun.  I've had the food on four prior occasions, and while I'm not an expert on Filipino food, I've had enough to know that it's the worst of what I have eaten.  Maybe, somewhere, there is a Filipino restaurant with worse tasting food.  When I find it, I'll let you know.  The portions are large, but so is the price.  A quick word about the sisig...I've eaten it, and it's dry and chewy.  That's not how it is served in the Phillipines.  I'm not quite sure what sisig the other reviewers have eaten, but this is just plain bad.  For the adventurous person not deterred by this review, feel free to eat here so long as you are flexible enough to move with your food to another table if someone else wants take your spot.",sJ0PxiYyMkOCy1VCIEWs1Q,3,1,2,_Ms9nFXJdmt6lmRcXpFBsw

Definitely going back again... just drinking a little more next time. ;)",TSZhoVwD1HJxZKzWpW8J5w,0,0,5,o_csWLZvm3TxBnpLyMfsbQ

1717196,2015-09-07,0,2I_qSTehoUFsDNjaqCVxlA,"Brief Overview:
This is a cool little hole in the wall place that offers music, bar, and dance floor for most of your entertainment needs

Pros:
- Pretty good dance floor to bust a move on (I got down with my bad self) ;-)
- Great for large groups for parties and karaoke singing (DJ had a good selection of dance songs and oldie jams)

Cons:
- It can be challenging to find a decent parking spot close to the cafe on a busy night
- The food options are good if you like to eat, but more vegan, organic and/or NON-GMO options would be nice (it's a bar so I guess this to be expected)

Final Verdict:
I went here for a birthday party for a friend and had a good time. I recommend it for groups looking for a fun place to karaoke sing and dance.",s1DTIKX-ZXcQOMDlcOI6Tg,1,1,3,N0Wuk7o-LNil5IGxu-V2NA

We were there on a night when there was a 70th birthday party going on. So that alone was entertainment enough. We sat at the bar and the bartender made good drinks. He made me a ""bartender's special"" which he says had like 5 types of alcohol. It was good and definitely not watered down. Although it tastes like a fruitified long island. 

My other half was stoked that there was San Miguel. The sisig was good. 
The lumpia on the other hand did not seem or taste real. It was like store bought ready to fry lumpia. What's up with that yo? 

Other than the fake lumpia, this place was fun. Nothing classy about it ... but not too trashy. My friends who are Vegas locals however did warn us that one of their friends got shanked like 50 times ... so .... that kind of put us on some type of alert. We didn't stay too long.

Majoring in culinary arts, that's the one thing I learned in purchasing, sodas are the only thing that really dont hurt a business, everything else? yeah. 
Of course I sang a few songs. 

Negative: Small dessert section. Charging extra for refills. Oh if you go as a group and have your check split, Dont count on it. 

I did have a good time at the place, but its rather frustrating to have an establishment not to bend a lil. I mean what are they, AZ when it comes to the new law?

We were sat in a booth were the upholstery was torn and not taken care of at all. If you are going to run a restaurant, run one professionally. The whole family of the owners were at the bar and were loud. We are eating and all we can here is their conversation yelling back and forth. They also had a baby behind the bar area and they kept trying to entertain the baby all night long. This is not a daycare. The host/waitress of the other table wore shorts as if going to the beach. No uniforms at all. The cooks and our waiter were the only ones in uniform. The Bistek Tagalog I ordered was of poor meat quality and tough. 

PRO: Huge place for parties and looks like a nice dance floor. Looks like Karaoke is there as well. The waiter was courteous and nice but that's about it.

My first impression was I know not no strip club so not expect all the glamour or high tech stuff. They still have dg that was playing all the current catchy songs too some old ones. The place is pretty dark dark and if looking too meet someone good luck, You need night vision goggles too find them. Since low ceiling the place can get fairly loud so conversations need too shout in the ear. (really is it that much difference then club on the strip?). The drinks price I thought was fair but too be honest not much of club club person. I believe they take song requests and certain nights they have karaoke most nights?? The dance floor is actually decent size for the small location. Once it gets packed really hard too find table area so want hang out all night best too get there early. Cafe Moda definitely has its own personality and if looking too mix things up get away from the strip club or the cover charge Cafe Moda great choice.

The first time I went to Cafe Moda, I lost my ID somewhere on the strip (which is probably a common thing)... so I didn't get to go in :(  Looked so much fun though!!

This is the second time I went to Cafe Moda and this time I had an ID!!!! There wasn't too many people there which was nice, but the music was so lively and our waitress was kick ass (only to find out she was a great singer!!!!)  

There was 5 of us in our group and we ordered: sinangag rice, steam rice, sinigang, sisig, and Crispy Pata.  The food was delicious!!!! I loved the fact the sinigang had so much vegetables in it!!!! soooo yummy!

There is either karaoke night and or a dj playing some good music, and everyone dancing on the dance floor.

PORK SISIG- this is crispy pork with vinegar and a lemony zesty goodness aka MY FAVORITE
TOKWAT BABOY- this is also crispy pork with tofu, and vinegar soup, so good with white rice!

Me and the wifey came on a Thursday night at about 9:15. First thing I noticed as we walked in was the blaring music they were playing and people that were dancing ballroom style. For a second I thought we went in through the wrong door because outside it wasn't marked clearly. 

Once we were greeted by the hostess and was led to our table, we weren't too sure if we should eat there or take our food to go. Since we really didn't want to wait til we got home to eat, we decided to tolerate the club style ambiance and ordered it for there. Im kind of glad we stayed because what happened next was really something you cant forget.

We ordered Pork Sisig and Tokwat Baboy. As we were waiting for our order, we were watching all the peeps that were on the dance floor do their thing. Now I wasn't sure if this was a typical Thursday night because upon looking further, we noticed the crowd was a mix of young and old folks. The DJ was playing a mix of fast moving songs from the 60's to today. Didn't matter what he played, everybody on the dance floor did their thing. What really caught my eye was when they played ""Gangnam Style"". I kid you not I swear I saw at least 2 old ladies that could have been my grandma doing the dance like they were Psy themselves! Wow. Dinner and a show!

So we finally get our food. If you refer to my pics, these two dishes alone could have fed at least 4 people so we knew we were gonna have leftovers for the next day which wasn't a bad thing. Of course we had steamed rice to go along with it so if you think we were gonna eat it just by itself than you are so wrong.

Service was mediocre. Our server came by every so often to check up on us but it seemed like forever in between those times.

The food itself was definitely worth it just going there. Only thing is, I think its a bit pricey. The Sisig was 13 bucks and the Tokwat Baboy was 11 bucks. At some other Filipino places, it was definitely cheaper.

So in my opinion, if you don't mind the loud, blaring music and the out of tune karaoke singers, then eating here should be ok for you. Otherwise, call ahead and get your food to go.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,10,8,3,F-hLzEVETfLkabgr39ymGw

Went with a party of six during the evening.

Atmosphere: Dead, unless you do something about it.
The interior of the restaurant is dark but is given another dimension of sensory stimulation with the loud music from the bar and the karaoke from the main dining room. My party and I decided to participate in karaoke, which made things on our personal ends a little more fun. Other than that, the decor and lack of lighting did not make it feel more welcoming.

Service: Not bad
The server did her job. We got food in a timely manner, our drinks were refilled when they needed to be, we got more food when we asked. The server was nice, but no true memorable qualities or moments were created that evening.

Food: Authentic!
Growing up with Filipino food, the food was pretty legitimate! All the flavors were on point and at a fair value, too!

Summary: Aight
If you are willing to get a taste of Filipino food and don't mind an non-responsive environment, give this place a shot!",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,1,0,3,nUP_kcge6TsPLPHjvb_miw

This place is a restaurant and dance club in one. The music is a mix up of old and new school and the food is Filipino themed.

I honestly felt like I was in another country and I think that's just because the clientele is mostly Pacific Islanders.

Although on both occasions I've only been here a moment, I know that I did enjoy myself here with my good friends. We danced, ate, and drank and danced some more.

If you're that person and want to try a new experience of food and dancing, you may want to consider entering the world of Cafe Moda and be transcended to a different experience!

It's a great feeling to stuff yourself full of rice and sisig after a night full of drinking at the club. Food was good, and drinks were cheap. The crowd is majority of Filipino people from young and old. Plus mix in a few black and mexican heads. 

Moda is a Kareoke bar first and foremost, but they do play hiphop inbetween sets and people usually get down on the dancefloor. It's a great place if you're looking to shock your filipino friends with something new hahah!

Then at about 10 pm, some of the people in our group were asked to vacate the tables for newcomers. That made us very upset since that was very rude and we were still enjoying the evening. When we complained to the manager instead of acting like a diplomatic listener, she was acting combative.

The overall ""ambiance"" (if you can call it that) is not very inviting, in my opinion. It's dark, with minimal decor, and ""party"" style tables. The ""bouncer"" there was just chillin' at the bar, and the bartender was just as inattentive to any potential customers coming through the door.

I went on a weekday at about 8 in the evening? The only people in there was a group that consisted of about 4 older Filipino men, I'd say around... hmm mid 30s to early 40s, and a bunch of young girls... somewhere around their 20s? Them,  and a middle aged couple. 

Anyways, I was having a good time with my 2 girlfriends, singing karaoke and such. I was stoked because I actually got the couple to slow dance when I sang ""Crazy"" by Patsy Cline. My friend Amber sang a Britney Spears jam, just so I wasn't hogging the mic... well, I was up there for the 3rd time, since uh, there was no one else in there, and our other friend, Maria didn't want to sing, then SUDDENLY, as I was approaching the last lines of ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor the ""DJ"" cuts my song off, and decides to introduce one of the girls sitting with the Filipino Mafia, or whatever, saying she has a CD coming out. 

Really? Well, whatever... Perfect timing. Just when Amber was about to tip the DJ he cut me off.. NO MORE! Not since he pulled that stunt. 

So I sat down with my friends, and we attempted to listen to this girl's supposed skills on the mic, and I have to say, I'm not the best singer, but I was definitely better than her. 

I'm giving this place one star, NOT ONLY for the horrible DJ, but for the horrible service, and UNDER SERVICED restrooms, not to mention the uncaring workers.",voYIq2C9eAAeoQZaSyYQ8Q,8,2,1,aDkzM6SFkwv9j9tsby3HjA

The decor definitely needs updating... when you walk in, it's like you're stepping back into the 80's. There's a dance floor and a stage in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant is rented out sometimes for private parties but they still welcome other patrons even though there is another function going on. The first time I went here, there was a huge family reunion and they were showing videos and a slideshow of that family. It felt like we were party crashers but we made the best of the situation.

The place was kind of dingy with dimmed lights and loud music. The dining tables were wrapped around the small dance floor and the only kind of light that was provided were from the candles, disco ball, and the big TV screen that was on stage where the karaoke mics were. 

As for dinner, I gotta give it to them and say that it was quite tasty. I was satisfied with everything that was ordered and pretty much licked the plate clean - totally murdered it. We ordered:

Tosilog (pork with fried rice and fried egg) - $9.95
Sisig (shredded pork w/ onions n' mushrooms on a sizzling plate) - $12.95
Sizzling Black Pepper Chicken - $10.95
Garlic Fried Rice $7.95

Service: I thought was okay, not friendly at all, our waitress was kind of stuck-up'ish. We ordered water to start off with and she came back with six bottles of the small 0.5L Arrowhead Bottle water which were at $3 a pop - that's $18 for just water! (This is the kind of water that I can get for 50¢ at 7-Eleven). We flagged her down and told her we wanted tap water (the free kind that comes in a glass), but she told us they didn't serve tap water - which didn't make ANY sense because ""later"" on that night I saw people at the next table over with tap water! And on top of that, I too was able to get water from a different waitress so that totally pissed me off!!!

Note: She quickly gave us our checks before we were even done eating and told us we had to pay because she had to clock out. The rude part was when she came back with our cards and waited for us to sign the checks and see how much we were going to tip her. The next thing you know, she was changed into her hoochie-mama outfit and was on stage doing karaoke! (I guess someone was in a hurry to go sing).",0HdTa-MiPaoeEfM8RK63kA,2,1,2,QHe51YJUz3zuvpx0Vo7LGw

The DJ is the best thing about this place. Fun karaoke, good line dancing, good dance floor and tunes. And that's where anything good about this place stops. Comes to a screeching halt.

The food is okay. I have tried several things and wasn't overly impressed by anything. It was edible and that's about as good as it gets. I did enjoy the fried banana the first time I went but it had lingering tastes of French fries and fish so I know the oil needed to be changed. 

Drinks. This is a bar but every potent potable I have ordered is either barely drinkable or ghastly. This past time I had a shot of Fireball, that was great you can't mess that up.  Then I had a mango mojito. I thought with a mojito you muddle the mint not chop it up in a blender with your drink. If you are going to offer it, don't be lazy make it correctly. My drink was frothy, and chunky, very unpleasant. It tasted vaguely of mango.  I couldn't finish it since I was picking SALAD out of my mouth from drinking it. I decided to try a grasshopper here. Hands down WORST drink I have ever had. And I've had a lot drinks in my time and This isn't my first grasshopper. It tasted like mint was in it but I have no idea what else was in there but it was absolutely nonpalatable. 

The service. I can't decide which is worse, the drinks or the service. Maybe more servers are needed? Maybe better trained servers to handle large parties? I never knew who my server was because she came around so few times. I was just randomly ordering from anyone who looked like they worked there.   One server said she wasn't my server but yet she was at my table??? Do they have sections? My food took so long I got to the point where I was HANGRY and nearly left. To wait that long for mediocre food is unacceptable. Then the owner? Head hostess? An Asian lady with tattoos on her arms, a nasty attitude and a smart looking blazer who has the air of some kind of authority figure asked me if I was with a party. Yes.  Our party had two tables. A lot of our party was up dancing and socializing at the other table. She asked me if more people were coming. Why, would I know? Can't you see I am eating? We have two tables, we can't all fit at one.  Was she planning on asking the three of us to move and to where? (There were many open booths, it's not like the place was so full they didn't have space and after 10pm my understanding is there are no reservations...its first come first serve.) Not very friendly. I don't understand what the point of her questions were. How is everything may have been a more poignant question. Well, actually not very good, but she probably knows that so doesn't ask.  No one asks!

It's true what everyone says- it's really dark in there, I had to use my cell phone light to see what I was eating half the time.  It was pretty empty when we arrived at 9pm on a Weds night, even though it was their 7th Anniversary celebration.  We sat down and ordered just as they were starting up the Karaoke session.  

We ordered:
Ox Tail soup- pretty bland but vegetables and ox tail was good
Kare Kare- a stew with ox tail and peanut butter and veggies...sounds kinda gross but was actually pretty good, it comes with a shrimp paste you can add to the sauce to give it more flavor.
Mike Bihon- rice vermicelli noodles and thicker udon like noodles stir fried with vegetables, it was okay
Sisig- fried finely chopped pork bits/parts brought out on a sizzling plate.  This one was pure awesomeness if you like that sort of thing. You squeeze lemon on it and eat with rice and its a good night...

I've been here a handful of times (both for a functions and just as a drop in to get a drink after dinner) and every time they've been super busy with some kind of party. So normally I have to sit at the bar since most if not all the tables are taken up. Come early if you want a table. 

The employees here are a hit or miss as far as friendliness is concerned. If you don't buy drinks or food, they pretty much ignore you, but if you get something, they are always there asking if you want a refill. I don't normally come here for more than just one or two drinks unless I'm here for a party as their drinks seem a bit high for off the strip and their drinks aren't all that strong (mixed drinks like Rum and Coke).

The food that I've had here has been delicious!! I definitely suggest trying the Sisig, Kare Kare, BBQ Skewers, Adobo chicken, Tapsilog, Bihon and Canton noodles, and Calamari. All of these dishes I've tried and have been satisfied with them. 

This place is casual, but most of the ladies that come here like to dress up, but they guys are usually just with jeans and a nice top. I don't even think they have a dress code. Every time I've been here, even really late at night, there have been children here, so it's not what I'd consider a nightclub, but they do have a dance floor where you can get out and shake your thing if you want too. It has a family-friendly feel..just like when us Filipinos have our parties at our houses. 

This place is really small, so expect it to get very crowded during the weekend and late nights. Parking is also kind of tricky if you don't come early. I've had to park across the street on several occasions and walk over since the parking lot is very limited and it is shared with all the business in the shopping center.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,28,25,4,MqUm2r-FZb_XeEKfIYJlpQ

4264917,2010-05-03,3,2I_qSTehoUFsDNjaqCVxlA,"I've been here 3 times, not by choice, and I have not ever left this place happy. It's a late night hang out with karaoke, food and alcohol... You always expect, any place that has a karaoke machine, will have people who think they can sing or people that are so drunk that they think they sound awesome. I'd never return if it weren't for the people that we hang out with, I'd NEVER return here. My most recent visit was last night and here's the play by play... 

Right when you walk in, it smells like rotten eggs. There's is usually someone there, bouncer type person, usually LARGE and in charge. From watching the rumors, I've heard that they've had to to hire more security due to the ""Fights"" that break out there-- GHETTO. Then you're walked over to your table, keep in mind that the place is so dark. I get it, there's a dance floor and you want the lighting so low to hide the fugly-ness of your patrons but c'mon... You have a bunch of drunktards roaming around in this cramped restaurant, give the place some light! 

We were greeted by this grumpy, older Pilipino lady dressed in the most casual of clothes. She took our orders and brought over our food and that's it. Soo the services sucks booty. 

So, to deal with the music, karaoke and the dumb drunk people that go there, I drown myself in alcohol, which makes me visit the restrooms more times than I'd like. EVERY TIME I GO HERE, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE RESTROOMS. The first time I went there, there was water all over the floor, which I believe was from the toilets, ew! On my next visit, the toilet was broken and they didn't put a sign on the door to tell you ""HEY! Don't pee in here... Or crap, cos it ain't goin to go where it needs to go!"" This last time that I was there, the locks fricking didn't work in the stalls so I accidentally walked in on someone and then someone almost walked in on me, luckily I was holding the bottom of the door closed so, sorry, no free shows! 

Ok, the FOOD. I miss pilipino food, being from San Diego, there is a plethora of this cuisine to choose from. There aren't many selections here in the desert so I was SO disappointed in their food and the fact that good Pilipino food is hard to come by out here. I had the Tapsilog... First of all the rice had no taste... It had the look and smell of fried rice but it was in no way close to tasting like fried rice. The tapa looked like it was burnt to a crisp and-- you know how meat looks like if you fry it for too long? Yep, that's what it looked like, gross and inedible. I was hungry and a little buzzed so I ate it anyway. It tasted like day old meat that they flash fried to pass off as fresh. It was horrible. And, my companions had the Tosilog... And ended up throwing up and having the runs. 

The next time that I receive an invite to go to this establishment, I am going to give them a BS excuse or flat out ""HELL NO"".

Me and a group of friends went here last night for some drinks. We ordered a shareable cocktail but wasn't happy with the taste. There was little to no alcohol in the drink, so we brought it back to the bar to kindly ask for more. When we asked the server for more, a woman named LEILANI claiming to be the manager, confronted us in the most outrageous, disrespectful manner. 

Obviously pissed off at us, she told us she was the one who made the drink and there was enough alcohol in it. She yelled at us to bring the drink back and to WATCH her pour how much alcohol she puts in it. Who does that? What kind of customer service is that? Another friend with us that night happened to be a bartender as well at a different bar. After watching her pour the alcohol, like she asked, he advised that was not enough alcohol for the shareable drink we ordered.

We shared one plate and even had left overs that we ate the next day for lunch.

A friend and I came here based on a recommendation from a co-worker last Thursday night. I was a little hesitant to come, since parking at this plaza is usually a nightmare. We found a spot right across from Cafe Moda and walked in. There was a bouncer at the door, no cover, and maybe only 8 people in the entire place. The place is a restaurant by day and a karaoke dance floor/bar at night. Despite the small crowd, I had a blast watching the drunk regulars singing their hearts out on the karaoke machine. We chatted it up with the manager and she told us that everyone calls her Mama Lu. She brought us some Sisig to try with our drinks and it was delicious. She introduced us to the other regular customers and the servers and really made us feel at home. I've decided to make this my friendly neighborhood bar! 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,1,0,4,cQgpdG_yn5Do1lrdQVgjtg

She thought she could be a smart alec with me until she found out I went up one side of her and down the other. After ordering bottle service we were allowed two mixers. So we go through the mixers only to find out she wants to charge us for all mixer refills. Correct me if I'm wrong but when you go to a club and get ""bottle service"" the price of the mixers are included. Not at Cafe Moda. It would have been nice to know this prior to opening the bottle. Needless to say I told them to take the opened bottle back. That's just the beginning. My guests didn't have napkins. We didn't have enough plates or place settings. The waitress was not clearing plates. Not everyone had drinks (not even water). I was bussing the tables and waiting on my own guests. This place is a joke.

She said they have a good version of it here, and also because she wanted to show me how the place is like one of the beer gardens we have in the Philippines. First impression, it's a little bit on the divey side. It was pretty quiet at around 6:30 on a Thursday night. But we were told it's ballroom dancing night, so I got a little excited about that. 
We ordered our food - sisig, grilled squid, tokwat baboy, and lots of rice. The sisig was definitely a different version than what I've been used to. Instead of the chopped, salad type texture, it was dry and crunchy. Like chopped pork rinds, instead of the usual pork ears and cheeks. It was still good, albeit not what I was expecting. The tokwa't baboy tasted like paksiw. Too vinegar-y. The tokwa (tofu) better than the pork belly (gasp!). The grilled squid was good, but nothing special. 
Because it's ballroom dancing night, we were immediately approached by a few DIs (dance instructor). They're the resident dance partners who are there to teach the newcomers or just dance with the regulars. In return, you can buy them drinks, and/or tip them at the end of the night. For the record, we did neither, as a matter of principle, ha! We weren't there for that long. We danced a few times (cha-cha, salsa, swing, boogie). It was a lot of fun. The DIs know what they're doing. The place started to fill up with more patrons and based on their dance moves, we could tell they were regulars. I wish we have something like this in Reno.

My only issue is the customer service and the owner(manager?). 

I called Friday afternoon to see if it was possible to make a last minute reservation for the day. Instead of simply saying no, I got a ""It's already 7:00! How many people and what time?"". When I told the manager 9:30 she said ""Oh no the last reservation I take is at 8. After that first come first serve and GOOD LUCK because we're very busy"".

I just remembered that maybe 2 weeks before the above incident, we were seated at the corner back table. One of our friends moved her chair which unintentionally pulled the lamp's plug. It was too tight of a squeeze for her to fix it. Later, the manager/owner came and had us plug it back in, which isnt a problem at all. BUT she also accused us of hiding alcohol under the table. She even checked.  Come on now, we are regulars at this eatablishment AND we had buckets of beer on our table. This kind of treatment makes me question the worthiness of Cafe Moda.

At that point I had not asked my servers name but I hate that sort of reply where you pass it on to your manager acting helpless or offering a solution ... I asked how to spell her managers name mainly because I couldn't hear and I always ask names for my reviews .. I don't know what crystals deal  was or if she was unhappy with the fact people had requested separate checks  I don't really know .. I'm mainly salty because I would of liked more than one soda and I definitely would of enjoyed some food but maybe next time I can come back and update to 5 stars .

The manager saved the rating by making sure our group was able to get moved to a table and she was really great about explaining the problem which could of been told to my entire group by our waitress and it would of made everyone's lives easier but thankfully the manager understood what the dilemma was and also explained it was our organizers fault about why we were not all allowed to sit together so in turn we got moved to a large table just lost our waitress ... which meant I didn't really get to sample a lot of goodies but I got a few photos of the food folks at my table got ..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,0,0,4,1bNUloE2du6Qe3mT62F46g

However, if you're looking for a non-pretentious place to just have a quick drink and dance to some good music (especially if your Filipino), this is an OK place to go.",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,2,3,3,QVShcwL6i7yruL6Yz2LDDg

5085165,2016-02-04,10,2I_qSTehoUFsDNjaqCVxlA,"Wow. This place is pure entertainment. For some reason thinking about this place makes me laugh. There's dancing, drinking, karaoke, and Filipino food here. This is the perfect place to be fobulous. 

Dancing here is like a never ending Filipino wedding reception ""open dancing"" if you will. Complete with various line dancing and hits from 80s, 90s, and today. Whatever the DJ feels like will get the crowd dancing. Slight annoyance, cool it on the JLO. ""Waiting for tonight"" is not really danceable. It's funny watching the older generation do ""watch me whip, watch me nae nae"" ... So gangsta! Lol.

It is so loud in there you can barely have a conversation with someone across from you. I guess that really pushes you to do less talking and more action. Get your booty on that dance floor! 

I can't recall a drink menu, but I would imagine they would have some fruity, island cocktails. Stick with the basics: whiskey/ginger ale and cranberry vodka. Kind of boring, but they can't really mess those up. Drink prices were okay. 

Food. Everyone and their momma comes to Cafe Moda for the sisig. It's pretty good here. I don't normally order sisig at other places and I don't eat Filipino food outside of home, so no comparison. I can't say it's the best, but it is comfort food and definitely hits the spot when one is craving the sour, salty, spicy concoction of crunchy, chewy pig parts. 

Not much to say about their karaoke, since I didn't participate. It was nice to hear some good voices up there though. 

Service can be spotty, but I think it was hard to get the waitresses attention due to the loud noise. Otherwise food came out within a reasonable amount of time. 

Late nights and hungry bellies either mean the usual rotation of Cafe Moda, pho, oxtail soup, or steak and eggs. Foreal though!

It was my first time and reason of my presence there, it was the meeting point my friend Will suggested before heading out.  

Being filipino it just seemed natural to at least try this place once since it's so popular with my race.  Came here at about midnight and the moment I stepped in I felt like i was back in the army stationed in South Korea haha.  So much ladies of the filipino ethnicity being escorted by old white males. I thought the beer prices would match the interior of this place but I was wrong.  Still $4.50 which I thought was still too high for a place that looked like this.

While waiting, I also decided to order something to eat.  Just wanted to kill time while waiting for my buddies. Ordered a calimari.......not that good and the sauce that came with it was some type of vinegar that made my breath funky.  So bad that even the fresh off  the boat ladies didn't wanna talk to me.  I would recommend this place to the older asian generation and any looking to find and older partner to leave with it.

BTW, I joke around half of the time so I apologize if I offended anyone by the fresh of the boat description of this place.  I'm fresh of the boat too, from the Titanic tour of Luxor I experienced with the yelp crew.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,2,2,2,JaC4XTe08aXcG12z7d3R2w

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with friendly bouncers, servers, and bartenders who have all become more than acquaintances.  It got to the point where I was there every day just to hang out.  I had graduated to being a local drunk of Vegas and had a favorite bartender, Angel.  I just can't get enough of this place.  I've had to pull myself away from here just because I started forgetting about everything else.  It was a place to escape all realities.  

Luckily, they decided to be smoke free, it smells so much better and you still come out smelling like the way you came in unless you've danced the night away and just sweated all over the place.  Not like before when smoking was permitted, I hated the way I smelled after coming out.  The music is a mixture of r&b, rap, and some dance music.  Ordering food is easy as I pretty much like everything they have to offer like the sisig, garlic fried rice, tapsilog, and losilog.  Food is served till late so you can even go to the clubs first and then go to Cafe Moda to eat after.

The best days and times to go if you're looking for dancing and a good atmosphere with young people are Ladie's Nights on Wednesdays/Thursday mornings, Friday nights, and Saturday nights.  But, any other night if you're feeling up to singing, ""Like a Virgin"" it's all a great night for it.

The boys suggested Cafe Moda since they went there the last time and raved about the sisig. So we took cabs to Cafe Moda, which is off the strip. When we got there, there were groups of people outside the door. Inside, we waited to be seated. There was a nice fire at the front and considering how cold it was outside, it was nice to stand in front of it. We were seated withing 2 minutes. It was super dark inside and I couldn't really see other people but there were lots. People were dancing on the dance floor and the DJ was pretty good!

We ordered drinks for each of us (have to if you're in Vegas) and the 2 plates of chicken wings, 2 plates of sisig, and 1 plate of fried rice. My drink was really strong (jack and coke) so it's good to know they didn't skimp on the alcohol. Our food came but they only gave us 1 sisig. We didn't mind though because we got full off the rest of food. Every dish we had was excellent and we polished everything off quickly. We definitely left very satisfied. Didn't stay for any dancing though because we were tired.

The next night, we ended up at Cafe Moda again because we were all hungry at 2am after going to a club. Ordered wonton soup, chicken wings, more sisig, and regular steamed rice. The wonton soup was really flavorful and I thought it was one of the best wonton soups I've ever had. Hmm Filipino wonton soup better than any Chinese wonton soup I've ever had?... yes even though I'm Chinese, I had to admit it. It was damn good! The sisig had too much onion this time because every bite I took had an onion taste... didn't enjoy it as much.

Overall, can't wait to come back to Cafe Moda for the food. It's a small little club too but I wouldn't come here just to dance.",iIEMyqmKwb9hvs8AcOMc2A,1,1,4,MxCeOKEjuG_DbkBVnx9Dow

After trying to talk my sister out of eating here, we ended up eating at the bar since the tables were blocked off for a kid's birthay party (yeah, a kid's birthday party on a Friday night).  

As predicted, the place was obnoxiously loud.  The dj had a thick Filipino accent and was saying stuff like ""happy bird day (happy birthday with a Filipino accent)...you guys wanna dance IN the dance PLOR?""    *CRINGE!!!*

It was precisely what me & my friends wanted to hear on a Friday night/Saturday morning after being at Vanity nightclub. 

Whaaatt?? Sisig? This late at night? Good lawwd.... Yes, pls. 

It's on the corner of Spring Mountain & Jones a little bit past Chinatown. It's not the most attractive place from the outside but I could care less. The food was great, the service was good and the music was dope. We were tripping out the whole night on where we were, what we were eating and what we were listening to.

This isn't a family restaurant. It's 21 & over... More like Bayanihan in Los Angeles back in the 1990s. Our friend who's a local in LV now, brought us to Cafe Moda and we're so glad he did. We were seated at a big table near the small dance floor. Yes, dance floor... complete with fog machine and cheesy disco lights. Awesome! 

Not too long after we were seated, they brought our table bottles of Red Horse beer and San Miguel beer. Hahaha... Our local friend was familiar with the menu and we let him order everything. My mouth is watering a little bit thinking back on the late night meal we had there... We had sisig which was delicious, served on a sizzling plate and we liberally squeezed calamansi on it to top it off. Yup, mouth still watering... We also had lechon kawali which was cooked perfectly and had the requisite Mang Tomas sauce on the side. I would've been good with multiple orders of those 2 pork dishes but more hits were coming.... We also had calamari, pansit bihon, kare-kare, a whole fried bangus (milkfish), lumpia, etc... All the food was delicious. Granted, anything late that night should taste good but if my still-salivating mouth as i type this is any indication of how tasty our dishes were... well, that should be proof enough.

The music was great. They were playing hip hop and r&b classics. It was a live DJ and he definitely kept the dance floor busy. We arrived around 2am, i think, so I'm guessing there were even more people earlier that night. I heard everything from Wu-Tang, Lauryn Hill, Naughty By Nature, SWV, etc.. So many hits from the golden era of hip hop... And to end the night with their last dance they played Jodeci's Come & Talk To Me remix.... WOW. This is what clubs need to do. Play some damn Jodeci at the end of the night. Everyone would leave the spot so damn happy.... no fighting. Strictly on lovemaking missions. HAHAHA....

Cafe Moda might be too hood for some people especially if you're used to eating on the strip or were expecting a Goldilocks type atmosphere. The place is loud, it's dark, the fog machine is out of control... But the music is on point & the food hits the spot.

Be back to Cafe Moda next time we're in town. Lookin forward to it... Mouth is watering, once again.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,0,2,4,zym0rN0ByTJACq_ZEh111A

Come here for late night, pretty tasty authentic Filipino food and if you want to be hit on by the creepy uncles that are old enough to be your grandfathers while the aunties mad dog you while wearing their Cucci, Prava and Louise Booton handbags. It's reminiscent of Lourdes' in National City and Tita's II in Paradise Valley so if those are your jams, you'll feel right at home, Uncle Boboy.
 
Parking is terrible, similar to Convoy parking in cramped tiny lots. Interior of the bar is more attractive in the dark, dingy and old but serving it's purpose nonetheless. Service was ok and if you're hankering of for a cold San Miguel beer and artery-clogging delicious fried everything, this is your spot. 

Music is loud which can be a plus or minus for some folks but the classic jams will take you back to your 80s and 90s heydays. There was a dude singing his heart out on karaoke, possibly auditioning to be the replacement for Journey's frontman. He was pretty good actually, can't lie about that.

So I get in and it's like...being back at Serramonte Mall. HAHAHA! HELLLA Filipino folks! I mean, there were a few other spots of colors here and there, but Manilla was in the building! LOL (hey, I love my PI people! Manny #1! haha). 
The floor was packed with some maddd fly females and the occasional dude who has NO CLUE as to what dance to do when the music starts up. I almost was about to call the medics for this one Asian dude who started this weird jerking, body-stuttering motion. I wasn't sure if homeboy was feelin the groove or having a seizure. But tell me why homeboy had like 3 of the baddest ladies dancing around him!? HAHAH! So I wasn't mad though..well not that much lol. 
There was this one cute female though who kinda creep'd me out though because no one wanted to dance with her. So she decided to play Go-Fish and just dance AROUND dudes and hope one would turn around and hit their Dougie on her. That was a negative. LOL! This one cat was hittin the Cat Daddy and she got behind him and started mimic'n his movements..but HORRIBLY OFF. She kept trynna edge around so he'd see her and they'd dance, and this foo just rotated the same direction to avoid eye contact. HAHAHAH!! Priceless!

5812544,2013-01-12,0,2I_qSTehoUFsDNjaqCVxlA,"Cafe Moda is a Filipino Karaoke bar. They serve a variety of Filipino food as well as their own alcohol concoctions. If you order alcohol, insist on ordering a regular drink (i.e. Vodka tonic, Gin and Tonic, etc.) and not their mixes unless you enjoy fruity drinks that are extremely sweet. Although their names for their drinks are interesting such as the ""Piece of Ass"" which consists of Amaretto, Southern Comfort, and Sweet and Sour Mix, the mix itself is too sweet for my palette.

Cafe Moda is located in a really busy Asian shopping center. Parking is really scarce during peak hours so you may have to park really far away from this place. This was the case when we arrived in the evening.

The setup of this restaurant/bar was interesting. It is essentially one big open space with tables setup surrounding a dance floor and a stage. The people who are sitting at the tables brazenly gaze at the brave soul singing their heart out. I was expecting separate private rooms for karaoke like Korean karaoke places but alas, this place is not like that at all.

Our table ordered a variety of Filipino dishes. I don't know what the names of the dishes were, but the Filipino dishes tasted decent. However, I ordered ceviche (a Latin delicacy) and was quite disappointed. Lime juice is supposed to cook the ceviche but instead, the shrimp was actually boiled in water! Stick with the Filipino dishes as they obviously do not know how to make ceviche. 

There was a live MC that entertained the karaoke and music portion of the entertainment. Initially, there is ambient music in the background playing the latest dance hits from the club, and suddenly, it transitions into someone's karaoke selection. This pattern continues back and forth. If no one wants to sing, the MC will gladly sing a song to fill the void. In addition, the MC frequently sang duet with other singers too which I though was interesting. I liked that the MC was participating and keeping the party alive. 

After a while, the MC lead the group into dancing the electric slide. It was really odd. The only time I have done the electric slide was various company functions. Hence, if you grew up on the electric slide, you would enjoy this. The patrons mostly consisted of Filipinos who love to sing karaoke.",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,0,0,3,GFpVlb59S541-7zrhwH2jw
