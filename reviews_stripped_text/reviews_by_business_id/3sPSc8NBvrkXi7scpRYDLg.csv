Every time we come in we are greeted with smiles and a warm hello. We are regulars now so they know our order. Our server greets us quickly and grabs our order without using a pen and pad. We start with two Creamy Shrimp appetizers that are so amazing with a creamy Sriracha sauce and plump tempura shrimp. The rolls are always perfectly executed by the awesome chef and taste amazing. Master Payo Roll is a must try; we order three of them right through the door. It has a delicious warm kani baked salmon and yummy tabayaki sauce to die for.

688813,2015-10-30,0,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"Let me start by saying, that I love sushi and every where I go I try to have some just to see what's the newest thing out there, having said that this place is AMAZING every single thing I had here was great.

I start with the almond crusted scallops and it was fabulous the way they prepare its unique and it has no wired after taste like in other places the balance between the scallops and the spinach was great, I follow it with a seafood zensai which just by the name had me intrigued, because in the menu says that it comes with chips so I had to try it, and it was wonderful again it's like Japanese nachos with shrimp and scallops just beautiful.


After that I decided to have the real thing, SASHIMI so I order ika, hamachi, maguro, sake salmon, and super white tuna and it had me blown away everything was so fresh and delicious the chef, Saul had a very good technique on the knifed, he offer me this ""house sauce"" that go with the fish, I was a little spectacle about it cuz I like my fish plain but I have to say the sauce was awesome it went really good with the fish like he suggested, after having all this I told him to recommend something good and delicious and he recommend the miso marinated black cod so I try it but I wasn't very exited cuz I have had it before and it's not one of my favorites but I never had it marinated that's why I give it a chance and it didn't let me down It was great as well I don't know how they prepare it but it was full of flavor and it had this crispy touch that I really enjoy, and the best thing it's that all of this was included in the AYCE it's unbelievable, I was very happy with the service and the atmosphere in this place.


And it's probably because this place it's not the best looking place out there it's in wired location right next to a Smith's, but the service, the food, and the atmosphere it's definitely the best out here. I hope and wish nothin but the best to this place and I really hope they stay open for a good while cuz it's really hard to find places like this one.

1049944,2015-09-06,4,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"This sushi restaurant is different. It's ran and managed by hispanics instead of typical Japanese and Koreans in sushi restaurants. The interior of the place is a bit outdated and it smelled like cleaning solutions. I just didn't get a good vibe from the place. However, the food was decent. The rolls were made well and the presentation of the dishes were cute. The Dragon Roll actually looked like a dragon! Their rolls had a little bit too much rice though and the rice that they use isn't sushi rice. The Nigiri is fresh and the cut was a good size. Their Miso Soup was good, but a bit too watered down. I recommend the Sashimi Salad because their dressing is tasty and they don't drown the salad in too much dressing. I give this place 4 stars considering that they are not ran by asians. Got to say I'm impressed at the talent the Hispanics have in running an authentic Asian restaurant;)

I walked in and was greeted by a man who was on the phone. I ordered crab rangoon and chicken teriyaki. The crab rangoon was terrible, it was so salty and it was not creamy like a rangoon is suppose to be, honestly I thought the cream cheese they used was expired. So I tossed the entire appetizer after one bite then moved on to the chicken teriyaki. Depressing, completely bland no teriyaki flavor at all so I also tossed that into the trash. I use to be a cook and their food quality is 1/10. Don't waste your time or money I see this place closing doors like the previous restaurant.",elt6nbq4fRcCn7Enk6e7Tw,5,1,1,OLHyXs-NNe0ZGitBOg5lMg
1135910,2015-05-10,0,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"So I've been here three times now and found a few things I'd like to share.  As some of the reviews here say, Hello Tokyo has been under new management since early April.  They kept the name but little else.  Please pay attention at the dates on the reviews you read here to see which are still applicable.  

This place is currently the best sushi deal in town.  AYCE price for lunch is at $15, while dinner is $20.  Don't let the low price fool you, the fish here is definitely fresh and the food very good.  I also know that they're still making improvements.  They took note of my prior review and last time I ate here, they had octopus!  It's not yet on the printed menu so please ask your server for availability.

I'm a big nigiri fan so I tend to pay close attention.  All I can say is that their nigiri making has gotten better from my 1st visit.  There's less rice, more fish, and better cuts of fish.  I've also had a chance to sample more of the appetizers and there are two that are super awesome.  First is the yellotail with jalapeno, second is the sishito peppers.  I don't know what the authentic sishito peppers is supposed to taste like but theirs is the best I've ever had in my very subjective opinion :-).

Overall, I've basically stopped going to my usual goto sushi bars of Naka and Sakana in favor of Hello Tokyo.  Does that mean that this place is better or the others worst?  No.  They're all very good but this place has the best sashimi and is the best value for my hard earned bucks!",X87BI29HpGXLwjnqbAOctA,7,4,5,sZH5M_6oeYXQjTROryiCMQ

1733013,2015-09-13,0,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"Normally I wouldn't write a review on something I felt was 3 stars... but there is something to be said for this place. Hopefully they are listening and better their establishment--literally. Walking in I thought ""Where did Yelp just take us..."". Obviously not the best location/area for a sushi restaurant, but it's the 2nd closest sushi place to us (Sushi Twister being far closer)... but I was expecting at least something along the lines of Sushi Twister decor/atmosphere. It's not the worst... but let's start off with the seats. OUCH! Very uncomfortable as soon as I sat down I could feel a hard metal coil on the edge of the seat--I would get these seats replaced ASAP. Something about the decor just seemed thrown together & tacky. Enough about the decor itself, it's a hole in the wall and probably will be so for a long time until they can afford to renovate/relocate. 

More importantly is the food, which was surprisingly good when it was good! AYCE at $20 was definitely a deal. Proportionally so though, as some things just didn't sit well with my palette (biggest complaint would either be too much salt/seasoning or far too little). 

Ceviche for instance was a bit too salty to the point where I didn't want to finish it, and was starkly opposite of everything else we ordered. 
Salmon nigiri didn't thrill me, namely because both pieces had sinew attached (that slightly stringy part that isn't suitable for nigiri)... Overall the flavor just wasn't there either... 

Soft shell crab was great surprisingly (few places seem to do it right) which was one of the first things ordered and gave us high expectations. The crispy spinach undernearth paired well, but unfortunately a bit too salty. 

Ordered a few other rolls (spider roll for instance) and had too much cucumber (which seemed to be marinated?) taking away from the other flavors.

Lemon Salmon roll was lackluster (lemon slices being far too thick to be edible with the roll) despite the description & recommendation on Yelp. 

Some of the last rolls we ordered were some of the best.. Master Payo, Corn Crunchy and Kitty.

As far as the service goes it would also probably rank around 2-3 stars as well. While they are friendly and attentive, the service is just far too slow (especially with only 2 tables total being served at a time). Simple things should come out quickly. I.E. an order of nigiri shouldn't come after soft shelled crab. Was also put off a bit by their limitations of AYCE with only being able to order 1 each of the nigiri (but luckily wasn't too thrilled with the salmon to order anymore?) and not including dessert. But hey, $20 anyhow. Also, bring back those crepe dessert items! They certainly sound delicious!

Just work on making the establishment a bit nicer inside and experiment more with some of the lackluster rolls I mentioned and I will definitely return. Unfortunately doesn't beat Sushi Twister when it comes to service/food/decor at the moment however.",ndhakszVplkDWU-2ApTfRw,1,0,3,I_lw0LWbJ5usRyLPp1FJfw
1848451,2015-05-21,6,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"With so many solid reviews and ratings after new management and improvement, I really wish I could give 3.5 stars but as much as I hate to give 3 stars, for me it was a solid 3 star establishment and experience. 

So a Yelp buddy of mine, Eddie had seen reviews on this place and had been mentioning let's give this place a try. Now I live totally on the opposite side of town, but after pictures and reviews I thought, hey let's give it a shot. 

I'm not the type that's turned off depending on location or plaza, but it's all about how it looks inside and the food. But for $20.00. For AYCE sushi I was interested in how this place would turn out. I walk in surprised at the limited seating, lack off decoration, and non matching tables and chairs, and booth seatings that you could feel the springs underneath. 

Being an avid Yelper, I had did my yelp research on the place before coming, so I knew the place was not owned or managed by Japanese, or Asians by that matter, so I wasn't startled when the servers and chefs were Hispanic. It did also seem this was more of a family owned run and operated establishment. So that was impressive. 

I was a bit confused in the beginning because the hand written signs outside said AYCE sushi was $19.99, but there was nothing stating if there was limitations to the AYCE menu or if certain items were only one time order (which some were) so the chef and server had to verbally let us know the AYCE specific limitations. 

I started with sashimi orders, ordering the sashimi salad, the sashimi platter, unagi nigiri, nabeyiki tempura udon and soft shell crab. The platter I thought was really good and the light in house onion sauce was a different twist than the reg soy or ponzu sauce. The sashimi salad was very good! I loved the mango and light citrus dressing on the salad! It was a nice change up from the sesame ginger dressing. The salad was a spring mix compilation but there was definitely more greens that sashimi. The unagi nigiri was pretty standard in regards to rice to fish ratio. The nabeyiki udon wasn't all that great. I was disappointed. The chicken in the udon was seasoned in a way that did not compliment the tempura udon broth. I pretty much only ate the noodles, the aged egg, and shrimp tempura. And the soft shell crab on the menu says it's laid on a bed of greens, but when we got the order we were extremely surprised that it was more like another spring mix salad with two very small soft shell crab pieces... Lots of salad and green fillers which in the beginning I liked the salad but now I was already over it. 

Next round, I ordered the sashimi rice bowl, and again it was topped and piled with the spring mix greens few sashimi and rice buried underneath. Again I was like salad again?! We had also ordered their shabu shabu steak roll, the popcorn shrimp spicy tuna roll, and yellowtail Kama. We ordered yellow tail special roll but they forgot to even bring it out. 

The shabu shabu was bland and meat that topped the roll was more chewy than tender. The popcorn shrimp roll had a nice kick to it and I enjoyed that roll but at this point I was starting to tap out, so it wasn't a big deal that they had forgotten our yellowtail special roll. What was most disappointing was that the yellowtail Kama was asked to be cooked well done, and after devouring the crispy outsides, once we made it more inside of the collar bone, the fish was pink and not cooked. Luckily we noticed it before either my friend and I had taken another bite. 

The chef came by to apologize and we were treated to dessert on the house, strawberry and mango mochi (dessert is not included in AYCE) and those we of course yummy as any other mochi. 

I'm a huge supporter of local business and being a loyal customer, but I try to be as objective and honest as I can be on yelp to give the audience a full understand of the experience in its entirety. I think they will do will for the demographics they may be targeting, but the place lacks in presentation and comfortability to me. The AYCE menu is a little too limited for my liking, when I know I can pay $3 more for a better quality experience. I'm truly happy to see there are other solid reviews from loyal customers and it was bad food at all, just not the AYCE sushi place of choice for me. I do not see myself driving out of my way across town to make it here, when there is better quality elsewhere. So terms of all the AYCE sushi places I have been to in the valley, for me this places stands as a solid 3.",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,11,9,3,y5zmsl4KS-vEAo2KTgPoVA

Walked in to staff watching TV in the dining room. I walked in and they abruptly shut it off and dispersed. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered two rolls and a miso soup. I got my water, but no soup. Chef made my rolls and made small talk. He was friendly. Server who took my order and rang me up said but two words to me, never checked on me, refilled my drink, or brought the soup. 

Menu has standard Americanized rolls- in addition to the usual Philly-Cali-Dragon stuff, there are a few house rolls, each around $10. Menu also offers AYCE, kitchen items included in addition to the sushi. There are some interesting options to make any roll into a low-carb cucumber roll (riceless) for a flat rate, or to make a sushi burrito, with iceberg lettuce? Didn't opt to try those items.

The Julio Jr roll (Chopped albacore, green onions, cucumber topped with halibut, cilantro, jalapeño and ponzu sauce) was fresh but didn't have much of the ponzu sauce, which probably would have kicked up the flavors a bit. The Salmon Lemon roll (Salmon tempura, garlic aioli, masago, avocado, asparagus, topped with salmon, lemon, ikura and ponzu sauce) was decent, even if the combination of tempura salmon and fresh salmon was a new (and odd) one for me. Neither the asparagus nor the ikura had much flavor. 

Can't say I'm likely to come back.  It wasn't even so much the lack of service from the server that was an turn off, so much as their overall careless attitude. No thanks.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,8,3,zwB6UmJrXpKMWK5ifQLK-A
1983944,2015-08-27,1,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"The service is really really super friendly and prompt.

That makes the rest of my review really disappointing, I guess. I finally found another place with great service, but I was so not into my food that I likely wont return. 

I was just having a solo lunch before going grocery shopping next door. I popped in, was seated right away and given water. I was given time to check out the menu and was then checked on in a fair amount of time (like I said, service was good!). 

I ordered the miso soup and a dragon roll. Pretty easy, right? 

The miso soup was BLAND. Seriously, barely any flavor and had a weird texture to it. I could barely even drink the broth. 

The dragon roll. Oh, the dragon roll. To start, the roll was done so loosely it was falling apart with every piece I picked up. Annoying, but not the worst thing ever. After that.... the taste. Again, not as much flavor as other places - maybe not enough sauce on top? It could also have been because the cut of eel seemed really really cheap. It was mostly soggy slimy skin and fat and no actual eel meat. The texture was so gross I actually gagged a couple of times. 

Return customer? Unfortunately not. If it was just one item and not both, I might have been willing to return based on the service as well - but not with both food items striking out. Plus, the dragon roll is my all time favorite, why would I return for less than great taste when I can go elsewhere for great taste at the same price?

For example we would like a cup of ICE. Yep that was a hard one to get across. Anyways, they will leave you alone to make you feel totally ignored. And forget getting refills because they left you alone. 
The part that really turned me off was their ""special"". See I feel specials a meant to bring you back. To perhaps entice you to order either more or different items because the special was so awesome! Well the chicken teriyaki special was rice....more rice....rice again oh and a bit of chicken teriyaki. Too little that I had to literally laughed and say wait I didn't order rice with a side of teriyaki chicken. I ordered teriyaki chicken. (My BF is diabetic so frankly keep the rice lol) they did give me more chicken which was a plus, but did I really have to complaint about it in the first place?
My suggestion if you want teriyaki chicken? Go to the Lava Bowl literally 1/2 mile up the street on Flamingo. Their teriyaki chicken is not only cheaper but you get more of it and tastes better too.

I've been to many sushi places in Vegas this one just opened a few months ago. It explains why there were ZERO ppl eating there when I walked in for takeout. Should have known. Never eating there again. The only positive review I have is their friendly staff. Super friendly and nice! Maybe their other rolls are tasty but the rolls I had were blah. The rolls were literally falling apart and rice was not fresh.,ltk1ZOl61ojhxAq0TRdKNQ,0,0,1,TdNxa3XSL0Jjv5aGSr4CHg

2213450,2015-09-05,2,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"Bait and switch, manager who literally told me ""too bad"" and kept interrupting me, and a menu where several items that were advertised were then unavailable.

They have a hand-written sign in their window for all you can eat for $19.95. Went there with my wife and their ngiri menu is really small and limited. They told us the AYCE is for ngiri and sashimi so I figured that made up for the limited selection. Once we were seated and had drinks served the waiter then told us the orders were limited to one single order of each fish per person per type. So, each of us could get one order of tuna sashimi and one order of tuna ngiri. 

We were already seated and had drinks so we figured the deception was unintentional. We ordered sashimi and when it was brought, there was only 3 pieces but the menu said 6 pieces per order. That is when the waiter informed us the sashimi is only 3 pieces when all you can eat.

We should have left but this was our meal before a show so we were stuck and figured we'd make the best of it.

The next surprise was learning we could not get both ngiri and sashimi for each fish. Instead we now now learned that  it was ngiri OR sashimi. So if we ordered tuna sashimi, we could not then order tuna ngiri.

To make matters worse, there was a single chef and the service was slow.

How could this be worse? Two of the limited items (jumbo scallops and small scallops) were not immediately available because they were frozen and had to be taken out and thawed. Another item on the menu was snowcrab sushi which sounded great but they told us there is none available.

By this point we were done as we had ordered all the sushi we could due to the single order limit.

We ordered desert and when we got the bill learned that desert was not included with the all you can eat. The server had not told us that and argued with us about it. I asked for his manager and he told me he was the manager. I asked for the owner and he told me the owner is in California and good luck contacting him. He told me I have to pay for the desert and if I don't like it ""too bad""

This was absolutely insane.

I will certainly never return to this place.",KStV_CheOAjYF1_Ek0WJuA,0,0,1,uLjaTlq-MGB-9IdH2Q4Fhg

I'll rate the actual service a 3.  Slow restaurant and slow service.

And the sushi itself a 2.  I'm being a bit nice here.

The sushi isn't fresh, probably because this place is a ghost town.  I asked the sushi chef what his freshest fish was, he said all of it.  If that's true, the none of it was fresh by that standard because my sampler plate of salmon, yellowtail & tuna was slimy & gross.

Service was mediocre.  We had to keep asking for stuff even though there were only three customers in the restaurant.

Literally, we placed our own beverage order by speaking up,

My used plates kept stacking up all the way until the end of my meal.

They made a mistake on my girlfriend's order for no onions....she's allergic.

They served us 4 things we didn't order, which seems nice at first until you realize that three of them were filler items including one plate of a fried rice sushi concoction signature item of sorts.  It was tasty enough, but do I need 6-8 pieces of fried rice filler with my all you can eat meal?

The miso soup, which I didn't order (although I do normal like miso soup), was the worst miso I've ever had.

The ambiance of the place is all off.  Japanese decor, the entire staff speaking Spanish & a TV playing the show COPS.  It was just weird.  And no, I'm not making a statement about people speaking Spanish, I'm simply saying all things combined made the atmosphere in the restaurant feel a bit off.

Finally, they don't have a beer & wine license, further altering the atmosphere.

The sushi game in this town is fiercely competitive and this place definitely has it's work cut out for them.  Unless things change in a major way, I can't find a compelling reason to ever go back when so many other places are superior.",XRhw3LhUvbDDaofXTVYrcA,5,1,2,uo6odPdM4dgithothGIiGA

This is a great place for lunch before you go grocery shopping (since it is right next to the Smiths).  I believe this just opened recently.

They offer some great deals since they just opened.  You get a free house roll when you check in.  You are going to want that!  Rolls are about $8-$12.  When we went for lunch today, then also offered discounts for everything in their menu.  I believe everything we had was 50% off.  

We had the popcorn shrimp roll, yellowtail special roll, and the shabu shabu roll.  All were excellent.  I really liked this shabu shabu roll because of the certified angus beef.  

The staff was very friendly.  The sushi chef was very friendly as well.  He let us try different sauces and actually came out to check on us to make sure we had enough sauce.  Service was fast and fantastic.

The only thing I was sad about was they didn't have the dessert I wanted.  They only dessert they had available was mochi.  I wanted to get the Berries de leche crepe.

The place itself isn't in the best of locations. And the inside is nowhere near extravagant. It's very old looking and the booth where we sat at wasn't very comfortable.

The miso soup was good, a lot of tofu chunks, can't go wrong with that. The rolls tasted a little muted and lacked in flavor. 

The shrimp they prepare everything with isn't the same kind of shrimp you see at every other establishment. They're the shrimp you see in popcorn shrimp, small and curled up, not straightened out. It tasted fresh but just too much like popcorn shrimp. Just didn't go well for me. 

Edamame was good. But it just took too long to be delivered. But it did come out super hot and fresh. Tasted delicious.

I got a mochi green tea and that was the only thing that put me in a decent mood.. Well that night at work my stomach was feeling up set.. Well the next day guess who had their head in the toilet! I was puking all day. I'll never go back..",Grer2CtCAJHhTRzpsuAhnA,1,0,1,vZqUdsWiIbk3uYTvvYPoXA
5146016,2015-04-12,0,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"I just can't give this place more than 1 star... 

So we came here because it is right down the street, noticed they opened a few months ago and decided to give it a shot. I knew it was a bad idea as soon as we walked in when we were hit with a smell of paint(?), I don't even know. What I do know is that it wasn't pleasant. 

But, we figured they did open a few months ago, maybe they're still getting everything in order.

The place was pretty empty (only one other couple there) so I figured we would at least have decent service. Not so much. The entire 3 people on the staff were super nice, but I have to agree with another review in saying I really don't think any of them had any experience in serving or restaurant back ground. Waited for quite some time (10ish minutes) before the young waiter even came to get a drink order, of which he only brought half of. We both ordered hot tea and water, had to ask twice for the water. The rest of his service was consistently below par the entire time... I did mention there was only 1 other couple in there... The whole time we were there. But, again, they were super nice. 

Now to the food... meh. The crunchy rice appetizers were the best thing that we ate... the rest was below average sushi.. About the same quality that I get next door at Smith. The miso soup was SUPER salty.. The rice on everything was dry, and the quality of the fish can again be compared to what you can buy next door. The two main rolls we ordered stated that they came with different sauces, when we got the rolls, they were dry. When we asked, the chef said that he put the sauce inside the roll, & sent over the sauces that were supposed to be ""in"" them in ramekins. After splitting the first roll with my hubby, I was pretty much done. 

Definitely won't be back, & unfortunately, this place seems to have a curse on it. I have lived in this neighborhood for over 5 years now, & this is the 3rd restaurant in its place, last two were Italian food, all have been way off the mark.",PnCzbKofJ-XM8eP4hwM6bA,2,0,1,oavXIuysMcTC2Qa_SN5jXg

5224065,2015-05-19,1,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"As I told my buddy Angeli, my review will be written from a special place.

I have mixed emotions about this place.  You want small businesses to thrive, but you gotta be objective in your thoughts.  So here it goes.

The service was good for the lack of employees that they had.  It was easily noticable that this was a family business and I am happy to support it.   You could really see that the family was working hard and I appreciate it.  

Selection was quite unique.  I wouldn't say it was a good unique, but I would say that it would cater to certain demographics. No, I actually live not that far compared to this place, so I know what I am talking about. Now if that is the angle, go for it and thrive.

The food, when available was between three and four stars.  One thing I noticed was that a lot of their apps and bowls contained a very well-seasoned salad.  However, after several bowls of salad, it got really old.  

Last thing,  I ordered a yellowtail collar well done.  The outer part was crispy, but the inside was pink.  As soon as Angeli pointed it out, I threw it away.  It was kind of off-putting after I told them well done.

I hope this place keeps going, but I really do not think that I will be back.

Four stars for their efforts.",NCF8_lVpX0sHy9p9Cvft4g,3,0,4,-Y3GsfQ3WRTTT8T0G1eTsA

I ordered three items to go, while I was waiting, servers were chatting personal conversation, I felt I was not there.  I asked that how long does it take, they said 15-20 min and gave me a glass of water.

A guy wearing white T-shirts started cooking at sushi bar he was not wearing chef coat nor hat. Then all staff were start talking with fire inspector, it seems they forgot about that I was there for to go order.  

I finally left  there at 11:40.  I was the first customer for the day, there were no other customer until 11:15, I didn't understand why I had to wait so long.  I don't know it was same reasons with me or not, but the send customers for dining party of three, they left the store before they made order.

Sashimi bowl - Sashimi salad with steamed rice, not Chirashi.
Bendo box - They didn't have black cod I ordered.  I got deep fried fish with no sauce.  Menu said it come with miso soup, but they said NO.
Sashimi sampler - No wasabi.  They use bunch of carrot on bottom not daikon.

I couldn't use yelp deal, because of TO GO order. 

I felt that I should share my experience here.",22OBHgW9aANX3vG87A-RSA,3,1,1,Hq9DiunrseL9eRSrgaEq5Q
5392739,2015-05-15,1,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"This was my first visit.   

I have to start with,  if you don't like to eat at an ethnic restaurant run by people who are not of that ethnicity,  this is not for you.  However,  I think as long as you prepare the food correctly and give good service,  it doesn't matter if you are Japanese or Hispanic.  And most of the sushi places in town are run by Koreans if you really want to be that way. ..

So they are offering AYCE at lunch for 14.99 (till 3 pm) and 19.99 for dinner.   Everything on the menu is included except drinks and dessert.  At this price we had to try it. 

Had the salmon,  yellowtail,  jumbo scallop,  and snow crab nigiri.   All were great,  served with their house sauce.  That they had real snow crab and jumbo scallops really impressed me! 

Also had the yellowtail special roll,  tuna sensation,  and popcorn shrimp tempura rolls.  All of these are spicy and the shrimp roll has spicy mayo.  I I liked the flavor of all the rolls,  though hubby didn't like the flavor of the sear on the tuna sensation. 

The chef gave us a complimentary order of spicy tuna with crispy rice.   it came typed with avocado,  jalapeño,  and spicy mayo.   Again the flavor was quite good but the rice was... not very appealing to eat.   Hubby and I didn't like it but people who like baked or fried rolls may enjoy it. 

The decor was a little drab,  it was a little odd that they were playing Hispanic music,  and I thought the restaurant was rather warm.  

But what really matters is that the good was great,  the service on point,  and the price made it well worth it.  

Glad to have this sushi shop on our side of town.   Will definitely go again to try more items!",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,2,2,4,IM5RU8H-tYbSdQLwOGf6lA

5434590,2016-03-30,1,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"This might not be an ideal location for a sushi joint, but if they make enough waves they can do well due to a lack of competition in the vicinity. I actually had a decent lunch at Hello Tokyo on an early Friday afternoon and appreciate the hospitality I received.

A $12 for $25 Groupon brought me to this location right off the 93/95 on Flamingo. There were two other tables in the restaurant with no one at the sushi bar. I wasn't teleported to Japan when I walked in with the plain decor, but I was greeted immediately and had a seat at the 4 seat sushi bar. The chef, who is also the owner I believe, was friendly and engaging throughout my meal.

I ordered about $30 worth of nigiri and hand rolls. The prices for everything seemed reasonable. If you order 4 orders, the fifth is free. They were out of sea bass on that particular afternoon, but the chef informed me he had not received the shipment of his weekly Friday afternoon order. Just as a heads up, he did tell me that he receives orders on Saturday also, so if you're looking for the freshest fish, I would advise coming in on the weekend and not later in the week. I had no problem with the sushi, pretty standard I would say. The rice may have been a tad overcooked, but not inedible by any means. There are also appetizers, a handful of salads, and hot items from the kitchen.

This was an OK experience and I was treated very well by the staff, but they need to do something to set them apart to make them worthy of another trip for me. I can get everything they serve less than 10 minutes from me. A specials board with the freshest catches and unique creations made by the chef, or additions to the hot items on the AYCE menu might assist. I'll be back if I'm in the area and it might be worth it if you are also. I'm rooting for you Hello Tokyo, go get 'em.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,3,2,3,Zzpx-Zo9jt6Fd4csCoy-ng
5466120,2015-10-18,0,3sPSc8NBvrkXi7scpRYDLg,"Not a bad little sushi place.

$19.99 for ""all you can eat"", and the menu was actually pretty expansive in terms of selection.

The staff were friendly, and quick to provide orders.  The place wasn't crowded.  At one point, it was just my little group, and they were very nice, and didn't rush us even as we stayed right up to closing.

They had a little TV, but I could decide if it was for sports games or potential karaoke.  I never had these questions answered during my visit, and didn't think to ask.  I was too busy eating all the sushis to go full deep investigative reporter on the subject.

It's in the little shopping center where Smith's and Cosmic Comics are, so it's a little off to the side and semi-hidden, but there's enough parking.

I'd come back.  The selection was good, and the people were nice.  That goes a long way when you need to eat all the sushis.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,2,1,4,hKNfTW9HFfVMxNrpAgoyvA

I truly appreciate that kind of service.  The man running front of house was great too! He was our server and cashier while running out delivery orders, and doing all jobs excellently.

No flavor whatsoever. Bland. The ginger was pink not the natural color if it was a good sushi restaurant. The crab l was given was so minimal, l couldn't taste it. I got a spider roll. Every other sushi restaurant, it is a very distinctive taste; here there was none.  The man making the sushi was Mexican not Japanese! I just can't get over how bad it was.
