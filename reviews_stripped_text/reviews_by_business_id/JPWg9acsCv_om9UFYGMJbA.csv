124290,2012-01-23,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I recently had the pleasure of going out for a burger with a fellow food blogger who turned me onto several great new locations for burgers and some other good food in town. He suggested we meet up at an off-the-strip location that wasn't anywhere on my radar, and although he's a much more established writer than yours truly, I really wasn't sure if I could trust his judgment as I've been steered in the wrong path quite often in this town. The restaurant was Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, and luckily so far his recommendations are 1 for 1.

Fleming's is located in Summerlin amidst quite a number of stuffy people and restaurants. When I pulled up to the restaurant I noticed that they offered valet, but since I typically hate valeting my car I thought I'd try some of my parking karma. After a long drive around most of the parking lot in the back, I caved and pulled back in front to valet my car. After being through this, I would suggest using their valet service if you ever go; they park right in front of the place and have your car there in seconds.

The burger in question is only served at their bar and not in the main restaurant, and to top it off the burger is half price during happy hour. More on that in a bit. We chose to meet on a Friday night at 6, if you're going to do this prepare for a bit of a crowd. We ended up running into a couple friends I knew so we were able to kind of sneak an extra seat into the bar and sit pretty quickly, but don't necessarily count on this as there were many people hovering until around 8. The bar itself has maybe a dozen or so seats, plus several high top tables of 4 seats each.
They offer a couple choices for the burger, but per my recommendation I went with the Fleming's Prime Burger which comes with cheddar and peppered bacon. And based on some inside info, I was told that the meat is basically the trimmings of their steaks and prime meats that they offer, so this promised to be quite a burger. And it was. The meat had really great flavor, and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare as ordered. It was juicy all the way through, but not too messy. The cheddar was melted thoroughly, and the challah-like bun was soft and delicious. The peppered bacon was mostly crispy, maybe a tiny bit undercooked in a couple spots, but also had really great flavor.

The fries were also a pleasant surprise; after having a series of disappointing French fry experiences lately these were quite good. Maybe some a little undercooked, but really great natural cut fries with good flavor. If I were to have any complaint about them at all it would be that there weren't quite enough, I almost had to watch my intake to make sure I had a bite of French fry to accompany every bite of my burger until the end.

All of this leads up to what is a fantastic price; regularly this is a $12 offering which I think is more than reasonable for what you get, and a total steal when you compare it to other burgers of the same price point like Smashburger, Five Guys or even some more expensive ones on the strip. If you still have any doubt about a $12 burger, the half price option at happy hour should seal the deal. The closest thing you can get to that price is Henry's or In-N-Out, and neither of those is quite comparable even though I'm still a huge fan of the old In-N-Out. So even if you can't make it in for the happy hour price I say this is more than worth it, but for $6 I compel you to find better.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,5,T6TSwezc52RX7ThHCIrqQQ

My husband and I were celebrating our five year anniversary.  We heard nice things about Fleming's and thought we'd give it a try.  We had a 7:00 reservation and arrived a few minutes early so after we checked in we went to the bar for a cocktail.  My husband ordered a martini, and I was looking over the wine list.  I wanted a pinot, and asked the server what her thoughts were.   She shared her thoughts and said if I wanted I could taste a few different Pinot's.  I thought she was suggesting I could order a flight so I did.  I asked to try three different Pinot's.  She poured all three and brought them for me to try side by side.  Yummy and very fun.  In the mean time, the hostess came by and told us   ""there is no hurry at all, but I want to let you know when ever you're ready, your table is available"".  Wonderful...So after tasting each of the pours I ordered my favorite and the hostess seated us. (so nice not to be rushed:)  When we paid the tab for our drinks, the bar tender only charged us for the martini and a glass of wine( not the flight)  very nice!
Once seated, our waitress was just as attentive and knowledgeable and the food was spectacular!!  We had brought a bottle of wine to have with dinner.  They decanted the wine for us and did not charge us a corkage fee.  After dinner they brought us an assortment of chocolate truffles and again wished us a Happy Anniversary.
I'm so happy we celebrated our five year anniversary with Fleming's...it was a wonderful experience!!!",0X280nakv1EflQrguRDV4A,0,0,5,_mCANwPCHpzBmoJqeXOrtA

Made reservations through Yelp for 7:30.  Very slick.  We arrived about 7:00 and they said they would try to accommodate us a bit early.  We said, ""No problem"" and headed for the bar.  Bar service was very good.  They do this first pour of wine into a mini carafe then pour that into a wine glass.  I think this is because their wine glasses are so large it would look like you were being shorted.  This way seemed like extra work but I understand why.

Waitress was outstanding.  She anticipated our needs and timed her appearances very well.  We all had the Sunday night prime rib special.  Felt like this was an outstanding deal which included the prime rib, choice of salad, choice of side and choice of dessert.  I had the Fleming salad and grilled asparagus and the carrot cake for my choices.  My wife had the Fleming salad, Fleming potatoes (sort of an au gratin potato kicked up) and the lava cake.  We shared liberally.  Not a sour note to be found.  Service was top notch.

We ordered a large bottle of sparkling water. We were presented with two small bottles, as the large bottle was unavailable. The tumblers were also 'crusty' (again, not entirely clean). I ordered a petite filet with Bernaise sauce. I did not get Bernaise sauce. I was given a very vinegary tasting BBQ sauce. I didn't bother to point it out, as our server Aaron seemed intent on passing that off as something other than BBQ sauce and probably thought we didn't know the difference.  We ordered creme brûlée for dessert. I asked for an espresso. Aaron comes back and tells us espresso/cappuccino machine is down for the night. I was done. Forget dessert. Just please bring the check. If you are open until 8:00 but seat as late as 7:30, everything should be available until that last top is presented a check! Guests should not be aware of kitchen staff loudly shutting down as they are eating.

Server makes it over to the table and takes our drink order and then she's gone for a good while.  No one comes to the table with bread or water.  Drinks finally come and we place our order.  

Cajun shrimp appetizer, peppercorn strip steak for him, filet for her, creamed spinach to share.  Shrimp comes out.  It's nothing special. Average sized shrimp a little over cooked.  Still no bread.  

Finally ask the bus person for bread.  A few minutes later the bread comes out. It had been in the oven too long and was crunchy on the outside. Not very tasty.

Entrees come out next.  Creamed spinach and the steaks, one of which they forgot to cook.  I kid you not, it was nearly raw.  Both steaks are served on a white plate with not so much as a piece of parsley on the plate. Terrible presentation.

The strip steak is a little undercooked and virtually devoid of any seasoning. It's supposed to be the peppercorn crusted version.  Someone forgot that part. 

We sent the steak back and said forget that and split the steak.  The creamed spinach was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Overall, pretty awful night out.  This place is pricy with everything a la carte.  The steaks were mediocre at best.  Not somewhere I'd go back to in the future. Can't figure out how you run a steak house and can't cook a steak with proper seasoning or temperature.  Pretty disappointing experience",zUftxbDN37tL_ghulwdwFA,0,0,1,qEk164v2YlbRwlHhFzQh3g

It was kind of like eating waffles with some fruit jam.  It was salty, sweet and crunchy.  For $20, it's worth it to try it at least once.  

For the main course,  I had the chef's special tonight, a petite fillet Mignon with pan seared scallops and grilled asparagus.  The fillet Mignon pan seared and topped with goat cheese.  The fillet was cooked perfectly and it was so tender.  I didn't feel that the goat cheese matched very well with the fillet.  However, my scallops were perfect.  It was cooked perfectly and I can taste the subtle hint of sweetness from the scallops.  Completely yummie.

My hubby had the rib eye steak and he totally inhaled it.  I had one bite and it was delicious.  

For the sides, we had the Fleming's potatoes.  These were very good.  They're scallop potatoes.  These creamy cheesy potatoes were the best scallop potatoes I've ever had.  Also, we ordered the green beans with mushrooms.  They tasted okay.  It was nothing special and I probably wouldn't order this side again.  The next time I go and there will certainly be a next time, I want the cream of spinach.  I've heard so much about them.  Overall, the meal was excellent.  The total was about $130 without drinks.  -M2",MGRNCiPHnzBhcDULy8OSuQ,2,0,4,juzvK1TUILsu4H03nTrQIQ

We came on a Sunday so I had their Prime Rib Special which included the Prime rib, salad, a side of your choice, and desert.  It was very very very good (can I say very one more time).  I will go as far as to say that I actually think the Prime Rib at Fleming's is better than House of Prime Rib in S.F.  The Prime Rib was very juicy, moist, full of flavor.  I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly.

My boyfriend had the Rib Eye steak and that was also very good.  Unlike Ruth's Chris where they drenched their steak in butter (which I love, but my boyfriend doesn't), Fleming's steak is seasoned with salt and pepper and that's all the steak really needed, you can taste the quality of the meat, it had a lot of flavor.  

My boyfriend's sister ordered the Filet Mignon.  She cut a piece and ate it and thought it tasted tough.  She asked me to try a piece and I also thought the meat tasted hard and chewy.  Our server came and she asked him if the plate she had was the filet mignon and he said yes and can tell that she was not happy with her steak so he said he will get another order for her with out her even asking him.  10 minutes later the manager came over to her and said sorry and told her that he will take care of the problem for her.  

So when her new piece of filet mignon came out, I can see the manager looking towards our table and I can see that there were a couple of people behind him also looking at our table (some people might find this annoying, but I think it shows that they care and want to see our reactions to see if we happy with the food or not).  We all tried her steak and the second piece that came out was outstanding.  After 5 minutes, the manager came up to my boyfriend's sister again and asked her how the steak was and of course she said it was perfect.  

Our sever and his team were all very nice and provided great customer service.  The decor was very classy looking and the ambiance is very romantic if you are trying to bring a date here.

I will definitely come back to Fleming's in Vegas.",awbqekh442D5LeKVm48KtQ,0,0,5,lrZRRgIjDG3BAeJcfvW0vw

This was going to be one of the highlights of our Vegas holiday, A special meal to celebrate my wifes 50th Birthday. When i stopped by a few days before to make the booking, the manager I saw could not have been more helpful and welcoming. If he had been working on the night we actually had our Dinner, I am sure that our experience would have been better.
When we arrived we were given no particularly warm welcome by the female maitre'D and seated at a really crappy position table, just by the entrance to the waiters station so that I was constantly being brushed past by the waiting staff.
Our waiter was competent but again not very welcoming. Our Starters were good (but then it's pretty hard to screw-up a Lettuce Wedge). Our Steaks were really disappointing. Both of us ordered filet Mignon, both came over-done. Mine was so over-seasoned that I had to send it back. 
When I went to the bathroom, I asked the Maitre'D if there was a note mentioning the special nature of the evening?. She confirmed that the manager taking the booking had put a note mentioning my wife's 50th birthday. I asked if she felt that our treatment had been in any way special and she admitted it hadn't. The Manger came and apologised and offered us a complimentary Dessert but, as we are both diabetic and couldn't accept, it didn't really make up for the overall poor service.
If the food had been cooked properly or the Service excellent I would be prepared to re-visit and give them another chance, but getting both things wrong means that I will not be back.",x6dEWnnRf2paBjR7a1ULHA,0,0,1,PTbPz-1u0mnL9wUQvvWjLw

We requested a quieter table, so she then tried to put us directly next to a large party, though numerous other tables were empty.  Server was cordial, but heavily accented English made him difficult to understand. Ordered the $99 for two special. Was supposed to be 28 oz porterhouse (rather grizzly), roasted cauliflower (burnt), carrots (one each of the smallest baby carrots I've ever seen; they should have been called premie carrots) and potatoes (very burnt). They were out of the suggested wine, and the server brought over a container (no bottle with a label, though it was about $15 a glass), poured a bit to taste, then walked away! Had to pour my own glass! Had plenty of room for dessert (and we are not heavy eaters) but opted not to, and to cut our losses.

This food was top notch. The steak I got was one of the best I've ever eaten in my life. I'm big on condiments so I was drawn to their F-17 sauce.

1034126,2015-02-01,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"Location, it was odd, a strip mall parking lot isn't where you'd expect to eat a $50 steak.  Making things even odder, a valet occupied all of the restaurant specific parking.  Honestly. This building could have been an Applebee's 6 months ago and now there is a valet?

Ambience, they had the classic stake house lighting levels, but as a whole it came off lacking charm.

We gave service an 8/10, though perhaps we are spoiled when it comes to set menus (we ordered the three course winter menu).  We waited approx 5 minutes between courses, which is not how it's done.   Instead of timing, they relied on a bottomless bread service to curb our hunger as we waited for the next course. 

Our scores of the food are as follows: 

Bread and spread 8.5/10
Butter squash ravioli 4.5/10
Blood orange sangria 6/10
Salad 3/10
Porcini filet (broiled 9/10, pan seared 6.5/10). Oddly enough, the pan seared filet was dry and less flavorful than the broiled fillet.

1059415,2014-08-25,1,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"In the interest of full disclosure, I will state that this review is based on a visit my wife and I took to this location in May of this year (anniversary dinner), and some details might be a bit fuzzy in my mind at three months' remove.

Between trips in and out of the area with my wife's best friend and me, my darling girl had seen this place many times and wanted to try it.  So ... anniversary time comes around, and instead of our usual trip to Austin's at the Texas, we went here.  Let's take this one piece at a time.

1) Entry.  Upon entering and being seated, we were overwhelmed - and not in a good way - by the NOISE from the adjacent bar.  As a fellow who has worked culinary on and off during his work-force years, it was always impressed upon me that ""fine dining"" carried an atmosphere as well as a food quality.  Not a good start to our evening.
2) Service.  Highest point of the evening.  Service was excellent.  Perhaps this night could be salvaged.
3) Food.  My wife enjoyed her wedge salad.  At this remove, I can't remember what I had for an appetizer ... which means it wasn't outstanding in any way.  We both had the rib-eye, as this is our favorite cut of steak.  Again, I point out that I have been cooking professionally on-and-off for about fifteen years.  I was always taught that herbs and spices should be a subtle caress to the palate, not a solid right cross to the jaw.  Way too heavy-handed.  (And, yes, I know that's the ""fashion trend"" these days.)  I will admit that the steaks were cooked to perfection; the guy at the grill did indeed know what ""medium rare"" really means.  Side dishes were adequate.  Whatever it was that my wife ordered for dessert was pleasing to her; as a diabetic, I passed on that.  All in all, way too expensive for a sports bar, and way too crazy for a REAL steak house.

So ... If these folks ever decide to cure their schizophrenia and determine whether they want to be the ""Cheers"" neighborhood sports bar or a true fine-dining establishment ... if they ever discover that the key to a pleasing menu is subtlety without trying to compete with the ""trendy"" places that add herbs, spices, twigs, nuts, bolts, screws, bells, lights, whistles and gongs just because someone found bottles of something at Smart and Final ... if they ever shed themselves of the culinary curiosities of architecture over tradition ... I may just return.  But someone will have to tell me, because we will not be back voluntarily.  I love my wife and my taste buds too much to subject them to this again.

When we go out to eat, we like to sit at the bar if at all possible because we enjoy the constant attention and rapport that a good bar staff should provide.  Amber and Brennan both excelled at personality, attentiveness, fun and knowledge of their products.  
We thoroughly enjoyed playing with the Ipad wine list that allows you to choose from over 200 wines with full descriptions and vintner's notes.  A fun 'spin the bottle' option allows a random selection of wine.  Other awesome feature's include selections from the director of wine and paring suggestions for each course.

As for the ale, It's a great, hoppy beer from New York. I really enjoyed the flavor from the hops. As soon as I got seated, I moved on to a beautiful Caesar Salad with fried capers. I know it sounds weird, but trust me, it was delicious. It was a bit delayed, but they brought us fresh bread with two different Arizona butters that they make in house. Both were delightful. The only thing that would have made it better would have been if I got the bread prior to my salad course.

As for my main entree, I went for the bone in rib eye. The flavor was out of this world. I asked for rare, and that was exactly what I got. At that point, I was ready for another beer. I was delighted to see the Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA. Such a treat if you like IPA's and hoppy beers.

The only thing that I would recommend, is getting an accompaniment of cabernet butter to go with your steak. As for sides, the best way to go is with the creamed spinach and the blue cheese infused mashed potatoes. 

Overall, the dining experience was a 3.5/5 due to some timing issues. As for the food, I would give it a solid 4.5/5",T102YnzI9pGgi6_SeVUqCw,1,1,4,MX4dOeY9VzTAQijOUho8ow

1379142,2012-08-22,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"We just had our 25th wedding anniversary and celebrated with a great meal at Flemings. An associate of my wife's had given us a $100 gift card and we had saved it for this occasion.

We had heard wonderful things about Flemings and were not disappointed. From the hostess, to the server, to the manager, all were exceptional.  We were treated as very special guests. They were not stuffy or ""prim and proper"" It was like having a meal with new friends whose only concern was that we had a great dinner.... and we certainly did.

Our server's name was Bill and he was excellent. Charming, friendly, and oh so perfect. We had been looking forward to the dinner and knew from the website what we wanted. We started on the bread and split a glass of the Sangria, and ordered a nice hearty Tobin James Zinfadel, which at $40 a bottle was very reasonably priced. We started with the appetizers. I went with the ""Wicked Cajun"" shrimp and Christiné had the Carpaccio.  Both were very tasty. 

For the main course I had the New York steak with a Lobster tail add-on with big delicious onion rings and a pile of fine delicate, shoestring french fries and Christiné had what turned out to be 2 (two) Lobster tails with the creamed spinach.  (obviously we were not watching calories on this night!)

Christiné could not rave enough about the Lobster... but felt the spinach was a bit too creamy...luxuriously so... but we prefer a little more vegetable and less cream.

My steak was beautiful.  Melt in your mouth tasty, with only a little salt and pepper. I haven't had lobster in ages and enjoyed that as well. I hadn't ordered french fries in over a year and onion rings longer than that...and I must say these were among the best ever.

I was on a roll. I wanted a dessert too! I ordered the 3 layer carrot cake and a coffee and Christiné wanted a Grappa, (which they didn't have) but settled for a nice cognac. The Sangria and Zinfandel had already given us a very nice buzz...but I was driving so I went with the coffee.

The cake was about 66% super sweet, creamy frosting and 34% heavy, rich, and tasty cake.  Just about the opposite percentages of what I prefer, and it was huge, obviously meant for sharing! It also came with bowl of fresh whipping cream! Definitely a calorie BOMB!  I scraped off a lot of frosting and I actually needed the whipped cream, and sips of the good black coffee to cut the sweetness... but once I got the mix down... it was really good! 

This was one of the best meals I have ever had, and certainly the most expensive that we have had in our 27 years together. By the time we added in the tip (25% for exceptional service!) we added another $230 to the $100 card - but without regrets. It was a great meal and very nice way to celebrate 25 years of marriage.

BTW... I did not eat all my steak and Christiné had a half lobster tail left, which they boxed up for us. They made for a great lunch addition two days later.  They also gave us a little box of 4 truffles as anniversary gift when we left, and a follow up thank you email.  This place is a class act.  We will go back!

I am inclined to post a review based on our most recent dining experience on Mother's Day evening for dinner. We had a reservation, but when we arrived there was a ton of people waiting outside. We spoke to the hostess and I guess Mother's Day dinner is their most popular evening (most likely due to all the moms getting a break for once!). We ended up having to wait around 15-20 minutes passed our reservation time. I usually get frustrated by this, but I was impressed that half-way through our meal a manager came to our table and gave us a $25 gift card per person to use at a later date. We never complained about the reservation being untimely either.

1403830,2012-01-30,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"This is your classic American steak house with your classic american menu choices.
This is also your classic amazing tasting steak!
We celebrated a birthday dinner here and was not disappointed.
First the price... of course it's a little on the expensive side, this isn't your outback steak house Friday night steak outings,  this is good ol' american culinary classic steak house.   So no surprise seeing $30-$50 cuts of beef on the menu with $10 side choices.
Bread was fresh with two choices of butter ( can't remember what they were infused with but i remember both being delicious, sorry!)
We started with calamari (rhode island style with hot peppers and topped with a sweet chill sauce).  This didn't blow me away, in fact i wish the sweet chili sauce was on the side as it made the calamari a little soggy (maybe if you order this try asking for it on the side). 
Wine list was satisfactory, we went with a Red. Parducci Syrah, not too dry and a delicious paring for red meat!

STEAK:
Ordered the prime ribeye (my fav cut) cooked to medium temp. Perfectly cooked with juices flowing as i cut into my steak.  Seasoned well with a nice char on the outside, perfectly pink in the middle and a little fat on the cut was just what i needed. 
The girlfriend ordered the Filet mignon which was also cooked to her liking and was tender beyond a Katherine Heigl rom-com!
You can choose to order 4 different complimentary sauces on the side ( we tried the bernaise and peppercorn with the latter being my preferred choice)although a good steak doesn't need sauce, sometimes i like a little variety. 

SIDES:
Ordered the Flemings potatoes (scalloped potatoes topped with cream, jalapenos and cheddar). Don't fear the jalapenos, they weren't spicy at all and just added a nice little kick to the potatoes. I recommend this as a side!
We also ordered roasted mushrooms. It was a perfect blend of button and portobello  mushrooms with some fresh garlic cloves that perfectly complimented the steak. (why was the mushroom invited to the party? Because he was fun-gi! harhar)

We were too full for desert (and maybe a little tipsy from the bottle of wine..a little) but would like to try the lava cake on our next visit.

SERVICE:
Well above average.  After checking in with the host, we were promptly escorted to our table preceded by a ""welcome mr. surname"". When our server approached us, he stated ""so who's birthday our we celebrating?"" I totally forgot when i made the reservation online, there was a drop down box with special events and i had selected birthday. Nice little touch from Flemings. We were waited upon by at least 3 different servers who were ALL Friendly and made nice little quips of conversations most ending with laughter. A supervisor also checked in with us post meal to ask how everything was that evening.  The service definitely had me bringing up the tip percentage (maybe the wine helped too) to well above standards.

Overall a memorable birthday dinner.  Food was delicious. Service was excellent. Ambiance was what we expected (not romantic per se but still classy ). We would definitely be coming back (maybe on prime rib sundays for $29.99..say whaaaa?!)

I still like Lawrys/Mortons/Smith & Wollensky but Flemings is a great choice for STEAK NIGHT!",-QmmHtp57b3zT79APvRONA,0,0,5,-W8twFRV9_WQ0I_kY2xF-g

Flemings is our go to place every Christmas Eve.  We absolutely LOVE the food and service at Flemings!  We always make a reservation, as they do get very busy especially on holidays.  We are generally seated within 10 minutes, or less of our reserved table time.  

Once seated, we are welcomed by a server who regardless of how busy they are, always gives us the attention we expect... not too pesty and not aloof.  The reason for the four star is that this past Christmas Eve, the service was more on the aloof end... we waited far too long for simple requests, like sugar for the coffee, a clean fork, etc... so much that we had to remind our server!  The food however was AMAZING!  I generally order the filet, which melts in your mouth, however this time I ordered the chicken breasts and they were delightful!  Full of flavor!

Tough, chewy, tasteless lobster tail for $55. Highway robbery.
Maybe 10 asparagus with the dry stalks still attached to the ends, $13. 
One dangerously weak whiskey drink, the Emerald Isle, whose price I thankfully cannot find. 

Here's the redemption: 
one plate of the Boneless Braised Short Ribs (with truffle-parsley mashed potatoes, natural au jus, horseradish-cream sauce). I can't find the price, and I don't care, because this was the only saving grace of the evening as far as I was concerned. My dining buddy was too emotional from an event before and probably too drunk to care much. These were quite possibly the best ribs I've tasted ever, certainly within recent memory. 

The problem(s): 
the cost; the frantic, distracted, absent, and--at the end--somewhat pushy waiter (DESSERT! from a woefully uninspiring selection); and an overall culinary experience not far removed from the expectations of a typical Strip buffet all made for one lackluster meal that we had been looking forward to for months. If not for the ribs, the cost vis-a-vis the unappealing textures and fleeting tastes would have made this a 2-star experience. Despite each of us using $25 gift cards, I had a hard time justifying the cost for this meal even at such a reduced dollar amount. 

The grand total for this was about $110, or $177 total with the two shots of tequila añejo my friend ordered. Those shots? Superb. Too bad they didn't bring the bottle out to show us what was being served at $30 per shot, and that those shots had nothing to do with the restaurant quality itself.

I'd not come back here for anything other than those ribs, and even for those I'd only go if someone else were paying and taking on the risk of failure. If you want a better steakhouse experience for less cost in Las Vegas, you won't have to look far to find it.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,5,3,3,Fe3Qzy524HOVXUezDaxarQ

Sweet Chili Calamari.  Love this different take on traditional calamari with  marinara sauce.  Its breaded and covered in sweet chili sauce that resembles thai sweet chili sauce.

Carpaccio.  Tasted great with the small pieces of toasted bread

Roasted Mushroom Ravioli.  This was my least favorite dish only because I am not a huge ravioli fan in general.  My wife liked he dish very much.  Creamy.

The $6 bacon burger.  Very tasty but a little bit on the salty side.

I got an invitation from a friend of mine to try this place and though a bit skeptical, I accepted.

We had a reservation and this is the only reason I'm taking away a star. When we arrived for our 7:30 reservation time, we had to wait nearly 10 minutes to be seated. Somehow, I was under the impression that a reservation meant you got a seat,,, immediately. Oh well.

They seated us in what I thought was the best seat in the house, a round corner booth that was tucked nicely away from the rest of the crowd. The place was a bit noisy and this space lent iteself nicely to avoiding that.

Stellar performance by our server. He didn't miss the mark even once and he got a nice chunk of change for that one. Great wine selection too.

My salmon was cooked to perfection. I could have left the Teriyaki glaze behind though, since it's too much sugar in a meal that already left me feeling a bit more full than I like.

!!Cocktails!!

Tropical Martini
 - Made with Malibu coconut rum this cocktail is a perfect summer drink. Tastes of malibu with pineapple and something else. Light on the boozie taste, on the sweet side and fruity. Even if it sounds like a girl drink i'll still order one after another.

Blood Orange Fizz
 - Not something i'd order again in my own opinion. Tasted like grapefruit where you have a mix of sour and citrus bitter. It's how the drink is suppose to taste, i guess i just don't go with it. Also confused about the Fizz bit as there was no fizz.

!!Apps!!

Roasted Mushroom Ravioli
- Completely agree with Anthony M who gave me his last Ravioli (comes in 3s). The sauce is just amazing. I mean WOW that sauce was good. if there were bread offered at the bar during happy hour i would have grabbed some and soaked up some of that sauce. Ravioli itself paired very nicely with the sauce. The thing that impressed me the most was the large coarse chunks of mushrooms in the ravioli. My expectation of ravioli is usually pasta on the outside with some kind of fancy named mixed mush on the inside. Not these bad boys.

Tenderloin Carpaccio 
- The tenderloin was just so damn tender to the point where it just melts in your mouth. This carpaccio is styled a bit differently then i'm used to. The topping was a basil and red onion with capers...umm...salad i guess with what tasted like a mustard based aioli. The Carpaccios i'm used to usually have a garlic aioli and some sort of spring salad on top with some kind of shredded cheese. This one was also served with slices of garlic bread with some melted cheese on top. Another head scratchier was cheese like garnish on top of the basil. We all thought it was cheese but it turned out to be hard boiled egg. Live and learn eh?

All three of us got the Sunday Prime Rib dinner for 29.99. I agree with others out there who expressed the feeling of robbing this fine establishment of a three course meal.

I was expecting a fixed dessert seeing as I just got an amazing deal on the main course. No...let me say that again NO you can have ANY dessert on the menu! We got chocolate lava cakes served with ice cream!

The servers who took care of us were Rory and Scott both of which worked so hard and so quietly to take care of our every need. We even requested a table set up change and an entire team of people jumped straight to work to bring our vision to life. We never had an empty glass or were left waiting for the next course because Rory and Scott were on top of it. Their recommendations from the wine to the entrees were extremely helpful for our guests. We were impressed by David's service skills when he brought out many plates in such a classy manner!  I can still taste the delicious dinner which the cooks worked so hard on. We truly enjoyed our annual holiday party thanks to the great team work here at the Charleston Location.

This is the first time my family (as long as I've been around) hasn't stayed home for thanksgiving. We decided to go to Flemings since they happened to be having a special thanksgiving dinner. Let's start off by saying: I am more then satisfied. This is one of the best thanksgiving meals I've ever had. 
We start off by having your drinks-- I highly recommend the elderflower fizz for anyone who doesn't drink alcohol. 
Next, the salad was amazing. The combination of the cherry tomatoes, the nuts, the cranberries, and the lemon vinaigrette. It was a beautiful explosion of flavor in my mouth and that was only the appetizer. 
When we got dinner, it. Was. Amazing. We all ordered the thanksgiving dinner. You see, no one in our group was particularly fond of turkey, but my god was that an exception. It was moist and delicious-- it almost felt wrong eating it, that's how good it was. The green beans were crisp and flavorful, the cranberry sauce tart and not too sweet. The mashed potatoes were supposed to be sweet potatoes and were more like regular potatoes than anything. Still good though. And that stuffing! My god it was so good. I almost cried. Not really. But almost. 
Here's the reason my review is lacking 1 star: 
The service was odd. They seemed to have...overbooked and understaffed for this night. We made reservations almost a month in advance yet we had to wait almost half an hour. Then after dinner there was more waiting-- this time for dessert and the check. Also about half an hour of waiting. 
But overall it was an amazing experience and I'd love to go back again! Thank you to our wonderful server, Jessica Kelly. (Such a sweetheart.)

The interior is lovely and dark, as befits a steakhouse.  We thought the tables were closer to each other than necessary; the overall effect was less intimate and more crowded.  Hmm.

Hostess was pleasant and perky as she guided us to a booth (yay!).  Our actual server was a little on the reserved side and could not be blamed for being overly solicitous at all.  (Someone else came to inquire how we liked our food.)

Yes, the food.  We each got a salad (Fleming's Salad and the Wedge Salad), and enjoyed them both very much.  I ordered the BBQ Scottish Salmon Fillet -- yeah, I know I said I was excited to eat a steak, but I also really really like salmon! -- and hubby got the NY Strip steak with a side of asparagus.  Both entrées were very good and proved that the kitchen knows what they're doing.  Sadly, we were both too stuffed for dessert.

My criticisms: the service.  I'm sure that many folks who have visited Fleming's have received excellent service and that's fantastic.  I'm just a little disappointed that our server was basically just doing her job: serving the food.  We mentioned right away that it was our first visit -- a tip for introducing house specials or suggesting wine pairings or just chatting about how awesome the food is -- but nada.  She seemed most animated when she brought us our bill.  (The gent who cleared our dishes after each course was smiley and happy, though!)

So, the thing I most remember about my first visit to Fleming's is the food, which is probably a good thing.  However, I had expected more skill and enthusiasm from our server, especially when I was paying a pretty penny for dinner.",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,2,0,4,OpBv4pu7S-lTQV_7FkHVvA

My fiancèe and I had decided for a dinner at Fleming's on the day of their ""special Prime Rib soirèe. It was not our first time at Fleming's and we easily drive the ten miles from our hotel to this west side location. 
We were met at our table by a nice looking waitress, whose beautiful smile seemed to be able to turn on and off quite easily. We ordered a drink, two glasses of wine and asked for the prime rib dinner. Our choice of salad arrived, and the Caesar's was smothered in garlic...I thought for a moment I was in one of those ""italian"" american restaurant where garlic seems to be everywhere (But you still think italians go around smelling of garlic? Come on, your are lost in a time warp).
The entrees arrived after some waiting. ""Is this prime rib?"" I asked. ""No"", answered miss cold smile, ""It clearly isn't. Just we finished prime rib, so we broght you a steak"". Ah...
Then she said something about this being a bargain for us, getting the steak at the same special price of prime rib special...WOW...I fly from Roma to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year for business and leisure and we gladly spend some money in this wonderful city, indulging in shows, shopping and fine dining...Saving 10 bucks and not having what we liked was NOT a bargain.
The steak was good, however literally covered in black pepper. But why? With such decent meet you do not need to go over the top with unhealthy dressing. It took some time to brush the pepper off the steak, by then it was cold.
We had an excellent crème brulè at the end.

I ordered the petite filet and my fiancé orders the most expensive steak on the menu. Both were flavorless. I am not one to complain (especially on my birthday/Valentine's Day) so I ate about half the steak. The very nice waitress could tell I wasn't loving it and offered to get me a new steak. I declined simply because I felt it would be replaced with the same quality steak. The manager comped my meal which was very nice. BUT this morning I woke up with a very unhappy stomach. 

I will not be returning. I appreciate the service but the quality did not match up with the price point.",1yWhJjLGiWblGyIO0Fch7w,0,0,3,UccYkvya43LvlS4Fcjzckg

We ordered the Chopped Salad, which I recommend, and the Mozzarella and Sweet Tomato salad, which was a little too sweet (though I'd clearly been warned).  The Filet was excellent, the lamb chops were okay.  The Fleming's potatoes were just potatoes au gratin with jalapenos, which I couldn't taste.  Kinda meh.

If you are having a bad day and don't feel like being at work, but work with the general public you should probably not come to work. Or at the very least check your troubles at the door. 


That being said, my first experience at Flemings was terrible! Aside from the food being mediocre (Mastros is much better) Our server seemed extremely bothered when he was asked questions about the menu. After bringing out the wrong drink, and wrong side times. We thought we were in the clear. That was until the bill came. We split the bill by seat using two cards and $120 cash. Our server took it upon himself to charge majority of the bill to one card ($145) put another portion of the bill on another card ($50), use $60 of the $120 cash towards the bill and pocketed the rest as a tip! Had we not of looked over the bill before leaving he would've received a $170 (we were already planning to tip $60 on top of the $50 tip he had already received.) tip and one person would've wound up paying for 4 other people's meals. When we pointed out that the check was wrong he proceed to throw money on the table and tell us he didn't care & walked away.

I haven't been in years but I used to think of Flemings as a more upscale steakhouse but after last nights dinner I feel like it's a common steakhouse with expensive price tags. 
The good: filet mignon was tender and delicious. The Flemings potatoes and creamed corn were so delicious but super salty. The desserts were yummy. 
The blah: the lobster was very fishy tasting   The Flemings salad was a messy plate of lettuce with sloppy toppings thrown on top. I felt like someone made this salad off a salad bar with an odd ratio of tomatoes and other toppings to the lettuce. 
The shrimp appetizer was super disappointing. I thought the shrimp were flavorless. 
The bread was a loaf of boring bread that was a little overtoasted and stale. 
Service was fine; no complaints but nothing stood out. 
With so many other fine dining options in Summerlin, I can't think of a reason why I would come back to Flemings.",5owNSGo6RELDdzBTxCFaxQ,0,0,3,kd9Fr0POXlALvOijb81-NA

2395734,2015-10-22,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I really think there is this phenomenon where when someone pays exorbitant prices for something, that they automatically think it's better than something less expensive. Dyson vacuums are an example. Mine seriously doesn't clean any better than my $80 Bissell, but people SWEAR by these things either to make themselves feel better for spending $500 on a vacuum or because they just think that it must be better because of the price. It's like a consumers placebo effect. I think Fleming's falls into this category for sure.

My parents wanted to go out for their anniversary and my dad chose this place because someone had recommended it to him. My mom called and made reservations and told them it was for an anniversary. When we arrived we were greeted  promptly and seated immediately which was nice. The first thing I noticed was a stench of sewage. The bar was under construction so maybe it had something to do with that. Since my parents had chosen the place I didn't want to say anything, but had it not been for that, the smell would have made me walk out immediately. After we had sat down, both of my parents mentioned the smell also. The hostess wished my parents a happy anniversary and presented them with an anniversary card. The waiter came over and things started off pretty well with him. He seemed quick and attentive. My dad ordered a calamari appetizer which was moist and mushy. My dad ate most of it, but I couldn't stomach it. 

My dad and I both decided on the filet mignon while my mom chose the salmon. The prices here are HIGH- which wouldn't be so bad if you were getting a lot of quality or even some quantity but I found that neither was really there. Our entrees averaged over $50 and did not include anything other than the meat- no veggie or even a sprig of parsley. I wanted a baked potato with my meal and a baked potato side cost $10.50! Seriously?! A 10 cent potato for $10.50?! I went ahead and ordered it because I couldn't imagine having just a slab of meat with nothing else. The $10 potato tasted like it was baked yesterday and then microwaved or re-warmed today. The filet was cooked nicely although lacked much in the way of flavor. I tried one of the sauces that went with it and it was sickly sweet and pretty nasty. Our service went downhill considerably once the food was placed on our table. Our server stopped by about 2 minutes after the food was put down and then we never saw him again. We finished our meal, a busser brought my dad a box for his leftovers and we waited for the server to come back with the check. And we waited......and waited.....and we waited some more. He never came. Eventually my dad grew impatient and wanted to leave so we went to the hostess station to get the bill. Even she couldn't find our server. There were no anniversary extras like some other reviews got- no dessert or anything like that. Not even a ""see ya"" from our waiter.

For comparisons sake, my preferred restaurant for tonight would have been Kona Grill, not too far from here. Usually when I go there I order the filet. The filet at Kona is the same size as the one I got here and tastes virtually the same. The only difference I would say is that Fleming's maybe has more of seared taste which in my opinion is neither good or bad. I could take it or leave it. At Kona your filet comes with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie side and is topped with sauteed mushrooms. It costs $29. I usually order some California rolls as an appetizer for $6.95. For the same price as one piece of meat here at Fleming's I could have gotten the filet MEAL (not just a piece of meat) and THREE orders of California rolls at Kona- and there would be virtually no difference in quality. 

Lastly, the atmosphere here is more reminiscent to the ""fancy"" restaurants of the late 80's or early 90's. It's really loud, really dark, and not very appealing. Aside from the smell of sewage which also smelled like they were trying to cover it with the smell of patchouli oil, the hostess kept walking back and forth by the food line hacking her head off like a tuberculosis patient. The crowd in the restaurant was mostly 70+ . There were a lot of oxygen tanks, walkers, and canes in there. Definitely not a spot for someone younger. I think aside from the staff I was probably the youngest person in there at 33.",aPXpM_OsjPiQLnCEsawMoQ,0,0,2,aidp9WhS9dHU0rADIYCRjQ

The atmosphere is easily that of a first date or an anniversary date.  The service was top notch and very friendly.  Now onto the food and drink!

I ordered the beef medallion dinner special, which came with a salad and dessert for around $40.  Great price, that much is for sure.  The salad was really nice.  Fresh spinach with a very flavorful vinaigrette that I just couldn't get enough of.  It tasted like it was sauteed in mushrooms or something.  The medallions were good, but overly cooked (I ordered medium rare), and a bit dry.  I suppose this cut of meat tends to be dry, but it just was a little bit of a let down.  I tasted my friend's rib eye (medium rare), and it was perfect.  It melted in my mouth, and was delicious!  I only wish my medallions were as good.  The dessert was nice as well.  I went with a bread pudding.  As far as bread puddings go, it was tasty, but nothing mind blowing.  Overall for food, I give this place 4 stars.

Why for the three stars?  Well, the wine list is pretty extensive.  Three or four pages on the menu make up the wine list.  That is great and everything, but the restaurant's website and menu also advertises that it has ""craft beer and local beer.""  I was really looking forward to a good IPA with my steak.  Let me tell you what ""craft beer"" means to Fleming's because they didn't have any local beer, and the waitress made it sound like they won't in the future.  They offer Redhook IPA, Boston Lager, Widmer's crappy Hef, and Bluemoon.  Really?  This is blatant false advertising as far as I am concerned.  The owners/managers need to take a trip to Stone Brewery and learn what craft beer is.  If that is too foreign of a market, take a trip over to Yard House at least!

I was planning on taking my Father out to dinner at Wicked Spoon for Father's Day, but by the time he got off work that place would be closed. Since I took off work, I thought Fleming's would be the next best thing to try without worrying about the time. I took the last reservation at 9p.m. & we were promptly seated upon arrival. The hostess was welcoming, asked how I'm doing and how my day was, which was a pleasant to hear. She also informed me who's my server & wished us both to have a nice dinner & actually wished my Father.. & Happy Father's Day to you sir. My Father lit up & said.. Thank you thank you. That sure brought a smile on his face and to witness that.. brought a smile to mine. Great job to this hostess!!!

It took a few moments for our server, Sarah to greet us & by that time, we were already ready to order. We, both decided to get their Prime Rib Dinner. It comes with a choice of salad, one side, & one dessert. Like Father, like Daughter.. we ordered everything the same... 

Fleming's Salad - Not spectacular or anything to rave about. There were too much sliced purple onions, which I had to put aside. The dried cranberries, croutons, & tomatoes were just okay. Extremely simple & looked cheap. The candied walnuts were overly covered with rock hard caramel, that I warned my Father to watch out in consuming it. You could literally hear me crack the candied part in my mouth & it wasn't a good feeling against my teeth. The best part... the dressing was tangy & fresh. The presentation itself wasn't appealing at all. 

Baked Potato (Fully Loaded) - As the side we chose... It was the Best in our entire meal. My Father noted that it was his first time ever seeing such an enormous size potato & all its fixins. It came exactly in this order of toppings on the baked potato.. sour cream, butter, green onions, bacon & cheddar cheese as being a happy surprise in the very end as you dig inside. We enjoyed this Very much & it was one of the most flavorful fully loaded baked potato I ever tasted. Each bite I couldn't believe how delicious it was. Every topping complimented one another & it was like a joy ride of warm gooey goodness in its highest form. I can't tell you enough how much I love this side.. If I can give 5 stars alone to one food item I tasted here... this would definitely be it. Even my Father goes.. this Prime Rib isn't the best, but... this Baked Potato is!

Prime Rib - It comes with three sauces on the side, which consists of spicy mustard, horseradish, & au jus. I felt the au jus was too heavy in flavor & one bite with this sauce was overpowering the natural flavors of the meat. I did enjoy mixing the spicy mustard, which wasn't spicy at all, where you get any heat.. with the horseradish sauce, which was also very light like sour cream taste to it. The combination of these two sauces went great with the Prime Rib. I ordered mine Medium & it was cooked perfectly. My favorite part, the dark ends were in depth with flavor & I loved the tenderness of the meat. Overall, I thought this was an excellent entree. I would definitely order this again.

Dessert time! You have to order their signature sweet.. Chocolate Lava Cake. We both learned the hard way.. you can easily be completely full & satisfied with one order.. easy. It comes with a thin cookie-like holder with two generous scoops of vanilla ice cream inside & topped with chopped pistachio nuts. Next to it, is the rich chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center of belgian warm chocolate. Baked to order, which takes 20 mins. to make. One of my favorite desserts. It also comes with a side of Chantilly Cream, which is the next best thing to sliced bread! So freshly whipped, light, & tastes like a whipped vanilla bean ice cream. SOOOOO soooooo GOOD! Every bite I took.. I added this cream with my cake. Heavenly!!! I am known to finishing all my meals, but I could only eat half this portion. When the server first presents this dessert to you, you'll just be amazing how much you get. It's like a whole meal... dessert style. Then sugar coma sets in & you have to reevaluate your desire to finish it all or throw in the towel. I... threw in the towel & rested my head back. Waaaaay too much for lil ole me. Even my heart was racing! 

Three mishaps, wanted to take our leftovers home, but the runner threw away half my dinner... Damn it! I love that Baked Potato!!! Oh well... Next time I want the to-go containers & bag it myself. Second, having to wait for a long time for our entrees to come out. Felt rushed. Third, being charged for both sides ($17) when it's included in the Prime Rib Dinner. I didn't catch it at first, but caught it after tallying 20% tip & giving my signature. You would think if I ordered that special, you would know not to charge the sides right?! Hmm honest mistake?!

J'avais bien entendu parlé de cette endroit réputé pour la qualité de sa viande. Je n'ai pas été déçu. Le Petite Filet Mignon était délicieux et cuit à la perfection. J'ai aussi beaucoup apprécié le gratin de pommes de terre. Je trouve juste dommage d'être obligé de payer pour l'accompagnement. Sinon l'endroit est agréable et le service est top du top.

2667901,2010-11-15,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"This is part of a chain of luxe steakhouses ala your Morton's, your Smiths and Wollenskys, etc. My mother had two birthday dinners this year for family reasons, and this was the first one. I think it was 11/04, for those of you date-obsessed Yelpers.

Anyway. We blew a 300+ dollar bill here on a party of six because there was a lot of drinking. Teenaged brother had the mushroom ravioli (okay), dad had the dover sole (really good, excellent saucier work.) The rest of us had steak except for brother-in-law, who had the pork, because brother-in-law is a gentile fool. His pork looked seriously undercooked and rather than complain, he didn't eat most of it. Which is seriously fail at 30+ bucks an entree ala carte, but whatever.

Drink review: everyone else ordered off the cocktails menu. I had a sip of some, most notably my sister's mango thing. It was smooth but the vanilla was an odd choice for a flavor dash. I had a dirty martini with gin. It was solid except for the fact that they didn't actually put enough olive juice in it, so they brought me a little carafe of olive juice for me to self-prepare. Which is really excellent service and fail bartending. 

Anyway. It's solid and in the neighborhood but for the price you could ALSO go somewhere like Cut or Craftsteak or Prime and really blow some minds.",BemKKkZBBmu9GupEwKBj9g,2,1,3,8qvdnFHe-i-GJN_1Crfl0Q

2800376,2018-02-08,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"Fleming's was a disappointment.  It's priced as a high end steak house, but it doesn't measure up to many of the other high end steak houses around town.

Service:  Our server, Monica, was very nice; but she seemed to be overwhelmed by having too many tables.  Drinks and food were slow in coming, and I received a medium filet rather than the medium-rare rib eye  I had ordered.  When I pointed it out Monica comp'd our dessert, which was nice but still...

Food:  My accidental filet had a nice sear but was a little mealy.  My starter of shrimp and scallops on grits was pretty flavorful, but the shrimp were a bit overcooked.   My wife liked her Chilean Sea Bass and her starter of wedge salad.  We shared a side of the House potatoes, which were excellent.  All in all, the food was good but not great, and not justifying the high prices.  The meal described above, with two rounds of drinks/wine, came to well over $200.

Ambiance:  Nothing terrible, but not to my taste.  A very plain room with tables packed in pretty tight.  Fortunately, the area where we were seated was pretty empty on a Wednesday night, but other parts of the restaurant were crowded and loud.

Odds and ends:  Parking was a little bit dicey for an off-strip location in the 'burbs, but we lucked out and found a convenient space.  Much easier than the strip, of course, and the crowded parking lot does illustrate that Fleming's is popular with the locals.  Drinks were a little skimpy, but the prices were not too bad.  The bread basket was a small loaf of French bread, but was served with two very nice cheese spreads instead of butter, which we enjoyed.  A little creativity never hurts.

All things considered, we don't regret dining at Fleming's but we probably won't be back.  If you want a good steak on the West Side, I would suggest SC Steak at the Suncoast, a couple of miles away.  Better food, lower prices, and nicer ambiance, in my opinion.  Oh, yeah, and much faster service.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,eU3kBIAnkECcOGu5vBvqNA

2837120,2011-04-06,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I'm not a big fan of steakhouses in general, but I went with a group of 10 colleagues, and I just went with the flow.  The food was typical of any upscale steakhouse.  A la carte steaks, seafood, and decent side dishes and desserts.  The atmosphere is very good.  I think the lighting was perfect, unlike one of the other reviewers who thought it too dark.  It was packed, and therefore a bit noisy.

The scalloped potatoes and lobster tempura were my favorites. The crab cake appetizer was disappointing.  I ordered the Alaskan sole, which was ok. 

Reading other reviews would make one think that the service is awesome here, but not tonight.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but there are a few details that really bugged me.

They have an extensive wine list, and our host selected a very nice 2002 Cab.  The wine came out in decanters, and the server put the decanters on the table without pouring.  Ok, maybe giving it time to breathe.  But just seconds later, he started randomly pouring the wine for some of us, then walked away.  I thought perhaps he was pouring for those people who didn't have cocktails, which some of us brought over from the bar.  That would have made sense, but no, that wasn't it.  Even my boss, who ordered the wine, wasn't served.  So after a few minutes, I grabbed a decanter and started pouring a glass for myself, and offered to pour for him.  The waiter came over and said hang on, I'll get that for you.  Then he poured for a few other people.  Interestingly, the only 2 women at the table were among the last to be served.  No big deal, but I have come to expect that ladies be served first. 

The entrees came out, once again my boss, and the one who was paying the bill, didn't get his entree with everyone else.  We two ladies got our entrees nearly last, and the servers confused the dishes.  We said that was wrong, he said, oh I'll fix that for you in a minute, walked away.  No big deal, we swapped our dishes ourselves, but really. 

Then halfway through our meal, a manager came out with a half eaten re-fired steak.  Did someone get a refired steak?  Umm, not this table. Was kind of weird to have someone try to serve me someone elses well done half eaten steak.

In general, the servers just seemed kind of sloppy.  Not offering new silverware, stacking dishes, food not coming out at the same time.

Since one of the orders came out so late, we did get dessert comped.  A nice selection with large portions of various goodies from chocolate lava cake to cheesecake.  The key lime pie was very good.

To their credit, they were packed on a tuesday night.   My $5 happy hour cocktail was good.

The bill with tip came out to about $150 a head.  For that price, I would have expected more.  On the other hand, I am usually  disappointed with steakhouses like Morton's and Ruths Chris - they're just not for me.   If I want a steak,  I""m equally, if not more satisfied, with firing up the backyard grill.",Qqwe5RtRgxwfOVP4Kzn-9w,0,0,3,u5jz6-jM_ECqbcThL8FKJA

2901960,2012-08-15,1,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I was really looking forward to Fleming's for a long time.  I love me some USDA Prime steak and, that's something Fleming's boasts about.  When we arrived in the parking lot there was valet service similar to Del Frisco's but, quite unneccessary and a bit tacky since there's ample parking close to the entrance.  The decor was classy, cozy, and inviting with upper-crust steakhouse decor (wooden and leather accents).  Despite the ambiance, the food was a mediocre and, so was the service.  We dined there either on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening and the servers seemed a bit overwhelmed/understaffed.  Foodwise, there was absolutely NO wow factor for a $230 meal (tip inclusive).

Winos, perhaps...?  Todd (hubby) orders a glass of Conundrum, and I order a glass of Riff pinot grigio.  Wine arrives in timely manner, yay!  Appetizers...yes/no?  The hubby ordered the crab cakes and said, they ""taste like they were frozen.""  As most of you Yelpers know, I do NOT eat anything that swims, so I'm just reiterating my husband's rant.  I wanted to order the french onion soup and/or the Fleming's Salad but, saw/heard they were nothing spectacular, so I refrained and stuffed myself with bread.  The bread was pretty good with the sundried tomato butter and the feta cheese butter!  In fact, I ate so much bread before my steak that one of the server's assistants came around two times to brush off the bread crumbs...embarassing, I think so.  

Hubby and I are having good conversation after his crab cakes/before our entrees that we only have about 1/3 of our wine left.  His wine has stuff floating in it.  Let me redefine ""stuff.""  ""Stuff"" is looking like dandruff, plankton, particles floating in his wine.  We usually do drink wine with our meals but, NEVER had ""stuff"" floating in our wines.  It's possible breading from the crab cakes or crumbs from the bread could've stuck to his lips and floated into his glass but, this would've happened at other restaurants as well.  Todd inquires about the ""stuff"".  Our server said it was ""residual sugar"" but doesn't offer to replace the REMAINDER of his wine.  Not very classy/service-oriented for a steakhouse or that of any kind of restaurant.  Really, our server just lost mad brownie points with me because, the ""stuff"" that was floating in his wine was repulsive.  My wine was ""stuff"" free.  Relentless, dumb, hard headed, persistent, winos, we order two more glasses which were ""stuff"" free.

Our entrees took a little longer than anticipated to come out, hence all of the bread I ate.  I ordered the ""Main Filet Mignon"" (cooked medium) with a side of Cabernet reduction and Todd ordered the ""North Atlantic Lobster Tails.""  For sides, ""Fleming's Potatoes"" and ""Creamed Sweet Corn.""  As soon as I saw my steak, it looked less than impressive.  Yes, looks are deceiving but, not in this case.  My steak was overcooked (seemed like medium well--not much pink) and lacked taste.  I have never eaten such a poor USDA Prime filet until now; in fact, I have had way better USDA Choice filets.  I was so hungry, hence stuffing myself with the bread, that I just sucked it up and ate the steak.  Todd liked his lobster tails and said they were cooked perfectly but, also noted it's not rocket science to steam two 8oz. lobster tails.  Our sides were good and the portions were ample for 2-4 people. 

To be honest with you, we probably would've ordered at least one dessert and more wine but, we were so underwhelmed with our food and service that we just wanted to get the experience over with.  He hoped, we tried, they failed.  Way better steakhouses in Vegas.  Hopefully, Fleming's can use this information to tighten up their ship.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,0,0,2,Y8UKtT__g9iQ_V86eSzzcQ

The Operating Partner, Jackie E., gave me her card to contact her for the cleaning, but when I reached out to let her know that I was luckily able to get the wine out with no staining, she didn't even bother to respond.

The dimmed seating area was romantical, and the service was great.  They even ask you if you prefer dark napkins before being seated.  

The steaks were good.  They are juicy and flavorful.  The sides were yummy, too.  From their whipped potatoes to the vegetables, everything was delish.  

So, you may be asking me, ""why 3 stars"", and the reason why is because it was just ""eh"" to me.  I wasn't wowed, nor did I dream of the steak or crave it the next day like I do with some others.  Still, for $125 for the meal, I wanted to feel more with the food.  I wanted to feel the love in the meat, the care for the cuts, and I somehow missed it.

The pork belly was excellent.  The calamari could have been excellent but it was a little rubbery.  The sauce was excellent, but the calamari itself let me down.  Then came the steak. It also had potential.  There were some very tasteful bites but overall my steak was a little chewy. Was far from a melt in your mouth cut.  Did not cut that easy either.  My girlfriend had the filet and the famous potatoes and loved them both.  So I guess the jury is still out for me.

To their credit we did probably go on one of the busiest days of the year (the Saturday after Valentine's Day). 

The waiter was knowledgeable, knew the difference between different cuts of meat, and seemed to have the entire wine list memorized. The wine list was on an iPad which made browsing really easy. 

For that kind of money $55 for a steak, and $10 for sauteed spinach, and 10-15/ glass of wine, I expect a more attentive staff, and less of a cafeteria feel. 

I hope this review isn't too harsh, because literally every table had people at it, which could explain the slow service and crowded, and rushed ambiance. 

On my next steak outing;I will be looking for a more subtle and refined experience, and will probably go smaller and independent. Food was solid, yet I expect more when I'm spending that much mullah.",ao1mBK2Wvwd-L0FiyC_lKw,3,0,3,BmlsrGfgXgrE0gxiOwgwQA

I've been here for dinner and it's pretty good but in Vegas, there's probably at least another 30 steakhouses you can go to. 

What differentates this steakhouse for me is the value of their happy hour.  This place sh1ts all over Kona Grill's happy hour.

We had each of the 5 appeteizers offered:  Tenderloin Carpaccio, Sweet Chili Calamari, Seared Ahi Tuna, Cajun BBQ Shrimp, and a Mushroom Ravioli.

They also offer wine by the glass and cocktails.  Every item is 6 bucks which makes it affordable to hit this spot frequently.

The only downside is in terms of food, there's only 5 items and i'm not sure how often it rotates.  Also, it's only served in bar till 7pm.

3241763,2016-03-27,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"An updated review for the newly renovated Fleming's Restaurant. The entire place has a new look from the bar area to the dining room. The lighting is still subdued but with ceiling spot lights above the tables and booths the menu is very readable. However, there were a few people that still needed help from their cell phone lights. The decor has softer material which results in the dining room being more conversation friendly. The restaurant  was very busy with all tables and booths being filled at 7 PM. Our server Rory was spot on. Although he had several tables to cover he kept an eye on our water glasses and followed up on our satisfaction with the help of a assistant to help deliver the food and clear the plates.

As in the past the food quality was excellent. The Petite Filets were prepared as ordered and tender and juicy. The asparagus was overcooked to my taste. My steak was ordered with the add on of jumbo crab meat served on top of the steak. I do not thing the quantity of crab meat deserved the additional amount charged. Either increase the portion or lower the price. However the crab meat was fresh and sweet.

If you are using the valet an expedited delivery is available. Just submit the valet receipt at time of payment and your server will request that your vehicle is out front by the time that you leave.

3296867,2016-01-09,1,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"For some reason, I am having difficulty finding a truly great steak in Las Vegas. Fleming's is just one of a number of examples. Keep in mind I am only speaking about the steak itself, not the accompaniments, desserts, drinks, etc. 
There is no question that living in NYC my entire life has spoiled me to a great steak. Luger's, S&W, The Palms, Sparks, Morton's, Frankie & Johnnie's, the Old Homestead, and the list goes on and on. You go to ANY of these places, and you get a PRIME cut of beef. 
I've complained to my friends here in LV, and they suggested I try Fleming's. What a disappointment. I've gotten comparable pieces of meat at the most ordinary supermarket. I can say the same about the Andiron and other steakhouses in the area. I also had similar experiences at the Echo & Rig (Tivoli Village), the Charcoal Grill at Santa Fe casino and even the T-Bones in Red Rock. Once again, I am strictly talking about the steaks themselves. I've had the Alaskan King Crab and the Dover Sole at T-Bones, and those meals were extraordinary. 
But the steaks themselves would NEVER be classified as PRIME cuts of beef at any of the steakhouses I frequent in NYC. For the uninitiated, cuts of beef come in select, choice, and prime. I defy any of the LV steakhouses I've tried to authenticate their beef as PRIME. You put a prime cut of beef in your mouth and you'll know the difference. You don't have to chew until you're tired, and the flavor is outstanding. None of what I've tried in LV measures up.",kgWP_JQ8LxSDwiaoRUPX6w,2,1,2,qCNlQdlEm_EDr4YQ4ZdfzA

3397273,2014-04-11,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"Have been to this location several times. This review is based on my visits during happy hours in the bar rather than the dining room, as I have had better food and experience in the bar side.. My date & I had planned to eat in the dining room, but our first stop was in the bar to grab a happy hour drink. When we saw the 567 menu, it sounded so good and we already had a seat in the bar, we just decided to try it out. 

Food) It was a great find! The boyfriend and I tried their $6 Prime burger, which was out of this world that night. We split it, so we could both try it. Their vodka HH martinis are always good and stiff. I love that I can get a blue cheese stuffed olives, freshly stuffed from their bar! We also tried the pork belly...it was special, I recommend it. Nice crispy rendered piece of pork belly with chutney. Lastly, we ordered the crusted shrimp. This was my favorite part of the meal, but we were too full to eat much. 

The next time we went, we just ordered the burger and the crusted shrimp. Alas, the shrimp wasn't as tender, yet crispy, as they were the first time. The burger wasn't as juicy and flavorful that night either.

I've  eaten in their dining room, and I find it's just an okay experience for me. I like the life and activity in the bar side. I love the decor, the dark woods, the ambiance, the low lighting, and the sports on in the bar. It's just a little too stiff in the dining room for my wild personality. I like to be surrounded with activity. The dining room is more mature, subdued and better for a family dinner.

Service) is a 5 everytime, busy or not, dining room or bar.

Tip) If you are grabbing HH in the bar, better to go early. Starts at 4:30-7pm and the bar is small and full after after 5:30 pm. Though, we've always been lucky to slide into a spot even around 6:30pm...pure luck.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,3,2,4,SLP-tpuD-pqJbP6B0OlCKw

3517293,2012-12-23,3,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"If you're craving steak and don't want to leave the friendly confines of Summerlin, Fleming's should be near the top of your list. When we stopped in on a Tuesday night it was hopping and there was a 15 minute wait. So, apparently the fine folks in and around this master-planned community are well aware of the good eats here.

The atmosphere is just like any other traditional steakhouse. You've got your white linens, dark wood accents, mood lighting, etc. And, just like other steakhouses you'll find the typical steakhouse fare: for example a wedge and caesar salad, French onion soup, some seafood, and a variety of steaks. It's familiar, comforting, and (most importantly) good.

The crab cake appetizer ($15.95) consists of two small jumbo lump crab cakes in a lime butter sauce. They're lightly seasoned, allowing the sweetness of the crab meat to shine.

Unfortunately, the butternut squash soup ($9.50) was a miss. Thin, watery, and runny aren't good qualities for any soup.

The 14 oz. bone-in filet ($54) made up for it. While it could have benefitted from a more charred exterior, the seasoning was spot on and the quality of the beef was well worth the hefty price tag.

We had two sides. The sautéed mushrooms ($9.50) contained a variety, most of which were slightly overdone, which I actually prefer. The sautéed sweet corn ($8.50) was average at best.

Surprisingly, they have a kid's menu. With our little guy in tow, he gladly ordered a plate of chicken tenders ($14.95). What came out was a massive mound of crispy fries topped with several strips of chicken. The plate easily could have fed two or three kids. The meal also included an appetizer of celery, carrots, apples, and ranch. A kid's ice cream sundae is an additional $1.

Splitting an entree usually means the wife and I have room for dessert. We went with their chocolate lava cake ($10.95). You'll definitely want to share this dish. It was a big mound of cake and oozing belgian chocolate. The vanilla ice cream and chopped pistachios provided a wonderful contrast in temperatures and texture. Countless restaurants have a version of this dish, but this one was truly memorable. The fresh whipped cream on the side didn't hurt either.

The meal wasn't cheap but was much cheaper than a similar one on the Strip. They may play it safe with the menu, but it won't leave you disappointed. If you're looking for that traditional steakhouse experience it's good to know that you don't have to travel far to get it.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,6,4,iZWxzyxsTl8jXcM6xLIPHQ

3739838,2011-05-14,1,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"Service was substandard at this fleming's location. Wine list was very good, but service slow. Scalloped potatoes and porcinini rubbed  fillet were very good, but the soft fillet was grainy. I haven't encountered this before. So I have to knock a star off. It was the char and the porcini sauce that made the steak, not the meat itself. Something seemed wrong.

The night I went servers were dawdling around and the placed closed early. The salamander was turned off a half hour before last table time. This infuriates me. 

I don't know how a restaurant can charge these prices in this area and get away with such bad service. I was generally not happy with this Fleming's location and I think the prices in San Francisco Bay Area were actually cheaper than this place.

The ZD Cab was excellent, and the Italian white they had was very good. 

I was underwhelmed by the meal at this price point. Super high end food is getting harder to find and quality is dropping across the board to deal with rising food costs.",cISamqDvCPLALqZPDCg3XA,0,0,3,fHxHILjrTl-TOQxGczE5Kw

3751667,2017-05-24,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"How well one of the steaks was prepared, friendliness from the bussers, and the extensive wine list is the only reason why this place gets 2 stars.  We randomly decided to go here tonight for dinner because it's one of the places I wanted to try for years based on all they hype created around it. Needless to say, it was very disappointing.  The service from our server, Monica, was not as prime as the steaks.  Her tone of voice sounded very condescending, and it was like she did not care.  Hospitality was not unrivaled as their website boasts.  I think she passed by our table about 5 times before we had to ask her for another fork, as mine was missing from the busser clearing the table before the main course was to arrive.  Normally, a server periodically checks on their patrons to make sure everything is good, or if they need anything else.  Instead, she was more interested in holding up the wall while heavily engaged in conversation with her manager and co-workers several times throughout the 2 hours we were there.  Another thing which was kind of bothersome is I overheard another server give a nice introduction to their party, and go over the special of the night with his party.  None of that happened when Monica approached our table.  She just approached the table and asked if we wanted wine.  The only way we knew her name was because the hosted told us who our server would be.

The other steak which wasn't prepared how asked, was overcooked.  I'm going to assume because it wasn't properly communicated to the chefs how it was to be prepared.  The price of dining there is expected because of the so-called reputation and preparation of the steaks.  However, if I am going to pay fine dining prices for a steak, then it should be accompanied with fine dining service.  I would have raised my concerns to the manager, but never got the opportunity to meet her being that she table touched every table except ours.  I can see if it was busy in there to get this type of service, but it wasn't even busy in the restaurant.",yleVcuBH642Q493g9k1ZfA,0,0,2,CyU3SuO-Ni0C23ceIIHLfg

Meat: wet-aged (not my preference). Properly cooked. Perhaps a little underseasoned, but quite juicy and flavorful.

Sides: A la carte. Very good, especially the crispy shoestring fries.

Wine: Outstanding selection of wines by the glass. This may be the single best thing about the restaurant.

Service: Also outstanding. You get a lot of attention from the parking valet onward.

It's a signficant distance from the Strip, which in the end probably makes it not worth the effort since there are so many other choices on the Strip that are only a fraction more expensive...but if you live near Summerlin, and don't want to walk miles from a casino parking lot to a casino restaurant (God I hate that), then Fleming's is a pretty good alternative.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,2,2,3,sQEkpGA1Ln6o3U6Ugg9N3g

3915339,2011-12-01,3,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I really, really tried my best to hate on Fleming's.  See, I'm kind of a food snob, so when I crave a delicious steak, I usually find myself at some independent local joint, not a chain owned by the Outback.  But when Fleming's sent me an email saying they're offering $25 off any check of $50 or more for the rest of the year, I had to give it a shot.

From the moment I walked in the door, I was treated to really good customer service.  Well, that's not quite true.  I arrived at 8:51pm for a 9pm reservation and was told they weren't ready to seat us, yet.  Seemed a bit odd as they had open tables.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and perused the menu, and before we could decide if we were going to get a drink first, they came over to seat us.  From then on, it was great customer service.

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and my buddy Mario ordered a different cut, don't remember which one.  Mine was $40 and his was $42, and both were absolutely delicious.  Neither of us left a bite of steak on our plate.  I'm going back soon and getting Mario's choice because it had so much flavor.  Fleming's also offers complimentary sauces for your steak, of which Mario partook in one.

We were also celebrating my birthday, and they brought the hugest piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen for a freebie.  When the check came, it was just over $60 after tax.  They took off the $25 pre-tax, so actual savings is more like $27.  We left a handsome tip and vowed to come back within the next week.

I'm very tempted to come here solo and have a steak and an appetizer for even cheaper!

UPDATE 08/24/12: I finally went for happy hour and tried their $6 burger.  Amazing.  Not the best burger I've ever had, but plenty tasty, and HUGE for $6.  And it came with two delicious onion rings and a fantastic dipping sauce.  Only ordered a water with it and got no ""happy hour attitude"" from the staff.

My steak was 8 ounces and hers was 6 ounces.  Mine came with asparagus--3 spears and hers came with Fleming's potatoes.  I ordered mine black and blue and she ordered hers medium.  Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  I didn't taste any porcini from the porcini rub.

I thought there'd be more than 3 asparagus spears so I didn't order an extra side and the small amount of Fleming's potatoes was fine for my wife.  

We were started with a nice breadbasket with two kinds of flavored butters.  I didn't overdo the bread because I wanted to enjoy the steak and to have some room for dessert.  When we ordered our meal, the server informed us they needed 10 minutes to prepare the chocolate lava cake if we opted for that for dessert.

Part way through our meal, the server stopped by and asked if she should put in an order for the lava cake.  I thought it was a bit early, and should have declined at that time, but instead I trusted her knowledge.  I am a fast eater, my wife is a tortoise.

Another server brought the dessert to the table just as my wife put down her fork from her meal.  When this other person saw the table hadn't yet been cleared, she took the cake back to the kitchen and placed it on a shelf.  She then came back and cleared the table, went back to the kitchen, and returned with the dessert with its now melting ice cream.  Also, they failed the sweetener packet test miserably!

When you're paying as much for your meal as you do at Fleming's, you expect good if not excellent service.  This simply wasn't good service.  I would give this place a 2 star rating based on just the service, but the steaks were so good I raised it to three.  It was OK if not A--OK.  

With all the good steakhouses in this city, I won't be returning even though it's close to where I live.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,2,3,jhnqWcA6acnJjMzsxUaaOw
4014423,2013-04-08,2,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I love it when my occupation (resident IT Stud) allows me to go to these 'IT seminars' where we learn about new technology coming out on the market.  I especially love it when these seminars are at a swanky place that most times I can't afford!  For this one I put my game face on, shined my glasses, put my pocket protector in place, and headed out to Fleming's Prime Steakhouse in the NW part of town.  Goodness (and geekiness) ensued.

After being greeted at the door and lead to the registration table for the seminar, I found a nice table in the back where I would be little bothered with the meal I was about to consume in honor of network technicians everywhere.  Met up with some fellas I know from another division in our state network, and chatted about the upcoming 3G/4G service disposition, as well as rumors about the fall of Apple stock, and possibly the state of pocket protector technologies (very important).  After a round of iced tea and virgin Margaritas (silly nerds) we were welcome by our hosts of the day.  Of course at this point, my mind kind of tuned itself out and focused solely on the menu we were going to enjoy at today's techie outing.

Each table was started out with a loaf of warm bread (damn you carbs) with some great whipped herb butter.  We were also allowed to share several appetizers per table:

-Cedar Roasted Mushroom & Artichoke Flatbread - monterey jack cheese, roasted red peppers, and garlic

-Prime Steakhouse Meatballs - with shiitake mushrooms, and peppercorn sauce

-Housemade Burrata - charred grape tomatoes with wild arugula, served with garlic crostini

-Fleming's Salad - complete with candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomato, onion, and herbed croutons

All very good.  Nice start to a meal, eh?  After a brief break from eating, we were all treated to a what seemed like a very, very, very long seminar on cloud computing, virtual servers, and BLAH BLAH BLAH.  I know, I should have been listening better.  Thankfully, not soon after we were allowed to complete the orders of our lunch.  We had our choice of:

-Petite Filet Mignon
-Breast of Chicken
-Barbecue Scottish Salmon Fillet

I always say, at a steakhouse, do as the carnivores do.  I just had to go with the Petite Filet Mignon.  Come on, USDA Prime, seasoned with only black pepper and kosher salt, then broiled at 1600 degrees till your choice of doneness?  I.  AM.  GAME.  I'm like Missy Elliott in an over-produced rap video,  'Doot..doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot...Get ur' freak on...doot-doot-doot-doot-doot..'

That baby came to the table sizzling.  It was a nice cut, but being petite it was probably around the 5-6 oz. range.  But no complaints here!  Meat was succulent, tender, and juicy all around.  Cooked just right for me at a medium rare.  It wasn't the best filet I've had, but it was very good.  For free...it was excellent!  Although looking back, that salmon fillet looked really yummy as well.  Maybe next free power lunch!

Along with our entrees, each table got to share a sampling of some of Fleming's fabulous sides.  I managed to finagle (nerd rage galore) scant tastings of:

-Mashed Potatoes with roasted garlic
-Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese (oh man this was delish)
-Sauteed Spinach

All great, all loaded with extra butter.  Thank God for that slice of bread I saved from earlier!  I sopped it all up.  Fatty McGhee was in the house.

But wait...there's more!  At the end of our IT seminar we were treated to a nice slice of Cheesecake - NY style topped with blueberry sauce and white chocolate shavings.  What a way to send me off back to work!  Food coma in the making.  

The only thing missing from this seminar was the usual free USB flash drives sporting the company's logo (I really needed one), and the fact that I never, ever win the door prize from these things.  I think this time the grand prizes were a Best Buy gift card, and a gift certificate from Fleming's themselves.  But, at least I got away with a free company pen and a full belly.  And a lifetime's worth of annoying phone calls asking me to try their tech products free for 30 days.  Oh, but sometimes those phone calls are totally worth it.

The set up, size, vibe, and service is as consistent as it gets, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  I'm fine with the service and ambiance for the most part.  My only issue is the noise.  Tough to enjoy your steak and company when all you hear is everyone's conversation.  Regardless, I still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night. 

As for my meal, I have never deviated from their 8 oz petite filet mignon.  Before dinner, I scoped out the menu and contemplated on something different.  But guess what? I chose the petite filet again.  The steak was decently sized, but was a little disappointed on the overall taste. I got my steak medium-well and thought it was too pink. As for taste, I thought it was just ""A-Ok"".  For a pinkish steak, I thought it tasted burnt. I don't know if it was Fleming's or if my taste in steaks have changed. Price is about what you expect at a steakhouse.  However, I've had better steaks with the same price points.  

Overall, will I be back?  I'm sure I will one day.  Maybe next time I'll try their lobster or seafood.

4106900,2017-05-05,4,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"It's about time that I went to a half-decent steakhouse. Well worth the wait, but also perhaps a mere beginner's course in a restaurant genre which I've clearly been missing out on.

I was surprised this morning with the very welcome news that I had the opportunity to attend a private dinner at Fleming's in Summerlin. Seeing as I was free, I gleefully went. As you may have gathered, I was excited. Aside from the Brazilian buffet places, the only steakhouse that I can recall visiting is a location of the Black Angus chain.

Now that you're done laughing, I've definitely had some excellent steak and beef from restaurants including a newer Strip favorite and a sublime non-AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant, so I do have enough experience to stand on regarding meat consumption. I was really looking forward to having steak tonight, and as anticipated, our menu had an option for a steak. As I deduced from the Private Dining menu on the Fleming's web site (after the fact), we were treated to a slightly modified ""Reserve Dinner"" (quoted at $82 but complimentary tonight; note that options may vary per host's choices).

Housemade Burrata: charred grape tomatoes, wild arugula, toasted garlic crostini. Soft, spoonable cheese over crunchy bread is good enough, but throw in almost-melting tomatoes and the ubiquitous bitterness of arugula and you've got a great appetizer.

Seared Sea Scallops: crispy bacon-wrapped, orange-tarragon vinaigrette. Tender scallops with a not-too-sweet dressing. Bacon is almost cheating, but I always welcome it. Almost wanted to grab seconds, but I guess I hadn't had enough wine yet.

Modern Caesar: hearts of romaine, parmesan, fried capers, prosciutto chips. Unlike the shared plates before, this was presented as one plate per person, and it has a reasonable portion larger than a side salad but nowhere near an entree. As per my sentiments above, crispy Italian hammy bacon was certainly welcome.

Petite Filet Mignon. I opted for this rather than Shrimp & Sea Scallops, and of course there was no way I was even considering the Double Breast of Chicken at a steakhouse. Steak came out medium-rare as requested and was thoroughly knife-tender (no, not fork-tender). Filet mignon has a reputation as lacking flavor, but this was seasoned well throughout and especially benefited from the excellent seared crust. Certainly one of the better steaks that I've enjoyed in admittedly very limited experience.

Creamed Spinach and Truffle-Parsley Mashed Potatoes: two separate, shared sides that were both creamy and both compatible with my filet. The spinach had absolutely none of that watery feeling that you sometimes see in wilted veggies. The mash was smooth and prominently truffled.

Carrot Cake: three-layer cake with cream cheese frosting, dark rum caramel drizzle. The frosting was a little too sweet, but the mint garnish actually helped to offset and temper the saccharine quality. It was a nicely textured cake that almost made me not pine for a cheesecake (available per menu customization) or something chocolatey (not available in this price range).

Service was solid. The servers worked unobtrusively during our program and kept pouring wine (for me, the 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon 2014, certainly a viable wine even if relatively inexpensive) throughout the night. Some servers even carried an impressive five or six plates to an arm, which was certainly helpful for presenting the courses to each table as concurrently as possible.

It wasn't a truly divine experience, but Fleming's made me a very satisfied diner tonight. For lesser-experienced carnivores such as current-me, I'd definitely recommend going for a regular dinner. As for my personal growth, I'd probably be better off exploring the world of steak more deeply at other venues around town, both off- and on-Strip.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,6,4,Nyt7yTwchpWZLgg45jp8_A

The service was fine, not overly wonderful. We both had the Filet Mignon, it was alright, nothing special. I've had better at other steak houses. My husband ordered some asparagus to go with the meal, it was over cooked and chewy.

The Flemings salad was very good and so was the carrot cake.

Why just 3 stars, the steak just didn't cut it for us, and we are meat lovers.
If you do go, get the carrot cake, skip the filet mignon.",WUFbwSXTROccCtIAJ8OCVA,1,0,3,ObVPFDR1Dv9xWWmGd0g5RA

I've had better steak elsewhere but it was a good night out. Second time was last week when the family & I tried their happy hour. 4:30-7 in the bar/lounge area everyday. The drinks & most of the food on happy hour were amazing!!! So good. Right away I told my boyfriend, I can't wait to go back with him. Best calamari I've ever had! 
The third time was earlier tonight. My family loved their happy hour so much we decided to take my mom there for her birthday dinner. They had some really good specials going on. Surf & turf with an a small app & dessert for $65 (my dad & I got that) & a rib eye with a salad, side, and dessert for $35 (my mom got that). We also ordered another side & my dad had a beer. When the steaks came out, I didn't even have to say anything because our server was right there when I cut into my filet. I had asked for medium rare and it was well done. My dad's filet was also over cooked so both were taken back to be remade. My mom's steak came out perfect & we patiently waited for ours to come back while we ate the sides we had ordered. Not only did they remake our steaks, but they remade our sides for us. Which was completely unnecessary  but we took them home. When the steaks came back out they were perfect & delicious. We never once were rude or demanded free stuff. When it was time for us to pay the manager came over & said we had no tab because of the mistake. No tab!? I maybe thought they'd take one entree off but to have our $180 bill taken care of? It shows flemings really cares about their customers and having them back & after that amazing service - we definitely will be back.

4293831,2014-05-18,2,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"This review is for the happy hour, because quite frankly we couldn't afford to eat at this place otherwise. The happy hour runs until 7PM at the bar daily I believe. 

We weren't sure what to expect being that it was a Steakhouse, but after scoping out Herbs and Rye's happy hour, I was kind of expecting a similar looking place. Kind of mediocre outside but nice inside. This was not like that.

Fleming's is a very nice upscale steakhouse, to the point that when we walked in we were like wow...are we underdressed? Was that a ferrari parked out front? 

But thanks to Lisa H's recommendation of this place, we went in and sat down at the bar (the only place happy hour is). It was Friday night about 6:30, and there was only one bar table left, so we got a little lucky on that.

Their happy hour is 5 appetizers for $6, 5 cocktails for $6, 5 wines for $6 and a few items a la carte (or as they call it, bar la carte).

We ordered:

Crispy Pork Belly
Baked Brie
Salt and Pepper Shrimp
Roasted Mushroom Ravioli

and two Sam Adams IPA's to wash it down.

Each item is six bucks (they also have a burger that is $6 too, that must be the best value on there!)

The pork belly was delicious, but minimalist. It came with a little bit of what looked like grits, and something else I didn't recognize.

The mushroom ravioli was 3 raviolis covered in sauce, again, not a big dish, but WOW was it good. One of the best sauces I've tasted! A must try in my opinion.

The baked brie was also delicious because it was in a perfectly cooked croissant pastry, and came with apple pieces and greens, with walnuts on top of the pastry. All of those flavors combined with perfectly melted cheese (and plenty of it) made it an incredible dish.

The salt and pepper shrimp was also really tasty with a tempura like light fry on it. It also came with fried asparagus in the bowl. 

The Sam Adams were pretty good, not a fan of IPA's, but at 6 bucks for 2...I'll sure as heck drink em!

One of the best parts of the dinner was the server Paul. He was SO friendly, seriously one of the best servers I've ever had (and I feel like I've been eating out professionally for at least 10 years). He was so unbelievably polite and courteous, and just made the dinner so much nicer. He was on par with some of the servers in michelin starred restaurants, just impeccable. 

All in all, for 30 bucks plus tip, we got to try 4 extremely extremely well made dishes, had a beer, and had a beautiful atmosphere around us. At 15 bucks per person, with so much perfectly cooked variety, I can't help but give this place a perfect 5 stars.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,8,4,5,v9K70H2z2_PFNiaUrw1M0Q

4484563,2013-02-17,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"We're not big steak eaters at all, but when we got snail mail from Fleming's with a $50 gift card inside - we have no idea how or why! - we figured might as well go for it.  

I made a reservation for 8:00 p.m. on Friday just a couple of hours earlier.  Our table wasn't ready at 8, but we were seated not long after that by a very friendly and cheerful hostess, and the service went uphill from there.

As soon as we placed our drink orders we were treated to the bread basket - a loaf of seed-crusted bread with two flavored butters.  Too bad, 'cause it was all too good and I ate too much of it!

We shared a Fleming's salad, and I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side.  The kitchen split it for us and the salad wasn't drowning in dressing, which was delicious and not overly-vinegary.

I try to avoid eating a lot of meat, so I ordered the New Zealand Baby lamb chops from the small plates part of the menu, and hubby ordered the Newport Filet Mignon, which came with Fleming's potatoes.  My lamb chop plate had three baby chops and two thick polenta fries.  The fries were outstanding, but I was having a tough time with the tough and flavorless chops.  When the waiter came over to inquire about the food, I wasn't going to say anything, because one bite out of one little chop made it look like I'd already eaten half the meal!  But my face must have given it away, because he persisted, and then INsisted that he get me something else.  He let me keep the delicious polenta, and I ordered the sliced filet mignon, also from the small plates side.  Four small slices of perfectly medium-rare steak, each one sitting on an oval mound of porcini risotto, were enough to make this non-steak-lover feel as if she'd gone to culinary heaven.  The steak was like BUTTAH, and so delicious that I'm craving it even as I write this.  I don't even like risotto, but that stuff was outstanding.  And so was the filet my husband had, and his potato accompaniment was out-of-this-world richness personified.

Despite the fact that our check would have been very small compared to all the other tables around us even if we didn't have that gift card, our server, Ryan, was totally attentive and never once conveyed any kind of attitude.  Even more astounding, they took the lamb chops off the bill, as they should have, and comped the sliced filet!  That, my friends, is the hallmark of a good restaurant.

During the meal a hostess walked around distributing $25 gift cards to each table good for a future visit.  Unfortunately, it has a mid-March expiration, and I'll be out of town for an extended period, so it won't do us any good unless my husband decides to do a solo performance.

4573740,2017-07-14,5,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"With so many reviews talking how spendy it is, plus the likelihood of a gorge-fest, I was a little apprehensive. While I was super curious to try the bone-in ribeye, at 20oz, I thought that's too big -- plus what room would be available to try much else?

Happily, we came on a Sunday, which turns out to have a perfect $40 special. Available only on Sundays, you get the Prime Rib, plus a salad, side and dessert of your choice !!! Wow. This was so the way to go for me. 12oz of meat is plenty. It was delicious and juicy, and served at the medium-rare requested. (I wavered a bit if I wanted it closer to rare --- as a result, the server brought it out, with the center actually more rare. Toward the end, I sheepishly asked to have the remainder fired up a bit more. Yay.)

Started with the Fleming salad, which sounded up my alley, and refreshing. (Candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomatoes, onions, herbed crostini, lemon vinaigrette). The side I chose was Fleming's Potatoes (served with cream, jalapeños and cheddar cheese). While I thought that might all be too heavy, it actually hit the spot, and was a great complement to the table - and specifically, my entree.

Along the way, our server (he, and the entire team, I felt, were outstanding with their friendly attention to detail), suggested a couple different wines that were great selections. A pinot grigio at the beginning, and a nice red (Oberon) to accompany my Prime Rib.

To finish, I secured the Chocolate Lava Cake. While I liked it, I was not blown away. Perhaps because the inside 'Lava' was lukewarm. Like a heartier chocolate souffle. The CLC has much to like about it, and maybe a hotter center would fix it, but as a crowning finish to the meal, well, I was happy but not ecstatic. Or, maybe just weary from all that food !

Overall, I loved our meal here. The food, the wine, the beautiful room and the expert service all made for a lovely evening. And, having the opportunity to try so many things with their Sunday special made me, perhaps, well-rounded in the best sense of the phrase.",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,8,5,4,QmKuHvdvbhbXzhsg8o_G_w

Bread/butter: Probably the most flavorful butter I have ever tasted! I normally am very Anti-Chain restaurants because I feel they lack the little extra flairs that the strip restaurants have. I was blown away by the tomato b

Wine: Reasonable. I just had a single glass and the server didn't seem upset about losing a bottle sale. 

Brie: If you eat ANYTHING here, do not miss this brie. It was absolutely perfect. 

Filet App: I had It cooked rare and it came out perfect. It is about 3oz paired with a mushroom pasta. 

Potatoes: Probably the best scalloped I have ever had. 

Asparagus: Ive had better... It was slightly not-hot when It arrived. 

Dessert: Meh.. Not so awesome. We tried the Walnut chocolate pie and it was lacking some seriously flair. I felt that it tasted old and the crust was wayyyy too hard. 

Service: Probably the best service I have had in awhile. I know that servers don't love seeing two girls in their sections normally because they assume we wont tip, BUT our server was terrific. We tipped him accordingly and he seemed happy. His back server was also really helpful and the manager even stopped by to make sure we loved our food.

My experience was much better than the last time but that could be because we were in the dining room this time. The dining room provided nothing less than a five star experience. 

The food was flawless and my taste buds were beyond satisfied. Fleming's, will you please share the secret to your ice cream?

Taylor R was our server and although she was a sweetheart and did a wonderful job, our experience was really based on our busser, Gil. He was AWESOME. Never was my water glass less than half full and he was always willing to grab something if we needed it. He works with passion and is truly looking out for the customers best interest.

So you can imagine what they would try and do for us so we wouldn't come to posting this review. 

Well they gave us one free salad. 

A $200 ticket for 4 disgusted people who just saw a roach like bug literally about to go from the plate into their mouth is astonishing. I was so mortified at the time that I was just glad they took the freaking plate away but the more that I think about it.... they really just discounted a $10 salad to save their reputation.

4924206,2010-01-01,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I am a big fan of Fleming's and make a special trip out to this particular location whenever I am in Las Vegas. It is a considerable distance from the strip but well worth the trip, especially for the happy hour. Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm 7 days a week. There are five wines, five martinis (with premium liquor,) 5 appetizers, and the prime burger with cheese and bacon for a mere $6 each.

I have been to this Fleming's several times and have always sat at the bar. The service is always excellent and the food and drink quality is top notch. Here is what we ordered:

Appletinis - the drinks are strong without being too boozy tasting, and thankfully they are not cloyingly sweet like some flavored martinis. The appletini is made with Grey Goose ($6)

White cosmos - Ketel One, peach schnapps, white cranberry juice, and lime juice garnished with dried blueberries. This drink is light and fruity with a nice fragrant sweetness ($6)

There were 4 of us and we had prime burgers all around, and at $6 each these are quite the bargain! It is a huge burger with your choice of cheese (2 of us had bleu cheese the other 2 had swiss,) and alot of bacon, served with onion rings or fries. We all ordered the burgers medium rare and they were perfectly cooked, juicy, and delicious.

Seared ahi tuna - lightly seared but served cold with a spicy mustard sauce. Quoting one of my dining partners, ""This is amazing. I could eat this all day, every day.""

Beef carpaccio - paper thin slices of heavenly raw beef filet served with a creamy creole mustard sauce and cheesy toast. OMG is all I can say. I have this every time I am in a Fleming's and it is always amazing.

We could not resist ordering dessert and had 2 delicious creme brulees. The best part of the desserts at Fleming's is that they are served with a bowl (or a trough if you ask nicely) of fluffy and decadent chantilly cream. While quite amazing we pretty much abandoned the creme brulee and started eating the chantilly cream out of the trough with our spoons while making loud ""nom, nom, nom"" sounds.

Other items on the  $6 happy hour menu:

APPETIZERS:
SWEET CHILI CALAMARI
WICKED CAJUN BARBECUE SHRIMP
JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES, Red Pepper Sauce 

COCKTAILS:
FLEMING'S CLASSIC, Ketel One Vodka
MARGATINI, Gran Centenario Anejo Tequila
TROPICAL MARTINI, Malibu Coconut Rum

CHARDONNAY, Glen Carlou, South Africa
PINOT NOIR, Mark West, California
PETITE SIRAH, Vinum, California
CABERNET SAUVIGNON, 14 Hands, Washington 

As I mentioned earlier the service was excellent. Our bartender was alone behind the bar yet was able to give great service and make great drinks for us while also producing cocktails for a very crowded bar and dining room. Her bright and sincere smile never left her lips and our glasses were never dry. As soon as our glasses were half empty she asked if we needed more cocktails. We didn't have to wait very long for anything. Our food came out of the kitchen amazingly fast and at the correct temperature. The service was extraordinary from the time the door was opened for us and we were greeted by the hostess until the time we were sincerely thanked and wished a good evening, and again had the door opened for us by the hostess.

YELPIER DETAILS 

Fleming's has an upscale ambience, good food, superb service and at a reasonable price. Its menus offer nice selections of food and beverage.  It also has a classy bar. However, this restaurant does NOT have a view, and could be slightly noisy when filled to capacity.

Yes, we had excellent dinners at Fleming's before, 2x, to be exact, since its sister restaurant right NEXT DOOR (Roy's) was closed recently
- But this was the first time we came for its happy hour AND dinner. We enjoyed both!

We started our nice evening with happy hour over delicious apps (Pork Belly; Calamari) and tasty glasses of cab, at $6ea. 

For our dinner, we had Chef's Specials: Mahi, $37; Steak & Shrimp, $43; side of asparagus, $10.50. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The steak was tender and juicy but kind of small, the 3 shrimps were tiny and  slightly overcooked. For dessert we shared a wonderful Chocolate Lava Cake/Ice cream, $12.50 over great tasting coffee!

The serving staff for our happy hour and dinner were absolutely superb! Our waitress Monica and her crew were friendly and helpful, attentive but not overbearing. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. She cheerfully welcomed guests at the start, and warmly said goodbye to them at departure. 

However, as the restaurant was filled to capacity around 7pm, it was understandably a bit noisy. I would give it 5 Stars, if it had a view. 

In short, we had a wonderful happy hour/dinner experience here, and will be back again for more and soon!

Got here 5:05 pm on Tue/16 Apr:
- Place supposedly opens at 5 pm but it was pretty busy at the bar when I got there at 5:05 pm (some patrons, regulars I'm guessing, already had drinks/food/etc) and since all the bar seats were occupied I sat at a table.
- I waited about 5 min for a server but I think that's because it was fairly busy.  Once Niki, my server, got to my table and took my order everything was quick: martini arrival, food arrival, ice water refills...
-  My order: 1) I loved the Prime Burger which had bacon & choice of 3 different cheeses (I opted for blue cheese) and (sweet potato?) french fries.  2) Thought the calamari was too oily/soggy but the portion size was large so I took the remainder to go.  3) Had the tasty Stoli Bombshell at only 99 calories, otherwise I would have opted for the 2 for $6 Blue Moon seasonal.  
- The Prime Burger at $6 was a steal and will definitely order that again in the future, wouldn't  get the calamari again and the Stoli martini for $6 is a good deal.

I like finding/getting/sharing deals so if you want 58% off ($70 off of $120 value) food/drinks at Fleming's/sister eateries (Outback, Bonefish, Carrabba's, Roy's), you can do this by 24 May 2013:

Steps:
1) You must have an AMEX (American Express) credit card
- go to www.americanexpress.com and login to your credit card account
- click ""My Offers""
- One of your AMEX cards (I used my AMEX Costco TrueEarnings card) you probably have this offer ""Fleming's...Spend $100 or more, Get $50 back"" so click ""Get Offer"" tab next to it
- You'll get an e-mail saying your AMEX is loaded with the offer
2) Go to a Fleming's restaurant's bar area and purchase $100 gift card (do not purchase online) using that specific AMEX card
3) Fleming's will give you the $100 gift card and a ""$20 Bonus Card""
4) AMEX will give you a $50 cash back statement credit for making that $100 purchase at Fleming's

Expiration Dates:
- AMEX says 24 May 2013 is deadline to load offer & make the $100 purchase at Fleming's

- The ""$20 Bonus Card"" is ""Valid for redemption May 13th - July 15th, 2013""
- $100 card backside says ""This card can be redeemed at any of our restaurants in the United States"" so I think it can be used at Outback, Bonefish, Carrabba's, Roy's or Fleming's.

When it comes to Fleming's I felt that they amped up the ridiculous service and lost the idea behind  a great restaurant. My wife took me here for my birthday which was very nice of her. She made a reservation and from that point on the hostess, server, and assistant manager all called us by name. OK, nice touch...whatever. Here's where it gets a little obnoxious, and bear in mind that I get it... There is something nice about being treated like an infant at a restaurant... (rolling eyes).

Upon entering the place, I counted 4 people that asked if we'd like our coats checked, ok thorough. Then we are escorted to the table and we are asked if we'd prefer a black napkin instead of white, really? Our server made it a point to refer to us by name during every encounter and at the end of the meal we got her card in case we'd like to request her next time. 

Im not saying that any of this was unpleasant, but it's overdone... We got lobster tails and there was a guy who came over, referred to us by name and cut the meat from the shell. The manager came over twice to say hello and ask if everything was ok... OK ENOUGH!! Let me eat in peace!

My question is this, I'm trying to have a nice dinner with my wife and people are Constantly at our table! Do they really think we came to hang out with the staff? I realize that they are just doing their jobs but c'mon! if I wanted people running up to my table every few minutes, i'd eat with crazed children begging for tokens at Chuck E Cheese! (plus they have skee-ball)

The food was great, except that they cooked her steak wrong which is funny for such an overattentive staff. I think the manager apologized 13 times. To me, it's not a big deal but they were all running around apologizing. RELAX!

Water was filled, wine was great, bill was a little high but we knew that going in. Overall if you want a place to pamper you to death then you have it here. For me.. I can put my own napkin on my lap.",7rngkJ2lES5OthbMb4qe1Q,2,0,2,dxlYnzcGaRDBiOJU5byH-w
5127019,2011-12-02,2,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"There are crazy options in Las Vegas for steak lovers such as myself. If that weren't the case, Fleming's might be a 5-star, favorite steakhouse of mine. It's still close and that counts for something. At the moment, they are running a $25 off promo for purchases $50 or more, as long as you make an online reservation. This expires in January I believe. I love the customer service here, as well as the close proximity to my house. The hostess was great, as well as the server and the awesome guy who brings out the food. He literally balanced at least 8 or 9 plates on one arm while bringing food out to a different table. I gotta thank Rob for suggesting this place, and for knowing about the crazy good deal going on.

As per the server Britney's suggestion, I ordered a $42 Medium Plus (apparently that's a thing) bone out Rib-Eye. It was pretty massive and very juicy. It was pretty much cooked to perfection, with a nice char on the outside. I am weening myself off more cooked steaks, it's not easy to do when you grow up on leathery well-done steaks (thanks Dad :P). I thought I loved my steaks well done, but chose to force myself to cook and order them medium well for a while now, for added juiciness and flavor. Now I might be on a Medium Plus kick for a while. I will never be at the point that Rob's at, ordering his filet Medium Rare. Yikes. But I tried a slightly more cooked piece of his filet, on the outer edge. It was delicious. I really like their parmesan bread, I can't say the same thing for their weird spreads that come with it. I wasn't a fan. I also tried one of the complimentary sauces they offer. It was the peppercorn, and it was delicious. 

Once I dropped a subtle hint that we were celebrating Rob's B-day, they brought out a massive delicious piece of chocolate cake. It was a little rich, but that was mostly just the icing. 

With the current promo, Fleming's is a no brainer. After January, I'm not 100% sure I'll be back on any kind of regular basis. It's basically the same price as the slightly better quality steakhouses. And there are way too many steakhouses here that I haven't yet tried. But we'll see, the customer service was outstanding, and it's really close and convenient. Oh and I'm gonna upload a few pics as well. I just want to note that I'm proud of myself for restraining from using any meat puns in this review. A pun-less review from me is pretty rare.....

We ordred the Prime Ribeye medium rare and it came out slightly dry. I don't know if it was because of the quality of meat or the way it was cooked but BF didn't want to send it back so we just ate it.

In addition to the ribeye, we ordered the roasted mushroom ravioli, fresh mozzarella and sweet tomato salad and sautéed spinach. All of their dishes are flavored heavily with butter, even the sautéed spinach, so it's not for the health conscious. But, it makes everything taste great!

The server was a tiny bit slow but maybe because she thought we were enjoying a leisurely meal she didn't want to interrupt us too often. But our waters were constantly being re-filled. A+ for that :)",mNxjE1iEFc_AKRcAmiLyoQ,1,1,4,L9pDRGQP6r2YkAAkGqCCJw

The main course was filet minon with this delicious goat cheese mousse on top, as well as a piece of pecan-crusted salmon. The filet was wonderful, the salmon didn't blow me away. We also got the Fleming's signature potatoes and creamed spinach for sides. These are family style - can serve 3 to 4 people, so we couldn't finish it all. Also want to mention that I loved the bread, which they say is homemade, and the feta dipping sauce / butter to go with it. 

We also had a bottle of wine ('Sensual' - a cabernet from Argentina) which was great and on the lower end of the price scale. The waitress was nice but not as over-the-top enthusiastic, knowledgable, and descriptive as I have experienced at similar restaurants. Overall, a very good meal.

5199179,2010-11-05,10,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"Fleming's is in my hood, but being a steakhouse type of place, it had not been a priority to visit. I don't eat a lot of steak, and generally, I prefer my meals a tad cheaper than steakhouse prices. However, Fleming's happy hour delivers fast food prices in a red wine atmosphere.

The atmosphere is notable. Tuesday night, and the place was bumping with what I can only assume to be Summerlin's finest. There were Porsches lined up in valet, and I almost fled the scene because I was scared there was an Eyes Wide Shut type of thing going on inside. Entering was like discovering a secret society, but I liked the feeling of being an outsider. Sometimes I have an overactive imagination.

We arrived at 6:50ish, just in time for the happy hour that ends at 7pm. We sidled up to the bar, scanned the menu, and went straight for the $6 prime burger and a $3 tall, cold Blue Moon. Already a solid 4-star experience based on value. Even sans happy hour, the prices seemed reasonable for a steakhouse.

The burger was a winner, but a little overcooked, so maybe order your burger a shade under your desired end temperature. I went for Medium Well and received a solid Well. Loved the big challah-esque bun! The sides were notable too. A couple of nicely, thick cut onion rings, and a mini-wedge. Granted the mini-wedge is more like a pile of garnishes for your burger, but we requested a side of blue cheese, received both the dressing and crumbles, and chopped that garnish up into a dreamy side salad. Ta-da! And then they all took off their masks... just kidding.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,11,4,y65qu-6J9-w585smML4k3Q

The prime rib was tasteless and the Mac and cheese was like soup. The bread was not as good as in the past and they changed the way they prepare the wedge salad and it wasn't for the better. Instead of blue cheese crumbles it was served with a blue cheese pat. Like a pat of butter. A 1 inch strip of bacon not crumbles. Fried onion strings that were soggy not crisp fresh onions. It was like you had to create your salad after it was served and chop everything up yourself. The guy in the booth behind us complained that the prime rib was tough and got a free dessert. Ours came with dessert which the portions were smaller than in the past but that's okay as we were already disenchanted with the whole meal. Although the cheesecake and turtle cake were good.  The restaurant was very, very loud. We had to keep repeating ourselves. While I'm on my rant, my husband and I went to their happy hour a week ago and had the $6.00 prime burger. I thought it was just okay. Husband did not like at all. Thank goodness only $6.00 and not the normal $14.00.

They are going on 15 years and recently remodeled the dining room & bar. They focused mainly on the bar area, which they expanded due to their growing happy hour crowd and slightly changed the dining room. It looks great and seems to flow a lot better than before.  As far as the food goes what can I say except it's a chain. Is it good? Yes it's good. Are they using drug-free, grass-fed cattle, without hormones and antibiotics, or free range poultry that is also hormone and antibiotic free, NO. Is it organic farm to table ingredients or wild caught fish, NO. The fact that chains like to throw around fancy terms like Aged USDA Prime, Choice, Select, meats doesn't change the fact that it's Factory-Farmed, Grain Fed Beef. For the record this isn't a Fleming's bash session it's more of a chain steakhouse rant that should be addressed and includes their competitors Morton's, Ruth's Chris, or even worse, places like Long Horn, or Lone Star. It's worth noting that I do frequent Fleming's. I just want to be clear when I say it's good, because it is good. It's just not great or as healthy as it could be for the prices they charge. To be fair the job of any restaurant CEO and his/her board is to fight for consistency and their bottom line that's it, not the health of their customer.

Dinner was good overall with the consistency you'd expect from this chain with the food and prices.

Parking is a bear here during peak times as the lot is shared with another restaurant and a strip mall. I didn't mind the 10 minute walk to the restaurant, but if you do, don't be afraid to utilize the valet. We were greeted and seated immediately in the loud, busy restaurant in a large booth. Quarters are pretty tight with us having to side step between tables to get to our booth.

Wine lovers won't be disappointed in the selection and it will be easy to find your favorite as the list is organized neatly in the iPad provided. My wife went with her usual Moscato and I started with a whiskey peach martini and finished with a big pour of a Round Pond Kith & Kin Cab. The tenderloin carpaccio and shrimp cocktail were good starters but even though the shrimp were large, we probably could have spent the $21 on something different. Only the bone was left when finished with my bone in ribeye and my wife had room for only about half of her double chicken breast. I wasn't a fan of the Fleming's potatoes, as they were too heavy on the cheese and I was looking for starch as a side for my steak and not dairy. Make sure you give the kitchen at least 20 minutes if you want to order the chocolate lava cake.

Service was just OK for the price point. Our server wasn't that engaging or helpful, and was absent for about ten minutes after we finished dessert. I wasn't impressed at all with the food runner carrying four to five entrees on one arm with the bottom of some entrees touching the top of the food of other entrees. Is using a tray not flashy enough?

Before comps, the total was $230. We have our go to steakhouse in Summerlin which I believe has a superior steak, service, and a price point of $40 less per person. Fleming's is good but would be a second or third option for us. Happy hour is probably the way to go here or coming in for some of their special dinners that they advertise such as the 3-course filet and lobster for $49.95 might bring you the best value.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,4,2,3,xuzrGTiFkyOMo8m7jT0THg

I had been here before for wine and a burger at happy hour, and had just received a $50 off $100+ coupon, so we decided to get a table and indulge in a steak. Our server, Jennifer, was excellent, as were the food runners. I ordered a big pour 14 Hands Cab ($14.25) and my sister ordered a big pour Mionetto ($17.25). It always gives me pause when I get a GLASS of wine and am charged 1.5 times the retail cost of the ENTIRE bottle, but it is what it is; the wine was good and the big pour was enough to last through the meal. We shared the Main Filet Mignon (12 oz), medium rare $49.95. The steak was cooked perfectly, and was quite tender, BUT we both thought it was quite bland/tasteless. Don't get me wrong. I know filets have a lighter flavor, but this one? Nothing. Nada. I never add salt to cooked food, but I had to salt my steak as I sliced it to bring it out of total oblivion. Sad for a $50 steak!  We ordered two of the shareable sides: shoestring fries and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was ok, but rather soupy - more like a dip than a side and heavy on the garlic(?). The fries were a bust:  oily and limp. At the end of the meal I told Jennifer this, and that they needed to change the vendor, the temperature of the oil, or both. She said the fries were cut in house. Whoops - it's the kitchen. She graciously comp'ed the fries.

Their steak has gone down hill. My rating is based solely on the food and not the service. If I was doing the review based on service, it would have been a 5 star. 

I got the larger filet and ordered it med. well. When it first came out, it was so burned that it was like eating beef jerky. Normally I don't send food back, because you never know what could happen, but when paying 45 for just the steak... I thought hell no. So ok fine, no biggie. I send it back, and it comes back in less then 20 min. I start cutting into the steak and could tell right away something wasn't right... Oh that's because it came back raw. Third time finally got it right but the quality of steak is certainly not worth the price.... The meat was so very tough. Hard to justify paying 45 for it. Very sad, as I will not waste my money there again, until I'm over my anger with the cook. The sides came out luke warm, which wasn't impressive at all but we said nothing considering the whole steak fiasco. With two of us, both having a salad a steak and one side, an iced tea and glass of wine then a shared desert was 160 (which was after they comped the steak). By far a disappointment. 

On the flip side, our server was amazing. I mean we never had a dirty plate or empty glass the entire time we were there. So if you are looking for the highest quality of service, this is the place to go. If their food matched the prices then we wouldn't let the bad steak ruin us.

I have yet to delve into the main dinner menu because I'm usually here for what is a very affordable happy hour. I have not had anything that isn't amazing. The crab cakes are generous and delicious, the burger is awesome, the brie cheese puff pastry is rich and oh so good (very shareable portion). The mushroom ravioli is some of the best pasta i have had...the mushroom sauce on the plate never goes to waste because if i don't manage to eat it all, they have a basket of bread nearby for u to make sure u enjoy every bit.....and my absolute favorite dish is the tuna steak 

Holy holes in a boat, batman. This tuna is incredibly fresh, flavorful, and the spicy mustard sauce (spicy mustard and wasabi) is so good a drizzle wont do. You might as well order the sauce in a lil bowl on the side. 

I stumbled upon a great wine as well playing spin the bottle on the ipad menus at the bar as well. Chateau parenchere....that is also something i have not been able to deviate from because it is THAT good!  And at $10 a glass, its reasonable as well. 

I have been beyond satisfied with the service here, and everybody on the wait staff has been professional, engaging, and really nice to me (even coming here in shorts and a t shirt my very first visit), I appreciate that non snobby treatment.

The sides (garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) honestly were nothing to write home about, but were good but slightly forgettable.  Honestly, the mushroom ravioli appetizer was the most memorable for me, the pasta wrapping was very delicate and the ravioli literally felt like it melted in my mouth...I was tempted to just eat multiple orders of the ravioli as my main entree....it was that good =)  Definitely recommend this place if you want to avoid strip madness and still get a quality steak.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,1,0,4,Vg-QWsKeqo5zvP5-n6p6cA

Flemings is one of my all time favorite restaurants, this however was my first time to this location and it didn't disappoint.

We went to Flemings to celebrate a big step forward in the growth of my boyfriend's business. We made reservations online for their Filet and Lobster special $39.95 a person. We arrived and only had a brief wait before being seated. We were handed our menus and an iPad which had an interactive app for their wine list.

Our waiter was attentive and patient. It took me forever to decide on a bottle of wine - Caymus Conundrum. When I placed the order he said, ""the Red right?"" I was so thankful he said that, because I wasn't even aware that conundrum came in a red version, and no I didn't want that. Whew, that was close. They didn't have the white version we were hoping for, they do have it in Salt Lake, but the wines vary by location (they are hand chosen by the sommelier). We decided against a bottle after all, I ordered a glass of wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer. 

Note: Each location has an extensive wine list 250 or so wines and many are available by the glass. If you purchase a whole bottle, they will typically save the label for you and put it on a nice card you can save as a memento, perfect for special occasions! If you order a bottle of red wine, they'll bring a decanter to your table - this is they way all restaurants need to do it!

We placed our dinner order and enjoyed their fresh baked bread while we waited. If you haven't been here you'll LOVE their specialty butter - it's to die for! One is sun dried tomato, the other is champagne infused. You'll certainly want more than they bring you of each, and in the past I've not been too proud to ask for some to take home with my left overs - yes it's THAT good!

Our meals came with wedge salads - my favorite! The bacon was sweet (maple), and the blue cheese was generous. Our steaks were cooked to perfection! His was Medium rare, mine medium. The lobster was the best I've had in years! Not fishy at all, not rubbery, simply amazing! It also came with a side of spaghetti squash that was tasty too.

We ended our meal with their Chocolate Lava Cake - $11.95. It takes 20 minutes to make so you have to order it part way into your meal. But it is heaven on a plate! Worth every penny and definitely something to share.

I can't wait for our next excuse to celebrate, because I'm already dying to go back!

Tip: In Nevada, if you order a bottle of wine and can't finish it, they are allowed to re-cork it and send it home with you. Good to know.

Tip: They often have great pre-fix menus (check their website), but typically you'll have to make reservations online to get the offering. Also, for most holidays like Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc. They typically will offer a $25 gift card for your visit, good on a future visit.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,6,4,5,fVfEEAul86tg7yv0-T_FTQ

As a whole meal from beginning to end...it certainly is better than either Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  I like aspects of both those restaurants but certain things still lack for a complete meal.  

For ex...we only order steak at Ruth's Chris.  No sides, apps or desserts...cuz they all suck.  But not this place. Fleming's was surprisingly awesome.  The place was also super packed for a random Tuesday night.  

The bread for example doesn't come with just butter.  You get a feta cheese butter and a sun dried tomato butter.  I got the ribeye and the wife got the usual rare filet which were both fantastic.  Tons of sides to choose from and went with creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Had some special dessert not on the menu which was basically a super version of a Mcdonald's apple pie w/ cranberries and vanilla ice cream.  Fn great.

Supposedly people were taking longer than normal to finish up.  I guess it was Christmas Eve after all but the restaurant should have planned reservations better. 

Once we finally sat down, our service was very good.  The waitress and her assistants came by often to check on us and refill our water glasses.   We started with appetizers.  My mom had the onion soup and I had the wedge salad.  My mom enjoyed her soup - good flavor and cheese.  My wedge salad was delicious - nice big chunk of blue cheese, crispy onions, tomatoes, blue cheese dressing.  All yummy.  

For our meals, my mom had the lobster tails with drawn butter.  They took the tails out of the shells at the table.  Nice touch.  I had the petite filet mingion with béarnaise sauce.  The steak was a little tough but it was very tasty and cooked correctly.  

We did not have room for dessert but they looked good.  The hostess did tell us we would get a free appetizer due to the long wait for a table but our waitress did not seem to know that so there was no free appetizer on the menu and she did not ask.  The table next to us got a free dessert since they waited too.  If they are going to offer free stuff, make sure the staff knows.  

We did have coffee and tea.  My mom did not like the coffee - too bitter and strong.  My tea was good - got to pick my flavor which is always a nice touch.

Also, it was extremely noisy in the restaurant.  Not sure if people were just louder due to Christmas Eve or if its normally that loud.  It was hard to talk across the table.  They did have a nice quartet singing Christmas carols.

Most people don't think of this steakhouse for brunch, but we've been to the Summerlin location twice now for that very thing and had great experiences both times.  There are currently two prix fixe lunches to choose from, one with the main course of blue crab omelet and the other with buttermilk fried chicken.  Both of these prix fixe menus come with a starter and a dessert.  If you don't want either of these, there are several other things on the a la carte menu to choose from including a Filet Mignon Benedict, Crispy Chicken and Waffles, and Prime Rib Hash.  For side dishes, we've enjoyed the cheese grits as well as the rosemary-brown sugar bacon.  And, Sunday brunch isn't Sunday brunch without a mimosa; Fleming's serves up bottomless Sonoma Sparklers, their signature mimosa made with passion fruit.
Service has been excellent with the manager on duty coming by and checking on us during our meals.  If you want to try a new spot for your Sunday brunch meal, give Fleming's a go.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,4,4,9tFJhnoObQ20F8C_hT7rcQ

We asked if they could lower the shade. They did. Then idiot manager comes and opens it. She refused to keep it closed. She ended up redirecting the light to 3 other tables so they had the pleasure of the sun. 

I brought my whole family. My kids ate sausage and then I found out their sausage was raw! I showed the idiot manager who again didn't seem to understand that I would be the one dealing with this situation later--not empathetic and not a very bright person at all.

We ordered the Flemings salad, which was refreshing, and a perfect starter.  Then we each ordered the dry aged rib eye, and split the creamed corn and flemings potatoes.

Originally I wanted a NY Strip, but my waiter suggested the rib eye, so I agreed. I usually skip the rib eye because I tend to find it too fatty, although it is flavorful.  Stephen lucked out and got a rib eye that was perfectly marbled... Very little excessive exterior fat.  My piece was 1/4 fat, so on my plate was a blob of fat.  My waiter weakly apologized and pretty much said that's the chance of getting a rib eye.  For $52 I wasn't expecting that much fat!

For dinner we opted for coffee, no dessert.  Most places will comp coffee, especially after an incident as to how much fat I got versus meat for dinner.  Comped coffee is a nice gesture, and usually means more gratuity toward the bill. Nope, no such luck.

With tax and tip, our dinner for 2 came to $200. Lucky I got the gift card from Costco, and paid  $58 less... but still not a cheap dinner.

I think next time I'll stick to the NY Strip, and still stick to Costco to save me 20%!

I am always in search of positive dining out with young children.  For Sunday supper, we were able to check in at 4:30 pm. We sat in a spacious corner booth with a large, round table. Like all of our visits, we were treated with kindness and immediacy. We felt like a priority.

The children received apple slices with a warm caramel sauce. My son had chicken tenders with shoestring fries. My daughter had steak and shoestring fries, let me rephrase this, filet mignon prepared rare+. The proportions were generous. The quality was sumptuous. I regret I didn't capture platings with photographs, I was too engaged in our mealtime.

I particularly liked the Caesar Salad. The crispy, parmesan crisp and saltiness of the capers added uniqueness and a zesty flavor. Watch out for the prosciutto chip as an accoutrement if you are avoiding meat and pork.

I have limited fine dining experience in Las Vegas but this was highly recommended and the chosen venue for a New Year's Eve meal.  Fleming's hails from Newport Beach and I am surprised that in the 1990's when I lived in Newport I never dined at the original location.

The exterior facade is a welcome sight to the faux glitter of the casino strip.  Upon entering the two sets of doors, the layout was a perfect square with the bar to the left and the main dining area was dead center, somewhat sunken.  It gave you a good overview visual.  We were fortunate to have been seated in a somewhat smaller adjacent private dining room that had about 8 tables.

I like fine beef but rarely (sort of a pun) eat it but obviously this was going to be the mission statement here.  I ordered the Puccini Filet Mignon and ordered it medium rare.  An absolutely perfect slice of beef and cooked to perfection.  It melted in my mouth.  I also started with the house salad that was pleasant but not noteworthy.  The waiting staff was VERY well trained and when it was appropriate we were solicited for the top-drawer dessert that would require 20 minutes of preparation.

All in all, it really was a perfect dining experience.  My 4-star rating is based on that our actual waitress greeted us, took our order and finally served up the check.  There was subordinate staff that really took care of us throughout the meal.  It sounds silly, but in fine dining I prefer to establish a quick and friendly rapport with the person I am actually paying and tipping.

3 of us had prime rib and it was probably the best beef we have ever had. The previous night we have filet Mignon, but it didn't compare to the prime rib we had at Flemings. The salad and side dishes of creamed spinach & mashed potatoes were ridiculously good! The prime rib came with 3 different sauces too. My kid ordered onion rings for his side and the four of us enjoyed them together.

What more can I say? We didn't experience anything bad about this place. Our waiter approached our table with a trainee but made it a point to let us know so we wouldn't question why there was a guy following him around. The entire staff - servers, manager, hostess, etc. - were very polite and professional. This place runs like a well-oiled machine.

5837930,2012-04-21,2,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I am a regular fan of Fleming's, but had never before tried its Las Vegas location.  A Filet & Lobster Special for $34.95 drew Diane and me in with another couple.  After our meal was completed, we were quite glad that we had come.

To begin at the beginning, we were presented with excellent chewy Rosemary Sourdough Bread with Chardonnay & Feta Cheese Butter.  Mmmmm!  Delicious!  Sun-Dried Tomato Butter was also offered, but I was not as fond of it.

French Onion Soup that came next was good but small, and the cheesy top was not fully capped.  A small Wedge Salad with vibrant Cherry Tomato halves, Blue Cheese Crumbles, and a Blue Cheese Dressing was excellent.  After 2 quickly downed glasses of Iced Tea, my small glass was smartly exchanged by our server for a large globe.  But later, just as she was pouring me a refill from a pitcher, the very attentive waitress was suddenly bumped from behind by a plate deliverer, and I was doused with Iced Tea.  It was no big deal, and not our server's fault.  But the manager came over, gave me her card, and said that the restaurant would pay for any needed drycleaning of my shirt and pants.  I appreciated the gesture, but regular washing by Diane took care of the problem, with no lingering stains.  And, except for the splash, service was otherwise exemplary.

My medium-rare Filet was excellent although peppery, and the meaty Lobster Tail was large and sweet, as I had hoped it would be.  Requested Bearnaise Sauce for the steak was somewhat viscous and excellent.  And, Drawn Butter for the  crustacean was tasty until it grew cold.  The busy restaurant was out of warmers, announced our server apologetically.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms yielded a very good side, and so did a platter of thin buttered Green Beans mixed with quite a few slices of mushroom.  But had I known that these greens would come with mushrooms, I probably would not have ordered a side of mushrooms, as well.

We finished with Chocolate Lava Cake that came with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Whipped Cream.  It was a tasty end to a fine meal!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,4,4,il6ymGpfCjEAgFha3xYpeA
5840429,2018-04-15,0,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"Second visit was worst than first.  My wife and I celebrating our anniversary wanted a special night out at a fine restaurant.  What we got at Fleming's was a treatment, no treat.  We made reservations for 6:45p, showed up ten minutes early to ensure our seating on time.  When we arrived, we were told our table was being cleared and we would be seated in about ten minutes.  At 7:15, we were still waiting.  With the restaurant jam packed with people stacked at the bar, lounging in the entry way and packed in the dining room, it became obvious that reservations had been overbooked with little chance that anyone would be seated any time soon.  We left, sadder but wiser.  ""Fool me once, your fault.  Fool me twice, my fault.""",C4FSyd-6Vj_vnNVejGckEg,1,0,1,kimOVB50jmGZQ5maYecwbg

The cut could've been the best cut I have ever had of New York steak.  Zero stringiness in the cut!  The primest of prime!  The color of the pink was the same shade throughout: I was impressed with how consistent it was.  Steak cooked to perfection!  

I just wished Flemings was closer to the Strip... it was about 20 minutes driving at light speed.. =(",vNqJm3mlYnqxFrLBi_NViQ,3,3,5,dFyEyb9QoTgAOOijAe0EZA
5882812,2016-03-03,2,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I went here for Valentine's Day. Usually if I don't like a restaurant, I give it two stars. But for a $150 dinner and it's lacking quality I give it one.
We had a reservation, the valet was nice. We were seating promptly. It took about fifteen minutes to get our drinks ordered, and another fifteen to get our drinks. I got lemonade. It tasted like watery lemon juice. There was sugar around the rim, which is fancy, but I would've rather had it mixed in with my drink. I ordered the grilled chicken and my date had a steak. The steak was good, the grilled chicken lacked flavor but it had a good texture (except the giant chunk of fat I found in it). We also got French onion soup as an appetizer. Dear god am I glad we ordered it. Not that it was exceptionally tasty, it wasn't, but it took so long to get our food if they would've have brought out the soup I might've starved to death. I'm not sure if they're always that busy because this isn't the kind of place you can go to very often due to the prices. Now, the French onion soup, it was more like cheese with a little French onion soup. It took probably an hour after the soup to get our meat. Since I didn't like it much, I was really hoping dessert would redeem the night. We wanted to order a few desserts, but they were out of all of the ones we wanted. We ending up only getting the turtle pie and creme brûlée. The pie was sickeningly sweet. I couldn't take more than a bite. It had a good texture, but it seemed more like cake. If it had half the amount of sugar it would have been good. The creme brûlée was the highlight of the dinner but there are other places to get a bomb creme brûlée without paying $150 for bad service and a sub par dinner.
Overall, this place is totally overhyped. I guess the little scooper they use to clean the bread crumbs off of the table is good.",hPv5xh4cETVINMduWfLFVQ,1,0,1,XWzCYkCCpZrVW-DILOXFMg

The decor is standard upscale steakhouse white linen. Nothing stands out. 
I had 2 small plates- lamb chops and scallops. There were 3 mini lamb chops and 4 so-so scallops for $22 each. I'd say overpriced for small portions that didn't even register as 5 out of 10 for me. The veggies with the scallops were pretty sad, and the side with the lamb chops was a little better- fried bread/cheese sticks that were tastier than the veggies. My beet/tomato salad was good, and the side of cheese with it was very tasty. The bread was served with 2 cheese/butter hybrids, which were tastier than most of the food I had.

The server Bill was very helpful with the wine selection and I trusted his suggestions (he listened to what I was looking for and gave the perfection suggestion). We started off with a caesar salad which was the right amount of unique caesar dressing. We shared onion rings as well as the sauteed green beans with mushrooms (both amazing). He ordered the special bone in NY and I had the petite filet mignon. Both were mouth watering and cooked perfectly. We were too full to eat dessert (even though I wanted to). Bill brought out creme brulee with a candle and said we had to have dessert for our anniversary. This was the best creme brulee I have ever had! I must say, the staff was wonderful.

5928857,2013-03-12,1,JPWg9acsCv_om9UFYGMJbA,"I haven't been to Flemings for at least 2 years. The last time was in California at the Newport Beach location. It was a week before my birthday, and I still haven't decided where I wanted to eat dinner that night. At first I thought, maybe I'll look at restaurants on the strip. Then I told myself, on a Saturday? Hell no! Yes, I am one of those locals who avoid going to the strip as much as possible lol. I thought about Flemings and how I have never ate at this location, so I decided to make a reservation here. 

The first thing I noticed when we drove in was the valet. Seriously, does anyone else agree that the valet here is pointless? There are parking stalls very close to the restaurant and you don't have to walk far. Anyway, our reservation was at 5:00pm and we arrived about 15 minutes early so we decided to sit at the bar. They had iPad menus which you could use to browse the wine list and food options, which was pretty awesome. The bartender was friendly. She chatted with us for a bit and made us feel welcomed.

We were seated right at 5:00. The hostess asked us if we preferred black napkins because some people don't like the lint from the white napkins getting on their dark clothes. This was the first time I was given a napkin color option at a restaurant. We told her that the white ones were fine. The food was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon. Yes, its a pretty small steak, but I like to leave room for some sides and of course dessert for my birthday! My steak was cooked to perfection - mouth watering, easy to cut, juicy and full of flavor! I ordered a baked potato as my side because their Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese had scallions in it that were pre-mixed. :( Sorry, not a fan of onions, scallions, chives, etc. My husband enjoyed his Main Filet Mignon as well. He also ordered the grilled asparagus as a side, but didn't like the taste of it. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Lava Cake, which is always very delicious! It is a little rich, so its perfect for sharing.

30 minutes into our meal, we looked over at the bar, and it was packed! Happy Hour here at Fleming's must be very popular! They should really consider expanding the bar area to accommodate the large crowd. Service was very attentive and excellent. The manager even stopped by our table to wish me a happy birthday. At the end of our meal, our server gave me a complimentary box of truffles as my birthday treat. How nice! 

This place isn't cheap, but it was worth the money. I would definitely come back again in the future for a special occasion!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,2,5,pwDGjEBJac9Drp0KcE8GEw

We came for a work dinner during the holidays and the restaurant was packed for a Thursday night. We were seated quickly and service was beyond attentive despite the crowd. Refills were plentiful and our food was well-paced. 

We started with a handful of appetizers including the calamari and the pork belly, the pork belly being my favorite. For my entree I ordered a bone in ribeye and we shared one of each of the sides from the menu. The Femings potatoes, mushrooms and mac and cheese were among my favorites. My steak was perfectly cooked and enormous. I had to take more than half home with me since I was so full. 

Despite filling up on the first two courses, we powered on and ordered two chocolate lava cakes and they were delicious. Not overly sweet, the flavors  really complemented each other well.
