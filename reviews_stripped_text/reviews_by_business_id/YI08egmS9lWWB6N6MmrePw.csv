576510,2013-01-27,1,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"Hey everyone it's me Hungry Panda again with another review.
 O'Boy do i not want to write this one.. HAHA! I was nice enough and added a star from my original rating I planned on giving.

OK lets get this started from the top :)

Walking into this very CLEAN food joint, i thought to myelf. ""I can totally picture myself eating here on a bi-weekly bases"". It's so clean, lol, and then a friendly voice from behind the counter greeted me with a welcoming smile. JUST AWESOME!

FOOD KNOWLEDGE: After being the usual customer that can't decide anything (like what foot should i start my day off with today, left or right? hmm). HAHA, no but really though, i can be a real pain in the rear end when making a food decission. As i was this time, asking her from the type of meat, the sides included, what they use in sauces and if the sauces were tossed or mixed together. OMGosh she nailed every question I asked with answers beyond my expectations and with a friendly warm smile. Now IDK what most of your opinions are on human energy and vibes or what not. BUTT! This employee hands down deserved a raise. She knew it all, she explained everything in detail with confidence. I'm sorry to drag that out so long, but people I seriously eat out a bunch. Service to me can make me return to a food joint even if i didnt care for the food itself. As you will soon notice :)

FOOD I ATE: Combination, of course the bigger of the plates. Panda serving sizes are always bigger duhh :) Anyways: Chicken Katsu, Orange Chicken, White Rice, Mac Salad.Now lets review backwards; 
Mac Salad: Usually not a big fan, but it was yummy. More because it wasn't drowning in mayo and had a good balance of pepper to it. above average for sure :)
White Rice: Very poor. it's so hard for me to believe people still cook rice and serve it dry, UGH :( so disaponting.
Chicken Katsu: Couldn't tell if it was dark or white meat, either way it also was dry. Even with the Katsu sauce provided on the side (the way i like) it tasted so bland for something fried. Hmm still boggles my mind how that is so. hmm :/
Orange chicken: Looked amazing, smaller sized than most other places and gave it a new impressive look for orange chicken everywhere. BUTT! omgosh people! So dry and bland once again. the nice crisp outside with a orange glaze was good. But don't you know it;s whats on the inside that counts the most. Practically empty in the middle. 

WILL I RETURN?: If someone I'm around really wants to go there then yes I will go give it another shot. ONLY because service was much appreciated, and the service saved you from a 2 star. PFF!. Honestly though, waste of my time and money. All you folks out there rating 5 stars on a ""fast food type"" of place. You have given into to the amercan-izing of traditional cultured food. DO NOT attempt to tell me that its decent for the price or for the fast food enviorment. It's really not, and it makes me sad that people pretty much devour anything now a days and say its quality. We must not eat to get full, we eat to feed our hunger. Our hunger must have standards, smell, appearance, texture, then most important, taste. I'd rather eat one palm of quality food versus a large to go box of imitated food thats not good for you anyways. Take off your fat boy eyes and put on your thinking caps, welcome to Panda101 :)

1479314,2013-04-25,0,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"Used to be our favorite go to spot for a quick dinner after work, but starting to think otherwise. 

We used to order once, if not twice, a week on the way home from work, but my fiance hadn't been feeling it for the past month. I never asked her why, just figured maybe it was too much of a good thing, as the spicy chicken bowl is awesome. So last night I call in the order so that I can pick it up on the way home, per the usual. When I arrive, the girl who took the order over the phone also rang me up, as there was no other girl in the building. She brings out what looks to be 3 to go orders, one of which looks to me like 2 Spicy Chicken bowls, and sets them on the counter near the cooks. At the time, only another walk-in couple had ordered and nobody else was there. After about 5 minutes, a family comes in and she takes their order as the guy filling the sauce calls for the walk-in couple to give them their order. 

Seeing as they ordered their meal after I paid for my call in order, I thought something was awry. The guy looked at me and asked for my name, which I gave him, and he handed me the bag that had been just sitting there for 5 minutes, which she could have just handed me as she walked out. Since we are still a ways from the location, by the time I got home, the food was luke warm at best. I begin to tell my fiance about my experience and before I can finish, she tells me the reason she hadn't wanted TM was because she experienced the exact same thing. Same girl, same food on the counter that she could have just handed over seeing as she both took the order and rang it up upon arrival, same luke warm chicken bowls and all. Turns out the reason she wasn't wanting TM wasn't because she didn't like the food anymore, but because seeing your food sit there and nobody so much as calling out the order is plain frustrating. 

Had she not told me that she had experienced the exact same thing, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, maybe just a one off bad experience. But the same thing, same person, same place tells me there is something wrong. With the opening of a number of new places in the area due to the Waterpark opening, I'm sure we can find another go to spot for a quick dinner pick up, which sucks since the food is great.",4Zh7oMVw1V_lGwj7qKahHA,1,0,2,beMs6Bu6cV27FxcIegjPQA

It has ample parking in a developing shopping complex with a modern urban/diner vibe upon entry amongst the silence of the majority of empty tables on a Saturday afternoon.

Their sides are satisfactory, but nothing special, since I ordered the shrimp tempura and it tasted more like the fried breading than the shrimp itself with an overly sweet dipping sauce. So, I would recommend sticking to their main entrees since those will rarely disappoint in portion size or quality. The meat given is equal to amount of rice and vegetables and their yakisoba though it isn't necessarily an item bursting with flavor despite the larger size of the meat as the flavor that does come from it is quite generic. I ordered the tofu with yakisoba, chicken and beef teriyaki and neither of them amazed but they did satisfy me for the equivalent of two meals.",Gkp1pdWALMLG7WjCN6GM5A,0,0,4,Ge0c6W2KoqoSgfKhjkOwCA

Got a buy one get one free deal so i decided on a chicken plate and yakisoba. The co-owner was very nice through the whole ordering process and threw in a free macaroni salad for my first visit.

The food didnt meet my expectations but was very good. I was expecting a lot more flavors and assumed that if i got a plate it would at least come with some vegetables other then just meat and grain. Anyway lets break this down:

Brown rice
Cooked perfectly had a very nice texture

Chicken
Had really nice grilled taste seeing how it's grilled, the sauce was just poured over. Was expecting a lot more but the tasted of grilled meat with a sauce that complements it just shut me up and made me enjoy my food.

Vegetable Yakisoba
More like a chow mein then yakisoba. most likely would never order again.

came out fresh and quick (maybe 5min if that) hand delivered by the nice cashier, and wife loved the way the spicy teri ckn tasted ""really grilled"". our kids also finished the chicken katsu. the portions were pretty good sized, definitely filled us up. next time we're back in town, we're coming back and bringing our friends with us !!

Besides I was looking for something healthy for post workout meal. Really is there anything better then chicken teriyaki bowl? Ok probably there is but enjoy my chicken and rice! I decided too try the spicy chicken with white rice (they do offer brown rice or noodles as substitutes) and order side of vegetables too. The portion size I was surprised since for  the most part Teriyaki Madness its japanese fast food. You get healthy portion of chicken!! The chicken was cooked on point nice moist with nice grilled marks on the outside. It had little kick too it. Really not much but then again I like spicy food. I really enjoyed the vegetables. Found unlike other places they have better variety of vegetables then your standard broccoli, carrots, or cabbage any combination. Unlike standard teriyaki you can tell take time too saute everything in pan well seasoned not steamed bland vegetables. The mac salad honestly was failure too me. I am just use too local plate lunch style mac salad. Unfortunately this different style just not for me. 

Apparently they just renovated the whole interior of the restaurant. You can tell fresh coat of paint all around, and guess the counter area changed it up. Not that big of place but have plenty of seating options inside. I find it interesting tight fit all the tables were from one another. Every table has separate condiments (nice one of them is siracha). They have one television inside if need entertainment. 

The staff there is really friendly. They did great job of explaining things too me being first time. Overall really enjoyed it! If looking for an inexpensive meal for lunch or dinner. Teriyaki Madness great choice! They offer lot more stuff on the menu besides your teriyaki bowls. Sure can count on me coming back for more...",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,1,4,QrdLUtc9S2N2D_XXOyiejQ

I used to go to samurai Sam's but the one near my work closed at random. That obviously didn't make me too happy but after trying Terryaki Madness I wasn't sad for long. I love that you can customize your bowl and they have a variety of different options including some Hawaiian dishes. It's always clean and smells good in the restaurant in the bathrooms believe it or not look great. That's a very important thing! What that tells me is that they do not only pay great attention to their food, but they also pay a lot of attention to the ancillary things that other restaurants let go. After the gym this is a protein in carb pack power lunch. Great for energy and increasing your metabolism! I highly recommend it especially for health goers. The only thing that I would try to find out is do they sell organic? Is there food non-GMO? That's important for me so I hope I get the answers I'm looking for.

Terryaki Madness has a variety of locations across the city. And they were voted the best of Las Vegas. Check them out! I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",pkyX-J7RvQVIvFTZJKtpEQ,1,2,4,HgeMOJqx5xmyFH8c5SHJlQ

We ordered two Yakisoba entrees (about $8 ea.), 6 pieces of gyoza ($3), and two large drinks to go. I'm glad we came in when we did (12:15pm) because, just a few minutes after we ordered, they had their lunch rush and the line got very long. We just had to wait about 5 minutes for our food and they gave us lots of containers, so we could load up on Sriracha. They included forks, teriyaki and gyoza sauce, lots of napkins, and chopsticks in our to go bag. When we got home and took out our entrees, the first thing I noticed was how large the portions were. The Yakisoba was put in an average white Styrofoam container, but it was PACKED with the noodles; More than enough for lunch AND dinner. There were lots of grilled chicken pieces and zucchini, which I loved. I'll admit, it wasn't oozing with flavors or anything, but it tasted delicious after I dumped some Sriracha and teriyaki sauce on it. I really loved the Gyoza though. So fresh and so perfectly cooked with a nice little crisp on the outside. For less than 3 bucks for 6 pieces, it's quite a deal. Our whole meal for the both of us came out to $16 because of the coupon I had. If I ever came back, I'd probably stick to getting just a bowl though, unless I'm going to share because the plates/entrees are very large.

The bowl itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the beef was decent, veggies were okay, and it seemed the highlight of the meal was there teriyaki sauce which was quite good. The Shrimp Tempura app wasn't bad, came with four pieces and had it's own dipping sauce. Overall my experience could only be summed up as mediocre with a long wait to start it all off. If I had known it was going to take so long I would have walked across the parking lot to Taco Bell for my appetizer.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,1,1,2,5y0ZMgnWgCEQaRVmDjVcag

It's very flavorful and has the perfect amount of smokiness to it. I love carbs, and I'm very picky when it comes to rice. I love how they don't use cheap, Chinese rice. Their white rice makes it even better to eat. I've also had their brown rice. It's really good. I bought a sack of brown rice, and I can never cook it the way they do. :( What I also love about them is their flexibility. They'll pretty much make it just the way you want it, and I'm a very picky girl. One last thing, their salad that comes with the plate is sooooo good. I've never had that type of dressing anywhere else. The lettuce is always fresh, and I am willing to eat it all day everyday. 

One last thing, their service is always awesome. The owners are very kind. One time, they were out of water cups when I asked for one. He told me they didn't have any more water cups so he just gave me one of those cups you get when you buy a drink. How nice of him! I was honest. Swear I only got water. :)

The food can be a little pricey at about $9 a plate but they send you some awesome deals via text message alerts so today we got the buy one plate, get one plate free with drink purchases. So our bill came out to $20 vs $30. Not a bad deal at all. 

The Chicken Katsu was perfectly fried and flavored and the brown rice was of good quality. Didn't care too much for the macaroni salad side. It was kind of small and didn't have much flavor. I did enjoy the Chicken Gyoza but added some soy sauce to the Gyoza sauce because it was a little too sweet for my liking. 

My hubby got the Spicy Chicken, it was very good. I loved the flavor. The noodles were a yummy side too. The stir fry veggie side, though, could've used some more flavor.

3636322,2017-12-14,0,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"1STAR REVIEW UPDATE!!

So recently I came here and had a horrible experience. Mind that I am a regular teriyaki madness customer. Maybe not so much at this location. But I do come here at the very least once a week. Because this is the closest location from my home. So anyways, I had a horrible bowl made about a week ago or so. Or I thought was horrible. But after making my 1 star rant/review. On yelp. The owner of this location, Randy, had messaged me about it. And after going back and forth with him. Instead of just taking me as a bad customer and writing me off as a loss, he went seeking for a solution...

A couple days later, he messaged me saying He was using a different chicken that the other location that I go to almost every day was using. Keep in mind guys it's just an update that the fairly location Sahara/Decatur was already using.. He went forward and figured the problem out by calling the owner Robert at the Sahara/Decatur location just to find out what was going on Causing me to think that the bowl wasn't cooked fresh, etc... 

So the end result keeping this review as short as possible. I have to give it out to Randy for taking that step to figure out what was going on and fixing the issue I was having. He took care of the bill for my dinner tonight, saying I had to go try out the new updated chicken that all locations are now using. Just so he had my approval of satisfaction... *People don't like the wait times...* BUT I have to say everything on the menu is cooked FRESH. Therefore, everything tastes amazing!! So give the waiting times some slack because the couple extra minutes you wait, I guarantee you will be worth it! Also hopefully Randy doesn't kill me for saying this, but they are giving the option to add avocado to the bowls/plates in the beginning of 2018!! Now that's the cherry on top to the amazing food they already serve! Please if you haven't ever tried TERIYAKI MADNESS. Please give this place a try! You won't ever look back!! 

PS: don't expect Randy to take care of your bill... because there is nothing else to complain about after reading my review. lol",GjatDQpTIcd2VvugVeiJaA,1,2,5,QerG_muxfNdscOfwd-OWwg
3652402,2015-09-21,2,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"Teriyaki places have never been my favorite. Because my wife loves them, however, I have to eat at them quite frequently.  I'm thrilled to have found a a restaurant that not only makes her happy, but I enjoy as well.

I'm addicted to hot and spicy food. More often than not, I will be happy with a place as long as my food is tasty and makes me sweat from the level of spice. Teriyaki Madness has this going for it.  You can request your food to be extra spicy and they will fulfill this wish, unlike most places that give the option. The spicy teriyaki chicken ordered extra spicy comes out fiery red. It doesn't seem hot at first but it quickly builds to extremely hot with each bite.

Probably my favorite aspect of this place is the freshness. Teriyaki Madness delivers the convenience of Asian fast food Asian restaurants like Panda Express, with the quality of a full service dine-in place.

This location is usually wonderful. Only once has my order been messed up, but nothing too serious. Food just about always comes out steaming hot, so I can't really complain about anything.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,3,1,4,mE0mJ-N7etgcgZ2rEcN5mA

I ordered the same dish I always get, grilled chicken breast, to go. Got home started eating and this time I take a bite into the chicken...UNCOOKED AGAIN! Maybe it was just that one piece, nope, every bite of the next 7 pieces was the same. My husbands chicken was the same as mine, uncooked!

I call and ask to speak to the manager and I get some lady who's accent is so heavy she barely understands me. After 5 minutes of going back and forth she says to 'bring food back and they'll cook me another one'. Why should I have to drive ALL the way back because of your mistake? I tell her I am unable to do that. She then tells me she'll call her boss to see if she can do a refund. She calls me back much later and says ok I can come down there to pick up my money....I paid by card...I'm not going to drive down there for the cash when they can void the sale and/or credit the card back. (I know for a fact this is doable because I worked in restaurants from 10+years) I told her I wasn't going to drive down there and just to void or credit the card back. She says OK, no problem.

Fast forward a week...still charged my card. I call and speak to the manager, Robert, and tell him the situation. He proceeds to repeat himself and talk to me like I'm the idiot. He tells me he will give me a discount on the next meal. Are you serious? He says he will not refund my money because I didn't leave the house and bring the food down there. What a piece of work. I ask to speak to his boss and he directs me to the teriyaki madness website. He wouldn't provide me with any phone number. And then he hangs up on me.

It's a little difficult to find, as Google Maps puts it on the wrong intersection.  But, if you're not as map-deficient as I am, it shouldn't be too difficult (it's right near the Taco Bell).  

I got the Chicken Teriyaki plate with the macaroni salad.  I was expecting a LOT of food since the website says the portions are generous.  The macaroni salad, however, was in a very tiny cup - prior to opening it, in fact, I mistook it for soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.  

Quality of food was good, but was not exceptional, either.  The chicken was well-prepared.  The rice was a bit dry on the outside, but sticky in the middle, as if it had been sitting for a while.

I go in not knowing the menu and had no idea how to order my food all I knew was that I wanted teriyaki chicken anyways. The cashiers name was Juan. I start to order the teriyaki plate & he asks me, would you like noodles or steamed rice. I replayed steamed rice.... So Juan goes okay what kind of steamed rice (with an attitude) so at first i thought okay maybe I should have known they made all kinds of rice??  after getting it all cleared. He then asked what will be your side? I didn't know what I could chose so I asked him what were my options & once again with an attitude tell me ughhh it's up their (pointing at the menu on the wall) saying right where it says sides! I looked at him & told him oh okay ty for being a Fucked smart ass. How rude it was obvious that it was my first time & he was just so horrible.  Not to mention that he also couldn't listen. when my food was ready they kept calling a Maria!?!?! & I finally went up and asked what the food was & yes of course it was my order!!!!

They have no-carb and low-carb options, when I'm actually being healthful, and they have the best goddamn Crab Rangoons in the city. I could eat those by the bucket.

My go-to meal is the katsu bowl with white rice and veggies, and it's pretty much chicken, rice, and veggies in equal portion. Let me reiterate that. It's a bowl, and it's not 80% rice. 33% chicken, 33% rice, 33% vegetable. Mind. Blown. 

The people are always friendly, and the service is fast, which makes it a perfect spot for a comfortable lunch. Take out and Eat in both cause equally few problems, and I can usually eat for under $10.

Pros;
- Good food, good folk, good pace, good prices.

5053688,2011-08-10,0,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"I'd have to say that Teriyaki Madness is one of the better Teriyaki fast food joints around.  They offer a variety of meats (chicken, pork, beef teriyaki, chicken katsu, orange chicken).  The food isn't really authentic Asian or anything, but it sure beats Panda Express!

My favs here are the beef and chicken teriyaki.  They say they grill everything to perfection and they're sort of right?  Everything is always cooked pretty good!  It's never dry and very flavorful.  Their teriyaki sauce is really good and is the perfect consistency.  I also like getting their mac salad.  It's better than just getting a plain garden lettuce salad on the side.  

If you trying to eat healthy, this is a pretty good option for a quick meal.  Just get the chicken breast, sauce on the side, brown rice and veggies.  Done!

I also love their gyoza's.  They are kind of small, but not a bad deal for less than 3 bucks.

Their plates are around 7-8 bucks and their bowls around 6.  Quality food, but kind of pricey.  It can kind of add up if you try customizing your meal with the brown rice, veggie add ons, etc.  The portions aren't exactly huge or anything - each plate is just enough for one person IMO.  So for 2 people, you're looking to spend at least 20 bucks for dinner which is kind of a lot for fast food.  If not for the price I would give it one more star!

This particular location on Warm Springs is pretty nice compared to the one I used to frequent on Eastern and Maryland.  Its clean and the service is quick and nice.

I met a friend here over Spring Break.  It is pretty far from where I live and there are other Teriyaki Madness Restaurants that are closer to my side of town.  But, it was a great drive on a beautiful day so I was able to take advantage of the weather and my car stereo.

It was easy to find and the parking was easy.  I hate it when I have to circle a parking lot to find a spot.  

I walk in and see my friend then we headed up to the counter to order.  I had the low carb chicken bowl.  It was full of, obviously, chicken, broccoli and other veggies.  Everything was well cooked.  The broccoli was crisp, which I love.  I hate soggy veggies.  The place was no frills and comfortable.  The seating arrangements were nice.

People that ordered multiple items after we ordered 2 items got their food before us, and had almost finished eating by the time I got upset enough to walk up and ask if our food was almost done... the kids response ""I don't know"" and nonchalantly walked over to where the food was being cooked and just fkn stood there looking at the cooks cooking... didn't say anything to me... just kept standing there... didn't apologize for the 30 minute wait. Nothing. Then as I was talking to my wife about it, he starts laughing and mumbling under his breath. I'll never be coming back here. 

My first review was somehow removed... possibly by the owner... who knows... but I'm reposting this one. And I'll continue to repost if it continues to get removed.",N1SRDhbaevbQZc0NleHUCA,1,0,1,87ZVnf97LYEOTgUrpgURZw
5800335,2013-03-25,1,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"We came to Teriyaki Madness for the first time on 3/23/2013. My first impression of the place was good it smells great even from the outside and the dining area is very clean. The only thing that was a bit awkward was the ""line area"" because at 3 people waiting to order the line was already to the door I'd hate to see what a busy day is like. The menu seemed fairly simple and straight forward you can get a bowl of rice (steamed, fried, brown)with your choice of meat and with veggies or a ""yakisoba"" basically noodles instead of rice veggies and your choice of meat. 

We ordered the Chicken Katsu Plate, a Yakisoba shrimp and chicken plate, 1 vegetable eggroll an order of Shrimp Tempura (comes in a 4 or 6 option) and 2 drinks. The total came out to 31.92 which for teriyaki I thought was a bit pricey but the place was packed and it definitely seemed like it may be worth it. The one thing that did stand out to me about the ambiance was that it felt as if I was at a protein bar at an athletic club since everyone was in track suits, jump suits, or just plain gym attire. I wasn't sure if I was ""fit"" enough to b dining here lol.

The food did take a long time to come out and I noticed that if you order your food to go it seems to come out quicker than if you simply order to dine in. I saw at least 3-4 people that placed their orders after I placed mine and they were delivered their food before I had mine. It couldn't have been that my meal was that difficult to make as it seemed like they were handing out similar trays to what I received when my food finally arrived. 

The cashier was kind enough to bring out the egg rolls and shrimp tempura order to the table and stated to us that the food would be out shortly. The food was ready about 3-4 minutes after the egg rolls came out and I went to pick the order up at the pickup window. The chicken katsu was good and tasted decent the sauce did have almost a hint of bbq ketchup id say which was quite delicious. The chicken katsu plate was fried chicken sauce and rice. The Yakisoba plate was a mixture of noodles with vegetables like broccoli cabbage and carrots. The chicken was tasteful and had a hint of char to it which was great. The shrimp on the other hand was chewy and was very very over cooked I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber eraser. The eggroll was great and the shrimp tempura was delicious.

Definitely was a great experience and will be making a prompt return. I will probably say ""NAY"" to the shrimp though.",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,3,2,3,E_iNNx5wAuFWcK8whRkIRQ
5805838,2009-01-07,0,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,"This is one of those random places that I crave constantly. I get the chicken breast with brown rice or sometimes mix it up with their noodles. You can add veggies, too. You can really create whatever you want with the meat, carb and veggie options-- a great place to suit numerous taste buds. 

The meat is hot, the flavor is simple, fresh and the tangy teriyaki sauce is perfect.  The prices are terribly reasonable and they're quick, so it's perfect for lunch or grabbing dinner on the way home. 

In fact, I think I'm going to go grab some lunch from them now....",eCjQpniDmsnw3Hc9qP0ASw,1,0,5,t6G9WPkVvPBBiYD0orF_qQ

I have already tried the chicken (my favorite so far), the spicy chicken, the beef, the pork, and the yakisoba.....all are freakin' fabulous and tasty.

Definitely not the cheapest in town but under 10 bucks for brown rice and a healthy serving of chicken breast? Yes please.,imUgKz_a1y8gWkDw8btwgA,0,0,4,30gpumbFNXfBIHB87JRAQw

The first thing I noticed is the big Sriracha bottles on all of he tables, at that point I had a good feeling about the experience we were going to have.

My sweet hunk of love man had gotten a free bowl coupon for his birthday so it was an Awesome opportunity to come in and give it a whirl.

I decided on the Chicken Katsu bowl which is a Japanese breaded chicken deep-fried to a crispy golden, served with their signature katsu sauce.

My honey ordered the Spicy Chicken which is chicken teriyaki stir-fried in a hot & spicy sauce. He loves spicy so that for sure did the trick in the spicy and flavor department.

The food was fresh and tasty and they are nice sized bowls because I had to take half of mine home.

I noticed that the store is very clean, everything is wok cooked fresh and the quality is pretty decent. We enjoyed our meal and the unlimited self serve drink refills so we will be back for sure.

*********************************************************************************************
My only gripe is the grumpy guy with zero personality at the counter as he was a real joy kill. This place is too good to have a young guy behind the counter turning people off with his "" I hate my job and the world"" attitude. I will keep my fingers crossed until my next visit and hope he was just having a bad day. If I encounter him again and he is the same I will make sure to make note of his name and post it in my next review!

5850997,2015-06-29,0,YI08egmS9lWWB6N6MmrePw,Normally I am a huge fan of teriyaki madness however not so much with this location. my husband and I have dined here often since moving to the south west side of town but we have found that the quality of their beef is not as great as at the Blue Diamond location. Our last two visits to this location left us unsatisfied with the food that we had ordered so we have stopped dinning here almost completely at this point. Instead we shell out a few extra bucks and frequent a similar establishment on the same corner. Im giving this 3 stars because the chicken is usually good and the price is resonable. Unfortunately for me though I'm a beef fan so the chicken being the only recommendable item doesn't do anything for me.,1XwTUZxhh8rHqU7xNBOMkw,2,1,3,Ns3Xji12m_qTKT6GP4lVRQ

The spicy chicken is definitely spicy - lots of flavor in the sauce.  Service was great, prices were a little high for what you get.
