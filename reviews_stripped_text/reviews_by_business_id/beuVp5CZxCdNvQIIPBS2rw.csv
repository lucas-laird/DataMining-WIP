The food was good, we were all impressed with the setup of the conveyer belt, and I was excited to recommend this restaurant to my family who I thought would enjoy it. I really wish I got the name of our waitress because what she did completely turned me off from ever wanting to step foot in there again. We were thanking our waitress as we were walking out and I did not think much of it that she did not really acknowledge us. But she kept trying to look past me over towards our table and I had a feeling she was looking for tip money, which was placed under the receipt. My group of friends were saying our goodbyes outside when our waitress comes out and what she does just BLOWS. MY. MIND. She starts demanding more money because she is not satisfied with her tip. She just stood there holding up the receipts and did not want to leave until she revived more money. All of us were completely shocked that she had the nerve to chase us down and harass us about a tip. Tip is not mandatory, so where does one get the nerve to be that unappreciative and ask for more? And why would anyone even think they deserved or would get more after acting that way?! The tip amount was good and fair for the service provided. Our group was not skimping out on the money. Even if we left nothing it would not be okay for her to do that. Our group should have talked to a manager but we all just wanted to leave. This was not acceptable behavior and I hope this is not the standard for how their staff treats customers.

I really created this yelp account just to share this bad experience. That's how much it bugged me.",5KGcM4cOH1VykonYofaEdQ,2,0,1,LBV_e9wu8VxSddAzLUuxrQ

220366,2017-11-26,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"First time in, on a Saturday night, with a party of ten people.

I was excited to try this place. We were looking for some good hotpot, and this place lived up to even my unrealistic expectations.

Pretty straightforward. It is NOT ""all you can eat"" so you pay per item. This is fine though, because it seems that the quality of meat is usually better when it's not AYCE. With larger parties, they said they only had the option of individual hotpots, which worked out just fine. They also recommended that we get different meat and veggie combo platters to share with the table. This also turned out to be a great option for sharing so everyone could try something different.

Since I don't eat pork, I always tend to go for the vegetarian soup base option at places like this. Most of their soup bases are made from a beef & pork mixed broth, including their House and Hellishly Spicy. So I couldn't try those. But they did have an Oxtail base, which was all beef, and two vegetarian options (Mushroom and Tomato). I tried the mushroom pot and it was about as tasty as you could expect. I got great feedback from the table that all the different bases were spiced well and added good flavor. The Hellishly Spicy pot came in level 6, 12, and 18 (essentially mild, medium, and hot). To put it in perspective, my fiance is Vietnamese and can handle really spicy stuff (more than me), but the level 12 (medium) was a little much for her.

We shared the beef combo, which consisted of brisket, ribeye, and Japanese wagyu. This was a great option for two slightly hungry people to share, if you plan to add veggies.  If you're both pretty hungry, you may need a little more. We got the large udon noodles that were supposedly good for two people, but we found ourselves ordering a second one. Some of the table added lamb, shrimp, the veggie combo and mushroom basket. 

The sauce station was good, though they regularly ran out of the small bowls, and we had to ask for them a few times. I mixed the ponzu with some chili paste and fresh green onions, and this was a delicious addition to the dish. 

For everyone, the bill was about $350 after tax and tip. About $35 per person, which is comparable to AYCE anyway. Not bad. 

Service was decent. It was a very busy night, so I can't fault them completely, but it did seem like they were a little irritated when we asked questions or needed things.

As expected in most of the Chinatown plazas on a Friday or Saturday, parking was a nightmare. I would recommend getting here at least 10-15 minutes early to make your reservation. 

Overall four stars. It was definitely above average.",xAGAy6XHcRjkDz_dQKkguA,0,0,4,HY1n2TLopUrDYSB_N4Rw7g

257101,2016-11-24,2,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Very warm and friendly restaurant. I called in advance to check seating, and was greeted by a kind employee who assured me that my belly was not about to go hungry that night(hehe). Upon arriving there, she thanked us for calling in advance. How nice of her to remember! 

I was reccommended to this place by a friend, and I was no doubt satisfied. In Las Vegas there are basically no conveyor belt restaurants, but Chubby Cattle happened to be an exception! I still wish this included sushi as well though. Anyways, on to the good stuff. This restaurant is hot pot-based, with the side dishes rotating around on a motorized conveyor belt. I LOVE IT. Different dishes have different prices usually ranging from $1-$4 I believe, but its all pretty affordable. I ordered the house pot, which tasted like mushroom or chicken broth, which was delicious. From the conveyor belt, I decided to take sliced beef, tteokbokki(korean rice cakes), chopped spam, spinach, and what looked like buckwheat noodles. All of these made a delicious combination. The only thing to watch out for, is the temperature of the soup. When you aren't cooking the ingredients, make sure to deactivate the heater, or else you are in for quite the tongue-searing ride. 

Between this and Pho, I would definitely choose hotpot. Why so? Hot pot is customizable, and can be heated right from your table. This plus the conveyor belt truly ended off my shopping trip with a bang. If you are coming to eat here, make sure to bring some friends! If you don't, then have no fear; there is a bar-like seating area for those who are riding solo. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!",-GrtuMXZVLL3oWmZYM7XAw,2,2,5,5cnG58ZgiZnJlawb5itz8w

First let me start off that we had a party of 8, when we arrive they tell us they do not have a table to seat us together. We are disappointed but nonetheless we wanted to try it out so we agree. But we are at two separate tables. As our waiter keeps ""asking and waiting"" for people from the other table, and I ask him ""why?"" He's like you're on one check plus 20% gratuity for 6 or more people. I explain that I understand but we are not even sitting together, why would be getting charged together, then I explicitly state TWO checks. His manager, says thats fine. Well our food came our delayed, he never came to check on us, and never refilled our water. He was too busy caring for his two large parties who came after we did and left before us. We FINALLY get the check and guess what?! Wow one bill, then obviously irritated and upset with the poor service we received we did not tip him well, he actually has the nerve to make comment about it!!! Apparently he didn't keep track of who ordered what, of course.

Lastly I will say this, the food isn't that great. Conveyor belt is a fun idea, small portions and expensive. I will not return and my net promoter score would be negative!",itOFYby5IutSiW0rLukKog,1,0,1,VrQshXcnNXVwGl_BNjWB0g

Chubby Cattle is my new favorite hot pot spot.  Everything was fabulous, and I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because there are only a few opportunities for improvements.  
The mushroom basket, sea bass special, and Beef & Lamb plate were totally worth it.  I did find bones in the sea bass, though.  I don't recommend the Veggie Plate unless you really like lettuce and cabbage; you're better off picking up greens from the conveyor belt.  
Deni, our Server, was really communicative and great at walking us through the menu.

The soup comes with free refills though! I ordered their oxtail soup, which is now mixed with their tomato base, and found that the tomato flavor was a little overpowering (good for people who like their soups sour I guess). The mushroom and original soups, on the other hand, were perfect and had the right depth of flavor.

TABLES: You have the option to sit at a table with one large pot for everyone to share or you can sit at a table with many small pots for each individual to have their own (you'll have to let the host know before you sit down so they can give you the right table). Private rooms are also available. Make reservations or come after 9pm because this place gets packed!

ASSEMBLY LINE: In the center tables, there is a refrigerated assembly line of food the goes around a large portion of the restaurant. Customers have the options to open the refrigerator sliding doors to get the food right at their table. The food items are priced based on the plate color. My advice, stick to the menu, nothing from the assembly line is good.

SAUCE STATION: In the center of the restaurant, there is a sauce station for you to create your own sauce. I was amazed by the variety of their sauces. The peanut butter sauce is my favorite!

HOT POT/FONDUE: For hot pot, you have many options from the menu. It first we though it was going to be over priced, but after looking at the menu and seeing the portions they gave us, it was actually a pretty decent price for the food and experience. SOUP BASE: For the soup based, choose the tomato soup or the spicy soup. Avoid the mushroom soup! MEAT OPTIONS: For meats, you have to try the mouthwatering brisket. They recommended the rib eye, but it's no where near as good. For the meats, they are freshly slice to order. SEAFOOD OPTIONS: Now the seafood, if you want to try it, go for it, but my opinion, stay away from ordering seafood, it's not that good. I had the seafood special, it was very pretty in presentation, but nothing was good on it. You can also order the seafood individually. SPOON OPTIONS: They have various, meats and seafoods served on a spoon that you'll cook in your hot pot. It looks pretty, but it's a waste of money. VEGGIE OPTION: We got a veggie basket that included all the different veggies and it was really good. You can also order the veggies seperately.

DRINKS: They have a full bar if you want something to pair with your hot pot. The hot tea is served in a genie like pot. They offer various fresh juice. The mango juice was really good!

SKEWERS: They really advertise the skewers, but it's not that special. I'd advise just sticking to the hot pot.

DESSERT: THEIR ICE CREAMS ARE SO GOOD AND THERE ARE REALLY GOOD FLAVORS.

SERVICE: The host/manager Alex is extremely friendly, very organized, and hard working. He really makes his customers' dining experience a great one. Our waiter Kevin, was very diligent and he really knew the menu well. However, Kevin has the tendency to talk to you while you're eating and sometimes, he needs to give his customers the opportunity to eat. Everything was organized and it was a fun and relaxing experience. After coming back to this place, I have to say Matthew is my favorite server:)",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,10,5,5,flo_rbaey3_dJJ2HiGcTWg

Once you select your base, you can visit the sauce bar to make up your own blends for enhancing your finished cooked items.

their ""original"" broth is flavorful and their ""hell"" broths are great!

All in all, a great restaurant in terms of the food.  Minus the one star because the server we had spoke too quickly, mumbled a lot, and called us (4 guys in the party), all ""bro"".  A lot.  like every few words.  Listen, I'm not your ""bro"".  Until I spoke Chinese to the waiter (towards the end of the meal), he did not seem too keen on offering good service.  I hope they address this training issue.

I called the restaurant asking how long the wait was for four people and David replied 40 minutes. I asked if I could put my name down as we were coming from the hotel, and he happily noted yes and I got a text confirmation. When we got to the restaurant about 20 minutes later, we checked in and he noted that the wait was about 40 minutes... I didn't understand how the wait did not go down since it had already been 20 minutes. We waited for another 20 minutes and he was not able to give us a time estimate. He noted 40 minutes.. I may not be a mathematician but 20 plus 20 plus 40 minutes is not close to the original wait time of 40 minutes...

The staff is a joke. There were 3 girls there trying to help and all they decided to do was look at their system and then give an extremely random time estimate. There were multiple parties ahead of us- one party waited for almost two hours when the original wait time was an hour. A few other parties had reservations and were still waiting. David was too busy fixing his Santa hat and taking selfies and snaps of himself in the restaurant instead of helping the guests that were there.

We were a party of four and there were two sets of tables with four openings and no one decided to seat any parties. We let them know and then they went back to their computer system to see if it would magically tell them what to do. It obviously didn't.

1409473,2016-08-19,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"My friends and i had decided to come here on a Thursday evening to try it out since it has been highly anticipated for a long while. We had heard rumors of Little Sheep styled Hot Pot would come to vegas and this was supposed to be it.

My friends had arrived earlier and had been told that it will be about an hour wait for the tables next to the conveyor belt because it is almost purely reservations ONLY and there was an opening in an hour. My friend had put her phone number down and we went to District One for a snack. About 1 hour later, we returned. The hostess states she tried calling and the phone number did not work. Another friend looked at the number and tried calling. Worked perfectly fine. Does the hostess know how to call out of state numbers on a land-line? Does she know how to use a phone? She doesnt seem to be much experienced on customer service as her attitude towards customers is very poor. No apology or excuse. Just chugged along like a headless chicken. 

We waited another 10 minutes in the cramped space by the entrance with others coming in through the door squeezing behind and in front of us before we were taken to our table, which was still incompletely set up. The person setting up apologized for the incomplete setup, which was appreciated as it was not his fault we were taken to an incomplete table. 

We sat around for 10 minutes before our server came up, asked for our drink orders, and brought us 1 menu. The menu's are designed non-traditionally and mounted to a paddle. So holding it is a bit weird. 

While deciding on what to order, the waiter had asked us what soup bases we would like. But he said the house original and house spicy were out and only mushroom, seafood, and tomato were available. We had almost got up and walked out. The manager had came  up and said it would be ready in 10 minutes, if we were willing to wait. So we did. We had asked the server what the difference in size was between what was going around the conveyor belt, the combos in the menu, and the separate orders. He had to go get the manager to help us. The manager told us the difference was 5 oz and 10 oz for combo. The asian in us were highly confused as the math totally did not add up. It was about $11 for the lamb shoulder and beef brisket, as told to us by the waiter which the combo consisted, but it was about $17 for the combo. HUH!? An order had came to the ""window"" and he had showed us the size. It was a large plate with lamb shoulder piled high and he said it was a single lamb shoulder order. We thought, oh wao... Single order lamb shoulder is actually pretty decent sized at $5. Assuming beef brisket is about the same at $6. Manager seemed quite clueless too

We ordered 1 order of each, along with 2 large orders of watercress and napa cabbage, and a large order of fresh thick noodles. 

When the soup bases had arrived, they had looked a bit ""clear"" to me and my friend. As we were quite used to the white herb-y broth from little sheep, this had surprised us. It had a slight transparency to it and not fully white. When i tasted it, it felt watered down and tasted more salt/msg-like. Thats disappointing. Smelled great ! tasted meh

We had got some oyster mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, glass noodles from the conveyor belt but nothing else looked good. One of my friends said some of the oysters look like they are going bad, as some were turning yellow. Selection-wise in the conveyor belt is quite minimal and seemed to repeat quite often, nor seem like many people are going for it either. 

When the meats arrived. Give or take maybe 12 slices of meat per order and was NOTHING compared to the plate he had shown us earlier. The one he had shown us was on a round white plate, meat ""rolls"" piled high. Ours were on a long rectangular plate, with meat flat and layered. what the hell? we had asked about the size and the waiter said it is dependent on the slicer/worker in the back. I joked with one of my friends that we could tip the meat slicer and get quite a bit more. lol of cos we didnt do it but it was quite tempting. 

The veggies did not look that fresh. Especially the watercress. Bunched together in a ""cup"", it was quite hard to ""separate"" to share and some parts were turning yellow. Napa cabbage was in a bowl, cut. Kind of hard to screw that one up. 

Most disappointing was the ""fresh thick noodles"". definitely not fresh. nor were they thick. We LOVE the fresh thick noodles at Little Sheep. this is incomparable. in a large order, it was 3 ""bundles"" of noodles. all dried. and they had the thickness of maybe somewhere between angel hair and spaghetti. definitely not thick. Fresh? uhhhhh

In the end, our waiter had apologized to us as well for the confusion and minimal amount of info and knowledge he had. He stated he only started working there 3 days ago so his apology and willingness to help us was much appreciated.

I do remember the staff there overall being super friendly and nice enough to smile at pretty much all times. Chubby Cattle is extremely welcoming and has really fast service. Sadly my concerns are definitely with some of the food. The spicy soup base had way too much peppers or chili-the floating ingredients already in the base. It was quite the hassle when with a mild spicy dish, I had spent a long time fishing so much of it out of the soup. The inconvenience affected how much time I spent actually eating and boiling noodles and meat in the broth. I'd hate to say it but this negatively impacted my overall experience. The meat, if you get the lamb, comes in such thin slices that it near dissolved overtime on the place and worse was not something I thoroughly enjoyed after cooking in the broth. I think that a better combination of food would have made for a better time, so this understanding and the thoughtful/quick service is what saves my thoughts on the Chubby Cattle.",oeGmU6Av0RjzWg6aCJrkQQ,1,0,3,j7b6DaSvyzAeXx-zqSgfSA

Theres a sauce bar that has all kinds of yummy sauces to add to your soup as well. They also have bottomless edamame and congee- although at night when we were there the porridge was out.
You get your own little soup burner and they bring the additional meats or items on menu out to you. 
We got the spicy soup base which was a szechuan style mixture and the oxtail soup base which was also very good. 
The ingredients were fresh.
The servers were very nice and helpful.

If you don't like close quarters do not sit at bar. Its a very asian style dining and youre just there to eat and leave.  It reminded me of the food stalls in Korea. Sit at a table if you really want to enjoy the experience.

Its a little more expensive than most places in chinatown about 30 per person. Cheaper than the strip though and the food is good!

seafood combo: great presentation, but I didn't think it was worth the price. I didn't like the octopus, super chewy to me.

Small portions on a tiny dishes for avg of $3-$5 Good place but due to the reviews and hype, didn't live up to high expectations.",GS9yOMIU-fn1kFgYqBGhaQ,0,0,3,oWrG7_axkgodUaRnmReLQw

I had planned most of the meals during the trip but came up short one evening. Of course, I yelped and found this place. Fast forward to today and I still think of this place from time to time. After my meal, I remember telling my parents that this was the best restaurant that I have ever eaten at. I still stand by that statement today. The servers were great and explained in great detail on how to order and the customization that is left to each person since you can get your own hot pot! This worked out perfectly since my parents and I are like the three bears - my dad likes super spicy, my mom likes a little spicy, and I prefer mild. Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience. I have been to resolving sushi bars before so I loved seeing a conveyer belt used for hot pot ingredients.

They have a bunch of frozen dishes you can grab off the conveyor belt kinda like genki sushi in Hawaii! But basically you choose a broth (which they have like 5 types) and you choose your meat dish (beef combo) and you can choose your noodles (noodle combo) and you veggies. 
My server was deni and he was SUPER helpful with explaining to us how to order and what is most popular and he was a very good server! He made our experience more enjoyable! 
There's also a whole area JUST for sauces! You can go and pick all your sauces and they don't charge so you can try all of them if you want. 
Half way through eating I thought I wouldn't be able to finish!!! There was so much food and it was so filling. I thought the bill would be over $100 since there was so much to eat. 
Surprisingly the bill came out to $60 and for the amount we ate it was DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. This place is of course just another hot pot spot that just opened but it really beats all the other hot pots in town.

You start by ordering your base. There are lots of flavors, I would recommend asking your server. Then, you get to choose your meat. We did the beef combo and it was plenty of food for 2. We also picked some veggies and noodles from the conveyor belt. I did green tea noodles. Boy...they were delicious! I also added some mushrooms in and made sure to make a special sauce from the sauce bar in the middle. I read so many reviews saying how expensive this was. I'm unsure how anyone spent $80 here for 2 people! The prices are amazing. I could see how getting different foods from the conveyor belt could be expensive (they are charged by plate color) but overall, for 2 of us it was $35 which I thought was amazing! I can't WAIT to come back here and try so much more off of the menu. 

I also wanted to give a HUGE shoutout to Sylvia who was extremely helpful and walked us through everything. She mixed special sauce for us and explained what everything on the conveyor belt was.

1976639,2017-05-25,13,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"If you're a fan of hot pot, you need to moove on over to Chubby Cattle! I've been by a couple of times now, most recently for their reopening with their expanded menu featuring more meats. Not that they needed any, but it's definitely a place to take your favorite carnivore. Note that they also have extensive seafood and veggie options, too.

PICK YOUR BROTH: The tomato is a go-to, but if you like spice opt for the medium, which completely cleared out my sinuses. They are not kidding. I wouldn't go hotter than this. Props for having individual broth bowls as well as half-and-half options.
MAKE YOUR SAUCE: The station in the dining room has several sauces, herbs, and add-ins to make a dipping sauce for your meat. I like combining all the garlic and chili options, then topping with cilantro, green onion, and fried garlic. There are mouthwash stations in the bathrooms so your garlic-heavy food won't ruin your post-dinner date night plans.
EAT YOUR MEAT (and veggies): The bounty of hot pot add ins here is insane, from baskets of veggies and platters of protein, all photogenically presented for your  pleasure. The combo plates are your best bet, allowing you to mix and match. Check for specials, like Dorper sheep and crawfish. Some of my favorites have been the wagyu, brisket, quail eggs, and shrimp paste. Don't forget the enoki!

Reasonable prices and attentive service are just bonuses here. If you're coming in solo or as a couple, sit by the conveyor belt. Consider a late-night visit for their half price happy hour. Families and groups can request a private room for celebrations.

1993811,2016-12-03,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"First time trying this place and it was an interesting experience. Don't know if it is a weird night, or  just my bad luck or if this has happened before but the whole night was just interesting. 

Walking in the door I noticed that they do not accept credit or debit card for the night because their machine is down, not a problem, between my friends and I we have enough cash for the meal. 

We started off sharing two soups: the original and tomato - I thought the original soup was delicious, very sweet and savory, also very healthy. Not a fan of tomato so did not care for that. We got a vegetable combination; came in a little basket which is really cute, good variety of veggies too. Got a beef combo which came with brisket, rib-eye and something else. And a noodle combination which came with 4 different types of noodles. 

Here is where it gets a interesting:
-They informed us that they will be substituting one of the noodle in the combination with something else because they are out with the one that was supposed to be included in the combination
-We ordered chicken breast and was told their machine is down so no chicken, then we asked for free range chicken and was told they did not have that either 
-Then we wanted more meat and same story - meat cutting machine is down so no other meat besides the hand-cut angus beef - they took $2 off the angus beef because we had no other choice but to order it
-My friend wanted the taro knots...they also did not have that
-After the meal we wanted to try the fondu for dessert.... and you guessed it - they did not have that either - our server told us that they only had the fondu for the first few days of opening and they stopped it after that because it took too long to prepare and it wasn't profitable... they should take this off the menu then!! They only offer 3 desserts and the picture of the fondu takes up half the page...heavily promoted for an item they no longer offer 

So that is that... our meal was not 100% enjoyable because they did not have anything we wanted to order...I will say that the soup was really good, the items that they did have tasted very fresh and delicious, service was also great. All the staff were very friendly, attentive. Shout out to Brandon who was very funny and friendly!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,0,3,qN-h7M-mxwHX8WVi2uDxmg

2006100,2017-12-01,2,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"I've been to Chubby Cattle quite a few times now. It's my go-to spot for hot pot. They used to have a casino and student discount on Sundays and Wednesdays where it's BOGO free. However, they have now changed that. Instead of BOGO free, you sign up for a pre-paid card (much like a gift card) and you get an additional amount of $$$ (I've attached a pic). So if you place $100 on the card, you get an extra $18; purchase $200 and you get additional $38, and so on. 

The broth is what keeps me coming back. I've had the tomato, original, oxtail, and spicy pot. Only one I haven't tried is the mushroom. My top 2 is the tomato and original. I also recommend the beef combo, and the juicy beef balls. The beef balls are filled with soup in the middle so be careful and make sure you don't chomp down on the whole thing! It burns! I speak from experience. 

They also have a wonderful sauce bar where you can make your own sauce for you to dip your food in. If you look at the top of the sauce bar, there are signs that'll give you samples of what sauces to mix to go with whatever meat you're having (great for people who are kitchen-challenged, such as myself).

I do enjoy the conveyor belt and it's fun to pick the food you want from it. If you're at a table that isn't connected to the conveyor belt, you can always order from the menu bc it's the same items. 

The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars for me is the service. I always have to ask for a water refill and that's a pet peeve of mine. Or there will be silverware missing and it takes them forever and a half years to get the items to you. 

Even with that said, I will still go back to Chubby because I truly do enjoy the food.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,4,3,4,Ho2sE-3CGHSm2_ImZDjEqQ

2015534,2018-04-29,11,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"A few different reviews here. The House broth.... delicious! The choice of noodles that I went with was the green tea noodle. Was it tasty? Yes it was tasty but the serving amount was enough for my 2 year grand daughter. I like the the concept of picking my own ingredients, which there was quite a selection to chose from. My husband wasn't too thrilled with the idea to begin with and he's still not thrilled with this place. Then we had to go pick our own condiments and appetizers from the bar. Let's just say they need to keep that area a little bit more tidier than it was. Choice of appetizers were limited to 2. They do have a conveyor belt around the general sitting area but since we were in a large group we were sat in a private room. They take your broth order first and once that arrives, the waiter comes in and takes the rest of your order. He takes everyone's order except for one of my friends. We had to go and find the waiter to finish hers. Then we asked for forks for a couple people and took me asking twice before we even got it. After all
the orders arrived, we realized everyone got theirs except for my husband and my friend, who's order they originally forgot to take. This wasn't a good experience and the questions still remains... we me liking the food and the bad experiences we had, would i go back?

I was excited about trying it but, unfortunately it was a let down. Our first mistake was not making a reservation, when we got there I really wanted to try the conveyor belt but they had no room. The biggest complaint about this place is their customer service. The ladies at the front had difficulty communicating in English. I asked them if we could still get our own soup broths at the table and they said no we could only have 3. I figured that would be good enough since there is only 4 of us, but when we got to the table, you could only have 2 soup broths at most. The ladies are just speaking in Mandarin at this point, which annoyed me because my husband does not speak Mandarin so I had to translate everything for him. I also felt like the ladies out front had an attitude and just didn't really care.

They brought us a menu. Yes, just one for 4 people. I don't understand why. It should at least be one menu per couple? We went with the mushroom broth and the house hellishly spicy broth. We ended up ordering 2 orders of the beef combo, 1 vegetable combo, 1 seafood combo, 1 assorted noodles, and mongolian lamb skewers. So here is the weird part when we ask what is in the combo the server lists out some stuff and says if you are lucky there will be a, b, or c in it, for every combo. Isn't it kind of weird to have a combo be some kind of lottery system hoping you get lucky? Of course we just got the standard for all the combos. The service was just okay, they didn't really take away the plates we were done with.

I think the food was definitely tasty and fresh, with a reasonable price. I checked my credit card and we paid 127.49 for four people which I think is a decent price. I did leave 18% tip even though I felt like the service was lacking. My husband wanted to try to order the meats in the combo separately to see if there was a difference and made it a point to do so by ordering them separately by name, but our server just ended up bringing another combo, we didn't complain about it, just let it go and ate the combo. Our server came by and told us that if we give them a yelp review that we would get free ice cream. I declined, he seemed pretty shocked, but I am not about selling my reviews for rewards. He left quickly without asking us if we would like to buy any desserts. We waited for awhile, over 15 minutes and he never came back, not even to ask if we wanted our check. We ended up just walking up to the front desk to get our check.",JLlZgkxIUJHLuBcYOFDvaA,0,0,2,rRxD4ZoHwCNVYbXoF6B9zg

2086475,2017-10-26,3,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"I am normally not the type of person that likes to spend my own time writing a review as you can probably tell since this is my first review on this account. However, I just feel the need to express my concerns this time due to the way my incident was handled during my dining experience...

First off, this wasn't the first time I came to Chubby Cattle, I had no prior unsatisfactory experience here before until today. My girlfriend was craving hotpot so our first natural choice was Chubby Cattle since we both really enjoyed it previously. Our server Matthew had us seated and we began ordering like usual...

We normally never order any items from the seafood menu as we prefer their meat selection more but this time we decided to give their seafood combo platter a try since the guests next to us ordered one and the presentation was really beautiful. Along with that we also ordered some beef briskets, veggies and bunch of assorted items from their conveyor belt...

The dining experience was going nice and smoothly with service and most of the food being on point like usual. This took a dramatic downturn when the supposedly ""beautifully-presented seafood platter"" was brought to our table...

It had a assortment of shrimp, clam, scallop, crab leg, fish, and mussel. Anticipating the taste of this dish, we put a little of each into our broth and let it simmer for a good couple minutes. The shrimps and scallops was amazing but the RED FLAG comes when we go for the mussels...

I put a little of our sauce on top of the mussel and attempt to scoop the whole thing into my mouth as if it was a oyster. As I try to separate the meat from the shell using my mouth, I noticed a weird texture when I chew down on it, something I wasn't familiar with as I had plenty of mussels in the past. It felt really hairy and crunchy at the same time, so I immediately spit the whole thing back on the shell to see what it was that I bit into. I was thoroughly disgusted when I saw a bunch of black hairy leg-like thing protruding from the flesh of the mussel. I wasn't able to identify what that thing was. And from another piece I took out from the broth, I saw a random whole-small crab inside the mussel itself. Without further or due, I ended my meal there without finishing anything else from the seafood platter as well as what is in my broth. 

I informed my server of the situation and all he came back with is that the manager said it was a natural occurrence as they are the things they eat...seriously? So I had to personally request to have the manager come over and told her that explanation was unacceptable. I mean come on, If I were to order pork intestine from a restaurant, I expected it to be thoroughly clean despite knowing what is consider as a ""natural occurrence"" that takes place in it.  

She told me that the mussels are from a supplier at New Zealand and they were the one who supposedly cleaned and cooked it before shipping it to Chubby Cattle...but hey, how about doing some inspection on it yourself before serving it to your customers? It is only a standard process for the price you guys charge. Not to mention she also told me this type of incident also happened previously to other customers as well so all in all, this should bring a RED FLAG to you guys to either switch suppliers or have a thorough cleaning of such products when you receive them. 

The manager kept trying to push the responsibility to other things instead of owning the experience. She did however apologize and say she will reflect my concerns to the team and said she will see if she can do anything for me. When my bill came nothing was altered, and I can see from a distance she just kept talking with her co-workers, laughing and chatting along. This just makes me feel like she wasn't sincere at all and that your management just doesn't care anymore. It wasn't until we told the server Matthew that your management said she will do something in regards to the bill that they then finally went ahead and removed the seafood platter (we only partially consumed the shrimp and scallop, everything else was discarded because we were disgusted) from the bill.  

I work in the hotel industry in a 5 star luxury resort setting and I understand how important customer service is to maintain and generate loyal guests. With all due respect, I don't expect the same level of service standards from Chubby Cattle, but come on, your server itself saw those disgusting hairy legs coming from the flesh, it could be potentially hazardous as it is something unidentifiable. Trying to brush off and escape the situation instead of proactively dealing with it just tells me a lot about your company. 

I had always suggested Chubby Cattle to my friends, family and numerous guests that come to our hotel when they ask if I know a spot for delicious and unconventional Asian cuisine. This is such a big disappointment...I don't think I am able to recommend this place anymore or even come back at all",Pb6i5nN99egTXBKzjj457g,15,0,2,Xrc-O9qEIZKy6KaFui8QGQ

We had a weekend trip to Vegas during Lunar New Year, made reservations on OpenTablet.com, but somehow our reservations were lost.  LUCKY for us, we came at the right time and they had a few tables open.  We got some side room, so we were in there ourselves.  I was pretty happy with that since it was fairly loud outside.  It was a ""build your own sauce"" place, with a whole table with probably around 20 items to put in your sauce.  Options for hotpot broth is traditional or spicy, the ingredients had a HUGE selection of meats, vegetables, non-meat proteins, homemade meatballs, noodles, plus some!  We had only so much room to fit in our belly, therefore we chose the ""interesting"" noodles, basket of vegetables, homemade meatballs, and choices of meat.

The meats are great here and are reasonably priced. I love how many broth options they have. My favorite is honestly the tomato one. If you want it spicy just add chilly oil! 

The have a great variety of veggies and sides to cook.  The fish balls are a must and I'm talking about the fresh ones and not the frozen rubbery ones! 

The conveyor belt idea is pretty cool but the prices on the belt do not match the price in the menu. So I wonder which is better to grab off of? 

The only downside about here is portions of their sides. For a large noodle, they told me it's good for 2 people. When I saw it, I thought this isn't even enough for me. Even when I ordered a large enoki mushroom, I was very very small and it made me wonder how much they would give in the small size? 

The service is okay when they are busy. But they were good when it was slow.

What impressed me was the good selection of lamb and the good service.

Everything else was mediocre. The soup base (original) is similar to the little sheep Mongolian hot pot soup. It was good but nothing spectacular. 
I was disappointed at the beef rib eye which was super dry.

2191247,2017-01-08,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Hot pot places isn't usually the first thing I crave but we have heard and read so many good things about that my boyfriend and I thought to give it a try. What really caught my attention was the conveyor belt feature they have because there is no place in vegas that does it. Unfortunately it's too bad it's not a sushi place.
We expected it to be busy since it was a Saturday but the wait wasn't too bad. About 25 min wait to sit for 2 near the conveyor belt. So there is a few different areas, there is a bar style, booth or like big family round tables.
Service was great as soon as we sat down. The waiter was super nice and explained everything we needed to know. First you order the broth. They have a few choices to choose from. We decided to get 1 house special and 1 house special spicy. By far, the spicy broth was way more flavorable and you can decide how spicy you want it. The house special was alright if you simple taste. Then u order the type of meat. On yelp I saw the cool seafood platter so that's what I got (which was a mistake) and my boyfriend ordered the lamb and beef combo (good choice). Those 2 orders alone had me really full. Unfortunately, I didn't have the energy or space to pick something out of the conveyor belt but it was nice for pics. The dishes inside vary from meat to seafood to veggies to noodles. The reason why the seafood was a mistake was cause most of it was on the conveyor belt like the shrimp, scallops, and mussels. It was the display of the seafood platter that really only caught my attention. 
The other cool part about this place was that you could create your own dipping sauce at the sauce station!
The 2 things that really stood out in this place was the broth and sauce station hands down. Oh, I believe rice is also free because my boyfriend ordered a side of it. 
Cons about this place is the limited space u have if u eat at the bar area where the conveyor is. It's pretty tight when u have people on both sides of you. 
The meat was alright. The seafood was alright. Nothing special. Fresh though. But what really gives it it's taste is the broth and the sauce u create with it. 
Overall the bill was about $50. But only because I think we mistakenly ordered the seafood platter which was about $20. The lamb and beef combo was about $16.99 and I believe the brother is $3-6 bucks. My boyfriend said he wasn't full but just about right. However for me, I felt super full. Definitely worth a try! It's also fun to take pics on your experience. :)",YMG37osXwAL7pphRCZReYQ,1,0,4,3VcFT9dofjsS53ONIDpLkw

I had to call twice to change our reservation time because my friends and I were having trouble getting an Uber. But the reception lady was super nice about and saved us a table despite being late to our third change of time. 

We ordered a large pot to share the soup bases. You can order up to 3 bases for one large pot and we got the spicy one, seafood, and original.  And for the meat, we got beef, lamb, fish balls, and sliced fish.   As for vegetables, we got napa cabbage and enoki mushrooms. And a side of glass noodles. 

The soup bases are everything I love in hotpot! Lots of chili oil and spice in the spicy base and lots of sea flavor in the seafood base. They were all thick in flavor but light in consistency. Overall great broth!

Coming from Boston where I feel our shabu shabu is the .com I was really hoping this could be the spot .. Wahh 

Ok on to my review 

It was a Friday night around 10pm. I know late night dinner. I was feeling great. I just got out of a massage ( super popular here) Time for some yummy hot pot.

I had book mark this place and love the concept of the restaurant with the conveyer belt as there is nothing like it in Vegas. 

We got seated pretty quickly. I was excited as we got seated at the conveyer belt. It was fogged up and you couldn't really see inside but you could open the lid and check out the selection. The plate color indicated the pricing. 
The waiter we had kept trying to tell us you are new here so get like everything combo. The combo veggie and mushroom came in these wooden like basket. The combo beef plate were huge not ideal for a small tables. He seem to discourage us from the items in the conveyer belt. Why ?? 
We ended up getting the mushroom combo, watercress and meat combo. They did not have a liquor license so BYOB. I tried their watermelon juice ( this seemed water down ) everything else seem fine and fresh. 
BF got the tomato base soup and I got the mid level spicy broth. The broth were nothing to blow you out the water . 

Now here is where it turns 
So when we were waiting on our items we headed over to the sauce station no bowls so we sat back down since none of the staff standing around acknowledge us looking around for bowls and say oh do you need anything( we figure oh maybe they bring you the bowl) 
The waiter goes oh go grab your sauce guys. We head over along with all the other newbies and crowded around the station. No bowls Wth ! I look at this guy and said where are the bowls and he comes back with tea cups  ok so I take it. We sit back in out seat ready to go no bowls for our soup ( is this not a hot pot soup spot ? ) or soup spoons . I ask for these items 5 times from 5 different people. Finally I gave up on the bowls just give me soup spoons . This guy says oh let me go wash you some ( why did he feel the need to tell me this ) I wanted to say do you want a cookie !!! 
In the middle of eating in our tight cramp area with all our items the waiter comes and ask would you like to do a survey for special on your birthday !! I was like seriously right now I'm not even done eating. My answer was NO. 
Than the waiter comes back and interrupts us Again about they are sending him home early and if he could get us our check. Of course we were done and over this place so we said that was fine. 
He than comes back to tell us he is giving us free ice cream and to show some support on Yelp. At this point I was at boiling point ! What turn to be a nice night ! They killed my vibe",Hfs8WdMLQKdHgoPLp_ZRXw,0,0,1,zzszs6Kn4sNuK4-VZGj6zA

2267336,2016-08-23,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Came here to meet up with a group of friends after work. We were all really excited to come try it out after hearing about it in the news and just wanting to try out a conveyor belt concept for hot pot. It was still relatively early in the night (close to 7pm), so parking was not too bad. Upon getting to the front of the establishment, they still had a red carpet laid out and the cut ribbon from their Grand Opening was still hanging out. There are two sets of glass doors you need to get through to get into the restaurant. Upon opening the first set, you are blasted with nice cold AC and the fragrant smell of hot pot. My stomach immediately grumbled. With an amazing welcoming smell like that, what could go wrong, right?..

Well, once we entered through the second set of doors, we were 'greeted' by the hostess with ""How many?"" and ""Do you have a reservation?"". We proceeded to tell her there were four in our party, and no, we do not have a reservation. She then says ""Well, I can seat you at a shared pot, away from the conveyor belt."" otherwise, it would be impossible to seat us because there was ""a reservation at 7:15, another at 7:15, and one at 7:30."" Then she walks off and it seems like she went to talk to some people at another table? I'm not sure what she asked them, but she came back and said ""It will be a 45 minute to an hr wait before I can seat you."" Did she just go ask that table when they would be finished eating? I will never know. We gave her a name and cell phone number of a friend in our party, and the hostess told us to come back at 7:44. If a table opens up earlier, she will give us a call.

Fast forward to 7:44 we walk in through the double set of doors (blasted again with the nice aroma of hot pot. Stomach again, grumbles). There are a few parties standing around the crowded entrance waiting at this point. She looks at us, and asks if we are ____. We said yes, and she says ""I tried calling you, but it didn't work."" and walks off. I looked on the podium where she had her reservation sheet, double checked the number, and manually dialed it on my cell phone. What do you know? My friend's phone immediately wrung. She then sat a party before us, and then brought us to our tables. After we got seated, a bus person came over and said, ""Sorry, I'm not done setting the table,"" and proceeded to finish setting it up. We received one menu with our party of four people. I looked around, and I see another party of five also only had one menu. Sure, we can share two to a menu, but four people on opposite sides of the table looking off of one menu? Nope.

We've had quite a few questions on the menu. What specific meats are in the beef and lamb combo? (lamb shoulder/beef brisket) What is the difference in weight between ordering a combo vs each item individually? (combo was $16.99, lamb shoulder was $4.99, and beef brisket was $5.99) Our server did not know the answer to the weight question and had to ask the manager, who responded with ""10 oz for the combo, 5 oz for the rest""... Wait, what? That doesn't add up. Why would I pay $16.99 for a combo with 10oz of meat vs $9.98 for 10 oz of meat when ordered individually? Our party opted with the individual orders of meat, along with some napa cabbage, watercress, and 'fresh thick noodles'. The veggies were also confusing to order, as the menu listed 'small' and 'large' prices, which differed from the conveyor belt prices for the same veggie. Soup bases: We wanted to order their 'House Original' soup base and their 'House Hellish Spicy Pot' with Mid Level Hell 12 spicy. We were told by the server that they were sold out of the House Original as well as the Spicy soup bases. How can you be out of the original soup base? We almost got up and left then and there, but the manager came by and told us there will be a 10 minute wait if we wanted to get those soup bases. What's 10 minutes compared to the wait we've already had, right?

The soup bases came out first. I was surprised at how clear it was. It was a bit bland, but I added some garlic to it, so all was good. Can't go wrong with garlic! Next, the meats and veggies came out. For $4.99 and $5.99, I believe they give you a decent sized portion. Of course it will always be cheaper at a supermarket, but at a restaurant, the price wasn't bad. The quality of the meats were just average. I could get better quality elsewhere. The veggies were a bit on the not-s-fresh side, as some leaves were starting to yellow and brown. Also, when the 'fresh thick noodles' came out, they were dry and thin. I don't know about you, but 'dried' noodles does NOT mean fresh in my vocabulary. Items we saw on the conveyor belt when we entered were nowhere to be found once we got our soup base. Keep an eye and restock it please!

When we asked for our bill, the server apologized for his lack of knowledge, as he started working three days ago. All in all, it was an interesting concept to try, but I probably will not be returning any time soon.",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,3,0,3,Flln9QuIcjDCdgbQPNLQLA

Upon asking for our check the server noticed I didn't touch the brisket and asked if I liked it, to which I replied no it was too fatty, but I was still charged.

2284791,2016-12-07,4,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Have to be honest the conveyor belt part of this restaurant is what drew my attention. I was completely curious so I had to check it out. With all the hot pot places around the area now I was looking for something different. 

I like the individuality of the meal, you can pick between two soup bases. One is not spicy and looks milky while the other is spicy and spicy is not an understatement. I love spice but ieven had to take out  a heaping amount of the chili peppers and various spices put into the broth. They even warn you that you shouldn't drink the soup, which was a bit of a bummer for me BC I like to enjoy my soup broth at the end. I just took out about a cup full of the peppers and spices and I was able to drink some of the broth.  The servings of meat is small in my opinion. The seafood presentation is beautiful however. They do have many choices of meats, vegetables, noodles, etc. And what you don't order you can take off the conveyor belt. Unfortunately not everyone in the restaurant can enjoy this conveyor belt feature, so if you are going strictly to experience that make a reservation or don't go during peak times. 

This place can become quite pricey for what it is. Especially since there is another hot pot place down the road which offers more food for less the price and is jist as good. I will say the experience here is unique so check it out at least once.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,5,5,4,NOlqflaDCOPuhHuMUJbiIg
2308343,2017-01-12,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"For me, one of the most important part for the perfect hot pot meal is the soup base. So although I do enjoy a bit of spice in my dish, I usually start with the restaurant's original soup base for my first visits so I can taste their flavor without any other ingredients shadowing it. The broth was very flavorful with the right amount of seasoning and a nice herbal kick. Absolutely delicious! I'll have to try my luck with the spicy soup next time I come back. 

As for the menu items, the restaurant offered a good selection of quality meat and seafood. My friends and I ordered a whole array of dishes ranging from beef brisket to crab and everything was fresh and presented beautifully. My favorite would have to be the Kobe beef and oysters. Highly recommend both!

I'm so glad my friend brought me to Chubby Cattle before I left Las Vegas! I'll be returning next time i return for sure. It's about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, so take a cab, Uber, or drive there yourself because it's definitely the place to visit for a good hot pot experience.",hkX1GPoD0zPiY8S2R1Wrug,1,0,5,XYHDvKwn_IqnXyfNr4m88w

(Skip this paragraph if you don't wanna hear my complaining) I came here with my parents & was told on the phone that 3 people could just walk in without a reservation. When we arrived, the hostess told us there were only 2 groups ahead of us. I assumed the wait would be around 25 min max. After 40 minutes, we still weren't seated. All these tables were opening up and I was pissed why we weren't being assigned to any of them. Another couple started yelling at the hostess because apparently their reservation wasn't even honored. After also complaining to the hostess and manager about the open tables & our hour long wait, we finally sat down at a table around 9:00pm. Don't make the wait seem so short just to have us wait an entire hour and eat such a late dinner. We would've gone somewhere else if we had known beforehand.

The conveyer belt is a cool idea. Kinda like Kula revolving sushi or sushi boats. After ordering meat and a veggie basket from the menu, I honestly didn't need much from the conveyer belt though. They had so many options like green tea noodles, beef dumplings, fish balls, barley noodles, etc. Then on the menu, they had so many different options of meat (even fresh dungeness crab). The broth was delicious!! I got the entry level spicy broth and it was plenty spicy enough. There's also a sauce station with a bunch of options and omg....everything was amazing. Love the fried garlic. 

Our waitress was amazing - she was friendly, knowledgable, and efficient unlike the hostess. The manager was also really sweet and came by our table to personally apologize for our experience earlier. Overall, food is delicious and I'm excited for them to open up a location in SF next!

We also got the large fish ball order. It tasted like the regular fish balls you would find but they were 4x the size so I recommend you just getting the small. If we hadn't ordered the large, it wouldn't have been too much food. The large comes with 8 and the small comes with 4.

This place is new and had lots of positive reviews, but I can't say that I'm a fan of this place...  Fellow Yelpers have disappointed on this one, which makes me wonder if all the reviews are real.

Everything here adds an extra costs to your meal.  Soup base = minimum $4.  Want noodles in your soup?  Another $3-4.  Meat?  Anywhere from $5 and up.  Each little plate that rotates around = additional cost (from $1-4).  Some plates are reasonable, but others are just ridiculous.  I think we paid like $3 for a couple pieces of lettuce, because it's considered a ""daily special"".  Perhaps there's some better way of ordering, but it was not explained to us very well.  For two people (that just drank water), the bill ended up over $50 for some noodle soup that wasn't impressive at all.

Service for us wasn't too great either.  Seats were available, but the hostess told us to sit in the corner only to come over less than a minute later and tell us our seats were ready.  We weren't given a menu, but there was one nearby.  Turns out, it was originally given to the people next to us.  But, the hostess pointed out for us to use it when we were sat down.  We ordered noodles, but those didn't come until long after we started.  And, I paid the tab with a $100 bill and the women who took the money asked if I needed change...  Really?

We have never done the hotpot/shabu-shabu thing, so it was a new experience from a-z, but we will definitely be doing it again.

VEGAN SURVIVAL GUIDE:
- Try to block out the name of this place from your mind.
- Get a table in the back away from the live seafood butchering area.
- Ask for a two broth combo: half Tomato broth, half Mushroom broth. These are completely vegan.
- Get a veggie basket, a mushroom basket, some tofu (soft or fried) or tofu skins.
- We tried the green tea noodles & they were bomb. A+
- At the sauce station, stick to a mix of soy sauce, green onions, and garlic. Optionally, add chile. Dunno if other sauces were veg.
- Since you are preparing your own food from baskets, you can control a lot & rid your mind of the dreaded meat cross contamination worries.
- Get the hot jasmine green tea.
 It comes in an adorable serving pot. Sooo warming.

After choosing up to three different broths along with your meat or seafood selections, a create-your-own sauce station provides a multitude of flavors to mingle with your tastebuds.
If that isn't enough, a conveyor belt full of variously priced items may tickle your fancy.

My fellow diners and I chose two broths:  ""House Original"" and ""Heaven and Hell"".  I thought their House Original (beef/chicken stock) had a light, subtle flavor but perfect for sipping on.  The spicy broth was was actually a bit too spicy even for me and also a bit too salty for one of our friends dining with us.   

The meats we cooked were delicious and the many dipping sauces elevated the taste.   My wife ordered some scallops which pretty much got lost in the mix of broth, noodles, veggies and meat; probably a first and last time to order those.  

Similarly, we felt like the conveyor belt items were lackluster.  Assorted vegetables and tofu looked unexciting and didn't seem necessary to enjoy the meal or make it better.  Beyond that, our only wish is for them to serve some nice beer to go with the food!

Our servers were very helpful and did explain their restaurant concept fairly well.   Waters were filled promptly and the food came fairly quickly after ordering.

There is a conveyor belt of refrigerated dishes you can choose from to add to your hot pot (just like sushi conveyor belt, you pay based on the color of the plate). The servers are extremely helpful and attentive. You start off by picking the base broth (original was very good). The you can add the protein/veggies as desired. Can order what is on the menu or pick from the conveyor belt. My daughter and I started with the combo beef plate $13 and raw pork pot stickers which was  perfect for our two personal pots. After you order the broth, head on over to the sauce station and prepare your dipping sauce. Lots of choices so can get overwhelming. I choose the ponzu, garlic, green onion, and a bit of chili paste. Came out perfect. Also ordered hand-made noodles and bowls of rice. Once the pot was boiling, started adding the ingredients and then the thin sliced beef one slice at a time since they cooked very quickly. Then added fresh shrimp, tofu, rice cakes, sausages, mussels (all from the conveyor belt). Made the soup very tasty but be cautious with the soup though, it's boiling hot...literally.

I came to Chubby Cattle right at noon on Sunday morning and people were waiting to be seated. I had no idea this restaurant was featured on the Food Network, so I noticed the TV hype as patrons mentioned they wanted to try this place due to ZimmernList. 

We wanted to order the Wagyu (which they advertised on Yelp too), but they were sold out. So we ordered the Beef combo with a veggie platter. The veggie platter came out in 30 minutes (it's raw veggies, we cook it ourselves, c'mon) and our beef came out 1 hour later (again, it's raw. we would have to cook it ourselves). 

The veggie platter came in a large wooden basket with a variety of vegetables but what I didn't understand was the romaine lettuce. I get bok choy and cabbage, but I don't get why you would cook lettuce in broth. It's just weird. 

The beef combo was actually pretty decent once it came out and the meat was nicely marbled.

There is a rotating conveyor belt (like a sushi belt) of toppings that you can choose from for your hot pot. All the toppings were not labeled nor did the ingredients looked very appetizing. The rotating plates were color coordinated to different pricing, so we got the price but the frosty covers don't reveal much.

At the sauce station, the variety of sauces was nice, but there are a million signs of how to develop ""recommended"" sauce combinations. 

All in all.. there is WAYYY too much going on here. The gimmick of these random features fall short. 
I think Chubby Cattle should just concentrate on executing good quality meats/veggies in a timely manner. The entire restaurant was not pleased with the slow pacing of the food coming out (our server was pleasant, at least!).

Interesting experience but probably never would be back.",QMqSgBqSrlRhz2B0UiORjw,15,10,2,ax5OT4V5DPDIc7RW-iuCFQ

NOTE: If you work at a casino you get a buy one get one free on the meats you order, and you're not limited to just one order so feel free to order away if you're starving (though the portions are big) or if you have a big group. This is a hotpot place and is very clean. What I really love is that there is a conveyer belt with side dishes going around that you can grab and add to your hotpot. What's always amazing is that there is a sauce bar and you can make your very own sauce to dip your food in. If you like spicy like me, here's my signature sauce creation. 2 scoops of spicy garlic hot oil, 1 scoop of soy sauce, half a scoop of bean paste to round out the flavors, and a small amount of green onion and cilantro. The food is great, the service is great, I always come here when my family and I decide to go out to eat.

Our check was $73!!! We were still starving and had to stop by McDonalds on the way home. WTF!

First and foremost, this review is due to the fact that almost everything I wanted on the menu was met with a ""we don't have it right now."" So they didn't have any of the ramen on the menu or any fried tofu, etc. So we were left with getting a vegetable variety and beef brisket. We were starving so we ate the vegetables and other random items that was rolling around the restaurant. 20 mins later, when we still haven't gotten our beef brisket, we asked for it. Our waiter came back and said that the machine was down. Mind you, we have been asking for everything at least twice before receiving it (including our water and our broth). Needless to say, our table of five had VEGETABLES for dinner, no meat! We asked for our check and was extremely upset.

The two stars I left is for our waiter. Though we had to continually ask for water and broth, we did eventually get it. He was extremely busy. I feel bad for him because he had to be the bearer of  bad news about the meat cutter being down.

The broth can also be flavored with a wide variety of sauces and spices they have available (for free!).  You can grab however many sauces and seasonings you want, which includes soy sauce, chili sauce, oyster sayce, ponzu sauce, green onion, garlic, peanut butter, and a LOT more.  I highly recommend trying them all out!

They have a wide variety of small dishes you can pick off a conveyor belt to cook and eat in your hot pot, as well as a menu you can order off of which includes meat, noodles, and other dishes.  All of the ingredients on the conveyor belt taste very fresh, and range from a measy 99 cents to $3.99.  My personal favorites are the crab, fish cakes, and fried tofu! The meat is really tender and delicious as well and makes a perfect complement to the noodles and broth.  

You can get full for a VERY reasonable price here, since the original soup base itself costs only $3.99.  The servers are attentive and explain how it works to newcomers, as well as giving you a run down of the daily specials.  They also refill your soup when it gets low, which is a nice bonus.  After your meal they even offer you a free popsicle! 

I highly recommend this place for anyone who loves hot pot or is just looking to try something new.  The first of it's kind in Vegas and it sets the bar high!",qjndhunBG-P4_GA4eBgIZA,0,0,5,gvwI2LZCZ0S9VLqKf3MCYw

The manager came over and pretty much didn't care either and kept trying to convince me that it was beef. After that, the waitress never came around anymore.

However, I wouldn't recommend the house broth if you are not used to Asian hot pot because it has too much ""seeds"" (I forgot the name) in it. When you bite into it, it somewhat numbs your mouth and then there is a hint of a metal flavor. 

If you are a first timer I would recommend either the mushroom or tomato broth! Their presentation is beautiful especially with the combos. They have cute little baskets and use dry ice as decoration as well. 

We had the meat combo, scallops, 2 mushroom soup, pork dumplings, rice (you have to order), crab meat, and veggie noodles. It came out to about $50 enough for 2 people. Everything was very tasty however you have to watch the noodles carefully because they tend to get pretty mushy if you leave it in too long. 

I LOVE the sauce station ! They have a wide variety of sauces to choose from and to mix with. It was also a nice touch how they had sauce mixture recommendations. 

They also have a happy hour for everything on the conveyor belt buy one get one free SUN-THURS 9:30-12:30.

We went for lunch on Dec 26th as they were open from 12-3pm that day.They have a great selection of broths to choose from and a wide array of yummy goodness ( and sometimes weirdness) to simmer. I prefer beef, tendon and veggies over pork blood and duck flipper, but hey, there's something for everyone! The coolest part is that you can sit at the bar in front of a refrigerated covered conveyor belt and grab things as you see/want them. They keep track of your consumption by the color-coded plates.
I really enjoyed the food! We were desperate to return but were dismayed that they only seemed to open at 5pm everyday. We were confused as we had been there at 2pm the day before. In any case, it's a fantastic experience and worth getting away from the Strip for!",_x7j_RerBqaXgNkVuT4CHw,2,0,5,9943weti_-dbX0751dhZwQ

First and last visit to this place. Must accept some of the blame myself as it was my first experience at hot pot. Spent $60 for myself only. Interesting concept, but due somewhat to my inexperience, it just did not work. I overcooked the meat making it virtually inedible. Tough and tasteless (beef tongue and premium lamb). Shrimp were good, but I do not like peel your own. They were fresh as were the scallops, which were quite small. Best dish was the kobe fried rice, which was quite good but not great. Pass on the watermelon juice which was watery and served at room temperature. Blah!

I have been here 4-5 times, every time I have had a pleasant experience. The only issue is that this place is completely overpriced for the amount of vegetables and add ons. The meat quality was soso, and the broth wasn't spectacular. I recently tried the tomato broth and I do recommend that over all the other broths. Also, I would recommend trying the side dishes they have at the sauce table. There was lotus root one time when I went and it was delicious. Another time there was this wood mushrooms.

3355729,2017-01-24,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"First and foremost, I believe their rating is a false high.  The server tells you about half way through your meal that if you leave a review on Yelp while you are there and show him at the end of the meal you will get a free desert.  He then tried to clear our food while we are still eating and asked if we were ready for our free dessert.  When we were finally done he approached us again about the dessert to which we replied we didn't want dessert.  

The actual food was just ok.  The broth was a little boring, we both got the spicy broth, I got a little spicier than my husband.  There is a ""sauce bar"" which is pretty awesome that you can make your own sauces as well as a couple of prepared sauces.  At the end of the day it was just kind of a stressful meal experience.  You get very little room and they try to recommend a meat platter, vegetable platter and seafood platter; we didn't get the seafood.  There is no room to really do much and you are cooking your own stuff so you can't move much while you are trying to cook.  Not to mention if you want anything off the conveyor belt there is no room to put it.  We only got two items off the conveyor belt and both times didn't know where to put the dish.  There were two ladles in the broth, one regular and one with holes to scoop out the chiles and such.  The last hot pot restaurant we went to had a little container to put your utensils in which was very convenient as well as a pair of scissors for you to cut things up, something they might want to look into.  

We've been to hot pot before, Yojie, and had a really good time.  Overall I think this place just doesn't do as good of a job, it's a little to gimmicky and hip.  I think it's way sketchy when you are pushed to do reviews in front of the staff, I wouldn't go back.  On a final note there was a very intense smell in there, kind of a cross between body odor and bad fish, I almost left before we were seated because of it, kind of wish we had.",WEXkES4QG-INtrBMtdFyBQ,1,0,2,bVa96Rf81iFwo0Lh1I7dlA

3388140,2017-12-21,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Ugh, I had such high hopes for this place, but my coworkers and I agreed that we wouldn't go back. We went around 9:30pm on a Thursday night for their buy one get one free happy hour. Even with this, my bill came out to be around $16. I got the tomato broth, beef brisket, enoki mushrooms, another type of mushroom, tripe, and jelly noodles (jü luo). Maybe I think it's so expensive because I'm used to eating 5x more food at AYCEs for $25.

Another reviewer recommended the tomato broth ($4.99), so that's what I got. I hated it. It tasted like tomato paste from a can and was really salty. My coworker got the original broth and I liked that much much better. 

For the meat option, I got the beef brisket ($5.99). It was the cheapest option on the menu, but it was still tasty. Came with about 7 slices. The beef here is definitely the star of the meal, with wagyu/kobe options. Honestly, if I were to ever come again, I'd just splurge on the combo and skip all the other stuff. 

The 2 mushrooms were $1.99 each, jelly noodles $2.99 and tripe $3.59 (pre-happy hour discount). SO expensive. I also really wanted the chrysanthemum greens, but they were $2.99 for a single serving. At the Chinese market, you can get enough chrysanthemum greens for 10 people at that price. I definitely wouldn't come without the happy hour discount. I'd only come if you weren't that hungry. If you're really hungry, go to an all you can eat. 

The conveyor belt was really limited in options. They didn't have qual eggs or a variety of fish/meat balls. It also didn't really look that fresh. Maybe it was basically it was late on a slow night.

I will say that the service was really good. The waiter refilled our waters, got us beers and even split our bill for us, which was much appreciated.",B95OT0Pkc8PTFm8pCtXq1A,6,1,2,dPci84au2kVM_3k_B7Qysg

The coupon doesn't state so, and its online right now, so we went back and forth with her. Finally she left to check for us if she could honor it. Again. Its advertised. That's one of the reasons we came here for. As she came back she said a short. I'm sorry we are out of the meat. So we cant use the coupon. First she refuses to honor it and then magically they are out of the meat.
Then we asked her what meats she is not out of and she offered the beef combo plate that entails three different meats. One is the waygu beef. So we were like you have the waygu beef when its entailed in the platter but not the waygu beef that you ADVERTISE for the coupon. Well thats great. Lol
We just let it go and ended up ordering the meat combo plate and a stella(Which they were out of too...) We waited forever on our meats. We were almost done with the vegetables before even got the meat platter. The conveyer belt was full off mist, so we couldnt see whats on the belt.

Let's start with the food -- the broth has a divider that allowed us to try three different broths. We got the heaven, hell, and mushroom (the mushroom was my personal favorite). The heaven and hell pot is called yin yang and you can get that by itself also! The conveyer belt is CONSTANTLY packed with food and restocked so you don't have to wait forever which is a problem I've had in the past. I ordered wine and they do NOT skimp on the wine like other places do and actually know what to recommend. Their serving sizes for the beef and lamb platters were perfect for four people. 

Moving on to the service, impeccable. One of the most considerate staff I've ever come across. They always came to refill all THREE of our broths and drinks. Unlike other restaurants that only check up on you when you wave them down. They explained the entire process for those of us that haven't been there and made the overall experience that much more enjoyable. The manager is also so great! We had a small hiccup with the mix up of food and she (sylvia) came straight out to fix everything and apologize. This is one of the only places that I've experienced this kind of genuine service.

It's hot pot and how the menu works is you pick a broth, ( I picked the spicy one) 
You can add noodles for $1 ( I had green tea and it's with the add on but only one order per person) 
Pick your meat ( I picked brisket) 
And then there's a conveyer belt of other add-ons, you grab whatever you want out of it and pay according to the plate color chart.
My broth was spicy but kinda meh. 
My meat was perfect, the noodles were good.
I ordered water with lemon and asked for lemons 4 times and never got it but that's okay.

We had the choice of small or large hot pots, and we opted for small (i.e. individual) hot pots, as the hostess said that it was better value for a party of two since there was no minimum spending requirement. We were also able to secure a booth next to the conveyor belt. I wanted to try out the conveyor belt because it was such a novelty for a hot pot restaurant, though if you sit at a regular table, you can still order everything off the menu.

Prices are reasonable, though it's all a la carte, so things can add up quickly if you aren't keeping track. Portions are decent too, so value is not terrible.

The interior of the restaurant is very modern and eclectic. It's not all that big, and there is no time limit, so at peak dining times, there may be quite a wait.

There are five great broths to choose from, and I opted for oxtail. There is an excellent sauce bar, and some complimentary side dishes and dessert as well.

All of the main food is ordered a la carte, and everything aside from the meats and cooked items can be found on the refrigerated conveyor belt.

My friend and I ordered a few things to share, and greatly enjoyed all of the food and broths. Service was also outstanding, as we were checked on regularly and given napkins plus water/soup broth refills. Our waitress Xiao was very friendly!

The one small shortcoming was that the ??? (beef pie) we ordered took forever to arrive, we waited over forty minutes! They did apologize though, and they tasted quite good!

The food was pretty good, but my main complaint with this place is the lack of sets or combos. You basically have to order each ingredient separately which allows for customization to the max, but for people like me, it just takes more time to figure out what you want. You gotta be careful too since the price can rack up pretty quickly! I ended up playing almost $30 for my individual broth, beef brisket, 2 side orders of noodles, and 2 side orders of mushrooms. I wasn't full after my meal, but the food was good and at least the sauces are free XD. I like how they have some ingredients like veggies, mushrooms, noodles, and oysters on a conveyor belt so you can grab whatever you like.

It was kind of hard to understand the waiter due to his accent, but he was very nice. The wait staff could check on us a bit more since they stopped coming towards the middle to end of the meal. We had to flag someone down to get a refill on the broth.

Overall I'd recommend this place for hot pot if you are around the area. It can get a bit pricy so try to go during happy hour when the conveyor belt ingredients are buy one get one free.

You can eat as much or as little as you like. Just choose your hot pot broth, select some meats of the menu, grab some sauces from their sauce bar and pick and choose the plates as they roll by on the conveyor belt. Hungry for more? Then just keep grabbing those plates and they'll tally the plates up at the end. (If you're wondering how much each plate costs, just check out their little plate key below every window). 

My mother is in from Texas and she loved the experience and can't wait to go back. Besides just having a great time, the staff were all very helpful and super nice and attentive. Kind of rare for a Chinatown restaurant to be honest so it was greatly appreciated.

First, the broth, I liked mine, it was entry level hell- at first really spicy but as I ate it down it was fine. I made myself a decent dipping sauce, but would love it if there were some suggestions. Meat and vegetables seemed very fresh, but too expensive for me. The amount of meat given per dish was not that much for the price. The amount of vegetable was fine. I didn't partake of any rice or noodles but they seemed very run of the mill. I didn't take anything from the conveyor belt, and I didn't notice anyone else taking any either. I sort of question the freshness of the dishes and the dishes themselves, some sort of informational chart would be helpful. 
The people around me seemed to enjoy their food. Service was slow because they were crazy busy. We asked for soup spoons, twice, then received iced tea like spoons. We never had our water refilled, and didn't get much attention. Deni was our server, he was just too busy for us. He came by to ask us to fill out a survey and check in on Yelp to get some free ice cream. Another server plopped down the ice cream when we weren't done with our food - honestly I would have ordered more, but they never asked.

I went around 8pm on a Thursday and all the spots where the conveyor belts were taken so we were sat at the high bar. At first it was awkward because we were sitting with strangers but then it got comfortable after discussing what their favorites were

The service was exceptional. Our server explained to us the entire menu and his favorites which makes it easier for us to chose since we can be indecisive at times. 

I got the mushroom broth and ordered a variety of meats including the meat combo plate, cuttlefish balls and house meatballs. Enoki mushroom was delicious and the MUST HAVE game changer was the lamb skewer. I would go back and order 10 of those skewers. It was so juicy. And please do get the beef tongue - literally melts in your mouth. 

Also, in the center of the restaurant is a table with a bunch of different dipping sauces. Don't get the peanut butter sauce- it's definitely not like the peanut sauce you dip your spring rolls in. Do get the minced garlic and add that to your broth.

There is a bar full of different sauces where you can make your own concoctions. I'd recommend asking for an egg and putting some sauces. Might sound weird but it's bomb!

You choose your own soup base. One dislike that I have about the spicy soup base is that here are too many red rectangle pepper things. I honestly don't know what it's called, but every time I tried to scoop out some meat, I got some of those things along with it too which was kind of annoying.

Servers were polite and our drinks were refilled. They have a TV where they had the game playing. Pretty nice modern interior decor. 

Parking can be hard to find in this plaza, but it has always been this way. When there's a will, there's a way. Usually I will find a parking spot even if it is super busy.",OXTECc-hei5D-ONm39rwNA,0,0,5,0_lJtrcgURfNrojJ6IZcQg

3877277,2016-12-05,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"When I lived in the Northeast, I used to travel all the way to Montreal to find hot pot. Now that the weather is getting chilly in Vegas, I find myself in search of hot pot once more. Chubby Cattle is the newest hot pot restaurant in town. It's funny that it advertises itself as ""Chinese fondue"" and the interior decor is a little bit ridiculous, but whatever appeals to the masses. 

For those who have never tried hot pot, Chubby Cattle is a fun and interactive introduction. You start off by choosing a soup base. If you're sitting at one of the individual stoves, you can pick any broth except the Heaven and Hell, which is reserved to be shared between people on one of the larger burners. I stayed clear of the spicy broth and stuck with the House Original. Next, you choose an assortment of meats, vegetables, noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and whatever else you feel like putting in your hot pot. Otherwise, if you're sitting next to the conveyor belt, you pick whatever looks good that passes by.

For ingredients, the meats are high quality. I enjoyed the beef brisket, prime short rib, and lamb. The presentation of the mushrooms, vegetables, and noodles were aesthetically amazing. The mushrooms and vegetable combos look as if they had just been foraged from a farmer's market and come in a wooden basket. The arrangement of the assorted meatballs make it easy to cook by hooking it onto your pot without losing it into the abyss. There's also a sauce bar where you can mix and create your own dipping sauce. My personal preference was the fresh garlic, green onions, and white pepper in the ponzu sauce. 

Overall, dinner was fun and delicious. Everyone got a scoop of complimentary coffee ice cream. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and service was excellent. My one gripe about Chubby Cattle would be the cost for the amount of food we got. Everything was fresh and delicious, but we were pretty hungry even after a couple of rounds of meat and vegetable/mushroom baskets. It came out to be around $30 per person, which is on the expensive side considering it's hot pot (traditionally, a cheap homemade meal). Also Little Sheep (the franchise Mongolian hot pot) is all-you-can-eat for cheaper. If you're hungry and you eat a lot, you might want to look elsewhere.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,2,4,YXEhr6Ucp0LWLfbAZZr9jA
3884871,2016-09-12,3,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"I was super stoked when I heard about Chubby Cattle because 1) I love hotpot and 2) I love conveyor belts (come on, we are already cooking our own food, who is trying to do cardio walking up and down to the fridge while eating?! Am I right? Lol) 

Food: Chubby Cattle has a big menu with beautiful platted seafood and meat options. They also have noodles, vegetables, mushrooms, etc. on their menu. Their conveyor belt is also very impressive and I saw taro pieces to seafood to various greens. My brother and I ordered the tomato and seafood broth, and honestly I found them both very bland and flavorless. The seafood was very watered down and tasted like the seasoning from ramen packets (I read from other reviews that the mushroom and house special broths were also bland). The tomato broth was much better and probably the only broth I'll consider ordering if I come back. We also ordered the seafood platter, beef brisket (because my fave beef tongue was sold out), and vegetable noodles. The seafood consisted of muscles, scallops, shrimps, clams, and octopuses. Both the seafood and brisket dish were very fresh and did not seem frozen beforehand. 

Service: Mathew was our server and he was amazing. He answered all our questions, made suggestions, refilled our waters twice without us asking, cleaned up our table as soon as one of our plates were empty, and got our ice creams quickly. While all the servers seem stressed and all over the place, I found that our server kept his cool and smiled whenever he passed by. Thank you Mathew!

Overall: I'll definitely come back because the prices of the conveyor belt items were fair (ranging from .99 cents and up), the meat and seafood platters were great quality, and it was just a great experience to enjoy with family and friends. Hopefully they add more soup options or at least perfect their other ones because it sucks when the soup bases are so bland.",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,4,7,4,VTCaw_1CJvFnw-xm62bmuA

3955353,2017-01-01,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Been here twice and have had horrible experiences. On my first visit I sat by the conveyor belt. I would later find out that it was a bad decision. I like how they had lots of options and you choose what you want off of the conveyor belt, but there was barely any room for the plates on the table. The seats were squished together and my neighbor and I kept bumping each other which made it hard to be comfortable while eating. 

I love spicy food so I chose to go with the medium spicy soup base. Their medium was more like a 10/10 on a spicy scale. I was unable to enjoy anything because it was so spicy. The more the soup kept boiling, the spicier and more inedible everything became. I spent most of my time drinking water, and that's if the waiter even came around to fill my cup without me asking. 

I wanted to give it another try, so the second time around I asked for a table away from the conveyor belt and was planning to order a non-spicy soup base. I didn't make a reservation but the lady at the desk said it would take about 30 minutes. 30 minutes went by and the lady offered a conveyor belt seat. I explained that I'm willing to wait for a table because of the terrible experience I had last time. She said ok and said it should be a few minutes since they still had to clean a table that was just cleared. 15 minutes go by and the host says our table is ready. The waitress leads us to our ""table"" and to our luck she seats us by the conveyor belt. I tell the waitress that we specifically asked for a table and were waiting for a seat away from the conveyor belt because of our last experience, but she said that they can't seat us at a table because there was only 2 of us. 

After all that waiting they thought that we'd cave in and just settle for what we didn't want. No thanks! We simply walked out and had dinner elsewhere. Never coming back.",4mRn8s8SnFnqxFeb0jKZoA,0,0,1,-JkuigEWhe3CsjDUv2wSbQ

4006725,2016-08-24,17,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Interesting take on hot pot dining which ended up in unexpected pig out. I definitely felt chubby when I struggled to get up from the chair to leave. Good food and service made this experience a memorable one.

We sat at their bar tables with conveyor belt around which offers small hot pot items like mushroom, tofu and cabbage. I noticed that most people order with the servers and not picking off of the conveyor belt. It seemed more like a display. I hope those items are not spinning around for days and weeks. 

Simple concept. Choose your soup, sauce then meat/veggies. I got to try their original soup base and tomato soup but have to say tomato soup is a lot better. As for sauces, you can either order one off of menu ($2 each) or walk over to their sauce station and grab your own. If ordering a sauce, I recommend their original sauce. If are going to the sauce station, I recommend mixing the soy bean sauce with green onion and spoonful of garlic. More garlic the better. I overloaded mine with 2 spoonful of garlic and it was a bit excessive...ha

As for meat, I must say their beef tongue was off the hook. It was the perfect slice, not too thin nor thick. You are eating the meat shabu-shabu style so you don't feel heavy or bloated after eating, which can be good or bad. 

Skewers were good also. We got the lamb and beef. Lamb didn't have that strong gamy taste. Both were tender and not chewy at all. Servers couldn't tell the difference which was kind of funny. ""I got lamb and beef here. I can't tell the difference but you will know once you eat it"". 

Talking about service, you can tell they are new and trying hard. Our server constantly checked on us and gave some recommendation, though his face was way too close to my face (so close his facial hair brushed a few times on my cheek which made me flinch every time). Training should focus on menu knowledge as he didn't know what was included in the combo or the difference between certain items on the menu. 

Is it all a hype? Not really. Cool concept and good quality food served here. I can see myself coming back here again.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,35,31,4,OSBuUZgOk_z2zAXBUJM5xQ

Me and my party of two came here on a weekday about 2 hours before closing. The smell when you first walk in is very overwhelming, but not in a bad way. It's in a way where you get excited to eat! 

We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess. In all honesty, she is the only reason I am not giving them just a 1 star. 

After we explained that it was our first time here, our hostess was kind enough to explain how the menu worked. She went over the soup bases, meats, what was on the conveyor belt, and any additional side items. It was neither of ours first time going to a hot pot. But it was the first of this nature for both of us. And our hostess made ordering easy. 

The soup was tasteful and flavorful, while the brisket was my favorite menu item to order from. The conveyor belt idea is very creative and I'm glad to have experienced it. 

A reason for the negative stars is because we were both extremely dissatisfied with the service given to us by the other employees of this location, especially our waiter. We asked three times for a bowl for soup and rice (each time we ordered a new meat, we asked them about those two items) and we NEVER received EITHER of it. Not once did he check up on our table, but he did manage to find time to talk to his friend who so happened to visit. We were very upset that his friend ended up getting a bowl of rice, even though we ordered way before he was even seated. 

Overall, I wish again that I could like this place. But the (lack of) service that was shown to us really left a bad taste in our mouths. Maybe we caught our server on a bad day, or we just sat on the wrong side of the bar. Either way. We will not be returning.",t17wZ8sG4IKW67CaCRz3yQ,3,0,2,kCdE7lVbYQ-RpqRF5NBjHQ

We are currently in the keto diet so this was a great place for us. We ordered the hell out of some meat! Honestly my favorite was the chicken and thought least of their signature.

Upon entering they were right at our side explaining everything to us. There is high energy dance music playing which was pretty pleasant. The waiter was very good, attentive and fun. He let us know if we aren't making a mess then we aren't doing it right! 
They have a type of sauce buffet where you create your own sauces. That part was a lot of fun. A bit later I saw a long line to the sauce bar. I was very happy we had it all to ourselves when we enjoyed that part of our meal. The food is severed immediately.

My friends and I decided to get a nice meal in China Town last night and thought to check out Chubby Cattle because of its uniqueness, good reviews, and because I love Mongolian food and was dying to try the Mongolian pancake.

My friend arrived around 7:20 p.m. and put his name down for a table of four. The rest of us arrived a few minutes later. They told our friend it would be a 35-40 minute wait, and we were willing to wait for any table that opened (conveyor belt or not). A little before 8:00, I went in to double check the wait time for our table. This is when a series of customer service mistakes started.

First, the greeter pretended to not have our name written down. When I pointed it out, she said, ""oh yeah, we won't be able to seat you until 9:00."" which would have been about an hour and 40 minutes after our arrival. I asked her why she didn't inform us that the wait had changed because we didn't want to wait that long. She just got rude and combative and said that everyone else had reservations.

When I pointed out that other people who had arrived after us somehow jumped our name in line (my friend's name ended up being second from the bottom, despite people arriving after us) and asked if they had reservations she said no. At this point I was getting pretty upset and I asked why they were ahead of us and she just shrugged it off. Then she rudely handed me a business card and suggested that they were a reservations-only restaurant and that if we ever expected to get a table we should set a reservation. 

I was fuming at this point and after she argued with me for a few more minutes, I walked out to prevent myself from getting even more upset. We ended up walking over to Hachi, which is in the same strip mall, and the experience there was soooo much better. At Hachi, they apologized that we had to wait five minutes for a table and gave us menus to look at while keeping us updated about the process. 

I would never recommend going to Chubby Cattle based on their service. It seems that other people also have this problem, and I'm guessing it's a management issue that will not change. I understand that they are busy, and we were not upset about having to wait, especially on a Friday night, but we were outside and they had my friend's phone number so they could have easily informed us that our wait time had increased by over an hour.

However, this just wasn't for me.  The meats pretty much all tasted the same to me.  The majority of the flavor seems to come from the soup and so there wasn't any noticeable variety.  For the money I could have had an expertly cooked and seasoned steak.  The mushrooms actually were more interesting than the meat.

4095338,2016-10-24,8,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"First off, when you first enter the restaurant it had kind of a weird smell from the raw seafood. You get used to it after a while. What's cool about this place is that you get to build your own soup. The restaurant has this conveyer belt style so that you can choose what you want in your soup. 
So my man and I never really go to a lot of shabu shabu style restaurants. We decided to try this place out. We were soooo confuse. Our hostess gave us this attitude like she was shock we didn't know how to do it. Lady, that's why we were asking how to do it. Luckily, our server Matthew was great. He explained to us how to do it. So we ordered the original soup base and a medium spicy soup base. Let me tell you, I can handle a lot of spicy food but man that medium spicy soup base was SPICY!! I literally was tearing up. I had our server change my soup base to original.  So if you decide to get that spicy soup base, beware. 
Okay the reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because our experience was not so good. We were confuse. They had charged me for the spicy soup base when I only had one bite of it. I changed it to original. Usually restaurants can accommodate  that for you esp. if they notice you were burning up and tearing. And I didn't like how that hostess was rude to us. Also, the oysters wasn't fresh. :/
I did like the broth but I didn't like how the aromatics they put in the broth made it hard to enjoy. I found myself trying to spit it out. I know they gave us the slotted spoon but still it was hard to enjoy.",5OllWsrKJsYo3XQK6siRKA,11,6,2,n8F-gHffkH4HHPIJr5wlIg

4108239,2017-05-21,6,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"If I come here too often, I'm going to become a chubby(-er) Chris.

In spite of the telltale location in the corner of the popular and very parking-deficient Spring Mountain Plaza (Jones near Spring Mountain, also home to Chada and District One and so on), it didn't register to me that Chubby Cattle was once home to HK Star and then Imperial One until I saw the latter's name on my receipt. I only knew it as this ""Mongolian Hot Pot"" place that was getting talked about on Yelp and in foodie circles - until I finally went on the night of what was actually considered a grand reopening of sorts.

I was able to join a group of Yelp buddies to try out this Chinese take on hot pot, which differs from the common Japanese shabu shabu locally and the Vietnamese hot pot that accounts for most of my experience in this type of cooking. We eventually got seated at tables with support for individual hot pot support. This allows everyone to have their own choice of broth and to eat at their own pace. I find it more equitable than potentially having one person cook for the time, and more reasonable than the somewhat frenzied rush that I've seen in situations with one huge shared pot. Plus, you can still exchange tastes of different broths with your tablemates if you're so inclined.

Oxtail Soup Base ($6.99): interestingly, everybody at my table wanted to try what appears to be a new option, rather than their established and loved options such as original, tomato, or mushroom. I couldn't say that that the oxtail broth bestowed really distinctive flavors like a tomato broth might have, but it definitely added meatiness and was properly seasoned, the latter of which is essential because it's the vehicle for cooking everything else.

Beef Combo ($18.99, 13 oz): brisket, ribeye, Japanese Wagyu. I was advised that it was hard to discern differences between the thinly-sliced meats while eating, but I definitely tasted the rich marbling and tenderness wagyu before I realized what I was enjoying, and the ribeye was also enjoyable. The brisket is definitely tender and flavorful enough on its own and would be a reasonable budget option. These all cooked up quickly in the hot pot, so I was really just submerging them for a few seconds before pulling them out with some pinkness still visible.

Hand-cut Texas Dorper Sheep ($7.99, 5 oz): like the beef, thinly sliced. Unlike the beef, gamey flavor - but not all that gamier than lamb, although it was a slightly different quality. I definitely enjoyed it and would urge lamb-lovers to give this a try.

Mixed Mushroom Basket ($12.99): literally a basket of all of their mushroom options. I'm not so much of a mushroom connoisseur, so I could've been just as happy (and not so light-walleted) if I'd only picked up an order of enoki, but they were at least useful for texture and flavored my broth to the point that it tasted like mushroom soup by the time I was done with all the cooking and only had a little broth left to sip.

Veggie Combo Platter ($12.99) - couldn't exactly tell you which items are in here, but there were a few different leaves and herbs that add nuance and texture to your hot pot. This and the Mixed Mushroom Basket are probably best enjoyed with a larger group.

Green Tea Noodle ($3.99) - I wouldn't say that I tasted green tea, which tends to be a subtle flavor anyway, but the noodles tasted quite fresh. It's quite a small portion though, so you may need to grab double if you're hoping for a lot of noodle all the way until meal's end.

There is a sauce station in the middle of the restaurant floor where you can mix sauces and fresh components (especially green onion and cilantro) to your palate's pleasure. I was a bit unfamiliar with this, so I tried to follow their simple recipes which they suggested as pairings for beef (ponzu, green onions, and a little chili oil) and lamb (sesame sauce, sacha sauce, chili sauce) respectively. The beef sauce was pretty good, but I couldn't locate the sacha sauce for the lamb accompaniment and wound up throwing in soy sauce instead. I found myself not using the sauces at all about halfway through the meal though, because the combination of meats and broth were really that good.

Another note on the cooking: you'll want to adjust down your heat (ask a server if you can't figure it out) or else the water in your broth base will boil off too quickly, Play around with it and have fun.

I'd probably put Chubby Cattle at about 4.5 stars, but it's rather tough to imagine significantly better hot pot. The meats were very enjoyable from start to finish, the veggies were fresh, and the value was reasonable. I'll have to branch out to more meats and maybe even locate a seat near the conveyor belts next time, although that seems like a bit of an unnecessary gimmick in light of my excellent meal.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,9,5,dZ0DXe1LVUw1TtvJahfubQ

4152808,2017-02-01,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"After a few days in Las Vegas, anything other than more casino food was a welcome idea.  A friend of mine had apparently been to this place, and when he described it as a hot pot joint where food comes out on a conveyor belt for you to choose as little or as much as you want to eat, it was a pretty easy decision for the rest of us to agree to try this place out ourselves.

Being a dirty tourist, I can't speak for the location other than the fact that it was roughly a 20 minute ride using an Uber to get there from the south end of the Strip.  We ended up in what appeared to be very Asian part of town based on the stores rapidly changing from English to various Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names.  Eventually we arrived at our destination which was inside of a pretty packed and busy shopping plaza.

The interior of Chubby Cattle is very light, bright and welcoming.  Immediately upon entrance, you'll see the conveyor belt rolling adjacent to several booths, with lots of little plates containing various vegetables, dumplings, proteins and noodles.  We were lucky to not have a substantial wait, and were seated pretty quickly.  Service was quick, and gracious about explaining their process and pricing.

Basically, broth can be ordered individually or to share, and they come in a variety of spices and flavors.  Larger portions of meat can be ordered, raw, to which you will dunk them in boiling broth for a minute or so, before they can be eaten.  The conveyor belt has small portions of a wide variety of foods that are also cooked in the broth from anywhere from 2-4 minutes.  The color of the plates determine what each plate costs, and at the end of the meal, servers count and tally up all the plates at your table.

It's a pretty unique idea as far as I'm concerned, as the only place I'd ever encountered conveyor belts were sushi restaurants.  But the idea applies wonderfully to hot pot, and I have a lot of admiration for a place like Chubby Cattle at executing it in the way that they did.

Overall, I was very pleased with the dining experience, and I ate generously for roughly about $20 spent.  I had a wide variety of noodles, dumplings and lots of meat, and don't feel like I got shortchanged or cheated in any fashion.  Service was outstanding and friendly, and this is the kind of place that I'd tell my friends about, and actually want to come back to in future Vegas trips.",uq_xDJi7cmZ9wLE8v3X4Bg,6,1,5,WkIK42AxSPtSPR4tUaXXhA

4154561,2016-10-02,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Lets first say that the reason this place is getting decent reviews is they are either bribed (with ice cream apparently) or, they are getting stars for a gimmick - namely the conveyor belt.

If we talk about food quality, service, price this place gets demerits in all three:

Food Quality: 
I tried nearly every type of beef and lamb they had to offer - and frankly they were just ok. The sort of OK that you'd expect from an AYCE hot pot place, except this place isn't. In fact, if you travel two miles to the palms, there is an AYCE hot pot place that blows Chubby Cattle out of the water - the quality is good, and theres even more variety of vegetables and meats to choose from.

The broth, which is critically important in a hot pot place was just okay. So far, no one has lived up to the pretty mild standard of Little Sheep (I wish we had one of these in vegas!)

Service:
Service was pretty bad, but I did go opening week so perhaps they will work this out. Slow to check up when I was out of meat (which you can only get via ordering, because the conveyor belt only carries small items like little pots of veggies or small things like an oyster).

Price:
Way too expensive. I ended up leaving having spent around $80 for myself, trying all the items I wanted and actually was not that full. Each plate of meat costs like $10 (or so) and only comes with perhaps 5-10 thinly cut slices. I would've rather gone to any of the other hot pot places in town, namely the AYCE at the Palms or Yojie and would've had a much better meal for my money.



Long story short: This place is okay, but its overpriced. The service wasn't great, and you have tons of better alternatives: namely AYCE Hot Pot at the Palms which has better service, better food, better price, better options, or Yojie (which is more japanese style) but has significantly better quality.",t8d6cQ2VR7192Iuu6JAw0A,2,0,2,yF7QZF6NaGIZVGZCJFMFqg

Since everyone else has already reviewed this place in detail, there's not much for me to add. 

However, I suggest going there Sunday thru Thursday, when there are 2 for 1 specials, and specials on the conveyer belt ingredients for your ""hot pot"" meals, but again beware; you need to be a Student with an ID Card, or in the ACTIVE Military. 

The only reason I ""lowered them"" to 3 Stars is they are a little pricey, and very stingy offering promotions. So, beware, this place will most probably cost more than a really good ""all you can eat"" sushi place. At least most Sushi places give you a ""comp"" meal after 10 purchases.

I've had a lot of shabu-shabu (Japanese style), but not as much of the Chinese style hot pot.  On a previous visit to this shopping center for a reservation at the Thai place (also great), we saw a long like outside Chubby Cattle, investigated, and discovered it had just opened.  Filed it away to try later.

A month later, still quite busy.  Showing up without reservations seems to mean a 30-40 minute wait (there are some good tea places nearby to wait for the call...); I don't know how hard it is to get reservations.

Well worth the wait.  Essentially, it is hot pot where you order meat from the waiter directly, and then use the conveyor for additional plates of vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, etc.  There is also a sauce bar to make custom excellent sauces (Thai fish sauce was my favorite.)

Quality of meat seems to be excellent -- tried the beef combination and beef/lamb combination, as well as the hand-cut angus special.  We also had skewers of grilled beef and lamb (also excellent.). Watermelon juice was a good accompaniment.

The host will sit you & the server will come to give the menu also asked have you ever been there. If you said no, they will explain how it work. 

The First thing to do choose your broth.. original, oxtail, tomato, spicy (3 levels) for individual pot also they have yin yang (1 pot for sharing with your party). 

If you eat meat or seafood, they have chicken, beef, pork, seafood. You can order combo beef ($19) for your party, I believed have 3 differents type of beef in one plate and with only $1 you can choose your noodle (they have 3 different flavor..original, green tea, taro).

They have a menu alacarte for raw meat & other food like pot sticker or cook lamb or rice bowl dishes but the fun part, they have a conveyor belt next to your table ( which I like).You can grab anything you want, they charge each small plate depands of the color's plate. In that conveyor belt have vegetables, shrimp, scallop, beef ball, oysters, different types of mushroom, shrimp ball (have a surprise inside, REALLY RECOMMENDED delicious), quil eggs. 

My friend like his tomato broth & I order spicy broth level 6. I like my broth but I wish they put all herbs like garlic, bay leaves and more other stuff in the pouch so it make us easy to grab out food because it is hard to find your food with a bunch of herb in the broth. Don't worry about getting not enough broth, they keep refill the broth for us.

They have buffet table style for your sauce to make your broth or dipping sauce like hot chili oil, sesame paste, green onion, minced garlic, cilantro, mushroom sauce ( HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!! You can mix with your rice) & other sauce also they have bachan like cucumber salad, beans sprout (kimchi flavor), edamame.

Previously the sauce station was on what looked like a plastic wedding cake design now in a more buffet style, but is a bit cramp as many diners will be all over experimenting with sauces and other additions. The party area does boast individual hot pot stoves for large parties and a large stove in the middle for the larger broth option. 

Service: Pretty typical but it was a busy Saturday night, we seem to have three different servers tending to our tables. Drinks were a tad slow but nothing to lose yourself over. 

Food: The oxtail broth, new cuts of meat, add new items on the conveyor belt (chicken feet, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon). Being a big oxtail fan, I chose the oxtail broth which was... a bit bland. The sauce station helped play a nice role as I experimented with my broth by adding spicy, salty, bitter, sweet etc... till it matched exactly what I wanted. Wagyu was beautifully marbled with a nice chewy but not so melt in your mouth texture. 

Personal Choice: Tomato broth and the spicy broth are great! Brisket + Wagyu Beef + side of enoki + rice. Bam! 

Overall: One of my favorite places to eat hot pot. Great quality meat and savory flavorful broth, this place has it all!",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,6,4,5,RE6387WtTBNQAFrwVJ5mLg

The food was healthy, delicious and my favorite part was the sauce bar. The sauce bar is a delectable self-serve counter where you can choose from several sauces, including black bean sauce, fried garlic, house sauce, sesame oil, peanut sauce, etc. You can choose to dip, mix and eat your food with any number of sauces. Awesome, right? The food on the conveyor belt was fresh and didn't smell, due to the high turnover rate of customers. I enjoyed my meal and so did my boyfriend.

First, choose a broth for your personal hotpot. I'd recommend the heavenly tomato broth. It is SO GOOD, I don't even have to use sauce. Get it if you like Tom yum soup. Order the handmade noodles of your choice and a small amount of veggies for an extra dollar. Order any meats you'd like. Remember the portions are pretty filling! 
Then keep an eye out for your faves on the conveyor belt, which are veggies, noodles, some seafood, and tofus. The color of the place tells you how much each one costs. So many options. So little stomach room. 
There is a sauce bar toward the front of the restaurant - add whatever you'd like to the sesame sauce base. 
Oh, and Chubby cattle also has a bar!

Beef brisket- this was good and was a stomach filler. The Quail eggs is our favorite. (Meatballs, land, fish etc). The broth soup is even better towards the end when all the proteins and veggies had simmered together giving a tasty result. 

They also have a conveyor belt with food  over the counter that you can select from - and a self serve sauce area. Service was quick. Quality of food was phenomenal.

4448009,2017-07-21,4,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"My very first hot pot experience!

I came with extremely high expectations. Their rating on yelp is baller and a couple of my coworkers have raved about how amazing this place is.

Pros:
- Huge menu! Overwhelming but always great to have a variety of options 
- Conveyer belt of goodies which are constantly cycling. Veggies, meats, egg - you name it! There's a sign with the prices per colored plate and you can grab what you want off the conveyer belt at any time. Whatever you take will be added to the bill at the end of your meal, kind of similar to the dim sum concept
- Individual hot pots available so you can choose your own broth and place whatever you like in it. The group I dined with opted for this instead of sharing one large hot pot in the middle. I was with 5 others which made this a better option - if there were 3 of us total I wouldn't have minded sharing 1 large hot pot
- Love the self serve station with spices, sauces, and pickled sides - so you can make a concoction to your liking to either add into your hot pot or use as a dipping sauce for cooked meat/veggies
- Servers come by to refill your hot pot! If you're running low on broth, just request for more! 

Cons
- Service was slow. All the protein and veggies came out slowly in a random sequence that didn't make sense. We didn't receive our mushroom basket until the very end of our meal, which would have been nice to have had cooking in our hot pots earlier during our meal 
- Small portions (but very reasonably priced!) Make sure to order an abundance of any proteins if you're sharing, they go fast 

Overall this was a fun, new experience as I've never been to a hot pot restaurant before. I love soup, meat, and veggies... so this place is right up my alley! I will definitely be coming back to Chubby Cattle!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,7,6,4,cQ9DpjiHuI1MeuLUzHYwxA
4466897,2017-07-04,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"My friend is a hot pot fanatic so I did quite a bit of searching on yelp to find a good spot to have dinner for the both of us. The food and experience here was enjoyable. Service was nice. The conveyer belt is a great idea since I prefer only eating certain sides, I can pick and choose however I please. Their sauce bar had hot cheetos, which was a plus for me. I thought it was very sincere of our waitress to warn my friend that the spiciest broth was very strong. However, don't doubt my friend, she'll drop 10 more hot drops if she has to. When the broth came out, it wasn't spicy enough for her so she was disappointed with the hype. She liked the flavor nonetheless. The only thing that made her lose her appetite was the sour peppers she kept biting into in the broth. She recommends the kitchen puts the spices in a spice bag. 
If there is one thing that irked me about this place was that I did my research online before I came and the price for the Kobe was $25.99 for a 3 oz, $49.99 for a 6oz. The 3 oz was what we ordered. It was the only meat that doesn't state the price on the actual menu which seemed kind of sketch because it seems like they could just decide however much it could be at that point. I was too trustworthy. They charged me $50 for this and when I asked, they said the 3oz was for $50 and the 6 oz was for $100. I felt cheated and super annoyed. I probably should have brought up their menu online to confront them about it. I didn't want to ruin my experience here though by bringing up conflicts considering it was my friend's and my first time here and we did like it a lot... except for the sketchiness. Next time if I decide to come here, assuming I'll get over this situation, I'll ask for their prices first before I order.",XuS2mwvMKd88m4io3NV45w,0,0,4,ak5FCom6V76GIwQDx2xaJQ

About 5 of my friends came on a Thursday for dinner. We had made a reservation so had no problems with getting a table. The server was very good with welcoming us and giving a brief explanation of everything, but during our meal she wasn't super attentive with clearing plates or refilling our drinks. Maybe they're just overwhelmed by still being a new restaurant, but it definitely effected my overall experience.

Food wise it wasn't bad, but I honestly prefer doing hot pot at home better. I do love that they have tons of sides and meat choices and that you can get your own individual pot. As a group we definitely ordered too much food so I recommend starting with a few items and ordering as you go. For the broth I went with the spicy entry level. I personally did not really care for it. My boyfriend had the mushroom which I tried and thought was much better. I did enjoy the concept of being able to mix your own sauces, but wish they had some type of guidelines of what to mix or just some basics.

Our service was spectacular. This being kind of my first time, our server James was very patient and friendly when taking my questions. He explained the process and the food items, and took the time to wipe the glass of the conveyor belt line which condenses up pretty quickly. He checked up on us frequently and made sure our water was always topped off.

We had a large table for the two of us. We got a split pot, half mushroom soup base and the other their ""Heaven and Hell"" spicy base at mid level heat (it was too hot for me!) We enjoyed the brisket, beef tongue, and angus beef. All were delectable, especially the hand cut angus steeped in the Heave and Hell. We turned to the conveyor belt at our side for our add ons and everything was great and reasonably priced.

4785345,2016-11-28,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"I don't don't rave review really but what the experience I received is worth doing so.

I've been to many high-end restaurants thanks to business dinners that I get to attend when the my boss take our clients out ever so often.  The reason I bring this up is because the service I received here at Chubby Cattle was no less if not superior than what I get from restaurants that cost 5 times more money (I'm thinking even better than Mastro's in Costa Mesa which cost us $250/person last time we went).  Those expensive restaurant already come with service at professional level, but Chubby Cattle really blew me away with their super attentive and friendly service.

Our server Kwan was, well, the best I've seen especially for someone that young.  Kwan and his colleague James really made sure we felt well taken care of with every need we had in the restaurant.  As a family of 4 (2 kids, 1 = 2 years old and the other 4 1/2 years old), it's not easy to find every accommodations we need in places that we eat dinner at.  We normally don't go to hot pot places because it's potential disaster for the kids.  Chubby Cattle's hot pot sits below table surface so it looked safer than usual Chinese hot pot places so we decided to give it a shot.  At this restaurant we really felt like we were constantly checked on and they did everything they could to make our experience there at the best possible.  Manager Joyce even stop by at least 6 times to make sure we are well taken care of (and even brought carved turkey over later to make sure we got some!).

Now on to the food:

We got a split hot pot with tomato base on one for kids and wife, spicy on the other for myself.  The soup base is decent and about the only thing I wish for is the spicy level can be increased to even hotter/spicier!  I had the level 6 to begin with, then upgrade to level 12, then level 18, then asked to have more spicy chili paste (that's used to increase spiciness) until I feel bad doing so.  Note that the price between different spicy level is different for the soup base so expect to pay more for more spicy version.  If you can tolerate a LOT of Tabasco on your food or can eat Sriracha like it was nothing, I suggest you go directly to level 18.  This way you get what you want right away. 

My favorite: the beef brisket slices, it's best I've seen in Chinese hot pot restaurant in term of quality & portion.  The pork blood (I know it's not everyone's thingy...) was good too, as well as the seafood platter and shrimp paste for making shrimp meat ball.

We had a bunch of other things but the only other item I recall was the combo sliced beef plate.  There are 3 types of beef on it including the brisket mentioned above, I liked the 2nd one on it too the 3rd one was cut in a way that it basically crumbled and felt apart when you try to cool it in the hot pot (sorry I can't recall what the 2nd and 3rd ones were).

Self-served sauce table was complete with enough different options to cover different needs.

I hope this helps anyone who's planning on visiting the restaurant.  I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town.",L0cAQ4ihEXvpmzT2ibE6sQ,2,1,5,1KyI2ocvyKvCaHyZXQlH6w

It's hard to figure out sometimes what you want unless you see it.

4863381,2016-09-20,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"One of the new places to try an amazing hot pot. The fact that they open from 5 pm-12 am is actually a plus, since it means that everyone in the kitchen is not haggard and the meats are all fresh. The service is acceptable, still a little rough I guess. Just a few things, my mushroom soup base, which my mom also ordered took about 15 mins after everyone in our table start eating. So they were almost done while my soup barely makes bubble. Our server didn't explain on how things are done in their establishment. For example, the conveyor belt, how to turn on the individual stoves and also what is in the menu, or ask at least if this is our first time or are we a returning customer. It would've made the experience a little more better. Also, the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms of my boy friend ordered when our server was pitching the daily specials at the start of the meal arrived at the end of the meal, with the enoki burnt and the bacon not all the way cook. And this man, eats a lot of bacon. Daily specials, unless you actually have to harvest or kill a live animal should be part as the appetizer experience, to tease the taste buds on the next gastronomical adventure that would follow, not present it when the person is full and almost done with their meal.
All in all, it was an experience, I can't really say if it's good or bad and I do understand that they have a little bit more refinement to do. The soups though were perfection, yes they are bland at first but that's what the condiment/sauce/spice bar in the middle of the restaurant is for, to create your own flavors and make the experience and your imagination tingle for a little while.

I called, they said I didn't need a reservation. I Uber over and have to wait 30 minutes. I don't care, I love the food but I ask the manager to have the chef prepare me fish balls because I specifically came for them. After questioning me about whether or not I would eat them I ask for an order that the manager assured me of. I finally sit down with my party of five to receive my food to then find out that the fish balls I ordered were not only never made but the person that prepares them had left. I make an annual trip to Vegas and honestly I felt like a second rate customer. Possibly because we are a young group of males, I feel that the employees just never took us seriously and thats the fault of youth. It really sucked getting grilled from the manager about something you specifically want and they completely ignored the request when I show my patronage and support. My annual trip to this place may not happen anymore because of this. Damn shame, but honestly I felt almost disrespected by the fact that they ignored my eager desire to eat something they make specific hours for. I'm only writing this because the waiter asked me to write a review and be honest, hopefully they see this and listen when a customer speaks regardless of me being a tourist, a single male, or Asian. Was going to make it 3 stars but I had made a big deal about eating the stupid fish balls and showed up an hour and a half before the chef was supposed to leave, at 10:30pm, and yet i didn't get what I mainly came for. Couldnt give me my simple request and I felt patronized when I asked for it before sitting and expressed my concerns to it being prepared prior to me getting a table which could have been after I was seated.

4992182,2016-08-24,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"We love the food here, we really REALLY do. If it was based on the flavor and quality of the food alone, then I'd easily give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately, service plays a huge factor in the overall dining experience. 

We've been here twice now within a week because the flavor and quality of the food is that good! However, the staff is very clearly inexperienced. Some don't even really speak English that well either. I can speak Mandarin too, so I don't mind because I can just switch languages to accommodate. But they don't really know their own menu or the fact that the soup for children 12 and under is marked as half price on their menu. I get that they're new, but part of the hiring process should include hiring experienced management who can teach and lead a successful staff... and training that staff prior to opening. 

When we came here last week, the hostess gave me a business card so I can call and check on how we were progressing on the 45 min wait we were quoted. We weren't planning on going anywhere so I didn't have a need to call that day. Today, I did call because I knew they took reservations. Guess what? The phone number printed on their business card is wrong. The number here on Yelp is correct though so I was still able to call. When we got there, I mentioned the error to the hostess, who then pointed it out to the manager who had no idea of the typo. He even grabbed a phone to try calling the number himself (though I would think that most people should know the phone number to their job and just recognize the typo). Did everyone from the owners, management, wait staff, etc not notice this?? Or is this more a reflection of a staff that doesn't care? 

Now let's talk about the dining experience. On both visits, it took a while between getting seated until anyone acknowledges you to take your order (in the 20 min ballpark). Once you've ordered, it will take equally as long to get the soup. The stuff you order from the menu won't come out together either, or even relatively at the same time. For example, today we ordered 3 plates of meat and 3 large bowls of noodles off the menu. The noodles and one plate of meat came out quickly, but we were literally done with all of that and everything we took from the conveyer belt before the last 2 plates of meat arrived. Our drinks didn't come out together either! There were 4 of us and only my juice came out before the food. After the food came out we asked about the 3 waters... which was met with the waitress bringing one and walking away. Which led to us having to hail her down again to get 2 more. Really? I also saw the waitress talking to the table next to us... and one of the bussers interrupted her from helping those guests to show her/comment on the tip that was left by the next table over. That was probably a conversation that could have been saved for when the waitress wasn't at a table in the middle of talking to a customer. Whatever the case, with all of the delays with their service, both visits we've made have turned out to be 2+ hour ordeals, which is excessive for hot pot. After today, we're totally not that motivated to come back anytime soon. Based on service alone, we'd rather pay more and drive further to go to Red Pot even though their food quality isn't as good.",qIZNrA256rP0x6qkgakFFA,4,0,3,YU0-9Ad669XIT7OVLlt23A

5018236,2016-10-25,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Came here with my friend on a Monday night to try this conveyor belt hot pot themed restaurant. The inside is nice. They decorated it for the Halloween theme right now. There's bar seating and table seating with a conveyor belt of raw ingredients floating by for your hot pot. There's also a sauce bar off to the side where you can build you own savory dipping sauce. 

When we sat to order the waitress explained how this restaurant works. Its individual pots per person. You get to pick the broth and spicy level. Each broth is 3.99 to 6.99 depending on type and spicy level. Next you order all big items, meats, veggies and hand made meatballs from her. The items on the conveyor belt are smaller items like mushroom, bean curd, tofu, raw fish, veggies etc. So for the two of us we got the meat combo, veggie combo, and on her recommendation, the small portion of the shrimp paste. From the conveyor we got the beancurd, quail eggs and fishball with roe inside. My friend also got the mango juice and a bowl of rice. The flavors of the broths were good. Very flavorful. They are also very generous for refilling it. I thought the ingredients were fresh and delicious. Meat was good, veggies were good. 

The reason why I give this three stars is for the price. For the two of us it was 80 bucks total. That's a whopping bill for hot pot. You might as well go to an all you can eat hot pot restaurant for less than 30 bucks a person. They charge you for everything.. Broth, rice.

""Practicing?""  I say.

""Yep.  I bought a some. grilled it. and ate it.  Taste pretty good doused in BBQ sauce"" his reply.

""OK, let's go.  Errr and good luck"".

Snazzy, contemporary feel, HD monitors everywhere, plexiglass cutouts in the table to protect your mobile, and a conveyor belt filled with raw foods.  

Simple hotpot concept.  Choose the broths, choose the proteins and veg (help yourself is seated by the conveyor belt and pay by the plate colors), cook in your personal or communal pot if you wish, dip in a sauce, and eat.

The broths sampled (house and ""hellishly spicy"" mid level heat) are wonderfully aromatic with the pronounced flavor of ginseng, cardamom, cinnamon, and other oil based spices (unsure of the extract but it has a bitterness and green vegetal finish similar to chrysanthemum).  It's not for everyone.  The broth is mildly seasoned.  Use of the dipping sauces is required to get the fullest flavor.  Warning, spice heat is achieved with dry chilies and LOTS of them.  

Good selection of mushrooms and relatively fresh veg.  Very good selection of proteins including multiple kinds of tofu, free ranged chicken, USDA choice to Wagyu beef, lamb and a plethora of live seafood.  Of course, wanting the authentic, it's all about the lamb and mutton. (Mongolia is land locked isn't it?)

Tip:  If it doesn't live together, don't cook them together.  That is unless you want to create a very ""unique"" soup.

- Mutton (thick sliced) - pronounced gamey flavor, lots of external fat.  Cooked rare for best flavor.
- House special lamb - thin cut, cooks instantly.  Very little fat.  Subtle leg of lamb flavor.
- Supreme lamb shoulder - most connective tissue, least lamb flavor.

Finally, do not pass on the charcoal grilled skewers.  the spice rubbed lamb, moist though cooked through and tasty lamb ribs with its melting fat and chewy connective tissue just good eats.   Both are well seasoned to enhance the classic lamb flavor.  A grilled ""French style"" rack of lamb, very aggressively seasoned with a spice rub, cooked through but tender with the cleanest lamb flavor; too fancy.

Patient and helpful servers who are willing to take the time to explain the many options.

Everything else here is a-la-carte,  I would opt out their certified Waygu grade 5 steak and stick with their beef and lamb offering.

5226911,2018-06-28,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"To start off, I'd like to say that the staff is very nice. That being said, it was still a disappointing experience. I'm a newbie to hotpot, and I was used to the checklist format found at Little Sheep. To say the least, I was a little intimidated by the thought of a conveyor belt. I ordered the mushroom broth and my S.O. ordered the medium spicy pot. We sat in front of the conveyor belt for 10...15...20 minutes with no broth. We started to wonder if we were supposed to go somewhere to actually get the broth.

Finally, the broth came out, then the veggies, then the meat. The meat was decent quality and the veggies we ordered were fresh, but the pieces of cauliflower garnish that came with my tomato noodles were moldy - not like a few spots of black that one may just cut off at home, but like an entire half of a piece was trimmed off to account for the mold.  The food from the conveyor belt, however, was dried out. We went during happy hour, so it was understandable that the conveyor belt wasn't a fresh as possible, but some of the items were shriveled enough that they weren't readily recognizable as food. Also, the conveyor items come on cafeteria style plates, with plastic covers (most of them cracked and frosty), giving a very cheap feel.

The food was good, but not good enough to warrant the price tag.",5fXKmEl7BKM05FeXDkZqQA,0,0,2,OiDMF6No-MXv2KatfUOzsA

5333659,2016-11-01,6,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Hot pot is something you don't hear to often in the Las Vegas foodie scene let alone Mongolian food. To my surprise, I was very excited about this restaurant opening especially finding out that they would have a conveyor belt full of various dishes.

The family and I decided on this place because we were pretty much Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Filipino out. We have been wanting to try something new and different for a awhile. Since I'm the designated unofficial planner for my family. I pulled up my Yelp account and came across Chubby Cattle that I bookmarked.

When we got to Chubby Cattle, the staff immediately greeted us and we were seated upon entering within 2 minutes on a Friday night. We got place with a table that was next to a conveyor belt, because not all seating arrangement have a conveyor belt. Our server Kwan, was very friendly and attentive to our needs and explained to us the concept. We decided on the Halloween Special Combo at the time since it was suggested by our server. We got a huge pumpkin carved out wit a variety of meats, shrimp & dumplings. Included was a bowl of various vegetables. I personally like the fact that the Hot Pot was built with a divider so we had the option of 2 soup base. One was tomato paste broth and the other was a mushroom flavor broth. Both were delicious and paired well with everything that came on our combo. There was a few dishes we added ala carte from the conveyor belt like quail eggs which happens to be a favorite of mine and my sisters. Overall the whole experience was amazing and definitely will be a topic for discussion with our extended family and friends. The cool thing about our dinner was how my parents actually enjoyed their meal. Even though they are biased with many Asian restaurants. 

The only thing I noticed that could be improved on is their clarification of the menu. It could use more description of what is being offered and specifically how big of a portion each combo can feed. Plus the options of adjusting according to group sizes would be beneficial. However, everything was great and I would recommend everyone to try this dinning experience out!

Kwan, Thanks again for the awesome service! :)",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,10,8,4,gqGqfaaG1DvrzKZV1otkpg

5349212,2016-08-20,4,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Chubby Cattle, I really wanted to like you. I have been waiting for you to open for ages. Ever since I heard wind of ""Little Lamb"" opening and that it is a similar concept to Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, I had been ecstatic. 

Chubby Cattle has a very interesting concept when it comes to hot pot. For half of their tables, everyone at the table gets their own individual pot. The other half gets a shared pot for those who don't mind. On top of that, they have a conveyor belt for certain hot pot items that you can grab. The items are on different colored plates that differentiate the cost of each item. Just keep in mind that meats and a majority of the seafood items won't be on the conveyor belt. 

My friends and I came here last night for dinner. When we first got in, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to ask if we have reservations. Her question threw me off because I have never been to a hot pot place where they asked for reservations. She then told us that she could seat us but it would be shared pot and it will not be by the conveyor belt. 

We want to be able to experience the conveyor belt and we told the hostess that. Instead of giving me an estimated time, she just gave me negative statements such as, ""I just can't sit you there right now. I have a reservation coming in at 7:15, 7:30, etc. I just can't."" Well, that's great. Why do I care about what reservations you have coming? She eventually told us that it'll be a 45-60 min wait. She said she'd call us if the table was ready early or we can come back in an hour. Sure enough we came back in an hour and when she saw us, she told me, ""I tried calling you but it didn't work."" I was really tempted to say, ""Well, did you dial 1 first?"" Without another word, she walked off. So, the hostess is unprofessional, not personable, overwhelmed, and doesn't know how to use a phone. 

When we got seated, the table wasn't completely set up. Why? Because the hostess sat us without taking that into mind. It took a while before we got to order our soup bases and when we did, our server told us they were out of their original and original spicy. Well, why am I here then? I almost walked out but the manager came up to inform the server that if we were willing to wait 10 minutes, then the original and original spicy would be ready. And of course we opted to wait. In the end, I ended up with their original spicy soup base at medium. It was pretty bland in flavor. The soup tasted like spicy water that smelled like spicy herbs. 

When we looked through the menu, we were a little curious about some of the dishes. There were single dishes and then there were combo dishes. We wanted to know the differences between them -- like, what is the better bang for our buck. We asked our server and he knew nothing. The manager had to come over to explain. Even then, according to the server, the beef & lamb combo platter, they don't serve the dishes by weight. The kitchen just does the best that they can to fill the plate up. So if I knew someone who worked in the kitchen, I can get a hook up right? We ended up ordering a plate of beef brisket and lamb shoulder. The quality of the beef brisket wasn't that great but the lamb shoulder slices were decent.

Aside from the meats, we also ordered napa cabbage and watercress. The napa was fine but the watercress wasn't fresh at all. A lot of yellow and browns on the leaves. We also ordered their fresh thick noodle and when I was ordering it, the server suggested the noodle combo. Of course, being curious, I asked what's in the noodle combo. He told me it was random and the kitchen decides on that. Well then, why am I ordering from a server? Should I just order from the kitchen directly? Maybe they'll know more about what's being served to me. On that topic, the fresh thick noodles were not fresh -- they were dry. They were also not thick, they were thin. They were thinner than spaghetti noodles. The texture of it was really good though and tasted great when cooked in the spicy soup base. I just wish they were thicker. 

From the conveyor belt, we got some king oyster mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, and glass noodles. They were pretty okay but we also noticed that a lot of the plates were not consistent in the amounts. Some plates looked like they had more product than the next even when it's the exact same item. 

Our server did apologize for his performance. It was his third day on the job and he was overwhelmed and his knowledge was limited. I'm not sure if that's the greatest excuse but I do appreciate the apology though. 

Bottom line, I'm not sure if I would return. The establishment has a great outward appearance to everything they do: conveyor belt, presentation of their seafood plates, table set up, etc. But the service wasn't great from square one and the quality of certain items were only average unless you spend a lot more. I've experienced better in general. The conveyor belt was a fun experience though! Was worth it just once.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,10,2,2,lrLbxVwr7NQ_0Qp_O61Ecw

5363143,2018-07-01,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"So I really love eating here but a few small things keep it from being five stars. First the good, love the concept of individual hot pots and pulling the mix-it's from a conveyer belt. It's engaging, interactive and fun. The staff is generally nice and the most of the food is really tasty. I know now what I like and I get it every time and so I know it will taste great. Get the tomato broth base its phenomenal with mushroom a close second if you like it filled with all kinds of different mushrooms. The spicy soup base is almost inedible, just avoid it. It's too frustrating to eat because it's filled with so many inedible herbs and roots, like eating a soup of tree bark. And it forces you to separate your edible mix-ins from the inedible items which takes forever. You're trying to eat a noodle and it's wrapped around a stick, arghhh.

So the few downsides, the array of side snacks (along with sauce mix-ins) is so often depleted well before closing. We show up with hours until close and the bind of things like edamame or fruit or crackers or whatever that day are almost always empty and don't get refilled. Secondly the conveyer belt selection is hit or miss and there's no rhyme or reason to what they put out. Sometimes there's a lot of one thing and nothing of others, and it's frustrating that seemingly the two sides of the belt are not connected, so often I see something on the other side of the room that will never come to us. So I've taken to getting up and walking over to the other side of the restaurant to check the other selection.

Also the pricing is weird and ordering something from the server is often 2-3 times the belt price which is frustrating when you have to ask for it cause they forget to restock the belt. They don't consistently give everyone the same utensils so I go to serve myself the soup and I have a slotted spoon but others have a ladle. You have to ask for what should just be there. Overall these are all issues of inconsistency. It doesn't ruin the experience, just annoying when I love the food. But it doesn't seem to bother most people cause it gets pretty crowded. I'm one of those regulars so for all it's flaws, it's still pretty great!",kElc6D9tbPVjbTL0HJ0--A,0,0,4,5hsry1fJTwwS1LMaUS7MEQ
5365287,2016-09-28,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"First time I came here was little than a week ago. I came here with 2 friends and my girlfriend and we're very excited off of the reviews, let alone the sound of this place. To start, the first time was amazing, great service and great food. Our waiter was attentive and the hostess made sure things went well. HOWEVER the reason of my review is because of our second trip which was tonight. 

My girlfriend and I went because the first time was amazing. However, it was one of the most irritating times I ever had at a restaurant and usually I'm very easy to please. The hostess was PERFECT as always but the server wasn't. I don't know if it was his first time or not but I see it how if you mess up once, fix it. First we ordered the beef combo and got a lamb and beef and after I tried politely to tell him it was the wrong order, he told me I was the one who ordered it and it wasn't his mistake. I didn't order it and what I originally ordered was more expensive so why would I lie about that in the first place when I'm about to pay for the more expensive one that I ordered?? Second, through our meal it seemed as if we offended him with getting what we originally ordered that he stopped attending to us. Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal til we had to stop someone and ask for a refill. Next our server attended to the people to the right of us, skipped over to the left of us and finally I was frustrated and made eye contact til he finally came over to us and checked on us. After that the group to the right of us interrupted us while I was asking for something and he walked away to attend them! He also interrupted us in the middle of our meal to ask if we're done, keep in mind we started way after the people around us, felt as if we were being pushed out. 

Got to the end of our meal and my girlfriend and I wanted to take our food home because we were full. We had A LOT leftover and the server came to us and only brought 1 container and said they don't have anymore. I was upset because not only did they not have anymore containers for myself to take home the extra amount of food I'm paying for and had leftover, he said to us ""You guys should try and finish it."" ARE YOU SERIOUS? How are you going to tell a customer to finish their food because YOU'RE out of containers? Let alone he told us multiple times to try and finish it?! The nice hostess again stepped in, ran to another restaurant and helped me. After all this, one of the chefs in the kitchen they have opened to the customers eye's to see, I saw him staring at us like we were ridiculous and laughed. He was the white chef with glasses. I also heard him clearly joking around with his coworkers about how we made them run around to get us stuff for our leftover food. SMFH. I was highly pissed off at this point. 

I feel horrible ever writing a post like this and I barely ever do but my girlfriend and I were highly disrespected here. I worked and managed restaurants and kitchens as well as have my own business. I know what customer service should be.",Ho-AEMY_TW55MInaG8QRPw,1,0,2,SmaKdhrrljRMLY8ZdpyNNw

The meat is always so goooood. I love the rib-eye and brisket. I've tried the spicy broth, house original, and mushroom. When I ordered the spicy one, I didn't really take them seriously and went for a medium level, I think it's best to start with the entry level spicy if it's your first time here. I honestly can't tell if I like the mushroom or original hotpot better, both are really tasty. The mushroom is a more subtle broth but if you love mushrooms like me, it's great.

Honestly, I really, really like this place, but I can't give in 5 stars because it's sooo expensive, overpriced in my opinion. All of the Shabu-shabu places I've been to charge for their meat, and the choice of broth comes with your order of meat. Those shabu places also include a vegetable platter and a bowl of rice. At Chubby Cattle, they charge you separately to add rice, any veggies are their own prices on the menu, and the broth itself is also charged to your bill. Everything adds up so fast!! I feel like at least rice should be included because it's kind of hard to just eat meat in sauce for an entire meal.

Also, the cilantro in their self-serve sauce bar could be a bit fresher... (some of it is turning black sometimes...)",m7tqUT0h_6LaktH9RSZoPQ,0,0,4,FlzXDOhTEbx_LfN42X5jqQ

5463277,2017-06-04,2,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Despite the absence of conveyor belt sushi's in Vegas, they somehow have revolving hot pot. Go figure. For those who have never had revolving anything, here's the breakdown. Each plate is color coordinated by price and there's no limit to how much you can have. I mean, you pay for each plate, so no one will stop you. If what you want is not on the conveyor belt, it may be requested. 

We picked up noodles, fish balls, and veggies. Clear noodles were the cheapest at $.99, while the fish balls were about $3 

You choose your broth, meat and anything extra, like rice, you want to buy right away. Remember that broth is refillable so don't skimp on those slurps of soup. To fill your broth with extra flavor, there is an unlimited condiment station that is full of different sauces. My favorite has to be the peanut butter, garlic and peanut bits mixture with a hint of chili paste. The flavor was just perfect.

Definitely coming back here when I'm in Vegas!!! When walking in, the food train had already caught my eye. It wasn't until I turned my head right to see a bright godly light shining on their sauce bar..

I'm known for being a sauce boss and to see their sauce bar amazed me. However, I did think it repeated itself but I walked around and nope!! Not at all. ALL different sauce so I added each one into my bowl. 

My favorite thing at the bar was the enoki mushrooms wrapped with beef was my favorite dish; we had to get two! We also got the lamb and beef which was good. The charcoal lamb racks were delish as well.

5518174,2016-12-06,8,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"This was my first time ever trying a hot pot, and I chose this place specifically because of their conveyor belt attraction, which we all know is a very scarce find in Las Vegas. 

Being a first timer, I was very overwhelmed by the options on the menu. The list was so extensive, I had no idea what was good and what wasn't, so it was one of those moments where I literally went with my server's recommendation. Gilbert, by the way, was fantastic, having a vast amount of knowledge on hot pot, and helped make my experience less intimidating. 

I ordered a variety of meats on their list in the end, not really knowing what to try. In the end, I think I can safely say that the Beef&Lamb combo was the winner for me. All the meat was such great quality, sometimes it felt like a shame for me to put it into a boiling pot instead of grilling it. Haha. 

On the other hand, this may just be silly old me, but I assumed that you don't really drink the broth because they gave us straining ladles, and there was no other utensil in sight for us to put the soup into our bowls. So yes, silly me, but also silly them for not giving us the right ladle (it was on my second visit where I learned you drink the broth too). It would've been helpful to know the first time before we spent a whopping $70+ on our meal, trying to get full but still left unsatisfied. 

On our second visit, we brought family, a party of 7 seated in a booth for 6. There was only one pot to share among 7 people, which we all felt was very inconvenient and uncomfortable. We had the right ladles, at the very least. Perhaps consider adding a 2nd hot pot for tables accommodating to larger parties so they don't all have to huddle around one small pot. 

Despite the inconveniences, I loved the piping broths and A quality meat of their hot pots to the point where I couldn't give Chubby Cattle any less of a score than a solid 4.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,8,8,4,sN98DiJ5hz8lCWIt3vl4jQ

5529649,2016-09-01,99,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Even though eating this kind of thing in the middle of summer is as strange as having a popsicle in a snowstorm to me, the fragrant scent of boiled meats and other delights coming out of the kitchen squashed any of those concerns upon entering.  I walked to the table as quickly as possible to dive into it all.  

The excellent ingredients and presentation totally take this place to the next level.  Their beef and lamb combo platter was sliced red meat pornography and tasted even better with their vast array of sauces (the BBQ one seemed most popular).  The seafood combo platter packed with shrimp, scallop, octopus, squid, and mussels with its dry ice center garnered the ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" it was looking for.  Even the people at a neighboring table came over to snap pics.  We also ordered the meatballs, live scallops (huge!) and the short rib; all top notch. 

My only real gripe is with the menu itself.  There are a lot of options and it could be daunting for first timers to the restaurant, let alone this type of dining experience as a whole.  It's probably even more annoying for staff since they have to constantly answer questions that could easily be clarified on the menu, like portion size.  To save everyone time, offering combo meals for 2, 4, and 6 people with a little bit of everything should be considered.

- While a cool novelty, the conveyer belt will go ignored unless dining solo or if you're the only one yearning for a plate of blood tofu or cuttlefish.  We ordered a lot and it was more than enough.  It isn't important or as fun to sit by as I thought it would be.    

- Dipping high quality beef into boiling water is never worth it.  Avoid the ""Kobe"".

- I really want to go spicy next time!

- Can we PLEASE STOP calling this fondue?

It can be a bit overwhelming if you come in cold turkey, though the staff is friendly and can help a lot.

5715802,2016-08-21,10,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Visited on Saturday 8-20-16 at 5:30 pm.  We were asked if we'd like individual hot pots or a communal one and we chose the communal pot.  

The process is easy...pick what type of broth you want, then order your raw items to throw in it, and you can pick up more items from the conveyor belt if you're sitting close to it.  

For $75.28 we got a yin-yang pot of broth, a small order of enoki mushrooms, grilled shrimp, grilled chicken gizzards, fresh thick noodles, napa cabbage, hand-cut angus beef, beef meatballs, steamed rice, pork dumplings, chicken breast slices, three soft drinks, scallops, sausage, salmon, and crab sticks. 

After ordering we were urged to check out the condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant.  It's a circular table with pots of seasonings and sauces and everything was labeled but the writing had faded off of the labels so it was impossible to tell what was inside.  After peeking inside all the containers I chose a spoonful of an unknown brown goo that turned out to be quite tasty.  

They were out of a few items we wanted to order like the wagyu fried rice, duck flippers, and the server didn't even know what the pumpkin cake was even though it's on their menu.  They are still pretty new and trying to get the hang of things I guess.  

Grilled chicken gizzard skewers were tasty! They were a little spicy but tender and yummy. The ""grilled shrimp skewer"" from their menu was just 6 grilled shrimp on a plate. No skewer LOL weird! 

Items coming down the conveyor belt are not labeled and I couldn't really tell what all of them were.  There were a few items that looked like they were fried balls or dumplings but the case is refrigerated so that didn't really make sense. 

We chose half house broth and half tomato broth.  I didn't really like either one...neither was salty enough and they were both very...herbal?? Like a pho broth but thicker and pungent.  All of the items we ordered appeared fresh but none were presented in cool containers like I see in other pictures on yelp and their website.  I think you have to order one of their more expensive ""combos"" to get the neat presentations with the dry ice and dish gardens.  

This place is definitely worth the trip and I really enjoyed my first hot pot experience here.  The decor is awesome as well and I love love love their light fixtures and modern tables.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,19,18,4,2qxFpd6pGhme8g5-lv2DYQ

5765932,2017-01-08,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Overall: If there were a Chubby Cattle in Southern California, I might actually get hot pot more often. They have solid soup bases and fresh food at a decent price point for a build-your-own hot pot place. It's more of a 4.5, but I am rounding it to a 5.

Food: 4.5

How It Works: You pick a soup base, which is priced per person, and then you order protein, veggies, and noodles to put in your broth. There's a bar for you to get condiments, including sauces and garnishes.

House Original Pot: This is a traditional broth with dried jujubes, Chinese herbs, corn, and a few other veggies. It might not be for everyone because it does smell and taste a little like those Chinese herbal medicines, but I thought it was nice on a super cold night. Tip: Add a little fried garlic and green onions to round off the flavors.

Assorted Mushroom Pot: As it name states, it is a broth made with an assortment of mushrooms. This is one of my favorites because I love mushrooms.

Dragon King Seafood Pot: If you love seafood, this is the broth that you should pick. Their online menu has 3 different choices as 3 different price points, but they only had 1 choice ($6.99) on the day that I visited.

We ordered Beef Tongue, Seafood Combo Platter, and Veggie Combo Platter. All of the food was really fresh. I definitely recommend ordering the platters to share because they are a better deal and they allow you to try a decent variety if it's your first time. We definitely did not spend a lot (~ $60), but we were stuffed.

ALSO, the owners gave us a free order of wagyu beef because they found out that we were visiting from a different state. Yay!

Service: 4.5

Our waiter was very patient with us and even made some recommendations to help us save money because it was our first time. However, I wished that he explained the restaurant concept to us in a little more detail. He did not explain the conveyor belt or the sauce table to us, so we had to figure that out on our own.

However, the owners do seem to care a lot about what their patrons think. A woman, who I assume is the manager, stopped by to ask us about our meal. She also promised that they would read any comments that we left on their comment sheet or on Yelp. Hopefully, they actually act upon the input that the customers give.

Ambiance: 3.5

The restaurant is located in a quiet plaza not far from the Strip. Even though we came fairly late (~9 pm), there was still a short wait of about 20-30 minutes. I believe that they have a couple of private rooms in addition to the common dining area. The restaurant is pretty cute and decently clean. However, the restaurant could benefit from better ventilation as the smell of all the broths can be slightly overwhelming when you first step into the restaurant. Furthermore, the bathroom is surprisingly dirty in contrast to the restaurant.",scWPwwaZeZsk0OzJ856z-w,2,0,5,WMhHWYiCvSvh_9TUkTlw8A

The Chubby Cattle, literally translated as Cow Demon King, is one of the best.  Ingredients are fresh, and the flavors are delicious.  Do not spend extra on the fancy $25 Waygu beef.  We tried it, and it was no where as tasty as the ribeye at $9.99.  The large condiment bar has every flavor you want for dipping, but be careful or you will go home stinking of delicious garlic.

Negatives were - broken credit card machine forced me to drive to an ATM at 11 PM in Vegas.  Seriously, what self respecting business doesn't have a mechanical swiper? 
It took about 10 minutes at 10 PM to find parking due to the packed lot.  You may consider parking near by.

5873467,2016-12-29,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Went to this place twice because I liked it enough the first time to come back again - the second time with my family (a total group of 7). 

FOOD: I really enjoyed this place because of how many options you get given the conveyor belt. You start off with a soup base - the first time I tried the spicy soup base which I didn't like too much but 2nd time I got the tomato soup which reminded me a lot of Thai tom yum soup yum! We ordered the beef combo which comes with a generous amount of meat for around $17. My go to items for the conveyor belt are the rice cake, tofu, and fish balls but haven't really had the chance to try everything. All in all, I understand how people can get lost or feel overwhelmed with the menu. 

SERVICE: Main reason for a 3 star rating instead of 5 is because of how my family and I were initially treated when we came in. We came in around 11:30p looking to try their buy one get one on the conveyor belt stuff. When we came in, I told the host we had a party of 7 and a lady said ""Uhhhh 7?"" And continued to quickly walk away saying something I didn't understand. Right when we were seated, the same lady told us that we need to ""please hurry and order quick"" because the kitchen closed in 10 minutes. What? Your hours say you close at 12:30a? Then, a male server approached our table immediately and asked us if we were ready to order even though we weren't even given menus yet! He then started to tell us that they weren't doing the buy one get one special since it was a holiday, but it was Dec 29? By this time, I was so annoyed and ready to leave but decided to stay since we drove all this way and was really excited for my family to try this place. The male server then continued to tell us that we need to hurry because their kitchen is closed and I asked if we could still get stuff from the conveyor belt and he said they were closing it down very soon and we may not have time. So we quickly got our food from the conveyor belt and during this time, we were told multiple times by the same and different people that they closed in 5 mins. Ok, ok I get it that's why we're rushing. The lady came back to our table and asked ""did you order yet??"". I was shocked - your hours say you close at 12:30. Keep the kitchen open until then or change your hours! I know not to expect much in terms of service for restaurants in Chinatown but this was just unacceptable.",yP4Xs0pRH8Uqn-BaEOmJFA,0,0,3,hkZtqxI7uhrALw-3fCJbBg

+ portions
+ vegan/vegetarian selections
+ open sauce bar (loved this!) 

THE DECENT
~ broth
~ forgetful, but apologetic service 
~ pretty pricy

THE BAD 
- conveyor belt stuff, the items you order off the menu seem more fresh 


Overall, a great (but pricy) soup option in Chinatown. Be wary of over ordering, and bring an appetite!

5947391,2016-09-06,0,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Cute little place that just opened up a few weeks ago. We decided to come here last minute for a nice dinner night and were greeted with a wait time of about 20 minutes. I can definitely see this place go up to 1-1.5hr wait times after the word gets out on this place, especially on weekend nights. Make a reservation if you could! 

If you want to spend a leg and an arm, you should definitely check out Chubby Cattle! It's clean, new and the ""restaurant"" that everyone is talking about these days. Unfortunately, we had a mixed review about this place. First of all, we didn't order a dish and another server delivered it to our desk and got frustrated when we said it wasn't ours. Our original server came to check on us and he apologized profusely for the mistake. The other server just walked away with attitude and mumbled something in Chinese back to the kitchen. I wasn't uncomfortable with that. 

Again, this is a Asian restaurant so I knew I had to expect sometime of stereotypical service, right? After we got our broth, my partner's heater didn't turn on and struggled to heat up for at least 15-20 minutes. No, I'm seriously not exaggerating. I felt so bad because he had to wait for his soup to boil. He couldn't use mines because he didn't like spicy. Poor guy. 

For our main dishes, we got the beef and lamb combo for each of us and a bowl of mushrooms to share. We sat across from the conveyer belt too and it was fun to pick and choose bowls to eat. This was awesome since I grabbed a lot of the seafood dishes from here, which were amazing by the way!

Overall, this place was an interesting experience to check out. Aside from the rude interaction with one of the servers, the rest of the staff was super accommodating and friendly. The place was relatively clean too. Unfortunately, I wouldn't really come back here since I felt like the place was a bit overpriced.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,4,1,3,Lg9-zps1y4NvK_9TwWdpbw

Found out the following from their website: ""As a reformer of the traditional Mongolian Cuisine, Chubby Cattle is the first restaurant in the world to combine a refrigerated, conveyor belt-based hotpot with the finest traditional hotpot from Asia.""  Now I knew what to expect after reading this.

The restaurant is located in a crowded strip mall.  Finding a parking spot during the peak time that we arrived was a challenge.  Once inside, we were seated right away.  We ended up ordering items from their menu.  Yeah, we did not try one item from their conveyor belt.  Got to say that it did look cool, though.  Everything was labeled nicely.  Depending on the color of the plate, prices ranged from $3.99 to $9.99

Tried two different broths.  The House Original and the Mushroom.  Personally, I preferred the Original.  The meats tasted so good cooked in that broth.  Also tried the Seafood Combo platter and Potato Noodles.  All good!

We had a private room, with 6 individual pots per table. We chose mushroom, original, seafood and tomato broth. For food, we ordered dumplings, seafood, beef, and vegetables. The center of the table houses a large steamer, which was stocked with raw rice. The steaming food cooked and infused flavor into the rice, giving it it a unique flavor and texture. The meats were presented on special trays. Veggies came on carved wooden bowls. Noodles were served uncooked, and were dipped into the broths. 

Tomato broth is the best. I didn't care for the seafood broth.

5996443,2017-05-18,1,beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw,"Had to try this place with friends from out of town since we've never tried anything that had a conveyer belt before. When you first walked in it smelled of soup and seafood. It was quite busy when we came, but there were empty tables so we were into our booth fairly quickly. Our server took quite awhile to come say hi and ask us for our drinks. I don't eat shabu shabu very often so I wanted him to explain what we were supposed to do. Instead, he just dismissed me and said go pick up your sauce and look at the menu and I'll come back. So the entire table went to get the sauces they wanted and came back. Then we ordered our soup base I guess that's what he called it. He suggested not to order the spicy if we couldn't handle it and so I just got one that wasn't spicy. 

 It took 4 times of asking to actually get our drinks and he never came back to ask us if we had any questions or if we were doing okay. That's one part of the reason they got a 2 Star rating from me. 

We had to figure out the whole conveyer belt thing on our own and asked several other workers what things were since our waiter was non existent. We managed to get through dinner without our waiter and the food was okay not the best shabu shabu I've had. 

When we were finally done our waiter showed up to give us the bill. We asked two split it between two people and evenly between two cards. Easy enough right? Boy was this wrong! We all were so confused and saw he charged my card twice for the same amount. We wanted to make sure he never charged our friends card before we left and let him know he made a mistake if indeed he didn't charge the card. 

So we waited for him and when he finally showed up he kept pestering me to take my card back so he could credit back what his mistake was and charge the other card instead. I at first kindly told him no that's fine. Then he kept insisting. That made me angry so I told him no again and said you might instead charge me a third time since you have already charged me twice and I don't want to deal with that hassle so let it be and just learn from your mistakes tonight. That's the second reason they got the two Star rating.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,5,1,2,IxPIvCqZPoHbAAUmaNj7oQ
