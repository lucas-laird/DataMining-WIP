I didn't catch her name but we went today 05/07/17 at 3:50 PM. She was shouting at the other crew and it wasn't even busy at the store. We ordered extra regular and extra large gravy and it wasn't even halfway full. We just didn't want to argue with the manager because it's just gravy, but hell we paid $4 for thet. Never coming back to this location.",II6yVjNJcT9rOuirzjVvYA,1,0,3,PFlQHNgrC6JdRg6bxPxzbg

3019541,2017-06-26,0,ZyTrka-HiVb6Ckcl0rDaNA,"Probably the worst place I have ever been to! If I could give 0 stars I would! The manager Monique (or so she says her name was that) and employee keondranique were so rude and unprofessional! They charged my card 3 times saying it was declining. I then payed cash and thought it was weird cause I know I have money in my account.. when I checked my bank account I saw 3 transacations from Popeyes! I told the manager to give me my cash back cause I was already charged and to refund me cause at this point I was tired of the BS they were telling me! She was like we charged you correctly!! I told her ""NO YOU DIDN'T YOU CHARGED ME 3 TIMES"" she's was so stupid and had a dumb look on her face cause she's the one who charged my card..she then proceeded to tell me that she was right when she wasn't..I left there so angry telling her that she was dumb and didn't know what the hell she was doing!! And she told me to F off!! And to go F my mother.. I called corporate to complain and they said a manger higher then her would call me back! Till this day I haven't received a call back or my money back for all the transactions!! I will never ever come back to eat at this restaurant!!( and to top it off when I left my order was incorrect and missing 3 items) they seriously need to reconsider who they hire for these positions! They have the meanest most rudest people working! I mean I guess I can't expect a whole lot with fast food right!",Q3PAIZDXs0prQmqduiE_8Q,1,0,1,NTBEv201fUPdnyQV596p2g

3140297,2018-02-21,2,ZyTrka-HiVb6Ckcl0rDaNA,"I am seriously on the hunt for the best Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in town and one that is consistently good! Is that too much to ask for because it's a fast food place? It's always a hit or miss situation with this place but I decided to try out this location one day on my way home. The popcorn shrimp item is one of my favorites and also too when usually I order the shrimp, they drop a fresh batch. On this visit though, they ended up giving me like half fresh and half ones that have been sitting around. I'm not a fool now, I know what the operation of this order was lol dump the fresh ones on top of the old one's... No sir! I kicked it right into reverse and handed it right back to them to fix my stuff properly. For these instances I always suggest to go inside and WATCH them in case somebody has some type of feelings and want to get to playing tricks with your food. This one was a miss.....",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,1,3,a3AfBKBL0T-ev2HtZQGHOA
3220611,2018-02-02,0,ZyTrka-HiVb6Ckcl0rDaNA,"Consistently worse every time ....hardest, old rubber chicken sitting under bright lights. Weird burnt, skin and hard cold biscuits. They just don't care or don't give a damn. 3pm today the beans & rice was also old and congealed and the rice wasn't cooked , hard rice.  But the employees are always nice & polite , good people but bad food....",WhBwqZeQ7Xte3Tof9DrdPg,0,0,2,Ddvrs5aqHYeVNllcXN9esQ
3583235,2018-02-04,0,ZyTrka-HiVb6Ckcl0rDaNA,Was greeted upon entering. I always order a 12-piece spicy family meal with red beans & rice and mashed potatos. Didn't have butter or hot sauce. The chicken was hot and juicy. The rice in my red beans was undercooked so luckily I was able to finish cooking it in hotel microwave. The staff was friendly. Plenty of parking in shared lot.,SN-g5PxSQJbvC4kEVKf18A,0,0,4,Fx5OrMHA_lYqFohYHAiI0A

But Today takes the cake, waiting 25 minutes and they bought my order out to another lady waiting who took it back in and bought out another order which was still not hers but mines and they were not even gracious enough to say do want a drink for waiting 25 minutes and we gave your food to someone else and that we still gave you the food that they went through. This is horrible and the last time I give my business.",t8WurfBWkAgBwfckrcGcjA,0,0,1,R4lAbta2tI6lbkfsjTx-Gw

What keeps me coming back, is the excellent service I always receive from Tim. He's always made sure my order was right, I had the condiments and utensils I needed to enjoy my meal & most importantly made sure I always left happy. 

Also, don't forget about their Tuesday deal 2 pieces for $1.69. Enjoy!!",7L8utEpYiVj3pNNjZkQaLQ,0,0,5,hBLg0UpaNPiXQmsO2Bjs0Q

5321436,2017-10-08,0,ZyTrka-HiVb6Ckcl0rDaNA,"Unfriendliest welcome from who seemed to be the Manager of this place who took my order. I walked in from an empty restaurant with no ""Hi, welcome to popeyes "" at least. To make it worst, the person (black lady wearing a different uniform and had a headphone) taking my order looked like she was gonna eat me while taking my order. Lol. I swear this girl needs to undergo customer service training extensively. After she handed to me my order, she turned her back and didnt say thank you at all. I guess some people are not grateful they have a job because she looks like she was not happy doing what she is doing.  Be thankful I was in a happy mood when I walked in otherwise your arrogant behavior will find its way being reported to your corporate management.",yvvQ4ky4L9wks33nSHRyQg,0,0,1,akTlYDBT15aeapFew87_jQ
