I did saw an ad they posted decades ago. Back then I didn't give them much thought since the strip already has so many great choice to offer. Forward ten yrs later! Since moving to LV recently n saw their ad in a local Filipino newspaper! I was kind of skeptical at first but did give them credit for still in operation after all these yrs! So I took a leap of faith I went on a Tuesday evening. The place was kind of rundown like most Asian establishment n the host or owner was kind of rude or frigid! He didn't show me to the dining table until I acknowledge for a one. The waiter was very nice n did fill my drink n clear my plates really quick. But his English was very minimum. 
            About the food! It is your average basic Asian flair! There r a few stand out items I did quite enjoy n so did other patrons. They r Korean Kalbi ribs, dried-fried salt n pepper chicken wings n the salt n pepper stir-fried shrimps. Some people did rave about their steam fish heads. But I m not the type of person that can eat somethin so exotic.
             Anyway! If u r on a budget n want to eat something different n r tire of the long lines n outrageous price the buffets on the strip r charging.
With an open mind n an adventure to traverse outside the glamour n glitz of the strip. U will be suprise LV has so much more to offer!",o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,1,3,du3i7bKoNT9vlLJ5vcsBKw

Horrible experience. I'm from out of town so I called to see closing time. Manager Erika said 9pm they close door but failed to mention they also stop serving at 9pm. Got there about 845pm and they were taking forever to bring food out. When they did it was loud and messy. My 5yr old niece slipped because floor was moped but no caution sign was up. Erika did not apologize to my niece. Her assistant manager laughed at me and then raised his hands up. I could've engaged physically w him but rather I wanted to speak to the owner. I asked what his name was ""BEN"". It seems Erika gave me BENS name as owner and cell phone so they're just giving me the run around.

The food is good and wide ranging  My favorite is the fried plantains and stuffed shrimp. The price is right, the service is good. I normally dont hit any particular buffet more than a few times because I have so many choices in the area as well as Las Vegas. 

Of course, this being a buffet, the food isnt going to be not great after being out in hot trays for awhile, but go before 7pm.

The weak spot in the food are the deserts - except for the fresh fruit, I would avoid it, including the frozen ...""ice cream"".

It could have been longer since they were empty when we got there.   Many of the dishes were very salty and tasted funny.

I know the price for lunch was only 5.99 plus drink and tip, but maybe they should charge more and provide better quality food and quicker food replacement.

I've had more than my share of cheap Asian buffets and Jumbo probably isn't my preferred choice. It's alright.. I've been here like only once, the folks though at least once a month for however many years we've known of this buffet, they enjoy this place a little too much.

So the dining area is spacious, it can hold a lot of people, I wouldn't be surprised if they bussed people from a tour into here. They have lots of items your usual beef broccoli, ham, salmon, sushi, fried chicken, and even dim sum. There really wasn't a lot of beef or pork dishes, at least when I was there. I kind of left protein deficient, like beef and pork deficient. I was starving but not really.  Don't know how to explain it but I'm sure others know what I mean. I liked the shrimps, the calamari, and the mushrooms. Didn't like the crab. A number of items I didn't try because of the way they looked.

The best things in this buffet are the ribs, chicken wings, and the egg drop soup. Their best is decent.

4014460,2011-12-22,6,-YWr1wm_NaAlgEf9TZzsMQ,"I have this weird obsession with trying every cheap Chinese buffet in town.  Really.  It's a bad habit to invade my body with all of this processed food and possible copious amounts of MSG.  But I keep going back for more!  Must be the hunger from my poor college days of finding the most amount of food to put down my gullet for the least amount of money.  Because who knows when my next big meal would be!  

I have been curiously been wanting to try this place for a while, after constantly passing by here on Decatur on my way to work everyday.  Finally, after trying almost every other cheap Chinese buffet in town I gave in.  And wow, what a surprise!

Now when I say surprise, I don't mean the food was beyond all comparison and it deserves multiple stars for being heavenly.  I was surprised because for it's very unassuming exterior and surrounding area (there's graffiti everywhere outside on walls and the next door building...a CLOSED restaurant) Jumbo Super Buffet was jumbo packed!  The place was full to the gills of people for lunch!

My guess is because they are running their special of all-day-dining for only $5.90 a person (M-F), drinks not included!  That is some super cheap eats!  I mean, even a combo at McDonald's runs more than that so of course you can see the appeal.  The BIG FAT banner they have going across their restaurant advertising the price probably brings in quite a bit of traffic as well.

Jumbo Super Buffet is not the prettiest of places I can tell you that much.  It reminds me of a car that's tattered a bit but still gets you where you need to go.  The decor is old, yes it is a bit dusty, the tables and chairs aren't new, and yes...the place isn't the cleanest by Martha Stewart standards.  And yet, this place is full of people.

On to the food.  If you don't have a particularty strong stomach and a non-sensitive sense of smell...THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU!  If you don't like the look of unfamiliar animal parts...THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU!  It is bordering on the super-ethnic!  The types of food offered by Jumbo Super Buffet surprised me the most.  It's like something you might see in an Andrew Zimmer 'Bizarre Foods' packed lunch.  Me, I don't mind these types of foods because I'm Filipino and was raised on 'weird' foods...dinuguan, bagoong, and tripe stew anyone?  But for you non-initiated types you might be taken aback a bit.

Jumbo Super Buffet of course has your typical 'Asian American' style foods to appeal to the masses:  fried rice, noodles, beef & broccoli, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken (that poor panda), fried shrimp, fried eggrolls, wonton soup, miso soup, and egg drop soup.  Then there's the food for the less Asian types:  fried chicken wings, french fries, greasy pizza and the like.  It's all there and it all tastes the same...salty but somehow satisfying.

But turn a corner and you're in some definite bizarre foods territory.  This is the first Chinese buffet I've been to here that serves:

-Chicken feet (not bad by the way)
-Pigs feet (ooh...so sticky sweet)
-Fried fish heads (meh...I've had better...head...nyuk nyuk)
-Whole steamed tilapia (not really that bizarre unless you eat fish in fillet form only)

It was crazy!  And I am glad that most folks were sopping it all up!  Talk about taking it back old school!  There were folks that had nothing but half a plate of chicken feet and hot rice on their plate...and were totally happy.  I don't eat too much of the random parts often these days but I appreciate the cultures they come from and agree that a lot of these not so common animal parts deserve some respect.  Wasting parts of an animal can't always be a good thing, right?  I enjoyed my servings of chicken feet and pigs feet with a small (squeal) of delight.  The fried fish head would have probably been better with a dipping sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, pepper, green onion, and cilantro.  

Fair warning, stay AWAY from the 'sushi' bar!  Did not look good at all!  You are better off eating some fish heads and feet, avoid that salmonella station at all costs!

Other than the extra salt content (lots of these Chinese buffets do), the only complaint I had about this buffet was there was no kim chee!  WTH?  I wanted my kim chee fried rice!  And you guys need to get rid of that big vat of tapioca pudding you put on the line...looks like a bunch of fish eyes staring at me and it freaks me out.  But on the plus side, you do have three different kinds of Jell-O!

Not the best buffet I've been to, but it exceeded my expectations by not being the worst either.  Take it for what it is folks, frugal eats for frugal wallets!  And my wallet is pretty empty after the fiasco that is Black Friday!!  Happy Holidays all!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,0,3,CgrIV4oLw7I5-mgKAVMQ1w

4347122,2015-05-18,1,-YWr1wm_NaAlgEf9TZzsMQ,"*** WARNING.  THIS IS A PARTIAL REVIEW.  READ AND FIND OUT WHY ***

So, after church a group of friends suggested going out for Chinese food, including dim sum, and one friend recommended Jumbo Super Buffet.  I love CHinese food, ESPECIALLY dim sum, so I thought it was a great idea.  Hardly.

When we arrived (a full hour before closing), the restaurant was half full of patrons.  There were three buffet islands of hot food and one cold island.  The buffet price is $9.89 on Sundays.  

Prior to being seated, I wanted to walk around the buffet and view the food offerings.  I wish I had my camera.  Again, with a HALF FULL restaurant, nearly every buffet hot tray was empty or contained food that appeared to have been the remains of what was set out hours ago.  My greatest fear with any buffet is that the food is old and is stirred over time after time to make it appear ""fresh"" again.  I understand that some food will sit longer than other selections, but I would say nearly 70% of all the food trays were empty (out of about perhaps 80 selections.  If not empty, then only old scraps remained.  I actually saw two trays with large fish heads in them, left there after customers had consumer the bodies of those fish.  It was disgusting.

Even simple dishes like rice and noodles were old, depleted and crusted on the sides of their respective trays.  And soups were down to about 25% full, with heavy crusts formed around the inside of the soup containers, with ""skin"" on top of the soup, created by being left there too long and not properly maintained.

Here is what drove me out of the restaurant:  the place was a health hazard!  The floors were replete with food scraps such as rice, noodles, soup drippings and other items that should be cleaned up immediately.  Only three feet from a food island was a five-gallon bucket, filled with dark water and floating food items; it was a veritable bucket of liquid swill that gave off an acrid odor.  What kind of business are these people running, anyway?

Any buffet restaurant that cannot 1) at least keep their food stocked to reasonable levels, 2) ATTEMPT to make their food items appear appetizing throughout their serving hours, and 3) maintain proper cleanliness, is destined to fail health inspections and quickly lose patrons.

When I told my friends I refused to eat there, one commented ""hey, it's just food...let's eat.""  Well, even dogs are fussy about their food.  I wasn't looking for a ""feeding,"" I was looking for a meal.

As for the quality of the food that remained, I cannot comment on it.  That's why this is a partial review.  But my friends reported back that they felt ripped off and sick to their stomachs.  We should have gone to Denny's following church after all.

There was a big selection of hot foods. I had some crab legs, stuffed crab, shrimp, chow mien, a rib, won tons, an egg roll, and fried rice. The cream cheese won tons were my favorite. The downside is the dessert selection was lacking. They had no Lotus Balls which is my favorite! I passed on dessert because I was too full to eat it plus I didn't see anything. The meal with drinks costs around $10.00 but during the weekdays it's only $5.00.

So one day my buddy and I were driving down the road and saw this place with it's ""5.55 ALL DAY"" sign, and we ducked in. It's the same thing we would have spent at Wendy's, we figured, so let's try it. 

Man, this place is dingy inside. But I usually don't care about that because I'm here to eat. Well, eat I did. And eat some more. The food was not amazing, but it wasn't super bad, either. I ate a ton of food for under $6, so I was happy. I can best compare the quality of the food to a Panda Express meal that's a day or two old. It's still pretty good, but it's not amazing.

The tofu is tasteless but at least they're giving people more options. 
They also have fish head (wtf) but its eatable and interesting..""don't see that at panda ex""

The bad news is, it's just not remarkable in any way.  Sure, the $5.55 price tag is pretty entertaining and economical, and even with a drink, you're getting out of this place for under $10.   But our meal offerings just weren't memorable.  It just didn't sit right with me, you know?  I felt compelled to be careful what I ordered, and my Jedi instincts served me well.  But it just wasn't ""Oh my God"" amazing, nor did it compel me to go for seconds, or thirds.  I took the ""Indiana Jones"" approach and ""chose wisely"" for food selections, so I was fine.

Service was decent.  Nothing out of the way in terms of what we got, but it was acceptable enough to serve its needs.  

The price is great, the service was okay, the food was ""meh"".  I almost tried one of their many fish heads out of pure principle, but I decided that I respected my bowels too much to be that foolish.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,0,2,2,ZFI3Neq8O6dru7kzWHpZxA

5571959,2013-10-20,10,-YWr1wm_NaAlgEf9TZzsMQ,"Stopped by with my boyfriend today after saying, ""It can't possibly be THAT bad.""  At least not worse than I remember.  Oh no dear reader, it was much worse.  I write this review while we both lay around the house in misery bemoaning the urge to throw it all up but courting an even greater urge not to have to taste any of it ever again.

The restaurant decor is punctuated by signs telling you not to take more than you can eat so they don't have to charge more.  ""They can raise the prices all they want,""  my boyfriend grunted as he pushed an unfinished plate away.  ""I am NEVER coming here again!  They can't make me!""

The buffet is full of whatever they can find that wont cost them too much.  Jello,  sushi made out of cream cheese, fried rice that's not actually fried - just mixed with yellow food coloring the best we can tell.  I ate a mislabeled shrimp wrapped in what I think was a chicken patty...only the shrimp hadn't been cleaned.  The chow main was made with spaghetti noodles.  The only items were eating were the egg rolls and banana halves rolled around in strawberry syrup, which I imagine came frozen.  Everything else is either stale, old, lukewarm, under-cooked, or questionably labeled.    A tray of shrimp in sauce were labeled ""Pigs Feet"" and left mostly untouched by the diners.  

The last straw came when I sampled an empty cream puff.  (Though my boyfriends managed to get filling in it.)

They didn't ask us if we enjoyed our meal when we paid.

I imagine they don't really care.

""Don't worry honey,""  my boyfriend said on the ride home.  ""If the spaghetti-mein was that slippery going down just think of how slippery it will be coming out.""

 I tried a variety of items, most were xlnt, some I didn't care for, for some reason most of the sea food was bland , however there are shining stars...the broccoli beef contained real beef, non of that mystery meat stuff, the short ribs were just xlnt, same for the wings, most of the chicken dishes were good too. there is also a selection of traditional items that I didn't venture into (fried telapia heads and such)
But its not all peaches and cream and I wouldn't expect it to be,  the fried rice was weird(how hard is it to make  decent fried rice? a monkey can do it), the aforementioned shrimp/sea food was bland, same for the hot and sour soup, thin and bland.

5918685,2011-04-09,0,-YWr1wm_NaAlgEf9TZzsMQ,"I used to drive past this restaurant practically every day when I first moved to LV, but never tried Jumbo Super Buffet.  Recently I saw their ad in the local Chinese newspaper advertising $5.55 all day buffet ($7.61 is what you will pay if you also order a drink + whatever you leave as tip), and was curious what kind of food they would be serving you for about what you would pay for a combo meal at McDonalds, Jack In the Box, etc.

Recently on a day that I was feeling particularly adventurous, fearless or extra foolish, I decided what the heck, let's give it a try.

The parking lot was fairly full when I drove up.  A positive sign that they are at least getting the customers from their niche market, which I would say are the senior citizens, families with a lot of kids, and pretty much lower income families and individuals, or those that are on a tight budget.

The restaurant iself is defintiely older looking.  They did not spend much to decorate the interior or the exterior of the restaurant, but they do have a small army of waiters/bussers that work there that is very good at cleaning up after the guests leave and picking up the used plates during the course of your meal.

About the food. The dim sum which I was hoping will be good is rather disappointing for me.  I didn't touch their sushi selection, as I am not sure how long things were left out.  They do have a lot of soups (hot & sour, egg drop, etc), although I didn't give any of them a try. And the more traditional Chinese selections (e.g., Beef and Broccoli) is decent for the price. The American entree items, like beef ribs tend to be way overcooked and greasy. The cut fruits is probbly the best part of their otherwise disappointing dessert selections (which I was expecting from having read the other Yelp reviews posted), but as far as the number of dessert slections it is a fair amount if you combine both the Chinese desserts with the American ones.

Overall, I felt that the food tends to be overcooked and on the salty side (salty = more thirsty customer = drink more sodas and therefor eat less food).  But it is hard to complain about the food considering how much you are paying.

I would not say that this is a crappy restaurant for the price, as you get pretty much what you pay for.  The food is not top quality by any means, but what attracts the patrons that frequent this restaurant is their low price.  Jumbo Super Buffet is never going to be voted The Best of Las vegas, but they serve a niche market for those with a tight budget.

Compared to other Chinese AYCE buffets I have tried in the LV area, this is not one of best ones, but the price you pay is the lowest too.  So if you want better food and willing to pay more, by all means check out the other AYCE Asian Buffets in the area, otherwise Jumbo Super Buffet is adequate as a restaurant for those looking to fill an empty tummy with the least amount of cash expenditures.
