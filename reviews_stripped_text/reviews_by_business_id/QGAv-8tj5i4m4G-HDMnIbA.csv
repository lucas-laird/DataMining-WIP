Harlon was our server, his knowledge of the menu is incredible!  He was polite, friendly and didn't rush us.  It's a smaller cafe, and when we were there it took us about 15 mins to get a booth ...

After eating at their Hollywood location for some time now, I decided to check out their vegas location during a trip. Its consistent, large portions, friendly service, and deliscious. My favorite part about the griddle is getting your very own french press with each visit. 

Their omelettes are great as always. French toast the size of your head, if you're super hungry. Theres almost always a wait time, but line goes fast. Its inside the SLS, free self parking.",ktZzjG2OAccIGLWr9kXGfQ,1,1,5,QYUb0FKJQrqRp4RotvStqg

238194,2014-12-16,0,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"Ok, I'll be honest: was the French Press coffee a bold, flavorful, amazing taste of torrefaction Heaven in a cup? Yes. Was it worth five bucks? Sure. I had the Tequila Sunrise plate. The flavors were all there. The chicken sausage was a nice bonus and had a pleasurable kick of spice in each bite. I had it with a side of avocado (a Huevos Rancheros must), so the total for the dish alone came to $16.50. Therein comes my gripe. This is breakfast, people. If I laid that amount of cash down at Hash House or Cracked Egg, I would have literally busted a gut. The presentation of the dish was underwhelming. The beans were literally a layer to separate the eggs from the tortilla. No rice. No pico. Not even a sprig of cilantro. I think the key missing element was a couple extra tortillas to sop up the alcohol-infused sauce. That may have even bumped my rating up another star. It just needed a lil ""somethin"", besides the price, to remind me that I was eating at a Strip establishment. Overall, the dining area was appealing and clean, a kind of diner-chic feel, with easy access from the parking garage. Nakisha was my server. She was prompt, friendly, smiley (but not over-smiley ;) ) and basically on-point. No complaints there.

That being said, you're not going to get a bigger pancake fix then this. It's better then a diner, but the food could add more finesse and probably subtract some size.

The red velvet pancake on the other hand was pretty good, I couldn't complain. But really, take a trip to Peppermill down the street.

Ordered the cheese omelete with potatoes and a bagel w cream cheese. We also got the breakfast taco w chicken and a side of the maple turkey links. 

Took a long time to get the food because they were really busy. 

The omelete looked like plastic hahah but it was great! So much cheese. I didnt like the potatoes but my friend did.

The breakfast tacos we ordered were good. Its corn tortillas so its a little more authentic but i dont really like that smokey taste. We ordered chicken in them but i think we said it wrong and it came on the side. Still good though!

(This could have been due to the fact that I have a food allergy and they had to make adjustments for that. Not sure though)

Greeters and servers were very friendly, server mentioned a few favorites on the menu, (which we did take his recommendation on the French toast and it was literally the best French toast we had ever tried) he also noticed by the way I was ordering that there might be an allergy and asked if he could write it down for the kitchen to double check. So sweet! People with allergies know that this is a huge plus to have accommodating service like this and puts a big relief on any stress of trying a new place out. 
my bf got the French toast, like previously stated but I have to emphasize, BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER again. 2 huge slices of thick bread, not soggy, not dry, juuuust right. They also have 100% pure maple syrup on the table! Very nice. And there was something about that French toast, like they sprinkled a little crack in it, but I'm also thinking maybe a little bit of good vanilla bean, that just took it to another level

I had the Cobb salad and the amount was like 2 salads. Chicken was fine, wasn't dry at all, but the bacon was the show stealer. I was not expecting that, at first glance it didn't look crispy enough to my liking but it was higher quality, thick and flavorful. I had enough for another entree sized salad to take home. And I liked that :)

This place would be great to go and share something with someone, but I don't care for all the wasted food I saw. The pancakes were huge and people were not putting a dent in them. And pancakes aren't really something to take home once they start to get soggy. So sharing is a great plan. Also, it's Vegas, so I get it. You should see these people light up when they see the huge pancakes come with whatever topping they ordered and that's what Vegas is about!

Griddle is known for their massive pancakes, and they do not disappoint. My personal favorite are the Oreo pancakes, and I have also tried the oat and wheat pancakes. I don't love french toast, but their chocolate chip cookie french toast is not bad. I would still opt for pancakes. Personally, I like to order the pancakes for myself, and take the leftovers home to eat for my next 3 meals. Then, I swear off pancakes for a while and repeat the cycle. 

Their fries are great: squishy with seasoned salt. You also get a ton of fries. Big shocker there. The sandwiches are also good. 

My only gripe is that I wish they had more kinds of waffles, but what can you expect from a pancake place?

Besides enormous quantities of food and the scratch and sniff post at the entrance, I don't see nothing here that would bring me back, the food was good but not much better than IHOP to justify fighting the crowds or the search for parking, service wasn't any great either, once they take your order and deliver your week's food supply they figure they're done with you, they assume that with all that food on your table you'll be busy for the rest of the day and trying to get your servers attention is as impossible as finishing all that food.

Although I did get a bit annoyed how they packed my taco and just threw all my tortilla chips inside I couldn't get to my taco, and it was a mess :( That's probably my only complaint but it definitely made me upset because I have to pick out all the chips to get to my taco.. I got the tequila Jo's shrimp tacos, was yummy. Although I suggest they should cut the shrimps in half or thirds! Because they were huge!!! All the salsa added on top of my floor tortilla made my taco soaking wet.... Maybe use two layers of tortilla or corn tortilla? It was such a mess and it made it difficult to eat. 

Overall my tacos and small salad was yummy!! I think the salad was better than the tacos.. 







EDIT: Next day ordered two sets of tacos. Specifically asked for chips to be separated.. Ended up with 1 order still with a bunch of salty ass chips on top. I had to pick around 2-3 hand full of the chips out into the trash. I was so fed up!! Ugh. Don't get their Moonwalker, or Steak one.

We shared: 

*""Sow Your Oats"" (Honey, Cinnamon, Rolled Oats): I like more textured pancakes (think Buckwheat Pancakes from Cafe Gratitude) and the oats create great textural delight. 

PROTIP: Apparently it's on a ""secret menu"" to order a single pancake instead of the 3 stack. It's about $8.95 instead of ~$12.95. So, getting 3 is more worth it but, not worth it for your macros or waist line! 

*""Poached y Papas"" Benedict (A thick slice of tender baked ham and two poached eggs served atop seasoned potato skins. Covered in Hollandaise): A serious chunk of ham that was, like the pancakes, bigger than my head. The potato skins were more like potato boats.  Greasy and delicious.

Service: Good. The waitress was very nice, but her efforts to sell us the most expensive options on the menu were not subtle at all.

Pricing: Overpriced, but what can you expect when you come to Las Vegas? Pancakes and waffles range from $9.95 to $13.95.

The café is located inside the SLS, so make sure to park in their parking structure. The pancakes are pretty good, but make sure you share with them with someone, as you typically get three pancakes (each larger than the plate they're served on). 

The coffee comes in a French press, which makes a very nice cup of coffee. However, be aware that they charge per physical cup that you order, even if you only have one French press. They didn't disclose this at any point until we got the bill, which was kind of shady.

Best advised to come with a group and split a few dishes- you must get the microbrew French press coffee as your beverage though, it's damn delicious and bottomless, for a low $5/person.

YELLOW BRICK ROAD PANCAKES ($14): butterscotch and caramel for flavor, and walnuts add just the right amount of crunch for texture.  Good option that is a little tamer than some of the others. Portion is massive, consider it a victory if you can finish even just ONE whole pancake (order of three). The vanilla whipped cream is amazing.

OMELETE ""MY SOUL"" ($15): stuffed with green chiles and jack cheese for spice, choice of protein (steak is best), and topped with sour cream, avocado, and pico. Good combination of flavors, odd fake egg texture to the dish that I just could not get over.

Service was friendly and the garage-style decor was cool, but dear lord, please redo your menu: it's a mess of italic and bold fonts and every punctuation mark known to man (ellipses, tildes, parentheses in every description, and exclamation points galore).

They are literally the size of a plate.

2266784,2014-09-01,0,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"Definitely an experience, the largest pancake I've had plus 2 more underneath.  I mean just giant!  I've had the ones at Hash House which are similar but these come in 3 and are heavier so pretty good price for what you get and while I thought they would be overly sweet they weren't except for the Nutella French Toast, too much Nutella in there.  

Our favorite from the few we tried was the Black Magic, Oreo filled pancakes which surprisingly weren't too sweet.  My two kids shared this and the rest if us had some too (party of 8) and only made it through the first pancake.

Wholy Moly was a plain one but tasty with the butter and brown sugar topping, I guess whole wheat can be pretty good :)

Also tried the banana butter finger one which was good, I'm just not a banana pancake person.

Service was good.  And the kids liked the scratch n sniff wall.  I liked the cute pancake signs.  

It's a lot of food so good they encourage sharing where I have heard other places charge for that but how could you not share, it's 3 super sized pancakes.  I was thinking there must be lots of food wasted with such big portions but I guess you can take it home for breakfast for the rest of the week if you can fit it into your to go box :)",Ew2y3jL11uooMQxSwwL6tw,1,0,3,MsPwQojUl7PibLcX5P6C3Q

This is The Griddle that I would wait in a line outside on Melrose Ave in LA for 3 hours just to eat the delicious breakfast. This is open 24 hours!  I have been 3 times to this location already.  The busiest I've seen it is 10am.  There was a 30min wait. We easily snagged seats at the bar and avoided waiting.  

My first visit I requested my FAVORITE breakfast item using the ""secret password"".  The servers had no idea and I was absolutely bummed.  The owner I believe her name is Judy was an ABSOLUTE DOLL. She was so kind and accommodated my special request.  Cooked it for me herself!  So long as I promised to try the Mama's French Toast.  I can't get into detail about this secret password item. Not sure if I'm allowed to. (If you find out... It's amazing!) I tried the mamas French toast and I love it. Ordered it 2 more times after I think I am hooked.  Bread so thick.  The flavor is just perfect, addicting, and different from any French toast I've had.  I only use butter no syrup the way Judy suggested. WOW!  

Side of bacon. 4 pieces very thick honey tasting yummy. Cooked even. Neither soft nor crunchy. 

Extensive menu so many things I would try.  Full bar!  Spiked shakes.  Everything!  Portions are huge. Appears entrees don't all come with sides. After ordering sides the tab really adds up. French toast, bacon, one egg, and milk $20. 

The servers are pretty nice.  I did try one of the cocktails consisting of Hennessy and frangelico. Took one sip hated it. The server asked me what I thought however after I voiced my opinion did not offer to change it.  I ordered it so I don't mind paying for it. Was just reluctant to buy anything more so I stuck with water.",jUZW1alRK8QvdZ-pH1OquQ,4,4,5,WtDODFoPetONykYnSX9Zfw

2303993,2014-10-09,5,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"Talk about Huge pancakes! I came to The Griddle Cafe as a post celebration lunch after finishing my first half Ironman with my teammates. Talk about Ironman feast of finishers. Between seven of us four ordering pancakes really no booth that can fit that much food. Same token nothing better then seeing the spread of culinary delights we had between all of our different orders. It was my first time here heard all about the breakfast food mainly the most talked about pancakes. Pancakes are some of the best post recovery food for triathlons all CARBS!!! Yay!! Not just the pancakes swear everything else that saw coming out and the rest of our order was super duper size or ridiculous size. 

I ended up going with pancakes. The ""Hear Me Roar"" not only for the name but reading the description frosted flakes (one of my favorite breakfast cereals all time) and strawberries. Breakfast times two all wrapped up in one pancake. The vanilla whipped cream on top was icing on pancake heaven. I love all the cool names they come up with for the different pancakes. If there a flavor looking for even if just straight red velvet or blueberry am sure they got you covered. One of many things love about this pancake is the frosted flakes just like come out of the box. They just pour it into the batter whole pieces not crushed up too dust. The whole fresh strawberries sliced up into the batter perfect balance cereal and fruit. Really what not too like about that combination?! The vanilla whipped cream kicks it up another level. I have always been big fan that best food in life. No need add more sauces, condiments, and the food should stand out by itself. It did!!! The portion size think is ridiculous but in good way. If you split regular order with someone perfect amount and super cheap under ten dollars each. If anyone that can eat WHOLE order that person should sign up for man vs food. You can order just one pancake instead of the full order. Even then one pancake is lot of food. I believe not really stated on the menu anywhere or the fact menu is pretty large could have got lost in translation. 

I also wanted to try another dish since it was my first time. I ordered the fresh tortilla chips with fresh made guacamole. You could order two different portions one for two or three. I ordered the two portions family style for the table. It was perfect amount cause filling up on appetizers at The Griddle Cafe not good idea if plan on ordered entree. The tortilla chips were awesome. Fresh! Hot! Crispy! The fresh guacamole was off the charts on it. Not many places in general do it. Nothing better with nice chunks of avocado, tomato, some jalapeño, onion, and acid lemon juice.REFRESHING. The avocado beat down smooth rather then chunky two different worlds. I would highly recommend this as your starter.

The menu is pretty big. So am sure they will have something you like. Not just Breakfast items also serve Lunch saw some awesome looking sandwiches. The interior design really enjoy. It feels like old school diner little bit but definitely modern twist. The entire staff from the hostess to wait staff. Awesome! Friendly, attentive, and made my first one great one.

---- Update on what we are now calling ""The Griddle Incident"" ----

After this example of the 'inhospitable approach to the hospitality industry,' I was quickly contacted by two managers who saw this review.  I can only imagine how much they have on their hands with the opening of restaurants in the newest casino on the Vegas strip let alone having to deal with deceitful employees.  But, they took the time to reach out to me and apologize for their employee's behavior.  Our conversation lead them to do more research into what happened and they reviewed the video tapes of their hostesses.  It turned out two girls were trying this same approach with everyone.  They were quickly let go... and rightfully so.

In what I am interpreting as a further example of this employee's ethics, an anonymous Yelp account was created to send me what may have been a heavily substance induced message.  At first, the random 'Yelper' claimed to be another customer of the venue, then changed to telling me I 'misheard' the situation that my husband and I both witnessed (I guess we both need our ears checked), then they proceeded to shame me for 'getting two people fired.' (That's weird, how would some random customer know this much about the inner workings of the Griddle?)

To this situation, and people who cannot take any personal responsibility for their actions in general, I have this to say... because it apparently needs to be said for a large portion of our population:

If you cheat on your boyfriend... it's not the fault of the person who exposed you leading him to break up with you. 

If you make a habit of running around kicking small children, it's not the kids fault when you're hauled off to jail because he told someone what you were doing.

AND FINALLY... If you are screwing over customers and the company you work for, it is not the fault of a Yelp reviewer when you get fired.

In the end, the managers invited us to a great night/day at the SLS to try the Griddle again, and it was a great experience! The food was outstanding with portions large enough to feed a small community.  Seriously, I don't think we will need to eat for a few weeks as a result.  My husband got the ridiculously good, vanilla hinted, French toast which quickly put my 2013 soggy French toast breakfast in bed attempt to shame.  That stuff alone will probably result in consistent early morning cravings. 

We recommend the Griddle as a great spot for middle of the night grub (open at 11pm-4pm) and breakfast!  On this visit, we decided it was only appropriate to give our waitress an elaborate tip because of her GOOD SERVICE AND ETHICS, not for manipulating the customer!

First off, decor is a mix between Modern and 50s Diner. They play chill rock music, its a good vibe. 

I was alone so I sat at the bar, at 5 am there was no wait at all so I could have sat wherever I wanted. The men working the bar were very nice and gave great service. There were two bar tenders, Nick and another gentleman (Sorry I can't remember), both were awesome, and made my experience great. 

The food was really good, I got the original french toast. The portions are huge and the food is rich, its definitely a cheat meal haha! Also got 4 strips of bacon (for 6$, a little pricey but....whatever, they have to make their money somehow right??) and the french press coffee. I got the mild brew coffee and it was really good, I like my coffee so I know a good cup when I have one. It was the perfect temperature, meaning I wasn't at risk of third degree burns. 

I only have one complaint, and it the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. My coffee mug still had some fine coffee soot residue on it, and my spoon was dirty. I didn't make a big deal of it because I've worked in the service industry and lets face it, industrial dish washers don't always work very well lol.

My only complaint is the size of the portions. They are simply too big. Some might love that but I just hate to waste food and I honestly could not eat more than a fifth of that pancake. Can you imagine throwing out 80% of your meal? That's how huge those pancakes are. I never understand why these restaurants don't offer a miniature pancake option for people like me who don't love the novelty. I much more enjoy a meal where I eat what's on my plate than throwing most of it out. Just seems like first world gluttony to me. 

I would literally pay the same amount for a fraction of the pancakes. I was fine with the price, not the portion. Anyway if you are a pancake person, you will love this restaurant.

The trick is to serve huge portions so people either share (those who know enough) or take doggie bags home. That way, they won't complain about the prices.   I ordered Deli and Eggs because I wasn't about to pay $14.95 for pancakes!  My plate consisted of lox, 2 eggs, slices of tomatoes and onions, capers, and a sliced, toasted bagel.  It was pretty standard, no big deal, overpriced.  No butter served with this meal, you have to ask for it!  My girl friend ordered the Eggs Benedict which really looked gross.  It wasn't traditional, it was served in one big glob.  The bacon was fatty, and yuk!!!  This place was way too noisy, we had to text each other to talk, the music was at nightclub volume (there should be a dance floor for people to dance while waiting because the service was slow....!)

Best idea. When we got here there was a short line forming at the door. We waited about 5-8 minutes in line until we were seated, not bad. Inside was packed! We came in just in time because shortly after the line started to form rapidly. 

Looking around I saw people ordering pancakes (which they are famous for), but they were HUGE! So me and Nieves D. decided to share 1 red velvet pancake.. Yes just one and it was more than enough! With the exception of the red velvet pancake, the pancakes usually come in 3. But trust me when I say.. 1 is good enough! these pancakes are ginormous! and extremely delicious! You can NOT come here and not order a pancake.

I ordered a chicken omelet and a vanilla latte and Nieves D. ordered The Chicago scrambled. And boy were they big portions. After we got our food we noticed that we probably could have just shared! 

The food was really good though. Most of our food went in a ""to go"" box but was demolished later on. This place is on my high recommendation list for breakfast places to go to and I probably will be returning to SLS just got breakfast!

I really liked the rustic industrial style decor, atmosphere was so chill, casual and relaxing, it's perfect for a comfort meal after too much drinking! 

The menu was huge, I never knew breakfast items could be so extensive! Eggs, pancakes, omelettes... ALL the breakfast items, you name it! Our sever gave us some time to decide, I ordered a very tasty Bloody Mary to sip on while studying the menu.

I decided to have beer battered fish tacos with side of egg whites, hubby had steak omelette with side of bacon. One of my beer battered fish tacos was unevenly battered and a little burnt, but the other one was very delicious, I just loved the salsa in it, so spicy and yummy! Hubby's omelette was huge, lots of stuffings, I liked the hash brown potatoes, and the same salsa on top of it. 

There was so much food, impossible to finish it all, very comforting and satisfying, great late night or early morning food! I loved it there are so many hot sauces and peppers on the table, we need hot sauces on everything at drunk meals!

Our table ordered two different burgers (one turkey, one beef), French toast, and eggs with potatoes. Food here is pretty big. Not Hash House big, but still massive. French toast was two slices bigger than my friend's face, and burgers came with a pound or two of potato wedges. The Mama Mia burger was tasty with a garlic sauce, mozzarella, and a roasted bell pepper with great flavor! The turkey burger was hailed as ""real good"" as well. My recommendation is to finish the burger first with just a few fries here and there so you don't get full trying to conquer the tower of pre-frozen potato wedges. That or bring really big (or really drunk) friends. 

Service was not particularly outstanding, but I feel like it's one of those hit or miss situations. The server that took the order and brought the drinks wasn't actually assigned that table, and the actual server didn't ever stop by. So we never got refills or checked on once the food came out.

Prices are $13 on average for entrees. A solid drunken meal, hands down. Sober it's good too, though probably not a first on the list with a limited amount of time in Vegas. If you're with a family, maybe split an entree between every two people, and your breakfast tab should still come out affordable with full bellies.",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,1,1,4,dBYg3fEU6tvcFTXExiKCFw

Bigger is better when it comes to certain things, but that does not apply to everything. 

First visit we ordered the pancakes with champagne, chocolate and strawberries. It was way too sweet for my taste and does not need syrup. We also ordered eggs with ham steak, potato and toast; it was good and made even better with a dash of cholula.

Second visit we ordered blueberry pancakes with a sour cream topping (sounds strange but was actually pretty good). We again, also ordered eggs and ham steak.

Two of us dining and we both ordered entrees to share. Way too much food for just two people. Both items ordered could have easily fed four adults. It would have been nice if the wait staff warned up about portion size.

But for me, the Griddle Cafe is so over the top that I don't have any real urge to return. 

I ordered the Peanut Bubba French Toast, figuring how large could it be? Well, this is Texas Toast on steroids, maybe 10 inches across. Take 2 slices of that, roll it in crushed Nutter Budders, and cover with powdered sugar. Top with whipped cream. I could only eat a small portion of this (and couldn't even think of having lunch). To top it off, it came out fairly cold.

My wife's pancakes were about the size of what Hash House would serve, except where Hash House serves one this came out in a stack of 3. Hers must have been sitting on the line for awhile as they weren't very warm either.

I suppose that if we came with a group of 6 and split an entree this could be a fun time. But for the two of us it was a little (okay, very) excessive, quite expensive, and frankly at the price they're asking it should come hot off the griddle.

3167876,2014-08-24,9,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"It's no joke when I say that I have literally been waiting years for this place to open! After having been to LA location a handful of times and completely falling in love with the food, there was no question that I was going to be here opening weekend! I mean, I was just there this morning, and I already want to go back...

To start off, this location is much bigger than the original one on Sunset. There's seating for nearly triple what the original location accommodates and it's much more open too. If you have ever been to the one in LA, you know how small it is and how tight everything is. And while I'm sure there will be plenty of days with long waits here at the SLS, the breakfast Gods have spoken and given us a location that's open 24 hours...yes 24 HOURS! Ahhhhhhhhh!

Moving on to the menu, I'm glad to see that things really haven't changed. There have been some slight changes, but I think that's more just to fit in to the theme of being in a casino. There's still a riduclous amount of the things to choose from, including their famous giant pancakes and a bunch of savory items for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even a late night snack. Most importantly though, you won't be paying more to eat the same food just because you're in a Las Vegas casino. 

Now, as I said...The Griddle Café is pretty famous for their giantly portioned pancakes. Normally stacked 3 high, and so large that the plate they are served on, can't even be seen underneath 'em. In all honesty, the portions are absolutely ridiculous and I don't think I know anyone personally who can finish the whole plate of 3. Thankfully, I just learned that any pancakes can be ordered in a single portion. Really, all that means for me is that I can order more than just one flavor every time I come here! ;) So, here's what we had today...

Eyes Wide Open - My favorite of the day. This one takes their pancake batter up a notch by adding in a shot of espresso and semi-sweet chocolate chips. The amount of espresso was perfect and just like the pancake themselves, they weren't stingy with the chocolate chips. Even after being stuffed to the rafters, I just couldn't stop eating this one.

Mouthful of Yum - This one is just bursting with flavor, and texture too. There's Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, brown sugar and banana in the batter, then it's topped with their fresh whipped cream and sprinkles of crushed Butterfinger. It's definitely a sweeter option on the menu, but it's good one.

Barry Yellow - Fruity, tart, fresh and delicious. This ones got raspberry and lemon mixed into the batter. Both flavors were present without hiding the other, and a great option for berry lovers who don't want something too sweet.

Tis' The Season - Even though this was my least favorite of the day, that means nothing bad whatsoever. These are easily some of the best pumpkin pancakes you're going to find in town. The pumpkin flavor isn't overpowering and they aren't mushy like a lot of them tend to be. Solid choice for anyone who likes pumpkin.

Between the visits to LA and these at the SLS location, I've probably tried close to 10 of their pancake choices. These are by far my favorite pancakes from any restaurant! They're always the perfect light, fluffy texture and I never even have to think about putting syrup on my plate. The pancakes really are just that good!

Adding to the pancakes, this was the first time I've tried like a ""regular"" breakfast item from The Griddle Café. I got to taste the Sunset People which was ordered by someone at our table, and it just made me love the place even more! Basically an egg scramble with sausage, bacon, jalapeno, potato, onion and cheese throw in. Tons of flavor, not too spicy, everything was cooked perfectly and it's served with a side of amazing chile-cheese toast. It ain't just about pancakes anymore for me!

Lastly, the service. I was really bummed to hear that some fellow Yelpers had terrible service the morning before. That's always a bad thing to hear and it' sucks that they had to deal with so many issues. Since our service was completely the opposite, I hope that was just some sort of opening weekend fluke. Our waitress was great, our drinks were never empty and anytime we asked for something (plates, napkins, etc), we had it in seconds. If anything, it was better then the LA location since I didn't get the rushed feeling like I have gotten there before.

The Griddle Café really does bring a new, and unique breakfast to Las Vegas that is more than worth checking out. Even if you aren't in the area, braving strip traffic and the drive from any part of town is a small price to pay for an amazing breakfast...if you ask me. I absolutely love the place and will be a very frequent regular!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,16,14,5,cWGKnNXF1-tMzjogYt9NSg
3249607,2014-10-22,0,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"I'm on the fence about The Griddle. It's the only brunch place at SLS (besides the buffet maybe). The line is long, but it moves quite fast. The service is fairly friendly (if a bit forgetful, she forgot a few drinks, but was nice about it when we nudged her). The vibe is cool, it's sort of like a traditional diner. 

Onto the food. The Eggs Benedict are plain WRONG - on potato skins, instead of muffins? It's criminal. My friend ordered them regardless (her love of eggs benedict reigned supreme), and as expected, it was disappointing. I had the cookie french toast, which was tasty but so huge it was almost obscene. Like, that could feed 4 people. I felt super wasteful leaving most of it. 

Overall we still had a good experience. However, I think this place needs to iron out a few creases to compete with other Vegas staples like Serendipity over at Caesars. Cut the portion sizes down, tidy up the scrappy looking menu, stick to originals that people like (instead of freewheeling with quite frankly bad combinations), sort out the music and offer more non alcoholic drinks.",1kYDWInS_Yraeb3Ui1OetQ,0,0,3,9wq0WO5265eBeWIUNV-Tcw

First thing I noticed when we sat down was HOW LOUD IT WAS. The walls and floors are concrete and brick, so acoustically, the music echoed everywhere and we had to talk at a much more elevated level than normal... Every time the kitchen filled the utensils it added to the noise with so much banging. I can't imagine eating there while hungover, it would be like hell. 

Our waitress was super slow and didn't do any of the basic things you'd expect from a breakfast place- she never brought us cream for our coffee, when we finally asked it took over 10 minutes. When my friend asked to have the whipped cream for her pancakes on the side, we practically had to spell it out, like she had never had anyone ask this before. She failed to bring any butter to the table after the pancakes were served, it was an hour after we ordered that we were able to finally flag someone down for it. She didn't even bother to mention that the syrup was already on the table, tucked away in the corner next to the wall and looked at us crazy when we asked for some even though we told her at the beginning that it was our first time there.  At the end of our 2 HOUR breakfast (seriously....) I asked for 2 to-go containers, of course she brought only one. My friend asked for a separate container to put some whipped cream in, again, blank stare. I finally got pissed and said, ""can you just bring a separate container for the whipped cream?!?"" What did she bring us? A container full of brand new whipped cream! (We just wanted the stupid styrofoam bowl!)

We arrived around 11:30pm on a Saturday night during a holiday weekend and there were only a few tables with guests. We were seated immediately and began the task of picking what we wanted from the menu. There were choices from pancakes,French toast, eggs, burgers and more. We chose the bananana pancakes and the adddicted to noisella French toast.

The Banananana- three oversized pancakes that have brown sugar based bananas cooked inside the batter, served with a dallup of butter and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  The came out still hot and tasted like warm banana bread. We didn't even use the syrup that was on the table, no need.

Addicted to noisella - two  pices of their ""moms French toast"" with that beautiful chocolate hazelnut spread in between topped wth a  large dose of whipped cream. The whipped cream started melting from the warm French toast and and served as a sauce. The Nutella stated perfectly warm throughout the meal and every bite was quite satisfying.

Service was on point. Our drinks were always kept fresh and extra napkins came to our table just in time without having to ask, yes we were messy.

The service was a total disappointment. They've been open for two months so you would think that they would have it together. 

The way they seated tables was completely inefficient. When we first got in line to be seated (party of 6), we were in a long line...there were easily 15 people ahead of us. They all got seated pretty quickly as they were parties of 2 or 4. As we moved along, a long line formed behind us. They don't have enough tables to accommodate larger parties so we waited and waited. ""We're just getting your table ready."" 20 minutes later...still nothing. At one point we looked behind us and saw that EVERYONE behind us in line, another line of 15 people or so, had been seated! 

When we got seated, the waiter couldn't be more short and rude with us.

That's why I totally was intimidated by the menu and missed so many things that I would have possibly ordered.

For example, I never even noticed the french toast options. Like I said, it was a long night and a very good concert.

My boring order consisted of eggs, bacon, toast and fruit. It was cooked to order, served quickly, hot and I enjoyed every bite of it.

I did see and consider one of their sandwiches, but the circumstances just seemed to favor a more traditional breakfast plate of food.

Anyway, the point is I had a delicious (and somewhat necessary) meal and received really good service at a fun place that is open early and late on weekends.

As someone who spent a lot of time in SLS this past weekend, I laugh at how Griddle Cafe is CLOSED in the evening. Clearly, SLS wants to steer people to enjoy the other restaurants for dinner items, while Griddle clearly gets the morning, lunch and late night business.

So, I missed the french toast. And the pancakes. And some very creative options that others here on Yelp can tell you more about. All I know is I like this place and I'll probably return on my next visit with more of a gameplan and a little less alcohol in my system.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,1,1,4,wYz-sV1Kt-irfer-HvN8Hg

The Griddle Cafe is known as the ""Disneyland of breakfast,"" for offering great pancakes and scrambles. I've been to the original one on Sunset in LA and they were spot on with the decor and ambiance. The place was packed on a Saturday morning, but the line moved quickly and we were seated within 10 minutes (as opposed to over an hour with Hash House). 

Their menu is pretty vast, but you only need to pay to their oversized pancakes and egg specialties. For sweets, we opted for the ""Banananana"" pancake and the ""Mom's French Toast."" Between four people, we could barely make a dent in the pancake. The thing I like about the pancakes and French toast is that they're good as is - the addition of any maple syrup actually makes it worse (way too sweet). For our savory options, we tried the ""Poached y Papas"" Benedict and the ""Some like it HOT"" Scramble. It's definitely the most creative Benedict I've tried; I loved the potato skin in place of the English muffin. The spicy scramble was as advertised especially if you like your eggs with an actual hot sauce. 

As a coffee fanatic, I could appreciate that their coffee is served French-press with complimentary refills. The medium roast tasted pretty dark to me, which I didn't mind, but beware.

3972387,2014-08-24,6,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"I had eaten once at the Griddle Cafe on Sunset Boulevard in LA so I was really looking forward to having one in my home town.  Yesterday was opening day for the general public at the Griddle Cafe in its new home in the SLS Hotel and Casino.

Three of us met here so we could enjoy a number of different items.  We ordered two pancake selections and two French toast selections and specified the order in which we wanted to get the selections with a time out period between the two waves.  We also ordered coffee.  All their coffee is served French press style and you can choose the boldness of the coffee.

As for the food, we got two pancakes of Mouthful of You, three of Sow Your Oats, 2 slices of Devil's Daydream French toast, and two slices of Peanut Bubba French toast.    Flavors were excellent for all these breakfast items.  The Mouthful of Yum were brown sugar pancakes with banana and crushed Butterfingers with Godiva Chocolate Liqueur.  This was topped with a dollop of whipped cream which was also flavored with Godiva chocolate liqueur.  It was yum!  Rounding out the first course was the Peanut Bubba crunchy French toast.   Bread dipped in peanut butter crunch and topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar!  Truly a delight!  

Course two soon started with the Sow Your Oats pancakes--we got three although we ordered a short stack.  Along with this we got the Devil's Daydream Bourbon French Toast.  The cakes were made with cinnamon, honey and rolled oats.  They were good but I found the cakes to be a bit dry.  I put some maple syrup on my slices, something I rarely do.  The Devil's Daydream French toast was made from chocolate bread that had been loaded with bittersweet chocolate chips.  The cooked bourbon was very evident in the flavor of the French toast.  Of the two, my winner was the French toast again.

Understand when you go here, the pancakes are huge.  They are the size of a regular plate.  Leftovers are packed for customers in small pizza like boxes so make sure you order wisely.  Having three of us share helped destroy our tasty selections except for a small bit leftover.

Now, the service, and the reason for only 3 stars.  The food is hands down 5 stars.  The service was awful.  Our initial server seemed oblivious to the fact we were there and lacked common sense.  He brought coffee for the 3rd person who came a bit late, but we had to almost trip him to get a cup so our friend could enjoy his coffee.  At the same time, he dropped off a glass of ice cubes and left without saying a word.  I watched him and eventually he picked up a pitcher of water and came over.

About this time, we requested to see the manager and she was little help except for giving us excuses.  Opening day, worked graveyard shift, one of our best servers.  Really, you know this after one graveyard shift.  We were assigned a new server who was top notch.  All the while we waited trying to get service from the original server, we watched a comedy show, in a way, near the entrance.  See my photo here:

Long Review:  
I've been the to the LA location and was impressed with their pancakes, their French toast, and their service. What I disliked about the LA location is the wait.  Yup, I'm one of those fools that waited over an hour for breakfast at their LA location. I didn't regret my meal, but wasn't heading back anytime soon due to the wait.  Now, they're here in Las Vegas inside the SLS and the wait isn't as bad.  You know what that means?  That means, a monster breakfast for Mel C and his fork.  

So, what's good?  Well, here are my thoughts. 

-Peanut Bubba French Toast: If you're a peanut butter lover, then you'll love this.  French toast that's dipped in peanut butter?  Enough said.  Texture is crunchy on the outside and peanut buttery on the inside.  I love that peanut butter after taste.  NOTE:  I had this at their LA location.  This is on the LV menu as well. 

-Sow Your Oats:  Cinnamon, Honey, and Rolled Oats??? Imagine your typical bowl of oatmeal with cinnamon.  Well, that's what you get with their ""Sow Your Oats"" stack. Texture is different, but is one of their popular stacks. NOTE:  I had this at their LA location.  This is on the LV menu as well.

-The Golden Ticket:  This is for you banana lovers out there.  I don't eat much fruit due to allergies, but willing to take the risk after sampling this bad boy.  Banana, caramel and walnuts are all combined to create this masterpiece.  

-Pure Imagination:  This is basically their ""Build-Your-Own"" burger or sandwich.  Yes, I got this.  I love pancakes, but was craving a sandwich or burger on my last visit here.  I had them create a chicken sandwich with mushrooms, jack cheese, and green chili.  This was sloppy, but good.  The huge plus with the side of steak fries.  

-Chicken Breast and Egg Whites:  Yup...I got boring on one of my visits.  Actually, I supplemented the chicken breast and egg whites to one of my meals.  Taste wise...it's just grilled chicken breast and eggs whites.  Nothing special. NOTE:  I had this at their LA location.  This is on the LV menu as well. 

-Tortilla Chips:  Why do I even mention this?  Because it was good and addicting. Fresh, crispy, and airy is how I would describe them.  

Overall, there isn't one thing that I've had here that was disappointing.  Also, don't let the price of their meals fool you.  Their low price on most meals is backed up by monster servings.  One whole order of their pancakes easily serves 4 people or two Mel C's.  

I would probably give the LA location 4 stars, a one star drop due to the wait.  But at this location, the wait wasn't bad and they're local for me.  So, 5 stars it is.  Yeah Buddy!


TIP:  If you don't have a huge appetite, then order just one stack.  A whole order of their stacks equals food coma.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,8,5,KwlAKyTJZvnoGpAoHSO6jw

Now that that's out of the way, this is a place that you should definitely check out if you're remotely tolerant of starchy breakfast items. It's one of the slew of restaurants in the brand-new, relatively navigable SLS. Just FYI, self-parking (accessible on Paradise Rd. just south of Sahara) was fine although it could certainly get worse.

Unfortunately, the meal did not start off on a positive note. A server did not come to greet me until 10 minutes after I joined my friends at their table, and it took at least 15 minutes for me just to get some water and a coffee mug. Heck, even that somehow devolved into a three-trip process (coffee press and glass of ice, then water pitcher, then coffee cup). My tablemates were apparently there for even longer without being able to order. It's even sadder when you consider the pack of employees seemingly always huddled around the cashier station (check out Norm's photo when he posts it). Thankfully, Michael complained and got the manager to switch servers, and service was fine afterward.

I'm not a coffee person, but I'm sure enthusiasts will enjoy the French press coffee with complimentary refills, and tired people (yours truly) will enjoy the caffeine. I did also have a taste of a ""boozy shake"" that I'm reasonably sure was the Saturday Morning Fever (how appropriate), with vanilla bean ice cream, griddled buttermilk cake, Bailey's, Kahlua, and sweet cream. It was sweet and creamy with just a hint of alcohol, although I'm not sure I'd pony up $15 for it for anything other than a special occasion.

Food-wise, I was able to sample four items with benevolent benefactor Michael U. and the wonderful Norm K. this morning. First round included the ""Peanut Bubba"" French toast. It's based on a traditional French toast but is coated in an excellent peanut butter crunch that gives it an otherworldly flavor. With the powered sugar and vanilla whipped cream on top, I didn't even need maple syrup for this one. By far my favorite of the meal.

Next up was the ""Mouthful of Yum"" brown-sugar banana pancakes with crushed Butterfinger and Godiva Chocolate Liqueur (and a whipped cream made of said liqueur). Loved the moistness, the crunch, and the moderately sweet flavor. I can see this being a repeat order as well.

Second round included the ""Devil's Daydream"" French toast, which is basically dark and bittersweet chocolate plus bourbon. It didn't quite mesh with my palate even after the addition of maple syrup, so I didn't go back for seconds. I can see how it would appeal to some though. We also had the ""Sow Your Oats"" pancakes with honey, cinnamon, and rolled oats. It was a little dry, so I found myself going back to the other pancakes, but it's still flavorful and can pass muster with maple syrup added.

We all left quite satiated. Actually, we probably would have finished the whole breakfast if they hadn't upsized the second pancake order to three oversized monstrosities (instead of just two oversized monstrosities). I wouldn't recommend ordering more than one item per person unless you're willing to take leftovers to-go (in a pizza box, no less, due to insane pancake proportions).

The food that we had is definitely great. While I didn't personally enjoy all of the items as much as I would have wanted, I recognize that there's quality in the recipes and in the kitchen's execution. I know that their menu has more savory breakfast and non-breakfast items (eggs, burgers, sandwiches, etc.), but considering that I got to try a few of what seem to be their specialties, I'm giving a generous four stars under the very important assumption that the service improves in the future and that the food remains the same or also improves.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,5,4,LgB-JbjyfKJfNjEo5CAmUw

Since we were staying at the hilton grand vacations, the SLS was a short 5 min walk away. Once we got there, we were seated right away.

It was really hard to choose what we wanted, especially since they must've had at least 30 types of pancakes on the menu. My friend ordered the honey oat cinnamon pancake which she appropriately stated could feed a small village. The order came with 3 ridiculously large pancakes (12.95). We barely got through a fifth of it together.
The pancakes were a little too doughy for my taste though and a little dry. However, I really enjoyed the Vermont maple syrup that came with it.

I ordered the shrimp egg white scramble with capers and several large pieces of shrimp. It was very flavorful and again was probably 2-3 times the normal portion that restaurants serve. It definitely left me feeling super full and it came with a side of fruit for no additional charge (14.95).

The food was just fantastic and worth the wait.  The pancake portions are HUGE- all of the pancakes come three to an order, and each one is the size of a steering wheel.  Four of us could not finish the sow your oats pancake.  Also, their non-breakfast items are just as good as the breakfast items. These are tried and true items that you can't go wrong with:

- Sow Your Oats Pancakes
-Noisella French Toast (it's nutella battered french toast stuffed with nutella). 
- BBQ Chicken Tacos (they're called the ""sunset hipster tacos"" on the menu, which makes no sense, but they come with homemade tortilla chips that are fresh out of the fryer.  I liked the chips more than I liked the pancakes even)
- Tequila Sunrise
-Scotch on the rocks (butterscotch pancakes)
- Wine and Cheese on Sunset Salad (huge chunks of blue cheese and avocado)

Warning***Huge portions, so order to share is highly recommended!!

We ordered: ""Some like it to Scramble"".  The first time we ordered it, we requested tortilla chips with it. The food was perfectly seasoned, and prepared to perfection. We also shared the Good Ol' Fashioned french toast. One person alone eating this can hurt themselves, two or more people works great to share this dish.

Ok, we loved this place so much, we went back the next day to share again; ""Some like it hot"", this time with chili-cheese bread. Same reaction, perfect!! We did without the french toast this time. 

Drink wise, the french press coffee is delicious. They serve it in this coffee kettle of some sort! Keeps it hot, and the host/hostess, are always refilling. Service both times were excellent! They were very accommodating. The bartender made me a mimosa, and you really can't go wrong with that, but he was also making other good looking drinks. 

I did not know what to expect, as I did not look on yelp to review first, we stayed at the hotel, so figured why not, and it was great! When I opened yelp to write my review, I was surprised to see the low ratings on some. At any rate, we had a positive review for the SLS location in Vegas.

We didn't think we would have to wait because we thought  who is really up at this time on a Sunday in ...Vegas? People who didn't go to sleep yet ... that's who. There were plenty of people up in the clothes they wore to the nightclub the night before.  

The hostess was nice enough to tell us even though we see seats available  they are short on staff so that is why they couldn't seat us right away. I liked the honesty and I was happy to wait until... some guy who pops out of the back shows a group of ladies to a seat ignoring me and the other guy who have been waiting. I was thinking ""Hell No"" while the guy next to me actually said ""Oh Hell no""! Luckily the waitresses wanted to avoid a scene so they sat us down almost immediately. 

While I was looking over the menu I couldn't help but notice this girl swigging champagne out of a bottle with her breakfast. It made me think of lyrics to a Katie Perry song ""This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last night's dress...Uh-huh, I see you. Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money!""  I then snapped out of my thoughts and started looking at the menu. There were so many choices! 

The waiter warned us that we would be good if we only ordered one thing off the menu each. He was really helpful with telling us how big the dishes were. I ordered the French Toast and my husband ordered the Black Magic Pancakes. I liked the fact that the food had big portions but I think when they are too huge it takes away from the experience. I like having sides with my entree. It isn't fun just ordering French Toast . My husband's Oreo pancakes were so big he could only eat the first one off the stack. The pancakes were bigger than a 12"" plate. The food was good but I suggest sharing food so you can taste something else off the menu. I would also ask if there were plate sharing fees.

At the same time, I am not being fair because we did not get what we expected to get.  Let me explain...no, there is too much, let me sum up.

My girlfriend and I originally intended on coming here early in the morning, and ready to eat some big pancakes.  But for various reasons, we had to come when we did, and we were not nearly as hungry and ready to eat a huge slab of pancakes as we intended.  So we ordered things we otherwise wouldn't have gotten, and we were disappointed.

She got breakfast tacos and barely ate them - not because they weren't good, but because she just couldn't eat.  I got the ""Sunset People,"" a scramble made with bacon, pork apple sausage, jalapenos, some hot sauce, provolone cheese, and potatoes.  It was not the best breakfast on the menu - I couldn't find exactly what I wanted to and went with something I thought I would like.  Don't get me wrong - it was okay, but it just turned out to not be what I was craving.

In the end, we didn't get any of their delicious looking pancakes or french toast or waffles.  Therefore, I don't believe I am being fair because we did not get what they specialize in.  But, I still have to review based on what I had.

On a more positive note, I did get a boozy shake - the Saturday morning fever, vanilla ice cream, buttermilk cake, baileys, kahlua and sweet cream.  It is for this drink that I am rounding up and not down.  I would come back just for another one of these.

BREAKFAST

As this short-lived second branch of Griddle Cafe is closing tomorrow afternoon, we decided to FINALLY try it, even tho it isn't the original in Hollywood. (My husband and I each lived in LA for 41 years, moving to Vegas in 2010, yet we never got around to trying the original GC, mostly because we weren't ready to do much of anything on a daily basis until around 4pm!)

What we had:

Friend 1: Tequila Sunrise. He really liked it, particularly the unusual ""tequila"" flavor strewn throughout it.

Friend 2: Scotch on the Rocks. This was a really great pancake ""concept"". She loved it, only ordered the single pancake ($3 less than the 3-stack standard priced item), yet left some of it because it was so rich. Yet very light and flavorful, I wish I had ordered it, I would've finished it!

Husband: Omelette ""My Soul"", selected it to include shrimp. This was perhaps the best omelette quality I had encountered in years. So damn fluffy, did they throw the eggs into a blender? It was wonderful. And the shrimps were rather large, and better than expected.

Me: Banananana. The famed bananas and brown sugar pancake. (Ordered only 1, that was definitely enough.) It was actually lacking in bananas, and very dense. The single most disappointing plate at the table, of the 3 I tried. (Didn't get any of that tequila dish, and now I almost wish they weren't closing tomorrow, cuz I could then try it!)

The bill came. The 2 bloody marys the husband and I ordered were charged $3 more apiece because we said to use gin instead of vodka, and considering it was probably well gin, that was completely ridiculous. And the bill itself, total with tip over $100 for 4 people, for breakfast, well, that's just too much.

So I've been there, done that. Goodbye, Griddle Cafe. We won't really miss you.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,1,0,3,A15tBaJgBZ-7tWtB1jZHQA

The other reason is because their menu is so particular to either salty or sweet; there was not a meal that had both or a simple meal such as eggs and sausage or ham with a side of pancakes. All thought you could order both, you would have to order a funky egg breakfast item with a side of a single griddle which is huge. The first day I ordered the 3 flaps then I had to order something else since even the single flap looked big.",8HEDZjar1PCsN_TKHcHnYw,0,0,3,3zPyzQCaJtIMx2LpHO_IQQ

We went for breakfast around 8 and we don't usually eat a lot in the morning but everything was HUGE. We got a waiter in training but he was being shadowed by another girl. They were really chill and helpful. i asked if there was any way to just get one stack of pancake instead of three. They said they could do it for me and when it arrived, it was still gigantic. Bigger than the size of my head. We ordered the rolled oats honey pancake. It was the right amount of salty with the butter and sweet from the honey. The texture was also very interesting because of the oats. Next time I want to try the espresso pancakes.
We also ordered the eggs benedict on top of the ham steak and potato skins. The ham was not bad and the egg was poached perfectly. The potato skins were okay for me because I like the innards of the potato instead.

The Poached y Papas Benedict was delish! Very interesting to have potato skins instead of bread... I dig it!! There was a bit too much hollandaise sauce though... so if I return, I will ask for less or to have on the side. The French-Pressed Coffee was very strong, but good - they come with complimentary refills. Others in my party ordered Strawberries and Cream Waffle, Shrimp and BLT Sandwich, Cobb Sandwich and all of us had the same consensus - food is awesome, portions are huge, and prices are fair. 

Service was just OK - hence the 4 stars despite the awesome food. The hostesses didn't seem to have an organized process - they went down the line several times asking us for the number in our parties. They had written them down, so I'm not sure why they can't keep track of who had been seated, and who hadn't. When it came for our turn, the hostess said - is it OK if we seat you at a table... all the booths are filled. I wasn't sure why she had asked this - I would have thought they were the same, but the way she asked us made it sound like the tables were a less desired option. For the record, we were fine with it, considering we were hungry! Our server was not very attentive, we had to flag him down for multiple things. The restaurant isn't very big, so I'm not sure how many other tables he had, but it always felt like we were bothering him. 

I would definitely consider returning for the food... hopefully the service will be better!",egeDp4KcOE75oF1FQGnL2A,0,0,4,bYiT9KJ_7NaG3VtUPDr8WQ

I've become used to extreme long waiting periods for service here--from waiting to be seated down to the wait from the server.

Utterly astounded by the low quality of service offered during my first to Griddle Café at the SLS Las Vegas but vowing to return it was with seven other adults plus one child that I sat down to breakfast on Saturday and while food remain TGC's strongest draw the  service has improved dramatically.  Eating in a group of locals and visitors, the later a big group of guys in town for The Olympia, it was largely with intentions of touring the menu that our order was crafted and although a few plates of proteins such as eggs and bacon were ordered the 'main event' was five stacks of pancakes and three piles of French Toast served in two rounds - a creamy panCAKE shake lightly tinged with boozy bananas plus plenty of coffee to wash it all down.  Obviously an absurd order, better suited to a table nearly twice our size, it was in the fluffy Good Ol' Fashioned, Peanut Bubba, Chocolate Chip Cookie, and Barry Mellow that we began and with Vermont Maple Syrup gilding many bites both the toasts went quickly, the standard buttermilk flapjacks nearly finished as well.  Moving onward with table cleared and more coffee poured as newly announced GM Adam Scholten watched his team work, round two began with the rich Nutella laden bread again a fan favorite, though the piping hot five-pound plate of flavors spot-on for pumpkin pie was quite delicious as well.  Finding the Barry Yellow a touch too lemony and not particularly well paired to syrup while Room Service and Saturday Morning Fever both fell victim to ""good, but not as good as the rest"" verdicts at a table approaching food-coma it should be obvious to anyone that leftovers were abundant and all packed individually with big bags to be carried the bill was paid, a smile on every face as we waddled back to vehicles with no plans to eat until late that evening.

Having now found its footing with a service staff that seemed perpetually in motion I'm happy to say that The SLS Griddle Café is now finally showing promise to be as good as its big brother in LA - the lack of ""off menu"" specials such as the Sweet Fantasy Baby Carrot Cake Pancakes and slow replacement of leaky French presses being resolved by steel replacements the only thing holding them back.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,6,4,92za1YkMLC3vefbvLt_AkA

First of all, the coffee is served in a French Press - you pay per cup (with endless refills)- we got about 6 cups out of on press - and it was more than enough. The coffee was delicious. There is some novelty in pressing your own coffee at the table - but it was really good coffee (strong and robust) and well worth the ~$4 per person.

So yes, guy gives me a box for to go and some fancy to go utensils, but note that these pancakes are HUGE.

Background - Wanted an easy meal and in our hotel.  I had seen this place on SLS website and the pancakes caught my eyes.  Friday night walking the floor I did not see the sign.  I looked at the map before we headed down.  Went to the spot where it should be and it was still there but a new name.  I talked to the hostess and noticed the menus.  They had put up their new signs too early for the new restaurant.  They covered up the signs as we ate.  They closed today at 4.

Atmosphere - Industrialized cafe with a mix of tables with chairs and the booths.  It is Vegas and you have to people watch and today it was a mix of crowd, the early birds, and those ending their night.  

Food
  Drinks - French press medium roast coffee.  My first time with a French press, a fan but I need that coffee faster!

  My Meal
    Main Course - Three pancakes of Time for Love.  Pumpkin and streusel pancakes, yum.  But the two of us did not even finish half of this order.  What a shame.  I served it up me and my wife as if it was pizza; it was that big, I estimate them between 10 to 12 inches each.  

Service - He was informative and helpful as he recommended that we did not order two separate orders of pancakes.  He indicated that one plate could feed all the people in our row of booths.  I think he was right.  

Future - I guess not since this was their last day of being open.  The new place will have smaller portions from the Griddle and reduce menu with additional pasta and steaks added.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,4,4,4,_TFUCMBqpiy7XXuV2o_T2w

I like that it's 24 hours... was my go to after work in the wee early morning...
I enjoyed the benedict with potato skin and I always had the nutella french toast goodness. Hashbrowns and bacon on point too!
If you love breakfast... you have to do the griddle.
Parking isn't a problem... as this property is new.
I'm a fan!

The tequila sunrise is your take on huevos rancheros and it was absolutely to die for!!

5825260,2014-09-21,0,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,OMG!  Is this place great!!  I had the best grilled shrimp and pesto sandwich I'd ever had.  And believe me when I tell you the sandwich was huge.  I could only eat a quarter of it.  My husband ordered blueberry pancakes...three cakes were the size of a large birthday cake!!!!  I've never seen anything like it. And they were delicious.   Needless to say the leftovers came home with us.,4E0tGWTGV53aIGNa-5aThA,0,0,5,Fmr7ONiFA_qmVXb5RuhxfA

There's really not much more to say.

The food was good.  REALLY good.

If you get the pancakes, you are making the right choice but do yourself a favor and tell them you want ONE pancake instead of THREE (the default when you order).  I PROMISE you will be glad you did.  I'm a big guy and I LOVE to eat and I barely put a dent in ONE pancake.  But it was OH so good.

What are you waiting for?  Go.  Just go.

I'll definitely be back.  Amazing.",m3mSG_1ajgp3JO-TGR37sw,0,0,5,dS7DdfQaCb4ORJfI-g-Fsg
5842149,2014-09-10,0,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,They have consistency with great food and service.  They accommodated a salad order that some places just say we can't do that.  Briel was excellent waiter. Salad could feed family of four easily.,3fMENOAnuMluMfMoctrS7w,1,0,5,TN2gD6P4jqXcGvyv6GKDHw

This place is definitely in my top three breakfast places in Las Vegas! I did not give them five stars because the service was slow, they ran out half and half for my coffee and had no bags for my to-go box.",-kRQLEDxrEBVNXImyAt_ug,1,0,4,ASGB7xG6xor0g5cMjfor6g

5919241,2014-10-17,8,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"If the long line doesn't drive you straight into insanity, the awesome food will.  Oversized food in a small diner; it's very cool and LOUD.  From LA straight to Vegas, it's worth a non-stop.  Plus, it's inside the SLS Hotel, so it's already great.

Great service by cool cats with a nice sized menu of treats, ranging from pancakes to eggs to burgers to salads.  The huge portions will stop you from ordering everything, so why not share one or more (you're on vacay, c'mon!).

1. ""Sunset People"" ($14) -- Huge portion, leftovers.  Eggs scrambled with thick-cut bacon, pork apple sausage (substituted chicken tequila sausage), jalapeños, potatoes, green onions, provolone cheese, and a shot of hot (it was very hot!). Served with chile-cheese toast (amazing).  (5.0 stars)

2.  ""Devil's Daydream"" Bourbon French Toast ($14) -- Huge portion, leftovers.  Dark chocolate bread loaded with bittersweet chocolate chips, dipped in our Bulleit Bourbon mixture, then perfectly grilled!  Topped with whipped cream. Didn't have the Bulleit Bourbon and Godiva Chocolate Liqueur shot, but available for $2 extra (darn!).  Amazing flavor, great bread!  (5.0 stars)

If you can hold out 30-45 mins in a longish line, definitely worthy.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,12,12,5,zoGKin7W8L3uyXeXlvc5gg
5950522,2014-08-31,1,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"I've been wanting to go to the hollywood location for some in my search for my favorite pancake but never made cause i live in San Diego. But when i found out they opened one up in Las Vegas a week ago, I knew my sister and i would have to stop on our way back up to school in Utah. We stopped here and it exceeded all expectations. Griddle Cafe is in my top 3 favorite pancakes with Hash House and Cafe on Park both in SD. The pictures on here don't show how really big the flapjacks are here!!! A stack of 3 huge, fluffy pancakes that even I couldn't finish the whole thing ( i will next time for sure). We got the ""golden ticket"" and the ""black magic"" pancakes. The golden ticket is loaded with bananas and i mean loaded! then topped with caramel and their vanilla whipped cream. The black magic is tufted with literally a whole package of oreos no joke. also topped with their amazing whipped cream. There is no need for syrup on these bad boys. I was in heaven to say the least...then i fell asleep for 2 hours. Food comas are the best naps!",jzeMY8o4DZ8vYPZnoIj7hg,1,1,5,JZLGF5x98iBYKg-SnYg7uw
5959916,2015-01-31,4,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"I came here for the pancakes and was not disappointed in the food. The service and drinks, on the other hand, were terrible.

Everything having to do with SLS is a disappointment and I'm not surprised that the restaurants are pulling out as quickly as they can.

Not busy on a Monday and our server couldn't keep our orders straight and ended up just bringing out the same order for both my friend and myself, despite us ordering different things. She admitted her error but aside from calling herself dumb and forgetful we didn't get much in the way of an apology as she continued to forget refills, take forever with drinks and return with my friend's corrected meal when I was already done with mine. 

The pancakes were excellent, so was the bacon. The shake was disgusting and had the texture of spit up.

I rarely give service so much influence over my star rating, but service it was so atrocious I couldn't get past it.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,2,jc51mm9Gn18Zwc4WtrhZag
5972091,2014-09-15,1,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"Food was insane. Definitely one order of pancakes can feed 3 people. I had the Yellow Brick Road Pancakes which had caramel, pecan, and butterscotch chips. SO GOOD. The pancakes literally took over the whole plate, you would have thought I was eating them off the table.

Service was really terrible. When I ordered, the server asked if I wanted a side of bacon. I said no (I'm a vegetarian..) He asked again, I said no, I don't eat meat! When my friends ordered sides of bacon he got very excited. Who knows, maybe they were having a bacon selling competition that day. Anyway, the last straw was when I was eating my delicious pancakes, he came and made ANOTHER bacon comment. He asked how the pancakes were, I said amazing, and he said ""Yeah, but probably not as good since you didn't get bacon on the side"". Ummm.... 
It wasn't just that though.. Water glasses and coffee cups were empty on our table for far too long. We asked for more cream, a glass of ice, and to-go boxes. He brought one thing at a time and had to ask us each time what else we said we needed. Not ok. 

I will definitely go back and hope for a different server, he really ruined my first trip to the Griddle. The food was just too good not to give it another try!",jJtMKVIUzdDG4xagIOSraA,1,1,3,f8QcuuO926VMTFFxqxAdow
5979178,2014-09-14,0,QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA,"Came here around 2:00 on a Saturday and the place was packed! I guess everyone wakes up late in Vegas. We were just 2 people so there was a ~5 minute wait. The waitress came by to take our order and check on us promptly and frequently.

The food, once you get past the shock factor at the size of the portions, is pretty mediocre. 

We had the Hoagie Omelet and the ""Addicted to the Noisella"" (Nutella french toast). 

The hoagie omelet comes with ""griddle potatoes"" and garlic bread. Hooo boy after eating that garlic bread, I'll be able to keep vampires away for a week! The omelet was quite dense and came with sausage and cheese on the inside, with bell peppers and onions on top. It was mostly eggs and cheese with just a little bit of sausage. I wish the onions had been grilled, and there were several pieces of onion skin present. As far as flavor goes, a hearty dousing with tapatio was required for my preference.

The french toast is huge and came with plenty of nutella. I wonder how big their nutella jar is in the back... mmmmmm. The french toast is pretty thin, though. I like thick slices of toast with lots of egginess, but I suppose if the toast was thicker and as big as it was, it would never be able to soak up anything. 

At first blush, although the prices are high, you think that it's a pretty good deal for how huge the portions are. But then you realize you just paid $5 for a side of bacon - 4 pieces! Yowch! 

Overall, if it wasn't for the novelty of massive portion sizes (although that doesn't really seem to be a novelty these days) and 24 hour breakfast so close to the strip, I'm not really sure there's anything that exciting to come here for.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,0,0,3,D6TookItEAv-NtFslh0mgA
