185581,2012-06-15,0,y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA,"First of all, I went to the store and ordered their milk tea. I could tell that it was old because it had a peculiar taste. It wasn't appetizing and I drank maybe a fourth and threw the rest away. My friend got the honeydew boba and it just tasted like powder. This wasn't the end. The service was awful and I was given attitude. I walked into the store and did not know what I wanted to order. After taking about five minutes to order (no other customers were inside the store) they started giving me looks and gave me a fit about taking too long. I found this very rude. The waitresses were far younger than I was and looked about 14. It was probably the worst service and quality that I have ever had when it comes to boba/smoothies. I do not recommend that anyone goes and has to go through the troubles that I had to go through.",GkjXAbqqBu_SQIOo130u7w,1,0,1,OuLyH9yxJpcEN56B3NJ4Dw

Luckily this place is worth the extra effort in getting there. The quality and selection of beverages is fantastic. They also serve ramen and snacks. I had the Volcano Ramen, which was very tasty and well presented. The service was friendly and quick. I only see a few negatives. Located on Jones and Spring Mountain, it's not in the most trendy part of Chinatown, but that does contribute to the many parking spaces that are available. The decor is on the plain side, but the low prices make up for it. My large taro smoothy, about 20 ounces, cost $3.15 plus tax. If you're in the mood for more than a snack, I recommend going to eat at one of the many restaurants in the immediate area then come here for dessert. If boba teas are not your idea of dessert, then have one of the shaved ice or snow (fluffy) ice desserts.

BTW, there is a $5 minimum credit card purchase amount.",KqbowpYkOxkpFNuEd-rTnw,0,0,5,7mZvg1Rkik3wvXw4xIREEA

547525,2013-04-09,0,y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA,"I have to honestly say this is my new favorite little place! I've been reading so many reviews and decided I should check them out, oh how happy am I that I did.First off the staff was very nice and the service was great. We even shared a few laughs and had a conversation. They really made me feel welcomed there. You don't really get that too much when you go to restaurants now a days. And the atmosphere was very nice and easy going.

It was my first time having Boba. So I decided to Order a Green Apple Smoothie with Boba (which was an over generous amount!) I'm not really keen on fish but I decided it wouldn't hurt to at least try the Heart Attack Roll. The Smoothie was so refreshing! It was a good mix between sweet and tart, exactly like a Granny Smith Apple. Perhaps better though because of the yummy Boba. 

The Heart Attack Roll . .  Was AMAZING. The saying ""You eat first with your eyes."" Is true To me Presentation is everything. And they nailed it right on the head. I couldn't even believe that all that Sushi on that plate was worth only $6.99. It was equal Parts Spicy and Sweet. The fried Jalapeno portion was nice and crunchy. And the creaminess from the cream cheese and Spicy tuna was very good.

I'm already sure this place is going to be the go to place for my sister's and I this summer. Refreshing Drinks, Bomb Sushi,K-Pop playing from two different tv's, and free Wifi. Sounds like a pretty good plan to me.",nnrjHg97sWLvqC-jEGdLZQ,1,1,5,UIESNw_HYkIQObYUpvdJ-g

They will customize your drink for you if you prefer it less sweet, which I do.  They even offered to remake it if I felt that it was too sweet.  Their  ramen is good.  You can add different types of toppings to it.  I love the rice cakes.  =] 

I love to site at Fresh Cup and read with a good drink.  Their bulgogi burrito is pretty tasty, too.  It's not too sweet which most bulgogi is.  They have the best shaved ice in Vegas.  I love all the fresh fruit that they have.  They pour condensed milk over the ice and then load it with tons of fruit!  It's amazing.  You must try it!  The first time I had the Fresh Cup shaved ice, but then I didn't really like the red bean.  The fruit shaved ice tastes really delicious! 

They have really good customer service.  They will not kick you out of the store even when it's past closing time.  I normally don't stay late, but there were others in the store.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,2,0,5,o8NMbLhVXOThNz3F4o-Z8Q

After ordering the heart attack roll and beef teriyaki roll we thought we would need an extra entree and went with the crispy salmon teriyaki. A short wait with our boba teas in hand and the parade of food made its debut!

A house salad with ginger dressing is always an anticipated fav at any sushi joint and this tea cafe did not fail to deliver. Miso soup ad sticky rice was reminiscent of a Korean style meal.

Then there was the sushi. My mouth couldn't fit the roll in one bite, but you better believe I tried. Wow. The right proportions of meat, rice, and sauce with soy sauce and wasabi to dip on the side. The pickled ginger even tickled my fancy seeing as some smaller joints can be subpar.

Needless to say we were stuffed by the end of this adventure. Aside from the great food and cordial service the teas were accommodating to our individual taste. It's nice to be able to request less sweet and inquire about the toppings. They were friendly and open to answer any questions and offered their service as the food was delivered to our table. Upon request they brought us complimentary water to wash it all down.

If I had the time I would make the trip to Vegas for their sushi alone but what kept me hooked was their service and soft chewy boba tea.

Service is great and the employees are very attentive and willing to help, also the dining area was very clean, no problems whatsoever in that department and to be fair, I must add that this place specializes on drinks, coffee, tea, and smoothies which I didn't try, maybe my rating would've been higher but for now based on the food items I tried 3.5 is where they're at......

1380635,2014-02-12,0,y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA,"One of the popular places in town for milk tea. Great place to hang out, grab a drink, study, read, play games, etc. 

Opened a few years ago, it has been one of the main places to hang out. Prices are cheap (in comparison to the chain Tea Station). They offer a variety of hot or cold drinks (tea, coffee, smoothies, slushes) to various foods (appetizers, snacks, and actual meals)

Free Wi-fi (password is their phone number located on their menu or yelp XD). Great for those who are working or studying for their phones (save data XD) or laptop/tablets. 

Environment is pretty nice. Not really loud, most times fairly quiet aside from their korean videos playing on the TV. They have various posters of different korean pop groups like Girl's Generation ! :D woohoo ! XD 

Staff is friendly. Over the years, their staff has been changing due to their employees or mostly students in either late high school or early college. 

They have a ""frequent customer"" card where if you get 10 stamps, you get one for free. 

Food wise, they are decent. I wouldn't be too strict on them because their speciality isnt in food. Bibimbap is pretty good. Good amount and ratio for ingredients to rice. Katsu is ok. Not my favorite place for that. Their sushi rolls are ... like most sushi rolls. Kind of hard to mess up. Decent for those who like to eat sushi rolls. 

The only issue i have with Fresh Cup, is their inconsistency. Due to the periodic change of employees, and different people working, each drink is different. My friend and I are huge fans of a GOOD jasmine milk tea. I am an avid tea drinker and love a nice tea. We once had a really good one. Strong flavor, less sweet, and a good amount of milk. Yeah that was the only one. Any other time it was ordered... flavor was a bit lacking or too sweet or too much milk or any combination of the three. If they could somehow figure a way to be always or fairly consistent, and keep their flavor up without helping people get closer to achieving diabetes... 

Another example is their avocado or papaya smoothie. I appreciate their honesty when they say their avocados aren't ripe, which prevents me from ordering it, but thats fine. quality control right? I wish they'd control their measurements for a more consistent result. Sometimes sweet. Sometimes not. Sometimes not blended enough. 

Overall still a nice place to go to. Would be the best if they can be consistent.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,4,-k_ZyCZw9AcGCydFV2Tl-g

The red bean smoothie was smooth without chunks of red bean and ice which is common at other Boba places. It was also very creamy and had the flavor still in it. 

Also, the smoothies use mostly fresh fruit. I think the other drinks use powder or syrup.

We ordered the fruit ice, a bulgogi burrito, and a spicy ramen.

When they girl gave me the bulgogi burrito, it fitted right in her palm, and she has a small hand. $2 for 2 bites of dry tortilla and bulgogi without any salsa and cilantro. It was a joke. 

I was told no meat in ramen, that's fine. But I was not told that my ramen is going to look and taste like instant noodle(Shin Ramen). If I knew that, I would have gone home and cook it with microwave. I would not have to pay $6 for that.

The shaved ice was not bad, only thing was we had to ask more condensed milk for our ice. I guess only we like things on the sweet side when eating dessert.

Wouldn't get the crab app again- just wasn't impressed, though it was both affordably priced and impressive to see on the menu in the first place.

The passion fruit (yeah I always get passion fruit) smoothie is refreshing but a bit on the sweet side. Not holding it against them as I know how hard it is to get fresh passion fruit in this could try. 

Due to my not eating I also tagged on a Vegas Ramen with a side of kim chi. Again the whole identity crisis bit comes into play. Taiwanese inspired drink, Japanese inspired noodles, Korean pickled cabbage, pop boy band videos on the flat screens...

I haven't really seen a sushi/boba combo place anywhere that I can think of -- I was excited yet kind of scared at the same time...

Anyway, I ordered the Batman Roll for $5 without really knowing what it was, and my usual Taro milk tea with taro pudding and boba.  I drove home wondering how the sushi would be and if I might wake up with a belly ache... 

Well, to my delightful surprise the roll was EXCELLENT!  It was the perfect portion and it tasted super fresh -- like it was from a sushi bar!  The boba was perfect and their taro pudding was especially good tonight!  Also, their customer service was great -- really friendly staff.  I didn't wait too long for my food but even then the girl apologized for the wait.  I will definitely be coming back to try their other food choices!

I ordered the chicken teriyaki healthy bowl and was so stuff but felt good about eating it.  It had lots of veggies and yummy grilled chicken with the sauce on the side.  I also ordered the spider roll and it was totally worth it for that price.  I think this is a great place if you are looking for something light and healthy.  

My friends had ordered the calamari which was coated with some sauce and it was interesting.  Still deep fried but still yummy.  Another friend got the spicy tuna roll and it was delicious.  

Not a big fan of the miso soup, a little much flavoring for me.

of course, that didn't stop me from finishing both drinks in record time.

i'll have to try out something else the next time i'm there.
perhaps something off the hot menu or something less sugary.
maybe i can ask them to use less syrup in my drink.

Around it, they put there daily fresh fruits. Some days they have kiwis, bananas, watermelons, etc. What I like about it is that it's different every time. They use fresh fruits every time.

I just literally got home from there and went straight to my laptop to type this review! Originally I just wanted to check out their boba drinks so I wanted to try their avocado smoothie with boba. But when I got there, I noticed that they had many other choices like sushi, teriyaki, and katsu.

As I approach the counter, I am greeted with all smiles and a warm welcome. Already I am getting good vibes from the aura that I am feeling from the Fresh Cup peeps.

So I order my above mentioned favorite hoping that it is decent. When they called me up to get my drink, it turns out that they made mango instead of avocado. Now im not sure if they misunderstood me when I asked about their mango, but what happened next truly impressed me and definitely won me over in giving my business to them. 

When I said I thought I ordered avocado, they apologized and said they will make the correct order right away. They said to go ahead and keep the mango to try. It was good but I have always been an avocado afficionado. I appreciated the fact that they apologized and quickly corrected the situation with no questions asked. 

As for the avocado smoothie, WOW! It's exactly what im looking for! The boba was soft and chewy. Im in love! 

Some tidbits. 10 dollar minimum for cards. Free wifi. Open til 11pm fri and sat. Til 10 sun thru thurs. Plenty of parking. 

Bottom line is, I just noticed this place the other day and decided to check it out without looking at any Yelp reviews because I wanted to find out on my own what they were all about.

We also really enjoy fried tofu but they serve theirs in a bowl of juice. I forget what they call it but it is appetizer #5. Maybe that's the way it gets served back home, but I prefer to be able to dip it while eating instead of having it get all soggy.

I like this place because its mostly empty and if anyone does show up they just eat and run. Ive noticed people these days dont spend much time enjoying what their eating and examining the flavor of the food anymore. If people would spend as much time as they do with their phone it would be great. With that said, I think the k-pop music playing in the background might just make you pay attention to the food.

  Its a young persons restaurant if you get me. Just the K-pop idols are everywhere around the walls haha. I would advice you to spend some time researching what k-pop is so you wont have that face like you just walked into the twilight zone. For you k-pop people you will like this place because it has the music, the tv shows on the tv and the affordable prices. I dunno how to describe the place though cause it has sushi, boba, teas, salads, and ramen. It's kind of like a mixture of whats popular around Asia. YeaH thats it! Ha! If you are immersed in the Asian scene than you will find this place enjoyable for a short period of time.

  Place is great to get work done. I spend hours doing work. Sometimes I am dead broke, but have enough to buy my time with food and drinks. So I like the affordability of this place. One outlet near by tho. But just plan ahead and figure out how your going to go about it and you'll be fine. Oh yeah buy enough drinks and fill up your punch card and get a free drink. So this place is ideal for that!

The food is also good for the price. Their sushi rolls are really cheap, so if you have a craving and want a cheap, quick fix this is definitely a good deal. Their bowls and boxes also have generous portions, a good bang for your buck.

Staff has also always been very polite and friendly. If you've been to a decent number of boba places in Vegas you'll know that service is not always consistent everywhere you go, not that I'm naming names or anything... haha.

Overall a good place to meet up and hang with friends. Free wi-fi, open seating, and catchy K-pop soundtracks in the background.

I usually ask them to water down the smoothies as they're too sweet for me. The service is amazing here. If you need anything, just let them know, and they'll try their best to accommodate anyone and everyone!

Really great service! They were all super nice, from the young man at the register, to the older ladies in  the back. 

Had the ""teriyaki"" lunch plates with my bf. He got spicy pork, and I opted for the bulgogi, both were good for the size and price! 

We also got a large boba milk tea with combo pudding (taro, egg, and milk pudding) and it was SO GOOD. 
I love my boba milk tea, and this place was great! 

It challenged my love for Good Foot, as the boba here at Fresh Cup was soft, and the flavor of their milk tea was not too sweet. (Looks like I have two options when I'm craving =o] )

Their tapioca balls/boba is great, not too sweet and soft, but a solid middle. 

They don't have a lot of those fancy teas that some other businesses have, BUT they do have free wifi (unlimited), various random Asian food (bentos, ramen, sushi etc), stamp cards, low prices, a quiet environment for studying, and ample parking spaces.

TVs playing k-pop mvs (when I was there)- and the service is very friendly. 

I'm a bit of a stickler with boba here, I've found it difficult to find similarly good boba drinks (needs a certain level of squish and flavor) for reasonable prices like in SoCal (where I feel there's heavier competition for boba places). You get both here. 

Bought two large boba teas for $3.95 (50%). Of course, with the economy, the prices may not stay the same. My peach tea was great, and I definitely did appreciate it being less sweet/syrupy. 

My brother, also picky, liked the almond milk tea. He even bothered to ask where I got it (he's not much of a talker). Boba's a little on the soft side but still got a nice level of squish and held up well even after an hour (I'm a slow drinker).

4107101,2014-07-18,0,y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA,"They seem to have a lot of food items, but I'm only reviewing drinks.

My friends invited me here, so I somewhat woefully detoured from my intended dessert. I'd been meaning to start trying the teas instead of the smoothies at the boba shops of Las Vegas, and I figured this would be as good a place as any.

Fresh Cup is a standalone structure in front of 168 Market and across the street from China Mama. They have decent seating, and it wasn't too crowded at our off-peak visit in spite of the summer heat. They also play a lot of Korean pop music and have posters of various girl groups all over the walls.

Other than the non-Asian smoothies and the specialty smoothies, the drinks (flavored teas, milk teas, jelly juices, smoothies) are cheap. The medium is currently $2.77 and the large is $3.15. Apparently, these drinks are all cold/iced since ""hot"" is a 50 cent extra, as are boba and many other add-ons. Puddings and some other toppings are 70 cents.

I had passion fruit green tea. I also unwittingly sampled my friend's taro milk tea, which was strongly (but not cloyingly) sweet, making it a candidate for future ordering but with the ""less sugar"" option. They have a ""no sugar"" option too (ugh, why?) and also less ice (ooh) or no ice, but I'm not sure if the cup will look as full without the ice.

So the sweet taro ended up throwing off my palate for the rest of my passion fruit green tea experience. Meh. From my first sip of my own drink, it seemed balanced with a little sweetness and non-overpowering green tea. The boba didn't seem quite as tasty as I've had before, but the chewiness was fine. Not the best rendition of this drink ever, but it'll work if I somehow don't find a better spot.

They have the typical buy 10 get 1 free stamp card. When I asked, an employee responded to me that they don't use all fresh fruit in their smoothies, so I'll probably stick to No. 1 Boba Tea if I'm in that kind of mood.

I've never had boba so soft and chewy before almost like munching on a gummy candy. Both drinks were equally delicious and you could tell it was fresh fruit.

I ordered a hot almond milk tea (tiny surcharge for hot over iced) with boba. It was a pretty solid hot milk tea and their boba had a good chew and sweetness to it. The BF wanted a shave ice and grabbed the mixed fruit which had mangoes, watermelon, kiwi, strawberry, bananas in it,  topped with condense milk and we added a scoop of ice cream. This was okay, it was plentiful but I think next time some red bean would be good with it to add some richness and texture. Prices are reasonable here for what you get.

It's casual counter service, but they are pretty friendly here.

There's wifi, k-pop on the TV and usually I like to think of cafes a place to stay a while but their seats are just typical wood seats. Not uncomfortable right off, but not something I want to sit on and do some work either. 

I'd come back again for a drink.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,1,4,lFUk9tVrD6-PeRT5NwVTXg

Thankfully, I have Fresh Cup to help get me through those Sunday afternoons buried in student papers.

There are just so many perks I couldn't justify giving them anything less than 5 stars.

1. The Drinks (the Kid Friendly Kind)!!!!

They have just about every type of drink you could want from Flavored Teas, Milk Teas, Ice Smoothies, and Fruit Smoothies.  And of course no Drink place in Chinatown would be complete without offering Boba (extra 0.50) to any drink you please.  I usually order their Peach Tea if I'm not feeling the Boba or Regular Milk Tea when the Boba craving hits.  Another plus is that you can order their drinks half sweet if you are feeling healthier or if you just can't take the sweet

Also they have a stamp card! Buy ten get one free!

2. Desserts
Who doesn't like shaved-ice fruit and condensed milk on a Hot Las Vegas Day?? I haven't tried their shaved-ice yet, but once it starts to warm up again I think I will.  Or if I'm feeling like a rebel in the winter


3. Real Food
Most Asian Drink places just have your usual Fried appetizers (which they have here too), but this place also has full on meals.  Including sushi rolls and rice bowls.  So far I've tried their Fried Calamari App and Their Yami yami Roll which were pretty good considering it was from a Boba place.


4. Wi-Fi
How else am I going to put the grades into my grade book?  Or look up awesome chemistry demos for my students without the Wi-Fi?  I've stayed a couple of hours here (don't worry I also order food and a drink) and they have never rushed me or made me give up a table

5. K-pop in the background and on the walls.  Now, I don't really listen to that music but it makes it is kind of fun to be around and makes the place not weirdly quite.

6. Nice Staff
Everyone that I've met that works here has a smile and is super sweet to me.  I feel like they actually like working there and that they like each other which makes me like the place more too

Overall:  Great place to get some work done, catch up with friends, or grab a quick bite to eat.  I'll be back many times I'm sure.  If you see an Asian girl buried in grading on a Sunday afternoon, it will probably be me!",QfFQvV6tcSg2cnbZORK3sg,9,9,5,cCk6n9mIVpPPIrxs25HbXg

I am always looking for locally-owned spots for meetings over a quick drink and for knocking out some work on my handy laptop. Fresh Cup delivers all of the above along with a top notch version of my go-to boba: unsweetened green tea. They use jasmine, my favorite, but what really sets this hang apart is the service! Both times I have visited there have been bountiful smiles and a desire to go above and beyond to make sure you're happy. Need an outlet? They will climb up on a chair to plug your computer into the outlet on the ceiling and then go out to buy an extension cord. Hot? They will turn up the A/C! Whatever you need, they aim to please all while making quality drinks. They have free WiFi too and a small selection of snacks. I snacked on some spicy chicken today, and it hit the spot.

Note: They also have a healthy appreciation for K-Pop.

But, definitely the perfect spot for a meeting, to get some work done on your laptop or to just spend some tasty time with pals.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,26,13,5,lyyLKkTiC2bCAQYL9RZ_iw

- egg pudding is flavorless. lacks texture and $.70!?  
- free-wifi and nice place to hang out. friendly.
- i'd come back, but i'm sure my mind would change a bit having to pay full price.
- can't compare socal boba to lv boba. impossible.

honey milk tea with boba and lychee tea with lychee for ~4.

To celebrate, I treat myself to Fresh Cup. I've been here many times and highly recommend the Thai Tea because it's the best here really. As my place my order while wearing my Miami Heat #3 shirt to represent Dwayne Wade, the cashier proceeds to ask me if I like the Heat, I respond ""yes I do"" and he proceeds to inform me he is a Spurs fan. We joke a little bit throughout ordering my Thai Tea WITHOUT boba, but he then tells the person making my drink to ""mess up my order"" - I take it as a joke and laugh it off. 

But as I received my drink, there is boba IN IT..hahaha you can imagine my disappointment. Homey cashier tells the person making my drink to mess up my order...AND ACTUALLY DOES LOL. I was definitely going to bitch out - however, going to Fresh Cup enough times, I know who is the owner and since she was very present during this situation, I decided to stay quiet and leave. Since then, I've tried to stay away from Fresh Cup, but damn their Thai Tea is good, so actually going to Fresh Cup, it's more of a toleration for me now - I go elsewhere to avoid disappointment. 

OH and another time, I was going to claim my Free Boba Milk Tea as I reached 10 dranks on my stamp card. When ordering, the cashier tells me the total, and I ask how come they charged me for Boba.. when it says Free Boba Milk Tea? and I forgot what the cashier says but allowed me to reply ""So shouldn't it just be Free Milk Tea?""....she then either agrees and apologizes or says I don't know and I apologize.

I shake my head. I don't know - maybe it's just me. But good thing Jones is so far - haven't gone back months hahahaha",cO-pVqt2ZKLItpeQZi5gjg,0,0,3,TTrKOPewwOTeRIFmjip_ig
5349136,2013-09-13,3,y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA,"First thing's first, there is a $5 minimum if you want to slide your CC. Now, if you're there for boba and want to slide, I'm sorry to tell but you're gonna have to get two drinks. If you'r there for food, well, you have no issues!

My review is strictly for their drinks -- boba or not. Now, I recently moved from California so their variety of flavors doesn't really do much for me. I've seen it plenty of times. Their regular sizes are about $3.22 and their larges are about $4 (?) I haven't ordered any larges so I'm unfamiliar with the price. 

+1 for them for having egg pudding as one of the choices. I love egg pudding in my milk tea and it was hard for me to find a place that had it as a choice in the Bay Area. It was probably more prominent in SoCal versus NorCal. It tasted like egg pudding too! (Trust me, I've tried egg pudding that wasn't egg pudding.)

Now comes the real deal. I've been to Fresh Cup three times and all three times, my Jasmine Milk Tea tasted different. 

Visit #1: Jasmine Milk Tea with egg pudding. My first visit was actually really good. I was surprised that the balance of jasmine tea, milk, and sugar was on point. I could clearly taste that it was jasmine and the milk/sugar combo did not kill the tea taste. Whoever mixed this drink for me has my thumbs up. 

Visit #2: Jasmine Milk Tea with egg pudding. Whoever mixed this clearly likes diabetes in a cup. There was NO jasmine tea flavor. The milk and sugar covered up any other flavors in this. It was like drinking water, milk, and sugar mixed in a cup. HORRIBLE. 

Also had a Mango Green Tea with boba. Yup. Definitely diabetes in a cup. The mango syrup killed everything. It was mango syrup water to me. 

Visit #3: Jasmine Milk Tea with less sugar. Nope. No jasmine flavor. No tea flavor. It was just milk with less overpowering sweetness. 


I'm not sure if I wanna go back for a #4 or #5 visit. Honestly, I do like their prices -- it's possibly the lowest in Las Vegas. I mean, tea station charges you almost $5 for a regular but then again ... quality. What I really want to do is find who mixed my drink on my first visit, take down their name, and always go back to them. Granted, I may just find another place instead. 

Oh and they do have a stamp system. However, the workers that work there never pointed that out to me or asked me if I had one. I didn't find out until on my third visit, my best friend took her stamp card out. Three separate visits and no mention of any stamp card. Great job. You could say that I should've read more yelp reviews but I didn't go to Fresh Cup because of yelp. I went because my friends liked the place.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,1,2,oE5gaOGukLjJz-5wBcEusg
5373379,2012-07-04,0,y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA,"Fresh Cup went into the space that used to be E-Jo Korean restaurant. I was disappointed to see that my normal Korean breakfast place closed down, but after trying their avocado smoothie, I am not too bummed. Even though the kitchen is mostly closed off, I was able to see that they used a full avocado in the drink. As I took the first sip, all that ran through my head was perfection. The smoothie was creamy and not too sweet which is a plus. There have been times where I order a drink, at other places, and cannot get myself to finish a quarter of it because it is too powdery or sugary. 

The inside is decorated with bright colors and plenty of K-Pop posters. On the TVs they also broadcast Korean channels. If you are looking for a place to come and watch your favorite Korean music programs while socializing with friends, this is the perfect place.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,3,5,3Sz10YdRJUbYVrgNaFmScA

Order is taken and delivered by a very cute and friendly staff (free on the house).

On a side note. I hope the owner will perfect the Snow Ice portion of the menu, as that was what I originally came in for with out of town friends in tow, but the texture of the shaved ice did not meet her standard so it was and will remain off their menu until she is satisfied with how it shold be served.

This is going to be one of my favorite place to relax when the temperature goes back to triple digits again for the rest of the summer.

Price/Value:  4.5/5.  Very reasonable.

Ambiance:  4/5.  If you close your eyes, while you have a mouthful of their Fresh Cup Shaved Ice or Fruit Shaved Ice, you can almost feel like you are in Taiwan.  Without having to spend the $1200+ and 19 hour trip time to fly their.

Location:  If you are near the Las Vegas Chinatown area, this is close enough for you to stop by and get some refreshing snack.
