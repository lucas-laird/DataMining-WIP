This is probably the worst sushi place I've tried...and IT'S their GRAND OPENING!!! We've waited for more than an hour to get seated and noticed that the waitress kept letting people skip in front of us, which was rude! After we got seated, we've waited at least another 30 mins before we got our drinks. Then we finally get to order...alot of the items on the menu ran out, so we have to go with what they have available. Totally understandable for having a promotion for BOGO! 
Then half of our orders didn't came, so we just waited there and we couldn't find our server, so we couldn't even get our check. I had to walk up to the counter to ask for our check. We just couldn't stay any longer to wait for the food that they forgot to place/prepare. The entire meal took us around 4 hours!!! I definitely would not recommend this place to any of my friends nor ever coming back to visit, even if they offer BOGO.",1CZeugL-WDspKt4nAKtuJA,6,0,1,PoIKT2sBvYsVot4VC3n7rQ
399458,2017-10-14,3,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"People often say to never judge a book by its cover and this place is definitely one of those cases. The pictures, design, and the mention of ""Izakaya,"" makes H20 seem likes something new and exciting. A fresh take on AYCE sushi if you will. Upon entering it seems like everything checks out. The place is nice and clean, and the interior design is great. This place reminded me alot of Gen with it's design choices. The service was good being that it was a soft opening, there were a couple mixups by the food runners. But it's to be expected especially since they did Bogo on ayce sushi. You order through a checklist and you get 3 rounds, we decided to order a lot the first round getting whatever looked good. There were already warning signs on the menu when I realized nothing really stood out, and the ""Izakyaka"" was basic appetizers you can get from any ayce sushi place. When the food came out, my lowest expectations were shattered. 

 Every roll and nigiri tasted liked nothing. The basic hallmarks of sushi is One. How fresh your fish is and Two. The quality of your sushi rice. When you miss on both, how does one find the audacity to even serve something like this? Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna. They all have distinctive tastes and yet all I tasted was dry meat while some were chewy when they had no reason to be. The fish to rice portion is great, big fish small rice. But when I tasted the rice I realized it was a means to distract someone on how terrible their rice is! It tasted nothing and the rice was choppy and falling apart. Not from sauce or anything mind you. 3 rolls, 12 pieces of nigiri, and all their special ""Carpaccio."" ask me about the difference and I wouldn't be able to tell you. It was the first time where I was still hungry and my mouth didn't want to swallow the food, yet I had to force myself to finish so I wouldn't lost any more money to this place. 

The ""izakaya."" I know izakaya simply means small dishes and stuff but when most Japanese spots around here throw out the word Izakaya it usually means something. The takoyaki was literally a fried donut with an octopus smaller then a dime.  The jalepeno poppers were shrunken pieces of jalepeno with a little spicy mayo on top, and the tuna crispy rice was basically tempura batter.  Places like Go, Kyara, Hachi, Raku, and Ichiza are definitions of what real izakaya is or aspires to be, the fact that they even went out of their way to add Izakaya to their name is a disgrace. 

This is the type of place people bring first time sushi goers and leave with them never wanting to ever try sushi again. It's a blatant million dollar cash grab with it's nice designs attempting to trick you into thinking the food here has to be good and maybe it's just you. Yet the putrid mediocrity of everything made here quickly brings ones to their senses. Upon walking out we witnessed multiple tables with hands over their mouths holding the food back, or couples looking in horror at a table full of trash that they somehow have to find a way to finish. And of course this place ends everything off with a home run by giving my girlfriend and I food poisoning. Curled up next to a toilet. What a way, to end a lovely night.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,6,0,1,DpG_OhYoVU7aCElVvbw_xw

675359,2017-10-31,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"My daughter and I went here for lunch during the grand opening week when they had the bogo Ayce offer . Thought this was an excellent deal . 
Food wise .- The broiled mussels was good, the teriyaki chicken was bland, no sauce at all, sashimi was great . Sushi was also good . 
What I didn't  like was the service . I asked for a fork and it took almost 20 minutes to get me one . I had to ask 3 different waiters . 
For a new restaurant.  I think they should be particular about this . It is understandable if the place was busy. But  at that time, it was not really that busy .  I think there were just 7 occupied tables and you can see waiters just keep on running around but not bringing any orders in .
I don't know . I just can't understand what took them so long to get a customer a fork .. Maybe just opening jitters . Hope they've passed it .",B3MV5gfYTDcyzJH39ptNiQ,0,0,2,DMbOlMi0gaGEIO46eeIT0Q

We constantly kept checking in with our waiter, and he would tell us ""they should be out in a bit."" Our orders kept getting mixed up with other tables. For our last order, we didn't even receive it until after we paid our check, which was about an hour after we ordered it. Waiters and waitresses treated my friends and I disrespectfully, giving us a rude attitude when speaking to us. Only good thing about this place was the BOGO AYCE coupon.

1165169,2018-06-17,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"H2O Sushi & Izakaya is probably one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had as a Las Vegas native. I had found out about the place due to their Instagram page, which boasts photos and ads of high quality sushi and other Japanese cuisine. But let me be clear, the food you see on their Instagram page is far from what you will get from when you actually dine there. When my friends and I had first arrived to the location, we felt like the place was extremely aesthetic and modern looking. But aside from the looks, the food and service, the very things that define a fine dining experience, were absolute garbage. I don't know if it's because my party of 7 people all participated in their ""All Day AYCE for $19.99"" promotion, but the food we received was not only late, but it was also sub-par or just straight up inedible. I feel like the servers/waiters of this establishment have a horrifically negative bias towards AYCE customers or teenage customers as our waiter showed obvious signs of sarcasm and negativity. I should also emphasize that we had 3 different waiters, and we still had to raise our goddamn hands like students to get their attention. (The place wasn't even that busy at the time we got there, which was around 8:30 pm, so there is almost no excuse why we had to go out of our way to get the attention of 3 different waiters.) The food we ordered was so mediocre, I can't even remember all the dishes we ordered. The albacore carpaccio was bland and barely had any taste, the albacore rolls were lifeless, the smelt egg and roe nigiri was extremely salty, the takoyaki was undercooked and felt extremely doughy, there was bones in our eel and salmon nigiri, there was even hair on one of my friend's macaron ice cream. Long story short, the food here was definitely not worth the unusually long wait times that we had to go through. All the food we ordered could have been done by other sushi restaurants in under 10 minutes, and we had to wait 25+ minutes for some of the most simple dishes on their menu, only to be disappointed by the food's execution and taste at the end. My friend August had ordered a chicken skewer, which not only took 25 minutes to apparently make/bring out, but the skewer was laughable. (Like literally, all of my friends were laughing at how disappointing the chicken skewer was. It was literally skinnier than a stalk of asparagus, and it took the kitchen 25 minutes to bring it to us...like wtf?) Maybe we arrived on one of their off days, or maybe we were just downright unlucky, but my friends and I know we will never come back here again after this establishment had literally made our Saturday night a cruel disappointment. If you decide to eat here, I wish you the best of luck, as it seems you will be needing it to get not only get decent service, but also tasty food at a reasonable time.",1Qdco0WdaYoneufbUknRhQ,3,0,1,HDbdFvzM_ieQC6mlOqkc5g

1367004,2017-10-23,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"My friend and I came here because of the grand opening BOGO. 

The interior was nice and comfortable. However, the food and service was not great. We came at 10:30pm when this place closes at midnight. We ordered our first round which came pretty quickly considering the restaurant wasn't full and busy. The sushi was ok but most of the nigiri was not fresh especially the squid. I took a bite and had to spit it because it was mushy and it smelled foul. 

Second round came and apparently it's already last call at 11:00pm so we were rushed to order everything at once.  Our second round most of the orders were incorrect such as my yellowtail hand roll came out as albacore and then suddenly we had edamame when we didn't write it on the paper. The funny thing is when you turn in the paper they sit in front of you and review what you ordered and they still get it wrong. No refills on our tea from 3 different people and when we did get a refill a busser brought us one cup of tea leaving my friends cup empty. When we asked to get a refill the manager came back and said they had shut off their tea machine and asked if water was ok...what other options do we have? They charged us $2 per tea and they think because they're closing up it's ok. They didn't even remove one tea charge from the bill for that. The worst part? My friend and I got pretty sick from eating here afterwards. Let's just say we are both dehydrated as a result of this. I would not come back here even if they had another BOGO.",4l-COl0ln3mAkGbH8_q9Yg,0,0,1,Z1Fenf0KbCEXLvf7CqUJYw

1432132,2017-10-28,8,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"Came here a several days back for H20's opening week. These guys are from the Southern California area, and are branching out to Vegas for their first location in this state. I would say that they did a pretty good job considering the circumstances.

It was really busy when I got there. Super busy. I didn't mind because I understood the circumstances. By the time we got seated, I was ready for it. They do the AYCE sushi thing, quite popular in Vegas, but they are adding a little twist to it. They put in that hipster vibe to it. I really liked the décor.

Service was OK, but it could have been better. It was opening week, and I'm sure they are accustomed to the numbers by now. Hopefully.

The food. I liked pretty much everything that was ordered here. The freshness across the board was really well done. The only thing that came out a little strange was the squid. It came out a little bit not so fresh, but it was edible. But everything else was really great, I recommend the carpaccio's, they were phenomenal. The only thing I wished they had was Uni on the AYCE menu, but oh well, a boy can dream, can't he?

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a very good quality sushi place, in a fun, modern vibe.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,18,19,4,lIXTkFhtVdBtJKipdUhA2w
1435115,2017-10-21,1,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"My girlfriend and i came in for the BOGO ayce experience.

The service at H2O is definitely excellent. There is a busser that sounds like bruno mars. He is really friendly. We initially over-ordered so the server politely suggested that we amended our order so we wouldnt get over charged. We ended up not ordering most of the specialty rolls. When we complained, management was gracious enough to deal with or shenanigans. Honestly, very caring. our waters were refilled at an amazing rate as well. 

Onto the food. Most everything was delicious. The chicken was sweet and crunchy, the takoyaki was soft with enough chewy texture from the tako, the tempura was warm and crunchy, the yakitori was perfect (especially the chicken.. It was soft and tender), mussels were well baked and lightly sweet, furikake fries were honestly great with a crunchy outside with a soft inside, and while the crispy rice wasn't our favorite, the poppers were delicious. The appetizers were great, and most of the nigiri was good as well. the rice was sweet and a bit sour. Most of fish from the carpaccio and the nigiri were fresh. The exceptions were the ikura and yellowtail. We informed the staff after my girlfriend had eaten the ikura. The management at informed us that ikura usually smells fishy and tastes salty as we complained, but this time it simply didn't smell fresh. When i smelled it, i tried some to confirm. They didn't taste fresh either. Later down the line, we also had the yellowtail. Initially, we dove right in, but moments after consuming, something didn't feel right. We ended up with stomach aches and we found ourselves finishing the chicken and the takoyaki to avoid the charge. Even after our complaint, though, the management took away the ikura and yellowtail from our bill. It was very nice of them to do so. I really appreciate them for that. 

If not for the yellowtail and the ikura, our food experience would have been really nice, especially with the great service they presented. Will leave at a tentative 3*. I feel like H2o deserves a second chance. Earlier in the week, they had a problem with running out of food when we tried to go the first time, so i assume they had a hectic week. Will update after a second go around. Honestly, great potential experience, just a few bad eggs.",TZCPXnoK4UeUBrgH7oxxhw,0,0,3,_1U9VPNqYwIMnd5MnZjjlA

1673926,2018-06-18,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"Where do I start. H2O Sushi was definitely the worst sushi experience I have ever had. And yes that is included in the experience I had at Sushi Neko where I fell ill and threw up when I arrived home. 
 
We saw this place on Instagram and thought this might be a good place to eat dinner following our little hang out. We read the reviews the prior day and saw that many people didn't like it, but we changed our mind because a certain friend said it was good. She was absolutely wrong. I thought it wouldn't be too bad because of the $20 promotion price, it would save us money and the reviews definitely made the place out to be an amazing sushi dine in experience. 

Let's start with the service. Absolute Trash. Out of the 4 servers present on that day, none of them even thought to come and check our table and make sure the table was doing fine. We had to wave down a server every 10-15 minutes to order or to check up on a previous order that was running about 20-30 minutes in the kitchen. I assumed that the longer it took in the kitchen, the better the food quality would be. Each server had an attitude and never took us seriously when it came to ordering. When we let the server know that it was our first time at the location, they just handed us menus and left us all alone. Not one server bothered to explain the menu to any of us. We had to order solely based on the menu descriptions which were mediocre. Not to mention that the place was EMPTY when we arrived at 8:30 and we were still kept as last priority. We had to constantly remind the server of our order and we had to constantly re-order our food so we can eat. 

The food was also garbage at BEST. This is definitely the WORST food i've had at a sushi place. All the nigiri was chewy and bland, the salmon and eel even had bones in it which can easily be traced back to the carelessness of the chefs. When I walked to my car and back into the restaurant I saw a chef on his phone laughing and joking with the other chef. This bothered me so much because they had no place to be on their phone and joking around when we had to wait half an hour for each item to be delivered to our table. It was down right disrespectful to leave bones in the sushi that were on the SURFACE of the fish. It ABSOLUTELY UNDERLINES the carelessness of the chefs and servers. The salmon and smelt eggs took 45 minutes to come to the table and were VERY salty, each bite would make it saltier and saltier. If you're looking for good food, do NOT come here. I suggest going to JJANGA Steak and Sushi, or even Hokkaido Sushi. 

Whenever I crave sushi I go home not wanting to eat for weeks because I stuff myself, but this time I was just COMPLETELY disappointed and I went home dissatisfied and honestly, sad. Our server even gave us over to a new server to serve a new table that he was being much more attentive and less sassy towards, maybe its because we were teenagers, but that gives the server no right to treat us any different. It was an absolute waste of $20 and I would definitely come back just to let the manager/owner know just how SORRY this sushi establishment is. 

Please don't listen to other 5 star reviews, this place is flavorless, service-less and a complete fuckin' garbage dump.",GzWD-kZ9bAh0UeSGeEFtAQ,2,0,1,JsRC_qavZJ1lO_qMxb91Bg

1802222,2018-06-06,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"I really liked the atmosphere, the decor, the sushi quality was really good. Why I'm giving it three stars: the restaurant was about 25% full and there was a significant time for our rolls to come out. The last roll took about 15 minutes from when we ordered it until we got it. For one roll. When we ordered drinks they came out after two plates of sushi came out and we weren't checked on as often as you would've liked seeing how much business was in the restaurant. I'll probably give it another try just because the fish was so good but if the service is as poor again that will be the last time.",-VwV6SHx44MVyIpLPcb8PA,0,0,3,7g6xS8Vo3Bv8vCdOxKON_Q
1803481,2017-10-22,1,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"My friends told me it is a horrible place but I wanted to try it out myself. Usually for a AYCE restaurant, dinner is more expensive because they offer something a bit more premium such as uni or sweet shrimp. But they charge extra just bc its dinner, there is nothing different. 
I think most people come because of the BOGO. I don't know if it was because the management just don't care about the customer service? The bus girl literally warned me first when she led us to our table saying there will be penalty for left over food so don't go crazy. Are you fucking serious? Then the waiter came, I don't know if you ever experience someone being ""politely rude"". He was using all the nice words but it just came off with the feeling that he is not friendly and he doesn't really care. We waited over an hour for the sushi to come out, I don't want to even begin with as a new restaurant, the quality of meat is not good. We were eating at 3pm on a Tuesday, there are literally 3 other tables in the restaurant and it took them 1 hour to finish 12 sushi?! I mean, WOW! I raised the glass to the waiter and he knew that I need water. Half hour passed by and he did not refill my water. I had bring my glass and go to the kitchen to ask for some water. The best part comes at getting the check. I told the waiter we were ready for our check. 15 mins passed by and he seems forgot our request. I had to walk to the cashier, I told her that we have been waiting 15 mins for a check. She gave me the I don't give a shit look, print out my check and took my credit card. After I sign and got my credit card back, I said Thank you to her she DID NOT EVEN RESPOND, like I am not even there. It is ironic because the general manager Mr. Ko, was sitting right next to her by the bar and looking at comments on yelp. Well please read this Mr. Ko. The customer service in ur restaurant sucks, and they don't even care even though you are sitting right next to them. I opened 2 properties on strip, I know customer service and your restaurant have none.

1865215,2017-10-16,8,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"I left H2O's BOGO grand opening with mixed feelings. The location is nicely decorated and modern, the prices are reasonable, the plating is nice, and the service was attentive and personable. But the AYCE menu is limited in some ways that other similarly-priced spots are not (few nigiri options, no dessert). To balance that out, they're one of the only places to offer carpaccio dishes. I found myself preferring their rolls because the fish itself didn't seem to have much flavor on it's own. This took a while to notice because each round we ordered took around 45 minutes to hit the table, other than appetizers, which came out quickly. 

They manage the basics well (the tako and shrimp were better than average), and I like that they make the effort to utilize garnishes that both add flavor and make the dishes visually appealing. But the fish quality itself could be a bit better, or more consistent. The timing issues we experienced I will chalk up to kitchen kinks that will get worked out with time, though I will note that their dining room was half empty when we experienced delays. I'm willing to give this place another try. 

First world problems: like their sister poke spot, there is poor lighting at most tables. Ask for the spot on the back left corner under the LED wall if that matters to you.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,14,3,iEQWUtCUFuRPuNptSAr11w

1959368,2017-10-14,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,BOGO sushi? We're there! The decor of this place is really nice. There was a slight ocean smell upon walking in and you could tell they were still working at getting this place ready for business. This wasn't a big deal to us and maybe that's why the service was .. alright. The sushi menu is not extensive at all. No super white tuna nigiri which is my favorite but they do have lots of variations of california rolls. I was very underwhelmed especially for its nearly $26 price tag for dinner. This seems like a place to draw in novice sushi eaters and of course all the tourist from the strip. Their nigiri was cut very thick to the point where it was really annoying to eat. The sushi rolls were poorly put together. In my honest opinion the best thing here was the pork belly and the french fries we ordered for my one year old. We kept getting asked how's the food. I understand a new business needs feedback but I think getting asked three times throughout our meal is a little overkill. The ordering system is a sheet of paper that you fill out yourselves. I'm happy we tried it but we probably won't be back.,neEH9W1Gve1sEfRxbzooKA,6,0,2,1zVsL6JP4Fx4P7aFhcTpgw

2084381,2018-01-16,3,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"I came here with 3 friends at around 6:30pm on a Monday evening. This restaurant is located in Hughes Center, off Flamingo close to Paradise. It's tucked away and not visible from the street. The restaurant is very modern and elegant. It was pretty dead when we walked in, (probably because location), and we were seated immediately.

We all went for the AYCE, priced at $26.95/pp which is comparable with competitors. I liked that the menu showed pictures of the rolls and had detailed descriptions. There are 2 different menus, one for ala carte and the other for AYCE. Usually when you get AYCE, you can get everything on the menu, but this was not the case here. Many of the ala carte items were not on the AYCE menu, like cucumber rolls and a roll with scallops, which is a friends favorite. They also do not offer half rolls which is disappointing because it gives you the option to try more things. And the last bummer is that dessert was not included with AYCE and was an additional $4-5 more. 

We ordered some appetizers, a variety of rolls, and some nigiri. The food came out slowly, which was odd considering how slow the restaurant was. I enjoyed the garlic chili edamame, Vegas roll, and the salmon nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is crazy (in a good way) on the nigiri. There is only a little rice and a huge piece of fish, which is usually the opposite at other places. The service was good, we always has someone coming to check on us and fill waters or clear plates. But because there are a million other AYCE sushi spots in town, and the exclusions this place has, this is unfortunately a one and done for me.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,5,3,6T1HKqvFaE3QTAyHiStTiQ
2089853,2017-11-16,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"*** Review for 10/30/17

I was quite surprised when I checked into this restaurant and saw such a low rating (two stars!). The interior is extremely modern with minimalist furniture and design (even crystals used throughout the decor). Lots of staff on hand, and everything looked very clean, though perhaps it's because it's still so new? I suppose time will tell. 

I came here for lunch and definitely enjoyed the lunch special at only $10 a person! This is pretty unheard of in this area (being so close to the strip). The lunch itself also included SO much food (note here they just call it their 'Combination Lunch' if you ask for their '$10 lunch special' they will look at you as though you have two heads). In this Combination Lunch you get a choice of 2 entrees (you read that right, two!), plus a salad, miso soup (my co-workers said was good, I wouldn't know I can't stand it), a dumpling, California roll, veggie tempura, and edamame. I personally then had shrimp tempura and chicken teriyaki as my entrees. The tempura items were all VERY delicious (as was their sauce to go along with it). The teriyaki was also quite delicious. However, everything else was pretty mediocre.

The service was quite slow, and it seemed like the staff wasn't really quite up to speed to be open yet. I'm hoping this is just because it is still so new. We also waited quite some time for the checks after the meal. This is a big no-no for lunch in this plaza because most people only have an hour and need to get back to work. Overall I'd probably return if only for a cheap, filling lunch. By far though not my favorite lunch spot.",KjMt33U4VCs84CQAEn3XUg,0,0,3,PhXxz_J89_-xQbUCrHYnFQ

Food was great
Service was 
I don't get it why so many people gave bad reviews 
The only thing that made me sad was the half roll thing,a lot of ayce sushi restaurants in vegas, they do half roll, but H2O doesn't do half roll for the ayce 
But when i asked the staff, they explained that it's the company's policy or concept. After the the staff had explained that point, i really understood and respected its policy and concept. Would really recommend this place
Good job guys
Would definitely go back for their ayce sushi and rolls",a6fg4kvOG3tGENxMD7_EmQ,1,1,5,46XLf087v8lGsY9_fuKXeg

The cons - service is so so and the menu is one of the smallest I've seen. 

Pros - it's only $20 per person with enough stuff that I liked ordering over and over that made it worth it, and they've got plenty of drink specials if you're trying to get your buzz on at dinner. 

The standouts were the H20 roll, the shrimp sushi, the udon, the pork belly, and the cucumber salad. One thing to note - I like eel sushi. It was cooked as it is everywhere but it was served cold and that was a letdown. 

The shrimp sushi shocked me cuz it's usually meh when I get it other places but I was hooked after the first bite. It's wild how something so simple can be so good. The first bowl of udon I got was super delicious. The veggies in it were great and the flavor was excellent. The second order wasn't as good as the first but my buddy said his first bowl was pretty good so I dunno if there's a pattern or it's just a bit random. 

The other items were just very good dishes that I'd definitely order again.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,1,1,4,PLR0Si0vizpIYcI89DIgXg

2991755,2018-01-17,2,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"I went to H2O on a Tuesday night with a group of girls for an AYCE sushi date. It's hidden in the business corners of the Howard Hughes area, but easy to find. I was pleasantly surprised upon walking through the doors to a pretty large, well lit, beautiful restaurant with glass hanging from the ceiling. We were seated right away and all chose the AYCE option. After dining, we realized there are some pretty good rolls NOT on the AYCE menu that I would have loved to try. If I return, I'll go the al la carte route. 
I say if, because overall, with all the sushi options in town, nothing major stood out to me here. I enjoyed the Vegas roll, and the Mexican roll, especially the fried jalapeños on the side. But everything else was mediocre, and the eel was a miss all the way around. 
Same with the service. Not that it was bad, but it wasn't great. A bit slow, and there were definitely empty plates on our table longer than I'd prefer. Nothing to complain over, but was I wow'd, not even a little bit. 
AYCE dinner price is $26, does not include things like cucumber rolls, soy paper rolls, dessert, or drinks. When you have places all around Vegas with extraordinary rolls, and revolving belts, basic sushi in a popular area isn't getting this local girl hyped up, but that's just me.

Udon soup was one of the appetizer that I thought was way too salty, i usually can eat pretty salty but this was not consumable.

The sushi was ok fresh, I have had better quality sushi else where for about the same lunch price. Their presentation of the dishes were impressive though, look great!   

The service was surprisingly fast and nice, the sever would come check on us every so often.

3352533,2017-10-21,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"My friend and I tried this place for dinner last week, as they had a BOGO special as part of their opening. The regular price for the AYCE lunch is $19.95 and dinner is $25.95. The place very spacious and being new, really clean. I liked that they offered four carpaccio options (Salmon is the best one) and it's not limited to one order per person. 2 of the carpaccios are albacores though. The fish portion on the nigiris was also on the bigger side and all the fish tasted fresh. However, service was soooooo slow. The first 45 minutes we were there, we only got edamames, a seaweed salad, one mushroom yakitori, a spicy tuna salad, a mixed tempura, and baked mussels. After that, the carpaccios and nigiris slowly started coming out. I got full from all the waiting. Maybe that was their BOGO AYCE tactic, along with not having the salmon collar lol. They also forgot some of our orders and it took a while to get our payment processed.

Honestly, I wouldn't come back for the full price. There were not a lot of options to the nigiris (they don't have uni, sweet shrimp, scallops, snapper, etc.). There was nothing special on the appetizers and most were not that great, but I did love their baked mussels. They're fresh, juicy, and delicious! Their yakitoris were not great as well. The mushroom was bland and the pork belly was tough! No dessert was included with AYCE. The server explained that since they gave out bigger portion of fish with very little rice, they couldn't offer a dessert as well for the price. I'm telling you that the rice portion is not that small. It's proportionate to the fish portion. Neko or Sakana actually gives smaller portion of rice with similar size of fish and they include a dessert. There are a lot of other AYCE places in town with similar pricing or cheaper (Yama!) that are simply better, so I say skip this one!",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,1,0,2,j7dqZQ1e8ZHjoFbC0JMa9A

3466442,2018-05-29,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"Another great off-Strip find! I discovered H2O Sushi via Instagram, so we decided to check it out for dinner a couple nights ago.

For buffet sushi, it was decent! Their ""Sashimi Wave Carpaccio"" was a nice take on typical sashimi that AYCE places offer. We went through several orders. Fish was fresh and for the various special rolls, it was nice that they didn't ""over rice"" the sushi like other places usually do. However many of the special rolls were imitation crab based which was expected to control costs!

What really hit the spot for me was the appetizers! The tempura, takoyaki, gyoza, and skewers were all delicious. Easily can hold their own as small plates in other restaurants. 

Alcohol here is DIRT cheap too...$2-$3 pints, $7.99 pitchers, BOGO specials on Saporro and Sake...we downed a couple beers as well, which may not have been wise since we ate all that food.

Service was friendly and efficient. They came to take orders and delivered orders quickly. Which is actually quite impressive considering how busy this place got in the later part of the evening!

H20 is currently offering a $19.95 AYCE special (ALL DAY) which is such a great deal considering the variety of options you can pick from in the menu. No item limit on how much you can order, just make sure you finish what you get!

I'll definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas! Drive over from the Strip was only a couple minutes and the food/service was great.

When a customer comes into the restaurant, they shouldn't have to fight for attention, only to be turned AWAY.

Ordering is unlike other AYCE venues. You actually have to fill out a sheet (pictured) with your order. The sheet only has 3 rows, implying you can only order 3 times, but the server told us you can in fact order more than 3 times if you'd like.

3823181,2017-10-14,2,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"OMG this place looks fancy!! I'm glad I came on Grand Opening. I took my friend here for her graduation as a nice dinner present. I also bumped in to my food blogging friends and they had an event here at the same time. So excited we chose this place to try out and share the wealth on our experiences. 

They have a buy one, get one free on dinner till the 21st of October starting at $25.95 a person and lunch at $19.95 a person. H20 Sushi includes a separate menu for AYCE, a full bar menu, and a dessert menu. 

It was troubling at first because even though the restaurant was busy, our group was waiting nearly 15 minutes after we sat down to get a waiter to take orders. We didn't even get water/beverages during the wait. Another waiter named Romeo saw our table with concern and approached us to recover Jared who helped us originally. Although Jared took our paper orders, he did not once asked if we wanted anything to drink. Although, he did check up on us even when Romeo took over to take care of the group. He was still accommodating. I like the team work with all the servers. Even our Bartender John came over to serve us personally with some nice sake bomb lessons. Lol

We definitely love the ambience and of course the up to date hit songs. Feels very very trendy. Modern contemporary design. Noise level is average. Seating was intimate with built in booths. There is also a seating area at the sushi bar for that close experience with the chefs. 

We would definitely come back for more!! The food portion was perfect. There was a lot more fish than rice and they are generous on the Sashimi! Great Service and Food! Shout out to our Server Romeo and Bartender John!! Great to have them.",lUGiHH2La_BuHoBrR1aGlg,0,1,5,GROyPjbOaAZtOEUMQuJFiQ
3837389,2017-11-08,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"I would give H20 a 3.5 if I could.

H20 offers a lower cost version of sushi that is good for many but maybe not those who seek real sushi grade sushi.  I think that the ""all you can eat"" for $25 is great for many people.  They do an excellent job of presenting a good value for a sushi dinner. 

H20  is hidden off of Flamingo in a new strip mall at the edge of Hughes Center.  In order for inexpensive sushi to exist they need volume.  I was alone at the sushi counter and there were only a few other customers in the very large and empty dining room. I think that is due to lack of marketing more than any thing else.  They are not five star sushi, but they do serve good sushi and other things. 

I ordered three sushi types:  salmon belly, tuna, and yellowtail.  I also ordered the H20 roll, the chicken and pork belly skewers.  They were all nicely done, but the fish where not the top grade.  I really want to say that I am not criticizing them at all. They do an excellent job at the price point they are selling into.  For me, sushi dinners often cost over $100 and I consider sushi one of my most expensive dinners.  H20 offers an all you can eat  sushi dinner for $25.  Based on that criteria they should get 5 stars.  

Although I might not return, I think that they are addressing a legitimate market for sushi for those who want a less expensive alternative.  They are a chain which is hoping to expend the taste for sushi and that is a very worthy goal.  I hope that they can come up with a plan that gets them noticed.",Lb5a2VJFaH1w48GewaZctw,1,0,3,_aJaOYqlI9gDUX2deBjsEw

Fine no problem, we just placed a big enough order to make sure everyone got what they wanted to eat. 
When our food arrived almost half an hour later, it was NONE OF THE ITEMS we ordered. Instead we got 6 California rolls and fried chicken. Apparently they ran out of all fish for the evening and that's all the food the cooks were able to make. That's some careful calculating when you run out of ALL fish on exactly the last customers of the evening. 
The ""manager"" came over and promised to take care of our next dinner. We payed and tipped. Called them back 4 days later about the comped dinner and the receptionist (Angel) remembered us. She connected us to a different manager who straight up denied that any of these things had occurred and that they would not honor the comp.

4053615,2018-01-16,1,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"H20 Sushi & Izakaya is just ok in my opinion. Located in the Hughes Center, off of Flamingo, it is a very clean and modern looking restaurant with beautiful decor. 

I had dinner here on a Monday night with 3 lovely ladies, there was no wait to be seated at 6:30. We all went with the all you can eat option for $26.95. This is a pretty standard price for AYCE sushi dinner, what I found disappointing was the limit to the AYCE menu. Many of the rolls and nigiri items we wanted we would have needed to order a la carte, and dessert is also not included. Another downside to H20 is they do not offer half rolls as many other places do. 

Service was friendly but seemed rather slow for the amount of guests in the dining area. Our order trickled out item by item, at more than one point we were sure they had forgot part of our order but it eventually made it to the table. Other reviewers mention the presentation of the dishes, I only found the first dish (tuna carpaccio) to be impressive in terms of  looks. Empty plates could have been bussed more quickly, and one of my friends had to ask multiple times for lemon wedges.

The food itself was pretty good, but not great. The seared garlic tuna carpaccio wasn't very garlic-y but it was still very tasty. Of the rolls, the Las Vegas roll was my personal favorite. There was nothing I had that wowed me

We all left very full so no complaints there... Las Vegas just has too many options for AYCE sushi without the limitations that H20 has for me to say I'll be back anytime soon. If I do return, I doubt I'd do AYCE.

4107206,2017-10-16,3,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"If I really wanted to ding them for opening week service issues, then this would be a worse review. However, the food was my focus.

H2O Sushi & Izakaya is a brand-new Vegas outpost of a SoCal chain, and it's located next to Bandito in that new glassy building on Flamingo and Hughes Center (near Paradise). I learned of their opening buy one, get one free promo via social media and managed to convince some friends to join me for the last day. This means that the $26.95 weekend/dinner price ($19.95 weekday lunch) for all you can eat sushi was essentially halved, which is also a reason that I can be more lenient.

First and foremost, the food. By and large, it's delicious. The highlight of the menu is AYCE carpaccio, which is  a modernized, lightly dressed and spiced sashimi with five not-too-thin pieces per order. That's a strange number for sharing, but anything is good as long as they don't impose a limit on orders. The AYCE menu's carpaccio options are salmon, seared garlic tuna, albacore, or cajun albacore. Salmon is the best here and was the best nigiri as well (with the typical oversized fish-to-rice ratio). The other carpaccio were also good, although the albacore tasted a little mushy.

Other nigiri also made me quite happy:

- Saba (mackerel) is one of the best that I've had in town, with some sweetness to offset the typical brine-heavy flavor.
- Ebi (shrimp) is never something that I've enjoyed, but I did here. They don't use the awful, thin cut which most restaurants offer, AYCE and otherwise alike. This one feels and eats like a real shrimp. Ikura (salmon roe) is delicious, with salty pops filling your mouth.
- Tako (octopus) comes in a generous size and has the right chewiness for me.  The other fish egg nigiri aren't bad either.
- Hamachi (yellowtail) isn't necessary the best here, but it's good enough for me.

I would caution against these nigiri:

- Krab. We didn't even order it because it's obviously surimi, or fish protein masquerading as crab.
- Ika (squid) was oddly mushy.
- Tuna wasn't too bad, but it wasn't a standout. Yuzu and garlic tuna were fine though.

I wasn't able to try the unagi (freshwater eel) because they had run out. Also, the nigiri menu lacks such classics as scallop, super white tuna, uni, and amaebi. The lack of the latter two is especially puzzling because the menu is almost a carbon copy of H2O Sushi's San Diego store and because uni and amaebi are also very common items at Vegas AYCE joints. On a side note, those Cali locations have AYCD hot sake and Sapporo, which would also fit nicely in this city.

Appetizers. We didn't get to try the salmon collar, furikake fries, or udon because they had run out. Gyoza and cheese pork cutlet are my re-order candidates. Shrimp tempura didn't have a crispy batter, but the conjoined veggie tempura were fine. Takoyaki, mussels, and spicy tuna crispy rice were good but not the best around (takoyaki questers can skip). Also missing were most of the skewers, i.e. pork belly, chicken, and kurobuta. The shiitake skewer seemed severely undercooked, but nobody else commented on it so I just chalked it up to personal preference.

Worst part about the food: dessert isn't included. I regularly knock places which offer 1 dessert per person, so zero per person? Well, I guess the Dynamite California Roll is sweet enough. Oh, almost forgot: we had rolls, and all were decent enough if you somehow don't enjoy the fish-focused nigiri, but get the Albacore Lovers roll for the fried onion.

Final food-related note: the ordering system is based on the paper system that is commonplace in California and almost nonexistent in Vegas. They provide a preprinted sheet with the entire AYCE menu, and you have to write down what you want rather than simply calling out your order to a server. It's annoying that they lost our first order due to disorganization, but we didn't run into issues with the 3 round limit and found it easier to strategize our meal on paper.

ATMOSPHERE: interior reminded some of us of Gen Korean BBQ, and I just learned that H2O Sushi and Gen are both owned by Octopus Restaurant Group. There was a Gen-esque trendy aesthetic, and the booth felt familiar aside from the lack of a grill.

SERVICE: Wait time was quoted at 45 minutes but ended up being 35 minutes. However, the actual meal took closer to 3 hours. No, we aren't nightmare customers. We ate the food promptly as it arrived (give or take a small window of time for photos) and could've easily finished within an hour and a half tops at a standard AYCE sushi restaurant. The pace did seem reasonable at first but slowed down considerably. They lost our order halfway through round 1 and took a long time to fulfill the remainder of round 1 and whatever we did for round 2.

But again, this BOGO was $17-18 a head w/ tax and tip, and I'd have considerably higher expectations for their regular price service, so we'll see how they fare in the future.

For now, H2O gets a thumbs up. Check it out!",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,8,4,eXvwj4bCFRnXmXrCdp9nFA

Interior: Very nice and spacious. I talked to the oner (I believe) and he stated that they are part of the same company Gen KBBQ is in Henderson, which explains the similar interiors. There are many booths and a bar to watch the sushi chefs make orders.

Food: You order by stating how many orders your party would like on a piece of paper. The server then takes this paper and places the order to be made. AYCE menu is very limited. I was very sad to realize that some of my favorites -- ama-ebi and uni -- were not found on the menu. Quality was average. Not the best I've had, but I could name a few restaurants that are similar in price range that have better quality sushi. Food came out slow and the portions were a lot smaller than anticipated. We had come about an hour of closing and they were out of a few things we wanted to order, though this was not something I would ding them on during their opening week. However, it would have been nice to have a way to inform the customers of what is not available before even placing the order to begin with.

Service: The staff was all very friendly and accommodating. However, it did take a while for my order to come (almost 30 minutes with only 4-5 other tables seated in the entire restaurant) and took just as long to get the check even though we were the last ones in the restaurant. However, I hope they will be able to fix these problems with time. It is opening week, after all.

Though I would give this place another shot, I don't think I would be driving out of my way to eat here. Hopefully by then, things will be running more smoothly.",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,4,1,3,HhSNX2L9Mv4SW8AthW9_2Q

Menu looked very appetizing, especially the lunch deal which was $10. This came with miso soup, California roll (2 pc), rice, edamame, gyoza (1 pc), and your choice of 2 bigger lunch items - California roll, teriyaki chicken, sashimi slices (for an extra $2-3 or so ), etc.

I ordered this so keep that in mind - I haven't had anything else yet.

Well the one positive thing is that lunch special is very much worth it. You get a bang for your buck to say the least. I guess another positive thing is that the food isn't *bad*... but it necessarily isn't good either.  I ordered chicken teriyaki and California roll (full 6 pieces) as my 2 main dishes for the lunch special.

Miso soup was good, but I'm not sure how you can mess that up. 
Rice was good. 
Chicken teriyaki was decent. Definitely have had better teriyaki chicken. 
The California roll was decent, but the California roll the special came with (the default 2 pieces) was very off... tasted off looked off and was off. Seems like an old sushi roll left out. My full California roll, which I ordered as my main lunch selection with the special, actually tasted decent.
Edamame was plain.. usually there's salt on this item. But still good. 

I guess if I could rate my experience with the food itself it'd be 3/5. Not bad, not great, but good value for what you pay for. Not my first choice for lunch but it's not completely off my list. I'm not positive i'll come back to try dinner/other sushi items because the food was so ""meh"" just because I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much for a possibly mediocre experience.

Service was fine. Everyone was nice and attentive, but keep in mind we came at lunch when there weren't too many tables. Either way we always had our waters filled and people seemed very smiley and friendly!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,6,4,3,kAb9L8jMdZVnJ8onzU03vg

The hostess was extremely rude and didn't know how to arrange the dinner parties. Initially we told her we had a party of 6 and she said it was going to be a 1 hour wait so we told her we would be willing to split the party to one group of 4 and one group of 2. She then said it would be an 1.5hr wait even though there were clearly smaller tables open. She then said I don't even know if you'll get a table. We were confused by what she meant... does that mean we would sit at the bar? On the floor!??

It was almost as if she was stalling to avoid having to admit there wasn't enough food. Furthermore, they've ran out of food twice now when I've tried to go, the staples like salmon and unagi and some of the more specialty items like salmon Kama. The AYCE doesn't even include ama ebi and uni. There are way too many other good sushi places here in Las Vegas to have to put up with such a horrible business!

4948004,2018-06-21,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"My first time here and I can't believe I've never been here before til now. The major draw here is the AYCE pricing for $20+ tax. That's the only reason I would come back because it definitely is NOT for the service.

With $20 for an AYCE, dont expect anything mind blowing. While the sushi seemed fresh, especially the ""carpaccio"" style, here are the cons:

- Picture vs. Reality - I did not get a chance to take a picture because I was starving. But to not get what was pictured on the menu was disappointing. I know all about trying to stretch the product. But just like Zero Degrees, what they present on the pictured menu was not what I got. The pictures salmon carpaccio you can tell was cut at an angle, giving the illusion of larger portions. The cut that I actually got showed the chef was not totally caring at all about presentation. Imagine /    / that was on the picture menu. Instead, I received straight cuts which made the salmon look measly on the plate.

 - Service - I get that I came at the shift change from lunch to dinner, but you are still on the clock. Dont sit me at the bar where i requested and then sit at the end of the bar counting the money while forgetting about servicing your guests. If a guest has to ask for something, it means you as a server are not paying attention to me. And you expect me to tip over 20% for service? No thank you.

- I can see why they are giving the macaroon ice cream sandwiches for free... I checked in (and found out that there's a Yelp! Check In promotion and was not informed by the staff). The ice cream sandwich itself was about 3"" in diameter and a good 2"" thick of ice cream. It's only good as a picture, but the matcha ice cream has no taste whatsoever. It was mostly color with no matcha flavor to save its namesake.

- Sushi Chefs hardly conversed with you compared to other local sushi restaurants. That's the point guests want to sit at the bar, to interact with the chef and for guests to see their meal prepared. At least put on an act of wanting to talk with your guest, not having your face down avoiding any kind of guest interaction.

Overall, I would have rated this place 2/5, but the draw of $20 AYCE is enough to get me to come back. Hey. Cheap eats is cheap eats.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,0,3,RrKMmJ8y_02m-Ajyou0mnw

5158548,2018-05-17,1,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"We came here at about 9 PM on a weekday evening because I was craving sushi and I saw their promotion for AYCE $19.99. What enticed me was their carpaccio. 

JD and I prefer to sit at the sushi bar so off we went. Service was attentive and quick on all fronts- both with the chefs, servers and host. This is unlike other places in that you are given a card and small pencil to place your order. The server will come around and pick it up when you're finished. I kind of liked that. There's a lot less room for error. 

The AYCE menu is definitely limited compared to their regular menu and the rolls on the AYCE menu mostly consist of imitation crab meat stuffed in the middle. I absolutely HATE that stuff. If I wanted to eat fake seafood, I wouldn't be eating sushi. That seems to go against the premise of eating raw, fresh fish... There were only a handful of rolls that had shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. I don't eat tempura and I don't care much for spicy tuna either.

Our nigiri was good. The carpaccio wasn't really anything to write home about, other than that it's on there and it's a nice change from other AYCE spots that don't have this. My favorites were the jalapeño yellowtail, the mackerel (which is made in house and was incredible) and the shrimp, which I normally don't care for. This place is more traditional in the sense that they do paint soy sauce on your nigiri in some instances. I don't personally like that but didn't mind in this one instance, although if I come back here again, I will ask them to refrain if possible. 

A random, unexpected standout was the gyoza. It was the nicest, freshest, plumpest gyoza I'd every seen at an AYCE place. A unique filling inside with lots of color from veg was a really really great change. I didn't taste it, but JD told me it was fantastic. I take his word for it. He orders gyoza every single time and every AYCE spot.

Ryan, our chef, was great and we enjoyed conversation. He informed us that the same restaurant group owns Sapporo revolving sushi and a couple of other places both in Vegas and in Cali. 

All in all, the fish was decent. I wasn't blown away by the quality of the fish but it wasn't bad at all either. So it's kind of in this weird, middle area for me. The salmon and tuna nigiri weren't impressive but as aforementioned, there were definitely a few things that were great. Dessert selection of macaron ice cream sandwiches isn't printed on AYCE, but is included (per Ryan). 

A solid 3.5 stars but I'm rounding down because of the obviously limited menu and their roll selection on it.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,1,3,qrsqMmyoVU6ML0227qaTsQ

Mind you their menu didn't consist of a lot of options as well so I roughly felt like I had only 20 options to chose from opposed to the regular 50+ items on another AYCE sushi place. The wait for our food was long. We ordered three rounds, which took our dinning experience two hours. They would mistaken or forget to bring out the food we ordered and we had to remind like 5 of them. It was obvious that no one communicated with one another because when I was missing my miso soup, one person gave me my soup then three other servers came to give me miso soup but I already told them the first guy delivered t already. For BOGO 6 people I was charged $87 on my card and when I seen them process my transaction on my bank statement they charged me $99.

Location: 3 out of 5, far for people in the west side of town.

I went in on a Monday night and waited about 50 mins for a party of 4.  My mom asked for the table being cleaned instead of the table the hostess took us to as it was away from the restrooms. The hostess replied rudely asking us if we wanted to wait another 30 mins.. I didn't know it would take 30 mins to clean and set up a table when it was already cleared off waiting for a wipe down and table settings?  Hmm.. should have taken that as a sign they were a slow working restaurant.  My sister had gone on Friday and warned us they take long to bring out food and to take a picture of what you ordered on the paper as they often forgot to bring out food you've ordered.  Anyways we looked passed the table situation and started our order.  

Before we ordered, waitress told u all the items that were ""sold out"".  My sister had said salmon collar was not available for BOGO, but since we went in on Monday where there was no BOGO w/o a coupon, I'd figure we'd try ordering it. Nope, wasn't available.. along with 3 of the 4 yakitori selection - shiitake mushroom was the only one left.  The Mexican roll, the crunch flakes tasted AND smelled like cardboard. Would have highly avoided anything with crunch flakes if my sisters friend had warned us sooner before we placed our order.  ""DO NOT order ANYTHING with crunch flakes"". We got the message a few minutes too late . 

We were also limited to one carpaccio order per round.  Salmon carpaccio was alright, albacore was not fresh (funky taste), but not as bad as the salmon sushi I ordered later on.  Seared garlic tuna was the best and tasted pretty good (my bf and I usually don't like tuna or spicy tuna). As I mentioned a bit ago, we ordered some salmon sushi and first few sushi I ate seemed okay with a bit of a weird taste, but on my last salmon sushi the taste was just awful and I had to spit it out.  One more salmon sushi left on the plate and my brave boyfriend ate it even though my sister pointed out the browning spot on the edge of the sushi.  
Broiled mussels tasted great though, we ordered two.  Ordered two takoyaki and they came out cold on the outside and like warm on the inside or soggy and cold. I think they were pre-made and were left to sit around until someone ordered it.  
Tatsuta Aged Chicken was bland and not crispy like other places that serve fried chicken.. also ordered the tempura, the taste was there, but weird combination of vegetables (white onion). What I don't like is that you can't pick just shrimp or certain vegetables you like for the tempura. Strict no substitution rule. A few more downsides is that hot tea is not included in AYCE and there is no dessert, not even a simple fortune cookie at the end of your meal. Also no half orders on rolls!

Ordered dragon roll which never came out, the person who came to clear some of the dishes away had touched my moms chopsticks while she was away with his hands and didn't offer a new pair.  Waters were not filled unless asked and it was not that busy when we eventually started our meal.

Overall I would not return to try this place again, my stomach started to cramp on the car ride home and when I woke up.. let's just say my body did not like what it had digested.",qIJ2iA9JwRYZD0akh1nyRA,4,1,2,YFbcTYq5v1uN4TVPQ_0L2w

Food: acceptable for AYCE, but not much serendipity. The menu consists mostly of sushi and specialty rolls, with a few side dishes (AYCE menu available on their website). 

A few dishes I can remember: 
- Salmon carpaccio (4/5): with refreshing Yuzu sauce. I like the thickness of the cut - goes well with the seasoning.
- Broiled mussels (4/5): juicy with a touch of pleasant sweetness.
- Spider roll (3.5/5): the soft shell crab was freshly fried, thus very crunchy.
- Albacore carpaccio (3/5): ordered both spicy and non-spicy ones, but they taste very similar (or probably we were given the same ones?). Texture of albacore is quite firm, so I feel it should not be cut too thick for carpaccio.
- Dynamic California roll (3/5): an upgraded California roll covered in some teriyaki-mayo mixture, with broiled onion and scallops. Not bad at first bite, but gives the greasy feeling afterwards.
- Vegas roll (3/5): I like the eel tempura on the top, but basically the taste of spicy tuna dominated whatever else in the roll.
- Takoyaki (2.5/5): freshly made, which was good. Apart from that, hmm...
- Cheese pork cutlet (2/5): overdone, and no taste of cheese at all.
- Shrimp and veggie tempura (1.5/5): not well fried. Also, the sweet sauce did not really fit tempura.
- Spicy tuna crispy rice (1/5): the ""crispy"" rice was just not crispy and hard to chew.

Service: friendly and responsive staff. Service gets noticeably slower after we ordered the 2nd round, probably because there were more customers. Overall experience was pleasant.

We were staying at the Tuscany Hotel and Casino across the street, so this was a very practical option for us to walk to. The lunch price is quite a bit higher than what I'd pay in my hometown of Denver, CO, but that's going to be true of any restaurant within walking distance of the strip.

The décor is very clean and modern - it almost felt like a dance club.  I especially liked the chandelier made of chains suspended from the ceiling.  

Service was exceptionally friendly - the host, our server, and the manager all took turns greeting and checking in with us.  Some of the food was slow to come out but we had a big order and they did a great job of quickly clearing empty plates and bringing out something else from our list right away.  

What most impressed me was the menu selection and the quality of the food.  Most AYCE places focus on a few select specialty rolls and nigiri with a few appetizers or other entrees, but H2O had a MASSIVE 2 page menu of items to choose from including items I've never seen on a AYCE menu like tartare. The meat portions were very generous and we enjoyed everything we tried.  My only gripe is that the special rolls are so big that you can only try one or two before you fill up.

They provide you with a paper and you check the items you would like, they take the paper and place your order, then they give you the paper back to check ore items. Well, unfortunately we received the wrong sushi orders because they got our paper mixed with another tables paper. I told the waiter that she had given us the wrong paper and she took the paper & simply, walked away. We waited for about 45 minutes for someone to come back and give us some attention. Meanwhile servers are bringing food to our table and we're rejecting the food because it wasn't our food. Then a gentleman finally comes around and asks if we're waiting for something else, mind you, our table is empty with no food for about 45 minutes. We tell him we never got back our checklist to order more food, since they misplaced our first one, and he comes back WITH THE SAME CHECKLIST FROM THE FIRST PLACE, I told him that wasn't our list and comes back and says yes it is. When clearly it wasn't since that paper was all checked off and we only checked a few items. Overall, I was very unpleased with our server lady that was attending us at first, who didn't come back at all to let us know what was going on and kept ignoring us.",mCQO3kCU9ZDuPs3WHQpZiA,0,0,1,Tlq9X417x7BBrlK--9Lsfw

The place was sit in a moden building,its decor in white and bright light interior as a big dinning hall.When we entered,there were about 12 people crowed by the door in front of hostess stand.Two parties in front of us.When our turn,one of two hostesses got on her cell phone and started looked away,the other one just walked away. After few minutes,she noticed my stare and gestured with her index finger,few more minutes later, she ended her phone and got our name,said about 30 minutes wait.While waiting,saw a waiter with sweaty forehead rushed into the preparation counter and set up 6 water glasses,then grabbed handful of unpacked staws and put them into the glasses,I got the goosebumps ,and wondering where his bare hands had been before that.30 minutes later, a couple came in and got seated right the way,my usual patient husband approached the hostess and asked why that couple skip the waiting,she said because they are employee's family.That was unheard of,as worker's relatives were more prioritized than paying customers.I went ahead ask the hostess about our wait would possibilly be another 30 minutes,she said"" May be ! It depends on how long the seated people will finish their food.""My husband reached my hand and urged me to leave.When getting in our car,I told him to make sure I don't come back this dirty,unprofessional place unless he want to divorce me.What a joke!!Do they even see  the competitions around them?!!",HfxvAYl6FQosGca0kH3mew,0,0,1,UKJc_zsOH4cb21zQuDAW8A

Only order 1 or 2 rolls at a time. The dishes, including the small plates, are huge, so we had a serious problem finishing what we ordered. Some fish did have a bit of a slimy look or a strange, sour taste.

After we ate, we were extremely gassy. Like, embarrassing, good thing we're married and not a first date, type issue. The next day my belly was swollen. Like, pregnant-looking swollen where your skin is taut. My intestines were gurgling all day and I felt nauseous and sweaty. That night I was dizzy and disoriented and nearly passed out vomiting. This afternoon (2 days later) I'm still chained to the bathroom.

Either this restaurant is serving bad fish or, they're serving escolar under a different name, which is a white fish that is banned in some countries due to the fact it causes extreme intestinal issues in humans. Will not be back.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,0,1,qnffLWfC7aaOGekPC6jb9g

Really enjoyed their sashimi selection and their salmon nigiri tasted amazing.

The service was fast and friendly no complaints there. The karage chicken was very good and the takoyaki was the best I've tried at an ayce place. Disappointed that they had no salmon collar but it's opening weekend so I'll give them a pass for that.  The carpaccio were good but not great and they didn't have uni, super white or fresh sweet ameabi.  The saba, salmon and unagi was very good.  So overall for the price for dinner I would go somewhere else for lunch price I would give it a try but there are better places out there.

5844395,2018-06-17,0,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"A restaurant with a beautiful contemporary look; that's the end of the positives. It allowed me to feel comfortable while dining in disappointment. I did not know what I was expecting when I saw that the restaurant was empty at 8:30 PM, perhaps it is simply a slow late night. But after eating the low quality food here and receiving the terrible service, I understood the lack of guests. 

Why is the service terrible? My group of friends and I were the biggest group (7 people) in the restaurant and there may have been one or two other smaller parties in the restaurant. One would expect that our food would be ready shortly and the waiters/waitresses would attend to us since it's not busy. Sadly, expectations never align with reality. Each time we ordered took at least 15 minutes for anything to come out. It's understandable that maybe it is a lot to come out at once but after 15 minutes one small plate of sushi would come out and then it'd be another 5 more minutes before the next small thing came out. My friends and I had a good laugh at the one yakitori chicken that came out 25 minutes after we ordered for the third round of orders. Yes, it was a good 25 minutes for a small chicken skewer to come out, hard to believe right? Typically, you should exceed expectations in a good way, not a bad way. Aside from the long waits for and between each order, they kept forgetting to bring out our food. For example, in our first round of orders we had 5 orders of the salmon, only one of them came out and we had to keep asking for when the other 4 would come. It happened again on our second round of orders when we ordered 2 furikake French fries. Only one of fries came out and once again we had to ask a couple times before they went to check with the kitchen to find out where our food was. Furthermore, the servers never checked up on us to ask how the food was or to take out orders. We had to wave them down each time to come. Let me emphasize that the restaurant was practically vacant except for our group. One of my friends noticed that the some chefs were just on their phone (probably why our food took so long to come out). Now that was just the service.

The food was pitiful especially when compared to sushi places such as Jjanga, Sushi Neko, Goyemon, Kabuto, SOHO etc. We simply wanted to try a place we have never been to before and it was nearby and boy was that a mistake. The rolls we ordered like albacore, spicy tuna tasted dry and flavorless. The salmon eggs and smelt eggs were abnormally salty. The only items I enjoyed here happened to be furikake french fries and shiitake mushrooms... which both happen to be non-fish items. Pretty ironic for a so-called sushi place if you ask me. One of my friends kept finding bones in his rolls and while it may be expected, it would have been avoidable had the chefs been more careful or attentive. Another one of friends found hair in her ice cream... yummy? I hope that is not what this establishment finds tasty. All around, the staff was inattentive, the food was poor quality and the guests who come here will not come again. 

Tl;dr: Do not eat here unless you like bad sushi and bad service.",ncSwgZ78EiwvSpkWNdbmzQ,6,0,1,W7O4m40dKe25Iep0iJPpbA

The first time we came for lunch. Babe got a bento box (which is pretty dang good for the lunch size/price) and I got some sushi and carpaccio. 

The second time we came for dinner. Had all you can eat for the special price of $19.95 (regularly $about 25) and tried out the half off drink specials. The quality of the fish was up there and the drink even better!

The third time we came after a gym session and had their lunch all you can eat special. Was pretty slow for lunch. But again, high quality fish was served.

5918756,2017-10-22,7,5JNvfPfd6mcpwNoekzqBow,"One of my foodie friends suggested organizing a group diner at H2O for AYCE sushi on FB Messenger, but I wasn't sure if they ended up going or not. Then a different foodie friend asked if I was free for lunch tomorrow (Oct 15), and I said sure without knowing where we were going or who else was going. That's the shortened version of how I caught the last day of H2O Sushi & Izakaya's grand opening promotion of BYGO AYCE dinner promo at this beautiful and Las Vegas' very newest sushi restaurant that opened right next to Bandito Latin Kitchen & Cantina in the Howard Hughes Center (near the new Claim Jumper location).

Upon arrival, you instantly noticed the modern glass and metal exterior of the restaurant below their name. A few people were waiting outside (weather was very pleasant and not too sunny), but a lot more were waiting just inside the restaurant for their turn to be seated. And I was told by one of my friends that arrived ahead of me that the wait is expected to be about 40 minutes. Not too bad, but the long wait is starting to feel like SoCal dining scene.

The interior of the restaurant is large, with decor and design that immediately reminded me of the Gen KBBQ that opened in Henderson. They have the same freezer with the macaroon ice cream sandwiches at Gen. Even their menu layout and design looks strikingly similar to those of Gen. My friend messaged me afterwards that H2O and Gen are indeed owned by the same corporate owner.

So the social media campaign for H2O's grand opening was a huge success.  Definitely a lot of people showed up.  Even before we were able to order or first round of food from the slip of paper (seems to be the way most Cali Japanese AYCE restaurants handle orders), we already noticed a few blue markers marked on the paper (which are the items that are sold out already in the afternoon), so no unagi (fresh water eel), pork belly and kurobuta sausage yakitori, Tatsuta Age Chicken (fried chicken), Furikake French Fries and Udon noodles, and Spider Rolls.  And just so you know, there are no uni (sea urchin) or amaebi (sweet shrimp) on the menu at all!  Not limited to one order per person, like many of their peers in LV.  

So knowing that the restaurant will very likely struggle with the amount of orders the kitchen will be receiving, we opted to order most of what we expected to eat in the first round.  The food did take noticeably longer to come out, and eventually not everything we ordered came out since the paper got lost.  It is grand opening weekend. And stuff like this happens regularly even in established restaurants, so I am not going to freak out and rate them two stars.  Plus, they did come back and asked us what was still missing from the first round of our orders and eventually those items were delivered to our table.

We ordered all 4 carpaccio options to share.  Our favorite was definitely the Salmon Carpaccio.  Next I thought the Seared Garlic Tuna Carpaccio was very good.

We also ordered all the nigiri sushi, except Spicy Albacore (having it served as carpaccio already, and Krab (imitation crab) and Fresh Water Eel (sold out, otherwise we would definitely ordered it).  Again the Salmon was by far the best, which we ordered again in the second round.  The Shrimp, not the typical pre-cooked and prep thin flat ones that can and are often ordered by most other sushi restaurants, was a surprising stand out (I hope they don't go cheap and switch down the road).  Also terrific were Jalapeno Yellowtail, Seared Garlic Tuna, Octopus, the Salmon Egg. And the fish to rice ratio is definitely customer friendly. So no ordering miso soup and getting rid of extra rice that way!  If I know of this trick, you can bet the restaurant does too.

For the specialty rolls, we ordered H20 Special Roll and Rose Roll, but was also served the Albacore Lover Roll by mistake (we ate it without questioning if we had ordered it) and it was actually one of my favorite item from their menu.  The garnish of lightly fried crispy tempura-battered onions was the best.  I even tried to order that on its own as an appetizer, but sadly that request was shutdown by the kitchen.  So if you order just one specialty roll, I highly recommend that you go with Albacore Lover.

We also ordered Ultimate Salmon Roll in our second roll, but I can tell that the restaurant must be running low on their fantastic Salmon by then, as the amount of Salmon served on top of the roll was anything but ""ultimate"". It was still good, just not as aesthetically pleasing as the one pictured on their menu.

What else can I add to the review?  Just more facts, I suppose.

Premium AYCE price per person:
$19.95 for weekday lunch (excludes holidays) until 3pm
$25.95 for dinner
Kids under age 13 for $13.95
They also have items in their a la carte menu that is not available for AYCE, which does look worth a try in future visits.

18% gratuity will automatically be charged for party of 6 or more.
