I ordered a several items which were fine but then sushi roll, and a bug literally walked casually off my plate onto my napkin. I showed it to the bartender and the bartender said  ""that is just a fruit fly. It goes after sweet food"". Really?!   This time I got a whole new order sushi, and I took it to go. She said she was gonna tell a manager And the bartender said to me we went ahead and took it off of your bill As if they were doing me a favor. Never apologized. Then waited over 20 minutes for my replacement. Too long. I have visited over a dozen P F Chang's  around the country. This one is too reliant on traffic and people could literally fall from the casino into the restaurant. So I don't think they care about service or professionalism given they have so much easy traffic. May need to retrain some staff.",YVrvGfCpK6kMgv597BlNlg,1,0,2,o0ykAUcDO6kdznpLZ5UW3A

Valet parking at Miracle Mile & a quick walk through the mall makes for easy access. Located inside Planet Hollywood it's a bit hidden inside the casino if you're not entering on foot from The Strip. Running the perimeter of the casino, it's located next to the PH Rewards desk. 

Huge bar & seating area. Looks like there's an upstairs section as well. Our server was attentive & very nice. Our iced teas stayed filled without being asked. Absolutely no complaints. Our lunch, shrimp potstickers & combo fried rice, was plenty for two. It was an enjoyable weekday lunch. 

If only I could remember our servers name!!  We inadvertently left our credit card behind and he chased us through the casino to return it to us. Now that's service & honesty.

Oh the food!!  *facepalm* -_- Seriously fire the chef.  I know it gets busy but the flavor and the food should not have to suffer.  The first thing we had were the lettuce chicken cups for an appetizer.  This was ok but very greasy. 

My dish was the shrimp and vietnamese noodles.  The bowl came out looking the opposite of the picture in the menu.  The noodle were gray and way too much of them.  The shrimp and some type of meat protein were kind of hidden under the mound of noodles and were sparse and overcooked.  There was no flavor to this dish at all.  Bleh!

My friend ordered orange chicken and rice.  I had a bite.  Still no flavor.  Even the rice was bland which is weird because Asians flavor their rice with salt at least.  Whomever is heading the kitchen obviously does not care about p.f. Chang's cooking reputation or the food in general.  

This experience was sad because #1. here is Las Vegas it is so very hard to find good Asian fusion food in general, and #2. It was my very first time at p.f. Chang's and sadly the last.  I will never eat here again.",eIuITpqIeMcLgMxo3KPZng,0,0,4,qrZLc8J15B_rMCE23ZRUVw

After browsing the menu, my friend and I discovered that it would be advantageous for us to order the P.F. Chang's For Two, because it included everything that we wanted to order and would be cheaper than ordering everything separately. Our server interrupted me while ordering and stated that it was too much food for us (unaware that we were going to order that much food anyway) and tried to discourage us from ordering that. The entrées come with white or brown rice, but we asked if we could pay an upcharge to get fried rice, which has never been a problem at other locations. Initially, our server said that we could do that, but then later said that we'd have to order an entire side or entrée of fried rice. Maybe this is the restaurant's policy, so no fault to the server there, but it is a terrible policy and they should rethink that. We settled for brown rice, but we were given white rice because they were supposedly out of brown rice. Number one, you don't give someone something that they didn't order just because you ran out and assume that they'll be okay with it. Number two, this would have been a good opportunity to offer us fried rice as a substitute since that's what we really wanted. We also asked for extra crispy noodles for our soup. The soup comes out with no crispy noodles at all, so we had to ask for those. In the meantime our soup gets cold. Drink refills were slow. Both of our drinks emptied several times. Often he walked past our table with a pitcher of water, but didn't stop to refill our glasses. One time he refilled my glass, but not my friend's glass, even though they were both empty. The only positive thing that I can say is that he is honest, because I had more money on my gift card than I thought I did, and he returned the unnecessary cash that I gave him. I will not be recommending P.F. Chang's to any of my friends that are visiting the Las Vegas Strip. The only reason that I'm giving three stars is because the appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and entrées (crispy honey chicken and Mongolian beef) were delicious.

We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready.  Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view.

We got a great booth and the service was awesome.  I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table.  We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles.  Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried.  What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy.  The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far.  Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service.  You can't beat that!  Oops, wait.  My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking.  I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle.  Next time I will try something less fried.

I eat at Chinese restaurants regularly in the Bay Area and I'm not a fan of non-authentic Chinese food but I thought we'd try ordering take-out and bringing it up to our room at PH. I do have to say their take-out counter is very convenient and is located next to the entrance.

We ordered the shaking beef which was too salty.  I'm a fan of salt but this dish had way too much.  The Dan Dan Noodles were ok. It was a little mushy and lacking flavor. I've had Dan Dan noodles at a lot of other places but this one tasted different. Cheesecake was good but tell them to put the raspberry sauce on the side, it tastes gross.

Overall, if you 're looking for some take-out, staying at PH, hungry for Chinese, and have enough points on your Total Rewards players card so you don't have to pay for your meal then order here and try different dishes.  P.F Chang's is just too overpriced and their food is just ok. Total price for shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles and cheesecake was $37. We could have eaten at Gordon Ramsey's BurGr again for the same price and had a good meal but were too lazy to sit down and eat at a restaurant in addition to BurGr being super busy.
I suggest going to the Rio and eating at KJ Seafood and Dim Sum if you feel like Chinese. They have much better food!",RtaPfDS-kqNJYN_uPtgfQA,2,1,2,AicZY4MHdn9pry2fZQrhrQ

This is one of those places where when they say they close at midnight what they mean is they take orders up until midnight. (My hours are reversed and so often getting somewhere for dinner at or just before midnight is a pretty frequent thing, and for that, this place has been good.)
Until tonight.
This was one of those situations where they had an opportunity to shine and instead completely failed to do anything other than the absolute bare minimum - my two friends and I came out here for my birthday dinner, and frustratingly got locked up in traffic in front of the LINQ for literally more than half an hour, and ended up walking into PF Chang's at 12:05.
I explained and said we knew exactly what we wanted, and could order immediately (which would more than make up for the 5 mins too late we were), and they said no. The host said maybe they could do takeout, which we said is at least something, and then he came back and said no.
Didn't care if it was for my birthday or not, no effort to go ask someone like a manager or explain to the kitchen or anything like that.
Fail.

Our reservation was for 8:00p and I'm not going to lie, I am notorious for being late. By some birthday miracle, I made it to the place about two minutes after 8. I know, late is late, but when my boyfriend made the reservation they told him that ours would be given away if we were 10-15 minutes late...a little confusing, but whatever. We got our table just fine. Food and drinks were good as well. 

Our waitress was nice, but she seemed aloof - which is not something I would hold against someone. What I did have a problem with is her whisking my food away that was barely touched. We were sitting in a U-shaped booth and I was turned to face the group to talk. I wasn't watching over my food(I didn't think I had to) and I had a couple of drinks, so I was definitely very into whatever I was talking about. I could understand that maybe she didn't want to interrupt me...personally, I would have preferred her doing that instead of just taking the food away without checking. My other friends weren't talking, so she could have asked them about it and they would have asked me. We spent $200 that night. That's a fortune to me and to leave with no leftovers when there was plenty....well, I consider THAT a dinner time atrocity. I know I should have said something then, but everyone was leaving so I didn't. I really should have because it's been bothering me! 9/10 times, I always eat my leftovers the next day. Wasting food is a huge pet peeve of mine...and in this situation it severely irks me because it was food that I was going to eat. Maybe a good solution would be to re-train that server and make sure all of the servers are on the same page.

Service isn't usually something that bothers me that much, I feel like the ambiance and the food are the most important factors. In this case, I just couldn't ignore the service (or lack there of). To begin, we had a reservation and still had to wait for a table (understandable, but still). 

We are finally seated, given menus, and order our drinks and the lettuce wraps since we know already we are going to want that. At this point we hadn't ordered our main dishes yet. 

So we browse the menu, and decide what we will have as main dish. Our waiter however, is no where to be seen. In fact, we couldn't even flag down another server to call our server. We wait and wait and wait, and he finally appears with our drinks. We order our main dishes, and one of the girls in our group asks for sugar. He leaves, and nothing. No sugar. 

He comes back a long time later with our lettuce wraps and when my friend asks again for the sugar he says coldly ""It is already on its way- I asked for it already."" Woah there, way to be friendly! He also explains they only have one kitchen for two floors and that is why the food is taking so long. I'm sorry, that is not an excuse in my book. There are way bigger restaurants in New York City that are able to accommodate a big space with a full house. 

Our food finally arrives, and our friend the waiter once again makes a snide remark when one of us ask for something. I understand you might be having a bad day, maybe lost your paycheck at the Blackjack table, but don't bring your problems to work, buddy! 

The food itself was really good, we had Singapore Noodles which I kept serving myself more and more of. We also had the orange beef which was good but not my favorite, was slightly chewy. The black bean chicken was fantastic-- delicious! And of course you cannot go wrong with the lettuce wraps though we made a huge mess. 

At the end, my lovely girlfriends had asked the waiter to bring out a Birthday Cake and even gave them candles they had previously purchased. Our dear friend walks out with the slice of cake with the candles, and proceeds to light the candles in front of our table and just drops it in front of us. The cake was pretty good, chocolate cake is my absolute fav, but the raspberry sauce was a bit too overpowering for me.

We ordered hot N sour soup - good
Fried Rice with Shrimp - very tasty with lots of shrmip 
Chendung Lamb - spiced and fried - very tasty and melts in your mouth.

Also, Sarah told us that they've started taking the soy sauce off the tables and do it on request only... good to know! They also didn't do the pre-sauce mixture table side anymore.

The ambiance is casual and relaxed, decor and menu are Chinese and Asian influenced with an expected range of dishes. Have visited P.F. Chang's in many cities. This location in particular has a lot to learn and improve. Menu is the same but dishes are not cooked in the same way.
During our meal, we found food to be mixed. Chang Spicy Chicken was served with sweet chili sauce which is more usually featured in Thai cuisine but that was ok, the dish tasted not bad.  Kung Pao Chicken, which is a Sichuan style dish, was also pretty good. Chicken coating was interesting but we enjoyed the flavors of this dish. 
The Orange Peel Beef was a bad serving. Dish was served luke-warm and with a thick sauce that tasted odd. Orange peels didn't complement the beef or heavy sauce well. This dish didn't make a lot of sense taste wise. We'd skip this one next time for sure. Dishes are Chinese and Asian inspired instead of authentic but that is ok.

They also give you the choice between brown rice and white rice. I bet that excites you huh?

One of my friends wanted to know why it wasn't vegan so i asked and she replied with ""because of the sugar."" i looked at her confused and asked what she meant because sugar comes from sugar cane, a plant. she responded with a very condescending attitude as if i were stupid and said that the sugar came from animal bone. (Later on I looked up on my phone what she was talking about and they actually do use ingredients that are derived from bone char... gross) By this point i got really frustrated and changed my order to the buddha's feast which was truly vegan. The wait for our food was ridiculously long and i am not exaggerating because i had been drinking. My friends can also confirm that it took forever to receive our food. We were actually in a hurry to meet up with a friend to get into a club. Once the food arrived it was alright but it was literally steamed vegetables with small slices of tofu mixed in.

PF Chang's as you likely know is a large semi upscale Chinese chain. Some people just don't like chains. I personally have no issues with chains that have consistently good food and service. To me, PF Chang's fits the category of good and consistent. Is it the best ever?  Probably not. But I find it reliable and quite tasty. 

I love their crab Rangoon. Way better than most local Chinese places as PF Chang's actually uses more crab than cream cheese. I also like their version of shrimp with lobster sauce as well as salt and pepper prawns. The Chang's spicy chicken and sesame chicken is also always a hit with the family. My two daughters love their dumplings. 

Having the choice of white or brown rice is always nice. And if you want to try their fried rice the combination fried rice is pretty darn good. 

Yes, PF Chang's cost more than your typical local joint, but sometimes if you don't have a good referral, you are taking a chance with a local place. For consistency sake and the high quality, PF Chang's is tough to beat.",jhT9r_NBORDB2Fa5mBXWTA,0,1,4,fD4N4FBHcK2AXanWxwP7Lw

The Singapore street noodles and chicken lo mien was also very good and the lo mien was the clear winner.  The fact that this is a chain restaurant, really surprised me.

We went at 8pm on a Wednesday and was told that there was a 45 minute wait and so we happily took our buzzer and went and sat in the Planet Hollywood's Extra bar. Their drinks were fabulous and 30 minutes later, the buzzer was going off. We were seated on the top floor in the back and so it was nice and quiet, despite the 2 long tables of people in front of our booth.

They have a 2-For-$40 deal that provides you with your choice of soup, one appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 mini desserts. Waaaayyyy too much food for 2 people but it allowed us to try all kinds of dishes. 

I started with a wine flight, that gives you 3 - 2.5 oz glasses of wine for $10. $10!!! Definitely took advantage of that as they have an extensive wine list. The bf had a beer as they were $3 and cheaper than anything you can buy on the strip. Bonus!

For our soup course, we both had the Sweet and Sour and it was full of chicken, mushrooms, tofu, and egg ribbons. It was kinda spicy but a nice way to start the meal. Portions are huge and so I felt bad about only eating half but otherwise wouldn't have been able to get past the appetizer flight.

For the appetizer, we had the Chicken Wraps. I had heard nothing but about how good these wraps are since we found the restaurant the night before. They lived up to their reputation though as everything from the lettuce to the little sauce that was customized for us, was wonderful. Again, the dish wasn't finished as you would have to stuff the lettuce leaves to capacity to get through all of the filling they provide you with.

For entrees, we had the Mongolian Beef and Cantonese Shrimp. The beef was accompanied by long pieces of green onion and wasn't too gingery. The meat was nicely seared so the marinade formed a crunchy outside. Delish! The shrimp were in a light garlic sauce and the snow peas were perfectly cooked. We had brown rice on the side and there was definitely enough food for 4 people. Yikes but yummmm!

For dessert, our fabulous waiter brought out a litle sample tray and explained each shot-glass sized dessert to us. We chose the Strawberry Cheesecake and S'more and while I was too full to try them, they were gone in about 30 seconds. The perfect end to a meal!

If you get this deal, either expect to have multiple leftovers or make sure you have a large party to help share the feast!",B393RKS1yuQdkiynXKa1iQ,1,0,4,vLyJwvu8e7r42xDB-lTEGQ

This is my first visit to the las vegas location and I was a little disappointed in the service and the food. So to start off we are waiting to be seated the hostess trys to stop one of the waitress to seat us and she mumbles something back in the lines of she is busy so the hostess starts to seat us and another waiter jumped in and seated us. It took about 10 mins before waitress came and took our drink and food order. We get our soup and i ask for the won ton strips takes almost 10 mins for that and us to get straws that we didnt get when we got our drinks. The servers says sorry about the wait on the strips were busy....now my husbamd and i look around and wonder how are they busy? Yjere was not a lot of people in the resturant at the time, maybe 7-10 at the most. After the soup and lettuce wrap which is hands down my favorite thing the resturant serves this dish is amazing the balance between the chicken and water chesnuts is perfect.  My husband got the shrimp fried rice which he enjoyed but he said it could of had a feew more shrimp in it bit overall grest dish. I ordered the pepper steak it was a little on the salty side and not hot like it just came off the stove asaid from that it was good. The desert was a fav of mine i order it from where ever serves it tiramisu, the portion wad small for it to be a shareable dessert we did the changs for 2 for 44.95 so its a good thing my husband does not eat dessert.  It took forever after i ordered it for it to come, my biggest complaint was the slow service, she told us 2 different times our food was on its way out and it never came til 15 mins after the first time she told us.

I guess it's because they will get tourists no matter if they're good or bad being on the strip. That is disappointing--I will highly recommend you go somewhere else. You have so many good restaurants in Las Vegas. Even Panda Express if you want Chinese-ish food down the street. If you have access to a car, head over to Chinatown for some good authentic food.

A few unforgiveables here--my tea was lukewarm. That's awful for any restaurant. No one served our soup--another thing that servers do even in the ghetto-ist of Chinese restaurants.... Our server was kind of a ditz as well.

PF Changs is a massive chain and I've been to them once or twice, I have never eaten anything I thought was great.  But a group of people wanted to go and I was powerless to persuade them to try real Vegas cuisine...

Everything is family style which is cool, and it's fun to poke,and grab little bites from this bowl or that.  We had a variety of items, noodles, chicken, veggies.  Everything was pretty fine.

The spicy green beans were quite good.

Our server was really nice and polite and did a fantastic job taking care of us, I'm sorry I can't recall his name.  Five stars for him and his service.

All in all, the food did the trick, it stopped the hangry in the group, and we moved on, no one mentioning it again.  I feel like that happens a lot when you go to PF Changs.  Eat, move on.

My boyfriend and I were in town while my parents were also there. On some level I guess you could call them high rollers. That's different than being a baller. A baller would drop bills at a really fancy place. Not my parents, although they're not cheap either. Oh, and my grandmother was in Vegas too. She's cool, but simple. Nothing too flashy.

That's where P.F. Chang's comes into the picture.  It's a nice balance of fancy decor and unscale-ish food.  This is a big restaurant with a second floor.  That's where we sat and it was nice to be above the din of the casino.

The prix fixe menu is awesome. That's what Tyler and I chose. Two people get 4 courses for $45.  It turned into a lot of food and everything came out just as it should have (hot and well timed).

Chicken lettuce wrap

The containers here are even different (my food seeped out and spilled everywhere on my garments)..

The food was okay, not the best, but I do have to consider that every chef is different even though the menu's are fairly the same.

The guy waiters were cool, but the women waiters portrayed that they are real catty. (i vicariously, listened to another customer experience, who was having a hard time, because she just gave birth and felt self-concisous of her weight, and the waitress wome were all over her husband like flies on shit. it was disgusting, women shouldn't act thirsty, especially at work.

The vip room is awesome! You pay a higher percent for tip but they have good deals for big groups.

We craved it for the whole year and made sure when in Vegas, we returned. 
We checked the balance of our reward cards and we were both able to get our meals at half off. You just tell the server how much cash you have on your card and they deduct it from the bill. To know that, you just visit the rewards desk inside the casino and ask, showing your card and ID.
I went for the orange peel shrimp and it did not disappoint. Tangy and delicious.
Service was fine.
Try and get a seat like we did on the upper level that gives a great view of all the beautiful people/drunks/crazies going by on the Strip. Last year, some alcohol-fueled idiot climbed atop the white huge horse statue out front and - you guessed it, he fell off. And his 'friends' left him there in a heap.

Let me start from the beginning...I am a vegetarian and this menu is only for those who like tofu! I can tolerate tofu but, don't prefer it as a main source of meat replacement. Do the main chefs at PF Chang's not care about the vegetarian or vegan consumers or think we all love tofu?? I have news for them that this is not the case and the options on their menu suck!! 
When I did ask my ever so pleasant waitress about a vegetarian dish her response was about the same as I received upon her arrival to my table...a roll of the eyes and a "" I don't like tofu"". 
So, instead of helping me when I asked her what the dish was like I received her personal opinion. I ended up with the vegetarian lettuce wraps. I was informed we can't make the sauce at the table anymore so I ended up with a bland runny wrap sauce for my wraps!! Thank you again PF Chang's! So as I sit here I contemplate the rating to give and usually give 5 stars to those who deserve it yet, in this case I feel two is fair.

The lettuce wraps have a delicious filling, but they'd be better on romaine (not iceburg). The ma po tofu is a really big portion of both broccoli and spicyish orange sauce on crispy tofu; it's good but kind of heavy to attack by oneself.

After being grumbly about the situation, I actually REALLy enjoyed my meal.  I had just recently eaten at another PF Changs, but this experience was much better.  

Because we had two couples we each ordered the meals for two and shared everything.  I had the egg drop soup and it was REALLY good.  I also had a taste of the wonton soup.  Also good, but I do love egg drop soup!  We had these yummy pan fried pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps to start and then we all shared the Pepper Steak, Crispy Honey Chicken, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Mongolian beef.  My cousin also added a noodle dish.  OH MY GOSH!  Way too much food!  But it all tasted really good and we really enjoyed the meal.  There were two boxes of food to take home afterwards.

The service was timely and attentive, even thought the restaurant was quite busy.  We had a reservation, so there was no wait to be seated.  

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone looking for Asian food at the Planet Hollywood.  It's a chain, but it is good, I admit it!

The hangover cure food I usually like to order: 
Chang's vegetarian lettuce wraps, made with tofu: so yummy, no matter how hangover I am, I still need veggies ;p 

Hot & Sour soup, chicken, tofu, bamboo shoots, egg & mushrooms, balanced with hot white pepper and vinegar: this is a MUST for hangover! Always makes me much better.... Very delicious

Pepper steak, marinated flank steak tossed with yellow onion, red & green peppers in a garlic and black pepper sauce: hubby's favorite

Hunan-style hot fish, Crispy slices of tilapia in a tangy, spicy sauce with stir- fried vegetables: Spicy spicy spicy, only way for bad hangover! 

I like all those dishes with Taingtao beer, service is always good. Funny I like Americanized Chinese food much better than authentic Chinese food, I like salty sometime for some reasons, but never greasy and oily, P.F.Chang food is salty without greasy, just what I need & love sometime! ;p",-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,8,7,4,bj_shgOZWnGbQZZNK3Pjnw

Placed an order at their take out window and sat down at the last seat on the end of the bar, which was three deep. As crowded as it was, the bartender noticed little ol' me and asked me if I needed anything. When I said I was just waiting for a to-go order, instead of asking me to give my seat up, he gave me a free coke. 

Got my food (spring rolls, sesame chicken and dan dan noodles) and took it back to my room. It was fresh, perfectly seasoned and just what the hangover doctor ordered. I thought all chain restaurants were basically the same, but this location had, but far, the best food I've ever had from a PF Chang's, and i've been to about five of them all over California.

If you want really shitty PF Chang's, buried in salt with stale or undercooked rice, served by unapologetic waiters who bring you more of the same when you try to send you dish back, I recommend the one in downtown San Jose.

Now, I KNOW PF Chang's is about ""fusion"" (read - fake) Chinese/Asian food, and I KNOW they're a chain, but they have tasty (albeit really salty) food, at reasonable prices - even on the Vegas Strip.

During our four-day stay, we dined here twice - once late night for some noodles and egg rolls; and the second for happy hour (3:30pm to 6:30pm).  The first experience, when we sat in the dining room on the main floor, was OK, but the second time, when we sat at the upstairs (YES, THERE'S AN UPSTAIRS BAR) with bartender Brandon, our server, was even better.

Without a doubt, Brandon was the most sincere and professional service person we've met up on our Vegas trip.  Everywhere you go on the Strip, from the baristas at Starbucks to the guys hustling shows on the overpasses to the check-in clerks at your hotels - people are wanting something from you (ie. Tips) and you get fake, effusive service as a result.  Not Brandon.  He was swamped with drinks, being the only bartender for the entire two-floor restaurant, but kept his humor and gave us great service.  We had HH chicken lettuce wraps (always great), northern style spareribs (just ok), and egg rolls (just ok), as well as the Organic Agave Margaritas, which were great.  (And cheaper during HH!)

We waited, waited, and waited some more. We ended up waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes! The hostess was rude when we went up to check on it. She made us feel bad for asking. When we were finally taken to our seats we had to wait a while for our waiter. I'm getting used to all of this waiting by now even though I am starting to get hunger pains. No big deal. 

We order and the waiter comes out with the sauce. Don't they usually do the sauce spiel every time? Maybe I'm just spoiled and use to the good service at the GV location. Regardless, he just poured the sauce and left. When we got our food the rice was the exact opposite of sticky rice. In fact, it was hard and resembled uncooked rice! Unbelievable. The good news was that the Dan Dan Noodles were out of this world! The distinct flavor of the cucumber cut the heat from the chile paste perfectly. The waiter did not ask if we wanted them cut. The Mongolian Beef was also a big hit. The meal would not be complete without their famous lettuce wraps which were delicious as usual. 

Overall I was satisfied with the food and the presentation minus the uncooked rice. It's PF Changs, who doesn't enjoy the food?

On our second visit, we were pulling a large wagon full of equipment (my wife and I are photographers and were working that day in the casino) and they ensured that we were sat at a table where our wagon would be safe from accidental kicks and that other patrons would not trip over it.  Once more, our waiter made excellent recommendations and we received wonderful service.

This was the very first PF Chang's I ever went to, so it holds a dear place in my heart.. this was also the time I discovered the amazing food they serve. I didn't even know the name of the restaurant, I just knew what I ate there and what it tasted like. A few years later (maybe one or two) My friend told me he wanted me to try one of his favorite dishes and (hold and behold) it was the same exact thing I ate in Vegas! I believe it was Cantonese Chicken.  So tender, so tasty, so.. so.. ! Well, you get the point.

I remember the experience this way:
It was May or June 2007. We were walking down the strip looking for something to eat. My companion had already been to PF Chang's and told me he really liked the chicken there. The  wait was about 45 minutes (I remember this because I said: I can't wait that long, I'm hungry!). We got a buzzer and walked to the bar at Planet Hollywood. I remember the big strobe light there... I took like 15 pictures of it.  We sat for a bit and before we knew it the buzzer went off. We were taken to the second floor, and what was so great is that we could bring our drinks from the bar with us! We ordered and got our food pretty quickly (I remember this because I believe I was counting the seconds!). I wouldn't say it was an extraordinary experience, but I would say that it was the start of a beautiful, long lasting, loyal and most importantly strong relationship between myself and this fabulous chain! I don't care if people say they are overrated, I love their food, their look, their service, hell.. I love that I can make reservations on-line!!

I was forced to go to a work thing at PF Chang's in another state and the food was awful - so now you understand my reaction. 

Either way needless to say we ordered some ""chinese food"". We ordered:
- Lemon Grass Prawns with Garlic Noodles: this was YUMMY and the prawns were huge. 
- Chicken Noodle Soup: this was fantastic
- Chicken Chopped Salad + Sesame Vinaigrette: this was a good salad but I think b.c. it was delivery it was not as good as it would have been in the restaurant.
- Crab Wontons: eh - nothing special and not very flavorful
- Chicken Lettuce Wraps: good reviews of this staple item
- Dynamite Shrimp: Good
- Almond & Cashew Chicken: Yummy
- Egg Drop Soup: Good as well

While all items were satisfying and between the four of us (yes all of that for only 4 people) we had crazy left overs. 

The best part about this PF Chang's is probably their customer service. They forgot the sesame dressing for the salad and we were able to convince them to deliver it to the room. To make up for this inconvenience the manager included a piece of their cheesecake and some kind of chocolate amazingness (was it a brownie? chocolate cake? a large chocolate candy situation? No idea). Aside from them being nice enough to bring us the dressing the desserts were out of this world. I'm going to say this and I'm hoping there won't be any backlash from cheesecake connoisseurs BUT this was one of the best, if not THE best cheesecakes I've ever had.",k3wjSI44_hXgqMiYHqah7g,0,0,4,KChPw8OzUcFJF4lwsyK8mA

Their food is good not great but good, I mainly come here for the atmosphere and the good service. 

I've ordered everything from their Orange Chicken to their Broccoli & Beef to their Sesame Chicken and nothing is that spectacular but it's good food. I do like their appetizers such as their Egg Rolls and Crispy Green Beans very delicious. I also like their cocktails they have many to choose from. 

I like to get the Coconut Lemon Sour and the Dragon Martini very tasty. 

Overall I would come here again because I always have fun, it's very sheik and I enjoy the service and decor.

This is the only chain that I like. I'm not a chain food restaurant fan, in fact, I'd rather go hungry then eat in 99% of the chains out there.

P F Chang's, on the other, serves consistently tasty food, as a reasonable price....especially compared to other Vegas fare. What I really like about PFC, is that they don't up-charge simply because they're in a hotel. 
Most do. 
A great example is Starbuck's....try ordering something in a hotel Buck's. Everything is almost $2 higher. 
Not PFC. 
My orange flavored beef was the same price as their franchise back in Denver. 

We only had lunch here, but it was the cheapest, and most filling we had during our Vegas Vacation. Combine that with great service, decent view, my fav wine by the glass.....and you get 4 stars from me.

We're hungry since we haven't eaten in the last 12 hours.  We're extremely dehydrated because all we've ingested over the same 12 hours are cocktails, martinis, ketel one with diet rockstar, basically all kinds of chemicals that make you feel drunk and/or wired, but most certainly do not replenish the water content of your body at the cellular level.   Since we're staying at the Aladdin, we decide to eat at P.F. Chang's as it's convenient and always good.

The wait for a table is 45 minutes so we opt to eat at the bar instead.  The bartender, Peter, and his assistant both totally rock and do a stellar job with impeccable service.  We start with drinks as I get yet another martini and my wife gets a pear mojito.  Before I ingest a drop of alcohol, though, I ask for a glass of ice water.  I then proceed to drink 7 glasses of water within the next 10 minutes before even touching my martini.  Clearly my basic bodily function have decided that my brain is too fucked up to make the right choice and the cells in my body decide that they need to unite against this tyrant who keeps feeding them alcohol instead of pure and rejuvenating water.   Thankfully, I'm not that stupid that I would fight such a primal urge, so I drink glass after glass after glass of H2O.   Although I get a quizzical look from the assistant behind the bar, she's happy to oblige and brings me glass after glass as fast as I drink them.

We got the crab wontons and the Peking potstickers as appetizers.  I then had the Dan Dan Noodles and my wife had the crispy orange beef.   The best, said she, crispy orange beef she has ever had the pleasure to eat at P.F. Chang's.   Now we've been to Woodland Hills, San Diego, Thousand Oaks, Walnut Creek, and Emeryville locations, so we're not newbies.   Still, by far, she said this dish shined far above any other she has ever had.  

I had the Dan Dan noodles, which were quite good and had a good spicy kick to 'em.   I gotta say though that after the 8 or 9 glasses of water that I drank and the crab wontons that I chomped on, I wasn't all that hungry at that point.  My eyes glazed over which typically means that I'll be snoring away within the next 15 minutes.

I'd love it even if it hadn't been referred to in a jokingly mocking type of way in the second installment of The Hangover (when Gallifanakkis's character asks if the Buddist Temple is a PF Changs), but a bit of verbal product placement never hurt anyone. 

I was in Vegas for a friends wedding and was the first of our crew to arrive, so I went walking. I didn't want to ruin the strip for myself quite yet, so I wandered down off the beaten path and found this PF Changs. 

I was seated immediately by a friendly and talkative blonde waitress. When I told her I had just arrived in town from Toronto she informed me that she'd never been to Toronto or Canada for that matter and was a Las Vegas local. I thought the experience just have been unique for both sides of the street as she'd never been to Toronto and I had never been to Vegas. As I was there, I considered myself up 1-0.  

I ordered beef and steamed veggies, and a side of their egg rolls. If you've never tried them, they're really good. Especially given how this is a corporate venture and not a mom and pop restaurant, I wouldn't have expected much but they're very surprising. Along with three very fairly priced Bud Lights (it is Sin City after all!), my bill came up to be a very reasonable $24!

One thing consistent with both experiences was the long wait.  And because Pei Wei (aka their baby cousin) taste pretty much the same, I never made my way back here. 

Well, my most recent visit was for a friend's wedding celebration.  Congratulations Jenny on wedding number #3.  I know we joke about it.  3 times a charm!!

Couple of things to point out first;
1.  We had the whole upper level to ourselves
2.  The food was served buffet style
3.  Great view of the strip from our dining area

I actually liked the fact that we had the whole upstairs to ourselves.  This meant we can all enjoy the celebration without worrying about other patrons.  I knew I was eating cake later and having a couple of drinks, so I didn't take full advantage of the buffet.  I kept it to one plate.  I had their chicken lettuce wraps and their beef with broccoli.  There was a bunch of other usual's at the buffet (i.e. noodles, meins, rice, and wontons).  

The food here is always consistent. I'm still a fan of the food, just not a huge fan because the wait here always seems to take a long time.  I also spent some time at the bar catching up with friends. I had a few drinks.  The bartenders and waitresses were all efficient, at least with me.  One of my friends felt slided a little since her drinks always took forever or forgotten while mine were always right on.  All this did was just remind me about the service or lack of at the location.  But in the end, I'm not complaining because we were celebrating one of my closest friend's wedding, the food was free, and the drinks kept me happy.  


PS:  Some of the other guests thought that the service was worth 2 stars and would have written a review if they Yelped.  While some thought it was a solid 4 stars.  I guess it comes down to the individual who's reviewing this place.  For me, I think 3 stars is just about right.

4061403,2014-11-25,4,Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg,"I've invented an invisibility formula. Sort of. 

From now on whenever I don't want to be seen or talked to I'm going to go to the P. F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood in Vegas. My wife and I were shown to a table fairly quickly, which was good. But I was convinced that we were going to witness the second coming of Christ before a server approached our table. This was bad. We had just been book shopping before coming in here and I was thinking that maybe I had time to read my new book before we were waited on. I could have written one.

A waiter, suddenly remembering that he had a job, finally came to our table and thanked us for our patience. There was no apology offered for our wait. Just an 'Atta boy' for hanging in there. He asked if he could start us off with some drinks but since we already had an eon to stare at the menu we were able to give our full order right away. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken because there's nothing like sweet & spicy chili sauce when you're feeling ill-tempered. I didn't even bother to take a picture of my food to go along with this review. So if you've never seen what spicy chicken looks like - or a bottle of Budweiser, than I'm sorry to disappoint. But whenever I can't give you a picture - I WILL give you a thousand words.

Everything started to proceed somewhat swimmingly from here -  and 'swimmingly' isn't a word I use very often so that's a testament to how much better things really were going. We got our food pretty quickly and it was good. The waiter even came by asking if he could get me another beer. He was probably trying to get me drunk in hopes that it would increase his chances of getting a decent tip (didn't happen).

Then the invisibility formula kicked in again and we could no longer be seen or heard for another extended period of time. My wife asked if I wanted to get dessert but I was worried that might take another eight hours. I just wanted to pay the bill (or the 'check' as Americans so charmingly call it) and get out. We were finally able to get the waiter's attention and hand him our credit card. He disappeared without a trace for about ten minutes or so. I was starting to think that they truly didn't want us to leave. This must be how Henley and Frey felt when they wrote ""Hotel California."" And Don Felder too. A staff member eventually approached us and said that their credit card machine was down and that they were waiting for it to come back online. Later on it did. And we left - never to return.

""Hotel California"" has always been a work of mystery with no one truly knowing what the lyrics are really about. I do. Me, P. F. Chang, and I suspect - H. G. Wells. Along with Henley and Frey, of course. And Don Felder too.",WPdkJN1FLiNDVDWRN5MLaw,2,1,2,0qpKL19MYX6Mce_a7O2EtQ

I work at Planet Hollywood and frequently eat lunch at this location at least once a week.  Food is decent and service is usually pretty good and it's convenient from the offices that I work at upstairs.  Since I dine at this location regularly , I've signed up for the rewards program and once in a while get sent offers for buy an entree and get an entree free.   Since several of my co workers also get these offers we usually take advantage of this by ordering 2 entrees and getting the 2 free so a total of 4 entrees.  We know this is a lot of food but we're ok with having leftovers for lunch the next day.  For at least a year we have both been using our coupons and getting 2 full sized entrees with split checks between 2 people, there was also a time we did it with 3 people and 3 entrees.  All 3 people paid full price and received an additional entree free just as the coupon states.  We have never had an issue in the past year but for some reason a sever that I've never noticed before was so rude and condescending that he would not allow us to do it.  Once explained that we've been doing this for at least a year he was so snarky and said ""you get free lo Mein every time you come here?""  I was annoyed by his rude and smart ass remark that I calmly said to him, "" no, we use our offers here every time we get them without a problem, whatever the offer at the time may be"".   To make a long story short, we were so annoyed by the way the server spoke to us that we decided to leave, when I called the manager she brushed me off and said she just walked into her shift and was just made aware if the situation but I'm ore then welcome to call back in about an hour to speak with the manager that was on duty.  I declined, I decided to write a comment to corporate through the main website with no response.  

It's very unfortunate that there are a lot of great servers at this location that we really like and never give us issues, but all it takes is one horrible experience to make me want to never return.",xLoEhU6zvFzcc0erH7gfyg,0,0,1,wzrNi0uGYIbhxT4i--vc8g

We haven't been down the strip much yet so we decided to walk and tour the scrip and ended at PH. I really like PH and see a lot of younger crowds than other places. But anyways we were getting hungry so we though since we're here we can get PF Chang. So we went to PF Chang and had to wait about an hour before we got a table. The place is pretty nice with it's design and look very modern. There's an upstairs but I don't know if you're able to eat up there? Looks nice though.

Okay so we got a table and we decided to start off with Dumpling since the Dumpling I had at another PF Chang was really good. Also we ordered Hot & Sour soup. The dumpling turn out to be average and the soup tasted like...nothing. After we finish with that, I was hoping the food would be better because we're hungry. We ordered Pepper Steak, and Chicken with black bean sauce. Okay so the food came out, we were hungry and began to eat. Then, we all looked at each other like wtf? The Pepper Steak has no flavor at all, and the only flavor was the taste those small black pepper that's you're chewing on. The chicken was bad, but it's not as close as the Pepper Steak. Chicken doesn't have much flavor at all but at least it's more edible.

 I can't believe they're in business, I swear this is the worst Chinese Food I'd ever ate. I've ate at PF Chang a few times before and it was decent so they either need a new chef or something because all of the food suck. You ever get that feeling after eating like not being satisfied and wondering if you even ate at all? That's how I felt leaving there like damn, I'm not satisfied and I'm not full.

Our waitress right off the bat acknowledged us and welcomed us but she definitely seemed annoyed.  We aren't a rowdy group so every time our server, Tiffany, left we were like, ""Did we say something?""  She came off as very passive aggressive and when we would ask for extras or request water she wouldn't acknowledge that she heard us so we would repeat and she would say, ""In a minute please"" with a forced smile.  

At the end of the meal she didn't bring us fortune cookies even though there was a child in our group that mentioned how much she loved the fortune cookies while Tiffany was in the room.  As we were all leaving the restaurant we all grabbed a cookie from the front desk where Tiffany was standing.  She replied, ""Oh, I forgot to bring you cookies.  Sorry""  with the same forced smile.

Her off-putting demeanor really put a damper on our dining experience.  Although she didn't do anything way out of line, she didn't do anything to go above and beyond and made us feel like we were making her life difficult.

We came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe. 

We decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird. 

Our waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.

I started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.

We then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.

For dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy. 

Everything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.

I would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these. 

To recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay.

We had a nice time.  Our server was good but quite talkative.  I'm sure he was just trying to be sure we were having a nice stay but he just did a lot of talking when we wanted to have a nice lunch to ourselves.  So not really anything wrong, just too much.

The boy got the beef and broccoli lunch portion and it was good.  I got my usual low mein with shrimp.  It's my favorite so why get anything else.

We see that Chang's had open and available seating so this was our only hope at 2:00 and we have not eaten a meal yet.

Um no, that's gross, you won't be sweeping by my feet. How rude. I said no again. So we go to a different table that at first appeared to be clean but had fortune cookie crap in the seats and tons of wrappers around me. Okay. We sit there and she wipes down the tabletop because it needs it. 

Then I see that the table next to us is dirty too. There are people finishing up their meal but the mess on the floor appeared to be a prior mess that was never cleaned up (most adults don't leave that type/much mess). When they left the wait staff started stacking dirty dishes in a tray right next to me. It was close enough for me to touch.

I think the food is so average that the prices are bizarre. Actually, some of it is below average, because it is so darn salty. I was with four other people, and we all ate the beef and broccoli, and it was so salty that we had to complain even though we didn't want to. The waitress insisted that that's how they normally make it and that we would have to inform them next time if we want it less salty. So, the waitress gave a newly cooked and less salty plate of beef and broccoli. You could barely taste the flavoring of all the dishes. I have had the kung pao shrimp twice, and it lacked any kind of spiciness. Not even a hint. The kung pao shrimp was also salty, as well as the sweet and sour soup. We did the dinner for two and for the amount of meat they give, the amount of rice is lacking. 

I guess the pricey has to do with the high end appearance and up keep of the restaurant itself. It is nice and the servers are nice, but I definitely would not go there again. It's overrated and expensive.",uDZ9OP1PGl4iuK0mIlXXiA,0,0,2,mDj2nVnH8JTGmjvWXTN7Uw

We ordered several items such as the poke bowl, sweet and sour soup (Our fav!), Orange Chicken, Beef Chow Mein, Dan Dan Noodles and some white rice. A few friends ordered some drinks as well. Everything tasted great!

This location had some of the FRIENDLIEST, most helpful servers ever. We had a party of 22 and received NO attitude from the staff. We had a private room upstairs and were given the choice of 5 set menus OR ordering individually. (most restaurants wouldn't give the choice...it would be the set menu 4 sho for a group that large) They obviously wanted to keep us boozed up cuz they were amazing at the drink service. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the drinks were only $5.50 a piece....and were poured heavy. Nice! The food was AMPLE, with about 10 different plates to choose from. Even though the food was served ""family style"" they provided every section of the big-ass table with their own plate of each dish. For about 10 dishes it was approx $29 per person....not including drinks, tax & gratuity of course. (It ended up being $47 a person) We even had control of the music level....which was turned all the way down due to the crappiness of the music. (Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Matchbox 20...typical Star 98.7 shiz) This place is great for a big party...or if you crave mediocre chinese food at 12am. (they're open until 1am on wknds)

Very crispy and taste so good with the choices of sauces. We also enjoyed the pork dumpling and the chicken lettuce wraps. Oh let me not forget the northern style dry rub ribs which are absolutely delicious. Now for the main course. You must try the Mongolian Beef with pork fried rice. The beef is so tender you can't stop eating it. The drinks and beer are really good as well. I personally like the cosmopolitans. Trust me you won't be disappointed.

My only gripe is that I called in for a take-out order and eat in my room.  I phoned in and they said it'll be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I get there at the time they said and I paid.  I waited an extra 30 minutes.  Almost an hour to get my food.  What?

And the best part?  I tried ordering a soda and the cashier for the take-out.  He still wanted to charge me almost 4 bucks for a soda.  No complimentary soda after standing in front of you for almost 30 minutes after the time they said my food would be ready?  Whatever.

It's not like the take-out line was super busy either.

I like this place out of convenience.  I think they deliver to your room too?  But I don't want to mess around with the service fees/taxes/every other fee they tack on.

He gave many recommendations for both food and drink and we took his advice and ordered: spicy tuna roll, chicken lettuce cups, Singapore noodles, organize agave margarita and Asian pear mojito. He was personable and made us feel like friends not customers and made sure we knew about the PF Changes rewards program, which if you haven't signed up for you should ask your server next time you are in. We did not like the Singapore noodle dish because it has a very strong curry flavor which we are not fans of. When Ozzy noticed we didn't like it he apologized and without even our asking he brought over the manager and they took it off our bill. What a surprising treat their customer service is! They made sure we were happy with everything else and offered to make another dish if we wanted. We ended up ordering another spicy tuna roll which was AMAZING, thus the reason we ordered 2 of them.

This is not traditional Chinese, but it'll do when sometimes my other options didn't sound so great. 

Singapore Noodles, Dan Dan noodles, orange beef, honey chicken or shimp weren't bad and what I usually ordered.

I appreciate the brown or white rice option. Also their ice teas are surprisingly pretty good- like their blackberry jasmine green.

Now they have lunch specials- You have a few entree choices and you get hot& sour or egg drop soup.

Lunch specials are not badly priced and glad it was introduced after PF Changs stopped giving a discount to people who work in Miracle Mile/PH. Boo- they make so much money...really they can't? I normally am not a stickler about a discount but all other smaller chains and non chains offered a discount in PH but the largest chain can't to employees? Went from 25% to 20% to 15% to none in a matter of like a year. 

They effed up my order a few times and it sucks having to run back and waste my lunch break. I had to get in the habit of checking everything before leaving as once it wasn't even my order, another time I only had half of what I ordered for me and the girls at work, and another I ordered sides of veggies and it wasnt in there. 

For that, I can't really give them much due to their mistakes. It always ruined my lunch break since I end up having to get my food, take a few bites and I'm SOL and have to clock back in and eat lunch for dinner. That's fucked up that it happened 4 times before I got smart to look. And yes, they made a mistake twice after that and I got charged twice one day.

The wontons were crispy and the filling was alright.  I did like the plum sauce that was served with the wontons.  There was a lot of chicken for the lettuce wraps.  I could barely finish 2, and was glad my husband was able to eat the rest of the chicken.

The service was good and the atmosphere is not bad, a little dark, but comfortable.  I would probably give it 3.5 if I could.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will likely try another restaurant for Chinese food.",wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg,0,0,3,es4USjJmEgCjUu9VPY7PwA

But with so many great restaurants all nearby, I'd skip this place.

My main problem with this restaurant is it's poorly managed.  The food is as good as any PFChangs but the people don't seem to care and the manager doesn't follow instructions very well at all.

A group of 40, we had done countless emails back and forth with directions on what we wanted and what time we'd be there.  Of course when we arrived, they weren't ready for us and on top of that, the menu was wrong.

We ordered from the lunch menu which also came with a free soup. Julia D had tofu and brocoli and I had chicken fried rice. The portions for lunch were huge (I expected smaller) and I ended up taking the rice to eat as an afternoon snack. The combined spend for the two of us was only $30 which made it excellent value and I would happily recommend it to anyone in search of a hearty lunch in Vegas.,unV05KrzxsUQoyUF50Q_TQ,1,1,5,tjg_0elLHPTgnpwXZ44Ycw

I was going to be eating by myself, something that I usually don't enjoy doing so I tried to be good and quell my hunger with a fabulously healthy and nutritious Strawberry Whirl (with Immunity boost.. god I don't want to get this flu!) which I got inside the millennium mall next door.  I was restless and alone and needed some fresh air so I took a walk outside in the cold air with my cold drink around the corner to see what was going on at Krave.  Krave is gone.  It closed in October of last year and will be opening downtown in a few months or so the nice valet for the tony looking Italian restaurant that abuts the former Krave location informed me.  I headed back around the corner into the bright lights of the strip.  My Jamba Juice cup was empty.  My hunger was coming back full force.  I felt light headed and in need of comfort.  

I headed into PF Chang's and got a seat at the bar and ordered a Sapporo and some Sesame chicken and struck up a conversation with my neighbors at the bar who were drinking saki and having a good time.  The vibe was great here.  Tony, my server, gave me excellent quick  friendly up beat service.  After I was warmed up a bit with my food and friendly surroundings two beefy cowboys from Houston took the seats on the other side of me at the bar.  They ended up drinking saki too and we had a great time talking and I didn't feel like I was eating or drinking alone any more.   My other neighbors left, and needless to say my cowboy neighbors corrupted me into ordering saki as well and I dragged my meal out for a few hours just drinking and talking with them.  They seemed to appreciate my company as much as I did theirs, but when 10PM rolled around I had to pull myself away and get my luggage from my room (just steps away upstairs at PH) and jump in a cab to the airport.  I did get their numbers though.

Thanks, PF Changs for delivering consistent good food and friendly service.  Wether it's Bentonville AK, Tyson's Corner VA, or even the strip in Las Vegas, NV.  You guys deliver and provide a nice atmosphere conducive to a relaxed good time.

FYI.. The Large Saki I ordered was only $6.50 and packed a punch and I don't even think it was happy hour at the time since it was well after 8PM.. what a value!",wGGdj_gh-wwejcYmjf_tbw,4,2,4,xfTgp3QnFg4truDdfET3KA

Chang's is peddling is NOT chow fun. This stuff is nothing more than egg noodles, a few strips of meat and the slightest amount of flavoring; nothing like dish I am used to with delicious gravy, fresh vegetables and plenty of meat.

Anyway, they were actually really tasty and the ""light chili sauce"" is quite good (albeit not spicy at all).

For our main, we went with the Street Noodles (Thin rice noodles, light curry sauce, shrimp, chicken, julienned veggies). Again, I was very, very impressed with the food. Although it was also lacking in spice, the dish contained a number of flavors that worked really well together and I should also mention that the shrimp was plentiful.

In short: Skip this place unless you like RAW CHICKEN and poor service! 

The full story: A group of us we to lunch here while on a Vegas trip for my friend's 29th birthday. The meal started off ok until a friend noticed that her chicken was completely raw on the inside. Not just a little pink, but RAW! it was basically seared chicken covered and concealed in sauce. UNACCEPTABLE. 

To top if off, the manager was hardly accommodating. She did take a small percentage off of my friend's check, but in the end she was still charged for the inedible plate of raw chicken that she was served. 

As we tried to move on from the upset, our server seemed to completely give up on pleasing us in any way. He dropped silverware on multiple members of our party, brought out a dirty dessert spoon for my friends birthday dessert, and then tried to cover it up by saying he had mixed a sauce with it. I'm sorry ... what?? You mixed sauce with a spoon, then brought it out for my friend to eat her birthday dessert with? Then please explain why there is dried brown food stuck to the spoon that you supposedly just mixed raspberry sauce with. We weren't buying it at all. 

We left PF Chang's completely dissatisfied and praying that my friend would make it through the trip without getting sick from having eaten raw chicken. I'd give it NO stars if it were possible.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, however, it did take awhile for our entrees to come out. He went back and checked on them and did apologize that it took so long for them to come out.

I ordered what I usually order at P.F. Chang's which is the Crispy Honey Chicken. The dish was good, but I wasn't able to eat too much of it due to the delay in it coming out and having to run to get to the show.

But after eating Caucasian food non stop since we landed, we decided to give this place a try. We were also intrigued by the line up outside the restaurant; and since we've never eaten here we thought we'd try this place. 

My first impression of the place was 'wow'. A huge and quite a classy place so I was impressed right off the bat. Right outside, people can be spectators and watch the busy kitchen as they scoop, portion, scale, deep fry, pan fry and prepare the food. I'm always fascinated by this because this looks really cool to me. Anyway, my friend and I waited around half an hour for our food, which I wasn't very happy about. Thank goodness I had something to watch for half an hour while they make my food. 

We ordered the Crab Wontons, Singapore Street Noodles, and the Shanghai Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. The wontons were nice and crispy, I LOVED the filling. The shrimp dish was pretty decent. I found the vegetables quite soft, which was surprising because Asian restaurants usually serve vegetables quite crisp. Well in Vancouver anyway. The noodle dish had a nice ,strong curry flavor. The shrimp was cooked well but the chicken was kinda tough and sinewy.

Overall it was ok. I think the fact that I'm immersed in a wide variety of Asian cuisine here at home makes me more critical of Asian cuisine elsewhere. My friend best described it as ""white man's version of Asian food"". Which is actually very true. 

Good value for the price; I'm quite annoyed that I completely missed the dessert menu. I really wanted to try the Banana Spring Rolls, the Tres Leche Lemon Dream, the Apple Pie and the Carrot Cake. But really, I shouldn't be eating dessert while in Vegas. Just bad for my gut. 

There's also a gluten free menu for you guys and gals who can't have gluten.

Would I come back? Maybe. It wouldn't be the first place I would think of visiting but I would consider it. It gets a 3.5/5 from me, but I think I'll kick it down to 3/5 stars. It could be a lot better.",oHhrlIDb8YapzCVERNwqvA,0,0,3,RIwVBekgQp_RBldQBlPmyQ

the look and feel of the restaurant was nice. next time, I'd love to eat upstairs in the private area where they had a wedding rehearsal dinner going on.

be daring and try this season's ""Spicy Paloma"" -a drink made with Jalapeño Tequila, fresh jalapeño slices, mixed with freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. delicious and refreshing with a little kick at the end.",ifjexvE6xa48QnTlOVmn0A,0,0,5,UVm8V9_M5dJazEljp4RIFg

This is the second time I've visited this location and both times have been just that, A-OK. Nothing memorable, nothing out of this world. PF Chang's is good, consistent, and overall dependable meal.

They recently added a few fall items to the menu and the Harvest Curry is delicious. Coconut milk based and loaded with vegis that aren't over cooked and still maintained a nice crunch.

The patio area is a great place to eat while enjoying Vegas weather. If you're a person who likes to eat and people watch, P.F. Chang's patio area is definitely for you.

I sat at the bar and the service was fast and friendly and the bartender recommended a very good beer.

The ambience is perfect, as you would expect from PFC. The doors to the casino are closed so noise level is pretty low for Vegas.

Main course was surf and turf. The filet mignon was super tender and flavorful and the Lobster was perfect tempura style with very light panko and also very tender.",pErxFlaui7x1DhcKKdSz7g,0,0,5,iTSHdmtX91jyweU-2ssCzA

So we had tickets that night for the Beatles LOVE show over at the Mirage, but we wanted to eat first. We tried a few places but they all had a two hour wait. We go over to PF Changs which had an hour wait so we put our name down. Out of nowhere a bartender comes downstairs and says there are seats at the upstairs bar we can sit at, and we wouldn't need to wait. SCORE!! That's what I call being in the right place at the right time.... We head upstairs and order our drinks plus our food. The bartender was very nice and had great customer service. We were able to have a few drinks, eat, and still make it to our show on time. 

I give this bartender 5 stars.... And we gave him a hefty tip! The flying kiss in my profile picture is for people like him.",t7E0chL0rY4NNKtkHs7kaQ,5,3,5,GqK3YTmMAWKQSqQtYqMCyA

The food was amazing.  We ordered the pan-fried shrimp dumplings, sesame chicken, and vegetable lo mein.  We loved all of it.  And when we got the bill at the end, we were shocked at how reasonable it was.  I believe I said ""That's much less than it needs to be for how good it was.""  At the end of the meal, my father and I were both remarking on how impressed we were with the whole experience.

We ordered the shrimp potstickers pan fried and the shrimp fried rice. (Definitely were shrimp'd out by the end ) 
The potstickers were crunchy with a ton of flavor and the same goes for the rice. It was so good that we hope the food will be just as delicious here in San Jose. 
Our service was excellent too! Don't know the woman's name, but she saw we had a baby & offered anything we needed for the baby, she'd bring it for us!

For those who don't, have a nice Japanese Sapporo with your mixed Asian grille style. No complaints by me, this is pretty good fare for the weak of auricle and ventricle when it comes to Chinese. If I needed an MSG hit and couldn't find a good Cantonese place, this would do. Its like when you hit a city you don't know after riding cross country next to sweaty pock faced woman in gray sweats that say (ARMY) on them and suffer under her wheezing, sighing, and sneezing, not to mention guffawing at a People magazine. You need a safe home to eat dinner, some safe, relatively hygenic food. So you hit the Irish pub and rinse old scabface out of your mind with a few pints of Guinness and a shepherd's pie.

Proper or not, I like PF Chang's!  Although it's not the best food, it's tasty and it sure makes my mouth happy.

I mentioned in my previous blog that mom was visiting from Korea.  We went to Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood.  While my hubby was playing poker, mom and I decided to eat at the PF Chang's located inside the hotel.  It is here that my mom's obsession with this restaurant starts all over again. 

We always order the Garlic Noodles.  We LOVE this dish.  We also ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we enjoy.  We sat out in the patio and blissfully soaked in the fair weather while munching happily on our lunch.
