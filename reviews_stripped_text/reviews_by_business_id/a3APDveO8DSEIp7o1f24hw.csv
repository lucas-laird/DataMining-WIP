I was sure I was doomed to eat salads and bean burritos all weekend...but I was wrong. Steve Wynn makes sure that all restaurants at the Wynn have a vegan option. The option at Zooza's is a Vegan Cheeseburger, fries, and a vegan chocolate shake. The burger was okay. It was made with Gardein. The fries were good, but the shake was GREAT! I was also pleasantly surprised by the price. I thought that the combo of ebing vegan and being at the Wynn would break me...but it was only $9 for the combo. Very reasonable for vegan food in Vegas.

We were looking forward to a late dinner, where we could get good food without a major production or long wait.  We definitely found it here.    
The food was really terrific - you order at a counter and they give you a number and bring your food to your table.  We had a Rueben, motzo ball soup, a BLT, and a cheesecake dessert.   Very fresh tasting, excellent quality ingredients.  Our total bill came to around $55 (we just had tap water to drink) which is slightly a lot for what we had but I thought the value was definitely there.  I have no problem paying a premium for great food.
The wait for our food was not bad at all.  We arrived about 45 min before closing time and there was still a pretty decent size crowd - the seating area was at least 3/4 full.  We tried to go to this place before but they were closed - closing time is fairly early for Vegas - like 11 pm so don't miss out.",xmufQkOovv3gfbNgLga_2Q,0,0,5,c3jWuTUGai9WFue2yasoXw

Of course, as soon as we get there, I am suddenly really hungry and feel like I can't make it to dinner.  Normally, I try to avoid eating on the strip because I feel like I have to sell an organ to pay for the food.  (What? $10 for a hot dog at Pink's, Planet Hollywood???)  We ended up stopping by ZoozaCrackers as it was next to the sports book, a requested stop on our excursion.  

I ended up getting chicken fingers, fries and a coke.  While it wasn't cheap (approximately $20), it was actually good!  The chicken actually tasted like, well, chicken.  (I really need to stop eating at McDonald's because I have no idea what that stuff is that it calls Chicken McNuggets).  It was warm and nicely seasoned with pepper.  The fries were also fresh out the fryer.  

Overall, a great place to stop by and have a quick snack.  And depending on where you sit, you may have a good vantage point of the games playing in the sports book area :-)",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,1,0,4,xPRq1r5F1MgP9WighAKUEQ
296226,2013-01-16,0,a3APDveO8DSEIp7o1f24hw,"Had relatives in town over the weekend and needed a restaurant for a quick dinner before their plane.  We came here so I could have something to eat with them since they have a vegan menu.  As Ryan mentions below, Dylan has got to be one of the worse employees I have ever seen in a major hotel on the strip.  I asked for the vegan menu about 4 times before he decided to give me a copy of it.  It's not like he had to go get one as they were stacked right next to the cash register literally under his right hand.  Kept asking me if the order was ""for here or to go"".  I would tell him ""here"" and he would stare at me and ask it all over again.  Finally I said very slowly ""I will be eating this HERE"".  

I ordered the $9 cheeseburger special and the vegan matza ball soup.  The soup was huge.  Full of chopped carrots and celery and a single matza ball. I guess they've cut back on the 3 matza balls from the 2010 review.  The matza ball was hard (just the way I like them) but very bready inside.  It's almost like they used flour instead of matza meal to make it. The vegetable broth had absolutely no flavor.  I must have dumped 6T of salt and pepper in it to give it flavor.

The cheeseburger special was nothing to write home about.  An extremely small burger (think kids size from one of the chains) with a soggy bland white bread bun, a small Gardein burger, a single slice of soy american cheese, mustard and  a couple of pickle slices.  A small bowl of french fries (crisp but bland) and an 8oz cup of chocolate milkshake.  The milkshake was not very thick and had a very pronounced cocoa aftertaste.  

Granted, it was all vegan but still...  I felt like I was eating a kids happy meal without the toy.  That's how small everything was.  Went home and had dinner.

Went here twice during our stay. First time was a Saturday. We wanted to grab lunch to-go for the Wynn pool. I had the turkey Reuben and the GF had the roast beef. Being a NYC style deli, had a nice pile of meat. The Reuben was pretty good and the GF enjoyed her roast beef. 

Next day, we ate here before our flight. I had the Benny, which is two poach eggs on cheese on pastrami. GF had the corn beef sandwich and the friend had pastrami sandwich. Benny was ok. Small portion, I should of gotten a sandwich. The GF and friend was satisfied with their sandwich. 

So for Vegas standards, this was a causal laid-back eatery. If you don't feel like going to a ritzy place at the Wynn or don't want to stuff yourself at the buffet or don't want to go to the mall. This was a good option. For all those who complain about the prices, are you all Vegas virgins. You're on the Vegas Strip, eating at the Wynn. Of course, it's not going to be cheap or low price.

The soup was brought out about 15 minutes later (the cashier mentioned there would be a wait) in huge bowls on square plates. It was definitely the perfect amount of soup especially for the semi-high price tag of $6.95. It was essentially three medium-sized matzo balls, vegetable broth with small bits of carrot and celery. The vegetables were nice and crunchy, not soft and overcooked. The matzo balls were really good and held their shape well, they didn't fall apart easily. The fries I got were salty and crunchy and very good, but kind of a small portion.

When staying at the Encore, I was VERY excited to see that there was a New York-style deli on the premises. I'm not sure if I was there on a bad day or not, but I left feeling a bit let down with my corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup.

First, the corned beef on my sandwich was a decent portion. (I was expecting there to be barely any and was pleasantly surprised with how much I got.) However, what I was served was probably the most dried-out corned beef I've ever been served. While it was lean and tasted OK, it was just dry-as-a-bone. Major fail. The rye bread was fresh enough, but nothing spectacular.

Moving on to the matzoh ball soup--also a mixed bag that overall didn't work. For the price, it was a very generous serving: a huge matzoh ball in a soup that's full of noodles, chicken, carrots, and celery. The matzoh ball itself was nice and soft. However, the chicken in the soup was so salty it was inedible (and I like salty). I wound up eating half the soup and just avoiding the chicken.

The food was pretty good, well seasoned, and tasted fresh. The place would get 5 stars from me if not for the service...

The service is the worst I've ever seen in any city, any state, and about what I'd expect from a McDonalds in the middle of nowhere, not from a cafe in a fancy five-star hotel. The hostess, from when we went, apparently had great difficulty in using the English language... After asking how to get a table (the set up is a bit strange, with a stand-in-line cafe that is also a sit-down normal restaraunt), she told us to get in line at the counter and put us on a list for a table. A few minutes later, I noticed other people, who arrived 10-15 mins after us were being seated but she had not called us. I went and saw that she had crossed us off. I argued, since that's what she had told us to do. She said that she had never said that. If I had been alone, I would have thought that I had just misunderstood. But both my friend and I, who had listened to her explanation, thought the exact same thing. 

Since the 'customer is never right' here, apparently, the hostess proceeded to glare at us and basically told us that we were stupid and ""obviously"" didn't listen to what she had explained to us for about 5 minutes, at which point another male server/waiter/manager (? not sure what his job was) came, asked what was happening, etc. The male server told the hostess to move us to the top of the list and we finally got a table.

Apparently, the place turns from self-serve counter place to a sit-down restaurant with to go orders at the counter at 11 PM. Seeing as we arrived at 10:55 PM, apparently the hostess hadn't told us something incorrectly, so it was ""our fault"". But we were begrudgingly given a table.

Now here comes the fun part: the hostess (who apparently hated us for some reason) didn't tell a waitress that we were sitting (in the corner) and it took 30 minutes for a waitress to come serve us. Once the waitress came, things became okay since she was awesome and came to check on us often, apologizing for the delay.

Honestly, I think the hotel should be ashamed at hiring such spiteful people who yell at you for their mistakes. But maybe I'm just expecting too much?",KAtAL2P2kBoVYL34A0eF4Q,0,0,3,F_NHg92UFe9In5o4opHCUQ

1890023,2015-07-08,5,a3APDveO8DSEIp7o1f24hw,"Thanks to John B., I knew right away that there was a ""vegan fast-food"" style meal available at The Wynn for an affordable price.

Fresh off the plane and too hungry and tired to deal with a full service-restaurant just yet, I hopped into Zoozacrackers Deli for a quick meal. It felt good to walk through the air-conditioned resort and putting a bet in the sports book before arriving here.

You order at the counter, and find a spot to sit. For a deli, this has to be the fanciest deli I've ever stepped foot into. If it wasn't for the quick-service type ordering, you'd think this was another one of Wynn's expensive and exclusive restaurants. Huge spacious booths lined with top quality fabric, plenty of gorgeous light fixtures throughout and a very elegant floor plan.

The menu has quite a large selection, but luckily the vegan option is highlighted in green right in the middle of the board!
For $11, you get a Gardein cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake.

The fries were delicious-perfectly crunchy and just the right amount of seasoning. The shake was absolutely amazing. It hit the right spot and cooled me down, why the extra chocolate flavor made me feel like a kid. 
Unfortunately the cheeseburger did not do it for me. It looked like a McDonald's burger-and I mean that in the bad way. It was too 'perfect' as in unnatural looking. The bun was starchy and tasted like cheap fast food bun. The burger itself didn't have the delicious gardein taste I know-lack of seasoning. All in all very bland, very plain, and mimicked fast food burger a little too much.

Kyle H. bought a veggie sandwich and that was much more delicious! Way more fresh too. He also bought the Matzo Ball soup, which I did not eat of course. I was just more intrigued by the giant thing that was floating in his soup. Supposedly it was the Matzo Ball, I think it is more like an aliem egg about to hatch into something more sinister.

Overall, for the price and for something quick and convenient, it was okay. Maybe next time I'll substitute the cheeseburger for another chocolate shake. I might get diabeetus, but for this chocolate shake it's almost worth it.",x9DRvDktxccwvZemaOMgZA,5,3,3,BuWoK80pupM0xA0r7PKzbQ

Luckily one of my Vegas companions said we had to come here so I could try their Vegan burger meal.  Wow!  The burger made me feel like I was eating a burger from a McDonald's Happy Meal, and it brought back fond memories of being able to eat a quick bite almost anywhere at any time.  I relished every bite.
The burger comes as part of a package deal for nine dollars, it comes with fries and a ""chocolate"" shake.  The fries were greasy and as I had recently had Bouchon's fries (which are divine) I only ate a few.  The shake was chocolate but the taste of coconut was so pervasive I would have called it a coconut chocolate shake.  I thought it was adequate for what it was, a vegan shake.  One of my dining companions wanted her own shake and they would not sell her one separately, you had to buy the package.  She is not a vegetarian and she likes coconut, so if you love coconuts, and are vegan, you will probably think this shake was amazing.    
I had three other dining companions and everyone liked what they had.  I have to say the Pot Roast dinner looked very good, and my other companions enjoyed their sandwiches.  I don't like to smell smoke while I am eating and even though this establishment is right off the casino floor I found it to be a relaxing and enjoyable place to eat a relatively quick meal before exploring more of all that Vegas has to offer.

My Chicken Sourdough Melt was delicious. For once I could actually taste the provolone and the sourdough was not dry at all. The fries were fresh and crispy worth the additional $4. I know I was overpaying for the food but it was damn good. 
Theres a huge dessert display case if you got a sweet tooth. For $13 you get a slice of the biggest cake I've ever seen. It can easily feed 3-4 people; diabetics be warned. 
The Wynn Burger is their most popular dish. An all vegan cheese burger (I think the cheese is soy) along with a serving of fries and a small shake all for $9.

Priced at $12.79 I ordered the ""1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo"" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.

Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.

Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. 

I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,29,19,1,dmbFl9Hy5ywhzvdRLWENvA

For $11 (used to be $9) you get an entirely Vegan fast food meal experience. A Gardein patty on a pasty sesame seed bun, topped with American style ""cheese"". Be sure to ask for lettuce at no charge as it oddly doesn't come standard. If you're feeling frisky, you can top it with avocado for a reasonable (for Vegas) $1.50 more.

A side of tasty seasoned fries and a chocolate milkshake round out the meal. That coconut based choco-shake is a contender for the best Vegan chocolate shake in the world. Or maybe I was just craving something shake-like after being disappointed by Holstein's lack of a Vegan shake. Just be sure you know how to handle your chocolate before you down this bad boy. That sucker packs a wallop!

Is the Gardein patty cooked to perfection? No, not quite. It could use more flame broiling, less microwaving but it's still pretty good and the overall price is right. The pasty bun is pretty pasty tasting as well. However, for a ""cheap"" quick meal in The Wynn, get your ass to Zoozacrackers, conveniently located next to the sports book.

It must've been good enough that my sweetie risked filling herself up too much before our meal at Sinatra later that night by ordering another one after we finished the first one we shared for lunch.

They had these huge slices of cake in the display cases, so we figured between the four of us, we could easily polish one off. Now, when I saw huge, I am talking seven layers of cake and seven layers of frosting. Huge.

At $11.95 a slice, it was a little pricey. Because there were so many of us, we justified that it would have been more if we had purchased individual items on our own. So we went with it.

Upon ordering, we were greeted by a fellow named Dylan who was less than helpful. When we asked him questions about the menu, he just shook his head or muttered yes or no. Whatever. My friend asked for a glass of water, he ignored her. She asked again after the transaction, and he slammed it in front of her. Maybe it was us. Nope- the next group of people weren't from the US and were having a some trouble communicating their order. Did Dylan help? Nope. They asked a question about a sandwich and he just pointed to the menu and said, ""whatever's up there, is on it."" Thanks guy- I'm sure that helped.

Now, only Dylan was less than pleasant. The other lady (who I interacted with while getting some drinks), Denise, was super friendly and helpful. She greeted people at the register, asked if we were having fun and thanked us for coming. Complete difference.

Now, I did take off a star for service (was going to take off more, but Denise was the saving factor)- but the rest of the stars were taken off because of how bad the cake was. We went with the Strawberry Shortcake version that was made with strawberries and white cake. The cake seriously tasted like it had be sitting in the fridge uncovered for quite some time or next to a macaroni salad. It definitely didn't taste like sweet cake- but something that should accompany a salad. I think it was sitting for too long next to too many different ingredients. It acted like a sponge for all the other flavors. Gross.

I guess the cakes in the display case are just for looks- such a bummer that something so beautiful tasted so rancid. For being the Wynn, I expected their standards to be a little higher in food and customer service.",nxWrhF_hyX0wwjrEkQX8uQ,23,11,1,Sr4pAj9PewQObHB-2_JYmw
3789535,2008-03-28,0,a3APDveO8DSEIp7o1f24hw,"Zoozacrackers, despite the unusual name, is the best deli in Vegas.

I think a lot of people dis this place because:
the name sounds child like ....
""soda crackers"" ... what ????
the location makes it seem like part of the sports book ....
it is located in a hotel with 6 or 7 extravagant restaurants ....

Why you should eat here - -
The sandwiches are huge.
The ""ton"" of french fries come in a large bowl.
The soups are supurb
The brownie is gigantic
They serve bread and butter pickles with the Burger
They have mock ups of what the sandwiches look like in the display case.
You do not have to guess what your sandwich will look like ......

My first experience at the deli was eating a Chicken salad BLT. 
It was just amazing. It was not only huge, it was superbly tasty.
It was a difficult choice, the chicken over the burger, so I had to return a second time for the burger.
The Zoozabuger is a meal in itself. 
A huge hamburger with pastrami and cole slaw. The burger comes with garnish of lettuce, onion and tomato.  
(enough to make a small salad)
The real treat is a small dish of bread and butter pickles.
They are as good as the ones my grandmother used to make.
A dining treat.

I feel if Steve Wynn did not name this location for one of his friends and gave it one of the ""trendy"" deli names ....
it would rank as one of the best, if not the best in Las Vegas.
As a deli it matches, in it's own way, the quality of the fine dining experiences available in the Wynn.

it is one of those whimsical experiences.

The gem here is the vegan burger!

It's a filling meal, and alllll vegan....which is great for me, because I looooove me some milkshakes, but my inability to digest lactose normally makes them an ugly proposition!!!

Even this quick spot for food is actually cool. 

If you're looking for something quick to grab for lunch I would actually recommend it. 
Terrace point cafe were closed at 3pm, country club had only their lounge menu which is extremely small and that's how I found myself here! 

These are the things I liked:

1. The staff is super super friendly and professional!
2. The food was good! 
I took the chicken csr wrap which wasn't as big as I thought but was still yummy. 
Their French fries are literally heaven made! Super yummy, crunchy and golden! 
3. It might sound weird, but Their booths are like vacation for your behind! So comfy!

So it's only fair I bump up the stars. 

For lunch I get the half sandwich + matzo ball soup. With all the upgrades (cheese, matzo) I pay $14ish with tax. It's honestly worth every penny to me and a killer deal for those staying at the Wynn with limited high quality cheap-ish options.

It's served warm and I like to get provolone  melted all over it. YUM. A half sandwich is a manageable size and isn't some sick gluttonous meat fest like you get at Carnegie. The meat, cheese, bread ratio is perfect. I add deli mustard of course !

WYNN BURGER ($11): The entire meal is vegan. Literally the exact same menu option is offered at Society Cafe inside Encore for the same price, but with poorer presentation here (plastic cups instead of glass, etc.). This meal is the cheapest option on the menu because it comes with a chocolate milk shake and fries. Everything else on the menu is served a la carte. I asked for lettuce on my burger and they obliged. I happen to like the chocolate shake but my husband begged to differ. Smh. 3/5
PRO TIP: If you're going to order the Wynn burger, walk on over to Society Cafe for a way better experience!

ZOOZA BURGER ($15.49): Expensive for a burger, but my better half gave it his approval. It's pretty gigantic too, so at least you're getting your moneys worth. 4/5
FRIES ($3.99): Taste like Burger King fries (not necessarily a bad thing). 3/5

VIBE: Upscale Denny's minus the servers + counter service for ordering. I was surprised at how slammed this place was on a Sunday night at 9PM. It's connected to the Sportsbook.  

SERVICE: It was near impossible to catch one of the servers for a refill. The option to go up to the registers and ask a cashier for a refill is an option but they were so busy tending to the never ending line of customers we didn't want to bother them. The Deli is pretty much self-serve. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Our grand total came to $37 and some change. I'm not planning on coming back, but if you're in a rush or are trying to keep your dining costs at a minimum while you're at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers Deli will do.

It is not some magical NY style deli.  The food is very meh.  The chicken nachos are kind of dry, no beans and just kid stuff nacho cheese...meh.  The wings, not crispy, and very meh.

While the offerings were slim (it is a deli, after all) we chose the ZoozaBenedict and a Breakfast sandwich. The Eggs Benedict were excellent and the sandwich was as well - my wife stated that it was too big to finish but it disappeared anyway. Funny how that worked - I had been hoping for a bite.

The waitstaff was very attentive and brought me a full coffee to go when I asked if I could get an empty cup to pour my remaining coffee in and take back to the room. Not crowded at 8:30 am and well worth the trip. Our bill was $26.00 and we will definitely go back again.",0_NbnQy2AwOUDtDUr4uDTg,1,1,4,jQoq6vYT6kRutw4ejuTKVQ

I ordered my fave French fries because you can't really screw it up. My friends ordered soups, jalapeno poppers and of course beers ($7-8)

5918586,2010-09-15,0,a3APDveO8DSEIp7o1f24hw,"Quick summary - decent NY style deli fare for casual diners looking for a relatively inexpensive any time of the day meal within the top notch Wynn/Encore casino resort.  Don't expect much in terms of service, it is a walk up to the counter and place your order with a helpful cashier and take your ""number"" to the seat of your choice and wait for the runner to bring it to you casual dining operation.  Food is okay to good. Dessert looks decent, but did not have a chance to try it.  Meal Price = $15-25 avg per person.
My cousin, uncle and one of their office staff were visiting from Taiwan and attending the SuperZoo Tradeshow at Mandalay Bay. After picking them up from MB, we headed for the Wynn and ended up at Zoozacrackers, which is near the Wynn Sports Book.  After looking over a sign near the entrance with a partial listing of the menu, we waited in line to place our order with the cashier.  The bill for 4 came to $89 plus change and we ordered 3 soups, 2 iced teas (really a super profit center for Wynn),  1 Turkey Reuben, 1 Hot Pastrami, 1 Mo Wrap, 1 Tuna Salad Sandwich, and a Rebel Fries.
After finding a table and sitting down, it felt like a long time for our order to be prepared and brought out to us.  It could be that there was another group of 5-6 that ordered right before us.  Anyway, it is probably the fact that it was already 3:50pm and they had originally planned to be at the airport at 4pm. So when the food arrived, my cousin finished her soup before I was done taking pictures of all the food we had ordered.  And normally she is not exactly a fast eater, but walking around a tradeshow for 8-9 hours can make anyone famish. But we still have time to properly finish the meal before having to rush off to the airport.  I asked for to-go containers and the cashier was nice enough to go search in the back for several large ones for us.  So I basically have 1/2 of each sandwich we ordered for my tasting and Yelp review.

My Hot Pastrami was decent.  Good portion of thinly sliced pastrami, but not as good as Katz's (even though they supposedly checked out Kat's in NY when they were planning the menu) on choice of bread (Rye, White, Sour Dough, etc.). But good enough to come back for more for me.

My Uncle's Turkey Reuben - not my favorite. Overall the sandwich just feels dry, and the turkey is the main culprit. And holding it in your hand makes it greasy.

Mo Wrap - looks good in the display case, and tastes good too. The coleslaw is what gives this turkey wrap the tangy moistness that have doomed the other turkey sandwich in the deli menu lineup.
 
Tuna Salad Sandwich - this was ordered by accident, since my cousin had intended for it to be a ""salad"" salad for us to share, but there are only 3 salad options on the menu (Chef's Salad, Cobb and Caesar). The tuna salad mix was okay, reminds me of the Tuna Panini Sandwich served at Jean Philippe's Patisserie at Bellagio/Aria, except with less chopped celery and black pepper, and red onions instead of white). But it really is too moist for the bread and the bottom piece of bread quickly became too soggy. I would not order it in the future for the messy factor, plus why come to Vegas for a sandwich you can easily make at home?

Rebel Fries - just your fries topped with gooey cheese, jalapeño, and other not too memorable garnishes. Portion is large, definitely a meal for one or a side for sharing. But taste is blah at best.

Soups - Big portions  and I would considered a good deal for a dining establishment within the Wynn or other major Strip casinos.  Highly recommended if you want something satisfying and have positive perceived value for the money.

Iced Tea at $3.50 + tax - Highway robbery pricing for the less than 8 oz of liquid you get in a small plastic cup, mostly filled with ice cubes.  Steve Wynn admitted/bragged about his casino's super high profit margin from beverage sales (like1,000%) and this is a fine example of how he is delivering shareholder value.

Anyway, I would not really recommend this place for locals, but if you are a visitor to Las Vegas and staying at the Wynn/Encore or even across the street at Palazzo, it is a decent price meal option without having to cab it to some other restaurant. Of course you can pay more for the buffet and get a fabulous meal with a lot of variety.

3 stars for visitors without a car (2 stars for Las Vegas locals, because we can drive to better places that are cheaper and frankly offers better food). If you want to eat at the Wynn, seriously consider the Wynn Buffet or other sit down restaurant which will cost more but you also get better food.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,3,1,3,kvC2jmTi4LqNBkGNySha5Q
5939158,2013-11-25,17,a3APDveO8DSEIp7o1f24hw,"I could never pronounce the name of this place. I don't even know what the f*ck a Zoozacracker is! I always thought Zoozacracker sounded like a racist remark people would use in Queens or the Bronx or something. 

I've probably come here once every year for the last 4 years. I wrote a review about this place about a year ago but the filter ate it, claiming I was a worker here. 

Finally wanted to figure out what a Zoozacracker is, so I googled it. Found no information. Decided to break the words apart. We all know what a cracker is, but what the f*ck is a Zooza? Well, according to google a Zooza is some dude who provides an individual legal proof that they are the owner of a horse..or something like that. Still, I have no f*cking clue what that is supposed to mean! Combining Zooza(Horse licensure litigation specialist guy) with Cracker(Saltine Square), doesn't make a shred of sense. But, nothing does here. The interior design looks like either a David Lynch movie, or the room where Debbie Harry starts rapping in the 1981 mtv music video, ""Rapture"". I know ""irony"" is the big thing these days, but I don't f*cking like irony. It sucks. The interior design can ironically f*ck off!

They got this burger that they pack with coleslaw, thousand island, and swiss cheese. It's not bad. It's extremely messy though. The Rueben is also pretty good, but I don't think there is one New Yorker alive that would say it can compare to Carnegie, Weiss, or Greenberg Deli(all here in LV/Henderson). 

The first time I ever came here was with my poker buddy in 2009. We had accumulated about $15 of comps. The bill came out to like $17 and the lady at the counter waived the extra $2. They had excellent customer service back then. Came back a few months later but this time they made us pay the balance. 

Of course they charge for every little thing. I've been to kosher delis that would charge for a side of thousand island for my New York Sky High, so I'm not surprised. Actually, I won't be surprised if they start charging for the water and the pickles soon.

The first time I decided to eat here, I asked multiple Wynn workers the question: ""Where is Zoozacrackers located?"" None of them knew the answer. Most of them didn't know what the f*ck I was talking about. One guy even told me that Zoozacrackers was located at Koval and Flamingo.... When I finally found the place, I couldn't get in because in front of the entrance was Antonio Tarver. He was piss drunk and having an argument with some chick who was dressed like a stripper.

I got the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo. The clam chowder soup I got was good on the flavor and seems healthier since didn't seem like cream/milk was put into it, but it was on the cold side. I wished it was hotter. The turkey sandwich was meh, not that good. The mayo didn't help with the flavoring much so i used the horseradish to up the flavor.

After eating 2 very overpriced buffet meals at Wynn( xmas eve and xmas day), we decided to just have a light dinner on Xmas day.  I read the reviews so I knew what to except.  We brought in our own sodas because I don't fancy paying 3.50 for a soda.  They gladly gave us a glass of ice.  

We shared the matza ball soup(7.49).  I was expecting a salt lick, but it was actually a little bland.  I had to add a little salt to make it tastier.  The matza ball wasn't the best I've ever had.  It was a tad on the heavy side, not light and fluffy like I prefer.  

We shared a turkey burger too.  It was huge( 11.99), and it came with a pickle and that's about it. It was a really good turkey burger though, probably one of the best I've had.  We got a side of fries( 3.99).  Those were cold and not crispy.   I sent them back and they didn't come back to use until we were finished with the burger.  

All in all, it was fine for what it was.  26.00 for the two of us and we left full.  

The portions are large, be aware of that.  We saw two women order soup, salad, and a burger each and their eyes just about bugged out of their head when they saw how much food they got.  They could have shared it all for half the cost",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,5,1,3,pK4SMY1eixvwegrTKYT1Dw

Ok not really it was like $18 but throw in a wife and some drinks and its 45 drollars down the pipe. 

So the real question is were the buns brushed with gold flakes? Nope but to be truly honest Its not just because its in a flashy Casino that it is expensive. This really is one of the best burgers I have ever had. They also have a Vegan burger for half the price if you're into that sorta thing.

Why was it so good? The buns were the super big poofy ones that are so nice and pillowy. The burger was very thick and perfectly cooked so that it had the perfect amount of juice.

The fries were pretty dang good too. 

To top it off I've had a burger in SF that cost the same amount that sucked a$$ so I consider this place a gold mine for burgers.
