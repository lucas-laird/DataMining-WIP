47636,2015-06-23,26,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"The food was really good, but the service was very disappointing. We attended the Argentine Tango dance night, so the restaurant was pretty crowded. However, the restaurant only had 1 waitress (who did a good job) for the whole restaurant, but she was the only one, so it took us at least a half hour to get our check, I had to ask twice. Plus they charged us automatic gratuity, so there was little incentive for them to be expedient with their service. Hopefully the service will get better, because the food was pretty good, and the dance event was very nice.",GseqsuanhdE2z-LottPuDg,2,1,2,xVSaql-dLe7afuFAVqSFbQ
52740,2016-10-03,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Vila Algarve is a ""must eat"" place.

My first time, the Caldo Verde really made an impression, and the Bacalau ""a Brass"" likewise, was a winner.

The tasty food was great enough, but Luby (owner, chef, hostess) made the experience twice as good.

So, two days later, I returned with a friend and we both had a wonderful evening, having Caldo Verde, Portuguese Paella, and carrot cake for dessert.  Again, Luby's authentic good nature came shining through.  As a bonus, we were entertained by the dance lessons while enjoying the food.

Two of us got the Paella, we both agreed it tasted liked boxed Spanish rice, chicken on the skewer was dry and tough and the frys with it were just Ore Ida frozen ones. Tried the chicken liver appetizer, this was tasty, but I'm not sure why everyone on this site is raving about the toast, it's actually just white Wonder bread. Took 3 hours for us to get our food, owner did say it would take a while, (claiming it's all fresh made), it's more like they only have to burners on the stove and 1 sauce pan, literally brought out 1 dish then would have to wait 10-15 minutes for someone else's dish (not busy either, only 5 other people there).

The atmosphere is amazing and they have a huge dance floor and a variety of dancing on the nights of the week. The restaurant is family owned and the customer service is amazing.

82996,2017-12-12,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,Amazing Portuguese food! Linguica (chirizo) is unique and very yummy. Must try the curry. The owner is very friendly. We were treated like her family!,pKRxP-dnhIOlej0aqSfoQg,8,0,5,hbCvS78-1u7J8Ww2lntn7w
97310,2014-08-04,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"This is a fun place to go. The owner bubbles with enthusiasm and will be very happy to discuss her dishes as much as you like. Our party of four had pig ears, chicken Algarve (thin chicken filet with cheese and mushrooms and spices, baked chicken, and chicken on a shish kabob; the first chicken dish and the pig ears were the best in terms of flavors. Unfortunately, they were out of the Portuguese Chorizo and we didn't try any of the more exotic dishes. Everyone liked everything. I plan to go back and try some of their seafood dishes. 

I notice reviews cover the spectrum on the Sangria. The owner asked us if we would like a liter of Sangria which is a tad more than quart. We're not big drinkers and we hesitated. The owner assured us it was a light drink; she said she just put a little port wine in and no Vodka; she acted like making Sangria with Vodka was very unauthentic. So the four of us shared a liter of Sangria. The Sangria tastes good but I judged the alcohol content to be substantially less than that of a typical red wine. So order the Sangria if you would like a light alcohol drink with great flavor and order wine if you want something with more bite. 

When we ordered, the owner told us that one of the dishes would take at least 35 minutes since it was being made from scratch. We were up for a leisurely Sunday evening meal with good company so that was not a problem for us and spent about an hour and twenty minutes there. Of course, if you are on a tighter schedule, ask what can be prepared fast. 

Service was attentive without the waitresses introducing themselves and announcing that they would be taking care of us that evening. I prefer it that way.  

I decided on five stars based the pig ears and chicken Algarve, nice atmosphere, leisurely but attentive service and a modest bill: $59 for the four us with tax but before the tip and there was more than enough food.",3b5EsiTkqgdbxPXz7LfBpA,55,0,5,BgMiZSgE6YKAiO42WZvP0Q

I had to ask for bread for the table. 10 minutes later the owner showed up with a basket of what seem like microwaved roles that she probably bought for the grocery store next door. The fish was unseasoned. The salad DID NOT have dressing on it. The surf and turf was tasteless and had only 3 shrimps and badly cooked meat that was tough.

1) The sauce for the appetizers were extremely salty. We all had different appetizers, and they were all outrageously salty.  I picked my food out of the sauce to eat it. 

2) Lamb shank was good, not great. Grilled vegetables that accompanied it were cooked nicely however. White rice...was white rice. 

 I was excited for this evening, expecting big flavor profiles. I also want to support local businesses. Instead I ended up with a rather mediocre meal. Certainly not worth the final bill. Yelp really let me down on this one.",lIeTkArfBdFByShcU7zXAA,0,0,2,f1jvjwt8BJBr0juMsNEKAQ

706144,2014-05-09,13,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Bad news first: This isn't authentic Portuguese food.  The owners aren't Portuguese, put kielbasa in the ""caldo verde,"" and don't know how to spell bacalhau (or bras, or quite a few other Portuguese words...).  The kielbasa bit actually bothers me because they claim that it's real Portuguese chorizo. But I guess most Americans don't go to most ""Chinese"" restaurants wanting to eat authentic Chinese food, either.  
The staff are mostly eager to please (even if you expect them to really give you free drinks--this is a restaurant that's in it to make money.  They do want you to pay for that caparinha they said they were going to ""give"" you, if at the Happy Hour price.).  The restaurant is physically pleasant, and the food is decent, maybe even good if you don't know any better.    Just don't get too carried away with your fantasy that the food you're eating bears much resemblance at all to what you'd get in Portimao or Albufeira.",Ke2UApZbSV22Ril9PgJNBA,0,0,2,k_pSxivQqc1GE3DlTPrxJg

bar.  I would give it 3.5 stars if possible. 

I had Sopa Verde which is a Portuguese kale/potato/chorizo soup.  It was very good.  I then ordered what I thought was the calamari entre with fries, and got calamari with rice.  It was ok, but IMO needed some salt and pepper as it was a tad bit flat.  

I also ordered Vino Verde, which is a tart Portuguese white wine.  When the check arrived, I was invoiced for the calamari appetizer vs entre which saved some $.  A complaint was that the vino verde was 7 per glass.  That seemed very high, as this wine is tupically one that is in the 6-9$ / bottle range, so felt that was very excessive.  Also I yearned for bread which was not offered.  

I will for sure return, as I think that some if the glitches could be attributed to it recently opening.  The menu is very interesting.",v1l_5Rlgq6HN1UbWAAvrow,2,1,3,3shmGzTHn7tXWXsDzT6r_w

We lived in the Azores for 19 months and are very familiar with Portuguese food, we were not disappointed by the experience. First of all we were greeted at the door by Luby and shown to a great table. Our server did a great job of explaining things on the menu and pointed us in the right direction. We started out with a bottle of Vinho Verde and two appetizers; halloumi cheese and grilled calamari.  What a great start!  For our entree, we shared the Bacallau Assado and the grilled scallops. The cod fish was amazing with a little drizzle of balsamic vinegar and the scallops we the best I have ever had. Seriously, the scallops were like butter they were so rich and delicate. For desert we shared the flour less walnut chocolate cake and coffees (meia de leite and espresso). Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was stellar.

The service was very caring, which is so rare in the food service industry today.  Lastly, the milieu is clean, slightly upscale without becoming pretentious, and complements the food and service perfectly.

For the main course, the lamb shank was ""to die for.""  If you like lamb, get this.  It fell apart with a smooth buttery texture and topped with an amazing sauce. Finally the marscapone desert was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner.

If you want to pay for a thimble of rum served to you in a tiny shot glass yet having your liquor charged serpately from the soda in the glass this is the type of place for people not sophisticated in the art of being conned.

If you want your order to arrive before you are boyfriends or girlfriends and you don't mind eating your meal alone and if you don't mind that they put onions on things you tell them not to and if you don't mind looking at a very scared of waitress who appears as though she is going to be reprimanded by the disgruntled owners  for making a mistake and you don't mind sitting in a 95 degree room then this is the place for you but not for me also v the French fries were frozen but cooked but they were the frozen kind as well as the dinner bread rolls which came from a package at the local supermarket so once again if you like a frugal meal and a hot environment and pay for every extra you'll enjoy this place not for me.

If you like that they fall back on not knowing English when you order Bicardi and they bring you captain morgan and tell you that the bill says both Captain Morgan and yes it shows bicardi, but they don't carry bicardi but the computer too prints it out as bicardi enjoy your stay.  Finally when you ask for your check receipt because you realized they are going to over charge and over bill you guess what., they get upset and question why you want you receipt not only by the cashier, but also the owner.

We were the only ones in the restaurant but it was nice because Luby (sp?) and her staff were so attentive to us. She knew exactly who we were when we walked in and that we were having the 4 course meal. while we were there, there was a group of dancers practicing a dance for an event the next evening, so it was kind of cool getting dinner and a show. She said they have dance nights where diners can dance to salsa and other types of music.

She recommended that since we got our own choice for each course, that she just brings out one of each course option so we could try everything. I'm SO glad we did! Our first course was soup/salad. The soup was so delicious and the salad was simple but refreshing. She also recommended her house sangria, she told us she makes it herself so of course we had to try it. Now i'm not a drinker and i don't like wine, but this stuff was SOOOOO GOOOOD. it wasn't tart at all, it was perfectly sweet without being too sweet. it may be one of the top reasons i would visit again! after the soup and salad she brought out a plate of dolmares (rice stuffed grape leaves) and a plate of chorizo. they were delicious as well. our main seafood course was some grilled shrimp, calamari and some sort of fish, with a lemon garlic butter sauce and rice pilaf. holy cow, this seafood is to die for. the fish was perfectly moist, the squid wasn't chewy and the shrimp..... my boyfriend hates eating shrimp but he was bartering his fish for my shrimp pieces. the sauce was amazing. i'm salivating just thinking about the rice and fish with the sauce, it's so good! for the last course, she brought us baklava. my boyfriend had never had it before and he wasn't too sure about it, but after we each had a few bites he was asking if he could finish it. the food was great, the drinks were great and the service was wonderful.

i've never tried Portuguese food before this, and you can tell she makes everything with her heart and soul. Luby (sp?) was such a sweetheart to us, even when my boyfriend accidentally broke a wine glass and spilled sangria all over the floor and her leather chair! i have told so many people already about this place and i will be back here again to try her other dishes!",LGSpg7Wa8lx1yHYwpe845w,14,0,5,2tmeopX5c4nWyAn3chV5kw

1513548,2016-06-27,5,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Growing up in Hawaii, the only thing I knew of Portuguese cuisine were Portuguese sausage (linguisa), Portuguese sweet bread (pan duce), and of course Malasadas (sugar-coated fried dough) from Leonard's. So, when I found a Portuguese restaurant (the only one in Vegas) on Yelp! I was intrigued and immediately bookmarked it. My Brother and his friend were in town, so, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to check this place out...

Vila Algarve is located on the corner of Trop & Jones alongside the Smith's, facing Jones (big 'ol sign, can't miss it). The first thing you notice when you walk in is that their dining room tables surround a pretty big dance floor (dancing? Um, no). The waiter led us to our table and took our drink order...everyone else, Sangria...me, I've always wanted to try a Caipirinha. A Portuguese cocktail with sugarcane syrup,lime, and a shot of either rum, vodka, or tequila...made mine a virgin (don't drink alcohol anymore). Waiter brought it to me with a shot of vodka anyway, was like a lemon-lime slush, quite refreshing. Everyone else raved about the Sangria.

The owner came out to greet us and asked if we had any questions about the menu and then explained the way some of the dishes were prepared, which she really took a lot of pride in...the menu had a lot of great sounding foods to choose from, frog legs? Snails anyone? No? There were four of us, so we went family-style and chose a couple of apps and shared a couple of Main dishes. We started with the grilled Halloumi cheese, never had grilled cheese (except a grilled cheese sandwich ). It was served with a Piri-piri sauce (a kind of chili sauce, more spicy than hot) for dipping, super delicious. Next up was the Portuguese Chorizo, which was presented to us in a flaming ceramic pig and sliced up table side. Awesome char and flavor...I wanted to take that pig grill home! Then came the Dolmades  (Rice stuffed grape leaves) and the grilled Calamari. Both amazing, the Dolmades had a Gorgonzola (I think...)cheese sauce that took it over the top and calamari was prepared perfectly.

On to the main courses, the wife ordered the grilled Sea Bass...served with a buttery cream sauce and grilled veggies. Best sea bass I've ever had, the wife loved it too. My brother ordered the Algarve potatoes...very flavorful fried potatoes topped with a very cheesy and creamy mushroom sauce, superb. My brother's friend got the chicken curry, it was yellow coconut milk curry, no heat, but with a lot of flavor. It was also served with the awesome piri-piri sauce on the side for added spiciness. As if we weren't getting full enough, I had to order the Seafood Paella...which I believe was the the best dish of the night, the saffron rice mixed with peas, bell peppers, onions, chicken chunks, chorizo, and mussels and huge prawns...soooo good! Had to skip dessert because of that, ah well next time.

So, what have we learned...Portuguese food is more than Malasadas. The dishes have a lot of Spanish / Mediterranean influences. Piri-piri sauce and the Sangria is bomb...and my wife will never try frog legs or snails.

Vila Algarve has great food, service and staff...my wife might come back for the free dance lessons...me, I'll be back for dessert.",rkZ_FQ1yWxPOm3JCv_wKwQ,15,7,4,FAFGHxAKKTemzSpiEuwIRw

1624180,2014-04-23,65,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Stopped in here for dinner recently. I'd just say I'd never return. I don't understand how this place as a 5 star rating based off the food & service I ate/received. Service was horribly slow & there was only about 5 other people in the large dining room. They kept saying it will be slow because ""everything is made to order."" Well we would all hope that most restaurants we visit make our food to order rather than from a box. Fast food we expect from a box not food at a sit down restaurant. Tried the snails & they were covered in some heavy creamy white sauce (which I realize the menu stated) & could not taste nothing but creamy white sauce. Also tried the chicken Livers & chicken Gizzards. Liver was so so. It should have been soaked in milk longer to remove the liver taste. Gizzard just tasted like beef stew. I used to work in a venue that cooked the chicken lives, gizzards & hearts & I actually liked them - didn't have the gross taste that most places do as they were prepared correctly & seasoned just perfectly. Tried a chicken appetizer & it was just plain. Tried the chorizo & honestly tasted like stuff I've grilled before. Wasn't worth the $6.50 for it. Ordered the pork kabob & pork was so over cooked & dry. Only parts that were any decent were the parts that had a bit of fat on it so it gave it a bit of moisture. Honestly I make better pork at home. There was not even any Portuguese seasoning on the pork. Plate had steamed green peppers, onions & carrots with it that were over cooked & mushy instead of tender crisp. I do have to say at least the seasoning on the veggies made them edible even if they were mushy. French fries or plain white rice came with the dish as well. Opted for the french fries as plain white rice is not appealing to me. Fries tasted like they were from the freezer section at the local grocery store. Their saving grace was they were hot from the fryer so the salt stuck to them when I salted them. Music was much too loud we had to shout at each other. Sadly I really don't have much good to say about this place & unfortunately based on my dining experience I would never return.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,5,2,2,pU_RPI_bG5M15hCPy4LNVg

It was very good. I just wasn't really in the mood to drink. So I had water. She brought a bottle water but I noticed it wasn't on the bill. So that was very nice. I tried the happy hour menu. Everything on it is $5.99. I had the snails, halloumi cheese, mini espetadas, and the battered cod. It was all very good. My favorite was the cod. The batter was so crispy and flaky on the outside and the fish on the inside was so soft it melted in your mouth. It came on a bed of creamy rice. At first I thought it was risotto. Then I thought it might be grits. So then I asked her and she said it was rice. I was almost tempted to lick the plate it tasted so good. It complimented the cod quite nicely. My least favorite thing I tried was the halloumi cheese. Tasted like string cheese to me that you didn't string to eat. I probably wouldn't order it again. It came with a spicy red sauce that she told me they make it there from scratch. It was pretty good. I also had the snails which were covered in melted butter and came with some toast. Tasted very similar to shrimp. I would probably get those again. And the mini espetadas was delicious. It was white meat chicken on a skewer with a very tiny salad on the plate. The salad didn't have any dressing. The chicken was the juiciest white meat chicken I've ever tasted. You could just see the juices falling out of it. I normally don't like white meat because every time I eat it it is dry, but not this chicken. I would definitely recommend trying it. Especially if you are a fan of white meat chicken to begin with. I had great service, afterall I was the only person in there. And my check came with a mint which was nice.

2010546,2015-11-27,10,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Hole in the wall from the outside, fantastic Portuguese food and service that treats you like you're family- Vila Algarve is so much more than I expected! Tucked away in an odd strip mall, the space has a bar and a dining room with a dance floor, live music and dance lessons, and some seriously bomb food.

HOUSE BREAD & SPREAD: Rolls are freshly oven-warmed and crisp, yogurt-eggplant spread is like a light version of babaghanoush, really tasty.
HOUSE MADE CHORIZO: Nicely seasoned with a little bit of spice, you gotta get this for the presentation: served flaming and cut tableside from a pig-shaped plate that is equal parts cute and tasty. Almost didn't get this but glad we did.
GRILLED HALLOUMI: Squeaky cheese with a spicy-zesty dipping sauce. I can't say I'm too familiar with this kind of cheese, and it seems best eaten before it cools too much, but I enjoyed trying this.
SNAILS: Different preparation than usual, served in a cream sauce with cheese and toast, but still quite a tasty way to enjoy these critters. Ask for extra bread, portion is larger than expected and very saucy. I'm a sucker for the more common garlic-wine sauce preparation but was pleased with this version!
GRILLED SARDINES: BF's pick. he loved them, I would have rather opted for the calamari. Served with grilled peppers, onions, and garlic, a quartet of petite grilled fish were served in a sea of olive oil. Add some of the table balsamic to brighten up the flavors a bit.
SEAFOOD PAELLA: Sharable $30 portion with three large shrimp, a few mussels, squid, chorizo, and chicken, with a soft saffron rice with only a slight bit of spice. Great version of a favorite dish, would get again.
CHOCOLATE CAKE: BF insisted on dessert, this cake had a nicely balanced flavor that wasn't too sugary. Unfortunately this seems to be kept refrigerated (and perhaps at too low of a temperature), resulting in an odd dryness throughout. This is served with fresh whipped cream.

Food was delightful, service was incredibly personable- one lovely lady was handling all four dinnertime tables, assisted by two staff. Meal was a leisurely pace, dishes were appropriately coursed, and by the end of our meal we were making notes for our selections for our next visit and hugging the owner as we walked out the door. A neighborhood gem.

2052034,2016-02-07,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Yum!

I discovered this restaurant through Meetup.

Drink(s): Caipirinha and a shot of the red Sangria to taste
Appetizer: Soup of the Day = Caldo Verde
Entree: Paella - Portugese Style
Dessert: Algarve Mascarpone Roll

The cocktail was so refreshing with the perfect amount of sweet adding tiny bits of lime and lemon in finely blended ice.  As I had to drive home immediately afterwards, I was offered a shot of Lubey's homemade Sangria which is now on my to-drink list when I return for their nightly dancing classes.

The soup of the day was a very tasty kale soup perfected with so much flavor.  If you don't order anything else, you must try this soup. Yum!

Paella is mostly a seafood dish atop saffron rice.  You'll get shrimp, calamari, mussels, chorizo sausage,and chicken flavored to perfection slow cooked with green bell peppers, onions, peas, and tomatoes.

The Mascarpone Roll was a perfect ending - a fluffy ball of vanilla ice cream atop ""three turning fan blades"" of mascarpone and dotted with fresh blueberries and blueberry sauce.

We started with a homemade Sangria and it was amazing. 'The Caldo Verde' (green soup) & 'Flamed Chorizo' were also spectacular. Snail Escargots were out of this world! I have never tried them before, so I was a little afraid of ruining my appetite, but no regrets.

As my entrée, I decided on the 'Bacalhou  Asado' (grilled cod fish) which was delicious (I have never had it grilled). My husband enjoyed the Paella, my oldest had the beef espetada, second oldest tried the lamb shank and my youngest chose ribeye steak over eggs and ham. Nothing that was brought to us was short of spectacular.

The owner was also our hostess and she made sure we felt at home. Her service and attention to detail was as spectacular as the food was; she also complimented the amazing experience with a delicious shot from her home country for the entire family in celebration of my birthday.

Unique look when you walk in. Large dance floor, band set up at the end of the room & tables around the dance floor. No band when we were there, but we were told they do ballroom dancing, Salsa, Tango & have instructors available. Sounds Fun!!!

Luba is the owner & she came over to go thru the menu with us. We ordered some home-made Sangria and  a reasonably priced red wine which she recommended.  Both were very good & easy to recommend. 

Luba went thru the starters menu & she was really generous with her time and gave us some great information about each starter. We ordered so many starters that we decided to just do that first & see if we were full after eating those. 

We started with the flaming piggy dish in the pic. The Portuguese Chorizo sausage which was being seared by the flame was crisp & flavorful, with a home-made sauce which was very acidic and interesting. We all shared it & everyone liked it. 

Next came the snails in cheese.  Such large snails drenched in a wonderful white cheese sauce. We had a good fight over this fish. Soooo good!

Octopus... We stretched our minds & tried this at Luba's urging.  It was very, very tasty. It disappeared quickly. 

Toasted Goat cheese.  Wow Wow Wow. I can still taste it & it make me want to go back soon. 

We did not love the kale soup... Luba said a lot of people do.  Kale is an acquired taste for sure.  It is a little bland in my opinion. Tastes healthy.

Gargantuan Oyster... Mild, sweet and SO FRESH! You will have to cut some of them into pieces. Not kidding! These oysters are HUGE! 

Deserts. We tried the chocolate cake... Really good. It disappeared.  Baclava with ice cream. We ordered extra ice cream & enjoyed it with both dishes & alone.

2416671,2014-02-20,3,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Another new business that I just couldn't wait to open. Vegas kind of lacks in Portuguese restaurants so when I noticed that Vila Algarve was opening up I had to go. It's located in the old Sushi Factory spot in a plaza on the NW corner of Tropicana and Jones. It's a very spacious place. They've been open for only a couple weeks but I don't think many people know since the 2 times I've been there no one was there, for lunch and dinner.

Opening up the menu you can either read the very delicious sounding descriptions or look at the very delicious looking pictures.  You can even ask the very friendly staff if they had any recommendations. I wanted everything and just started ordering, my eyes and my stomach were not on the same page. They have Portuguese chicken livers and giblets, Portuguese sausages, snails and frog legs, various pastas, curries, skewered meats, steaks, seafood, wraps, and desserts. I was told they use less seasoning in some of their food than usual to appeal to the people but they'll make it spicier if you wanted.

The Trinchado, from their menu were ""Cubes of meat marinated in red wine, grilled to perfection, cooked with trinchado creamy sauce and olives with pits, served with toasted bread."" How do you not order it. It was good. I liked the creamy sauce and meat was perfect. Be aware that the olives are with pits and the pits are no joke when your teeth whack it. I'd order it again. There's an appetizer version and a full meal version.

The Halloumi Cheese, from their menu was ""cyrpus grilled goat cheese, served with sweet and sour or peri peri sauce."" It was really salty and pretty good. Seems like it would be good with some beer. Eat it right away and don't let it cool down to much cause it gets hard. 

The Dobrada Portuguesa was ""slow cooked ox tripe and broiled with mixed cheese."" It was my favorite of the 3 items I've ordered. You either like tripe or dislike tripe and I like tripe covering it with cheese makes it even better. The smell is strong.

The interior is nice and clean with a big screen TV. The staff is very friendly and did everything right.

What to expect after I write this review beside my multiple check-ins and picture posting? They're in the process of getting their liquor license. They already have a nice bar area setup as soon as they get to fill it with liquor and serve it up the better. They have what looked like a setup for live music. They have a lot of potential. I'd be back.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,52,7,4,njyFbS92cbbt5A5hP_dvmA
2421891,2014-09-23,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"This is my first time trying Portuguese seafood and I was impressed, considering by the end of happy hour you're looking at $15-$20 a person.  While it may look more like a locals joint, it taste like it should be a traveler's destination for foodies. They start you off with bread and their special fish egg dill sauce, which is above expectation. The sangria is delicious. $4 gets you two servings unless you're an alcoholic. The chorizo is super flavorful. Mussels were cheesy and savory, though it only comes in three. There's some stranger type meats like snails, ox tripe and deep fried pig ears for the food adventurer. Most of their dishes come in a very well seasoned cheesy white sauce. My favorite would be the shrimp tail.

Yes it's empty, but I believe it's because it's in the wrong neighborhood. It appears causal, but it tastes fancy.",4eEHF1IaEl8eTWS8YrMn8g,51,1,5,xI0GId2ACZnDxJCjHnqpBA

2511076,2017-12-18,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Vila Algarve shares its name (perhaps strangely) with the former headquarters of the Portuguese Secret Police in Mozambique. I always like Portuguese food, but this place is one of my favorites, perhaps because of the influence from Mozambique. The flavors are stronger than most Portuguese, and more complex in a complementary way. There is even a small section of the menu with authentic dishes from Mozambique. Excellent food, although the lack of a liquor license (and by extension Portuguese Green Wine) is too bad. 

Suggestion-wise, I doubt there is Pallela on the entire Iberian Peninsula that comes close. The Bitoque steak and Portuguese Chorizo (Lenguiça) is also excellent. I haven't tried anything from the Mozambique section, but next time I probably will.

Also worth noting is that the atmosphere is kinda weird, but not necessarily in a bad way. I was shorted $5 change, but probably not on purpose.",3ivG_RMR7cCRA9xYUNVR-A,9,0,5,9R1jzc_QyyUk7iyt_UyGXg

The meals do take a while to get served so plan on being here a bit (which was fine with us).  We ordered the Algarve chicken and chicken Espetadas - both were really good.

The initial transformation to an 80's cabaret was oddly the least disturbing part of this restaurant. Upon entering we were asked to sign in and ""donate"" 10 dollars each for the band. In all my dining experience have I ever been asked to pay for the entertainment and the donation was not optional as we were instructed we had to pay before being seated. Ignoring the urge to leave then, we were seated where the waitress explained a few dishes. We never received any bread that is pictured in all of the reviews, the mussels appetizer consisted of 5 total, and cheese appetizer though not bad, was pretty salty. Our entrees did not make up for the poor start. A poor rendition of chucascaria style meat, overly sweet curry shrimp, and completely undressed salads left much to be desired.

But don't let the above description fool you. I came back here twice in the week I first tried it. The food is definitely good. The wait staff even better. Also i'm not accustomed to this type of cuisine so therefore my review might be too judgmental.

We stared with s glass of the house made sangria; I usually avoid sangria due to high sugar. This was refreshing and not overly sweet. We decided to try some appetizers and share an entree 

First up was the Portuguese chorizo - amazing. Be sure to dip your bread in the peri-peri sauce. Or, just use a spoon - it's that good.  Loved the flaming pig presentation. 

I was dubious on the mussels but boy was I wrong. They were plump and the sauce was flavorful. Again, dip your bread. 

I might be ordering the trinchado as a main instead of an appetizer it was that good. The chicken was moist and the sauce...wait for it...so good you have to sop it up with the toast.  Yes, there's a trend here. 

We shared the seafood paella and our only disappointment was that there was no crispy rice.  The flavor was on point and the serving large.

We didn't come here for tango lesson but everybody else here was in for the tango lesson. The tango teacher, Fred asked us to join the tango, but we are not ""tango people"" so I said no.

We ordered Bulgarian salad and Vila platter for two. The waitress and one of the owners Luby was super nice. She explained about all kinds different Portuguese food. She was such a nice person, super nice. I really hate to give her restaurant low star review...

The salad... Fresh tomatoes,  fresh green bell pepper slices, fresh onion slices. Fresh shredded goat cheese on top. Delicious. We enjoyed it.

Vila platter for two... To tiny lobster tail (like you would get in Smith's or Albertsons), six shrimps (tough and hard), about six tiny pieces of calamari(chewy like rubber), two fried cod, two green mussels and tiny portion of white rice. Everything was previously frozen, of course. Even tasted frozen especially the lobster tail. $69.99. Really?!! This dish doesn't even fill one person up. Way over priced. 

We were still hungry after finished the dish but didn't feel like ordering another item after all that experience. If you have active mom or aunt, I'm sure they would enjoy the $10 tango class and the buffet. Tango class till 12 am. We will not return.

Only one other table would show up within the hour or so that we were there.

For the food, we tried a cheesy tripe dish, portuguese sausage, and a chicken curry. Whether or not it was a bad night or the food quality has gone down, everything was quite bland. For example, the chicken in the curry tasted good at first, but once getting to the center of the chicken, it was basically tasteless. 

We also got some complimentary bread and oil with balsamic vinegar, but even the bread tasted somewhat stale and flavorless.

I do hope that the restaurant is able to find some success, but I simply wasn't impressed with the food that night.

The service was sort of blunt and pushy for my friends' point of view. It was our first time and didn't have much idea of the menu or what to expect. The idea of Portuguese/French/seafood sounds AMAZING but left us short of our expectations. I was on not impressed but satisfied with the beef espetada (I think that's it).  Also they don't offer complimentary bread. It's $1 per loaf which comes with a dip but it's NOT on the menu. **Also! It was a Saturday night and there were tango classes during dinner which was actually very nice. Enjoyed the music and watching the dancers.",UUZZ2D_W4zvM87BZNIOHKQ,0,1,3,bB_pjIEe6enBkHbUIh04sg

Noticed that the decor was nice and fresh. Very open and spacious area. Could easily accommodate several large parties. Was seated by a very nice blonde lady who was more than happy to make our first time experience amazing. Studying all the pictures on Yelp, I knew exactly what I was going to order. Started with the Portuguese pork sausage that came prepared in a flaming pig dish. The sausage had great flavor and a perfectly crispy flamed char to it. Next dish was the Halloumi cheese which has a great flavor on its own. Add in the spicy sauce to kick the cheese up a notch. Moved on to the escargot in a nice cheesy cream sauce. First time eating snails and got to say they taste like cooked mushrooms. The main dish was the paella. This dish can easily feed two people. Didn't really like the peel and eat shrimp. Made the fingers stained with a yellow color and was very messy. This dish had a few simplistic flavors. Used the sauce from the Halloumi cheese dish to add a spicy flare of flavor. To end the meal, the blonde lady suggested a homemade tiramisu. Happy for the suggestion because it was easily the best tiramisu in Vegas! Great experience that ended with a hug from the blonde lady.

3973310,2014-02-24,4,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Four of us met here for lunch so that we could try several dishes to try Portuguese food.  The owner, Lubka, told us it was the only Portuguese restaurant in Las Vegas.  

We were brought rolls and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered several starters to share.  First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.

Next, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. 

Next came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.

Next was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.

Then onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.

Then we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.

When we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and 
coffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.

Service was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  

This was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.  Thanks to LJ and Niyen for the heads up on Vila Algarve.  I certainly expect to come back soon. I have to try some of their chicken livers and gizzards.  We opted not to do the organ meats yesterday.

The snails have a garlicky cheese sauce and were amazing, must try.  

In an attempt to find a cheese I had in Portugal I got their grilled cheese with the peri peri sauce.  It's not bad worth a try.

Sardines, one of the waitresses recommended adding balsamic to these and wow it was great.

The gizzards with a gravy, now these are chicken gizzards and have a beef tasting gravy.  It really didn't do it for me.  Beef and chicken two separate flavors that need to be separate.

The paella well it was soupy and tomato based need I say more.",54zqyneshZvyWymZLE6mJw,5,2,4,biiktD7bmuu_6PI86iaYcw

Bookmarking Vila a few weeks back I finally got here to an empty restaurant! I thought it was a little strange, that was until we met the Lubka!!! That's where our experience took off!!! After being sat and shown the menus we decided to go with all recommendations from the waitress and owner.

Starting off with some great house made sangria we ordered the Portuguese Chorizo and Snails! Wow..... These 2 starters we're simply brilliant, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!!!

For our mains we ordered Portuguese Steak and Paella Portuguese style. Both were great, my favorite  had to be the Paella. It seemed a little like a southern style dish I've had before just with out the spice.

Now this is where Vila Algarve shines from the menu Desert: Mascarpone and Home Make Cake.... I don't know how to explain these 2, other than Epic!!!! I'm dead serious Epic!!! Texture, flavor and simply outstanding!! 

I would also like to say Vila is a very kid friendly restaurant with High chairs and a small menu for kids. The staff were fantastic with my one year old. Also they said they encourage people to bring along there little ones.

Also after 8pm they have some nice love music. I did say at the start of this review it was empty, once 7p came around the place started filling up quick.

This restaurant is going to take off!!! Having a very international staff and grounding in what it takes to make genuine European food, Vila Algarve is high end food with group and family like atmosphere...

Vila Algrave has something for everyone!  I'm doing low-carb, and was easy to find friendly dishes for my diet.  A friend, who is a much more adventurous eater, loved the options of chicken liver, chicken giblets, pig ear, tripe, and more!  

We went in last Friday at 7:30.  One diner inside and a group of guys enjoying the patio seating.  As others have stated, everything is made fresh or in-house, so expect to take 1.5-2 hours for your meal.  Luby, the owner, was thorough in explaining the preparation and flavors of all the dishes.   Also, almost everything is grilled, adding another level of flavor.

The Portuguese Chorizo presentation is amazing, and tasted very good; it's different than Mexican chorizo.  The Algarve jumbo shrimps (12 of them!) came hanging on a skewer, much like a Brazilian steakhouse.  Their grilled flavor and the Chardonnay garlic sauce worked very well together. For the entree I had the Espetada 12-Oz-marinade, four pieces of sirloin in a slightly salty marinade.  I used some of the Chardonnay garlic sauce to cut the saltiness.  The girls swooned over the Algarve Mascarpone roll!  I believe they both used ""Mouthgasm"" to describe the dessert.

Bread came with this eggplant yogurt sauce. Grilled bread, great sauce, so tasty.
To start we had the sardines, snails, and the chorizo. All had really good flavor I didn't think cheese and cream would work with snails, but it really works. Chorizo, served in a flaming pig for presentation, was delicious. Sardines I've liked since I was a kid. Though a little bit oily, then still had that great sardine flavor. We also split the paella.

The cooked beef tastes great, and it comes with toasted bread perfect for dipping because the sauce...is delicious! Practically had us wiping the plate with our fingers.

I am a pasta man, so I ordered the Algarve Chicken Pasta. If you are a fan of Fettucini Alfredo dishes, this will be right up your alley. Once again, I was using bread to scoop up all that tasty pasta sauce. My lady ordered the Beef Espetadas. Very yummy pieces of beef sliced, and placed on a skewer. We gobbled it up like m&ms. A very filling dish. Comes with a side of vegetables/fries. To top it off, the owner gave us our first ""dessert shots"". I forgot the name of the dish but if she mentions it, do not sleep! It is a flavorful mix of mint, alcohol, and deliciousness. Next time I come back to the restaurant I will also like to try the Paella!

As much as I love eating at Vila Algarve, I do have a couple complaints. When it comes to extras, please expect to be charged for everything. This includes water and A1 steak sauce.

Service:  Luby is the owner and told us she runs it with her family. She is very outgoing and a bit boisterous. She gave us a lot of suggestions and came back to check if we liked the food. The waitress helping serve drinks was not as attentive and we ran out of water a few times. 

Food:  there were good dishes, decent dishes, and pretty bland dishes. 
Here's what I ordered or tasted--
Fried GOAT CHEESE - 4/5 - I liked this. It was salty, but the sweet sauce they served it with, countered it nicely.
CHORIZO - 5/5 - This is nothing like typical Central/South American chorizo, this is more like a smoked sausage. It was yummy!!!

All of our dishes were homemade and because we ate family style, I got to try 8 dishes and 3 appetizers.  My top three dishes were Mozambique Shrimp Curry, Steak Tranache, and the Paella.   The chicken curry, seafood pasta, and chorizo were worth ordering again but not the best I have had.  The measure of all Portuguese food is the Peri-Peri--the Peri-Peri is more spicy than buttery.  The Peri-Peri sauce went well on the Chicken, mixed with the curry, and as a topping for the oysters.  Eat up, drink Sangria, and dance the night away.",zIeJWo0uZaWBJEBxlWdaMg,11,0,5,0i7gfNDfoIzWW-sErd56yQ

4843284,2015-10-12,32,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"Questionable.  That's the keyword of tonight's dinner at Vila Algarve.  Yelp is usually pretty accurate about the star-rating system, but Vila Algarve's 4.5 stars (as of 10.11.15) is extremely questionable.  

I don't want to bash on this restaurant since it's locally owned, but there was nothing 4.5 star about this restaurant.  We had wanted to like this place; it was actually one of my bookmarks!  However, the other negative reviews about this restaurant resonate how I feel.  

Our table had the calamari and chorizos as the appetizers.  They were neither spectacular or fantastic.  They were just ok... 

For our entrees, we had the paella ($29), bacalhau ($25), seafood pasta (~$22?) and the butter fish (it was the special; not sure how much it was).  The paella and the butter fish were probably the best dishes, relatively speaking.  The shredded bacalhau was, no offense, basically cat food.  

And I know what you're thinking, who would order seafood pasta at a Portuguese restaurant???  Well, I was told by Ruby, one of the owners, that their ""homemade village sauce"" is spectacular and a must-try.  So, we ordered the seafood pasta.  It was like tomato cream sauce tainted by some unidentifiable ingredients...  

The pasta was actually cold when it arrived at our table.  We had to send it back so they can microwave it to warm it up...  

All in all, the food was sub-par and the service was slow (due to the fact ""it's cooked fresh"").  They had a live jazz band when we were there.  While that usually means a fun time, it was simply too loud at such a small venue.  We couldn't hear ourselves think!  So, it is questionable that they have a 4.5 star rating.  It's also questionable rather this is authentic Portuguese food.

I recently tried the food here and was not impressed. I ordered the seafood pasta which was a huge portion. Probably could feed 3. The price was around $15.
The first thing I noticed about the dish was how salty the sauce was. This was seriously the most salty sauce I have ever tried!! The saltiness completely killed the dish for me. I let my friend have the rest of my dish because I gave up trying to enjoy it and she was also shocked by the saltiness. 
The seafood inside was cooked just fine. Maybe could have been cooked a little less and the noodles also just fine. 
One thing I didn't like was the upsell on drinks. When I eat out I like to order tap water with lemon. They said they don't give free water and only sell it by the bottle. -_-. I ended up purchasing a CAN of soda (means no refills) for $3.50! 
If you're going to serve food that salty, you should at least provide ice water so I'm not dehydrated after the meal. 

I'll be back here but just for the dancing and maybe a glass of wine or cocktail here. I will not come here for  the food! The gross pasta dish and the no free water policy completely scared me away.",XOCyTfXy26xi4gZeun9v9w,3,1,2,gJTldAqACeYxrIoJOGVBLg

The 'house-made' Sangria was pleasant enough, but not out of this world. The salad was also suitable, but nothing special. The chicken livers were wonderful - an acquired taste, presented well and flavored mildly. 

The paella was a bit disappointing. First, it needs to be served ""hot"", not room temperature. The ingredients are terrific, but the preparation was off the mark. Chicken and chorizo must be cooked throughly, which they were, but perhaps off to the side and added in. The mussels were so-so, but not terrible. Calamari and baby octopus need garlic and olive oil in a separate saute, added to the chicken, chorizo & rice - with the prawns added at the last minute. These prawns were over-coocked and hard to extract from the shells.

All this said, I'll try Vila Algarve again with different selections. Has promise. Hoping for the best.",h9stsH2vvCmhwHdfkc_1kw,1,1,3,4Sj3r40JS8exvTge0cKnww

House Sangria made with a hearty port + lots of fruit.  Smooth and just right.  

Next we moved to the soup, Caldo Verde - it was a bowl, not a cup and it was pretty fabulous with baby kale and potatoes pureed plus some chorizo and a drizzle of olive oil on top.  We knew we shouldn't, but we finished our soup - too good!

Dolmades were excellent and the white sauce was unique.  House made Chorizo was lightly spiced.

Entrée was a big plate of perfectly grilled calamari, shrimp, fish and veggies with a side of rice.  Everything was perfectly done and perfectly seasoned.

Desert was a baklava.  Super sweet.

I understand going to Portugal will always dominate but I feel this is the best its going to get in Las Vegas.

Started off with Sangria, with the Trinchado pork original as an appetizer it tasted delicious. The pork was cooked evenly with the sauce.
I've never had Paella before, based on the reviews I wanted to try it. I'm glad I did, it was really good. The flavors reminded me of chicken curry.

I loved the Mascarpone roll with blueberry jam and vanilla ice cream!
The service from Kali was awesome, she was knowledgeable about the food and friendly.

I feel as though I've just had an authentic taste of Portugal here in Las Vegas.
We were looking for a nice reasonable steakhouse meal that had seafood options and was affordable (we had just spent $80 at The Luxor earlier this week for two appetizers, two bowls of soup, and a beer!).
And we distinctly wanted to dine AWAY from the strip. This spot was PERFECT for lunch...we had the place to ourselves as there were no other tables there. Our hostess/waitress is the co-owner, her husband and son are the cooks...truly a family run operation and absolutely STELLAR!
I started with one pound of prawns/shrimp...soooo insanely good in a garlic butter sauce.
We also split a Mediterranean salad. And we both had the 12 oz steak (mine med rare, his medium).
It was all so good we came back to our hotel and immediately told the front desk about our meal - hoping to get this place listed in our hotel's binder of local restaurants that is in each room in the hotel...everyone should know about this place (they shouldn't be empty for lunch)!
I'll be going back while I'm in Las Vegas!
Do yourself a favor and check this place out!

Also, had a delicious glass of their sangria and ended the meal with chocolate cake...mmmm

My favorite dishes here had to be the snails appetizer and the sausage. Oh yeah and the soup was delish. We also ordered the seafood platter but it basically had the same sauce as the snails. It was a mushroom Alfredo sauce with a lot of cheese. Don't get me wrong I'm a cheese lover but I felt the cooking was played safe.

The price kind of blew me away because we were charged $80 just for the seafood platter. 2 little lobster tails, about 8 shrimps, 2 fried fish fillets, 2 mussels. Definitely not worth it for that price I would've thrown in some crab legs to justify that price.

5226678,2014-10-28,10,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"I so badly wish that this place would open up in Portland. It just doesn't make sense that we don't have a Vila Argave. When you're seated here, you're asked if this is your first time in the restaurant. There's a good reason for that, so be patient, because when you say that it's your first time, they will give you a very thorough explanation of the menu, but only after bringing you the complimentary breads and spreads that start you off to a wonderful experience. 

It might feel for just a moment that the explanations of the menu items are wordy or lengthy- they're not. It's just that there's a LOT to choose from, and some of them are things that might be a bit ""exotic"" for the good ol' 'merkin. There are snails, among other things. They look absolutely delicious though, and next time, we will try them. This time, we tried the calamari. 

One of the brilliant features of Vila is that barely ANYTHING is fried. The calamari comes in a light, delicious cream sauce over herbed rice. It is mouth-watering, and we damn-near impaled eachother with forks over the last piece. I don't know if we'll ever have the CHANCE to try the snails, because the calamari is so craveable. 

Claire ordered the marinated grilled Portuguese chicken, and I tried it. It was marvelous. Something to know about this selection- if you order it, be comfortable with a 20 minute or more wait. This is NOT KFC. The chicken is cooked fresh when you order it. As a result, it is spectacular. Get over yourself. 

I ordered the seafood pasta, and I'm not sure, at this point, that I'd be able to bring myself to order anything else. Rather than a heavy alfredo, as most restaurants tend to serve over their seafood pastas, this selection is adorned with a creamy, tomato sauce akin to vodka sauce (my mouth was too full to ask exactly what it was, and to be perfectly honest, I don't care). This is by far the best pasta dish I have had from any restaurant. Especially with seafood. The scallops in my dish tasted extremely fresh. Everything did, really. 

What would I change about this place? Absolutely nothing. Except that it's in Las Vegas and not Portland. The owner is a magnificent human being who engages her clientele for feedback so she knows what to nip and tuck about her establishment. The night that we came in was a karaoke night, and I will not hesitate to mention that this place is not only gay friendly, but it absolutely EMBRACES the gay community.

Located in a sprawling space at the corner of Tropicana and Jones where proprietor Lubka (Luby) greeted us with a smile at the door as her husband, Ross, tended to the kitchen it would be difficult to imagine a more charming first impression of a new restaurant than the one with which I walked away from Vila Algarve on Saturday afternoon.  Empty save for one other table at our 2pm arrival and featuring a diverse menu anchored in rich Portuguese traditions with all stocks, sauces, and spice blends made in house it was with a small amount of experience in the region's cuisine that our quartet perused the options but with staff more than willing to engage, discuss, and suggest despite significant language barriers the seven items selected all proved not only well prepared and presented, but also highly educational and thoroughly enjoyable.  Skipping over seemingly out-of-place pizzas and pastas, though we were assured that these too are common to the cuisine, and focusing instead on the items favored by Luby as well as personal tastes it was with dense, warm milk bread that we began and with plates coursed out one-by-one appetizers commenced with lightly spiced Portuguese chorizo, ablaze on presentation and smoky with a snappy kielbasa-esque flavor, followed by squeaky griddled Halloumi with house-made sweet and sour serving to balance the brine.  Moving next to tender snails in thick garlic cream it was fourth that the primary reason for my visit arrived and living up to high hopes the milk-soaked and shredded preserved cod was perfect as two large cylinders arrived featuring ample salinity balanced by smashed potatoes, eggs, and subdued aromatics to form something rich, rustic, and satisfying...something I routinely seek out elsewhere now done well in my own back yard.  Rounding out the savories with two more richly sauced proteins including snappy squid in bright curry and tender chicken with notes of cumin, paprika, and something citrus perfuming the palate it was with full stomachs that Luby compelled us to order dessert, the tiramisu made by herself that morning, and whether 'traditional' or not I'm uncertain but either way the scoop of light mascarpone and bold coffee was much like the rest of the afternoon - delicious, comfortable, and served with gracious smiles and requests to come back soon, something I've no doubt the bacalao will compel.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,64,7,5,gVID7N6pDCnYFmPsgAnq8Q

    We started off with the sangria, which was just as good as the one when I was in Spain. Which should speak volumes. She explained how she made this sangria from scratch herself. She explained the menu and her specialties. If your hesitant to try different things due to taste or texture, don't be here. You can't go wrong. WE started with the snails, we were both hesitant. Let me tell you this was the BEST dish either of us had ever had. They tasted like mushrooms, and the sauce was HEAVENLY. We had to ask for extra bread to wipe the plate clean. Wow!
     For our main plate we had Paella and Lamb shank. Let's start with the paella, the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Best tasting shrimp again either of us have ever had. The calamari was a great combo of tender and firm. The lamb shanks were a huge portion, they fell right off of the bone. Usually with lamb you get a gamey taste, there was no hint of that. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked. With just the most amazing taste. 
   At this point in the meal were both stuffed, we really debated on having desert. But honestly the rest of the meal was literally the best meal we've had, so we HAD TO GET DESERT. The waitress let us know their specialty was the marscapone roll with a blueberry homemade sauce. It literally looks like pate with blueberries, all I have to say is O M G. RIDICULOUS.

The host/ owner was kind hearted and passionate about the food of her homeland and it definitely came through in her incredible recipes! Highly recommended!

5656539,2018-05-06,3,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"This was our first dive into Portuguese cuisine. My dad heard about this place and we all decided to go. First off, we based our decision on the photos of food here on Yelp! and the photos of the menu. It really did look and sound delicious. Or first setback, the menu you see on here (and prices) are NOT the same as what you get in the restaurant. DO NOT BE FOOLED. The menu we were given inside is less options and double to triple the price of what's shown here in Yelp. There's no tapas whatsoever. We were greeted at the door by some big sweaty guy in street clothes (tshirt and shorts), turned out he was the cook. Then we were served our food by another guy with shoulder length hair sticking out if a baseball cap and, yet again, shorts and tshirt.. guess he's the cooks helper, bus boy, and trash guy. The food we did try was decent (based off the general taste of food), I cannot compare to other Portuguese restaurants. Simply going off my 16 years of culinary experience. The other thing that was confusing is their huge Grand Opening display when you first walk up to the door.. this place has been open for several years... unless they put grand opening every time they change the menu? As for the price of food.. everything is way overpriced, especially since some of their stuff is frozen and then cooked.",1M8Z2vfebMGq1GG_W4_XzQ,0,0,3,lDo4JlYIvfIaebgSrw4dAw

My boyfriend is Portuguese and knows good food.  We had starter dishes...one being the chorizo.  Tasty, but sooooo salty.  The grilled goat cheese dish was so salty too, that we could not finish it.  The calamari dish was so overcooked and rubbery I almost choked on it.  The scallops were pretty good.  No offer of water or rolls, and lousy service.

I don't understand how this place has gotten such a high ratings. My husband has been wanting to eat here for a while and so we went tonight. I was pretty excited when I got there, people were dancing out on the dance floor and it was fun to watch but that was where my excitement ended. They seem to only have one waitress working even though they were busy, she was kind of pushy asking us what we wanted to eat before we had a good minute to look at the menu. We told her we would like waters to start and she said they only have bottled water and brought us 2 Kroger bottled water which they charged us $2.50/each, I'm sure I could've bought a whole case for what they charged us per bottle. We finally decided on getting the shrimp tails to start and I got the seafood pasta while my husband got the paella.  Our appetizer took about 20 minutes and our food took almost an hour from the time we ordered it! I was starving and upset that it was taking so long and the only time the waitress came to check on us was when she cleared the appetizer from our table.  I have never had such a bad dining experience.

The food
The food was mediocre at best, the shrimp tails tasted decent but they served it with 1 piece of store bought wheat toast that they cut in half for us to share. My pasta was overcooked and my husband said he preferred the taste of my overdone pasta to his paella and we generally love paella.  

Needless to say I will never come back here again and suggest that you save your time and money and go somewhere else. This makes me sad because we would've liked to go back for dancing but it's just not worth it!",mGOMxO4BdxxFnFW5s-hDiA,2,0,1,N7x-I2j-Ty51vYCq7MJSZg

We needed something close and visited this restaurant on a Sunday night so it was a little quiet but Luby immediately made us feel at home by explaining all of her homemade delicacies. Between the exceptional sangria, fresh kale & chorizo soup, grilled calamari, homemade paella, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank, and amazing marscapone dessert, you cannot lose. Luby is the real deal, with experience from several restaurants in both South Africa and Portugal.

5850016,2015-02-16,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"My husband and I came to Vegas for our anniversary weekend to getaway. To our unfortunate luck we had to get new tires on our jeep which brought us out to Tropicana and Jones Blvd. While waiting, we walked across the street to Vila Algarve to grab a bite to eat. BEST DECISION EVER. We were greeted by the owner Luby, she was extremely nice and thorough in explaining her food and freshness of product. We ordered the paella dish to share which had an AMAZING flavor and the seafood was fresh. The food was so delicious, we took a taxi from our hotel on the strip to come eat here the next day on our anniversary to try out some other dishes. Luby greeted us again with her charming personality. We ordered the freshly made sangria and she was sweet enough to give us a complimentary champagne toast for our anniversary. We ordered the snails and the frog legs (first time ever trying this) for an appetizer and I have never tasted anything so remarkable. Her flavors are so distinct and one of a kind. We shared the seafood platter for 2 and that was also just simply amazing. Ask her for a side of her homemade chili sauce too :) 

Quite frankly, I was trying to find one thing I didn't like about this place or her food but I just wasn't able to! The atmosphere is inviting, the restaurant is clean and the staff and owner is accommodating and friendly, the food is 5 stars and worth every penny. If you are going to spend $25-$50/person on the strip for a buffet or other traditional fare food, it's worth the travel away from the strip to enjoy the taste of authentic cuisine made with pride.

When you enter, it instantly has a Mediterranean vibe there's a bar area to the side and a main dining area. The dining area is actually very spacious and wide open. The table layout though can make the meals feel quite intimate
The staff here is extremely nice and helpful. We were greeted with a giant smile and a welcome. My and my friend weren't too well versed on the food and the host was sure to explain exactly what came in each dish
The food was amazing. The skewers were melt in your mouth good and the lemon butter vegetables made me a convert. It comes with beef, chicken or steak. The sandwich was good, it had pork and other goodies slathered with sauce in a bun. I haven't sampled the pasta yet but my friend raves about how good it was. For dessert, there was mascarpone, which isn't a dessert I normally like but since the host recommended I decided to go with and let's just say I wasn't disappointed 
--a few points notes, they don't have their liquor license as of 2/16/14
-- related to above, the bar area is really deserted 
They also have a stage and what looks to be a setup for live music. Whenever this does start being used, I can see it being a huge hit. 
Overall it a good restaurant, some things that I see them workin on and no reason why this wouldn't be 5 stars all the way!!",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,58,4,5,HvXTXLB84AP8iT6SfQZ--w

5954550,2014-09-28,4,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"I've never even tried Portuguese so I was a bit nervous about eating at this place. My boyfriend loves Portuguese food so I left him in charge of what to eat.

We went there around 4-5 pm for a late lunch early dinner. It was empty at the time so the owner and the waitress were able to give us most of their time. The owner introduced her self right away and so did the waitress. She told us about their restaurant and how it's the first Portuguese restaurant in Las Vegas. They went through the menu with us since it was our first time there. I was surprised at how knowledgeable the waitress was about every item in the menu. 

There is a complimentary bread basket in the beginning. The basket had two types of bread. The first one was a cinnamon bread. It was very soft and slightly sweet. It went really well with the butter. The other bread was an herd bread with a caviar dipping sauce. It was really delicious. I wanted seconds but, I wanted to leave room for rest of the meal.

We ordered calamari, pig ears, and paella. The calamari was good. It has a very light flavor and I think it was intended to be that way. It was lemony and buttery so I enjoyed this one more than my boyfriend did. The pigs ear was really good! It was not tough where you would find yourself chewing excessively, but slightly chewy andy crunchy. It came with two sauces, a vinegar one and a spicy one. Both were very good. The paella was simply amazing. I did not know what the sauce was but this stuff was really good. I'd recommend everyone to try their paella. 

We also ordered their dessert of the day which was a mascarpone roll with ice cream and berry sauce. This was really good. I can describe the taste as a cookies and cream cheesecake. Though I would've thought that texture was going to be gritty from how it looked, it was the opposite. It was smooth and creamy. Definitely would love to have it again.

And the best thing about it all is that everything is homemade.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,60,4,5,orDGaFRsyee6OF9a839Dxg

5994714,2016-12-23,0,gh6__q2WXFuyN8gt6VAnWw,"I was born and raised in Macau, which was once a colony of Portugal. This is the first time I try the authentic Portuguese food, which is kinda different from that in Macau. 
Food is good but lacks some decoration, we ordered the trinchado chicken, chorizo sausage, snails and bacalao Abrass (shredded salted cod patty). 

Trinchado chicken is okay, creamy sauce with chicken cubes and toast, sauce is made from red wine, thick and nice, but the chicken cubes are squared and frozen until used.

Chorizo sausage is maybe the best sausage I have tasted, you have to try it.

Snails is, meh.. I think the snails are froze food, put in an escargot pan and topped with some mediocre cheese, kinda waste of money.

Last is the bacalao Abrass, shredded salted cod mixed with potato to a patty, pan seared and topped with cabbage, nice flavor but the cod should better be smaller, I like my hometown deep fried bacalao ball better. 

Overall a place to try if you are interested in Portuguese food, I can't tell how authentic it is, but it is really different from most of the food you can find in vegas.",qxFeoBgxgkKh6IBmaRHU2w,6,1,4,ZT8SIRlvOqNy_7JbCuBlxg
