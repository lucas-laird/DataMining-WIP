He lives in Chicago and whenever he ventures to the west coast, he seeks out a Yoshinoya.  I have never been to a Yoshinoya in the states.  The only time was in the location across from the Kabukicho gate.  That experience was three stars.  Meat was decent and cheap.

However, this experience at this Las Vegas location was disappointing.  The sesame chicken wings tasted fresh enough, but I had to force myself to consume the beef bowl with vegetables.   Uhm, the iced tea tasted fine. :)

I always describe the meat as ""wet bacon"" on overcooked rice.  It was spot on.  More fat than meat.  Rice was clumpy and fat with water.  

To top it off, it was a $26 cab ride there from the strip (back and forth) and my buddy bought THREE large beef bowls to bring back to Caesar's.  I had to give it two stars since my buddy was smiling with MSG drool for the next three meals.  ack!

340485,2008-02-17,0,w5LUtmw4G1KD7qAntqGd9w,"Executive Summary: Food's not great, but it's quick, it's really, really, really cheap, and it fills you up.  Did I mention it's cheap?

No, Yoshinoya isn't the greatest food.  It's not haute cuisine.  In fact, it's probably just barely edible, but when you consider the price/value proposition, Yoshinoya should be on the top of your fast food list.  How much does a value meal at your typical fast food restaurant cost?  Probably $5-6 (depending on what size you'd prefer your cholesterol delivery system).  For $6, you can get a crappy burger, fries, and a soda.  What can you get at Yoshinoya for $6?  You can get a steaming bowl of rice, topped with hot beef and onions, a dessert, and a soda.  If you could go without the soda and desert, you could walk away from Yoshinoya spending less than $4.  It's a great bargain.  Yes, the chicken has the same texture as the styrofoam container it's served in, but it's still more fulfilling than a Big Mac.

If you're on a budget, and you're in a hurry, and you're sick of burgers, go to Yoshinoya and you'll think twice about ordering a value meal ever again.  Bonus: UNLV students get a $3.99 beef/chicken bowl and soda.  Bring your student ID.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,1,0,3,zmPjYTW95txRfnHvFea0Qg

This is certainly not 100% equivalent to the ones in Japan, but I keep myself from reviewing sushi places in SF by comparing them to ones in Japan.

Macaroni Salad (odd, not an option in japan) 
Cheesecake 
Caramel Flan
Chocolate Cake

From an excerpt from the Japan Times: 
""It was delicious,"" said Tadashi Ishigami, 23, one of the first to mark the return of the dish, downing a bowl at an outlet in Tokyo's Yurakucho district. ""I don't care (about the safety of the beef) as long as I can eat it.""

You see, there was a momentary ban on US Beef (insert joke here) to Japan back in 2006, and GyuDon returned to its glory days in Fall of 2006. 

But I digress. 
Sure, they should add curry rice. Sure, they should be open 24 hours and have these orange 'noren'/curtains that welcome you thru the doors. But they don't, and that's okay.

Oh, and yes, the dorktastic part of me spent about 10-15 minutes looking at the black and white photos of yoshinoya shops in the early 1900s. 

Whenever I drive past one of these.. the old commercial runs thru my head.. 

Nice to Know Ya, Yoshinoya!

I think there's one in San Jose... road trip?

This location is a few miles from the strip in a questionable neighborhood where alcohol abuse (panhandling drunks)surrounding the restaurant was noticeable.

I don't know if I was drunk, but some how this bowl tasted like the best thing I ever ate, and was hooked thereafter.   During my stay in Southern California, I often drove 20 miles just put down a combo bowl.  Then I moved back to Hawaii, and sadly, Hawaii doesn't have any franchises of this company which totally weird, because there enough Japanese tourist in Oahu to fill Sam Boyds stadium 

So years go by, and then I move to Las Vegas.  Still no Yoshinoya, but a few trips to LA, and I get my fix to settle my cravings for this cheap bowl of meats,rice, and vegtables that ruled of my early college years.

Finally,  Yoshinoya sets it marks in Las Vegas!   YES!     I always love eating here back when they first opened this location, but on my last trip.   Something is different about the chicken in the combo bowl.

The chicken isn't the same at all, and I liked it better when they broiled it with the skin on, and it had a crispy bite to it.   Thankfully, the beef is still the same, but the vegetables lacked the taste from what I'm accustomed too, and  now kind of hate it!   There was a nice chicken broth, buttery taste to the vegetables, and now it has no taste.  The plates has gotten bigger, but it's all about the memory of college days at this point, and I want my original taste back.

OK so this place is just like an ASIAN style fast food joint! I FREAKEN LOVE yoshinoya! It brings back memories of all my childhood times & they only have this one location in Vegas! 

The staff are quick & just do their job. You order your food & then you pick up your food at the counter. 

LARGE BEEF BOWL $7.89 - This is only like 50 cents more than the regular size.. so OBVIOUSLY being the fatty I am I get the LARGE one... white rice topped w/ thinly marinated beef brisket slices & onions. If I want a quick simple simple meal this is what I crave. Plus I add some green onions & it just tastes that much better. 

CHEESECAKE $2.29 - I LOVE their cheesecake for some reason... it is so smooth in texture & just melts in your mouth. Ahahhaha 

This place may be strictly a childhood memory favorite but I hope they never change & never go out of business because if I become a mom & don't wanna cook & just grab a simple meal that I KNOW my child will eat... this will probably be my go to over McDonald's or any other fast food joint.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,6,5,4,vM897xnQiG2CiTHyOBtOcQ

I had never had Yoshinoya before but someone at work told me they were big in Cali, it's kind of like Japanese home cooking.

I got around to finally visiting one night.  Wow, not bad at all!  I know, for the low prices you shouldn't expect 5 star gourmet cuisine but for what it was it wasn't bad at all.  It really got me wishin' this place was here when I was in college.  Imagine all the drunken nights, then getting a nice bowl to satisfy the munchies?  It would have been great I think.

This place isn't the cleanest of places (check the bathroom) but at least the dining room is clean right before a late night food rush.  You see where I'm getting?  This place is popular with the college folk!  In case you didn't know, Yoshinoya serves Japanese food bowls, almost like ramen but instead with rice and meat.  Their claim to fame is the 'Yoshinoya Beef Bowl'.  But they've added chicken since opening its doors back in California.

I LOVE the chicken and beef combo bowl (around $7).  It's got steamed rice on the bottom and is topped with their teriyaki chicken, fatty sliced beef (so yum! It's like the beef in sukiyaki), and a veggie mix (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage).  Their sauce makes it soooo good!  This hits the spot when you need a quick meal.  I almost forgot, you get a drink with the combo, and a side dish as well!  You can choose from a green salad, macaroni salad, soup, caramel flan, cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake or cookies.  So many choices!  I usually end up getting the green salad because on the desserts they actually include the nutritional info, leaving me feeling a little guilty.  If you eat in, on your table you have the choice of soy sauce, seasoning, and pickled ginger.  All you can eat pickled ginger!  I love the stuff and I eat a buttload of it with my meal every time.  It goes well with the sweet sauce of the dishes.  Prices for everything else are very reasonable and the food is filling.  I can get away with spending less than $20 for my gf and I, and we get entree, drink and side of salad or dessert.  

The customer service was friendly, even when they were busy with lots of college students.  Umm...half drunk college students...*tear* oh the memories!  They were completing orders quickly because it wasn't too hard to assemble one of their bowls or combos.  My only gripe here is that they serve Pepsi instead of COKE, ugh.  Boo.  I can't stand Pepsi.  I was born in Georgia....go Coke!  Coke is it!

And if you're a college student at UNLV, lucky you.  Yoshinoya has a special college meal, I think it's a beef bowl and a drink...all for $2.99!  But you gotta show your UNLV ID to get it.  No wonder the place was full of students that night.  Sure beats having to go to the DC (Dining Commons to you UNLV folk, Deadly Cuisine to my old college pal...ha ha) and figuring out what you're eating.  

Oh yeah, one last tip.  DO NOT save this stuff for leftovers the next day...it can be NASTY!  I think it could be the soggy rice.  It just doesn't taste right unless you eat it the same day you buy it.  Or maybe I added WAY too much ginger?  Anyway, just make sure you eat it all or throw away what you got left.  

But try this place if you're near UNLV and in a pinch for something to eat.  If you're not in the In-N-Out mood, give Yoshinoya a shot.  It's good, filling food.  Just don't blame me for a sore tummy if you eat your leftovers the next day!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,1,4,xfL089lMLLLypkBs7WkLcw

- beef bowl
- clam chowder
- asian wings

BEEF BOWL: first time here? Then get the beef bowl! I absolutely love their beef bowl. Make sure to put some seasoning on it and ask for a lot of ginger packs! The ginger complements the bowl VERY well. I think I end up eating at least 5 packs of ginger for my bowl.

CLAM CHOWDER: You're probably thinking.. clam chowder?! That's not even something Asian! I thought the same and honestly still wonder why they have clam chowder at Yoshinoya. BUT! It's so good. It's always nice to have some kind of soup when eating rice and the clam chowder is surprisingly very satisfying. (My friends like to pour some of the soup onto their bowl.

4571196,2013-01-25,4,w5LUtmw4G1KD7qAntqGd9w,"I finally did it, for Tony T.  I walked to Yoshinoya and got a beef bowl (gyudon) to go.  For whatever reason, the faded building/sign always turned me off, so I expected it to be old and dirty inside.  I already can get cheap gyudon from Japan Creek or just make it at home, so I never saw a reason to come here, though I worked within walking distance for almost 6 years.

I spotted Yoshinoya in Japan but never sought it out to eat at one.  The other day, I watched a show called ""Fast Foods Gone Global"" on Travel Channel, which usually chronicles US chains that infiltrate other countries and make special menus for each country's tastes.  However, this episode was international fast food companies' infiltration into the US, and whether or not menu items were changed for the American palate.

Yoshinoya has clearly adjusted its menu to the American palate, but the gyudon is still what gyudon is always - fatty thinly sliced beef cooked with onions in a sauce made with typical Japanese ingredients and served on top of rice, with beni shoga (red pickled ginger) as an accompaniment.

I also sprinkled on some shichimi togarashi and though not traditional, some chopped green onion that was out for miso soup orderers (only because green onions are my favorite vegetable!)

The menu otherwise has some odd things (I am not a fan of teriyaki type joints so I do not like the weird vegetables like zucchini in my bowls or stir fries), like vegetables, udon bowls, chicken and combo bowls, and grilled fish - I asked what type of fish and the lady pronounced something weird twice to me that started with an S, a name of a fish I certainly have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spell...I did notice Yoshinoya now has ponzu sauce (not for the beef bowl but rather the fish).  I liked the to go bowl packaging and the meal stayed hot on my jaunt back to the office to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the interior too.

Taste preference is up to each individual. 90% of the people I introduced Yoshinoya to have loved their beef bowl. The few who didn't like it is mainly due to the cut of their beef. The stringy and thinly sliced beef, that's most definitely frozen before being distributed to each chain restaurant.  The onions and flavoring added to the broth stock is the other half of the equation. I think its beef bowl is something you love it or hate it.  I'm happy Yoshinoya set up a shop in Vegas, despite Vegas' small city size. There's no Yoshinoya in larger cities such as Chicago or any other Midwestern cities for that matter.  It seems to be a coastal thing in the US. 
Beef bowl is what made Yoshinoya famous. So I won't comment nor do I order other items on the menu. Chicken is not too bad. I heard steak bowl is decent. But it's the beef bowl that stays true to Yoshinoya's name.",2HNU4vNP8c_EtWG4MhlVVw,0,0,5,Xb3DjVuuhnOcYdPiaxxbTw

Now, obviously, compared to the Yoshinoyas I visited in Japan this is not the same thing. The busy, fast-paced lunch counter atmosphere in Japan is replaced by a bit of an empty, American fast food environment. This is disappointing (though expected) because sitting elbow-to-elbow with some stranger while you both slurp up shaved beef is half the fun of Yoshinoya. Anyhow, the only thing on the menu that looked vaguely similar to the Japanese version was the gyudon (beef bowl) which was exactly what I was after. Sadly this Yoshinoya doesnt offer any of the Japanese-style add-ons like raw egg, BUT there was a large tub of shredded ginger.

So after ordering a large beef bowl, with nothing else (no veggies, no sides, just the beef) I closed my eyes and indulged. I have to say... If I didnt hear the obnoxious UNLV kids next to me talking about Jay-Z I would have easily convinced myself I was back in Japan. The taste is very close and really good. This will definitely satisfy my gyudon cravings. I would just stick to the original, beef-only bowl and you are set. So excited to see this here!",A_dC3FJOqvlsDEiDyMrzlA,6,2,4,aKGXtaj0m0MCqt7P5jOOVw

They should add Japanese curry to their menu.  I also wish they offered white meat chicken too.  I also agree with the weirdness of the veggie color.  I don't know why its gotta be so damn yellow.  Just go to Ichiza instead.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,4,2,2,Hk7eSM29d2EpUNlWjJbePw

I grew up going to Yoshinoya in Cali. It has a small menu, but there are some delicious options. I have been to this location near UNLV many times in the past, however this visit was a little below par.

I was excited to see the new Honey Walnut Shrimp bowl, but was dissapointed when it arrived covered in mayonnaise.  The vegetables were the standard vegetable medley that you get in a frozen bag from the store.  They usually have a broth that covers the rice but were dry on this visit.

The beef bowl is their signature item. The beef is thinly sliced and cooked in jus with onions. This is typically my favorite but was also dry on this visit.

Overall this trip was dissapointing. Too bad because this restaurant is usually delicious.",-go-R_jzvYLYngQbfKN4_A,1,1,3,XjRhVgp9yIhjAChFZJh5eA

As an adult, I moved to Las Vegas and would make it a necessary stop to pick up YOSHINOYA for the trip back.  The usual was the Combo Bowl.  Beef and Teriyaki Chicken with veggies.  My husband would get the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with extra teriyaki sauce.  My girls would get the beef bowl with extra beef juice (I like to think of it as sauce).  The only differences from the past would be the fact that the chicken piece is no longer sliced in long strips.  You get chunks of chicken that has been tossed around.  Also, the containers have changed.  Instead of the large rectangular bowls, you get a short flat box plate.  The food stayed the same.  No issues there at all.  

My issues have to deal with the dirty seating area, oddly decorated space, and customer service that you have to scratch your head at.  Today's experience had to do with the fact that the cash register didn't want to work.  And then.. when asked about the special, they still rang it up wrong.  $5.69 large bowl + $1.80 for a large drink, when the special didn't say what size fountain drink you had to purchase.  Truth in advertising, please!!  This YOSHINOYA also doesn't seem to follow any standard rules.  Sometimes they charge you for extra sauces, sometimes they don't.  Sometimes you can get the advertised special, and sometimes you are told it's something else.  Frustrating, YES!  Will I go back?  ...  I won't make a trip that's out of the way.
