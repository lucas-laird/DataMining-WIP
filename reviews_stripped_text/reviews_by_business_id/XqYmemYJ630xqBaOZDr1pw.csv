101055,2015-03-26,0,XqYmemYJ630xqBaOZDr1pw,"My husband and I drive over from Henderson just for their tacos. These are hands down the best street tacos I've had in Vegas. The prices are unbeatable, $1 for the tacos, $.25 for toppings (cilantro, onions, salsa). The tortillas might be smaller than what you're used to at other restaurants, but three tacos are enough to fill me up. If you can't handle spices, beware of the red salsa. It's got quite a kick, but it's oh so good!",_a6fWMCWqrb3mXKg7xpu9Q,1,0,5,FDP84hd65QTmG0I0xjZ8PQ

The place has changed owners and names. Now called Taqueria Los Pioneros. 

When I went by today at about 6 p.m. I saw a restaurant building with a Closed sign in the window, and a small trailer out in the parking lot. 

You can see where they erased the Tacos Azteca name from the trailer -- the guy behind the counter said that he is the new owner.  Yup, it's new -- the health inspection certificate (Rated A) is only one week old.

 I should have asked for more info (is the storefront closed permanently? Just closed for the evening?) When I placed my order I missed a big clue when the guy behind the counter politely asked, ""For here or to go?"" (""Here""?  Where?  I'm standing in an empty parking lot!)

My order was simple -- Pastor (marinated pork) burrito. I thought it was large for only $5, and came with an ample supply of lime slices.  Not sure if it was the greatest burrito of all time* but it was certainly tasty and spicy. Worth another visit.

*The joke is that every time we eat out anywhere my mother-in-law always leans in while my mouth is full with my first bite and asks, ""Is that the BEST BURRITO YOU'VE EVER HAD?"" and I never quite know what to say: ""Um... it's fine. I'm enjoying it. But the best EVER?  I dunno... Can I wait to answer until I've had a second bite?""",cv6nVaeBrucho8WfOZW0LA,2,0,4,yQP0Fmgki0nSPsqsNFs-sQ

They also have an outside taco stand serving the same delicious tacos you get inside. Everyone is super friendly and very helpful. 
I will definitely be coming back for some more delicious tacos!",9WBYh8cdb0qKqc_0ux3rZQ,1,1,5,Y3PS8f0UCIC0FWUgLACjyw

After a long day of work I just wanted some decent tacos and beer but this place hit the spot. So lucky to have found this taco truck and to live near it, definitely going back again and again. The carnitas are fire and so was my mouth after eating those spicy tacos I felt like I was back in Tijuana downing Coronas after each bite.

4579436,2013-05-15,4,XqYmemYJ630xqBaOZDr1pw,"One of the things I love best about travelling to Mexico is stopping at the street taco vendors and getting some authentic cooked to order carne asada dollar tacos.  

Taco Azteca brought that exact thing to Las Vegas, and they do it WONDERFULLY.  There is a restaurant storefront, but I am not entirely sure you can go inside (I've never seen anyone but an employee go in) because the sell everything from a food cart in their parking lot.  I have only ever stopped by here after dark, and I'm pretty sure they aren't open in the daytime (or maybe that's when you can go inside to dine...I'm not sure and don't really care.)   

Ladies and Gentlemen, if you have not eaten at Taco Azteca, you are missing out on one of the best culinary experiences in Vegas.   This little food cart has been featured on Anthony Bourdain, and it's not hard to see why the producers picked this place for a feature spot.  AMAZING.  Oh, and there is always a line of Mexicans waiting to get their orders, which to me is a pretty strong sign of good authentic Mexican food.  

Their tacos are a buck a piece, and 50 cents to add cheese (and who wouldn't want cheese?).  They offer traditional fillings like carne asada (steak), carnitas (shredded pork), and pollo (chicken), or if you are feeling adventurous, they have lengua (tongue) and cabeza (which I'm pretty sure is cow brain - I'm not that adventurous)

I cannot say this strongly enough.  Do yourself a favor and FIND THIS PLACE.  Okay...now i'm hungry.  I'm thinking i may have to hit this place tonight.

***Expert tip:  Ask them for some lime wedges and squeeze a lime on each taco just before you eat it.  It enhances the flavor of the meat and makes your tastebuds want to sing with joy.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,5,3,5,Y7YNCX_SaTijg8DpG3bMiA

4720985,2017-08-15,1,XqYmemYJ630xqBaOZDr1pw,"I was really disappointed with the tacos here. Sadly, these were amongst the worst taco's I have ever had.

To start, this isn't a restaurant, it's a taco trailer that is always in the same place everyday. I think that they used to be in the Mexican restaurant that is closed down in the same parking lot but now just serve out of the trailer instead. I have passed by here many times and have been meaning to try it for awhile.

I ordered a chicken taco, a barbacoa taco, a carne asada taco, a carnitas taco and an al pastor taco. The quality of the meat was just sad. I couldn't even tell the difference between the carnitas and pastor. Good pastor should be seasoned, and preferably is shaved off a rotisserie. This chewy under seasoned pork wasn't even worth eating.

All the meat was bland and tasted like it had been sitting in a tray for hours. The only meat that was even slightly good was the barbacoa, and even it was a little chewy.

The tacos were so underwhelming that I don't think I will ever give this place a chance again.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,3,1,2,RKLdJD3yL6o3wjZnNvEaSg

I ordered a Carne Asada, Al Pastor, and Carnitas. And they all had, weirdly, the same taste. Overly greasy, no flavor, and no texture. Even with the condiments on the tacos. Lol 
It's obvious by the other reviews that these folks NEVER really had GOOD tacos.

I'm pretty much a taco connoisseur, LA native, so I've tried the best!
