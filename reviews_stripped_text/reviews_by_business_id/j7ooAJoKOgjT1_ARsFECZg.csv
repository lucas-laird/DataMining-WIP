A few bird-sized pieces and tons of onions. The rice was hard, couldn't even eat it. Way overpriced for what you get plus the wait for your food is an eternity! I had to wait almost 30 min for my food and there was nobody in the line how hard can be to make an onion wrap with no chicken.

1342434,2017-06-01,3,j7ooAJoKOgjT1_ARsFECZg,"Unfortunately, extremely disappointed.  At first, everything seemed good, friendly employee and smiling owner, expensive vegas-looking menu, and big flames on the grill. Even though the cashier was friendly and smiley, you could tell she was a newbie, which was perfectly fine with the owner hovering; however, you really shouldn't have a newbie cashier if she's never had the food before. 

We asked if the rice was flavored or plain white rice because fries would be better if it was the latter, she said it was ""flavored"" with spices and butter while looking over her shoulder at her boss every few seconds. 

Anyway, placed an order for a Beef and Chicken skewer with ""flavored rice,"" a half order of hummus, and an extra side of pita, and 2 cups of ice water while we waited. Everything for almost $20. (By the time I realized she charged me for 2 cups of barely cold water, I was too nice to bother, even though I should because that wasn't right to charge me for water when there's no signs or notifications. They didn't charge people for cups of ice but charged me for water.) Before we placed our order, we were watching the grill master and the kabobs, and they looked huge! So huge, we thought maybe they actually did hook it up at the price point. 

But when we opened the box, we were in shock how small the portion of kabobs were....soooooo disappointing.... 3 dinky pieces of somewhat-chewable-beef and tiny blocks of dry-underseasoned-chicken. Like what the heck... It also came with pickles and a roasted tomato. The rice was terrible, not even ""flavored"" or close for that matter. The rice was also not very tender and quite hard. At least it was semi-cooked to order.

Hummus and factory-made pita was okay, had we known it came with pita, we wouldn't have ordered more pita. Hummus was more on the chunky side versus the smooth, luscious kind. So it was ok, it also didn't taste  like it was made in-house though. 

Then, before we went back to our room, I wanted a side of tahini. For some reason, everyone looked at me like they had no idea what I'm talking about. I just wanted some plain sesame paste that you used to make your hummus, if you actually made it... Anyway finally they figured out what I was asking for, the falafel sauce they said...and I said sure, ok. It took all 3 of them to figure out how much to charge me for it. I get this itty bitty sauce cup, maybe an ounce of tahini, it cost me another $1.09. 

 At that point, I was calling to the kabob gods that the food better be delicious.... 

They never answered my call.... maybe I didn't call them loud enough...

2.42 stars for overpriced miniscule kabobs, hard white rice, outrageous hidden iceless water fee, and pretty much treating me like a stupid consumer. Ugh. Never again, should've gone to the Indian food stall with the hella long line...",sPksYz22qDXP2Zh475Pi1g,5,4,2,HHxiI32ednkXU-TAQOOVWg

I got a gyro plate which came with a choice of salad, rice or fries and hummus.  I wanted both rice and a salad but they would only let me choose one and didn't have a side salad option.  I was told it also came with a roasted tomato and picked cucumber so I went with the rice.  There was no cucumber so that was a bummer.  The gyro was good as was the hummus but the rice was not.  It tasted old like it sat in a refrigerator over night then was microwaved.  The staff seemed nice and the service was super fast.  I paid about $13 plus $1 tip.

It's tucked away in the Venetian Some distance from the canals and above the Sans Expo floor, but it's not hard to find if you've been here a lot. Anyways, They give a fair amount for what you pay for and service wasn't to bad.

Got #45 which was the original Gyro plate. Honestly for being in the food was what I expected of a Gyro place, while it's more expensive than the Chipotle or the other fast foods here, it's comparable to other Mediterranean places.

The Gyro plate came with a cooked tomato, which actually tasted sweet and crispy. The Gyros were good and the sauce was on point. For being in the Venetian, this place is in a good spot for a quick bite.",IHalLPBURlCw6mdtmY4VgA,0,0,4,HZg2t_Og9ayQmLHQT1Ukbw

So, this place is in a food court at the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. 

Ian wanted a Pizza so, the Mrs. and Ian placed an order from Social Life Pizza. After looking at all the available options, I felt like a Kabob. So, I decided to dine from here. I placed my order, and a buzzer was handed to me. The very strong buzzer went off within 10 minutes. *laughs* I picked up the piping hot food, Tapatio sauce, plastic cutlery, Paper towels and proceeded to have a wonderful meal.

I had the following:
Original Gyro plate with Rice and White Pita ($9.99)
Half order Hummus with Pita ($2.99)
1 Pepsi 32 Oz (3.50)

Total with tax came to $17.83

Pros:
Very friendly employee and a knowledgeable owner at the counter?
Food is being prepared fresh. The skewers of Kabob's over the fire is an appetizing view behind the counter.
Gyro was delicious. 

Cons:
Holding the Gyro wrapped in the Pita was a tad bit difficult. Should ask the stuffing separate if you do not want to leave a mess around your mouth. Trust me :)",DqNgAUKmZEFnLJcREzd5SA,3,3,4,iCICkgvuVc1pOzJp-VcPdw

Huge box of food for $12 in Vegas? It is possible. Hubs and I couldn't decide on what restaurant to head to for Dinner during our shopping spree in the hotel so hit up the food court instead, he went to the nearby Indian place while I came here.
I decided to go for the Chicken wrap with Salad instead of Fries which was cooked to order in great time with friendly customer service. The wrap itself was a good size albeit poorly wrapped but with good flavors and lot's of delicious sauce. The Salad was a bit of a let down though - Just lettuce with a little Cucumber and Tomato, no sauce. I feel for a Greek place they really should offer some kind of Yogurt dressing for the Salad (Like Tzatzki) maybe even some Feta Cheese.
