Their veggie combo is amazing I always eat Ethiopian food, this one is really amazing. The owner, or the manager, Lili at this Restaurant is very friendly and professional she kept asking if any thing is needed every five minutes in my entire stay. I had to call my friend to come and join me because it was very delicious Habesha Food, and my friend was arrived in 20 minutes as expected and he was amazed with veggie combo just as I did. Then we both decided to grade 5 stars. We also promised to come back .",JHovs8vzJ3876yn51HJgfw,1,0,5,7J9QNitDWg6xpAqNhonr-Q

Luckily there were authentic Ethiopian Empanadas available.?delicous thick and satisfying to the chew stuffed with lentils, spiced right with a hint of heat. Accompanied by strong espresso served in a perfect cup. Great stop !",UXcKPc2yi4FjgZz6VBTF0w,1,0,5,HJP25FxED2heTOjmhQ5PtQ
