The food has always been delicious, fresh, and the quantity is more than enough for one person. The owner, Nick has always made sure our food is right. Love the atmosphere, too. Friday, I had a take out order delivered to our school. It was sent perfectly, everything as we ordered, hot and delicious. The other 7 teachers were so impressed at how wonderful everything was. I have introduced many people to Stefano's, and no one has been disappointed. So glad you opened in your new area. We love it!!!!!",A_iWOG8MfATE6QlVRhJwng,0,0,5,nqfWMOZyd_OY72mIzofroA

The food has been great each time. However, the staff has been disappointing each time. Lack of warmth/friendly and certainly not welcoming of a ""new"" place (if even in the neighborhood) nor for take out orders have the seemed to be very perceptive of ""put an extra pep in your step"" while you visibly see the customer awaiting their order. I don't consider their food to be, ""fast food"" equivalent at all, unfortunately, their service is. Perhaps I'm a bit of a stickler for, ""quality"". It's too bad, quality food can't be accompanied by a better, ""dining experience.

They don't skimp. Great portion sizes full of flavor and a variety of ingredients. And the food tastes clean, you know what I mean? No gross, greasy afterfeel. Just well-cooked and clean. I always get the salad with some type of beef, and they pack the salad with plenty of meat, vegetables, olives, and feta cheese. I say that, because I don't like it at other places when you order a salad, and you basically get a big bowl of lettuce with a sprinkle of meats and toppings. Nope, not here. The salads here are great. My husband always gets a combo plate. Everything on the combo plate is delicious too.

I called and told the manager and he said that's not possible because they make everything fresh. I don't know what his idea of fresh is but for me taking it out of the frig to reheat and serve is not fresh.... Nor did I appreciate the cold food for my $25 lunch order.

Excuses excuses... Unless the salad the meat was sitting on was an ice salad the meat being cold all the way to the center just doesn't happen. I don't cook, I do take out quite frequently. You think this takeout was something original causing some extraordinary circumstance... May have been fresh off the grill in their heads, who knows. It was still cold.

They have so many excellent choices, my favorite meals are the filet mignon steak kebab plate, the chicken kebab plate, and the kofta plate. The great thing about their plates is that they come with so many excellent side choices. You can get a delicious and healthy Israeli or Greek salad as one of your sides. There aren't many places around my office where you can find great tasting salads. Their salads are very fresh and I need all the vegetables I can get. 

I prefer to get their fries as my second side choice. Their fries are amazing! Better than any other place that serves fries! Get the fries and their secret fry sauce, you will come back wanting more! 

One thing I love about their location is that they take online orders through their website. This saves me so much time during my lunch break. I can order online and as soon as I get to their restaurant the food is ready for me. The service is 5 star every time I am here.

Their menus are super simple, have many options for anyone & they are flexible to substitutions. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get, I even had leftovers, which says a lot for me expecting a baby in a few days, lol! Personally, the plates are best bet since you have so many options, but they have a combo deals as well.

Here's what we ordered:
Me: Chicken shwerma plate w/ French fries substituted for the isreli salad, came with 3 kinds of sauces.
Hubby: Combo plate of chicken kebab & steak kebab w/ French fries substituted for salad, came with one red creamy sauce (IDK the name)
Mom: Beef Dorme? Plate, idk but it was cut pieces of beef
Dad: Beef Kofta plate
Grandma: Chicken shewerma plate
Little brother: Kids meal w/ 2 chicken kebabs & French fries w/ red creamy sauce (I'm assuming now it's their fry sauce lol)

All plates came with choice of white or wheat pita bread which is warmed & wrapped in foil. And the typical sides are the rice, isreli salad & hummus, but as I mentioned before they are flexible w/ substitutions & you can substitute any of your sides w/ a small appetizer... Which I think is SUPER awesome.

You order at the register, take a seat & they serve you, the staff was super friendly & the cashier was awesome at taking the order cuz we had a pretty complicated one in my opinion haha. But everything came out just as we had ordered & in a timely manner. The store is clean & let me say their bathroom is hilariously large for one toilet lol, but still spic & span clean nonetheless.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, the food is awesome, there's something for everyone & it's in a great area of Las Vegas instead of dealing with all the trouble of going across a university & dealing w/ a bunch of college kids grabbing a bite.",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,5,p_MMAh97rlSBzx0KuUU6zg

The concept is quick service, although we dined in. However, the prices are more than other quick service restaurants. We spent close to $40 for two of us. The food is super tasty though and I will definitiely dine here again. I know they are new and may be ironing out the kinks, but I would make the recommendation that the service should be faster. We didnt mind as much because we were dining in, but it was on the slow end for a quick service restaurant that was not busy when we arrived.

Also, the texture of the chicken shawarma leaves something to be desired. The taste was excellent, but the texture was a little on the rubber-side. Perhaps use better chicken or a different preparation method? Regardless, I will be back. This place is good and in the neighborhood!",MHCerAmy_1TGc85p4Qr-5A,2,2,4,IXJms1-25eH1rEqKfXUEXw

I generally get the combo with chicken and steak. Can't go wrong with that! I've gotten the chicken leg option before but I didn't find the chicken as juicy as I'd like. I love that they offer a wheat pita bread option. I normally don't see that in Greek places. I always do the baklava check in whenever I come in. It's a nice sweet treat for after a good Greek meal!

They have condiments you can get for yourself i.e. pickled turnips, jalapenos, and lemons. (I grabbed some jalapenos just because I love them, despite it not complementing my plate). I loved the Israeli salad. It tasted super fresh and was just a refreshing side. The grilled chicken definitely tasted like it just came off a grill (good!) and the steak was noticeably tender. However, the hummus, rice, and pita paled in comparison to the meats. They were mediocre at best.

Procrastination for trying out new places in your neighborhood is terrible! I could kick myself for not coming here to eat so much sooner! Better late than never right? You see this has been bookmarked for well... let's just say a very long time. I decided that this past weekend was going to be the time I gave in and just tried them out. The great thing about Stephano's is that they are located super close to home! This could actually also be a bad thing but for now let's stick with the good!

Upon arriving I must've picked a great night to come because they weren't busy at all! That's a score especially when you are hungry! I walked in and BAM you are immediately faced with a huge menu! I knew I was going to be doing a take out order so I wanted to make sure I had exactly what I wanted mapped out before making my way to the counter. The ambiance of the place is pretty chill and I could really appreciate the décor and just overall vibe of the place. Thanks to my fellow Yelper's for posting those tasty looking pictures I was already fixed on the Loaded Beef and Lamb Gyro Fries! My mom needed to order as well so her choice was the Beef and Lamb Gyro Pita. Based off the reviews I knew that I couldn't go wrong with either of these two selections AND it helped that the cashier endorsed these two items as well! 

Total wait time for my food to actually be ready was under 15 minutes so another kudos for them for being fast and efficient! I will be visiting on the regular now, not only because the food is great but the service was pretty good as well. There are seriously several other items on the menu that I am keeping my taste buds open to. It's nothing like have a local restaurant in the area that can execute all of these things.

3173912,2016-04-24,3,_0x7W6fizaPP76xNBxBLAQ,"We were excited to see that a highly rated Greek restaurant was located not far from us.  I had it bookmarked for some time so when the craving for Greek food kicked in it was time to check off that bookmark.  We ordered the Beef and Lamb Gyro Plate with extra meat.  We also got the loaded Gyro fries and an order of Moussaka.   We added a few of the Baklava to our order include our free one for checking in - sweet!  We got our food to go.  The wait was not too long and they offered us water while we waited - very nice.
   They have an average size dinning room which is nothing fancy but this is a fast casual place so that was to be expected. The service was great and the young lady who took our order was awesome.  Her enthusiasm and great attitude was something you don't see too often so I was impressed.
   The food was tasty with the gyro meat being the true standout.  It was moist and delicious.  You can tell that had just cut it off the spit and not reheated it which some places do.  Although we had ordered extra meat it didn't look like extra so if the normal amount is much smaller then extra is the way to go.  The Moussaka was OK.  It came in a small aluminum container and had been burnt on the edges.  We also got the loaded gyro fries which had lots of gyro meat, hummus, spices and Tabbouleh, tomatoes and red onions.  They were very good and truly lived up to the loaded name.  
   The gyro plates came with hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread.  The hummus was very good and plentiful.  The Israeli Salad (cucumbers, onions and tomatoes in vinegar) was OK but I would prefer a Greek salad instead.  We got the wheat pita bread which was slightly sweet tasting  and delicious.  The tzatziki sauce was very good and made a great addition to the gyro meat.  The Secret Fry Sauce had a mustard taste and seemed out of place with the cuisine.  
   To top off the meal was the tasty Baklava.  They had the right amount of honey to make them perfectly moist.  I had to ensure I got my fair share of the Baklava and it was worth it.  Definitely get the Baklava when you eat at Stephanos.  A good place to fill you craving for tasty Greek food.",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,11,12,4,HEoTkqeIZnnC0S-OSt-jew

I did call ahead to see if their Dolma (grape leaves) were hot or cold/ meat or not. They are cold with rice and tomato paste. I decided to pass. I placed my order online which was very easy, no need to create an account, all the selections were simple and you can customize your order. We ordered a combo plate and a shwerma plate. The food arrived at 4:25pm even though the order confirmation said it would take much longer. That was nice. The delivery person was very friendly and kind. The food was AMAZING and arrived in nice plastic plates with clear covers. The french fries were those perfectly lightly battered kind. So flavorful. Krispy on the outside. They came with a special dipping sauce which is a light orange cream color and tasted kind of honey mustard-y. VERY good. My husband is a bit picky so it means a lot when he says ""This place is my new favorite. Not a single thing was less than perfect."" The israeli salad was flavorful, fresh and just a tiny spicy. Not boring at all. The Taziki sauce is rich and cool. Pita bread is hot, fresh, soft and abuntant. Two big breads per order. We got regular and whole wheat. The hummus was perfect. The meats were just as we hoped they would be. Perfectly flavored and visually appealing. It was a food ordering dream come true. I can usually put food away but I couldn't finish my whole plate and I had them hold the rice. I am so glad this place opened.

Even though the bread was good, I ended up skipping most of it and eating the delicious falafel and tahini sauce, because it was so much food. The fries were fresh and the fattoush was delicious. The fattoush in particular was highly seasoned.  We also had the baklava, which tasted good but was dry.   

In addition to the great entree and sides, they also have turnip pickles.  These are the best and not easy to find. 

They have a sign near the beverage station that says not to be shy about asking for more sauce. I like that even though they give you enough to begin with.  The service was polite, fast, and efficient.  It's a really casual place and we ate outside on their dog-friendly patio.

I was sad when the other Mediterranean restuarant relocated to Village Square (great food too and great new location), however have been pleased with the opening of this little gem. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the place is neat and clean even during lunch hour rush, nice covered outdoor seating.  The seating is hard chairs, and with the high top ones, metal chairs, so feels a bit more fast food for me than stay awhile with family, however there's plenty of dine in space, and I've seen diverse mix of clientele. The taste of each of the dishes I've had so far has been great (I've been there several times for lunch over past week due to a busy schedule).  The meat is tender and flavorful, the vegetables fresh. My view is that the menu is a combination of standards that you can get several ways (e.g. chicken shawarma in white or wheat pita, as a plate with sides, or over salad), and great options I've not had at some other restuarants  (e.g. feta fries topped with feta and oregano... fabulously tasty... and ultimate greek grilled cheese with mozzarella, feta, garlic sauce,  red pepper and mint flakes, olive oil...next on my list to try).  The portion sizes for most items are large enough to have leftovers for a second meal.

It is still Greek or Mediterranean but definitely not the same. Now it's more of an overpriced café Rio type chain without the fun of getting to watch the food being prepared. I was also very unimpressed with their menu it was small Font size and laid out in a way that was somewhat confusing. I had the filet mignon salad. The portion sizes as far as the actual meat were concerned were reasonable and the flavor was quite good but I felt as though the salad was very haphazardly put together for $13.00. With their vinaigrette it was a very enjoyable salad they did not skimp on most of the required elements of the salad. Overall flavor five stars on the salad. They lost a star for this one though. I feel that it is ridiculous that there was a tip option on the point-of-sale register. It's mainly cafeteria style with no actual service to speak of other than them bringing the food to your table so why in the world would I tip you?,2cwu3mjtBWWU94OnrOWOfA,0,0,3,4PVrUL6eMo4izlWn9mwIjg

Their fries are not bad at all if you like the old old old school fries that BK used to serve. I can't really explain the texture but, it reminded my of the old BK fries in the breading.

I think the food items we got were okay. Tasted like fast food (lamb and beef plate). I LOVED their lemon garlic sauce and cucumber salad that came with the combo meal. That stuff is legit!!! 

The lamb and beef combo plate, the meat was a bit too salty for me, and price point is way too high for what they offer. For instance, a chicken kabob plate is $13 and has rice, hummus, cucumber salad, and two mini pitas. 
Their small feta fry is $5.50.

If I sound critical it's because I am lol. I'm Lebanese so I know what I'm looking for. I would come back here to try their gyro bc I'm no doubt guessing that the owners are Greek and not Arabs (I had thought they might be arab bc of the ""shawarma"" spit) so their gyro is probably good lol.

I first visited the week they opened and was not disappointed, portions are huge and flavors are as good as can be expected from a casual, somewhat fast food ish kinda place. Got the combo platter with Chicken shawarma and gyro. It comes with Hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread. Along with that are 3 different types of sauces: garlic, tahini and tzatziki. On a different occasion I tried their Chicken kebabs and that I enjoyed as well. My kids thoroughly enjoy their seasoned fries especially when dipped in their secret fry sauce. So addicting!

Most recently though, I wasn't quite satisfied with my order. I work close by so I decided to place a phone order for pick up. Chicken shawarma plate wasn't as good as I remembered and the sides were just ok. Ate half and threw away the rest. They have a pretty large menu though so I might try something else next time.

I order a half chicken and lamb/beef plate. All is great! The service is good but every time they seem confused about my order. I want the pita that they serve with the 1/2 chicken to be whole not cut in half and every time it's a long conversation about it. Their sauces are very good and wonderful compliments for their food. 

The main complaint about this place it the terrible music! It is techno sometimes and other times dance music or trance music. It's always terrible! I don't want to listen to this music while I'm trying to enjoy a meal.

I've picked up take out from here, twice now.  I'm going to say that the food (even 5 minutes before closing) has been consistent.  

Now, I'm going to get into pricing  (which is where I am bummed out )  almost 30 bucks for 2 people to eat take out is pretty spendy in my book. 

The Falafel Wrap is good ( as a vegetarian option,  it should have lettuce on it,  I did order lettuce on it, but noticed when I got home that someone had forgotten to put it on) But 7, (Yes! SEVEN Dollars) for a falafel wrap, is , (just the wrap) is kinda over priced....



I also got a large greek salad, 8 dollars Lg, 7 dollars Sm. Good salad,  but when a person orders an 8 dollar salad,  I was really disappointed at the tiny amount of olives, 7 unpitted olives. Major hazard,  as there's no note on the container,  about pitts. 
After searching the menu (in super tiny print,  I found - Olives contain pits) Now, again 8 bucks for a salad isnt crazy, but its not cheap either.  7 olives,  and it is a real bummer that Stephanos, doesn't pit their olives,  at the price point that they're charging,  please pit the olives!  

I also ordered a Beef & Lamb Gyro wrap, husband said it was good, but that the meat was dry :/ but that it had good flavor. 

I'm sure that I will eat here again,  but I would love to see a daily special,  or a reasonably priced lunch special.
