The food is great, the prices are reasonable, the place is more spacious than I expected and definitely clean, but what really sold us is how friendly the staff is -- just truly pleasant and kind as they take your order and give you your food. Sounds small but it can be nonexistent in similar establishments.

Toward the end I thought I had left my sunglasses on the table and the woman busing the tables came outside to double check that I'd found them (I had).

STRIKE 2!  My first experience with Fish King Grill on Windmill lane in Las Vegas (89123) did not leave a good impression on me or my taste buds. HOWEVER, I overlooked it since my friend got me deep fried Catfish & Chips rather than Cod & Chips. Turns out they DO NOT have Cod:-(  I decided to try it again (6/22/2017) and it was even WORSE in my friend's & in my opinion.  This time I asked for the (UNAVAILABLE) Cod & ended up ordering Deep-fried Trout & Chips, a tasty fish that I grew up on:-) A couple of bites of fish & fries and I was FRUSTRATED AND DONE. The fries were as soggy as any I have ever had. The fish was ALL BATTER and very similar to the taste from my 1st unpleasant go round. I RARELY post a YELP review but the 2 that I have posted were necessary in my opinion in order to inform potential patrons.

Unless you have a shellfish allergy, and you probably shouldn't be here anyway. The crabs are gigantic and the legs make them look like fried spiders. Tasty, crispy, well-seasoned fried spiders. Two huge sandwich halves, with fries and hushpuppies, are well worth the $13 price tag and I'll cross town for this meal again.

But it took me a few visits to find this magical order. Previous takeout orders for fish tacos and a a grilled shrimp salad were average to mediocre, thanks to limited dressings, a deconstructed presentation, soggy tortillas, etc. The seafood soups look good too, but now that I've found success with the poboys, I'll be sticking to that part of the menu!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,16,4,35Sfpo27oKzJJ1zJEi8Pww

The catfish and shrimp were so good and idk if they make their sauces in house but they were also so yummy! Rice and beans were delicious as well. I also tried a cup of their crawfish chowder. So good!! Everything was on point. WELL DESERVED 5 stars!! Thank you Miguel for letting me sub fries for beans and rice it balanced my meal out perfectly! Will definitely be back!

I had the soft-shell crab po' boy and it was delicious, as well as filling. Even the roll was exceptional. The hush puppies were perfection. I was able to trade the french fries I didn't want for another side and chose coleslaw--also perfection, flavorful, not greasy. I'll have to take half the sandwich home next time as it was too much for me to eat at once (I ate it anyway). I took some clam chowder home as it seemed to be a special that day. Told them not to heat it. The next day I found it to be extremely flavorful, in what I think may be New Orleans style. My only recommendation would be to cut back a bit on the salt, as it's not needed and a lot of people are cutting back. They had grilled sea bass for $17 ( their fish entrees are 8-12 oz), which would cost you twice as much on the strip. Interesting sides. I only wish they were in Anthem.

The ceviche is a little different than your typical ceviche. It's a tomato base, so it doesn't have that strong citrus/lime flavor.

i didn't give it 5 stars because the lemonade was not good at all, my fries were slightly cold (didn't care that much to say any thing because i was enjoying my fish) and they cut their shrimp down the middle m, flatten and the fry it

2258054,2018-06-20,0,0wW9PasC8pw8SY7rlY3ZKw,"We stopped by after reading reviews and looking at the menu. We came by on a Wednesday afternoon around 2:30 pm. There were only a couple of tables occupied but we knew they normally had a dinner rush.
My husband lived in New Orleans for a while and we have eaten a decent amount of Cajun/Creole food and we are constantly on the lookout for reputable restaurants.

My son got the 2 chicken strips and it came with fries, a bag of animal cookies, and a large drink. It came in a cute little boat which satisfied my 5 year old. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavored batter, not too heavy.

My husband got the grilled rainbow trout in lemon butter with spinach and grilled squash and zucchini. He devoured it in a matter of moments. Luckily he saved me a bite and it was well seasoned and moist. The spinach and squash and zucchini seemed to have a lemon butter seasoning as well; very delicious whatever it was!

I ordered a bowl of crawfish chowder and the fried shrimp poor boy sandwich. The crawfish chowder had a wonderful kick that makes you sweat but keeps you coming back for more. It has the same heat reminiscent of NOLA gumbo, such a good burn! Most places that try to replicate the NOLA po'boy usually fall short in the bread and flavor department. If you go for bread that's too hard or crispy, or even chewy, it ruins it. If the sauce is too spicy or overpowering, no thank you. But this seriously took me back to sitting in Jackson Square, eating a shrimp po'boy under the sun. The bread was a softer alternative; the breading in the shrimp was light and crunchy. The mixture of tomato, lettuce, and whatever sauce they used was mouth watering. I had asked for no onions and noticed some were in there but I barely even noticed, it was THAT TASTY! It came with beautifully crisped French fries and two hush puppies, light corn fritters that were pleasantly put down the hatch.

We will definitely be back. Congratulations on making our list!

You can do takeout or dine in.  When you dine in, they provide you with a buzzer, and you go up to the counter and get your food. The wait for the food isn't long at all which is a plus!

I had the catfish fillet basket.  Good size fish fillet.  Meal came with fries, 2 hush puppies, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which had a good kick to it.  The catfish had a good coating of batter; not to thin/thick, but just right. Fries are either seasoned or regular.  Seasoned fries have a lil Cajun kick.  The hush puppies were about the size of a golf ball and was also good.  
Hubby got the 2 piece beer battered cod which he said he liked too.  His wasn't drenched in oil and tasted just right.  

Inside the restaurant is nice and bright, with a lot of light coming from the windows.  Got some cute decor hanging on the wall and two flat screen tv's with at least some sporting event on.  The tables are supplied with saltine crackers, hot sauce, ketchup, oh and salt & pepper which they got in corona bottles, (thought that was pretty cool).
Near the counter they have a fridge with a selection of beer for purchase.

Our regular stops would tell you we are great customers, tip well.  And are supportive of the community.  We tried this new place based on a eater article of new openings. We stand by our comment and rarely return food and expect a refund.  But the food had no flavor,  I subbed potatoes once they informed us table side that the hush puppy batter wasn't usable (which should have been a sign).  Again it's a clean establishment and nothing against the staff there.  But the food was not good and to in open view microwave food does not represent for your establishment well.  But aside from the microwave the actual taste of the food was a issue as well.  The ""grits"" we presented  as a grit fried cake type thing and lacked flavor. The shrimp and ""grits"" were not good.  The red snapper also lacked flavor and the potatoes I subbed once informed they couldn't do hush puppies were over buttered/garlic and no real seasoning.   Maybe over time they will improve their menu, or maybe not and just blame customers for their bad food.

I was there for lunch today and ""thought"" I had ordered the spicy fried shrimp for myself and my sister. I wasn't quite sure I got my order correct but the girl on the register said she ""knew what I wanted.""  I like the fried shrimp, fires and corn and that's what I've had before (along with the sea bass).  What I got was quite a bit different...there were 6 small shrimp curled up on a plate, heavily seasoned, and with zucchini (yuck!) and some sort of bean and rice mixture and scallions.  When I asked the girl about it she said, ""That's how they come and the NEXT time you can ask for substitutes.""  I ate the shrimp (WAY too hot"" for seasoning) and scraped the zucchini and most of the rice and beans off on to a napkin on the tray.  The best part of my lunch was the strawberry lemonade and cup of clam chowder, otherwise this was a ONE STAR review. .  My sister wasn't too pleased with her shrimp that were far to spicy for her, too.  I had ordered ""bar-b-que"" flavor shrimp for her and I think she got the same thing I did...probably ""blackened"" with Cajun spices.  She took most of hers home but I'd be surprised if she'll eat them.   Not too pleased at spending nearly $40 for this.

I'm trying to eat more healthy these days. I went with a grilled salmon salad. Because I got it to go, they put the fish in a separate container. A little wasteful yes, but that helped keep the fish warm and the salad fresh.

For a simple dish, I enjoyed it more than I expected. The salmon was grilled perfectly with a slight char but still tender and juicy. The salad was nice and crispy; it may have helped that I asked for the dressing on the side.

The restaurant is spacious with ample tables and nice decor. I really should just eat in next time, but I have a habit of always taking things to go. The employees were welcoming and friendly.

Crawfish Chowder: fantastic flavor, loaded with crawfish, not overly potatoed, veggies were still crisp, consistency was spot on. Every time. 

Louisiana Basket (spicy): shrimp were lightly breaded, succulent, and easy to bite through. Catfish was tender, clean, and buttery. Hush puppies were crumbly, but not too much, and had just the perfect amount of sweetness. Fries were so crispy and so wonderfully seasoned, they may be our favorite fries in the city. But the fried OYSTERS... oh Fish King... all hail to thee for your oysters. One cannot explain the joy in the tears that ran from my eyes as I bit into that juicy, briney, gem from the sea. Heavenly. 

Coleslaw: lightly sweet, lightly dressed, crisp, refreshing, palate cleansing. 

Strawberry lemonade with sweet tea (strawberry palmer): knock out!

Bread pudding (to go): wish I had more room to eat it in house, but it was fantastic after we got home. The anglaise sauce was thick and buttery. A+

This is the best jambalaya in Vegas, period. It's loaded with chicken, shrimp, and sausage. The roux is flavorful and delivers a well balanced kick. The garlic bread is buttery and toasted perfectly. The service is fast and friendly, plus because this is a fast casual restaurant, the prices can't be beat either.

I am a slow eater however, and by the time I got to the 3rd taco, the fish fell out of the shell. That's okay, I ate it off of the plate. The beans were a little spicy, but super yummy.

My older daughter ordered the chicken po' boy sandwich, and said it was really tasty. She doesn't like fish, so she was happy there was a non-fish option. My son ordered the fried catfish and shrimp, and also said it was really good. His came with two hushpuppies, and he shared one with me. I used to eat hushpuppies at Long John Silvers when I was a kid, and I have to say these was even better! I will order a side for myself next time. My parents both got the fried fish as well. My youngest and my grandson shared a kids meal, cheeseburger and fries. Also glad there was a non-fish option for them. Everyone enjoyed their food. My husband wasn't able to come, so I would love to bring him back.

Calamari were small, which is fine by me, tender and crispy, and plenty of them; very good.  Clam chowder is very good, but more of a Cajun/Creole style seasoning than New England style; lots of clams though.  Crawfish chowder is very similar.

Extensive menu.  No ""fishy"" or old seafood from what I've had and could smell, and all cooked perfectly. 

I haven't tried the grilled fish yet, but it looks great from what I saw at other tables.  I'm looking forward to trying it.

Key lime pie was nice and tangy!  Yay!

The portion sizes may be a little too big but quite the bang for your buck. You get the whole fish, head and all (I love that). We're not in Louisiana but the gumbo and jambalaya aren't too far off. Everything is quite tasty and I can't imagine any seafood lover not liking this place. Yummy tacos, the sides are delicious and one of the best burgers I've eaten in Las Vegas. I only wish they had a fish burger!",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,4,4,5,rQnYoq33OQx_zE2j8DB6cw

Such friendly staff and the service was great! The place is very clean and taken care of! Such a different style of cooking and there's nothing quite like it! The chef is a life time chef that definitely knows what he is doing!",A2gM-YdMxeiqd3NFlfbixw,1,1,5,Bah3ArBU24BNSN3SQq41HA

Let me say, the fish was fresh, it was flavorful and just down right delicious. If you want something new and different that revolves around fish, eat at the Fish King Grill. You won't regret it",pdWTS4nDyfOG44wu5L8JEg,1,1,5,ndBW2vzFtZtjxHgZhmmWgA
