I tried American Coney Island and it was some of the worst hot dogs I have had in my life. I tried the whole chili, onions, and mustard. I found this hot dog to be repulsive. There is no way I would recommend these hot dogs to anybody. I know they have other food items besides hotdogs which I did not try. The original Coney Dog will always be a Nathans hot dog hands down. Nothing even comes close to this. American Coney Island should actually consider adding flavor to their dogs. Instead of using pork products, why not use beef which would make the hot dog taste so much better. If one is really hungry, I suggest heading over to Pop Up Pizza at the Plaza Hotel, or Pizza Rock by the new Downtown Grand hotel. Now these places have damn good pizza.",9HeL22hFbvUbj5MeqGBfqg,0,0,1,9X53pM0U3lmOay7qJgm8HQ

The place itself is small, so groups of more than four people will have a hard time finding a place to sit together.

615353,2014-07-29,0,rt-aQTkNfILbxBuATdJ1dA,"The BEST Gyros West of the Mississippi! (Hope I spelled it correctly)

While I am spoiled by Chicago Vienna hot dogs, I have not tried and will not review the hot dogs here at American Coney Island, so this review is based solely on what I consider to be the BEST gyros and customer service West of the ""Deep River""!

Living in Los Angeles, it is nearly impossible to find GOOD authentic and fresh gyros that is cut of the spit.  The only places you will find it is at the seasonal Greek festivals around Easter time.  It saddens me that the closest place to get great gyros is on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas, but hey.....1 more reason to visit Sin City.

Upon my arrival at American Coney Island that is located in my favorite LV Casino ""The D"", I was met by mario, the restaurant manager.  Simply put Mario...ROCKS!  I like my gyros cooked and prepared special.  I like it CRISPY around the edges, a tad well done, and NOT finished on the grill.  So I asked mario if he could accommodate my special requests and he was more than happy to do so.  He told me to give him 20 minutes while he raised the heat on the spit and began to prepare my custom gyros order...perfect, gives me 20 minutes to hit Video Poker while I waited.

A 4 Deuces Jackpot, and 20 minutes later I came back to the a most BEAUTIFUL site; A perfectly cooked and over stuffed fresh gyros sandwich with my name on it!  It was a gorgeous site in deed as I savored every wonderful bite!  Gyros SO GOOD I wanted to crawl under the table like a dog and not be disturbed while SMACKING it down!  

Mario walked over to me and asked if it was to my liking and I told him he was Magic!  He did and excellent job!!  

THE BOTTOM LINE:
As stated above, this place has the BEST gyros and customer service West of the Mississippi!  This has become my favorite lunch spot and midnight snack shop while in LV!  Mario....keep up the good work!  I'll be back!  Enjoy!",d724Yf1hvRjgl9zx_-dR3g,4,2,5,-UdC6ynl1KfzZEt4EFtaOA

This place is in Las Vegas. On Fremont no less; getting upset that these hotdogs and fries are not up to an idealized standard is like being pissed that the Paris doesn't have the tip top bistro and cafe you remember when you drunkenly back packed through Europe. Do you refuse to set foot in Caesars because the busts of Roman emperors appears out of chronological order? Vegas has made a name for itself in cheap accessible entertainment and food that appeals to the masses. And is damn good. 

As far as chili dogs and fries go, this place won't disappoint. Basic fair that is done really well and served in less than 40 seconds. Stumble in, inhale everything in site, contemplate how you will work of the food crimes you committed, and continue the party.

Apparently this is a Detroit original, as some of the staff were straight from there.  Maybe that's why they weren't very happy to be there.  The place was pretty thrashed too, but I'm not sure if that was the staff's fault or the patrons.

There are many different ones but this one stood out because of the Coney Island name. It really helped that i had a huge craving for a hot dog like this and also the fact i was pretty intoxicated at the time. However there is one particular aspect of this hot dog that you can't ignore. The crunch the link has is rare. The moment you bite it you have that casing crunch that is so satisfying but also highlights how well cooked the wieners are. You will not find a hot dog like this where I'm from. The cheese is fresh and melts perfectly in seconds. The guys working there are really cool and were friendly enough to help us choose what the best option for vacationers like us. It is a quick bite to eat that will really satisfy your craving for a sloppy coney island hot dog. Do not pass by this place without trying it.,1PQYGqxBCMpAIkmFJi9orw,1,1,5,M4bm4xviUoisXR5HkopEXw

My first experience at American Coney Island came after losing a HUGE pot on the river at the Golden Nugget Poker Room. I needed some (very) late night comfort food, and remembered my friend recommending American Coney down the street at ""The D"" (which, incidentally, is the most unfortunate name for a casino ever) They specialize in Coney Island Hot Dogs which are, oddly enough, a Michigan staple food. Despite the time of night, the service was prompt and polite, and I was quickly served two Coney Dogs. 

My first impression was that they were good hot dogs, but maybe not worth the price. The hot dog was of excellent quality, with that signature ""snap"" that a Coney Dog is supposed to have. The chili - or ""Coney Sauce as they call it in Michigan - was a bit on the bland side. It was good, but I didn't feel like it stood out over any other hot dog chili I had before.

Maybe I was just in a sour puss mood because of dropping my pocket aces on a bad river beat, because I went there a few days later and enjoyed them much more. It was even later at night (pushing morning on this visit) but the service was cheery and fast. The hot dog was as great as before, but the chili really stood out this time. And even more so on the chili cheese fries I got as an accompaniment on this visit. I went the second time out of sheer convenience - I was playing late night ""old school"" slots at The D - but I'll be craving these Coney Dogs on future visits.

Most of the time I got blank stares, but now people know what I'm talking about.

A little background, coney islands are everywhere in Michigan.  You go there for breakfast anytime, Greek salads, pie which is kept in a rotating fridge and lost importantly un-healthy, cheap food.

American and Lafayette Coney Island are staples of Detroit and for whatever reason are right next to each other.  Back home I prefer Lafayette (maybe because it's dirtier?) but i was so pumped when I found out The D would be getting one.

What to Expect:

Freshly grilled greasy hot dogs with a famous chili sauce all over the top with onions and mustard.  You'll need wet naps if you expect to eat this with your hands, so grab a fork and knife.  You can expect the food to be cooked to order, yet FAST, one of the best things about a coney island.

To no surprise prices are a bit inflated from what I pay when I go back home to Michigan, but that is expected for something in a tourist stretch.  If you need to satisfy your junk food craving for the month, come here and you won't be disappointed.

Tip:  Not a hot dog fan?  You can get the ""loose"" version, which is ground beef inside of a hot dog bun with the sauce and fixings!",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,4,1,4,IX1YrdKoU05cFlIQnBufzA

The first thing I noticed was the insanely bright lights, going from the dark dim bars into basically a space that's lit like a doctor's office was a bit sobering. 

When ordering here make sure you know what you want before stepping up to the register, unless you like fake NY types getting on your case about taking too long or not being able to pay the bill, my friend had to go through this. I ordered a chili dog with chili fries, which is by the way the best decision ever when you have a belly full of booze; food that is salty, greasy and with no health benefits. In fact I ordered another booze sponge coated in chili and onions. 

Three stars? - Look it's chili dogs, French fries and few other random things, like Shawarma wraps? None of the food here is overwhelmingly good, it's all strictly utilitarian, it does the job.

The wife and I had just seen the Food Network special on Chili Dogs which happened to show the rivalry between American Coney Island Chili Dogs and Lafayette (the rivalry is real, as evidenced by all the pictures you can find inside of this small chili dog shop). While walking down Fremont Street I spotted this gem sticking out from the D casino. I thought it was too good to be true so I whipped out my trusty Yelp app and it was true!

The wife and I were super excited to see what all the hoopla was about, but knew that should wait until the time was right to have one of these bad boys. Well the time finally came the night before we were going to leave Vegas, and I was bummed... I should of had one before this time. They were delicious!

I ordered an original dog which includes: a soft steamed bun, a grilled weiner (with the most perfect snap on it), chili, mustard and onions. That's it, super simple, yet super good!

So after a morning of watching football and gambling on a Sunday we wanted drunk food.  So we decided on this place over McDonalds b/c I had seen in it on the news.

Walking in, it's way too bright, there's just stuff everywhere and it's just too much [see the pix it hurts your eyes and I love the American Flag but this is not tastefully done] After waiting about 5 mins b/c they had issues w/ the lady ordering in front of me it was finally my turn to experience the debacle [she even looked over at me rolled her eyes and wished me good luck].  Have you ever heard the expression ""too many cooks in the kitchen"", that's what happens here. There were 5 people behind the counter all bumping into each other, talking over each other, and not getting the job done.  They need more training. Plain and simple.

I had to order my order w/ the cash register guy 4 times before he repeated it, then the guy making the hotdogs still got it wrong. So, I had to look over the counter, coax him in the right direction, and get my dog right!!!!   My suggestion here: make a condiment bar.  That way people can put what they want on it, you don't have to do it behind the counter, nor worry about it, and the process would go much smoother.

They also don't have sauerkraut :(  that made me sad. I love a good kraut dog.

Chili was actually very good and the dog was great, crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside.  The other issue:  they put shredded cheese on the chili cheese fries and it doesn't melt enough when you are trying to eat it. So cheese strings fall all over the place.  Also, there's not ketchup on the tables????  So I had to go back up ask for extra ketchup and they squeezed it into the top of my hotdog container, my guess is b/c they were running out of bottles of ketchup???  They didn't even have containers to put the ketchup in [again condiment bar....like Roberto's Tacos does would be awesome].

So place needs work, hopefully they make it happen.  2 hotdogs and a order of chili cheese fries just shy of $13",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,5,0,2,7QG-442Qu9OtVE_jHX-vQA

I come from Hawaii--land of the overpriced everything, and I didn't think it could get worse. I was wrong.

The hot dogs here are the smallest dogs I've ever seen sold at a restaurant venue. It's absolutely nothing special. Chili, mustard, onions... and a skin that you sort of snap through as you bite it. What am I paying $3+ for? The skin? The chili wasn't anything special either, tasted like libby's canned chili. I truly don't understand what people are so smitten about.

(My dad always said people on the mainland are used to food with no taste, that our taste buds are different or something. Never really got how that could be true but I'm starting to consider it now.)

I happened to watch that TV show that featured the flagship venue in competition with it's sister venue. They made everything look amazing. That tiny tasteless dog I got here did not live up to the hype of that show. 

I really think the dogs are at least a dollar overpriced. Perhaps it's because it's Vegas and everything's either smaller or overpriced... I don't know. I feel like that's what people say about Hawaii: that it's just Hawaii and everything is overpriced but... Geez Louise, at least a $1.50 hot dog and drink combo from Costco is somehow far more tasteful.

At an average every-day hot dog stand at my college campus, I can get a jumbo dog (about 2.5 times bigger) with the works for the same price. I wanted to give two stars but my dissatisfaction with the value outweighs anything else for me.",6nXgmi-9TBBEVEyTKEeIsQ,2,0,1,M5XjSpJ-4sPzvPl9q8xMBg

Their menu is super simple which is a reflection of what they do well. I ordered the coney dog (without mustard) and fries.

I took it to the table and opened the styrofoam boxes and was pleasantly surprised. The hotdog was covered with chili and onions and was griddles to perfection. The fries were golden and inviting.

The fries were crispy and crunchy without the overly  greasy flavor you might expect from fries out of the bag.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised to find that both the standard Coney and my all-time favorite, the ""loose"" Coney burger were both authentic Detroit quality and flavor. The chili and the hot dog were just as you expect to get in Detroit. The hot dog bun wasn't steamed but I've eaten at many Coney islands in and around Detroit that were not either. 
I would give this review a 4 star if not for the almost double the price of both items I had. $3.85 Coney / $4.35 loose burger. 
Based on prices for other comparable eats you find in LV it's acceptable I suppose.
Coney lovers. You Will NOT be disappointed!",9_VokhdUtiJn3kY7xzK9TQ,1,0,3,H6YRr3RZeggg6cPJCM1WnQ

We were staying at the D Las Vegas and that Hot dog guy is advertised all over the casino and it caught my daughter's attention when we were inside the elevator. She said daddy look hot dogs yum and let's go there and eat.

So we woke up early the next morning and ordered a chili cheese fries, Coney, all American and a large orange soda. The order was served up really quick and the staff are friendly and helpful. Love the ""snap"" of the hot dogs when you bite into them. The chili and cheese and mustard and onions were delicious along with the hot dog.

They have a pretty roomy dining area and lots of memorabilia throughout the restaurant.

It was a pretty tasty chili cheese dog. We will definitely be back.",yu3vMi8XbG3w7iVWStdCTA,20,15,5,XhTZQDrDDmnFHjFXbHqErQ

And if you are like me and have been drinking, walking around Fremont all night and need a quick bite, this is the place. I enjoy my hot dog and I'm ready to conquer my next drink! 

They also serve fries, gyros( I've tried before and they are good), and burgers. Although, they told me they don't carry mayo the last time I was there. So, if you like burgers with that condiment than you are out of luck.

I ate at coney islands since i was born.  The loose and coney are great from here.  However, 1 star was for the guy with the attitude when i asked him where the meat was? His reply ""i been here for a while and this is how it is"".  Great customer service when ur paying $10 for a gyro. Finally they started putting cheese on their chili fries. $48 for 3 gyros 2 cokes and 1 loose burger? Look the pic",B92PPmbiUFIRg1fJXeEF7A,1,0,1,EbvDl6MHpiZezRehJnc-9w

I'm not one of those suburbanites that eats Coneys only when I'm in town for a wings or tigers game so with that being said the American Coney Island in Vegas is horrible compared to the Detroit location, it'll do if your from Detroit and you've relocated to Las Vegas and you need a fix, but if you're from Detroit and just visiting just wait til you get back home. I mentioned this to the workers in the Detroit location and they said their self ""everyone that visits the Vegas location says the same thing""

1. Buns weren't steamed
2. Gyros were skimpy compared to Detroit 
3. Chili was too thick 

Just a few of the differences I noticed, The workers here need to take a trip to Detroit and learn how it's really done",v2DLuBWsjzvNP5mW-MKZpg,4,1,1,4Pk1OWg9A9aT6tOEt9QMOw

This time I downed an excellent Coney Dog with a noticeable snap, including overflowing Chili, White Onions, and Mild Yellow Mustard on a nice soft bun.  No Ketchup was needed!  Unsalted French Fries were good, but some spud tips had darkened skin showing that would have been better clipped off.

One dog was not enough.  So, I had two--at $4.05 apiece, including tax!  No mess this time, except for some Chili on my fingers.

RATINGS FOR THIS EXPERIENCE:  

The Coney Dog -- 5 stars!
American Coney Island overall -- 4 stars

Great snap on the dog. Chili was kinda bland for my taste buds but was good texture/ consistency for a dog. 

The Fiancé tried the Gyro and loved the amount of sauce they used. I even had to ask if she ordered extra but no it was a normal serving. 

The employees seemed angry and not your open customer service how can I help you type. It was very reminiscent of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld and it made me laugh.  I'm sure thats not normal and we didn't take offense but deserved a mention as someone might not be ready for a ""NO DOG FOR YOU!!"" Type of service.

Dinning area was trashed but that may have been due to a recent rush and also could explain the bad attitudes behind the counter.

You get a good discount when you book a room at the D so don't throw the coupons away. Its worth a trip with the coupon.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,2,3,j_dRpRUTYbh5E-lqk2lItg

5939869,2018-06-07,0,rt-aQTkNfILbxBuATdJ1dA,I think it's time to be realistic about American Coney Island. They are now redundant. You can get better chili dogs at 7-Eleven and earn rewards at the same time. This business is taking advantage of its customers to the extreme. They went from 75¢ for extra chili on chili cheese fries to $2.25 for a small cup of chili. There's nothing spectacular about their chili it's the same kind that you can get at 7-Eleven and other gas stations. Then they want to charge 50¢ for tap water. I think you be better off going to McDonalds that is also located in The D. Once again you will get more for your money. Also I had to remind them this morning that they need to get exterminator to spray this place because there a cockroach coming out of the cracks on to the eating area. They didn't taking that seriously but I am sure an health inspector would. They should left this place in Detroit.,HAx6BZefc86jPtbgivE1sA,0,0,1,W2lzy3FA_EsXM3LznGrR8A
