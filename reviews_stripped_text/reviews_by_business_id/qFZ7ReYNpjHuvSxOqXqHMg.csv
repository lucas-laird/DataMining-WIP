Once in awhile I used to buy spicy tuna roll from Vons... the grocery store... that is just around the corner from Sumo Sushi. To my surprise the spicy tuna roll I ordered from Sumo Sushi looked and tasted exactly like the spicy tuna from Vons. Not what I expected from an actual sushi restaurant. 

Then my wife wanted a Futo Maki roll, a common sushi roll in Japan. The person taking my order had no idea what it was. 

The bill for 3 rolls and a cup of miso soup to go? $27. No need to ever go back.

Unfortunately, the food was ""OK"" and nothing really outstanding.  Our group of friends have lived in Japan for two years and traveled extensively throughout Japan and Asia.  Note:  This is a Korean owned and operated Japanese/sushi restaurant.  I am very particular about the shoyu sauce, especially the wasabi.  The sauce was very light, especially when eating sushi/sashimi and the wasabi was not  the freshly grated root of the wasabi plant.  I have tasted better wasabi from a tube.  The hamachi sashimi was good, not really fresh though; hamachi kama was dry; uni sushi was good; sauce for the yaki tori was very sweet.  Overall the sushi we ordered were fine, but seem to lack the ""orgasmic"" taste described by other reviewers.  I have eaten at many ""Japanese"" restaurants in Las Vegas and must admit most were ""failures.""  The only Japanese restaurant I would rate at the top would be Nobu's.

I cannot say anything about the sushi because I ordered the lunch special bento box. I ordered the teriyaki chicken. The bento box is suppose to come with teriyaki chicken, miso soup, side salad, tempura, rice and 5 pieces of California roll. 

I was first brought my miso soup, it was alright. Then my bento box came. They did not put any dressing on the salad, mine came with only 4 pieces of California roll, teriyaki chicken tasted like it was microwaved I ate one piece and did not like it but decided to try it a second time and I could not even swallow it. I am not a picky eater at all but wow that has got to be the worst chicken I've tasted in my life. I can't explain the texture either. It was like fake chicken lol. Now the tempura.. you would think how can someone mess up tempura? Well.. Sushi sumo you managed to do that too! It was overly battered, way too thick, mushy an oily. The tempura sauce that came with it was overly salty. 

I'm pretty disappointed because all I ate were 4 dinky California roll pieces, an alright bowl of miso soup, 2 bites of fake chicken and a few bites of soggy tempura. 

The hostess/server was friendly but it does not make up for the food. I mean, who serves a salad without dressing??? It was pretty pricey too for some limp microwave chicken.

Pros:

- AYCE...priced right and good selection between lunch/dinner menus...we ate like 30+ different items off the dinner

- Nicely portioned nigiri

- They have fresh oysters!

Cons:

- Some of the rolls tasted the same from one and another

- Udon was really simple

- Service was present...just completely without a friendly feel

Stars:

I almost never have to wait to be seated, and I never feel rushed or pressured.  They have a decent crowd, but it's a big place with plenty of room, and you never feel crowded like some of the other ayce places.  They have some great walled off booths that are very comfortable.  Service is fast and friendly.  It only took a couple visits for the staff to remember me, and now I feel like a welcomed regular every time I come in.

This is where I bring my out of town friends that don't have the joy of Vegas ayce in their cities, but often I come here by myself and enjoy a long, leisurely dinner and I'm always encouraged to order as much as I want and linger as long as I like as a welcomed guest.

The food is great, the menu is varied, and I like both the rolls and the nigiri.  My favorite is the ""something wrong 69"" roll and the Cajun albacore, which I get every time and definitely recommend.  There is also a pretty good selection of non seafood, so it's perfect if your group is craving sushi but there is the one friend in the bunch that doesn't want seafood.

If you stop by, ask for Nate and he'll take care of you.  He's awesome.",F-30y9xB6szLkn22jc8rQQ,1,0,5,Md4nXKH-3EQQJYKcDFWx_Q

    I love sushi and have tried it from many different places in Hawaii where I know the fish is fresh and Japanese culinary skill always on point. Trying this place, we were cautiously hopeful...its delicious!
  My boyfriend and I got the All You Can Eat dinner special for $26 (which is a steal! because sushi can be sooo expensive in any place), with that you are able to choose anything from a four page menu of different appetizers, rolls, nigiri and dessert BUT you are limited to only 90 minutes for your meal, which I will explain later can put a damper on the meal.
  There are some restrictions of course, for some of the premium items you are only allowed to order it once per AYCE paying person, I think the only one we got was the Spicy Tuna Salad, which was great, fresh greens with sashimi in a spicy sauce, yum! (Really loved that sauce). 
   Somer other dishes that we got and that I would recommend, are the Sunset roll, baked mussels 2pc (of which we got multiple orders of:), Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, and any of the Tempura Ice Cream desserts. This place has one of the better tasting ice cream tempuras I've had the pleasure of tasting :))
   **Ive reviewed this as 4 star and not 5 star based on the time it takes to place the order, there seemed to be 2 waitresses at the time we went (4pm) with a third coming as we left (5:30). Our water needed refilling and we wanted to put in some orders but took a while. 
   **For the AYCE you have 90 minutes approximately and they recommend you order only what you know you can eat so as not to waste :) This meant we ordered a few dishes at a time, and once finished put in another order. The only thing that bugged us is that since we could not get a waitress as regularly as we would've liked we were waiting to put in our order and then waiting for our dishes to come out long after we finished our previous order of dishes.
We still really enjoyed our meal and would come back, and our experience would only be better knowing which dishes we'd like to get on the first order :))",pvQXOcMN-wfjAUhRogV2FQ,0,0,4,2I0Db8g7qAvoo1T6737E8g

To start, the area's where it does miss is in overall ambiance and location.  As my friend mentioned in her review, the music was set to XM 30: Hits, which at times had rap music playing (Chingy's ""Ridin' Dirty"" in particular).  This took away quite a bit from our mood.  The other downside is the location.  The sushi here is good but not spectacular; being further out on Durango, it is not worth the drive.

The food itself was good, perhaps a little exspensive but again I don't know sushi as well.  We had a fried roll with cooked shrimp that was good but not spectacular.  

A few things I particularly like are the sushi bar with the sports playing above it and the HUGE salt-water fish tank stocked with a wolf eel, ray and lionfish.  It is worth just sitting there and having some sake to check this out.  

Also, considering how close it is to my friends apartment, I will probably be going here anytime I hang out with her simply because of how convenient it is.  It was particularly slow there, as well, on a Saturday night about 6pm, which is bad for them but good for us.

My father in law is a sushi fanatic and has only been to one AYCE in Las Vegas. We showed him why sumo sushi has become our favorite sushi restaurant in town. As we all enjoyed the huge selection of different dishes including the amazing app menu, we couldn't help to notice even with a semi filled restaurant, our server was as on top of everything. Our ice tea was never empty, and was very prompt when the nigiri we ordered was up . We never waited more than 10 minutes for our orders and were asked if we needed anything else every time. Our server always had a smile on her face , even while running to cater to her many tables. My mother in law is a foodie and is kinda tough when ordering, she was nothing but pleased at all her choices. The green lip mussels are my father in laws favorite, he stated that they were the best he's had. All in all, great selection of sushi, cozy atmosphere and probably some of the best service in any sushi restaurant in the southwest!

Service: waiter was hard to understand & obviously didn't understand us as several incorrect order were placed for our table. I mean seriously Age Dashi Tofo came out as ice cold tofu with green onions on it. The second? time it came out the tempura was soggy and practically undercooked with cold tofu inside yet again. Then multiple wrong rolls. We ended up just asking for a different waiter halfway thru but the food was so bad her good service couldn't help the situation. 

Food: yuck!!! Fish was not fresh. All rolls on the menu have the same 4 items, no variety at all. Every roll with shrimp tempura in it had rubbery and soggy tempura. Cucumber Salad and all cucumbers in the rolls were overripe/old cucumbers that were limp and off color. Seaweed salad had a lot of liquid in it and just tasted off. Octopus was so nasty, it had to be undercooked or something...This is my favorite sashimi to get and I spit it out.

Overall: Don't go!! I will never go again. There are sooooo many other sushi places within a couple blocks that are way worth the wait, extra block or dollar(yet almost all AYCE is the same price).",V08eVTVVTPzU29OU3Wm2jA,1,0,1,NAXJTBv_tOrUhE_IQVSc5A
1375841,2014-11-07,7,qFZ7ReYNpjHuvSxOqXqHMg,"I first heard about this spot from a buddy who said that Jjanga honed his skills here before breaking into his own restaurant. So, I was intrigued how similar the food was going to be. After eating here, I would say that even though I think Jjanga has the edge, this is a splendid sushi restaurant!

This place is located on the deep southwest side of town. I was surprised by how far, but I guess it's good that they are located near a lot of suburbs. I also noticed on a sign outside that they were under new management, so some of the food might have changed since Jjanga had worked there.

After walking in, I noticed everything was dark, but in a cool, modern way. The sushi bar is huge, and can hold a lot of people. One thing that kinda weirded me out is that it seems like the chefs are hovering above you as you eat due to the highness of the sushi bar center.

I ordered a lot of items, and while I thought they were pretty good, nothing was bad. The fish quality they were using was very good. I really didn't like the rice too much, it was a little too sour for my taste.

As far as apps go, the chicken katsu, octopus skewer, fresh oysters, and I thought the fried calamari were really good. I didn't care for the pork belly, ribeye steak, and grilled octopus. And I thought the udon was ok.

This is definitely a solid place, I would put it in the same league as a Sushi Mon. I would definitely recommend this spot to those living in the southwest who don't want to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain for some good sushi. This place is also a lot better than the original restaurant in Green valley. A quality place all around.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,10,8,4,auH-oohPAuGt4TuYy_nsSQ

They have an ""Under New Management"" sign on the outside wall although we understand management changed since before we moved here...so over 2 years ago.  Probably time to take it down although I guess it brings in new folks who want to see how ""New Management"" is getting things done.

1591844,2016-01-23,1,qFZ7ReYNpjHuvSxOqXqHMg,"I often look forward to trying new sushi places and oftentimes I wind up comparing their food, service, and overall dinning experience. At Sumo sushi 2, unfortunately, they would rank at the lowest of sushi places I would eat at. We ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI BENTO, JAPANESE LASAGNA ROLL, and CHICKEN KARAGE. The miso soup that came with the bento box was watered down (not sure but it tasted like the ones in the packet), the chicken was dry and a tad burnt, Japanese lasagna was actually good however it took 3 tries to actually get my order right (I don't like eel sauce so I asked not to put it, but off course they got that wrong too), and lastly we waited about 30 minutes for our chicken karage to come out.

Food wise I'd give it a 6.5-7 out of 10. I think they need to eliminate their menus though. They have menus on the table under the glass plus they have the actual All You Can Eat menus they provide you with. I just think it's too much and it confuses the customer. Meanwhile, service needs a whole lot of improvement. There seems to be a lack of communication between waitstaff because the two servers kept asking the same questions to us. We also had to repeat our orders to them because it seemed there was some mix up, which probably could explain why our karage took so long and when we got it it did not look like chicken strips take 45 minutes to cook. Also, I think servers need better training on the OS because we got charged multiple times and our total was nearly doubled. 

Overall, I probably will not come back here. I'll save myself the stress and eat somewhere else. I am, however, giving the business two stars because the Japanese lasagna was pretty good and the waitstaff despite everything we experienced gave us a complimentary sushi to go. But sorry Sumo Sushi 2, I was not impressed. Perhaps you guys might try going on Restaurant Impossible and ask Gordon Ramsay to save you guys.",JkSMnRFq4a-VkYhhgwSKXw,1,0,2,YH2nf0LsL8RC3h5x-Pm2Zw

Service here is decent.  On busy nights, the service is impeccable.  Servers will ask how the food is and if we need anything else.  But, when there are very few people, the service is very slow and inhospitable.  Strange.

ON TO THE REVIEW!!

Sadly there's not much to report. I completely agree with everything Tony T. wrote in his review dated on 2/10/2011

The price for AYCE is still +/- 25 bucks, tax, and your basic drink isnt included. 

I very strongly would like to confirm Tony's final comment in his review about the Korean influence with the sauces. A lot of the rolls and special items were heavily sauce dependent which did and didnt work out in their advantage a few times. 

Throwing out a few things of my own:

Cucumber Salad
 - Wasnt exactly fresh and the cucumbers have been swimming in vinegar for way too long giving them a soft soaked vinegar exploding result when you bite into them

Deep Fried Baby Octopus
 - Hope octopi reproduce like it's cool because these were simply amazing. Remember that comment about heavily sauce dependent? Balance was damn near perfect

Kamikaze Roll
- Pretty much a spicy tuna with some eel sauce. To me the eel sauce was poured on top of the spicy tuna rolls and the rice soaked it up like us bar hopping on Fremont street. Personal Preference but would have been better if they sauced the plate then added the rolls

Cherry Blossom 
- Yeah the one thing i ordered and didnt finish because i didnt really like it too much. To the best of my memory the menu described it as fried soft shell crab on the outside, Krab and cucumber and other stuff on the inside, avocado on the outside drizzled with some sort of sauce. The presentation was excellent it was just beautiful to look at. It itself on the other hand wasnt exactly to my liking and it's due to personal preference not due to anything on their part. Too little soft shelled crab, too much Krab and too much sauce ended it for me. 

Baked Mussels 
- Why is it that there are ALWAYS baked mussels on the menu at almost every sushi place but NO ONE orders a plate and when the mussels come out for the one guy that orders it he gets mugged? These were great, they even took the time to remove them from the shells and cut them in half for more bite sized pieces. Also not a lot of mayo before being baked. extra points in my book.

Bacon Wrapped Asparagus
- Wait wait wait...bacon wrapped asparagus on an AYCE sushi menu?!?! I had 2 they were amazing...

Cajun Albacore
 - A bit on the salty side from the Cajun dry spice rub. Albacore was fresh 

So yeah that's about it. I would recommend this place to people who enjoy sushi without a serious love for raw fish.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,1,4,vEpXqkW7A5Lf2FgsQs1kUA

First, the portions of the plates on the AYCE menu have either shrunk or the plates they serve it on have gotten bigger. Second, coming from a family who is a coniseour of fish (raw and cooked) the quality of the fish is definitely not as fresh. 

The service was for lack of better words confusing. They had maybe 4-5 people on the floor but only one was allowed to take orders?!? It took a long time for us to place our second round.

I think consistency is a key component when building a clientele base and this restaurant is definitely not adhering to that policy with their sloppy rolls, heavy rice, and selective customer service.  For the price and quality of fish, it is definitely not worth the 5 minute drive up Warm Springs.

There's also who's your ex-wife, screaming o, oysters, agedashi tofu, mix karai, tonkotsu ramen. Again enjoyed them all. They usually have special item that are included on the AYCE menu or not, just ask.

A friend and I were visiting Las Vegas from Chicago and drove out to ""the burbs"" (sincere apologies to locals, but to us that means anywhere more than a mile or two from The Strip or Fremont Street) to meet friends who live in town. This was their go-to sushi joint and they promised us that the weekends were when this place really shines.

We passed through the door and you would swear that our friends were royalty. The waitstaff and several of the sushi chefs erupted in welcoming shouts and quickly escorted us to our seats right alongside the sushi bar.

Before I could even get my bearings, we were nearly instantly inundated with wonderful-looking maki rolls, tall bottles of Sapporo, sake bombs and what I can only describe as the most hilarious PG-13 sushi chef live performance that fell somewhere between Coyote Ugly bar antics, a Japanese game show and an amateur striptease. We were literally laughing off our seats and couldn't get enough (we have the cell phone videos to prove it!). If the food were just OK, I still would have loved this place, but I'm a sushi lover and this place delivered flash AND substance!

After a whirlwind 2-hour experience, we whisked ourselves out of Sumo Sushi 2 absolutely stuffed and absolutely happy. I can't wait to visit Las Vegas again and stop by this nondescript little strip mall sushi joint again.

Back home in Cali, no matter where I've gone (except my one fav place that's been out of business for at least 6-7 yrs now) they try to fill you up on rice and the quality of the fish isn't exactly the best.

By chance we had not actually gone to this particular sushi bar until today at lunch.  As normal with all sushi bars, we are asked if we want the ""all you can eat"", but were more interested in lunch specials and were seated at a booth.

 We ordered a bento box and a sashimi platter and waited... and waited.  We watched as the people were up at the rail getting served by the sushi chef.  New folks would sit at the rail and get served and yet we just sat waiting.  As we were getting up to walk out after approximately 45-min, the waitress brought out our food.  
Concerning the sushi, they made a mistake on the girlfriend's order (spicy tuna instead of regular) and they quickly redid it, but it was loosely wrapped and falling apart.  The salmon teriyaki was ok, but there was something ""wrong"" with the tempura.  It was almost soggy.  The miso soup was probably the worse we have ever had at a sushi restaurant.

The presentation of each plate is A+. The quantity A+. The quality B- almost a C. 

On the menu for AYCE a lot of the sushi rolls stated they had crab in them. I asked if they used real crab and was told they use imitation crab and they also use imitation lobster. That was a huge disappointment. Most places that use imitation crab spells crab with a ""K.""  It is very misleading to state crab on the menu if it is an imitation. The portion size is huge. I did observe that they fill a lot their rolls with imitation crab to make each roll full. I could only each two rolls and that was because I forced myself. One roll made me full. 

I did leave room for dessert and that was the best part. I love the ice cream Mochi, red bean ice cream and fried tempura ice cream. I also had the green tea and it was not very good. 

It is a very nice place. The decor is Japanese theme  and the service was very attentive. But I gave 3 stars because the quality of the food was ok.

We then found two more hairs in our sushi rolls. Come on! When we notified our server, she was apologetic and had the sushi chef re-make our roll. But at that point it was hard to swallow anymore food. Not to mention, our server took forever in bringing us our bill. They were literally wiping down tables for closing, when I had to get up and seek her out to pay.

-Sumo isn't a bad little spot. It's got a fairly nice amount of seating, and appears to be kept up pretty well. They also have a pretty good size fish tank that sits in the middle of the restaurant, which the kids will have fun checking out. 

Eats, how are they?
-They've got a decent sized menu, so we opted for the $24.95 AYCE. I'm no sushi expert, but if I had to guess, they were using a steak knife for some of the nigiri cuts. With that, nothing was terrible, but nothing really stood out either. If I had to make some recommendations, I'd say check out at least the Pepper Seared Tuna & Yuzu Yellowtail. Some of the rolls our table were okay, but nothing I would normally order myself. I will say they have a pretty good green tea mochi ice cream to finish off with though. 

Let's talk about service...
-Garbage! We literally had to ask for fresh wasabi SIX times, and one of those times was before we even ordered all our food...hoping it'd come out before the waives of fish. And if you want a water, you better ask 2 or more people at least 3 times each, all while crossing your fingers and hoping one of them pulls through with a glass. Oh, and let me not forget to mention that these jokers add an auto 20% grat to parties of 6 for this exceptional service. 

Potential to come back?
-Maybe if you're going to buy me lunch. Otherwise, I'd say save your $25 for something else. I don't even do AYCE that often, but this wouldn't be my first choice...or my 10th.

I was willing to give the place a 2nd try since we always order takeout from there. I will not go back simply for the fact that the resturant added a $10.00 tip equalling out $16.00.

You don't need to wait for your server to run it out to you since the sushi chef gives it to you right when they make it!

We were open minded when the new owners took over earlier in the year and do miss Choo Choo. He was always the reason for our visits as his personality was pure entertainment. They cleared the place of the old help and brought in a new crew that I warmed up to. 

The new menu was an improvement, but the service became a circus. You would have a person take a drink order and then every 30 seconds like a comedy show another person would come by and ask the same thing. Guess they do not understand sections? This did slowly go away, but now many of the servers, particularly female are pushy, rude, do not listen, and anticipate what you want rather than listening to you and getting it right the fist time. 

The food is never truly bad, but inconsistent. I can deal with the rice game, but don't serve me junk. Different days bring different people and thus different quality, different recipes, contrary to the menu and if they are busy, even with a ton of staff, hang it up as it will be a waste of your time.

Ok so we wanted to try something new its by our house and it had decent reviews what a mistake! 

We ordered AYCE because we were hungry and both wanted 3 or 4 rolls and some dessert. I ordered a lasagna roll, the crazy ass roll and the deep fried Cali roll. The lasagna roll was ok at best and that's stretching it, then came my deep fried Cali roll I took one bite and was totally disgusted!!!! The tempura was hard as a rock and just tasted wrong and the crab wasn't fresh at all it tasted nasty as if it were fake! Trying to eat this was so hard I wanted to throw up every bite I took by the 4 roll I spit it out threw up in my mouth and said fuck it id rather pay extra on top of my AYCE price then eat another bite of this roll! Oh and mind you I'm already full by now because the rolls are double the size of a regular sushi place!  If I had known that I wouldn't have ordered AYCE in the first place! So moving on, I still have my 3rd roll coming when it came I took one look at it and said I can't eat this! I was already sick to my stomach by then from their poor quality sushi! 

What a waste of our money! Me and my fiancé are both sick from this place. Worst sushi I have ever had!!!!

69!!!! 
YUMMY!!!!!

What happened here? My mouth and body were just trippen!

I've had some good sushi in my lifetime but boy oh boy was this place AWESOME! It always helps to know someone to who works whereever you go. It also helps to tell them what you like and let them make special things for you that are on and off the menu. MmmMMMM! I'm SOOOOO going back soon!

The first thing I had was the ORGASM. It was tuna sashimi with other things and topped with some special sauce. Whatever it was, it did give me my first orgasm and set my body up for the next orgasms as well!!!
My FAVE rolls were the 69 roll (yes 69 roll is the name) and the Tuna Naruto roll (I think that was the name). 

The 69 roll was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo good!!!!!!!!! It had this special garlic sauce that was just amazing on the roll. WOW. SO friggin good.

Of course we had sake bombs which was complementary to the rolls, sashimi, and special stuff we had. MmmMMM! 

You MUST go to Sumo Sushi 2. 
Tell them what you like and let them make you some stuff.
Be nice and hook up my buddies with some beer and sake bombs!
Have a great time and get ready for a MOUTH-GASM!!!!!!!!!",61KHh-BznR__JiiN5iMwHg,13,11,5,X6wuYQeLKsWtfmRg3Lgylg

If you're Gonna compare the the sushi at Smith's and here then you probably do not know what good sushi is. The service was exceptional! We arrived around 7pm with a party of 7 adults and 2 children,  We was seated right away. Our servers were prompt with our orders and there wasn't a bad dish that came to our table. This was by far the best ayce joints I've been to in town. 

Honestly I had my doubts about coming here after reading the reviews, and I'm glad I came. I knew this place was gonna be a go to spot for ayce after taking my first bite. 
The nori was fresh and crispy which is what you want in a sushi roll, not the soggy chewy ones that other ayce sushi joints serve you with. The fish was fresh and did not have any odors, if you can tell a fresh fish from one that was sitting in the cooler for days then you know what I'm talking about when it comes to what is fresh and what isn't. Being able to tell what's in your sushi also determines how well you know your sushi, just because it smells ""fishy"" doesn't always mean it isn't fresh unless you got a salmon nigiri that gave away an odor then you definitely have a problem. Which in our case the salmon nigiri was great!! Or other nigiris for that matter. 

The highlight of my night was how fresh everything was especially the Uni which blew my mind on how fresh and buttery, it almost tasted like they picked it straight from the ocean before serving it. I've had Uni at other places at it almost makes me gag and force my self to swallow it. I had no problems doing that here.

3863714,2013-08-12,0,qFZ7ReYNpjHuvSxOqXqHMg,"Highly disappointing is an understatement. 

My sister and I visited Sumo Sushi 2 a couple of weeks ago after her efforts of convincing me for months of the great quality and innovative sushi. When we arrived, we were promptly seated in a table near the sushi bar and of course, we ordered AYCE for two. I have to be honest, I don't quite remember the exact rolls she and I ordered but I do distinctly remember ordering only 3 rolls and a few appetizers. (Now, let me put this into perspective: when my sister and I go to Umiya, we probably order 7 rolls, at least 23 orders of nigiri, and then a couple of appetizers and dessert so ordering 3 rolls and a handful of appetizers is NOTHING to us.)

To put it shortly, I feel like the biggest downfall of this place was their usage of sodium. The rolls weren't impressive because it was drenched in sauce which some tasted too tangy or too salty. We tried some of the ""special"" sushi appetizers and it was soaking wet with sriracha and soy sauce. This place is a match made in heaven for those who suffer from hyponatremia. Even though we tried to stick to what fellow Yelpers recommended, they simply didn't even come across as decent. And let me tell ya, I'm not a difficult girl to please when it comes to sushi. I think that the best thing I had was the coconut shrimp and even then, it was fried a little too much and too sticky for my taste buds.  

The food was mediocre but service definitely rivaled it. For some reason the waiter had this talent of impeccable timing to check on us when we didn't need anything and disappearing into thin air when we needed something. On the other hand, the people who were having a ball drinking sake bombs with the sushi chefs were checked up on very often. Hm, I wonder why.  

My sister was extremely disappointed as well. She remembers visiting this place a couple of months back and having an amazing experience with service and food. 

The verdict is that I most definitely won't be coming back. I don't recommend this place one way or the other and hope that they make major changes soon.",d3SolCjmhX6hEyy7IWP71w,4,0,1,_Rlzi5tZMXo5uI-PLPbz5Q

The atmosphere was nice, it's got flat screen TV on all side of the resto. The NCAA finals were on all every TV when we were here... Duke vs. Butler. Unfortunately, Duke won by 2 pts.

We ordered quite a few rolls! The 69 roll was awesome! it has a very unique sauce on it. The orgasm roll (not really a roll, just sashimi on it) was not bad. Unfortunately, that's the only 2 rolls we liked. We also tried what the heck roll, which was way too sweet for our taste, and another roll that's so forgetful that I dont even remember the name of it. My mom ordered unagi-ju. It has this sour taste to it, which is kinda weird cuz it's supposed to taste sweet.

If you eat here, definitely order the 69 roll, but other than that, nothing else is too special. I dont think I'll come back here again next time, esp since it's so out of the way from the strip.",DVwRIXFTudBno4kaRaezYA,0,0,3,WPtBOqMfmtK-Nb3DSFftUQ

Our server was HORRIBLE. He was insanely rude, to the point where it was almost condescending when he was speaking to us. I really wish they had names of the receipt because the service from him was so off putting I would've like to speak to his manager about his attitude problem. There was no reason for him to rush us through dinner either. As there was only 1 other small party.

I had my eyes on the kids, so i really didn't pay much attention to details, but i do recall the decor was quite lovely with a big ass aquarium in the room.

We ordered bunch of sushi stuff for the table as well as other side dishes, but none were memorable. Even so, our sashimi were just OK at best.   We saved 50bucks from http://Restaurant.com and our tab was still $240.  Kind of made me think that we should have gone to AYCE instead after all.  Next time i won't doubt those brats lol

We went mainly for the kids since they wanted to eat sushi, so it was nice to take those rug rats out to dinner in a mature setting.  Hopefully they didn't agitated the other patrons in the restaurant because i did not have the heart to yell at the boys since they are not my own.  The children didn't eat much of the sushi stuff after a while, so we got them a bowl of udon to share amongst themselves.  Not sure if that did the trick, but it did kept them quiet for a good 5min :P

It looked like the restaurant only had two servers. I felt bad for them at first but I didnt towards the end of the night. When we told them the problems with our food, they shrugged us off. On top of that the sushi chef gave my family a dirty look for voicing our concerns with the food. It was as if they were only interested in satisfying their customers at the sushi bar.

Decor isn't bad when we first entered the restaurant. We sat at the bar. That was when things started to seem odd. One of the sushi cooks offered us an order of seared tuna before we even ordered. That was a pleasant start,  but soon we felt the creepy stare of a cook. It was so uncomfortable that it interrupted our conversation. He then asked if we were of ""Asian descent"". We awkwardly answered and tried to continue with a serious conversation we were having. But he was still staring! 
There were only a few diners on a Saturday night. Yet, the service was hilariously bad. The servers were inattentive. We had to flag them down several times for each request. They had gotten our orders wrong twice. The cooks were busy having beers and chatting with a couple of guys. We were curious as to who was going to make our food.
As for the food... The very first dish we received had a hair on the sushi! That was a first for either of us. The cook we handed it right back to had an ""oops"" expression on his face. Half of the food was overseasoned/salty. 
When we opened up our Yelp app to look up this restaurant, a staff member popped up from behind us and asked if we wanted some ice cream when we had barely began to eat. He explained that he was just joking because he saw that we were on Yelp. I'm speechless. After we got our checks, paid and started to leave,  there was no one to say 'goodnight', 'please, come back again' or 'thank you'.

We sat at the bar and were the only ones in the place the majority of the time. 
For us there's always a check list of things a sushi place has to have in order for us to come back or become regulars and it always seems to be impossible to get everything
Good Tuna Nigiri 
Good baked green mussels
Good customer service ( on bussing plates and refills) 
Being able to get half rolls
a couple of good rolls
And good unlimited desserts
And Sumo Sushi had all of this and more. The garlic tuna was the best I've had anywhere and so was the yuzu yellowtail. The other nigiri was all good as well (shrimp, peppered tuna, octopus, and squid) but the GT and YT really took the cake. 
For rolls we only got a joe special since we splurged on nigiri and appetizers which there is a good selection of both, which was pretty good but not super memorable the next day. 
For apps we got the Garlic edamame which was really good. The ahi poke was kind of spicy and separated the seaweed and tuna which I liked but really good. The creamy shrimp was a sort of shrimp crab Rangoon which I was a fan of. Baked green mussels here were pretty good as well not particularly different than anywhere but still pretty good. We also got the tuna sashimi which I can't remember what is was called but it was really good but comes as a one per person item. 
Now the dessert is where I will love a place and come back or not and the desserts here were really good because the only one per person item was the mochi which left us with Vanilla, green tea, strawberry cheesecake ice cream and tempura ice cream as well. All the ice cream was really good. The green tea was the sweet creamy tasting kind and the strawberry cheese cake was really good.

Food:
Dancing Tiger Roll just didn't work. It might have been the eel sauce. Ignoring the eel sauce, the ingredients in the inside seem fine. The 69 roll was a really good roll overall. The gyoza was fine. Didn't get a chance to try Uni or Toro to really test this place.

Service: 
When we wanted to get Uni, the sushi chef recommended against because the quality wasn't that great. That gets them some points for being honest, but is this the norm?

Price:
Pre Restaurant.com GC, this place is more expensive about $2 or $3 more than Naked Fish across the menu. This seems minimal, when you order a lot of rolls it really ads up. However, once you use the $25 off of $50 on Dinner Only, things start to get more affordable. There is usually always an 80% Off code towards the end of the month.

4990831,2016-12-30,0,qFZ7ReYNpjHuvSxOqXqHMg,"I'll start with the cons: the front doesnt look appealing, seemed a bit ""cheap"" but that's because I'm from a competitive and aggressive sushi area. During service, a few missed orders but it's AYCE so it's forgiven. I do wish there was a hostess so I wasn't walking in, awkwardly asking questions and for a seat. With that being said, I wouldn't say it should stray you away from trying this place. 

Here's the pros: great food, great options for an AYCE. For a casual eater, there's probably a lot of items you've never tried that they offer and that is a good thing. I, myself, am quite experienced and enjoy a variety of things and this place was able to offer that for a $25 ish AYCE (dinner). It is Korean owned so I enjoy the quality/variety of items offered.

The chef (he calls himself the rookie), Siko (pronounced See-ko), was nothing short of awesome. I ordered Saba, Hamachi, and Ika to start. The female server came and suggested the Tuna Poke and I also ordered an agedashi tofu along with it. I was content. The rice was tasty but a bit wet (nigiri fell apart a few times). But that's okay because most place don't offer flavorful sushi rice. I was most impress by the fish, it had a soft and fresh texture which I enjoyed immensely. The tuna poke was flavorful and the agedashi tofu was alright. I followed up by ordering uni, amaebi, sake, and hirame nigiri with an order of pork belly and fresh oyster. The sushi chef did forget my hirame but it did not faze me as I was content with the offerings served. The pork belly was flavorful and served on a sizzling plate (tasted like Korean marinaded pork belly). The fresh oyster was delightful and composed with massago, chopped scallions, spicy sauce (sriricha?), sweet sesame oil soy with a touch of yuzu (I assume). The uni was creamy. I did not care for the sweet shrimp and they don't fry the head unfortunately (bummer!).
I then ended it with a spicy tuna handroll, hamachi roll, and seaweed salad. The owner then served up another order of oyster. I ate everything with a few bites of rice leftover. Keep in mind, this is how they get you in AYCE, they fill you up with rice so stray away from rolls if you want your money's worth.
At the end I was full. I had a nice conversation with the sushi chef. The owner talked to me for a little and the server was sweet offering me ice cream.
I tipped the house 22% and another $5 to the sushi bar because I was satisfied. 

All in all, don't judge it by the front. It's a decent hole in the wall. I will visit again very soon.

A few things to help: all Front-of-house should introduce themselves and be more attentive. Apologize for missing orders even though it's usually not a big deal. But very minimal things to the whole experience, I enjoyed it very much. Thank you! 

You should definitely try it!",f_z_JtNybp_0d0eWO75JUQ,3,0,4,AEJLnf99v5k9e2amHcHXpw

Walking in, I took a look at the menu and decided to give it a shot. Looking at the AYCE menu, I decided to go with a la carte. Thank god I did.

Ordering a few simple rolls, they came out promptly but were warm and soggy - the opposite of fresh. All rolls were chewy (should have ordered soy paper for the extra charge) and the Philly roll had enough cream cheese to choke a horse. Add to this the fact that the waters came out in dirty glasses with no ice and that gives a full snapshot of the meal. 

Once I stomach down a few pieces, I looked down to find my napkin and unfortunately saw the sides of the ""white"" table cloth. These resembled a scene out of CSI.

Immediately asking for the check, we walked out with no intent on returning and very thankful we steered clear of the AYCE option.

We were impressed about the kid friendly touches, like the Barbi plate they brought out for her, and the cute bear-faced bento box her food was served in. But then the food came, and it all went downhill.  The chicken in the bento box was about as rubbery as I've ever seen, and she wouldn't touch it.  The fries were fresh, hot, and bland as the day is long.  The pork tonkatsu was fried through to the point of being cardboardy.  For my wife and I, the only way we could describe the sushi was that it tasted ""handled"".  The rice was fine, but the fish, and I mean no roll was spared, seemed to be strangely soft and closer to room temperature than I'm used to.  It really seemed like someone had rolled it around in their hands for an awkwardly long period of time before plating.  Can't say whether it was the quality of the fish or technique, but we won't be going back to investigate further, which is a shame, since the setting and service would have made this place a staple if the food was even just passable.",ZjPxxQoJGoITBHxKKVKJUQ,0,0,2,_aulSZSiUX_1I5ktTSTNDQ

They are so friendly, that when I took my cousin's here one time for dinner they were all over them.  LOL.  They just loved how cute my cousins are.  :)  The best sushi guy I've had, Tak, works there too.  He knows his ingredients, and knows how to entertain the taste buds.  I come here as much as I can.  I'll even walk there even if i have to.  Yeah, I'm a fan of their menu.

From the outside, it doesn't seem like it's a great place to eat at.  But, once you step in it's like being in a whole different world.  The feng shui is perfect.  To the right are the hostesses ready to greet me and seat me down.  There's really no wait since I go at the right time.  I mostly go to the bar since I like talking to the chefs.  They're just awesome.  Tak is the best too.  He talks only as much as he needs to and is very polite.  To the left by the entrance a few feet away from the bar, a huge fish tank lies there with a lot of tropical fish.  I could see Nemo swimming around.

As soon as I'm seated, Tak has a cucumber salad garnished with crab meat on top ready for me to eat.  The first item I order is, of course, the oysters.  The oysters in here are huge and plump.  Very tasteful.  It's prepared with salmon roe on top, green onions, and some soy sauce mixture with something in it.  It's so tasty.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back for it.

For my next item, I chose a crunchy roll #2.  This a sushi roll with shrimp, calamari, crab, cucumbers, and I think avocado in eel sauce.  Over the rice, there's tempura crumbs coating it.  The best part of the whole Sumo Sushi 2 experience is Tak's Special.  It's a lightly seared tuna in some kind of soy sauce mixture dressed in fried sweet onions.  It's so simple but when combined in my mouth, it's like fireworks.  The blend of the tuna with the crunchy onions compliment each other.

If you like Poki, this is the place to eat it.  The way it's made is different from all the other sushi spots I've eaten at.  It's a little spicy and has a good kick in it.  The other great sushis are the Lasagna, Joe, and so many others that I can't think of it.  I've had majority of their sushis but they're named differently and the ingredients are like none I've had before.  

The dessert to go for is the Fried Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream.  I couldn't finish it myself and would require at least two people to devour it.  Mochi is good too, but anyone can get that from the store.  I love the fact it's not too expensive.  But for those that love to eat a lot, maybe it might be a little pricey.

5329627,2008-07-21,0,qFZ7ReYNpjHuvSxOqXqHMg,"This is a good place overall, but nothing spectacular.

Let me describe my experiences at this place...

Food: The food is definitely not bad. It's not the best sushi place I've been to, but it's deifnitely better than most shopping center-located sushi places. The taste was good and fish fresh. I loved their unique combinations and dish names such as ""Orgasm"" etc. It was modern and fun. The rolls were extremely average, albeit fresh. Not too much taste, yet freshness was definitely top notch. 

Service: Waitresses were not very knowledgeable about their dishes or specials. I found two of the three servers to be sub-par in their cuisine knowledge, price knowledge and friendly attitude. They were passable, but definitely not great on the three occasions that I dined here. Sushi chef was okay, but not nearly as friendly as at other places. The wait staff overall seemed annoyed that I visited for lunch, although I did drop over $100 on the bill...which brings me to the next topic...

Price: Overpriced. By far. Check out my other sushi places reviews--this by far was one of the most expensive. For lunch, no all you can eat sushi was offered and individual pricing was definitely on the high side, considering that this place is located in a shopping center and that food was good, but not spectacular by any means

Ambience and Atmosphere--excellent. In this aspect this is definitely one of the best places--everything from black granite counter tops, to cloth napkins to a humongous fish tank circling the dining room--this place screems style and modern fashion. I loved that it is located in a strip mall, but feels like you are dining on the strip. I did not notice any rap music, in fact music was a subdued elevator type of music, which suited my eating style just fine.

Overall, this is not a bad place. But, there are definitely better in a neighborhood. If you have coupons to use for this place or don't care how much money you spend, then this is definitely an excellent choice, but if money is at least a small issue, than there are better options near by. Although, I may visit this place again in the near future. Not all bad, but not terribly exciting is my verdict for Sumo 2",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,0,0,3,pvOXw00ctugKSMHPWYOwjg

5918559,2011-02-11,2,qFZ7ReYNpjHuvSxOqXqHMg,"The staff at Sumo Sushi 2 are indeed pretty awesome.  They are friendly, attentive, and efficient.

I read some Yelp reviews earlier in the day, and decided I was feeling in the mood for sushi and trying a new place, so when my GPS listed Sumo Sushi as one of the nearby sushi restaurant I knew right away that that was where I was going to go for dinner.

The ambiance was great. Right when you walk in, you can see large aquariums (salt water) with colorful fish swimming about.  The lighting is on the dimmer side, which sets a good atmosphere for those on a romantic dinner.

I tried their AYCE menu (~$26 +tax).  And overall I thought the fish served were fresh, including their special sashimi (3 options available on the AYCE menu).

Special Sashimi:
Tuna Karai - basically cubes of tuna with a blend of spicy seasoning.  They can make this really spicy if you request it, but it was pretty spicy without any special request.  So unless you can handle the heat, don't try to impress anyone asking for 9/10, then not being able to finish it :p  It was good, if you like tuna.

Cocaine - this one was good too, slightly different flavors, but not all that different.

Screaming Orgasm - slices of fish dressed in their ""Orgasm"" sauce.  Not bad.

I mostly had their nigiri and some items from the appetizer section.  The nigiri were good, except they didn't have uni when I went, so that was rather disappointing.  Of the items on the appetizer section, my favorite is the Kurobuta Sausage, which was basically 1 pork sausage sliced up and served with ketchup. In hindsight, I should have ordered like 2 or 3 of these (since I don't think it is on the menu at other AYCE sushi restaurants).

Of the rolls, I was only able to ordered two:

Tuna Naruto - refreshing roll of various fish (salmon, tuna, krab) wrapped in cucumber.  (No rice).  The chef who prepared it has good knife skill, so it turned out looking as tasty as it was beautiful.  

Something Wrong #69 - not a bad roll, but drenched in way too much spicy garlic ponzu sauce or was it regular soy sauce (?), because it was so salty that I drank 2 cups of hot tea trying to finish it all.

After that I was done. Too much rice + hot tea = bloated stomach.

Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Price: 4/5 reasonable for AYCE.
Location: Off the Durango exit on 215, so great for locals, but not for out of town visitors.

4/5 in my book.  And just FYI, the sushi has Korean influence in terms of the way they flavor their special sauces, rolls and such.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,6,4,J9NtzP8NsQ8lvnEyG_XF_A

Can't wait to go back! Get the lobster crunch roll!!!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,2,2,5,ObmkwT6ZcuQEmSJLpZ6kYg
