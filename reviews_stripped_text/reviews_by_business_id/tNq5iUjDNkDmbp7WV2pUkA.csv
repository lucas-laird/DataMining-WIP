1100892,2018-02-28,0,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,Tried this place for the first time and was not as impressed as other sushi burrito places nearby. They served less protein for more money and it was not as fresh. They do however have better appetizers at a good price point!,-_8AvV32XmwCGEplSF6NcQ,0,0,2,_fkIwp29XLsD-idZm_RvOw

I ordered the "" Tropicana"" sushi burrito, very bland, no flavor what's so ever . Had a little bit of shrimp a couple of avocado slices and some mango pieces. More rice then anything. I paid 10.55 for this burrito not satisfying AT ALL.",xfqPGK1jySZ89D1OUQFuXQ,0,0,2,aMpt0hEmmV-cd3Gqjhomhw
1238389,2018-02-13,1,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,First time here. Came 30 minutes before closing. Friendly staff. Ordered a create your own burrito and a chicken teriyaki bowl. Can't wait to try more items on the menu.,45eiU5txR6UxmjX8yldlrA,1,1,4,beB_7RPkE6oDu2s9WeNHWQ

1673255,2017-12-20,11,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,"Visited twice and I'm leaning toward ""meh."" The staff are polite and the location is clean. The staff are also awkwardly quiet and the location is completely bare of d√©cor and has limited evening lighting. But it's a restaurant so those things aren't that important.

The food was kind of dicey, too. Originally ordered a Dynamite sushi burrito ($12), belatedly realizing it's deep fried. My mistake but held out hope it would be good or at least interesting, but there's a reason why none of the other places in town do this- it warms to fish to the point of half-cooked, which is totally unappealing. That was a wasted meal.

Returned for a regular sushi burrito. Menu has limited premade combos so you'll probably have to DIY. Prices are higher than similar concepts around town. Fish freshness was okay but I was underwhelmed. I'll stick to the spot across the street.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,13,2,tmPZNC3tu3v6NwulzAdm_w
2092353,2018-05-16,0,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,By far a place that gets the concept of Sushi Burrito.  One of the freshest and ample amount of choices.  Feels like it was set up by a real sushi restaurant.  Found out an actual well established sushi restaurant did open this place.  I felt my money went way further than the place across the street. Overall had a superior experience than the place right across the street.,Sit86IZquugnpOpAg5fJhA,0,0,5,ZyuuH4lLtCLRPTRJruJaUw

You can add pretty much all the mix-ins you want for no additional charge.  Ive seen other sushi burito places pack the burito with too much rice, but not here.  They use just the right amount of rice and you can taste all the other stuff in your burito.  Love this place!",z7KMOFgBSM5s6U2x7QnwZQ,0,0,5,vC6t1Jax21uVt17KDpdVrQ
2518090,2018-01-09,4,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,I'm a sucker for a good poke bowl. Man. That always hits the spot. I give it four stars because the QUALITY of the food could have been a bit better. The rice was a bit stale and the spicy mayo was a bit runny which made my rice soggy (so I guess that's a good thing? lol). BUT that's just something that can happen sometimes. I don't take away the deliciousness I encountered here. I especially like that you can create your own bowl and the prices for the proteins aren't bad. The girl that helped us...didn't catch her name but some brunette girl that seemed new...she was really nice and patient because I'm indecisive and I need my food to be just RIGHT. I would definitely stop by here again and get another bowl. I think next time I will try a sushi burrito!,zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,7,6,4,-wwbI2Y-3F6qSeQosdMuHA
2639591,2018-06-16,0,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,"Tried this place for the first time. Seemed pretty clean, but you never know. Definitely smelled better than poke addiction across the way. I like that they give you miso soup with eating there, but I'm pretty sure the tofu and seaweed are sitting with the soup. I'd rather have them separate until ready to serve, the tofu was super hot. The suggestions are not very creative, but I like that you can add whatever you want. I'll give it a mediocre review for now. When I go back maybe I'll update.",cI6HPks1hNrzI5VKtdpzrA,0,0,3,6E5dwEkDwy8BBDjCZunvRw

I always get the Vegas sushi burrito (deep fried) or their dynamite burrito. Their protein they use for their burritos are fresh and their rice is not sticky. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",671Lj464ax5OWCbFYlQi9w,0,0,5,tetKsknVV99V8H8B0kEsgA
2816915,2018-01-26,0,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,"So this place has to realize that there are some fantastic poke places in town. They have to remain competitive. The service was great, staff was nice and informative. Hence the reason I'm adding another star. It's really about the food. I love poke and sushi burritos, but this was the first time I just couldn't eat it. I can't pin point exactly, was it the sauce? Or lack of fish? I'm not too sure, all I know is I couldn't taste the fish. The staff was really nice so I hope they can figure out their issue with their food because it's gonna undermine the staffs work there. Also, the prices are a bit too high, for the amount of fish and quality.",oegRUjhGbP62M18WyAL6pQ,1,0,2,1bOufnVL6l5OWQaWHO3wmg
3263935,2018-03-19,0,tNq5iUjDNkDmbp7WV2pUkA,"First time here. Fast and friendly service. Had a BYO Bowl, with 2 portions of protein (3 oz each, so 6 oz).  Tuna, white rice, spicy chili sauce, corn, scallions, mango, edamame, carrots, sweet onions, avocado, and all the spice toppings. The bowl was very deep, so to me, very reasonably priced at 10.75. Dine in and you receive a free Miso soup. Prior customer got a sushi burrito, and it looked really good. Store, dining, and condiment area very clean, as was prep area. Friendly staff.

Surprisingly the burrito was good even though deep fried. If any complaint, maybe too much cream cheese but overall good. The Ocean Pole bowl was outstanding. Generous amounts of salmon and tuna.

Not a 1 star because I didn't get sick and that they do give you miso soup unlike most  places. I made a custom bowl of tuna salmon.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,6,1,2,W9i0JJ8YRZapw7iV5F_pdw

The staff is usually the same young man and woman, and sometimes a third guy who cooks. They're very polite and give a good portion of food. The sushi burritos come with a free cup of miso soup. As someone who can't eat gluten, I took a lot of time my first visit to see what I can and can't have. The spicy mayo is good, and I would stay away from the other sauces if you're also avoiding gluten. The miso is good also.

Where the place gets clipped is on the vibe and ""messiness"".  The place has no personality and actually made me feel pretty depressed (bare walls, basic white tables clumped together - no feeling of love or passion for the food (let alone fun).  Also, things seemed somewhat disorganized and a little messy (but clean).  When dealing with raw fish, you want clean AND organized.  My wife was scared to order and opted for a plain bowl of rice.  A little TLC can really help this place move ahead.",y8sguRYgpYbkdGHJwyHYPg,0,0,2,33iIZgAjH5FNNsOtbJehBg

While the food and staff were enjoyable, there is nothing that stands out about this place and demands multiple trips. I could not see myself craving the food here. I had a custom bowl on sushi rice. I got 4 proteins and everything tastes great. The owner even went out of his way to bring out extra sauces for me that weren't even on the menu.

There was very little flavor. The fish was a little fishy. And it my whole 30 min lunch to get the burrito and there was only one person ahead of me.

Give this place some time to get the ball rolling - it's def gonna be a great spot down the line!
