Calamari was greas instead of crispy, served on a bed of tomato sauce rather than dipping sauce. 

Prime rib sliders tasted like the meat had spent the last week in the refrigerator before being served. 

Last was the tenderloin skewers , my wife ate them as I had lost my appetite...she said the best part was the sauteed spinach they were served on. Ya, they shoved a wooden skewer into 3 chunks of random shaped  over cooked salty meat.

Waitress was very nice and was sure to remind me how cheap the bill was, I guess so I would't stiff on the tip.

My beer was nice & cold ...I should have stopped there.",_VO_XW9fSnpqLFd0zbU03w,0,0,2,t_THKBXiQAwlD413e5YyaA

One night the steaks are perfect and are flavorful, the next time they couldn't be cooked worse and they look like really bad cuts of meat to begin with. Another time one of our steaks were good and they burned my wife's beyond recognition. When she got her new one we weren't sure if they had actually put it on the grill it was so raw.
 It doesn't seem to matter what night it is or what server we have. It's totally random.  

They also changed their menu and upped their prices a year or two ago so that was the last straw. 
Go there is you wish, you may get a great meal, but you also may get a lousy one. We're done guessing which it will be.",AdxhlxXSGjRsCQxG6ZjfTw,0,0,3,cCrjlbqTA7dCDaIco9204Q

We also have been a couple of times just for the tapas and some wine and love having that option.  The tapas we've tried have been very good, our favorite is the bacon wrapped shrimp.  YUM!  

So, I'm writing this review now primarily because I want people to know how much I appreciate the knowledgeable and patient expertise of Rob, the bartender (Rob #1, hehe).  I like to try different red wines and he was wonderful to bring me tastes of several he thought I'd enjoy, which I did!  It's always fun to get to try new wines without committing to an entire glass or bottle of wine.   Rob is very busy in the bar, so be prepared to wait a little for the individual service because it's well worth it.  

All of the restaurant servers we've had here have been excellent and knowledgeable, as well.  

Thank you Ted, Manager of Mi Casa, who was filling in at Twin Creeks last night, for hearing me out and agreeing to pass on that a wine flight would be a nice addtion to the Twin Creeks menu.",IQqyJZOFdRM1ZvPuHfNyDg,1,0,5,_Ip0dWnwaDxMWGkDxp-AFg

Bad experience here last Saturday night.  We arrived just after 8:00 and were told we were 8th in line for the lounge and seating in maybe 45-60 min.  No problem.  We came back after 50 minutes and were told we were 10th in line.  WHAT?  Apparently, the Asian (I say this so you will recognize her when you arrive) hostess either A) could not read the schedule on the computer or B) outright lied.  Had we known that we would be at a 2 hour wait, we would have gladly left for and returned another time.  We left anyway but enough about that...

Never to let one individual get us down, we returned last night (Thursday).  No problem getting seated.  On the food, I have to say nothing in the kitchen has slipped in the kitchen over the past year.  Excellent presentation, preparation and flavors.

We liked:
a) Calamari (small plateful):  Large chunks fully cooked but somehow still very tender.  Great breading and aioli for dipping.  We always get this and its a consistent menu item.
b) Bacon wrapped shrimp (4):  large shrimp, flavorful bacon.  Slightly more sauce than I like but no biggie.  Again, consistent menu item.
c) Prime rib sliders (3):  These were good but if you aren't super hungry, maybe save room for something else.  On special.
d) Lamb chops (2):  Perfect preparation and great flavor.  We'd do this again in a heartbeat.   On special.
e) Sea Bass (1):  Wow, stole the show.  Veggies and sauce (lemon-butter rosemary concoction) were perfect with the fish.  Fish perfectly cooked.

I should give 4 stars but what happened that Saturday night was totally unacceptable.  Just do a better job coaching/training the hostess.",7nvtBJv3ZLiop7vzuEw3mw,0,0,3,fBV7nNVGzv3iDPsHIA9jsg

This trip, we were looking for a steakhouse for a nice dinner, but wow, really didn't want to pay $50 for an a la carte steak at one of the higher priced restaurants, so we used Yelp to find the best deal.  Well, we definitely FOUND A GEM!!!  

Twin Creeks is awesome!  

Inside, when you first walk in, it looks and feels SO EXPENSIVE!!!  

We were greeted immediately by a host and felt so welcomed!  Later we found out the gentleman who seated us was the manager!  He was so amazingly attentive, told us about all the great menu items.  

The decor is beautiful!  Very rustic and so unique! There are tables at a variety of levels throughout the entire bar & dining room.  That sounds odd, but it is so nice when you are dining in it.  We didn't get to sit at one of the sofa tables, but those looked so comfy!!!   

The meal all come with bread, salad/soup and entree with side (choice of baked potato, veggies, fries, etc).  My prime rib (8 oz cut) was $20.  Perfectly cooked to my medium request and the seasoning was delicious!  

The only sad thing was that we were there right after Restaurant Week and the two desserts (lava cake and chocolate mousse) were not available.  Well, at least someone didn't just take the one and I missed out, they had been gone for a while!  There was still some chocolate in the house, so we shared a Black Forest cake, and never felt like we were 'settling' it was delicious and a perfect end to a really great dinner.  Oh and I cannot forget to mention the coffee.  It didn't just come in a refillable coffee cup, it was brought to me, fresh pressed in front of me, in a French Coffee Press!!!  

Dinner for 5, $230 includes a bottle of wine as well.

I have, however, given a low rating in hopes of catching the eye of my fellow tourists.  PLEASE BE AWARE that for whatever reason this area is apparently poorly served by taxis!!  We left our strip hotel as a party of five to go to Twin Creeks for a birthday dinner---as above stated, it was GREAT!  The hard part was getting back----no taxis in sight, and the ' Valets' were no help whatsoever----rude, caustic, and borderline adversarial....they finally claimed to have called us a cab, but told us they 'didn't know if it would come or not'.  After waiting about 45 minutes, one of our party finally ventured to the hotel desk and had an attendant there call a cab for us.  This cab arrived within about 15 minutes, which makes me wonder whether the 'Valet' guys had actually called a cab or not!  We did not allow the valets to ruin our evening, but they certainly gave it their best shot!!

Yes, I would highly recommend Twin Creeks for a wonderful steak dinner, but please be aware of the transportation situation and plan accordingly------go prepared with a couple of cab company numbers so YOU can call them YOURSELF or otherwise make other arrangements!",bV7VBEJ1gEBGIYxa1Ocdsg,0,0,1,3i5DZeAxguCv8NaoRjzlbw

449142,2011-11-23,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Wow here's a little hidden gem off the Strip. If you have haven't experienced Twin Creeks, you should! It's a perfect place to take a date with it's relaxing, modern atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because our server was horrible but the rest of the experience was memorable.

We arrived for dinner during their happy hour so we were able to order from the tapas menu, which we used as appetizers. Unfortunately they were out of their roasted artichoke so we settled for the cheese stuffed mushrooms. These baby portabellas were quite enjoyable. I would describe in depth but all it took me was one bite! 

We then proceeded to order from the dinner menu and hey a nice steak dinner for 2 people under $70 is good in my book. 

First up, the bread. Wow, it probably was the best bread basket I've had in a while or maybe I was just really hungry! The pretzel rolls had a nice fluff to them and were warm. Now the best deal are the classic dinners. My partner ordered the chicken Milanese and it was actually really good. The chicken was moist and the breading was fried perfectly that it provided a nice crispy crust. The meal also came with 2 sides and a salad for around . The salad was a spring mix with homemade balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was actually really enjoyable. The consistency was perfect, not too thick and not too thin. The two sides were mash potatoes and broccolini. Luckily the taters didn't taste as processed as some of the other joints but you can tell it was fresh homemade mash taters. Overall this meal was enjoyed.

So it's really hard to go to a steakhouse and not order a steak, of course I had to try their steak. I ordered the 8 oz filet Mignon with mac & cheese and asparagus. The filet Mignon was so tender, it just melted in your mouth. The only downside to my steak was that it was a bit dry. However, it didn't stop me from devouring that luscious piece of meat!. My only suggestion to the staff would be to possibly add a beef broth/gravy ramekin on the side in case the steak is dry. But I am a true believer that the best steak is one with no sauces/gravys or over seasoned, just salt & pepper. Now again it's hard to screw up asparagus but all you have to do is steam them and add salt. The mac & cheese, eh I've had better.

Again, it's a great place for a romantic dinner where you don't have to spend a lot of money for a steak. Afterwards, enjoy a cocktail at the Mermaid bar by the tank or the flare bar. The employees are great and actually run the food out quickly (trust me, they sprint that food out to you). Yes our server Rob (oops did I just say that out loud?) was not the best and took him forever to come to our table and would forget to bring stuff. C'mon dude get it together, it wasn't that busy.

I would definitely go back for dinner, hopefully we get someone different next time!",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,3,0,4,GjDpAeJfL-oVXZwVTHZerA
484001,2014-02-27,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Nice, upscale feeling without having to ""dress up"".  We thoroughly enjoyed gazing at the fish tank and the Bass Pro Shop waterfall before heading in to our reservation.

Bread basket = YUM! Three of us devoured two baskets of the various bread - the flat bread was my favorite, hubby liked the raisin and son enjoyed the asiago.

The Caesar salad was a bit disappointing. It looked pretty, but was lacking in flavor.
Onion soup was great, cheesy, not too salty, great depth of flavor.
NY Strip - done perfectly to order, and my notoriously picky steak-eater ate the entire thing!
Half a roasted boneless chicken was fine, nothing special.
Scallops over mushroom risotto was good, some grittiness detracted from the enjoyment.

We disliked that sides had to be ordered separately (and were an additional cost). The ""garlic mashed potatoes"" were just mashed potatoes with some garlic spread on top - a bit deceiving. Asparagus was tasty, but nothing to write home about.

Wine selection is large, and the red my husband got was very good. My vodka martini on the rock with a twist was strong and cold - perfect.

All in all, a nice ""fancy"" dinner for when you're not prepared to dress up, but it was a bit expensive  (even by Las Vegas standards) for what we got, in my opinion.

The stuffed mushroom appetizer I had and the French onion soup my wife ordered were both some of the best we have tasted.  For dinner, we ordered the petite fillet and the bone-in ribeye. Our waitress recommended the Au Poivre for my ribeye since I professed a liking for pepper and had ordered the Brandy Peppercorn sauce. Now I do like pepper but the Au Poivre was a bit over the top even for me. Despite that, both of the steaks were perfectly cooked and we enjoyed them immensely. 
   Be sure to share the sides as each one is more than enough for two. I can not recommend the ""loaded"" broccoli unless you just really like broccoli, as it was basically just a large plain spear with some sauce and bacon.
   Was very pleased that our waitress gave us the ""hairy eyeball"" when we considered ordering the cheesecake to take home for later. She instead recommended a chocolate cake that was absolutely great. Two thumbs up for the honesty in recommendations. She also got me to try a blended wine called ""Trouble"" that was fantastic. It was my first time trying a blend but it will certainly be on my next liquor store shopping list.
   Overall, a great evening and great food. Would have given it 5-Stars except for the Au Poivre being a little too much, the broccoli and the fact that no one ever asked or acknowledged why we were there.

We were drawn in for the Sunday night prime rib and were looking forward to a pleasant and satisfying experience. The meal was adequate, yet nothing to rave about. The prime rib portion was generous. The taste was adequate, but mind not blown. We came early for a cocktail at the bar and were sadly disappointed by the poor quality of alcohol in their specialty drinks. We missed Happy Hour by a few minutes and the drinks looked and tasted watered down, poorly constructed and not made with the premium liquors as stated in the menu. Paid $11 each for a drink for that compared to a complimentary casino floor cocktail.

I really wanted to love this place. Our waiter also maintained a level a banality, which seemed to permeate into an uneventful evening.

My steak was the tomahawk and it was delicious but the prime rib lovers were just devistated that there sat a whole plate of meat completely unappealing due to the gross brown gravy. We waited for dinner for well over an hour which would have been forgivable had they not screwed up the gravy which covered every scrap of meat. I would be back but steer clear of the wierd prime rib and have sevral hours to kill and bring your own packet of Ajus......,4KqX24qLh4R0GuiFAbVEZQ,0,0,1,CEAI5lXeDXx1h9SN6exwew

As in the past, the pretzel bread rocked.  Fresh, nice salt crust, good start !

we shared crab cakes ($16) - two very large cakes - decent ratio of crab to filling.

birthday girl ordered the rib eye ( $38 ?? ) with a gorgonzola crust and subbed the spinach salad instead of the house salad ( add $4 ) 

two of us ordered the daily special - 14 ounce new York strip with lobster mashed potatoes with one having the Caesar, the other, lobster bisque ( $42 plus $4 substitute on salad ) 

Final order - queen cut prime rib with the chopped salad substitute for the house salad ( $21 ??? ) 

we also added the lobster mac n cheese ( $14 ) , mushrooms ( $7 ??) and mushroom risotto ( $7)

desserts ( all $9 ) 

crème brulee, strawberry shortcake and chocolate lava cake

the highlights:

All the steaks were perfectly cooked, properly seasoned and flavorful.  the prime rib was a little on the grissly side but great crusted seasoning

All the salads/soup were very good except the chopped salad ( needed to dry the lettuce better.)  The spinach salad was especially good.

The sides - the mushrooms were amazing - perfect seasoning, cooked just right.  The mac n cheese tasted great though its due to the cheese and the noodles and not the lobster.

The lows:


The risotto - terrible ! had a strong tomato sauce taste ...why ?!?!?

The desserts were very average - the brulee was runny, the shortcake wasn't a ""shortcake"" and the lava cake ... BORING !

Service was excellent.  For a vegas steakhouse, prices are reasonable.

Hopefully, I'll return sooner than 3 years

I came here with a party of 15 to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I have a friend who works for the Silverton in F&B and he made the reservation for us.  

First off, this restaurant is beautiful.  Every bit as beautiful as some of the top notch places on the strip.  I was so surprised when we walked in as I never would have expected something so nice looking to be in the Silverton.  They seated us in this semi-private dining room off to the side of the main dining room which was awesome, but I was a little worried that we would get forgotten in there.  The chef sent out some complimentary appetizers.  Full disclosure, I am thinking this was my friend's pull, but they didn't have to do it and it was very nice.  

Any worry I had about being forgotten quickly dissipated.  We had one server and she was excellent!  I was in shock at how well she handled all of our requests and how perfectly timed the meal was. 

This is what I tried: 

Calamari - Perfectly cooked and not at all rubbery. 
Beef Skewer - This was so good.  It came on a bed of what I believe were roasted veggies.  I feel like I could order this as my entrée next time. So good. 
Scallops - This were also perfectly cooked.  Again, I rarely order this dish because I feel like it is often rubbery.  These had a wonderful texture and even better flavor.  
Creamed Corn - I am a little sad to admit that I think this recipe may be better than my own creamed corn recipe!  It was so good, definitely don't miss this.  
Baked Potato & Mashed Potato - Both of these were very good, but the creamed corn was the star of the sides.  

The last thing I want to comment on is the pricing here.  This generally isn't too much of a concern for us but I felt that I have paid much more for dinners of lesser quality in Strip Casinos.  This meal is a steal based on the price paid, the beautiful ambiance, the quality of the service and tastiness of the food!  

Highly recommend.  Definitely check it out! i",jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw,1,2,5,r3hCca0Q8B4e-thWh85IWQ

Nightly specials vary and cost a bit more. but the most expensive one (which is usually a fish) is about $8 after the discount. The filet sliders with horseradish sauce melt in your mouth and are cooked a perfect medium.

As if that wasn't enough, the mixed drinks are all top notch. Best consistency I've tasted. Flavors I never liked before taste delicious after a TC bartender touches the glass.

I went here with my boyfriend for a nice dinner and experienced an awesome meal that would have cost us $400 on the Strip. Seriously. 

The restaurant is comfortable inside and we happened to score a plush booth. Service was attentive and friendly.

We started with the Shrimp cocktail, which consisted of 6 jumbo shrimp and spicy cocktail sauce. It was practically a meal on its own and very enjoyable. 

Next came lobster bisque  for the BF (nothing special) and a chopped salad for me (delicious). If you are a fan of balsamic vin, bacon, and blue cheese, you have to try the chopped salad. It was also the perfect size and not too filling despite its rich ingredients.

For the main show, we each got a 28oz porterhouse. Please, judge me all you want. I couldn't decide if I wanted the NY strip or filet so I went with both. I ordered my steak medium rare and my companion medium well. Both pieces of meat came out cooked just fine and were absolutely gigantic. We also got truffled potatoes (so, so good) and broccolini (ehhh, little too buttery). Needless to say, a large doggy bag was taken home. Dessert was skipped because there were no chocolaty offerings for that night.

First off, the ambiance and decor of the restaurant was very appealing to me. Very romantic yet classy setting. 

We ordered bacon wrapped shrimp, crispy rocky shrimp and Caesar salad for appetizers. All dishes were superb, but the bacon wrapped shrimp stole the show! Very delicious and flavorful. 

For entrees we had the Filet and herb chicken, with mashed sweet potatoes, potatoes augratin and garlic spinach sauté (which was never served).  The filet was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly. It was so tender, it could be sliced with my butter knife. The chicken was great! Huge serving. It was tender and had good flavor. Oh, and the bread???? Wow!!! Great serving of WARM variety of bread and butter :-)

The service was great! Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Just a very minor hiccup....not sure if the server forgot my spinach or they just forgot to bring it out. That's the only reason I didn't give the business five stars. In my opinion, it could have taken my experience to another level if the mishap was handled differently by the manager.

Never did i know that the Silverton contained such a gem. Their happy hour deal is a dream come true. Going to go into my style of describing everything i remember

Drinks
Manhattan
- Completely agree with Ken M that this drink is potent. Boozy yet has a very nice flavorful sweetness from the marmalade and honey mix.

Dragon's Eye
- Wasnt too impressed with this one. They pureed lychees as a main ingredient but it lacked a lychee taste which was what i was expecting. To me this kind of tasted a bit like orange sherbert.

Tiramisu Martini 
- Wow! Tastes like a boozy version of the classic cake! Epic Winz!

Tapas
Meatballs
- The sauce is rather pleasant but the meatballs themselves were nothing to write home about. I'd skip out on this one next time

Calamari
- Some good stuff! the sauce is balanced perfectly and the squid bits were big and meaty with light flavorful breading

Stuffed Peppers
- Quite nice, the same cheese is used in the stuffed mushrooms. The balance from the sweetness of the roasted peppers and the savoriness of the cheese pair very well. 

Stuffed Mushrooms
- White button mushrooms stuffed with cheese then topped with another cheese. Epic Win.

Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates
- Holy...Dude....These things...Wooo...Order two of them cause they're divine. Bacony, chewy, with a sweet finish. The blue cheese is good too

Spicy Red Potatos
- Reminds me of cajun tuna or albacore cept with potatoes instead of lightly seared fish 

Bacon Wrapped Shrimp
- Shrimp? No this place dont use shrimp...The use Prawns. Big ol prawns wrapped in bacon. Cant go wrong with that.

Appetizers off main menu
Crab Cakes
- Divine absolutely divine. The butter sauce is quite nice and the cakes themselves are flaky with crab meat.

Shrimp Cocktail
- WHOA!! The prawns are back!! Again giant meaty prawns with house made cocktail sauce. The prawns lay on a bed of jellied cocktail sauce and thin slices of candied lemon. Superb

Think i found a new hangout spot.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,12,6,5,H1Z6SQXP5nYMDP7DS9v9fQ
1970697,2010-10-18,1,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Had a gambling session one night and got hungry. Looked at their menu and read ""Bourbon BBQ Bone-in Rib Eye""?!.. My preference cut of meat, barbecued?.. Hmm, interesting I thought.. I need to try it!

I Had a drink from the bar to start off the night. I was feeling experimental so I just had the mixologist make me something ""good"" based on bourbon (since they have such an extensive selection). I don't remember the name of the drink but boy was it strong and flavorful. 

The place is well decorated, hip and casual. Server was informative and easy going.  I did order the bbq steak with a side of mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. Shortly, the server brings over the steak and seemed concerned that the steak wasn't cooked to my liking as the chef wanted to make sure. It was fine and I thought what a nice gesture.. At first glance, the bbq steak had some glossy glaze over it, out of the ordinary. I do like good bbq and good steak as well and this was the hybrid of both. It had a mild aroma of bbq, texture that was soft but held up and a flavor that was uniquely scrumptious. It took me about half the steak to really absorb its full flavor. The mashed potato was silky smooth. Asparagus was nothing special but having some greens never hurt!  

Came back here several times after and must say I'm definitely a fan of this place: staff had great consistent attitude, price is fair and everything I've tried here so far has failed to disappoint.

Suggestions: (other than the bbq ribeye and mashed potatoes)

2014439,2010-10-20,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Review is just for the bar:

When you take a seat at the bar in Twin Creeks, it's easy enough to accept the illusion that you're in a nice lounge attached to a steakhouse.  But you're not.  The bartender walking in front of the line of bourbon bottles isn't just there to serve you.  He's there to educate.  And those bottles?  They're your school books.  And that bar?  It's actually a schoolhouse and one you will desperately want to visit.  

The night we went there, the bartender was a certified mixologist and he started off by making the most amazing cucumber mojito.  I'm not into mixed drinks and I wouldn't normally consider cucumber and liquor to be the best mixture, but the drink was fantastically crisp, cool and had the perfect touch of sour.

But the real reason that I will come back here again and again is the bourbon.  Our mixologist started by asking what kinds of bourbon I liked.  We talked about the craft that certain distilleries use and why one has a sharper, sweeter or smokier flavor than another.  And when he had a good sense of what I liked and what I didn't, he put together a custom flute (selection of four bourbon shots) to match my preferences and  to expand my taste horizon.  I loved one of his choices so much that I stopped at Lee's Liquor Store on the way home to buy a bottle.

For those that believe customer service is dead in Las Vegas, the mixologist at Twin Creeks will blow your mind.  He is, simply put, amazing.  

My only criticisms of the place is location.  Twin Creeks is wayyy off the map of regular Vegas.  But the experience was so over-the-top quality that I now drive people off the strip and down to Silverton Casino just for this bar.  They may not have the massive, eyes-bulging out of your head selection of the Whiskey Attic, but the shelf is stocked pretty deep with bourbon and the customer service is 5 star.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,4,4,5,cIJnaLcdcNo54eT96KPoRA

They have remodeled this place since I was last here. It was warm and inviting with nice, soft lighting. The vibe was relaxing and not too loud. They had a jazzy cover duo singing Lionel Ritchie/ Billy Joel cover songs. We started with a light green salad which was super fresh with wild greens, baby heirloom tomatoes and small Parmesan shavings. It was a delight of a salad. In efforts to stick close to my diet , I chose to avoid carbs and asked the waitress to not bring the bread basket! I have my weaknesses though and I had to decide between bread or a dessert, which would you go for? ;)
My hubby and I ordered the 8 oz. Fillet Mignon , mine was well done and full of flavor. No A-1 sauces needed here folks!
Yummy it was ...as I finished every bite. 
I ordered the broccolini and asparagus to get my greens in. Our server was a gem , she was very friendly and checked on us often which goes far with me! As our plates had grown empty we decided to savor a sweet order of Creme brûlée with fresh berries . It was a generous size even for two! Yum!

2041661,2011-11-03,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"What can I say about the Twin Creeks at the Silverton?

Absolute perfection.  

Having never been before, we arrived at the restaurant eager for the feast after reading an article in the Las Vegas Sun.  

After being seated and immediately filled up  with water and tea, we ordered the Pumpkin Spice Martinis and a couple beers.  The martini was not only awesome to look at but absolutely delicious and just sweet enough to indulge in while still tasting the burn of the alcohol.  We enjoyed several of these throughout the evening.

The service from the start was exceptional, our waters were refilled the second they were half empty.  The waiter had no problem making recommendations for beer pairings with our food.  They were constantly checking on us to not only make sure we were enjoying the food, but enjoying the atmosphere (which we most certainly did).

Upon the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the Tomahawk Steak and the lobster mashed potatoes.  I usually prefer my steak medium-rare, but I asked the waiter the best preparation and he said rare + was his personal favorite.  Rare + it was and he was right.  The steak was seasoned so well and cooked so wonderfully I couldn't believe it.  I honestly can say I have never had better steak before in my life.  The lobster mashed potatoes were also excellent as they were so rich and buttery and full of flavor and really complimented the steak perfectly.  

While we waited for our food to cook we enjoyed a couple of the tapas plates the waiter recommended and probably could have filled up on just tapas alone since we enjoyed them so much.

While we were enjoying our meal, the Executive Chef, Daniel, approached our table just to see how we like our meal.  He is this humongous man with a warm accent and seemed like he really cared that his patrons were fully enjoying their dining experience.  We, being no one special, really appreciated that the executive chef of the casino would take the time to see how we were doing.

We enjoyed one more martini for dessert and were extremely satisfied with our meal.  

Every time we are in Vegas, we will make sure to come back to the Twin Creeks for an experience like this one.

Many thank you's to Chef Daniel and his crew!",Wh8ISqk7ZQaRHi7QMtwE5A,0,1,5,hedr8Bb7jcP43uRmwu1bQg

But oh well, nothing stays secret forever.  This restaurant is exceptional in every way:  the ambiance, the food, the service, and the price.  For $28 you can get a delicious bourbon ribeye, two sides (baked potato, asparagus, broccoli, mac & cheese are some of the choices), salad, and bread service.  You read that correctly:  $28.  Anywhere else it's probably $35-$40 just for the steak, another $8 for each side, and $6 for the salad.  And the food is fantastic, I've been to about a dozen steakhouses in town and I would put Twin Creeks' steaks up against probably anyone's except the Golden Steer and the Luxor's steakhouse (that includes places like Prime at the Bellagio, Blackstone at the Monte Carlo (or whatever it's called now), Kokomo's at the Mirage, Morton's on Flamingo, and  Austin's at Texas Station).  I always get double mac & cheese ar my sides and it's delicious, it tastes like bacon and has breadcrumbs baked on top.  My wife gets the asparagus and says it's the best she's ever had.  Other dishes that our friends have tried include the prime rib, which got rave reviews, and the filet mignon, which was also liked.  Service is quick and friendly and the ambiance is perfect for a steakhouse:  comfortable tables and booths, dim lighting, and a wall that has flowing water on rocks with a color-changing background.

After checking out the reviews on Yelp I decided that Twin Creeks would be an excellent place to take my family to celebrate my Father's Birthday...  I was completely wrong and my mistake ruined what should have been a happy celebration.  First, my mother spoke with the hostess to seat a party of 7.  She was very short and seemed aggravated to that we were bothering her.  She explained that we should have made reservations for such a large group, but would try and seat us.  She told my mom it would be approximately a 30 minute wait.  As we stood patiently waiting, I watched 5 parties get seated prior to us with no problem.  When the General Manager came to the hostess table, I asked him about how much longer we would need to wait.  He looked at the seating chart and said he didn't see a reservation.  I explained that we were told that the wait would be approximately 30 minutes and we had already waited that long.  The hostess came up and the General Manager asked where my parties name was listed.  Apparently, the hostess didn't even bother to write our name down.  The General Manager didn't apologize, but instead told me that we would need to wait at least another hour to be seated.  No explanations, no apologies-  just that we were a large party and needed to wait.  The hostess didn't apologize either, but instead stayed true to form and remained rude and denied that she even said the wait would be 30 minutes!  I was hoping that a restaurant of this caliber with a General Manager could do something to help diffuse the situation...  He was completely useless and acted as if he didn't care that he was losing potential customers.  I would NEVER come back to Twin Creeks and will tell anyone who asks how horrible the service was.

2237216,2010-09-25,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a ""fine"" dining establishment.  The food was OK, but in contrast to the awful service my fiance and I felt as if the 5 minute trip down the road to the Silverton would not be worth it.  

The hostess was prompt with getting our table, considering that we arrived at 7:40ish on a Friday night without reservations.  Right after we were sat, the server's assistant came up and offered us bottled or tap water.  About 5 minutes later we were finally greeted by our server who insisted on constantly referring to both my fiance and I as ""hun"" (something you would expect at Denny's and not at a steak house).  

Regardless, we got our orders in - a medium rare filet ($26) and lobster bisque for the fiance and the cold water lobster tail (comes with your choice of 2 sides and a house salad for only $30!).  Since we were instructed that the sides from the lobster would be substantial, we did not order any more sides (I would have liked to try the truffle potatoes - sad panda).  

Soon after ordering, our bread basket filled with cheese and cracked black pepper crackers, a mini pretzel loaf, popovers, and a hazelnut chocolate bread was placed on our table.  The hazelnut chocolate was my favorite (similar to the chocolate bread at Vintner's Grill).  

Next our salad and soup came out. The salad was slightly over dressed and the soup was a bit too salty for me, however the flavor was good.  We leisurely ate our salad and soup and after all the bread was eaten and our plates were cleared we waited for our entrees.  And waited... and waited... and FINALLY after about 15-20 minutes, our entrees came out.  

When the fiance cut into his filet it was NOT medium rare, nor was it medium... it was damn well near well-done (not the good well done, the bad well-done).  After 5 minutes of waiting for someone to come by, we flagged down a food runner and told him our situation.  He informed us that usually the edges are more cooked than the middle... so we cut right down the middle to find a very, very slightly pink inside (indicative of well done).  He finally took away the plate.  

We waited for another 15 minutes... still NO sign of our server.  However, when she did show up she almost passed us by then gave us a puzzled look and said, ""what's up?""  To which I asked if she had heard from the runner that our steak was returned.  At first she sounded like she had no idea, then as if something dawned on her she said, ""Let me check on that.""  She came back to tell us it would be four more minutes.  Time ticked away and our sides and my lobster got about as cold as the ""cold-water"" it came from.  10 more minutes passed.  

Finally, the runner brought out the filet.  The fiance was fuming by that time and he could barely eat.  Up to this point we had not heard a single ""sorry.""  We were basically treated as if WE were the horrible ones for not being able to accept a WELL-DONE piece of filet mignon.  For one thing, why would anyone get a filet mignon well done???  AND why would you ever greet a table with ""what's up?"" Wow. The only service we got from our waitress was when she came back once to refill our regular Pepsi with DIET Pepsi.  

Our entire bill came out to about $70.  We still left a 20% tip, but did speak to the manager after.  He was apologetic and an overall nice guy.  

For the cheap price and the convenience this is a good find... although I would not subject myself to such sloppy and unapologetic service unless I was a masochistic insane person.  IF I do come back... I will avoid the server I had like the plague!

Hubby ordered a 16 oz prime NY steak while I chose the 8 oz filet mignon off of the classic menu.  Tip: that classic menu has got to be one of the best-kept secrets in Vegas.  Bread basket, salad, entree, and 2 sides for $30 or less?  Wow.  Every bite was delish.  My steak had a buttery mouthfeel, my mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy, and my steamed broccolini was just right.  We split a piece of chocolate oreo cake to end the evening and left feeling completely stuffed.

Our server gave us a 'buy one, get one free entree' coupon, which only confirmed our enthusiasm for this place.  Next visit is to check out their happy hour....",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,1,0,5,gLCfpPRBe8Ytatfeewg_Xg

My waiter had suggested a specialty cocktail that wasn't on the menu called a Casino Royale, it was a blueberry vodka and champagne with a twist of lemon. It was a good blend of bubbles and berries I'd definitely order it again. As an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped shrimp it comes out with bbq sauce. They are great! Also, we ordered oysters on the half shell, those on the other hand were a different story. I prefer the smaller oysters and these were big and thick with a dirty texture. Tried one and sent them back. I ordered a ribeye and it was cooked to a medium rare perfection with the Gorgonzola crust on top and it was perfect. And as a side I had the potatoes au gratin which are great! Service was good and our waiter was very attentive. Love the atmosphere of the resteraunt.

2302023,2011-08-14,1,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"We were in the Las Vegas area visiting and decided to check out Twin Creeks given the positive reviews we read on Yelp. Overall a disappointing experience. This place earns a 2 1/2 stars in my book, but I am giving them 2 stars based on the rating scale. 

We had reservations at 8P since that was the earliest they could accommodate our party of 6 on a Saturday night. (we made reservations 2 days out) We arrived at 7:45P and were advised to return at 8P as our table was not available yet. Not a problem, interesting that they did not invite us to wait in the bar area. However, the bar seemed crowded with diners as well. We returned at 8P and were seated within 5 minutes. Although we placed our orders within 10 minutes of being seated, our dinners were not served until 9:15 P. 

First the positive stuff......dinners are served with a house salad and two sides. The BBQ Bourbon Rib Eye steak was excellent. Cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. Prime Rib was served medium rare as requested. Mashed potatoes were made from real potatoes and not the instant stuff. 

Now for the negative.....Our waiter spent the better part of the evening attending to another table across way so it was near impossible to get his attention. Luckily, the assistant waiter was attentive and kept our water glasses filled and handle any requests that we had. I ordered the lobster since it was recommended in several reviews. Unfortunately, I thought it was on the tough side. (maybe it was overcooked?!?) In addition, it was barely lukewarm when served. Since it had taken so long for our dinner to arrive, I was afraid if I sent it back, I may never get anything to eat. In my past experience, the waiter usually removes the lobster tail from the shell ~ not in this case. Once our dinner was served, I don't recall seeing our waiter until dessert time. I tasted a piece of my friend's prime rib. Although it was served medium rare as requested, the meat was barely lukewarm at best and not that tender. The meat had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper. 

Prices are reasonable, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. The general consensus of our group is that we would not recommend this place nor would we be returning for a second visit.",_5jHtjmDb6Ktdd19xm9hNQ,1,1,2,xmSP3uGu1b8-klskz19Wkw

Service, poor. Hence the missing star.

I would honestly say that I've had better customer service from the counter personnel at any given fast food establishment than I did the evening I dined at Twin Creeks Steakhouse inside of the Silverton Hotel/Casino. Sad right?

Mind you I have had (6) years of hands on personal experience in the restaurant industry (in every position possible) so my empathy for the grueling job is definitely present every time I dine. This gent's attitude lacked MAJORLY in every department; I feel he was one notch away from throwing food and stomping off every time he was conditioned to pay a visit to our table, but I digress..

Let's talk about what I loved.. The ambiance was stellar! Sexy booths, warm decor, and great lighting. It almost invoked the feeling of being in a cozy cabin, brick walls, great textures, fantastic dark wood flooring..The venue itself was well thought out and inviting.  If it wasn't for the rushed feeling from our server, I could definitely see myself (given the right company) sitting there for a couple of hours enjoying each course, sampling wine and indulging in their happy hour/tapas menu.

The chicken dish was DELICIOUS! Tender and juicy and seasoned to perfection. Broccoli was cooked to perfection and my only gripe about the mashed potatoes were the fact that if I didn't know they were fresh I would have assumed they were produced from a box.

All in all, I would say give this joint a whirl, perhaps our poor service was the result of someones bad DAY and hopefully not a repeat occurrence. I would certainly give Twin Creeks a second chance; if all else fails and service is poor a second time, no delicious food will have me returning ever again.",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,1,1,4,5aZz-juLJ6J9RYaMGKFNAg

They took our phone number down so they can call us when seats were available .  Great!  With this restaurant being located in a Casino, we were doomed to give into gambling while waiting lol.

We shared the tomahawk ribeye classic dinner with Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.  Steak was very good.  I was pretty impressed, after recently having an awesome wagyu version tomahawk ribeye at Del Frisco's.  Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes were, ehhh, just okay.

Off the happy hour menu, we ordered CALAMARI, stuffed mushrooms, a glass of red Sangria and a glass of Perfect passion.  Everything was good.  I loved the basket of bread.  My sangria was on point.  Alas, a star docked off because we never got our Calamari.  I had to remind the bartender at the end of our meal.  He was very apologetic and gave me a free glass of white sangria.  Although I was pleased by the gesture, the white sangria sucked and I really wished I tasted the calamari.

Besides them forgetting our calamari, service was good.  The bartender was really nice and friendly.  The hostesses were all friendly as well.  Ambience was kind of cute and not too crazy for a mommy and daddy on a night out without the kids.

He was friendly and my BFF and I decided to try a few appetizers and some cocktails.  We started off with Meatballs for her and stuffed piquillo peppers for me. She really liked the meatballs and  I'm a vegetarian so I took her word for it. The Peppers we both tried and they were very good, although you only get 4 but that's the point of tapas.  Next we ordered Artichoke toasts which they were out (bummer) So we had red potatoes with spicy aioli each.  They were both our favorite tapas on the menu. The creamy drizzle of chipolte style spice combined with perfectly cooked tiny potatoes was awesome. The cocktails we tried  to start were the Acai Mojito and dreamscicle. The dreamscicle  is tastes like an alcoholic melted orange creamscicle. I mean that in a good way. It looks like it would be heavy due to the cream but it was still refreshing and fairly light. The Acai mojito is refreshing with absolute acai and would make a great poolside cocktail. Had blueberries and mint throughout it. Very nice cocktail selection to try alone or with the tapas and would not take away or overpower them. Next we ordered the Perfect Passion and Kumquat caiprinnha. They were out of Kumquats and was told they would be updating the menu soon since they hadn't had kumquats for awhile. I changed to have a traditional caiprinnha instead. It was very well made and a great mix of Cachaça and lime and sugar. Perfectly balanced. The perfect passion was strawberry and lychee garnished with a lychee. It was a nice balance although I liked it I didn't love it. Then finished off the happy hour with an Espresso martini and  she ordered another dreamscicle. The espresso martini was a very nice balance or coffee and not too much cream to cut some of the bite from the drink. It was very good service and well crafted cocktails and a nice mix of tasty tapas for a good price. A perfect pit stop after work or with a group of friends.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,1,1,4,a484ONk1kwt3PlUViipZgg

Ordered last night: herb roasted chicken. Used to be a whole half chicken (for less $), now 2 sad little boney pieces. Skin overcooked and whole thing way less flavorful than it used to be. The included sides were not as good either. The NY steak was delicious, only gripe is all steaks went up in price for an unnoticeable quality difference. The loaded broccoli is still there, but nowhere near as good (new cheese). Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are still great. A few other menu items have changed or disappeared altogether.

I came here for my dad's birthday celebration and was immediately greeted by the hostess with a smile. As she led me to my table, I was in shock that the place was larger than I expected. On top of that, the setting was beautiful.. dim but enough light to create that cozy setting with flowing lights on the wall. My family and I were seated at a table that didn't bear standard dining room chairs but a long couch, further emphasizing the cozy (and comfortable) trait of the restaurant.

On to the food... so tasty! To start, I ordered the lobster bisque. When it arrived, it came in a huge soup bowl filled with creamy bisque and tasty chunks of lobster. Being that there was an assortment of bread at the table (the pretzel type bread was to die for), I eagerly dipped bread into the bisque and soon enough, the bisque vanished very quickly. For my entree, I ordered the king cut 16 oz prime rib (which was big enough to split with my dad) cooked medium with sauteed onions and truffle fries.

The prime rib was huge (as you can imagine the king cut should be)! It was so tender and juicy with flavorful bursts of herbs and seasonings on the ends. I paired that up with the sauteed onions and truffle fries and it became a heavenly combination. I soon found myself literally stuffed with food but I kept forcing myself to eat as much as I could to savor the flavor of everything. 

Unfortunately I didn't have room for dessert but I plan on going back most definitely for a complete 3 course meal. Too bad they're not open on my days off, but the experience I had is worth taking another day off for in the future.",MhQ3LEYmQh0rMrrMc6J5rQ,0,0,5,tGX6sA_aBh22Aym6k0fJPQ

We chose the seafood platter for two. It had oysters, crab legs, lobster tail and claw and 4 jumbo shrimp. They had an Asian sauce, raw horseradish, cocktail sauce (not much more than ketchup) and a lemon. No drawn butter. (Really?  No butter with lobster and crab?). The lobster and crab were pretty good after we insisted on drawn butter but the rest were just ok. The flavor of the jumbo shrimp was off. Oh by the way, the bread served is just ordinary rolls, nothing special. Then we had a rib eye steak. They asked if we wanted the cilantro 18 oz or a plain 22 oz. We wanted the smaller one at 11 pm but they failed to tell us smaller meant thinner. We hate a thin steak!  It tastes different and not sure why they called it cilantro because we couldn't taste that flavor at all. By the way they shared with us that they changed the menu (under new management) so they may not have it right yet. Also menu items are now all a la carte.   We didn't try any sides.   We shared our views with the waitress which prompted a table visit from the manager (Jay) and chef (Brian).  Both individuals only were interested in talking to and giving eye contact to my husband as if I didn't matter. I felt insulted. Jay handed his card to my husband and told him to call him personally to make sure his next experience was a better one. No discount, dessert or anything else was offered.

I came here for 75% off happy hour tonight after having it bookmarked on my Yelp account for a while. I was originally at Silverton for their Thursday pub crawl, but decided to drag my brother and Don to Twin Creeks for happy hour instead. At first they were a little confused, but after finding out that it was 75% off, they quickly started perusing through the cocktail and tapas menu.

Let me just break down our orders for you:
Prime Rib Sliders (Chef's special for the night) - $10
Calamari - $8
Pitcher of Red Sangria - $28
Espressotini - $10
Perfect passion - $10
Dreamsicle - $10
Almondtini - $10
Bourbon Cookie - $10

The prime rib sliders were just a little too salty for my taste, but my bro and Don still liked them. The calamari was SO DELICIOUS. They were kind of cut up in cubes, which was different, but the breading was perfectly seasoned and the texture was was a nice combo between crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The Red Sangria was A LOT for a the price (not that everything else wasn't). It came in a large pitcher and two big cups that came filled to the rim. The Espressotini was probably my favorite. It wasn't too strong and it tasted exactly as described. The perfect passion was okay, just a little to light for my taste. I thought the Dreamsicle was also just okay, but my brother happened to like it a lot. The almondtini was very flavorful and tasted like pure almond extract (in a good way); the waitress even admitted it was her favorite. The Bourbon Cookie was too strong for me. It was one of those ""Okay, I'm just gonna f*ck you up so you guys can leave already"" drinks. Overall, it was an awesome experience to try so many creative drinks and apps for 24 bucks. Even though the drinks didn't suit my taste, my brother and Don enjoyed them very much. 

When our bill came, our discount total was $72!!! The tax was $0.06 and our TOTAL amount owed was only $24.06!! It completely blew me away. My brother even acted like a baller and threw down $30 saying, ""I got this bitches.""

Honestly, can you think of a better happy hour than this? Because I sure can't. I think I know where I'm going to celebrate my birthday...even though it's still 5 months away!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,7,5,5,fjoldZLNQWD8aXJcaOcyJA

If you didn't win one with the slots, make sure you at least dine like a winner at Twin Creeks. This is my favorite spot for happy hour; awesome food, cheap price, and great service.

The sliders are absolutely uhmazing. I brought my friend along and all he muttered the whole time was ""OMG dude, omg, so good, holy sh*t"" like ten times :)

The bacon-stuffed shrimp were so good. I mean, bacon + shrimp, that's like a match made in heaven man, all day long.

Any negatives? There must be something...Well, I noticed the tables are a little smaller than usual compared to other happy hour venues. When there's like 5-6 plates on the table, it can get a little hectic. Also, depending on the time of day, it can get pretty busy. Expect to wait a few minutes for each order.

That said, it's nothing a Sam Adams can't fix. Just sip on a beer while you're waiting and good things will come.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,3,2,5,z-1Mkyg1LTcIT6jDuNPRrw

I don't normally give 5 * but this was as close as it could get with probably a 4.5 * rating being a more accurate rating.  This review is for the lounge and not the restaurant (though I have to go back and try it someday). 

The service was wonderful, from the hostess to our waitress/bartender Michelle to the General Manager Jay, everyone was friendly, professional and easy to interact with.

We were pleasantly surprised when we checked the Silverton website and saw that Happy Hour @ Twin Creeks is an evening affair.  This worked out perfectly with our plans to go out for the evening, getting a bite to eat and then to play @ the casino.

The atmosphere was very casual elegance.  Contemporary ""old school"" could describe the environment.  Comfy, dark and just the right amount of light.  The only problem and it was admitted by the staff and management is that the high chairs make it very hard to scoot up close to the table.  Thankfully staff is able to assist and offered to do so without our asking.  They recognize this is a problem.

Drinks were good and all half priced.  Cocktails @ $5 and Stella Artois @ $3.25 per pint.  My wife is not a drinker, but really enjoyed the French Kiss (2 cocktails for her, which is rare) and the Berry Mojito (1st cocktail).  The beer on tap was Stella.

The tapas were all very nice, but our absolute favorite was the lamb chops (2) which were on the special menu.  Oh, I have to go back just to get some more of that succulent, juicy, tender and delicious lamb!  It was amazing and cooked just perfect at medium rare.  Our second favorite was the sirloin skewer, also very tender for sirloin and the bacon wrapped dates came in third.  The salmon was OK, the bacon wrapped shrimp was nice, but the BBQ sauce was unnecessary  in my opinion.

This was a wonderful find and we defiantly will return.  Probably visiting the restaurant next time for a full course meal.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,1,1,5,reR90PRwF1bd4eFkkF72sg

My pregnant significant other was craving a steak Thursday night, and being in Southern Highlands this is just 5 mins away. We were not disappointed. We destroyed the basket of fresh rolls/bread/pretzels while I enjoyed a Thursday happy hour well drink for $1! I ordered the bbq bourbon ribeye and she ordered the petite filet, both with the baked mac and cheese which was to perfection and the baked potato (with all the fixins on the side). Wow, was it a lot of food and did not disappoint!

The service was very good and they refilled our water every chance they got, if it was less than half full they topped it off. I had heard about the happy hour food specials but we didn't get seated til after 8 and we didn't wanna waste room for the steaks! 

The price was great too, this would cost well over $100-125 anywhere else. The ribeye was $29 and the filet was $28 (I believe those are right) and both included a salad and two large sides. 

There was also live music that was outstanding, we found ourselves singing along at the end of the night, completely enjoying our little date night. 

The only small thing I would criticize about this, was that the steak wasn't still really really hot when served. I cut into it and had my first bite, and it had cooled off. I know what steak enthusiasts will say, that it cooks for 5 mins after its taken off the heat and gotta let the juices sit in the meat, and to serve it a few mins after its off the heat, but damnit I want my steak super hot and sizzling and right off the grill!!

However it's not far only a couple of exits south on the freeway and for once parking is easy.  The menu is typical steakhouse, choose your steak and order sides separately, but at least the steak comes with a salad appetizer.  

We had a large party and they struggled to get the timing and details right on all the dishes.  Having said that though the dishes that were right were good, and the manager comped the problematic dishes so +1 for that.  We had a variety of steaks (bone in ribeye, petite filets, regular filets, new york).  The rib eye was thinner than I'm used to but still plenty big.  On the other hand the new york was immensely thick (1.5 inches or so).  The sides were cooked well and the only complaint on the food was that some things were overly salty.  This to me is better than a steak that is underseasoned so it could be worse.  They also pushed us to butterfly the filets, those that agreed to this seemed to end up with dryer filets, so I wouldn't recommend it.

3294147,2010-09-13,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Twin Creeks is a steakhouse tucked away by the casino cage of the Silverton Casino, which is one of the outlying casinos on the south side of town.  You can see it on your way in from LA to your left.  Though not a review of the casino, it is worth mentioning that the casino caters primarily to locals which means so does the steakhouse.

The interior decor is nice and fancy, a bit different than the ""rustic"" lodge look that goes for the rest of the joint, which isn't a bad thing either.  As you enter, you will be greeted by a single hostess, which I like better than the 3 - 5 hostess thing that a lot of fancy joints seem to employ these days.

It is fairly noisy in here as the place is really two small areas with a booths on the edges and tables for larger groups in the middle.  If you are dining with three or less, it might be good to request a booth if you want some amount of privacy.

Service in general is a bit slow, but not necessarily in a bad way.  Just that you should not be in a rush to see a show or press your sports bets.  Primarily, the bar service gets pretty backed up.  I suspect it is because it was happy hour.  There is also a host (or manager?) greeting each table.  Pretty old school, nice touch.

Speaking of happy hour, I was pleasantly surprised that they would run happy hour on a Saturday night.  Basically it is half off their tapas menu and their specialty drinks.  The tapas menu just has about 10 items and are fairly simple.  Since tapas was not our focus, I just ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and the calamari ($10 and $8 non-happy hour).  The shrimp was good, but just four pieces, while the calamari was pretty good, but probably a smaller portion than average.  The drink menu is only 10 or so mixed drinks such as mojito, martini expresso, mint julip and sangrias.  The drinks for fine and are a good deal at $5 ($3 for sangrias) I wouldn't recommend going tapas or specialty drinks without happy hour pricing.

Not on the happy hour were the oysters $11 from Connecticut.  They were pretty good, though nothing special.  I also had their chop salad $8, pretty standard bleu cheese and bacon, not a sharable portion.

You get a basket of fancy bread with your meal.  Actually quite good.

Side dishes were brocollini $7 and mac n cheese $7.  The former was about five stalks, not enough for 2, I would say.  The latter was about a 5 inch skillet size.  Pretty good, but not amazing.

For the main dishes, we ordered the 28oz porterhouse x2 ($36) and the scallops ($22).  Oddly enough, they didn't have any ""porterhouse for two"" available on their menu, though it would have saved us some dough.  The steaks were decent, made to specs, but again not particularly great, but not bad either.  It had this odd consistency like it was ""too smooth"", I couldn't taste the muscle fibers... hard to describe.  You get five scallops with your order, so while they are good, it is for lighter appetites.

The dessert menu was pretty weak, so we passed.  It mostly consisted of ice-cream dishes and tiramisu.  If this dessert is a big deal, be sure to check ahead to see what they have as this may rotate around.

Total bill pre-tip = $181.18 for 9 cocktails, 2 tapas, oysters, chop salad, mac n cheese, broccolini, 2 28oz steaks, scallops.  I'd say a pretty good deal.  Happy hour saved us $43.50.

Overall, this place is a good place to celebrate in particular if you are a local.  If you are a tourist and want to go somewhere nice, but not pay the fancy strip prices, this is also good for you.  If you want to be ""seen"" on the scene, then this is definitely not your scene.  Be sure to make reservations.  Despite the recession, this place was pretty busy.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,1,0,4,5V9zXO-ZBw3fXg0k62NvNQ

I was worried that I may be too casual since I wasn't planning on eating at a nice restaurant when I set out to run errands that day. My sister and I rolled in there with our jeans and Chucks without any strange looks or hesitation from the friendly hostess. 

I ordered the lobster bisque and I thought it was just okay. To me, it was more like a tomato bisque with some lobster pieces. It lacked the buttery, richness that makes a good lobster bisque IMO. 

For dinner I ordered the cilantro marinated rib-eye and potatoes au gratin. OMG that rib-eye was the best steak I have ever tasted! Perfectly cooked at medium rare with so much great flavor from the cilantro marinade. I've had great steaks throughout the years and it's not hard to mess up a steak as long as its quality meat and cooked to your liking. But dude, this cilantro marinade took it to the next level and I still have dreams about it! Don't even dare think about putting any steak sauce on that masterpiece. Just leave it alone and take in all that yumminess the way it comes.

Although this is a fine dining restaurant, it's definitely not pretentious and I'm very glad they didn't mind the casual attire.

We ordered 3 appetizers for 2 people, because we were not super hungry.  We ordered aioli potatotes- awesome.  They were half price so they were only 2 dollars!! We also ordered 2 glasses of Pinot Noir for only 4 dollars a glass.  
We ordered the meatballs- 3 big ones and very tasty and we ordered one of the specials that was not advertised- the prime rib sliders with just meat and cheese.
These were clearly the winning of the 3.
Plenty of food.
The atmosphere was awesome as well as the service- I think our total bill was like 18 dollars- what a screaming deal.   They also play some awesome old standards as you enjoy such great food.

3377093,2018-03-19,4,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Twin Creeks is probably one of our favorite local steakhouses. Why? Convenience, free parking, great customer service along with reasonable prices make us keep coming back.

The staff remembers us every time we come back, we always bring friends and family here. Sometimes when it's busy service can be a little bit slow but that is part of the ambience as far as I am concerned.

We enjoy the sit-down area along with the Beautiful light changing Rockwall. This dimly-lit beautiful tiny Steakhouse is a little gem! I'm not sure where they get their Seafood from but it is very fresh and I highly suggest the seafood platter to start.

I am always partial to their petite filet mac and cheese with lobster and their wedge salad. The last visit we had we took friends and went for the tomahawk for two along with Alaskan king crab legs. They did not disappoint and I was incredibly surprised by the huge bone in Tomahawk Steak!

If you are a local or a tourist give this place a try- make a reservation though because they can get very booked. If you're not hungry enough for a two hour sit-down dinner try their happy hours which are great and include Half Price appetizers and specialty cocktails!

There were 12 of us who came here for dinner for RW. Most ordered of the pre-fixe menu. I opted to order from the regular menu. I ordered the spinach salad to start, the salmon with veggies for dinner with a side of au gratin potatoes. My salad was good and larger than the one that came with the RW meal. The salmon was good and almost well done (how I like it) and the veggies were good as well. The au gratin potatoes were.....eh. I've had better from a box, lol. I did taste the lobster bisque and I thought that was rather tasty. 

The drinks menu was very reasonably priced however, I tried 2 drinks and didn't care for either one. The waiter was very nice to not charge me for the first one that I only took a couple of sips of.

The ambiance of the place was cool. A little too dark for me, as I feel like I had to strain to see my friends, but I did enjoy it.  Others in my party......not so much. From what I've heard, most did not care for how the steak came out. Way too overdone was what they were upset at.

Service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and relatively quick with drinks for such a large group.

I can't say I'd go back, but I wont say I wouldn't. I'd probably give them another shot for happy hour. Half price drinks and appetizers......sounds like a winner to me!",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,2,1,3,_9j2McGIcdYhoRFov4a_SQ
3519495,2010-12-19,1,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"After dining here the words that come to mind when thinking about this place are: comfortable and great value.  Twin Creeks is the steak house in the Silverton casino and while I've been in this casino dozens of times I didn't think about eating here until just recently. When you walk in there's a small bar and lounge to the right. Just past that to the left and further back into the restaurant is one of the most comfortable dining rooms I've been to recently. There are some secluded booths that would be perfect for a romantic night out and plenty of other tables with over-sized leather sofas that make you feel like you're at home the second you sit down. It's a perfect setting to get your self into a food coma.

We weren't that hungry so we decided to split an app and entree. First up were the crab cakes ($15). It came out as two small ones with three pieces of asparagus all on top of some sauce that probably had a ton of butter. The description said they were jumbo lump crab cakes but there weren't any large chunks of crab. I still can't find crab cakes that come close to real Maryland ones but these were pretty good nonetheless.

Our entree came with a salad that split for us. Nice touch. It was good, as far as salads go. The main dish ($42) was a special that isn't always on their menu -- Alaskan king crab legs. After a long wait (maybe half and hour or more after we finished the salad) it came out. 2.5 large legs cut lengthwise along with a gravy boat of clarified butter... yum! There was plenty of sweet, soft crab meat to fill both of us up. The dish also came out with more asparagus and a large baked potatoes with all the fixins on the side (the large, diced up chunks of bacon were amazing).

Service was solid, but they could have timed the dishes better. The food and atmosphere were great, making this place an ideal spot for anyone looking for a nice, ""fancy"" meal out at a reasonable price. It isn't cheap, but compared to places on the strip Twin Creeks is an amazing value for the quality of food served.

3577103,2015-03-08,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"I came here after getting a comp from my host at Silverton.  I really liked that everything was taken care of electronically, from the reservation to the payment.  I didn't have to present any comp slip or anything at the end of the meal, just the remaining check balance was presented to me and I was on my way.

I'll be comparing some to Fiesta Henderson's Fuego Steakhouse, which is another casino steakhouse I visit quite a bit.  

The atmosphere is decent, but not amazing.  The tables feel a bit crowded together.  We were seated quickly and they were not overly busy or anything.  We got a basket of bread that consisted of a large flat cracker thing that tasted like Cheez-Its (not a bad thing), and two small pieces of raisin bread, white bread, and white bread with cheese on top -- each piece of bread was like half a thick slice of a French loaf.  Honestly, they need to step their bread game up.  Fuego kills them here, and I would have even preferred a basket of plain soft white rolls.

The waiter came over and took our order.  I'll note that they do not have a lot of chicken dishes like some steakhouses (notably there is no boneless chicken dish).  I got the filet mignon done medium with demi-glace, my girlfriend got butterflied filet mignon well done, and we split sides of macaroni & cheese, au gratin potatoes, garlic mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts.   It took a little bit longer than expected to arrive.

First off, the steaks were great. My steak seemed a touch overdone, but the taste was spot on.  I've never had demi-glace before, but it was nothing special and after using a little of it I left it off as it was just ruining the taste of the beef.  It tasted very much of a watery brown gravy.  My girlfriend got full and I had about a third of her steak which was left over.  Even though it was well done, it was amazingly tender and tasted wonderful.  The macaroni and cheese and au gratin potatoes were both top notch.  The garlic mashed potatoes were not that great and we did not eat more than a spoonful of them.  I don't eat brussel sprouts but my girlfriend said they were good.

The waiter took a bit too long to bring the check over.  Everything, including a glass of wine, came to around $101 (before comp) which is reasonable.  

It's hard to pick between Fuego and Twin Creeks.  Twin Creeks steak was better, but the sides (with the exception of the au gratin potatoes) are better at Fuego, the bread basket is absolutely to die for at Fuego, the service is slightly better at Fuego, and the prices are just a touch cheaper at Fuego.  It sounds like I make a pretty convincing case for Fuego, but in my mind it's a lot closer than that.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,4,jq2S_Xz-PYCa1mCgPiUxOw

Having had the chance to try like 75% of the happy hour menu from before as well as the new one, I feel comfortable saying that this is one of the best deals in Vegas. Too bad it's not 75% off like it used to apparently be.

The cocktails here at around 5 dollars a piece during happy hour are absolutely a steal. They are crafted with complex flavors with a flair for presentation. But here is the drawback - the new happy hour is only one hour long, but twice a day. 5-6pm and 9-10pm. This makes it hard to really sit there and have some drinks and also to try a lot of the foods.

Still, it's hard to pass on the stuffed mushroom, the dates, or even the bread basket. Some of my old favorites are gone, but it appears they are going to try and change the menu a little more often now to entice people back in. The new scallops are worth highlighting on the new menu, though I miss the old stuffed peppers and meatballs as well.

Admittedly, some of the tapas feel a little pricey at times, even at half off, so I doubt I'd find myself here not at one of those times.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,4,2,4,hSwsjZHH9xgiTUzQGAazUA

After a stellar evening by the kitchen and service staff where they put out a killer spread(See Trick R' Yelp reviews) We went back on Saturday evening
for Happy Hour assuming we were in for another great evening since we've always had awesome experiences during our five previous visits at Twin Creeks...

On this night however, the kitchen staff and our server and her food runners
COMPLETELY SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!

-Kitchen crew sent out our Bacon Wrapped Dates without crumbled blue cheese...to the cook in charge of putting that dish together, the chef expiditing all the plates before leaving the kitchen, and our sarcastic server(who was bitchy all night after we sent the dates back to be properly done)...ALL OF YOU couldn't see that there was something missing? you only serve hundreds of those every week!?!?!?

Sound like I'm making a big deal out of it? tables around us didn't have blue cheese on their dates either, (they were first time diners). So we order another round of tapas and our orders get delivered to ANOTHER TABLE!?!?

We order the Seafood Parpadelle to share, which comes with a salad AND their bomb-ass bread basket. Our salad goes to another table, back to the kitchen, then finally to our table...The mussels in the parpadelle were borderline jerky, just like those I've had at Firefly on Sahara(NASTY!)
Our server's excuse for the mess ups?...""Everyone is tweaked out on Red Bulls by this time of the week...Sorry!""
and that bread basket????Never made it to our table....Minus 1 Star for the sucky food that night, minus 1 star for the sucky and sarcastic service we recieved...ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,8,2,3,yLalmWSSXn4BVL2sjbyMSA

Came here for the first time on a whim with few friends. TBH, we didn't expect the food to be as good as it was lol

We were seated in the back with the romantic dim-lit steakhouse feels.
Ordered a bottle of wine at the waitress' recommendation and wasn't disappointed in her choice of red.

Order shrimp cocktail, oysters on the half shell, and tuna sashimi on oysters. BOY, these apps were tasty! Funny thing was the aspect of the apps I loved the most were the sea beans/asparagus the oysters were on. You don't see that too often and when I ate it, it was salty and crisp -- all around yummmyyyyyyyy!!!!!

Although I really wanted to order lamb, I was craving a big fat steak! lol 
Went with the recommendation of the TC Rib Eye from the waitress -- you know, always try what the place is known for! And most of my friends did the filet or regular rib eye. 

We all shared sides of mac and cheese, mash, creamed corn, truffle fries, and glazed carrots. 

Let me tell you, I could've orders 20 of those creamed corn sides and been a very happy woman! If you order absolutely anything here -- YOU HAVE TO DO THE CREAMED CORN! lol

The inside is very dark the setting is kinda romantic lots of couples up to 4 people groups. The service is kind of slow too start. We waited 15 minutes just to get our drinks after we ordered them and we didn't even get to order food yet. My immediate thought was this place was gonna have bad casino steak. I was wrong.

The food we ordered was beef carpaccio, 12 oz prime rib and lobster tail, tomahawk steak. Our sides were creamed corn, grilled asparagus and house salad. 

The beef carpaccio came out first. The beef was cut way too thinly but i think it tasted great with the truffles on top and the brioche bread. The house salad came after. I didnt like the house salad at all. They put WAY too much dressing on it. Every bite tasted like straight balsamic vinaigrette. I only took 2 bites out of it. 

The main course came out next my prime rib was cooked perfectly how i ordered it. It tasted very good. The lobster tail was also very good with the melted butter. The rib eye was very good and seasoned perfectly. I was really surprised, like i said thought it was just gonna be cheap casino steak. The sides were mediocre. Just basic grilled asparagus and creamed corn with bacon. Nothing amazing.

I think the price was biggest thing for me. All that food plus 4 drinks ordered it was only $155. At other restaurants it would've easily been over $300. I definitely would go back and recommend this steak house for other people.",fKqMqB36iwQuskyXB1kOtw,0,0,4,ZNvYd2a-JJC86ZrJwS7FHA

Starting from the moment you walk in you are greeted warmly and seated immediately (with reservations). The setting is romantic, dark and intimate, the stand out for me is the beautiful rock wall with changing lighting and water effect. The menu is rather extensive considering this is a steak house. The house specialties are extra special in the fact that they include two sides and a salad, no individual pricing here! We ordered the Bourbon Ribeye (with bone in) and the Queen's cut prime rib, the sides we choose were baked potato, broccoli, mashed potato and mac n cheese. The first item brought to the table is the basket of artisan bread, this included various rolls and flat bread. The stand outs for me were the little salty muffins and the pretzel roll, yummy! Then we were served our scrumptious salad, a medley of greens which included shaved carrots, onion and cucumber, oh and two types of tomato (red and yellow). Superb, the house dressing (vinaigrette) and blue cheese rocked our world. Oh but the pièce de résistance were the meats, hands down the best rib eye and prime rib we have ever had. The prime rib seasoning was out of this world as was the bourbon sauce that accompanied the rib eye. Once we commenced all conversation ceased and all you heard was was oooh ahhh. Oh and lets talk about the sides, I knew it was a good choice to order the baked potato, the fixing came in a cute tray, chives, sour cream, butter and beautiful chunks (yes chucks) of bacon! I was truly in love... The broccoli was served with plenty of butter and oh so tasty. As for the mac n cheese, it was crunchy on the top perfection. I swear I seen a tear in the Hubby's eye. We were simply amazed at the value of this place, the price for the prime rib was only $19 and the rib eye $26 and all the sides included!?! Could it get any better!?!

Wait...no, I mean...

Anyway, the parentals live in Vegas, so when I visit them, they always take me to all kinds of places off the Strip--M Resort, Silverton Casino, Arizona Charlie's, Lake Las Vegas, Red Rock, Home Depot, Ross, 7-11, you name it. I normally wouldn't bother to review anything in Vegas, but this one was very Yelp worthy.

**Oh, and to cut you off before it enters your mind--my mom is not a stripper and my mom's husband was never featured barefoot on ""Cops""--they are in fact retired folk who like to gamble.**

The parentals treated me to this wonderful restaurant for my Valentine's Day birfday. The first thing I must comment on is how reasonable the prices are for the quality of the restaurant and the food!!! We were comped of course because my parents do their ""thing"" with the gambling and all, but I saw the final bill and it was VERY reasonable for what we ate. I think with tip, the bill was something like $170 for three people, who all got full from an entree each, appetizers, sides, drinks, etc.

Things started off perfectly with a new drink concoction they put together, consisting of Van Gogh raspberry vodka, chambord, sweet and sour, and a fresh raspberry. Suffice it to say, I have adopted this drink as my own little inanimate Cambodian child. Then, oh my god, THEN, they brought out probably the best basket of artisan breads I've ever encountered. The pretzel bread was amazing as was the white chocolate bread. The lavash also gets an honorable mention and so do the little biscuits and so does the cranberry bread--yeah, actually that covers all the bread in the basket.

As for the appetizer, entrees, and sides that climaxed the dinner, you can let my photos speak for themselves. We shared lobster ravioli, which was mouthwateringly crispy and rich with big chunks of lobster, as well as the truffle potatoes, which were essentially triangle-shaped country potatoes/scalloped potatoes/hash browns made with truffle oil. Unlike most places, they actually used enough truffle oil to be able to distinctly smell and taste it!!! Very rare!!

I tasted all the food and I loved it all. My mom got the scallops stuffed with blue lump crab (SARAP SARAP as she would say)--so rich and buttery soft; my mom's husband got a filet mignon (not photographed because it looked like any other filet mignon) with baked mac n' cheese and an uncomfortably phallic baked potato (with accompanying sour cream, chives, and REAL bacon bits with the fat and all), which he thoroughly enjoyed; and I ordered the pan seared salmon which also pleased my palette. The best entree though was definitely my mom's scallops. No jokes please. Okay, maybe just this one: ""yo momma so fat, she's got other fat mommas orbiting her"".

Overall, an amazing birfday dinner with two of my favorite people in the world: My non-stripper mom and her non-criminal husband.

PS. The restaurant is impeccably designed with old school, cigar lounge-type furniture and a cascading water wall. Niiiiice!

I had a reservation for two on a Sunday. Got sat right away however the server was a bit slow with getting our drinks, taking our order, etc. 

We ordered the bone in ribeye and the prime rib. Absolutely amazing - it's making my mouth water as I write this review. I loved the crab cakes however wasn't too big of a fan of the sauce it came with. The rock shrimp was tasty but thought it could use more of a crunch. And I loved the Mac n Cheese.

Food was very good. Had a rib eye steak. Cooked well and seasoned perfectly. Giant yam was half a yam.  

Service was where it fell apart. I ate at the bar where most restaurants even poor ones can do great service.  The service here was just ok.  When you are selling $40 steaks, you shouldn't have to wait forever in a pitch dark restaurant for a check or a refill.


One note and this did not affect my review but just a heads up. Silverton is made of lead or something so cell phones don't work well there. In this restaurant, they don't work at all.  Make sure you have your phone checking done before you dine. If you are looking for a cell phone free place, this is it.",duzFKdfs11WdiSfkPeherA,0,0,3,j9y9w9PHBJuZ6XtVkC7RZw

They are not cheap, but their prices are reasonable. Their steaks are fantastic. However, when we come here we enjoy their seafood selections. Last time we were here we had the fresh seafood platter which included lobster, crab legs, oysters, and shrimp. It was delicious! 

As for their staff, they are all fantastic. Our waitress the last few times has been Sue (or it could have been Jan? Now I think I'm forgetting.) Anyways, when we come back I'll get the name right and will update this review accordingly. But to whatever her name is, BIG SHOUT OUT for great customer service! She was talkative but not too talkative, attentive but not overly attentive, and when I ordered my martini the bar tender was unavailable, so she made it herself. When she told me that I was a little hesitant because I am rather picky about my drinks, but it was honestly one of the best martinis I have ever had. (Stoli martini, extremely dirty, three olives.)

I use Open Table to book reservations, not sure why the Open Table link is gone from Yelp but you can book online.

The setting is great for dress up attire but you can  go causal as well its Vegas you can do anything! So don't feel pressured to dress up.

Ambience is somewhat dim in the booths but lights up more towards the back stone wall and if you want something more intimate you can ask for a booth. Overall it's great for dinner with friends, family or a date.

They give you a basket full of breads, think they are French roll slices, Parmesan Asiago, and this sweet golden raisin one that's so amazing with the side of butter they give you.

When you order, the menu has items to compose your own entree, so you order your protein, and can add sides or a different sauce for additional cost.

I always get the petite filet Mignon, twin creeks house salad (AMAZING-highly recommend) and Truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. The filet was $34, $5 potatoes, $6 grilled asparagus, and $6 salad.

I think it's adequately priced. You can choose your sides which is awesome because no one likes an entree that's already set for you that you have to substitute.

Also, the chef has his cooks bring out your food which is really special.

Their drinks include amazing martinis, and a full wine list and different liquors. I hope they serve craft beer in the future as it would do great for beer pairings, since they currently offer NO BEER.

Shoutout to Peter, (server) and Danny (served water and bread) they were FANTASTIC. I love the older gentleman who greets you with a smile at the entrance and invites you to your table like your VIP. He makes you feel super special. He always has a nice suit on and a friendly demeanor.

Thank you Twin Creeks for the amazing experiences. The food is too fantastic! Just bring craft beer! I would love a beer pairing event here!",-aFnqYJnRoJgCsJYm-DZOA,3,2,5,ecD0xoEyPntG43Arvq3FOw

I haven't been to Twin Creeks for many years, so long it was before the renovation to its current setup.  I came here because some friends had a dining credit from a pull tab winner they had while here.  They mailed it to me from their home so it didn't go to waste.  The credit would have been better used at the Sundance Grill or the Mi Casa Cantina.

I was seated promptly at a high top table that would hold four people and I had a good seat for people watching.  I was asked about bottled/tap water and then delivered the iced tea I wanted.  I had looked at the menu online and I had a question about the TC cilantro marinated rib eye.  Susan, my server, explained that it was marinated 3 hours and wasn't strong with cilantro.  That would have been OK with me if it had been longer and I opted to go with that.  For an appetizer, I ordered the seared foie gras.

After a fair wait, a runner brought the foie gras.  There wasn't much to it, but you get what you pay for.  The foie was OK.  There is a blood orange gastrique on the foie.  It sounded funny but it works.  It's light and doesn't overwhelm the foie.  The sautéed mushrooms with it were good.

Then came the steak.  I knew as soon as I saw it they had overcooked it.  I asked for it cooked blue.  It was black and blue which means they left it on the grill on each side to give it a sear which had the result of cooking the steak too much given its thinness.  I was not going to go through the whole take it back and do another one but cook it less so I just ate what I got.  The steak was poor quality.  I literally had to fight the bone to get some meat from it and I ended up tearing the meat from the bone with a combination right knife with a left hook fork.  I would have gotten the same or better quality if I bought a rib eye at Albertson's and brought for them to cook.  The steak was tougher than the Cubs, too!

Along with the steak, I got the large yam for a side.  That was almost the best part of the meal.  The cinnamon flavored butter and the sweetness of the potato was quite flavorful.

For dessert, I got the crème brûlée which was well done with a good vanilla bean flavor.

Now that I've been back, I won't make a return visit.  I have an open Restaurant Week slot to fill now because this is off my list--permanently!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,20,12,2,ydccLC1K875fs_FydWlOBw

We walked in at 6pm, happy hour lasts until 8pm.  The lounge was pretty small and was already filling up.  Since there was 4 of us, the only table available was right in front of the band ( okay may not a whole band but two guys, one with bongos and the other with guitar and electric piano)
There was one table available but we were told someone had already ""reserved"" it- apparently a man came in and said he wanted that table so they set it up and he never came back...maybe you shouldn't hold tables for people during happy hour?? Either take it now or let someone else have it.

Okay, so let's start with our waitress, she was VERY nice but as the place filled up, she ended up taking a large party and we hardly saw her after we got a few drinks and some food..SO, my advice to Twin Creeks management? Uh- have a cocktail waitress designated to the lounge area only during happy hour?? 
Anyhow- since Thursdays are $1 well drink at all bars in the Silverton, that included Twin Creeks- SCORE!!  I ordered a drink called Dragon's eye- had lychee puree and a lime or lemon vodka and it was $5.  The mister kept with vodka tonics $1 each!  The well drinks in the restaurant were better than the other bars in the Silverton, not as watered down.

Now- tapas...here is the breakdown of what we ordered:
Stuffed mushrooms- it was okay, not spectacular.
Roasted potato- delish! Was covered in a indian spice and had a chipotle aioli.
Meatballs- not bad, not dry, good flavor and marinara
Smoked salmon on brioche toast and fried capers- SOOOO good! I wanted to order another!

We also ordered an Ahi Tuna dish that's not on the HH menu- was not bad either, it was on a bed of some type of seaweed and apple-pear.
 
My friends ordered the bacon wrapped dates, which was actually very good considering I'm not a fan of sweet/savory combos.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was a little dry.

Overall- it was a good night.  Our bill after 4 well drinks, 1 martini, one entree and 3 tapas only came to $38!!! Woo hoo!! We will definitely be back!!!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,1,1,4,qHLAY0tjqitOKP-mpbZziA

Booked through OpenTable for 8:30 August 9th, and got there 8:25pm.  Waited a min or two and we were seated in an area that had prob a party of 16, so our table was by itself at the other end. Which we thought would make it nice and quiet.

Waited a good bit to order bottled water. We had to ask the girl that wasn't our server to send our server by, we had plenty of time to decide on our order as we waited. I order the reg filet medium and my mom and sister both got the petite filet medium well. Also a few sides. Honestly I thought the prices were great, not the typical bloated a la carte prices.

The place had the a/c blasted and it got cold, and I'm a guy I love the a/c but was freezing.

We waited and waited... The large group finally got their food and our server said ours would be out next. Maybe the group put everyone's orders back a while. When it finally got to us it had been 70 minutes from the time of our reservation!!! As the food runner was placing the filets I couldn't tell the difference in the sizes (our server later said the petite is 6oz and the reg is 8oz pretty small in my book) I cut into mine and took a few bites and it was not medium. My mom and sisters were not medium well but theirs looked medium. Our server took her time checking on us and I showed her that mine was not medium which she agreed. She said she would talk to the chef, I said if I can be out quickly I would like a new one. She came back and said the chef told her he could make it butterfly style and have it some in 6 minutes. I said fine. 

Interestingly I went out with some friends a while back and we made fun of one of the guys for ordering a filet butterfly style.

The filet came out and it was fine. I enjoyed it, just not the hassle. Then we were thinking of getting desserts but again waited quite a while and finally asked the other girl again and she brought the menus. Our server finally came out and we said if they dessert was quick we could do it, again we were going straight the the airport from here. It came out and it was good as well.

Anyway she comp'd the dessert (of course that was the least I would expect). Total was $126 and I still tipped $20 even though I honestly shouldn't have. If I had the time I would've asked for the manager. Figured I'd email the manager later when I have time. Guess what no email or direct contact info!

Modern, dim, and chic. 

We sat in the lounge for HH. I believe it's 3pm-7pm. The hostess (Asian long blonde hair) was extremely pleasant and nice. I was a hostess for a long time, so I know a good hostess when I see one.

During RW, it's a pre fixed dinner menu for $40. You could also order from their regular menu as well, but we came specifically for restaurant week. 

I started off with a cocktail (not included in RW). I'm pretty sure it was called pineapple fusion or infusion, something like that. Anyway, it tasted like the coconut pineapple ice cream that Thrifty sells. Brought back memories when my mom and I used to walk to Thrifty and get ice cream. However, this cocktail was $10!!! It was good, but not $10 good. My friends were also not impressed with their drink selection either. Just wait to get a drink in the casino, it's cheaper and you won't be disappointed. 

As for my meal, here's the breakdown. 

Appetizer was either lobster bisque or spinach salad. I've never been fond of bisque anything so I opted for the salad. It was decent, the vinaigrette was tasty and the spinach had crunch. Nothing spectacular. 

Main course was roasted chicken, halibut or filet mignon. I wanted the biggest bang for my buck so I got the filet mignon, medium RARE. When it arrived, I was happy to see the juices running from the steak all over my plate. I thought ""good, it's still a little bloody."" Nope what I got was overcooked, medium WELL steak. If I wanted meat cooked that much I might as well have ordered well done. The steak lacked flavor and I couldn't finish it. The mashed potatoes and broccoli tasted like something I could have made at home. Bland and blah. 1 star for the main entree. 

Dessert was creme brûlée or chocolate lava cake. It's sad to say that dessert was the highlight of the meal. The creme brûlée was really good, just wish they would have charred the sugar on top more. 

During dinner I noticed how dark it was inside the restaurant. When my food arrived, I didn't realize how close my face was to my food because I couldn't see it.

The quality and pride put into each and every dish makes this place one of the BEST around.  This place can not only stand up to any place on the Las Vegas Strip, but it can beat it in price, quality and taste.

The manager is one of the most caring professionals I have ever met who really takes the time to ensure this place runs as smoothly as possible.  He goes above and beyond to ensure every customer receives the best service possible.

Lets talk about the food.  My wife and I shared the Cilantro Marinated Ribeye which was the best we have found in Vegas.  Not only by price, but by taste, made to perfection the way you order it, Chef Paul knows what he is doing.

It does come without sides but for the price they charge for the sides you are still getting an amazing meal for a cheaper price then anywhere else on the strip and there is NO comparison.

The Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Garlic Spinach were both excellent.  We also ordered the Watermelon Salad which they say is on the special menu as seasonal, but I tell you what, it was the best salad we have ever had, it is very popular and anyone who goes here, you need to tell them they need to place this on the regular menu all the time.

Dessert, OMG a Cronut is to die for....what is a cronut, well I guess you will just have to visit this place and order the strawberry shortcake with cronut to find out.  They also have a mini creme brûlée which comes with fresh berries and nuts on the side is perfect after the amazing meal you will have here.

We will become regulars at this place and there is nothing in town we have found that compares and Chef Paul, I have never met him, but everyone who works there speaks very highly of him as being one of the most down to earth people you will meet.  A lot of chefs think they are high and mighty, not Chef Paul, he takes the energy some Chefs exhibit to the public and he puts it in his food.  Yes, there is a SHORT happy hour from 5 to 6 and 9 to 10, that's it, but who cares, the food is worth the price and worth the visit.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,2,0,5,OhunMmUYXLGUwAZ9YDTztA

I finally made it here with Eric R. to test out the 75% off happy hour, when we came by after our failed event that conflicted with the elite event at Silverton.  I really wanted to try the golden cucumber mint cocktail, but our waitress/bartender suggested the toasted almond since it is my favorite drink bartenders never seem to know how to make.  Martini style here, the $10 drink became $2.50 with the wave of a time wand and I ended up with a frothy delicious amaretto-kahlua-cream combo that rivaled a very tasty drink I had many times during happy hour in our Cambodia hotel on the honeymoon (that one had Baileys, which sometimes makes its way into toasted almonds).

I made Eric R. order the oatmeal cookie martini because his favorite ice cream is Ben n Jerry's oatmeal cookie crunch which I hunted down at many stores until I found it.  We got the calamari (which was $2!) - all to myself bc the boy doesn't eat anything fried, the meatballs (all beef, very tasty), and the smoked salmon toasts.  Eric decided he wanted a salad so he got the chopped with romaine instead of iceberg, and the waitress was cool sending it back bc it was doused in dressing and he wanted it on the side.  The salad was not on happy hour, so it doubled the cost of our meal, but it was our third $18 meal this week for the 2 of us so no complaints here.  The best part was running into Anthony M., Jieun L., and Sun M. on our way out...and then Angela H. and Jade W. and Andy T.!

* Lamb Chops $20 ($10 during HH)

I had almost forgotten how incredible TC can be. Everything was excellent, particularly the caprese and the lamb chops. The horseradish sauce that came with the sliders was a perfect accompaniment.

Their lamb chops are also good as well. I didn't get them last night but they are my go to meal if the specials don't appeal to me. I would recommend these. 

The side that surprised me with how good it was was the creamed corn. Who knew how good that side could be?! It was topped with a crunchy toping and the cream tasted like a cheese based cream. The best part was it wasn't too heavy like the macaroni usually is. I would recommend this side.

 My new york was pretty good but my wife said her fillet was tough. Salad and sides were decent. Price was reasonable. I guess the lack of awesome service bummed us out a little.",viK0WBxOVdcG1f4Xqkrp5w,1,0,2,FtrZDuJ8Kp7sGLBqO_wH_Q

I have been to several of the well known Las Vegas steak houses, both on and off of the strip, and Twin Creeks is still my favorite. As a Las Vegas local and someone who works in the hospitality industry, I am often asked for dining suggestions. I always suggest Twin Creeks and throw in that they should try my favorite dessert, the Crème Brulee companied by their French press coffee. 

Additionally, it is nice that the menu is not priced all ala carte. We had a horrible dinner (no dessert) at Hank's for over $450 and an amazing dinner with dessert and coffee at Twin Creeks for $300.

Crazy that it's half off and then 75% after 8pm (only in the lounge area)! Nuts! It's well crafted drinks and the appetizers are overall pretty good. The bartender, Rob, is patient and very attentive even though it was well packed. 

Since they were having a promotion of 2for1 entrees at Silverton for the next few days some people decided to take advantage of it while we were there. It looked good so the BF and I decided to come early the next day and bring his mom and grandma for steaks. 

We all had the bone in ribeye. It's very good value for $29 and great value at 2 for 1. It comes with salad, two sides and a really good bread basket (chocolate bread! pretzel bread!noms! ) The steak was pretty decent quality for the price. It comes with a bourbon sauce and a blue cheese butter (they usually ask if you want it on the side, but if not, fair warning it's on the steak) and they roast a whole garlic bulb. I actually thought the bourbon sauce was just okay but I used a fair amount of the butter and I stole everyones roasted garlic. If you didn't devour your bread yet, spread some of the garlic on the bread- it's delish! The family really enjoyed their dinner so if they're happy, I'm really happy.  We got a table at the lounge, so you guessed it- I took advantage of the happy hour too for cocktails! TC Manhattan and bacon wrapped dates to start off the night.

The service was attentive and friendly despite being very busy. We had Rob again taking care of us. 

This place is great. Only downside is it's off the beaten path- I'm never in this area, but I suppose a special trip now and then isn't so bad.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,3,5,J21F6R9NXQLuZ4kc-MHVug
5053718,2011-08-15,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"Right now they are running the 75% off tapas and drinks happy hours after 8pm.  This is hands down the best happy hour I've ever experienced in my life and you'll see why.

First off, the ambience of this place was amazing.  We were lucky to get a table for our party of 4.  The setting is extremely nice and our server was personable and energetic.  Service was a tad on the slow side, but I couldn't complain because I was so excited to try everything.

We ordered everything off the tapas list.  Honestly, the tapas were just OK.  I've had much better at places like Firefly or something.  But the prices!!  AMAZING!!  We're talking like 1-4 dollar plates (4 dollars at most!).  I generally loooove (LOVE) stuffed dates... but sadly, didn't really like them here.  The dates were kind of chewy and it didn't have enough sweet/salty combo to it.  The tapas that I'd have to call out is the calamari (they are not the rings, but breaded steak cut into strip style) and also the fondue that they have.  All the others were pretty standard fare.

Another thing worth mentioning is the bread basket.  Free and amazing.  I think this was one of the best bread baskets I've ever had.  Pretzels and specialty breads all of them fluffy and flavorful.  

Now the drinks.  Our group (there were four of us) got to sample a lot.  From shots to mojitos, to specialty martinis and cocktails.  There were all good and the mixed drinks were strong!  I really loved the Acai mojito (one of the better mojitos I've ever had) and the Passion something (it's on their specials menu) tasted like one of my favorite candies (Hi-Chew - some japanese taffy).  Another thing I really liked was the Dreamsicle which tasted exactly the popsicle.  You could tell that they put a lot of effort into the cocktails which is really awesome.  We would really never get to sample so many delicious drinks if not for the happy hour prices.  

All in all - this is a great place to sit and relax with a group of friends. 

So after 13 plates of tapas and 16 specialty drinks... our bill with 61 bucks.  61 bucks!  And that's why this was the best happy hour ever!",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,2,1,5,PsbEvlnisVUglnsQQlV5Xw

Here we are, alone, in the midst of wildness, turning on our headlamps to began our hour long decent down a gully behind Rose Tower in Red Rock, and another 2 miles hike back to our car.

We just finished climbing Olive Oil, a classic and remote 600' climb here in Red Rock. We started a little late, and the weather is cooling down rapidly. We had eggs and bacon for breakfast, but while belaying Chris, I only had two bars for the rest of the day, much the same for Chris.

Hopping from boulder to boulder and trying to get back to the car as fast as we can before complete darkness sets in. We were getting hungry and naturally started to keep us going by talking about dinner.

""What's for dinner?"" I asked

""A damn big piece of steak"" Chris yelled.

""Deal""

I got out my phone, paused for a few second, quickly asked my friend Stuart who has been patiently waiting in the car for us to look for a good steak restaurant.

90 mins later, we made to back to our car in the parking lot all in one piece. Looking back at the mountain, we pity the two fools that are still repelling from another long climb, and seems to have another 3 hour before they can hit the parking lot. 

""Twin Creeks got good review on yelp, and it is much cheaper than the ones that are on the strip"" Stuart said.

15 mins later, we are sitting in a comfortable booth at Twin Creeks. Drinking water, looking over the menu as our adventure never happened except we are dirty and hungry.

Twin Creeks didn't disappoint, the cuts of prime rib are very generous, the medium are on slightly the raw side. All the sides are huge! I mean huge! You get a lot for your money, that's for sure. And climbers love that! The scallops are done to perfection, and the modern interpretation of mushroom ravioli is rather rich and interesting. 

Service is fast, our waiter is very attentive, but it was not on a weekend.

THE GOOD:

-my wife's petite filet was fantastic. cooked to perfection and great flavor
-the special drink (the Godfather) was excellent


THE BAD:

-my steak was DISGUSTING... 18 oz ribeye was super thin (like chicken parm thin)... it was all grizzle and looked like it had been breaded and sautéed like a porkchop... I have never seen a piece of beef look this way in my life... needless to say, I sent it back (never heard from a chef or a manager, and the place was dead)

-the wedge salad was not nearly as good as we've had at Twin Creeks in the past

-the grilled asparagus was too wet (I am assuming with too much olive oil)


THE TERRIBLE:

-the bartender who served us was not very polite or kind... she tried to be helpful, but often came across argumentative and condescending (not only to us, but also to her co-workers)... when ordering my steak, I requested a thick cut. instead of being helpful and noting 'thick cut' on the ticket, she said there's nothing she can do about it... this is the first steakhouse I have been to where I was told they would not look for a thicker cut... next, after being served a thin, grizzled, wet, porkchop skillet looking piece of meat, rather than resolve my dissatisfaction, she tried justifying what I was served; this, while also being condescending by lecturing me on steaks (hello, I eat out nearly every day... I have been to nearly every steakhouse in Las Vegas and have a wife who can out cook most of the chefs in this city... I know food)... to top it off, she scolded her fellow bartender (maybe he was a bar back, but he made one of my drinks for her, which came out great) right in front of us, in a volume and tone flat unacceptable... you should never treat a coworker the way she did, and NEVER in front of customers

The place was dead, which seemed unusual for a Friday night. I wonder if they changed chefs, suppliers or something else... It would explain our terrible experience and why the place was empty.",Dg9VkLxxuN95K9__sX6zeA,1,0,2,LBUhV50MVhReDQm1dVzfkQ

We dined in the lounge because we wanted to participate in happy hour (6-8 PM, tuesday - saturday!), and the restaurant was fully booked that evening. Service was spotty during happy hour (your waiter is the bartender), but improved substantially after the happy hour people cleared out around 8:30 PM. 

Happy hour includes 1/2 price specialty cocktail (nice mix of martinis and even hot beverages - can you say hot toddy?!) and also includes 1/2 price tapas! We were interested to try the bacon wrapped dates (a steal at $3.50 during HH), but sadly they were already sold out for the evening. They had some interesting offerings (chorizo fondue, etc), and all were under $10 (under $5 during HH) if memory serves. Will definitely have to go back to try those tapas!

We tried 2 specialty cocktails - a blackberry muddled martini and a dragon eye (lychee) drink. Both were REALLY well made, abundant with fresh fruit, and potent. Well balanced and strong is how I like my drinks and they delivered here!

The main draw here is the ""classics"" menu in which you choose a well price entree and get 2 sides and a salad included. Based on our cravings, we ended up with 
*2 lobster tails from the classics menu ($50, one tail was $31, FYI), served with a salad, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes
*12 oz filet mignon, a la carte ($27) served with creamed corn ($7)

The lobster was actually REALLY good. I hate rubbery gross lobster, but this passed the test. Soft, perfect texture. No weird flavor. YUM. 

The steak on the other hand was just ok. For the price it was outstanding, but haven just eaten at Hanks last week the memory of a nice pricey steak was still too fresh in my mind. I'd get steak here again, but I'd try another cut next time. I'd put the steak way better than Outback, but definitely not in the ""top tier"" steak range (Hanks, Cut, Carnevino, Strip Steak, etc, etc), but for half the price it's an INSANE value!!!

Sides were really awesome. Fabulous mac and cheese and the creamed corn was loaded with bacon - YUM. I hate creamed corn but I couldn't stop eating the bacon loaded version ! Like everything in life - bacon always makes it better! The salad was pretty eh, but then I hate onions and it was onion-y. Bread basket was delish (pretzel bread, parkerhouse!!), but would have been better served warm.

We had 2 glasses of great wine, and the bartender was kind enough to make recommendations for our next visit and even pour us some sample glasses of things he likes! 

Our total with 2 lobsters, 12 oz filet, 2 martinis, 2 wines, 3 sides, 1 salad, was $120! Not a ""cheap"" dinner, but cheap compared to nearly every other nice steak house in town.

Lobster Bisque:
This was the best part of the meal. There were chunks of lobster at the bottom. April had some shells in hers. 3/5

Grilled Filet Mignon:
Came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I always get mine done medium-rare. I got a super dead cow that burned in hell. It was tender but was way overcooked. Everyone at our table who got the filet said the same thing. 2/5

Creme Brûlée:
Nothing to write home about. The consistency was a bit runny and they don't use real vanilla. 2/5

Strawberry Shortcake (cocktail menu for $10):
Pineapple vodka, vanilla vodka, amaretto, creme de coco, fresh muddled strawberries. Good drink that tasted like dessert. 4/5

Not sure if this is the right venue to voice my one yelp gripe but I strongly dislike that the mobile yelp app lists the LEAST current photos first. There were over 300 photos for TC and when I saw the blood orange martini (pic 3 or 4) I tried to order it but alas.....not available for quite some time. Like the picture of the calamari? Sorry Charlie - it's not on the menu anymore. Lobster Ravoli? Thing of the past. 

I apologize to my fellow friendly Yelpers, but my husband FORBADE me from taking photos during the fancy dinner. I really should have taken a photo of the new menu but I couldn't :(

I had the 8 oz filet mignon, hubs had the brick chicken with mac and cheese, we shared the creamed spinach, and I enjoyed a bowl of lobster bisque before my meal.

The lobster bisque did not skimp on delicious chunks of maine lobster. It was just the right amount. Did I want to slurp the bowl? Yes! Did I ? Nope. My creamed spinach was the perfect side to my filet mignon.  I enjoyed it with almost every bite of my steak. They give you a   hearty serving of sides - I would say enough for 4 people - so beware of over-ordering.
The only gripe of my meal was that the plate that the main course was on--- SUPER DUPER HOT!!!! while that may sound strange, it was really really hot and I would think that wouldn't be the usual for a 30 dollar plate. But anywho what was on that burning hot plate sure was yummy! My hubby devoured the brick chicken and could not stop raving about the mac and cheese.

Since I couldn't get the blood orange martini I settled for a cosmo and a blueberry martini. Pretty good.

The decor was super romantic. The back brick wall had lights that changed colors every few minutes. We sat at a high table, but we looked with envy at the people who sat at the C-shaped booths at the opposite side of the restaurant.

We left around 8:15pm or so and their bar area was filled with happy hour patrons. We definitely want to check that out in the future. Also, for whatever reason, there was a couple in front of us when we first came in that were in cut-off jeans & tank tops. They were upset that the hostess wouldn't seat them in the restaurant area but offered a table by the bar. So if didn't know that you couldn't wear cut-off tank tops to this establishment- now you do! my husband had jeans and sneakers on so the dress code isn't that strict.

All and all it was a great birthday dinner - the bill was a little over 100 for the both of us so it didn't break the bank.

       - $29 18oz Bourbon BBQ Bone-In Rib Eye - Not as good or tender as the prime rib. They use a dry rub and I don't really like that type of seasoning (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA?select=ogAIIHjHqY-mQJo2PbyCJA).
       - Sides - You only get three stalks of asparagus. The brocollini was about the same. The mac and cheese had bread crusting on top but seemed a little bland. The mash was good though.
       - Artisan Breads - You get a cheesy cracker, pretzel bread, a bread with chocolate chips baked in, and some other bread. The chocolate bread goes on my top five carbs list. I ate the two they had in a bowl and when offered more, ate another four. It's that good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA?select=Vh_0zlQ0fcZO1iSghObCWg).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a fancy steakhouse experience without the fancy steakhouse price.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,1,5,jRdvSUC3TUC2oMXjJqd5Iw

The dimly lit individual booths allowed for conversation without shouting and the service was very good!  Since it was a Sunday, my father-in-law and I had the 16 ounce Prime Rib Special and my wife had the Petite Filet.  The Petite Filet was cooked to perfection and required a fork to cut it!  The Prime Ribs were cooked to both of our likings and were a great cut!  I would've preferred a little more cracked pepper crusting on the outside of the meat, but it was still tender and juicy and delicious.  My father-in-laws cut came with the bone.  I have never seen this before but he said that his was cooked exactly how he likes it.  We each had a salad and I got the wedge salad which was very good and plenty of items on it where as my wife and her dad had the house salads and thought they were delicious as well.  I also had a side of grilled asparagus and it was delicious as well with a little butter.  My wife had the brussel sprouts and her dad had the mushrooms.

This is a great place for special events. The environment is cozy and romantic, but does not require a strict dress code. You can easily come here with your family in jeans or dress up to impress a date.

Now for the good stuff, the food. The seafood appetizers are amazing. The scallops were cooked perfectly, seared golden on the outside, but remaining tender and moist on the inside. The cocktail shrimp are large and juicy. My favorite was the ahi. They had offered two tuna dishes that night, if you are confronted with choosing between them, go for the starter. The entree was not memorable at all. The salad with the vinaigrette dressing made me finish my plate quickly and steal bites from my friend's. I had ordered the bourbon BBQ bone in t-bone, cooked medium rare with brocolini and asparagus. The steak, cooked to perfection with a charred crust and large. The vegetables were crisp and flavorful.

Our large group was seated in a more private area. Our waiter did a good job with dealing with us.
I chose to skip a sugary drink from their cocktail menu and opted for a whiskey and soda, I had no complaints.
So my RW menu was 3 courses from a pre fixe menu for $40.13. I started with the Lobster Bisque which was pretty good, had big chunks of lobster, but I also got a few shells.
For the entree I chose the Halibut. It was really dry, it came with a tasty sauce but not enough to moisten my fish. Their mashed potatoes were and broccoli were perfect though. 
Lastly, for dessert I ordered the Creme Brûlée (which is one of my favorite desserts). It was okay, some sections of my hardened sugar top tasted odd though and after allowing my husband to sample it, he was able to deduce that it was the butane from the torch.

5550177,2011-03-15,0,jCR-xC4NqoEajjmstqX8sA,"A few months ago, husband and I decided to try Twin Creeks for dinner based on Yelp recommendations, and the fact that we did not feel like driving very far.  This review is based on that dinner experience, and I did not have any drinks except a glass of wine with dinner.  

This was the first time I had ever stepped in the Silverton Casino, let also Twin Creeks, and I was surprised at how nice it was.  The restaurant itself was pretty crowded, and I found the decor pleasant.

As others have said, the prices are pretty cheap.  But, there are many other steakhouses in town that aren't that much more expensive than Twin Creeks, with insanely better food.  Vic and Anthony's at the Golden Nugget and Mon Ami Gabi are both good examples of this.

My husband had the New York strip, and while he thought it was cooked well, the flavor was just okay for him.  I agreed, but I am not a fan of New York cuts of steak.  I wanted to try the surf and turf, or the fillet and lobster, which they had for a really cheap price of $50 with sides and salad.  The salad was a fairly basic side salad, and the sides were forgettable.  I ordered Mac and Cheese for my husband, which was very dry.  He didn't like it at all.  I had the sauteed broccolini which I found a bit too greasy. The fillet itself was probably one of the worst tasting cuts of meat I have had in town, and I am normally a huge fan of fillets due to the tenderness.  While it was adequately tender and executed correctly, it just tasted such low quality that I found it inedible.

The star of the night, however, was the lobster, and I would come here again just for this.  It makes me believe that maybe I should sample some of the other seafood dishes here eventually.  With so many places in town serving the same thing, I am not sure if that will be anytime soon.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,1,3,aDSnUip5X-zx1CGCZp2WNg

I was here three times in a week.. what does that tell you? (Wait, don't answer that!)

The first time it was three of us. We ordered - quite literally - everything on the tapas menu, including one of the Prime Rib slider off-menu specials and 2 of the lobster specials. 

Rather than talk about all the amazing parts, I can easily sum up and say it was all fantastic but for two things: the artichoke toasts are bland and the tomato bisque fondue kinda falls flat. Otherwise, eat up! The grilled lobster special and the sliders were, by far, the ""here, try this, OMG, ishshogood!"" standouts. (PS - Firefly's dates are superior, but that doesn't make the dish at Twin Creeks any less delicious!)

The wine list is decent (and the house wine is Concannon - that's a good place to start) and the speciality cocktail list has something for everyone. Piggyback all this onto a full steakhouse menu and full bar (if you so desire...) and you have a full blown, tummy-happiness experience.

We had 10 drinks between the three of us, plus the entire menu and 3 additional specials (including that AMAZING lobster)... for less than $80. Not each. Total. Yeah, that.

The second visit was just me and a girlfriend. Two drinks each, the sliders (yay for the repeated special, the prime rib and horseradish are so tasty!), a steak skewer, and the mushrooms. Perfect service, perfect food. $40 including a 20% tip. Total. When can I move in?

The third visit was the most epic. A party of 20+ once we were all counted up. Food was flying, drinks were flowing, and the place was hopping. We had the two large tables in the lounge packed with people and presents and tapas and cocktails all night! The lobster special this time (yay for more lobster!) was either 4 claws and accompaniments or 4 claws, 2 tails and accompaniments ($20 or $40, respectively, BEFORE the discount). Of course we went for the big boy all night. Proof that these guys know how to treat a lobster, it was, again, perfectly cooked. The mustard sauce? Meh, but the meat itself was amazing and the horseradish and cocktail sauce was great!

The bill? A modest $600 or so... after tip. Yeah. Party on, Wayne. Party on, Garth. Game freakin' on.

So why only 4 stars? The service can be a bit slow. At one point before the large party really got going, one of the waiters said it was because there was only 4 or 5 of us so far. The problem I had with this, I said to him, is that we ordered right away and would have kept ordering... had the service been there and someone asked us what we needed. Credit can be given, however, and I will point out that once we were a raucous bunch of drunken hellions running up that tab, we were treated pretty damn well. 

Still, it shouldn't take a large party and a large tab to get that kind of service. The first night, with only 3 of us was slow as well. There's just a bit of a disconnect between the expedience and the fab food and drinks.

So, 4 out of 5, with hopes that these fab experiences just keep getting better.

FYI - drinkie friends: 

(sweet) The Dreamsicle is a fantastic, orange-cream dessert in a martini glass that defies logic (where is the alcohol? you will wonder) without being cloying and over-sugared. 

(savory) Ask for a martini so dirty it's kinky - *my* fave martini anywhere - and you will be ecstatically and olive-ly happy with the balance. Not too salty and briney even calling it out that dirty, but perfectly composed. #martiniWIN

(not so great) The kumquat thing was just.... well, it tasted like flat 7-up loaded with real fruit (visible!) but no fruit taste. Bummer. No go.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,2,4,Scv7uk3z7MqcgAC0yeqZXQ

A cheesy and seemingly bottomless Seven Onion Soup with wonderful Gruyere Cheese was as great as ever.  And, a tangy Spinach Salad with thinly sliced Red Onion was very good, although I had to put on my own cracked pepper.  

A choice grade, medium rare, grilled 6 oz. Angus Filet was tender and excellent tasting,  enhanced by both Demi-Glace and Béarnaise Sauces.  The steak was accompanied by really smooth Potato Puree and al dente broccoli which unfortunately was not very hot.
