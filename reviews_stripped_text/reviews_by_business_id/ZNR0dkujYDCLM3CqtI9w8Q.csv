They have a lot of other items to choose from, like ribs and nuggets.  If you like Louisiana Fried Chicken, then this is your place.  Their chicken has crispy skin and a juicy inside.  Yum!",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,3,GIIKIl-d3khXxppR4h-ovg

It's kinda hidden in the back but they have a street sign to catch your eye.

It's a small take-out place. there is 3-4 tables but NO TV or music or any reason to really hang out & eat. They have menus everywhere with all kinds of specials.

Obviously the special that caught my eye was the 5 item for $5!!! Piece of Chicken(leg or wing)-Fish(catfish or snapper) & Rib(beef or pork) plus Fries and a drink!!! 

THE FOOD:

The Chicken was Great-well seasoned,crispy not real greasy and real meaty!!
The fish was good, it had a nice cornmeal breading seasoned well and the fish was fresh & tasty BUT its hard to please me when it comes to CATFISH.
The Ribs were WEAK-kinda dry & tough TONS of sauce(which was good) but no smoke flavor. NOT my kinda rib
FRIES were fries kinda salty but good.

OVERALL: great prices,great chicken, good fish, skip the Ribs. Give it a try-GREAT PRICES!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,6,5,3,QjVtzYNZeAY6Vulv6UYVqw

Moreover, the staff is friendly and polite, making you comfortable while waiting for take-out to be prepared. Best wishes for success in your new location.",oVRLlrG37sYRZlo_NgF3_A,0,0,4,woQLVOkZeC66uNz0tVZ44w
