If you spent the day in the mall than the location would be convenient, but we came here from off of the strip, and it felt far away. The walk was not too bad, but the atmosphere is so quiet in a place where action is desirable. There was a Fat Tuesdays daiquiri bar nearby, so maybe that would provide more of a Vegas atmosphere in the evening. 

To order, the menu has a variety of sandwiches with chips, or, interesting teriyaki bowls. The chicken teriyaki bowl with grilled vegetables was filling and tasted good. However, it is a long wait for the food, a very long wait. 

Overall, if you're looking for an inexpensive, healthy meal, this is a good place on the strip. But, it is faraway and quiet.",76y4aMBY0lT6zfJLy2EH-Q,1,0,2,mJG87SK8BoR1VaklKarmHA

We bought the groupon now deal where you get the yard drink for $12 instead of the usual $17.  the only reason i wouldn't give it a 5 star is that in the picture they show the hard which looks like the similar ones at fat tuesday etc, but when you use the groupon, you get a giant plastic beer bottle cup instead.  not that i mind as i think it is a little cooler, but it is slightly smaller so you get slightly less drink than the groupon advertises.  other than that, nothing but good things to say about the lady who helped us, and how the drinks tasted.  she let our whole group try each of the flavors before we picked what we wanted, and did a good job describing what was in each drink.  i ended up getting the moonshine as i am about getting the strongest drink offered at least once.  my friends got a mix of the other drinks and we were all happy.  i will say though, i didn't really notice myself getting anything more than slightly buzzed off the drink (its about 40 ounces), but i used the cup to make a big cherry pepsi (pepsi with cherry skky vodka) when we got back to the room which seemed to get me drunk, and it was a good container to carry the drink around with when we went out.

By the way, they also sell different types of novelty drink cups like the yard long mugs and the guitar shaped containers ($35- yikes).

We ordered the chicken fingers, which came with a side of homemade potato chips. They were delicious! We noticed there was a small side bar of different types of sauces. The only con was that it took a little bit too long to get our food.

First of all, we weren't expecting a fast food place in a Mall. I'm not sure how I missed this when reading the Yelp reviews. Mind you, I don't mind eating in fast food places or in the Mall, if the food is decent.

My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla and french fries and I ordered a burrito with chicken. Both of us found it difficult to finish what we ordered. The french fries had a distinct odor of curry and the rice in my burrito tasted like it had saffron in it. This was like no Mexican food we ever tasted!

The food was inexpensive and with the Restaurant.com certificate, it was pretty cheap. I guess in this situation, we got what we paid for. :-(

However, paying full price for what you get, I didn't enjoy it THAT much, which was the case tonight.  Price is about the only thing that keeps this place from getting 5 stars.

My girlfriend and I were attended a show at the Krave Nightclub called Fashionistas.  Since there is no food served there we had to venture into the Miracle Mile Shops.  There are many places to eat but we chose Tacone Flavor Grill because of my recommendation.

The choices are plentiful from wraps to sandwiches, soups and salads.  Many have pointed out the sauce bar where you can choose from different flavorful sauces to compliment your meal.  She ordered a grilled chicken wrap, I believe, while I went fairly simple with an Angus Cheeseburger.  Not just a cheeseburger but a sandwich burger that was absolutely juicy and melted in my mouth.  I cannot speak for anyone but myself, but I do believe both of us enjoyed the food.

The price of two sandwiches was around $20.00.  This is what I meant by price knocking off a point.  I could find 20 other restaurants on here that don't charge that much that are just as good.  However, adding a $10 off $20 purchase coupon to the mix and this place cannot be missed.  Check www.restaurant.com for discounts.",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,1,0,4,LC9LQNLYaAhgYN7lnbvbfw

For my first visit to Fresh Grill, I had the buffalo chicken wrap, which may have not been the best idea for a hot day in Vegas. I normally find buffalo sauce to be not spicy enough for me, but the sauce they used here definitely was. I had to keep adding extra ranch dressing to cool my burning mouth.

On my second visit, my friend and I shared the honey mustard chicken wrap, which my tongue thanked me for. 

I love all the different sauces and dippers they provide here. My friends and I tried almost all of them: who knew that Italian dressing tasted so good with seasoned fries?

The wraps are huge: we all took home half of our meals and ate it for dinner later; the second time, we were smart enough to share our orders. The homemade chips are pretty good, but they are inconsistent with how much each order gets.

You don't have too many choices, my friend...but here's one option that will keep you from starving.

They offer a grilled veggie salad, a grilled veggie sandwich, and a grilled veggie wrap. I ordered the grilled veg. salad and had them leave off the mozzarella. What was left was: spinach, carrots, grilled zucchini, grilled Italian squash, tomatoes, and sesame seeds. I added the cilantro lime dressing, which has no dairy.
It was pretty good and filling, with a nice zing to the dressing.
I can't vouch for the vegan-ness of the bread used in the sandwich or the tortilla used in the wrap, but those might be options as well.

The Fresh Grill & Bar is located about half of the way around the giant circle of the mall if you start at Planet Hollywood.

The wraps were huge, I could not finish and had mine doggy bagged. I had the Thai cone, the peanut sauce with the cucumber salad tucked inside the wrap with soft steaming jasmine rice was superb!

Don't do it.

If that didn't help let me explain:

1. Buy Groupon deal for the Yard Slushy at Fresh Grill & Bar, 2 for $22 
2. We get our drinks and it's absolutely disgusting. I think it's somewhere between 30-40 oz for the yard and it's 95% sugar water and 5% liquor that doesn't/didn't mix well. 
3. Take two sips and throw it away. Immediate buyer's regret. 
4. Went to Fat Tuesday and got the Spiked Lemonade and enjoyed the rest of my day.

Honestly you can dress it up and put make up on it but it's not going to walk the runway.

My boyfriend and I bought a Groupon Now deal for a one yard drink at Fresh Grill and Bar for $12. We decided to get the drink a couple hours before seeing Barry Manilow at Paris next door, so we could be slightly buzzed. When we got to Fresh Grill, we went to look at the drink selections before getting in line. I remember seeing Pina Colada, Happy Ending, Moonshine, and one other drink (probably a Daiquiri). We were debating between Moonshine and Happy ending when one of the ladies just handed us a sample of each of them. It took me by surprise that she did that because we didn't even ask for a sample, let alone of Moonshine and Happy Ending. I'd say it's pretty genuine customer service when the employees are that aware of what's going on around them and do things to please customers without having to be asked. 

I personally liked the Happy Ending, but my boyfriend liked Moonshine, so we compromised and got a mix of both with a double shot of vodka added into the mix. Our total ended up being a little over $15 for a yard drink with a double shot in a pretty snazzy giant beer bottle. We didn't even notice they had two options for a yard sized drink. The other option was a giant cup, but we opted for the beer bottle because it had a lid with a coin slot that you can use when you're all done getting crunk. It also has a handle, so you don't have to worry about melting the icy drink with your hands. The drink was pretty tasty; we ended up finishing the whole yard within an hour or so and got a nice buzz going for the show.

To be honest, I always find these drinks to be pretty pricey, but with the Groupon, it's an awesome deal. I think you save about 29% or something, which is savings you could use on extra shots!

My wrap was loaded with fresh turkey, and guacamole! Good stuff. The slaw was good too, with big shreds of fresh cabbage. What really added to the meal were the homemade potato chips. You don't get that kind of stuff from any old food court joint.

They don't offer the variety you'll find at other daiquiri bars (only four flavors), but their prices are a good $2-$4 less. And in such an expensive city, this certainly counts for something. To lessen the girliness of your daiquiri, you can add extra shots at $1.25 each as well. Make it a ""Man Daiquiri"" as my friend calls it. 

I opted for a Strawberry + Pina Colada one in the smallest size (11 oz I think) and it was only around $11. It was on the lighter side in terms of alcohol content though, so if your tolerance is high and you want a buzz, I'd suggest adding in extra shots. Other than that, it was a delicious way to keep myself occupied while we wandered around the Miracle Miles Shops at PH.

Cold sandwiches like a club sandwich. Chicken wraps, and healthy plates like their chicken breast plate with mixed veggies. You can also pick one side with most dishes, and I picked the sweet potato fries which were also good as well.

I had purchased the Groupon deal for 2 yard drinks earlier in the day ($21 for 2) and decided that now was as good a time to get drunk as...well all the time in Vegas.

1) The drinks were not strong. It was basically drinking peach slushy. I know they're probably trying to get you to purchase an extra shot, but I didn't want it.

2) Rude. Holy cow. The cashier was impatient and rude as all hell. I don't know why, as there were no lines. Was I disturbing her chat time with her coworker? I don't careeeeeeee.

3) They overcharged me by almost $10. This was on top of the Groupon. When I pointed that out to her, she just shrugged and said they already made the drinks for me. So what?! Ugh. FINE. At $32 for 2 it's still cheaper than buying at full price. I'm in Vegas to have a good time, not to deal with some idiot who can't do math or punch in correct totals on the cash register.

My order came and it was surprisingly good. They have a condiment flavor bar that offered various sauces from smoked bbq, ranch dressing, honey mustard, salsa, ketchup, house dressing, etc.. pretty much anything you might need to spice up your wrap or sandwich. I was looking through their menu and noticed that they also offer quesadillas, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, and mixed alcoholic drinks and beer. I was tempted to get a margarita, but I was on my way to a business meeting and decided to just skip the spirits for now and make it up later on that night.

My son works at Starbucks, and apparently they require their employees to wash their hands up to the elbows for 25 seconds, and they still  must wear gloves.  Moreover, Starbucks employees do not cook, and handle mostly packaged food.  Obviously I returned to the counter and informed the cashier that the food preparer was handling food with bare hands, that I do not consume food handled in an unsanitary way,  and that I would need my money returned. She offered that, ¨she )the food preparer) washes her hands.¨  For the récord  it is not acceptable to handle food with bare hands, period.  And of course hands should be washed thoroughly prior to handling food, but how many times do people go to the bathroom without exercising appropriate care, or touch their face, rub their nose, or touch unssanitry surfaces thoughtlessly.... trust me, demand that your food preparers cover up.

As an employee working inside the Miracle Mile Shops for the last two years, I have eaten here countless times. But my recent trip on my lunch break to grab a quick bite to eat had me very frustrated and utterly upset. 

I have been in the food industry before and I completely understand the struggles of working in such a fast paced environment like the Strip, but always as customer service 101 teaches you. No matter what, do what you can, whatever you can to make your customers stay at your restaurant enjoyable. It is just not worth making a customer upset enough to write a review on the customer service they recieved.

I had called in advance to order Chicken fingers and sweet potato fries. But when I got there I noticed that my takeout container had an extra brown bag over it. My server was Ada and she explained that the cooks had made a mistake and made my order with the wrong fries, so they just added my sweet potato fries in the bag. I thought that was strange but I paid for my food. I opened up the packaging and saw a bunch of regular shoestring fries with my chicken fingers (just like Ada said) but when I looked into the brown bag where my sweet potato fries were - there were only a couple of fries in the bottom of the bag. I was upset and I asked the cashier that my order was done wrong and there are only a couple of the fries  that I ordered in this bag.  I explained to her that since it was their mistake can she just comp an order of sweet potato fries for me for the next time I come back to eat, or give me more of what I ordered and paid for.  She turned to Ada explained and Ada came to me and said - ""you only get a small portion."" I was in no mood to explain that the wrong fries were stacked in my takeout container and they only gave me scraps of what i really ordered on the side.  I told Ada that i just want what I ordered, she then asks, ""do you want me to throw this away?"" I was shocked by how rude she was being when THEY got MY order WRONG! I wish it ended there,  but once I sat down at their location to eat the food, their manager came from around the back and was staring me down.  

I am extremely upset and will never eat there again.  Most of my coworkers always warned me about this place,  but now I know that I should've taken their advice.

My friend got the BBQ Chicken Wings. My wrap had chunks of avocado, which wins big bucks in my book. I love avocado especially if it's integrated nicely into a dish. It makes me very happy. It was quite a portion actually. One of my concerns was that it was quite greasy. But I guess I can't expect a lot from fast food. I wasn't aware that there was going to be a side of chips (which I believe were deep fried, hand cut potatoes). If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the side of chips and salsa. No biggie on those, just chips and salsa. 

The wings were also just ordinary. It wasn't bad but it wasn't to die for either. 

I like the nice island in the middle of the store that held all the dips and sauces. I thought that was pretty cool. There was a nice variety that patrons can enjoy.

Perhaps my favorite part about this store was the line up that leads to the alcoholic drink orders (there was a line for non alcoholic orders and a line for alcoholic orders). They have these really tall plastic containers that held slushie drinks. I got the smallest one, which was a half yard long slushie drink, (double shot of course) named Happy Ending. I loved it so much I came back for seconds. Really great for those days when you walk down the strip and its 35 degrees hot out. 

Oh and if you save your drink container and bring it next time to get your drink, it's cheaper. Some people actually brought theirs back. I should have, but seeing as I was drunk for virtually the entire trip, I don't remember where I put my first container so I just got another one.

Would I come back? Probably for the food. Definitely yes for the drink. Me wants me Happy Ending.",oHhrlIDb8YapzCVERNwqvA,1,0,3,rkQ9UncEBln4syS87_dPFA

Our group purchased the Groupon deal for $13 for a longyad.
We got a 40 oz. beer bottle-shaped longyard.
Before we purchased the drinks to put in our longyards we got to sample all the drinks they had to offer. My two favorite was the Strawberry & Happy Ending which was like a sweet tea lemonade. But we decided to just have strawberry which was pretty yummy. 

I will say that their claim of there being 4 & a half shots in each yard is BS. We bought an extra shot just incase & good thing we did cause that thing didn't have any kick at all.. oi.. I shared with one other person & didn't even feel a slight buzz. LAME! Needless to say we didn't get a refill because it just made us bloated with liquid & no buzz. =[ 

PLUS! The beer bottle yard can be used as a piggy bank too! [=

Oh! If you ""like"" their fb page you get a FREE order of sweet potato fries, I think hm?",y975lu1oBjpW47TT1QdFHQ,4,3,4,jE58Q-A4J0LpTOaxOMgE9Q

First meal in Vegas, this restaurant has the prime location because it is right next to the PH parking structure (which is MILES away from the casino portion of the hotel). We were intrigued by all the different sandwich/salad selection they had and the ""free samples"" offering for their alcoholic slushie drinks. 

We got the Chicken Club to share, which came with an order of chips. I liked that they had all sorts of dipping sauce/dressing for the chips/salad, but we mostly needed it for the super bland sandwich, which cost $9!!! This place reminds me of Tacone! And there wasn't that many people there, but the wait was pretty long for our sandwich. 

Sooooooooo many other places to eat, go to Earl's!",XYWjjklyITIAEBgnZtU-Mw,2,0,2,X8DOPd_qS0nFURRgfvjYDw

I purchased a couple of Groupon deals before coming here, something silly like 20 bucks for 2 drinks. If only I had known how sweet the drinks actually were I would have only got one of the deals as we ended up not using the 2nd. Oh well.

Set up: Casual bar with the usual fried food and vast array of alcoholic drinks.
With the ''Yard longs'' you pick your cup, then your flavor and any additional Alcohol shots if you want them. The drinks are already pre made in a slushy machine, I kinda wish I had got an extra shot as I couldn't taste what was in there and it might have toned down the sweetness of it all.
Service was fine and the drinks were ok but way too much for both myself and my Husband as neither of us drank more than half of it. 

Will I ever return to use that other Groupon on another trip? Probably not.",wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA,12,10,3,iKlxXyhKu5LPkPnkVgr4rg

You would think that an establishment with the word ""Fresh"" in the name would know how to make a decent salad.  Sorry but I'm adding this to the list of places to NOT eat at this mall.",xMSDosWZGitXSmCty779Ow,2,0,1,XZ3v5bZb9k1zdTO0CMHbfA
