In my initial review I was sad for the poor starving children and the wastefulness of the portions you serve.  I've now learned ""how"" to order off of your menu so I don't leave feeling less like a human because of my gluttonous ways.  Your bloody Mary's are amazing, but the Medium gave me enough kick without adding the habanero.  Half medium half mild suits my tastes (even though I always thought I could handle a kick).

We love everything your restaurant has to offer for a quick bite after a long day wrangling cats (I mean kids), from the brunch menu (huevos nachos LOVE...but share), fajitas, mahi mahi tacos, ceviche, chips and salsa...oh and yes my margarita is always amazing.",UjaFrJyZh9b-NtWzW-luGQ,5,1,4,sZvYVmcrCm1aYEI70sSnUQ

We have 2 small kids and were hard to miss, so we assumed the young staff does not like kids...(less drink sales?)
Second time we got seated and the host and waiter both left me standing in the middle of the room with a baby waiting for a high chair...they went over to other tables and totally forgot about us....while Im standing and looking right at them!

Our Server Amy was friendly and attentive.  We started with a couple of $3 beers, some special they were doing, must have been with the football on Sunday night.  She then brought us two little jalapeno cornbread muffins.  That was nice.

I had the Traditional Nachos and GF had a fajita salad.  The nachos were piled quite high and I did like the continued layering of toppings, nothing's worse than getting down to a pile of chips with nothing on them.  BUT they just weren't mind blowing, I guess I figured that if I ordered the namesake dish that these nachos would be da bomb...not quite.  GF's salad tasted like a salad, dressing was good.

Mayor Hafen's Macho Nacho which has worms, scorpions, and crickets in it.  Those nachos were something to experience!  When taking a bite out of the macho nacho I could feel the insects crushing and oozing in between my teeth.  I'm not sure if I gagged from the insects or from the layers of cheese mixed with it.  Try it if you're adventurous.  I got the t-shirt for eating it!

While they do specialize in nachos, I've tried their other bar food such as the chicken wings which were of good size and flavor.  The quesadillas were delicious, but nothing special that I couldn't find somewhere else.

When I went back for lunch last Thursday, I did try Mexi-chicken sandwich with their ranch seasoned fries on their lunch menu that was delicious.  The chicken was seasoned just right and juicy.  It was filling.

Megan our waitress was on it. A smile, an occasional friendly wink and someone who knows her menu! I asked about vegetarian options and she had it covered! She knew what was in everything and gave me many options beyond a few tortilla chips with some guacamole.  Green sauce safe - red sauce off limits, black beans -ok, pinto beans - in the green. Megan even offered a rice alternative that was not made with stock.  

Tofu tacos?? What Mex joint even knows what tofu is?? Big Daddy Mike in the kitchen does and knows it well! I left it to Megan to bring her best veggie meal out and left it up to her. 

Tofu fajitas!?!?!?  Wow full of flavor, taste , texture - seasoned great and a portion built for 2! Big daddy Mike ( I don't think I'd ask for him by that) came out for a tofu follow up. Told him it was great and I was pleasantly shocked at how good it was. This stuff needs to be on the menu!

This last time I went with my family, all adults.  I arrived first and was seated promptly. Where i was seated smelled like an old babies diaper. Soon my wife arrived, she immediately complained that it was too hot in the restaurant.  It appeared that the air conditioning was not working properly.  So I decided to go to the outside patio. It was definitely cooler than inside. But as we walked out there I noticed that floor looked dirty and greasy plus some of the decorative vases had not been dusted for months. Our waiter Jose was pleasant enough but he neglected to give us utensils and napkins.  I ordered a bottled beer and a glass.  The glass was so dirty it was disgusting. I sent him for a clean one.  Of course he took so long i finished the beer by just drinking out of the bottle before he came back.  As for the food we had an appetizer of the Homemade Queso Cheese it was bland nothing to write home about.  Once the cheese started to cool it became like rubber. I had a chicken enchilada ala carte. It was very very average, the red sauce on top had no flavor.  My son ordered street tacos he said they were nothing special.  The wife had a large chicken salad which was a plus sized portion, but again no taste.  When the bill came I was shocked as to how expensive it was.  I felt raped and disgusted that I had just thrown my money away.   The only reason that I am giving this restaurant 1 star is because there is nothing lower.  Such a waste of my hard earned money.

The second time there I had the buffalo chicken nachos, they were also very tasty and saucy.

Both times we were offered jalapeno cornbread muffins. They were pretty good, and I really liked the fact that they were moist like cornbread should be. The jalapenos weren't overpowering and added a little extra something that was unique.

The staff was great, very nice and very helpful.

I read other reviews before I was there, and I must say some people don't know what they're talking about. I'm from out of state and I thought this place was great!

I must admit my disappointment when we arrived. On the ""up"" side: We were seated immediately and our server was right behind the host for our drink order and menus. On the ""down"" side: Our server never made mention of any specials and the standard chips with salsa was an additional charge!? In fact, Our server had little to say about anything and in spite of only a few tables occupied, we waited nearly 1/2 hour for our dinner.  

The time spent waiting gave me a chance to look around the dining area at the filth. Windows were dirty, tables appeared to have been wiped with dirty towels, bottles of hot sauce were spattered with their contents running down the labels. Truly, this place needs some housekeeping help. The food that took so much time to arrive was average at best. Presentation was okay but I decided the menu descriptions were slightly misleading. 

Bottom line: There are many many Mexican places to chose from in the LV Valley. You would get much better food from a mobile taqueria.  I have nothing to say that would  even slightly suggest my that friends should dine there. The food is okay, the service is crap, and the place itself feels like one of those neglected franchises that should have gone to the wayside along with Sambo's.

She asked if we wanted black beans instead since the others are made with lard. That was very kind and appreciated. The food itself was quite good - we shared a salad and nachos, sans meat, and liked the flavors of everything. The chips for the nachos did not get soggy, also a plus. Now, the less than stellar. Right toward the end, we had our credit card ready to go with the check. A male server in the next section over picked it up. He then bussed some tables with credit card folder still in hand and went in back. He then came back out with it, not processed, and handed it to another server - the wrong one. She went back with it. Then a manager came out with it for my husband's signature. We kept a close watch on the credit card hot potato game, but it wasn't the ending we had wanted.

I meet with the manager and the chef over this past weekend. They were very interested in how they can change the menu to better suit vegan customers.

The chef added Daiya cheese shreds to some dishes and a new type of vegan pattie. I made some menu suggestions (like including brand names so we don't play 20 questions LOL) He's also working on a vegan dessert menu!

First I got the BBQ Pork Nachos, and it was ehhh... it had nice presentation but the nachos were really sweet which was not really my thing. So I returned it and got another dish called Average Burger Nachos. That was ehh, the cheese was bland and the toppings were flavorless. My dad got the Mexican Street Burger filled with avocado, mangoes, onions, etc. He said it was okay too. I think the food is just a little different for us. Their choices are really unique and I've never eaten mexican food like that before plus it was a little more on the fancy side! I think this is a great place for late night eatery especially because this is a sports bar/restaurant.

Large bar area, good sized dinning room, and we were in a decent sized room off the dinning room. large flat screen TVs encompase each room.  probably be a good place to catch a game. the servers are still getting used to place, but were very nice and gracious. 

service was a bit slow, and the food also came out slow; not horribly slow, but was noticeable. i hope it's just because they are still getting through their opening jitters. 

someone ordered 4 sets of their chips and salsa ($4.95) that came with very hard chips, tomatillo salsa and chopped tomatoes with a little onion and cilantro added. the tomatillo was good but the tomato side was boring.

i had the full size Cajun Nachos (Half $10.95 / Full $15.95; Blue corn chips, Cajun blackened Louisiana mudbugs, blackened chicken, shrimp with Andouille sausage, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, red onions and garnished with fried okra and sauce remoulade). it was a pretty good entree, but would be a great appetizer for two to share.  i couldn't finish it all, but someone else in our group powered through it!  very tasty mix for nachos.

all the others in our group commented that the food was good, from the Jambalaya to the nachos to the club sandwich.

we will probably go back and look forward to faster service and quicker food.",uftVgvFArubrcsuXu7fEfg,4,2,4,794eEQK9VwIusvvyBmSKWQ

Ground beef, beans, cheeses, jalapeños, sour cream, guacamole, and avacado lime salsita. I liked the lime salsita, very good, ground beef had a good flavor, enough cheese. I did need more salsa and asked for some red instead of the lime, It was great but...they didn't tell me they charge $1 for extra salsa! That's crazy, they only give you a little container, not enough for the pile of nachos, they should not charge for more. Also, my husband asked for no salsa on his, shouldn't that count as a credit towards my extra salsa, lol! One of the better bar nachos I've had. They do serve it a mile high on a cast iron skillet, which looks cool, but I found hard to eat without it toppling over onto the table, so I asked for a plate.

We got the fajitas (well first someone nearby got the fajitas and the combination of the sizzle and the smell made me crave them beyond what is normally humanly acceptable). We got the combo chicken shrimp fajitas. I will say they were pretty good. Portion was quite large and ended up taking some home. There was sooo many peppers and onions, a lot of chicken, and a decent amount of shrimp. Only part that was on the small side was the guacamole. Taste wise, everything was good, just not over the top great. Guac didn't taste that fresh, but the chicken and shrimp were well cooked and seasoned along with the peppers and onions.

Ambiance- the game was on, but didn't really bother us in the dining area. 

Staff- out waiter was great, very attentive. On top of everything. They were about a third full in the dining area, and our guy looked like he had a few tables. But I never needed to look for him.

This is the first place I'm reviewing where I need to offer a breakdown to explain my rating.  And this is a place I really WANT TO LIKE, since it's close to home and we love finding a great mexican food place to be loyal to.  Just not feeling it, mostly due to service issues.  The food has been consistently good.

FOOD:  4 stars.  Both times the food has been 4 stars and pretty good overall. The Spicy Shrimp nachos are our favorite - but they are skimpy on the shrimp.  Today we had the Chicken Enchilada nachos - they are very good too.  

MENU:  We returned within one month because we enjoyed the happy hour food and drink specials (some of the nachos are offered for $6 and they have 2-for-$4 street tacos, among some other items).  But today when we arrived, the menu had changed and the food item we wanted was no longer on happy hour.  Bummer.  And, not cool.  I don't like changing menus - it's bait and switch.  The waitress said, ""We wanted to remove our popular items and replace them with other things so you would try different nachos.""  Hmmmm.  

Additionally, while ordering drinks from the HH menu, we asked about chips and salsa.  We aren't trying to get anything for free - but you would think with a $25 bar tab - they could provide FREE chips and salsa.  NOPE.  It's $3.  

My husband asked for a side of jalepenos for his nacho platter.  They brought a little sauce cup with about 10 little jalepenos.  Then we got the bill and they charged us $2 for them.  Not cool.  At least tell us they will be extra - but really they SHOULD BE FREE!

Here we are driving around running errands for the day and my wife kids and I wanted some mexican food. We said hey theirs that place by the house called Nacho Daddy lets go check it out. so our first time there We literately drove in the parking lot and then said hmm. This place does not look like a place to take our kids. (ages 13,11,5) Because it has the whole sports bar with food look and feel to it. So we decided to just turn away and hit up taco bell and called it a night. 

About a week goes by and its time for date night with my wife and yes. We chose Mexican food for dinner. There was no better time than the present to try out this ""sports bar that serves food"" Nacho Daddy.

Wow we were total wrong. I should have listened to my mom, ""never judge a book by its cover"" anyway, we opened the doors to paradise and we were immediately welcomed by the host and much to my surprise it was a complete sit down restaurant on one side and a sports bar on the other. We sat on the restaurant side where we were surrounded by flat screen TVs playing music videos and sports games. Pretty cool mix if you ask me. 

So as I said in the beginning you can just destroy Nachos or you can reinvent nachos just as this place has done! The menu is filled with so many different types of nachos. I did not even think it was possible to have chips and cheese taste like you just bit into a burger, or feel like your eating a delicious seafood plate. Its crazy!

Can you guess what I went with! I'm a burger and fries kinda a guy so your right. Burger Nachos. I was very selectable at first I mean come on. Hamburger flavored Nachos! Let me tell you its one of there best on the list next to the PBR Nachos. holy crap those are great!! 

Our service was great, the place was packed and I still had a full cup and was not overly bothered by the waitress coming by every couple of min. asking if everything is ok. She asked one time and then made frequent visit with a smile and refilling our drinks and making sure we had plenty of napkins. 

Back to the whole driving away and judging a book by its cover. After our date night and checking out the seen I must say that this is a great family restaurant, a great hang out spot or date night! Great food to choose from and its all in a fun and lively environment. The price is not terrible but when you think about dropping 10 bucks for a plate of nachos its a little steep but that plate is piled high!",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,2,0,4,KWwzlkEnAw4a-TCVzSR0Ug

No one come to check on us and after we had completed our meal and have nothing else to drink we literally waited another 25 minutes before we flagged someone down to ask where our server was. She said that she took a big party and couldn't get back to us. I then asked for a manager and the young lady explained that she was the supervisor on duty. So I asked for her to come over, which she did and I expressed my frustration as to why she never came to service us. And she stated that she assumed that someone else would be taking care of us.

Used to love the nachos but they're  now fairly mediocre :(.  I can't drink so have never been able to try any of the margaritas.  I've narrowed down on what I will eat there to the fajita salad simply because I love the chimichuri dressing.  But they have a tendency to load it with cotija cheese to the point you can't taste anything else.  My husband likes the chicken enchiladas, the only part of that dish I enjoy is pulling the peppers out of the salsa garnish to eat with my salad.

811383,2015-06-30,1,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"My boufriend and I go to Nacho Daddy frequently because the nachos are great and the margaritas always make us happy. Today we went to Nacho Daddy after a long day of moving from henderson to the other side of town. The waitress that helped us was okay. Not as friendly and sociable as the our favorite, but it was cool. my boyfriend ordered the Buffalo chicken nachos and I ordered the tofu nacho. We also ordered the frozen house margarita. The food was deliciousness. We both finished our plates which is normal for the boyfriend, but rare for me because I become full easy. We didn't finish all of the margarita so when it was time to pay the bill we asked our waitress for togo cups with lids so that we could enjoy our margarita at home, but to our surprise the waitress tells us no because it is illegal. Her exact words were ""no that's totally illegal"". Okay... well that is a surprise to me and my boyfriend because our other waiter and waitress allow us to take it home in togo cups with lids. Then she once again was like ""that's crazy and so illegal"" and then had the audacity to ask me who my last waiter and waitress was that allowed me to take it home like I would tell her so that she could get them in trouble?! 
So here is the deal. I know that it is illegal to drive with an open container of alcohol in my car. I am an adult and I make my own choices. My problem is for one: obviously the staff isn't on the same page so that needs to be corrected and two: if I pay $22 to $32 for a pitcher of Margarita... do not tell me that I can't take it home!! It is not your problem if I get pulled over. On top of that, the togo cups that this place gives are white with no logo on the cup or lid. 
If I were to order a bottle of wine and ask to take it home because I didnt finished it, the resaurant is allowed to re-cork the bottle and I can take it, so I should be able to do that with any alcohol I purchase. Especially if I ask for a togo cup with a lid and no straws AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD NO BEFORE!
Word of advice to the restaurant, make sure all of your staff is on the same page because if each waiter or waitress that I have had let's me take home my Margarita but one doesn't because she wants to be the legal police, you obviously have a problem and should either retrain all of the staff or fire the one that thinks she is the legal police.
Once again... I know what I am allowed to do and not do in my car... so I don't expect some random person to make my decisions for me because they think that they can.

I've had their cheese enchiladas, which were tasty. Not the biggest fan of the rice. This last time, I had their bare wings with the rub and they literally fell off the bone! I think this may be my usual in the future.

I also dipped my wings in that salsa ranch too. Don't judge me.

They were a big disappointment.  We ordered taco meat on ours, and it had more grease on the plate, than meat.  There were barely any chips on the plate - way too little food for the price.  The only bright spot were the margaritas - which were quite tasty.  The waitress was friendly, and everyone seemed to be very unsure of themselves.  It's a shame to spend big bucks to go into a location, spend big bucks to decorate and hire folks, then make a bad first impression. To the owners - don't open until you are ready.

It's kind of hard to eat without having the tower of nachos topple over and fall onto the table. I wished the skillet was oversized to accommodate fallen chips. The menu advertises these to be spicy hot. They weren't not. There was a mild sweet heat, but definitely not spicy nor hot. That was disappointing. 

Moving onto entrees, our party of three tried the carne asada big daddy burrito ($13.95), fajita cheesesteak sandwich ($10.95) and street tacos ($2.95 ea).  All was edible, though, none was notable. We felt each dish was overpriced for quality of what was presented.

Obviously, nachos are their specialty and I really liked the unique combinations you could choose from. I tried the Buffalo Chicken nachos and wow...spicy but good! May need some ranch or an icy margarita to cool off your tastebuds. Next time I go though, definitely trying the make your own nacho platter. My boyfriend got something simple - chips, chicken and cheese - plain jane but so tasty! The chicken was marinated just right and chees melted perfectly, sometimes simple is best! The platters are reasonably priced at around $10 and you get a ton of food (I couldn't finish mine!). 

The drink menu was plentiful so that's definitely on the to do list next time as well.

Wanted some great nachos and figured this would be the place to get them with a name like Nacho Daddy.  They have a lot of gimmicky nachos on the menu, but not the traditional nachos I was craving.   What I got was nothing but a watery cheese sauce with ground beef mixed in over chips.  None of that melted cheese that really makes nachos!  This was nothing but cheese dip poured over the nachos with some lettuce and tomato on top. I didn't even finish half of it.  Husband had the filet mignon burrito, he said the meat was good, but the sauce was not very good.  It looked ok, but nothing special.

We know that yelp never lets us down, so I'm not sure why we tried this terribly reviewed place.  We knew someone who went and said that it wasn't so bad.  Despite our reservations (we usually never eat at a poorly reviewed restaurant) we decided to give it a try.  The place was pretty busy on a Wednesday evening.  They were offering happy hour and $5 martinis.  I ordered the raspberry martini and it was really tasty.  However, thats where the positive ends.  They gave us corn bread muffins to snack on while we waited which were barely ok.  We ordered the barbacoa burrito and supreme nachos.  Kids had the been and cheese burrito and chicken fingers.  The barbacoa burrito was so awful, we could barely eat any of it.  The barbacoa was flavorless as was everything else they stuffed in.  The nachos were just ok.  Nothing I would ever need to go back for.  Plus, they were very expensive.  $10 for a small personal sized nacho?  $4 more to upsize it to an entree size.  The kids been and cheese burrito was pretty good, but my son couldn't even eat 2 bites of the chicken fingers.  Hubby tried a bite of them and couldn't blame our son for not eating more.

The enchiladas weren't anything special, lacking any major seasoning that would set them apart from more spectacular enchiladas like at Lindo. The Tostada Nachos left much to be desired. The three cheese blend tasted like a love child of velveeta and Kraft cheezwiz.  The ground beef was a swelling chunk of unseasoned, dried cow remains. The jalapeños tried to save the travesty, but only offered subtle jabs at the taste buds.  Oh, the corn appetizer was decent.

The Bad - As other's have pointed out, the service was very inefficient. This is by far the #1 reason we wont be going back here. We waited, and waited and waited some more.
Food - not so memorable. In their defense, their menu suggests a genuine effort to present a unique and fresh dining experience. Unfortunately, the execution is off. Our El traditional nachos were nothing special. Thin chips, average grade cheese and not so traditional spice levels. You can't call it traditional when the recipe is tamed down to cater to the average 8-year old. Our fish tacos looked delicious but one bite and my mouth was overwhelmed with the taste of onions (and possibly radish?). Note to chef - When it comes to Fish, less is more. Add too much and you run the risk of over-powering the delicate taste of fish.
2nd Margarita - As I said earlier, my 1st marg was just perfect and it set up high expectations for the night. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. My super sweet 2nd marg was undoubtedly the handiwork of Baja Bob's not-so-fresh extra-sweet premix.
Salsa and dips - Meh. I've had better salsa from a jar at Smiths (Rojo's fresh-cut salsa rocks!)

The food and drinks were just ""ok"".. None of the items ordered blew my mind..
*Ceviche - plain, lacked a little flavor, less avocado, more shrimp, pls.
*Salmon Chimichurri - comes with rice and grilled veggies.. salmon was cooked to perfection, not drenched in the chimichurri sauce with the black bean salsa.. though the veggies left a very strong, lingering garlic taste in my mouth, even after brushing my teeth, so maybe a little less garlic on the veggies.
*Mango Thai Basil and Guava Margaritas - waaaay to strong (not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing), tasted very similar, lacked the sweet flavor I was looking for, also no salt rim ¯\_(?)_/¯..

One thing my friend and I kept looking for, especially at time of seating was our chips and salsa! All the Mexican restaurants I've been to serves them.. And we noticed other tables around us getting their chips and salsa... but not us..
Was disappointed in not getting that before ordering / receiving main courses.

My husband doesn't like cilantro so our waitress out the pico de gallo on the side for me.  They no longer have two different sizes if nachos.  The one size they do offer is plenty to split between two people.  Delicious! 

We also split the fajita cheesesteak sandwich.  Absolutely wonderful with seared sirloin, onions, peppers and white Queso.  Again this was huge enough to split.  You offer sweet potato fries? Sign me up! They were perfectly crisp and soft at the same time.  Yum!

Service here is hit and miss.  When we sit in the bar area, it's not as good.  But when in the dining area, it's fantastic! Chelsea, who was our most recent waitress, was awesome! She had a fun and bubbly personality that made our visit even more wonderful.

Had a decent experience told the server we were in a hurry to the airport.  We hand him our credit card and left.  The food was actually good.  I called back and said that our bill was over charged by $10.  Our sandwiches were on the chalkboard special.  The waiter agreed, apologized, and said it would be corrected.  Few days later, my bill was changed 3.57 on my credit card.  Called back, told the manager the situation, asked that the bill be corrected once again.  He then haggled over item per item and came up the accurate  total while offering to change it, but due to his attitude over the ""few"" bucks.  I just said, "" you know what leave the bill"".  I will not be back and will not be recommending you.  This prompted my first review on Yelp, so here it is.  If a manager has no interest in maintaining a new customer, then I have no interest in saying that you will get any of my business, but two calls worth of hassle to fix a bill that they admitted was wrong to begin with.  No offer to discount the bill, come in get a free appetizer, etc.....I have thousands of choices in Las Vegas, Nacho Daddy is now not one...and like I said the food was actually good, but why go where your business is not valued.

I was really surprised when I asked the hostess if they could make something vegetarian for me and she pulled out a vegan/vegetarian menu with maybe 8-10 items listed. This makes it easy for everyone. I pick out the item on this menu, the waiters don't need to know a lot about vegan vs. vegetarian, and they simply tell the chef what I picked out. The helpings are a little too generous, but nobody ever complains about having too much food left over to take home.",tzfLwXI4L6vaxHxKxgOSgg,1,0,4,SsDH5HzcN4lqvz8S4LYShw

Both visits I ordered the Cajun Nachos which I thought were phenomenal.  The nachos come with a lot of meat, and the spicy cajun sauce is delicious.  I also really enjoyed the bottomless chips and sals.  The salsa is made with a lot of cilantro which I love.  

The staff was extremely friendly.  My 3 year old son flirted with all the waitresses and the hostess..lol  Service was pretty good overall.  They allowed us to call ahead our order and it was at our table 2 minutes after we arrived..AWESOME!!!!

The ONLY reason I did not give a 5 star is because the prices can be a little expensive.  I am used to paying around 7-8 dollars for Nachos and with my drink I ended up paying $15.  It is worth it though.  I also like the atmosphere.  They have enough TV's to watch sports, and they typically have some good music playing as well.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,1,0,4,ICS6-LUHv5PO2xcTI-y2xw

1953613,2015-04-05,3,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"Ok so since I have a lot to say about Nacho Daddy I will give you the cliff notes portion so that you don't have to read sooooo much to get to the point. To tell you what I think you need to know I am going to start off with  the important stuff. The resturant itself wasn't bad there was plenty of seating it was nice and clean and the staff were great, just prepare to sit through classic rock the whole time. Which may not be bad if you like that kind of stuff. Me, I just felt like I was in a bad movie. The food well, not to be completely mean but I could've gotten better nachos and tacos at 7-11 if they served tacos. Ok maybe they weren't that bad but when I expected this place to be the bomb dot com and it wasn't I knit pick. The pickled jalopinos and salsa tasted like they were straight from a can and the cheese tasted like Velveeta...really? Gross I could've gotten that at home. So do not order the cheese burger nachos. The steak and chicken street tacos sounded so good but when it arrived they were so flavorless, mediocre and armature with old soft flaky corn tortillas they should have been left out on the streets or just straight up kicked to the curb. The Resturant was more Tex then Mex and not in a good way. There was a good size bar but that was probably because you had to be drunk to eat the food. The price weren't bad for the amount of food you get but the food you get was not worth the price you pay. So long story short I was way stoked to try Nacho Daddy but the first impression left me with absolutely no desire to ever come back and give them a second try. I have never gone to a Resturant with such high hopes and left so disappointed which blows my mine that they have more then one location. Who eats this stuff? Now read on for the long version. 

I am rating this place a 1 star because of my personal experience. I've seen reviews where people are on the fence about how they really feel about the Resturant and the food itself and now that I've finally visited I can see why.

The advertisement and hyped for the Resturant is on point and was the main reason why I was so excited and looking forward to try Nacho Daddy. Their marketing was amazing, you hear about them all the time and see their ads everywhere and it all looks and sound so good but that is where the amazing stops. 

Pulling up to the resturant's I was pleasantly surprise to see that it was an actual Resturant and not a fast food type joint like I expected. So at this point in my mine I still had high hopes for the food that I will be ordering inside. Entering the Resturant we were immediately greeted by a very nice host girl everyone wore Nacho Daddy tshirts so that was kindda cool expect for when everything finally sunk in. I all of a sudden then felt like I was transported into a weird Chilis slash trashy Margaritaville wanna be type Resturant that was blasting old school rock. Was I in Cancun? No!

Anyhow what they did with the space was not bad I just didn't get the concept. After being seated I thought it was odd that they ask you if you would like Chips and Salsa being that you are probably going to order more chips and salsa in a nacho as a meal. But we did anyway just to try the salsa...but beware they are not free even though it sounds like it when they ask. Fortunately I checked in on Yelp to receive a free serving.
So the chips were actually good slightly thin, warm and crispy just like anywhere else the salt never sticks so we had to salt both chips and salsa. The salsa left me confuse because I was convince it was from a can but couldn't be completely sure. 

My wife and I decide to share since everything on the menu sounded good. Now I know this was a Tex Mex place but I was shocked not to see actual plain nachos on the menu. You know the kind with chips, cheese, meat, bean, sour cream and guacamole. Even though I was more curious to try the not so normal nachos I thought at least regular nachos should be offered for the ones that are not as adventurous. So that is what I did I order the not so normal cheese burger nachos because I was curious and (I guess this is where the phrase curiosity killed the cat came into reality because it was not good at all) the cheese I couldn't get pass the Velveeta tasting cheese. Eww! As for my wife's steak and chicken tacos, I'm no Bobby Flay but I could've made better tacos or at least not served them on old tortillas. You know how old corn tortillas get when you try to prolong their shelf life and heat them up? They just get soft and flake away. Well if you don't know now you know. As for the rice and beans, SMH how is this place still open? 

Anyways to wrap this up, to me I wish it was better, never the less if you've been wanting to go try it out by all means go and see how you feel about it that's only fair. I have rights to my own opinion and my opinion is this place over all missed the mark. But do go try it because some people do like it for whatever reason. I don't!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,6,2,1,EXNNDCHi-wYHw53GuqWTVg

1998401,2012-03-11,0,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"Bottom line: a good sports bar with decent bar food.

This place should be heaven for me because nachos are my desert island food, but 
it's . . . well, just decent bar food.  Good enough burgers, edible salads, frozen veggie burgers heated to order and lots of good beer. 

First, the positives: the atmosphere is great for a game night.  We came here for the Super Bowl in 2012 and it's one of better sports spots I've been to.  Loud and raucous with contests for prizes/giveaways throughout the game.  People were watching and into the game without getting obnoxious and ruining the event for others.  As for the beer list, it's pretty well stocked for American beers.  Foreign beer lovers may be a little disappointed, but most others will be satisfied by the options.   

The nachos are a little hit or miss.  It may be the tortilla chips the bar chose.  They're a little too salty.  And that's coming from a guy who will always reach for salty over sweet.  Out of all the choices, the buffalo chicken nachos are my favorite.  The buffalo sauce is great and the blue cheese topping is rich and tasty.  The chili cheese nachos are okay.  The chili just isn't tasty enough to compensate for the over-salty chip pile. 

The quality of the sandwich choices ranges from decent to mediocre.  The chicken sandwich is decent and worth an order if you're in the mood.  The veggie burgers deserve a pass--but in all fairness, it's the rare sports bar that has a good veggie burger.  The regular burgers are . . . well, good enough.

So, stick with the beer, sports, and buffalo nachos and it's a 4 star spot.  Everything else drags the place down to 3 stars.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,3,3,FdhAXHMPN0-THogtESb3ww

I was working in the area at a local school, and a co-worker mentioned this concept.  We both love Nachos so I was psyched and amazed  that someone finally came up with this idea.

I ordered a build your own nachos to go.   When I arrived to pick up the food the place was pretty barren. I sat at the bar and the bar itself was incredibly sticky and kind of gross.  

My food was suppose to be ready in 15 minutes and it took closer to 30 which surprised me.  When the food arrived it didn't look incredibly appetizing, and frankly tasted like canned rosarita beans and imitation cheese.  

I had really looked forward to trying this place and was sorely disappointed.",jSD05fFrAFa5gX3ZQae1tw,0,0,2,p2j0gFGkXhyZ_vi-FNk58g
2012551,2010-12-22,1,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I'm on the fence about this place still. It could go down to 2 stars or it could go up to 4 stars. I'm currently exercising some forgiveness since it just opened and a few kinks are pretty much inevitable.

When I walked in, I was greeted by 4 hostesses. Yep, 4. I'm assuming it was part of some kind of training. And, technically, I was really only greeted by 1 of them. The others just sorta looked on. I was asked if I wanted to sit in the bar or dining area (bar area includes high tops). I replied that the bar area was fine. The hostess then went back to the other 3 hostesses, conferred for a bit, and then led me to a high top in the bar area.

The bar and dining areas aren't really divided at all. It's all one big room with no physical division. The dining area is all booths for the most part. The bar area is a long bar with stools and then a cluster of high tops, including some high tops that are part booth.

Upon seating me, the hostess explained that the only part of the menu available was - the nachos. The rest of the menu is not available until after January 1st.

And so I sat there for awhile. No one even so much as looked at me. Though, I counted at least 12 staff (hostesses, bartenders, and servers) milling around and there were only 4 other customers in the entire restaurant. But ok, I was waiting for someone, so maybe they were waiting until that person arrived. Nonetheless, seemed strange that no one took my drink order, brought water, etc.

After the person I waiting for arrived, we continued to wait for about another 10 minutes. At that point, a woman who I assume was a manager came over and asked if we'd been helped yet. She then promised that our server would be right over and she took our drink order (stating that the drinks were on her). She was incredibly sweet and friendly. Things were looking up.

The bartender, after being all befuddled at how our drinks could possibly be on the manager, brought us our drinks one by one. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the draft beer selection was rather decent. They have the standards (Bud, Coors, etc.), and they have the slightly better (Blue Moon, etc.), and then also have the way better (Snow Cap, 2 Below, Dogfish Head, etc.).

After a few more minutes, our server arrived. She apologized for the wait and asked if we were ready to order. The nacho list is quite extensive and inventive (and you can also build your own). And all of the nachos are available as a half or full order. We settled on two half orders - the Buffalo Hot and Sloppy Daddy. At this point, we were informed that they didn't have the chips the Buffalo Hot is supposed to come with. Ok then, we'll just have it on regular tortilla chips.

Our server was very nice and was good with timing, checking on us, etc. However, it definitely seemed like she was very new - new not only to this new restaurant, but new to serving. She was super sweet, but seemed a little flustered. In fact, I think the same could be said of the majority of the staff here. And by staff, I mean young, thin females with a strong preference for blondes. Possibly trying a little too hard for a Hooters feel.

It seemed to take a while for our food to arrive, especially considering it is nachos. But it didn't take too long, so all ok. The nachos were pretty good. Good enough to warrant us coming here again. The chicken on the Buffalo Hot was just the right size and perfectly spicy (which in my book, is on the very hot side). The pulled pork on the Sloppy Daddy has a great flavor. And the best part was that they didn't skimp on the cheese. Unlike other plates of nachos, we were not left halfway through eating with a plate of chips and no toppings. The cheese permeated every inch of of the chips. They weren't the best nachos I've ever had. In fact, not even close. But they were different and they were yummy. 

The prices, though, did seem a little high for what you get. You can get full orders of nachos elsewhere for less than the price of the half orders here.

The manager came over two additional times, asking what we had ordered (and making some small talk) and then again after the food had arrived (asking how everything was). Major props.

The decor is nice and everything was very pristine. Several large flat screens in the bar area tuned to different sports channels. Even a couple of flat screens in the corners of the dining section. No gaming. No smoking. Music was neither too loud or too soft - primarily all Top 40.

Overall, a decent experience and a decent place. I fully intend on patronizing here again, especially to see how it is after the kinks are ironed out. And ok, yeah, I might already be craving the Buffalo Hot nachos a little bit.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,11,6,3,7wKxl4gkgQh9dIiwKSLmLQ

We both ordered pretty standard entrees, tacos for me and enchiladas for DC.  We skipped the Nachos, not really a favorite for either of us.  While we were waiting for our entrees to be brought out we were each given one corn jalapeno muffin to snack on.  This thing was pretty darn tasty, and I was hoping it was foreshadowing for the rest of the meal.

It wasn't.  When the food finally arrived (more on that later), it was pleasantly average.  My tacos had a nice mango salsa that was crunchy and cool.  The fish was pretty mild and the tortilla was almost stale tasting (odd for a place that has a giant tortilla press behind a glass window).  DC said his enchiladas were absolutely forgettable.  No real flavor or otherwise distinguishing characteristics.

Our service was about the same - the waitress was pleasant but didn't really go above and beyond.  Our food came out eventually, plates burning from sitting under the heat lamp.  The table across the way came in after us and received their food before us, and we only got one follow up that our food would be out shortly.

All in all, this experience was completely average.  Nothing stood out and there's no real reason for me to go back.  I'd probably give it a second chance if I had a coupon or another Living Social voucher, but otherwise not.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,0,0,2,_ama1Wcu_mpUCBfIc-XQtQ

Service: -2 STARS from when we came in till we left. No one greeted us and when someone finally did I felt like a burden to have the hostess seat us.

Took 7 mins for anyone to approach us. By the time we got our water it was over 10 mins of being in the place. I order a sangria and she asked ""White or Red?""

FOOD: 2 Stars the chips are overly salted. Had a bug near my sons plate then went to dip my fries in the Ketchup only to find a bug in my ketchup. 

Overall: 1 Star they took care of my burger for experiencing a bug on my food. On Mondays kids eat free! Oh and Wine about Monday's BOGO on the wine expect when I asked about my Sangria I was told for wine only. In most places Sangria is considered wine but I guess not here even when she asked me when placing the order ""White or Red?"" 

When I told the manager about the bugs she said oh no they come in every week to spray. Although they took care of my entree the lack sympathy was so fake I just wanted to get out of there.

~ Service was lacking.

Detailed Review:
We decided to try this place out for a Girl's Dinner/Night Out. I saw that it got mixed reviews on Yelp but decided to give it a try. First, who ever heard of any Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa?? They were only $2.95 for bottomless chips but I love Mexican food and have never, ever been charged for them. Because I checked in on Yelp I ended up getting a coupon for the chips anyway. Our waitress Megan R. was very nice but in the end was lacking. We started off by ordering a couple of margaritas (2 regular and one virgin) and an order of Mexican corn. About 5 minutes later a gentleman brought over 2 regular margaritas. I asked him about my virgin margarita and he said that he only had a ticket for the 2 regular and maybe it was on a different ticket. Ok? A few more minutes later Megan comes by to say they were making it now (not sure if she forgot to put it in). We ended up ordering our food. 3 of us got enchiladas (comes with rice and beans too) and one of us got tacos. One of the girls ordered enchiladas with no beans only rice and queso sauce on the side and the regular green sauce on the enchilada and another one ordered enchiladas with queso sauce on the enchilada and the red sauce on the side also. At this time I asked Megan for some lemons for my water. Another gentleman brought out our food and it looked good. My enchilada was hot but the other 2 girls said their enchiladas were only lukewarm. Megan stopped by to check on us and we told her about the enchiladas. I still hadn't received the lemons so I asked Megan for them again. The manager came over and took the enchiladas back to be redone. After awhile they brought the redone enchiladas back out and I finally got my lemons. We ended up getting our check and the manager did take the 2 enchiladas off that had to be redone. We did notice on the check that they also charged us $6 ($3 each) for the sauces on the side and an extra $2.25 for the person that only wanted rice no beans. We did mention to the manager that the servers might want to mention when you order if they are going to charge more for extra sauce or a substitutions (we didn't see anything on the menu about the extra charges). They also forgot to take off the chips in the end. On another note, I did visit the bathroom during my visit and it was disgusting. Definitely needed a good cleaning. There was stuff on the walls that I don't even want to start to think about what it was. Plus it smelled in there. Basically we won't be returning here again.",TqKDnj5_IthGvPCGgN1qvQ,3,0,2,x7GiKrkXBVYIX5xBKuUqiQ

It was great! They have a complete menu for vegans & vegetarians - including mango tacos, fajita tofu salad (quite spicy, but the sauteed tofu spiced and prepared perfect) the vegan nacho has a vegan patty crumbles over it. Really great stuff. My husband had some chicken tacos, that he liked. Kids meal has lots of options too - both Mexican and American cuisine choices (only 4.99 & includes a drink). And then of course all the nachos - they have nacho combinations with inspirations from other cuisines, quite interesting and a lot of them sound amazing. The only minus for me - no wine list. Beer list is definitely making up for it though with some great Belgian beer and smaller American microbreweries, they also offer draft beer mixes (!) Really interesting...  Some items are definitely pricier than expected, like the fried ice cream dessert - 7.95 I believe, but it is big - more than enough to share for 3-4 people and its basically deep fried vanilla ice cream with raspberry and chocolate chips and lots of whipped cream. The service was absolutely great, waitress was exceptionally knowledgeable of the extensive menu, and courses came in very timely fashion.

2315581,2013-06-09,4,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"This is a Happy Hour with Florentine Nacho Review.

I've been in here a few times in the past & went in today for a quick happy hour snack.  I asked for a menu & the ""bartendress"" gave me the normal menu.  I had to put in a special request for the happy hour menu.  It wasn't a biggie, but she acted like she was clueless that it was happy hour.

I've tried several ""flavors"" of their nachos before & most are pretty fucking nasty.  Meats & cheeses turn into pools of grease on your plate.  The only selection I can half way recommend is the Florentine Nachos (grilled chicken, sundried tomato, prosciutto & spinach in a asiago/romano/parmesan sauce over spinach chips.)  Warning...they will turn your #2 an odd green.  So green that you think you may be dying of something.  So far they haven't made me sick...just anticipate a color change in the pot after eating.

It can sometimes be a challenge eating your nachos depending on how they are assembled.  Think of that 80s game Jenga...move the wrong nacho from the pile & you are fucked with bits & pieces of food landing all over the bar counter.

Pretty limited selection of beers on tap, but the Union Jack Pale Ale is served ice cold at $5 a glass.  Much appreciated on a 110+ degree day in the desert.  I may need to be a bit more adventurous & try their other nachos, but every time that I do...I am disappointed.  Have I had better nachos elsewhere?  Hell yes...home for instance, but every now & then, I get a craving for the green ones that make me colorful on the inside.  3 stars for the Florentine nachos & ice cold beer..1-2 stars for their other nacho choices.",0E2Q9mJsMdQ0hRkKTVWuag,5,4,3,CprPoqvID83m86xc_BS4Pg

Today I tried the club sandwich and was not disappointed.  Good sized portions of tasty ham and turkey with significant bacon on a freshly warmed bread roll.  A little bite from a combination of the Anaheim chili and Chipotle sause added that little extra kick you remember for a bit after the meal (in a good way).  

We were served by Megan, a recent Employee of the Month, and we could tell from her attention to detail that the honor was well deserved.  My girlfriend, the vegetarian, asked for, and was totally impressed with a ""taco salad without the taco meat"".  From a seat away, it looked really good and according to her, one of the best salads she's ever had.  I may try it next time with some real ""taco type"" meat to get the real deal.  In past visits I've had a variety of the traditional and way out nachos (thus the name) and cheeseburgers and have always been pleased with the food, service, location and pricing.  

This place is a no-brainer for a casual lunch during the week or on weekends.  Oh, and when I asked which of the dozen or so TV's had my favorite NASCAR race on it, the hostess wisely responded, that ""any of our TV's can be programmed to whatever sport you want to watch"".

The food took quite a while to materialize, but we were plied with some absolutely delicious jalapeno corn muffins. I was pretty pleased with my salad. It was big, served in a tortilla bowl and had plenty of non-lettuce bits. I will ask for it with no cheese next time (tasted remarkably like feta and there was *way* too much of it). The carne asada tacos were on the smaller side, served with rice and beans. Probably enough food for the average person, but did not get any rave reviews from Boyfriend (did not satisfy his constant Mexican food craving). The nachos seemed unimpressive to me. The pile was certainly large, but there was a poor chip:topping ratio; I expected there to be much more in the way of toppings. Having sampled some of the other nacho flavors there, I suspect that this was just a poor menu choice. The other nachos are great (seems like the ""fancier"" you go, the tastier they are),

I had the tortilla soup which had a cream base which was very different. It was good but not filling. My friend had the infamous burrito and damn was it good. There were large chunks of chicken breast throughout and the presentation was great. We paid nearly $60 for lunch which I felt was costly but the two drinks eased the pain on my wallet.

The food was aight. Not great, not terrible. Definitely get a lot of Nacho for your buck. They're piled high and visually were pretty neat. Not very practical as they were piled high on a tiny plate. I couldn't figure out if it was more like a game of Jenga or an avalanche when I was trying to decide which chip to take. The chicken nachos were good, chicken was a touch dry, the beans were a little cold, but the chips were fresh and the other toppings very good. I was a little disappointed that the soda machine was broke, since Mexican food without soda is like peanut butter without jelly. Well maybe not that bad, but you get the point. The server was okay, not terrible not great, just middle of the road.

I would probably give them another shot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. A coupon would probably give me more incentive to go back.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,0,3,FTumQbnJTnTdEl_jX8wi7w

We ordered our food along with chips & salsa, which still amazes me that they charge for them. Maybe a 2nd or 3rd basket.. but come on.. even Baja Fresh gives you chips why you wait... 

My husband ordered the Nacho Daddy burger which he said is probably one of best burgers he ever had.. 

I ordered a combination of the Shrimp & Fish tacos.. Highly recommend you try the fish tacos when you visit. They were pretty much everything you wish for in a taco.

So on her last night out here visiting we decided to hit up Nacho Daddy and revel in the carbs. Plus, after depleting our bank accounts over the weekend a restaurant with a coupon is always good.

For starters we got the Raspberry Margarita. It actually had a real raspberry taste instead of just the artificial one. Very good! And we split two Nacho skillets with our buy one-get one deal. 

The Thai Chicken Nachos came out first (they also brought a wrong order, but fixed it quickly and professionally) and they had a great flavor! I loved the Sweet Chili Sauce mixing in with the white queso-delicious! The majority of the toppings were just on top with some on bottom with many chips in between. We almost wanted more substance, but overall the chips were good.

The Buffalo Chicken Nachos were our second round, and by this time we were already stuffed! Although we were incredibly thankful they did not come out at the same time. We got to avoid the sogginess that happens when queso is involved. These nachos were also very good. The buffalo sauce was not overwhelming and had a really good flavor and it complemented the cheese well. The chicken was really breaded and a little to ""fake chicken"" like for my taste but it tasted alright.

Overall, great atmosphere for a nacho/pub joint. The place was clean, the service was friendly and the food was good. We came at the end of happy hour but they seem to have some great specials.

I was a bit annoyed the the raspberry tea was from the fountain. My husband didn't like it but the wait staff brought him a refill before he even drank two sips. It was if they were scared of not proving so great of service that they didn't care if they wasted food.

Regardless, my salad was great aside from the cubed chicken. It wasn't worth the $3 dollars extra to get that protein.

My husband wasnt a fan of his enchiladas.  It had the appearance it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. But in the past we've had great nacho dishes, specifically the Thai chicken nachos.

Half the reviews were not too positive, but until you actually experience it for yourself, then you can reflect it here on Yelp. So my expectations were neutral.

As we came in, the hostess greeted us and were sat down right away. About a minute later, Victoria, (who was our server), came by to take our order. As soon as we informed her we were noobs, she politely gave us a little overview of the menu. As we were deciding she got our drink orders and left to get them. When she came back, she gave us a small order of the Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins! I gotta say it was good and just the fact that Victoria gave us some to try was very commendable! 

I got the Fajita Nachos, my two kids got basic kids items, (chicken fingers, bean n cheese burrito), and my wife got endless chips and salsa. Good thing I only ordered one plate of nachos because what they give you is a lot! All for of us shared it after they ate their meal already and we still couldnt finish it! The chicken fingers were basically cooked like Katsu! For those that don't know what that is, its a chicken breast lightly breaded and deep fried to a golden crisp. 

For dessert, we had two choices: Deep Fried Ice Cream or a Churro topped with Ice Cream, Chocolate Drizzle, and surrounded by different colored tortilla chips. We chose the Deep Fried Ice Cream! Again, we all had to share it because it was a pretty good sized item.

2828059,2014-08-22,1,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I want to start this review by saying-- we did not get any complementary chips and salsa! Isn't that a given when you decide to eat at a Mexican restaurant. And everyone around us got some and we didn't! 

Of course we had to order a round of margaritas. I went with the Mango Thai basil & Nieves D got the guava flavored. Both tasted identical. I didn't taste an ounce of guava in her drink. They were pretty strong tho. You only need 1 drink! 

I went with the Ceviche. This is the first time I ever said this-- my ceviche did not have enough lime. I'm usually complaining about how sour the ceviche is but this time it's the opposite. Also, it really lacked in shrimp. It barely had any. But I did enjoy it! It wasn't terrible. 

Nieves D got the Salmon. Holy smokes it was a BIG size salmon too. They weren't cheap with the salmon for sure. The black bean sauce on top was pretty darn good. The veggies were seasoned pretty well. 

Besides the missing chips and salsa, the service was good. We were checked on the right times and our check came fast.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,4,2,3,5zQc6RsK_cQBzSGCQE7Q5g

I was plenty happy with that. I got the queso dip, but it seemed a bit doughy, like the base sauce had too much flour. I'll give it another try before I decide whether this is a worthwhile trip.

My wife ordered the florentine nachos, and she was pleased with them. I wasn't a fan, but it could be because that was totally not what I was in the mood to eat. 

My son got regular nachos which were nothing to write home about.

My other son got the Philly Cheesesteak Fajita. Interesting concept, wasn't wild about the execution. 

The server was really nice and friendly, and the atmosphere is great for families.

This is a family friendly environment that doesn't cost a fortune. Let's face it who doesn't like nachos.

The chicken florentine looks like a work of art. Thankfully it taste as well as it looked. So far the best tasting nachos were the prime rib.

But I will not be revisiting Nacho Daddy, so this review is from our one shot last night, and I think a more appropriate rating is 1.5 stars.  I came back after a few days working in the middle of nowhere desert  and was craving nachos.  Even after reading a slew of mediocre (at best) reviews, I figure I'd like to check it out for myself.  We downloaded the menu, made our selection, and called in a pickup order.  The voice on the other end was none too thrilled to help us with the order (strike 1), but, I've had plenty of experience with disgruntled front desk staff at perfectly good dining establishments.  We ordered two nachos, the loaded chili cheese, and we had a hankering for the taste of wings, so we ordered the ""buffalo hot"".

The loaded chili cheese nachos came as the chips covered in some wilted green onion slices, with a side of the chili and the nacho cheese (nice of them to want to keep the chips from getting soggy).  They forgot the sour cream that comes standard, and my addition of guac (strike 2).  The chips were light and flaky and the chili was tasty with a hint of spice, but the nacho cheese was just standard roller-rink style canned orange nacho (I was hoping for something more like white spicy queso, since it's title is ""que bueno cheese sauce"").  So, meh, definitely not worth $10.

The buffalo nachos were missing the BUFFALO part (major strike 3)!  There was none of the promised buffalo sauce, cayenne pepper, etc, so it was just nachos, mozz cheese, fried chicken bites obviously dumped out of a bag, blue cheese and celery (a nice touch).  Seriously, how can you forget the buffalo sauce on the buffalo nachos?!  Not cool....

We were there over lunch time after stopping in at another store in the area.  The nachos, while interesting, just weren't my thing.  My friend and I shared the chicken florentine nachos, the pulled pork nachos and each had a draft Modelo beer.  Sadly the Modelo was the highlight of our meal.  The nachos come in two sizes: the regular sharing portion and the entree portion for 4 dollars more.  We chose the regular sharing portion for both.  Two small plates of nachos and two draft beers shouldn't cost 35 bucks plus tip over the lunch hour in my opinion.  Service was so-so as well; never offered another round and never offered more napkins for our overly greasy fingers.

When I ordered my second margarita I asked for it the same way as the first (frozen, salt) but it came out on the rocks with no salt.

their menu comprised of mostly nachos (surprise!) and your typical bar fare. they had simple pastas, a couple burritos, salads, etc. since they specialize in nachos, they had a plethera of every kind of nacho combination you can think of. they had some novelty items on the menu like the nachos with meal worms, circkets, and scorpions for the more adventurous eater, or the hawaiian nachos with spam, pineapple and kimchee.

i had the steak fajita nachos. typical steak fajita served on top of crisped flour tortillas with the usual fixins. it was pretty average. the amount of meat was al ittle disappointing. my bf had the fish tacos. battered white fish on corn tortillas.

Yes, I am aware that they had nothing to do with El Jefe's closing down and subsequent replacement, but my mind still went to that place every single time I drive by this location.

Regardless, my best friend and I stopped by this location at the start of an all day shopping spree.  The decor is so cute.  You walk in and the first thing that you notice is the GIANT Las Vegas Blvd sign hanging near the hostess station.  If you look up at the ceiling, there are several large, square tiles that have been finished with the trademark labels of numerous different liquors/alcoholic beverages and then overlayed at different levels.  It's very chic on the inside, you don't expect that out of a restaurant called ""Nacho Daddy.""  It's a pleasant surprise.

We split an appetizer of the queso dip and it was unbelievably good.  Generally, you either find that any Mexican food place doesn't serve queso dip or it isn't very good at all.  This combined with the homemade chips made for a great starter.  My best friend orderd the Cheese Enchiladas while I ordered the Grilled Chicken Quasadilla.  Both were excellent.

Both of these things are not indicated on the menu and can greatly affect the enjoyment of your meal.

I ordered the Supreme Tostado Nacho's and my wife had the Daddy's Wings. The nachos themselves were huge, a lot of toppings...but not very much meat which was weird. I can't see why the amount of taco meat was so small on a plate of nachos that cost $13. Everything else seemed right though, they give you a good amount of guacamole and all the ingredients seemed fresh. My favorite part was the avocado lime salsa, it is killer! 

My wife didn't have as much luck with her food. She ordered the wings and asked for them extra crispy but they came out undercooked and with too much sauce making them really soggy. The wings come with a dip, which we asked for ranch and got blue cheese. No problem, they got it swapped out pretty quick. Now the problem...there's something in the ranch that's not supposed to be there. We pulled out 3 big dark chunks of something that I think maybe the kitchen dropped in the ranch and had been sitting in there a while. I'm not sure what it was but it was big, soggy and nasty...when I find things in my food that shouldn't be there, it's all over for me.

I was going to give them one star but the waiter noticed my wife stopped eating her food and without us saying a word, he offered to take the wings off the bill.

We ordered:

GUACAMOLE- Fresh and flavorful.

3 Kinds of SALSA- A tad watery and not enough bite for my liking. Didn't care for any of them. 

Side of White QUESO- The only thing that would make this cheese better is if naked Ryan Gosling was feeding this to me with his fingers while whispering sweet words in my ear.

ENCHILADA NACHOS- Not a huge fan of the red enchilada sauce they used, but overall still grubbed big time on these. Nice huge chunks of white meat chicken.

CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP- My partner in crime loved it.

Dessert Nachos/FRIED ICE CREAM- I was lovin' on the chocolate and vanilla tortilla chips! Delicious ice cream, too!

I understand that the kitchen isn't fully operational, however, this wasn't made clear when we ate there on that night.

The food was god-awful!  A friend and I weren't all that hungry, but figured we should eat something before heading to the strip for the night.  I had to try the chili con queso since it is one of my weaknesses.  This was one of the worst I've had.  Not only was it velveeta-esque, it really didn't have any kick to it at all.  I added healthy amounts of a couple of different hot sauces on the table and it still was barely edible.  I also had the chicken tortilla soup.  Weirdest tortilla soup I've ever had.  Once again not very spicy, and the ""broth"" was like a thick barbeque-sauce.  And, the most plentiful ingredient in my soup - corn!  What little chicken was in there was tasty.  I hunted it out and left the rest.  My friend got a couple of the street tacos and wasn't thrilled.  He actually commented that we should have gone to Roberto's (which I guess is a fast food Mexican place - I'm not from the area).

To top it all off, it's supposed to be a sports bar and the TV we were sat next to was on the fritz, with the color and picture going out at regular intervals.

My advice, skip this place and find somewhere else.  Maybe Roberto's?",XU7XWlJ0LYEBvISTiLMFxQ,1,0,2,SvVmSL54HXtI297nX2wbOA

Sometimes it's good as far as sports restaurants go, but then we frequently get the apathetic or lazy server who gives off the impression that she just wants to turn the table, as the phrase goes. Not friendly, forgetful, and seemingly put off by our presence, is what we get sometimes. My 8 y.o. knows the servers she likes and doesn't like.

Came to Nacho Daddy absolutely famished, and left not being able to finish! 

My friend and I sat in the bar area for happy hour. She ordered two street tacos and queso dip, while I went ahead and ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nachos. There were also quesadillas, Elote (corn), and more giant nacho plates to choose from! 

Apparently, what I got was smaller than the original-non-happy-hour sized nachos, but I definitely couldn't tell! Imagine a big juicy burger. Complete with bacon, diced onions, and loads of cheese. Now, imagine that juicy burger (sans the bun) all chopped up and stacked with delicious chips! DROOL. 

We ordered the 2-4-1 margaritas (good for the original and strawberry ONLY). I would definitely come back to try the white peach margarita. 

Absolutely everything that passed our table while we waited for our food (which came pretty quickly) smelled and looked phenomenal!

I also really appreciated that smoking is not allowed in the restaurant. This California girl is used to her restaurants without a side of nicotine.  

Happy hour is from 3-6 p Monday through Wednesday/Thursday I believe. Great service and excellent food -- go check them out!

Our waitress Kim was great, and very sweet. We ordered the ""Buffalo Hot Nacho"" as an appetizer, my bf ordered the ""Daddy's Bowl with Marinated Filet Mignon"" and I ordered the ""BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich"". 

The nachos took about 20 minutes to arrive immediately followed by our entrees. The waitress apologized for the kitchen being backed up and somewhat out of order. We weren't thrilled that all of our food arrived at the same time but it was no big deal to us. 

The buffalo nachos were really runny with buffalo sauce and the sandwich was ok. My boyfriend said his bowl was ok, nothing really worth coming back for. 

We left disappointed with the quality of the food but the service was in fact great! Unfortunately both of us became violently ill later that day due to food poisoning from the nachos.

3391618,2011-05-30,2,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I think this place got a bad rap from the early reviews when they first opened, I say ignore the early reviews and go with the ones from mid 2011 like mine.

We just got back and I must say the place is NOT for healthy eating, no way. We junk fooded ourselves and did the traditional nachos, chicken wings and a Sonoran Hot Dog! Massive calorie overload!, but who eats this every day? A basket of fries were also dropped off with the order, but I guess it pairs with the chicken wings. (When it comes to food, I'm a ""common sewer"" ha ha!) ***YAY nice thick steak fries, I loved that aspect, the shoestring fries sux!***

The decor is casual and fun, TVs everywere and bar looking for the most part. I was surprised how huge it is inside, the building looks smaller from the outside, but indoors there is plenty of seating. There is a guy making fresh tortillas in the back room and you can see the machine that makes the chips, pretty cool. The machine is made by a company called ""Lenin"". Hmmm? strange Russian heritage there somewheres.

Oh yeah, I thought this was funny. I see they have $2 Coronas in cans, so I order one. A few minutes later the waitress goes by and litterally drops the can off on the table. ""Here's your Corona"" as she skampers away. I'm like Whaaaaaaaat? No glass, no lime, not opened, just drop and go! Amazing! I did get some limes and a glass when she passed by again. Funny!

Overall good place and the nachos were not as bad as the previous EARLY reviews makes the place sound. Our traditional nachos didn't have canned cheese on it, although we did have to ask for a side of guacamole and sour cream after we noticed it was missing, but then again it might have been melted all together so that is why it looked it wasn't there. Just ask for some, the bussers are very helpful.

Good place to""junk"" yourself out, we'll be back when our cholesterol levels go back down to semi normal. Ha ha!  Seriously, I like it for the most part.",rn2DB_YX0BvToYe50RNr_Q,3,2,4,cAmnJbfSkAjto7ftn0sVLA

They have a huge menu with many different types of foods for any of your picky friends. You're bound to find something you and your friends will enjoy! The awesome part for my friends and I is the Vegetarian and Vegan menu! Which makes choosing foods easy since I won't necessarily have to read all the ingrediants on the list if I order anything off that menu. 

We came here on a Tuesday which is Tequila and Taco Tuesdays! They have 2 for 1 shots of any of the Tequilla and 3 tacos for $6 or $7 depending on the type of meat you get. Not a bad deal! I was with a group of 10 people sooooo we decided to order food as a group and share. Basically we got the Nacho party platter, it was larger than anyone expected.....safe to say we didn't finish it, lol. I didn't get to try any of it, but everyone had their own favorite since it contained four different nachos they have. We ordered around 4-5 plates of the tacos and then the vegan nachos. 

I did try the vegan nachos and that was delicous! It had all my favorites, daiya cheese, beans, corn, mild salsa, guacamole, and fake meat =P that's all I can recall. It's enough to share between two people! 

Oh and we also got Chips & Salsa, but I requested hot salsa and I was disappointed when the hot salsa tasted like mild salsa to me. Even asked for extra habeneros but apparently they don't offer that. The waitress was kind enough to bring some other hot sauce which was good, but not spicy sooo that was a bust. 

Add a couple of rounds of drinks and we were all set! I think we stayed past closing time, but we weren't kicked out and they never said anything to us which was awesome! We didn't even realize otherwise we would have been out the door 10 minutes before closing.

3618239,2014-11-13,7,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I sure do love me some nachos. I dragged my babygirl here for our first meal while visiting Las Vegas. While it may have not have lived up to the expectations my prejudgments had given it, Nacho Daddy has several endearing qualities.

The food orders served here are all huge. Double check your appetite before ordering. The mountain of Vegan nachos we ordered filled me up for most of the day. At first their menu prices seem steep, ($15.99 for some nachos??) yet the amount they give you reflects the cost.

Speaking of that mountain... I appreciate that they have several Vegan options here. I just don't feel that melting some Daiya onto tortilla chips is really ""nachos"" to me. Sure it had all the other toppings, including a pile of guacamole and a sausage type crumble. I just need my nachos to be ""saucy"". These weren't doing it for me. A for effort. D for execution.

The Tex-Mex burrito while big in stature, was small on taste. It was pretty much filled with unseasoned rice. We took it back to the hotel with us, but never finished it. I'm not normally one to waste food, so that pretty much sums up this burrito.

Any place that serves a gigantic plate of Vegan nachos is a friend of mine. The beer specials don't hurt their cause either. $10 for a 22oz bomber of Rogue Voodoo Donuts Pretzel Raspberry Stout was a steal considering you can't find it for less at most stores. I went with the Highwater Campfire Stout instead, which was also a pretty good deal. They also have plenty of beers on tap, and a whole page dedicated to various flavors of margaritas. While I didn't partake in the bottomless Bloody Mary bar for $16, they seem to pour the vodka using a heavy hand from the few cups I observed being filled.

Perhaps their newer downtown Vegas location would be more convenient for you, yet don't pass up an opportunity to check out the original. Daddy Nacho knows how to pick his staff. Any of the ladies employed here could work down the street at Twin Peaks if they so desired. The bartender was very good at her job, interacting with customers and pouring drinks. Our server, Ashley was awesome. You can tell this isn't her only job in the customer service industry. Friendly, with a huge smile, she took care of us throughout our meal. The best service we received during our entire time in Vegas. 

Service: 6/5

Beer and booze: 4/5

Food: 2/5

So as you can see, come here for the drinks, drink specials, to watch sports on their many televisions, and most certainly come for the spectacular service. Just don't come expecting the food to blow you away.

I've stayed away until now because the restaurant was put into the building that once was El Jefe's which was my favorite and I am still mourning the loss of both the El Jefe's and the owner.  However, I digress . . . 

I will say the 5 stars is directly related to the service from Chelsea who was amazingly knowledgeable about the menu.  She was a rockstar, which is not necessarily a rating given regularly from my partner, who was formerly a Director of Operations for a restaurant conglomerate.  He is a tough critic.

Things Chelsea did to make us love her . . .
- talked directly to my 4 year old (which he LOVED) and recommended he try the Cactus Juice -- he couldn't wait to tell her ""that was my favorite drink ever""
- recommendations overall were great - I loved the Lychee Marg she recommended when I decided the skinny girl margs were not cutting it 
- She was obviously working ""kids corner"" for that evening - and she was still maintaining a good attitude
(parents you are all familiar with this, everyone dining with kids gets sat in the same corner - which generally equates to the same section, which then customarily means the server handling kids corner gets ran ragged, has to clean up 10x the mess of a regular table and has to deal with screaming, crying, running, complaining, etc. and sometimes gets screwed on tips because many parents are so used to having toddlers they don't realize what a pain it is to serve them and clean up after them when you didn't give birth to them)

Now to the food -- for me Spicy Shrimp Nachos entree - magnificent - i loved the flavors together - the salsa seemed smokey which went well with the cilantro, white cheese and shrimpies  Delicious with a couple margs.  For my man - Burger and Beer for $10, a Blue Moon and a Cheeseburger with a huge burger patty, he seemed pleased.  For the little guy - a cheese quesadilla - perfectly plain just how he likes it.

Is there new management?  A new chef?  Whatever it is, it is working.  The nachos were ten times better, not as bland as before, and had a more proper cover of cheese.  

Let me tell you the quesadilla was amazing.  I know what you're thinking, ""seriously, you're telling me about a quesadilla?"" Yes, yes I am.  It was perfectly cooked in a flour tortilla with the perfect amount of cheese, for the perfect amount of time.  Delicious.  I would go back just for this.

You must also try the corn on the cob.  The chili-lime cotija flavor is just awesome.

Service was definitely a lot more attentive and friendly than my previous visits.  Our server was a just a bit awkward in his approach but that isn't a big deal.  The only thing is it seemed as though the ambiance was favoring a more ""mature"" crowd.  The music was turned down waaaay low.

Came here with a group of friends who really hyped this place up for me like it was the best Mexican food on earth. I was also forced to come on a semi-full stomach so that's also probably why it affected the ""okayness"" of this place. It's good for groups and was not too busy when we came in. They have an extensive menu and also extensively pricey on some items. Specifically the ONE taco I ordered was freaking $8. I thought it came with 2 but realized that it was only 1 when the waitress asked me. I ordered the Fish Taco which had a star next to it so I was expecting it to be wonderful as fuck for the $8 I was going to pay for it. But no... it was literally just like wtf. It was a small taco with a soggy grilled fished topped with a shit ton of mangoes, onions and cilantro and some sort of tartar sauce I'm assuming. But the tortilla was actually pretty good..much better than the soggy fish. I was also disappointed in the chips and salsa that my friends worshiped because I've definitely had way better chips and salsa than that. Is it my fault that I was given false high expectations? Lol. Oh yeah and I also got a chance to try their Supreme Nachos which was basically Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme on steroids. Again, nothing special at all. I feel bad that I had such high standards so maybe one day in the future again when my friends force me to go here when I'm NOT on a semi-full stomach, the food might taste better to me.",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,2,1,3,6sdR01xvcaBQwY7oOwt99g

4012367,2014-07-09,7,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I went there for trivia night last Wednesday.  Food and experience was horrible.  I had the enchilada nachos with the sauce on the side since it tasted great at the downtown location but it didn't taste the same here.  I ask for the sauce on the side so I can control the portion that's on the nacho chip but I must have been served a bad batch, the sauces stuck horribly with me through the day and was thicker than usual.

For trivia we were seated in the back room, no AC/ weak fan, and the speakers wasn't working.  We complained that we couldn't hear and they didn't fix it until after the 3rd round but by that time we were already sweating balls and receiving our drinks late.  Food arrived on time.  The speakers were fixed quickly after we complained, why the heck was this not taken care of before the game started?  Oh, because they were late to their own event.  The restaurants were out of scorpions too, boo.

We were one of the first to arrive but the tables were already arranged by staff, people showed up late in the main dining area which was where I preferred to have sat.  I've had multiple great experiences but this past event was a disaster.  

The reason for the extra star is because management tried to appease us but we've already decided to get the check and get the FFFFFF out.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,6,6,2,ususWwsTMQl6dfk5M4hjEw

The setup inside is pretty standard - dining room on one side, big bar on the other - and the atmosphere is typical ""fiesta"" style. No problem there.
The menu IS kinda random because it's centered on all the crazy nachos they have (regular, sloppy joe, buffalo, veggie, cuban, etc), but then on the other side they threw in a bunch of other Mexican dishes, some sandwiches, and hamburgers. I didn't try anything from the back side of the menu, but figured we better stick to the namesake nachos. We ordered the traditional (large size to split) and I thought they were really good. Nothing outstanding - I mean, hey, we're only talking about nachos - but they used some really quality ingredients and everything had a nice flavor. At ~$13 for the full platter (2 of us almost finished it), they are a little more pricey than other places, but I think they're also a little better.
Bonus to Nacho Daddy for a decent beer selection, and big (22-oz I think) domestics are only $4, and $3 during happy hour!
Service was pretty average - nothing to write home about.
Overall, I'll go back to Nacho Daddy if I'm in the area and feeling nachos (NOT Mexican!). 
Seemed to me that they're earlier service issues have been cleaned up, so hopefully everyone will be back to support a new local joint!",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,2,3,MuRKrl6hh06QC4gNlk2uIw
4056066,2013-01-08,0,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I live in Henderson so I always see Nacho Daddy while driving down Eastern. Yesterday my mom and I decided to give it a try. 

It wasn't to busy yet. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and decided to seat ourselves in the bar. Lucky for us it was happy hour. They have an awesome happy hour menu. A variety of different apps and nachos from $3-$6 and great drink specials. We went for the calamari, Thai chicken nachos, and supreme tostada nachos. 

Food Pros: The Thai chicken nachos are my new favorite thing. So delicious and good layers of flavor. These were personal portions and they were very generous! Big pieces of fire grilled chicken. And who ever thought of having the sweet chili sauce and the creamy queso sauce is a genius. The kicker: the house made jalapeno corn chips. The supreme tostada nachos were very tasty. These are your classic nachos. The nachos you want while watching the game. Mounds of delicious cheesy goodness, sour cream, guacamole, ground beef,  and jalapenos. Both nachos had perfect chip to stuff ratio. Nobody wants all these plain chips leftover on the bottom with no yummyness to scoop them up with.

Food Cons: The calamari was ok. I've had a lot of calamari in my day. It was hot, crunchy, a little to much breading, the pieces were kind of tiny, but for $5 it wasn't bad at all. The best part was the serrano aioli for dipping. 

Service: Our server was overall attentive and friendly. Especially with my mother's indecisiveness. A bit slow at the end when we were waiting for our check and return of check. 

I will definitely go back again. It would be a great place to watch the game or have a drink with friends. They have great football game specials as well. Our bill was only $18 with tax. I am interested in trying more of the menu and seeing if everything matches up to the fantastic Thai Chicken Nachos!",W0tRmXSZ25GqQIHkM3GKFw,6,0,4,UKo0g8sL0xgBTw3oxHfP8Q

The bottom line is this: the food is decent, but the service is atrocious! The food is a good 3.5 stars but the service is a half star, hence the 2 star average rating.

Do not eat here if you want a quick meal. It's at least a 2 hour commitment, even for lunch! It's obvious that this large restaurant is sorely understaffed. I'll compare it to the far superior Lindo Michoacan -- that restaurant is twice the size but the service is always fantastic there. Nacho Daddy, please hire more people because your sloooooow service makes me avoid being a regular customer. 

The food leans toward the gourmet side, is good, and as you'd expect, is a little overpriced. You even have to pay for chips and salsa (something just about every other Mexican restaurant on the planet gives away for free). They have a great selection of -- you guessed it -- nachos. The nachos have many inventive ingredient combinations but the kitchen sometimes leaves things off completely. Never have I had a plate of nachos arrive that are exactly as described on the menu. Something is always missing.  They have other Mexican staples too: their fajitas are tasty (but sadly no homemade tortillas here). There's also a good selection of unique vegan / vegetarian options so your veggie pal isn't stuck eating the same old boring salad.

Be sure to check Groupon or Living Social for a special discount deal before dining here. You can sometimes score a nice savings!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,12,6,2,k869etQWZ3YyDCqlwjz4Bw
4085542,2015-07-02,0,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"Before you totally avoid this place, trivia on Wednesday nights is a ton of fun. It's two hours of fun trivia action. There are plenty of prizes to win, and the categories can get pretty entertaining. There's also a drawing contest for the night and if you have the most creative drawing, you get points for your team. 

Trivia aside, this place wasn't great. They have great beers on draft but I couldn't find prices for them. Then when I found out the prices, they didn't match up to what I ordered (stone IPA I thought was seven and a hefe was five but I was charged 14). The bartender made me close the tab immediately, I asked if I could use the card while I sat down, implying about keeping it open. She said you can you just have to close with me. I don't understand why? Maybe they don't like open tabs. Could have been some miscommunication. She just seemed rude about it. 

Service was really terrible. I understand it's trivia night and there are plenty of people in the place but then you should have more people working. Fiancé ordered a burrito and it was supposed to come with chips. It didn't. She had to ask twice to get the chips. The second time the server asked her if she REALLY wanted the chips. Well hell, she paid for them and she's asked twice. What would you think? Also had to ask three times for a box. 

My enchilada was okay. I've gotten better at Roberto's but it wasn't bad. The rice was actually pretty good. Doesn't make up for the subpar service. 

I would come here again only for the trivia. And then I would probably pack beers in my car and go to Roberto's first to get some food. Just to avoid having to be served.

My experience was great. Before even knowing about this new joint downtown, I had Mexican corn on the cob from their booth at the Life is Beautiful Festival. Delish!! I planned to go back for another one in the second day of the festival, but my friend and I stumbled across the new Nacho Daddy restaurant just off Fremont St. before we entered the festival. We decided to eat lunch there instead, and it ended up being a great decision.

I had the street tacos, one of each kind (steak, chicken and pork) and the Mexican corn. The corn was just as good as I remembered, and the street tacos were amazing. My friend had the Nacho Average Burger Nachos and really enjoyed them. I also had the raspberry margarita, which is made with their agave nectar and homemade sweet and sour. It was very yummy!

The restaurant/bar had opened just a few weeks before. The decor and atmosphere are really nice, with a large bar separate from the dining area.

2.Southwestern Chicken Salad- this was good...
3.Beef Nachos- Full size was huge- but man thank goodness this was the BF's dish cause this looked like a heartattack waiting to happen...

I hate having to ask for the Corn Jalapeno Muffins - they should just be brought to each table. Isn't that the meaning of complimentary?

4259871,2013-03-30,0,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

If you love nachos, this is THE place for nachos. I'm not a health fanatic, but a real person who believes in exercise and moderation, so going to this place does not make me feel guilty- I do not have something like this everday. Some people love chocolate (my husband), some people love meat and potatoes (my older brother), and some people love nachos- yes, I AM that person. (Ok, I LOVE ice cream, too.) Ok, enough disclaimer, on to my review.
 
At the top of the menu, it reads ""Home of the Gourmet Nachos."" And I totally agree!
There were some interesting combinations (I'd like to try the thai nachos sometime), but the one we really wanted to try was the Enchilada Nachos- pulled chicken- very tender and seasoned perfectly, very cheesy, and well-topped with pickled jalapenos (I love medium-spicy). I'm a bit of nachos enthusiast, so I like when toppings are evenly distributed, just saying. I don't like when there are chunks of something, like sour cream or guacamole, in one spot only. 

Oops, I almost forgot to mention the mini jalapeno corn muffins- so warm, fresh and delicious!!! Now, that's a starter. And we did have the fried ice cream for dessert- talk about huge. I thought the nachos were over-the-top, but in a good way. Some of the chips were chocolate, and everything was topped with raspberry sauce, which I normally don't really like, but it sure worked here. Well, I had to stop because I was too full, and couldn't eat another bite. I don't think my husband wants to go anywhere else for nachos.  

So, we went here again, this time for lunch; the crowd is smaller, compared to dinner. We chose the pulled pork nachos- complete with a white cheese sauce, bbq sauce, and topped with fried onion strings. This is a combination that you wouldn't really picture with nachos. But the savory combination did work very well, indeed. I did think that the topper (fried onion strings) was very generous. 

Anyway, what I am trying to say, is that there are ten types of nachos here and it sure is fun trying new things. There is the appetizer version and the entree version for a couple dollars more (we always choose the entree version because we share it). I think the next time we will try the ""nacho average burger"" nachos.  

The decor is pretty casual. The servers are nice too. Clean place. Seats are booths as well as chairs & tables. The baby gets his own sling. All games are on the tvs (it's a sport bar), as well as videos for the music lovers. The womens bathroom (located up front) is unique, there are three different mirrored sinks, each with its own partition. But, since I am a new mommy, I did notice that there is no baby- changing station. Also, check out the picture booth, 2 strips is $2.00.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,8,1,4,fnuwS5hBrMfd3tapI4bCcw

I received attitude from the bartender from the jump. Giving dirty looks and being really short with me and my boyfriend when ordering our beers when we asked a simple question about our tab. Just really annoyed and short with us. 

The waitress was very nice but I ordered a burrito and it was supposed to come with a side of tortilla chips. When my food was dropped off by a food runner, I was missing my chips. I kept waiting for the waitress to come by to check on us, but she did not. So I flagged someone down and asked them nicely to relay the message or send the waitress our way. That did not work either. It was not until probably 30 minutes later, when the waitress topped by, I mentioned that I never received my chips. She looked at me and said ""do you actually still want them?"" YES! It was actually a factored in decision in why I chose the dish that I did. I am at a nacho place and I wanted some chips but I don't like soggy topped nacho chip dishes and I wanted to have some leftovers for lunch the next day. So I get a burrito that I can scoop with chips and save half of it for the next day. Yeah I want my chips! I also asked for a to-go box for the first time at that time. She dropped off the chips about 5 minutes later and I reminded her of the to-go box again. When she brought the check around, she even looked at me and went ""oh yeah, to-go box, I forgot that"" the moment she looked at me. I had to remind her again when she came to pick up our paid/signed bill slips and then she finally brought it. 

It was busy because of the trivia night. The actual dining area looked pretty dead and the bar area was packed. People were getting drinks and food all night. They really should have been better prepared. The waitress was nice, but never came around or was forgetful. The bartender was full of atitude everytime I had to interact with her.

We arrived with a group of five for dinner on a Friday night and we were seated promptly.  Our table ordered a few beers and sodas, but they were out of the first beer that I ordered.  So I ordered a different beer.  The waiter came back to tell me they were out of that too.  Ok...different tactic, let's order a soda.  He runs off, and then he's back again.  They are out of Dr. Pepper too.  At this point, I just ordered a water (which they had, yay!).  

We placed our orders, I chose the chicken enchiladas, which they did have, but the chicken was very dry and there was hardly any of it in the enchilada.  There wasn't much cheese on it either, so the whole thing was just really dry and it didn't have any flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the steak enchiladas, and they were delicious.  We had the chips and salsa appetizer (it's not free and on your table, you have to order it), but thanks to our Yelp Check In coupon, ours was free.  Because they were out of pretty much anything I ordered, they did offer me a free dessert and I ordered the S'Mores Nachos.  They were not good at all, just stay away from them.  It's literally a pile of chips on a plate covered in about a bag and a half of chocolate chips topped with mini marshmallows and then thrown under a broiler to burn the marshmallows.  The only saving grace was that someone else in our group ordered the deep fried ice cream and they put half of it on these terrible nachos which made them edible for a few bites. 

The best part of the night was the photo booth they have in the lobby/waiting area.  The boys were able to goof off before we were given a table and the pictures were great!",fw94lNhwRxeklb2ZKAFe2w,2,3,2,vUobqBurFQWxamOAqgCgQQ

We both got the special,  and let me tell you, those tortillas are magical. I am drooling thinking about them. The cheese was gooey and a perfect match. The carne asada was good, but nothing extraordinary.  It needed some sort of a special sauce though, like a spicy chipoltle mayo sauce, like the one Rubios uses on their gourmet taco.

I can forgive bad service in exchange for an offer of free dessert or no charge for a meal that was brought to the table wrong, but to not accept responsibility for the mistakes is poor service all around.

It's not that I didn't like the place originally - it had turned into a Chucky Cheese on the weekends since kids now eat free.  I had fond memories of the Cajun Nachos which I had there several times and absolutely loved.  The dish was the single reason I went back.  My friend and I sat in the bar area...no kids - perfect.  I presented the coupon as directed and the waitress came over quickly.  We ordered only waters and between that and the coupon, the waitress' demeanor turned frosty to say the least.  I open the menu and discover that the Cajun Nachos are gone from the menu.  Not one to let things like that ruin a good time, I found spicy shrimp nachos that sounded pretty darn good.  We decided on those and the BBQ Chicken Nachos.....entree size for both.  Waittress came back to take order and we ordered drinks (I had the Pamatini which was quite good).  Waittress's demeanor defrosted immediately and she was just fine the rest of the meal (except for the nacho issue....see below).  I can't say the same for the Nachos.  Shrimp was better but neither blew me away.  They say they make all the chips fresh and while I don't dispute that, I was NOT impressed with the chips at all.  They tasted kind of stale and got mushy FAST.  I have had tons of good to great nachos over the years...these didn't make that list at all.  Btw...I asked about the Cajun Nachos (they have both spicy shrimp and andouille sausage on the menu)...I got a blank stare from the waittress.  Surely something could have been thrown together in the kitchen?  Nachos aren't rocket science after all.  Her tip settled at a a flat 15% after that.  I usually go closer to 20%.  Apparently there is a new chef and the presentation of the nachos is totally different and the menu changed....not for the better.  Bottom line:  I won't be going back.

It looks like Nacho Daddy has achieved the impossible... they blended chips and cheese!! Actually since I wrote my initial review (rated them a 1) they have hired a new GM (#4?) who knows what he is doing, they have a new kitchen manager (# who knows) and have cut down the menu to a point where they can actually achieve a high level of execution. I think they have finally reached a level of competency in which a business can begin to win over customers and become successful. 

For this I will move them up to a 3 of 5... but that is because I still hold my breath when I walk in and order. I keep expecting them to mess up my order, but they seem to have a renewed energy and I think its because they are finally on the right track.

Lets be clear. The service was never the issue here. It was always that the Management staff (GM and Kitchen Manager) could never find a consistent formula that worked. Now that the issue seems to be solved the food is reflective and its worth giving them another chance.

 Its now save to eat the Nachos!!

Where to start? First off the wait was short, they quoted 10 minutes and it was barely 5. From there things only got better. From a big bowl of guacamole that was priced right and was made with fresh ingredients to hot chips that were replaced without fuss with more hot chips when we ran low, the appetizers were good. As I had my fiancee and my son with me we ordered a soft taco off the kids menu, a Supreme Tostada nacho for her, and Florentine Nachos for me. 

The only thing in our carry out bag when we left was the soft taco as it was huge and my son loved the rice and beans and was full on that before even making it to the taco. 

Both of our nachos were loaded, and when they were brought to the table we were impressed. You definitely get a good value here, and these nachos were good all the way to the bottom, you were not left wishing you had more cheese or toppings to scoop up at the end. The chips were thin and crisp but strong enough to hold a lot of toppings without breaking apart. The Supreme Tostada nachos is their classic take on a loaded traditional nacho plate, it is everything you would expect to find, done right. But the Florentine Nachos...when I read the menu I was skeptical. But anything with sun dried tomatoes, prosciutto, and asiago, romano, and parmesan is usually not going to be a disappointment and my plate was left empty when I was done. This is the stuff that has you thinking that trying to explore the rest of the menu on a return visit will be very hard to do! 

On and on I can go with this but the best part of our experience was the service. It was incredibly good. From start to finish, we were taken care of. My 3 year old ended up touching our server's arm by accident as he was reaching for his drink and I was like uh-oh. Unlike some places where the server would recoil and freak out if they didn't like kids that didn't happen here. With 2 different servers they made my son feel comfortable and treated him right and even picked up a toy he dropped. But my fiancee and I were taken care of too...again chips were replaced on time, tea was taken care of. It was the way it's supposed to be. 

I try and not just hand out 5 star reviews. I'm known for my Absolutely Not and Jackassery lists so calling it as I see it is something I've clearly established my ability to do. But based on how good the food was, coupled with hands down the very best service I've received in Las Vegas in the past 2 years, 5 Stars is most appropriate. And I can't wait to go back and am already telling others about this place.

We were promptly seated and served water while we debated on our drinks. Our order was taken quickly without any hiccups (so I'm not sure what the bad reviews are talking about)

I really do love their salsa because their hot is actually decently hot. I might have a slight addiction to spicy food so when I say I want it hot I mean it. We are OBSESSED with their fish tacos. No, I mean it. Go try them...like now.

I love that I can always catch up on any sports team while I am there because they do have so many screens around the dining and bar area.

The chili was pretty delicious as were the homemade chips.  The big problem with my nachos was the fact that there was little cheese to go with the chili and chips.  I had about ten chips left over with a decent amount of chili on the plate and nary a shred of cheese!  I want my nachos to be loaded with cheese!  These ones weren't.  The taco trio wasn't that great either.  The pork and chicken on them was a bit tough.  I think that Nacho Daddy is more of a place for a Happy Hour but in my opinion, it is not a place for dinner.  They have a fair amount of bottled beers as well as the usual drafts and even Delirium Tremens.

We had lunch at Nacho Daddy on a Monday.  It was a little busier than I thought it would be, but we got right in.  Our server immediately took our drink order and we got some chips with queso and salsa.  The ""medium"" salsa had almost no heat, I guess the mild is just ketchup.  Next time, we will get hot.  It mixed really well with the queso, which needed more peppers/onions.  I highly recommend mixing the salsa into the queso, they went well together.  You have to pay either $1 or $2 for salsa with the queso, which was annoying, but we would get it again.  Like I said, we would just go with the hotter version.

To eat, I had the lunch special, which is your choice of 2 tacos or enchiladas with rice and beans.  I think it was $8.29, I know it was less than $9.  It was a lot of food.  The mahi mahi taco was HUGE, but the fish was not seasoned.  It had nice grill marks on it, but lacked flavor.  Again, I found myself wanting more heat.  It's size and the number of ingredients made it difficult to eat.  The mango salsa was good, but not great.  The pork enchilada was tender and moist.  I would get the enchilada again.

The wife had a ground beef chimichanga, which was HUGE.  Even with me having a couple of bites, we brought home more than half.  It has a lot of sour cream and guac on top.  It has rice and beans inside, which was okay, but I would have preferred the interior be mixed more.  Some bites were all rice or all meat.  The ones with everything were great.  

We brought this home and cooked it the next day for lunch in our toaster oven.  I think it's the first time we have had fried food leftovers that got BETTER the second day.  I don't know why, but this thing was fantastic the next day, it improved like chili or a stew would.  I think next time we eat here we will get a chimichanga to go and split it the next day for dinner.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,0,0,3,dNzlSvTcWdZSvKSh59rHpQ

I can look past mistakes. Things happen. 

The low star rating is due to the fact that the food, really just isn't that good. We got the filet mignon nachos for the appetizer and the steak had little to no flavor.

Last night the ENTIRE group from work, all 15 of us decided to try Nacho Daddy. Not only did they fit us in, they made special accomodation for us in thier bar area which was smart considering our group has NO filters on our mouths.
 
We began with lots of cocktails and beers. The beers were ice cold and the pitchers of maragaritas were phenomenal. Mike, our serever who was a total doll made several suggestions to us and we didn't say no. The guacamole flight and the salsa flight was a perfect way to help us wash down our margaritas. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Nachos . . . and the Shrimp Diablo Nachos to continue snacking while we were all chatting and relaxing. 

What a perfect atmosphere, the music . .  televisions and the attentive staff. The managers came by to say hi and chat with us a bit, the chef, it was all pretty cool. 


We stayed long enough to go ahead and order some meals as well. I had an enchilda trio plate and I have not one complaint, other than I was getting stuffed. 

I will say this . . .  why bother going on Yelp to give 2's, 3's and 4's?? Either you like it, or you don't. All these BS, middle of the road . .  ""the chips were too thin"" garbage . . . ""but I enjoyed my company"" WHO CARES?????? All these wanna be food critics, stick to what is relevant  . .  PLEASE.

Bottom line on NACHO DADDY
Food- great and fair prices
Drinks- awesome and GREAT prices, wells are decent liquors
Atmosphere- very easy going and CLEAN (which is hugely important)
Service- Fantastic

Tons of toppings and the ability to create your own masterpiece is pretty freaking awesome. It seems the execution has a ways to go, but they are new so I'm hoping it will get better. 

Service for us was fabulous. Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and brought us samples of salsas and whatnot to try. 

The food was...just OK. I tried the nachos with the sundried tomatoes and spinach and chicken. An interesting take on nachos and fairly good. My husband came up with his dream combination but wasn't overly impressed with how it turned out. I'm having a hard time here because these are just nachos after all, and the toppings seemed to be of decent quality. I guess at a nacho place you just expect them to be the best nachos of your life - the nachos at Nacho Daddy are not. 

I tried a frozen margarita and it wasn't terrible - better than most of the slurpy style ones offered in Vegas. I wouldn't order it again (I'm spoiled from TX), but it's worth trying it you're into frozen margaritas. 

Overall we'll wait a few months and give it another shot. Service was great and the nachos have potential .",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,3,3,_RK8bC8a-IJsP-0VHa7YqA

I saw that there were mixed reviews on this and all I can say is to at least give it a try. A review is an opinion after all.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is a typical sports bar. Filled with multiple TVs. On this day it was perfect, since it was a Sunday = Football Day!! 

We decided to sit at the bar area. We were served by a lovely waitress. She was very friendly and always asked us if we needed anything. 

We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in offer of free salsa and chips. They brought us two types of ""colored"" chips and salsa (hot & medium). 

We ordered the VEGAN NACHOS. If your expecting nacho cheese sauce. Be prepared to be disappointed. It's basically chips placed on a hot skillet they topped with Crumbles of veggie patty, Daiya cheese, beans, corn, sautéed peppers and onions, guacamole and a small amount of green salsa. This nacho was DRY as hell! It seemed like they put everything together and then slapped it into the oven. The nachos stick together. Making it hard to pull apart.

Just when I thought the Nacho was dry. I was ""served"" the Driest Tex-Mex Burrito. Is there a shortage in sauce? I won't go into detail with it because no amount of sauce can make this taste good. It's like eating dry rice and beans. The sad thing is both Burrito and Nachos are not cheap. 

I did think the massive Bloody Mary bar was cool. Other than that I don't think I would come back unless my honey begs me to. Then maybe just maybe, I'll give in!",zjtQJ8eYWVedJpWB2sFB2g,8,8,2,Z24_UXydkk6rO-9YlM-wsg

I do not live very close to henderson, which is GREAT for my waistline because if I did - I'd be here every week.

The first time i went to Nacho Daddy was for brunch on sunday with my husband and we ordered the bacon & egg nachos. What an AWESOME concept - eggs on nachos!! The house made flour chips are thick, crispy and oh-so tasty!  The entire entree was the perfect ratio of crunch, gooey cheese, fluffy eggs, and tasty bacon.

I have also had the buffalo chicken nachos (subbed the chips for the flour chips because they're awesome), Nacho Average Burger Nachos, the spicy shrimp nachos, and the hubby ordered the country fried steak nachos and the BBQ chicken nachos.

While a fan of the buffalo chicken the others were good but not AS good. Hubby liked the C.F. Steak nachos (not for me - I'm not a fan of the gravy) but said the BBQ chicken nachos had a tang to it that he wasn't excited about.

BUT it's the bacon & egg nachos that we keep coming back for. They are only available on the brunch menu (which I believe is now available 7 days a week 9-2??) but they are definitely worth driving 11 miles for.

The service is great, the atmosphere is awesome and I really like the layout and the outside patio. If I lived closer this would definitely be a place I'd watch the morning football games.

I had the cheese enchiladas, and tried both the green and red salsas (no mole, unfortunately). Both were good. The ""poco de gallo"" contained tomatoes that appeared to be roasted with chipotle peppers (a guess- it's the same flavor they used in roasting the corn).

First off we were pleasently greated by every waitress and hostess.    Once we were seated we looked at the menu and drooled over each and every nacho choice.  based on the reviews we were expecting poorly made nachos and processed cheese on our BBQ pulled pork nachos.  Instead they came with crisp, lightly salted chips and an excellent melted cheese sauce.  The flavor was perfect and the pork was very tender.  We also ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos.  The beans and rice were bland but the fish tacos were excellent if slightly underseasoned.  The children's menu is extensive and offers a huge bean and rice burrito, quesadillas, and tacos to go with the usual hot dog and burger fare.  

We loved the Blue Berrymore martini.  The waitress was Caitlin was very attentive and kept our drinks filled.  All in all, we were very impressed with this economical and tasty meal and will definitely put it into our rotation.

Update: 9/7/2012  - We have since been back and once again had an excellent experience.  Further, we have received notice that the Nacho Daddy management does in fact read the reviews and strives to improve the experience for all so if you are one of those who had a negative experience a few months ago, please give them another shot as they are working very hard to address the concerns and make this place the best Nacho experience!",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,4,0,4,MbIyuQDrDEuUQin54eFYeg
5586789,2011-07-15,2,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"CJ, a manager, had contacted me and asked me to call him about my experiences. We chatted and I said I would give them another try. 

Amy recognized me (good or bad, I was impressed) and made no bones about apologizing for that first night and expressing her hope that this time would be different. We shared pleasantries and my guests and I bellied up to the bar for our meal.

CJ introduced himself, offered to make us some drinks, and seemed on a mission to make the perfect blackberry margarita. He didn't fail; the drink was great! Fresh and fruity, he made it with muddled blackberries and fresh limes (no mixes!). It was delicious.

Guacamole Flight - The chipotle had the bite to it that I was hoping for (chipotle, duh?) but it was undercut by too much acid. It challenged what should have been a yummy chipotle smokiness. The plain guacamole was just that, plain, and the mango was plain with mango chunks thrown in. Edible, but I was hoping for more ingenuity, flavor. We tried a little salt in to pop it a bit, but no go. The texture of all three was perfect, so credit where it's due.

Salad: Caesar. Sysco? It didn't taste like a house made dressing. Meh.

The BBQ nachos came out as a small size when he ordered the large. They fixed it quickly. My friend really enjoyed the combination and found it to be tasty and well executed. I liked the BBQ sauce but thought it needed more cheese. That said, the flavors were good and the chicken was tender. A good dish.

Florentine nachos. I was skeptical about the cheese sauce; I tried it before and found it supremely disappointing. CJ gave us a small ramikin of it with some chips and we loved it. The cheese was perfect, the prosciutto was crispy, the spinach chips were fresh, and it all worked together very well. I even took my leftovers home and fed them to friends. I don't really do leftovers, much less nachos, but these were worth sharing that night. 

The chicken sandwich was a bit on the dry side, but overall it was a decent, basic, grilled chicken sandwich. The sweet potato fries really made my friend happy. 

The service was great. Friendly, quick with the drink refills, and extremely helpful if anything was needed. We really were very well taken care of.

Full disclosure: We were well into our entrees when CJ mentioned he was going to buy our entrees (we covered the rest). It was appreciated. It was a welcome combination of excellent service, tasty food, and - yes, I checked - clean and stocked bathrooms! While there were some standout points, I am still hesitant to give too many stars... not everyone will have this experience, and as much as it was appreciated and very good, it's not the daily M.O.

***
I knew it would be a singular and special visit if I was to be waited on by the manager. Balance, fairness and *reality* are key, so I did go in and see him... but I also went again as a ""regular"" customer.
***

Amy recognized me right away. After I was seated, our waitress, Sam, immediately came over and took my drink order. As recommended, I tried the red sangria. She said it was not as sweet as some sangrias but fruit came on the side. The (small!) glass came packed with ice, garnished with lemon and lime wedges. So, slightly sweetened red wine over ice. It wasn't a bad drink, per se; but it wasn't a good sangria. The citrus helped, but I wanted more fruit, depth, and, yes, more actual drink.

We opted instead for a pitcher of the blackberry margaritas. Just as I remembered them, sweet but not too sweet, freshly made, and packed with real fruit. Score!

The chips were a bit too oily and needed salt, which we added. Still, they were good, hot, freshly made and crisp.

Dinner: Sonoran Dog sans bun or beans. We got the hot dog, wrapped in bacon (crispy! yay!), on a plate with ramikins of cheese, mayo, mustard, and diced tomatoes. My avocado-lime ""salsita"" (*great* kick to it!) was missing and had to be requested. Suggestion: replace the bun with lettuce and create the dish as you would with a bun. The presentation fell flat and, because it wasn't constructed, the flavors, too, were missing something. The veggies (instead of fries) were fabulous! Corn, onions, and peppers well roasted and seasoned. Best thing here so far!

The coconut flan was generously portioned, creamy, and the caramel sauce was very, very good. Rich and flavorful, it was perfect.

And, yes, we checked...the bathrooms needed attention. Once I commented on it, they were better, but far from good, clean, and well stocked.

The ""entertainment"" wasn't. It was unfunny, way too loud, prohibitive to conversation, and, for a family place on a Thursday, rude and inappropriate.

***
Overall? I commend them for their efforts, but it's still ""Meh, I've experienced better."" Amy, CJ, and Sam are amazing, and there are some rare menu highlights, but I am just not excited about it.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,4,3,2,OAIHVJ6SRRujndwOfd5EmQ

This was my second time in a more everyday setting:  happy hour on a Thursday night with three of my gal pals. We arrived by 5:30pm with half an hour to spare to get our cheap eats and drinks going.  Nerds that we are, my friends and I had already studied the menu online, so we had 99% confidence in our order hours before we arrived.  I knew I was getting the 2-for-$4 street taco deal(chicken, even though I'm reaching my chicken limit these days), and the Mexican-style corn on the cob (elote), plus one margarita, because that's really all I can handle for alcohol.  I figured that would be a fairly safe and healthy meal for dinner considering I was going to avoid rice, tortillas, and chips.  Well, I was disappointed in my street tacos.  I know they're supposed to be smaller, but there really was not that much chicken in them and no way am I going to reach my protein quota with those-not even 3 ounces between the two of them.  The corn on the cob, though, was muy delicioso!!  It's one ear of corn per order, cut in half.  I could have had two more orders, at least--who cares if the stuff gets stuck in your teeth?  I would return just for that.  Service was meh--no one really came to check on us once the food was delivered, which is always frustrating when your mouth is on fire (not mine) and/or you need to order more beverages, alcoholic or otherwise; I mean, we were sitting in the bar, after all.  I don't go to happy hours on the regular, but since this place is in Henderson and it's convenient for after work with many of my friends, I'll come back for more corn and maybe another adult beverage.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,4,3,mrAfWJZJ2RoqK6jIBGj3vA

Angie, you are an asset to this establishment. The nachos were wonderful, and I will be back because of your awesome customer service. Nacho Daddy will be on my list of frequent places to grab a bite. Thank you!

My BF and Inwent there on a Wednesday areoundn8pm and there were only about four other people in the restaurant. We were sat and starting looking at all the delicious nacho options on the menu. We decided to split the Enchilada nachos, street tacos - one shrimp, one chicken and one Carne asada and the tortilla soup. The only issue is that by the time we decided what we wanted we still had  not been greeted and it had been about fifteen minutes or so. After the server finally came over she was very apologetic and gave us free chips, salsa, and guacamole. She also comped our drinks - nice recovery. The tortilla soup was amazing - super flavorful with great balance of chicken, broth and tortilla strips, the best I have had in a really long time. The tacos were ok - carne asada was a little chewy, fried shrimp was good but the flavor was overtaken by the tortilla and the chicken was average. Now the nachos - GREAT! I loved the way that each bite had stuff on it, I hate when restaurants put everything on the top so when you get to the bottom you just have a pile of chips. We even had stuff left over and used some of the chips from the chips and salsa. I also liked how the nachos were served on a skillet keeping the hot and crispy for longer.

5691477,2014-04-17,2,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"I just had my second trip to Nacho Daddy a couple days ago and love this place. 

Me and my friend and elite yelper Allison came here with her hubby for lunch. There was no wait and were seated immediately. The waitress was prompt in getting our drink orders. I ordered just water and she got diet. The water tasted just like funky Vegas water, not filtered. 

I got Mexican corn as an appetizer and Allison ordered bottomless chips and salsa. I didn't know what to expect for the corn, but I was seriously underestimating it. It was so flipping delicious! It had cheese, cilantro, chili pepper (?), and lemon. Oh man it was worth EVERY penny! It comes with 2 smallish cut ears. The salsa for the chips and salsa is tasty. I liked the flavor of the mild better, but the spice to the medium is perfect.

Allison got the bbq pork nachos on my recommendation, as that is what I had last time. Joel got a chimichanga (I think chicken). I wanted to try something different so I got the Buffalo chicken nachos. The bbq pulled pork nachos are so good, that when our food arrived I was having buyer's remorse. However, the Buffalo chicken nachos were pretty good. There seemed to be a little too much Buffalo sauce on the nachos, so my nose was running and that's all I could taste. The nachos also have white queso, but again it was drowned out by the Buffalo sauce. The chicken was well cooked and plentiful, so I wasn't wishing there was more. I love the added celery garnish on top. It was very fitting.

For my appetizer and meal with no soda/alcohol was just about $14. The lunch nachos are around $7 so not too bad. Overall, I love the food here. It is a different take on traditional nachos for sure. The only change I would recommend to the restaurant is to invest a very small amount of money into getting filtered water. Vegas water tastes nasty! It is low cost and makes for happier customers. It is a large restaurant and plenty of room for larger parties. Come here and try for yourself.",JUhShbFDEDZYrcJcpoHPDQ,4,2,4,KdyDV_baEXK0Us6sRIWYbA

Second visit today I tried the Ceviche and it was a bit of a disappointment, For $10.95 - there was probably only about 3-4 shrimp chopped in the roughly 1-1.5 cup portion, and the the jalapenos were chopped way to large so it was too hot.

They have a ton of really unique nacho options but honestly none really sounded that great. Settled on this one w shrimp and some spicy cream sauce. We also shared the coconut chicken tenders. Both were pretty mediocre. Chips looked homemade but were kind of hard and I didn't notice any kind of cream sauce on top so it was very dry. The nachos were pretty much just chips w a fair amount of shrimp sauteed in I'm assuming the mentioned cream sauce and some kind of white cheese melted and hardened onto the chips. 
Coconut chicken might've been good if they had seasoned the chicken before coating it. As is, it really had no taste and the Thai citrus sauce was bland as well.

And, while it is not prepared or served tableside, the guac dished up here is very good, has a nice slight kick to it, and is served with somewhat unusual homemade White Corn Tortillas.  In fact, the guacamole tasted like it had been stone ground--only in the back of the restaurant. 

Spicy Shrimp Nachos were very spicy, which befits their title.  BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos had a nice sweet barbecue sauce clinging to them.  And, Build Your Own Bacon Yellow Queso Nachos were lathered with mild cheese and smokey Applewood Bacon.  But, for me the hit of the night were Supreme Tostada Nachos,  which were really laden with stuff: yellow cheese, tomatoes, ground beef, a few jalapenos, refritos, Green Onions, and salsa.  I barely finished the whole platter.

But lest you think you can handle more than one platter of nachos here by yourself, I suggest you don't even try.  Besides my platter of Supreme Tostada Nachos, I only sampled the other just described varieties ordered by my fellow diners.  They are all called ""appetizers,"" but that moniker is only appropriate for four sharing souls.  Otherwise, for just one or two hungry diners these massive platters of fried tortilla chips groaning under the weight of piled on cheese and other ingredients are without a doubt main dishes in their own right. 

There were a couple of discordant notes.  The kitchen was all out of Southwestern Soup, and the men's restroom was not properly maintained.

We had been charged for chips and salsa even though we gave our server the yelp check-in incentive for free chips and salsa (btw, what Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?) we had some bar drinks that were $5 and some that were $11 (server didn't tell us about happy hour when we ordered or that some drinks would be discounted and not others), we had charges for sauce even though the ladies who asked for queso instead of red or green sauce on their enchiladas weren't told it would be an additional charge, and of course there was the surprise charge for extra rice for the guest who asked for only rice, no beans with her meal. 

I have never been charged so carelessly by a restaurant. Although the the manager did comp the two meals that came out cold, this experience was so awful that I can not recommend this restaurant.  The icing on the cake was the booth were were seated in had dirty seats, food on the floor and was situated by a high top table that two of us knocked into getting in and out of our seats. 

Don't bother trying this place. It's over priced, offers poor food quality, isn't clean and the staff isn't trained in guest service.",JJJecMgVM-Vu-VTD9CocJA,0,0,2,Dec5VUe7lwUBin2ZePBitQ

Being 1/2 the menu is dedicated to nachos and the like, I went with that on both visits. Personally, the buffalo nachos were kind of a let down as the chicken was soggy and doused with some low grade hot sauce while the Cajun nachos were pretty awesome. Service was solid both time but could be a bit slow at times.

Not only are the nachos better, but the happy hour and daily special prices are great.  For happy hour the ceviche is delicious and they have their house margarita BOGO with good beer prices as well.  Also Megan is still there and very helpful, although when the bar area is busy she ends up with too many tables for any one server, but she manages to still get around pretty frequently.

But let's talk about TACO and TEQUILA Tuesday.  Tuesdays this place gets 5 stars.  BOGO on tequila all night any brand, and this place has dozens of tequilas, my friend Alex is into tequila the way some guys are into scotch and loves the quality of several of their offerings.  And the street tacos which are corn tortillas made on site with high quality meat and served with salsa, are 3 for $3.33 or 10 for $10.  I could eat these every week and never be sick of them, the pork are the best, pulled meat with salsa and feta cheese on top.",P7Gzueku0UJHfN5pBciDeg,4,1,4,XJE4apreJ4U4PV7MPnUKDg

Service was an issue from the beginning. Since we weren't ready to order, we waited way too long for our server to return to take our order. We needed plates for the nachos since we were sharing. After I asked for plates, we never got them so I went to the bar to ask for them.
For dessert we shared the churro sundae, which was very good but served on the wrong kind of plate so it was melting all over.

Great service (Terra K) and the food was delicious.  My wife had the Carne Asada Tacos which were large with thick but light and flaky tortillas.  I opted for nachos since this is their primary draw.  Had the Supreme Taco Nachos and the ingrediants were top notch.  Normally you get more chips than toppings but not here, I had good stuff until the end.  Chose the hot salsa which was good but not on fire, I would call it gringo hot, but if you are from the midwest you might want to choose a more mild version.

Although not necessary we thougt we would split a dessert and chose the Flan.  Very good and just about right for 2 people that have just stuffed themselves.

5915241,2014-04-24,9,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"So this place has been bookmarked on my Yelp account for the longest time. Last week we just happened to be in the area (which is rare) so I jumped at the opportunity to give this place a try. 
The joint was filled and had a 20+ min wait for restaurant seating. Since patience is not one of my virtues, we decided to sit at the bar. The hostess gladly seated us at the bar and were quickly handed off to our waiter. No complaints on the staff at all. We got great service and honest opinions on what to get when asked. 

Similar to my theory about Juan's.. If they have a dish in their name; you get the dish. So naturally we got nachos.

We decided on the tostada nachos (strongly recommended by our server) and the filet mignon quesadilla. 

The mignon quesadilla was the first thing to come out. It was a dcent portion but man it was greasy. Taste like the deep fried quesadillas like from On the Border. Just too much grease to be able to enjoy it without keeling over from artery blockage. 

Price/portion wise this is a killer deal! The pan was loaded to the brim with overflowing colors of ingredients. The chips were toasted nicely and the dish was heated thoroughly, no cold spots in the middle (I hate that!).  
I was not a big fan of the queso/velveeta-esque cheese sauce.I was almost like watery 7-11 pump cheese.  I would have preferred if it was just shredded cheese. It was tolerable when mixed with the rest of the toppings but when it was by itself it was blah.The dish was not bad but I would have enjoyed it much more without the ""cheese sauce"".. 

To me, the best part of the nachos were the hidden bits of the Serrano chiles in the salsa that kicked my taste buds ninja style. I wish I could have had the salsa and chips by itself.


I really wanted to love this place but it was a bit too greasy and the queso/velveeta-esque cheese sauce was a buzzkill for me. I don't think that we are done with this place as we have yet to try the wild side of the menu. I just know that the next time we come I will request for just shredded cheese on the nachos.

I felt compelled to write my first review on any restaurant from my experience tonight.
First off, my taco salad was horrible but I didn't complain & just ate the rest of my husbands burrito which was good.
Upon arriving home I couldn't locate my cell phone so I called Nacho Daddy's to see if I left it there. They said they did not have it. We used the locating device to find it & it showed it was there. When calling Nacho Daddy's back & telling them that we located it there, of course then they found it. This was approx 45 minutes after leaving the restaurant. What an awful experience! Yes, I shouldn't have left my phone on the table but they have some dishonest employees.

Nearly two years later, we returned for trivia night and it was a much better experience. Bordering on 4 stars, but not quite. 

We arrived around 6:30 for trivia that starts at 7. One of the great things about this place, unlike other places in town that host trivia is that they allow you reserve tables. That's awesome. Service was incredibly slow as trivia got underway. Understandable since they were pretty busy, but honestly, if the restaurant knows they get busier on these days they need to staff accordingly. We decided to share some Nachos Florentine and they were so much better than our previous visit to Nacho Daddy. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were nice, but I still wish they would spread out the toppings better so that you're not left with tons of plain chips on the bottom of the stack. I appreciate all the different nacho offerings. They are quite creative. 

Service was slow throughout, albeit friendly. We won trivia that evening, which was a blast, so we'll be back next week to spend out $50 in winnings. Hopefully I can try some of their other offerings.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,8,3,IcMTltpcx8YrWgplLOZtxw

5979855,2011-02-07,0,vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,"The first time we went it was around 10pm and not too busy. There were a few other parties in the restaurant and it was generally quiet. Our waiter had energy and was friendly and attentive. We took two orders of nachos, the Buffalo Hot and the standard kind just to be safe. It took far too long for our order to come out, somewhere around 45 or 50 minutes. Considering how un-busy it was (most restaurants in the area close kitchens at 10pm and Nacho Daddy is an exception closing the kitchen at 11pm) I was not pleased. However when the food arrived we were so hungry and it was delicious enough that it was worth the wait. The standard nachos we got were a little boring (naturally) and the Buffalo Hot was unlike anything we'd had before, just awesome! All in all we decided we would return.

This evening we decided to reward ourselves after a long day with another plate of those Buffalo Hot Nachos and some regular 6 pc. Buffalo Wings at Nacho Daddy. We walk in and there's no apparent hostess but everyone seems to be chatting at the bar sitting around. After a moment or two, they notice us awkwardly waiting to be noticed and someone comes over to seat us offering us ""anywhere you'd like is fine!"" with a smile. Dining area is empty except for one couple. We sit and our waitress comes out perky and nervous to do well. She takes our drinks and complete order and returns timely enough throughout the evening to check up on us, she did great on that part. Not so great on refilling our drinks or clearing our plates/finished appetizer basket. Order for the nachos came out really late again, this time they were cold even (although the waitress told us to watch out because the plate was hot? hahaha which may or may not have been true, we didn't care enough to check.) The nachos were all soft where they were cheesed and the cheese was starting to get solid again. We  ended up not finishing them because things aren't really appetizing when they're melted and then solidify again. There was a lot more to be disappointed about this evening but I'm not really bent up over all of it so it's not worth mentioning. The only heartbreaking part was our Not-So-Hot Nachos. Which, I really like the Buffalo Hot but after this I don't think it's worth going back again even if I do get a craving for them.

Hopefully things get figured out and it isn't a Chef Ramsay intervention that wills customers back in a year from now.
They're not THAT bad but, it was slow business-wise both times we went in and somehow the food was coming out slow. I mean, even if they ARE really good when they're hot, they're still nachos, does it take that long to put them together?
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house. If i'm wrong about them not being made in house then I'm sorry and they didn't look all nice and thick and bubbly (or taste) like regular fresh made chips that I'm familiar with. (Maybe they're frozen and then dunked to fry, idk.) And I'm not even really expecting this from them, but just suggesting that it would be really cool to get fresh, made to order, homestyle tortilla chips, especially when the place is called Nacho Daddy. I feel like THAT would be totally worth 10 or 15 bucks and a 40 minute wait. Assuming they're warm this time.",-Cm0UFJ2ks2_XgvVtTqMVA,0,0,2,48GwETlv2U9Mm79f2Oo6Tg
