578653,2012-03-07,0,Ltx8EbTGiUlWLzZeoCzBXQ,I went back and forth in picking 2 or 3 stars.   I used them last winter and was happy.   They fixed my heat upstairs. It costs 200 for a 20 min job.   Then a few weeks ago my downstairs heater when out.-same symptoms but turned out to be a different part but same 20 minute fix.   Now the charge is 320.00 dollars.  I did a little search online and found that it should have been another 200 job.   So bottom line is that they did fix my issue but excessively charged for it.   I wasn't home to authorize the job (had a friend do it) so I called and talked to someone about it the next day thinking maybe the tech had over charged me...  All I got was a bunch a vague answers to my questions.,OL46KV2TYmj0ZlPF_TzZJA,1,0,2,-5th21h3aHfO4kDMdxjRuw

He tried to charge me $479, a job other companies do for a quarter of his price. My Dad brought me a check and almost had another heart attack yelling at Travis. I have Lupus. I medically can not handle the heat. Travis did agree to a price of $130. While I appreciate him doing the right thing in the end, I don't appreciate him trying to take advantage of me because I'm chronically ill and need my air conditioner to work.",rJn51gJQtSgw1TAqkB0o6w,1,0,1,WjVBWblc3RljvpWb6XGLjQ

Turns out it was nowhere near as bad as made out to be, and when it does go it's actually half the cost that Larson quoted. These guys are a rip off!

712516,2010-01-16,0,Ltx8EbTGiUlWLzZeoCzBXQ,"For all of you Yelpers who need heat or air conditioning repair, please read this review ! This happens all to often. We rely on repair personal to help us with our needs, and they take advantage of us because we don't know any better.
My heat went out around the holidays just recently.  I was freezing and going out of town the next day.  I looked up Larson Air in the yellow pages because I didn't see any reviews on Yelp.  They weren't busy because they came out right away.  In fact the guy that answered the phone was all to happy to have at least one job, mine, that day.  He almost seemed desperate. Red Flag !!!! He also told me that they have a $68.00 service fee just for coming out.  But they credit $30.00 of that fee IF you use them to do the repair.  Sound suspicious? Yes it is.  Any company who tries to railroad you into using them to repair is up to no good. Red Flag!  And the guy that came didn't seem like he knew what he was doing.  While he was up in my attic, I asked him what brand of heating unit it was, and his response was, ""I don't know"".  Ok so he's right next to the unit, and if he can read, he should be able to identify the brand of unit.  Nope.  So I made my way up the ladder poked my head in the attic, and noticed the paperwork nailed to one of the beams right next to his head.  Yes I had to identify the unit brand because this guy was to stupid to be able to do that.  Another Red Flag!
While I was up there, I asked him what was wrong with it.  His response, ""Well, I think it's this heat coil"".  You think? You think? Another Red Flag!!! Ok, so how much is that part?  Well, the part is about $150.00 and then the labor.  So after he gets on the phone with the manager, he comes back in and tells me it will be almost $300.00 to fix it.  I ask him if there's a guarantee that is the problem, and he told me well no.  Another Red Flag!!!! So I proceed to tell him I am going to have another company come out and give me an estimate.  His demeanor totally changed.  He seemed angry and told me well the heat will probably work now off and on so the other company will tell you there's nothing wrong.  Another Red Flag!  Lets see, how many red flags are we up to with this company? Bu Bye!
Sun Country Heating and Cooling came highly recommended on Angies List.  I was on the phone with them before this yo yo even left.  They give FREE Second Opinions.  Yes FREE!  They came out in about an hour and a half.  Immediately I could tell this guy knew what he was doing.  They were up in the attic for about half an hour doing diagnostics, and then they came down and said some Bla bla needed cleaning. Well, they didn't use the word Bla Bla.  I just can't remember what the part was.  They cleaned it and it's been working ever since.  So I asked them how much I owe for their services.  Guess what they said? No really guess.  NOTHING!  I tried to get them to charge me for coming out and helping me and they would not accept any money.  Can you believe it? People this is a true testimony to my experience. Please don't be railroaded by dishonest companies.  Use your instincts, do your homework and be happy.  Thank you Sun Country Heating & Cooling.

2775619,2015-06-02,0,Ltx8EbTGiUlWLzZeoCzBXQ,"I recently had them out to perform a pre-summer maintenance check on my units. The repair man told me one unit was dead and the other one was on it's way out. I could repair the dead one for $4000 or replace it for $7000. He said he disconnected the dead unit to spare my power bill because it would run constantly and only blow out hot.  I sat on it for a bit and called another company who came over yesterday. He connected the unit and it works perfectly. Blows nice and cold. 
I doubt my A/C unit repaired itself so I can only assume Larson Air was trying to rip me off. Dirty pool guys.

I got through the summer with both of my 'dead' units working just fine and blowing cold air.

2947143,2012-05-05,0,Ltx8EbTGiUlWLzZeoCzBXQ,"I fell for their pressure sale.  I bought a groupon for a air-conditioner tune up.  The tech (Douglas) showed up and told my wife there were problems with both air conditioners, one needed a Dual Run Capacitor (found online for under $30) and the other needed a 4 ton hard start kit (found online for under $40).  Douglas told me if I didn't replace the capacitor the air conditioner would go out, and if I didn't add a 4 ton hard start kit, that air-conditioner would go out too.  I was at work and could be there to see what was going on.  I paid the $298.00 to replace the capacitor, and $233.00 (another $34.00 groupon charge since there were 2 air-conditioners) to add the 4 ton hard start kit.  Now that I paid everything, I do the research to find out I was ripped out.
I am amazed that rip-off places like Larson still exist.  I hope this review and other's help someone else in time to go to a reliable heating and air-conditioning company.",Nk4ZhONyh09XEUC6gEw1gA,4,0,1,qG93cFtRPIL6Lqc6F5P3jw

4235906,2017-02-19,0,Ltx8EbTGiUlWLzZeoCzBXQ,"AGAIN I WILL REPEAT, STAY AWAY FROM LARSON AIR. TRAVIS and HIS COMPANY ARE SCAMMERS and RIP-OFFS.

Well I see Travis you wait until 2017 to answer everyone that posted in 2016-2015-2014.
Just to let you know, we DID in fact let the new owners know about the A/C problem. And gave them the name of HVAC CONNECTIONS if they should have problems and to never call Larson Air. And not that it is any of your business but they contracted to take the house with no repairs required because they knew we were being honest with them...so it was not a big deal for us to tell them so or not. 
BUT, WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT SINCE THE OTHER GREAT COMPANY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~HVAC CONNECTIONS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THAT CAME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT at no extra charge~~~~ NO THANKS TO YOU. THE PART IS HOLDING UP WELL. He felt so bad that we were scammed by Larson that he only charged us $100.00.
Your guy did not clean anything, replace wires or any of the garbage you posted. He wasn't up there long enough. He was barely up there long enough to replace the part. BOTH TIMES.

We kept the first one he took down because we wanted to call around and found that you over priced the part by 3X the RETAIL price. Retails for $40-$50 as we called around and you charged $127. And you refunded me $200.00 cause you knew you put in either a used capacitor and it was going to blow again or you knew I was going to call the news to do a shame on you and I still should have anyway.

Get with the program Travis.....dishonest businesses are being found out all the time these days and you are no different. You'll either get it and get with the honesty (hopefully not to late in your time) or you will sink.

BTW, DON'T LIE.....we never asked for the cheapest repair....we never asked for anything other than to give us cold air again.
But I notice as I read other reviews on here....more and more people are learning about your scams. Sorry if your that desperate that you need to LIE, CHEAT and MANIPULATE. 
Eric B never said he paid you $4000 or $7000, he said that is what you wanted to rip him off for. But I guess everyone should ask Eric what the magic is because another company plugged his in and it worked fine and probably still is. That is why he called you dirty pool. 
Because he was smart enough not to pay your DIRTY POOL price of $4000 or $7000 for NOTHING. And who gives you permission to disconnect someones unit without asking them first. THAT IS NOT YOUR JOB. YOUR JOB is TO DO WHAT IS ASKED OF YOU!

IMO the Larson family of Larson Air has no place in this valley.",qX4wbcm4n6-xKzFwfSgK9g,1,0,1,-D4wLmjdIC5YdJRlFhHCcA
