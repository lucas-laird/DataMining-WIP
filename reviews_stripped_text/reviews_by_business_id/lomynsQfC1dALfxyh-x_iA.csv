Bathrooms were absolutely freezing, I guess because Ac is on very high with all their windows open.  Maybe just turn it off at nigh?

The food was pretty horrible but what should we expect at 12:30 am. Went after work had food and drinks. 
Giving it a 2 star because a lot of bars are smoking bars this is a open bar so the bar is open    with access to a nice patio. 

Ordered nachos with steak when the nachos came out the portion size who was decent a large amount of chips with a good amount of protein!
 I was soon disappointed when the lack of cheese!
 They literally had like no cheese there was a small dollop of Chipotle cheddar cheese sauce on the bottom! Of the whole stack of nacho chips which is really weird cuz that means you have to eat your way to the cheese sauce.

Then ordered would seem to sound delicious mozzarella pesto Burger was clearly not that delicious.
Not well executed mozzarella sticks were delicious didn't go with the burger Testa was blend Burger was Bland no seasoning in the meat.
Ordered a side of onion rings as well as fries both not lukewarm at best onion rings very weird they're not rings but sliver of battered fried onion.

 They have an area to play darts as well as a couple other games that I'm not familiar with, but I'm sure if I had enough of the happy hour drinks I would probably be able to Get the hang of them.

The bartender, let me sit there for about five minutes while she chatted with the waitress. ""What can I get you?"" she finally said, in a curt way that suggested I was bothering her.

It was lunchtime and in we went.  The wait was worth it.  The staff was very friendly, the menu was big enough to satisfy just about anyone, and the beer selection is impressive.  For the beer enthusiasts out there, the selection of draft beer is only about a third of that at the original location, but that means there are still almost 50 to choose from, and an equally impressive selection of bottled beer.

Here's what we ate:  my wife enjoyed the Fried Mozz Burger with onion rings and I had the Prime Rib Melt with slaw.  Both were delicious.  In addition to a very attentive waitress, the chef came out to ask how our food was, and the manager swung by the table to see if there was anything else we might need.

Then there are TVs...placed all over the place so that no matter where you sit, you can see at least one screen well.  If you're a sports fan, this is one of those places you might call a home away from home.  By the way, if you're a UFC fan, this is a feature sport for both PKWY Tavern locations.

If you're a beer drinker, there's a loyalty program that lets you earn points and win cool stuff from discounted beer after so many purchases and a custom/personal mug, overtime you can even win some really nice high-dollar items as a reward for your loyalty.  Check that out too!

As with all things at Tivoli Village, there's ample parking underground so your car stays cool.  If you're there for something and you find it's time for a meal (or snack), stop in and give PKWY Tavern a try!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,5,4,4,h40dyB220s_VEOV_C-sERw

The new location of PKWY had high hopes for me since it was closer to my house and always has a large draft beer selection.  But this location didn't live up to the hype. The prices are high (similar to Yard House) and although they advertise about having ""500"" beers, they really only have 30 (good, but hyperbolic).  And then the 2 I ordered were out.  As far as a sports bar goes PKWY has plenty of TVs, a large outdoor area when the weather is right, and a much less rowdy crowd than the other location.  I will be back since it's close but the place itself, from the food to the drink selection, is nothing to get too hyped up about.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,NikAE9nl14fpoSbhqRUV7g

There was a family that was sitting in the foyer area (away from the bar portion which is restricted to 21 and over, even for food). They  looked like sad outcasts from Survivor.  They were not having a good time, and did not appear to be attended to, or given any food.  Nevertheless, I came in my dress suit before a business meeting that I was having a little later that afternoon in Tivoli Village so I thought I'd grab a burger for lunch so my stomach wouldn't make noises during my meeting. Reasonable proposition, don't you think?

Stood at the front lectern where it says to ""wait to be seated"" for like 10 minutes, and even though the server saw me from the bar where she was standing, and there was only 1 guest there (who had a drink in front of him), she did not greet me or do anything. I really wanted that burger or I would have left! 

Finally, she shouts over at me, ""Find your own seat and sit down.""

Not the most courteous or professional, but I was hungry, so I sat.

And then, NOTHING. She did not come over. at. all. She seemed to head at one point towards my direction with what appeared to be a menu in her hand a few minutes later, but then turned around and went the other way.

I told myself, I would give it 5 more minutes, and if she still did not come over to greet me, hand me a menu, or at least ask me what I wanted to drink (and yes, I was parched!), I would leave.

It's in a strip mall that is top notch in Summerlin. Walked into joint and sat at bar. The bartender, Shawn waited on us and made our experiance a night to remember. I had a glass of wine and my man had a beer at first. Asked Shawn how long the place has been there and he, himself has been there. Made small take and felt right at home. 

Went on to order food. The foooood...The food Is something indiscribable. We ordered jalapenio cheddar eggrolls AMAZING and Poutine Tater Tots. That too was Rockin. Can't wait to try other favs on their menu

The work staff was attentive and made us feel like we were regulars. Offered samples of mixed drinks to show their mixology talent and it was such a night to remember.

We are truly a fan of this place and the team behind it.  We will 100% be back again.

If you like chill, laid back, good food and drinks, this is for sure youre spot.

I will say they have a much more extensive menu than the previous restaurant, but the quality isn't the same. This is definitely a ""chain restaurant"" quality food.

I had the Southwest Cobb Salad, it was so bland and the fried chicken was way way overcooked, I really did not care for the tomatoes at all either. They are a roasted tomatoes and really threw off the tastes and textures for me. Salad was very large but was just a whole lot of lettuce, very little as far as toppings except the chicken that was inedible.
My husband had the Prime Rib Sandwich and he said his was pretty good. Wish I would have ordered one instead of my salad.
They do have an all day breakfast menu that looked pretty good.....maybe for my next visit.
Service was excellent, very attentive and personable. One of the managers came by to check on us and he gave us the run down on their ""Scorpion Hot Wing Challenge"".

The restaurant itself was nice. They definitely take pride in supporting local UNLV Rebels. That was pretty cool. I enjoyed all of the cool decorations on the walls in the entrance. I admit I am a sports fan, so that was the first plus.

We were greeted and seated by a extremely pleasant host. I noted the restaurant was extremely clean given the rain and amount of people in there. 

Our waitress could have been friendlier and her service was lacking to say the least. If we needed something she appeared annoyed, which in turn, of course annoyed me more!! She messed my order up on my salad with the dressing on the side request. She said, "" It's mixed in there already"" I  politley reminded her that I wanted it on the side. She looked at me like ""Oh well!""  

I wasn't about to let her ruin my family meal anymore than she already had. So I let it go and let her tip reflect my dissatisfaction with her. My review lost a star as well due to her lack of care and consideration  toward paying customers. She is representing  this establishment for what they offer, as far as customer satisfaction goes In my opinion.

My Caesar  salad  with chicken breast was really good despite the above mentioned error. Family reported their food was delicious also.

We signed up for their rewards program early on when we first sat down. I really was looking forward to this being a place we may frequent since we live close by. I noticed on their app a free t-shirt came with our participation. That was pretty cool! Asking the waitress about it was not. She said that could wait till after the meal!! When she dropped the check off she never mentioned the t-shirt.

I noticed the manager walking by and flagged her down for our shirts. Super friendly manager. She asked what sizes and quickly got them with no problems. On the way out I did let her know of my displeasure with the service or lack of. She apologised in a very sincere manner. That meant alot to us.

-Spinach Dip $8.95 Hands down the best item ordered. The dip was nice and hot and I enjoyed every bite of parmesan cheese consumed!!!

-Jalapeño Popper Egg Rolls $8.95 Cheesy is an understatement for these egg rolls. That was okay but definitely a heavy appetizer. I was hoping for more Jalapeño and cream cheese but it was barely there. The grape dipping sauce was delicious though!!! 
-Margherita Pizza $9.95 The pizza was okay for the place of course I've had better but it will definitely fill you up of your hungry.

Next time I'll definitely sample some beer because that's clearly what this place is known for.",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,4,2,5,TcXHDyrUMvtv6yWMreHK5Q

We decided to give this place another shot last night when Leticia's was closing and we still wanted a few more drinks. After last night, I'm just convinced the service will never get better. I've never had good service here and now they're 0/3 on rude, slow service. Table service had ended so we had to order through the bartender and bring our drinks back to the table which was no big deal. What was a big deal was the bartender action when one of the girls in our group went up to order 3 waters. He acknowledged her order for 3 waters and went on to what she thought was making them and started serving other guests. She stood there long enough observing him and he clearly showcased he wasn't going to get her waters. Not sure if he felt bothered bc they weren't purchased drinks or if he quickly forgot about them but he continued to walk past her never looking her direction. There were two bartenders working last night, a short one and a tall one (both men), and the tall one was the one ignoring her. Finally the other bartender asked her what she would like and he made her our waters. She tipped him $3 for the 3 waters and finally came back to our table.

I don't know why I'm still surprised at the lack of service there. They had a decent Wed night crowd with mostly a younger crowd, similar to PKWY Flamingo. He made eye contact with her, agreed to her water request and never went back. When beers were purchased the service was fine but they don't seem to care about hydrating while dehydrating on alcohol.",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,1,0,1,TCvs9gzqqIemcd-0JGE-pQ

My first impressions were outstanding service and a pleasant atmosphere.  Drinks are always on point at PKWY Tavern.  So tonight I sat at the bar and had Shawn as my bartender very fast, friendly and personable.   I ordered the Chilaquiles and I have to admit it was the best dish I've had at a PKWY Tavern. Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. 

Since then I've been back numerous occasions and am working my way thru the menu.  The promos during games are 1/2 off appetizers and the beer selection is great. The PKWY tavern app is another way to be in the know on upcoming events and promos.

The staff here is very accommodating waitresses Erica and Alyssa, bartenders JB and Shawn all are engaged in their customers the manager even made a point of visiting every patron in the place.  

Whether you want to catch a game, play a game, watch UFC or just relax at the bar or patio PKWY tavern has something for everyone.

Grey goose vodka specials, and half price appetizers for the games.  Had the fried mozzarella!  Was excellent.  Also had the WTF fries, and they were just so so.

For lunch I had the sliders and they were amazing.  Comes with fries and three sliders.  Very reasonably priced!  Bartenders were on point and drinks were always filled.  Patrons were all cool and met some good dudes at the bar.

Any avid beer drinker can still appreciate the wide array of beers offered here. If you want to get competitive about it, you can join Pkwy's free loyalty program, TEAM, where you can log your beers for prizes and street cred. There's always cheap beer specials being offered and during football season, happy hour drinks/food are available during games.

Vegan wise, I don't see much offered on the menu so when I come to Pkwy it's strictly to drink. Personally, I think this location is best for catching up with friends around a table (so happy I can actually sit down and relax!). There's a few board games here and darts too. If you're looking for a more raucous and/or younger crowd, the location on Flamingo is better suited for you.

My party of 3 walked in and the hostess greeted us right away and asked if we wanted an indoor or outdoor-table, I saw a patio area that looked nice and asked if that is where we would be seated and she said yes. She ended up taking us to a completely different patio area and sat us within arms length of a ping pong table and a view of a wall. We right away asked if we can be switched inside since we did not want to be so close to a ping pong table while we are eating dinner, and the hostess seemed a bit bothered by our request. We sat down and not to long after our sever came over. I asked for a drink menu and our server seemed really annoyed by that. I ordered pulled pork sliders with a soda and the other two in my party ordered Southern Chicken Sliders with a beer. The beer came a little while after but my soda never came. I waited about 20 minutes before we flagged someone down to get my soda.  The food took a long time and was brought out by another server. We noticed our meals did not come with the sauce that it stated on the menu, and it took a while but we flagged down our server to get the sauce, napkins, and utensils that we didn't have. Our meals were ok. I didn't hate it but I also didn't like it. We finished our drinks pretty fast and was never offered a refill, actually once our food was dropped our server never came to our table besides the one time we flagged her down. We asked another server for a to-go box and she never brought it. We waited with empty drinks and empty plates for a REALLY long time. Our server walked by a few times but never stopped. We tried to get her attention a few times but it seemed like she was trying not to look at our table. We noticed the two tables around us having the same issue. I honestly don't think anyone would have noticed if we walked out but we finally found someone that look like a manager. We explained to her that we have been waiting and we would like our bill and a to-go box. She gave us 25% off for waiting and gave us our bill. Unfortunately, we needed change. We put the money on top of the bill and set it at the end of our table for someone to grab. We waited 15 minutes and no one came by to take our money. At this point between my party of 3 we managed to find exact change for our bill and put it on the table and left.  I would give a one star but gave two for the manager giving us the small discount. I won't be coming back after this experience. It seemed like every staff member we came across was super bothered by anything we asked for. When I mentioned I was hoping for a refill on my drink the manager made a comment about how there is a water jug on our table. I wasn't drinking water, I had paid for a soda.

I decided to eat at the bar and after asking for recommendations, ordered the Sunday morning pizza. It was served with burnt edges. After I pointed this out, my server offered to have it remade. Since I was starving, I declined. She also said that the cook's response would be, it's not burned on the bottom. OK??? Grrrrr. It was a big pizza for the price and it was pretty good even with the burnt edges.
