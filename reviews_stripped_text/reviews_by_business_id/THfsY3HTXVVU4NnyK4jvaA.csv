Wow. I've lived in Arkansas and grew up in the south a bit and had some amazing pulled pork sandwiches and this one was up there. Great flavors and just the right amount of smoke. 

Came back about a week later and had the pulled pork again , I know boring but so good. Owner is there in this night and brought out his signature style smoked wings that he prepared ""special "" for me and the boys. I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of wings so to speak. I have to admit , these were probably top five all time and creeping top 3. The smokiness , the perfect amount of sauce and that crispy skin , oh my heavens. Been craving these ever since and I will be going Monday , 6/12/17 lol. 

Finally got my wings and they were fantastic. The owners are great and are so kind. Becoming a regular spot for me and a couple friends. Great prices , and always super fresh.",LBV0c_eYzt6_HQMSGUEZHw,0,0,5,Bz6ya_aoEspXYeNquGElrQ

976045,2018-02-05,0,THfsY3HTXVVU4NnyK4jvaA,"Ok...it's a 'food truck' that has a delivery option. That alone is pretty cool but it gets better. 
It was Super Bowl Sunday in Vegas and I was stuck in a conference until after kick off so I was already resigned to being stuck in the Rio hotel for the game. I was worried about a food truck delivering to begin with but the reviews for the food were so good, I wanted to try it. So I ordered while I was sitting in the conference and then went upstairs to watch the game in my room. 
The delivery driver called me BEFORE the delivery time that they quoted me which was extra impressive on game day. 

So the food...I got the smoked buffalo wings and the 5-bone ribs with fries. I started with the wings and when I opened the box and took a bite of the first one, it was still so (temperature) hot that it burned the top of my mouth. After getting over that, these were some of the best wings I've had. It was different than the traditional fried buffalo-sauced wing, but still close enough that it wasn't like eating a grilled wing. The best of both worlds and delicious! 
Next I started on the fries. They were also hit and delicious, but to be honest I didn't want to fill up on fries. That s not the star of the show. So I moved on to the ribs. 
So, these ribs weren't exactly like the ribs I'm used to back in North Carolina bbq country, but judging them for what they are 'Las Vegas bbq', they were excellent. The bbq sauce/pan drippings  that they put in the box with it was good. It. It wasn't what I'd call bbq sauce but great nonetheless. 
It was probably too much food but that meant I had leftovers for the second half of the game!
Ultimately, I was very happy that I chose this instead of the food in the hotel restaurants.",DxLHrCKiaWOHxBMDPGvuCQ,1,1,5,tl9squG1nUzc0R1_lcfVQA

They called and texted me consistently while I waited for my food.   They were very kind and apologetic about something they really couldn't control.  I suggest if you want delivery don't order after 10pm because the crowds be jumping and one small fender bender could mess up the traffic flow and delay your food.  And yes that can happen any time of day.  

Also because of security I had to meet the delivery guy outside.  That wasn't bad considering they are still willing to come here even though security doesn't allow them to come in the building.  

I must say although the food wasn't hot it was still very good.  I appreciate Mrs. Rice being so patient and helpful even though the situation was out of their control.  And the delivery service was friendly also!

Now, with that said, I order here generally every two weeks or so and almost always get the rack of ribs. The meat is tender and juicy and always fresh, never frozen.

He is kind, courteous, and as others have already said, passionate about his food and his business.  I only give 4 stars because the delivery process may not always be consistent.

The chicken wings were for lunch the next day (so stop calling me a pig). They were nicely done. Flavor seems to be a strong suit for this food truck. 

I had a side order of the baked beans. Can't say as I'll order them again. Maybe they shouldn't be considered baked beans. May well be my fault. But overall, I really like them.

1893071,2017-05-06,9,THfsY3HTXVVU4NnyK4jvaA,"I drove by several times before I decided to check this place out- Vegas is not known for having great BBQ, and parking your truck in a lot by a strip club wasn't exactly a ringing endorsement for great eats. But their smoked meats are damn good.

WINGS: 10 big meaty wings for $12. They're smoked for flavor with your choice of sauce. The BBQ + Buffalo combo was a nice spicy-sweet combo that I really enjoyed. I'd get these again as my meal, they were so good.
RIBS: Nicely priced at $12 for 5 big thick bones, served with fries. The sauce they use is a little sweeter than I usually prefer but was still pretty good. These ribs were full of flavor and a huge portion size for the price. Very tender, nice pull.
BRISKET SANDWICH: THe real test for me, a Texan. I specifically requested a thicker marbled cut, and got it, thankfully. The sando is piled with an ample amount of meat and typically served with sauce and coleslaw, which I got on the side. The meat itself is good and the sandwich held up well with a sturdy pretzel roll bun. I would prefer the option to have white bread, pickles, and onions, but that may just be personal preference.

Pricing is really good for the portion sizes and quality you get, likely because they lack overhead by being a truck. Hours are open late on weekends, and if you call/text ahead you'll get a discount. We'll be back for sure.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,11,4,kBqeGiSej-ChqrWK1b6aYg

Well , got home and sandwiches were brisket instead of pork and not very tasty .  My son said it tasted like teriyaki sauce instead of bbq .  The pretzel bun was over toasted almost burnt .  The ribs were soggy like they had been sitting in water all night , not like juicy from being cooked properly .  The wings were good size , but unfortunately cooked just a little too much also .

Order came within 25 minutes-5* delivery rating.
Plenty of food for 2-4 people. Since there were 2 of us-we have leftovers.

Ordered:
Pork Ribs: 5* fall off the bone delicious and meaty!
Brisket Sandwich-3* much smaller in portion than the picture depicts..maybe due to delivery? Was just ok a bit dry.
Chicken Wings: 5* way better than any fried wing drowned in sauce...you could even eat them plain!
Potato Salad: 3* though many people love, I found it to be heavily seasoned with what I believe is cilantro and I leave that for my Mexican food. Really a matter of taste in this one.
Cucumber Salad: 4* again, matter of taste and I think it needed a wee bit more seasoning.
Fries: 5* crisp l, hot, well seasoned and didn't look like they were the last of the barrel :-)
Overall an excellent choice for BBQ and I highly recommend!

Among all of the Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese restaurants, there are a few non-Asian gems such as Rincon de Buenos Aires and Urban Crawfish Station. When I spotted Mr. Ribs & Mrs. Rice recently in a Gentleman's Club parking lot, I was cautiously excited. My family and I often get powerful barbecue cravings, and that usually means a journey north to Famous Dave's. 

The fire engine red BBQ trailer setup is very eye catching, and I couldn't wait to check it out. Glad I did! After reading the mostly positive Yelp reviews, I made up my mind to give it a go on a Friday night. I could see from the inclusion of Mediterranean menu items that this wasn't a case of a Memphis, Kansas City or Austin transplant setting up shop with their family recipes in Vegas. I am Greek American, so I kinda figured that this was instead a case of a talented immigrant restaurateur applying their skills towards a popular American cuisine like you see all the time in my home town of New York. The owner Mike is a super friendly guy, and you can see that he has put a ton of passion and hard work into this venture. The result is a culinary home run. 

I ordered a full rack of St Louis style ribs, a medium size order of jumbo wings, and the potato salad. Mike kindly threw in an order of french fries on the house. The young women that work for him are super friendly, and the fare is absolutely delicious. The quality of the ingredients, the recipes, the slow-cook technique and the very fair prices make this a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and I will return often.

I ordered online. Then found out after I ate it... It's a roach coach (food truck) next to a strip club.

You're eating strip club food. Nasty! 

The meats are saturated in Gluten and Monosodium Glutamate marinade. Of course, if you ask,  the owner will pretend not to know what Gluten or MSG is.

Spent about $60 only to have thrown away everything except the rack of ribs that I'm tolerating to eat so I'm not COMPELTELY wasting everything. Let's start from the beginning. Anyone who knows me at all knows the love I have for ribs. I've seen this place a lot and today my cravings for ribs were so strong I had to try it, see what all these reviews are talking about. The little sauces in the little containers were $1 each lmao. Come on now ???

First thing I noticed
The BBQ chicken plate was a MESS. 
The rice looked WEIRD, like it didn't belong in the plate! Not fresh rice perhaps? And the taste??? SOUR. I'm not even going to bring up the beans.

Second thing I noticed
The ""potato salad""..........
They should really call it ONION SALAD because the ONE BITE I took made me VOMIT. The ONLY thing I tasted was ONIONS. As if I bit into one. 

And lastly. The rack of ribs. I ordered honey bbq ribs. Tasted more sour than sweet. It was not fall off the bone and that was the biggest disappointment.

to each it's own. I'm glad I tried it with just my husband and I, before my family came up & I recommended this place for all of us. They would've been disappointed in me. Lol. 

It's so hard to find a good BBQ & island food place out here. Nothing beats the food places in Hawaii  food made with LOVE & ALOHA can never go wrong. Maybe do a survey & test your food with random people to better your cooks.",UCpNBr3pKF1OqdBmVzjjLw,1,0,1,Hjdj8ZVWu3RG7Yzc4SWQhQ
