109596,2010-01-12,1,DgCAM01n2Qo5DsoKj_zkug,"Checked this place out on Saturday night and left unimpressed.  The place was pretty empty but we were still seated in the very back corner by the kitchen (all the customers were seated against the far wall which felt a bit strange).  After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes for the waitress to come by to take our order.  Throughout dinner, the waitresses were all huddled around the sushi bar chatting with the sushi chefs, and they seemed annoyed any time they needed to check on their customers.  Plus, the music was blasting so loud all night that I could barely have a conversation.

The non-sushi menu is limited and has only the basic chicken teriyaki, etc.  Also, there weren't any combo plates like other places offer.  I ordered a couple of rolls and they were fine (the spicy tuna was actually ok) but they were all covered in not so great sauces that were too salty or sour.  The chicken teriyaki came out on a huge plate and was all breast meat...however, the chicken was very very bland (the chicken appeared steamed and later topped with a little sauce and a pile of green onions).

Next time, we'll stick with I Love Sushi...better sushi, better non-sushi, and better prices.  Plus, much better service.",yB7V5yP1tmz2Q3AWlUdyeA,0,0,2,zDlWDJU5brPcLuHJzFhOBQ

Loved: The bacon wrapped scallops were really good, the yakitori was prefect, also tried fresh wasabi for the first time and won't eat anything else now. The noodle bowl was good but the ginger was overpowering, not bad, just make sure you like ginger.

Tried the Jalapeno yellow-tail and spicy tuna roll, not bad for someone who doesn't eat raw fish.

The biggest problem with the night we went was the service, they are restructuring the menu and staff so there was a lot of confusion with prices and what things were available or not, but it was almost comical and won't change me opinion of going back.

For most this might be a turn off but i kinda liked the 140bpm Japanese  techno music in the background, made you want to put your hands in the air and wave them like you just need more Saki.",pabMYegF28KjHQ5hybAJ0A,1,1,4,691NOWdgHxZ01Tp-YRAHSw

If McDonald's where serving sushi , it would have to be better than the dung sandwich i was served here. They try to fool you by showing this impressive selection of rolls, all with clever names, but they all have the same items in them, eel, Salmon ,crab, and a sauce. deep fried. 
The soft shell crab I ordered had a beer batter on it. I am not kidding , like it was a cheap onion ring. The salmon eggs must have came from a bait shop, they had no flavor, and I hope to hell I'm not going to vomit them through my nose tonight. The topper was when I ordered Toro, It was light green with a funny slime on it. I told the waiter i didn't want to die today and sent it back, and asked for the check.

If I had seen the reviews from late 2008, I probably would have continued on to Claim Jumper as planned.  Fortunately, they have gotten their act together it seems, and they are now offering a $27.95 AYCE option (which drew us in).  The AYCE covers the full menu including kitchen food and dessert ( sashimi excluded), and it's pretty solid in the roll department.  Usually I just get a bunch of nigiri, but tonight we were in the mood for rolls, and the Warm Springs and Sexy Girl rolls were both very good.

2207337,2009-08-29,0,DgCAM01n2Qo5DsoKj_zkug,"THIS IS ""MY SUSHI RESTAURANT"" IN HENDERSON (AND MY SON, TRISTAN'S, TOO)
It is a sign o' the times when you roll up to your favorite sushi bar and there's a big ole sticker on it saying they are closed for good. (We arrived at that place at the same time as two guys did and they were expecting to use their full punch cards for FREE sushi! Double bummer for them!) 

Necessity being the mother of invention and the stepmother of exploration, we set out to find our next favorite sushi spot. We had just moved near the intersection of Green Valley and Warm Springs and had seen the banners outside the Ka and since it is literally one mile walking distance to our front door, we thought to check it out. And MAN were we glad we did! It has become our favorite All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) sushi places in Vegas. 

From reading the past Yelp reviews spanning the last two years it sounds like this place has gone through some serious changes. You can see the date on this review. I have no clue what it was like before (when there were booths?) or what the other management or chefs were like back then. All I can comment on is what's going on in the Summer of '09, and my report is very favorable. 

To begin with, the atmosphere is nicer than most sushi places in Vegas. The sushi bar itself is a large square with seating in three full sides which means there is plenty of sushi bar seating available. (I much prefer this over the sushi bars that are just one long side with the sushi chefs standing behind it.) The one thing that drives me nuts about the sushi bar is that it is two tiered so that there is about an 8 inch ledge close to you that is flat to put your plate on. But there is a 6 inch ledge that is about an inch higher and it is slanted down towards you where you might think to put your drink or soy sauce concoction BUT DON'T: shit slides off of there all the time! Everything spills up there so it makes that space almost useless. 

The music is loud enough to listen to but not too loud to have a normal discussion. It is definitely not my kind of music nor any kind of music that I'd associate with a sushi bar, but the employees seem to love it and it doesn't bother us at all. 

The sushi chefs are very good. Their engrish is not very good, but then my Japanese is limited to ""donttouchmymoustache"" and ""Hai!"" and the various sushi fish names, so we're a good match. They are totally turned on by my girlfriend (she's a tall blondie), but they serve us kick-ass sushi so I'm cool with them checking her out while we're scarfing down all the raw fish that we can. 

The list of rolls is as long and creative as it gets. Some sushi places really like to go for it when they name their rolls, and The Ka is one of those places. Rolls with names like ""Sexy Girl (Taste Like My Ex-Girlfriend)"" and ""I Love My Ass."" Our favorite is definitely the Warm Springs Roll. The most creative roll is the Yummy Crispy roll (which really isn't a roll but mini-sushi-tostadas). If you're doing the AYCE (and why the hell wouldn't you be???) then check out the Yummy Crispy for a very unique roll that most people would like the taste and texture of. It comes in three different pieces so it's easy to split up. My 11 y/o son's favorite roll is the Tempura Roll, and if you're into fried rolls, I would have to give it a thumbs up. For variety, they have a good selection of cooked rolls (the Baked Salmon Roll is my fav). The one roll that the three of us do not like was the Baked Lobster Roll. The roll itself was nothing special and the texture of the lobster was not very good. 

My favorite fish is sake (salmon) and it has been very good the several times that we've visited. The White Tuna was very surprisingly good. The Cajun Albacore is only very slightly seared, which is the way I like it. My GF is pretty picky about her raw fish and she gives this place a big thumbs up. 

The Cucumber Salad is a big portion so if you're doing the AYCE I highly recommend you share it between 2-3 people. The edemame is properly prepared and nicely salted. 

We love mochi (ice cream in a rice-based coating) and they have both coffee and mango which are our two favorites. I think it's very odd that they only bring out one mochi per person when a regular order is for two. One extra piece of mochi per person is not going to cost them hardly anything especially when we could have eaten a couple more orders of nigiri at no extra charge. Still, the mochi is fresh and the cut it into quarters to make it easier to share. 

In Vegas in 2008-2009 the All You Can Eat sushi going price is about $23 for dinner. The Ka is $28, but for us it is worth the extra few bucks. They do have Happy Hour and Late Night specials (2-for-1 drinks) if you're interested. (I hate to fill up on any liquid when I'm going to stuff my gullet with expensive raw fish and expandable rice.) 

BIGGEST COMPLAINT: I really wish they had a STAMP CARD for a free dinner after 8-10 purchased. GET WITH THE TIMES!!!",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,2,0,5,jaqW2ZUC28u03VtaHr3pNQ

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!!! :(  and thats not a good thing!!! Unfortunately, i believe this place has gone WAY DOWN HILL!!!! The ONLY reason this place even gets two starts still is because of Brian and Kathy, and the other two cool server guys! 

They got a new ""head chef"" he SUCKS!!! Is trying to save $$ and is skimping on things.. no more crab on the cucumber salad, one one bowl of edamame per table or they charge (which one is enough for us, but come on!) They changed their menu and took off some amazing rolls (thanks new head chef) they just really lost a lot of what they had going on that made them what they are! 

So, like i said, 1 star for Brian (which he is at another sushi restaurant so i think going and seeing him there these days is a better bet) and Kathy... but the loss of 3 stars is for the lack of great sushi and the DUMB ASS NEW HEAD CHEF!!!!!!!!!!! 

All i have to say to him is........ GO RUIN SOMEONE ELSE'S SUSHI RESTAURANT NOT MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Which by the looks of B.K.'s review he might have done just that?? I didnt know they've been closed for days?? I will have to call Brian and see what's going on, ill post when i find out!!

All you can eat sushi in the middle of the desert, three chefs, seats at the bar, fresh fish, an innovative, funny menu. I was absolutely blown away. I didn't even give Masa in NYC five stars (I gave it two), but Ka Sushi is getting 5 stars.

I mean, this was incredible! I've never seen or heard of half the cool rolls that they had on the menu. I managed to put down 6 rolls and a full sapporo before having to call it quits. The Warm Springs Roll was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my entire life. I didn't want to stop eating, everything was so good. I haven't looked forward to going back to a restaurant so much since I went to Firefly for the first time.

The ONLY downside is that they'll charge you for leftovers if you don't eat everything. We didn't get charged since it was our first time and the place wasn't very busy, but they did mention the rule.

3322081,2008-04-29,1,DgCAM01n2Qo5DsoKj_zkug,"I went to this restaurant last night - at the recommendation of my co-worker and his sister. His sister lives in Las Vegas near Red Rock, yet she admits despite the 4 restaurant places near her house, she will drive almost half an hour to this establishment. She says it's ""that good."" 

It is, indeed. They have new and creative sushi rolls with interesting and funny names to complement their rolls. One of them is called the ""New York Steak roll"". (Don't worry it's cooked.) We had to send it back to because one of our other co-workers did not read the ingredients and he is allergic to shellfish. So we had to get one without the crab. The servers were more than willing to oblige and didn't do any eye-roll or make any indication that they were inconvenienced. 

As for the funny names, I know my friend and his sister ordered the ""I Love My Ass"" roll, and ""Sexy Girl (Tastes like my ex-girlfriend)"" roll. I tasted both of them and they were equally good. I on the other hand ordered ""Jimmy's special"" and the ""Something Wrong #69"" Roll. I actually like the ""I Love My Ass"" roll and the ""something Wrong #69"" roll. The ""something wrong #69"" came with ""screaming orgasm"" sauce. LOL. However, I'm sure someone I know would order the ""New Sunset roll (DOUBLE D)"" simply based on the name. (Double D)... pssh... 

ANYWAY, the 4 of us had a GREAT time at this establishment. Despite our noise level and laughing, no one came to us to tell us to quiet down. The decor is pretty modern, upscale looking. You end up being surprised that this place is affordable and in a strip-mall type place. I also like the fact that if you ever wanted to take a date, it's dark enough for the ambiance if you get a booth.

As for dessert, I had the Tempura Ice cream. I just wanted to try it, but it was better than I expected. It was Green tea ice cream in tempura and fried. Then they cut it into quarters. It's a pretty decent size to split between two people. Our co worker who was allergic to the shellfish wasn't sure if he wanted to get mochi or green tea ice cream - both of which he never had. Our coworker decided on ordering the green tea ice cream, but our server said he would bring him samples of the mochi for the guy to try (he gave one strawberry and one vanilla - both cut into quarters). It was even decorated!! It was an excellent looking sample - if I didn't know, I would've thought that it was a regular dessert. We thought that was above and beyond what the server needed to do. Of course, we all tipped our server well.

This is the best service I've had in ANY sushi place, and will DEFINITELY go back to the establishment before my week in Vegas is over. My co-worker and his sister frequent this place and say that the service is consistently excellent. All the staff is nice and accommodating. I definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers. They also have ""regular"" food for those who don't want sushi, but want to go and hang w/ a friend while they eat sushi. They also have the standard rolls as well.

Also, they are all COVERED in sauce... what are you trying to hide Ka? Non fresh fish? The imitation crab meat you use? Steak roll was just ok.. I've had steak sushi rolls with filet meat, so it's hard to compare their rib meat to a filet. 

Bottom line.. it's good, but not great. Roll selection is amazing, and fish seemed fresh, but it's honestly hard to tell when every roll is dripping in sauce.

The second time we came without a restaurant.com certificate, that was how much we liked this place the first time.  We went so I could try the all you can eat sushi.

Also, my husband's chicken came out undercooked.  We alerted one of the 100 wait staff they had and they took it away, and did not bring a new one for over 30 minutes.  We also got constantly bugged by 10 different people asking if they could get us more beer, and didn't really want to help us with the problems with the food.  

It was such a terrible experience that we won't be going back there.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,1,1,2,GCTVuBcDZZolh8ND4KSwWA

The service was okay/good.  They did miss one of our friend's order and miss my two requests for some hotter tea.  I ordered tea and it came out warm and little did I know that I was being charged for it! Anyway, the Udon was good and a little on the sweet side.  It was in a broth that I have never had with Udon before.  Their spicy tuna was good, but not the best I have ever tasted.  The lasagna roll was nothing special. The agedashi tofu was good, but not great.

Nothing that stood out except the names of the dishes....... some that little children should not be reading!",xzvTed9al7cOEc0S57kb3w,0,0,3,LgGyvuRYG1i_6f4RLL5XcQ
