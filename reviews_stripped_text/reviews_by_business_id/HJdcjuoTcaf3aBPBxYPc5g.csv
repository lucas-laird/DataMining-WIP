Second time around I had the chili Frank plate and that was good too! Being from Hawaii, this did takes me back to the islands :) Will definitely go back for both!",6PLxQyfqgOkbOj3evNiC9g,1,1,5,gpSoDz-rPTkVKvF8ULx6XA
1617480,2017-01-29,12,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,"A food truck stationed right outside of a bar- it's genius.  I don't hang out at said bar, but Ono's is walking distance from my house so I forsee a lasting relationship.

They're currently in soft opening so the menu is a bit limited, but they feature plate meals (~$10) with curry, chili, bbq chicken, etc and sides of rice and mac, as well as musubis with spam and portuguese sausage. The prices seem reasonable and the portions are good, and everything is made fresh.

EDIT: Dropping a star. I don't know what's going on. Their posted hours have been removed and it's hit or miss whether they'll be closed for weeks or open three days in a row for lunch. Is this a business or a hobby?",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,21,3,vX3i6m2ryzf8y_Pf9KwNqA
2081497,2017-11-20,0,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,"I ordered the Korean chicken. It's overpriced, small portion, bland, and not good. This place sucks. ITS NOT ONO!!! I would not recommend that you order the Korean chicken. I will try another dish next time. If it's the same then this place is just not worth going to. Crappy Hawaiian food I've had in a long time.

2288378,2017-04-12,0,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,I went tot the farmers market for the first time this Sunday. The chicken from the truck smelled soooo good I just had to grab something. I tried the mini teriyaki bowl and I regretted it. I should have gotten the large!! I ate the mini so fast it didn't even make sense. I'll be back next week for the large!,XWyrqgF-BlVjg8289RCXoA,0,0,4,PM2lD_SGZQXuXBJcjDPq6g
2810258,2018-04-21,0,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,Maybe I caught him on a off day but I was expecting so much much more after reading previous reviews. My bbq chicken and my daughters was burnt. The teri beef and chicken curry was good but everything else was meh. Its worth trying if your in the area not worth driving more then 5 miles for. Hopefully one day we will have a Hawaiian joint open as good as Island flavor in the Summerlin area.,NAlxhRJMWsQQhTXjxvVSQw,0,0,3,DNxTnNNqzdjgTxeeN1Z4iw
3274017,2017-03-22,1,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,"I am completely in love with their chicken katsu and their masubi. They super friendly, professional and knowledgeable about what they're  offering. I remember the first night I had their I just died and wanted more but I didn't have much money to get another. I want to try their chili that they were telling me about cause I love me some chili. I plan on coming to them this Friday for their chicken katsu. I'm just a walking distance away from them. Hopefully I can try everything from their menu.

3650193,2017-02-24,1,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,From an islander who lives in Las Vegas this place brought me back home with just one bite. I will forever recommend this spot and forever love this spot. The love and compassion these men have for their customers is true Islander way and Islander style. Keep up the good work boys! Mahalo,qNOaal7vvfBzE6ye-9EfyA,1,1,5,N0nkpc9e2bjvQYVH4-xR-g

All were excellent in taste. It is really good for a lunch wagon. It takes time so I recommend that you call ahead for your order through the bar's phone number.",hMh9r-pOrNV0FT0uV_h81w,0,0,4,XOiXyYPSiCT9Ipl98_-PRA

5803972,2017-04-27,0,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,I ordered 2 plates and was very disappointed with them I ordered a mix plate and when I opened it it looked like a mini plate. I then opened the sweet sour spare ribs plate to find that the ribs and pineapple were cooked for far too long that it became just mush. I'm sorry I understand just starting a business and making ends meet but serving me sub standard food at full price is a no go. I am from hawaii and support any business with hawaii ties. But I felt like I got ripped off big time. I can't see going  back anytime soon,jilicVPjjAcK8TcBIYen2w,0,0,1,iQq4Bsx1on0MZT2kY2i3mQ
5967466,2017-03-10,6,HJdcjuoTcaf3aBPBxYPc5g,"I really can't understand the 4 & 5 stars for this food truck. Maybe I got them on an off day or maybe when it comes to Hawaiian food I am very critical because I'm from the islands. Either way, after taking 3 bites my stomach sent my brain a message that said if you continue to eat, I'll make your night a living hell. I ordered the korean chicken plate and my friend got a fried saimin plate. She had to stop eating because she said her noodles were spicy. Never have I ever heard of or had spicy fried noodles, so our theory is that they used the same cooking utensils for each dish and didn't clean it off in between touching separate items. She too couldn't eat all her food. I've eaten at various Hawaiian food places and this is not one that will be on my list to go back too.

Now for the service. The young man that helped was courteous and nice. There was a little elderly lady that came up to ask for food and I offered to buy her some. She asked for coffee but he stated they didn't have any so after I paid I went into 7-11 to go get her some. When I came back the ordering window was closed and she told me the Asian guy kept yelling at her to leave. Whoa whoa whoa. Not kewl, especially if you say you're from Hawaii. Where's your hospitality? Aloha spirit? So we waited and waited and waited for our food. I was the first person there, the young guy opened up the window a few minutes after I arrived and probably only because I asked him what time they were supposed to be open. They advertise 10am but this my second time coming around lunch time and the truck was closed. This time he had the side door open which is why I asked. But back to the wait, so apparently there were 2 orders in front of me because people ordered in the bar? So beware when you go because even though you may be the only person at the truck, there may be other orders delaying yours from patrons in the bar.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,10,5,1,ncm0GhQQKVrygJCtU0yWFg
