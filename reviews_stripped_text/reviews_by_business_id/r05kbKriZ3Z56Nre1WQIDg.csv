Second and third time was disappointing. Waiters were still nice, but the broth of the pho had way too much salt and MSG, not to mention they put even more salt on top of the beef. 

Apparently the broth is pre-seasoned, and you can't order it with less salt. I'd suggest to go to Chinatown area to get some nicer and cheaper pho there.

It's not too loud and there is soft music playing overhead. The music is not intrusive (which means you can hold a conversation comfortably) so bring a date or enjoy your lunch break here in peace. 

We've been hit with this cold front that just won't quit and I can't think of a better way to warm up than with a big steaming bowl of pho. 

My coworker recommended this restaurant to me and it was a hit. We ordered the ribeye pho for $10.00 each. Once the broth hit the table, I added jalapeños, lime, sprigs of fresh basil,  and chili sauce to let them infuse flavors right away. 

The noodles are tender yet springy enough to grip with chopsticks. The flavor from the fresh meat and crisp veggies meld into the broth so much so that you can sip the remaining liquid and still taste the complex combination of savory, citrusy, goodness. 

I opted to drink their hot green tea, which is served in a petite, yet heavy, cast iron kettle. Careful, the whole pot is hot to the touch. The handle is narrow and it's a little awkward trying to pour the tea into little ceramic cups. 

The service was prompt. We were acknowledged right at the door, asked where we preferred to be seated, and taken care of quickly. The wait staff is friendly and helpful.

But Le Pho is a truly a memorable place in my mind for a number of reasons. First of all, the decor is gorgeous! The deep green wallpaper and wooden tables are so romantic. Also, the big windows give guests a beautiful view of the City Hall's light show at night and plenty of people watching in the afternoon. 

Now when it comes to food, the flavors of Le Pho are unmatched. One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is vermicelli with pork and egg rolls. This is by far one of the best egg rolls I have ever tasted. It doesn't taste homemade, but the flavors are so rich - there is no need to dunk it in sauce. 

My only gripe is that it's a little pricey for what I'd typically be willing to pay for Vietnamese food, but the portion sizes are generous so I'll let it slide. Overall, I am a fan!",8cuaubMlBl-_5daO2rlDKQ,0,0,4,juP4LfJ5IyVXKKf7ONlacg

The reality, however, resulted in much ""meh.""

I ordered the house Banh Mi that included taro chips. The portion was fine, not big. However, the big downer was the visibly burned baguette. Whatever great flavors lurking in the sandwich were destroyed by the overcooked bread. It could be flavor city in there but I'll never know. The taro chips also seemed overcooked -- but that could have been the residual burned bread taste overpowering everything.

Obviously, not every baguette is burned (I hope). But, quality control should be better for a $9.73 sandwich (includes tax).  I'll give it another shot.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,3,3,2,Nu5jPo3R24CWmVe5ojP5DA

I had a brand new debit card. NEVER used before or after eating lunch here, yesterday. However, I awoke this morning to find that $400 had been stolen from my account through a keyed-in card entry through a Square merchant account to a company named Fast Go, out of Brooklyn, NY. The first for $370, the second $30, and an additional failed attempt for $100. 

Now, to Le Pho's defense their card processing machine is out front where the customers can see it. However, the thick asian waitress (three waitresses walking around at the time, can't recall her name) that served us, swiped the card to process the payment, then looked up at me (as if to see if I was watching) and smiled, then disappeared around the corner for a couple minutes before coming back with my card to have me sign. Coincidence? Maybe. But I can guarantee if I ever go back, I'll pay with cash. Cancelled the card. Reversed the payments.

The food was okay, I've had way better. The pho broth is very sweet. The filet mignon was tender and cooked to perfection, but they skimped on the meat portion. The plate was more pine apple and bell-peppers than meat. And the bbq plate I ordered didn't even come with a side of fish sauce I had to request for it.

Once the food was finished the bill came out and our tab had an extra order of 3 bowls of pho which totaled out to $140? The waitress took her sweet time to come and correct our receipt.

But Le Pho has some of the best salads I have ever eaten. So even if I don't partake of their tasty-looking noodle dishes, this is one restaurant that I hope to put into heavy rotation.

I have been to Le Pho twice now, and both times service was quick and friendly. On my last visit, I had the poached chicken salad ($9), which I probably would have considered the best on the menu if I hadn't had the watercress beef salad ($12) the previous week. Both salads were perfectly dressed (nothing ruins a good salad more than a heavy hand on the dressing), with a nice balance of meat and vegetables. The chicken salad was tossed with a light, sweet fish sauce; and the beef salad had a heartier ginger-soy blend. Beautiful presentations both times, and the portion sizes were just right.

Another great thing about Le Pho is that they offer iced green tea. None of that nasty passion-fruit concoction here! I usually order a glass of wine with a salad, but the tea here is so good that it literally made me into a teetotaler--at least at Le Pho! ($3, but well worth it.)

I may be the only person who orders salads here, but as long as these two winners are on the menu, I'll keep on ordering them. Delish!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,5,C_mEwimMfyKcUVPDM-pGYg

Le Pho is a new Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, located inside the JUHL condominium complex. It was created by the same people that brought the popular Thai restaurant, Le Thai, the cool fusion like restaurant in Chinatown, District One, and his brother opened my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town, Viet Noodle Bar. So far, by the looks of it, it should be a success.

After walking in, I noticed the interior has a really cool vibe, with a full bar, and lots of rustic wooden tables laden throughout the restaurant. There is pop music playing in the background, and it just encourages fun times.

I sat down and ordered some dishes. The server was really nice and I waited. What is cool is that there is a Spring Roll bar where all the spring rolls are made. I noticed the Banh Mi on the menu are in the $9 range. Not too sure how I feel about that, but, it could be some super special one that I've never had before. I might check it out.

Knowing that my food would take a while since this was opening day, I won't  comment on how long it took for my appetizer to come out, it was a bit... But there are hiccups to every opening.

Nem Nuong spring roll - they either offer this as an appetizer in a bowl form, or as a spring roll form. I ordered the spring roll version. When it came out, I thought it was OK. The flavors were all there and I really liked the peanut dipping sauce, I thought that the pork could have been better, and the rice paper wrapping was a little tough. But I thought it tasted 'just OK'.

House Special Pho - it came with ribeye, meatballs, tendons and tripe. First, I thought the broth, the most important part of the Pho, was good. A little bit more cloudy than I would have liked, but I could taste the beef and spices. I did have some wilted bunch of basil, but I just put that to the side. The meats were good though.

I was going to give it 3 stars, but it is opening day, and there is always stuff that needs to be refined, even after a business opens. I think when it's up and running at the max, it can just be as successful as their sister restaurants.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,25,23,4,fbSBX57Cnto0RTglQQzppg

Our app is always the vegan roll a soft hand roll filled with shiitake, radish, asparagus and other yummy veggies, including Thai basil. They come with a large dish of hoisin/peanut sauce.

First of all, it is not where Yelp says it is on the map. It is actually on 3rd St. and Bonneville, right on the corner. It's one of the first floor businesses on the loft complex. Grab streetside parking for free on Saturdays and Sundays. Watch out for one way streets while navigating. It's best to approach away from Las Vegas Blvd. 

This feels like a chain as it is extremely polished from the styling of the decor and menu. The decor was more contemporary American than Vietnamese but the touch of a green color scheme and plants made it feel like Vietnam, otherwise it's a slightly industrial American look. 

The pho tasted exceptionally fresh and flavorful as it was served in a steel bowl. I had the special combination and all the proteins were delicious and satisfying. The meatballs were especially buttery. I felt as if the surroundings made the food taste better. The pho rolls with minced meat, grilled onions, and rice paper were unique and savory.

Our server overall was impersonal and disinterested. 

Pho was decent- broth was not quite as developed as I'd like, but portion was on par with average.  Namesake rolls were the favorite dish- popped with flavor, thanks to the garlic garnish, something I'd order again. Salad section seems to be on the menu to cater the healthy crowd but arrives looking like a plate of garnishes and no effort. Chicken was dry, portion was small, flavor lacking overall.

I had also read about their Phi Dipped, which is a Bahn Mi twist on a French Dip so it's made with Roast Beef but you dip it in Pho Broth. So I decided that I'd order both and just eat HALF the Pho. So much for that...

Pho Dipped - When I got the sandwich home I took a quick bite and was blown away instantly with how tasty it was. The bread was perfect and the flavors were great. I then dipped it into the Pho Broth. Words really don't give it justice! I have been also searching for a decent French Dip in this town and this may be my new go to sandwich. I can say that nothing I learned in etiquette classes was used eating that sandwich. I only regret not order two

I then finally got to my Pho. I got the special which has Ribeye, Tenderloin, Flank, Tripe, and Meatballs. Yum Yum Yum! The broth is so tasty that I barely added any spice or soy, which I almost always have to dump both into to add flavor. All the meat was super tasty and the noodles were perfect

They have a bar and the lighting here is soft and not too harsh.  The noise level is average - background conversations seem like blurs but you can still talk to your party and hear them well. The menus are on a cork board, adding to the quirkiness and uniqueness of the atmosphere. The walls had art of Vietnam, which I enjoyed seeing, and everything was very well organized, even the bathroom was clean and nice. 

Before we walked in, you could already smell the pho broth outside the restaurant. 

This place has prices that's a little more expensive than other pho places that I've been to but you can definitely taste quality in their dishes. Their iced coffee drips so you can see the mixture of the condensed milk and coffee. It tastes so amazing - reminds me of the streets of Vietnam! It's not overwhelmingly strong but still has a rich taste to it.

I ordered the chicken pho and the broth was flavorful and the chicken not too tough. Our server, Jasmine, was polite and attentive, I love her nose ring. Jasmine explained the menu to us with confidence! She always checked up on us and talked to us in a friendly manner. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area! It's closer to the Strip than Chinatown. 

The restaurant continued to be kind to us even after we paid for our meals. They were so sweet to us that they gave us two flan desserts, courtesy of the chefs.

The first time I came was during the first week or so of opening. The place was swamped as to  be expected. My friend and I sat at the bar. Our orders were messed up, and I ended up taking most of my order to go due to using most of my lunch time waiting to get the food fixed.

The second time, I was blown away with the service. I was with about five other people, and the service was amazing. Everything was correct- food came promptly. 

And, then I went this past Friday, and the service failed, again. It took forever to get my friend's and my food ordered. I never really saw our waitress despite ordering and paying the bill.

Husband wanted the same thing, but without tripe and tendon. When our food came out, everything looked amazing. As we started eating, we kept finding HUGE pieces of ribeye slices in our bowls and if you've eaten at any pho restaurant before, you know that the meat slices are thin and able to be eaten without having to cut it apart first. Bc we had to cut it up first, we didn't really care to even eat the meat. I also found a few pieces of ribeye bone fragments in mine which def wasn't a good thing. Afterwards when our bill came out, I was charged $12 for mine, however hubs was charged $16 for his which didn't make sense bc his bowl of pho was exactly similar to mine but without tripe and tendon.

Where to start?  The busser who took a our drink order was very friendly, and that's where it stops. 

Our server was rude and short with us. 

We ordered two Bahn Mi and the Chow Fun with chicken. Then, once our food arrived (but before tasting it) we ordered a third Bahn Mi.  

As soon as we got it my friend bit into the Bahn Mi and was literally unable to bite through the meat.  I thought she was being a drama queen (she's weird about meat) but she wasn't.  I, also, couldn't bite through the meat.

At this point we tell the server that the meat is REALLY tough / pure grizzle and we can't bite through it.  Not only did she seem uninterested, she didn't offer any solution.

My coworker literally took all of the meat off the sandwich and ate it like that.  I got through less than half of my sandwich before giving up... and I can eat.  

We asked if it was too late to cancel the third Bahn Mi because we didn't want to torture our coworker, and again she was quite rude, she even said ""probably"" when we asked if it was too late to cancel as we didn't eat any of our own. 

We tried the Chow Fun.  My coworker spit hers into her napkin which wasn't a good sign. 

I tried a bite and it tasted like soy sauce and boiled chicken water.

Again we ask our server ""is there perhaps a new cook or something because this doesn't taste right"", but she just said ""no, it should be correct"".  


We've eaten here before and we've had BOTH of these dishes before and they were good in the past.  But this terrible service combined with terrible food and no offer of a solution has me questioning whether I will ever go back again.",FzSZzB520NWAdSOwwpgz3w,0,0,1,YxMYIhuGCxiuLwAGWWnshQ

Bartender attended me, got me a glass of water and gave me menu to look at. 
He came back in about 10 min, took my order.

 I asked him for wi-fi password. Because,,,lunch by myself? What else is there to do?
He told me it'll be on the bill and he'll bring it to me (didn't say when).

So I'm thinking to myself,,,I kind of want it now,,,when am I going to get it? how hard is it to verbally tell me the password? Or post it somewhere for everyone?

Sure enough, he forgot about my bill, and I didn't get it until I finish my food. He apologized, for your note.
I wouldn't say I'm mad, but it just doesn't make sense. If you are not about to let your guest enjoy free wi-fi, why would you even set up guest wifi???

We ordered the vegan spring rolls, vegan pho, and the BBQ plate (not vegan). The rolls were tasty! I am not a huge fan of tofu, so I might as for strictly veggies next time. The pho was something that made my heart happy. It was so flavorful, full of veggies... and portion was large enough for two.

I came for HH (5-7pm, everyday) and tried some marinated pork and then chose the vegan spring rolls off the main menu.  Couple that with 2 for 1 wine and I was set.  Though portion sizes of the 2 things I ordered could have been bigger, I wasn't complaining because I was genuinely full and content with my choices.  The thick pork was marinated in a very thick sauce and with the addition of some sriracha, the appetizer was great. The veggie spring rolls were authentic and came with a delicious peanut dipping sauce that could be bottled it was so good.  Then the drinks during HH, 2 for 1 for a few beers and a house red and white, were good and well poured.  With many options on the menu to try, HH everyday (even weekends), and TVs and a good bar menu to choose from to watch a game after work, I will surely be back.  The only complaint would be the small HH food menu.  All they had was chicken wings, pork, and $1 oysters.

Food.  I ordered a Ribeye Pho and the Nem Nuong Roll, all to go.  The egg rolls at Vietnamese restaurants are one of my favorites.  Although the size of them where a tad bit on the smaller side from what I am use to at other Vietnamese restaurants.  These were way smaller.  I enjoyed the flavor, just not the size, especially for the price.  I guess that is what is expected coming from a downtown joint.  The Ribeye Pho was good too.  The flavor of the broth was good, but the ribeye itself, there was something off about it.  I don't know if it was just me, but the meat to me was chewy.  But it all tasted good.

I could enjoy any one of their appetizers or just order several and call it a meal but I stick to one appetizer and either get the Pho or the vermicelli bowl.

My mother and I are Celiac and had been assured by our friends at Le Thai and Bocho that Le Ph? would have something for us. They were not wrong, although the staff had next to no clue what we were talking about when we said gluten free (we were offered vegan and peanut free things, neither of which were gf). 

The decor is beautiful and the restaurant was clean and open. Not too busy. 

We ordered the beef ph? which we split. It was quite delicious. The broth was nicely seasoned, and the noodles and meat were very well cooked. Nice ceramic bowl, and stayed warm throughout the meal. 

We also ordered the traditional Spring Roll after being assured it was normally gluten free (it is not). We were served the roll and my mom took a bit of a huge piece of wonton in the middle. Wonton is usually made from wheat flour, but after we asked the waiter (who was friendly and patient) she told us the chef said it was rice flour.
Ok fine. 
Except literally 30 seconds later another waiter came running out to tell us it was not gluten free, and my mom already ate some. So she is going to be sick later. The chef remade them without the wonton, and they tasted quite good (although personally I am not fond of raw mint). The peanut sauce was great. 

Also had the Hennessy cocktail on their menu (the name escapes me). For the amount of drink vs ice (it's mostly ice) I would say it's a bit overpriced, but quite delicious, and beautifully presented. Beware of the stir stick with the cherry. I got a splinter in my lip trying to get it off of there (I blame my dumb luck). 

So essentially I wouldn't go back unless the staff gets some allergy training. Gluten intolerance/allergies are fairly common knowledge now, and I think they should know what gluten free means. 

It's too bad because the pho was really, really good...

I had really wanted to like Le Pho more, having been to both Le Thai and District One, but left severely wanting. My friend and I showed up on Wednesday night at 8pm, was greeted and sat very quickly. Our server comes by and takes our drink order, returns with drinksand takes our good order as well. We both order the house special Pho (he got the bone marrow scallion oil on the side) and I ordered the house special Bahn Mi as well.

After not too long of a wait our Pho comes out. The meat that is on top is close to the rare/raw side which I'd not s problem as it should cook in the broth, however the broth was more on the high warm side than steaming hot. The broth was okay to good, but nothing to write home about.

The bowl was nicely filled out with noodles and meats, but we both thought the ribeye cuts of meat was a little too chewy, but otherwise nice. After discussing or thoughts on the Pho (about quarter of the way in) the Bahn Mi I had ordered had not come out, nor had our server come to check on us. After asking to see our server and inquiring about the Bahn Mi, I was told that the kitchen forgot to fire it and they would be working on it. By the time my friend and I had finished our Pho the sandwich still hadn't come out. Was told that they were working on it, and because it was taking so long they would comp the sandwich. 

It finally comes out, and we try it and I like it a lot. I assume most of the ingredients (bread, pickled veg, pate, maybe the cold cuts) used in it were made in house. I think the Bahn Mi tasted better than the Pho, my friend thinks the Pho is a better value than t
he Bahn Mi. Bahn Mi is $9 and the Pho is $12. The Bahn Mi is severed with a side of taro chips, which I am usually a huge fan of, however the order of chips I received was a dark brown mess. It tasted burnt and of oil, and there was no crisp. That covers most of the food side of things. My friend really liked the bone marrow scallion oil, but he did note that it make the Pho very heavy (I had warned him too).

On the service side, I think I saw food runners and bussers more than our server. The guy was nice, maybe he was in the weeds, although it didn't seem that busy. Overall, I think Le Pho is okay, the food is solid, the service could be tightened up (or maybe it was a bad day). The price though I've had similar quality of pho and Bahn Mi in Chinatown for less, but as it is downtown, I understand that the price will be inflated to adjust.",vrfu5g0dEJA1ogMP9wicyQ,2,1,3,pSgbgpauytLrWcRPmLy_lg

On a nondescript corner somewhere between the strip and downtown, in a place without the casino foot-traffic of flip-floppy marble-walkers or downtown project coolsters, and in the midst of Bail Bonders, court-goers and Juhlers, you'll find this very rough diamond of a restaurant.

With its pedigree and good chef, one would expect it to be more memorable than it is. 
After all, following the Subway-ization strategy that has infected pizza places and burrito joints of late, it has a spring roll bar (sounds like something you'd put on race car in April, doesn't it?). 
I mean come on; a bar where they make spring rolls is cool, right? 
But even that doesn't quite work because it's in the back, out of sight, not in the front, so you lose the pleasure of marveling over the careful construction of the food you're about to consume. 

And the treble-in-paradise acoustics of the room can only be described as Keith Moon doing an extended solo on your eardrums! 
(For anyone under the age of 50, google ""Keith Moon"", dammit!)

The core problem is that the menu is as slim as a runway model and almost as simple-minded. I can barely remember what I ate! I think there was soup involved.

4026825,2016-11-17,2,r05kbKriZ3Z56Nre1WQIDg,"This place is PHOnomenal! Le Pho is my favorite place to eat in DTLV; I'd even venture to say it's one of my favorite places to eat in the whole city. In fact, when it came to soup, I was an I-prefer-ramen-over-pho type of person until visiting Le Pho. Now I'm obsessed with pho, though I'm finding other establishments don't really compare to Le Pho. Of course, with any restaurant, much of this can be attributed to personal preference but let me break it down for you:

Ribeye Pho ($10): The broth is perfect- it's so flavorful. This is a favorite of mine and I've had it many times. There's plenty of nice pieces of meat- meaning, you don't get just the fatty pieces. Personally, I enjoy clean pieces of meat so this is a winner for me. You can split this dish, and all pho dishes, into two bowls for an additional $3. They charge you extra because you get a little more pho than when it's just in one big bowl.

Chicken Pho ($9): Before trying the Chicken Pho, the Ribeye Pho was the apple, er.. pho, of my eye. Now, I constantly crave the Chicken Pho. The broth is also incredibly flavorful and delicious. Plenty of meat-- a lot of white meat, which I enjoy. The noodles are perfect as well.

Oxtail Fried Rice ($14): Amazing flavor. This has become a regular order for me and my boyfriend. Pro tip: get it with a fried egg on top for $1.50 more.

Traditional Spring Rolls ($7): Had these once with the gluten free option. The wontons were removed and I was offered fish sauce on the side instead of peanut sauce. Nice, fresh flavor. Great beginning to your meal.

Chicken Wings ($8): The tamarind sauce is very tasty. I love the flavor combo going on here. You get six wings per order and my only complaint is that they are on the small side.

Taro Ice Cream ($5): This was a dessert option the last time we dined. We thoroughly enjoyed the combination of taro, shredded coconut, and crushed peanuts. It's perfect for when your belly is full of pho but you still want something sweet to top off your meal.

I've enjoyed everything I've tried with the exception of the Bone Marrow Fried Rice. To me, it tasted heavily of fish sauce, but I don't even know if that is a key ingredient. I'm not a big fan of bone marrow in the first place so don't let my opinion on this dish sway you away from trying it. I'd like to sample more of the menu but I come here for the pho!

My only gripe is they can be inconsistent. One time I ordered Chicken Pho and it tasted like a different broth than usual. We also brought some friends here and the Ribeye Pho was so incredibly salty. We were slightly embarrassed after raving on and on about the broth; we insisted to our friends that it's not usually that salty. One thing that is consistent though is the service. The waitstaff and bartender are always fast and friendly. Veronica is our favorite!

Oh, and if you have allergies then you'll be in heaven here. They are allergy friendly and many things on the menu are gluten free or optional, including all the pho. Just talk to your waiter about your restriction(s) and he or she will check with the kitchen for you.

Give this place a try! I'm so addicted that I make the drive from Summerlin to DTLV once a week just to eat here. I recommend Le Pho to all my friends and family!

The food tastes good, and it's a cute little spot.

But the service was horrible. I had to ask for my server after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted. Food took awhile to be served; and when it was, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else. I had to call another server over for bean sprouts and jalapeños...and had to ask 3 times for siracha sauce. I've never been served pho without basic bean sprouts and jalapeños. 

Has great potential. But they really REALLY have to step their service game up. One last note, they were skimpy on the noodles. I'm used to tons and tons of noodles in my pho. I ran out of noodles before I finished the meat.",GmzwysGSE-gh0-RgG1_QNA,2,1,2,3ulSwmyH_IOwpOt6PNytFA

Le Pho is a cute spot in the Juhl with interesting decor. If you look closely though, certain individual elements clash with each other but as a whole it seems to work.

The menu seems pretty standard for a modern Vietnamese place. We usually just get the special pho. I like that you can have additional toppings like herby oils and whatnot.

My indicator of good pho is this: after the meal, do you and your clothes smell like pho? In this case no. There pho here is a little more nuanced, a little more refined. Not saying it's good, not saying it's bad. Just ok.

Service is good during lunchtime. We usually get this one kid who always checks with the kitchen if this or that contains wheat flour, soy sauce or hoisin (gluten allergy).",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,2,1,3,mLm9wpurw2oOZwhEbpvsSg

I was shopping around the North Premium Outlets and had an intense craving for pho. Instead of traveling to Chinatown, my handy dandy yelp app lead me here  (and less than 10 minutes away from the outlets - wooo!)

I ordered their house special pho, nem nuong, egg rolls, grandma's grilled pork, and the bbq plate. 

Combination pho definitely satisfied my craving!  A little on the expensive side when you're paying $12 for pho though. 

Nem nuong was not worth it, at all. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of Brodards style and I did not get anything like it. I felt like I was eating a spring roll full of lettuce and mint. The pork patty was non-existent and there was no crunchy wonton inside! I was so disappointed. 

Egg roll was decent. A little on the small side and I feel the fish sauce was much needed to pump up the flavor. 

Grandma grilled pork was recommended by the hostess and she said it was different than the pork found in their BBQ plate. Though their flavors are different, I enjoyed the BBQ plate pork more. Grandma's grilled pork was too salty for my family. And even though I know it's an appetizer, it was tiny. I think there was about 6 pieces of pork in the appetizer. 

The BBQ plate was delicious and filling. Comes with pork and short ribs, rice, and topped with an egg. I think this meal has the most bang for your buck. The only thing that was missing was the fish sauce you pour all over the meal. I'm used to doing that at other Vietnamese restaurants, but maybe they don't do it here. 

I also think it's crazy that they make you pay extra for the scallion oil and other add ons that are included for free at other establishments.

As I tend to do, the first thing I do when I get back to civilization is get some pho. Being that Portland considers itself the pho capitol of everything, I was a little cautious at best, bring my first time in Vegas. I was pleasantly proven wrong!
The drinks are top notch and the pho is fresh, delicious, and very quick. I am impressed. Will, my bartender/server guy, was friendly fast and efficient. And it was only after I ate that I found out tonight was their soft opening. I'm doubly impressed. You'd have thought they'd have had years of practice.
So if you like pho and stiff drinks to go with it, this is your jam.

You can find many restaurants serving pho in Las Vegas, but Le Pho has raised the bar based on our experience, though visitors without vehicles may find its downtown location a bit of a deterrent.     

We started off with egg rolls (northern style with pork, crab meat, wood ear mushroom, carrot & cellophane noodles) that were accompanied by a small bowl of dipping sauce, lettuce, carrots and basil.  The rolls were oil free and the best we have ever eaten.  My wife ordered pho gia (chicken soup) while I settled on the pho ribeye.  These were accompanied by fresh basil, lime, slices of jalapeno and bean sprouts.  The base of each soup was delicious, both proteins were succulent tender, and the noodles bountiful.

4702213,2016-07-26,6,r05kbKriZ3Z56Nre1WQIDg,"Located on the ground floor of The Juhl directly on the corner of Bonneville Avenue and 3rd Street. Ample street parking surrounding the building and beyond. Very easy to access and away from the the usual tourist traffic of DTLV.

After three visits, I've had a really good sampling of the menu. There are still a couple dishes I want to try, so I would definitely try those on my next visit. Bottom line: great food and great service. Although the location is very far from me, I'm happy to make the drive!

Chicken Wings ($7): Crispy Wings quick-tossed with housemade tamarind sauce; topped with garlic chips. The chicken is cooked well and the sauce is delicious. There is a Five-Spice Salt and Pepper version ($5) offered during Social Hour (4-7PM daily) that is also really good.

Egg Rolls ($8): Fried Northern-style with pork, crab meat, Wood Ear mushrooms, carrot, and cellophane noodles. Crunchy and tasty; a solid egg roll.

Traditional Spring Roll ($7): Shrimp, pork, vermicelli noodles, fried wonton, bean sprouts, mint, and lettuce. Decent, but nothing exciting.

Vegan Spring Roll ($7): Fried tofu, shiitake mushroom, bell pepper, grilled onion, lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts. I love this option for my non-meat eating friends, but there wasn't a lot of flavor going on.

Le Pho Roll ($7): Grilled five spice pork, basil, lettuce, and scallion oil. So, so much flavor in the pork and accompanying ingredients. The rice noodle is perfect, too. This is my favorite roll!

Nem Nuong Roll ($7): Vietnamese pork roll, fried wonton, lettuce, bean sprout, and mint. Just like the Traditional Spring Roll, this is just okay and not very exciting.

Bo Bia Roll ($8): Lap Cheong, dried shrimp, shredded omelet, and jicama. This is a fun ""breakfast"" roll that is also very tasty.

Lotus Root Salad ($10): Lotus root, pork, shrimp, roasted peanuts, cilantro, and fish sauce vinaigrette. Served with sesame rice crackers. I love the crunch from the lotus root and everything tastes so great together. Great low-carb option without sacrificing taste.

Vietnamese Poached Chicken Salad ($9): Poached chicken, cabbage, red onion, rau ram (Vietnamese coriander), crushed roasted peanuts, fried shallots, crushed shrimp rice crackers, and fish sauce vinaigrette. This was good, but no exciting flavors either.

House Special Banh Mi ($9): Toasted French baguette with pork cold cuts, pork pâté, mayonnaise, pickled daikon and carrots, jalapeño, scallion, and cilantro. The bread was crusty, but soft, so it was the perfect vehicle for this popular sandwich. Tasty, though it could use more meat!

Pho Dipped Banh Mi ($11): Toasted French baguette with slow-cooked beef brisket, bean sprout, basil, pickled daikon and carrots, jalapeño, hoisin, and sriracha sauce. Served with a bowl of pho broth. Even though I'm usually drawn to a traditional Ban Mi (I loove the meats), this is a really great sandwich and their pho broth is seriously amazing.

Ribeye Pho ($10): I had this on my first visit and it revived my faith in Pho. Again, the broth is phenomenal and the vermicelli noodles are just amazing. I've had the House Special Pho ($12) as well with Ribeye, flank, tendon, tripe and meatball. Also wonderful.

Vermicelli Bowl ($17): Grilled pork, lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, crushed roasted peanuts, scallion oil, fish sauce, and vermicelli noodles. *Add Shrimp and Egg Rolls. They have the best vermicelli noodles in town; it's slightly thicker and have a great texture. The dish itself is fantastic. The charbroiled pork and shrimp are really delicious.

Ben Thanh Market Fried Rice ($12): Dried shrimp, Lap Cheong, eggs, and diced asparagus. Topped with salted egg yolk. Everything about this dish would make me think I'd like it, but it was rather bland compared to a lot of the other flavors going on in this place.

Hoi An Chicken Rice ($10): Poached chicken, pickled daikon and carrot, and turmeric rice. This is very similar to Hainan poached chicken. The chicken is flavorful and prepared nicely. The rice is also tasty and everything is great together. Add Nuoc Cham for added deliciousness.

Duck Noodle Bowl ($15): Five-spiced braised duck, thin egg noodles, bok choy, shiitake mushroom, organic Onsen egg, scallion, and garlic chips. The dish was a little salty, so that made it hard to fully enjoy, but the noodles and ingredients were great.

Wok-Tossed Filet Mignon ($18): Wok-tossed filet mignon and seasonal vegetables with black pepper sauce, watercress, red torpedo, and spring onion mix. Served with white rice. A good version of ""Shaking Beef;"" flavorful and tender steak.

Banh Beo ($9): Steamed rice cakes with ground mung bean, dried shrimp, scallion, and crispy pork rinds. Not bad, but it was missing crispy shallot and lacking slightly in flavor.

Favorites: Le Pho Roll, Bo Bia Roll, Pho Dipped Banh Mi, Ribeye Pho, House Special Pho, Vermicelli Bowl, and Hoi An Chicken Rice.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,10,9,4,p6RzjySNnp0JmTg3zMVasg

My wife and I stopped in las night and were completely happy with the food and service.  We were immediately pleasantly greeted and seated by the host who upon hearing it was our first time, gave us her suggestions of what to look for on their menu.

We took her advice on the appetizer and ordered what are eyes landed on for pho, the ox tail and ribeye.  Starting with the Le Roll, it was a great take on the traditional Vietnamese spring roll.  We loved the new approach and of great flavors and presentation while still keeping the essence of the dish.  As we were very hungry walking in, and because it was so good, the appetizer did more than its job by raising our anticipation for our main course.

I had ox tail and my wife the ribeye pho.  Admittedly having a little less finesse with chop sticks as I would like, my clumsy self was able to separate the succulent meat from the submersed bone with ease.  The small effort was completely worth the energy spent the instant I had that first taste of ox tail, pho noodle and broth.  I devoured my entire bowl with each mouthful producing my audible satisfaction.

My wife's response was equally as satiating.  With each initial morsel enjoyed, we'd have those exchange of glances as to wordlessly express ""I know right?!?"".  Being that she has a smaller stomach than me, she was not able to finish her portion, which I had no problem with... More food for me!!!  Having quickly finished my bowl, I was only happy to make sure we got our money's worth and made her dinner disappear.  Though more traditional of a pho than the ox tail, it was still a super tasty execution that shouldn't disappoint any pho enthusiast.

Ultimately we ordered a flan for dessert to end everything on a sweet note.  Which ended up being the perfect end to the meal.  The flan was light and custardy as opposed to dense or over drenched in syrup.  It was bouncy on our spoons and everything a flan should be.  And ultimately, it just the right sweetness to be the last flavors we took away from our visit.

We were very happy with our visit to Le Pho and will absolutely be back again! The food and service was awesome and when downtown craving a newer expressive take on Vietnamese food, we know where we will be going!",qQC7w7AEGJAsYAfzDip24w,2,0,5,xQK2ThFBdag07aqEPcGECA

""Haha, no weird Asian stuff!"" joyfully proclaims farm boy America.

The brainchild of  Chef Khai Vu of District One, Le Pho serves Americanized Vietnamese that happen to work well while grabbing a drink on a DTLV pub crawl.  

Americanized equals familiar flavors and ingredients.  No culantro, lighter extraction in the pho broth, unusually light hand in use of fermented fish sauces, sour flavors missing.  Bottom line, traditionalist, don't ditch your favorite Chinatown Vietnamese eatery just yet.

First and foremost, this is a bar that serves Vietnamese food not the other way around.  Food pairs with drinks.

For shareable dishes, ""Grandma's Grilled Pork"", soy marinated pork cheeks; juicy,  somewhat chewy.  A tasty bar bite.  Good assortment of rolls, the egg roll, crispy and stuffed full with pork, crab, shrimp, rice noodles, and toothsome wood ear mushrooms.  Rolled in lettuce, dip in the sauce.  Good as any.  Interesting ""Le Pho Roll, unmistakable flavor of five spice pork and lettuce rolled in a wide sheet of uncut pho noodle and dressed with a scallion oil.  Interesting but one dimensional.   A lotus root salad with pork, shrimp, cilantro, peanuts dressed in a fish sauce vinaigrette and served in crispy, airy rice cracker has an unexpectedly mild flavor.  Eat it fast or the cracker gets soggy and sticks to your teeth.

The pho doesn't measure up to that of its sister restaurant.  Perhaps an off day.  Light and almost watery.  The house special contains a good portion of raw ribeye, flank, clean and tender tendon, soft tripe and meatballs.  Opt to add some bone marrow for added richness for $1 more.  Begs for hoisin and chili oil to be dumped directly in the bowl but satisfying none the less.

Note:  Typical Southeast Asian service.  Dishes are brought out whenever they are ready.  This is customary.  If you don't like it, order in waves but be prepared for some annoyance on the part of the servers.

Decent selection of beer.  Reasonably priced.

After dropping off donations at Las Vegas Rescue Mission we were hungry so we decided to check this place out. It's located at the bottom floor of The Juhl condominiums. If you don't know the area you'll probably miss it and have to circle back around, like we did. 

Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley, this one is modern and pricier. The only one in downtown, the vibe and pricing caters to the downtown area. 

I loved the interior design and spacious feel. There's a full bar and happy hour options as well, which other Viet spots don't have. I looked them up on instagram and they host private events and events for local charities which is awesome. 

Looking at the menu, I had no idea what to order. I didn't want Pho, and I wanted to try something new, I asked the waitress and one of her suggestions was the Pho Dipped. I decided to try that. My friend got that as well. 

Pho Dipped $12 - Bahn Mi with a side of pho broth. 

For the taste, size and price it was just OK. It wasn't salty, which I liked.The flavors were mediocre, nothing bad, but nothing great to make up for pricing. This was not worth the price.

I had never seen a Green Thai Tea before, so I really wanted to try it. It was buy one get one free with yelp check in offer. Offer shows ""1 Free Green Thai Iced Tea"", we didn't see the fine print. Price is $5 each. Small size. Thought that was pricey as well. 

I guess you pay for the ambiance here. 

Our first waitress was okay, felt a little rushed. While we were eating, her shift was ending so another waitress took over. The second waitress was friendlier, more helpful and knew what she was doing, like she's been doing this for years or owned the place. I only ate a half of the bahn mi. She offered durable takeout containers. Didn't expect a container for the broth, which was nice. She also offered to split the bill for us without us asking. With tax and tip we each paid about $17. That is pricey for what we got. 

I would come here again to try the happy hour and if I'm in the area, but won't order the Pho Dipped. Other than that I'd rather go some where else.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,8,6,3,w3xPiLTTD4-37-elYJnF1A

I wanted to try something different so I tried the WATERCRESS BEEF SALAD which comes with beef, watercress, radishes on a bed of cilantro. I pick up, come back to find no watercress or even the radishes. So it was beef and cilantro. Very disappointing for whoever prepared this meal.

But I'll tell you that this place is awesome!

I'm a fan of le Thai and district one 
So of course I had to check it out.

I've come many times already in different days and different times of the day. For the most part I have come when it's pretty quiet. Which I prefer. The staff are always friendly and attentive.

I have even ordered take out and it was promptly made as communicated. 

My favorite is their French dip banh mi sandwiches. It's the best of both worlds when I can never decide what I want. I'm still not sure how I feel about their taro chips that come with it as I have never tried them other than here. 

Are they suppose to Taste burnt ? Not sure. Either way it's great to have something different in downtown. Recommend this place highly wish they had those yummy buns from district one.",n6GyJB0d3H9--yLNKtecFg,0,0,5,fFr43kyY0OsCL1LcjyT4cg

5227963,2018-06-11,2,r05kbKriZ3Z56Nre1WQIDg,"Friday afternoon, I came home feeling lousy.  I've been fighting with allergies/a summer cold for a while now, and I was craving pho. 

My incredible husband said that he wanted to take me to dinner and a movie, so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and looked for Pho spots near us.  

Le Pho was the closest with more than a 3 star rating, so we hopped in the car and drove down.

We're not really frequent visitors to the downtown area, but Le Pho was easy to find, and parking was also easy to find.  Not a huge fan of the ""pay to park"" meters, but at least we were able to park close by!

The spot is clean and open, and we were invited to sit anywhere we wanted.  Our server stopped over and gave us menus, and brought over water. She was super polite for the entire visit.  I wish I got her name.  

When you check in on the Yelp app, there is a check in offer for a buy one get one free Iced green Thai tea.  I'd never had green Thai tea before, but this was delicious.  It had a very subtle sweet taste.  I'll definitely be having another one next time!

Happy hour is from 3-6, and we arrived at 4, so we were able to take advantage of one of the happy hour specials:  the Le Pho Roll for $4.  

This is absolutely delicious.  grilled 5 spice pork, basil, and other amazingness wrapped up in a rice noodle textured wrapper...we had to let it sit and cool for a moment, but oh man was this delicious!!!

We also ordered the traditional spring roll, which had shrimp, pork, veggies, and noodles.  Perfection.  The peanut sauce was on point as well.

As for the entrees:
Morgan had the oxtail pho.  The broth was a little salty due to the meat, but some herbs and sriracha fixed that right up. The oxtail was tender, and practically falling off the bone.  It was really good.

I had opted for the rib-eye pho, as it was the closes to the Pho Tai that i normally get.  This was exactly what I'd been craving.  The broth was so delicious, there was a TON of rib-eye meat in it, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the addition of herbs and sriracha helped me to spice some of the sickness out. I actually have left overs for lunch today.

All in all, I was very pleased with our visit.   Service was great, and the food was phenomenal.  We both had 2 huge bowls of pho, 2 drinks, and 2 appetizers for under $50.  Not too shabby!!!

We will definitely be coming back!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,2,5,KcddL-4QJ9DOGZKUN1XBhA

No parking problem here and not in Spring Mtn Rd but hey, It's Asian Fusion Pho so we go with the flow.
I had the Rib Eye Pho yes, I'm a Rib-Eye Steak person and never saw this ever.  It was the bomb!!!! The soup itself is fusion for sure but it was hella excellent.  The Rib eye cut I would believe in was prime and not choice cut.  Don't know if I'll ever have beef pho again unless it was rib-eye steak.
Also it was served on metal soup bowls and that's an excellent concept as pho needs to stay on the warm to hot side to really enjoy the meal.  The metal soup bowl is one way.  This tells me they understand the whole pho experience.  Many pho places just slammed it in and whatever.  
Yes, there's a whole technical approach to preparing, cooking and eating pho.  Le Pho has the formula for sure.

on both visits my friend got the vegan pho which is not listed on the menu and neither is the vegetarian option. 
I can easily say that this is the best pho for spa I've ever had in my life and this is definitely the best pho in Vegas.

I love how open the place looked it was a total surprise because I didn't expect it took look like that. We were initially sit at the bar but it seemed a bit crowded to us. But I was looking at their bar and they have a very nice selection of liquor.

When we got sat at our table I was a little disappointed the the tables were wobbly... That is one of my pet peeves when I go out to eat. Nothing is more annoying than trying to eat your meal on a wobbly table. (But I guess its just me being in the industry as well... )

Kelvin was our server and he was so sweet. We started of with the Nem Nuong Rolls which were DELICIOUS. I've had it at other places before but I liked the ones here A LOT. The Nem Noung meat was warm where most places don't really serve it that way. And the herbs and veggies that they put into the roll just complement everything so well. I love the red shiso leaf in there- it just adds a brightness to the roll. But make sure you order these, because the table behind us had ordered some and we ordered the last order... SOOOO they sell QUICK! I had also ordered the fish cake with were delicious as well.The texture was nice and the flavors weren't to over powering. And I also liked the fact that they served it with a side of lettuce and pickled veggies to eat it as a wrap.

The chef had also sent out some Eggrolls as well some specialty dish. I really wish I had asked what it was because they were both awesome. The specialty dish had some shrimp, pork and pickled veggies all served on a shrimp chip. Very nice and scrumptious. The eggrolls came out super hot, (Just like I like them) and they were served with a side of veggies as well. (I Love when they do that) And their dipping sauce was on point. Not too garlicky, not too salty, with right amount of sweetness as well. Yum!

We both Ordered the house special, and I had ordered mine with the Additional Bone Marrow and Scallion Oil because it intrigued me. When it came out, it was nice and hot. (You'll be surprised how many times we've had pho that just came out warm.) So that was super awesome. And they had put the Bone Marrow and Scallion Oil on the side. I like to taste my pho first before i add any additional seasoning and it was PERFECT. Nice balance of flavor, not too salty, not too sweet. The cuts of meat that they used in there were super delicious as well. And their CILANTRO... My husband thought I was a little crazy, But the Cilantro that they used was sooooooooooooooooooooooo good, I've never had cilantro that tasted like that before, it was so good. (I wonder where they get their cilantro from.)

All in all, I would most definitely be back, It may be a little bit pricier than your average bowl of Pho, BUT you can tell that they use the best quality ingredients and that there is love in the food Something a lot of places lack now a days.

The meat was very tender; it completely melts in your mouth! The broth is so flavorful and just delicious. Diamond our waitress was so sweet and very helpful.

I don't go to DTLV... but if you're in the area I highly recommend coming here.

Everything I had here was delicious and if you're looking for a drink... order the green thai ice tea! 

Tons of different seating options and great for groups. Love the ambiance and vibe that it brings to DTLV.

Street parking right outside.

Thanks Chef Khai!

I'm a fan.

The Banh Mi was very simply one of the best sandwiches in Vegas. Between eating here and the Goodwich  (via Postmates this week) DTLV has stepped up its food game again. Bravo!! And Veronica, our server, was terrific.",5fefSJ8gFQd_nANLezdfpw,2,1,5,yT0yfXiimlwmS4FDI_A8OQ

I have noticed a little inconsistency which is typical of chefs that run numerous restaurants, but when Le Pho nails it it's the best pho I've ever had in my life.  The grilled pork spring rolls and sandwiches are damn good as well.",BJt5rHl8ETUsWZmdwJnS1g,0,0,5,LDGcj5nmUg_idO0_rNiiVw

The actual springs rolls were good, unfortunately the peanut butter dip for the spring rolls was not the best it had a funny taste. We will not be going back.

The trendy atmosphere and downtown locale will make a great spot for a business lunch or dinner. It is relatively easy to find and get to, but you will likely pay for parking (think about $1 per hour). The tables were clean and tidy, along with the rest of the dining area. 

The prices are more than fair and you can see the effort in their presentation of the meals. We ordered the crispy wings, not necessarily traditional, but they were crispy, flavorful, and tender inside. The traditional spring rolls were fresh but bland. The peanut sauce served along side it was slightly too sweet, but others loved it.

Now... for the pho! The soup came in a clay pot with the usual fresh basil, mung beans, jalapeño, and limes. This plate was freshly cut and chilled for a zesty compliment to the broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was not overly salted. They only have siracha as a chili sauce - but order a side of it if you like your pho a little spicy - as theirs can seem pale compared to more traditional resturants. I'm sure pickier eaters will do well with this version of pho of they have not liked it in the past.

Service was great even with this being a 'soft' opening. Our server was accomodating, friendly, and let us be during most of our meal.",u78hzZ5zaaz0Afht2PdEOA,3,2,3,6SSFbExN5zrg9LBhK72CEA

I tried ginger chicken with rice and House Pho. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and were so unusual to my taste buds. A sort of combination of sweet and salty. The portions are huge too.
