  From the outside it looked like an abandoned building, and the inside...well, it kinda was!. When we pulled into the parking lot we weren't so sure anymore if we wanted to go inside. But I already drove here so we decided to take the chance. When we walked inside there was no one there besides the waitress (and hopefully a cook). she told us to sit anywhere we wanted so we sat in the middle so the room wouldn't look so empty. It was kind of  early we must have been the first customers of the day. I heard it gets real packed on weekends. The place is a little outdated many  layers of paint over the years and cottage cheese ceiling this place has seen its better days, someone from the rat pack must have eaten here at some point. But I'm not a building inspector I'm sure everything is up to code, I'm here for the food and rumor has it, it's Pretty good here!
  We started with a dozen of raw oysters which tasted pretty fresh! Then I ordered the campechana which is a cocktail of shrimp octopus and oysters on a tomato sauce with onions cilantro avocado and bunch of other stuff. All I can say is that it was delicious! My friend ordered the camarones rancheros which consists of shrimp sautéed in garlic butter with onions tomatoes and peppers topped with red sauce and served with beans and rice. It was also very good.  yes I tried it, I took a bite, I'm the yelper, Somehow it gives me clearance to try other peoples food!  : )
 Service was great! We had the waitress's unconditional attention. she told us that on weekends there's live music and dancing and that they're always busy and I can see why, it's all about the food and the fun. So next time you drive by this place, don't let the facade fool you, go in and enjoy the food. We sure did!...and I'm glad this story had a happy ending!

This place is located in a sunburnt strip mall with a cracked parking lot.  All the businesses there have Spanish signage.  The place is three retail spaces wide and fairly deep. Vinyl booths line the walls and Formica tables dominate the interior.  

We entered on a Sunday afternoon, to the whirr of a fan sitting on the floor near a marginally maintained aquarium. Umpah mariachi music blared from a juke box, as a few well-weathered Latino men in tight jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats studied the song list or meditated over their beer and chips.  Other than them and another couple, we were the only customers there.

After sitting and perusing the menu for at least five minutes, the waitress finally arrived to take our drink order.  I asked for iced tea.  Out of iced tea. Being parched from Vegas heat, I asked if the Orchata was refillable. No. Ok fine. I've had enough of restaurants with no decent, refillable beverage choices that aren't packed with sugar. I asked for water, dug into my purse and whipped out my Peach Tea Mio.  Five minutes later she arrived with my water and his Diet Coke.  Another five minutes later she brought us a small basket of chips, salsa, and a small plate of chips with bean dip and melted queso on top.  Then she took our order.

Gary ordered a beef burrito and I ordered chicken poblano.  While we waited we finished all of our chips and most of our beverages.  No refills were offered.  The food was in the window for a few minutes before the waitress decided to pick it up and bring it less than 10 feet to our table.  His burrito was tasty and huge. My chicken was OK but only OK. It was bone-in, which I wasn't expecting. The poblano molé had good chocolate flavor but not enough salt. The rice was very good, needed salt, but nicely flavored with little pieces of veggies in it. The beans were tasty too.  

Once we were done, we asked for a box as were brought the check.  We had already been sitting too long and were getting anxious to leave so Gary coughed up enough cash to cover the bill plus an all too generous tip.  Just as we were about to leave without taking leftovers, our box arrived.  God help us if we'd asked for a refill or anything out of the ordinary. 

We really were looking for a nice little place on the way from The Strip to North Las Vegas Airport, that would be outside of the whole Vegas scene.  We saw other alternatives on Yelp.  Next time we'll skip this dive and opt for something with a better Yelp reputation. 

PS: Attention waitress, this isn't service.  Your job should not be to take our order and then do the bare minimum. You should recognize that you work for tips, then earn them.  Gary was way too generous because you were lazy, slow, and didn't care.  You suck.",iNFdV_f9qqVHze1C5upiNQ,1,1,2,lGRQdxJZ_yqi_S6WQa2rGA
2494287,2017-06-07,0,inkeT1aob-iZWbj3o_UQCA,"If I could rate this place zero stars, I would. This is the first and last time we come to this place. The food was cold, tasteless, and simply awful. We only ate our food because we were seriously starving. $50 later I really wish I had listened to my husband and just gone to Mcd. This place has a very weird atmosphere. The service was terrible, non-attentive and slow. The restaurant was practically empty, yet it was extremely dirty (or maybe that's just the look?) The server asked us to sit somewhere else as a certain area was dirty yet she didn't bother cleaning. The restrooms were dirty but overall the place looks like a dump, just take a look at their fish tank located near the entrance, lol.

There are waaaaaay better restaurants out there. Avoid this place.",MM1rUsU8yk8OsfHT3j5EWg,0,0,1,HPvJ6JJ28XqCWgSPQRRkMg

There was nothing about the food to make me come back in the first place!!!!!! I even feel like because my boyfriend is a white boy we seem to get bad service sometimes on top of everything..............I would not go back to this Nightmare of a restaurant
