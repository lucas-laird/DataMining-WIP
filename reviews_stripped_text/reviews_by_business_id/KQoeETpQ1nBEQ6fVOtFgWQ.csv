29783,2017-10-07,0,KQoeETpQ1nBEQ6fVOtFgWQ,"Went to the Hamptons for a brunch date last weekend. We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess and had a waiter at our table for drinks within two minutes. The service was prompt and friendly throughout the meal, but we switched waiters before even ordering food. It was a little odd to have a new waiter come to our table and help us while our previous one stood around and waited on a single table, and it seemed like there might have been too much staff on shift. 

Their endless mimosas or bloody Mary's are a good deal at less than or right around $20. They're not super special or different than any other mimosa, but they did offer a flavor variant if you wanted. I've got to say, my waiter was QUICK on the refills... as in, he'd bring me one before I was done. Not a bad thing! 

For food, I got the chicken biscuit. It tasted good but I felt like I needed to scarf it down before the gravy soaked everything and made my meal mush. My date got the short rib sandwich, which was delicious but a bit messy. Portions were great and it didn't take long to arrive. 

I would definitely return for dinner or even another brunch. The venue is lovely and upscale but trendy and the staff was all friendly. I personally think they could be better organized, as the staff seemed continuously confused over who had what table, but overall I'd recommend trying it.",wkKnzTG93gutdDWJpjwDQQ,0,0,4,eKoMmrhbO3WEd5nKywSKxw

For our mains we got the Salmon and the Swordfish both I highly recommend. The salmon was sat atop an amazing sauce I couldn't get enough of. The sword wish comes out as  grilled steak with street taco sized tortillas and I really well spiced guacamole and a slaw to build your own tacos.

The onion soup had no cheese and was so sour like drinking straight vinegar. I really enjoyed it dining in but it's like they didn't care for the to go order. The salmon was just ok. It wasn't a filet but like a circular patty. Probably won't go back even though I have quite a few friends that like it.

The food was decent. Our server was super sweet and made plenty of suggestions and pointed out dishes that were specific to the brunch menu, which was helpful. The bruschettas in particular are a great shareable app- we got to try both  when they accidentally brought the wrong order to the table.

Their lemon-ricotta pancakes with blueberries went over well with my friend Loren, but the apps I ordered were just okay. The deviled eggs were nicely creamy, but the Buffalo Rings had minimal buffalo and were on the plain side.

Service was very friendly, but food was slow to come out, there were errors with our order, and the check took a solid half hour to sort out. I might try a few more dishes during HH, since they're so close to work.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,27,15,3,P22mo4yx7gDKcBV8vJN9vg

Our server was blonde about 5'6 (I think her name started with a ""C"") and she did not check on us other than to try and clear the appetizer plates (which still had food on them).

We, a family of 5, came here for Mother's day lunch - well after the rush had already left, and the tables had been cleaned. The server was sweet but gave us the impression she was busy elsewhere the whole time. Two of us ordered bottomless mimosas, which they came back to refill twice. Not a huge deal, but.. it's supposed to be bottomless. Just keep coming back, yeah? 

We ordered Beignets as we sat down. We then had to ask each and every time they came back to the table about the Beignets. Again, no big deal, but just bring the Beignets. 

One of us ordered the BLTE that never made its way to the table. We eventually had to cancel the order as everyone was already almost done with their meal. 

Now.. the food. The swordfish sandwich was inedible simply because of its size. The fish itself was very tasty make no mistake. The steak fries it came with were great, too. Just hard to eat the dish how it was served. 

The chicken sandwich was awesome. Opposite of the swordfish sandwich, the bite was perfect. Crispy chicken cutlet with a sweet slaw and pickles, with a side of buttery hot sauce.

The chicken sandwich was the saving grace here but the rest of the food and the service were not enjoyable. 3 stars for the waitress kindly waiving the mimosas from the tab. This proved it wasn't just us that felt this way about our experience here.

I'm looking forward to coming back and having a better time.",NZInok33qPu_6B5k2YHb7Q,0,0,3,NGeoVcqtsZ82NtdxZL5QKw

The inside of the restaurant was decorated nicely and it has a nice, open feel to it. Patio seating is available as well for those that are interested. 

I did make a reservation through OpenTable and the hostess found my name in their system with no problem. 

All of us got the bottomless mimosas. They have the choice of orange juice or cherry. I tried both because why not? I wanted to get my money's worth haha. Both were tasty so can't go wrong really. 

Complimentary beignets: great way to start a meal! I wasn't expecting this so it was a nice surprise. Each guest gets 1 beignet and it's topped off with powdered sugar. It was light and wasn't overly sweet. 

Mushroom brie bruschetta: I love brie and I love mushrooms so I decided to give this a try. It was just alright. The flavors went well together but I was expecting the bread to be a bit more toasted for that nice crunch. 

Egg white frittata: simple dish with veggies (asparagus, spinach, and cherry tomatoes) topped off with cheese. Comes with a side of potatoes. This is a great choice if you want something light and simple. I figured since I'm drinking my calories in mimosas, that I should stick with a light meal. 

Our server was great! Kinda bummed I can't remember her name. She was attentive and checked on us regularly without being too invasive. She always made sure our mimosas were full and that we had everything we needed.

2742606,2017-10-20,1,KQoeETpQ1nBEQ6fVOtFgWQ,"Five of us sat on the patio for dinner. I ordered the cuban sandwich with no ""5 spice pineapple"". I asked if I could have something else in place of the fries, perhaps a side salad or veggie. He said ""sorry, no substitutions"". I jokingly said ""I'll literally take anything else you want to put on the side, just not french fries."" Again, he said ""No substitutions"" and then pointed to the menu where it stated that. There were probably less tables in the restaurant than I can count on my one hand, this is not something that should've been refused in my opinion. My sandwich came out with the pineapple on it and no pickles, another fail. I asked for a side of pickles, no problem. The sandwich was probably a 5 out of 10.

Three of my friends said that their food was ""very average"", and my one friend who ordered the ahi tuna salad said it was one of the worst he'd ever had. We wanted to order dessert but figured that would be disappointing too, so we passed.

Cherry topper: the check comes out with auto-gratuity of 18% on there (that's supposed to be for 6 or more people). We tell our server and he says ""Oh sorry, it automatically put that on there by mistake. I'll get it taken care of"". BS!!! I've worked in the industry for many years, and with every POS system, the server had to manually add on the 18-20% gratuity for large parties.

Super disappointed with this place. Will not be returning and wouldn't recommend eating here if you haven't tried it yet.",3Kxmqx2tZIol0sB3W6cR7A,3,0,2,qL0XrrzQKA_VAdzmgav10A
2804843,2017-09-24,1,KQoeETpQ1nBEQ6fVOtFgWQ,"We came here for the first time Friday night and called ahead to ask how late they serve their full menu/seat for dinner as I was getting of work late. The website and yelp say 10pm, but the girl on the phone - after initially telling us 10pm - said they were open until 11pm. We asked how late they seat and she said 11pm. 

We arrived around 10:30pm and were immediately brought water and the waitress took our drink order - but she didn't seem to know the menu. 

My husband ordered a Sculpin - one of the most popular beers in the US right now - and she said 'a what?' so he pointed it out on the menu. He added an oder of whiskey and same thing 'what? What is that?' he pointed it out on the menu. The beer list is pretty blah so I opted for the Kombucha cocktails and when I asked how strong the bitters were as both the Guava and Strawberry version list bitters in the ingredients - same thing AGAIN! ""What?"" The bitters, do they use a lot of bitters. ""Bitters?"" yes... finally she told me that she had tried both and the bitters were not overwhelming... 

The Guava Kamubcha cocktail was interesting in a good way and I did enjoy it. The bitters were not overwhelming. 

But then things went very down hill. After bringing out drinks our waitress walked by our table no less than 6 times before taking our order - so it was closer to 11pm before we even put in our food order. It was ok as we were enjoying our drinks, but given what happened later, it seems pretty absurd. 

The table next to us had been seated after us and received their food ahead of us and the place was not busy at all, like 3 tables and maybe a few people in the bar. I would have guessed our waitress went on break, except that she walked by our table so often. 

The Hamptons burger w/ fries was very good - thick burger, cooked nicely and flavorful. Same for the fries. Wedge salad was well constructed and had the right amount of tomatoes & bacon to go with the lettuce. The side of ham mac and cheese was just ok, trying to be a better version of what your mother made growing up, but not quite there. Avocado fries were meh as well. If you're looking to replace the amazing avocado fries found at the no-longer Nine at the Palms, you'll be disappointed. The artisan ketchup was a nice twist. 

The reason we WILL NOT be returning though happened at the end - we finished our meal and the waitress brought the check, we paid and my husband was still finishing his whiskey when a different waiter came to our table and said - being very snotty - that we would have to leave. 

""We need you to leave, we've been closed for about an hour now."" We were both so taken aback by the rude and pretentious attitude that we really didn't know what to say... it would have been comical had we watched the night play out from a distance. 

We were told Hamptons served until 11pm- we showed up at 10:30 and waited a good 30 minutes for our order to even be taken. So a restaurant that claims to seat and serve until 11pm, then also expects to be shut down and close for the night... AT 11PM? 

I'll also add that when we arrived and said 'two for dinner' the hostess made no mention of things shutting down soon or that we would need to hurry and order as the kitchen was almost closing, ect. This after we had been told on the phone they served until 11pm. 

It appears the staff and management need to figure out their actual hours and operations. Do they serve until 11pm? Or is it lights out at 11pm? Or is it 10pm, like their website says? If it is, why did three people on the staff say 11pm. And why do you have another waiter kicking customers out when they've only just finished their meal you served to them at 11pm? 

There are at least 100 other restaurants around that have the same quality and style of food at the same price point as Hamptons. We won't be returning. We can both honestly say nothing like that has ever happened to either of us.",G8LFAjlCCJ8Ivij897PYlg,0,0,1,KtFas6H5q8uCFukvQUIFXQ

The short rib burger was good but not really worth the price. 
The avocado fries looked nothing like the pics seen here. They were barely breaded (more like sprinkled with panko) And delivered to our table. Nothing special. 
The French onion soup was good (best thing I ordered). 
The market veggies with rice was terrible. I actually asked if I could send this dish back because it was that bad.   The veggies didn't go well with the black rice nor did the flavor. Not sure what they used to cook it but it was extremely bland and gross. 
The corn bread was average.

The trout had roughly 2 cups of cooked butter beans on top (couldn't even see the fish).

2862855,2017-12-19,1,KQoeETpQ1nBEQ6fVOtFgWQ,"It's a heady atmosphere here. You almost feel as though you could be in that tony, celebrity-filled eponymous enclave in New York where ""A-listers"" wine and dine and pretend to hide from the paparazzi. The problem is that you may be a little underwhelmed by the lack of attention that YOU get, commoner. It feels very much like you are not a ""somebody"" here. And that if you were a ""VIP"" the experience would be a lot different.  There is very little attention to the customer experience. It is as if the Hamptons folks believe you should feel yourself at home in the understated but very ""on"" hipster decor, and forward-trend food, and not need anything else. But you do. We patrons STILL need to feel as though we are welcomed, and that the restaurant is happy that you stopped in. 

Instead, Hamptons is like that girl who always gets asked to the dance, and your tremulous invitation to her is met with a, ""Meh, I guess."" In other words, where your patronage is concerned, you are met with a firm ""I can take it or leave it"" feeling where Hamptons is concerned. That might work in New York. But that is not a good state of mind for Las Vegas, particularly at Tivoli where even more imaginative and satisfying restaurants like ""Poppy"" (by Angelo Sosa of ""Top Chef"" fame), and ""Tapas"" (by Alex Estratta), crashed and burned in the EXACT same spot.  

We shall see.  I may give them another chance when I can maybe bring a ""VIP"" so that I get what I suspect is the ""A-list"" treatment at the restaurant and update my review.  

If you do go, sure, the avocado fries are interesting and different, and worth a try, but not as amazing as other reviewers make out. They were a tad greasy the night I went.

In short, the food was okay, but nothing spectacular. The decor is Northeast WASP privilege like the name suggests, but the patio space is what made this multiphase location so great.

We had the deviled eggs, avocado fries, and more delivered by a server who seemed mildly irritated by us, but seeminlgy tolerated us enough to maintain a minimal tip. ""W,"" when customers smile at you and look you in the eye, it's a good thing. Try not to get ahead of yourself. 

Another server who was assisting in cleanup also cleared out plates with an eyeroll. She droled on and on with the table next to us about her Nonna's cooking and when she came to our table, it was with a scowl. I didn't understand the pretension considering we visit Tivoli Village quite often, but it's not a great start for this place - one with a history of restaurant failures.

I had two other people who are in the hospitality industry and the three of us couldn't believe all the challenges. I wrote a review and the management reached out and not only invited us back but corrected all the challenges. This past Sunday night we again visited. The menu has been corrected to reflect the dishes available. The Pork Stew appetizer was big enough for a meal (it was a bit salty but note that neither of us salt our foods). It was very tasty. The NY Strip was cooked to perfection. The mashed potatoes are not a side of potatoes but more of a smear on the bottom of the plate. My guest said they were great and would have like just a bit more of them. The presentation was nice. The Trout with the white beans was fresh and nice option for fish. The avocado fries are well an acquired taste. For someone who loves avocado this just isn't my thing. We also had the deconstructed Buttermilk Chicken sandwich (no-bun). It was tasty but not what was expected. When you think of Buttermilk Chicken you think of the thick and crunchy batter. Don't get me wrong it was great but it was more like a lightly battered chicken breast. Would order again.  The staff is on point and very attentive.

Service: I really wish I would have gotten our server's name as she was wonderful! We dined outside in the patio and she was always checking on us and kept our bottomless mimosas truly bottomless.  She was very friendly and got our orders out to us quickly.  After closing the bill, she kept bringing the mimosas as we hung for another 15 minutes catching up. Fantastic..

Brunch Food:  They brought out 2 complimentary beignets to get us started and they were great.  The honey and powdered sugar was just enough.  The overstuffed bacon and eggs which ended up being fancy deviled eggs was so tasty.  Definitely a brunch staple moving forward. The short rib and fried egg sandwich was such a great messy sandwich to eat.  The short rib and the eggs compliment each other well to make for a great breakfast sandwich on a french roll.

Ambiance: Inside, they had a higher end Contemporary Pottery Barn minimalist decor feel going on which made for a visually pleasing dining experience.  The bar was attractive and looked well stocked with the premium stuff.  Chairs, tables, silverware are all definitely meeting the Summerlin standards for a restaurant in Tivoli village.

I have a new brunch place where I want to try new dishes.  The prices offered value for the quality and location which was a nice surprise. The $15 bottomless mimosas fuels some great conversations over a great brunch meal. Smaller dogs with other patrons were in the patio dining area on our visit which I totally enjoyed as I'm a dog person.  Weekend brunches at the Hamptons is a thing for me in the future when I'm on this side of town.  Enjoy yourself, it's a celebration..=)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,7,5,4,kDwqPFKnrPEQc7KttGWjnA

I had the crab cake benedict and it arrived cooks and although the mini crab cakes were good the benedict and all its ingredients were very bland. The breakfast potatoes were nice and crispy but nothing special. The cherry mimosas on the other hand were fabulous, not sweet, but nice and tart. However the food not being good and the fact that the patio is tucked in the side alley of the restaurant, adjacent to another restaurant's patio, so there's no view or outlook into Tivoli square to people watch, means I won't be going back.

I made reservations for my sister and I @ 11a and in the reservations comment box I had mentioned it was my sisters birthday. As we walked in, it was completely empty. They had just opened. We were greeted by a nice hostess and seated outside at a reserved table. 

The hostess asked whose birthday it was and she said happy birthday to my sister which was nice. As we were seated we were going over the menu, but already knew we wanted mimosas to start. Some time has passed and I remember looking around like where the hell is our server. It's not busy and it doesn't take long for us to decide on drinks. Finally, our server came and got our drinks. 

We ordered the hummus and avocado fries to start. Both delicious and light. Then, my sister ordered a salad and I had the chicken & biscuits. My sister really enjoyed her salad and I loved my dish. Not very appealing looking in the bowl but the flavors and the juicy chicken and biscuits were delicious. 

All in all, Service was good after the first initial 5-8min of just sitting there. It's a bit pricey so keep that in mind. 

I gave them 4 stars because I specifically mentioned in my reservation that it was my sisters birthday. Only the hostess mentioned anything. Would've been nice if the server said something as well or even surprised her with a little dessert. 

Would I eat here again? Sure. But I wouldn't take someone here for a special occasion as they didn't really make it one.",F47atsRPw-KHmRVk5exBFw,2,0,4,xy13JL6Yen7nI1s-hkAnIw

For $23, I got six wings and a rather small portion of ketchup-less fries to go with no napkins, no utensils, and no condiments.  But most memorable was paying for it at the bar. Maybe he was having a bad day, but the bearded bartender brought the order over, stuck a bill in front of me, and made no eye contact and no greeting.  Not even a thank you for my business after I paid. Maybe I'm being too picky, expecting a certain level of decorum and friendliness?

Quite the opposite. Expertly executed. Even those dining with me who are ""meh"" on pancakes thought well of them. This past SA the green chili pork stew caught my attention. What a delicious meal. The braised pork was suspended in a savory and perfectly crafted soup(?) with a fried egg floater. As promised it comes with a plgrilled green chili on the side. Simply delicious. Oh, and a nice piece of corn bread to boot. Overall a perfectly composed dish that I highly recommend. Look forward to my next visit. Funny thing though about the location. Since opening this location in Tivoli has probably gone through about a half dozen restaurants. We always joke that the location is jinxed. Hope Hamptons can break that curse.

The cocktail was somehow watered down, yet overly sweet at the same time. At this point, I just hoped my dinner would be better than the dismal cocktail; I mean, how do you annihilate a Moscow mule?

Unlike what I was told when I called to inquire about dinner options, I was told the only thing that could be made was the vegetables with forbidden rice entree (which honestly sounded good). I made sure to ask the server, who was quite jumpy and borderline nervous, to triple check with the chef to ensure there would be no gluten in my dish. I really didn't want to ruin Memorial Day weekend feeling like garbage. I felt uneasy about the server's ""assurance"" that the dish was safe for celiacs as she and others didn't seem to understand what gluten is and if it might be present in the dish I ordered. Nevertheless, after my third inquiry about gluten, and namely, the presence of soy sauce, I figured the dish was safe and I could eat without worry of falling ill. That was a mistake.

When the dish arrived I was pleasantly surprised as it looked better than expected; however, I was concerned that soy sauce seemed to be in the coconut sauce (based on both appearance and scent). I really didn't want to make a fuss as my date already seemed to think I was being neurotic (those without celiac truly don't understand the suffering we endure with gluten). I decided to go ahead and eat the entree, and about 2 minutes later, I began to have severe stomach pain. When I asked for the fourth time if the dish had soy sauce, it took THREE people to get a solid answer and two of them NEVER returned. The manager that finally returned to break the news even tried to deflect by saying simply, ""there's soy in the dish"". FYI: soy is NOT gluten. Soy sauce, however, has gluten due to the presence of wheat. Soy is NOT soy sauce! The staff here seriously needs to learn their ingredients and be WAY more cautious about serving individuals with allergies/celiac disease. I was CRYSTAL CLEAR that soy sauce was unacceptable and that soy alone would not induce any symptoms of celiac disease. Again, soy and soy sauce are two different things!

Overall, Hamptons was extremely careless and handled the situation poorly. I do understand it's unpleasant to tell a patron they have just been given an ingredient that will make them sick (i.e., poisoned), but I do not understand the outright inability to face that patron and tell them the truth. In the case of a food allergy, it could potentially be a life or death situation. Based on my experience at Hamptons, I will not be returning, and I will certainly not recommend this establishment to anyone.",rJvKwSkbrHphPUK66Fw86A,20,9,1,tNkck528-h9b58nk5KhDUA

The avocado fries are to die for and the BBQ Bacon burger is the best burger I have ever eaten.  I love clear across town but would make the trip over hear as often as possible.

My husband had the Prime Rib Pork Chop which was over cooked. My kids had the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich which was delicious, but the braised short ribs and grilled swordfish were both very dry.  I had the Hampton burger which was bland and tasteless.  The menu looked amazing which made it so disappointing .",8tX-EprIfJarL2n88bnqkw,1,0,2,jF12yWls8-UgnU8-VRBOsA

Deviled Eggs - 5/5 This is delicious all around, and I enjoyed how OVERSTUFFED they were. Of course, this was not your typical deviled eggs as they had a hint of heat to it along with yummy textures from the sliced bacon bits and celery. It's a must try. 

Chicken Pita - 4/5 I love everything about this sandwich. It's not too heavy but it's not too light either. It has the right balance of vegetables and hummus that just made it refreshing to eat even for dinner. This, however, did not come with fries. It came with pickled vegetables which was a sweet surprise. I didn't actually think that I would like it because it really resembled boiled vegetables but, it was yummy! This is also a must try. We were told that this was the vegetable that it come with the appetizer hummus that you order separately. So I thought this was a 2-in-1 combination. 

Cubano Sandwich - 5/5 Not your average sandwich as it had the right balance of condiments, meats, and vegetables. Think about this food as, revolutionary. I also loved the seasoned fries it came with. It's a must get! 

Country Steak Chicken - 4/5 Delicious but I prefer the Cubano! Hey, they can't always be perfect, right? 

Chocolate Cake - The best chocolate I've ever had and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like chocolate cake. It's rich with the right balance of frosting. It's also very big, and can easily be shared with four people! 

Carrot Cake - Yum! My favorite cake made even better. It's moist, rich, and all-around-delicious. This is also very similar to the chocolate cake which is huge in portion! Easily shareable with four people! 

Service: Honestly, it's not the best. It's about your average service which can be a hit or miss. A lot of times they'll tend to ignore you or they'll take a while to serve. Not a fan and I hope they change it! 

Ambiance: Love the design and the intimate setting here. There's an upstairs and a downstairs area and also an outdoor. We always sit inside downstairs possibly because we don't have a reservation. But nonetheless, it's modern with a tough of industrial. Kudos to their designer because I love coming here partly because of the ambiance.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,4,2,5,KAVUIn7ooP_Fnh9cgZvgeA
