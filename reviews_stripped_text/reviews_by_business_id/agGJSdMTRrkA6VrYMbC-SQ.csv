The steak is always choice meat. We get the bento box which is your choice of 4 items and is a great price for the amount of food they give you. Eveything we have ever tasted on the menu has always satisfied us. Oh and they have a sauce bar with some genius sauces. My favorite is the sweet garlic. YUUUMMMM.

I love the easy-to-read menu. It makes for simple and fast ordering. Got the bento box with chicken and wild caught salmon (I won't eat farm raised), which was a treat.

It was actually too much food and I left half of the rice.

The proteins were perfectly prepared. The brown rice was a little more wet than I prefer, but they just opened for the day and probably don't want the rice to dry out.

Also got the spring rolls, which were wrapped like an egg roll. It was a little mushy inside, but tasty. 

Will try the veggies and grilled Japanese rice next time. 

Also tried 3 sauces, hot lava (amazing and lived up to the name), hot mustard (not mustardy enough), and ponzu sauce (not enough vinegar).

But really really happy overall and I will be back.

Also it was clean and liked the staff.",Hvz5N9S9OAU_CruqkvtD4w,0,1,5,Grv_f4k2guf21VUV6Yvgew

The lady behind the register said it came with plenty of proteins and veggies. First off, it doesn't come with veggies. Worse than that, the portions are so tiny that I was absolutely shocked by their stinginess. I'm talking 5 pieces of shrimp and fewer than 10 chunks of beef. To top it off, their noodles are a complete failure. They are worse than Panda Express noodles. I was lied to by their employee and fell completely ripped off by their kid size portions.

592235,2016-07-09,0,agGJSdMTRrkA6VrYMbC-SQ,"I shop at the Firearms dealer down the way from this location so stopping here over the breakfast place seemed the better option.

A little dark on the interior atmosphere at first glance but once your eyes settle from the Vegas sun it's actually very comforting and relaxing.  

You're hit with a fresh grilled meat flavor as soon as you walk in the door that get your tastebuds going crazy and ready to eat.

Prices are reasonable for the plate they give and for being a fairly simple menu it hits the nail on the head.  Protein options include Grilled Chicken, Angus Beef, and even Tofu and other options but just a few for reference. Personally I stayed with the Chicken. That paired with brown rice and grilled vegetables was a perfect light lunch.  When I say light I mean each ingredient in a different portion, my only gripe being the amount of rice they offer, far too much but still the bowl and portion size was well worth the price.

If you're in this area for any reason and decide against sandwiches, burgers, or eggs I HIGHLY suggest giving these guys a shot.  We will be back and I thank the service for a pleasant experience.",PSqKhpqcWzfqhuBXXM9Lxg,2,0,5,sfeRi_D7DHWFojvQ3Qws8w

Yeah, sure it was my fault for (possibly leaving it). I called the place to ask if I left an ID there and the employee was on it and said sure i'll check. Minutes go by and she's like ""what can I get for you?"" And I just repeated myself, wondering what's been happening the whole time I'm on hold. She said ""can you just call back later we're kinda busy right now."" They just opened, but fine if you are busy right now, don't tell me ""sure i'll check"" and come back to me with ""what can I get for you?"" YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT IN THE BEGINNING, so no time is wasted. She didn't even bother lying, you could have said YES or NO, regardless if you really checked or not and that would have been a better answer than being CLUELESS.

The only reason why I didn't bother is because I have already requested a new one, but would like to know where the one I lost was. I have worked in a restaurant and people leave ID's, it's nothing new...",BuocMrMZupjvccSl4Kly6g,0,0,1,dz9xyyCBBNtAkAiX4kqT1g

It was kinda neat to enter through an automatic sliding door. When I entered, the place was empty, but not a big deal. I approached the counter and there were several employees at the front, but none of them greeted me or seemed to care that there was a customer there.  But I decided to order a bowl with Angus beef. Specified that I wanted it 'to go'.  While I waited for my food, I perused the sauce bar and ladled a few of them to try.  Then I sat down and waited for my order. One of the employees brought me my order but they neglected to realize that I had wanted it for takeout.  Honest mistake, so no biggie.

When I got home, I was disappointed in the portion size of the bowl. It was almost all rice and veggies and very little actual meat. The beef itself was tender, but I really didn't feel as I got my money's worth.

We walk up and they have a automatic sliding door for us fat people who are sick of opening doors, I admit it was pretty cool. The decor is nice, the staff is friendly, but the food was excellent for the price. We were sick of eating chicken all week so we were looking forward for some surf and turf. 

We order the box with the Angus steak. My wife got the tempura shrimp and I got the sautéed shrimp. For our sides, I got the noodles and pot stickers. My wife got the salad and the spring rolls. Also, we shared a soda which was nothing special. 

Then we checked out the sauce bar. They have a lot of choices from spicy to creamy flavors. My wife loves mixing sauces up and I liked the spicy ones. But they weren't abrasive in spiciness, I mean if you call something ""lava"" it should be fucking hot and spicy. 

We ate everything and it was great, but the spring rolls were like, whatever. To sum it all up, we had a great experience eating there, however my wife was piss because our table didn't have napkins. We would definitely got back!",TD_ivolXm17FsWz4bm94-A,1,1,4,q2ObGwsy411QYPM3RG67zw

They all come with small cucumbers and an orange peel which ties in a nice, refreshing flavor. 

It is a little pricey, especially if you upgrade the proteins at all (The Angus beef is an extra $2.50 I believe) so it ends up being around $15. It's a good portion of food though and the quality seems excellent so I think it's worth it.

It's lent season & Fridays mean no meat for me. I came here one random Friday for lunch because I was craving salmon and well, ya girl spent $13 for a lunch combo. I mean, I don't know about you, maybe I'm just sortakinda poor but that is a pretty steep price for me. A bento was already $9.49 for one protein, rice, noodles & salad but because I ordered salmon, $3 was added on top of that price. Three freaking dollars.. for a small piece of salmon. The salmon was seasoned alright but became more flavorful with the sweet teriyaki sauce from the sauce bar (which, btw, is pretty epic). After finishing the salmon with a couple of bites, I was left with so much rice, noodles and salad. $13 did not feel worth it anymore.

I'm not going to argue with the quality and taste of the food. I've had their steak & it was tasty! The customer service is also great and the sauce bar is awesome.

Evidently, the manager and staff are misinformed on laws pertaining to service animals.  I have a physical disability in which I require a service animal.  I was asked for my service dog's ID, which violates the American Disabilities Act.  When I spoke with the manager and showed her the laws pertaining to the ADA, she then told me it would be okay that I stayed but would need to sit away from any other patrons.  Isolation from other patrons is another violation of the ADA.  

It has been extremely difficult in the past 3 years adjusting to a new life having CRPS, the most painful condition ever recorded, but feeling as if I am being discriminated against because of it just adds to the difficulties.  Needless to say, I won't be returning to Volcano Grille.

UPDATE:  After posting this review, I was immediately contacted by ownership to apologize and ask how to make this situation right.  The owner agreed to post the laws concerning service animals in his business for all employees to read.

My bf introduced me to volcano grille at their new location a month ago and we have been eating here one a week!

The chefs are friendly and all about quality! You get what you pay for and that's why some things are additional (steak, shrimp, etc.) but it is well worth it. Today we ordered the bento--certified angus steak, grilled shrimp, grilled veggies and Japanese fried rice and a bowl--grilled shrimp, tofu and white rice. The white rice is good but I am definitely getting the Japanese fried rice next time!

There are many things I love about this restaurant. The service is great, the food has no added sauce (there's a sauce bar so you can control the sauciness and the spice), the shrimp is quality (not like the ones in china town...yikes), they have outdoor seating, and taking food to go always makes my co workers jealous ;)",n9qd2GsOBzQf4pBCLcZ8CQ,3,1,5,2sxvMD1e2MZHx7iR9Pc3Mw

So when you order you can choose which bento you want, ranging from what you get on the bento. I got the big bento so I chose 2 sides and 2 proteins, only problem I had was that the only proteins that you can get with the bento without paying extra was just for chicken. Other than that all the other proteins like steak, salmon, or even poke was like $2.50 extra!! Omg so my order would come out to $15 total since the big bento is $10 and the two meats I chose was poke and salmon.

2284726,2015-10-25,3,agGJSdMTRrkA6VrYMbC-SQ,"Had always seen this place when I'm at Stacks and Yolks so I was more than eager to try it. 

Honestly, it was really just like any other terriyaki/hawaiin/japanese fast food restaurant. The food wasn't bad don't get me wrong but nothing really stood out about it. The price however did, its actually a little bit pricey for what it is. 

So there really is only 3 options on the menu but the concept of picking your own protein and side adds a little fun to the process. What I liked however was their ""sauce bar"". They had quite a few different sauces to pick from to add to your meats. My favorite the wasabi sauce, DELICIOUS! The sauce bar definitely made the experience different and worth the trip.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,7,4,4,mGzcangI6QVIWhJ0uwNxvw
2304014,2015-05-13,0,agGJSdMTRrkA6VrYMbC-SQ,"I final got around to another bookmark off my list. So much so decided to come again try more of the different sauces. The sauces are by FAR the signature for Volcano Grille that will leave lasting impression whether good or bad. In bigger picture look at the menu it your basic healthy protein, choice of sides, and most part reasonable priced. The thing that became fan on my first visit lead to next week another visit. Not only choice of sauces (honest on my first visit the gentlemen never really gave me the heads up; thankfully read some yelp reviews figure out you just pour any sauces want in dixie cup and enjoy) but choice of protein chicken one visit and second angus beef both cooked spot on, LOVE the mixed vegetables choice (I had been too many teriyaki madness style places in life; the worst part is looking at the assorted vegetable amounts to boiled carrots, maybe broccoli, and cabbage NO flavor) nice selection from roasted red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and think onion also all of the options have nice grill marks well seasoned and perfect compliment for healthy meal. The starch have brown rice but so not fan of brown rice in general stuck with my white rice action. The diversity comes not only to the sauce but choices of protein (chicken, angus beef, shrimp tempura, tofu, and more), sides (brown rice, white rice, yakisoba noodles, and more), and just meal from bento box down bowl action. I did both one day bento box comes with two choices of protein and two sides. The bowl another day its one choice of protein, one side, and vegetables come with it. The sauces the first visit tried the spicy teriyaki sauce and the next visit the sweet and tangy sauce. The spicy teriyaki sauce was good! It not much spicy except for some chili flakes but the base teriyaki sauce was good. I felt like not bottle but fresh made. The sweet and tangy was interesting. It had a nice subtle sweetness but well balance with the tangy part or who knows tangy. Lol! I would use that sauce that again bottom line. I believe over 10 sauces so really can go in every day of the week and not have the same sauce!! The thing about the sauces is no extra charge and can get as much as you like. 

The decor is nice nothing really bland but nothing that blow your mind. I do like one wall the art work with the whole volcano and almost village below. The menu is right above the counter nice size so easy to read and figure out your options. The service is awesome. I like the music they play in the restaurant modern current upbeat music.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,1,1,4,UP1ncg_ohBXWWZacsJRW-A

This time I opted for the seaweed salad but kept everything else the same. It was close to closing and they were a little busy but not really an excuse to mix up my order and give me beef instead of chicken. I was really looking forward to chicken so I was a little disappointed to find they gave me beef. Was a little too busy and too close to closing time to ask for it to be remade so I ate it anyways. Was ok but nothing bothers me more than having an order mixed up. I always hate to ask especially when you can see it's just a bunch of kids because there's no telling what they are going to do to the food on a remake. I will probably not return for this reason.

I ordered a two protein bento box. The veggies that I ordered weren't fresh. It looked like they were cooked in the morning or the day before and kept inside a covered pot until they reheat it to be served. 

The chicken also looked precooked and not fresh. 

Stay away from the sweet garlic sauce. It makes your breath kick even after flossing, 2x brushes, and mouth washing. 

For 10.99... You expect the food to be fresh because teriyaki grill is one building down and offers fresh food for less than that.

This was my first time trying this place and I was pretty pumped for it considering all the glowing reviews..

Positives-

- That Angus beef is the shizz! Freshly cooked, tender and juicy!
- service was friendly
- Didn't eat in, but the restaurant was small but cozy and clean
- Did I mention the Angus beef was tasty as flock!


Meh-

-I decided to try a bowl with Angus beef with Japanese brown rice with NO vegetables. Check out the pics to see what I got when I got home. Seriously, this is annoying. It was on my receipt and the girl repeated it back to me. So why do I have a bowl that is 1/3 veggies??
- honestly did not care for the rice. maybe I am spoiled by homemade jasmine rice daily (Thank you Mama!), but this tasted a bit stiff.
- Kinda pricey. I grabbed the bowl, an extra side of Angus beef, and 4 gyoza (beef pot stickers essentially) and that ran me a little north of $18. No drink at all, since I took it to go. Damn. I just finished all of it and I'm not even full! 
-the gyoza were ok. Just ok. Not the best I've ever had. Not the worst I've ever had. Somewhere in the middle.


I really wanted to like this place, but this experience left me feeling underwhelmed. I did love the taste of the meat, but with so many other options in the area, I don't see a return visit any time in the foreseeable future. 

I considered a 2 star review, but that Angus beef bumped it up to 3. Who knows? maybe I'll try the place one more time down the road...maybe..

I've had the yakisoba, fried rice, chicken, shrimp, beef, mixed veggies, tofu, and salmon. I like to switch it up each time I go. Everything is usually pretty flavorful, but not too salty, which I like. The flavor of the tofu wowed me, I thought it would be pretty flavorless and I would have to add one of their large selection of sauces on top, but surprisingly, I was able to eat it without. 

The only part I don't like is that sometimes the food is overly oily. Once we had yakisoba that was sitting in a pile of oil :/ We ate the top half, but left the extra oily noodles on the plate. 

I like that they have a variety of sauces that you can play around with. Personally, I like the magma and the yum yum sauce. 

Each time I come here, I order their dessert. They only have one option, but it's pretty good. Especially for someone with a sweet tooth. It's a warm chocolate cake/moist brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. The two temperatures combined makes a wonderfully delicious combination.

This place was amazing. After seeing the bento box constantly show up on my facebook feed, I finally got to find out how delicious this place was. I ordered exactly what they have on their facebook ads. The bento box with beef and salmon. I checced out the condiment station and I strongly recommend the Japanese Salsa. Not only was my order done in under 10 minutes but I think my tastebuds had an orgasm!!! Fittingly, the restaurant had H-Town's ""Knoccing The Boots"" playing and that's exactly what my tastebuds did with the bento box. They made extreme passionate, whispering sweet nothings into your ears type of love in my mouth.

First off, customer service. Greeted with a nice, ""Hello, how is it going?.""  Warm vibes to start. Awesome. 
Ordering food I got excited cause I saw they had a variety of combinations such as chicken Katsu, steak, teriyaki chicken etc. I chose the katsu and the steak for some extra amount. 
Love the idea of having the sauces out just like in a taco shop like Roberto's or lauritas, but they had a few different sauces such as the Katsu sauce of course and a few different types of salsa( I can't quite remember all the sauces they had), but they were pretty good with my meal, cause my meal needed it. 
Katsu was layered on top and it was alright. Dry for the most part so the sauces on the self serve came in handy. The steak was a bit overcooked. Came in chewy. Portion wise it was really small compared to some (one of them being makai). Finished it but was still feeling hungry and usually at the latter, I have some to go. 
Overall nice concept on fitting in and being a healthy to go spot. Main stars for the sauces and the customer service.",TESKhJp4c8cXmJwh5wXkXQ,3,2,3,iApDoJRgeLXEsYgVcOtkVQ

Same great tasting food, different location.  It's 5 minutes from our house.  My boyfriend's mom told us about this gem 3 years ago.  We've fallen in love with the experience & the food.  Very happy to find a place that we can ALL eat healthy without having an allergic reaction.

I personally like to get the Bento boxes (starting $9) add chicken, steak, fried rice & grilled veggies. Their fried rice is the closest thing I'm used to for REALLY good fried rice.  It's similar to what we're used to on the East Coast. Their sweet garlic sauce is awesome,  but I enjoy the food just how it is.  They have plenty sauces to sample, I usually put a tiny bit in the cup & go up again if I like it. Sweet garlic is my favorite. 

The portions are right, priced reasonably & served fresh. Can't wait to go back again. Now we live closer too. I wish these guys the best of luck with their new location. It's a beautiful new atmosphere & centrally located. They deserve it.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,6,5,5,Kv7kVoRmhIhw_30_8Qz6MA

I'm a person really looking for nutrients. And expected that from my ordered. Not paying close to 15$ and getting a bunch of rice instead of vegetables that I told you I wanted as my main.

This is conveniently located at the southwest side of town near 215 and Durango.  This new location is larger and has a more inviting feel than the old location.  

I'm a fan of the sauce bar.  Yum Yum and spicy mustard sauce are my favorite.

This is the place to go when you want to go healthy.  They used to have a low carb item on the menu where your plate includes just veggies and protein.  Even though it's not on the menu, you can still opt out the carbs.  You can't go wrong with steak, veggies, and rice.  I would say this is like the fast food version of Benihanas because their food is just as good, but affordable and served fast.

My Hubby & I both had a bento box--I had shrimp, brown rice, yakisoba noodles and grilled veggies. With the exception of the shrimp, the portions were generous especially the rice--looked about two cups! The shrimp was an additional cost so I was surprised to only get 5 of them but they were well seasoned and delicious. 
My Hubby got the certified angus beef, chicken, rice and yakisoba noodles. I tasted the beef & chicken and was very impressed at how tender the beef was as well as the chicken. The bento box also came with seasoned cucumbers which I thoroughly enjoyed. They also have an extensive sauce bar but as usual, after trying a few of the sauces, I migrated back to my favorite hot mustard.

 I'm really picky about eating at places that have high food quality, and their food surpasses my expectations. My favorite items are the chicken bowl and omelette roll bowl since I have a smaller appetite, always with fried rice because it is by far the best I've ever had. I also love their steak, even though I'm not big on red meat. It's certified angus beef and you can really taste the difference in how flavorful, tender and juicy it is. Yum!

I'm shocked that I never actually looked at this yelp profile before. Living by this place for 2 years now and I've thought it was a hibachi place like ohjah or Benihana. Nope! It's more like a fast & fresh place. 

Being that this was my first time, and clearly not what I was expecting to eat, I stared at the menu for a good 5+min. It would have been helpful to have someone ask if it was my first time and maybe explain the menu a little to me. Also, even though it was close to closing time, all of the tables were dirty. Gotta keep up on that!

I ended up settling with a bento box with the steak, katsu, noodles, salad, and spring rolls. First off, the food is really good. No question about me coming back there. The steak was so tender that it had the same taste and feel to what I was expecting at a hibachi. The only thing is that there were sauces in a thing up front. I didn't realize those were sauces for customers to grab at random. I had walked by then and ate my whole meal thinking ""man, some good sauce would top this"". That's something that could have been avoided by someone explaining how the place worked. 

Last thing, and not really a negative, but the sliding door confused me lol. It took me a second to realize there was no handle. However, this is genius! Why don't every place do this?!",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,2,1,4,X-wr6JsAAA_PWIxTDf396A

I ordered the salmon bento with 4pc spring roll (side order).  The salmon is not worth the $13.28 i paid for.  Neither is the $2.99 for the spring rolls.  The frozen salmon that you can get from Walmart is bigger than the one in the bento.  The biggest section in the bento box was occupied by the salad & not the main entree. They had a sauce bar which was a ""sure I'll try that"" afterthought for me, but totally just a space filler on the counter.  To end on a positive note, the rice was cooked well & so was the noodles.  (See photos for reference)

The angus steak upgrade is always worth it. You can tell all of the ingredients are high quality and freshness. I've tried the steak, shrimp, tempura shrimp, salmon, and chicken and all have impressed me. 

I recently stopped eating rice so I opted for veggies the last time I was there. I was expecting some lettuce, carrots, broccoli, you know the standard steamed veggies. Nope. What I got was a pile of steamed/seared tasty goodness. Seasoned well, shredded carrots and zucchini, with hand cut broccoli and onions.

I always go for the magma sauce with some lava mixed into it. Amazing flavor and not too much heat.

4823742,2017-03-25,3,agGJSdMTRrkA6VrYMbC-SQ,"Holy COW!!!! What a discovery!! I'm clearly the last person to hear about this place based on the plethora of incredible reviews. 

My boyfriend and I came here yesterday for lunch after I scoped it on Yelp. The boyfriend almost* vetoed it, because ""how good can a bento box really be?""

It can be INCREDIBLE! 

He had the steak bento with the salad, brown rice and veggies. I opted for the chicken breast, salad, veggies and brown rice.

The steak here is incredible. Seriously. I know what you're thinking... c'mon Laney, how good could it possibly be? Well... it's tender, not chewy, not stringy, and tastes like the ribeye at Hakkasan. Boom.

The chicken; also fantastic!! It comes cooked in garlic and is all white meat with no chewy-tendon-y pieces. 

The brown rice was perfectly cooked, the veggies were fantastic-- not mushy or weird-- super fresh. 

Couple the fantastic meal with the fact that they have an entire sauce bar and I'm in my happy place. The sauce bar has teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, spicy mayo, yum yum sauce, creamy miso, wasabi dressing and more.

Some people complain about the pricing at this place, but it's really not that bad! Wouldn't you rather pay a couple dollars extra for an incredible meal, rather than get a cheap crap meal? Life's too short for bad food!

Went in and saw only 3 other people (around 12:30) in there and decided to have it to go. I ordered the big bento with two protein (beef and shrimp) and two sides (fried rice and yakisoba), everything had a lot of black pepper in it. The beef and shrimp were both extra charge on top of the base $10+ for the ""Big Bento"". I could only see that chicken did not have any extra costs to it but salmon and poke both having to pay extra for also. Why all the extra charge for their protein items, I don't get it. The food was okay but very bland. The only thing that really stood out was their use of black pepper in all the food I had (beef, shrimp, fried rice, and yakisoba)

 My lunch came out to $18+ with a regular drink, not crazy but did not feel it was worth it. Good thing they have all those sauces to add flavor to the food but overall I did not enjoy it. They do give you a good portion of fried rice and yakisoba, but I just did not eat it due to lack of seasoning and did not want to pour sauces over rice and noodles, ended it up wasting food.

I decided to try out Volcano Grille before a painting session at nearby Design and Dine because I wanted some REAL food that I could enjoy in peace. Plus, I've had this place bookmarked for a while. The extremely affordable bowl option, which includes 1 protein and 1 rice or noodle and the option of veggies, is what sealed the deal for me. 

TOFU YAKISOBA BOWL W/VEGGIES ($6.99): Can someone please tell me how to cook tofu like Volcano Grille? Seriously, this is some of the tastiest tofu I've ever had in my life (and I eat a lot of tofu). It was seasoned and cooked to a perfect texture that made it easily sliceable with a plastic fork. I loved the spread of colorful fresh veggies in the bowl - red bell peppers, broccoli, green onions, carrots, and white onions, oh my! I added a cup of spicy teriyaki sauce from the sauce bar for an extra kick. The serving size was just the right portion. 

VIBE: Volcano Grille is like a more authentic version of Teriyaki Madness. Same concept though - a quick serve restaurant where you order at the counter and help yourself to fountain drinks and tableware. 

Worth a Return Visit?
If I'm in the area, I would definitely eat here again.

(2) The location is all the way in the small Southwest corner of Vegas - I only found this place because the grub at Ikea looks like dog food

I'll definitely come back again, but dunno when.  I already have a couch.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,4,2,4,LMO9btAyJlTIrLML5ZXWkA

I recommend the Bento Box $10.49. You get 2 items and 2 sides. There's a decent amount to choose from, although, most of the items you have to pay a little extra (such as the Certified Angus Beef +$2.15, Shrimp +$2.35, Premium Salmon +$2.99, Shrimp Tempura +$1.15). The ones that come at just the bento box are chicken breast, tofu, and grilled vegetables. So most of the stuff are at a little extra charge. I usually get the beef and tofu. Tofu isn't what I expected but still enjoyable nonetheless. The portion for the beef is very small so just a heads up.

In terms of sides, I usually get white japanese rice and grilled veggies. The gyoza in particular is better than expected, so definitely recommend that.

If you don't want the bento box, they also have the $7.99 bowl which gives you 1 choice of protein, and either 1 rice or noodle. I have yet to get that since I prefer the bento box but this is a great option if you're not as hungry.

Service is great. You only interact with the one cashier pretty much and they've always been friendly to me.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,4,0,4,kz_xFp7NPswm7nP-eB2_fg

They have a sauce bar with some awesome deliciousness. The sweet garlic sauce and the yummy sauce are... Well... Sweet and yummy!!  

I've been going to volcano grille since they opened at their previous location but this new place even better. Roomy, good music, nice comfortable seating and a casual but nice vibe.

I'm not sure why no one else has stressed the fact that this place is a pricier option compared to their nearby competitors. With that being said my husband and I are still addicted to eating here at least once or twice a week. We normally dine in and the place can get a bit warm inside especially when it's packed on busy days. The music playing is always an added bonus as well while dining in but the sticky tables can be a turn off.

There were a few people eating their bentos outside and one other person inside the restaurant. I decided to get the Big Bento and did not realize that some of the proteins were extra charge. No big deal, but it was kind of expensive for average food. I wanted salmon and tofu, but the employee apologized and said that they were out of tofu. So I chose the beef instead, along with brown rice and spring rolls. I waited about 10 minutes for my to go order, but I didn't mind. I like how everything is made to order, unlike places like Panda Express where you never know how long the food has been sitting out. 

My food was still hot and fresh when I got home. I really liked the beef. It was tasty, cooked well and delicious! The salmon was alright. I regret not taking home some of the sauces from their sauce bar, which probably would have made it better. However, another customer was taking his sweet time at the sauce bar the entire time I was waiting for my food. I think he took one of everything, LOL. The spring rolls were bland tasting and not recommended. 

Overall, customer service was friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I didn't think the food was worth $16, although the beef was pretty good. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other options, but for the price, I can get better food elsewhere.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,2,3,dJoRZJgjm-nzA-199DLtbQ

5995182,2017-04-06,1,agGJSdMTRrkA6VrYMbC-SQ,"My girlfriend and I made plans specifically to visit this Volcano Grill. I've been looking for a place worth visit for bento boxes and the only ones that really offers them are sushi places. So I was thrilled to see that there was a restaurant solely for bento. 

A lot of features from this place seemed to be off-putting to me. For starters, the meals are so expensive for the mediocre flavor and portions. I felt they went on the cheaper side of things and hoped they take off from such dirty business. 

First off, I ordered a regular bento box which included one protein and two sides. This comes with salad by the way. I got the salmon which costs extra, of course. As for my two sides, I got the Grilled rice which was basically fried rice and grilled vegetables. My salmon was cut in the shape of a fish which was creative but at the same time, I felt like it was off-putting. I'm trying to avoid the thought that I'm eating another animal so having reminded that it used to be a fish in the same shape kind of made me loss my appetite. At the same time, I thought about the scraps of fish that could've been on my plate instead of a cheesy-looking fish. The flavor was delicious but that was it. The portion of the rice along with the veges did not mix well. Also I got salad with it which was a bit of an overkill when it comes to veges. 

My girlfriend got the bigger size of bento because she's a hungry hippo :P With the presentation, she was less than impressed. Three egg rolls badly placed on the plate so there was lots of room to play around with. The rice was a tad bit bland. And the chicken Katsu was not notable enough for another visit. For the price we paid for, I think we deserved some drinks along with it. 

This isn't your regular sit down restaurant where someone waits on you. The food is ordered at the counter and deliver to your table. The service was average but friendly. Nonetheless, it was a nice try but nothing here won me over.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,5,1,2,qRBPUjy0Z3ehzABOD4aj0A

They have automatic sliding doors which is convenient if you're holding things in your hand. When you walk you go straight to the cashier to order and there's an area next to the cashier with a bunch of different sauces which I thought was cool. 

I ordered the lunch special with yakiaona noodles, premium salmon which was $1.99 extra, and a spring roll (which was really an egg roll). Also, if you check in on Yelp you either get a free drink or some free gyoza. 

Overall, I liked the food and the amount in the lunch special was good enough for me to finish the whole meal. I thought it was weird that there was no where to throw our trash away, but the cashier told us to leave our finished dishes there and she'd be the one to clean it later.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,4,qSBLoUPoidIh558LQfUmkA
