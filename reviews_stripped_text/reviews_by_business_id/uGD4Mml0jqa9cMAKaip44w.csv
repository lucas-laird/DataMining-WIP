I had some breakfast for lunch :)",19uBC840gZ-BrIfI3Fae4w,1,0,4,FC6tL1n-EqTQSDCoKgtiIg

We had the chicken pate and french onion soup for starters.  We ordered  the chicken crepe and the fish of the day which was an amazing salmon with crab meat on top.  The whole thing was topped off with a nutella, strawberry, banana crepe.  

Josette is quite unique and she welcomes everyone to the place like they're an old friend.  I can see her approach to dining is what brings people back and makes them ""regulars"".  We plan on coming back too.

She also runs a wine tasting every 3rd Thursday of the month which we will be at 4/17 for sure!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,4,4,5,HHvm5OJjy6Etp9lFAbyMBA
