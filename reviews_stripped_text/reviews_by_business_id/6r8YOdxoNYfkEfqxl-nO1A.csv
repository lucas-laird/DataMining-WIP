So many people came and left because nobody was working.

Sign says 24 hours.  Please put a closed sign if you don't want to serve your customers.",_OYV80gtowHPS0ssAvzcSQ,0,0,1,3-RK4rRfbJp9VIh4-yO1aQ
889933,2013-03-03,0,6r8YOdxoNYfkEfqxl-nO1A,This subway is located in the very back of the Casino Royale Hotel on the strip. We wanted to try something a little healthy but quick while in Vegas so we decided on this Subway since it was next to our hotel. Two footlongs cost $10 a piece but they were good. Quick service nice staff !,RuAVetC2OriTVTLVX7Lwlg,0,0,3,p8q5rPMsiU7XlX2tLv0YbA

1369375,2014-09-11,0,6r8YOdxoNYfkEfqxl-nO1A,"Ordered an egg & omelet foot-long, right on the menu. Couldn't make it, she said....only during breakfast hours. I pointed out it is on their all-day menu, as in every Subway on earth. She summoned the manager, who agreed with the help. I pointed it out on the all-day menu, in bold letters. She turned and stared the menu for a full minute.. That was a long wait. Finally she turned and  explained it's not a foot-long, bur only an omelet...no bread. This was the manager! I should've called her bluff & asked to go ahead and make me an omelet....I'm sure it would have been comical. Instead I told her to forget it, and got myself something at the Chipotle Grill nearby. I think this Subway has a training problem!.",01ZxqYFpUVYqtenxcszp1Q,0,0,1,3nlTOwVEV2hBq5lIQB6HrQ
1407365,2018-05-05,0,6r8YOdxoNYfkEfqxl-nO1A,"I am not sure if there is even any management at this location as all the employees don't seem to have the proper training. The employees have a bad attitude and don't seem to care about their job or the product that goes out to customers. I am pretty sure if there was to be a health inspection they would probably fail, it seemed EXTREMELY unsanitary. I asked for soup and was told they didn't have any. I asked again as I saw the containers and this employee said ""Do you really want soup? I'll ask (her) if she wants to go ahead and make some if you really want it."" I couldn't believe that an establishment inside of a Hotel/Casino (Venetian) is allowed to operate with such poor management. I don't know how much business has been lost due to poor attitude and telling people they are out of product just because they are to lazy to make it. I hope something gets done about this as this is unacceptable.",2TPUYeeaf7R39SiAo5Zi2g,0,0,1,9PCdZg9V3o_3jKYs5E0MZA

Outside of the cost and the hours, 24/7, it is your normal Subway.  I was watching what I ate when I was last in Vegas for work and actually ate here four times.  Every time was solid.",5_PRukpenvklJ28nij8ENg,0,0,3,K0qsG17UzIUC8X9FlyyxCA

Before starting the sandwitch she put on some oven mits and pulled bread out. Using same h love started making my samdwitch. I stopped her and asked if she is going to use the same hlove. Response: do you want me to change them? Well if I didn't I would not be asking. Another person just walked  up picked up the sandwitch threw it away.

Came here for breakfast and had an egg & cheese omelet in a 6"" flatbread = $6. the price aside, it took 15 minutes to make, the egg was undercooked, I didn't get a chance to ask for any veggies in it or even salt & pepper! My wife got the same and boldly asked for veggies which the sandwich assembler reluctantly threw in (literally 1 slice tomato and 2 shreds of lettuce) and charged her extra for them!

Subway was about 2-3 dollars more than I would spend at a Subway in DC metro. It was a little annoying because it wasn't the best subway I ever had. It was mediocre and Subways only saving grace was it allowed me to eat something that wasn't fried.,hzKQOJI8-7TM-BstJpSVCA,3,4,2,zhSyYl68LVL9TBjKkw4VUA
