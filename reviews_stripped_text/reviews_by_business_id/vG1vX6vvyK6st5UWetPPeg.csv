The bartender never comes around to offer beverages, and when I asked for one he rudely said I have to put $10 in a machine and play it, even after I had been there 20 minutes and put in a $20. Finally I got a Dr Pepper...just ONE can and had been playing for about 2 hours. I won $100 and left without tipping him! (Usually I tip my bartenders  $5)",6eEifkcAYYycawSPNslGlg,0,0,2,MQToNTXrg_qjOBvjEU60kQ
