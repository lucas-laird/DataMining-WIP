Upon arrival, not only was the establishment small there were no customers and the menu was limited to everything and nine dollars and above. In a party of eight, We ordered shrimp fried rice, lumpias, sing sing, and other Filipino delicacies, and it did not serve to par. The mixed drinks or eight dollars for a very watered down alcohol, and The chicken was raw and undercooked. The establishment was labeled as a five-star local bar and karaoke, however it had a very big gay club atmosphere.  the karaoke menu was very limited and just not living up to the 5 star that was reviewed on Yelp. Would not recommend it.",zOa5rbFqp_PqQ8rCSKptzw,0,0,1,1o6EV7f9qyvxs7HRl7KFXQ

The Late night hours make it a First thought after a long night of clubbing. The karaoke machine makes it 10X funner. Great service, Karaoke, and dope people make a great time!",gpVqcjtMYX3WE7_roaDZ9Q,2,0,5,TjvMAjEJd-i5OyiIm13wUQ

The pricing was reasonable. We had the night booked. It was nicely decorated for the holidays- festive with lights. The service was really good. It was a good time. Singing, dancing, eating, drinking- the party went off without a hitch. Until one of the birthday celebrants had forgotten his gifts at the bar- a huge bottle of alcohol and a sweater. I just thought that it was shady that no one said ""We found it- we were waiting to hear from you."" I have to be completely honest, it was disappointing.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,3,o8l2Y1ThOOggGp-sla3lcw
