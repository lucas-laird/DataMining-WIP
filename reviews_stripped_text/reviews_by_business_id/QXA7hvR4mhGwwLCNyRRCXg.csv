1341792,2017-04-20,7,QXA7hvR4mhGwwLCNyRRCXg,Horrible horrible horrible. I was looking for a SUSHI place. Not a mixture of Mexican and sushi. First of all I'm not Hispanic and they just start talking to me in Spanish. Then I say I only speak English and she puts down a Spanish menu. I told her I would like a shrimp cocktail. At first I was saying guacamole then I said No nevermind id rather just have the shrimp cocktail. It looks like soup. No shrimp hanging off the top or anything. And then she brings me the biggest guacamole bowl they possibly have. No regard as to what I said. I am actually appalled and very disappointed. DO NOT COME HERE.

I've tried many places, all traditional (Philadelphia roll, California roll, etc.), but this was the first place I tried that was a sushi fusion place. The concept is interesting: Mexican sushi, who would've thought? They pull it off well! Every roll is new to me and has something different to offer. Some are made with beef and chicken, some have cheese on them, and they're all at least worth a try. They're nicely presented, too, because everyone knows you begin eating with your eyes. The place itself is simple: booths and tables, banda music playing through the speakers, and attentive servers. Mexican restaurants aren't known for ostentatious decoration, they're there to give you good food. The food speaks volumes for itself.",irBFVwrnp78Dpqgp7WZGDg,3,1,5,sgdy5hxFghpB8zTymnK0Dw

1963067,2016-10-19,0,QXA7hvR4mhGwwLCNyRRCXg,"A co-worker of mine recommended this place so a few of us came to try this place after work. The place was empty when we first walked in, very nice and clean, they have booths against the walls and tables in the middle, good for large parties. 

This is Mexican style sushi...pretty much sushi rolls with different types of meats and sauces. First of the rolls were very big, the three of us shared 4 rolls and one appetizer and we were stuffed, definitely not like Japanese sushi where the rolls are on the thinner side. 

They have both Spanish and English menu, unfortunately I didn't ask for the English menu until after my co-worker ordered so I don't know the names of any of the dishes we ordered, I pretty much pointed out which one looked good and went with it. 

So they have salty and sweet sushi. The salty sushi rolls are typical shrimp tempura, crab, beef and chicken. The sweet rolls have fruits such as mango, kiwi and strawberry on top. I definitely prefer the salty rolls, the sweet rolls were not bad but maybe have those for dessert? It was strange eating a mix of sweet and salty for lunch. 

They also have oysters, shrimp ceviche and cocktails. One of my co-workers go the shrimp cocktail and said it was very good. I got the Jamaica juice and that was refreshing and delicious, not too sweet. My co-workers got horchata and said that the horchata is very good compared to other places, so definitely check out their drinks. 

My first experience was pretty good, I would have to go back and try other dishes to give a better rating if all goes well, I liked it but was not impressed. In their defense I was with co-workers that were a little picky with their food so we stuck to the basic shrimp tempura and crab rolls, I couldn't try the more unique rolls. But there is always next time!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,1,3,V2l464RFc-lgz6RG2vonYw

I can't read it!! so I didn't know what was in all the rolls. I asked the waitress who was super nice she kinda explained. but I couldn't hold her up and ask her what every little thing is. I decided to take a chance, throw caution to the wind and try somethin new. I got the 2 rolls for 15 bucks, it was a great price, they looked good in the pic and it was somethin new. ittttttt was totally gross and I ended up throwing it away. it was like steak and cheese and some imatatio crab mix with 2 sauces on the side. one that looked like spicy mayo but tasted like thousand island and one that looked like eel sauce but tasted like vinegar. I just didn't like any of it, neither did my dad or husband as I tried to give it to them before throwing it away. now had I actually been able to read the menu without feeling like a nuisance having to ask the server I probably wou ok d have ordered something I liked. some of the pics looked bomb.its also Hella expensive. I mean I can go to sakana or Yama or sushi way and get all you can eat off of a menu I can read for 25 bucks. here some of the rolls are 15 just for one.im sorry to say that I won't go back to this place, there's too many other places to choose from.

2811179,2017-05-31,0,QXA7hvR4mhGwwLCNyRRCXg,First in foremost this is not a sushi restaurant what so ever. I had a a roll the name was in Spanish so I do not remember it I apologize. It was suppose to shrimp tempura in the middle with a spicy sauce and salmon on the outside. The salmon was an absolute disaster and the shrimp tempura was just cold raw shrimp inside. It was nothing like the description. The service was not all that great with only a few tables seated.  My wife had some kinda of Mexican shrimp cocktail that she said was so so. The best part of the meal was the guacamole which was absolutely delicious I really enjoyed it. I will never go back there again and if you are looking for sushi please yourself a favor and don't choose this place and to end on a positive not the place was extremely clean.,wpdKVXz0k0Fk0HouO_-k_Q,0,0,2,F79BYyuyiezUFSjEcmayQg

The staff was friendly and they even have a button to push at your table if you need the waitress at any time. I ordered a michelada which was delicious but the sushi however tasted old and the fish was sliced sooo thin. I give the sushi a 2/5 stars. I've heard the seafood is better than the sushi there so I might go back to try that only because I live closely. If you're going for sushi however, or live far, don't waste your time.

I work at a clinic in the area and wanted to try something close by after work with a friend. The front desk person suggested this place so I thought I'd give it a try. Who doesn't like Mexican food and sushi? 

Walking in we were welcomed and seated right away. Once seated I started looking over the menu. Of course the first thing I look at are the pictures.... When I decided to start reading the menu I was lost... IT WAS ALL IN SPANISH, ahhhhhh!

I decided to order the la lomita roll. 

Wait time was a bit long as it looked like they were short staffed and busy but it was well worth the wait. When the roll came out it was bigger than I expected and tasted delicious.

The customer service is not up to par they don't check up on you at all. the sushi was the only good thing, but I will not come back here. they had issues splitting our bills too it was a big deal!",BSTUa43K1sqiFf1Pp76vGA,2,0,1,n8ht2Je_jsNW0MHEnu_b1w

I heard about a chain in LA doing mexican sushi and it sounded good so I looked for something similar in Las Vegas and I'm so glad I found it.  It was awesome and a must try for anyone looking for something different.,Cn7GAty_r4vN5xs17XB91Q,0,0,5,472PRf16jqAHyy3FrVxS_w

My only complain with this resturant is it took forever to take order. Was sitting at table for a good 15 mins before anyone acknowledged us and I had to get up and let them know ""hey we are ready to order."" Then the waitress proceeded to say oh there's a button you can press to call us. Ummm no one said anything about a button and it was hidden behind all the different hot sauses. Also don't come hungry because they take fooooooreeeevvvvvver to bring out your order.",bf_m3Q7lBOzhSnrjyA0pXQ,3,0,3,aJRZ-c8Yn4iQGt1e4toBAA

Only reason why I come back is because I understand the fusion aspect of the concept of Mexican sushi and I personally think it pairs great with mexican style""mojarra"" seafood. The rolls are great, more so on the spicy side, but the ceviches and the Cheladas are great. It's a fun place, they have service buttons to get ahold of your server if you need something and they're pretty attentive. Not too pricey and a great place to have fun and booths and tables big enough for parties",m29cuCzLIe9D8ARw57QT9w,0,0,4,NIiZUn7rHJ4hMqDd3YA4bQ

5880369,2016-02-25,1,QXA7hvR4mhGwwLCNyRRCXg,"I seen this place at the corner of my eye to notice something different on the east side! 
Looked them up on Yelp, seen a few pictures, read some reviews, and I figured that I just had to try it myself.

It's basically Mexican style sushi.
The concept in my opinion is great!
And for me, the food was too!

I went in for take out, and to my surprise I happened to know the hostess! So my experience here went very well!

I tried my rolls as soon they were ready and I loved them! So if someone dined here and had a tasteless meal, I don't see it happening. I'd assume maybe you just ordered something that wasn't what you'd order to begin with. I'd recommend asking your waitress for help around the menu (I did too, it's always good to get their recommendations). Although, the downfall to their menu was it being in all Spanish. I don't see how that will work for people who can't speak the language. Hopefully they can fix that for everybody else to be able to order easily without bugging the employees so much with questions.

Also, they have a variety of yummy hot sauces and salsas to pair with any food. Which they were also available to buy and I definitely did take some home with me! (:

Can't go wrong!

I'm excited to bring my mom and grandma here!",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,4,1,4,4TkdjTkME47JezgFehVbdQ

Waitress said they are working on. Over all the decor is nice black and red. Music is a little too loud but it not horrible. They have buttons on the napkin holders. I live Sushi and it nice to see something different. Overall good job.,1RM4Sk3GrPSbrjXDYGQdzQ,0,0,4,UkZnX3ppQPwxYgaNs6uYnw
