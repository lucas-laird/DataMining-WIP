A friend and I decided to dine at the bar seating area for the soup/salad/breadsticks special for a late lunch, but what should have been a simple routine order turned into a train wreck that evolved into the last time I eat at OG. 

They had employees (including what appeared to be a manager) wandering aimlessly like malfunctioning roomba vacuums, several tables were left un-bussed for almost an hour, and a complete lack of service even at the basic level left us mind boggled. We watched a couple looking around, waiting for a server, but they did what we should have and walked out after several minutes. Despite knowing what we wanted before we arrived, our order wasn't taken until over a half hour after walking through the door. The salad was under dressed, the breadsticks salty, the soup was fine although the lack of service left a poor taste in our mouths throughout the entire meal. Our server disappeared more often than David Copperfield so locating someone to get a check took several minutes after finishing. The manager finally came over and presented the check but then the train derailed. We immediately put two cards down to pay and waited, and waited, and waited. We looked around, made comments, contemplated just leaving. Nobody wanted to take our money. Finally, 15 minutes later our server reappeared from her disappearing act to run our cards we requested to be split. Obviously too difficult of a task as the entire bill was charged to one card. 

I regret leaving any tip at all, but the biggest tip I can leave is avoid this place and find a nice local family restaurant that will appreciate your business. There are plenty of eateries out there that will make you feel like family.",CcXb9YV8C_LTuojI5-0prw,2,0,1,XHtfHP-JMEcRn2jjHz3hRg

Excited to try the new spaghetti dishes. We waited 5 minutes for a table even though we were the only ones at the host stand but no problem we happily waited. 5 mins no big deal. We get seated in an empty area we are the only table seated in that area. We waited 15 minutes at the table only for no one to come greet us say they will be right with us NOTHING!!!!! So disappointed with the service we got up and left!!!! The restaurant wasn't even busy for us to have to be waiting around with no one even greeting us. So guess My wife and I won't be trying those new spaghetti dishes unless we drive to a farther Olive Garden, because we won't be eating here ever again.

The Zuppa (sp?) and Minestrone are delicious and you can have endless supply.  Bread sticks come with soup and salad.  All is good here.  I've never tried any of the others in Las Vegas,  I stick with what I know to be really good.

I love going to OG because I get my money's worth, but the waitress we had today refused to give us another order of soup and said we couldn't take any breadsticks to go (after telling her other OGs have let us, she gave in). In addition, there was a point in time when she didn't come check on us for 30-40 minutes. I would understand if there was a bunch of people in the restaurant, but we were one of the very, very few tables she was serving. Disappointed but will come back again.

Our waiter was anything but professional I couldn't believe it. When we got our food our waiter pretty much just slammed our food at us and asked if we wanted cheese , we said yes please, so he carelessly puts cheese as if it was a bother that we said yes and gets it all over the table and our clothes. Later my husband asked if he can get another soup and the waiter's exact words were ""you can only get what you already have on the table"" and walks off. We let it go. Then he comes back and we ask him for a box to go he says ""how many because I don't want to make more than 1 trip"". Was that really necessary to say? He brings our boxes and leaves them at our table which is fine but the last 30 times I've been to another Olive Garden the waiter packs our food for us? Then my husbands friend asks if he can get a refill (he never asked us if we needed anything not even a refill) so he says ok, we waited for about 15 minutes he came back with the check and we reminded him of the refill and he says ""oh yeah right"" he comes back and literally slams the drink on the table so hard that the soda splattered up and got on our friend's shirt. Once again the waiter just walks off without an apology. We then just gathered out stuff, payed and left. Never again coming back to this location (We did notice our same waiter was being very nice and attentive with other customers who were Caucasian so if you are not Caucasian DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL BE TREATED WORSE THAN A STRAY DOG).",sakJKBl7uXSmlEPFZZryoA,0,0,1,fFJ0CB3CPTsQ6F_RX4SB_Q

a friend and I decided to do lunch on a Friday afternoon and we went into this location at 12 o'clock exactly and it looked like it was really busy from the outside but we got seated right away

the server and hostess were very polite got us our drinks right away and then our waitress came she was super  friendly and helpful by showing us all the specials 

we decided on a appetizers fairly quickly because I had to be to work right after lunch. as soon as we got the chance and knew what we wanted we both ordered Alfredo mine was seafood and my friends was grilled chicken

we ordered the risotto bites for an appetizer they were a cheesy risotto ball and it was dipped in batter and deep fried with a homemade crushed tomatoe sauce and shredded cheese on top  one of our favorite things about Olive Garden is the endless soup salad and breadsticks and let me tell you what she kept it coming she kept offering us the freshly shredded cheese which is absolutely delicious and when I'm ready she brought us the amazing Alfredo even throughout the meal she refilled are breadsticks   we both had the spicy potato and sausage soup which is amazing as always very creamy very hearty  and it even has kale in it  my friends chicken alfredo was amazing a chicken with freshly grilled it was not dry it was very moist and juicy and handles were home made my seafood Alfredo the sea food was cooked perfectly it was nice and tender the alfredo sauce very creamy and buttery and rich and it was just full of flavors I could soak up with the breadsticks

she boxed up my leftovers and our leftover bread sticks and even gave us cups to go for drinks when we had it out so like I said the service was amazing the food was amazing the locations great 

the big issue that I have is when our bill came I paid with my credit card. our bill was under $40 and I gave her a7 dollar tip (in cash) well later on I noticed that not only do we have our lunch tab on my bank account I also had a almost $50 charge from Olive Garden that was subtracted from my account so I was missing 90 dollars out of my account for a 30 and some change meal! 

so I gave it 24 hours it was not back in my account so as soon as I got off work I called it down to the location from the number provided to me on my receipt when I call the manager on duty was Jake up Jacob did take a good look into the situation explain to me everything that happened and when I questioned why my card was ran twice he continued to dig deeper into the situation 

I was not letting him play it off as a server error because she was amazing then  I made him dig until he came to realize that my card was swiped for my table and somebody else's table! when I notified him that the extra charge on my account cause me to go over draft he then started to become apologetic.  

I have been in the restaurant industry and management for the restaurant industry for the past 5 years and this is something manager to manager that Jacob needs to learn apologizing to your blue in the face does nothing for customers you need to compensate them for the inconvenience that you caused them and expecially in this situation with the extreme inconvenience  

I didn't get offered a coupon for next time or a lunch on Olive Garden all I got was a we reverse the charge right away it should hit your account on Monday hopefully your bank will return the overdraft fee and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry  it's like he did not even care if I was going to ever return to his location or not  

I really do love Olive Garden and I love the convenience of the location its right next to my job it's really close to my home and it sucks that I don't want to go back because of the way I was treated because of an Issue they inconvenience me with. might go back to another location but I will probably never go back to this one",gugUpNPEyl54jCNc3kBlWQ,3,0,1,JwbpGcweppE2g-J-5AEsng

928127,2012-02-11,0,viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw,"The last time I had eaten at the Olive Garden was in January of 2011 at this same location.  I took a friend of mine from out of town as she had never eaten there as I was raving about their bottomless salads.  We both ordered a shrimp and pasta dish.  When they brought the food out and placed it in front of us, I could tell immediately that something was wrong.  The shrimp looked like it had been cooked some while before and then just mixed in with the pasta and sauce to cover.  Before I even took a taste, I knew that shrimp was going to taste rubbery!  And boy did it.  To top it off, I found nose hairs as I got 1/4 of a way through it on one of the noodles.  I signaled to the waitress who came over and looked at it also. She didn't even argue with me; those were definitely some dirty cooks nose hairs.  So she asked me if I wanted something else to which I replied, ""No, I've lost my appetite.""  
Next, the manager came over to apologize which I thought was a nice gesture.  

Thinking it was just a fluke, I took a client this time over to this same Olive Garden last week which was almost a year to the date later.  I ordered the salad and an appetizer.  She ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread.  I couldn't believe it when she showed me what she had found mixed in with her spaghetti; yes, she was holding up a long string of spaghetti with a long brown head hair hanging from the fork.  That did it; I felt like throwing up on the spot triggering at that moment my memory of those nose hairs last year on MY pasta. 

I don't know what is going on in those kitchens over there, but that is it for me!  I'm done with this place!  This just tells me that there is no oversight as to what is going on in those kitchens over there. Yuk!

1232006,2014-07-11,0,viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw,"For way too many years, readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal named the Olive Garden as Best Italian Restaurant. Although it lost its title this year (to Terra Rosa), this place remains the go-to Italian joint for many families -- not just here, but across the nation. And that's too bad. Not that the Olive Garden is a horrible restaurant; it just puts out pedestrian food that's a little more expensive than it needs to be.

Every Christmas, my family and I swap restaurant gift cards. And that's how I end up at the Olive Garden every year. While I usually go to lunch (yes, I do love their soup, salad, and breadsticks combo), this time we splurged on dinner because we had $75 to spend. 

We each had a glass of pretty good wine (Cavit pinot noir for my husband, Evolution white blend for me), although they were a little warm (a common problem at chain restaurants), and we had the aforementioned salad and breadsticks, which were tasty as ever. For our entrees, my husband had the Mediterranean trout, and I had the portobello ravioli. Although I liked my ravioli, there was barely enough sauce to cover the pasta. Why so skimpy? And although the trout was seasoned well (but predictably overcooked), it was served with a tomato and broccoli pappardelle that didn't match the rest of the dish. Not a big fan of fish and tomatoes to start with, but the addition of the broccoli was just weird.

Service was kind of slow, and the food was just so-so. But I finished my meal on a high note, with a tasty Italian margarita. (Love that side shot of amaretto!) And I know I'll be back next year, gift card in hand. Next time, I think I'll stick with lunch.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,3,YzIBJKPEH2yj8FKEKd4Szg

I always order the all-you-can-eat soup/salad/breadsticks. The salad is really good, but get the dressing on the side and mix it yourself. Otherwise, there is far too much dressing. The minestrone soup is great, but it is the only vegetarian soup option. Of course, go to OG because of their divine breadsticks! If you can afford the calories, splurge for a side of Alfredo for dipping your breadsticks.

1559824,2010-12-14,0,viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw,"I can not remember the last time that I have been to an Olive Garden ~ probably 2004 or so ~ definitely before I was married..  

Driving home from the grocery store, we decided to swing on in and have dinner at the old Olive Garden.  

Parking was packed.  And, we were about 8 couples behind on the wait list.  After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were finally seated.  I love the way the O-Garden is laid out - very spacious, wall colors are calm, and lighting is perfect.

Our waiter - despite being really busy, spent the necessary time with us.  Took our drink, appetizers, and meal orders promptly.

Once he brought us our drinks, he also brought our yummy garlic bread sticks and chilled salad.  Now, I love the Bread Sticks here.  They seemed to be soaked in Garlic (yum yum yum) and are warm.  By the way, because of the ""heavy"" garlic, you might experience some uncomfortable gas feeling at night... lol... pop in some GAS X before you head to bed.  Your partner would appreciate it... hee hee.  back to dinner... I must say the O-Garden have the bread delivery right.  I hate restaurants where the bread are HARD and difficult to bite into... Soft warm bread is the way to go.  As for the salad, it was perfect.  Dressing was light and ideal.

We ordered the Mussels as an appetizers.  Since we were hungry, the mussels were consumed within minutes.  Very good.  By the way, we took our Breadsticks and dipped it in the mussel butter sauce.   All I can say is ""Ummm Ummmm Ummm!!""  Honestly, if we had to do it over again, we probably cut back on the bread... we kinda finished two basket full before our meal.  So, we were about 70% full before our entrees were even served.  Note to self, save some bread to take home (by the way, our waiter still got us some extra bread for our drive home too!  yeh yeh yeh!)

For our entrees, my wife ordered the Seafood Mari (can't remember the exact name) and I ordered the Chianti Braise Ribs.  Both dishes were truly good.  Her Mari was perfectly seasoned and had the right mixture of seafood.  And, the red orange sauce was not too tangy and did not overpower the dish.

As for my meal, my ribs were very tender.  I could cut it with a spoon.  My pet peeve with the meat was that the Chianti was a bit too strong and sweet.  They should have used a less potent Ruby Port wine or Chianti.  I did not really like the ""wet"" brown rice that they served with string beans on top.  It looked kinda dirty and unorganized.  It looked like it was ""slopped"" on.  I would prefer instead a clean pasta center piece with a mixture of color veggies (bell peppers, string beans, potatoes, etc..).  Needless to say, I did not care too much for the rice.

For two, drinks, with one appetizer, two entrees, salad, and ""complimentary"" break sticks, the bill comes to about $55 bucks.  Not bad.  Add in the 20% tip, and it runs up to $65 or so for two people.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.  It is a nice change-up from all the Asian restaurants that my wife always want to go to.

Cheers and enjoy.",qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,1,0,4,DJtqFKaXvnfZMNUC3CYP-g

1865253,2014-08-17,4,viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw,"I'll be the first to give credit where credit is due: Olive Garden's recent rebranding efforts, with the new logo and font, and some more modern menu options, are welcome and give a nice facelift to the company.

However, it may be too much change or not very well executed: menu now boasts a selection of ""italian tapas"" which are basically an extension of their appetizer menu, most of which are $5 or $6 and discounted to $4 during a happy hour special of sorts, offered Mon-Fri 3-6PM.
Tried the polenta and shrimp dish- four shrimp atop a bed of polenta with a tomato and olive sauce, good value with four shrimp, but sauce was overly salty and unbalanced with many olives. Server apologetically revealed that the dish isn't going over well.

Though they're most known for their pasta dishes (and, okay, breadsticks), I usually just come here for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special: $7 for as much of either as I like, along with breadsticks. Good value, and good flavors- I usually stick with the zuppa toscana, but the chicken and gnocchi is good for something different. 

In addition to the tapas portion, OG now has a small menu of featured dishes that are ""healthy preparation""/lower-calorie than their typical pasta dishes. A few steps in the right direction, guys- now to work on the execution.

Additional note: never get a cappuccino here. It's not worth the $4. Drive through a Starbucks afterward if you must. You'll thank me later.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,3,3,of8MkOlmh8ii8sNwVtDX-g

And that might seem like an odd statement seeing as how I live in Hawaii where have no Olive Gardens at all. So if I just stated that we can't survive without one, why am I still alive?

Well, I live off of hope. Hope that one day I'll get to eat at Olive Garden again. Hope that I'll indulge myself in the breadsticks, salad and soup.

Thankfully in my most recent trip to Las Vegas, I was able to take my gf to Olive Garden. We were seated after a short wait and it was game time baby! Before we knew it we had breadsticks and salad on the table. I ordered up some of the chicken and gnocchi soup. The breadsticks were perfect as they always are. And the soup? The soup was awesome. Nice pieces of roasted chicken with small dumplings full of flavor. I added some pepper and it went very nicely with the spinach. It was all very satisfying.

For my entree I had the parmesan crusted steak. It came with mashed potatoes and it tasted like a small piece of heaven. She had shrimp over linguini and that too was also full of flavor.

There were a few hiccups on the service side. I was supposed to get unlimited refills on my strawberry tea but instead she filled it with regular tea. Our server also said that she'd bring us more bread but she didn't. By that time we were full anyways so it didn't really matter.

The good thing is they were running their 2 entrees and 2 apps for $25 deal. For apps we got the fried mozzarella and fried calamari. My parents got a dipping sauce and toasted ravioli. The mozzarella was a little too thick and the calamari was a tad under done. My parents' apps were decent.

For entrees I got the spaghetti and meatballs and my wife got the eggplant Parmesan. As soon as they set down my plate, I could tell my spaghetti was over cooked.

Atmosphere: Lively!
It's your typical sit-down restaurant setting: people waiting, servers and baristas moving about getting their orders out as quickly as possible. Nothing out the ordinary that makes this Olive Garden stick out from your usual dine-in chain. With subtle music in the background, it's actually quite nice.

Service: I appreciate them! (Except for waiting so long)
Initially, we were told that our waiting time was 25+ minutes, but upon further inquiry, our waiting time was decreased to just 15 minutes.

Our waitress was absolutely amazing, polite, and very appreciate of our presence. What I liked about my server the most was they she said, ""I appreciate you,"" That sounded really great to my ears, honestly. Having just this waitress interact with us made my visit!

Food: Quite nice, but nothing spectacular
This visit, I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side of fries and marinara sauce. The chicken Parmesan is served in a larger-sized breadstick bun, which was not horrible at all. Tasted like your typical chicken parm, minus the pasta, of course.

In addition to the sandwich, I had the side salad and their berry sangria. The salad was served with Italian vinaigrette, which gave it good acidity and flavor. It tasted even better with our request of having no olives. The sangria was sweet, flavorful, and went well with the meal overall; didn't taste too alcoholic, either!

Overall: Good visit!
I really liked coming here and enjoying a meal with my friends. What killed it the most was being told to wait for 25 minutes. Good thing our waiting time was reduced!

The food was cold   inside and the pasta on both mine and my sisters food was like hard on the edges?. Not to mention the waitress with the wrist tattoo (I think it was like a feather or something) was super weird and rude. During the entire check out process she was soliciting for tips... I think it was because we looked young and she thought we werent going to tip her or something.  as a waitress myself I would never leave without tipping but it was really rude and unacceptable that she pretty much asked for one even after she knew our order was messed up and she had been all wierd towards us on top of that.,KJoyrgdec8um2PchQPSFxg,0,0,1,4hKvbaXYqVaCr9FFbSMY4g

I could eat better frozen food. The fried raviolis and cheese sticks were hard and cold in the middle.  Maybe it was just this one night but the food was cold and all tasted bad.

I'm still not sure how it's surviving with all the mediocre food that they make. i'm a big pasta person so I have a pretty big standard on anything about it. So, upon arriving here, I was SUPER excited about their endless pasta deal. I immediate look advantage of it because... Why not? 

I ordered a combination of angel hair pasta topped Alfredo sauce. Me and my wife were definitely not happy about this as the pasta was served to us dry. I don't think you can go wrong with cooking angel hair with sauce. I just didn't think that was possible. Instead, it was under sauced. We would've wanted to bring it back to the kitchen, but we were waiting there for a while already so we weren't excited about doing that at all. 

The meatball that we ordered with it was fairly delicious, but there was nothing spectacular about it. It almost reminded me of the meatballs you can get at the supermarket, but they're larger in size. 

Th ambiance of this restaurant was lovely. I really like the look and feel of this place as it felt romantic and a bit homely at the same time. The waiter that helped us was very accommodating as well. These are the reasons why I'm keeping them at two stars instead of a one.

My second favorite is the Zuppa Tuscana, which has potatoes, sausage, and kale in a creamy sauce.  The bread sticks are warm, buttered, and soft in the middle.  The best part of this meal is dipping the bread sticks in the Chicken & Gnocchi.  For my waistline, I wish they would put a limit on how many bread sticks they let each person eat.  ha ha ha.

First off, their drink selection is amazing. There are many to choose from. The Bellini peach-raspberry ice tea is my favorite from the list of non-alcoholic drinks they serve. They also serve beer, special cocktails and a selection of wines. My favorite alcoholic drink would be the moscato for white wine & lambrusco for the red wine. There has never been a time when I wouldn't enjoy my trip to Olive Garden without having at least 2 of my favorite drinks!

The food. My favorite part. If I were to order off the menu and not order a special, I would go with the shrimp & scallop fettuccini alfredo. I love seafood in my pasta. Olive Garden was actually the first place I have ever tried scallops in my life and I enjoy the taste of it. The other thing I like to order is the Soup Salad & Breadsticks with unlimited refills for only $7.95 for lunch! Nothing can top that! Plus their breadsticks are the best in the whole world!!!

They have an amazing special going on right now. The never ending pasta bowl is an amazing deal, yet I dont think I could eat so much pasta in one sitting. I recommend someone with a big appetite to order that. 

Overall, it is a great place to enjoy a meal that will satisfy your taste buds with your favorite company.",UXJ0BITxblNqTNBRkHGABg,2,1,4,PF03GKtEAX963KXTDi-q6g

We come here every few weeks and almost every single time with a myriad of servers have had very fast and attentive servers who have great personalities and are very bubbly. We appreciate the attentiveness to extra breadsticks or drinks when low, and even if they are slammed the server will let you know the food is coming soon so that you are never left waiting and wondering. 

We usually get the pasta fagioli soup and it is cooked just right with good seasoning. Are entrees are usually a various choice of classic pastas, no chicken or seafood and we have had good luck with these. You can often catch them during a promotion with buy one take one or in the fall during the never ending pasta bowl for a decent price. 

Overall I would highly recommend this location over any other in the city. You can get in and out with 2-4 person table in 30 to 40 minutes if you want a quick dinner.

It started off good. My gf and I were greeted at the door and led to a table. They just opened for lunch so we were maybe the third party in. Our server offered some wine to try but declined, just ordered a coke for me and an ice tea for my gf. 

Drinks came out then we put in our order, my gf had the soup and salad (endless) and I had the steak and chicken skewers and soup. Shrimp for appetizer.

Appetizer came out pretty quick. After that her salad and my soup were next. Then it went downhill. I know our server was busy with a party of nine that came in after us, but it was like we were forgotten. 

My bowl was taken away but no refill for my gf's ice tea.  We waited like 30 minutes then our server came by and apologized saying they overcooked my steak and that the manager would come out and talk to us and possibly take our appetizer off the bill. Maybe five minutes later the manager came out and apologized and did remove the appetizer from our bill which was nice. Supposedly they screwed up my order but all the while my gf never got her soup!?! A total wait time of about 40 minutes then my order came out with my gf's warm (not hot) bowl of soup. She didn't want to complain just wanted to eat and get out of there. Don't blame her. She did finally get a ice tea refill! Yay! My food was okay kinda lost my appetite by then. She was never asked if she wanted to try any other soups. (endless my ass).

The manager did take care of the long wait for our food but there were more problems than that. Like I said we've been here before for dinner and left completely satisfied. Maybe this was just a fluke but I can only give them 2 stars.",bULBMkGqXU2xjFuPL-3JgQ,0,0,2,Y-KKCjB1h4_4WwHoHi6jTQ

The commercials I have seen for Olive Garden has made me remember those three phrases about Olive Garden.

From my personal experience, the service has always been amazing. They were always welcoming and promptly coming to refill the soup, salad, breadstick, if we wanted dessert, and how things were.
Every time I go to Olive Garden, I try to get something new to share. I love when they have their specials. Can't beat having 12.95 three course meals or 2 for $25. Be sure to take advantage of their current specials! It will save you money, and you will have enough food for another meal. The special I'm definitely looking forward to again is the ""All you can eat pasta!""  

I never leave Olive Garden without a to-go box. By the time I'm done with the soup or salad and bread stick that comes with my main course order, I'm already full. 

If you want something 'lighter' compared to pasta. They do have the soup,salad, bread stick alternative which can be very filling.
What I've learned is, don't be afraid to ask to try another type of soup they have. I tend to feel weird even though its endless soup to ask for more. But as long as it doesn't go to waste and into your tummy, be sure to try the soups!

Their food is always delicious and I've never had any problems with their food.
If you are not full by dessert time, be sure to try their tiramisu. it is one dessert I'm always looking forward to having at Olive Garden.

I decided one more chance wouldn't hurt but I would go to a different location. 

At the Decatur location, Rodolfo gave my husband & I the best service I've ever had at any restaurant. He had so much amazing, positive energy! He was thoughtful & offered his opinion on drink & food selections when my husband asked his preferences. Refills of bread & drinks were always quick. He was prompt & friendly every time he came to our table. 

What I truly loved was that although we did come close to their closing time, he never made us feel rushed or unwanted. Rodolfo told us how blessed he is to have a job & how much he genuinely loves working with people. Typically in the service industry you encounter people working solely for the paycheck & you can tell in their energy that they do not want to be at work. We told Rodolfo how amazing we thought his personality & his level of service was & his response was that it's just who he is. He told us where he's from there are people without jobs & opportunities, so in his life he has truly loved any job he's had the opportunity of having from service jobs to simply washing dishes. He brings up a good point that life is too short to be negative & how even at work you must always be positive because you have the power to positively change someone's day.

However, that has never been with Olive Garden! I don't visit much, but when I do, I always try something new and never have a frown on my face. It's so hard selecting only one meal on the menu since I always see many I like and haven't tried. 

They had this new drink, Strawberry-Mango Limonata, and it had real strawberries floating in it. It tasted soo good. I was eager to order another one! The beverage was only 3.50, and you got a lot of it. 

After goggling at the menu for what seemed like forever, I chose the Lasagna Rollata al Forno. I ate some salad and ate all my breadsticks while waiting. I had to request more with my meal seeing that they always have the best breadsticks and you can't get enough!

When the plate came out, my first thought was ""That's it?"" It looked so small and not filling at all. Once I started eating though, that thought changed. It filled you up just right and the food was astonishing.

5636437,2017-12-26,0,viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw,"Olive Garden is becoming a large disappointment. And here I am, writing another review of a chain restaurant that's part of a corporation that's part of a conglomerate. No review I write will change their recipes, or make them revamp their menus.

I know that Olive Garden isn't really an ""Italian"" restaurant, any more than Panda Express is a ""Chinese"" restaurant. But I expect a bit more, in taste, not proportions, from a restaurant that charges $20 for a simple chicken item. Olive Garden has become the McDonald's of Italian restaurants.

I ordered delivery (sorry Yelp, I used a competitor, but Olive Garden isn't on your list of restaurants) from this particular restaurant. I had the salmon piccata, and my husband had the chicken piccata. We also ordered a couple of those dessert mousses in a cup; lemon and amaretto tiramisu.

I'm used to getting a nice lemony sauce with a bit of wine with a piccata, whether it be chicken, salmon, or veal. Both of the entrees were virtually devoid of any sauce, and loaded with capers that had all the taste and salt rinsed out of them. The salmon was oh so dry and over cooked. And those little dessert cups are so sweet that they will induce diabetes in perfectly healthy people. And sweet was ALL they were. Flavor index of about 2.

We ordered salad as well. It came with bagged croutons (bagged!) and prepackaged dressing. I could get the same thing at my grocery store! And for less money. Olive Garden used to be famous for its salad dressing, but it's turned into a mass manufactured and vacuum sealed product that's WAAAAAY too vinegary. The greens were fresh and crisp, though. 

I'm afraid that the only good thing I can say about this dinner is that Olive Garden's breadsticks are still delicious. But you can find a recipe for them on the web, if you're inclined to bake. I did add a star for the breadsticks and the fresh greens in the salad.

I know, I know. It's a nice place to go for a casual meal, but you'd do better if you ordered delivery from a local, non-chain mom-and-pop Italian place. They care about the taste and quality of their food a lot more.

I won't be ordering from or visiting Olive Garden any time soon. Like I previously said, they've become the McDonald's of Italian restaurants. I get a craving for a Big Mac about every six months. I'm afraid Olive Garden has been downloaded into the same category.

This review is more of a review of Olive Garden restaurants everywhere, not this particular franchise, but I hope they'll read this!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,1,0,2,a5GA_SPYUZd8ES5A-fAwsg

We each ordered the spicy shrimp vesuvio as our main course which was jam packed with flavor. The shrimp in this pasta dish was very generous as well which was a nice treat. Our meal also included unlimited bread sticks and choice of soup or salad.

Also included is your choice of a shared appetizer or dessert so we opted for a slice of triple chocolate mouse cake which was super moist!

My hubby had peach iced tea which was super tasty and refreshing, I opted for plain iced tea.

This meal was great and a lot of goodness for $25!

Our meal was generous and good and I also like the sample of wine they offer when seated.

This is decent and tasty ""Americanized"" Italian food so this review will only warrant a 3 star rating. I am a huge fan of authentic traditional cuisine and am aware that Olive Garden is a commercial concept lacking that flare.

When it arrived it had two skinny pieces of over cooked chicken breast covered with some type of commissary red sauce with pieces of hard to identify over the hill green leaves that I believe was basil...tasted awful...my wife ate one piece of chicken and offered the rest to me....I tasted the saucy...and chose to decline eating her offering (sadly I was so put off by this place I forgot to photograph the ""chicken whatever"" dish.....even worse they only serve breadsticks...and I asked they not be coated with any butter sauce...it arrived and the breadsticks were tasteless....bread should taste good PLAIN! ..... what did I order?  
.......I ordered the dish that should tell how good an Italian kitchen it is.....Spaghetti with Meat Sauce....it arrived in a bowl unadorned with any garnish....probably a sign to other diners around me that I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu....I wouldn't call it meat sauce I would call it a bunch of ground up red stuff with tiny, tiny specks of gray colored stuff that represented the meat part of the dish......it had the taste of lots of ground up garlic mixed with perhaps Italian flavor enhancers...it was a bitter tasting garlic sauce with no redeeming value....what was source was the lukewarm spaghetti.....""A good Italian Restaurant cooks their sauce in a sauté pan then adds the spaghetti to finish its cooking with the sauce--enhancing its overall flavor....the spaghetti arrived absolutely white with a big dollop of their meat sauce on top...Yuck....the whole meal cost $33 + my 15% tip....I would have eaten better at In-N-Out for $12.00....",mYuaXH4LULtDUJQyEn4YDw,1,1,1,HmQR70Uwo9gV1HnF_B0_6w

(thanks to all the commericals) Well my first impression when I walked in was that the restaurant was alil dingy. The feeling and atmosphere wasnt what I expected. I thought it would have more of an upbeat feel to it, like Outback Steak House, Ruby Tuesday's, Apple Bees etc. but once I got pass the quiet, old atmosphere and ate the food, it was so worth it. I had the Capelini Pomodoro which was good, it was $11.75 which included soup or salad. I took the soup and it was great. My mom had the Venetian Apricot Chicken and she said it was excellent and my sister had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala which she loved. I also had a non alcoholic drink Pomegranate Limetta which was superb. The food taste, quality and price will have me going back whenever I'm in Vegas. I gave it a 4 star not a 5 only because our server NATALIA had alil attitude problem. My sister told me the last time they were there, they also had her and had issues. So aside from our server who needs to check her attiude, be more attentive, and learn her menu and act as if she likes her job, I LOVED OLIVE GARDEN!!

P.S. oh the bread sticks were great too! =)",woAQrIYXALiotKay013WlA,3,2,4,WbLACTmCNqipajo1tkWgdQ

Food wise, my boyfriend loved the unlimited bread. Loved my salad. Loved the freshly cooked stuffed mushrooms .  The pasta awesome.",EFCBtWbGXYJvllprF5gTKw,2,0,5,pmtscKzWfKmE7MUcZ5vi5Q
