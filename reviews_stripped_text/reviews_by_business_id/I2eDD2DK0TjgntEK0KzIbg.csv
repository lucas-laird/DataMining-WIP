Spring rolls, we could of eaten just those for dinner. They come with lettuce, cumcumber, carror, cilantro and dipping sauce, put all of them together is amazing.

Pho broth was great, we added garlic chili sauce and boy did it hear up by the end. Everything was very fresh.

I had the house Pho and we shared an order of summer shrimp rolls and an or of summer pork rolls.

Right off from the start the taste of the food was fantastic.  We stopped going to our other Viet place because of quality and taste issues.

The spring rolls are made to order, they don't make them ahead of time. Good amount of shrimp and pork delivered with a peanut topped sauce.  Tasty!

My Pho was absolutely delicious even without adding additional seasoning.  It was loaded with tripe, beef ball, tendon.
Served with very fresh limes, Thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapeño.

The wife's house salad was grilled very large shrimp, fried pork stuffed spring roll, veggies, grilled chicken and pork with a viet vinaigrette sauce.

Everything was delicious, staff was attentive and nice.  The chef even came out and brought a small bowl of pho broth for the wife to taste.  Very nice guy.  This is our go to Viet food place now.",6ZaL6fBlKx5tb8c9opl7rQ,1,0,5,qrG98RYPzWDLMZ0gewea_A

He uses a really good cut of pork (and other meats but the pork is my personal favorite) and all the vegetables and other ingredients are extremely fresh. While I do love Pho I am also partial to the salad w/ vermicelli rice noodles, and while I'm at it, do yourself a favor and try the Vietnamese Lomein (it is nothing like greasy Chinese Lomein).

1637138,2016-02-16,0,I2eDD2DK0TjgntEK0KzIbg,"The best of very best! 

During my recent four day visit to Las Vegas, I got to visit here four times! Two lunches and two dinners. 

A little background... before the owner Ricky and his family moved to Vegas to opened this restaurant last year, he owned a #1 rated Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte, NC. I frequented there at least once a week for 5 1/2 years. I almost always ordered the same thing- pho with chicken, veggies, egg noodles and beef broth- oh it was the best! I sipped up to the last dips of soup in the bowl every time! Yes, it's that good! In Charlotte, Ricky was brand new against a couple of same street incumbent competitions but overtook both of them and dozens of others across town. He built business exclusively based on word of mouth, never advertised, never Groupons! 

I've been dying to come see Ricky and his lovely family and eat at his new Vegas restaurant for a long time. First impressions- the food is even better in Vegas than the Charlotte's and the prices are lower! How is that possible? I was amazed with the chicken broth based soup which was so flavorful and tasty yet without MSG. FYI there is no MSG in any food served here. Ricky is a perfectionist who personally picks day's ingredients himself every morning before opening the store. To make the broth, he follows his secret recipe cooking all the items over about 6 hours to make the day's batch. His soups are always freshly made. I got to try pho with both beef broth which is his trademark classic and newly introduced chicken. Both are amazing! The grilled dishes with meats, broken rice and fresh veggies never disappoint me. I recommend getting a sandwich to go for night snack or lunch which I did on two visits. I love the perfect blend of meat (I had pork on one and chicken on another), veggies and jalapeño on the sandwich. So happy to learn that Ricky's #1 rated (Charlotte) Vietnamese food is very much alive in Sin City. 

Another thing to note is the super cleanness of this place which is rather unusual especially compared to the Vietnamese restaurant peers. Personality wise, Ricky and his wife Kim are super friendly. The servers are equally friendly.

2016962,2015-12-02,8,I2eDD2DK0TjgntEK0KzIbg,"Another solid pho option away from Chinatown chaos- though not that far from Spring Mountain Rd, honestly. Menu is simple but good, with fried and fresh rolls as apps, a few pho options, a few broken rice and bun bowls, and even separate sections for healthy and vegetarian selections.

HOUSE COMBINATION PHO: Broth was okay, didn't have quite as much depth as other versions in town. Their house chili-garlic oil added some good flavor, and the mix of bean sprouts-jalapenos-lime-basil also included a surprising amount of cilantro, for a slightly different mix of flavors. Meatballs were my favorite of the included meats, there wasn't too much fat. Only one size, but it's shareable and under $10.
HOUSE COMBINATION BROKEN RICE: Rice plus pork chop, shrimp, chicken, and fried spring roll with fresh veggies and the vinaigrette sauce. Comfort food to the max, meats were fresh but seemed a bit overcooked as they were all a bit on the dry side. I like char on my meats, but these tasted like maybe they need to clean the grill a little more frequently. 

I felt our lunch was affordable, with a large portion for the price: the above dishes were slightly over $25 with tax and tip. Service was attentive about drink refills, location is clean.

But hey, forget that, the food... The food is spot on. They really nail the flavor profile of Viet dishes and have a small menu but enough variety to switch it up if you visit often. For around $10 per item they are well priced and the staff is great.

2639447,2016-01-13,19,I2eDD2DK0TjgntEK0KzIbg,"I visit this place every month and each time has been consistent with great portions, taste, and service. Location can be tricky. If you're going north on Durango, it's after Desert Inn Rd, once you pass O'Reilly Auto Parts store, turn right, and you'll drive straight to this place. 

Family owned and operated. The owners go above and beyond. Asking if I would like some extra veggies or more lettuce for my spring roll to wrap. They come around and ask how's everything. Service is wonderful and attentive to the guests needs. One night... I finished a running class at REI and called for their special Kimchi Soup at 8:50p.m. for my parents. Pushing my luck, the kind lady, Kim? said okay, I'll make it for you. Come in 10mins. Mind you, they close at 9p.m! She was so accommodating and didn't even trip at my last minute request. When I came in to pick it up, she was all smiles, sweet as a peach, and oh so welcoming. Made me smile! :D

Another occasion, I took my family here and we had the Fried Pork Spring Rolls, which came out piping out. You roll up the spring roll with lettuce, cilantro, pickled carrots, and daikon then dip it in the fish sauce. I add hoisin and sriracha in the sauce to give it some zest! I munch on the sliced cucumber on its own, since the roll gets..well.. Big. I can only stuff so much in my mouth! Love the chewy texture of the fried spring roll. Reminds me of fried mochi :P Delicious and I order this appetizer every time I'm here. 

Another hit is their Pork Chop Broken Rice. Love love love this particular dish to pieces. So does my Father. He said the broken rice was special and he couldn't stop eating it. I agreed! Two hunky chunks of tender chops that are full of flavor, some fresh veggies, and that broken rice, which was not forgotten at all. This whole dish is soul driven to perfection. I can't rave enough about this dish! It will keep you coming back!!!

And lastly, my parents love their special.. Kimchi Soup. The kimchi broth is cleeean and it has this spice factor that melts your foodie heart. The level of spiciness is just right and something you can definitely appreciate in having this soup. My Father can't eat anything overly spicy and this just hit the spot for him. Simple, yet quite enjoyable soup.

I asked Kim? the kind lady with glasses about how they started their business. They had a successful family restaurant in Philadelphia for over six years, then moved their business to Charlotte, NC and then here to Vegas. 

This place is one of my favorites. If anyone is concern with MSG in their soup base or dishes, rest assured ;) MSG don't live here and that's amazing for the flavors each item brings out. 

If you're starving like Marvin, this place won't keep you guessing. Food comes out in lightning speed and steaming hot. Great for quick lunch, to go orders, and simple dinner nights. 

I admit I was reluctant to write a review, since I love how mellow this place is. But... can't keep it a secret for too long. So come here for some delicious, authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Freshness at its best!",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,33,26,5,9nlJdII0TXufhnvKSFxDXg

As for the food, I had the Pho Ga(Chicken Pho). It was good. Good enough where I would come back for it. I liked that the side of greens/herbs that it came with was a good serving size and very fresh. I think if they are that particular in the quality of something as simple as a side of herbs, it says a lot for the quaintly of their food. The best part for me was that I did not get that feeling of lethargy after eating here, as I do with nearly all other Vietnamese restaurants due to the MSG in their food. Now I do not know if they claim to use MSG or not, but I'm pretty sure they don't based on my personal experience. I also had their egg rolls which I didn't care much for. They wrap it in rice paper which was fine, but there was a thick layer of the wrapper within the egg roll that was chewy. The chewiness I didn't care for. I like crispy egg rolls, not chewy ones.

The fried pork spring rolls are not too greasy and fried to a nice chewy golden brown. The summer rolls come in shrimp, chicken, pork and tofu. I've tried them all. All super fresh and perfect bite size. I love the salad noodle bowls. I've had the chicken and the shrimp. The chicken was fresh and juicy. The shrimp one is my favorite dishes. The shrimp are grilled perfectly and covered in a delicious marinade. Lots of rice noodles, fresh cucumber, carrots, lettuce. And everything is proportionately sized and easy to eat. Don't get me wrong... I love how when I get to go meals from some Vietnamese restaurants like Pho So 1, they give me a shopping bag full of veggies and I have free salad for the week. But honestly, sometimes it's just too much and hard to eat on the go. I've also had the combination meat w/steamed veggies (filling but not heavy) and the chicken lomein (not greasy like Chinese lomein).

This one can be a tough find, as it's tucked away in a small, mostly empty strip mall behind Arby's off of Durango. You'll be hard pressed to find friendlier service than at this family-run spot. Fried pork spring rolls ($5) were good, particularly the ones that were extra crispy and they're a bargain with five large rolls per order.

The way they name dishes can be odd for anyone familiar with Vietnamese fare. Bún is called ""salad noodle bowls"". I guess they anticipated a customer base new to the cuisine. Regardless, the grilled pork bún ($9.95) was excellent, although light on pork and heavy on noodles. A better deal is the House salad noodle bowl ($11.95) full of shrimp, chicken, pork, and fried spring rolls that won't leave you hungry.

I'm not the biggest fan of pho, but will order it from time to time. The beef rice noodle soup ($8.25), ordered to-go, was neatly packaged into three separate containers to keep each set of ingredients as fresh as possible. The broth -- thin and slightly under seasoned -- was a good compliment to the chilly weather.

These Pork Chops have some of the best flavor I've tasted in any pork chop, marinated through with a soy base and covered in green onion. Then the broken rice, oh man. It's the size and consistency of a large grain couscous but has the bite and flavor profile of a jasmine or basmati. It's so good with the same dipping sauce for the spring rolls poured over, that it ""melts in your mouth"" and pairs perfectly with the pork chop or other proteins. Last but not least is the vermicelli rice noodle salad, we always order with the grilled pork. It's fresh, flavorful, satisfying, and you can mix in a ton of their hoisin/sriracha into the noodle before you put their signature sauce on top. They are also making the greatest bahn mi sandwiches for a limited time during lunch hours, so try one while they last!

This is an express joint meaning their menu is small and simple with the most common and popular dishes they specialize in. I walked in actually thinking this was a full-service restaurant because I was politely greeted by staff and handed a menu, this is actually a self serve restaurant meaning I order and pay at the counter they bring you the food. I don't need to worry about hailing down a waiter because everything I need is at the table and a free self serve ice/water machine.

Now down to the nitty gritty on the food when it came to table.  

Once the beef Pho was set down you instantly smell the broths strong aroma and when you sip the broth it was clean, full of flavor and refreshing.  The best part is it was prepared authentically with flank steak as if you were to eat in Vietnam, not like the cheap Americanized version with deli cut style round beef.

Then my wife's order of pork chop over broken rice came which looked and smell so good I had to try it. Now this is a real center cut fire grilled pork chop full of flavor, not like that over marinated mixed cut crap in other places.

4128156,2015-05-14,1,I2eDD2DK0TjgntEK0KzIbg,I'm a very picky eater when it comes down to the Pho broth. Alot of places don't have the recipe down right. Hands up to this new place that opened down the street from me though! Finally a local Pho shop that I can drive to without going to chinatown. Their pho broth is very tasty and the spices are just enough. The storefront is kind of covered by a building so you can't see it well while driving but this place is definitely good. Haven't tried other items but   the Pho. I'm sure it might be good as well. Definitely returning as my top Pho place when I'm craving Pho.,ILx47HIlsUCJ_lFYWu9wXw,2,1,5,3cFOK1XcDDYCke2_h3P_Zw

Despite the mouthful of a name, this place serves up, at least in both my opinion and in the opinion of my wife, THE best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas.
Bam! I wrote that. 
But it's true.
Listen to me, the pho here is aromatic, hot, rich, packed with layers upon layers of flavor. The solid selection of grilled meats is cooked to perfection by an old dad type, and this guy is for real. No BS. Take my advice and get the No. 15, the ""pork chop broken rice"" dish. 
I had it two days ago, and I can STILL savor the rich spices, the fullness, the spiciness and perfectly grilled flavor of the pork.
My wife and I have lived here for close to a decade. We've tried every last Vietnamese place in this valley. For a long time - in fact, up until we went here this past Saturday evening - we thought Jenni Pho was the best spot in town for Vietnamese cuisine. 
Nope. Not any more. This mom-and-pop grille hits all the high notes for what you look for in a family-style Vietnamese place (and be nice to these folks when you go; they are some of the chillest people you'll meet in Vegas, and their table service is just superb). 
Jenni Pho is now No. 2.
The Pho Vietnam Grille Express is the best Vietnamese joint in town right now, in late fall 2015. Believe me now, or pay me later.",eCErX2uz7AVmYuZu30CBvA,3,1,5,sV99sX6ZIYL1jMTQSB-Yiw

I always say that if you have to add a bunch of hoisin and siracha, then the broth is not good enough. I piled on both sauces. Broth is not as flavorful as it should be, but the meats do taste fresh. I will give it three stars though for the service and deliciously savory fried spring rolls with pork and pork skin. $5 for 5 with lettuce, cucumbers, pickled carrots and daikon. For a pho store to lack on pho though is a pretty big deal for me.

The wrapper is also different from most spring rolls, giving it a crunchy and chewy consistency, which is awesome. Their nuoc cham was perfect!

His pork chop rice is fantastic.  First off, the pork chop is perfectly butchered, seasoned, and cooked.  Super tender while also having a nice little crust on the edges.  Perfectly sauced with some secret recipe he's been using for years.  Rice is moist (so many rice plates in general serve really dry rice) and comes with a sauce to pour over it.  Perfect rice.  

Had some of the pho broth and flank steak.  The broth has FLAVOR.  Most pho places in town (maybe even all the rest) have bland broth.  I know some places are scared to go for it because some customers like the blandness when it comes to ""ethnic"" food but they go for it here.  Full of flavor.  The meat is nice and tender.  I think you only come with the option of flank steak but I was perfectly happy eating it. Didn't miss the brisket or round steak at all.

Also tried some of their pork spring rolls.  Good stuff.  My favorite part was the dipping sauce.  Normally you get a watery sauce.  Not here.  It's a thicker sauce that really adheres to the wrapping.  Good stuff.

Don't bother with the joints on Spring Mountain unless you need oxtail pho or banh mi.  This place has them all beat, hands down.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,2,0,5,LAqPpoFk434cSAIXmC2mUQ

Only a few customers and one of the tables seemed to be the couple's son or daughter and their family.  I really wanted this place to do well - I grew up with a dad in the small restaurant business who always struggled so I was rooting for this family.  Anyhow, we were seated immediately and asked for our drink order.  We just got water and hot tea (weak tea flavor) and we ordered two bowls of their special pho and the fried pork rolls.  When the pork rolls came out after about 3 minutes after we ordered, my wife and I looked at each other, both with disappointment on our faces.  We got 5 small rolls the size of mini corn dogs - they tasted frozen and were probably dropped into the fryer for 30 seconds and pulled out.  I'm thinking why not roll them fresh and larger and then fry them?  They would have tasted so much better.  Well thankfully the pho was better - the all important soup had good flavor and all the basil, cilantro and bean sprout accompaniments were fresh.  Big gripe was that the beef in the soup was thick and chunky rather than sliced thinly - the thicker the meat the longer it had to cook/sit in the soup.  Overall an okay meal - service was prompt and attentive and the couple was really nice.  Again, I really want them to do well but with so many competitors nearby and a little further in Chinatown, they really have to do something special to stand out.",JRio1onDKXirUN_MZMMBdA,0,0,3,5GiQnnzfkak4LFprh6E4Yw
