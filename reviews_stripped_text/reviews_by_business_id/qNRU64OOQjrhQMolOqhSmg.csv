I had the regular Spam musubi, the Kahuna Kalua (Kalua pork musubi) and a Samoan Sami (seasoned corned beef & coconut milk spinach over a nori roll). The dining area is small only a couple of tables so its better for take out. This is a great place for ""Grinds"".",T_RiQ-TOeZf8N2kiCNCiSg,1,1,5,VhnApjSSnpwLjutGAeKcSw

We see this place all the time as we dine next door at Swish.  We decided to grab an order to go to see what the fuss was all about.

Taking advantage of their $8.08 special, it included a spam musubi, mac salad, two choices of entree and rice.  From the pics, it looks like we got the Krispy Chicken Krunch (chicken rolled in a seasoned battered, fried and topped with a special glazed sauce) and the Samoan Sami (seasoned corned beef and spinach, baked in coconut milk).  We weren't exactly sure how the order was going to come out, and hoped that it would be easy to eat later on.  

When the order arrived to go, it was quite a few boxes and we realized this would not make it into the theater as we had hoped.  Bringing it home, some of the Samoan Sami had already come out of the box and was making a mess in the plastic bag.  The presentation of the food was alright.  I guess when you finally assemble it altogether, it looks a lot more appetizing.

When it came down to it, it was more of a bento box dinner with Hawaiian influences.  I guess we were confused with it being a musubi place and thought the chicken and beef would be incorporated into a musubi of some kind.

The spam musubi did taste good, and the Samoan Sami had a nice taste to it too. The chicken wasn't crunchy by the time we got home, so it was okay.

Overall, we just had different expectations from we actually got.
