303405,2011-09-25,14,-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw,"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, ""International Market? That looks interesting.""  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, ""$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!""

So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.

Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.

After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.

I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,18,10,5,D3vieRpv7g5o0WYQqa6VoQ

But, i've been wanting to learn more, getting a few cookbooks and familiar with things I want to try. A -total- novice; but with Rani's World Foods, i'm -well- on my way to being an expert!

Yes, this place is CLEAN, bright, inviting and OMG...When you walk into the front doors, the intoxicating smell of exotic spices and deliciousness just hit you like a brick wall! I was in love! The spice selection totally floored me, I mean...I'd only read about asfodita, and now I know where to buy it! 

I want to be a bit different than all the other glowing posts Rani's has here, all about the food. (which is wonderful) But, all about the really unique hair products! I never knew there was such a thing as jasmine hair oil, untill seeing the vast selection at Rani's. These oils are mainly coconut-based, with jasmine extract for gorgeous fragrance. Some will have other natural ingredients for added benefits. I picked out 2, one was specifically for color-treated hair like I possess. After using my blow-dryer to style my hair, I use a small amount of this in my palm, and glide it down the hair shaft. The results are FANTASTIC, with the best part is it's -not- greasy! I was expecting my hair to look limp and nasty as the day went on, but it stays soft and shiny all day. Plus, it's VERY inexpensive to boot. The small bottle? $2.50. The large bottle, for color-treated hair? $6.00. I'm sold on this stuff!",DwS5fvL_BR1-uUaafGTkOQ,4,2,5,fsqWDARDL4EjoBgMk9y06A

Chickpea flour. Yes it's not organic, but it's really good quality. Great for those gluten free fans. I personally just like it better and love the way it binds and coats. 

Turmeric. You can get it in a huge container here. In smoothies, scrambles, entrees, we each eat at least 1/4tsp a day. We use it everyday so it can add up quick. Did you know you can use is as a tooth whitener?!?! Nope I haven't tried it yet. 

Incense. I buy my incense here. Great quality and good selection. I don't burn it hardly ever, but I like to have a vase of it sitting around and smelling yummy.  

Music. I love the music and they play it kinda loud and I like that. Great energy.

Produce. Meh I'm not a fan! Most visits it doesn't look fresh to me. Maybe I'm just used to the obnoxious carefully plucked perfect overpriced organics at Whole Foods. I should give them another glance...

Tapioca starch, potato starch, and allllll the spices are here.

Snacks. The random crunchy snacks isle is always tempting but I love roasting my own chickpeas and crunchies so I try to stay away from that isle.

I decided I wouldn't mind going on a field trip and possibly discover some treats that were new to me. Neither one of us had lunch yet and were delighted to find that they had a little restaurant inside! Yay! A 2 in 1! 

Seeing that it was a new store to the both of us and how we LOVE to peruse international markets for hidden gems we combed the place. No aisle was overlooked. No shelf was neglected. We searched high and low for any and everything. He found the spices that he was looking for. The shelves were well stocked and the place was nice and clean. The place is obviously cared for in that respect. I did notice that things were higher priced here compared to what I have seen in other international markets around town. That was a bit of a disappointment. 

By the time we were all set to purchase there was no one at the cash register. We looked around and only saw other customers doing their shopping. We saw the bell by the register area and rang it once. The cashier came quickly and rang us up. She didn't greet. She didn't say anything actually. She just held out her hand for the money and practically threw the change at my friend. I thought it was quite rude. We tried to ignore it as we were plenty hungry by this time and wanted to get down to the grub!

We made our way to the ""restaurant"" area. There was already a few people in line. We got in behind them as we tried to decide what we would order. The food that finally came to them did not look appetizing. Everything looked like leftovers just slopped on picnic-ware. It seemed to be taking an extraordinary amount of time for preheated food to be served. We decided to go across the street to find some lunch. I won't be returning to this place.

I was happy to find a decent selection at International Marketplace, and that was my go to spot for everything I couldn't find elsewhere.

Since I'm new to cooking Indian, it's great to have a huge selection of pre made spice/sauce packs to add to whatever kind of meat you want to cook.

They also have a huge freezer section. Not only do they have frozen naan and roti, but also paratha, sheermal, chapatti, bhature, taftan, what? I don't even know what most of those are but they are all types of flatbread.

2223022,2010-08-29,5,-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw,"As soon as I saw Sangeetha's opening day review, I yelled at my husband, ""Get in the car! There's a new Indian grocery in town!"" Who cares that it was already getting dark and we live across town? Sangeetha spoke of bright lights and wide aisles. This I had to see!

(So, for those of you Yelping via the iPhone app, Sangeetha is truly the rightful ""Duchess"" of Rani's World Foods. I'm just the usurper who happened to be the first one able to check in via phone after she added it. Hopefully this abdication gets me out of hosting a ball or posing nude in the tabloids... sorry, my understanding of traditional Duchess responsibilities is pretty limited, but I'm pretty sure those are the big two. ANYway...)

I was expecting terrible parking like you sometimes get in those strip malls along Sahara, but the lot at Rani's was well marked and spaced and easy to maneuver. It was 7:30ish, so crowds had lessened from what Sangeetha described, but there were still plenty of customers. Unfortunately, the kitchen had run out of food and closed, but one girl was still walking around with her samosas and they smelled heavenly.

I've been pretty satisfied with an Indian grocery near Fort Apache (this doesn't seem the place to name names) for getting the things we need, but Rani's looks like it will be the go-to place for getting things we *want.*

For example, every Indian grocery seems to have Eno (the magic stuff for cross tummies), but Rani's has *lemon* Emo. It's those ittle extras like that that draw a line between ""corner store"" and ""grocery store."" I'm sure the Hobnob selection was the largest I've seen in town, and let's not start swoonies over the Flakes, Crunchies, Bounties, and other British sweets. Spices aren't just in bags and small jars but are in the huge, huggable sizes as well, and the spices get their own, well-organized aisle that must be twice the length as anywhere else. Rani's is also the first place I've seen that carries whipping cream (local from Anderson Dairy) in quart containers. Maybe other places have all of these things, but if so, I probably missed it in the underlit, cramped spaces that are typical for so many of the little shops. 

Think supermarket, not mini-market. Rani's has carts and baskets and reusable bags. The aisles are wide, clean, and well-lit. (Alas, it seems to be a universal custom that customers will choose to have their long, oblivious conversations, surrounded-by-rings-of-leaping-children, in the middle of such spaces.) In the back of the store (which is somewhat V-shaped) is the aforementioned kitchen. In the middle of all of this are two ultra-modern checkouts - conveyor belts, big LCD screens, and extremely friendly cashiers. These guys are thinking big, and I like how they think.

(Which is not, despite how it sounds, a put-down of the other places. I think there's room enough for everyone, just like the way 7-11, Albertsons, and Whole Foods aren't quite in direct competition.)

What really sets Rani's apart, though - aside from the spacious and organized environment - are the produce and dairy sections. Let's just say I don't think these guys will run out of paneer anytime soon! (Yes, I admit to not always making my own paneer... and by ""not always"" I mean ""every time other than those three times I made sad little handfuls of crumbling curd."") Again, maybe other places have the same array of vegetables appropriate for an Indian feast, but what a difference it makes when everything is laid out so nicely.

The woman who checked us out asked where we heard about them, and I mentioned Sangeetha's review. As the conversation continued, I told her I'd just checked in on Yelp on my phone and would add another glowing review to their Yelp page when I got home. She was anxious that I should know that the store was looking a bit chaotic and not at its best, what with all the customers for opening day, but to me everything looked as clean, bright, and more tidy than you'd expect with customers still everywhere. Really commendable.

Rani's deserves five stars: they have indisputably raised the bar for all Indian groceries in town; the staff is extremely courteous and professional; and we were able to find everything we wanted for a fair price. The only way I could be more pleased is if they start selling Rose's Lime Juice Cordial (the kind made with sugar, not HFCS) or - better yet! - start giving cooking demonstrations or - even better yet! - proper cooking classes. Please give that a think, RWF, and congratulations on the start of something wonderful!",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,9,7,5,LDAQAl59qbOadYPeWtjYbg

Yes there was a friendly lady manning the stove, but another person took my order. When I asked for his recommendation, he suggested the Thali ($7.99), so I took him up on his suggestion. I was then very disappointed to see him grab a Styrofoam plate, and fill some of the compartments with pre-made dishes and then toss it in the microwave. Once it was nuked he added some cilantro, pickled vegetables, and some oily bread (regular Naan would have been better). While the Chickpea dish was very good, the Okra dish had clearly been cooked quite some time ago and was only lukewarm. The rice was very good!

All in all the food was probably very good when it was first made, but, almost $10 for re-heated food you eat with plastic cutlery, off Styrofoam plates (in a market which has little atmosphere) it is over-priced, and over-rated.",g5ihTl7F8VmVuKHtpPYCaw,6,0,2,VE54QKy5tQUjD8dVX9VRqQ

I'm missing Bombay Bazaar in Riverside, CA. They were a clean store, very organized, many selections, carried falooda kulfi, and extremely friendly helpful owners. I walked into Rani's and I wasn't wow-ing.

The store carries A LOT of products however. So I'm glad about that. I took my time through the isles cuz there were items I was thinking of trying. And with my inclination to read labels, to see what I can do with some ingredients, I discovered some turn offs.

I was eyeing the ginger garlic paste. I know I could mix that in with plenty of recipe creations. I checked out two that they had on the shelves - Asian Kitchen & Rani brand. Bitter faced, I read they had expired this past June or July  : /

I came in for flatbread though. I did find what I wanted. Lots of choices! Found the garlic naan yahoooo! And a variety of parathas  : D  Only thing was in the frozen foods section, some packages were misplaced, fallen or left there mishapped. I literally wanted to organize them all back. Maybe they needed help  : /  I  didn't know for certain what I picked was for that shelf price. It's fine I wanted what I placed in the basket.

Walking toward the cashier, I checked if they had rose ice cream (falooda) in the kulfi freezer box. There were miscellaneous frozen food items covering the ice cream tubs. Who did that?! Customers maybe... or were they placed there temporarily for go backs later... 8 \

No buy 2 get 1 free on ready to eat selections here ppptthh. But again LOTS of selections I like. I also like their expanse of hair care products. They have a tall shelf filled with incense - very nice! There's also a restaurant and a decent seating area. Restaurant wasn't open tonight, but pics already posted show some delish rice plates.

Just 4 tables along the freezer aisle is where you sit and eat; self-serve kind of place where the guy hands out your food in plastic plates, water in plastic cups; its right next to  restroom too. Now let's talk about the food -- a thali consists of couple of spoonfuls of 3 different cold vegetable (dal, aloo-gobi, something else) + little rice lets say 4/5 spoonfuls + achar +  a couple of rotis. Pretty much all are room temp or luke warm. Of this food, just the rotis are what's decent. no sweet, papad, or sambhar or anything else. To top it , it no cheap food - all its like $8 bucks! May be if this is served for under 4 bucks or given free (like at a temple or something) - may be OK at that point, even then I will probably avoid though.

Funny story.....as I told Elizabeth.....I wasn't going to visit this locale until I returned next year because this was our last day in Vegas and it wasn't on my ""To Do List"" for today. All the reviews are dead on about this place being LOADED with everything a International Market should have. The Customer Service is AWESOME and despite some tight spots in the store it was extremely organized and very clean. The produce department as advertised was not much to be desired so you can definitely pass on that. However I saved the best for last.....the whole reason we went to this establishment was to find some black salt. I checked the website before I left and found out you could get like 4 different sizes for 4 different prices. So I was looking at the 5oz size which was supposed to be $3.47 according to the website and 32oz (2lbs) for $9.99. 

Now here is something that most people know about me I have ALWAYS believed that while websites can be very accurate it does pay for you to go into the store and physically see the item for yourself because you might find that it is cheaper for WHATEVER reason. Well my theory won out again as we found the 2lb Jar was only $3.99.....that's right.....$3.99 are you kidding me.....WOHOOOO. OOOOO and by the way the 5oz bottle was only $2.99. So please people keep that in mind for future purchases ANYWHERE you shop you just might find the deal of a lifetime folks. 

So this will definitely be a must visit going forward whenever I visit Vegas and again I want to thank Elizabeth B for an AWESOME referral......Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",yH3Jyu5vRTAJ8uMAD2bLGQ,6,4,5,I9rjMFwR7JBZwnySFeCJfg

This store has an amazing array of Indian groceries, frozen foods, produce and to kick it up a notch, they even offer Chaat (Indian snacks) that are served up in their in-house kitchen. 

We had gone for their opening today and it was a zoo...way too many people and the lines to check out were 20/30 minutes long. But...I had to oppurtunity to peruse their aisles and these guys have everything an Indian cook/home may need or want. Pickles, multiple lentil varieties, exotic Indian vegetables, flour, spices...everything was perfectly laid out and easy to find. This store is definitely bigger than any other Indian store in Las Vegas. It's well-lit, well-organized and well-stocked. The trifecta. 

Bonus points to them for their frozen food selections which were not unnecessarily marked up in price - something that the other Indian grocery stores seem to be doing that I frown upon. Gopal's for example, crosses out the manufacturer's suggested price sticker and charges a dollar or two more. These guys don't (at least not yet). 

I haven't had a chance to taste their Chaat offerings as today was free food for all and so the lines were out of control. I hope to have a follow up report some time soon.

Thali Price Alert! Thali Price Alert!

The Thali is no longer $5.99.  It is $7.99.  There has been a $2 increase.  So I told my whole team that it was only $5.99 for a plate of vegetarian ethnic yumminess, based on the Yelp reviews.  When we arrived, I noticed that the where it was supposed to be $5.99, it was covered with a piece of paper with $7.99 written on it.
Boo, I gave false information to my whole team :(

Nonetheless, we all had Thali.  The sweet little lady took precious time (a bit slow for our liking since we had to get back to work) to prepare each tray with whatever she want to put on it.  My tray consisted of the following:
-mashed spinach: doesn't look appetizing, but tasted ok.  I only ate a few bites of this.
-eggplant curry:  was delicious and tasty.  I finished this.
-squash something:  I finished this too.  It was very refreshing.
-tofu something:  was decent, but not as flavorful.  There were three cubes of tofu in this compartment.
-basmati rice with peas-the rice taste good.
-purple onion slices with spicy mango sauce: this was supposed to be the pickle veg on the menu.  Well, it doesn't really taste like it would sound.  We all thought the sauce tasted like pinesol.  We didn't touch this on our tray.
-roti: tasted like tortilla.  I should have asked for paratha.

The milk tea and purified water was complimentary.
I give this a 4 star.

Grocery Store Review:
My co-worker picked up a bag of naan and a bottle of lychee drink from the grocery side.  When she was about to pay for it and flipped over the bag of naan, those visible naans were moldy blue in color.  The guy that was about to ring it up took it and throw it away.  People, make sure you inspect the goods before making a purchase.  Sometimes, we tend to not look at it until we are about to enjoy the food.
I give this a 3 star.

I got lunch thali , masala dosa for meal and samosa chaat/ papri chaat & daal kachouri for snack. 
If ur eating there, it could work only if u add salt, achar / raita and chutney since the basic food was BLAND ... No flavor at all! In thali I was given Daal, chana masala & eggplant masala ... Since I had gotten the food to go, upon opening of the container( they gave all of the above curries with rice in one styrofoam container) it was all into each other... Imagine the rest. 
Masala dosa only came with coconut chutney which was DRY !!! Potato filling with absolutely no flavor ... Huge portion of dosa with only 1/4 filling of potato... Mostly wasted too...they didn't give me any pickles with this... 
Samosa chat would be the only thing I might recommend to any one ! Good portion and priced well for 3.99$. 
Papri chaat .... Horrible ... Why? Soggy like pudding ... They knew my order was to go yet they mixed everything together( rather than giving papri separately ) 
Daal kachouri was HARD to bite... Cold  and hard like a stone  .... 
I feel bad of bringing such horrible food for lunch for my husband ( leaving all the other amazing restaurants in Vegas ) anyways lesson learnt ...

Service is definitely very casual and you may end up standing a counter without no one attending you for minutes but it's all worth the wait if you solely concentrate on the tasty food ..

Try the thali, it's reasonably priced with good option .. In the end, don't forget to try the complimentary free Chai (Tea) ..

It led to a search of cookbooks with many spices I had no clue where to find locally. A little search on Yelp popped up this little gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants! 

The BF and I ate at the food booth in the back and shared a  vegetarian thali (comes with 2 dishes-among several choices, dal, rice, pickles, 2 bread:$5.99), samosa chat (I believe $3.99) and a paneer stuffed paratha w/ yogurt ($2.99). It was plenty of food for two and all very nice. I am a big fan of the samosa chat here though. The chutneys were fresh and vibrant and kept me going for more. There is a water cooler and a hot tea dispenser that is complimentary but there is also various drinks in the fridge area. If you're in the area and want a tasty snack or a nice veggie meal, definitely drop in. 

Grocery side has everything we were looking for! They have also some more common spices that I decided to get here as the prices are really good. For example, I almost bought a $6 jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it's $1.99 for the same amount here. A nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about $1.99 with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around $4, very few are over that. For those who need spices in mass quantities, they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better deal than buying at Sams/Costco. I also hoped I can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek. If you're not into the cooking stuff, there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food. We bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not. I suppose it's hit and miss, but hey, it's packet food and isn't anything like the fresh.

It was super rude so I just kind of waited and she literally just stood there...............................overly committed to no eye contact/ words. When I rhetorically asked what the total was, she was condescending and took over the pin pad transaction as if I'm retarded and continued to not acknowledge me. 
Whatever, right? Nope. I shrugged it off and tried the Vegetarian Kitchen. The girl that took my order was very short with me, also treated me as if I have a mental deficiency for asking what a couple items were. I ordered my food to go and then sat down to try it. At one point the other girl behind the counter looks at me, says something, and then they all look in unison and have a good laugh. I am not dumb, I ordered it to go deliberately, not being wasteful. I felt like I was made to wait unnecessarily long and that I may have been overcharged. The divider in the center of the food prep area was extremely sketchy bc it made me wonder what they were hiding behind it/ potentially doing to my food.

Not only did I feel extremely unwelcome in the store, the herbal face washes I came for ALSO contain artificial dyes and fragrance (aka irritants) even though they are labeled as ""neem face wash,"" the food made me sick (the prepared food in aluminum to-go trays on the countertop without refrigeration is concerning/ health code violation), and the staff has a serious naan up their ass (asking for naan was apparently a blunder LOL).",gLsaRKSqdtCoju8Rh0yIHA,2,0,1,Df9r59DWxbyYMpTyxG_gkA

The eggplant curry was definitely the hit of the afternoon with big chunks of eggplant and a perfectly balanced seasoning. It is very informal.

So, my friend and I were going to get back in the car to go kill time till they opened.

The older woman who runs the kitchen knocked on the glass and motioned for us to come in.  She opened an hour early for us. 

THAT is grade A service.  The young lady who rang us up commented about me making ""a cup"" of tea in a joking manner, so we joked a little, but then I said how PG Tips is my favorite, and she AND the older woman made conversation with me about how its their favorite too.

I ended up dabbing my bread off with napkins before bites due to how much oil was on them. Everything else was forgettable though. The vegetable samosas were delicious.

They used to serve very nice tea with ginger n masala , now tea is bland with no taste at all 
Paneer Parantha used to be like Indian dabba before , in short yummy but now they have increased the price n reduced paneer quantity to half , I will suggest you to order gobi or aloo ones as at least those are properly filled with stuffing .

My friend and I went to eat their food (that everyone raves about here on Yelp)

When we got there, there was a long line, 2 people in front of me, and about 6 people behind me. 

The older lady at the counter PURPOSEFULLY went out of the way when it was our turn to order, and she got the person behind me's order. 

At first I thought, ""Ok, whatever, one time fluke. I'll order after them"" 

After she skipped me, I told her my order, but she ignored me and took the NEXT person behind me in Hindi and took THEIR order. I'm like, ""Is she serious!?""

Again, I held my breath but I'm sure they could see how impatient I'd become. After being skipped twice, I finally ordered my order. (2 samosas and a mango lassi) 

I ordered my food and tried to pay, but strangely, she didn't take my money like she was doing with everybody else ordering. I thought that was strange, but again, thought nothing of it. 

I went and sat at the table to wait for my order, meanwhile, the line growing to another 3 people after I ordered (a total of 9 people that ordered after me!) 

I waited for 27 minutes... and EVERY SINGLE person that ordered after me had their food. I went up to the counter and asked them where my food was. At this point the lady seemed to purposefully  be ignoring me and didn't even want to take my money to pay!! I told her I wanted my samosas and if I could please get them, and.... finally... a taller gentlemen came out, and pulled the samosas out and gave them to me. (They had been sitting behind some dishes) 

I don't understand the reasons why we were so severely ignored by the staff, but it definitely didn't escape my notice that we were NOT Indian and everybody else that got served before us were. 

Rani's world, I'm not sure if you care about these reviews, but you have to train your staff better. My 10 year old nephew started feeling bad that we were being pushed aside and forgotten by the staff.",5x-oeGbDdUSogKeVPihrvw,6,0,1,a2aaJY9Px2T3G0Thv6r7IA
