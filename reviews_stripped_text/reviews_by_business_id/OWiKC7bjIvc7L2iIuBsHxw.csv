I get that it was late at night, but she was rude for no reason. I didn't get her name but she was a blonde lady. Anyhow, she never checked on our table and we did not get any refills, I guess she expected us to come up to the bar and ask her. She gave us our food and that was it. We would even say thank you and she would just nod her head, haha. You can respond with ""you're welcome"". And there were literally only 5 people in the place so there was no reason for her not check on us.

In the past few months however we noticed that the quality of service had been going downhill. This could be because of the turnover of quality workers.

Last night, we were there again, out of habit.  Again, I was reminded why I told myself the last time to remember not to go there anymore.  We were there minutes before 2 groups walked in.  There were no other diners when we walked in except for an inebriated 2 males trying to hook up loudly with an equally inebriated female.  Hmmm . . . this scene never happened before in this restaurant. Although, this restaurant has a bar, I have always felt that this restaurant was like your decent nice neighborhood restaurant where folks from the community go to have a nice peaceful dinner.  Note: the dining room is separated from the bar by a wall.

Anyway, we were sitting there for a few minutes when 2 groups came in.  To make the story short, we were served last - with a condescending pat on my back . . . .  and ""there, there, you are happy now, you are no longer hungry"", says the waitress Deborah.  All that time, I never uttered a word of complaint.  I, however, was looking around and wondering why this happened again.  And we only ordered sandwiches.

The place was fairly empty; there were a couple groups in the restaurant area and a couple in the bar. It was a while before we saw a waitress. When she came to our table we asked her about the happy hour specials. She seemed a little frazzled, she said she couldn't find it but said they had beer and it's happy hour. What? What does that mean? My brother ordered a whiskey and coke and I was still deciding. Later she came back and said she had found the happy hour menu. She apologized and said she had only worked there a couple months and Pts was buying it. So I guess she wasn't interested in learning their menu even though she was the only waitress working. She brought us waters and then it was a while before we saw her again. It was a good 15 minutes before my brother got his drink and we saw the waitress pick it up at the bar where it had been sitting since he ordered it, getting watered down. We then ordered food and I ordered a hard cider. I can't remember what brand it was but I asked for it by its full name. The waitress looked at me confused and wanted to see the menu even though it's the only cider they serve. The food was pretty decent and at a good value.  I ordered the fish tacos they had on lunch special for $6.95. They were very good and I would get them again. My brother got chicken nachos that were on happy hour for $5 and they were huge. He said that they were ok but didn't like that they used the fake processed cheese mixed in with shredded cheese. After we had finished the waitress came back and started clearing our dishes. She asked me if I was still drinking my water, I said yes and then she took my glass of cider that still had an inch of cider in it. I couldn't believe it. I enjoyed the food but I wouldn't come back because of the service and I guess it's changing to a PTs.

Their happy hour specials are domestic drafts for $3, imported drafts for $4, house glasses of wine for $3, and select appetizers for $5",fX_0KEU0Udjag2FssMSCfw,0,0,2,BIT4QStouWPbKmxKdUA5AQ

We came on a busy-ish night where most of the bar was full. We still found a place at the bar and asked the bartender for a menu. We waited and waited and played some video poker to waste some time. Ten minutes later she brought the menu. This is when we asked to sign up for their players club card since we figured we would be coming back a lot. She seemed almost offended that we would ask such a thing and said no, it was too busy. So we ordered drinks and bar food. Again, took a while (about 35 minutes). The food not bad and she didn't charge us for the beers since we were playing. 

In the case that we just came to the bar on an off night, we might try one more time. However, the last time left us feeling very unwelcome and as if we were inconveniencing them with out patronage.

A little background -- the last time in December, the waitress had ticked off the rest of my party so badly that 9 out of 13 of us stormed out. Waitress was wearing a Patriots shirt and it was a Thursday night, we were checking out the place for the first time. We were sitting at tables in the bar trying to get the one and only waitress who was serving everyone in the bar and the dining area. However she chose to ignore us for 20 minutes and then when we finally got her attention she was just plain rude and huffy, told us she couldn't do separate checks, and we should just order our drinks at the bar!  Long story short, only 4 of us stayed as everyone else was so disgusted they left. The manager apologized to me and the remaining 3 but then all we got were excuses. 20 minutes later she finally decides to offer us free sliders for the trouble. She also comped our first round of drinks for the 4 people remaining. By this time too little too late for the rest of my group, they refused to come back. 

SO, my boyfriend and I dared to return and we sat at the bar. Didn't see rude server this time, the place was not very busy like last time though. We did get great service from the blonde bartender who was very attentive and polite the entire time. Tried the nachos and the fried pickles which was on the happy hour menu. It was just ok... but not bad for bar food. Disappointed that they didn't carry the flatbread pizzas anymore but they are still on the menu. They don't have HD TVs either which is too bad because they have some fairly decent sized TVs in the bar.
