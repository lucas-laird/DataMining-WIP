FOOD 3/5
Wanted to try fried calamari squid legs but they were sold out so we had the the takoyaki instead which wasn't fresh and had barely noticeable squid. 
I had the ""let's get physical"" fried chicken ramen which was good, chicken was crispy and the added spice paste really made the meal worth it. 
My boyfriend had the ""Shinya way to heaven"" which he thought was Ok. It has the creamy broth with added spicy paste and the chasu was thick and delicious. 

SERVICE 
2/5
Food came out kinda slow and since we were the only ones there at first, our server didn't check on us very often and kept going back to the kitchen. Took another 5 minutes before we could eat because we didn't receive spoons. We noticed that other diners after us were taken care of and done before us. It took another 10 min to get our check, and when I asked about the free topping for yelp checkin the server didn't know what to do so had to go back and talk to the manager on duty who apparently was unaware about it & it took longer to update our check. Our final check only gave us 1 discount topping when the manager noted that we had two for both our check ins. We didn't bother trying to fix it because it wasn't worth having to wait another 10 min for the server to notice us again.

ATMOSPHERE
5/5 I really liked the inside decor, pretty artistic wall art that gave a young hip vibe to the place. I enjoyed the fun creative names for all the menu items. The music selection is on point. Good EDM choices. 

Overall, the ambience of the place hyped me up for the experience but the food and service was very underwhelming so probably won't come here again.

3088838,2018-05-29,0,pwdZMC9Q2QH2uNbUj3NDeA,"On a Sunday afternoon I took my parents to Fukumimi for ramen, but as usual the wait was long and Chinatown so far away. Right as my dad asked why no one else is capitalizing on the ramen craze on the east side, my mom remembered that Shinya had just opened near the Hard Rock, so we decided to try it out. 

Shinya is quite a bit bigger than most ramen shops in town, but not exceedingly so. There was one other party there when we arrived and we were seated and greeted quickly. We ordered a couple Sapporos on draft ($2 opening special right now) as well as an order of the shishito peppers. The peppers were plentiful, with thinly shaved bonito on top that added a bit of tang to the sweet and charred peppers. I ordered the miso ramen, my mom had the tonkatsu shoyu and my dad had the chicken karaage bowl. 

Shinya offers 6 types of ramen, 3 of which are more ""traditional"" (shio, miso, and tonkatsu), and the other 3 are bit more unusual (fried chicken, chicken, and vegan). I was happy to see they ventured out of the standard toppings as well, offering a fish cake and bamboo shoots with my miso. The ramen had maybe slightly less noodles than some other restaurants, as I was easily able to finish the bowl. The broth had a decent amount of kick, though I did ask for some chili oil to go along with it. The chashu though was absolutely gigantic. They give you two thick pieces that are probably 5-6"" long. My dad's karaage bowl was a bit small, but for $4 it's a good snack. They asked if he wanted any sauces with it and brought out 3 different types for him to try which I thought was a little odd. Why not just serve the bowl with sauces anyways? 

Overall Shinya is a much welcomed, much less busy ramen spot in a newly renovated strip mall across from Hard Rock. I don't see much of a reason to have to go to Fukumimi anymore, unless I need tan tan men. Hopefully more people give Shinya a try and it can succeed.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,2,1,4,g8RwUlnC67iZUkzVZopTGA

As this was a soft opening, I expected some hiccups.  But overall the waitress seemed to be so overwhelmed and a real novice.  She didn't write anything down and inevitably screwed up both of our dishes.  Chicken in mine, pork in hers, no corn in hers, thin noodles in mine.  Little things that could have easily been taken care of if the order was written down.

When the food came out correctly, both the chickan and tonkatsu broth was a little meaty but tasty.  Mild spice although we asked for double spicy paste.  There were too many noodles for my liking, but this might appeal to other ramen eaters out there.  Noodles were very thin and just your typical variety.  As far as the meat goes, both the pork and chicken were outstanding.  The chicken was more a shredded or rotisserie, rather than chashu.  The pork was thick pork belly and really grilled to perfection.  The rest of the ramen accompaniments were just average, complete with onion, bamboo shoot, and egg (and added corn for $1).  

Because of our fiasco with the food, the manager thankfully gave us a discount due to growing pains of the new restaurant.  It's really a nice and simple gesture to bring a customer back.  For the meat alone, Shinya Maru could be worth another go; maybe to try a rice bowl instead.  Nice to have one near the strip on this side of town, but there are surely still better options either in China Town or Southwest.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,1,3,vD4sI5iJiPJNDUlgaapgsQ

SERVICE - Our server was very friendly and gave us great recommendations for appetizers. Food came out fast!

AMBIENCE/DECOR - Casual with a very cozy feel. Love the decor and lighting. They have tables for 2 or 4 and a long table in the center which can accommodate larger groups.

FOOD - Everything was delicious with good portions and great pricing! If you're not starving one appetizer is definitely enough to share between 2 people plus ramen. We were STUFFED with our two appetizers!

[AGEDASHI TOFU] - $5.50/4pcs - A little too much soy sauce but the tofu had the perfect texture. The outside crunchy layer was thicker and more chewy than others I've had. Loved this! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Just ask for less sauce or have it on the side.

[EYE OF THE TAKOYAKI] - $5/5pcs - Delicious and VERY filling. 

[KILLING MISO SOFTLY] - $11 - The chasu pork was PERFECTION. Loved the spicy flavor. Broth was a bit too salty but very tasty. I wonder if they had low-sodium option?

The bf and I just finished our first night at our first ever EDC so naturally we were starving. We're also huge ramen fiends. This place is new so a lil low on ratings, we decided to give it a chance since it was so close to our hotel.

They've done a great job with the interior, it feels like a cozy hip izakaya in San Francisco it's almost a bit of a shock when you step back outside into a Vegas shopping center.

Idk if the owners just always have good taste in music or if they know the clientele for the weekend but they had A+ music playing. Never gonna complain about Tycho and ODESZA. 

Hands down best tonkotsu broth I've ever had. I got the Shinya and bf got the Shoyu. I liked his a little better tbh. No skimpy thin chashu here, the pieces they give are thick and cooked perfectly, so flavorful! 

We also got the agedashi tofu, which is one of my bfs favs and he was very impressed.

I wasn't too crazy about the ramen through. I must say I've had better, but I would go back again because  of vibes.",ztIQ_Vj5HzZOYmN1pjkWsA,0,0,5,D6t5BtdKyKDSwnoleHjqwA

My main gripe was that the soup could have been warmer. But the service was friendly, we were asked about our experience by management on how they could improve, and it's also vegan ramen so I couldn't penalize this place too hard.

I came by again to give it another shot. I asked for extra garlic to add more flavor, and I received a bowl of lukewarm ramen with definitely no extra garlic. My friend's was also lukewarm, which made us both sad. There's nothing more unforgivable to me, someone who enjoys their food at a temperature that rivals the sun's, to receive a barely above room temperature bowl of soup.

I'm over-exaggerating, of course, but Shinya definitely has some bumps to smooth out.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,8,3,2,Uhk0tLYClu6Gdl9Xk1X7mw

I ordered In Bloom ramen which is a vegan ramen. I recommend it, it's delicious.",5Fh6cbIoftPE7LISJBlPGg,0,0,5,eDKO2TR938805qiR1HMDRQ

Highly recommend. It took awhile due to the place being slammed with edc raver traffic which was a little annoying but the staff was super friendly - lengthy 40 minutes from ordering. The slaw with house dressing was awesome too.",NYqsF-UgXJAOghqi1gJv7A,0,0,4,YsdWP0fsZj5IkiGOEWvXQQ
