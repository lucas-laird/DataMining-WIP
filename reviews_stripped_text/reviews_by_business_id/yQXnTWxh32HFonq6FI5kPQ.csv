We ordered several different things and it was all good.  Wings were crispy and on the larger side.  Much better than BWW.  The onion rings were awesome, super crunchy and not insanely greasy.  My coworkers each ordered burgers and appeared to enjoy them.  I found myself repeatidly staring at them, the burgers that is.  My buffalo chicken sandwhich was great.

The bad?  The price is horendous.  You want fries with that?  Well pony up because the sandwiches don't come with them.  Want a soda?  That doesn't come with it either.  I didn't look at the bill but I'm certain it was over $50 for the three of us.

No condiments on the tables?  Yeah the girl was quick with the small cups of ketchup but let me man the bottle please.

I'll definitely come back as long as work is picking up the tab, otherwise, well otherwise probably not.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,0,0,3,c9jrDI1jYTDodCDwY_UFAA

So the owner got greedy and decided to no longer pay franchising fees, rebrands with ""Meat Chix & Weiners"" ...seriously?  that's the best you could come up with?  What a cheesy take on the whole ""Sin City"" Vibe.  

The food is noticeably different, the prices are now higher than they were before, no more $1 beers and the staff has even changed from awesome, up beat women to apologetic & concerned due to taking the brunt of all the ""what do you mean you dont serve combos anymore?""

I'll never go back to this place.  Frankly, I'll probably buy in to a Chicken Bonz franchise and start it up across the street from this idiot.",ItJkc5DiHLk3pD3K9-NHEA,5,3,1,_zF3i4N0uz5xlEYmwBe34g
1649078,2013-04-22,0,yQXnTWxh32HFonq6FI5kPQ,"Just like Chicken Bonz, but with a few new things on the menu. The chicken wings/fingers are fresh & above average, but definitely not worth the price. It shouldn't cost 2 people $29 to have chicken fingers, sodas & onion rings. Boo!",YNDGH84LjICg5TOo1HLDWw,3,1,2,4zmWHHtDyHIxTAQO4Wz5jA

Besides, this new name/place sounds like a sex club or something. BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL CHICKEN BONZ!!",dIjif99SlqE7tfcwvbcqAQ,2,1,2,fHVIucxvD1pT3KGGjB_uFA
