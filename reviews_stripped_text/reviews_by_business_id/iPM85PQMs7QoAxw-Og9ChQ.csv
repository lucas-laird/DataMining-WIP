Happy Hour is 3-7PM and 9-CLOSE, in the bar and outside patio areas.  $1 off beer, $5 cocktails, and some appetizer deals.  Last night we ordered my go-to favorite GB beer- Marzen.  Always delicious.  We also got the Homemade Chips ($5; with bacon, blue cheese, some blue cheese sauce (we assumed), and green onions).  They were good, not great, but we ordered a side of blue cheese dressing and that bumped them up a notch.  Also ordered the pork sliders ($5 for 3 total with some onion straws/rings).  They were tasty, but again, not fabulous.  The onion straws were good, though a touch on the greasy side.

I LOVE the crispy artichoke hearts that they have, though they are not on the new happy hour menu, which is sad for me. :-(  Still enjoy our HH though.

Service was good.  Started out strong and then fizzled.  At 530PM on a thursday, the seats were pretty plentiful and it never got packed, but did fill in nicely as the night progressed.  Total came in around $34 (tip included).",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,2,0,4,Cfp-TS7k73b55Mikv796bg

141466,2012-10-27,2,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"My first visit to GB was at a happy hour (good value). I saw all the raves about the garlic fries here, so I tried the tapas and the garlic fries. The tapas was ok. The garlic fries were ok, if a bit soggy. Really, ravers about the garlic fries? Hmm. They were ok at best. That's just at the time of eating, never mind the aftermath. I totally love garlic, but these must've somehow had a powerful chemical reaction in me that caused really gross burps all night (the zombies and clowns weren't the only scary things at FrightDome that night!). Then when the garlicky farts started...ay carumba! Talk about gagsville! The next day, my husband called me Garlic Girl!  Maybe it was the combo of garlic fries with all the roasted garlic in the tapas. 

I'll give GB another go, especially at happy hour prices but will avoid all things garlicky. Or maybe I'll just go to Kona Grill or Cheesecake Factory instead.

We didn't know this the first few times and could've saved on our appetizers. They have plenty of booths in this area as well, if you are like me and prefer a booth. 

The blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich is bomb! If you've never been here or tried it, I definitely recommend ordering this sandwich. I literally order this with a side of garlic fries every single time I come here (and have my boyfriend order a new entree to try out haha). The presentation seems to always change and I have to admit the last one I got was a tad saltier than normal, but nevertheless it was still really good. 

The Cajun pasta is flavorful and has a good amount of meat. 

The Woodford Reserve bourbon salmon is also tasty. I prefer the sweet glaze on the side, though. 

The calamari is lightly breaded and fried, which is nice. I like to dip mine in salt, pepper, and lemon juice. 

The blue crab and artichoke dip is a good appetizer. I really like the crostinis they serve along side it. The only negative is that there isn't much crab in the dip.

The happy hour crowd comes to take advantage of the great specials (from 5-7 and 9-close, I believe): $3 beers and $5 food. I've never thought GB's beer was the best in the world, but it's definitely respectable and a solid craft brew. 

In a town dominated by strip malls, wide streets and parking lots, GB's outdoor patio is about as good as it gets for al fresco dining or drinking. One upside is the generally good people-watching, though.",afZAAOVBbSdQUxSMnEurWw,0,0,4,jmkN8TXtwlgvR2cdq-rJkw

Most bars I've worked at charge roughly $12 for premium liquor to start, an extra $2 bump for rocks, martinis or doubles. I typically go for their margaritas, which are a double pour, and they're only $5 on happy hour. WINNING. I always have a pleasant head change after ponying up to the bar during happy hour or watching the game.
As for the food, I've always been a fan, even before I became more of a happy hour patron. When I do dinner here, tataki salad is awesome, pastas and steaks rock, and the side veggies always get destroyed. Long story short, I've never not left here feeling fat and happy.
As for the yelpers who wanna complain the the fried foor doesn't have a prettyu presentation... are you gonna mount it and hang it on your wall, or eat it? Seriously...

We were staying at the LaQuinta Inn across the street and had a 10% off food coupon. Even without a coupon this place is worth it. 
We went early, 4:00ish but not for Happy Hour. Not busy at all, nice and quiet. Our waiter Julio was  adorable, helpful and attentive. 
I had the beer tasting sampler. 7 of their beers; all but two were great. My husband did not care for his Schwartzbier, too light in flavor and color. The Czech Pilsener was our favorite. 
Now for the food... My husband had the bone-in Ribeye which melted in your mouth. He said it was second only to Joe's Crab Prime Steak and Seafood at Caesar's. I had Calamari appetizer, so-so, but the wasabi sauce was great. Then I had the Lobster and Crab cake appetizer. Flavorful lobster and crab and lots of it, no fancy spices or fillers. I don't know how they managed to hold it together. With that I had the lettuce wedge salad, also huge, and the best blue cheese dressing I have had in a restaurant. Lots of bacon crumbles and blue cheese chunks as well. Finally, we each had a mini dessert. Strawberry cheesecake and warm apple bread pudding.

957727,2011-04-11,0,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"Gordon Biersch is fantastic! I love coming here, the food is always great and the service is spectacular. I have eaten in both the dining area and the bar area and we are always greeted promptly and well taken care of even when it is insanely busy in there. The patio is great and you can't beat it during spring/summer nights. It can get busy in the bar area during happy hour and it is self seating in the bar so be prepared to cheat, lie, steal, or shank someone for a table or booth when one opens up. The happy hours are great too, tons of great apps and drinks for decent prices. I paid $6.75 for a happy hour Blue Moon at Roadrunner Saloon and the beers at GB are stronger, better, and $4 during happy hour. Piss of Roadrunner. I hate you. 

If you are in the mood for a nice dining experience they have a nice dining area, the service there is also impeccable. I have never had an issue with the service and the waiters are fun, witty, and good at their jobs. 

Okay, I have to get on my soapbox for a minute, I am a waiter in a nice family restaurant so as for these people complaining about the place closing. Gordon Biersch is not a 24 hour bar. It is more so a nicer RESTAURANT. You can't walk into a restaurant at 10pm on a weekday and bitch when you are told that they are closing soon or that it is happy hour food only. There is a last call at a restaurant. If you want to sit at a bar and drink all night go to Three Angry Wives down the road. I am pretty sure the hours at GB during the week are till about 11pm and 1am on weekends. I've been there one time when it was quite late and there were only a few other people in the restaurant we were told they were closing soon and only serving happy hour food. So instead of being a bitch about it and thinking that because it is Vegas that every place should bend to me and stay open 24 hours I went to an actual bar that was open and got some food and suds. Stop whining people, not everyone is here to serve you at 11pm. Would you walk into a BJ's and expect them to stay open past their closing time for you and your two friends only? Besides everyone knows that 30 minutes prior to closing your getting the shit food that has been sitting out waiting for last minute customers to stroll in.

Great location and good food, Gordon Biersch is a decent spot to grab a micro brew and an appetizer with friends. The GB (Gordon Biersch) beers they have on tap have never disappointed me, but never really blown me away either. They have many other cocktails, but when you order a sweet cocktail at a place like this, expect little liquor and lots of sugar. For some that is just fine, but when I order a cocktail, I want to taste the spirits with every sip. 

The decor is nice here. There are many vintage prints on the wall with names like Campari, Bugatti, and some German products being featured. The bar has a few TVs, but this is not a sports bar. There are copper colored accents around the restaurant which ornament the wood trim. 

The food - Good stuff in general. The appetizer platter is a nice way to start the meal if you're with a group. I especially love the Asian wings, which have a sticky glaze, crisp breading, and sweet-chili flavor. The garlic fries are GAAAAARRRLIICTASTIC! They are delicious, but stay away from them if you plan on doing some kissing or close talking after dinner. Really nobody should be close talking anyways, its gross and people don't like it.

Great weather on a Saturday in February, so my husband I decided to go to happy hour and sit outdoors. We were out running errands, and Gordon Biersch was right in the middle of our route. 

We've been here before, but never for happy hour. I was expecting a happy hour on par with other beer-based chain restaurants, like the Yard House or BJs, with half-priced apps and reduced drink prices. While there were a few price reductions, the options seemed a little limited. I opted for a California Cobb flatbread, which was supposed to be $3 off, and my husband stuck to the regular menu and ordered the aforementioned Farmhouse burger.

While my flatbread was fine, my husband was stunned by how flavorful his burger was. The charbroiled burger was topped with bacon jam, tomato, arugula, and a fried egg. To quote him, ""Somebody here knows how to cook an egg.""  I, for one, hate runny egg yolk, but he is a professional cook, so he knows what he's talking about.

We each had two beers (IPAs for him and white IPAs for me), and they were each $1 off. But I was charged full price for my flatbread. I didn't want to quibble over $3, so I let it slide. But next time an unseasonably warm day pops up, I think I'll just make a few drinks and sit out on my own patio -- unless my husband has a hankering for a Farmhouse burger.

Good service, great beer, quality food. I had fish oscar. It was very very good and came out very quickly. This is a good place to dine in Las Vegas, without the outragious prices you usually see there. For some reason, LV thinks it can charge 2 1/2 the price you'd expect. This place is an exception.

Better maibach than the Hofbrauhaus near the strip GB, and a higher alc content too, 8 vs 7. 

Plenty of TVs around the bar and dining tables in the back, as well as large party rooms in the back which I have been in for a work xmas party. GB also worked for Mothers Day brunch, dinner with the girlfriend, and of course watching sports at the bar enjoying GB BEER!

Nice staff always friendly, usually get greeted by a manager or two. See bartenders around town off work sometimes too.

Warm decor nothing loud or clashy, comfortable and sometimes dimly lite and intimate towards the back.

Walking in on a saturday night at 6pm, there was surprisingly not much of a wait. Maybe ten minutes. We requested for a booth, which is why we had a bit of a wait.

My husband and step dad headed to the bar to get a couple beers. Marzen was the name if I remember correctly.

We were seated towards the middle, with a waiter named Scott. He was very personable and friendly. He opened up to us about how our 2 year old daughter reminded him of his daughter who is 15 months. Instantly our daughter gravitated to him and his warm personality. He asked if we wanted something for her to munch on while we waited. YES! Please!

While waiting to pick out our meals, Scott brought my daughter a big bowl of fruit filled with grapes, cantalope, melon, and pineapple. She loved it. Kept her entertained too.

After looking at the large menu, we decided to start with an app, calamari. I loved it. YUM. It came with two sauces. A regular red marinara, and then a different tarter lemony, mustardy sauce. It was great. Very unusual. Never had that with calamari before.

As our meals, I ordered the lobster mac n cheese. ($20) It was very light, buttery and refreshing. There was plenty of lobster, in small bite sized pieces. Cooked to perfection. Ive had it in pasta before and always found it over cooked. The shrimp was delicious and a nice pair. It was usual because it came with bow tie pasta instead of the usual macaroni. A nice change. It was a good sized mount, but after eating a bit of the app i could only finish half. My step dad and husband had no problem finishing off the rest.

My step dad and husband got the steak. ($22) Dad got it with veggie and mash potatoes. Hubby got it with fruit and garlic fries. I certainly made sure to try a bit of everything they had. The mash potatoes were full of garlic and potato skins. YUCK, i hate skins. The garlic fries were very tasty and very well seasoned. The steak on both, were cooked to perfection. My step dads was medium rare and extremely tender. I made sure to go back for second bites on that. The veggies were a type of medley, of zucchini and carrots. I noticed the portions were a little smaller than i expected

My daughter got the mac n cheese with fruit and asked for an extra side, which was french fries. ($5) Scott had no problem giving us a second side for no extra charge. Sweet! Her mac n cheese tasted just like the kraft type, which is her favorite. French fries were medium sliced.

All the food came out piping hot which is a very nice change to some of the restaurant Ive been to before. I actually burned my tongue on my lobster/shrimp pasta. 

For dessert we ordered, the apple cinnamon bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream AND their brownie and ice cream drizzled with carmel and chocolate sauce. Both were barely warm, almost cold but they were still really good. It took 20 minutes for our desserts, which was ridiculous. Thank goodness my daughter was preoccupied with crayons and the guys were busy with the football game on the tv. I'm sure they would have been the highlight of our meals had they been hot. The waiter Scoot apologized and took both desserts off our bill and said he was sorry everything took so long because the kitchen was backed up. 

other than a few bumps in the road the customer service was outstanding and the food was very good. We def will be coming back.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,4,2,4,outv0ujo-Nya3fSzjSR09A

The veggie pizza is my favorite $5 appetizer but the tapas with flatbread and garlic fries are decent snack options too. The baja tacos with sauteed fish are a good, shareable choice as well. It's a serving of 4 tacos for $7 during happy hour. 

The service in the bar area is usually great. If it gets crowded it can be a little slow but it's never been bad. I used to sit outside on the patio.

We ordered an appetizer and two starter salads which came AFTER the entrees hit the table. Being that we too are restaurant people, we chose not to have anything sent back or re-made to waste food. So with a table FULL of food the dressing on my salad was wrong.... Including realizing I didn't even get the correct entree. They remade the correct entree and brought it out in good timing. After not being able to enjoy most of the food due to having EVERYTHING AT ONCE... We ordered for my four year old daughter the dessert on the kids menu. I believe it was an Oreo cake of some sort... I wish I could post the video of how ROCK HARD this thing was.... I couldn't even penetrate it by raising my hand and stabbing it over and over. Who plates that and sends it out to a child? I sent that back and asked for the check. All of this without ONE manager visit... With as slow as it was having 8-10 tables in the restaurant one would assume you'd have time to table touch. So we paid the bill in full because no one cared to possibly try to do any kind of guest recovery. I am not saying it's a bad place or not to go but this experience was absolutely terrible and shameful with such a great named place. Again being in the industry myself I stayed and kept a smile on my face the whole time.

This place was so good and so chill to just hangout in too. 

I thought it was pretty funny because there was a huge line of people waiting and they were even giving out buzzers, but I just went straight to the hostess, asked for a table for 4 and they sat us immediately. i seriously think I must've jacked someone's place. 

I guess the happy hour was only for the bar and patio, BUT since we asked our waiter about it, he secretly slipped us the happy hour menu. He told us to keep that a secret, so I'm not naming names. That guy was funny though. He did it all stealth status by telling my bf to open his big menu and slipping the small happy hour menu inside of that one. 

There were 3 of us and we weren't starving or anything, so we just decided to share the slider combo and calamari. 11 bucks for the combo and 7 bucks for the calamari. Oh how I love happy hour deals!

The calamari came out with marinara sauce. Mmm, like sex in my mouth, it was so good! I always love finding places with good calamari. 

The sliders and garlic fries were sexy! It was perfect because it came with 2 different sliders, 3 of each kind and there were 3 of us. So we each got 2 sliders and shared the garlic fries which was so garlicky delicious!

As we were finishing up our sliders, some other waitress came up and said ""want some edamame?"" I'm so happy we said yes because that was a serious garlic sex explosion in my mouth. OMG. I have never had garlic edamame! This is something I'll be sure to get everytime I come back because it was just soo tasty! Unfortunately they charged us for it which we didn't expect since she randomly dropped it off. We were under the impression they got the wrong order for another table and offered it to us for free.

I offered it to everyone at my table who also agreed with me that it was extremely lemony, and it didn't taste like strawberry at all even though the color was correct.

I ordered a steak sandwich, and I asked for it medium. It came out completely rare. Parts of the steak were tough, greasy, and fatty. I really didn't enjoy that at all.

We went in and the hostess brought us around the bar area to the dining room.  Now, ordinarily (especially in Las Vegas) most establishments won't honor their Happy Hour specials outside of the bar area, so when we got to our table I asked the hostess if we could still get Happy Hour specials in the dining room.  She was rude and seemed a annoyed that I was asking her that question.  She said she thought we could and I reiterated that most places don't allow that.  She then sarcastically replied that I would have to speak with our server.

Ok, so our hostess wasn't actually interested in being cordial, whatever.  Our server arrived and informed us that we COULD get Happy Hour prices and we ordered drinks and several appetizers.  One thing I liked about this place was that if you order a Red Bull/Vodka (which wasn't included in the Happy Hour cost), they give you the remainder of the Red Bull in the can and our server instructed me to just order a Happy Hour vodka and mix it myself.  I like when an establishment thinks of me and my wallet before their final bill total.

All in all, the food was good and the drinks were good, but the service had room for improvement.  However, I will say that we ordered one of our items, the pototo chip nachos, and it didn't have enough cheese on it.  The manager made his rounds to inquire about everyone's evening and when he stopped at out table, one of the girls pointed it out to him.  He immediately took the entire dish back to the kitchen and had them add more cheese to it.  That just sat well with me.

I'll more than likely be back, but I'll plan for it to be on a more leisurely weekday and hope that the OVERALL customer service is better.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,1,0,3,BxEWONfoYXCTgBT0qZXfrA

  The food is always good at GB, but like so many other restaurants they've added some cheap ingredients to some of their signature dishes. One glaring example of cheapening their dishes is the gorgonzola salad with pecan crusted chicken. The greens originally used in this salad were a fresh spring mix. It was awesome for a while. Now the salad is made with iceberg lettuce. Needless to say, the taste of this dish has suffered significantly!

3592599,2011-06-26,2,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"In a year that has so far been defined by culinary episodes of grand disappointment, Gordon Bierch doesn't fail to fail - in fact, it just may be the king of the worst.

A recent happy-hour visit to the Boca Park eatery had me doing something I almost never do -completely reject of the entire meal.

Along with my micro-brew selection, I ordered an Asian themed trio of appetizers, which featured Shrimp, Egg Rolls and Potstickers. After a small sampling of each of the three offerings, I was literally so disgusted that I pushed the plate away.

To begin with, there was no plate presentation. I likened it to walking through an art gallery, looking at blank walls. The Egg Rolls were cut at a bias (yea art) and the Potstickers were covered with a trail of Ponzu and Mustard Sauce (but we'll get to that later). Otherwise, there was not even a simple piece of Kale to offset the distinctively bland looking trio on a plain white plate.

Shrimp - by par the ""best"" offering of the three. The shrimp looked and tasted like boxed, frozen, breaded 40-60 sized shrimp that I think were prepared in a microwave. Even the delightfully refreshing Sweet Chili Sauce did little to detract from the bland taste and pasty bread coating.

Egg Rolls - I am not sure who ""discovered"" this specific recipe, but they should consider a career change immediately. The rolls were stuffed with chicken and some sort of brown sauce that one could not even distinguish what flavor it was suppose to add (or subtract) from the dish. Each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by an unsavory chalky taste and a not-at-all faint aroma of frying oil.

Potstickers - I would like to say I could tell you what the Potstickers tasted like, but the trail of Mustard Sauce was so powerful I could barely wash the taste from my mouth with the bitterness of my micro-brew. The sauce is extreme, to say the least, and could easily impart it flavor with as little as a drop on each Potsticker. Instead, the kitchen decided to drown each Potsticker with almost a teaspoon worth of this disgusting concoction. I wish I knew what the chef was trying to accomplish with his tragedy, but if you are unfortunate enough to try this one out for yourself, I can tell you a spoonful of the Sweet Chili sauce straight to the mouth will help in your recovery.

The only reason Gordon Bierch gets 2 stars instead of 1 is entirely due to the micro-brew Pilsner I had, it was admittedly pretty good.

Perhaps the best way to express how utterly disappointing Gordon Bierch is, would be tell you that, after I left, I went down the road to The Yard House in Red Rock where I was treated to two beautiful and savory works of culinary art from their happy-hour menu - at just about the same price.

Being a two star and not a one, I will dare to adventure again to this establishment for its micro-brew - and to give the chef one more chance.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,1,1,2,1bSBGR7kFO_bmysk0Q_Kag

Gordon Biersch has always erected serious barriers to entry to drink their ""pretty good"" beers. Most notably the fact that they eschewed the chance to have either a reasonably priced comfort food brewpub or a justified high-end gastropub and just went with big prices and mediocre food. Regardless the main reason to go here is the beer. It's quite solid.

Unfortunately on my latest visit the waitress requested my ID (I am mid thirties have a beard and grey hair. I do not even remotely resemble a 20 year old. I might be a 45 year old.) and it just so happened I forgot it that day. Did Gordon Biersch employ any common sense? No they did not. Was any effort made to placate me in the least? Nope. Did a manager come over and apologize? Nay.

When I arrived to pickup the food, the bartender who was the take out food gal kept calling me babe.  I do not think it is professional when you call a customer babe.

Another friend had the tempura shrimp and chicken that was good in portion, but lacking in flavor.  I had the equivalent of chicken Marsala.  Portions were small - 3 pieces of chicken slightly bigger than a silver dollar and less than a quarter inch in thickness.  Complimenting the chicken was a scoop of potatoes and another helping of squash.  My dinner was small, lacked flavor and cost $29 - not including beer.  My buds and I were still hungry after 'dinner' so we went to BK to satisfy our hunger.

The menu has a nice extensive beer range with beers on draft and bottle. They also have some great beers that are company brewed. The brown ale they have has a great taste and is highly recommended.

The layout has a great seating area at the rear for groups with the center containing booths and tables for 4. The bar and high top seating complements the front of house with a great patio that can be awesome on a nice warm night.

I have eaten here once before grabbing a GB cheeseburger, as I remember it being  a great tasting burger that was extremely satisfying. The fries that came with the burger were a little dried out and a little tasteless.

4506604,2009-04-01,0,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"It's been a over a decade since I've been to a Gordon Biersch restaurant / brewery. I remember GB as being one of the original regional micro-brewers in the United States.... you could say that GB started the trend towards micro-breweries.... and Garlic Fries.

I really don't remember anything about the Beer or the food at Gordon Biersch... except for the Garlic Fries, mainly because no other restaurant was serving Garlic Fries. The decor of the restaurant has not changed one iota. Restaurant tables and chairs stained in Euro medium-dark hues. Booths with back-to-back bench seating, with open sides. Hanging cylindrical-tube transluscent lamps that reminded me of Kona Grill lamps in color. Seems as if GB had not hired an Interior Decorator in a decade or so.

On the menu yesterday...

Weekly Burger Special (*** 1/2 $10.50) An item which changes weekly... This week's Burger was a half pound Burger inside a buttered Hamburger Bun with Peppercorn Cheese and an Aioli Mayo Spread. The Bun could have been a little stiffer, but the Beef Pattie was fried just right - Medium... you can't get it any rawer, something about local Health regulatioins. But, the Aioli was too liquidy. Came with a side of Garlic Fries (*** 1/2) ... you know you have to have some Garlic Fries when you dine at Gordon Biersch. Fries were slightly over-fried... but you definitely had Garlic and Parsley all over the Fries.

Sampler Beer Shots (*** $5.50) Six  3oz Shots of Gordon Biersch's ""Famous Handcrafted Beers!""... lined up on a paper place mat... each shot glass is placed on it's proper circular trademark with a brief description of each Beer below that for your reading pleasure. Just a li'l teaser for your drinking pleasure. Consisted of the following yesterday...
   Golden Export (** 1/2) A smooth, refreshing lager, lightly hopped with a 
      dry finish. The demand was so high when it was first brewed in the 
      1870s that it was ""exported"" to other regions in Germany. Not bad.... 
      but light, kinda weak.
   Hefeweizen (* 1/2) A German-style wheat beer that is crisp and 
      refreshing. This light and sparkling Beer is known for it's signature 
      aroma that suggests Cloves and Bananas. Suggests! The Beer 
      shouts to the High Heavens of Cloves! Not my favorite... by a long 
      shot.
   Czech Pilsner (****) A Bohemian-style Pilsner, golden hued, medium 
      bodied, accented with the spicy hop character of the signature Saaz 
      hops, imported from the Czech Republic.
   Marzen (*** 1/2) A smooth, medium-bodied, auburn lager. Märzen 
      means ""March"" in German; it was named from the Bavarian tradition 
      that it is brewed during the month of March and stored in caves to be 
      consumed in warmer weather. It is a medium-hopped lager with a 
      mildly sweet nish.
   Schwarzbier (*) This lager's name literally means ""black beer"" in 
      German and although the color may traditionally suggest a heavier 
      body, ours boasts a light body with a chocolate nish. The Schwarzbier 
      has won a gold medal at the 2006 World Beer Cup and a gold medal 
      at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival. A wanna-be Guiness that 
      does not succeed.
   Seasonal Beer Selection (*** 1/2) Dunkelweizen is a seasonal beer, 
      brewed from March to June. ""It's all about the malted wheat and yeast 
      in this beer,"" Gordon says. The roasted malt offsets some of the 
      banana, citrus and clove flavors, producing a sweet, rich and slightly 
      spicy brew that is both refreshing and nuanced. Before bottling, 
      Gordon Biersch's Weizens undergo five to six weeks of aging, which 
      intensifies the flavor and enhances the beers' unsurpassed 
      smoothness. Most other breweries do not exhibit such patience 
      when brewing wheat beers.  Not as dark as the Schwarzbier... one 
      drink and you're Sold.

I like that the patio is open seating and you can sit wherever you like. I never have a wait time when I go to this restaurant (even on Mother's Day!). 

Their pet policy is that dogs are welcome as long as they don't cause a problem. My dog is very relaxed, so I'm lucky, but they go above and beyond to make even his experience pleasant. He gets his plastic cup of water and the passer-by's stop to tell him how cute he is and pet him as he sits on the ledge of the patio. 

It really is the perfect spot for a weekly Happy Hour where you can relax and enjoy the Vegas weather. 

The San Francisco lemonade mixed drink is phenomenal but he sangria martini had WAYY too much sour.  Typically their drinks are spot on and I'm always a fan of the $5 mixed drink specials.

As for appetizers, the baja tacos (in fish or steak) are super good and I get them every time I'm there. Occasionally, I'll get another appetizer dish and so far the only appetizer I was unhappy with were the potstickers.

They have AWESOME happy hour specials that run from 5-7 and then again 9-closing which was 1am but the manager was trying to push us out at 12.  The waitress said at 11:45 it was last call.  Now I know I haven't lived in this city for awhile but last I checked there is no such thing as ""last call"" in Las Vegas.   

Either way we got several of the late night specials on the happy hour menu.  The house made chips w/blue cheese were so good I swear if I wasn't with 4 other people I may have licked the plate just sayin....

We also got the egg rolls and chicken wings they were good but probably wouldn't order again.  After those chips everything was compared to them though and they alone are worth the trip.  The artichoke hearts were delicious as well.  The beer we got was the Heifenweizer which is the first time I had their version of it.  It was very different, good but a taste I could not put my finger on.  
 
I think if your going to Gordon Biersch I would go to the one near downtown that one just has more going on and I don't think they close and have that foreign words I heard in Las Vegas 'last call'.",RNnDlxkfTQMoXSthFirg7Q,0,0,3,DNPZ3xQ120J0kjyLOYI4bQ

We were there for a friend's birthday party. The waitstaff (our waiter in particular) was positively the best I've ever experienced - bar none. Yes, I'm actually gushing. One guy to take care of our party of 10+ and he didn't miss a beat, didn't drop an order, kept us hydrated, and even joked with the kids. He and several others brought in the cake (that we brought from Costco), lit candles and led us in singing. He helped serve it, and even packaged it when we had more than half left over (we told them to share as much as they wanted with the staff).

Plus, the food - OMG! I shared an ahi appetizer, which led to me getting the lobster bisque (holy handbaskets, I died and went to heaven), then ordering the seared tuna dinner. The prices are not as high as you'd expect for this level of cuisine.

* Pint of Maibock ($3)

* Crispy Artichoke Hearts ""topped with Parmesan and lemon aioli"" ($5) - Yummy stuff, especially because you just don't see deep fried artichoke hearts everywhere.  Decent size too!

Gordon Birsch at this location is located in the beautiful Summerlin area, in the busy and classy Boca Park Plaza, where there are many other well-known restaurants. So, parking could be difficult at times. But there is valet parking just a few yards across the front door. It is definitely worth the effort getting there to enjoy your happy hour!

Like its beautiful, huge, sister establishment near the strip, this GB has the identical, famous Happy Hours (that runs 2X a day, 3-7pm and 9pm-closing!) with great German beers and tasty dishes starting at $5, and a fantatic staff who are efficient and exceptionally friendly!

Unlike its sister establishment, GB in Summelin has a very cozy bar counter, and only a few booths and bar tables, but it does have a charming patio (- heated with torches in the winter; cooled with mists in the hot summer)! Its serving crew is incredibly friendly and smart. Most of them recognize repeat customers and could even address them by name at times - making one feel like being in that Bar in the old TV series, ""Cheers"" (-OK, so I am old and nostalgic!)

- It's a great place to unwind and watch sports over a couple drinks, especially their vast selection of tasty German style beers!

By the way, please note that their ""Seasonal Beers, which are NOT listed on the regular drinks menu, could have an usually higher alcohol content, so be sure to ask the barkeep of their alcohol contents, just in case you don't be OVERLY happy by surprise!

We ordered

Mojitos- The BF wasnt very heavy on the alcohol on his classic, though my pomegranate elderflower had a good amount. 

Asian Trio- The eggrolls were okay, but a bit greasy. The shrimp was coated in a breading, but it wasn't crispy and they were room temperature when they got to the table. The potstickers were a weird consistency with a gumminess on the inside of the wrapper and the outside was fried yet it didn't give it any crispness...I can only tell it's fried by the bubbles created by oil on the wrapper but it wasn't left long enough to even get a golden color. It just all tasted and felt texturally like it was microwaved food. WTF?  

Hawaiian mini pizza- this was just alright, but it came hot and tasted like it was cooked and not microwaved. 

The service was friendly and attentive so nothing wrong with the service, but the food was just sad that it doesn't really make up for it. Kudos to our server for being really good at their job! The two stars are for them and zero for the food. 

I don't know how ""off"" of a day it was or if the cooks didn't care because it's late and they just want to leave...no matter-its still the job you signed up for.

My friend and I shared one of their $11 combos. We got the one with 3 Kobe sliders, shredded BBQ pork sliders, and garlic fries.

I have to agree their garlic fries are delicious- onoliscious!!! I'm picky about my fries, and these were soft yet a bit crispy, garlic and parsley? that stuck to the fries. I hate it when the flavoring is dry and sticks to the bottom of the basket rather than the fries. 

The sliders were good, not the best I've had but they were pretty good. 

For us, we can usually eat a lot but we got full off of sharing this combo.

There were three shrimp cut in half and a light sprinkling of thinly shredded crab meat. My friend's Kobe beef burger (13.95) was good. The meat was juicy and tender. The burger comes with the basic garnish so that it does not detract from the taste of the meat. Paired with the garlic fries, it is a fine meal.

More often than not it was to relax on a Friday after a completing a long and strenuous week of formatting excel spreadsheets.  Their happy hour is good for beer.   There are several ""speciality"" cocktails which are available as happy hour specials but they are mostly very sweet, fruit based concoctions.  I'd much prefer to be able to just get a $5 jack and coke, but that's just me.   None of the happy hour food offerings are exactly groundbreaking fare, but most of it is tasty and a steal at the happy hour prices.  The best of those options to me are the Southwest Combo which comes with Pork sliders, southwest egg rolls and the famous garlic fries.  Also the tapas for $5 are a steal for the flatbread with hummus and some other dips/toppings.  None of the mediterranean restaurants around town should be shaking in their boots over the quality of this plate, but it was certainly better than I expected it to be when I ordered it.   

I've also been a few times for lunch, and the last time I went I tried the Moroccan salmon entree.   The salmon was well cooked and I really enjoyed the spices used in the preparation of it.   I tend to prefer my salmon to not be smothered in a lot of sauce or spices that mask the flavor of the fish itself, and this version pleased me in that respect.   I don't remember the price point but I did think it was maybe a few dollars too expensive especially during lunch (it wasn't on any special lunch menu), but ultimately it was worth it.

What sets this location of a chain that specializes in 3 star food IMO is the service.  95% of the time I've gone the service has been excellent.   Drinks are refilled quickly, and the waitresses are very friendly even when we're being loud and obnoxious after our 4th round of beers and asking for the channel to be changed on one of the many TVs around the bar area showing various sports.

If you ever grave garlic fries, come here.",yv9jvt_58q9ZQzl9i8xUmw,0,0,5,Srgotnzh4Va-4zXGcn90cQ

I got my Mediterranean Chicken from the light menu so I was expecting something small, but it was decent and I was still left feeling satisfied.  The staff was very friendly and I noticed they all really work together to serve their customers. The gentleman who was helping us out knew his beer and was able to tell us the types of flavors to expect from each.  We got the beer sampler, so since this guy knew his product he suggested the order in which to drink them - and he was on point.

This place is great for lunch with family, small business meetings, or early evening drinks with friends.",59yalGU6Srsgv3-AYL--OQ,0,0,4,YMQKiUHRKlNYgJ_OurE2Rg
5506317,2015-07-30,2,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"Worst service ever. The waitress took my drink for a refill and literally never brought it back. When I asked her about it she admitted that she ""totally forgot"" and accused me of trying to complain to get a free dessert. Um, no, I just wanted the drink that I ordered. 

I ordered my salad with dressing on the side. When the salad arrived it was completely drenched in dressing. When I asked the waitress about this, she glared at me, then she snatched the salad and took off stomping toward the kitchen.

My mom ordered the veggie burger, which was completely inedible. It was not cooked all the way through, and it was like someone had just slathered refried beans onto a bun. Also, it was frozen in the middle. 

My mom asked the waitress if they could cook her burger, which was clearly frozen in the middle. That's when the waitress really lost it. She started screaming at me, waving her arms in the air, yelling, ""This is a restaurant. I'm going to get my chef so you can tell him to his face!"" I tried to deescalate the situation, telling her that wasn't necessary, when she lost it at me, yelling, ""THIS IS A RESTAURANT!!!"" Then, she tried to stare me down as she stomped back towards the kitchen. 

K, she clearly wanted us to know that we were in a restaurant. In my experience, a restaurant should be able to 1) refill drinks, 2) not accuse customers of trying to get free dessert because you ""totally forgot"" their drink refill, 3) accommodate simple requests like dressing on the side, 4) not serve frozen burgers, and 5) not scream and yell and customers who ask you for basic service. All of those things can ultimately be forgiven, but yelling at customers and trying to stare them down is not acceptable.

I like when restaurants are broken up into smaller spaces, like this one is. There's a raised section with booths, a bar with a flat screen TV, and a back area with a glassed in section with wi-fi (you have to pay to use that space).   Nice wood floors help create a warm atmosphere.

The meal I had was pretty good but nothing special: fish and fries. However, the garlic fries were definitely tasty.  The service was good, the prices all right. Bottom line: I'd come again and I'd recommend it to friends for an enjoyable time.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,0,0,3,AqVMr3Z5mqahZJtdxwF-fw
5540560,2013-07-31,0,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"GLUTEN FREE AT GB

Having a gluten and grain allergy, it is difficult to find a restaurant where I can eat and not get sick. Today, my husband and I had an awesome lunch at Gordon Biersch without me having any symptoms of cross contamination (which trust me, I feel immediately).  I was hesitant to even try this place as they didn't have a dedicated gluten free menu; however, when we walked in the manager-- Matt-- was very knowledgeable about gluten and assured me he could help me find things on the menu.  After Matt sat us, he spent time comparing an allergy menu to the regular menu.  He was awesomely patient going through ingredients, etc.  I decided on a caesar salad with  warm grilled chicken.  After he took our orders and explained them to our waitress, he went back to the kitchen to make sure the staff understood the precautions.  My husband had a salad too, and although his was not gluten free he said it was equally as fresh and delicious.  When we had finished our meal, Matt even came back to check on us and make sure everything was okay.  I highly recommend GB on Rampart whether you have a food allergy or not!  Their attention to detail and obvious care for customers was admirable.

ADDENDUM:

My husband and I went back to GB last evening, and the evening crew definitely didn't have gluten knowledge down like the servers/manager (Matt) from the day crew.  The waitress thought gluten was in oil (???), and she told me that the entire meal I ate the day before was ""definitely not gluten free!""  For a split second I hoped for a gluten miracle; had I been cured of my celiac?...Very doubtful, and  so when I heard that comment, I asked for the manager, Amanda, to help.  While Amanda was very nice and totally willing to assist, I had to prompt her to get allergen book that Manager Matt had shown us the day before in helping me to find gluten/wheat free food.  Amanda admitted she was not totally aware of allergens, which I found odd for a manager of a restaurant who also admitted that there are ""so many gluten allergies these days.""  We went through the allergen book and I ordered the exact same thing I had the day before--caesar salad with  warm grilled chicken. I asked her to instruct the kitchen to change gloves, use new bowls, etc. to avoid cross contamination (something that Manager Matt brought up before I could).  By that time, the waitress was totally into this and she monitored the kitchen to make sure those directions were followed....And, I lived.  

Moral of the story: If you have an allergy to anything, you still have to be a self advocate.  At  least at GB, you can ask for the allergen book, figure it out yourself, and survive to write about it the next day.",WXcgiCSjDR-ucpP1bK6XKA,1,0,5,YVQVZsmmnb8xP1JeYILNvw

I had a delicious burger with a beer and my wife had a chicken dish.  We also shared a calimari appetizer before we got our main courses.  The venue was stylishly decorated and the food was very succulent.  The only drawback was a slightly messy table when we first came in (just a few crumbs) and also the waiters seemed to take a long time for a slow night.  The place was partially filled so unless the crew was vastly understaffed there would be no reason for the food/extra orders to take so long.  So for those minor reasons they get 4/5 stars.

5753125,2014-08-27,1,iPM85PQMs7QoAxw-Og9ChQ,"It's been a long time since I visited Gordon Biersch.  I remember when the first one opened on Paradise, and it was the place to be for the trendy.  That was a long time ago, and now this chain is just another take on the likes of Yard House, Chicago Brewing and such.  What I remember from my last visit at a San Diego branch was that the food was very good, beer was good, and atmosphere was great.  My latest visit to the Boca Park location results in a bit of a downgrade in food and chic factor, but otherwise still quite satisfying.

We met up with my friend and his wife, and were really looking forward to their restaurant week deal - $40 for a 3 course.  Alas, that was only for the Paradise location... why is that?  So only mildly disappointed (since we figured we'd probably spend less money now), we proceed to order a couple of apps - calamari and blue crab artichoke dip - and entrees.  Seafood Cobb Salad, Lobster & Shrimp Mac 'n Cheese for me, Fish & Chips, and Cajun Fish tacos.  The calamari was very good, rightly crisped coating with perfect taste, albeit the calamari weren't exactly plump.  The artichoke dip was disappointing, as it tasted too sour cream-y and the crab flavor got lost in it.  I couldn't tell if there were  actual crabs in it or not.  And I think it would have been better with tortilla chips rather than bread.

I had the Mac 'n Cheese because the mix of it with lobster & shrimp sounded interesting.  What I got wasn't exactly Mac 'n Cheese though, it was Bowtie 'n Cheese as the pasta was not macaroni pasta.  Loses the effect a bit, but it tasted like a mac n' cheese so they're forgiven.  As for the taste, it tasted like typical mac, but the addition of the seafood definitely was for the better.  Ample chunks of lobster and shrimp went quite well with the cheese and pasta mix.  A dash of truffle oil would have put it out of the park, I think.  Also tried the fish n chips, and while appropriately crispy and tasted fine, I would have preferred a more traditional batter than the more panko crust-like one they use.  Didn't try the cobb but it was humongous, and the tacos were huge also (you get two).  

The server was very pleasant throughout, but committed one no-no.  Towards the end of the meal she came by and dropped off the check, letting us know her shift was over and we need to settle.  I think this is a very bad practice, one that breaks up the rhythm and flow of the dinner for the patrons.  Why can't they let the next shift ""take over"" and settle the check instead when the customers are ready?  They were may be a quarter full, and don't they all share the tips anyway?  Still, not to detract from otherwise great service that deserves 4-stars in the end.  

Four beers, couple glasses of wine, and it all came to $125 before tips.  Not bad, but I tend to think it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  Beer price is very reasonable though, at $3.75 a pint for the home brews.  Will likely revisit, but probably more for happy hour or apps and drinks, rather than for dinner.  All-in-all it's marginally 3.5 stars for food, and decidedly 3.5 stars overall.  This place may be the epitome of why Yelp should grant 1/2 stars.

Food-for-1 Factor:  Well, a big bar up front but the air in the place doesn't necessarily put single diners at ease.  May be a bit too social inside for eating/drinking by your lonesome...",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,1,1,3,5dQhS8rr44_5olb5JQ_6VQ

Our party of 3 sat on the patio for Happy Hour. Our server was rushed and very rude. She didn't apply my free beer coupon until we went inside to find a manager. There was none in sight, but she came over to us and fixed it after we asked twice. I gave her the coupon when I ordered the beer. 
She practically threw the checks down and only came back once for refills. When I asked for one, she said, I was told earlier you all were fine. WTF???
The beer is great, and my happy hour pizza was very good.

That was before the economy tanked, and we had been spoiled by Kona Grill's HH offerings, which lamentably are now a ghost of its past glory (Bring back that Goat Cheese Pizza!!!).  Gordon just couldn't compare, so we never went back, that is, until we were invited for one of those ""Listen to Our Spiel and We'll Serve You Dinner"" events, held in the small private room wayyy in the back of the restaurant, even past the rest rooms.  Out the back door and we'd be on Lake Mead Blvd.

We had a choice of three items, preceded by a small Caesar salad:  Pasta Marinara, Chicken Teriyaki & Shrimp Tempura, and Chicken in Marzen sauce.  I ordered the chicken, having no idea what Marzen sauce was supposed to be - with an umlaut, no less - but I wasn't as smart as a friend of ours, who ordered it without any of the sauce, because that turned out to be a heavy, gloppy, pinkish concoction with mushrooms.  Hubby ordered the same thing.  It was served with garlic mashed and some soggy vegetables.

I realize that this dinner may not have been entirely representative of GB's usual fare, but it should be an enticement to get the patrons trapped for two full hours before a morsel of food was served (definitely NOT Gordon Biersch's doing, I'm sure) to want to come back and order from the regular menu.

They have a blue cheeseburger!! It was a Kobe blue cheeseburger I might add! It was called the Kobe Black & Blue and so my decision was made right then and there! I paired it was the seasonal brew, but I cannot remember what it's called! It was the strong ale. Anywho, the burger came with a knife shoved right in the middle! It was pretty funny. Nevertheless, I pulled it out and proceeded to eat the burger as delivered and not cut down into little lady like pieces. It was a nice thick patty that was relatively juicy. All in all it was a good burger. I just wish it had MORE blue cheese. In my book, you can really never have too much. My dining partner had the Kobe cheeseburger with a fried egg. Is that a Vegas thing? I've never seen soo many fried eggs on burgers before! HAHA! Anyways, good dining experience, but I **THINK** the Kobe burgers are a test out. I don't know if they are on the permanent GB menu (just my instinct, no one actually said this). I've never seen them on the menu before. I do believe the search continues!
