I'm a adult here lower ur voice 5 levels so I can understand what ur problem is. She definitely needs customer service classes. I dont respond well to a person yelling at me because they dont like the way I am walking. Talk to me like you have some sense and we will get somewhere.,18Z9fXpECItLufEO1r26fw,0,0,1,bAyhhIccwK7A0DOQ4nizTA

So this location has something I haven't seen at any of my local starbucks in Las vegas... a Zombie Frapachino. As soon as I saw the sign I had to try it. 

It seemed like my barista had never tried it before because she had to reference the barista making drinks to ask what it tasted like. Carmel apple I was told, sold!

Once it arrived it looked really cool, but slightly different than the creative image thwy have as advertising lol. None the less it does taste lile a Carmel apple and I love it!!",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,5,3,4,aDzB9GmugbTFTlFw5ixHVw

3163764,2018-06-20,0,s7WZTJQxs5MR9HSHQyg7rw,"Fairly decent airport. My Uber dropped me off in front. They have one security check point which is a mess. The TSA staff here didn't care to move fast or try to be efficient. In many other airports I fly out of, security has gotten much better throughout the years. Once through security you have to walk to your gate area or take a tram. Free WiFi that works some of the time depending where you are. 

Post security there are many food, drink, bars, and coffee shop options. I was able to find a decent breakfast for under $10 or for $15 I got a full breakfast. 

Cons: The Uber pick up experience is terrible. Unlike many other airports you don't get your Uber from the arrival (drop off area). There are also no signs when you land telling you where to Uber pick up area is. Only when I asked did they tell me that I had to take a tram. Then snake my way around to a parking garage, then go to the 5th floor to see the Uber pick up area. 

Limited charging by the gate area.",wzjQSt7pxb1LMHqTm8u7pg,0,0,3,CzxCukwteTQn79_hi9LUVw

Granted it was 5 in the morning when we were there, but there was no reason to snap at people and roll eyes.  Definitely on a power trip.  We overhead numerous people on the tram to the gate that they've never seen such rude staff before.  Other then that, the airport is fine.  Flight was on time and the airport is easy to get around.  At least I'm prepared for next time.  I'll remember it's ok to be a bitch at the airport because it'll help me fit right in.",YU30Ivfe-MPbg3gQcSfIpw,0,1,2,dH550I5KXlcnZH1r2Hs0mA

Slot machines - between the D gates

Walk toward the check in area --

Center of hallway
Starbucks - nearest the D gates

Left
Chili's
Hudson News
Welcome to LV store

Right
Red Mango
Metro Pizza
Restrooms

Center of hallway
Quiznos Sub - farthest from the D gates

Flies to/from this gate:
Hawaiian Air - right of D gate area
Delta - left and far gate area of D gate

It's nice, mildly air conditioned (it's August 2017), the floors are shiny and clean, chairs are leather looking and a cluster of them at each gate. There are TV monitors above the seating areas. There's a Rolex clock on the left facing the end of the terminal in the casino area just where the gate seating begins. Trash and recycle bins are at the walkway area just outside each gate seating area. Huge windows give you views of the airport and this Nevada, LV area.

Not too loud. There are charging stations on the right, Hawaiian Air side.

Loud speakers kinda loud enough to hear the boarding callls and not miss your flight.

Restrooms are clean and have lots of stalls but the doors open inward so it's a tight squeeze with not much room for you and your carry on to get in and out easily. Thankfully there's a heavy duty hook on the door. At the sinks, there is no counter or ledge to put your belongings. Papertowels are available.

There's a belt ppl mover heading to/from the check in area with more shops at the beginning of it:

LEFT
Brooks Brothers - fine men's shirts & women's clothing
TUMI - luggage backpacks
Hudson booksfore - sundries books
Tags - rhinestone glittery bags and accessories

The airport is clean and well laid out for such a large airport.  They have quick busses to the rental car center and taxis organized just outside of the baggage claim.

Where to start...all Ride Share in one location in the parking garage. Get your ride just before getting out there and they will tell you what stall to go to. Gambling everywhere! TSA can be long but moves quickly. Food, choices are average having choices like Burger King, and Port-for-sub. Terminal 3 has better choices, so if you have time, take the train to the D gates. The C gates choices are ok too. Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Pei Wei., (is that the spelling??) not my favorite airport, but not the worst. Don't forget to pick up some Ethel M chocolate, yummy!
