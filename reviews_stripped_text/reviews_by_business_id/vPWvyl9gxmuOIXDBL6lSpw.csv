349132,2013-12-18,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"Came in at around 8pm on a weekday. There were plenty of tables despite the many conferences in the area (not a good sign). Menu was similar to Morton's restaurants, and the first feel I had was that they may be emphasizing their bar - its the only place that had more lights around it. The dining area is as dark as the bar counter area, minus the lights so it felt as if I was eating at a bar table - albeit with real comfy seats. I like the darkened environment after a long day, so its not bad for me, but it is darker than most dining establishments.

The steak came out pretty good. I asked for my standard bone-in Chicago cut medium rare ribeye, which was crispy on the outside and red in the center, as good as any you get at Morton's. (A brief comparison, at 22oz, it was thicker than the one they serve at Morton's). The crispiness was good, though I may have been overcooked a little (due to its large size) because it was a bit more medium at the sides.

My server was very friendly but given the number of people in the restaurant, I thought service was a tad slow. I waited almost half a steak (i.e. i ate half my steak) for my water to be refilled, and it took forever for the steak and check to arrive. I blame it on the slow weekday they were having since its probably reduced staff. Again, not everyone minds, but I wanted to get out of there quickly, so I felt the wait (again, there's no one there, so I don't get why I had to wait so long.)

Nevertheless, I got a great steak at a pretty normal high-quality steakhouse price. Not too exhorbitant (there are a lot of pretty expensive places with not so high-quality stuff around this restaurant, diners beware!)

4* because there are areas to improve on and it doesn't really stand out from the Morton's chain. Unless you're love eating steak in a bar-like environment (which I don't)",NmP1UO0jEW58cokDktafTg,0,0,4,Etdgwlc39CwEpCoqjxJ7SA
512823,2013-03-11,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"Having lived in New York City, high priced steaks are not a new thing for us. Once a year, we do a big expensive meal for either Christmas or our anniversary, and we've dined at Morton's, Smith & Wollensky, Ruth Chris, Peter Luger's, Bobby Flay's Bar Americain and Mesa Grill, and Del Frisco, to name a few places. We were told about this place by my husband's friend/business colleague and so on our first trip to Vegas, we went.

I'm a red meat lover and this was one of the BEST steaks I've had. Ever. (See above for frame of reference). 

As a starter, we split the pear & saga salad, and I'm generally not a fan of fruits in my salad, but my husband loves pears, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I'm glad I did, the dressing was nice and not overwhelming, though I do wish there was a little extra bleu cheese on the salad.

I ordered the 8-oz strip steak medium rare and it came out closer to rare, but really, it was rare perfection. My husband got the 8-oz ribeye with shrimp, and he also was very pleased. As a side, we ordered the creamed corn, which I thought was fine (nothing exciting) but really, you go to a steakhouse for steak.

The cocktails were strong as well. I got a lavender lemontini, and while there wasn't a lot of lavender, there was a lot of bite - as in alcohol. 

In a rare move, we ordered dessert (we're usually full by the time we're done but were explicitly instructed by our friend to leave room). We got the peanut butter and jelly, which was a peanut butter and chocolate mousse cake with a concord jelly mousse to the side. It was different and creamy and delicious. I think if I came for straight up dessert, I'd have given the popcorn milkshake a try.

The service was quite good, our server, Quinn, was attentive without hovering, and the busboys also appropriately obsequious. Quinn also made recommendations for us, this being our first time in Vegas, and it was nice to hear opinions on shows we were considering, and other activities as well.

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN HERE. While dining. to the side, there was a family and they had three girls, ranging from about 5 to 10, and one girl loudly said, ""Mom, SHE DOESN'T HAVE CLOTHING ON."" (There are dancers wearing lingerie). There are better and more family appropriate places to expose your children to fine dining. This restaurant is DEFINITELY NOT ONE OF THEM. This is great for a guys' dinner out, a business dinner (there were two groups of investment bankers here), a date, but not a family with children of grade school to middle school age.",7KHUOHOWQqNqPogI-ZUlpw,2,0,5,bsUbTqvoF5FLY8C43s3acg

Our server was polite, knowledgable about the menu and solid throughout our meal, but the timing of everything was really bad. Our bread came out after the meal was served, the wine I ordered to pair with my waygu was served 5 minutes after my steak, my friends medium steak was served closer to blue and my wine had a ton a of sediment at the bottom of it. When your spending $200 on a meal you expect things to be a little bit tighter... When I got the bill I was a bit frustrated both the wine and the full price of our entrees were on there. I kindly asked the server to remove the wine which he did.

One thing that really did impress me is the server walked past and saw the way my friends steak was prepared, he immediately offered to take it back and give us an additional side of foie gras butter.

Overall if your able to spend the additional $30-50 per person I strongly suggest going to Mastro's.",C2YRjTezIGFYVO0JZoA-fA,2,0,3,sBaJfkYoxq7KhmrIWSb53A

My husband and I went to She on our last night in Vegas. First week of December 2013. 
We stayed at the Aria and they gave us a $100 gift card ( because my husband had a birthday that week) to spend at the Crystals shops or restaurants. We choose to go to She and were extremely pleasantly surprised!
We were seated right away when we arrived. 8:30pm reservation. Place was not very busy, but it didn't matter to us. I heard ""She"" is getting bad reviews now because they no longer have the dancers that apparently drew the crowds. 
Out server was Andrew. Very knowledgable and attentive. Now, I am a vegan. My husband eats meat, so he ordered the special for that night - steak and lobster tail, and he had a peanut Butter dessert - he loved it!! Well, here is me telling Andrew I'm a vegan and asking him what could the chef alter and tweak off the menu to suit a vegan!! Let me tell you, my message was well delivered to the chefs and my meal was delicious. I ordered a mixed salad which was a good size, not tiny at all. I like to eat!! For my main course they made me steam vegetables accompanied by 5 different sauces, beautifully sliced avocado and amazingly tasty gnocchi!!! The gnocchis are to die for. The steamed vegetables came in a huge oval plate - a pretty big portion for one person. I didn't really eat desert since I ate all my veggies... :)
The icing on the cake was when chef Erick came to our table to have a chat!!! It was perfect because I got to thank him personally for catering to my ""vegan"" needs!! I really appreciated it!

All in all, my husband and I really enjoyed our time there! You will, too!!",KSQNuZYhMPgkeaXepaT5Mw,3,0,5,ZERXB9Ru9nZfgiEPvnycpg

1650115,2013-02-16,5,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"Easy 5 stars. Wow!!!! I have eaten at many high tier restaurants and I have to stay my most enjoyable dish has been at SHe by Morton's. They are located next to Crystals inside of City Center. We valet, walked through double doors to the right, made a left to the elevators to 2nd floor and the restaurant was to the immediate right outside of the elevators.

  He made reservations for our Valentines Day dinner (cliche, blah blah blah, I don't care) for 7pm. We arrived a bit early, but the hostess seated us immediately. Shortly after out waiter came by, introduced himself and gave us menus. When he brought back the waters he took our drink order.

We started off with a couple of drinks. I had Lavender Lemontini x 2 (delicious!) $15 and boyfriend had a glass of their Zinfandel. ($14) 

 Shortly after getting our drinks they brought four rolls of bread with cinnamon butter. The bread was soft and worked amazingly with the butter that melted right into the bread. Our server came back shortly after to take our appetizer  order. We opted for LITTLE BIG ROYALE'S $19 which were two mini burgers  with house made sauce toasted bun and cheddar. Those very HEAVENLY.  After our entree order was taken there was a slight wait for the food, but let me tell you...it WAS SO WORTH IT!  The waiter did check in letting us know approximate time of when we will be getting our food. We never felt abandoned. I had Pan Seared Salmon ($32) with jumbo lump crab  and lentils tomato buerre fondue. After the first bite my first reaction was ""what is this witchcraft?!!"". It was THAT good. The glaze was incredible and the fish cooked to perfection. The lentils worked amazingly with the texture of the fish. Boyfriend opted for Seared Seabass ($38) with miso glaze and haricot verts.  The fish was cooked very well, but the complexity of taste did not hold a candle to my salmon.  We also ordered a side of creamed corn ($11) to share and we finished it all. It was very good. 

After our food was delivered the waiter said ""I am going to leave you two alone for now so that you can enjoy your romantic meal."" I really appreciated that. They stopped by to refill drinks when getting to the halfway point, and when we assured him everything tastes great, he gave us our space. When on a romantic date with my honey, I really appreciate the intimate conversation without constant interruption. Also, I don't need someone bowing down to me constantly which is what some prima donnas seem to expect.

The interior was very trendy and upscale while maintaining the classy vibe. They had some performers, but one was wearing some long 50s Mrs. Santa Claus looking dress. The other was dressed a bit more sexy and performed some great moves.

1716443,2014-05-31,8,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"I just had to give this place one star because, like the rest of you, I have never wanted to eat steak while watching scantily clad women ditz around wearing cheap rhinestones and feathers while receiving paychecks from Eva Longoria, the star of ""Over Her Dead Body"" who got famous after being cheated on by a French basketball player. 

Normally it's quite difficult for me to go into a ""steak"" house because I am a female. It's much, much easier for me when a point is made of my gender. I require the presence of other friendly, attractive females encouraging me to ""eat meat"" and ""order side dishes"" and ""martinis."" And speaking of martinis--which normally I feel very uncomfortable around because they are full of complicated flavors like ""gin"" or ""vermouth"" or weird salty round things (olives or something maybe?)--this restaurant lovingly creates specially-flavored martinis for people with vaginas.

Wow, what happened,??? I gave SHe a 5-star rating back in Jan. but when I returned last week things were VERY different. The place was nearly empty, there were no more ""entertainers""  and no more DJ performing in the dining room. Now SHe is just another steakhouse on the strip no different than the dozen plus other steakhouses within a mile or two radius of SHe. Food was still good but definately nothing to draw me back ever again. When I asked about the entertainers they said they were ""going a different direction""....makes no sense to me, the entertainers were the draw.

After planning the travel & hotel, $1000 later- we decided to try this new restaurant. WHAT A MISTAKE!

We were literally in our room for the entire day- we tried to go to the lunch and my husband's eyes were watering and he was gagging at the table and running back and forth to the bathroom throwing up!!! My friend lives in LV, so when she tried meeting us for lunch, she thankfully drove us back to the hotel and had to stop on the side of the road so my husband can puke in a bush! THEN when we got back up to the room, more vomitting, more diarrhea. AWFUL! This lasted all day! We were leaving the next morning, so needless to say, we didn't get to do much in LV. We know it was this restaurant because we drove all day Friday, just to get to LV from CA, and we had Wendy's french fries, so you do the math!!!

We were SO excited for this restaurant, what a disappointment. Not to mention the food is gross even before my husband got sick. Hard, rolls with salt on top (seems like they were frozen) I got the chicken and it had not one drop of salt or pepper and it had a salty gravy on the side (disgusting) And burnt to a CRISP brussel sprouts ($28) and my husband got the spare ribs, EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

Prior to starting my vacation, I read reviews and menus of many of the steakhouses on the Strip. My first choice was Gordon Ramsays, but it was booked up for the next five days. Since I was staying at Vdara, I wanted something close as my friends and I were going downtown after dinner. 

We arrived at 7:30 on Thursday night - yes, two days ago :D we were seated immediately and decided on  food! The atmosphere was pretty cool, I'm 32 and quiet steakhouses and piano music aren't my thing! My other two friends are around my age also. We read that there are dancers, but not on the night I want. Maybe it's a Friday night only thing? Anyhow, our server, Jamie, was great. 

I ended up ordering the 12oz center cut - cooked medium with roasted carrots and purée potatoes. Also, they have Jordan Cabernet on the wine list and I was super excited to score a glass of it with my dinner. Our server promptly served the Cab when the steak came out as I requested and the steak was awesome!  After finishing dinner, the dessert menu was brought out and the popcorn infused milkshake immediately caught my eye, from there, it was game on! The vanilla milkshake is excellent and adding the caramel popcorn is the icing on the proverbial cake.

Reservations were easy to make.. The actual private party contact person was a bit rude and unhelpful when I initially called.. But I was able to talk to the regular dining area contact person and they were great. 

Arrived around 7pm on Saturday night and it wasn't too packed or anything.  We were escorted to this private dining area. Gorgeous room and man, our waiter and bus boy were so friendly.  We had a blast! I ordered their beef short rib and I have never tasted meat so tender and it literally melted in my mouth.  I tried my sister's red snapper bites and the sauce was so dang good.  I'm drooling just thinking about the food haha. 

So in the evening time, I guess they have these entertainers walk this walkway in the main dining area.  I saw this lady do some crazy acrobatic stuff.. Pretty cool.

All in all, we had an awesome time and grubbed on some superb food. The portions were definitely skimpy... Like way small... But it was worth it. 

I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas!",zTYjPC7R-ECiJK7pfPRufA,6,4,5,R4UfVo91uEq2pgrcv7QUaQ

Creamed Corn is delish, the Filet was on point, Sea Bass bites were awesome... the Chopped Salad was one of the best salads I've EVER had (interesting mix of veggies not typically found in chopped salad)... I had a great dinner. However....

(B) Service was... odd. Server rarely checked up on us... didn't explain any menu items, and would just do a plate drop but not introduce the dishes at all... it took a long time to get the meal out due to business demands, but even so, the server should at least check on us and keep us in the loop of the experience...  Bussers and Food Runners were great... however, our guy (Adam), could've done a better job to make us feel special.

The variety acts throughout the evening in the restaurant are a nice distraction to overall wait time... some really talented performers rotate throughout the evening to put on mini performances for restaurant goers... very cool concept!",0smPAWIU2O2Mm3ntjqrYvg,1,2,4,sdubZzj-SiHQAv0nAtlyeA

This place is DAMN GOOD. Let's just get that out of the way right off the bat. Phe-OMNOMNOM-inal. If you desire something delicious and well-crafted to rest upon your palate and tongue for the evening, look no further. I feel like I have to use that kind of language when talking about this smart and very sexy restaurant!

I actually was invited by my dear heart Tetsuro P. to join him on a anti-Valentines Day excursion (considering neither one of us had dates). I picked the place, because, despite how intelligent this dude is, he had no clue how or where to call and make a reservation at! I have not lived here as long, so I wasn't sure at first, but then I remembered reading an article in a magazine about SHe, and thought it would be prefect.

We arrived at Crystals, but accidentally walked right by this place, because it is directly to the right when you walk in from the valet area, and if you are not paying attention, you might miss it. We had a good 30 minutes before our reservation anyway, so it was nice to be able to walk around and work up an appetite.

After getting snubbed at Louis Vuitton, we were over the Crystals Center and just wanted our food. Even though we were about 10-15 mins early, we were taken to our table with the quickness. Nice job, SHe. Impressed already.

As I walked through toward the back, I had to pass by the main stage in the middle of the place. OHHHH YEAH. Hot, half-naked dancing chicks? Yes, please!! I had trouble keeping up with the hostess, because I slowed down and rubbernecked the whole way LOL

They sat us at a large C-shaped booth facing the huge window where we had an excellent view of the fountains outside. So pretty!!

First off, I ordered a glass of Dom Perignon, which I guess they were offering as a ""Valentine's Day Special,"" for $48. Damn. Now I know why that crap is so expensive. It was quite tasty.

They brought us the softest bread and honey butter to nibble on while we tried to make a decision on what to order. And that took a while, because despite not having a large menu, everything looked amazing. After about 20 minutes of trying to make up out minds (our waitress was so sweet, cute, and patient with us), we settled on the Oysters on the Halfshell ($18) as an appetizer. I thought that the oysters were a wee bit small for the price, but still fresh and good. For dinner, we chose the 32 oz Bone in New York for Two ($79) with a side of the Creamed Spinach (which I guess has a fancy cheese mixed into it, making it oh-so-smooth and rich) to go with ($12). 

The steak was seriously the best steak (besides The Hammond in Superior, WI) that I have EVER had. The meat was so rich, and cooked to perfection. And the creamed spinach was a perfect accompaniment.

Because we were already ballin' out at this point, I figured I would order dessert as well. We settled on the SHeSCAKE ($9), which was not like your typical cheesecake, with a heaviness to it. This was light as air, almost like if mousse and pudding made sweet, sweet love to each other and had a delicious baby.

I ordered the 16oz Prime Strip ($49) with the chopped salad large ($16) and the mushrooms ($11) for myself and my gf. It was definitely more than enough food. After ordering we put in some drink orders and literally all the food came and we still had not gotten the drinks. 

After 5 minutes the waiter came to check on us and I asked him where the drinks were he said he forgot to put them in. He didn't even apologize or offer to comp us the drinks for his error.

The ambiance there with the dancers was a Vegas twist on Morton's and is a great concept- I really liked the vibe when I walked in, but when we checked in for our reservation at 8 we were told we could have a seat at the bar and they would let us know when our table was ready.  The restaurant was dead. We waited 20 minutes while they did nothing, then lead us to an open table that had been sitting there empty and seemingly ready the entire time. (The restaurant never got busy while we were there, which on a holiday weekend is probably a bad sign).  However the bright side of our time at the bar is that the martini's were GREAT! The lilac lemontini is a drink to die for.

The service once we sat down was good. But the food was just ok. We had the lobster rolls and crab cakes for apps and they were small and nothing special. The chopped salad was really good and the We portion was more than enough for 3 of us to share. Then we got to the entree... I had the 6oz filet and it was beyond bland. I love filet and have never had one at a steakhouse that I didn't love until now. VERY disappointing from a Morton's restaurant. I didn't finish the 6oz, and not bc I was stuffed, but bc it just wasn't good.  I'd rather spend the calories on another of those delicious martini's! My friend had the short ribs and that was really good- flavorful and tender. 

Overall I think the restaurant is an overpriced, average restaurant trying to sell itself as higher quality using the Morton's name. I wouldn't return to SHe unless it was to sit at the bar for a drink before going somewhere else for dinner, there are just too many much better steakhouses on the strip.",Hw9ZP0LxHtoCa-Q8KrXJAw,0,0,3,1xzd1-bwtX-_2F-qNwzHHw

3813960,2013-03-03,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"To start, we are VIP Wine Locker holders at Morton's San Francisco.  We do hold a very high standard for quality of service, quality of the meal, quality of the experience and the entire atmosphere of the establishment.  SHe breaks the mold of the Morton's chain as an upscale boutique steakhouse with the highroller twist of Las Vegas.  That being said we may have held a biased view of what to expect before we actually began our meal.  We did have what we would consider an almost epic fail experience at the restaurant but we need to clarify, holding an idea that SHe is a part of Morton's is a falsehood.  Don't walk into this establishment with the idea that you'll have the 12-21 atmosphere.  This place is lively and has a great DJ and absolutely stunning ladies who dance throughout the restaurant (epic win for those of us who appreciate this).  The wine list though limited has an impressive array, big cabs that will pair nicely with any steak.  Our service experience though was our epic fail.  We waited for quite a while, 10-12 minutes before service actually began at our table. Yes, we actually time this.  If we do not receive service in the first 15 minutes with first drinks on table we walk.  The menu presentation was rushed and quickly glazed over by our waiter.  The waiter took all of 10 seconds to describe the specials for the night.  This left little time for us to let the idea of trying the specials sink into our heads.  We couldn't  remember what type or size of Kobe it was and really left little desire to ask again about specials.  Needless to say, we did specify a ""special"" steak preparation which a photo was provided and chef approved.  When the meal was delivered, upon tabling, the waiter admitted the steak was not prepared correctly and still served it.  Now the saving grace, the waiter did realize the epic fail and actually without our engagement requested to bring the GM over to discuss our meal and the experience we had.  The GM went above and beyond correcting the situation and more than graciously fixed our bill for the errors, even going so far above and beyond that the GM comped a meal that was exquisitely perfect.  This brings us to quality of the dinner served, bar none, even with the error of overall presentation of the meal, the steak was cooked to precise perfection.  The filet melted in your mouth and the aged seasoning flavors, charred saltiness, was not overpowering to the palette.

3967319,2013-03-16,1,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week menu ***

I didn't know SHe by Morton's existed until I saw it on the Restaurant Week list.  SInce I've eaten at most places in Aria and have yet to try more than Mastro's in Crystals, I put this on my list for restaurant week.

Course 1:  I started with a Caesar salad.  It was quite a large serving.  It had just the right amount of dressing and the croutons were flat pieces of crusty, toasted bread almost like little Melba toast rounds.

Course 2:  I ordered the marinated skirt steak extra rare.  When the steak came out, it was a 6 ounce filet they were substituting.  It had an excellent char and was bright pink rather than being the red it should have been.

Course 3:  For this course, you have a choice of one side.  I chose the wild mushrooms.  They were excellent and there was a large amount.  If two people were dining, two of these sides would be more than enough to share.  It would have been nice if I could have gotten half portions of two sides, but I understand the need for conformity.

Course 4:  I went with the Shesecake.  On their menu, it has this description:  Cream Cheese Bavarian, Champagne Strawberries.  There was a sprig of lavender on the top and some graham cracker crumbles on the side besides the graham crust.  The Shesecake was very, very good.  It was not like any cheesecake I had before.  I'm glad I read Heather's review before I went.  Because she stated the cinnamon twists were blah, I had to go with the Shesecake.

Service was excellent.  Before being taken to your table, your asked to sit at the bar while the table is readied.  It's actually a way of forcing you to buy a drink.  I got a diet Coke and took that to the table with me.  During the meal, my server came around and asked if it was regular or diet.  With 1/3 of a glass to go, he still removed that and gave me a fresh drink.  He then brought me a small plate with sliced lemon wedges for the soda.  

He was around several times.  After each course was delivered, he checked to make sure everything was OK.  The staff was very on top of the restaurant during the time I was there, and they really move.

I almost opted for patio seating, but I decided to eat indoors to see the interior as this was my first visit.  I'm glad I did.  I still had a chance to watch tourists walk by outside the windows, and I had a good view of part of the Aria Hotel.  

I am pleased that SHe by Morton's participated in Restaurant Week and I'll be returning to try some of their seafood offerings.  The menu is tempting!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,2,3,2i6xq8D75_HkqZRulRjCjA

There are catwalk ""stages"" that go throughout the restaurant where scantily clad dancers are entertaining above you while you dine.

So why 3 stars?  Well for one, the hostesses were just a little much for me.  I should have had a reservation, I was standing there when my Host made me the reservation on the phone before we left the Hotel, but they claimed to not have received the call.  Regardless, there were clearly tables available, and yet we still had to wait an hour.  It was just annoying that they acted like they were doing me a favor and were pretty frigid each time I asked how much longer.

Our server on the other hand was fantastic.  And the food was.....good.  Not amazing, but good.  An appetizer of Black Cod was well done, where I found the crab cake appetizer to be just OK.  We had a fried shrimp dish app which was also very good.  And the steaks, well it's a Morton's concept, so they were standard, solid Morton's fare.

Overall fun, but with the stupid amount of great restaurants in Vegas, I doubt I would be back.",rWLI-KeG6u1Y7zLIEGWJlA,1,0,3,Ji7a4vKMo15qIwOXIHc94w
4057691,2013-03-13,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"This review is really limited to Restaurant Week menu.  Never came here when it was Beso, but was very pumped to check this place out for Restaurant Week.  We had a 6 p.m. reservation (yeah, with the 80 year olds) and got there a few minutes early.  Although we had the option of getting seated, we decided to have a beer on the patio first.  I'm not sure if it is because this was my Last Supper before my Insanity diet started, but man, that Fat Tire was bomb.

Once we were seated, I started checking out the place.  I liked the atmosphere, although it was on the quiet side.  Then I remembered:  It's 6 o'clock.  Started with some raw oysters which we ordered off the regular menu.  I would say these oysters were nothing special, so we should probably have stuck to RW.  

As far as RW menu goes, I had the chopped salad and my BF had the caesar.  I didn't get a bite, so his must have been good.  My chopped salad was pretty great, especially the candied pecans and the house dressing was just right.  For entrees, we split skirt steak and salmon and shared two sides, wild mushrooms and pureed potatoes.  I really enjoyed all the food, especially the salmon dish which included lentils and pieces of lump crab.  My only real complaint is the same complaint I have for the original Morton's:  Way too much oil on the steak!  I'm a meat lover and all that oil is just wrong.  Dessert was shescake (seriously) and cinnamon twists.  The twists were blah but the shescake more than covered the dessert bases.

Now for the best part:  Around 7:30 this place went nuts.  Girls came out in bustiers and on stilts and things got kind of weird after that but I really enjoyed it!  haha.  There was also a girl dj and that was cool to see.  P.S. our server was this sweet little thing from Indiana (whose name escapes me because I was too focused on grubbing) and service was great.

4070960,2014-03-11,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"I live in Las Vegas and picked out She by Morton's to connect with a girlfriend.  We ate at the bar versus taking a table and it was great. 

Despite the negative reviews I read on Yelp about there being ladies walking along the ledge and that being part of the experience, I don't those give this place enough credit.  This restaurant fits many PLUSES in my book:

1) From car to cocktail, it is super close!  Valet to the restaurant (be it valeting at Crystals or Aria) is like a 2 minute walk.  I hate to have to walk through big cavernous casinos to get to a bar/restaurant. 

2) You are not cramped inside a restaurant with no natural light!  This restaurant, especially from the vantage point of the bar, has floor to ceiling views of the contemporary Aria structure. 

3) You have to make a good solid martini in the town or you will loose my business!  Stephanie behind the bar made a perfect Grey Goose martini.  Often a bartender adds too much remoothe or assumes a girl wants her drink dirty.  Stephanie really has this down pat and being a martini drinker of 20+ years, I would go back to this bar. 

We had food that we shared and snacked on.  All items were delicious and we ordered what Stephanie suggested.  On a Friday night, the restaurant was quite, which can be concerning in this town.  In all honesty though, knowing that the three big points above were nailed perfectly in my perception, I rate this spot a 4 out of 5.",QGtuYyH2w_R1r-X5BGmgzw,4,0,4,4RsM-UHlkVRx0Ya-uYVSGQ

We mostly ordered from the recommendations of our server, Holly. The group started with a shared plate of the sea bass bites. I  hoarded the prime rib-eye for myself.  I did manage to share my side of cream of corn and mini-baker.  It was pretty delicious, but the best part of of meal was actually dessert:  Popcorn Milkshake.

The service was excellent, and the General Manager even introduced herself to us and asked how we were doing that evening.

4926260,2013-01-22,1,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"I was surprised to be able to get a reservation for dinner the same night when I called on Friday at 4pm, especially since it was a busy weekend with AVN in town.  I got there before my friend so I sat at the bar and got a dirty martini, which was perfect but SO expensive at $20.  I had, of course, looked at the menu before making reservations and prices seemed very reasonable for a steakhouse on the Strip so I was shocked to see the $20 tab for one drink.

My friend showed up and we were seated in a big booth facing the catwalk.  I loved the ambiance, decor and atmosphere of the restaurant.  They had specialty acts to keep you entertained while you were eating, in case simple conversation with your dinner companion(s) wasn't enough.  There were a couple of gogos walking around on 4-foot tall stilts.  On the catwalk were rotating acts of various beautiful women dancing, doing acrobatics, or just walking around in extravagant costumes.  The addition of all this entertainment really added to the whole wonderful experience we had.

The drink menu came and the drinks were very reasonably priced, which made me all the more shocked about my $20 martini.  I decided to switch it up and ordered a specialty cocktail with champagne, which was just ok.  We started off with fresh oysters, which tasted incredibly smooth and delicious.   We decided to share an 8 oz. filet, lobster tail and a side of ""little bakers"".  The price tag next to the lobster tail said ""MP"" and I've had lobster at various places along the strip and have never paid over $100 so I figured we were okay.  The food came and our jaws dropped at the sight of the lobster tail.  No exaggeration, it was nearly the size of football.  I remember thinking, ""oh boy, we are in trouble"" with regard to the bill.

EVERYTHING was unbelievable.  The filet was cooked perfectly and that lobster tail was probably the best lobster I've ever eaten in my life.  The ""little bakers"" was this dish of little roasted potatoes cut into pieces and topped with sour cream, bacon, cheese and chives.  It was amazing.  We also shared a bottle of Zinfandel that the sommelier suggested.  It went perfectly with our meal.   We were completely stuffed by the time we were done eating so we did not order dessert.

When our bill came, once again our jaws dropped to the floor to see that the lobster tail was $140!!!!  I was seriously like HOLY SHIIIIIII...!! Our total bill was $340, which was quite a bit more than I had expected, but I have absolutely NO regrets and think the food was worth every penny.  

Other than the lobster tail and the $20 martini, the menu prices are not that bad at all in comparison with other steakhouses on the strip.  Our filet was only $36.  You can very easily have a wonderful meal here for 2 for under $150 to include steaks, sides and wine.  This may be my new favorite spot.  Our entire experience was phenomenal.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,4,1,5,JBq0GewJxTSNNq8L8JsWQw

It's a cool trendy version of their father restaurant. The music is loud which my husband and I don't mind. It's a fun hip vibe. I don't recommend this place if your looking for a quiet place to dine. 

I had the 6 oz Oscar filet which is a filet with crab meat, asparagus, small pieces of bacon and bernaise sauce. It was sooooo delicious! So worth it. It was the first time my husband tried a Morton's steak. He had the 8oz filet without the oscar and he loved it! We ordered creamy spinach and mac and cheese. It was really good!!!!

Service was good. I can't say a bad thing about it. I recommend this place if your looking for a great steakhouse with fun trendy twist!!!!",aZjsi5gzxmJqWKGh6N7Dag,1,0,5,XCCWTG7H_0Uyychn9wZwFA

I went for drinks and dessert with my friends from out of town(I moved to Las Vegas area two weeks ago). We were seated in Russ's area. He is such a friendly and amazing server. He recommended stuff to us and even brought me a sample of their cream corn my friends were raving about(they came the night before as well). We had some cupcake shots that had frosting and sprinkles on them. We had champagne and then a huge dessert platter of all the things you could want, cheesecake, some kinda bread cake, choc cake, some kind of fluffy moose stuff.. ALL GOOD. The GM came over and spoke to us a few times to see how we were doing. She was very friendly and accommodating. My friend said she wanted to go to Ghost Bar that night with her family that was in from Illinois and the GM called her friend she knew at Palms to make sure the ladies got walked in. They had a fashion show on their catwalk which was entertaining. Then after they had the hottest girls dancing on stage. One was a belly dancer and one was on pointe shoes-and their booties hanging out in a classy way:) The guys next to us were eating some juicy steaks which looked amazing as well. Overall, I am definitely go back with some friends cause I know they will be impressed.

5075867,2013-11-21,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"Finally was able to check out She the other night with some friends when we found out it was 20% off for locals. Not sure if that is a regular thing, just Sundays or just that one day... you may have to call and ask. Additionally, they were doing a special with bottles of Dom P for $100!!! I was down to do it but nobody else was so we just ordered individual drinks.

Service gets a 5 out of 5 for me. Andrew was our server and was very attentive and did a great job explaining specials and some of his favorites on the menu. As a group we tend to go through a lot of bread and he kept it coming throughout the whole meal.

My biggest negative was the price of drinks... wow. Nightclub prices at a restaurant.

Cupcake Shot:
Vanilla vodka, some sort of cream I believe and something else... the rim was lined with icing and sprinkles. I'm not a fan of these type of shots but this one was pretty good!

Tomahawk (I didn't get it but the others did):
50 oz for $169... a bit out of my price range and considering the bone probably makes up for 10-15oz didn't think it was really worth it. However, I tried a few bites and... oh man... drooooool. I'm not a big steak fan, but I could probably eat that every day for the rest of my life and be a happy camper.

Caesar Salad:
Split this with Kacey as an appetizer. Pass on this... The lettuce was overly chilled for me and I wasn't a fan of their Caesar dressing.

Short Rib:
I find that we've been ordering short rib just about everywhere we go lately. This was probably the second best I've ever had but it was really close to first. Delicious! Perfectly cooked and really good flavor.

Dessert Sampler:
I normally don't make it to dessert but seeing as how I split my meals with Kacey I had some room left over. Peanut Butter Mouse Cake (I think) with a side of raspberry ""jelly"" whipped cream of sorts on the side was the star of this platter. But the others were very tasty as well: flour-less chocolate cake, cheesecake, little hershey kiss type things and a tiramisu.

This place is not cheap but it is a beautiful venue with a nice atmosphere. They used to do runway shows and have a DJ every night from what I understand but now it is just on Fridays.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,1,4,RWFEqFtCF4-nEF2Wo2eWyg

We were bummed that STK was completely booked, but they recommended SH? & they said the vibe was great & the food was amazing, so we thought, why not! It's only down the street so no need for a taxi! 

The ambiance is really chill but, still lively & upscale. Decor is modern and chic. Very similar to Cosmo, IMO. We arrived for our reservation at 8, we were immediately seated, and greeted by our server Wyatt. From jump - Wyatt was super friendly and made great suggestions.

Boyfriend and I ordered the following: 

*pinot noir - three suits: paired for the rib eye, such a great taste esp with our main entree! We love reds and this was just right! 

* ménage (shrimp/oyster) appetizer: the shrimps were so plump & the oysters were yummy! It came with cocktail sauce, horse radish, tobacco, & a vinaigrette of some sort that was really flavorful! 

* chopped salad: no joke, jam packed with flavor and so light. The mix of bacon, bleu cheese, and candied walnuts was pretty epic! 

* 22 oz Chicago bone in rib eye (medium rare) : we shared this & man, it was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of fat and the flavor was unreal! 

* Grilled asparagus: drizzled in balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Cooked perfectly and a great side to the rib eye! 

* Mac and SH?ese: from what Wyatt told us, new item on the menu. So yummy - not too cheesy, but still flavorful! 

* popcorn shake: do not knock this dessert until you try it! It may have been the highlight of our meal. Popcorn flavored ice cream topped with caramel popcorn. The mix of sweet and salty was so right! The presentation was so cute as well! 

All in all - an amazing meal! Service was top notch and the food was outstanding! Wyatt was great & not too much time lapses on between each dish. Throughout the night - boyfriend and I noted that their song selection was on point as well. Great music playing the entire time we were seated! Plus, outside the window there's a nice view of the fountain which we've never seen! I highly recommend checking out SH?, it won't disappoint!",r4Esxn_rXHgXAV9NRgDw2g,2,0,5,_jDqGEjuTrB75jUwm7leiQ

After having two glasses of champagne I was denied a third 2 hours and 45 into my meal.  I spilled a drink on my friend and was told that is the reason why I was denied. I'm 32 and have never been denied alcohol in my life because I don't get sloppy.  The manager was so rude to me. He told me it was against the law. He obviously was extremely stupid or just discriminating against me. Three glasses of champagne in a three hour period is legal.  I did not leave a tip because my server is the one who told his manager I was drunk because I spilled a drink and needed club soda.

5315003,2013-02-13,0,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"For being a restaurant with the association of Morton's I assume my standards are quite high. I absolutely love MORTON'S and was excited to try out SHe.

The décor and layout is quite appealing. Very Vegas, as it should be. The concept of the mini catwalks and stages presented a unique attraction to the venue. The model's and dancers were very attractive and talented, but overall theme was very, should I say, abstract!?

VENUE: I couldn't quite tell what the target demographic was. It looked trendy, as if to appeal to mid 20- 40's ... but the choice of music appealed to mid 40's - up. I felt the choice of music was misplaced. But as I looked around, the crowd was an older crowd as well. (I had dinner with girlfriends on a Sunday Night)

SERVICE: It was not to Morton's standard. I felt neglected by my server, although the service staff provided bread and water frequently. The menu knowledge of the server was lacking. Questions were not answered confidently and I was mislead to how the plates were served.

Traditionally, Morton's is A la carte, and I was told this place was the same. It is not. The plates are accompanied with complimentary items (which is nice). But, I was convinced to purchase much more than I wanted to eat. Don't get me wrong, it was a pleasure to try a little bit of everything, but as we know, it's a pricy place to dine.

FOOD: Was delicious. It met my expectations. I don't recall anything I didn't like, and my girlfriends and I picked off each others plates to try it all. We had: Pan Seared Salmon, Beef Short Ribs, Pan Roasted Jumbo Shrimp, Mini Bakers (absolutely delicious), Creamed Spinach, and Asparagus.

OVERALL: It was definitely an experience. Once again, my expectations are biased based on association of MORTON'S. If the service kicked up their game a notch the value would be worth it.",yIp1mxx-kdWsLKOw4J9waw,0,1,2,PEZAz0F162TpCte5nXAOTQ
5319033,2013-11-19,6,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"I went here for dinner with friends. We got seated right away. Our server, Andrew was great.  He made excellent recommendations and made sure we got our money's worth. We might have been famished since we kept getting more bread - the cinnamon butter was delicious.

After a long day of drinking which started at 11am for me, I got a cocktail, a lobster roll and split a Tomahawk steak with a giant. We were offered Dom Perignon for $100/bottle as their special for the evening but since nobody in our group wanted it except for me and I know I shouldn't drink a whole bottle of alcohol by myself, we opted to miss out on this great deal.

Pink Lemonade: 
Bacardi Limon + Grey Goose Citron + Chambord.  I took a few sips and I was done. It was citrusy and pretty strong or maybe I've reached my alcohol limit for the day. 3/5

Cupcake Shot:
Vanilla vodka + other things I cannot remember after a whole day of drinking. 4/5

Espresso Shot:
Coffee liqueur, etc. Delicious! You can't taste the alcohol until you feel that buzz.  5/5

Lobster Roll:
I was excited to see this on the menu but my excitement died when I saw it in front of me. The roll was dry and super crunchy. Sliced into 4 pieces...maybe because there were 4 of us? But the lobster meat was chopped into teeny tiny pieces. The creme fraiche (not mayo...yay!) was light. This is a steak place, I get it. 3/5

Tomahawk:
50oz of pure beefy goodness for $169! Not on the menu but your server will let you know about it. Served with spinach and tomatoes soaked in 100-year-old balsamic vinegar. Tender, fatty (I don't like animal fat but I knew what I was getting myself into) but needs a bit more salt, otherwise, it would've been perfect! The meat on the bone...ooohhhh... 4/5

Dessert Sampler:
PB&J, tiramisu, flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. The chocolate cake was my least favorite and surprisingly, the PB&J was the star of this sampler. Crazy! It was a peanut butter mousse and a thin layer of chocolate with a side of raspberry ""jelly"" with the consistency of gelatin + cream. 4/5

It's 20% off for locals. They have a DJ and some girls on a ramp on busy nights like Friday/Saturday. Their steak selections are divided into 3: She Cuts (for the ladies who want petite and less fatty steaks like 6oz filet and 8oz short steak for about $36), He Cuts (the bigger and ""manlier"" steaks such as 8oz or 12oz filet, 16oz prime strip or ribeye from $40-50, 22oz Chicago-style bone-in ribeye at market price..I prefer steaks from this side) and We Cuts (to be shared by a couple: 32oz bone in New York strip for $79 or a 40oz porterhouse for $96).

The crab cakes came and were absolutely delicious along with the bread that accompanies all meals. 

My scallops and his steak came out. My scallops came out in 4 pieces with a sweet bacon on top of creamed corn and wow! It was amazing! The food here at She was great, the reason that I'm giving this restaurant only 2 stars is because they brought out my bf's steak as medium well when he ordered it medium rare. We understand mistakes, which was fine but it took another 20 minutes for his correct steak to come out.

He obviously didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but when you're paying $60 for a steak, c'mon. My food was sitting on the table and I wasn't gonna be rude and finish it and he not have his. When they finally brought his steak, they covered it in regular butter but we ordered the $12 bleu cheese to come on the side since I'm pregnant.

Horrible, horrible service.

To top that, it took about 10-15 min to bring out his wine, each time. He ordered 3 glasses and the only time he was able to get a taste is when I asked for it. For a fine dining restaurant, I expect that they bring a tasting to the table.

The mashed potato sides he enjoyed, although I didn't. It was a bit dry with not much flavor.

The asparagus was enjoyed by me, not by him. It was nothing particularly special, but none-the-less, veggies are almost always a good thing.

The only side we agreed upon was the delicious creamed corn. It was sweet and creamy.

We wish the service wasn't horrible. Other than that, I would've given this restaurant a better review. But, it was valentine's day. And it was ruined. I won't be coming back.

PS we just asked for all of our stuff to go since we were extremely dissatisfied. When asked to package up our meal it took another 20 min. Wow, ridiculous.",1z01NwSTBMUae8Fjw2rQog,0,0,2,SW89jafSPnzPc3HZ1DXQQw

5939210,2013-02-21,15,vPWvyl9gxmuOIXDBL6lSpw,"I guess the reason this place only has 12 reviews is because it's really f*cking expensive and most people can't afford to eat here. 

Ife A. and I have developed this routine of having our weekly ""Adventures of Randomness"", and since it was Valentines Day I assumed we would have one giant motherf*cking profanely violent V-Day full of good old fashion assaults, grand theft, and lots of death metal. But, she had other plans.  She had heard about SHE BY MORTON'S after reading an article in a magazine earlier in the week. It ended up being the most ""ritzy"" restaurant I had ever eaten at. Honestly, it was a complete new experience to me. 99% of my dining is done at Ramen-Yas, and Sushi joints, so coming to a restaurant that served ""white people food"" was a complete out of body experience. Of course, Ife had to make the reservations because I'm incompetent at everything not related to  my profession. Seriously, I struggle to perform daily tasks such as shopping for groceries, preparing food, and using technology.  

This is obviously a 5-star establishment. The servers are ALL extremely friendly and hardworking. I don't think I have ever seen such good service in my life, it's even better than Japanese hospitality. 

I did have some difficulties. It's very loud in this place. They got a DJ and a bunch of ...kinda stripper girls(I think). I lost all but approximately 30% of my hearing in my left back when I was a teenage athlete, so going to any club/bar/party is extremely difficult to me. I just can't hear anything anybody says. Like literally the whole night was me just nodding my head to whatever Ife said, and pretending I could hear her. But the loud atmosphere was probably my only complaint. 

As I recall, we ordered this $80 steak which was the best steak I have ever had in my life. I can't recall what cut of beef it was. I think it might have been a porterhouse, but it's texture was similar to a normal places filet(really high quality). We ordered the steak medium rare, and they did a great job searing the outside, while keeping the inside bloody. I also want to note that the steaks here come a la carte, with no sides.  

As an appetizer we got oysters on the half shell. It was like $18 or something and we only got 4 oysters. They better have been organic because that was a lot of money for 4 half-dollar sized oysters. 

A lot of the items didn't really have a clear and visible price next to them, so I assumed the check would be anywhere from $500- $1000, but it ended up being somewhere around $200. To me, that's really low for such a high-end restaurant.  I mean, we did get dessert, a side of creamed spinach(which was really good), and something called Dom Perignon(being Straight Edge I had no clue what that was). For $200, it was worth it. 

The only thing that sucked about the night was that I accidentally tipped the valet $10.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,16,13,5,aus_NHhS69j7kzFCMnlLzA
