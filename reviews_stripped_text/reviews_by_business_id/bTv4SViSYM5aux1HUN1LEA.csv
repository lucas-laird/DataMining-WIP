I always go Auntie Anne's, so I know how a normal pretzel is supposed to taste like. I walked all the way to my car before I realized it was hard and stale so I could not go back to get a refund or switch pretzels.",5IIyP1evkoVw0pLnVNuNWA,0,0,1,Z7gu5xPzZhyPe1T6FmOqsw

So I went back today to let them know about the poor quality of the food, expecting at least a ""here is a replacement order"" but not happening . 
""Oh yes, unless you bring the cremated food back we cans do anything for you"" I showed her the pics and she wouldn't even look.. so I was supposed to get my shoes back on an walk all the way back from  the Delano ,???  Who the hell would do that to show them garbage..   I can't stand people that don't give a shit!!",QETiTwX20m1KUbOjxNt8Gw,0,0,1,imNv27cQCHKwsrqigjpOVQ

3677294,2014-02-08,2,bTv4SViSYM5aux1HUN1LEA,"I made the wrong food decision the other night; Auntie Anne's would've been the right one. Instead, I had to watch my husband eat his pretzel-wrapped hot dog while I ate oily, over-cooked green beans from Pick Up Stix next door.  It was awful. http://www.yelp.com/biz/pick-up-stix-las-vegas-6#hrid:Kt_Lms6DPLzceFljZvS8sQ

While I ate my food I watch hubby enjoy his hot dog/pretzel ($5.39). I should have just ordered a pretzel by itself. With lots of mustard. Would've been much healthier and much more enjoyable. The bite of pretzel I had from him was great. Especially since we were eating at midnight.

This might be one of the better food options in the Excalibur Food Court.",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,3,2,4,VwMeyqQBkRplO0LQ2j5KMg

  I enjoyed the pretzel. It was tasty yet slightly greesy.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,1,1,3,yC4VSRGux4CNLaSqGBHoZA

5846644,2017-12-29,4,bTv4SViSYM5aux1HUN1LEA,"This place is perfect for a quick snack. Especially if you're not really looking for a meal, this does the trick! The girls working there are really friendly.

I normally get just a plain pretzel and a cheese dip. their pretzel bites are probably the most popular ones, since they are easier to carry and dip, which works out if your walking around. The pretzel dog is pretty good as well as the pepperoni and jalapeño ones. Try them all lol 

There have been a couple of times that they are out of the regular unsalted pretzel, the one I normally get. So sometimes I switch up and it gives me the chance to try a different one. Either way, it'll fill you up.",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,8,5,3,TDvWBGI3BoYEwdBFR1VTJw
