Delivery time took over an hour when it was promised to be under that. The pizza was pretty warm though so most likely they got a little busy. 

The pizza was excellent. Not the best that I've had but it's definitely up there and better than your regular chains, Papa Johns, Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. This place definitely doesn't skimp on the toppings either.. the veggie and meat lovers were LOADED with toppings dropping all over the place. The fries were good. The nuclear fries were hot but nothing to go raving about. I'd order from here again, but would definitely try to find a coupon or some sort of discount.",8IImIY6OIKzGQhmkk4zb2w,4,0,4,tFndm4Xzd8xxKu6j5aMWug
215707,2014-12-04,0,vQWVP7MtpgXFwUMvxCj9Tw,"""Came For The Pretty Great Pizza but Stayed Longer For The Crazy Calzone""

Interesting location within the Ellis Island Casino. Not fancy, mostly locals. I went for dinner with my husband, but he had already eaten a few hours before. I on the other hand, had not eaten since breakfast. I ordered a small pepperoni/mushroom pizza. It took about 10-15 minutes, which seemed an eternity since I was so hungry.

It finally came. The cheese melted just right. It wasn't greasy and the crust was perfect. Pizza was cooked evenly. I took my first bite. It was so delicious. I asked my husband to try it. He did and also loved it. Pretty soon I could tell that one pizza would not cut it for the both of us, so we ordered a three cheese calzone. After 10 minutes, here comes the calzone accompanied by light tomato based sauce. It was huge. We had to wait about 5 minutes to cut into it, way too hot. The melted three cheese delicious stuffing was amazing. I think it is made of a blend of mozzarella, ricotta, and romano cheeses. 

I have to say that the pizza was truly delicious, but the calzone was the very best one I have ever had. When in Vegas, please do stop by this Metro Pizza location. As mentioned above, it is definitely not fancy, but prices are fair and I believe cheaper than their other locations throughout Vegas. Also, a great place to people watch.",hFZ9IM1VjG7vSV7UPOidEg,0,0,5,UQ236bfPkdcYaNEDHn4QEg

i google mapped pizza places that delivered to my hotel, and Metro Pizza came up. within 45 minutes of ordering, a southern-accented delivery gentleman had called to tell me he was waiting at the front desk with my pizza and garlic bread.

to my surprise, he'd also brought me a complementary ""special brew from the local brewery"" -- root beer! that was a nice touch. also, the garlic bread (knots of dough with garlic topping) was TDF (to die for). pizza was pretty good, just the thing to cure a broken heart.

Had ventured to this Metro pizza a couple of years ago after trekking over from the Flamingo hotel...had grabbed a 2 for 1 slice of their plain cheese pizza...then went to the convenience store nearby and grabbed an ice cold bottle of Mexican Coca Cola...I was in heaven with that combination.

Two years later we made the trek again...three times 9after hopping on the shuttle from the Rio to Bally's (and a five minute walk)).

The first visit, the pizza was still incredible. 
We had to wait 10 minutes for the pizza to come out of the oven, but it was worth the wait.
Also had the pizza with a pint of the Elllis Island beer home brew...delicious combination.

The second visit was OK. Again we had to wait for the pizza to come out of the oven, but it wasn't as good as the previous slices...kinda soggy and not crispy.

The third visit was totally terrible, instead of waiting to have a pizza slice fresh from the oven we grabbed a slice that was under the heat lamp. The cashier said it had only been there for a few minutes.
The pizza was kinda cold and the experience made me frustrated that we didn't wait for fresh pizza from the oven...in hindsight, I wish I had complained to the cashier about our experience.",k2563Emcd082HwW3rNuVSw,1,0,4,Z2Zv5C3OKYXyfP9RKX8brA

We came on a Sunday and it was 2 for 1 large pizzas no exceptions. Since it was just 2 of us we asked if we could get 2 smalls and they said no. I thought it was a ridiculous idea for them to refuse to let us only get 1 pizza! What a waste of food. We found a group of hungry looking college kids and they graciously took the pizza off of our hands. We ordered pepperoni and sausage. The sauce is heavenly and the crust has enough chew. The only bad thing is that it gets soggy on the bottom. I didn't keep me from enjoying 3 slices.

Second day I get back to my hotel around 11:30pm. I did 7 miles of walking (according my iPhone) plus the gym at planet Hollywood, so I ended up hungry once back at the hotel 8, great place to stay, right off the strip, $25.00 bucks a night right now.

The casino that it is located in ellis island, it's like the strips love child, it's a casino, but it's not really worth checking out, to be honest. I called from my hotel room, to be answered by a young man that informed me the casino doesn't have the updated menu prices. There seemed to be a lot of metro pizzas in vegas, several around the area according to google maps. 

I got cheese slice, and waited for a new pie to come out. Brought it back to my room and I was very happy. Upon waiting for a new pie, I noticed the dough trays being stacked. This made me happy, having worked in a pizza/sports bar, these trays means the dough is from scratch, as well as all the other toppings. 

So going off onto a tangent, pizza places like this make a lot of there toppings via prep, they slice the meat and veggies like port of subs does with a deli slices, and they bake there meat/mushrooms etc veggies,  in an fire roasted oven. 

So, finally to the review of the pizza. Cheese was stringy, crust was super thin, they had garlic power, oregano, chili flakes, salt, pepper, and parmesan to top the pizza off. The ranch was home made, but again too sour creamyish. That's kinda been the trend in Vegas I have noticed. 

The guy behind the counter gave me ranch for free. It's not like the best thing in the world, but I really appreciated how happy and chill the employees were.",0e5VpxLQfWOFLzQtHvMkGg,1,1,4,YIXoygEfJ8QWx3zGz00tUA

Located inside the Ellis Island Casino off of Flamingo and Paradise, this find of a gem is a must especially on those days! For those that are not familiar with Metro Pizza, these guys are consistently in the top 5 of the Best of Las Vegas. For you first timers I suggest the Gotham, which has a little bit of everything. If not that, then the Honululu, which has ham, pineapple, green onions, and bacon bits!

They not only have pizza, but their Garlic Romano Fries will definitely keep the vampires away from you! Or that one obnoxious person you don't wanna talk to! 

They have other locations as well but why would you not go here on those two days listed? You not only save money, but you get 2 awesome pizzas guaranteed!

The only downfall I think is that on those particular days, they are very busy. They do have booths with tables but they are usually taken. My suggestion would be to call for pick up. When you get there, if there are tables available, by all means, grab them! If not, then you can always go somewhere else to eat.

Maybe their pizzas are a little high on the sodium content?

The dude working at the front counter is on it! He always packs us plates, napkins, crushed red pepper, and parmesan cheese. Props, dude! Overall, the good deal, decent pizza, and friendly service is what brings me back on Thursdays.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,6,7,4,_IYZRDpYlBnajMsmi8djUg

I had heard from the shuttle driver that the pizzas are yummy and yes, that is so!

Thursdays are buy one slice or pizza and get one free. Same thing on Sundays too. I watched as dazed gamblers would rouse themselves from all their slot action and stumble over to Metro and grab a pizza slice and beer. There is a little area now with three booths that the under 21 crowd can chow down at. Otherwise, a sign does warn that around the corner is 21 and up only. That's because there are enormous vats of beer brewing right behind some windows. I guess Ellis Island brews it's own, which is brewing sustainably. 

The pizza's are DELICIOUS! I had the Supreme slice and it was loaded with every good thing! In fact the piece of pie was so top heavy with ingredients that I could not lift it up to my mouth to eat, so I rolled it and thought to myself, I am going to get a heart attack from this, but I will die happy! I also ordered a 16 oz. cup of their brewed on the spot light beer and it only cost $1.75 for a cup. Also had the antipasto salad made on the premises and it was unholy good too! After pulling out the onions and peppers, it was full of slices of meat and cheeses with a wonderful Italian balsamic dressing.

We were actually going to dine in the restaurant at Ellis Island because lil guy wanted ribs. Well, the kitchen was closed that particular night and they were on a limited menu. Ribs was not part of it. Then, we decided to walk over to the brewery because they also serve ribs, but we got there at 10:03pm and they close at 10pm.

Hubby had been driving and driving around like he usually does and couldn't make up his mind where we should eat. Of course, hours go by and we've just completely missed the boat. A couple who were waiting by the brewery said they'd been there for 45 minutes and still were not seated. GODAMMIT. Lil guy was now starving.

So there was only one thing left. Metro Pizza. The stuff looked like it'd been sitting there forever. OK the good thing is that these pizza slices were paper thin (the way I like my pizza).

We waited a long time since the guy behind near the oven was on his cell phone. 8-10 mins go by and another guy comes over and helps us. Lil guy wanted a slice of pepperoni and hubby and I got the combo topping selection. Boy, the guy didn't even put it into the oven for us and I didn't know to ask.

We sit down and lil guy immediately said ""mommy, this is really greasy"". He had picked up the slice and his plate had a pool of oil just laying there. I would've taken a photo but my hands were greasy from my own slice so I decided not to soil my camera.

I ended up using about 10 napkins to soak up some of the oil from lil guy's pizza. Our slices weren't all that great either. I guess if you've been out partying and drinking, all that grease is probably okay. However, we were starving and it was just a disgusting end to an otherwise great day.

The price was not too expensive and the extra cheese only cost 50 cents extra, which in my mind was well worth it.
