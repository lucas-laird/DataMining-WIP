11249,2015-03-12,0,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"I don't like giving poor reviews, but the quality of food for what they charge just isn't worth it.  I understand it's Vegas, but......

We were looking for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Saturday before catching our flight home.  Our normal spot, Hash House A Go Go, was absolutely packed and we didn't want to wait so we figure we'd try Chayo.  The ambience was nice and host staff friendly.  

We were seated and ordered drinks.  I ordered a margarita, friend ordered a mojito.  My margarita was good, but her mojito was...well....yellow.  I've never seen a yellow mojito before.  She sent it back and when they brought her another one it looked (and tasted) like an actual mojito! I don't know what that first one was.  

That was about the only positive part - decent (although expensive) drinks.  The food was less than mediocre.  My friend ordered a simple caesar salad with dressing on the side.  They brought her mayonaise.  Yes, mayonaise.  She asked for oil and vinegar instead, she was told they don't have oil and vinegar and brought her some citrus type stuff that again, was pretty much just mayo with lemon juice squeezed into it.  I've worked in enough kitchens and made enough dressings from scratch to know that most of the creamy dressings are mayo based, but it's NOT ALL MAYO!!!!!  Who wants to put mayo on their salads?  The salad itself - ugh.  The greens were very limp, not crisp.  Chicken was dry.  

I ordered the tacos.  Very underwhelming.  They lacked flavor.  Sorry, not a fan.",uG6C3WT4bcpv_M6utVIJYA,1,0,2,IVGXKf09dYZ8FoQpNxUWNA

I was looking for a late night meal and decided to check it out and therefore seated myself at the bar. A bartender leaving his shift informed that the other bartender at the bar would take over. After placing my order I never received help again. I motioned for the other bartender several times and was ignored each and every time. I could maybe understand if the bar was incredibly slammed and the bartender was all alone, but there were at the most 9 people at the bar who were mostly just drinking. After getting her attention, I politely asked for a manager. She disappeared for 5 minutes and told me my entire meal was covered. I sincerely appreciated that, but would've ordered more food and perhaps another drink if I only just had service. Finally I would've left a healthy tip.

Aside from the service, the food was slightly above average as were the drinks. Even if the service was excellent, I more than likely wouldn't have returned based on the food alone.",RVBFo8GVq-HaMGq8ATQX4w,0,0,1,OdRpHkA382NFy9_CG5HPvQ

 Way way way over priced. The Manager should be talking more to the customers and less time talking/flirting with hostesses . Busboy and server was amazing .

When we finally  were able to get someone's attention, he goes ""you can get up to get your drinks."" We looked puzzled and he continued with ""the kitchen is closed. You can go to the bar."" I then responded with ""that's great to know considering no one came up to us in the past half hour."" Then he walked away, clearly upset.

103127,2014-06-20,2,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"Let's start with good. 
They make a good margarita. However, all four of us asked for salted margaritas, not one of them had salt. 
Food, was tasty, nothing special or memorable. 

I've been living in Vegas for about three months now at a hotel while here on a contract, as such I've become very familiar with the food offerings along the strip. 

Now, on to the review. 


The disappointing 
- Took forever to get a server at our table, we had to flag them down after 2 water refills. 
- see salt comment above 
- entrées are laughable small, they arrived and we ordered another appetizer for the table. Tapas sizing, entrée pricing. Definitely not good value. 
- additional appetizer never arrived, it was apparently delivered to the table next to us. Server tried to convince us to order more. Check please! 

I realize we're on the strip, however, most places even at strip prices offer good value for the amount of food. This place, nope, nada, niet, nee, non... 

If this was the last place to eat on the strip, I would probably choose to starve. 

My recommendation, have reservations, serious reservations about eating here and go elsewhere. Gnaw your own arm if it comes to it.",OnzfT8LAge9g28_ySalO0w,6,4,1,VfS0X_NZMQhSmrpR2IC57g

Poor service, we were never brought the chips and salsa or water. Overcharged on the bill.  I ordered mahi-mahi tacos that were fair and at least edible. The alcohol was water-downed, and the bar tender rude when I asked him to make a different drink. He said all drinks are like that!   everything overpriced. No where to sit unless you are eating, so we ate. The music by dj was fair.

Food is nothing to write home about. Fish tacos were greasy and carnitas had chunks of fat in them. Salsa and ceviche were very good. 

Speaking of salsa. If you want it you have to pay for it. What decent Mexican restaurant out there charges for chips and salsa?  Beans and rice are also a la carte and are not included with your meal. 

If you are looking for a fun loud nightclub I recommend this place. Don't go there expecting a memorable dining experience.",mqQBeL4OwCoYGs3DmUXKvA,1,0,2,OyDrjckinQ0EbOhwhbYfyg

We all looked at each other and really didnt understand why she dropped off 3 shots.  We figured they were comped due to the drink order taking so long.  After another 20 minutes we waved down our waitress to ask when our drinks were going to be delivered. She said ""Those are your drinks"" WTF... we explained that we ordered two martinis and a red bull vodka and she looked confused.

The short rib beef was very tender and flavorful and the tacos were amazing. We also had a guacamole and chips and salsa for the table. The chips and salsa were unbelievable and the guacamole was one of my favorites ever. 

As far as drinks go, I went with the servers recommendation and I must say... it did not disappoint. I enjoyed what they called the office, patron silver accompanied by lemon, cucumber soda and st germain.

Overall this was a very pleasant experience. The food was great and our server Jordan was incredibly helpful and nice. I would 100% reccommend this to anybody in the area looking for Mexican food.",Ryiax9-aBpLZFhHyyDnjxw,0,0,5,sCirIL2MlISNr_-RfDHcYg

My complaint is with the drinks, the wine is $10 per glass at the cheapest and the glasses are dirty and tiny. The bartender at the outside second floor bar was very inexperienced, and everyone at our table had to go up to the bar because we were not served drinks at our table. Once at the bar the wait was even longer and the bartender was not helpful and could not make all of the appropriate drinks. Once we finished eating we waited at least 30 minutes and had not seen our waiter.

I find the atmosphere and the decor inviting, everything from the semblance of rope around the booths, art with various bulls and Mexican cultural emblems, and cool lighting. I would say that the place definitely did look the part, and had the staff to more than accommodate the venue.

I had a steak burrito that had a fantastic sauce, but I didn't think it did anything unusually spectacular for me.

This place is a good, consistent spot that I think delivers what you might expect from an upscale, casual dining Mexican restaurant on the sidelines of a casino.

Our server Christina even gave me a spontaneous turbo massage so that I would remember to give a review.

FOOD: Oaxacan Chopped Salad ($14).

TASTE: Chopped salads normally come with a plethora of toppings that are bursting with flavors.  This salad was lackluster, had barely any toppings, and the toppings on the salad were devoid of flavor.  Given the plethora of food options in Vegas, I expect that restaurants should be pulling out all the stops to keep their customers happy.  I would not recommend this salad.  Their tacos did sound good, but they seem over priced for Mexican food...

SERVICE: Our waitress was amazing.  She was on point with our beverages and was very thorough on her explanations when we had questions.  Our drinks were brought out to us almost immediately.  The restaurant has a giant rooster that you can ride (similar to an electronic bull) and our waitress helped arrange it so that some of group could ride it after we finished eating.

CLEANLINESS: Everything in the restaurant was clean.

Symptoms included fever (106 degrees) muscle aches, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms. We actually required medical treatment at the local urgent care due to the severity and duration of the symptoms.

The food is great!  I've had everything from the chips and salsa (cuidado, es muy caliente!) to the fish tacos and everything in between. Todo es muy BUENO!

Chayo is easy to access if you park at the Flamingo, as you land right at the doors of Chayo when you exit the casino.  Chayo is beautifully decorated and a great place to people-watch.  Although other reviews state that the service was poor, we didn't experience this.  Our server was Masih and he was very attentive and entertaining.  In terms of ambiance, I'd give Chayo 5 stars.  In terms of food and beverage, it gets 3 stars.  Let me explain: 1) the cups seemed dirty and water spotted, which prompted me to ask for a straw; 2) We ordered chips and salsa and the salsa was tasty; 3) Empanadas were $10 as an appetizer and they were delicious; 4) street corn was a side for $8 and it was also tasty; 5) the Sangria ($10) left a lot to be desired as it didn't even have any pieces of fruit in it; the house Margarita was actually good at $14, and shots of other various tequilas were a bit over priced.  We went with the intention of trying a few different tequilas, but at $14+ dollars per shot, we only had one!  We tried the Avion Silver which was good.  

All in all, one shot, one margarita, one Sangria, chips and salsa, street corn, and an appetizer brought our bill to $67.  We didn't even get to the main courses!  I probably wouldn't go back to Chayo until they get realistic with their prices.",WLNAJUlGmHUI5OEoYdLSog,6,0,3,M-rotxntNOuSPSfEH2OeTA

My biggest complaint is the service. Not great by any means. I know being a hostess can be very annoying but you should not portray that you are annoyed to your guests. The welcome was not friendly. Also, the service was very slow and my water never got refilled so I had to steal my bf's.

654628,2018-01-01,0,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"My family and I went to Vegas for NYE as usual.  This was the first time we stayed at the Linq.  Initially my mom was really impressed with the friendliness of the staff at the hotel until we came to Chayo Mexcian Kitchen.  After the ball dropped, we were starving and figured we would try Chayo since it was in our hotel.  When we got to Chayo, there was no host. We went to the bar and then to the restaurant at the back to find out if they were still serving food.  We found two helpful waiters who tracked their managers down to find out if they were still serving food.  Woohoo! We were happy when they said ""yes, just go to the front and let the hostess seat you"".  We went to the front, still there was no hostess, so we waited patiently.  While we waited another couple arrived and waited.  When the hostess finally arrived, she seated the couple before us.  I shook it off and ignored it.  When the hostess returned, I ask to be seated with my family of 3.  The hostess claimed there were no seats available and that we would have to wait. When we asked how long the wait would be she had no approximation to give us.  I asked if it would be 15 min or 1 hour and she had no idea. The place was practically empty.  When I explained that we saw plenty of seats available as we were back there already, she then claimed those were taken for reservations.  Let's be clear, it 1am after the ball dropped and people are freely walking up and down the restaurant and it still wasn't packed...who would have tables on reserve???? I've to been restaurants and clubs all over the world.  I'm from NY, live in LA and I've partied with the best.  Chayo is not the kind of club where people have tables on reserve after the ball drops on NYE.  As a matter of fact, Chayo doesn't attract that type of clientele...it was a really weird statement for the hostess to make.  Chayo seemed like decent place eat but it's no 1OAK (I did not say this to her).  From that point on, every effort that we made to get food was declined. Finally, we asked if we could get food to go and that was declined.  I just smiled and walked away because it was obvious that this woman was not willing to seat me and my family . . .maybe it was because of our skin color.  I hate pulling the race card,  but there was no other explanation as to why this woman ran the other couple back to be seated without asking them two words and then basically refused to seat us and then rambled off a string of nonsensical excuses.  Is this Mexican restaurant racist or is just this hostess? It was a horrible way to start off my New Years.  If you're a person of color and you see a red headed woman with a face full of pimples working as a hostess at Chayo just turn around and head over to O'Sheas next door.  It's not worth it to have her ruin your day.  Obviously, my mom no longer felt as welcomed as she did when we first arrived.  It's too bad Chayo left a bad taste in our mouth that taints our impression of the Linq.  We will not return to either.",WfUWBGwGEwPN8el3kHdfKg,0,0,1,dtCkuQiPH6DaUSA2SkNa1g

We read the mediocre reviews but decided to give the restaurant a chance anyway, and we ended up being really disappointed.  We arrived and our server, while flighty, was friendly enough and was able to make recommendations that we appreciated.  The execution of our orders however was terrible.  She had to come back to us after our drink order and our food order because she couldn't remember what we had told her.  Two of us ordered margaritas, one came with salt and the other was missing it entirely.  Not sure how that wasn't caught before it was delivered to our table.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer for $10 and barely got enough chips to eat it (see photo).  We also ordered salsa that never came.  I ordered the shrimp fajitas which was plenty of food, but it was bland and boring.  We waited forever for our bill to come - when it finally did, our server took our three credit cards to split our bill.  She was gone for over 30 min with our cards and when she came back she didn't even remember taking our cards.  She was completely incoherent and appeared to be heavily drugged - which was really sad considering we liked her.  Her other table was also looking for their credit cards.  As it turns out, we both had the same server and she got our cards and tickets mixed up.  Our table was charged for a $300 bill when our bill was only $90.  After a long, not fun conversation with a manager, we were assured the charges would not post.  I got home today and realized that not only did they charge my card for $100 of the $300 bill, they also charged me for another table's $200 bill.  So after spending over 30 min dealing with a manager on this issue while we were at the restaurant, I now need to work through disputing charges with my credit card company and calling the restaurant again.  The restaurant could also improve on atmosphere/ambiance when a live band is playing in the plaza outside the restaurant.  The music in the restaurant competes with the live band making conversation impossible and is extremely distracting.  I would just avoid this restaurant entirely.",2Louw53RwugxhuxKHYKDDg,0,0,1,zJp_blr0GcV1ICS_YtqE3w

The cilantro cream soup with pine nuts was awesome, and the sweet corn enchiladas were AMAZING. Unfortunately I didn't get to finish them due to the sheer amount of food we had gotten with our appetizers, but I would have taken them home with me if I hadn't had plans later that evening.

Asked the waitress for the list and she there was none, she said "" we have over a 100"" but what they were was not known by her.    Drinks came for all and the the waitress did not remember who ordered what drink.   Same happened when the food arrived.   We were all passing plates around to the right person.  

Food overall was good.   Guacamole was tasty and so were all the tacos.   

We continued to drink some of the high end tequila throughout dinner.   

This is where I had a bunch of tequila in me and I was irritated by this:

Check arrives and hand written on the bottom says "" suggested 20% Tip = 76.90 Thank you"". 

Not happy with the note went to the manger he said sorry.    Went to the waitress and asked .. Did the restaurant as you to do this or was it your choice?    After a short dialogue she said it was her idea to write it.     We were 6 non rowdy business people.   She would have received  more then 20%.   She got less

Food Ok but service was unprofessional and not trained well.   So many places to eat in Vegas.    Don't bother with this one.",M16G28ixhfGOsuoh6joi3w,1,0,2,tqNUKXN3vzA8wSm4YCpvqw
734508,2014-01-06,1,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"Came here 1/4/14 with a rather large group for dinner without reservations.
From  the outside it looks great! Stone front, heaters and outdoor seating. Once inside, it is a very intimate setting with dim lights, like that of ""fine dinning"". This place, mind you, is brand spankin' new! Even has the new smell. So far so good right? 

Wellllll, for starters my group ordered a ""pitcher"" of Mexican Mule. Took awhile to recieve our pitcher, and when we did receive it, I was not happy with what I saw. First off, they bring out several glass with filled with ice and a straw of course. Secondly, the so called ""pitcher"" is not how I imagined it, like a traditional beer pitcher, but oh well. Thats not the really problem. What I was not happy with was the fact that the pitcher was more than half way filled ice (mind you there was already ice in the glass they brought). Basically this pitcher is really ice on ice! Equivilent of 3 and a half drinks! The drink was good, I give them that. But I had to remove the ice from the pitcher and poor the rest of the cocktail into a seperate glass, because the ice in the pitcher kept pouring out.

Now, the food. I ordered the Flank Steak with Yucca Fries and Chimichurri. And it was just, it just fell short. The steak was cooked well done but it had no taste. Even though it says ""chimichurri"", those flavors were nonexistent. The only tasty thing on my plate was the yucca fries. The Boyfriend ordered the Pork Sopes, which I did in fact try, the chorizo was way overcooked, and greasy. Very unpleasant to say the least.

Our servers were great, I cannot deny that. Overall Chayo's food is very bland, under seasoned and pitcher drinks are not worth it at all.",6aiGYvvBrvGtpB0eFO2LEA,3,0,1,LNVipcnck0FHbmDq4h_Feg

We're locals and visit the LINQ when we're feeling a little fancy.  We went to Chayo when it first opened for my last birthday, and the service was pretty abysmal.  I was drinking that night, and nothing bothered me too much.  However, it took about 40 minutes to get our food on a Tuesday night.  No one offered an explanation, and our table of six agreed that it must have been those bugs that every restaurant needs to iron out at the beginning or the size of the party and didn't hold it against them.

Tonight, however, solidified our original impressions.  My boyfriend and I sat down and quickly ordered our drinks/food.  The server, a tall, blonde woman, was incredibly helpful and we truly appreciated her help.  However, the food runner sat our food down at another table after about 25 minutes of waiting, and didn't bring our refire for an additional 23 minutes.  When he did, the food was cold.

Our server was great and had some of our check comp'd, but the runner was having a really rough night.  At least two tables in our immediate vicinity also had some of their checks covered.

I told him don't worry about the tortillas we're just ready to order.... ok one of us ordered the nachos with chorizo... food came about 45 minutes later, no chorizo, mine was cold (diablo shrimp) , he finally checked on us... we told us the problem reluctantly and he took my food, never asked if I wanted something else... just walked away.

928145,2014-05-12,0,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"I'd give this place a 3.5star rating for food. 

Appetizers- The tortilla soup was amazing, but had no chicken or cheese, which all other tortilla soups I've had all contained. So this one just seemed like it was missing something, but it did taste amazing. They don't provide free chips and salsa- they're $3. The chips are seasoned, but neither the chips nor salsa are very flavorful. 

Entrées- I had the beef short rib and my gf had the fish tacos. My dish was okay. The short rib was super tender and the plating looked amazing, but lacked flavor in the meat and in the mashed potatoes. My gf's tacos were good, but had too much sauce that tasted like mayonnaise.

Dessert- I got the tres leche, and again, it was only okay. I'm used to having tres leche very moist and sweet, but this one was dry and not very sweet. Honestly, the food isn't bad, but it's just not something I'll rave about.

Reason to go:
The staff was SUPER friendly and nice. The location is perfect, located in the new Linq project in the center of the Las Vegas strip. They have outside seating, so you can enjoy the fresh air and people watch while you dine.

We were running out of time to watch a show and decided to check this place out because it didn't seem too busy for a Saturday evening.  First we entered the restaurant via the Quad. Upon entering we approached the hostess stand where 2 hostesses were standing. Neither one greeted my girlfriend and I and had my girlfriend not said said anything, who knows how long we would  been standing there.  We were seated immediately. The server was polite and helpful taking our drink orders immediately and giving us ample time to peruse the menu.  

Now for the drinks, my girlfriend ordered the Don margarita and ordered another cocktail called the Office. Drinks were pricey at $14 each but I guess it was to be expected on the strip.  We weren't too impressed with them and ended up ordering 2 beers.  We ordered chips and salsa ($3) & for our meals,  my girlfriend ended up ordering the Manchego burger ($16) and I ordered the carnitas ($13 for 3).  The chips weren't bad and the salsa was tasty with just enough kick to be able to enjoy it.  My girlfriends burger was tasty and nicely seasoned with a side of fries. The carnitas however, were tasteless and extremely oily! Initially I thought what I was seeing was the lime juice I had squeezed over them, but I realized it was oil and I literally had to pick up each taco and tilt it to drain the oil.  I held each taco up for at least 10 seconds before I attempted to eat them.
Total bill before tip $79.99.  Overall, service was ok at best & the food - nothing to get excited about. We agreed the best thing was the chips & salsa.  Would we come here again? No...and neither would we recommend this place to anyone looking for good Mexican food. Sorry.",JT2OJOA04sep0Aqml_lBzA,0,0,1,N5HEUb0gMuY_hi9gjqaHfg

If your at the bar Danielle was extremely friendly and helpful. Top class hospitality from her. And Conrad the bartender was awesome. Very knowledgeable of all the drinks and polite. They were easy to engage in conversations with. Drinks were great had the Don Margarita and the Office speciality cocktails. A bit pricey but can be expected on the strip. 

Food was great just had tapas ribeye taco. Great flavor. Will definitely come back and try other menu options. Overall the service was better than I expected due to the friendly staff. Location is great over at the Linq. I highly recommend to check this place out!!

We were able to choose from a four course menu and, as we were choosing, we had chips and salsa that were very tasty.

For the first portion of the course, you had the option of either the Caesar salad or the cilantro cream soup.  I had the Caesar salad. It was an interesting take on the salad because it was a wedge with what looked like a fried chip (it was a sheet of fried cheese). There was also an anchovy on the side (that wasn't my cup of tea). Overall, it was pretty good. 

For the second portion, I got the carnitas. It was good, especially with the lime. It was a little messy to eat though. 

For the third, I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Not my favorite of the four I received... It needed some spice to it. 

The flan was amazing! I am pretty picky with flan since my dad makes the best kind in my opinion but this flan was not too sweet and not too thick! Definitely perfect ending to a very large meal. 

At the end of our course, the chef came out to introduce himself and thank us for coming. The waiters throughout the stay continued to fill our waters and they were very good at making sure we were okay. I definitely appreciated the service here!

The location was awesome! We were upstairs and there's a balcony overlooking the Linq area and the High Roller. Mind you, this was in the morning so I'm sure it is a beautiful spot at night. It's definitely a great restaurant and I disagree with the reviews given so far. 

As far as price, I'm not very sure.
Since it was a work event I'm not sure how much our management paid. However I'm assuming it was affordable. The plates were small but after eating that four course meal I was definitely super full!! So it's worth it.

However my rating was not a 5 star due to he lack of customer service from the guy that brought out our food was a total asshole got In the middle of my boyfriend and I while we were having a conversation no excuse me or anything just start moving our stuff to put down our food and didn't not even introduce  himself not even one word until my boyfriend said  can you at least say excuse me his response was ""really"" and they started to go argue back and forth and this server had the nerve
To get in my bf face so unprofessional I don't know how people like that have jobs so disappointing it did ruin my dinner in a way because , customer service is a big thing for me just because I work in customer service for over 5 years now and I don't let that slide around me. other than that they took care of us the managers,the guy that took our order they were so nice & friendly .

Seared Ahi Tuna (mole verde + sesame crust)- This was an interesting texture; it was chewy and tender

Pork Sopes (chorizo + queso fresco)

Churros (cinnamon sugar + cajeta)- Bite size cinnamon sugar tossed churros, accompany by a cup of chocolate sauce for dipping

Sugar Cookie Sandwich (nutella + chocolate drizzle)- Nutella spread onto 2 cruchy white sugar cookie

Flan (vanilla bean custard + caramel sauce)- The flan was delish!  Texture was melt in your mouth

You have to buy chips and salsa, which is lame. I understand it's a tourist area and they don't want to give things away but if you're ordering meals and drinks, chips and salsa should be provided.

My wife asked for warm water for her sore throat. They came back with ice water. When we ordered lunch, my wife asked for vegetarian tacos. I asked for a tostada which the menu states comes with fries (see their menu online). The tacos come and the waitress (different than the waiter that took the order) says they are chicken. We told her we ordered vegetarian. She acted like she never heard that word in her life. The original waiter came by and she asked him and he confirmed that they were veggie. But then he said the beans have bacon in them. Why would you give someone bacon if they asked for a vegetarian meal? My meal did not come with fries, so I asked the waitress. She said that fries are extra. Then I went online and found their menu and showed her that it says comes with fries. She was perplexed so had her manager come by. I explained the situation and he said the menu was misleading (flat out wrong would have been a better phrase). So they got my wife black beans and offered us free fries. After my lunch was almost finished, the waiter came by (first and only time during the meal) and asked if we needed anything. I explained that we had not yet received the fries. He went back and finally we got them. When we got our bill, they tried to charge us for the black beans after they took away the beans with bacon. So again I told the waiter who went back and took the charge off. 

Because the food tasted fine I am giving two stars instead of one. The service was horrible. Do not come here.",2DDSzc1OxcL3rVIiHVMqtQ,0,0,2,Bhh9qMXcGiJ_BsD7CfaIWw

I work in a restaurant, I know what that's like.

I had the Pork Enchiladas, which were good but was nothing special compared to other enchiladas I've had. Fair amount of meat, which was soft and juicy, but the portion was overall pretty small and not worth $18. They didn't have enough condiments baskets or something, because in the middle of our meal, our server came and asked for it back. My friends ordered off the breakfast menu (french toast and breakfast skillet) which was a bit cheaper, but the food was still pretty average.

We're in Vegas for Super Bowl weekend. Had an awesome time Saturday night, woke up on Sunday without a hangover (yay!) and then went to Linq to watch the big game.  

We passed the Chayo cart and asked for a michelada. The guy told us we needed to go inside to the bar and they would make it for us. We went in and it wasn't that busy. Went up to the bar and ordered from the bartender. She SIGHED and looked very irritated that we ordered 2 micheladas. I asked her NICELY if there was a problem with us ordering that.  She said no and walked away. 

THEN, she came back and said (AND I QUOTE) ""Sorry for the sigh. People have been ordering those all day and I'm sick of making them. I want to make something else. Maybe I should make them taste awful that way I don't have to make them anymore."" What the Hell?!?!?!

I told her that the fact that she said that made us not want to order from her at all. She walked away muttering that she just ""won't make jokes all day"".  She was NOT joking. 

We didn't say anything to the management, but I'm still tripping out that she said that shit. 

We will NOT go back there.  Hopefully management will read this review and think twice about who they put at their bar. This girl's attitude was absolutely unacceptable and if I was the manager she would be fired.

Update: management reached out shortly after this review was posted. They offered for us to come back and have a round of drinks on them. Unfortunately, we were heading back to Cali that day.

Decided to order the Margaritas which were very tasty but not $14 tasty. I started off with their ""Yucca Fries"" for $8, here I am expecting a plate full of ""Brazilian Potato"" fries like the waiter explained. Nope, it was a tin can with about 4 or 5 REGULAR steak fries (Lol)  Anyways, I ordered the 3 cheese Quesadillas with green sauce and handmade tortillas (I think), they were just decent. Also ordered a torta that did not compare to the taco trucks in East LA. (Sigh) 

Overall, the food here is your typical Mexican dishes that honestly my mom would probably cook better. Although, I did hear the enchiladas were decent ($28).

I would probably not come back here, it just didn't wow me enough, and if I do I would probably hit the bar. Restaurant should really consider revising their menu and prices.

The staff is friendly but you could notice some are brand new and have never worked at a restaurant before. The bartenders are very friendly and make pretty good drinks. 

Probably because I am Mexican I expected more out of this place, but I guess nothing beats Mom's cooking.

1) had to walk up to the bar to place my food order since no one came to our table

2) took another 45 mins just to get chips and guacamole and chicken taquitos 

3) took another  30 mins to get our dinner which was taco plates. 

4)very tough dry pulled pork, super hard to chew. Mediocre rice and beans.

5) since it took so long, I browsed their yelp (something I should've done before hand) read a review that someone purchased a Groupon worth 50% off which seemed super ideal because I wasn't happy and honestly didn't want to pay full price at this point. I purchased the Groupon. Got the bill and was told by the waiter in fine print it reads can't be used on a holiday!! The holiday he was referring to was Martin Luther King Day on Monday!

We got the guacamole, mango and watercress salad, and chicken enchiladas. Their chips are crispy and have a nice spice to them, and the guacamole was buttery but not very flavorful. The salad was good, with a honey-mustard-like dressing, although there was too much of it. The enchiladas were disappointingly flavorless -- basically plain chicken in tortillas with a bland sauce over them and a few garnishes  like avocado slices and onion and radish slices (?).

Service was good enough.

We went back, the larger bar tables were full. A waitress saw us looking around, she was carrying dirty plates and said she would be right back. So we stood there, and stood there and stood there. Then walked over to the empty hostess stand. Then left again. 

Very frustrating, will never go back.",kL0McNj06l-REGz-vwQJgA,0,0,1,4Tpa61v-1w5qF5bUpCXAeQ

It was a good choice to dine in our hotel.  The only thing that went wrong was it was so windy that day and they insisted to keep the doors open.  Every time management would close the doors a server would open them. It made for a difficult dining experience.

Our food was wonderful and i was very pleased with my corn enchilada. 

The drink was ok.

The service was great.  He was on top of it the whole time.  The only hick up was the check out process.  It took forever!

The only awkward part was there was a lady there taking pictures of people and selling the photos.  It was weird for me.

I order a club sandwich, which was very filling. Their french fries had a little something in it that kept me from eating the whole serving even when I was too full to consume anymore. My mom ordered the chicken chayo burrito. The burrito had chicken, chayo beans, rice, and cheese with some chili sauce on top and it was very enjoyable. It was basically a spicy chicken burrito.

Last time we were here hubby had lobster tacos, that he absolutely loved and raved about them to our son.  So we stopped in last Friday night so that our son could try them for himself.  The NBA playoff game was on tv, so they had all the tv's on that channel (which was awesome, because the boys wanted to watch the game), but they had the volume up really loud.  It was busy, but there were still some empty tables and no wait to get in.  We didn't see the lobster tacos on the menu, which was ok, it was probably a special the last time we were here, no big deal.  We had a waitress stop by to say she'd be right with us.  We had already been seated for around 15 minutes....we waited another 15 minutes before deciding to just get a pizza and head up to the room to watch the game there.  

With it being so loud, no lobster tacos, and not really getting prompt service, it was easy for us to make the decision to leave.

1772140,2014-12-23,0,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"Okay, so maybe I've watched too many episodes of Bar Rescue and Restaurant Impossible. I can no longer enter a dining/drinking establishment without wondering what John Taffer or Robert Irvine might say about it. Unlike everywhere else in the world, in Las Vegas, it seems like if an establishment has enough foot traffic to keep the books above water, it doesn't really matter what they do, right or wrong. And in a location like The Linq, I would assume that Chayo has enough foot traffic from hapless unknowing tourists that they don't have to worry about doing everything (or anything) right, at least for a little while.

My friends and I, all locals, decided to brave the strip for a rare night on the town. The Linq seemed like a fun spot to eat and drink so we chose Chayo for dinner. No complaints about the service; it was fast, efficient and friendly (the fact that the waitress acted as if she'd never been asked to split a check notwithstanding). But I immediately found myself confused about the overall theme. Loved the colorful Mexican folk art masks that adorned the walls and the warm, dim lighting that set the stage for a chill dinner among friends. The music, on the other hand, set a different tone. Iggy Azalea and other dance pop artists boomed from the speakers, making it difficult to conversate without a lot of ""Huh?"" and ""I'm sorry, what?"" Maybe some people, particularly the partying, strip going crowd, are into that, so I can't judge them too harshly, but the selection seemed in stark contrast to the traditional Latin décor. Tapas plus Iggy...confusion. Tapas plus fun, flirty Latin tunes...awesome. 

Further confusing factors? A mechanical bull somewhat centered on the dining floor. Sure it was fun to watch some crazy folks get tossed unapologetically from the wild, fake bull, but it's not exactly what I'd call dining entertainment. On a trip to the bathroom, an incredibly drunk girl by the sink asked me, ""Are you going to ride the bull?"" ""No, not tonight."" ""C'mon, why not?"" She asks. Followed by, ""You're in Vegas!"" So, because I'm in Vegas I am required to indulge in every stupid gimmick they throw at me? Not to mention that getting whipped around like a ragdoll after filling my tummy with sangria, spicy salsa and cheesy enchiladas doesn't sound like a good time AT ALL.

And now let's talk about the food. I love tapas. I love, love LOVE tapas, because I can never decide what I want. Tapas gives me the opportunity, neigh, the RIGHT to taste everyone else's food. If you're definition of tapas is ""small"" plates, then they only sort of nailed it. In my experience, the great thing about a truly authentic tapas experience, is that each dish is just enough to taste and share, and the cost of each dish reasonably reflects what you get. Here's the thing; I had no idea Chayo was considered ""tapas"" style, because each dish was between $18 and $24. Perhaps I am incorrect in my estimations, but merely portioning out food in increments of four (4 tacos, 4 enchilades, 4 pieces of street corn) while still charging the same price as one would for a personal entrée, isn't truly tapas. That's more like what I'd call ""family style"", except there isn't enough for a whole family without completely busting your bank. 

Between my husband and I, we had chicken enchiladas and shrimp tacos. The enchiladas, 4 tiny hand made tortillas ""filled"" (I use the term filled loosely) with tasty meat and generously coated in a traditional red sauce. Good, but not outstanding. At first I thought I'd order the beer battered lobster tacos because it sounded good in theory, but then I thought, who in their right mind would beer batter and deep fry lobster? Is that a thing? Good, fresh lobster can stand up like a beacon of hope without much ado about nothing. Battering and deep frying feels like deception. Instead I opted for the grilled shrimp tacos. Again, four soft corn taco shells stuffed with a generous amount of shrimp, very lightly seasoned and cooked quite nicely. The tacos came with a side of creamy pinto beans seasoned with bacon and a dollop of forgettable rice. The standout on the plate was the side of beans. Was it bad? No. But for $18 each, I expected, if not a larger portion, a more immaculate flavor. And how can I forget Sangria. I can easily kill a pitcher of good Sangria on my own, but opted to share a $32 pitcher with some friends. Tapas, right? The pitcher, 80% ice was enough for about 4 glasses. Deep glasses, yes, but glasses that were also 80% full of ice. I only drank 1 glass. Why? Because it tasted like it came from a premixed bottle. No chunks of apple or other fruit. Just ice and watered down flavored wine...deeply disappointing. 

Ultimately, like most restaurants on the strip (save those run by the big wigs), Chayo is a lot of hype, loud music and party it up vibe. For food and drinks? Save your money for the food trucks downtown, where the focus is on the food and not the drunken idiot on the mechanical bull",DHqCXVeOkQ10hZlfGnZEEA,0,0,2,4-0cy5h9Q1sSPDv_HXWgog

Disgusting service! I ordered a champagne when we first sat down. I didn't get it until after my meal which took over an hour. I complained and reminded her several times.

Before I go on with my resto review: I want to commend the management here. In general, you have to wait 24 hrs after purchase before using a groupon voucher. We asked if we could use it within hour of purchase and the manager, Brandon, agreed. I was so happy. He also ensured to drop by regularly to see that my friends and I were happy with the service and food. We got free whiskey shots, which was very thoughtful.

There was a cool terrace outside but because it was cold we asked to be  seated inside. The venue was very large and had a neat fake bull to ride in the center. It was entertaining to watch people bull ride, especially during the local rodeo. 

Food: For appetizers we ordered the guacamole and chips (4/5)- the guac was very smooth and creamy and was a decent portion to share with all; chipotle wings (3/5) these were spicy! no joke when a title reads chipotle you better like a kick for an aftertaste. We ordered a pitcher of their lime margerita which was delicious. Four our main course: we had the portbello mushroom and filet mignon fajitas (5/5) They came with 3 warmly wrapped tortillas, mexican rice, and sides to garnish. Both were very filling. Unfortunately, I had no room for dessert!

It's nice to see a business that is so accommodating to their clients, makes the trip on the strip all the more worthwhile. 5 stars.",g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,7,4,5,vWr176ubIS43UsYtYB879Q

We didn't want to have a big meal, so we ordered a side of nachos.  We should have ordered a half of what we go.  The order was MASSIVE!  Great for anyone that loves nachos.  Only complaint I have, the guacamole was an up charge if you wanted it, which I was kind of disappointed since the item was kind on the high side as it is.  But then again, everywhere you go, the up charge you on the guacamole if you want it.  So nothing out of the ordinary.

The menu from what I could tell was on the ""$$ to $$$"" on the price range.  Which again, any restaurant in any casino on the Las Vegas Strip, this is very common!  So expect that if you come here.

The Atmosphere was great.  Noise was about average while we were there however, they had a mechanical bull in the middle of the floor!  lol  So...yeah...I'm sure the Happy Hours at this place can become quite lively!  LOL  Also, I would like to compliment them on their booths, very comfy and roomy.  

Our server was pretty helpful and polite. However we did have to wait for about 10 minutes to be greeted at a time when they might have had 10 patrons in the entire restaurant.  It was odd because when you arrived, there wasn't a hostess where you think there would be.  After 10 minutes, we thought maybe they do a self-seating kind of deal for after hours!  

This place is located in Harrahs, free parking....

Overall, I would give this place another chance.  Nothing that really stood out that would make or break this place at this time.  Next time will have to try an entree.",FLPtqdwODTFrcSuGg7PJ8Q,0,1,3,Gdiyotj4wGdKkqCspnMntQ

My family are big Vegas people! We go to Las Vegas at least twice a year & with each visit, we've gone we've longed for a place where we could dance to Latin music. Now, mind you, we don't live in LA/Cali where Vegas is a hop skip and a long drive away; this is our haven from the monotony of our respective towns that don't have active nightlife scenes.  

One day we happened upon this place and it for we changed our Saturday night! We had purchased a groupon not even piecing two and two together... we stopped for a happy hour which 1) resulted in the Groupon instantly being not worth it and 2) is hardly ever heard of on the strip! A few buckets of coronitas, a marg or 2 and several apps later and we were on our way. Fast forward to 10 PM and the sounds of Selena and Daddy Yankee brought us in! I don't remember them charging a cover but that's not to say things haven't changed. The dance floor was moved upstairs the last time we stopped by and I'd be disappointed if they did away with the music! We go back just for that!",CPwVXyHnGk8D3ebKW77QtA,0,0,4,t30a69e2SoFiSheGAwnXSA

I was disappointed on how long service took the first day as the dining room was very slow, and the bar had around 9 people at it. Upon sitting down and ordering drinks and appetizers we did not receive our drinks until 20 minutes later and our chips and queso app took around 30 minutes to come out. Thirty minutes on a app like that is horrendous, Upon receiving the app finally we did not receive chips but ended up with soft taco shells? Wow.

Upon waiting another 10 minutes on our server it took 15 minutes to just get chips with that and they were flavorless with no seasoning or anything. The best way to describe the taste is close to cardboard. The queso with the chips was also just bland and disgusting and really dry and cold prior to us recieiving our chips.

Moving onto our second visit we just had margaritas which were OK and I would honestly get them again. Still waited around 10min just to get them tho. Our third visit I was still in disappointment as well due to the fact that we received chicken tacos that were shredded but were tender, dry and cold at the same time. If you work in a kitchen I feel like they have been sitting in a deep third and not stirred around to keep proper temperature. I also ended up getting a side of Fry's that were meh, they need more seasoning.

Ending my review if you are looking for margaritas, Chayo is a decent place. Food wise it will be hit or miss.",IacUwFZzlrZ9kaH93_Ezyw,1,0,3,jz_ZyJd0OfDdM9ILtcAQIw

Lots of places to eat but let hubby pick and he wanted Mexican.  It's not Mexican in the sense of the word that we normally in the US think of that type of food.  While they have tacos and typical sounding food, it's anything but typical.

We went twice while we were in Vegas, the first night by accident, the second was planned.  First night both of us had tacos.  Hubby had lobster tacos which had a deep fried batter and came with rice and beans.  He said they were really good and since there were three of them he was a happy camper.  I had grilled shrimp tacos, yummy as well.  Knew I couldn't eat all the tacos so ate one with the tortilla and the other two I ate the filling out of them.   We also got guacamole which was amazing.  It has pomegranate seeds which sounds strange but is really really good.  Many different types of margaritas yum.  One of the best I'd had lately.

Second time we went back we decided to try enchiladas.  Hubby got pork and I got sweet corn.  Even though the tortillas are smaller than what you buy in the store and I'm thinking are home made, the dishes all come with four enchiladas and neither one of us could eat all our meal, especially since we had more guacamole.

We ordered margaritas and when they came, they literally tasted horrible.  We called the server over, she tasted one and wrinkled her nose.  Apparently the bartender who made them was new and didn't know his stuff.  She went to a different bartender and got us new drinks and said she had the new bartender pour a bit in a cup so she could taste and make sure it was all it was supposed to be.

A friend mentioned she wanted to go to Chayo for Latin night. I'm not big on the whole club scene, I like to stick to bars so I said why not. Latin night is every Friday from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., which is lame, last time I checked we were in Las Vegas, not Los Angeles. 

So, we get in, there's a decent amount of people, there were tables all around the ""dance floor"", It looks like they just pushed dining tables to the side to make room for people to dance. There is a DJ, he played everything, from reggaeton, bachata, and salsa, towards the end of the night, he started playing corridos, that was our cue to leave.The mechanical bull is up and running if you want to ride it, but you have to take off your shoes. Bartenders are on the slow side, it took me 15 minutes to order and receive my drink, I ordered a sex on the beach, it had more juice than alcohol in it, you could barely taste it, on top of that it cost $11, I thought that was pretty hefty for a bar that literally served me juice. This is coming from a girl that's a lightweight, give me one sex on the beach and I'm usually quite tipsy. This drink did nothing.

I don't think I'll be visiting Chayo again. I didn't really enjoy my experience.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,8,6,2,fUD8kzdNdDB9b6IlWEFHCA

It had almost a dive bar feel to me as it was a very small enclosure, but with it being NFL Sunday it did seem to house quite the mass of people..Atmosphere wise it was certainly popping, but a draw back for me was the street performers to the right from the flamingo charging pictures with a parrot..Can't say hearing those things squawk through the entire meal makes me feel like a high roller!

Foodwise I was sold on the lobster tacos..They came out in a quantity of 3 and more towards street taco size, but I did find them to be well worth it..The lobster itself came battered and fried which oddly enough worked for me and the tortilla itself did have a light feel to it and I wasn't left heavy as the meal concluded

Our server seemed a bit off though as his one liners were met with crickets and he didn't take too kindly to us not wanting to try the specials of the night..He wasn't quite his joking self when I passed on ordering the highly recommended chicken or steak burrito..It was almost as if I was in an abusive relationship and not allowed to order for myself when it came down to it

My family and I came yesterday for dinner and accidentally walked into the restaurant without a hostess' lead, but only because they werent at the front helping anyone..... Let it be known there were two of these air headed twats. After being literally dragged back outside by one of the clueless waiters, we were introduced to the hostesses (who seem to have some kind of eye kink to work out because they kept rolling their eyes) who told us to wait 30 fucking minutes for a table. We asked them why we couldn't be seated since the restaurant was half full, and they replied with a ""LOOK WE CAN'T SEAT YOU RIGHT NOW OKAAAYYY?!?!"" (Insert eye kink/roll)..... Right after yelling at us, they proceeded to ignore us like air and continued their non-work related conversation.

I told the waiter it wasn't what I ordered so she proceeded to look at her book, I know what I ordered why try and argue with a customer. 
My food arrives about 10 min later. She walks off. Literally, about 20 minutes go by my friends and I are thirsty and she is no where to be found. So I that to get up myself and go ask for water. Really!

Pros:  good margarita and good guacamole
Cons:  The carne asada burrito had too much rice and the meat was over cooked and dry.  The short rib tacos were a disappointment.  It wasn't really ""tacos"".  It was a mound of meat with corn tortillas on the side, not fried or dipped in hot oil.  The rice was bland and the refried beans were not only bland but tasted like they were canned refried beans.

We wanted to have a great view of the ferris wheel and chose Chayo because they have a balcony area and considering the only other bar open that night with a balcony was Yardhouse, which we've been to a dozen times in Town Square.

I must say the look and atmosphere of Chayo is really wonderful. It's whimsical and inviting from the outside, and once you enter there is a mechanical bull in the center of the restaurant. We ended up at the bar to wait for seating on the balcony. There was a bartender there who was phenomenal. I didn't catch his name but he was older. He was incredibly nice and informative. The hostesses, server, and even our busser were all wonderful, as well. The food being served looked good and smelled even better while we waited, so I was excited to try it!

UNFORTUNATELY.

This was an incredibly MUNDANE mexican food experience. The food was so bland. It was definitely edible, don't get me wrong, but I payed $18 for really blah chicken enchiladas. The guy sitting next to me at the bar had ordered them and they looked wonderful so thats why I chose them. 

So. Much. Regret. I also got the $8 INCREDIBLY TINY tortilla soup which was basically tomato water. It honestly looks like it comes in a shot glass. The chips they served tasted great and the salsa was ok, nothing special. My boyfriend even said we should have just stuck to our local Super Burrito! Ugh. The only thing making up for the food was the view. 

I wanted to give this place a try because for some bizarre reason I thought it'd be different than a few other mexican strip restaurants, but no, I was so, so wrong. The price isn't really the issue, I ALWAYS expect to pay absurd amounts for food/drink when I come to the strip.

Given that Chayo is located at the heart of Las Vegas Blvd, prices will be up the ying yang but the food quality does not match the price. NO COMPLIMENTARY chips or salsa. It's $3 per order. $9 if you want guac and chips. I know it may no biggie for some if you gotta pay for chips/salsa. This may be overlooked IF the food was good. 
But it wasn't. It was bland. Three small enchiladas plate was like $18. I ordered tilapia and let me tell you....for those who are health conscientiousness, trying to watch their calorie intake, trying to watch their cholesterol....FORGET ABOUT IT. You would think tilapia is good for you but nope! They put so much salt on that fish, I thought I was going to bloat with every bite I take. Over-salted it.....what a poor decision from the chef.

I don't know what Chayo is trying to be....are they trying to be a restaurant? A bar? A nightclub-ish lounge? The reason I said that was they have such LOUD top 40s, club music playing. I was practically yelling across the table to talk to my boyfriend!!!! Before you judge me and say I'm probably too old or boring since ""loud music"" bothers me, how would you like it if you're trying to eat and you hear Pitbull telling you to ""forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room"" or Flor Rida telling you he's on an elevator and on the ""second floor...got stuck on a hoodrat..."" *rolls eyes* I'm sorry but that's not what I want to hear while trying to eat my meal. Or take the volume down a notch...or even three if they still want to continue to play that kind of music.

Service was a hot-mess that night. (Went on a Monday for dinner around mid Feb.) We had 3 different waiters/waitresses coming up to our table throughout the night. First, they can't make up their minds who was our designated waiter. We kept on getting asked for our drink orders from multiple waiters when we ordered it already. And just an observation, it seemed like none of the waiters knew which table ordered what. A couple times, different entrees and appetizers were brought to our table and it was NOT what we ordered. I saw them scurrying around trying to find out who ordered the salad. Were they ALL training that night or something? It was also a pretty windy night and even though we were sitting inside, we still felt the wind because they had the doors wide open. And common sense....wouldn't it be smart to close the doors when you see paper napkins, receipt papers and paper trash flying all around the room!? Come on now.  We left Chayo completely disappointed. I can't believe I settled on this place for dinner. -__- What a waste.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,8,3,2,tBt84udlESxo_wKiYI92HQ

It wasn't until a friend made a complaint to our waiter, who relayed the frustration to the kitchen, that we received some chips and guacamole to try and hold us over until we received our meal. More than an hour later our food finally arrived. Too bad some of our party was either past the hunger or too full from eating chips that they couldn't eat their actually meal, and for the rest, too full from eating too fast because we were so hungry!

As for the food, I had the fish tacos and chicken nachos that was shared. The fish tacos was the worst I ever had! It was too dry, too hard, and too overcooked! No flavor at all! The chicken nachos was just okay, there wasn't anything special about them. Food all around was awful, but our party was so hungry that they just ate their dinner anyways. Also, since it was nearly midnight by the time we got our checks, it was too late to try to get food anywhere else before going out for the bachelorette party. 

This was a terrible experience to begin our night out for my cousin's bachelorette, and really out a damper on everyone's mood and night.",rJd9uGQM_rISjwb6sk-Hgw,2,0,1,7IiRpjZlp4BkzfCf-ZCK0w

It was easy to make a reservation in advance and when we arrived we were seated right away at a great booth that was both quiet and away from the bar, which we requested. Our servers (one was overseeing, one was shadowing) were both attentive and wonderful. The music was fantastic and I found myself singing along to almost everything! The servers and the kitchen were all respectful of my cilantro allergy-- our server even went as far as taking a plate of fajita fixings away from me when she saw that the kitchen had put pico on it (I was just going to eat from the other side of the plate since it's not hard severe) and making the kitchen replace it. And the best part was obviously the food! I had the queso to start, which was delicious. It had real melted cheese in it, which made it stringy and comforting, but it wasn't too spicy and had a great flavor. And my fajitas (which had to be substituted with chicken from another dish because their fajita chicken is marinated in cilantro-- something our server knew off of the top of her head when I ordered, which really impressed me because that never would have even crossed my mind) were great! They came with half an ear of loaded corn, which was so good that my husband ordered another side of it,  some to eat there and some to take home with us. I'm not sure what kind of orange sauce they put on it (chipotle mayo, perhaps?) but it was to die for! The only thing that didn't impress me was their dessert menu (brownie sundae, tres leches, flan, or bread pudding), but that was fine with me because dinner didn't leave much room for anything sweet!

The decor of the restaurant is very impressive and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money to every detail.  The restaurant has a great feel and is a fun place to dine.

When we arrived it was very busy but was seated immediately very close to the mechanical bull.  Although the bull was not running (i assume it starts later) you can tell it must be a center point of the restaurant/bar later on in the evening.

Everyone in my party loved the food and the presentation.  At my table people ordered the lobster tacos (recommendation of the server) and everyone loved them.  I ordered the ribeye steak that was cooked perfect and another person ordered the fajitas.  The size of the fajitas was large and he said it was full of flavor and very filling.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is around the strip that wants to try a unique experience for a mexican restaurant.  With a great location we went and walked through the linq project before heading home.",ARqg88FmQ8UHYHthjUwXAw,0,0,4,Iy4KyGIOg2E4i-0LmoqzSA

We started off with the salsa, guacamole and chips. All were fresh and tasty. For my entrée, I had the shrimp ceviche. Shrimp, fresh jalapeno, tomato, onion in lime juice, Delicious from the 1st to last bite. Other items ordered were the chipotle wings - a little heat and tasty, the chopped salad - great flavor and the carne asada burrito. So big, you may want to split it. The margaritas were tasty and the beer was cold. Our waitress was great checking on us often. No complaints. We all enjoyed it and were excited to find another Mexican restaurant in town that we liked. We thought the prices were reasonable too.

So I went to Purple Zebra and got a giant frozen drink that Vegas is known for. However my mom was hungry. After a nice host outside said it was cool to bring in my extra alcohol we were seated. 

I have to say the margarita, for being at a Mexican restaurant, was a major fail. It was just bad. Even though the waiter was really nice about taking it back and replacing it with a different margarita. The second margarita was bad too. So just avoid margaritas.

But everything else was amazing.

You know how you can eat something and taste love? Well the carnitas tacos I had tasted like love. Just ooey gooey flavorful love. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.. #idied So. Freaking. Good. I also had rice. Green rice. That kinda looked like throw up. But if you close your eyes and open your mouth you'll be taken on a journey.

2697851,2018-02-24,0,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"Pay cash if you dare to go here, because they tried to steal my friend's credit card. BLATANTLY. Take the time to read this trust me. 

We were there a couple of weeks ago on business, visiting from out of state. We got there for breakfast about 9 am, and we're done eating around 10am. The food was ok. We had no alcohol, so it's not like we were unaware of what was happening. My friend had went to the restroom while they were running our card to pay for the meal. While he was gone, the manager, Chris, came by with the receipt and asked me several questions that caught me off guard (distracting me) about who I was and what we had just ordered. My friend came back and signed, without realizing they didn't put the credit card back in the holder. 

By the time we had walked a few blocks down the strip, he realized it was missing. We immediately called Chayo. I explained calmly what happened, and they put me on hold to speak to the manager. The same girl picked up the phone, and said they didn't see our card. It was only about 30 seconds, so they clearly didn't even look. I asked if she could ask our server if he accidentally left it somewhere or ""accidentally"" put it in his pocket. They had conveniently ""sent him home for the day""... weird. It's 10 in the morning and you're done working for the day? When I asked for them to call him, we were told he doesn't have a cell phone... really?? 

We tell them we're coming back, because we hadn't gone anywhere else and we knew it was there somewhere. As it was clear they made zero effort to even make it seem like they were looking for our card, several other suspicious responses were given, so we were very alarmed and put a hold on the credit card immediately.

We called back and got the manager on the phone finally. He began dropping f-bombs for no reason to my friend, swearing they didn't have our f****** credit card. We told him we were bringing back a police officer and hung up. 

As we were about a minute away and had already spoke to a cop, we brought a security guard with us that was kind enough to assist us when we explained what happened. We received a phone call back from the manager (Chris) who said ""I found your f****** card in the trash and was I tempted to not call you back""... WHAT?? Eh.. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? 
We had done nothing wrong, nothing to deserve this behavior. The security guard wisely instructed us to stay calm and just get the card back, then deal with it above his head later. Hi Chris! :) There's no telling what he lied to his boss about this whole situation...

So anyways, when we showed up, Chris the manager came out, handed us our (now cancelled credit card, which messed up our trip, as well as many other business expenses by the way). He then had the AUDACITY to tell us we were banned from the restaurant and to never contact them again. LOL. As if we would EVER want to eat there again after this happened. He doesn't want us around anymore because he was caught. 

So to recap, we ate at Chayo, they ""threw our credit card in the trash"" and we aren't welcome to eat at this extremely poorly managed restaurant anymore. That's just too bad, seeing as there are only a couple of places to eat in Las Vegas..... WHAT. A. JOKE.

I'm mainly writing this review to warn other guests, and warn Caesars entertainment that they need to look into this for clearly attempted credit card theft. There should be no scenario where you give a restaurant your credit card and they throw it in the trash after running it. So either somehow that happened, or it was in Chris's pocket and he panicked when we weren't going to leave it alone and told him we were coming back. I'm thinking it was in Chris's pocket. 

Chris should be fired for the way he talked to my friend ALONE!!!! For the way he handled the situation, and none the less trying to steal our credit card and then lying to our faces about it. Extremely inappropriate and unnecessary. 

My friend has already been in touch with someone at Caesars Entertainment because they own Chayo's. I just wanted to make sure something is done here. We would have filed a police report if we were in town long enough to do so. That's how certain we are that he is a criminal. I'm sure we reacted like anyone else would have if their credit card had gone missing and we knew where it was. 

Fire your ""manager"" Chris, Caesars and I guarantee the customer service satisfaction will improve. Do it before he tries this with someone else.",6l9IZxRRcR_GpPOUOe_b2w,2,0,1,LwVOzDOkeWz8AqDbS1vV4A

The food was just okay.  Not bad but not that great either.

As a manager myself,  I believe management is the core problem here.  Great location with a great visual appeal but staff looks overwhelmed and confused.  Saw no manager which is odd for not seeing on a large table.  And there was ours and another next to us.  Improvements in management needs to happen in my opinion.

The ""mini"" nachos were huge and fed our whole group of 8+ people. They were so good that we ordered another round. Then the taquitos were like something sent down from heaven - I think they were pork carnitas, super juicy and flavorful. Now the not so great... the margaritas tasted like straight up sickly sweet margarita mix, barely any tequila. I get that it's a $5 happy hour special, but if you're calling yourself a tequila bar I would hope to at least taste some tequila in there. I ended up pouring almost half of a Coronita in the margarita just to cut the sweetness. (The Coronitas were a better bet - can't really pass them up for $1.)

Restrooms are upstairs but don't worry they also have an elevator you can use to get up there if needed. They also have an upstairs area with dinning, patio, and a bar. Downstairs in the center they do have an electronic bull to get your ride on or be entertained by those who challenge the bull.

It was hopping because of how many people from the conference that were there, so service took a bit. Can't complain too much because we enjoyed the drinks and the scenery.

I asked the girl at the podium outside for a table inside and she told us to go see the hostess inside the doors. It just seems a bit redundant to have two spots. I guess she was the patio hostess. The interior is nice, seating was comfortable and service was quick, friendly and informed. Chips and salsa are not complimentary. The salsa was ok but I did not like the seasoning on the chips. It was similar to seasoned salt, not for me. The guacamole was overpriced and under flavored at, I think $9 but it had pomegranate seeds which was a nice touch and came with pork rinds, which was also good. The caesar salad had good dressing and a decent portion. Mahi Mahi tacos were on the dry side. The waiter asked how my tacos were and when I mentioned that they were a little dry, he comped them.

The restaurant is located in the heart of the Linq walk way just across the street from Brooklyn Bowl. Its a pretty big place complete with three bars, an upstairs lounge and even a mechanical bull. 

The menu is pretty standard Mexican fare: nachos, enchiladas, fajitas, tacos and the like. Nothing really stood out and I was surprised that they didn't offer free chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant in town. We started off with the chicken nachos which were just plain awful and I mean like Taco Bell status but at $17 a plate. Gas station liquid nacho cheese, dry shredded chicken, and the paltry squirts of sour cream had me begging our server for some house salsa in order to add some flavor to the dish. 

We should have just asked for the check at this point but we were in the mood for making bad decisions and ordered even more food. Our next dish, the surf & turf taco platter proved that disappointment can come from both the land and sea. The Carne Asada was nothing but beef flavored fat paired with some dry Spanish rice and canned food refried beans. The shrimp was not fresh at all and didn't go well with any of the other fillings. 

We topped off our night with the most traditional of Mexican desserts: bread pudding with ice cream. (why is this an option here but fried ice cream or churros are not??) This was the best dish we had but simply not worth returning for. 

Overall I would never come back here. There are much better Mexican restaurants in town (none of which are on the Strip btw).",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,0,0,2,Q0pxZX1pvciIcA8Zn5yulg

I had changed places once already because the door was open which in turn caused it to be quite cold.  When they sat down she became quite vile in her demeanor.  I had enough and had to challenge her and bring some self awareness of her behavior and actions to light...I apologized that my family was bigger and that her behavior was uncalled for I attempted to educate her but she only grew more upset eventually I apologized for her unhappiness and left.

The prefix is when they give you a choice of only a few dinners. My partner had veggie enchiladas and I had chicken soft tacos. Her enchiladas were stuffed with butternut squash and we're so insipidly sweet they were almost inedible. My tacos were served on a rack and the corn tortillas had been steamed. As a result, the bottoms fell totally apart when I try to pick them up so I had to eat my tacos on the plate with a fork. Now I think the most frustrating part about having a ""prefix"", was the fact that they would not bring us any extra of the usual condiments in a Mexican restaurant. I asked the waiter before the meal came out if we could have a little extra salsa, he looked at me in a very puzzled manner and never did answer me and never did bring any salsa. In fact when I had my initial salad I asked a server for pepper. Again I never even got pepper! We even offered to pay for chips and salsa and again got that puzzled look from the waiter. The food was average, but I like to hold my taco in my hand and my partners food was so one note and sweet that some salsa would help to elevate it or even a long time.

Time: Late lunch

Ambiance: Tasteful Día de Muertos theme.

Crowd: Better dressed tourists, and disproportionately appreciative Hispanics.

Menu: Americanized Mexican

Service: Friendly and attentive, but was presented a dirty spoon and a drink was delayed.

Food Ordered: Ceviche shrimp, sopas, diablo shrimp, and a mojito.

Food Quality: The ceviche tasted wonderful and made me forget that there was no fish.  The sopas were delicate, delicious, and lasted mere seconds on my plate.  The diablo shrimp huge in portion and the spiciest thing I have tasted in weeks.  Sadly, the flavor was not quite up to the heat.  Finally, the mojito was refreshing, but a little light on the alcohol.    

Value: Not cheap, but a fair price for a great meal.

There were vintage orange cushion leather booths and wooden tables surrounding a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant was decorated with hollow lights, colorful skulls, crosses, and prints of bulls. 

The drinks especially the Piña Colada and Sangria were very strong! The Piña Colada, which consisted of rum, pineapple juice and coconut cream, tasted like medicine due to excessive rum. I asked them to make a lighter and more sweet version of it. The second was better than the first. The Sangria consisted of red wine, brandy, and fresh fruit juices. They were garnished with strawberry and orange. 

For appetizers, I'd recommend the Guacamole (and tortilla chips), Yucca Fries, Botana Platter, and Caesar Salad. The Guacamole dip consisted of fresh avocado, diced onions, parsley, and garnished with pomegranate seeds. Some of the tortilla chips were seasoned with spices. The Yucca Fries were deep fried, thickly cut yucca. The Botana Platter consisted of two mini pork chorizo and black bean sopes topped with radish, two crispy corn, poblano pepper, and cheese empanadas, and two chicken, cheese, shredded lettuce, and sour cream gorditas. The Caesar Salad consisted of fresh romaine lettuce and parmesan cheese tossed in a creamy anchovy dressing. The other guests in our party ordered Beer Battered Lobster Tacos and Sweet Corn Enchiladas. The Lobster Tacos, which came in 3 and consisted of beer battered lobster, beans, red cabbage, and topped with chipotle mayo. The Sweet Corn Enchiladas which came in 4, consisted of sweet corn, cheese, green peppers, and mushrooms, and topped with cascabel sauce, sour cream, and chives.

So j would recommend going back to this place because their food is really good and they have taken steps to improve their service. You can see my previous visit below that they made up for.

When we received our water it was served to us in plastic cups with no ice for dinner at 9:30pm. When we asked the manager she told us it was because they can't have people stealing their glassware with the night crowd. Didn't know we looked like we were going to steal anything, especially since we were sitting down for dinner and the two tables that sat down behind us got regular glassware. Then I asked for a margarita, which was served water down horribly and wit no salt which he ran off before he could even ask me if I wanted it. Then out meal came out before our table side guacamole which I server was serving himself. Not to mention he have it to us without chips or anything. I guess you are supposed to eat it with a fork. Then it took forever to find our server again just to get out of the place. Never felt so unwanted in a restaurant before. Even the manager didn't care.

Our server came over to greeted us right away and was super nice and pleasant the whole night. He took really good care of us.

For dinner I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Again, they were okay, nothing special and the chicken was kind of dry. 

This restaurant has a good ambiance and a fun atmosphere but the food is mediocre at best. If you're looking for some really good Mexican food in Vegas, look elsewhere.

We were looking for a quick bite to eat and this place looked decent. It's cute, if you're just looking for a drink. But the food is awful. Que horrible. The tortillas used in the tacos were some of the most bland, stiff tortillas I've ever had. The meats - we had both the ribeye and carnitas - were not good either. The ribeye was tough and had this weird sauce rubbed on it. The carnitas didn't have much flavor. The best part of our meal was the mango and watercress salad.

We sat at the bar and one of our friends who was there earlier and ordered before me didn't even get her food. When she asked the server about it, she acted as if the long wait was not a big deal and simply said ""the kitchen must be really backed up right now."" Seriously?!? WTF. The place, by the way, was not packed at all. It was Sunday, probably around 7:30 pm.

We ordered a few appetizers to start which were the ceviche and the queso. The ceviche was ehhh ok- 3 stars. It was really thick and needed a little more spice to it. The queso was great! We really enjoyed that. It came with only 4 small tortillas- it needed to have more because of the amount of queso you receive. For dinner my friend and I shared the carnitas tacos. They were decent/ the rice and beans that came with it were very bland- definitely not home made. Two of our other friends got the lobster tacos and the steak quesadilla.

We were sat right away and greeted with ice waters (which was amazing given it was 109° that day) and chips and salsa. 
The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. The salsa had a good kick and the chips had a spicy seasoning and a nice crunch. 
We ordered their guac and pork rinds to start with. The portion of guac for the price was just sad. Like a baby scoop of ice cream. Totally a bummer because it was decent! Had a nice little tang to it from the pomegranate seeds and paired with the pork rinds made it very unique.
The boys ordered fish and carnitas tacos. The carnitas were bland and dry. The fish tacos, as per the Hubs, ""were solid."" 
I had the Avocado Corn Chopped Salad which was full of flavor and texture. It had hearts of palm and cactus- two of my favorite Latin food flares. I ordered it with chicken, but it would've been better with a different meat option.

FOOD: 
Filet Steak Nachos $19 :On the menu it said enough for two, but when it came out "" MAN"" it's big enough for 4 people. The flavor was great, but the filet steak was pain and wasn't season  or wasn't season enough!  

Beer Battered Lobster Tacos  $19: I was disappointed with this dish. The presentation was nice and everything ,but the star of the dish the lobster was way over cook . It was super dry and chewy. The chipotle mayo they put on was very good tho.

Mexican corn was yummy and serving size is 3 half ears...perfect to share with 2 others at your table.

The food was very decent, I had a large party of 18 and no one walked away loving their plate. What I can say if the coconut margarita was delicious! But when it came to paying the waiter never told us that we would not be able to split the checks! So being a retired waitress myself I broke it down for everyone and the waiter could not figure it out! Than he tells me we can only use 3 cards, which even though I was frustrated with I said fine. So I collected cash from everyone so we would specifically have 3 cards. Spent an hour there after dinner just trying to process payments because the waiter kept messing up. He had to bring me 4 different checks because again he kept messing up. Overall it was a very frustrating experience. My recommendation is that when customers call to reserve seating for larger parties than 8 you specifically tell them about your payment and splitting checks rules. This allows time for everyone to be prepared upon arrival! Not wait until after dinner to tell us. Considering I booked over a week in advance. Once we finally got out, a few days later my friend called me to tell me she had a $600 charge on her credit card from the restauraunt which was completely impossible because I paid the remaining balance at the end of $388 on my credit card! And lastly we asked to sing happy birthday for 2 people. The waiter brought out 2 desserts than charged us for both of them.

There is no dance floor and this is not a club so I thought it was total bs. 2nd, the food was horrible and totally overpriced. 3rd, we got 2 flights of patron tequila shots and I really doubt they actually gave us patron. I've been a bartender and it tasted more like cheap bottom shelf tequila. And it took like 30 minutes to get our drinks even though it was not crowded at all. 3 plates of tacos and 2 flights of crappy tequila cost $120. Rip off.

The menu had standard americanized Mexican food. We opted for steak fajitas ($25), 3 mini lobster tacos ($12) side of cilantro rice ($5) and a Puncho Villa jalapeno tequila mixed drink ($14). The fajitas were okay - IMO they should have come with rice - which was better than the fajitas. The ""lobster"" tacos should be relabeled as batter fried bits with lobster flavor. Absolutey awful.

We made an OpenTable reservation, and we were seated promptly around 6:45PM. Waters arrived almost immediately, and our waitress could not have been nicer or more attentive. She gave us honest and useful information regarding the drink and dinner menus. We ordered the guacamole & chips for a shared app - it had the unexpected and delicious touch of fresh pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top.

Our dinners were delicious and beautifully presented. No one had a single complaint and thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered.

The reason for giving it only three stars is based on a single thing: the noise level was so high we couldn't speak to each other across the table. The music was mostly pop, not what you'd expect in a Mexican resto. I can easily forgive that, but the base on the audio system was turned up so high that your body vibrated from it. That made for an extremely uncomfortable dining experience. I even asked our waitress if it were possible to turn down the base; she asked the manager, who said it was automatically turned up after a certain time and could do nothing about it. Really?  Had we been there at 10PM I could understand, but not only is it not a dance club, but it was what I'd consider rather early for thumper music. They had multiple business parties there at the same time, who seemed to be focused just on eating, since they couldn't talk.

Due to the noise alone, I couldn't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, I would not return unless they consider turning the base line multiple notches during the dining hours.

Went on Cinco de Mayo without a reservation, so wasn't terribly surprised when they said it was a 45-min wait for a table for two. No big deal, since you could get drinks at the bar while waiting. 

Here's where the disappointment starts:
-We realize that there were two different ""waiting lists"" started so they had to merge them together and guess when people actually had their names put down, ADDING to the wait time. 
-Apparently they don't have buzzers to hand out or take numbers to text your table is ready, so unless you were standing 3 feet away from the hostess desk there's a good chance you would miss your name being called. 
-When we finally did get seated, the music (from a live DJ) was SO obnoxiously loud that we LITERALLY had to yell at each other to hear. We asked not only our waitress but one of the front desk helpers if it was at possible to turn the music down or give our table to someone else and take the next table called...she said they couldn't. 

So, we left.

Our experience was absolutely horrible. The restaurant wasn't as packed as we anticipated (for being St. Patty's day). When we sat, we waited a bit to be served. We placed our drinks order. We waited like 20 min for them to be delivered. We finally placed our food order and it took forever to arrive as well. We ordered chicken, fried fish, and lobster tacos to start and they were all pretty bland and simple. Definitely not worth the price. When we got our tacos, we ordered some hot sauce to make them a little tasty. They took so long to bring the hot sauce that we finished every single one of our tacos!! When someone finally brought the hot sauce, they just dropped it off quickly and they even forgot to take the wrapper off! So WE had to do that. Thanks! Great service! 

We constantly had empty plates on our table. The busser would take so long to clear our table that we had glasses of beer stacked on top of each other. 

Every time that we would order a beer, it would literally take 20 min to get it. So be aware of this! 

When we finished eating the tacos (starters) the busser was already setting the table for dessert when we didn't even order our main course. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas as a main course and they were extremely greasy. Wish we had just gone straight to dessert instead.

4225751,2014-04-27,1,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,It's a beautiful restaurant in a fun location but the food was not good. The margaritas were Ok but overpriced.  I had tacos and they were very small. You get 3 in an order but they do not allow you to mix and match. Why? I would have liked that option and most (if not all?) Mexican restaurants allow that. My husband ordered fajitas and they were also not good.  There was a large grilled onion on top which was weird. Are you supposed to make a fajita with a big piece of onion then have no onion left for the rest?? He didn't think the meat (what little there was) was very good either. Next time we go to the linq we'll try some place else. There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.,0QnLdePEyIYLGDdUrc1g1g,7,2,1,Zm8IvS9Me1LrCZrHkHquwg

The restaurant itself was maybe 1/3 full so we got a table very quick. Afterwards the server was quickly with us asking if we wanted anything to drink. The service was great. The food was delicious as well. Keep in mind that this isn't meant to be a full authentic Mexican restaurant so I wasn't expecting that but either way the food was good. A nice little detail was that the sous chef came out to greet us and have us free shrimp tacos which were delicious. He came by a few more times after that to talk with us.

It was our last afternoon in Vegas before heading home when we landed at Chayo. I had scoped out the menu several days prior when I was wandering through the Linq and made a metal note to try to make it back sometime before we left. As luck would have it, it happened to be a Tuesday. As we all know, Mexican food + Tuesday = Taco Tuesday. Score! Here this means half price on all tacos and 2 for one house margaritas. We decided to cash in on both.

We started out with an order of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Man. This stuff is delicious. I don't know if I was in need of some seriously substantial food by now or if their chips and quac really are as good as they tasted that day. Either way, my mouth was seriously happy.

We ordered the Chayo Chopped Salad with grilled/seasonal fish (mahi), an order of the Carnitas Tacos, a side of black beans, an iced tea, and the house marg's (on special) The salad was fresh and yummy. Fish was cooked perfectly and not too dry. Black beans were standard. Nothing over the top as far as they went. I really like black beans though so I was still happy even though they were pretty ""average"". The carnitas tacos were seriously delicious. The carnitas was wonderfully tender. Not too greasy with a really yummy ""carnitas flavor""- prob my favorite dish. Margaritas were VERY drinkable, despite being the ""cheap"" option, made with Sauza and whatever they use as a margarita mix (not overly sweet) I can be pretty picky about margaritas since its typically my drink of choice and these were solid. Even the iced tea had a great fresh-brwewd taste that was really thirst quenching.

Total came to be about 50 bucks (without tip) For everything we got (...in VEGAS!) that was a seriously amazing deal.

Next time we are in town I will def try to hit this place up again. ...a Tuesday would be even better!",wiesbXh_SxoyjY7yuW_gGA,3,4,5,PD4K1KlRwH8P6V_hpLI6Eg

The service provided during our lunch was absolutely deplorable and it is very clear to see why there was no line and empty tables. Our server, after finally showing up, was grossly overburdened and clearly stressed.

We said we were going to just have a few drinks, and he said, ""Ok, just go in."" We had seen on 2 different websites, one being their own, that they had a happy hour/drink specials on Friday and Saturday nights, so we asked the girl behind the bar what those were. She was only on her 2nd night of working there, so she went to ask a ""manager."" He told her there weren't any specials. We asked to speak with him, so he came over with an attitude and proceeded to be extremely rude in telling us he'd do 2-for-1 margaritas since we were showing him the advertisement, but that they've never had specials on Friday night. We showed him the 2nd ad and he rolled his eyes and said, ""What did I just tell you?!"" He then said we'd have to ask a manager about the ads...the girl had told us he was the bar manager. Then a few minutes later a security guy comes over and rudely tells my friend and I that we ""have to get off the chairs"" at the bar because he was going to take them upstairs.

I was really upset why offer something then tell me no we don't.  I had 2 different waitress try to tell me this.

We started with Chips & Salsa which were good, but are additional instead of included like most Mexican restaurants.

I also ordered a side of Mexican Street Corn which I thought was very good.

Bartender was new and doesn't know the menu at all. Forgot to make our margaritas. And we r sitting directly in front of him.

The food finally came out and the salad was disgusting Just swimming in a very bad tasting dressing. My burger was a sloppy mess. It was cooked correctly though. The bartender did get the salad off the bill because it took so long. No manager ever came over to talk to us. She just walked around the room obnoxiously rattling her keys and joking with staff.

4415573,2018-02-25,12,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"I'd take a pretty hard pass on Chayo Mexican Kitchen.  The location is great - the Linq Promenade...  but the food and experience is just not good.  

I found a solid deal on Groupon - $50 for $100 worth of food and drinks...  I got it for around $40 with an extra discount.  As this was a trip with my brother and his family, I was looking for more casual, interesting restaurants close to our hotel and this definitely seemed to fit the bill.  

Since it's on the Promenade and we went on our first night in Vegas (and my brother's first trip to Vegas ever), we wanted to sit on the patio to do some people watching and take in the scene...  it was a little chilly but there were heat lamps all over the patio area so I thought -this will be fine, right?  As it turns out, NOT ONE of the heat lamps was working.  Or maybe it was a case that no one knew how to turn them on?  Whatever...  it was odd.  If they don't work, fix 'em.  Or take 'em out.  They kept fiddling with them but it was clear they either don't work or no one knew what they were doing and we were too far into the meal to move.  Layering.  Always the way in SoCal or Vegas.  

Since we had the $100 to spend, we started with Margaritas and Sangrias.  As you'd expect, they have a lot of options and the drinks were probably the best thing we had here.  

The Queso dip appetizer was ok.  Melted cheese is easy and generally good.  The chicken fajitas were $22 and covered in an odd green sauce.  It looked like ""pesto fajitas"".   The chicken was dry and tasteless despite the sauce (whatever it was).  

My Three-Cheese Quesadilla was OK...  again, melted cheese is a good thing.  But though topped with roasted chiles, a cilantro crema and pickled vegetables, the entire thing really just tasted like bland cheese between tortillas...  no punch or flavor at all.  I ordered a side of guacamole to go along and it tasted like the sort you buy at the Ralph's in the refrigerator case.  I don't believe it was fresh or housemade.  A side order of street corn was also strangely flavorless.  Seasoning is just not a thing here..  you won't find any discernable Mexican flavors or spice.  

For dessert, we shared a Brownie Sundae.  It was pretty on the plate and was as advertised - a brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Not the worst.  

Service was disjointed and not particularly attentive.  Questions weren't answered.  There seemed to be a general lack of knowledge about the menu and the entire operation...  maybe everyone is new?  

Not gonna lie - having that Groupon made this whole disappointing meal a lot easier to swallow (ha!).  If you are staying at the Flamingo or the Linq, it may be worth it to buy the Groupon if (and ONLY IF) you use Chayo as a stop for drinks and apps...  but making this one of your meals is just going to leave you unsatisfied.  Skip for dinner.  A soft ""maybe"" for drinks.  Bring a sweater.",0x9xu_b0Ct_6hG6jaxpztw,21,14,2,DqhKn7PGv0QNNoXCnmsmuw

I asked what Margarita the waiter suggested and took him up on it.  He came back a few minutes later and said they were out of the ingredients.  The girls had Skinny Margaritas that came in what looked like ""toy"" glasses and had hardly any tequila.  Not very ""Vegas""...

We ordered the nachos and some sample platter.  The nachos were a pile of chips with canned cheese dumped on it with a pile of beans on that.  It reminded me of a bowling alley.  The sample platter had no flavor.

The food was pretty great too! We had the chips and salsa and guacamole as starters since I couldn't decide between the two. I loved the salsa! It was very fresh tasting and just the right amount of spice. The guacamole was good too but nothing too spectacular.

For entrees we had the shrimp tacos and burger. I personally loved my tacos! My boyfriend said the burger was good too. We will definitely be back soon! Looking forward to trying out taco Tuesday's that our waiter recommended!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,0,0,4,IRU8swMhd-ShCX1mv_cgUA

The service left something to be desired.  When we had our server's attention he was great.  But during our visit we spent long periods of time with no sight of him and on three occasions had to ask other servers for basic things - like for cutlery about eight minutes AFTER our food arrived.

We were all in agreement to just stay at the Linq since we were not in the mood to drive elsewhere. We just wanted to find  a place to have a few drinks and party a little, since there was a birthday girl in the group. I recommended Chayo, since they don't have one in San Diego and everyone was already familiar with Yard House. Good point. We like trying new places.

The food was ""ok"" but not great. It will do the job if you are hungry, but it is not the best tasting or worse Mexican food I have ever had. We ordered the steak quesadilla with beans n rice and chicken nachos. Huge servings. Enough food for 3-4 people to share the nachos. The chicken was a bit dry though. Overall, food was a 6 on a scale of 1-10. Just ok...nothing special.

The margaritas on the other hand was way too sweet for my liking. We ordered a pitcher and after 4 sips, the sugar buzz kicked in. No bueno!! They added too much orange juice to the mix to where the margarita had a orange hue instead of a green hue from the limes. Not good for a $32 price! Minus two stars!!!

Overall we had a great time!! The place got busy as the night progressed. The dj was playing some great Latin party tunes along with some house n hip-hop music. The saving grace was the mechanical rooster right in the middle of the dance floor. That was so entertaining to watch buzzed folks brave the cock ride and hold on for dear life...lol!! The falls were hysterical! Especially from gals  trying to twerk on the rooster to epic fail!!  We made our cousin's wife ride the cock in honor of her birthday. She did great and looked like a pro bull rider! 

The main reason for my 3 stars was the entertainment factor of the mechanical rooster, along with the service we received that night. Our waitress was sweet, helpful and always available. 

I will come again, but not anytime soon. It was just a place we did not have planned to go and we ended up there, having a good time and laughs due to the Chayo mechanical rooster and up beat Latin music vibe. Stay away from the poorly made margaritas! Don't expect ""really good"" Mexican food either. Food is just...ok.",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,0,0,3,_Ep2TRphfjmWrZ_QDon03g

It was a little of a wait, but my server was checking on it for me. When I got the food and retreated back to my area, I was dismayed to just have a cheese quesadilla... no chicken. I specifcally needed it with a protein so that was a big disappointment.

And yes, too little cheese dictates a star knock off. The drink was really good too. But for a $14 drink I would expect just a little bit more of it. Especially when drinks are free when you're gambling. All in all, I was pretty satisfied. Would definitely go again next time we're in town.

Just like cockroaches aren't a memorable experience to have in your first apartment, so is this establishment known as Chayo. The only reason this place is receiving a two star treatment is because of our friendly waiter and it's prime location. And that's as good as it gets here! Thinking about getting a juicy plate of fajitas and skirt steak that melts in your mouth was but a childish dream when the real thing came out. The fajitas were absolutely bland, having absolute no taste to them and the skirt steak was incredibly dry and had no flavor. Chewing on my t shirt would've been easier on my disappointed tastebuds and my teeth. The flavor had so much potential but the chef lacks the vision. Such a travesty as it is in a very very fantastic location. That this place remains opens seems but the many mysteries of the world that exist. My best bet, the alcohol and rooftop bar keeps them open. The food ?

Even the grilled chicken was bland.  Not even the slightest hint of salt or pepper. The ""enchiladas""were basically their tacos drenched with red sauce.

Ok, giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere was fun, the food we ordered was good and there is a rooster you can ride for free, but honestly we waited for everything for SO long and there were workers around.

We got here around midnight to get some drinks at the bar and an app and see if we could drink up the courage to ride the rooster. 

I ordered a blue moon ($6) and my friends got their peach margarita for $14. We also ordered a round of tequila shots. Apparently their house tequila is $13 or you can get Sauza for $10- NO THANKS! We went for their house tequila and saved us a hangover.

They brought out the drinks after waiting a while and never brought any salt! I waited for someone to come over but no one came,eventually I walked to the bar and asked the one bartender if I could have a salt shaker.

We also ordered chips and salsa ($3) and their queso dip which was about $12-14 I can't remember. The chips came out after the server said he was sorry and it was supposed to come sooner, but we waited another 5-7 minutes for the queso dip. At that point we had been there for nearly 25 minutes. 

We ended up riding the rooster which was fun! If you've ever wanted to ride a bull but didnt have the courage to do it in front of a large crowd, this is the place to come on Saturday night. There weren't many people around and everyone was having fun.

The waiter trots off and comes back to tell us that he doesn't have any of our drinks- the two red wines we ordered are out of stock and so is the beer. OK- What red wine do you have? Ummm. I don't know. He trots off again and comes back to tell us that he has a pinot grigio. RED WINE. Oh ok, he trots off again, tells us that the has some (SMH). Ok, fine, whatever. We'll take it.
Then he disappears for 20 minutes and there's waiters EVERYWHERE but no one to take our order or bring us our drinks. FINALLY, our waiter comes back and takes our order- we also ask about our drinks- oh, he forgot. 30 minutes later the food comes and it is flavorless and kind of gross.

We decided to sit on the patio to people watch, we were seated right away but got there pretty early. There was a line to be seated the rest of the time we were there. 

Food was okay, service was literally terrible. Two of us got the classic breakfast- eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes, english muffin. Mine was fine, potatoes were good. My friends eggs were literally so undercooked it was gross, she told the server and he just stood there and looked at her until she was like sooo can they make me some new eggs or...? He barely nodded and then walked off. He came back when everyone was basically done eating with an entire new plate of breakfast, which was obviously just really unnecessary as it should have taken less than five minutes to just make her new eggs and bring them out and she could's finished her meal with everyone else instead of just ending up with a bunch of wasted food. 

The breakfast burritos were actually pretty good and the guacamole was super good. 

The waiter was just kind of useless. Our water glasses were empty most of the time and we really needed water, I mean come on, it was Saturday morning in Vegas. He brought a pitcher and refilled one water glass and walked away leaving the others empty before we could say anything?? Then he walked out later with two new glasses of water. Like we didn't need new glasses but ok.

I came here for the fish tacos -- grilled mahi mahi. WOW! 

Fish was cooked perfectly, not overcooked at all. Three pieces.  The best thing was the green sauce that came with it. It was described as cilantro mayo, however, mine didn't look light enough or thick enough to have any mayo in it. At best, it seemed like a spicy cilantro blend. Regardless, it was addicting and I wish I had more of it. Served with rice and beans. But I didn't get beans, I got chili instead. Enjoyed the rice compared to the taco dish I had from Yolos in Planet Hollywood. The rice was well cooked, had some moisture and flavor to them as opposed to dry, crunchy bits of old or under cooked rice. 

I have to agree with a few other Yelpers, regarding how long it took to get the food. I had one dish, and it took close to a half hour to get. The  bartender who took my order said it would be out quickly, but even she knew it was taking awhile because she said kept saying it would be out soon, and then later on she said she would check on it. 

I think everyone is nice, but the kitchen must be understaffed or very confused. By the time I got my order, the runner or bus boy came up to me and apologized, said that he confused my order and gave it to the other people before me who had also gotten takeout. What?! And I think that they had made that mistake, because on my receipt stapled to my takeout bag, were the words ""RUSH RUSH RUSH"". And honestly, fish tacos are not a hard order. Grill small chunks of fish, as opposed to having them breaded/deep fried. Throw on the red cabbage, which I assume is pre-sliced. Put everything no a corn tortilla and you're good to go! Sauce, chili, rice packaged on the side. At most, 5-10 minutes to assemble. 

In the afternoon, past lunch hour rush (if there is even a lunch hour rush in a tourist place that has diners at all hours of the day), there were only a handful of diners, and most of that handful was at the bar area. They should not be backed up on orders, nor should a simple dish take so long to make. 

However, the bartenders were friendly and attentive, aware that I was waiting, and consistently checked up on me. The runner was apologetic about the wait. The food was delicious, hence the 3 stars.",Zohjr4ZPl76vryPqiQLJ4A,1,0,3,D-iAYHPA5K4lbwoRUS-NYw

We arrived around noon-ish on a Monday, after scouring the area in search of a place to eat, as we were starving. Our experience went a little something like this :

12:01pm = Check in with the hostess who was brand new. She stated that someone else would be helping us as she was unsure what to do. Love the location as it is in the alleyway between the Flamingo and Linq Casino - close to shops and all!

12:10pm = Still waiting at the host stand for our party of 5 to be seated.

12:13pm = Because we were drawn to their large, shaded patio with white strung lights, we requested to sit outside. We were given two tables pushed together in the back, which was nice.

12:25pm = Greeted by our server. I have to admit, he was insanely busy and appeared to have the entire patio in his section. Order drinks, decide on a pitcher of margaritas for the table.

12:37pm = Our pitcher arrives - so we eagerly order our meals so we don't have to wait even longer. The hubs and I chose to split the appetizer sampler (quesadilla, wings, queso, and more!) while others decided on nachos and a side salad.

1:10pm = Our food arrives, which we devour as by this time, it's been well over an hour since we arrived. Food was decent, nothing mind blowing, but decent. We request more water, enjoy the patio and conversation.

1:25pm = Request check, pay and go about our way.

After all was said and done, the atmosphere and patio were great, but the service was just plain awful. The food was nothing special and I wouldn't go out of my way to return.

She ended up seating us right away, which was really strange because that other girl just disappeared or just didn't want to help us.

Our server took our order pretty quickly and our food and drinks didn't take too long to come out either. However, once she dropped off the food, we never really saw her until she dropped off the plates. The restaurant was almost empty so I don't know what she was doing or where she went.

When the hostess with red hair sat us on the 2nd floor where Karaoke was being held we had high hopes that this was going to be fun. 

I'll try to be be brief. The bartender was okay. He took a while to come to get our orders and bring our check as he watched The Last Man on Earth on the big screen TV. I don't remember his name but he was a bald headed gentleman with a beard. 

The Karaoke was terrible as a second tier Karate Karaoke host tried to be funny, while being totally inappropriate at the same time. (He literally put his pelvis while on stage on a girls head as she sang, who could or could have not been his girlfriend.) Don't get me wrong I don't mind raunchy but j just didn't expect it from this place. Which looked like a really nice and decent restaurant from the front. It felt like this Karaoke didn't fit the atmosphere? Just bad entertainment and it didn't seem like anyone cared that worked there. We literally saw 3 different groups of people sit down after us and leave before us.

The manager who had his girlfriend with him sat right next to us who was also a semi bald heavyset man who bragged to a waitress that when he left Claim Jumpers he tried to bring his girlfriend who he insisted he was going to get hired eventually. He then tried to flirt with 2 waitresses while his girlfriend was there which don't ask me how she was with that dude. I believe her name was Rachel and I only know that because as he sat next to us he kept introducing her to everyone.

We still tipped the minimum of 15% and the main reason was the food. We definitely won't come back here again. If this is the vibe and atmosphere you are trying to have then it was no wonder the restaurant seemed emptier than when we came by last year. If this review is not the atmosphere you're looking for than we would suggest a better management team because whoever this manager is from Claim Jumpers may not be it.

Hope this review helps you to be better because your restaurant is beautiful!",iawUzGQGBi0aOg5gOYAqQw,0,0,2,5AC7xK_RbHAYjIe0sfp0HA

I told the bartender again that I ordered the quesadilla.  She replied, ""those are quesadillas.""  The couple next to us said, I thought you ordered the quesadilla?  I live in San Diego and know what a quesadilla is.  One of the two key ingredients in a quesadilla is cheese, essentially the Mexican version of a grilled cheese sandwich which is nearly impossible to screw up.

I dined Saturday July 12, 2014 for the first and last time.

Our server started out very attentive and inquired if we were ready to order frequently. (there may have been ten tables)

A gentleman with a large tray which appears to be some of the items I may have ordered comes out and circles my booth but doesn't make any eye contact. He circles the area a second time before placing my food on someone else's table. I acknowledged the server and of course he picked the food up and brought it to me. Another server comes out and does the exact same thing to me and my guest a second time.

No one fills the water or even comes back after the mix up the remainder of our lunch. The restaurant was nearly empty you would think these types of errors wouldn't occur! 

I was highly displeased with the lack of service and mediocre foods especially  after having another guest served my food before brining it to my table!

$50 for decent shrimp ceviche, excellent chips and guacamole, terrible empanadas, and a yummy Sangria! 

My lunch date enjoyed her $15 lobsters and I must admit they looked delish too!!!

Anyway, she was so rude and pushy with us ordering alcohol, we didn't want any but still kept pushing. And when I asked if I can have options with the drink that I got, she just got too bjtchy. She was acting too cool and not even treating us like her customers. Me and my friends thought that she didn't deserve any tip because of her attitude and bad service but we still left $3. 

Leaving the restaurant, she chased us with a really bitchy attitude. ""You're gonna give that much tip, for that much amount of food? So did you wanna get your change back????

Food was mediocre. Guacamole was very basic but the salsas were great. Chips seemed fresh (although I'm not positive) and likely not from a generic bag produced in mass quantities. However I hated the tortillas.  I love fresh flour tortillas that are very authentic. There isn't an option for this. We only got corn tortillas the fajitas.  The fajitas were drenched in too much sauce which is very sad because the chicken  and veggies were cooked perfectly. I wouldn't wipe enough of the sauce off. The corn was undercooked. 

Service was not good and I have trouble saying this because the staff was very nice but it was too disorganized. The waiter forgot many things but was always nice when he approached so of course I figured it was just too new of a venue. Perhaps they should do mock service if they didn't bc the hostesses were very confused as well. They didn't bring any napkins or utensils and seems a little lost when I asked for it. But they were very sweet and gracious so I can't hold this against them.  I think a little more training will solve this. 

I was excited to try the cocktails but the balance was wrong. My drink was too sweet. I appreciate when they can make a good drink that is balanced so just some minor adjustments are needed. 

I think they have what it takes but there's a lot of work to be done. Good selection is staff but more training is needed and some works needs to be done to perfect the food.

First, I tried contacting Chayo (invalid email listed on website, no response when I used the contact form on their website, and no answer when I called). We still decided to go here- why I don't know. We got there and were seated in an area that did not participate in happy hour without being given the options or told the difference between seating sections. We finally made it upstairs to happy hour. Alyssa server 1319, our waitress, took our food and drink order. The bus boy brought us 2 napkins for 4 people - not sure how that works? When our food came, 2 things were wrong (steak tacos instead of the nachos we ordered). We told the guy delivering food, and he flagged down the waitress. She became defensive from the start, and proceeded to go through our orders one by one, confirming the food was on the table, and then crumpling the receipt in front of us stating the order was complete in a very rude manner. We were all shocked at this treatment, as if we were in the wrong for not accepting wrong food. When she returned, we asked what the problem was and why we were treated as if we did something wrong. She stated that we were doubting what she wrote down for our orders, which we nicely said was not the case and we just wanted the food we ordered. She then stormed away, proceeded to throw napkins on our table, and then immediately went on break, having what appeared to be a meltdown. At this point, we were basically ignored for quite some time. Finally, a different waiter came over offering us a ""dance that we could hire."" Apparently it was a strategy to lighten up the situation, but still no real apology. He then got an earful from us and decided to bring us shots at no cost. We asked for our checks, which surprisingly, Alyssa brought. When we paid, we were told they did not give change less than $1 and kept the change from the cash payment, basically stealing the difference that should have been given back. (Seriously - Alyssa STOLE the change!!) In the end, the food was AWFUL except for the street corn. The service was the worst I've ever had.

Our party of 4 ordered 3 Oaxacan salads and one Chayo burrito. Everyone enjoyed the food ONCE it arrived. The $18 burrito was huge. The $14 salads weren't big for their price, but they did come with generous portions of avocado, and they were appropriately sized for a 109-degree day, when the heat can kill one's appetite. The salsa was tasty. The small basket of not-free chips weren't noteworthy and thus arguably not worth $3 (the supposed price, although I see that the server forgot to add the charge to our bill).

Service was painfully slow. It's a cliche, but I began to wonder if they had to go pick the lettuce. I'm pretty sure the server simply forgot to check on our order. Ironically, I saw at least 2 staff members literally running through the restaurant and yet nothing seemed to be getting done. The staff seemed frazzled, and if I hadn't been so hungry, I might have been more understanding; it had been a HOT day and they must have been quite drained.

Came here with a group of friends last weekend. Everything was good, service was good, but good god...they charge a lot for everything. Especially their drinks that have hardly any alcohol. (Ironically, the name has ""Tequila Bar"" in it.)

The patio downstairs and upstairs is very nice. I can see why people would want that with the Linq to look at. They also have a bull to ride on, and you know some drunk ladies love some bull riding...

I give this place a solid 3 stars. Good food, good service, clean, but for the prices, I think it should be a little better in all areas except the decor. The decor is very nice and they want it to seem upscale. They're just lacking with quality. 

The margaritas were very sweet with little tequila. I ordered one that was supposed to be more tart.
I had the carnitas and they were good, and good if you're not very hungry. Most of their food is smaller portions. I almost always get carnitas when I eat at Mexican restaurants. 
The lobster tacos were okay - they were a bit too salty for me.
One thing I really did enjoy was the guac. That was some good guac. 

Over all, we had 4 margaritas, carnita tacos, lobster tacos and guac - it was $120 with tip. I don't think it's worth this price. But, whatevs. It was good enough and we all had a good time.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,9,3,3,5bDF1z7w2sWo4ggS8b_Nqw

Please note this is for take out service and we are not scoring for appearance or the warmth of the food.

This was Sat morning and we were dying for a different type of breakfast. I get there and was greeted by a couple nice bartenders and ordered the Chiliquiles Verdes and corned beef hash skillet for me.

About 15 mins later my take out food arrives and I went to pay and I received no change back.
It was about a dollar so I didn't squabble about it and just left.

I open up my corned beef hash and thought I got the wrong breakfast. The CBH looked like little diced cubes of ham. It tasted nothing nor looked like CBH. I was pretty disappointed. Not only that but instead of putting shredded cheese on top of the meal, they put it on the bottom so I had to scrape it from the box. My entire dish lacked flavor. it was probably the worst breakfast I've had in a long long time. It wasn't horrible tasting, it was just so bland. And the little cubes of ham or corned beef hash tasted like nothing. Don't expect traditional corned beef hash here.

On the other hand my wife's Chiliquiles dish was pretty tasty and good. The verde sauce had just enough spice to it. I was worried that the box and take out would make the tortilla chips soft but it came out just fine.

Pros: Not too busy but i did get there right after it opened
         Friendly bartenders who take the orders
         Clean restaurant

Cons: Corned beef hash tastes like ham cubes, not traditional by any means

But... Oh my this place sucks.  Short Story: The food is terrible. 

Longer Story:
The music makes you think they fancy themselves a nightclub, at 2:00am, on a Saturday.  Even though it's a Tuesday.  And empty.  And 10:00pm.

The margaritas were 2-for-1 (cool) and had so much 'sour' in the mix that I had heartburn until the next morning (super not cool).  I've never had that happen, and I've had a lot of margaritas in my life.

The tacos were 1/2 off (cool) and tasted so terrible I couldn't finish one (not cool).  The meat was slow cooked in something that I suppose someone likes as it made it to the menu, after a major/costly restaurant build.  But the thought of having another one already makes me ill.  The Caesar salad that I ordered as a replacement was just as bad, which I don't know how it's possible.  Except too much anchovy in the dressing?  The dressing was even on the side and I couldn't eat half of the salad.  And they insist on making their chips ""fancy"" by putting WAY too much seasoned salt/whatever.  Oh, and the guacamole was garnished with pomegranate seeds.  Fancy.

Bottom line, no reason to go here.  Unless you have the need to ride a mechanical bull?

I arrived with 3 others, we requested to be seated and it took roughly around 15 minutes to seat us, reasonable for a Saturday night. First thing I noticed as we began to walk in was the music playing. A but loud for me. We were seated and our server, whose name was Juan as well, was very courteous, jovial and attentive. We placed our order of some drinks, apps and entrees.

Our drinks arrived in a timely fashion and were quite delicious. No holding back on the alcohol here my friends! Our apps arrived which consisted of some pork sopes. I was a bit disappointed when they arrived. The sopes were sitting in a pool of lard which made the tortilla of the sope extremely greasy. I understand traditional Mexican sopes are cooked in a small bit of lard for flavor and to crisp it up a bit but this was nothing like that. The seasoning on the meat was good but couldn't really enjoy them much. Our entrees arrived. I personally had the beer battered lobster tacos and had a carnitas taco. The carnitas taco was good but the meat was a bit too dry. Flavors were there but there was a big lack in moisture in the protein. Now for the lobster tacos. I had trouble with these tacos because they seemed to be double salted. As a culinary student it seemed as though the lobster had been cooked and salted prior to frying it, then salting the lobster again after frying. Not too satisfying to the palette. One if my friends had the Manchego Burger. It was ordered medium rare and arrived that way. It was described to be a very delicious and juicy burger. Ad we asked for the bill and prepared to pay, we noticed the music growing louder. This was another problem whole dining as we had to raise our voices to speak to each other comfortably.

Upon first entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised by the modern decor and atmosphere. The hostesses were nice and we were seated promptly. The waiter was at our table immediately and asked if we were interested in drinks; my wife needed a few minute to look over the drink options and the waiter did not make any recommendations. I asked what kind of beers were available and he stated they had Dos Equis Amber, Lager, and Lite; I wasn't unaware that Dos Equis had a Lite version, so, thinking it was something new, I ordered it (more on this later).

The waiter returned shortly after with our drinks, chips and salsa (which were okay), and laminated menus... yes, cheap, one-sided, laminated menus in a restaurant that charges $25+ per entree. The menu did not have as many items as we expected and the descriptions for each item were extremely vague. We decided to start with the chorizo sopes and Mexican street corn. Both items were brought to our table after about 5 minutes and were both actually pretty tasty, but not mind blowing. Now, back to the Dos Equis ""Lite""; I was actually given a Lager and when I informed the waiter that I ordered a Lite, he said that Lager is the lite. WTF, right?

Shortly after the appetizers were delivered, our waiter returned for our entree order. He didn't seem to know much about the items and had no recommendations. I ordered the chicken torta and my wife ordered the beef filet fajitas. There's an item called Yucca fries and, when I asked the waiter what those are, he said, ""I think they're like sweet potato fries."" I decided to order those, as well.

The entrees didn't take too long to come out; after taking our first bites, my wife and I wished they had never come out. My chicken torta consisted of flavorless chicken, avocados, and way too much black bean paste; it was served with spinach on the side... just plain spinach with a drizzle of some unidentifiable substance, which I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put on my torta or eat as a salad. My wife's fajitas were equally as flavorless and the beef was extremely chewy. In fact, if there were such a thing as negative flavor, these dishes would qualify. Oh, and the Yucca fries, which the waiter ""thought"" were sweet potato fries, were just regular steak fries, also with no flavor.

The waiter came by to ask how our food tasted and I let him know that we thought our food was flavorless, which is something I have never done, but this food was so bad, I felt compelled to do so. I asked if he could bring out some hot sauce or something to add some flavor; even salt and pepper would've improved these dishes! He stated that all they had was Tabasco. Now, this is supposed to be a Mexican restaurant, which means it should have its own house hot sauce or at least Cholula or Tapatio, but nope, just Tabasco.

Apparently, our displeasure upset the waiter and he was rude for the remainder of our dinner; like it was our fault the food was bad! I promptly asked for the overpriced bill and left absolutely no tip, also something I had never done.

I highly recommend that NO ONE SHOULD EAT HERE! I honestly would've rather eaten at Chevy's.",C8vbtEJEmNLksU0EdgRpZw,19,3,1,mI3ltho1pL3SKxLYFrpeBw
5176204,2016-06-17,3,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"This is a restaurant that has all the potential for being a great place to spend some time enjoying the promenade at the Linq, and getting a bite to eat. The space is open and has high ceilings with plenty of high top bar tables to people watch. The food is decent to good and the presentation as well.
Where they really need to improve is in the area of customer service and attentiveness. On three separate trips to Las Vegas, we've stopped in because of its great location and its inviting look. Each time, however, the service remains the same. Once we've gotten seated by a friendly hostess, we have had to wait upwards of 15 minutes to have someone even offer us a drink or acknowledge our presence. I'm not talking about a packed restaurant situation here either. Maybe 10-15 tables out of I'm guessing 75. 
The servers unfailingly apologize for the long wait and are friendly when they do show up which is a definite plus, but I'm guessing a little time management training or someone who can lead by example. The food takes a little longer than your typical Mexican restaurant but tastes good, so no worries there. Try to get your check 15 minutes before you want it so you won't be frustrated having to wait for someone to collect it and bring it back.
All in all, it's decent food with a less than stellar waitstaff. Would I go back armed with the knowledge of all this? Probably",4-Sx8oZ4hwXR5YNWJHnAMw,5,5,3,XnGU4qi8_iRqCJrlTYdXAQ

Waited another 10 minutes after that to get our food order taken. We ordered chips and salsa and the few chips on top were big pieces the rest were crumbs. We had to flag down the server to get better chips since they are not complimentary we wanted to get decent chips for our money (not complimentary is no biggie but to get crumbs when you are paying for them is not okay).

Okay finished eating...The food was just okay. Nothing to write home about. My dad thought his carne asada was dry. My moms vegetables were grilled not sautéed like she ordered. My dad and I thought the beans were watery, however my bf enjoyed them. I ordered a Sprite half through my meal and it was flat. 

Service never got any better throughout our meal. The server never checked on us. We ran out of water no one ever came to offer us a refill or even noticed we were low/out. We had to get his attention. Overall, I would not come back here. The service itself ruined the meal and the food was not good enough to bring me back.

We ordered 5 margaritas. No one at the table swallowed their first sip. Pre-mixed, Splenda-soaked, fake-lime, tequila juice is not something I expect from a ""Mexican kitchen."" 

The queso fundido was horrendous. They threw a block of curdled cheese into a mini cast iron pot. What??? I mean, it tasted like cheese, so it wasn't nasty. But it was not ""queso fundido.""

Sean, the manager, poorly handled our concerns. Also, don't stuff your face with cupcakes in your makeshift banquet area. It's not classy.

No smiles at all from the hostesses. Between the three of them they couldn't crack a smile. They wouldn't seat us until half our party was there, even though we said we would like to be seated and begin ordering drinks. After a few minutes one of the hostesses asked us if we would like to sit at the bar until seated. Sure, we said. The bar maid came and took an order for drinks. Our party showed up, neither of the drinks had been made yet, she was in the process of making a house margarita, which we took to the table. We were told to order the pina colada at the table. Then it just went south. The waiter was very unfriendly and difficult to understand because of his heavy accent. I tried ordering the pina colada and he argued it wasn't a good drink and I should have a margarita. I've had their pina coladas many times and enjoy them very much. He took everyone else drink order, after upselling everyone to margaritas. The table received all the drinks except my pina colada. My buddy ordered a margarita which turned out to be awful. He sent it back and got a pina colada. I still hadn't even gotten mine. We told one of the ladies who worked there and she informed the manager. The manager tells the waiter who then goes in to some kind of explanation of why I didn't get my drink flinging his hands around. The food was 'ok', terribly overpriced - which is par for the course being on the strip. Then, when the check came, he refused to split it three ways leaving us to figure who had what, add it up and figure the tax! Ridiculous! I went to the manager and told him the situation, he took the check and they split it three ways. I had no intention of tipping because the service was just plain awful. But because we had a party of 8 they added a tip of OVER 20 percent! 
I can't recommend this place to anyone - stay away! Save your money and go to Denny's. They greet you with a smile and it's not over priced. Plus, you get the pleasure of tipping some on what they're worth not being charged for service you didn't receive. Chayo, if your service is so good, give your wait staff a raise. Otherwise, quit over charging your patrons, especially locals who already pay for the parking. I won't be back. Steer clear!",yabAXBM2e_TkF13pFQbTqQ,0,1,1,RZsC2jTpkTXnf8Z39kQ5lw
5227743,2014-03-26,2,oXoVJ0xKv82cBo9U6oEjlQ,"It really pains me to give Chayo 2 stars.  I was here last week with a Yelp Elite event, and all the food was great, and service was incredible.  I walked in last night ready to give Chayo 5 stars.  Based on the service and the quality of the food...I just couldn't do it.
I walked up with a friend of mine to the hostess table outside...where there was no one there, also no sign indicating that there was another hostess station.

One of the servers noticed us standing there and escorted us to the hostess station, where we were told it would be a 15 minute wait.  The restaurant wasn't super busy, and there were a few open tables..but I get it, some people have reservations, some people got there before us in the time from my call and my arrival.  However...the girl at the hostess station was very unprofessional.
My friend made the comment that we were told it wouldn't be a problem to get a table when we called and she said ""Well we wouldn't say that.""  She took my name, and said we could wait at the bar.

Her attitude  left much to be desired, and really put my friend off a lot.  He was extremely upset at the fact that she was so rude.  Her choice of attire was also very unprofessional...lets just say that I could see her side tattoo and could tell that she was feeling a little chilly, if you catch my drift. 

We sat at the bar, and were there a good 5 minutes before the bartender asked if we needed anything.  
Shortly thereafter, the general manager, Scott, came over and asked if we were waiting for a table.   He was very polite, and sure enough...we were seated about 5 minutes later.

So the whole reason we came out here last night, was because I saw on their website that they have Taco Tuesday, which is half price tacos, and 2 for 1 margaritas.  I didn't end up drinking last night, because $14 for 2 drinks is a little spendy for me...although if the drinks are made the same as they were last week, it is SO worth it.

We ordered the chicken, lobster and ribeye tacos.  3 of each, are normally $12.  
I wouldn't order these for $12.  I'll come back on a Tuesday and pay $6 for them, no problem, but they are not worth $12 for 3 smallish street tacos. 
*It should be noted now, that I asked if the tacos come with any avocado or guacamole, since I am allergic.  Our server, James (who was REALLY wonderful) said no.  

The wait for the food was a bit on the long side.  I'm really not an impatient person, but for street tacos...the wait shouldn't have been as long as it was.

Presentation wise, the tacos looked wonderful.  The plates have a couple slices of lime, which I thought was a nice touch...enough for all three tacos. 

The lobster taco:  we got the mayo sauce on the side (my friend hates mayo)...
They were good.  The lobster bites were deep fried, and you honestly had to pull a little piece of lobster away from the rest of the taco to enjoy the lobster taste, but I liked them.  I personally really liked the mayo sauce. 
The ribeye taco:  Meh.  My first bite, I had a piece of fat swing out of the taco and hit me in the face.  WAY too fatty.  The second bite was better, but...meh.  Probably wouldn't eat these again.
The chicken taco:  By far my favorite of the three.  The first taco was full of flavor, and really really tasty.  The second one was honestly a little more bland, like the chicken hadn't been seasoned the same way throughout.  

After we finished those, we ordered the carnitas tacos. 
Those took a long time too, longer than 3 tacos should have.

These were the worst of the night.  Number one...they had avocado on them, and it is NOT listed on the menu.  (I also had asked before)  
Second, my friend squeezed the taco 3 times and his plate and fingers were COVERED in grease.  Ew Ew Ew.  No thank you.

The good news, and the only really stellar  part of the evening, was our server James.  First of all, we weren't even in his section, but he saw us sitting there and asked if anyone had taken care of us yet, and took our table.  
He was personable, sang along with the songs that were playing, made jokes with us...and he removed the carnitas off the check with no questions asked.  

I will go back, and give them another try.  I'm sure they're still in their growing and opening stages, and going through some pains.  I really want to like this place, but last night made it difficult.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,19,3,2,3k7i4lShrixR0pcOS6OTGQ

First off, very spacious. Good amount of distance between tables so you aren't cramped or back to back with other people. The decor is pretty dope. I love sugar skulls, and they had an entire wall of them. Sorry, I was so into my food I forgot to snap a pic. Right smack dab in the middle is a mechanical bull. I didn't ride it (didn't have enough tequila while I was there), so I'm not sure if it's free or not.

Our server was very friendly. Providing us updates when our food and drinks were taking longer than usual. The food was tasty. Mexican with a Vegas twist. We started with the ceviche and it was good, but a little heavy on the chip seasoning for my taste. Borderline too salty. The Chicken Al Pastor tacos we're seasoned to perfection. Deconstructed so you can build them how you please. Bubs's chicken burrito was kind of bland, and our friend's enchiladas were pretty spicy. For casual dining it's mid-range pricing ($15+ a plate), but the portions were a good size.

Don't feel like dining in? Chayo has a food cart on the promenade that sells smaller portions of select items from the main menu.",954LjeI04TUwhnlJyHbLzg,2,1,4,n6-bYbZSnxTc1FCxnw7Q_g

Now approaching its fourth anniversary, one of The Linq's few opening-day venues that has not changed name or concept, it was earlier this year that Chayo came under the same management as HeXX Kitchen + Bar at Paris, Chef Steve Aguglia taking over as top toque and freshening up a menu that spans from Tacos and Burritos to innovative daily Breakfast and Dinner Specials.

Open from 8am until midnight or later daily, a Taco and Margarita Cart out front tempting passers-by as loud music overflows the promenade, guests entering Chayo will immediately find themselves engulfed in a Tex-Mex wonderland comprising everything from Sombreros and Luchador Masks to a Mechanical Bull, the Hip-Hop soundtrack later spun by a DJ fairly incongruous with the concept, particularly during NFR Rodeo weekend. 

Eventually becoming accustomed to the scene, a process aided by excellent service provided by a College-age woman who kept up with Food and Beverage orders over the course of nearly two hours, it was with Cocktails in hand that Chips, Salsa, Guacamole and Queso Fundido were all served simultaneously, the housemade nature of each making them better than the typical Mexican joint with the smoky Salsa and Cheese Dip that never showed a sign of coagulating particularly stand-out.

Dining as a quartet and thus doing a lot of sharing, many of the items re-portioned or plated in order to facilitate this given the immense size of a comfortable leather booth, it was with a plate of Wings ordered for the youngster that adults were presented shallow bowls of Tortilla Soup filled with shredded Chicken and bold aromatics, a follow-up of two styles of Tostada really a tossup as to which was better, though the addition of Mango Vinaigrette to Spicy diced Tuna made it pretty hard to top.

Approximately half-full early but swelling with a mix of Cowboys and verbose tourists as the hours passed, Televisions showing Hockey and Basketball joined by a live feed of Buckin' Broncos and Calf-Roping, it was just prior to Tacos being presented that a Photographer selling commemorative pictures stopped by to peddle her goods, a Magician soon to follow and finally two scantily clad Jack Daniels ambassadors selling $5 shots and 'swag.'

Finding far more value in warm Tortillas packed with Chicken Al Pastor, Green Chili Pork or Carne Asada than any of the gimmicks, though a $10 Mechanical Bull ride was well-worth the thirty seconds of fun before being unceremoniously thrown to an airbag below, it was upon return to the table that two Enchiladas proved to be Chef Aguglia's very best dish, the Short Rib tender amidst spicy Rattle Chile Sauce while the Roasted Corn fared even better alongside Cheese and strips of Mushrroms.

Fairly full at this point, tablemates taking only small bites of Rib-Eye plated atop Onions, Potatoes and a surprisingly convincing housemade Mole, it was with most of the medium-rare Beef finished that all four of Chayo's Desserts capped things off, the light Sponge Cake holding up well despite being sopping wet with Condensed Milk and Boozy Cream while the Brownie and Bread Pudding were both rich and delicious, though no match for what might just be the sweetest and creamiest Flan in town.

***1/2:  Offering superior Food and vastly better service than one might guess, the only real issue being an almost overwhelming amount of competing 'activity,' Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar undoubtedly fits what many both love to criticize about Las Vegas dining, though it would be hard to name a better place serving this style of food on the Strip at such a portion and price-point.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,2,4,AsSoel9DFtlzCJH57zlGKA

Service was on point to come take our order but Jose our server didn't offer or suggested anything from the menu...HE JUST  TOOK OUR ORDER ,,, It was fairly busy, but not that busy! This place probably falls apart when it's really crowded, I imagine.

I came in for dinner on a Tuesday evening and it was surprisingly busy, the hostess told me there would be a 35 minute wait for a table or I could seat myself at the bar. I was dining alone and went with this option, I still had to wait 5 minutes for a seat because they were all taken but it didn't bother me. 
I was a little annoyed about one of the staff members, a blonde bartender with tattoos, who wouldn't serve me as she said she was too busy and I would need to go stand and order from her coworker on the other side of the bar from where I was standing. Not only this but my entire dining experience was interrupted by her complaining to her coworkers non stop about one of the bar backs- her customer service definitely needs some improvement. I digress...

When I finally managed to get served my bartender was awesome! He made me a delicious and strong Cucumber Margarita and took my order really quickly. I had the Guacamole and the Short Rib Enchiladas. Guac was really good and the enchiladas were decent too although I thought the sauce could have been a touch more flavourful. Overall I had a positive experience but might be hesitant to sit at the bar again, I don't want to hear about how much the staff don't like each other/are annoyed with each other while I'm trying to relax and have some delicious food and drinks.

Drink prices are standard for a Strip location. As a Mexican restaurant they are known for their margaritas and have a menu that highlight their various concoctions. I had wanted to try a couple of them, but they did not have certain components to make them. I went with a micholada and it was good. They didn't have clamato, so they just used bloody mary mix instead. They offered us chips and salsa after our second drink. The seasoning on those warm chips makes for crack.

Once we were seated, it took some time for us to get service. 10 minutes pass and no one showed up. 15 minutes goes by and still no one. We were told the server didn't know he had the table. Honest mistake. Eventually, our server did come. We had some issues with what was in stock. I had wanted 2 different kinds of whiskey, but they didn't have either. 

Food wise: The appetizers were delicious. We got the ceviche, a queso fundido, chicken tacos, and the guacamole. The fish was tender and seasoned well. The acidic component mellowed out with the use of cucumbers. The queso was okay. The chorizo didn't give as much of a kick as I was hoping. The fact that they serve it in a iron skillet allows the cheese to crisp on the bottom. Scraping up all of it and eating it is half the joy. I didn't try the tacoes, but the others seemed to enjoy it. The guacamole was probably my favorite. The put pomegranate seeds on top. It gave it a touch of tart and sweetness that was the most unique item on the menu. As for entrees, nothing was spectacular. The sweet corn enchiladas were a decent vegetarian option, but lacked a countering flavor, so it was just sweet. The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy. I just wouldn't come to a Mexican restaurant and think burger. My friend enjoyed his chicken torta. I stole a bite of the chicken enchiladas and weren't impressed.

One of our party members paid before they left and it took some time to get our waiter to come back. We had still wanted to order some more drinks, but by the time he came back we were ready to leave.

Service was weird, we asked for an inside table because temps were dropping quickly outside and I didn't want to freeze. The hostess made a big deal of checking to see if they had a table but sure enough the patio was mostly full but the inside was a ghost town.

The restaurant has a mechanical bull located near the middle of it, even though I'm not quite sure how that relates to a Mexican restaurant.  I've usually seen those type of things at country western bars.  Just seemed a bit tacky to me, but I'm sure it helps the nightlife business.

Anyway, on to the food.  The menu here is not large by any means, but they do have some standard tex-mex type cuisine.  You can get enchiladas, fajitas, tacos, etc.  I ordered the shrimp fajitas, which were $20+.  Just a piece of advice, skip the fajitas.  The shrimp was ok, but most of the other items were bland.  I almost forgot that we did have some chips and salsa, which were good.  The salsa was spicy, although not too bad.  The only drawback is that you have to pay for chips and salsa here ($3), and I know most of us aren't used to that.  Those are complimentary at every other Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, but hey, it's Vegas.  My wife ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were dynamite.  I would highly recommend those, as they are full of flavor.  Two people could easily split them.

Overall, I thought this place was pretty good.  Not my favorite, but certainly not bad.  I'd like to try one of the other restaurants in the Linq area next time.",MpQ8K-NFcIB1gvNUwnAYgQ,2,2,3,Q6ibN7tg_zY4TlCuFCbOwg

The bartender brought us all chips and great salsa while we waited which was cool. 
Not very long after we got our cocktails, the hostess came over and and were seated in the very back booth facing a wall, ok, kind of unnecessary since it was less than half full in the place and there were plenty of tables but ok, I get it, waiter table rotation.

We decided to sit at the bar and I'm so glad we did. The bartenders were super friendly and chatted with us the whole time - they're actually the only reason I gave the place an extra star. 
The hh margarita (without added flavor) was just ok, the added flavors were better (the watermelon was actually squeezed watermelon, not just flavoring), but still not great. The hh beer came in mini bottles. At the end of the hh, we decided to order a couple apps because we kept seeing food go by and it smelled great. My bf got the wings which were just ok, but came with a cilantro cream sauce we both really loved despite the fact we both typically hate cilantro. I got two tacos, one chicken and one steak. The steak was pretty horrible, but I stole my bf's sauce from his wings and it made it tolerable. The chicken was actually really good and tasted authentic. 
While the bartenders were super friendly to us, the service in general for the hh was a little crazy. It seemed there was one dedicated bartender and one dedicated server (until the last hour of the hh maybe), but one guy was more of a floater and didn't really seem to help where needed. I watched pretty much every table that came in sit for a long period of time and sit and talk amongst themselves, shaking their heads in disbelief that they weren't being served. I watched people sit with empty glasses for long periods of time with no refills. I watched people sitting with their checks annoyed because they wanted to leave. Many people came up to the bar to get their own refills and pay their tabs.

Hence ""+ tequila bar"" in the name, the mechanical bull, the louder music, and a menu that is half food and half drinks. So I wasn't expecting a calm, peaceful meal that was a bargain. But I was very pleased with the service and the food. The food is traditional Mexican fare with some extra twists.

My buddy and I decided on Chayo after a Rebels game to eat and have some drinks. We were standing outside by the hostess stand and because the hostess was gone, our server was attentive and saw us. He came outside to greet us and took us inside to be seated immediately. He suggested the Golden Margarita and White Peach Margarita. We obliged and I had the Golden. A $14 margarita is jab to the wallet, but the Patron reposado packed an overhand right to the jaw. The tequila was definitely not hidden. After two margaritas each, we were feeling it.

As far as food, we started with chips & salsa and guacamole & pork rinds. The guacamole is great, creamy with the pomegranate and not too heavy with tomatoes or onions. The portion we received was at least double compared to the photos on Yelp. I would recommend the chips instead of the pork rinds with the guacamole as the pork rinds' saltiness overpowers the guacamole.

For entrees, I had the pork enchiladas and my buddy had the slow roasted beef short rib. My enchiladas were delicious. The cascabel chile sauce added great flavor and kick. I had a taste of the short rib and it was tender. The accompanying oaxaca cheese mashed potato was delicious.

He took both in his hand and put them under the counter, and rinsed them off, thinking I would not notice. He then proceeded to fill both the clean and dirty glass with ice and water. Then without hesitation, put them down in front of us. I was extremely grossed out. There was salt in my glass, at the bottom. WILL NEVER EAT HERE EVER AGAIN!

It took forever to get our order taken, when we asked for chips and salsa the waitress looked at me like I was asking for a pony wearing a crown. 

We ordered the steak nachos, no pico and sour cream on the side. When the nachos arrived there was no sour cream, no plates and no silverware. When we got the waitresses attention to let her know the sour cream was missing she looked around the table like we were HIDING it asking ""oh you didn't get it?"". Seriously? 20 minutes later we got all the aforementioned items but it was too late to salvage any part of this dining experience.

I got the Avocado salad which was pretty good considering it only had three small pieces of Avocado on it. It had spicy toasted pumpkin seeds, shredded cactus, and a very tart limey sauce. Not too bad.

Drinks were relatively priced, and having conversations with the bartender while he cut a thousand limes was fun.

We noticed that this place was the busiest restaurant out of all the other restaurants in the Linq so we decided to have dinner here. There was a wait to be seated out on the patio so we chose to dine inside which had no wait.

Our waitress was very friendly, she had a smile the whole time we were there. She took our orders and within 10 minutes, our food came out. I ordered the slow roasted rib eye tacos, my boyfriend ordered the fish tacos, and our friend ordered the avocado salad. Everything was good and tasty, but I wish we had ordered some appetizer as we still hungry. 

There's a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant and it was very fun to watch people ride and fall off. The music level would go up and down depending on if anybody is on the bull.

The restrooms are a little out of the way as it is on the second level and we had to take the elevator. There were stairs but the stair were roped off.

What can I really say about Chayo? It was ok. Being from a border city and living in San Antonio makes me really picky about Mexican/Tex Mex/Mex-Fusion cuisine.
If the service was better, it would be perfectly adequate. I had dinner with a colleague here on a Monday evening. We were pretty hungry and thought this might be a good option. 
Our server seemed a little out of it and came to our table a few times without even taking our drink orders. He instead waited until we had decided on our food order before accepting our drink orders. I ordered a paloma. This is my beverage of choice anywhere that claims to be a tequila bar. Tequila is my favorite spirit and as such, i was really expecting to be wowed by this semi overpriced cocktails. I wasn't. The only reason I know it had tequila in it, was because they menu said that it did. In a tequila cocktail, you want to taste the tequila, not to judge the strength, but rather to enjoy the pairing of flavors between the agave, the bitter grapefruit and the tart lime. Unfortunately, i was basically drinking a glass of watered down, warm grapefruit juice. Yes, dear reader, it was served over ice, but it wasn't even cold. GROSS!
My friend ordered a sangria that also seemed to suffer from a distinct dearth of alcohol. 
Our food was slightly better, but the service did not improve. Considering the place was practically empty, this was not pleasing. 
We had ordered chips and salsa to start, but it was brought out with our food. Considering that they charge for them, you'd think they'd bring them out when you ask. I ordered the chipotle chicken tostadas. Depending on where you are, you may be familiar with this dish as chalupas or some other colorful name. Essentially, they are corn tortillas, that have been fried crisp and topped with different things. This particular dish had a smear of black beans, the chipotle chicken, a drizzle of sour cream, a sprinkling of queso fresco and a random slice of radish as garnish. The chicken was smokey, but lacked spice and would benefit from some acid. It was a large portion (3 to an order), but the tortillas were not able to stand up to the toppings and ended up falling apart. I had to eat them with a fork. 
My friend had the carnitas tacos. Her tortillas also seemed to fall apart. She was pretty happy with the meat.

The décor is very nice.

That's what the two stars are for.  Otherwise, this was one of the most miserable dining experiences I've ever had.

I was there as part of a large group (40 people) and I have to say they really shouldn't be offering service for large parties because they can't handle it.

We had a fixed menu (which is fine) but even that was kind of a challenge.  Food problems:  We started with a Caesar salad and soup. The salad was warm because it had been sitting there for so long and the soup was lukewarm.  That was followed by a couple of tacos which actually weren't bad.  I made the mistake of getting the chicken for my entrée.  It looked fully cooked, but the texture and taste made it seem underdone.  Nobody at my table who had the chicken finished it.  I did snag some yucca fries and those were good.

Additionally, it took a lot of time between courses.

Drink problems:  Even though we had 40 people at our table upstairs, there wasn't a bartender for us.  Any drink orders had to be fulfilled downstairs so it was a 20 minute wait for drinks.  They did keep the water filled.

The worst thing was that I was seated directly under a bright light.  It was incredibly hot and shining directly on me and another person and our table companions joked that we would definitely confess to multiple crimes before the end of the meal.  The staff was nice and they checked twice to see if it could be turned down at all, but no dice.  Apparently, there's no way to dim a light at Chayo.  


Two and a half hours later, I just wanted to get out of there and I didn't care that dessert hadn't been served.  People were getting up and walking away from the table because it was so excruciating sitting there.

Spending that much of time, sweating like a pig because I'm baking under a heat lamp, waiting forever for a drink and eating warm salad and soft chicken does not equal a favorable dining experience for me.

Initial start was terrible as a hostess at the front thought it was okay to push people (customers to be specific..). What the hell is that about?? They weren't nearly as packed as any other bar at the linq either!

$31 for chips, salsa, guac and yuca fries. -_- 

We initially ordered empanadas with the cheese and creama on the side. But or waiter nick d had absolutely no idea what the difference between vegan and vegetarian was. So we wasted a good 10 min trying to explain it so he could suggest something. Fail. Food was nothing special. Prob wouldn't come back though.

I grabbed a menu and decided on the Chayo Chopped Salad for $12.95. After about 10 minutes, my salad came out. Go check out the picture, that's exactly what it looked like upon opening. I didn't ride in a car, run a marathon, or throw it in the bottom of a purse where 70% fell out of the container. I walked no more than 50 feet before opening the box. As my sister and her boyfriend said, this restaurant should be ashamed to even serve food that looks like that.

I took a bite - everything was bitter, no dressing, and it was cold, despite the grill marks in the rock-solid leek. My sister's boyfriend asked me what was with that ""rotten thing there"" gesturing at the one limp strand of cactus. 

I have NEVER ever sent any food back to a kitchen before, let alone asked for a refund. But this, this was too egregious to suck up and eat the bill. I marched up to the hostess podium and said that the salad was absolutely awful and that I wanted to speak to a manager. Even the hostess had that ""ummm wow wtf"" look on her face when I showed her the salad. The manager didn't seem shocked or anything by the look of the garbage pile in the box I was holding, as if this salad wasn't a joke. She said that I could order something else, but I told her I didn't have time because I had to go to work and that I just wanted a refund which she agreed to do.

While I was waiting on my salad to come out, I couldn't help notice that the portion sizes are laughable. I'm talking maybe 10 tortilla chips with guacamole for $9. Yeah, LOLZ.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,17,1,1,B_PsIlXwV44EXrdxrvIYUg

We shared the chicken nachos and I had the steak tacos ($18) that were probably the best I've ever had, which is a bold statement.

I came here twice during my vegas weekend trip. Once was at night around 1pm when this places turns into a club with a mix of hispanic and hip hop music, we sat outside so we were able to eat food since we had just got off the plane about a hour ago. It was fun in that we felt the club vibe but still able to order food and drinks. The beers were around 7-9 bucks and drinks were around 9-15 bucks. The pear cider that I wanted was out so I opted for a sangria instead, which whooooo turned out strong and delicious! Our group also ordered the fish tacos and carnitas tacos, both orders come with rice and beans. 

Our second visit was in the morning for breakfast. Around 10am, it was fairly busy but with no wait. The chayo breakfast for two suited us perfectly for $26 bucks. The only thing I would NOT recommend at all is the freshly squeezed Orange juice. That thing is a joke! It was 5 bucks for a small glass full of ice and watered down orange juice.

I ordered the chorizo sopes (which is actually listed as an appetizer) and they were super bland. Someone else in their review said that it was authentic mexican food with a twist. I don't think that there was anything authentic about the food.  They looked authentic and had the title, but the taste was nowhere close.  Want Carne Asada?  You can't even find that here. I would've probably been better off just eating chips and salsa, which the waiter was nice enough to make sure that we had an abundance of and ended up bringing 5 baskets of chips and constantly refilling (there were 7 of us). 

I actually went on the mechanical bull, and while that was fun, I primarily came for food, not a mechanical bull.

I enjoyed the atmosphere (a wall of sugar skulls, paintings, and another wall of elaborate crosses), but the music was loud and terrible.  

The food was obnoxiously overpriced, hence why I went with an appetizer, but even that was still $16. 

Waiter was nice.  He's probably what saved the review to be 2 stars.

She was really sweet and let us sit in a booth upon request. Half of the restaurant was empty so we didn't understand why there was a wait but again, maybe it had something to do with them being a short staffed?

Our waiter came and brought us some waters. We ordered some drinks and after receiving them we didn't see him for awhile. We saw two women from another table bring their receipts to talk to him. I'm assuming some drama went down because it wasn't until another 20 minutes went by that another waiter came and told us he would be taking over. Our food came out 20 minutes later and it was okay.

There is a mechanical bull in the center of the restaurant so this is not an intimate dining affair but funny if your in the mood. The service was actually fantastic with an attentive staff! We tried both the short rib tacos and short rib enchiladas which were good. The portion sizes seem balanced so your not over stuffed but definitely full when leaving. Pro tip...always order a pitcher of margaritas and they have a list to choose your favorite poison from...you get your money from it!,b2oS5BgjMigy0_5oV4R-4g,2,1,4,fw0deLEHms-ihOw-MCfewQ

So I decided to take some friends that were visiting from out of town on Monday nite and I have never been so disappointed. We were seated by the hostess and it took our server quite a while to even approach us, when he did- we ordered margaritas.... the margaritas were all mix! I get it, it is happy hour (2 for 1), but there was NO tequila! We ordered the Para La Mesa for our table to share, the amount of food would have been perfect, but the steak was completely chewy, fatty and was VERY salty, the chicken was even saltier to the point that we could not even eat it! The meal also came with street corn, which was seasoned but the crema was served on the side, so the whole street corn experience was ruined! The meal was served to us by a food runner and our server NEVER came to check on us throughout the meal, so there was no point to say that the food was terrible! When he came towards the end as he could tell we were no longer interested in the food, he asked how it was and I mentioned the complaints and he couldn't have cared any less and he brought the bill with no concern. He sure was quick to come collect the payment.

Overall I have to say that I will NEVER go to Chayo again and I am super disappointed to say that as they have a great location and atmosphere, but I don't think that I have ever had such bad service and bad food!",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,3,1,1,uUppwl1u6s9n3890IzQO_g

We had the tacos, which were soggy and broke immediately upon picking them up. It was basically impossible to eat as we were never given silverware or napkins. After sitting there for an hour and being ignored we had to get up and search for our waiter. He gave us a check for $87.00 for our in reality $20 meal. He apologized and attempted to make this right by calling us ""babes"" and ""seniorita."" Long story short don't waste your time and money.

It's located just off the strip, attached to the Linq hotel and casino. It was our last night in Vegas and this was definitely the perfect way to end the trip. 

The chips and queso, with chorizo added, were fantastic. The big chunks of chorizo were seasoned really well and the queso was creamy. 

I had shrimp fajitas with a side of street corn for my main course. The street corn was awesome! I love street corn, and this stuff was done well. 

The BF ordered a steak. He really enjoyed it and mowed it down pretty quickly. 

The drinks were exceptional. I had the pear mule. The pear flavor was really fresh and stood out. It wasn't at all overwhelming, it was just right. 

Service as well was great! Our server was quick and attentive.",wNLZnNNLV8rOGiPjqMPVdQ,0,0,4,DTuqzCRHUDme5CgWVZuNmw

I understand it's Saturday night, but this place is not a club (although people were dancing as there's a DJ), and the music was so unbelievably loud. We didn't want to sit outside because it's so hot so we just had to deal with it.  If you want a place you can sit and eat and have a conversation, this is not it. 

The service was good, but the food was pretty disappointing. My friend said his steak tacos were good, but my steak burrito was abysmal. The food came out really fast (which worries me), and mine wasn't exactly hot. The steak, which was sparse, had quite a bit of fat, and the quality of it as a whole was lacking. And you can't order just a side of guacamole, at least I didn't see it under 'sides'. 

I agree with the other reviewers that the bull riding is incredibly entertaining, as it is anywhere, so there's that. 

Kinda wish I had just taken him to Roberto's haha",RRyU9z6S2e6mpNngh6ogSw,1,0,2,AdgbkeODs5240Cq--GSF1A

We made a reservation through open table.  I was called that afternoon, to make sure I was keeping my reservation.  Not sure why though, the restaurant was not super crowded.  We ordered the queso with chips for 10.00.  It was decent, nice and melty.  The chips seemed freshly fried and were crisp.  They gave us some salsa on the side for free( we were told it was going to be .50).  We ordered chicken fajitas.  I asked if we could have half steak, half chicken.  The server( Jason) said they don't do that, we could add filet for 6.00 more.  It was actually 8.00 more when the check came, but no biggy.  The portion was large, we could not even eat it all.  We had to pay an additional $3.00 for more tortillas.  I got corn( very small), my wife ordered flour.  Her order had 3 tortillas.  The fajitas came with a side of rice, beans, salsa, sour cream( big plus) and a small amount of lettuce and cheese.  Beans and rice were no big deal.  Beans tasted canned.  The chicken in the fajitas was a little spicy, smeared with a greenish paste.  The flavor was good though.  All in all a decent meal for the price.

We were seated right away and were right next to the mechanical bull pit so we had some entertainment. The food was decent, the Guac, which the waitress claimed they were well known for, was horrible. It had way too much lime juice and was runny. The salsa on the other hand was fire! Well worth the $3 for chips & salsa. I had Carnitas tacos which were good once the guac was removed and my husband had the steak burrito which was good. Our waitress started out well but went down hill thru the meal as it became hard to get her attention and we had to routinely ask for the obvious, like utensils and napkins when our meal arrived.

You might be able to share among three people depending how much you eat. Coffee is good but gets cold quick. They need cafe de olla added to the menu.  Service was extremely catering, general manager sat us near TVs playing Jets game, he saw our Jets shirts .  He had a layout of TVs and what on...nice touch.  Walked us to our table and made sure we were okay or would have moved us. Music is diverse. Each song changes to a new genre, from Spanish to Billboard to Classic Rock.

When I interrupted him he looked at me and very condescendingly say ""oh no you're wrong we don't even carry that sauza anymore"" I told him I wouldn't have even ordered it then and he just looked at me and made a face and said ""sorry"" while pushing the drink back towards me. I won't ever be coming here again. I don't like being lied to and I especially don't like being talked to the way I was talked to- I know the bartender could have made me whatever other margarita I wanted and taken the house off my bill because the menu description is false.
