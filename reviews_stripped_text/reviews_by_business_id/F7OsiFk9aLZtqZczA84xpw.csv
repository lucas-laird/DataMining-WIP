188832,2011-08-31,0,F7OsiFk9aLZtqZczA84xpw,"Tonight was my 2nd or 3rd time at this location. Its part of a Texaco gas station and has a drive thru. I ordered at the counter because I needed gas anyway. Tuesday night is their 99 cent leg and thigh special so I got one of those. I also saw a sign for a 2 pc mixed and a biscuit for 2.49. I asked what the pieces were for that combo and the cashier told me Breast and wing, so I ordered one as well. Well I got home and had 2 legs and 2 thighs in my bag along with a biscuit.  Did some quick math, and 2 of the 99 cent specials + 89 cents for a biscuit would of only set me back 2.87 instead of the 3.48 I was charged for the same thing.  

Anyway, the chicken was pretty greasy. I've had better from the SW location near where I moved from. I will probably return at some point because it's right across the street from where I work and it's an easy stop otw home without going out of my way at all. They have good prices and a special everyday, so it's fairly economical.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,1,0,2,GYdQqwQgghv0EeT88dJ5IA

I went to the closest Popeye's near UNLV. I will never go there again. To begin with, one of the staff persons was mopping the floor while food is being prepared, I am no health inspector but I think its a health hazard, it provided an unsafe environment for the worker who were all just wearing tennis shoes. Second, the cashier asked me if I wanted spicy or mild chicken, i told her mild. She said that I'd have to wait 15 minutes for the mild chicken, so I said fine just give me spicy. I also ordered an apple pie, which she forgot to give me, until I asked her for it and said she didn't put on the original reciept.

I could have backed out if informed much earlier before others got in line behind me minutes later..... I then was stuck in line... 2 cars ahead a gentlemen order had been messed up so he returned through drive thru and this caused a 20 minute wait ( just for home to leave after I decided not to order....

Though my visit prior to today came with a show. The customer in front of me apparently had his order messed up, so I checked my bag before I left. They did fine that day. 
Today they were lacking in overall customer service. Aside from the pleasant guy who took my order, no one else seemed happy to have a job. I wasn't asked if I wanted any sauces with my almost 50 dollar order and they didn't give me the bisquits that should have been included. She gave me honey though. 
I attempted to call four times and the phone simply rang and then hung up each time.
After we finished eating I drove my very unhappy self back to the store. 
The manager, Corina, I belive is her name insisted the phone never rang. I offered to show her my cell phone as proof. 
She asked me what I expected her to do. 
I explained that I had driven all the way back. What did she think I  deserve since they had not given me my bisquits the first time.
She handed me my bisquits and said she would speak to the staff. 
I doubt I will ever go back. I will miss the food. But bad service, bad management and rudeness is no way to earn my money.

Also they where mopping the floors and cooking at the same time... the floors where just drenched in water like a huge mess where everyone was still standing and working and cooking food. I got mashed potatoes and then then my friend goes to place her order and they say they are out of mashed potatoes. And then I ask if I am getting the old ones...? She says no, but when I get home- they taste very very salty and sort of dry. They never want to give you more than one sauce and if you don't ask for any, they won't ask you if you want any- you get 0.
Nobody was paying any attention it seems like a bunch of young people hanging out and not even caring at all about their jobs. They need to fire everyone there... it was a mess tonight. I will NOT be going back ever again.",bEhO6RG2rgf-jFAv0th0gA,2,1,1,IbC2bUxbHyh0qZUjJA5s_w
5227389,2017-04-02,0,F7OsiFk9aLZtqZczA84xpw,"You know, I used to believe that rating fast food places on Yelp was a complete waste of time.  I mean, it's fast food so it's never going to be a great experience, but it is what it is so what's the point?  Well....  I found myself in Las Vegas this weekend and I just wanted to get away from the Bellagio for a bit so I used Google Maps to find a fairly distant Popeye's and decided to go for that.  It's connected to a gas station, which isn't really a negative, but for some reason, I always feel that gas station-attached restaurants are always somewhat inferior.  In theory, it should be a feature, but for some reason, it just never is.

First off, there was a homeless guy sleeping inside the place which I guess was ok.  But, then I noticed that the soda machine was completely out of almost everything.  Other visitors commented about this and the reaction was just ""Oh ok"".  Clearly they knew but didn't care to do anything about it.  Also, from peering into the kitchen, the work areas were just filthy.  There was stuff strewn all over the floor and messy containers laid out in the open.  When I got my food, they even got my order wrong so I didn't eat the side plus somehow the chicken seemed scrawnier than usual.   That seemed odd to me because isn't this stuff all standardized and shipped from a centralized distributor?

It actually pains me to write this because to be honest, the staff was REALLY nice.   They were clearly doing their best and they tried hard to be friendly, courteous and helpful but this place is just no.",FnsBQWSuD_SayEmkCuKCLA,0,0,1,NDKfUS2PMIyrasg39f6rfA

I asked her to repeat the number to my order and she looked at me like she was deaf and I said is this my order and she acted like it was my order but didn't care to answer. I sat there looking at her then just grabbed the tray assuming it was my order.",47BH6NXYE0Bp9WVxKC1SOA,2,0,3,yVyStuX_IwvLLAbDmusV3w
5615818,2015-12-01,2,F7OsiFk9aLZtqZczA84xpw,"This location is in the ""ghetto"" adjacent to Texaco gas station on the corner of Maryland Pkwy & Tropicana . But it doesn't bother me whatsoever. I don't eat fried chicken at all ( yes I'm Black lmao ) but they have other things I enjoy here. The sides, and biscuits are my personal favorite . Due to me working out and gaining mass during the winter months, I tend to eat starchy type foods. Rice, beans, okra, potatoes etc.etc. I typically eat healthy and lean throughout the year. But as I said before... it's  bulking season.

 So back to my review... Employees were nice. I ordered 2 biscuits and a side of rice and beans. The food was fine, nothing different from any other location. I read a few of the reviews from others, and I just think people are just going on and on about the location. Probably just scared to come here, but if you're such a sacredy cat go through the driv thru chump.

If there's any review you ACTUALLY read, let it be this one! 

ONLY reason I came here the few times I did was because it is on my way home!  This place is HORRIBLE! Never again. The PEOPLE. The food, inside the building looks dirty!  They talk to each other more than anything, do not even bother to say hello to anyone coming in, the person at drive thru talks like it is our fault they works at Popeyes, always sound so irritated. 

The food here, is always cold, old and obviously sits there for a while. They have conversations in front of customers that should not be happening at the moment. My boyfriend came in here one time and actually argued with the cashier about his food being cold and she argued back like no it wasn't. She ended up saying the cops will be called, so guess what?  My boyfriend called the cops himself and they told him they do not respond to restaurant complaints, OBVIOUSLY. 

So the manager came out and asked What's wrong, my boyfriend explained. He looked at the cashier & asked her why didn't she just give him some new fresh food? Same thing he was wondering. 

It's HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD & A business horribly ran. It's worth it to drive to the next nearest one because this one is not worth a cent!",icISZXd0lUxdh0NneGlfQQ,4,0,1,XcVaysxZ7S_I6_MaHfKvFw

They NEVER have everything their menu says they offer; one time it's no green beans, one time it's no spicy white meat. Tonight I go through & they gave me all dark meat because they had no spicy white meat. Didn't ask me, didn't say anything, I get all the way home to find out there's no white meat, which is all I eat. I call the store and ask to speak with the manager to which the woman replied ""that's me, what's wrong"" with super attitude. I said we were given no white meat, she said it's because I ordered spicy 
& they were out of spicy white meat & if I came back down & BROUGHT MY RECEIPT she would recook the order. By this time she was being extremely rude. Stressing twice I had to bring the chicken AND the receipt as if I was trying to pull a chicken scam or something. Unreal. When I get there she avoided me all together. The rest of the staff were super helpful. The guy at the counter looked at me crazy when I made sure to show him the receipt. He said ""It's all good, where would you have gotten all this chicken""....EXACTLY. We used to eat here about twice a week because it's close and I love their spicy chicken, no more though. I can over look small inconveniences of missing items, but I'll be damned if I'm going to have my time wasted without so much as an apology & then be treated rudely like it's my fault for not just sucking it up. You've lost a customer & if that's how you act on a day to day basis, I doubt I'll be the last.",-In3cQmzHxpKHhQBjae7aw,2,0,1,3xjfXysqWbrJVgZ-jSeMpw

I have been inside once and it was okay. Small because it is connected to the gas station.

Most of my visits are through drive thru, on Tuesdays, catching the Tuesday special. Lines in the drive through can be long, but are mostly always fast. 

Sometimes the guy in the drive thru is not the most friendliest, I guess he is trying to be fast and efficient.

Make sure you check your order. I got spicy one time when I ordered mild. But other than that my chicken is always fresh and delicious.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,3,1,3,g1aoAnlOSHB_Vq0NA9ESxg
