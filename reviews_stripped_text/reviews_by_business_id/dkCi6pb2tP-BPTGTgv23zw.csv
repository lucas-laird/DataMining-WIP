We had the Pork, Chicken, Hawaiian (spam) bao, and sesame chicken noodles  Unfortunately the duck bao was sold out (tip: go early!). 

The baos were very delicious with layers of savory and hints of sweetness.  Each bao was meticulous assembled and wrapped for perfect hand-held eating.

146186,2012-03-01,0,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"So after reading about the chef's story in one of the weekly magazines I decided to give this place a try. The actual cafe was _much_ smaller than I was expecting. I knew it was a small spot in a salon, but I was still surprised at how compact it was. I think some food trucks might occupy more land area than this. Table seating consisted of a pair of tv trays at the corners, but it's better than standing if I hit up a food truck unprepared I guess. The trays could just barely fit two of the bao ""plates"" and two drinks. 

I got the three bao combo of pork belly, chicken, and pulled pork. The duck wasn't ready yet when I was there, sadfase. The baos were served on a wooden plate that was like a chopping board with a handle. The pork baos in particular were so deliciously juicy the paper they were on turned clear and passed the ""window test"". 

The pork belly bao had a nice nutty topping that complemented it well. The belly itself was tender and not overly fatty. 

The pulled pork bao was my favorite. Calling it pulled pork is misleading though, this wasn't a bbq style soft pulled pork, this was super crispy fried awesome. Each bite had a crunch I loved, almost like chicharones. I regret not getting another. 

Maybe part of it was my disappointment at the lack of duck, but the chicken bao felt ordinary. It was moist, and had a flavorful sauce, but it felt a bit boring. It was topped with crunchy chicken skin though which was a nice touch. 

The combo came with a drink and I went with the peach Italian soda. Before eating I was already trying to think up a place to grab dessert but the soda was sweet enough to be a nice end to the meal. Although meal might be an understatement, if you're hungry I doubt you'll get full from the combo. Grab another bao or treat this as a snack instead.

All in all it felt like eating at a food truck: small space, small portions, big flavors, and a fusion-ish take on the food. If you like everything about food trucks, give Great Bao a try.",kYAZadWY7QXGtzo648VUOA,2,1,4,3nK6wgaNCXI8VBp9c8AiEA
303433,2011-12-18,2,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"My adventure bug hit one slow afternoon at work, and I was determined to try something completely new for dinner.  So I perused my trusty friend, Yelp, for some ideas and that's when I came across The Great Bao.  They offered a veg-friendly bao, was located right near where I worked,  AND it was in a beauty salon!  I just had to go!  So at 5 o'clock I hopped in the car with the husband and was off to an adventure.

""It's in a salon,"" I said.  ""What do you mean *in* a salon?"" asked the husband.  I responded, ""I mean, you go inside a salon and it's supposedly somewhere in there.""  ""That doesn't make sense.""  No it really doesn't make sense, but you have to trust me- there is a large beauty salon with a small nail salon right next to it.  Do not peek your head in the nail salon like I did; this is not correct.  Go through the beauty salon, walk past the nail polish, and find the literal hole in the wall.  

We were greeted by Jenny and Chef Sheridan who were both very friendly and happy to answer my questions.  We ended up ordering a bao combo (all tofu) with the mango passionfruit iced tea.  We also ordered the sesame noodles.  The tea was refreshing and not too sweet and went really well with the tofu bao.  The sesame noodles were flavorful and topped with little slices of raw tofu, cilantro, and green onion.  The dish had a nice little spicy bite to it without being overpowering.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.

But to the star of the show: the great bao!  Now I used to be lame in my younger days and wasn't too adventurous with my eats.  I never had Chinese buns before let alone a bao, so this was my first go at anything like it.  Holy crap it was amazing!  I loved the taste and texture of the bao and it worked so well with the tofu and mushrooms.  There were a variety of mushrooms, including some adorable tiny ones, and they were very fresh.  The sauce was fantastic.

I went to bed that night with dreams of bao in my head and wound up stopping back a couple days later.  I wanted to dine in, but didn't have a lot of time. So I called before we left and they graciously made the order ahead for me.  I got to The Great Bao a few minutes later and everything was ready to go and just as delicious as the first time!

If I could make any suggestions it would be to maybe marinate the tofu to give it a little more flavor (yes, yes I know...it's tofu...please no smart comments).  Also, more veggie bao options for me to devour, please!

Give yourself a little adventure and hit up The Great Bao -that way you can say you ate at a restaurant inside of a beauty salon.  And do it soon because I have a feeling they'll be getting a bigger place any day now!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,3,4,4,kXayHHN3bAN8MHGEQ3bUUA

As I walked into the shop location, I came across this extremely strong scent of chemicals; It is located in the back of the salon. I was a bit iffy. I thought the scent would have affected the shop's food. I stepped up to the counter and was greeted by young lady name Jenny. She told me the history of why she and the chef, Sheridan opened the place. Ask them yourselves. They won't bite (you). Haha.

Food I ordered:
Roasted Duck Bao - This bao wasn't as messy as I thought it would be. I thought it'd be a typical chinese restaurant bao. Their bao's at warm and fluffy.
Pork Belly Bao (2) - Unbelievable! I've never had such a crispy pork belly bao before! The pork belly is thinly sliced and cooked to a crispy perfection. Each bite I took was more delicious; I would be able to taste each ingredient.
Green Smoothie - Absolutely delicious and refreshing. I highly recommend this even though it costs a couple bucks more. Sure you're grown up enough to eat your vegetables but the way they made the smoothie will absolutely have you wanting more.

Don't really review much but because of my experience had to write something. First off, this is the strangest restaurant I've been to. It's inside a Hair and Nail Salon/Spa inside a strip mall. Couldn't find it initially, then after 5 minutes of looping the parking lot, found a small sign next to the Salon sign. We walked in and there were two gentlemen in front of us waiting to order. They ordered, then we ordered. The lady who took our order told us it would be a few minutes. We waited for 15 minutes then the lady came up to us and said there are two other orders in front of us so it would be a few more minutes. So we decided to go out and come back. We waited outside eating ice cream because it took so long. She came outside with two bottles of water to apologize then another 15 minutes went by before we got our meal ""to go"".

Left Office: 12:55pm
Arrived in Parking Lot: 1:10pm
Got Lost for 5 Min: 1:15pm
Ordered our food: 1:20pm
Left the restaurant: 2:05 pm
Got Back to Office to Eat: 2:18pm.

Didn't know this was going to be a journey....

Food: 2.5
The food was ok at best. We ordered all the BAOs on the menu. 
1. Duck Bao - Good flavor (probably the best there) Could add more meat though. Just one slice of duck.
2. Pork Belly Bao - Two slabs of 1 inch thick slabs of pork belly. A bit dry.
3. Chicken Bao - Extremely dry chicken. Crispy skin but tasted like they definitely overcooked the chicken.
4. Tofu & Mushroom Bao - Combination of ingredient blended well. Fried tofu but the sauce made it softer. 

Also ordered the Chicken salad because they ran out of sesame noodles. The chicken salad was not good at all. Dry chicken meat with cucumber slices and spring mix? To add to that found a hair in my salad. I know it's not my hair because I don't have hair on my head and it was longer than an eyelash.",wkhweWVgCLxaaF-Z7GHKRQ,3,0,2,IttSHkH6Xq-uN7ZFnTNVMw

As far as I know, they listed their hours from 11am to 7pm.  

Coming from out of town to try this stupid place is a joke. 

First  is to find this place inside this salon off the Vegas Strip, if you don't have a car, forget it because most likely by the time you get there, it won't be open. 

Disappointed but still hopeful that maybe next day I'll have better luck.

We were there around 11:30am, not open, what a surprise. 

Went on to Yelp & realize they change their hours for today from 11 to noon.

I don't know what kind of business does that? Changing hours the last minutes, as if they just woke up & oh, SH*T, it's already 11:10am, let's just post our hours today from 12 to 7 instead. 

If I live in LV, I'll go back to give the owner of this place a piece of my mind in person but since I'm not, it's better for me to just warn you people coming from out of town, try some where else, save your time & money.

Seriously peoples, you got to get down here and give the Bao a try.
I was a tad skeptical, I mean, come on, inside a salon, but once I walked past the receptionist and met the couple behind the counter, I knew it would be a great experience.
The chef is a classically trained chef,  although he briefly talked aboot his career, I now can't remember a thing - other than his meticulously clean and methodical cooking.  He prepares each order carefully, then washes everything.... and start over...

We had the combo (pork belly, duck and beef) boas, and a bowl of sesame noodles.  The duck was beef baos were yum, but the pork belly...*thud*
Yup, that great.
We had to add another order...

The noodles had the right amount of chew and sesame dressing was just right!

You can tell each was made with such care, the thin slices of cucumbers on the noddles, even the julienne scallion looked great on my duck bao...

While we went the way of the carnivore-duck, pork & chicken- there are vegetarian options as well. Each sandwich came with it's own unique & flavorful garnishes-everything freshly & perfectly prepared while you wait. The prices are very reasonable, the service is friendly & solicitous.

That didn't bother us though. We told Jenny we were going to eat it in the car on the ride home. Which we did do. The Bao was ready within 15 minutes . Jenny told us a little about the business and made small talk with us while we waited.

1316018,2012-01-04,0,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"The Look and Feel of the Restaurant
This place is located inside Touch Spa Salon just in the back.  The only thing that really bothered me was the smell of chemicals from the salon.  The place has a few small tables and chairs so you can sit and dine, but the last time I checked, there were only about 3 tables (with two chairs each).  

The Service
The service was outstanding.  The owner of the place is very friendly.  The food took a while to come out, but someone would let us know every few minutes the status our order.  For the most part, after you order your food, you service yourself as there are napkins, straws, condiments etc. whatever you need at the cashier's counter.  

Ordering
I had the bao special which means 3 small bao + drink for $10 (that includes tax).   These are not like the traditional ball-like bao you see in regular chinese restaurants.  They are more like bao sandwiches. I ordered:
Roast Duck - This was delicious.  Very tender.  It's kind of like the stuff they have at chinese restaurants.
Pork Belly - Nice and juicy, full of flavor.
Beef - The least of my favorite as the beef was dry and cold.

Each bao had a little bit of scallion, cilantro, oyster/hoisin sauce on it, but could have used some more sauce.  The order took about 20 minutes to come out (which is a long time considering there weren't too many orders made at that time).  The presentation was really nice.  The bao came lined up on a wooden shopping board. I felt so fancy eating it.  And even when we got our food, it didn't seem like it was piping hot or anything.  It was just warm and some parts of the meat were even cold.  The flavor was definitely good though.  
At the end of the meal, I was still hungry.  It was like I just had an great appetizer and was ready for the main course.  Even my girlfriend finished her whole order of the bao special.  This almost never happens and is a sure sign that the portions are too small.  Usually after finishing my food, I look forward to my girlfriend saying, ""babe, I can't finish this.  Can you finish this to me?""  But this time, it never came.  It never came.  On a serious note, outstanding bao like this can be found at any dim sum restaurant and for cheaper (which is strange considering this place is located in a nail salon; you'd expect prices at Great Bao to be a tad cheaper since operating costs should be lower).

Conclusion
I'd give this place a 3.5.  Their bao are delicious, but it's not anything extraordinary.  The price and the portion is really what put me off.  I know 3 bao + a drink for $10 doesn't sound like much money, but honestly each bao could be eaten in 2 bites.  I left still hungry and wondering if I should go get more food elsewhere.  I probably would not return unless they lower their prices ($7.50 max for bao special) or offer bigger portions.  My reasoning?  I would not pay any more than $2/bao.  The drink should cost around $1.50.",D3tWXNoliAQDyQAQyCa2qg,1,0,3,kVZ1qEVuiaLrvmwo9rE70Q

I wish the smell of acrylic from the nail salon was not so strong. It is very strange to smell delicious baos, mixed with acrylic and hair dye. 

But as for as the food, my husband and I tried all their baos! These baos from Great Bao are delicious.  I actually think we had about 2-3 of each kind... individually! The pork bao was a bit fatty for my husband's liking, but I thought it was still very good. Our favorite has to be the duck! The crispy duck skin is just fantastic. My husband does not like duck, but he really really liked their duck. 

The service was excellent. We dined in, since we didnt know that you could order on the phone for pick up.

1661449,2011-11-17,1,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"Great Bao is a hole in the wall extraordinaire.  It's located in the most unique location of all - in a small corner of a beauty salon.  In my opinion, Chef Sheridan takes the approach much like IN-N-OUT, taking a few items and doing it right.  Of course the restaurant names says it all on his most popular items, but he also serves other delicious sides.

On his bao's:
Have you ever been to a family dinner where you had the peking duck served with only 8 fluffy baos to 10 people, so you really couldn't indulge in the juicy meat with the light and sweet bao?  Here at Great Bao, you can definitely get as many bao's as you want and NOT have to share.  Hubbie and I tried the duck, beef and pork belly.  The pork belly bao was my favorite - it was juicy and warm.  The duck bao was my next favorite.  Chef makes it so that there is a little bit of crispy skin to tease you to want more.  I also overheard that he gets his bao's baked fresh from a local bakery, so no, no, they are NOT pre-packaged or frozen.

I walked into the salon and was greeted by Jenny. Very friendly and hospitable, asking and addressing every customer by name. I ordered the trio for $10, which includes a drink. She even asked how I heard about Great Bao, so of course, I told her from the rave reviews I read on Yelp. :)

Very tasty. The bun was extremely soft (I'm a bread/carb lover). Even though the pork bao was very tasty, I'd have to say I liked the tofu-mushroom one the best. I know, I know, I should've ordered the duck. What was I thinking, attempting to be semi-healthy with my ordering?! Next time, I will.

There were no other customers while I ate, so Jenny spoke with me about their food and business. She was very nice and I'd have to say, I probably received better service from her than the 5-star restaurants I've recently visited. She explained the ingredients, thanked me for giving their food a try, and invited me back. Being from the service industry most of my life, you'd think that sounds easy, but you'd be amazed how many food industry employees do not do that these days. She made my first visit here very enjoyable!

Highly recommend it. It is strange to be in a salon ordering food, but you won't regret it. With some time & great word of mouth about their awesome baos, hopefully they won't be in there for long! :)",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,3,2,5,oL2dgtxSD51I0gLOUuxIsA

We tried everything but the tofu.. but I definitely want to try it the next time around.  Me and the husband went for dinner last night and it was perfect.  Not to heavy... just the right amnt of food.  I loved it.  If I could have great Bao everyday for lunch, I would do it.  I swear it!

Our order:  We did the YELP special!!! 10.00 for 3 bao and a drink.  
We had 1 of each just to get the pallet going and be able to try everything.  

1. Pork Belly
2. Roast Duck -- FAVORITE
3. Chicken

Each Bao was a different flavor w/ different accents.  

My favorite...  roast duck with cucumber, scallion, hoisin sauce .  They leave a little of the skin for crunch... and the texture and flavor was perfect.  

pork belly... the fat just melted in your mouth!  WOW.  This is something I would want to get once in awhile because.. well, it's pork belly.   It's a guilt trip for sure.  The pickled mustard greens and crushed peanuts gave it that extra umph... but the pork belly was definitely the star of the show.   

Chicken-  Was good chicken... hahahaa.  I'd love to say something great about the chicken... but I am in love with the Roast Duck.    I should have eaten it first just to give it a chance, but I had the Pork Belly first., then the Roast Duck and I was just...... wanting pork belly and roast duck!  Sorry chicken!

To top it off... as soon as we were coming to the end of our bao journey.... I decided I NEEDED the sesame noodles.  I'm glad that I did because it was so flavorful!   Cucumber, carrot, sesame vinaigrette with tofu OR with chicken.  1.00 more if you want both!  

I forgot about our drinks!  I can't say much about the husbands tropical smoothie... but the pb&honey?!?!?!? It was delicious.  Each smoothie including at least 1-2 servings of fruit.  3.00 more with the yelp special which isn't bad at all.

We left Great Bao with a ""GREAT"" Bao order... TO GO!  :P  

I love Great Bao.. and it's close by.. and I loved meeting Jenny and Chef Sheridan... they were inviting, very kind, and definitely helpful in letting us know exactly what we were ordering.",Nw6Jza_cb0aqd4PT769Vzw,6,4,5,WRUiQoxURJh-bn_VLJc1DQ

I tried the duck, chicken, and pork belly baos, a raspberry italian soda, and received a bag of sun chips.

The duck and chicken were relatively similar and delicious, though I preferred the duck a little more than the chicken since it was slightly more tender.

In terms of the pork belly, if you like the salted mustard greens that come with most taiwanese dishes such as minced pork and rice, then you will like this bao. Otherwise, you may not be a fan. Since the mustard greens aren't one of my favorites, I wasn't overly excited about this bao.

The raspberry italian soda was great. Get this if you aren't sure what drink to order.

Overall, I was pretty impressed with the experience of gourmet food and drinks served here. If you're confused to the location, it's in the hair salon in the same plaza as the 24 hour fitness.

I know it goes against every fiber in your body to actually believe that this place is located inside a salon... or maybe that was just me. What? Who the heck wants to eat their food inside of a salon?! 

I DO !! 

But only because the food was amazing, as was the service. And despite what some may think, you do end up forgetting that you are in a salon.

Like most others, I did the three bao special that comes with a drink. I got a duck, beef, and pork bao. And while they were all good, I probably wouldn't get the pork one again. It just wasn't AS good for me as the duck and beef one. Hell, next time I go I'm probably just going to get 10 of the duck one. That one was by far my favorite. 

The only down side to this place was that unless you get more than three baos, you will probably leave still a bit hungry. I was left wanting more, but unfortunately did not have the time to wait for another order. 

I hope that they eventually expand out of the tiny space they have at the salon. The food and service is good enough to have their own space, without having to share it with people getting a haircut who are probably judging those of us trying to eat in a hair salon.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,4,3,5,dn28GpwlpvHUPRGJezfG4g

2261971,2012-07-24,2,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"Great Bao was closing their brick & motor location; which up til now I wasn't too keen on going due to its odd location inside a Salon...(I mean, how does that actually work? Food and Hair products just sound so wrong).

But seeing that they were closing (due to lease issues)  it was our last chance to support them. (they still have their food truck where you can have their most heavenly Baos).  We thought it would be cool as ice to take a stroll over to their soon-to-be defunct operation inside the 'house of hair'...

We were at a loss for words....wow.... It's really inside a Hair/Nails Salon and Massage Parlor, and not just by the entrance, it's waaaay inside, past the front desk and the cutting stations.  You can see a small opening with a menu board and paper lanterns like a guiding beacon...oh and yeah, a THRONG of people lined up in an otherwise empty space (thank god, cuz I don't think I could handle hot blow-dried hair and products with my food).  It's really awkward as you're walkin towards it, and the lady at the front desk tries to wrangle you in to get a cut n' blow....

And the Salon is HUGE, it basically has two wings: the right wing for Nails, the left wing for Hair and Massage down the hall past Great Bao counter....It was just so confounding as to how this arrangement came to be...And why the hell did the Salon decide to kick Great Bao out.....they're the only ones bringing any customers in.  It was a multiplying topic of conversation for us as we ordered through a claustrophobic counter window and then waiting for our food to come out.....

Realizing just how makeshift this operation was, it was a fun experience, there were folding chairs and tables by an aisle where we sat, which was close to the Order counter, so we were stuck in a bottleneck of customers waiting and ordering in this confined space, while the rest of the barn stood completely bar of breathing entities.....  Anyways onto the food!!

It's really about the Bao, a taiwanese snack with a white spongy bread that's usually sandwiched with a multitude of various meats. But we started with an order of Sesame Noodles: cold Lo Mein noodles with Sesame Sauce, Chicken, Cucumbers, Carrots and Scallions.  it was alright, maybe not our favorite; the sauce was very light, almost runny and the toppings didn't seem to be marinated or mixed in with the Lo Mein and Sesame.

But whatever, now onto the piece de resistance!!!  We had the triple order of Bao:  Pork Belly with Pickled Mustard Greens and Peanuts, Roasted Duck with Cucumbers, Scallions and Hoisin Sauce and the Chicken with Onions, Lime and Cilantro. I love their presentation, the Baos are aligned neatly on a wooden paddle board wrapped in wax paper for easy pick up and handling!

Their Pork Belly Bao is so delicious!  Thick, fatty Pork Belly that's braised with a thick Soy glaze, it works phenomenally well with the Bao Bun and the Mustard Greens with Peanuts heightened the flavor profile to create a mouthful of savoriness!  This is their home run dish, I could eat about ten of these in one sitting.  But alas, too much of one thing wouldn't allow us to sample their entire menu, so we regulated ourselves to just one...

The next was the Roasted Duck, another favorite and close second, it's as close to a Peking Duck as you can get: with a crispy skin and juicy Duck meat, you get the feel of the authentic Chinese classic with the Cucumber and Scallion balancing out the fatty protein.  And in my book, Hoisin works on everything!

The last one, the Chicken with Onions, Lime and Cilantro was unfortunately, just ok.  We've had the Chicken Tsukune (Japanese Chicken Ball) before, which was incredible, this one was just the breast of the Chicken which was plain.  The condiments helped, but it was just didn't overwhelm us like the the other two did.  Which is alright, you can't always have all three be spectacular.

Overall, we're glad that we were able to support Great Bao on their last day in their shop, and will always seek out their Foodtruck, they consistently deliver great, amazing Baos and We love the Chef, Sheridan Su and Jenny and with them luck at their next location..without the surly Salon!

The woman working the food truck was not friendly at all, never said one word to us. No hello, how are you, or even hey this is what is popular on our menu. My friend and I got the pork belly boa and we weren't fans. I had never had such a doughy bun, it was pure white and looked as it wasnt cooked. im sure it was. The pork was completely fatty and i usually like that but paired with the weird douchy texture i wasnt a fan. Loved the little carrot and minced toppings on top but it wasnt something i would try again.

If i do comeback, i'll br trying something else for sure.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,9,4,2,7ozs9Yy05iP7RanxcFo45A

2470347,2013-01-31,23,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"If this is a new trend of having tasty steamed buns (""bao"" if you read it in Cantonese) following a foot race I'm loving it!  

I had the pleasure of ordering and eating from this food truck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#RRkCwVYiUUhxC2gY4bScQA) back in December after participating in the Las Vegas Great Santa Run as it and another dozen or so food trucks were all lined up in the race assembly area ready to feed the nearly 10,000 Santas who turned out for the event.

The Great Bao truck was easily one of the more popular trucks with a steady line of people ordering food and another group waiting for their orders.  I waited too, but it was until the crowds diminished before I put in my order.  The menu was pretty simple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#nLQH80BQIF9oW2S7iGVl1g).  They basically had four types of steamed buns, bagged chips and refreshments.  The buns were pretty inexpensive at $3.50 each or 3 for $10.  The 3 bao combo also included a drink and a bag of chips!

I'm not sure what I was thinking when I placed an order for 2 buns instead of 3.  I didn't realize my mental breakdown until I had paid for my order.  Maybe it was the temporary meltdown of having run hard for a short distance race or maybe I was just wacky from seeing all that red from the people in Santa suits at every direction I turned.  Anyway, I ordered 1 Roast Duck bao and 1 Pork Belly bao and nothing else since I had collected an armful of race refreshments from other event sponsors.

By this time the staff had their routine down to perfection, and my made to order steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#Sd1ztJyGREFdt-vAbJi7ng) were ready lickety-split.

The Roast Duck bao was delicious.  The plum sauce was just sweet enough as to not overpower the taste of the roast duck, and I loved that they included a piece of green onion which reminded me of the Peking Duck and steamed clamshell buns we enjoy at Chinese banquets.  The piece of duck I had, however, was a bit dry and slightly burned as you can probably notice in the photo that I've posted.

I lucked out on the Pork Belly bao as they gave me a huge piece of pork belly with very little fat on it.  Even though there was a sauce, a smidgeon of what looked like minced pickled veggies and a sprig or two of fresh cilantro all I could really taste was the delicious pork belly and the subtle sweetness of the steamed bun.

This was my first experience with any Las Vegas food truck and I liked it ... a lot!",8Aq_UdlsrjhBwGWb_U-xRA,29,29,4,6wNAnSxxcyBK0jEOrvCR6A

2837556,2011-11-03,4,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"There are certain Chinese snacks that are just downright sexy, and I think it's no accident that two of my favorites have the word bao, one being the xiao long bao (soup dumpling) and the other being the Taiwanese bao with braised pork belly.  Every time I see a photo of either one of these delectable treats, I feel like some food porn music should be cued in from the background (bao chicka bao bao!)
 
As much as I like the burgers at Bachi Burger, their rendition of Taiwanese bao recently bummed me out (nothing sexy about hardboiled eggs).  This indirectly prompted me on a quest to find a place in Vegas that delivered the goods, and little did I know my quest would be completed within a true hole-in-the-wall inside a beauty salon.  Upon walking in I am greeted by various ladies asking if I need a haircut and when I mention I am here for food they direct me towards the back where a pleasant gentleman is literally standing inside a space much like Lucy Van Pelt offering 5cents for psychiatric advice.  

As a first-timer, he recommends that I get the pork belly bao and sesame noodles and the food is prepared fresh to order.  As I am chatting up Chef Sheridan Su, I learn that he used to work in the kitchens at Comme Ca, Society, and Wazuzu on the strip, as well as in Mexico City and Barcelona.  I am inspired by the fact that he packed up his knives upon deciding he wanted to be his own boss and took up his savings to invest in a humble project making food inspired by his heritage, perhaps as a starting point to generate capital for something greater(incidentally, he chose the venue simply because it was the cheapest place available for rent on Craigslist)    

When my order is ready, I take my first bite into the bao and all is right in the world.  The white pillowy bun is perfectly steamed, the salty and unctuous pork belly fork tender, and the critical part missing in the Bachi version is the tartness of the chinese mustard greens and sweetness of the crushed peanut crumble (almost like a streudel) which synergize in perfect harmony.  The sesame noodles are a nice accompaniment with a healthy spring upon chewing the noodles, and freshly grated carrot, cucumber, wood-eared mushrooms, and tofu go well with the sesame dressing.  I probably would have added some chili oil or additional sesame paste to really perk up the flavors, but that's probably personal preference.   Price point for the noodles is a bit high at 7 bucks, but if you want value, probably best to get the 3 bao + drink special at 10 bucks.  I don't know if Chef Su is on his way to becoming the next David Chang, but I admire his spirit and plan to enjoy his handmade bao until he inevitably moves on to bigger and better things.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,5,3,5,nFr-dlJcJjWPxjCdSAN06Q

This little cafe is located inside the Touch Spa and Salon on Tropicana and Decatur inside the same plaza as Walgreen's. A bit hard to find, but well worth the hassle (if you're a little Vegas direction ignorant like I am.)

Chef Sheridan (the owner) is very nice and really seems to know what he's doing and talking about (without being a know-it-all.) I had no idea what to order, so he recommended the pork belly bao and one of the rice bowls. So of course, my boyfriend and I went with his recommendation and went with the pork belly bao as well as the beef steak bao and the chicken rice bowl.

Both the baos were great. I really liked that the pork belly was so fresh and the texture of the meat was nice and soft. It wasn't gamey at all either (I've experienced some extreme gaminess when eating pork belly at traditional Chinese restaurants.)  The pork belly bao had a little bit of sauce in it (I think it could've been hoisin sauce?) I would've preferred it with just a tad more of the sauce, but overall, this bao was deeelish.

Then I tried the beef bao, and the beef was nice and tender too. I thought the pickles were a very nice contrast to the meat here. The beef was very good, but the pork belly is better in my opinion.

Then we had the chicken bowl, (which actually comes in a box) and it was a lot bigger than I expected. It also came with a little side salad which I thoroughly enjoyed -- that dressing is like CRACK. The chicken was very tasty. I enjoyed it more so than the beef but not as much as the pork belly. The rice had a little broth on it, which is a nice change from plain white rice.

I did notice that the prices here are a bit steep, but you definitely get what you pay for -- good service and premium ingredients. Chef Sheridan took his time preparing every little thing and it really showed when eating the food, not to mention how everything was so fresh -- from the bao itself, to the meat, to the green onions and so on.

I believe they are also working on getting a truck started, hopefully it'll get started soon!! Can't wait to try it the next time I'm in Vegas.

Anyway, I highly recommend this place. It's cute, authentic and really hits the spot.

Great Bao's is tucked in a shopping plaza and inside of a hair salon. Yes you read right, a hair salon. Searching for this venue was like playing a RPG game. It is in a hair salon and literally the restaurant is in a shack. NO more than 2 people can fit into the kitchen and maybe 5 people at most can eat at a time. But don't let the exterior decor fool you. Chef Sheridan is no joke on his tiny electric stove. It shows. People will line up just to try one hell all of his baos. 

I absolutely love his concept and his food, obviously. Simple items made to perfection. Order ANY of the baos. They are all great. No lie. I just ate whatever he flowed to me. He started me off with the sesame noodle salad as a starter. A great crisp appetizer worth every bite. Pork belly, Duck, Pulled Puck and a drink for $10. Really can't beat that. Special shoutout to his lady for making those mocha shakes cause we had to hit the road back to California right after. We even ordered another round of 3 bao's for the road. They are THAT awesome!

The bao's were as good if not better than David Chang's Momofuku buns and a clear competitor to Ippudo's in NY's.

Make it a point to visit Great Bao. I rec' friends to go and they are overly impressed.

Holy mother of god - I have just had multiple bao-gasms.  

The dynamic duo of Chef Sheridan of Jenny are like MJ and Scottie Pippen in the world of Bao's.  Each bao is specially hand crafted to perfection.  For 10 bucks, you get 3 steamed buns of goodness with a drink.  

I'd recommend trying one of each but in my opinion, the Peking Duck and Braised Pork are the star of the show.  You really can't go wrong with any of their Bao's but i am so partial to the duck with the smokiness and crispness from the skin.   I'm getting a little excited just writing about this right now.

Chef Sheridan and Jenny are extremely personable and are great people - they even write your name on your order like you're ordering a cup of Joe from Starbucks. 

Just a word of caution - this is not fast food.  Masterly trained and former disciple of Joel Robuchon, Chef Sheridan is perfecting art by steaming each indivdual bun and combinging the sauces, meat fillings and other tastiness.  While you're waiting you can scope out the scenary and even perhaps set up your next hair appointment in their salon.

I am definitely a fan of Great Bao - so much that I will be leaving shortly for my third trip.............in the same day!",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,8,7,5,Dht9Oiav4Mne1dQpQ5kOxg
3077146,2012-03-23,4,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"I was stressed and depressed the day I visited Great Bao.  Once again, I was starting to say farewell to yet another great friend leaving this forsaken desert of a town for a more wholesome and fulfilling place to live.  My usual love-hate relationship with Vegas took a turn for negativity and I could hardly remember why I'm still breathing this sandblasted allergy-inducing air.  My Mr. who has a relentless propensity for optimism (thank heavens for him) decided to cheer me up by taking me out to Starbucks, which didn't help, until I realize that Great Bao was footsteps away.

This place renewed my hopes for Vegas, its random location inside a hair salon makes you think you're in New York or San Fran, it's perfectly quaint and quirky.  Arriving shortly before their closing hour, I was the only one there, a perfect time to meet Chef Sheridan and his fiance, a couple so adorable you'd want to start planning their wedding.  6 seats total, 2 at the counter, the environment is minimal and intimate and all about the food.  While Chef Sheridan makes the food, I stand at the counter and read the various articles written about their story.  You can't help but start rooting for him!  Once an executive chefs at celebrity restaurants like Wazuzu and Comme Ca, Sheridan followed his dream to a Bao food truck, only to discover that following your dream can take you down rocky paths, so now they're at the Bao food stand.

Story aside, the food is absolutely delicious.  I did the ComBao and got three different experiences, all equally tasty.  The Pork Belly was traditional and sumptuous and reminded me of New York's Ippudo.  The Duck had great quality and creativity.  The Tofu and Mushrooms featured three different kind of mushrooms, and have you wondering how they can make a profit with this kind of effort and freshness.  All 3 Baos plus a drink for $10.  Yes, the chef makes the buns when you order them and his cute fiance makes the drink.  It's the kind of story that writes books, no kidding!

Full and happy after three buns, Vegas and me, we're working things out.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,11,8,5,2ZmW9RP5rXNIZj4hukhXbA

They close early - like 7pm - but act like your Grandma and eat your dinner early, damn it!

The 3 Bao + drink (delish Italian soda) special for $10 is a steal for the fun, fresh uniqueness.  I chose three different bao fillings:

 - Peking Duck, complete with crispy skin, crunchy veggies and Hoisin sauce
 - marinated chicken with cilantro and lime
 - Pork Belly with cucumber, green onion and Hoisin sauce

Whichever I was shoving in my mouth at the time was my favorite.  And the buns, so soft and squishy, were utter perfection.

I got to speak to the owner and his wife (?) while he was preparing my food.  I told him yelp had brought me to him, and he said they're getting huge press from us and local papers (I just went on their website and saw they'll be closed for a week coming up for filming a TV show!

The pickled radish adds a sweet and sour component balancing out the duck flavor. The hoisin sauce ties the components together. The flavors complete the ying and yang component. It's the star of the dish - soft, fluffy, slightly sweet, and perfectly steamed with a glistening glaze on the outside. Thumbs up, way up!

Tofu Bao is sweet shoyu (soy sauce), tofu, roasted mushroom, and green onions. Wow! For a vegetarian option, you never even miss the meat. The tofu is soft like pork belly and just melts in your mouth. The roasted mushrooms add a meat-like texture and a smoky flavor. The creaminess of the tofu and the nuttiness from the mushrooms are a dynamic combination and would make any vegetarian or carnivore happy. Thumbs up, way up!

The pork belly was amazing.  I thought I wouldn't like the fattiness of it but when you eat it all together, it was perfection.  I love the chopped peanuts in it because it gave it texture.  

The chicken was delicious.  The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy.  

The pulled pork was good as well.

Tried Duck, Pork Belly, Pulled Pork and Shredded Chicken. All of them are extremely good with a great, varied balance of flavors. My favorite is probably the Duck; and the Pork Belly is super juicy with marbling fat (so beware if you're not a fat lover). The other two are also good, but the best part of the all is the steamed bun itself. It's soft and light like a whipped cloud and perfectly complements the stuffing.

Don't be scared. It's ok to ignore the receptionist as you walk by her -- although a smile might be nice. Make your way to the counter and what you'll find is one of the nicest chefs in town, who also has an impressive resume. His previous position was as executive chef of Comme Ca at the Cosmopolitan. The intimate setting of the Great Bao café allows you to chat with the chef as he's cooking up your order. Think of it as a personalized foodie experience unlike any other.

The sesame noodles ($6.48) with chicken, cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, and sesame vinaigrette is excellent and a hefty portion if you're hungry.

The duck bao and tofu bao are very good but, the real show stopper is the pork belly. It's as tender, succulent, sweet and savory as you'll find. Together with the peanuts, cilantro, and greens it makes for a delicious dish that will make your mouth water. You can get three bao and a drink for $9.25.

Upon entering Touch Spa Salon, the scent of chemicals attacked me and I wonder if that will interfere with my dining experience at Great Bao.  There were two small tables with padded chairs under each table.  

Jenny was very helpful with the menu.  After little to no hesitation, we ordered the sesame noodle and the baos.  

Sesame noodle, choice of chicken or tofu:  We chose chicken.  Wowee.  After the first bite, the chemical smell I had inhaled and worried about was not on my mind at all.  Yes, this noodle was that delicious.  The noodle have the perfect texture, neither soggy nor hard...Perfecto! The noodle is tossed in a sesame vinaigrette, along with julienne cucumber and carrots.  Jenny asked if we want it a little spicy, and a bit of satay was added on top of the noodle.

Choose 3 Bao + Drink:  We chose the mushroom and tofu, roast duck, and pork belly.  We also chose the mango passionfruit tea and that can be made sweeten or unsweetened.  
-mushroom and tofu:  there were three types of mushroom in this bao.  Very refreshing.
-pork belly bao:  the pork belly has a nice crisp to it.  So GOOD.  
-roast duck bao:  duck chicharron w/duck meat.  This is the BEST roast duck bao I have ever consume.  

At the end of our dinner, Jenny bought out to us pieces of sweet creation by Chef Su, bao topped with condensed milk and crush peanuts.  Simple and Sweet.  Love it.

I took their recommended 3 buns and a drink for $10.  While I could have chosen a $5 smoothie for my drink, I had a perfect jasmine tea while watching Sheridan make my perfect Sesame noodle dish.  The noodles were the BEST tasting I've ever eaten- a sublime fresh taste/feel.  The pork belly bao bun was crispy, juicy, fatty, and cooked to perfection.  I normally don't eat duck but one bite into this masterpiece had me ordering a second one posthaste.

The skin on the duck was indescribably crispy.  It was truly without compare.  In fact all foods should use this duck as the reference standard when describing crispy.  The duck itself was soft, moist, and tender.  The bun was a perfect compliment.  Here in Vegas I took a gamble and drove out here and not only found amazing Taiwanese food, but some of the finest quality food on the planet.

More meat was in the chicken than the duck, but both were fantastic and well worth the wait! The seasoning isn't overpowering and all the ingredients complement each other (I especially enjoyed the cilantro).

At first I asked to take it to go because it seemed like there was no where to sit, but Jenny talked me into sitting at the bar. I wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere and I figured, why not.

- duck bao
- pulled pork bao
- pork belly bao
- chicken and rice bowl
- sesame noodle w/chicken (this dish was my fav but over priced)
- italian sodas (vanilla and peach)  Most of us preferred the vanilla

All three bao's had very little meat.  I am no bao connoisseur and compared their bao's to the Vietnamese tacos I've had at the Cheesecake Factory.  The Vietnamese taco's are full of meat and much more flavor.  Granted you only get pulled bbq pork as an option but I'd much prefer to have those.  I really get that happy satisfying feeling after eating those...and I'm quite content after eating them, which was not the case for this place.

The service was impeccable.   They explained what everything was and even how to eat to my brother. They messed one of my orders and then tried to give me someone else's.  But they were so sweet about it.  The messed up order ended up being a good mistake for my daughter.  She preferred the pork belly over the pulled pork that we originally ordered.

4024658,2011-11-10,7,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"Holy Bao Great Bao!

Did you guys know that one of my favorite snacks when I was little (even up to now) are BAOS?  Not only is saying ""BAO"" fun, eating it is ever more exciting!  So what the heck is a BAO?

To be correct on the actual term, in Taiwan it is actually referred to as ""Gua Bao"".  The term bao can be generally described as a completely enclosed steam bun or some sort of a bun, but ""Gua Bao"" is more of the direct translation for the steam bun that is open faced.  (Imagine it as a fluffy taco bread would be the best description)

So how did I discover this place?  Heading into Vegas this past weekend I wanted to make a point to at least try out a local eatery that is high on the list and interesting.  Recently I've read the location in Studio City called ""Take a Bao"" and so since the term BAO was in my head and this listing popped up on yelp, I decided to go for it.  So what do I think of this?

1)  Very cool idea!  I'm extremely high on Taiwanese food and snacks not only because that I'm Taiwanese, but I truly believe that Taiwanese food scene is absolutely ridiculous in terms of their creativity but also  the flavor profile, therefore, I love this idea of bringing in food from Taiwan and China region where it is not the norm.  (I actually hate Chinese Restaurants.. they are all the same!)

2)  Flavor was good!  Fluffy white buns with filling just like I've imagined...  They have 5 flavors and we tried all of them!  (chicken, beef, duck, tofu/ mushroom and of course, Pork Belly)  All the flavors were delicious with the standout being the original pork belly, and the least liked which is the tofu/mushroom)  Pork belly was tender, soft, and delicious while the tofu/mushroom seem to lack some flavor which was expected though...  All other meats were also pretty tasty.

3)  Very intimate atmosphere in a very strange location.... it looked like a small temple/asian setting... cute little window and a tiny little spot.

So were there cons... of course...  (we never expect anyone to be absolutely perfect right?) So what are they?

1)  Location.  Despite how the decor looked, it was actually located inside a beauty shop of some sort...  It was tough for me to find in the beginning but good thing we found it.  

2)  Seating... not much... maybe like 4 chairs?  It's a tiny start up joint with great food but extremely limited seating... so having it to go may be a better idea

3)  Quantity....  The filling was a bit less for my taste as the Taiwanese version usually comes with a big slab of pork belly.  This just seem a bit small for my appetite.  However, it was enough to keep me going and not hungry.  (So it's just me... not you BAO!  LOL!)

4)  Price... it may seem a bit on the high side to you guys... but the one in Studio City cost more!  But if you have never tried it, it's great to give it a shot. (Baos ranged from $3.00-$3.50)

Overall experience:  Great idea, Tasty food, and hopefully they will have their own dedicated place soon.

Would I go back when I'm in the area?  Of course I will!  This niche snack conjures up childhood memories with every bite into the marhmellow like warm soft buns and it is definitely delicious!  So for all those yelpers in LV, go check them out!  And for those in LA who is visiting LV, give them a visit and compare them with Take a Bao and see which one is better!

Enjoy your BAOS!",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,16,11,4,t9K_esS5KAIkYuTVSeGMUw

I cannot pick a favorite because they are equally great.  When the Great Bao food truck opens, I will be sure to follow it.

It was evening when I came in so it was rather quiet throughout the place. I like quiet. I walked up to the counter and recognized Jenny. We volunteered for a Yelp event the week before. I tell you she's good at sales and passing out Yelp flyers. 

Ok, back on track, she explained the menu to me and I ordered the sesame noodles and the combo bao special. As I was waiting, I was served a duck consomme.. how fancy. Did not expect that at all and it was the first time I've had duck consomme. It was surprisingly good especially with the mini diced carrots. 

Noodles next, I did not think the noodles was going to be such a large portion but I finished it all, really quickly mind you. It was simple and to the point. I know it's not traditional but I would have liked mine to be really spicy. Nothing like spicy noodles to open up your appetite. 

And next the baos, I had pork belly, duck and vege. Because I'm generally not a bun/white bread eater, I ended up eating the inside and left a lot of bao. Insides of all the baos I had were seasoned perfectly and had great flavor. Of course my favorite one was the pork belly. You can never go wrong with pork belly. 

Looking forward to my next visit. Hope you are well Jenny and Sheriden. Like I said you have a niche business and thank you for opening and providing us with great baos!",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,3,2,5,vRpwcwCtyCPiLbreezQEJQ

Both of the people behind the counter were really nice. They actually started a conversation with me and asked me questions while cooking. I ordered the comBAO, which gives you 3 baos and a drink for $10 (which is a great deal since each bao is $3). I got pork belly, roasted duck and pulled pork. My favorite is the duck (second would be pork belly). 

For my drink, I got the Italian soda with raspberry flavoring. It's a great way to cleans the palate after eating such flavorful baos. 

I'm honestly hooked! These baos are so yummy! Each different kind of bao has its own distinct tastes and the right ingredients added to enhance each flavor. Definitely a place I'll stop by whenever I want a quick lunch otw home from school.",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,4,4,5,MmYsrxJxUuhtW_lv3WLhyw

I really wish that they had something like this in my area. This joint is definitely one of the hidden gems in Las Vegas. When you take the first bite of the pork belly you'll first taste the crispiness of skin and when you get to the center, the belly just slowly melts in your mouth. The pork belly is cooked perfectly, not overly cooked or too crispy. It doesn't taste fattening like other places where they would keep a big chunk of fat to just get rid of it. This place is different, it really doesn't have that fatty taste to it. And the chef makes sure to utilize that part of the belly so that it brings out all the favors of the dish. It is so good. I still miss it. I tried the duck, belly, and the asian noodles, ice coffee and the tea. The asian sesame noodles was so good too. It has this tropical kick to it. Mmm.... The noodles tasted so fresh and the sauce I really don't know how they made it, but it was good. I highly recommend this place it. If you are tired of eating out at buffets, definitely checkout this place out. I've been to about 5 buffets here and yet I can say, this place left a lasting impression.  Everything that I ate and drank here was really top of the notch. Now that I'm back in LA I wish ate more of it.

I have been eyeing this fab joint from Clint's and others' reviews, and when in the area today, I stopped by for bao!

Greeted warmly by Chef Sheridan and Jenny - she immediately answered my questions with what to order: the special with chicken, beef and duck.  I told her the tofu sounded great, so that will be next time!  I got the mango passionfruit tea too (yummy!)

While I waited, we chatted about their business and other general stuff, and I learned that bao is from Taiwan.  I got to sample the seasonal butternut squash soup (it is almost like dessert!) and learned that their chicken rice bowl is a twist on Hainanese Chicken Rice.  Chef Sheridan told me to try the sesame noodles too.

I was served each bao one at a time (I sat at the counter in front of the register and saw the cooking and prep in action) - first duck, with its crispy skin and chives, then the juicy chicken with cilantro, and lastly, the beef which had a nice brisket texture.

Overall, I loved all THREE!  I need to get back for the tofu bao, the sesame noodles, the chicken rice, the smoothies....mm!  I hope I can get over here to make this a regular spot!

The special of the day was the pulled pork bao which I highly recommend as well.

The answer involves three simple letters. BAO.

I've been wanting to check this place out for a while. I was in the area and found out via twitter that they were open late this Friday evening. (They've been staying open late on Friday nights for the past few weeks).

This cute little cafe is the epitome of random. Nestled within a pretty large salon, you will find Chef Sheridan Su and Jen Jen (it said that on her t-shirt) behind a small hole-in-the-wall counter. It's a very intimate setting and you get to watch them preparing your food. As such, I think I picked the perfect time to try this place for the first time. With no one else around, it felt like I was in their home and as they were fixing me a late night meal, we chatted back and forth getting to know one another.

With a couple as friendly and adorable as Sheridan and Jenny, I was immediately a fan of Great Bao, but how is their food?

I went with the ComBAO. This allows you to pick any three bao plus a drink for $10 (tax included). I opted for duck, pork, and chicken. The bread was so light and fluffy. I like theirs better than The Chairman truck. Each bao had something I liked and I fully enjoyed them all. But if I had to pick one, I'd probably go with duck. Honestly though, that's only ever-so-slightly ahead of pork, followed closely by chicken. According to Chef Su, I was the first to try a chicken wing version--the chicken bao is usually made with breast and thigh meat.

As for the drink, I went with a peach Italian soda with cream. It was surprisingly delicious. For some reason, it reminded me of a guava drink--very refreshing. After I was done with my three bao, Jenny asked me if I was ready for three more bao. What? I was so confused. Then she hands me a basket with three tiny balls of some sort of honey-biscuit-something-or-other. Funny and cute. Well played Jenny.

So a big thumbs up on the delicious food, the tasty beverage, the friendly service, the intimate atmosphere, and the quirky location inside a salon. Plus, I always love meeting awesome small business owners. Everything about Great Bao Asian Cafe is simply fantastic.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,20,20,5,QjoI740EYPgOLJ1Jw_sf-Q

Although the pork belly baos were good, I have to say I liked the duck bao a little bit better.  The skin was crispy and the meat was great.  Unfortunately, after I left, I realized I was still hungry and went home hungry.  So, I actually ate leftovers at home.  Overall, though the food was good, the portions are a little small for me and was left unsatisfied.  I suggest they have a 4 bao combo for $12.  Also, I was the only one there and had to wait a while to get my food.

During the second time, I thought I would try their sesame chicken noodle dish and also had a duck bao.  The noodle dish was good and filled me up a bit more than the first time I went.  It had the right level of spiciness for me as well.  The duck bao was still good.  There were a few more people there when I went this time.  I was second in line and a few more came after me.  Again, I had to wait a while to get the food.  I felt bad for the people that came after me, as their wait was longer (20 min and counting when I left).

I wish I could give this place more stars like the other reviewers.  I have no complaints about the taste, but I don't think it is worth the money and time.  With the size of the baos and the meat portions, I think it would be a good price if it was 50 cents less.  The sesame noodle is a better value at $6, instead of $7.  Contrary to another reviewer, I thought The Chairman food truck's pork belly baos were way better.  Though it was a little more expensive, the taste, bao size, and meat portion was worth the price.  Unfortunately, they were only visiting Vegas for a special event and reside in San Francisco.

I would still recommend people to try this place out, if you want to try bao sandwiches.  They are good as a snack.  Expect a little wait.",2Na5lgDJwN1dPyvLmKmWgg,1,1,3,Ss0j4vv6wLOuqAiqQRJC6Q

Tried 2 different baos - pork belly and duck.  The pork belly was good though I think maybe the sauce could use slightly more acidity or flavor.  The duck, however, was absolutely perfect.  Crispy skin, perfectly cooked duck, hoisin sauce, and just enough veggies to give it texture and more flavor.

I remember trips as a kid to Hong Kong and I would eat bao all day at this one particular stall where we can see them steaming the buns from the street. Every opportunity I see bao, I have to try.

 ABAO-t time we have a place in Vegas!

As far as baos go- these are solid.

The BF and I tried all the types. Personally the winner for me was the duck. The surprise standout was the chicken which was flavorful, moist..not something I would think I would like 2nd best. The tofu and mushroom would be great for fans of hiyayakko (raw) tofu. Beef was tender and reminds me of delicious braised stew I make. The pork belly is for people who love melty fat but I wanted a tad more salt on it. Good little snack or light lunch.

The purveyors of this tasty treat were very nice people. I heard of a bao truck in the works months ago and didn't know what came of it. Apparently, they did buy a truck and inherited a myriad of issues and it never took off....so here they are at a salon.

It sounds like this food is served from a food truck right?  It's not.  It's served from a hair salon and day spa.  Very logical.  

Regardless, the quality of the food and its presentation are excellent.  The steam bread, perfect.  Gently flavored, moist, chewy and pillowy at the same time.  The pork belly is well rendered.  Juicy but not greasy.  Tender pork, fatty heaven!  The roast duck, dense and moist, with smoky ducky goodness capped by crispy skin.  With the addition of the veg, each bao achieves the sweet, sour, salty, bitter flavor and textural balance.  Other versions are also offered including a vegetarian tofu and mushroom bao.

Really good eats that can be appreciated even by those who think Chinese food is General Tso's Chicken with shrimp fried rice.

Prices are reasonable for the quality.  $3 and change for a single bao.  $10 for three bao and a drink.

I'm concerned long term that word will get out and the scant 4 chairs available will always be full. Mind you, I love these little baos enough to eat them at my desk, or in my car... but I just don't see this place as having enough space to serve the demand that this place deserves ! For now, the space works, but once word gets out, I worry. 

I tried the 3 baos + drink for $10 combo. Tax is included and he has a nice variety of drinks to choose from. I felt the price/value was reasonable. I had a delightful mango passionfruit (?) iced tea with my beef bao, duck bao, and pork belly bao. 

I hate to rank them, because all 3 baos were incredible and I'd order that exact same order again and again. Each was served on a perfect bun brought in from his favorite bakery in LA.  If I had to choose a favorite - it would be the duck! The duck had a lovely consistency and he served it with 3 tiny pieces of crispy skin on top. YUM. The beef and pork belly were also amazing.  If I had to offer any criticism at all, it would be I'd prefer the pork belly a tad more crisp, but that's just my personal preference. 

The chef/owner has got serious credentials, and he puts a lot of love into these little baos. Luckily I work nearby so this will become a regular indulgence for me !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,7,7,5,9F1Gsqx8PaB7ZcxWheN8GQ

Sounds a little crazy but OMG I have never had bao in my life until I went there and it was delish and the owner/chef Sheridan is always there serving these lil decadent babies. My fav is the pork and chicken bao. They are these tasty white buns that are super soft with killer fillings. For $10 you get 3 baos and a soft drink.

5353163,2012-07-07,0,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"Brilliant idea!

I am a huge fan of duck and pork belly and combine that with baos... equals amazing! Yes, it is located in an awkward location (nail salon) but whatever. For 3 baos and a drink of your choice its only 10 bucks. I got two pork belly's and a duck. 

The make everything right to order so it does take quite awhile... our group waited for about 30 minutes or so.... then again it was two people taking orders and making the food all together. I have to say i liked the duck more but the pork belly was really good as well. It was very flavorful and they aren't stingy with the meat. 

Wish we had a place like this in OC. So for something different I suggest driving here and off the strip and trying this out! Be prepared to wait though.",8XlZ4F-ZhtAa_YHbhBPibg,4,2,4,5OLxOKJHWxM1oReoCxR65w
5373202,2011-11-22,2,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"It's aBAOt time someone opened up a restaurant dedicated to this delicate Chinese steam bun. The best way to try all the delicious type of bao is to go with another person. Between Vanessa N. and I we each got a duck bao and split the tofu, chicken, beef, and pork belly. Each were magnificent in their own right. The tofu and sauteed mushroom were tender while the fried garlic and scallions gave it a nice crunch. Pork belly is the way to go for melt in your mouth, fatty goodness. The chicken was ok, but nothing special. I could have eaten another of the beef or pork instead. The beef reminds me of a braised dish my mom makes and even more so after I got a taste of the pickled veggie. It was superb. The duck was good, but I was hoping for a little something more. The strip on duck skin was nice, but I would probably go with more scallions. I like a lot of crunch with my duck. It doesn't hurt if I could knock someone out with my breath as well.

For $10, you get a choice of three bao and a drink. Add a large bottle Coke for $1 or a smoothie for $2. Any other hot or cold drink is fair game. While Sheridan is working on these fluffy pillow-like masterpieces, Jenny will mix up a delightful drink. Reading Paolo D.'s review, I went with the Peach Italian soda. I asked for milk instead of cream and Jenny used soy. Always a good substitute. The drink was not too sweet and they use Pellegrino Sparkling Water. Fancy... 

Check in with Yelp and you get a free bag of chips. For a mere $20, you get a substantial meal with a drink for two. Amazing. 

To ease the minds of Sheridan and Jenny, I wasn't watching with hawk-like attentiveness to recreate their bao or to steal their recipes. :p Just a food enthusiast. When they produce such a great product, I cannot see myself do better at home.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,2,5,4v0PPnQTE-A7KjbDxMhmYQ

The staff at the truck were friendly. The Pork Belly Bao we got to sample had good flavor, loved the soft bun and crushed peanuts on the pork was a pleasant surprise, but the pork was half fat, and the fat was slimy, white and cold, we all pulled the fat off and ate it without. I've had pork belly before and it was nothing like that. 
They ended up losing the Smackdown, I wasn't surprised.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,3,2,2,Idk-GTyO0PEsSiDhL5cMrw

5443111,2012-07-07,0,dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw,"First off, can we agree that it's kind of lame to leave a 1-star review for a place you've never even tried?

My bf and I were in Vegas last weekend and were looking for something different than our usual buffets and whatnot, and through Yelp we found just what we were looking for.  It took us three tries before we finally succeeded in trying Great Bao (third time's the charm), and it was super worth it!  

MUY IMPORTANTE TIP:  Check Twitter/FB before you go to find out when they'll be open or if they're already sold out.  DON'T rely on the salon employees, especially when they tell you ""Oh...I think they're at the farmer's market today.  You should check Yelp.  I'm not really sure how Yelp works, but you'd be able to find out there.""  Err...

We each got the 3 baos + 1 drink combo for $10, plus the sesame noodles w/ chicken.   The pork belly (so soft), roasted duck (mmm crispy skin!) and chicken (crispy skin here too!) baos were so flavorful and delicious - it's pretty amazing that you're eating all of this inside a beauty salon, but even if you weren't inside a beauty salon, you'd still be amazed at how tasty everything is!  

If there are other people waiting, you WILL have to wait your turn to get your food.  There are only 2 people working this joint, so don't get all pissy just because you have to wait a few minutes.  Sit on the couch or at the counter/tables if there are available seats, play on your phone, read a magazine.  If you're sensitive to salon smells, sit at the tables outside, your food will be brought out to you.  Good things come to those who wait!!!",03FUGbrmtAPsXdpyxS_aCQ,1,1,5,Zd_1mbp8O0HAQu3MfHxZgw

And the answer is NO....the place is legit and clean.  The setup is like a little side cafe/bistro....with 6 seats total next to the hair appointment check-in area.  

Chef Sheridan seems like a very humble and genuine chef.  He has a food truck that is out of commission...thus the need to continue his business inside the salon.  Points to him for thinking outside of the box and making the most of his situation.

The food is the BOMB DIGGITY and I do reserve this term only for special occasions.  The Taiwanese pork belly bao is my favorite, with the perfect combination of acidity with the pickled mustard greens, crunch of the peanuts, and melt in your mouth goodness of the pork belly.  Runner up is the Peking Duck Bao which is equally tasty with tender duck in hoisin sauce with a little crispy skin and a some crunch from the cucumbers.   The braised beef bao was good...but definitely not as good as the other two.  And there was a chicken option...but chicken is pretty much a vegetable in my diet....

Overall, I will be back many times to this establishment....and I hope Chef Sheridan gets a restaurant some day to match the quality of his food.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,8,4,5,xUqjeIX75Ev5eHUBD6c8bQ

My friend and I got the comBAO for $10 (including a drink). It's in these buns that I've been familiar with when I was younger and living in China - or someplace like New York. I got duck, beef, and pork belly. I preferred the duck the most. I'm going to try the tofu and chicken next, but definitely will be getting duck again. Not so sure about the chicken and pork belly. I love pork belly in general though.. but chicken's not my thing so it's okay.

Their drink choices seem pretty extensive for such a small joint. Awesome. It's in a salon so after you get used to the smell of all the hair products, you'll be able to enjoy your food :D. Plus, service is awesome so that's always a plus!

Very impressed with this little food shop inside a salon. Sheridan was incredibly friendly and even asked my name and made some chit chat with me while I waited for my food. He made the bao and sesame noodles with such care. It was fun just to watch. 

I ordered the combo (pork belly and beef, since he was unfortunately out of duck) with iced tea and a sesame noodle bowl with tofu. The food was delightful and very delicate. The noodles were spicy and delicious. I really enjoyed the tofu and mushrooms on top. They had great flavor and texture. The tea was fantastic too. Freshly brewed and had great depth. Like others have said, I wish the pork belly was slightly crispier, but it was still a solid dish!

I was really looking forward to the duck, but I guess that just gives me all the more reason to return.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,5,4,Sdhc2dgj5ygFcLSVPC62RA
