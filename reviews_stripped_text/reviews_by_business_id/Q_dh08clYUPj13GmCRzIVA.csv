You can see them grill it after you pay and order at the cashier. They put this wet rub too to make it tastier! At first it was kind of iffy to get street food because not all filipino, no other filipino food makes this kind of concept but when i tried it, its bomb and they have this self serve condiments too for all the stuff you buy

When you try it youd crave it especially if youre used to eating street food in the Philippines. Now and then after i play basketball with my friends i make sure to stop by to stop my cravings!

Would totally recommend, try the isaw!",0jYjZZYmWV3ZE9oldxkbig,0,0,5,DLOWNGR6BM_VpXf7qA54QQ

I opted for the 2 choice meal and picked pork adobo and lechon as my choices.  Not much selection, but the food did look pretty good.  My wife chose mongo beans and chicken/pork bbq sticks.

The adobo tasted ok, but was swimming in oil in the serving cup.  Bbq sticks were good.  Lechon was VERY bland and literally had no flavor.  Mongo beans also lacked flavor.

At the sauce counter in the back of the restaurant, sliced jalapenos were offered instead of real chili peppers.  No spicy soy (pata) sauce, either.

We tried, but almost guaranteed will not be back.  Good service and reaonable prices.  But with Fiesta Filipina just up the road on Warm Springs, the choice is clear as to where I will be going for Filippino food.",ZvNDnyc0uTSeelyWXSN-OA,0,0,2,nk0waZyVu4uZIIqGFepFcg

By far the best Filipino restaurant in the area. We've been looking for a place since we moved here a few years ago and the ones near by are NOT good. I didn't realize this was going to be pre-made food in warmers, like a walk up Chinese restaurant, but that was fine cuz we were hungry and didn't want to wait. 

We ordered two 2 item meals. 
I had: Rice and Pancit (half and half)
Kare Kare oxtail
Beef steak
Sister had: Rice and Pancit (half and half)
Kare Kare oxtail (she didn't want to share with me *eyeroll*)
Nilaga Beef

The price was decent paid $15 and some change for both. Portions were decent, we finished all of it and were pretty stuffed. 

Kare Kare was delish, which is very hard to do. We rarely eat Kare Kare at restaurants because it never compares to Nanay's but this was great! Finally! Perfectly seasoned, good amount of oxtail in it. It is made with tripe but I just asked not to have it scooped into the bowl. Veggies were fresh. It was perfect. Second to Nanay's of course. 

Beef steak had a great balance of acid. Beef was perfectly cooked. Nilaga was great. Beef cooked well and fresh veggies. It was all just good. We were both really happy to finally find a place we can go to when we feel like eating food from home. 

We wanted to try the puto and turon but were pretty stuffed so decided not to go for dessert. Next time! 

Keep up the great work! Please don't change!",5nRfzfv6gxiPsgNho1oIiQ,2,0,5,FpCmh-LiBK0JQPILwDOuaQ

1794708,2018-02-13,0,Q_dh08clYUPj13GmCRzIVA,"My Honest Review on this ""Karendirya"".
The Place is Neat and Clean!
The employees are very friendly and very helpful, they are ""MAGALANG"" but they lack of smile a bit of tiresome face or Pagod. But then again it's a place of business and no exemptions if you are tired or not. Food is absolutely Delish! Masarap! Wala akong masabi sa food!
My only reason why I gave 4 star, because of the street food area.

I ordered 5 sticks!
1 stick of Kwek Kwek -3pcs
2 sticks of Pig ears - 6pcs
2 sticks of isaw - 8pcs

1st of all the portion is too small! For that price! (overpriced)
Secondly, tuyo't masyado and no Sauce (if the stick cost $1.39 each they should invest some money for the sauce. Like the actual street food! You don't buy kwek kwek or BBQ without a sauce right?) 
And last but not the least
The delicacies!!! Masarap! May pag ka Pricey but it's worth it.
 
I really recommend this place to everyone who are interested. My Review is Legitimately Honest!

I am hoping to see some changes on the Street-food area but OVERALL this location is absolutely KABABAYAN SWAK NA SWAK!",qvPWDlIPW36ERBOCOIaqTA,3,0,4,OzWS4Meu9Shdh7fOoEKbtg

The place is clean, the service is exactly as I would expect from other filipino chain restaurants. The food is hot and ready to choose from and they also have a choice of food made to order on the spot. I had the lechon kawali which was nice and crispy, a full $3.99 order of pancit bihon which tasted just right for me. Portions were fulfilling enough. I am not much of a breakfast person so yes, I opted for lunch cause thats just me. I did peep there topsilog that someone had next to me and it looked tasteful, yes I noticed their plate was empty so I am guessing I was right. Things I would recommend: adding filipino staple drinks (melon, calamansi not in the can, mango juice not in the can). My son was also looking for bread while eating the pancit bihon so having side orders of pan de sal would be nice. I left a 4star because I know this place has much potential.

I had a last minute catering need for a birthday party and decided to try out a couple dishes from Kulinarya to see if it would be worth ordering a $199 batch of food for my party. I ordered a Tapsilog and a two entree combo with a side of fish balls. I was super impressed. The eggs for the tapsilog were made fresh unlike most quick service filipino places, and the tapa was savory with a hint of sweetness, and the garlic fried rice was spot on. The lechon kawali and adobo we ordered for the combo was simply delicious and was not that oily which is a HUGE plus in my book. I decided to place a catering order after my meal and the staff was kind enough to accomodate with just a 3 hour warning before I needed to pick up for my party. The food was a hit, we had a platter of garlic fried rice, adobo, lechon kawali, beef steak, and a fish ball and chicken bbq combo platter. The food was a huge hit.

2571398,2018-05-01,4,Q_dh08clYUPj13GmCRzIVA,"To be honest, I was a little too excited to try this place out because of their street foods, which I haven't had in 15 years. The authentic kind anyway. My expectations were clearly too high which made lots of room for disappointment.

Food: Cafeteria type of food setting with common filipino foods and a very limited selection at that. I ordered from their All Day Breakfast instead because nothing on their trays looked appetizing enough or something I couldn't cook myself at home. Lonsilog it is! I went a little overboard ordering from the street food because it was only $1! Ordered 2 sticks of fishball, 3 sticks of isaw (intestine) and one chicken bbq. My mom, on the other hand, ordered a meal which consisted of rice and estopado (which I thought was Adobo when she ordered it). They handed her two mountain scoops (and i mean MOUNTAIN scoops) of rice, a small cup with her estofado floating in so much oil. I gagged a little! My meal was delicious, especially the fried rice. My mom said her rice (regular rice) was slimy which she didn't care for. She took one bite of the estofado and didn't touch it again. The chicken bbq was nothing special, the isaw (intestine) had a weird taste to it which my parents kept joking saying that its what uncleaned intestine tastes like and the fishball was the kind you get from the chinese market and not the kind I remember they make from the Philippines. By the way, that fishball was uncooked. I bit into it and it was so slimy that it could have just slipped down my throat. It could have spent a little more time cooking. I have to give it to their fishball sauce though, it was tasty. 

Ambiance: Lots of tables and chairs to sit, high and low chairs. No tv, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how filipino you are. Clean tables, well maintained trash cans, a side area with sauces, utensils, orange water, and a strange gallon of what seemed to be pink vinegar?

Service: There were only two people in the front, one lady watching the grill and one serving. When a line started forming behind us, it became obvious that they needed more help. The girl who served me for instance didn't know how to use their register so the lady at the grill had to step away and come help her while other consumers were just watching them frantically move around behind the counter. 

Verdict: I don't know if ill every come to this place again. They don't really serve anything that I couldn't make myself at home. Like I said, I had really high hopes for the street food they advertise but you're better off going to an asian market and googling a recipe yourself.",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,9,6,2,-F7Z78xbu42YQ9RDWJbJbQ
2592451,2018-02-02,0,Q_dh08clYUPj13GmCRzIVA,"I rarely go out to eat at Filipino spots since I can just eat it at home but wanted to give this place a shot. 

I got the longanisa breakfast. It comes with an longanisa(filipino sausage),egg, garlic fried rice, and slices of tomato. Overall it was good but for 6.99 and only two pieces of longanisa I felt cheated. I think there pieces for that platter would be more fitting. Also the garlic fried rice was a bit bland and too soft for MY taste, and the serving bowl they put it in was a bit awkward to eat out of. 

I also got the pork bbq skewer which was great but then again I felt cheated as they only filled the skewer halfway. Whenever I got that bbq skewer usually i dont have a place to hold it because it's usually filled up. They could just use smaller skewers so at least that way it won't look so empty. 

The only problem I have with this place is probably the portion of what I got. I felt a little cheated but don't let that be a determining factor from trying this place out.",Q_kn-6ELPx3bvPsjIXpzlw,2,0,4,fP3JS5CioB_TNEZz9EWh5g

For both visits, I had the pancit that I thought was ok.  Today, I tried the mongo beans, which was typical.  It was alright.

In my previous visit, they had chicken papaya and pork afritada.  Both were delicious. The chicken papaya had slices of ginger in it, which I like a lot, but not my husband, so I got it all to myself. Yay me!

In this last visit, my husband had the dinaguan (pork stewed in pork blood), kari kari and pinakbet. He said it is the best kari kari and dinaguan he has ever had.  And although he is Puerto Rican, he has had plenty of kari kari and dinaguan throughout our 25-years of marriage to know what he's talking about.

I ordered a combo, with kare-kare and the picadillo. They were both very flavorful! Both not too salty. The bagoong they give to you is made in-house!!! BOMB! I got the rice with my combo, not the pansit. The street foods I ordered were grilled and tasted amazing. The pork isaw was really good and the tenga!

The food flavors where fine but they gave me pork intestines instead of my bbq chicken and there was egg shell in my rice.

I want to like this place and i would come back in a pinch but there are better Filipino spots in town.

I wouldnt go out of my way to come here.",mrNs9-Ml0qe77Lk7NwNdfw,3,0,2,PP65NYBHb8jP8DZNf_QqtQ

And don't even get me started on my side of sabow (soup) All you saw in my bowl was fatty tissues floating to the top! The menudo didn't taste like menudo at all. It was more like an uncomfortable sweet taste. And as much as I love my own detox water, how are you not gonna have regular water? I also didn't like how your sauces are all in an easy squeeze bottle EXCEPT for the pink vinegar stuff. It's very unpleasing to look at. 

The restaurant still looks fairly new so the place it self came with no problems. Just for future advice, I just wish you had more options. No offense, but this was the first and last time I will be going there.",OhtTOqrT_yKzzBYQy52jVA,3,1,1,SQgWXciMBgee2FicWBWV5g

1. Unorganized, some of the viand don't even have serving spoon or tong.

2. Expensive, isaw/Betamax/kwek2x/etc is 1.39/piece... Most Filipino store in Vegas/California, only charge $1/stick. Ordered 3 isaw, 3 Betamax, 2 items for $17.57

3. When checking my food while inside the store... the food were already spilling because wasn't sealed correctly.

4. Food I ordered were dated; ordered pork adobo and adobong pusit.. Couldn't even eat it because of the strange smell... Even my dogs walked away when they smelled it.

Ending up throwing it away :(

Hopefully, the owner able to fix the problem...

5309786,2018-02-11,0,Q_dh08clYUPj13GmCRzIVA,"New Filipino ""turo-turo"" style restaurant in the SW side of town. Upon arrival, the restaurant was empty. Empty as we were the only party there. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The place was clean and had a beautiful wall of art of different places in the Philippines. 

Food...the offer a variety of different Filipino dishes along with ""street"" food. The food was okay. Some lacked some flavor and some were too dry. I personally enjoyed he fish balls the most. It had good flavor even without dipping it in sauce. 

My personally thought was you don't get enough food for the price you pay. In many Filipino restaurants like this, you get 2 scoops of rice and either 1-2 sides. This place only gives 1 scoop of rice regardless of how many sides. Now we all know Filipinos eat more than a scoop of rice. ?

They are really new so I don't want to say I'll never be back but if I do, I hope it's better. They definitely have potential.
