565308,2013-03-02,0,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"I went there 2/27/13 before my 1:00 am flight back to Houston. I really enjoyed my time there, as did the others dioning there that evening. It was Monday so not that busy, but there were usually a few tables in the place, and other patrons in addition to myself at the bar, plus a ""paint while you drink wine class"" in one of the dining areas. The atmosphere is lovely, and I had a great time getting to know the owner Torrey & staff. They were friendly & a lot of fun. The food was delicious, portions were ample, at least on the seafood platter and mango short ribs. The bartender Javi will entertain you and make you feel right at home. As will the rest of the staff. They have tapas, and I believe there are both food & drink specials for happy hour, but I was enjoying my cocktails to remeber exactly what. So stop in enjoy some good food and get to know a great crew. :) I will be visiting again my next trip to Vegas",MeAIAaTnctAJ6AHnvUzB5w,0,2,5,aQw9lhNokpuKkAFtnGx_7Q
584592,2013-02-27,0,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,Been to Blue Water three times. Extraordinary and congenial service. Exceptional food. Great atmosphere. Highly recommended.,C96uoSajsTO-UFPhHqALLQ,0,0,5,wBKOZ1yi8YUorczIReLQJg
699205,2013-03-03,0,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"Recently reopened with a new menu, same decor. If you're unfamiliar it has three areas, a general dining room, a quieter dining area and then the bar area. We sat in the sports bar area. 5 TVs easily viewed from any table in the bar area. We watched some basketball and MMA fights. I can't recall what they other tv's had, but there was a variety for those people who are sports nuts and need to keep the pulse of many different events at a single time. 

Staff was great. You may want to be seated in Bailey's area. He didn't steer us wrong in our selections. As a matter of fact he took excellent care of us. When the Ribeye steak came out he waited to see if it was cooked to specified desires. When he observed it was closer to medium then to Medium rare, he immediately said, ""Let me have that. I'll take it back. It looks a bit over done."" Now, don't get me wrong it was not a poorly cooked steak, it was just a tad past rare. It would have sufficed. 
I had the shrimp tacos. The shrimp was done spot on. Just cooked and not in the least bit rubbery as shrimp can easily achieve. The jerk seasoning was nicely spicy and the cilantro lime sauce was very tasty. 
My friend likes a good spicy bloody mary. She said this one was very good, well, all four of them were really good. Did I mention that the waiter brought the last one complimentary as a peace offering for the steak being a little over cooked? The same steak he promptly replaced with an excellently done steak?
Cheesecake was rich and creamy. All the food was plated very well and appealing. 

On top of good food and great service, the owner (Tory) stopped by to check up on our meal. Friendly guy, seems genuinely interested in making this place be the best it can be. 

We will be back for happy hour. $1-2 off drinks, $2 of tapas. I believe it runs 3-7. If your in the area and are looking for a nice vibe to sit and unwind, I suggest sliding into a booth in the bar area and enjoying some of those happy hour specials. I know we will be back.",twj2PIB68AHxQ_wPPxrHTA,0,0,4,_UsRIEAIvERVlneEIQzDiA
1596413,2013-04-15,2,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"Wasn't impressed @ all with this place. Stopped in for happy hour to try the new place out. Arrived & no one was at the hostess stand. I stood there for a about a minute before someone walked out & he never said hello or anything - just looks at me. I finally said hello & I asked about sitting on the patio. He says he's off duty as he hands me the menus to carry out to the patio myself. I had to stop him & ask exactly how to get to the patio as I had never been on it before & he had already turned & started walking away from me. I am sorry but I don't care if ""you're off duty"" you don't treat potential customers like that - you seat them then find someone that is on duty that can help the customer for the rest of their experience @ your venue. I proceeded to show myself to the patio & seat myself. Another waiter finally came out to the patio. My group did not care for the attitude the new waiter had. It was an attitude that this restaurant was better than any other place & he could do anything better than you. No on to food. Pretzel bread that was served to us was stale & dry. It totally crumbled all apart as you tried to cut it or put butter on it. You definitely could tell it had been made @ least the day before & sat out all night not in an air tight container. Tried calamari & crab cakes to name a few items from the happy hour menu - YUCK! Calamari was completely rubbery & extremely greasy. Crab cake looked like someone put a dictionary on top of it to flatten it out. So squished out it didn't look like a crab cake & super fried (almost burnt) an inch around the edge of the cake. Would like to see some place actually work out in this location as anything that's ever been there has never made it.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,2,1,1,z2HkPdGfXy4txVhBx1XlpA
1676073,2013-04-18,7,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"I attended a birthday party that a friend was hosting at this restaurant. Blue Water is located right next to BJs on Eastern and Richmar. It could be difficult to spot in the dark as the parking lot is not lit and their sign is a hanging banner.

The restaurant is very nicely decorated and I did like the water projection effect on the walls. When we arrived and informed the hostess we were there for a birthday party, her response was ""Oh I think they're on the patio"". Oh excellent, since I know the layout of your dying restaurants SO well. She was not busy by any means. In fact, there was only one other group in the entire restaurant. We found our way to the patio and saw my friends there. The party was suppose to start at 8pm. The birthday girl informed me they had arrived there at 7:30 and were still waiting for their two drinks (it's was 7:55pm by this point). The same hostess popped in and even she looked bewildered that they had not received their drinks yet. She went out and brought it herself (slightly redeeming herself). Shortly after, our server stumbles out and informs us that it's ~*~crazy~*~ in there and says ""so i guess I'll be your server"". It is 8:30pm now and no one has even received water yet, forget about the drinks. Approximately 40 minutes later we get our drinks. This is also when they started bringing out the tapas platters that the birthday girl has pre ordered for everyone. They were beef taquitos with avocado, stuffed mushrooms, and pulled pork sliders. If I could sum up the food and be extremely nice about it, I would say it was forgettable. I tried one of the taquitos (I have had better from the frozen section of Costco), stuffed mushrooms were ok but the flavor just wasn't there, and the sliders were completely overpowered by the sauce. Drinks took on average 20 minutes to come out. Our party had ~12 people and the event was planned well in advance. There is NO excuse they shouldn't have been better staffed and better prepared.

Incompetence and below average food will deter me from patronizing this place again.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,13,5,2,bLI7aIDdORG3vB-F81mQVA
2042299,2013-05-13,2,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"This place was awesome... everything we had was delicious. The prices were ridiculously reasonable. The waiter was super nice--he brought us the wrong drink, caught his mistake, then gave us another free of charge, the whole time just chatting with us and making our whole experience great.

The world would be a wonderful place if all dining out experiences were so delicious, pleasant, and cheap.",A2jvkL3yskY_C6zFkmAqiQ,1,0,5,7o-fVLXyyBctIF_i0K37Ig
3418370,2013-02-02,1,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"Okay so it's pretty difficult to find this place if you have no idea where you're going. It's located right next to BJ's on 215 and Eastern, we went up and down the plaza expecting something small, but it's a decent size restaurant and sports bar. 

We walked in and there wasn't anyone that was by the entrance so we looked pretty awkward standing around looking in to see what if there was anyone that was going to come out and greet us. Someone did maybe a minute after we walked in and we were seated nearby. 

The decor was very nice and elegant, I really enjoyed the table setting and overall ambiance of the restaurant. The booth we were sitting at had direct line to the front doors, so every time someone opened the door it was pretty chilly. If you're prone to the cold like I am (at least during winter), ask to be moved!

Onto the food. My friend got the Blue Water Meat Lover's platter and it looked good coming out and on the plate, but the taste was nothing notable. The meats were not marinated at all and the steak tasted over cooked. For $14, I expected more than just a few pieces of bland meat thrown on a plate. I got the crab cakes and chicken avocado cigars. The crab cakes came as a pair, there were only two for $9 and the sauce tasted like it was made from 1000 island dressing but the sauce wasn't that bad at all. The crab cake was a bit dry, they seemed to mix crab meat and a few other ingredients and then just lightly breaded before frying. I can tell you Crab Corner has much better crab cakes than these guys. The chicken avocado cigars($7), were egg rolls with some chicken, avocado,  tomato, and cheese. It also came with a sauce, the sauce was pretty good and had a nice kick to it. Trying the egg roll with and without the sauce I definitely have to say that with the sauce tastes a lot better. Out of the three dishes we ordered the egg rolls were the best seasoned. Nothing else tasted like there were any seasoning at all, if there was any. 

As far as service, it took us way too long to get our food, no bread or something to munch on in the mean time, and took too long with our check. We spent most of the time waiting around. 

They definitely could use a lot of improvements in service and food, I really feel bad for asking my friend to come out and try this place with me. I'm not impressed with any of it right now and honestly not sure if I'll go back for at least a very long while.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,7,2,2,3AEtuAck_jVpb0Gsrg8q4Q

serious. yep. no wine.     
                   Only for purchase. plus a 'Special Menu' of appetizers and entrees... drinks.

but I must admit, it was one YUMMY!   MAI TAI
I suggest to try one if you enjoy them like we did! 
The wait staff was friendly and attentive with as many of us as there were in a small section of the restaurant. 
Good location, close to other stores and restaurants.

but a bit hard to find with it not having an actual sign up, just a small banner. but I was aware before we pulled up thanks to some friendly yellllpppp reviews. thanks guys!

oh and the chicken quesadilla was tasty. no complaints.",-0HhZbPBlB1YZx3BhAfaEA,3,1,4,p4zZdTCwGRh8s7ioIW5zXw

We enjoyed the drinks from the bar but the second round was super slow, the waiter said he wasn't sure where the bartender went. Overall an ok place for some of the appetizers and drinks but I would pass on the entrees.",QzebJb11d4AIIVi9kCekqw,1,0,2,4QPT4VypbScnaaJqohjHDA
4696656,2013-02-16,1,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"The food, service, friendliness and ambiance all provided a great dining experience for me at the Blue Water Restaurant. It's a great location, right in the midst of where I run all my errands and shopping along Eastern between St. Rose and Silverado Ranch. I've seen this location change several times and I hope Blue Water succeeds well here. 

I was greeted immediately at the door and escorted to the bar where I met the friendliest owner and his bartender, Tory and Javier (sorry if I misspelled names). I've been here before when the restaurant was something else and it was just okay as I recall. Tonight was just a different, better, vibe and food was marvelous. I ordered 3 tapas: Tuna Sashimi, Jerk Shrimp-anadas, and Fabulous Boneless Mango BBQ Ribs. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars was because I have yet to try a full meal but will definitely be back to do that next.

Tuna Sashimi had a nice seared flavor and wasn't overpowered by its accompaniments. Jerk Shrimp-anadas wasn't spiced high like you'd think a jerk spice might be, but was just right for most people I'd think. I like spicy foods so it could have been turned up a notch for me. The Boneless BBQ Ribs were caramelized with slightly crispy edges as I like my ribs to have, and moist inside. Nice idea, to not have to get messy and all hands-in with bones. Hats off to the chef!

I hope more patrons give this place a chance and support a newly opened business run by locals. I hear their website is going up soon and they're already wise on marketing with social media. Good luck guys!",Z1g3_X8wTyTsRsTuEDv2qA,1,1,4,nddTMZROBQY9D_yc_jrpKQ

4843234,2013-03-25,2,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"I had really wanted to give this place more stars for several reasons.  1) The property of this restaurant has never had any success in the heart of this wonderful shopping plaza and busy street.  2) The owner seems to be really nice and really wants to do well.  But we don't always have what we want... 

Blue Water's food really is just A-ok...  It was not spectacular nor was it terrible.  I would not come here for the food again, but i would come back for the atmosphere and the outdoor seating.  I won't go into details about the food we ordered, but if you want a cool place to hangout with your friends, snacking on some tapas, I would recommend Blue Water.  But if you are looking for some eye-opening tapas on Eastern Avenue, I would steer clear of Blue Water.

5607283,2013-02-26,1,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"Blue Water is on Eastern just south of the 215  in the same center as Paul Mitchell the School and BJ's.  It just opened about a month ago, so the hubs and I decided to stop in here today on an impromptu lunch date.

We walked in and were immediately impressed with the decor.  It's a beautiful restaurant, clean and inviting.  It would do well in the evening as a romantic spot.

As we waited at the hostess stand, we heard a large party in the dining room laughing and having a good time.  That was a good sign.  Other than that large party, we saw no one.  So we waited, and waited.  And waited.  No one should have to wait at the hostess stand for more than 45 seconds, so that was a negative start.

We decided to take matters into our own hands and head to the 'sports bar' part of the restaurant.  A friendly face greeted us and told us to sit anywhere we liked.  This was fine, since we both wanted to watch a bit of the NFL Combine anyway.

We both ordered drinks - he a Jack and Coke, me a house Pinot Grigio.  Both were acceptable.

We decided on some tapas.  We ordered the Coco Shrimp (coconut crusted fried butterflied shrimp).  It came with a wonderful sauce that resembled an ambrosia. Good stuff.

We also ordered the crab stuffed poquillo peppers.  Adequate.  Not very complex as far as flavor goes.

I ordered the mango boneless ribs - they were pretty tasty - and well-presented.

Lastly we ordered the pork sliders.  Use caution, they're a bit spicy!

For a dessert, we decided to try Chef Manny's Grandma's rice pudding.  It comes hot in a martini glass.  It was amazing, not too creamy, with just the right amount of cinnamon.  Good stuff.

Overall, I can see why the main complaint is the lack of service.  The food that we did try was pretty good, and we will for sure be going back.  Hopefully as a new restaurant, they'll work out the kinks in the service, and be able to survive and thrive in the new location.",WAE06HmNbNs1E-FGpmaMmQ,2,0,4,2f7ryfpNw1v_g4-vq134RA
5918353,2013-03-02,0,6MIWAI3CX2HfGZhmWPHcDw,"What a beautiful location!  I was a bit skeptical coming here after the other reviews but decided to check it out anyways and I am sure glad we did!  They are really taking out Yelp reviews to heart!  So if you had a not so good experience in the past I would suggest trying them out again!  

We were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess.  I did notice that there was someone always at the hostess stand or in the area watching for people coming in.

Once seated we were greeted promptly by our server and she checked on us during our meal at the right times!  She brought us our drinks and some pretzel rolls!  We ordered the Jerk Shrimp Tacos and the 3 Meat plate.  The foods was excellent!  There were 3 smaller, 4"" tacos which hit the spot!  They had the right amount of spice with a bit of a kick and the shrimp were cooked perfectly!  They came with a Tequila Lime sauce, cabbage and a pico de gallo!  The 3 Meat plate looks much different from the photo already posted.  The plate included chicken, pork and beef for meat.  It had sweet plantains as well as rice and beans and red peppers.  This was a great dish and well worth the price!  

They have a great Happy Hour, $2 off the Tapas as well as drink specials!  

Effective tomorrow they will be serving breakfast on Saturdays and Sunday's.  

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday's they have live music, which starts at 7pm.  We left before the music so I cannot say how good they were!

There is a great, nicely sized outside seating area!  I cannot wait to meet up with some people to make use of this area! Being that they are located off of Eastern, they have glass wall where you can see whats going on if you want too but helps avoid with the smell of traffic.

The bar was cool!  They had TV's so you can watch the game!  This area was somewhat separated from the dining room but you could still see the stage for the music in the dining room! Which was nice!  

I hope that this restaurant will be around for some time!  I'll be back soon!",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,3,0,5,nQI-D0RgcesK6UKCoJ-OaA
