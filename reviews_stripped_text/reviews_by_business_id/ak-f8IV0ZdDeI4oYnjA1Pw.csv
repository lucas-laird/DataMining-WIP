341258,2015-10-26,0,ak-f8IV0ZdDeI4oYnjA1Pw,My local burrito joint. We go quite often with the kids. Highlight is the salsas. Rojo and habanero are the best two. In my mind a good burrito needs good sauce and this sauce is damn good. I usually get the nevada burrito and the kids always get bean and cheese burritos. Tortillas seem home made but probably ordered from a local maker. Either way they are done right. Staff is friendly and the food is consistent and fast. As far as taco shops go this one is a winner. 4 stars when compared to others of its kind,YCQXtbHA45lQd9gibcSElg,0,0,4,bAt4JwjeyUCTJLviICEy-Q

This is unheard of, and I quickly drove to pick up my order... it took me 15 minutes to get to the place, only to discover that it's a drive thru/fast food joint.

I walked in, service was quick.  My food had obviously been sitting for a while.  I signed the check, tipped and walked out.  Laughing to myself that I had just placed a pickup order at a fast food restaurant.

I get home, open the items, which looked ok.  I liken it to Chinese take out.  However, once I began eating, it was quite obvious that I needed some sort of salsa, as the food was extremely bland.  For a place called habaneros grill, I would anticipate there to be some level of spice.  Or at the very least a salsa that I can place on the food.

The issue comes from the worst customer service I have ever experienced from someone when they admired to their error. We called asking for a solution and she snapped at me telling me what do you want me to do about it we were busy, deal with it. She did not offer any solution but telling us we can drive our lazy asses to the store to pick it up or suck it up. I asked for a manager she told me no! I asked her is this how she treats customers, we ordered Uber eats for convenience now our entire meal is messed up and one member of my family is missing out.

The $1 special tacos are an awesome deal! The chicken soft taco one is just like Del Taco's but with way more chicken & tastes fresher, however, I do prefer Del Taco's sauce over the plain sour cream used in this one. The chicken taco al carbon looked plain, as there were only onions & no cilantro but once I added some salsa from their salsa bar it was delicious! I will be going back for these 2 tacos often. The order taker thought I also ordered a ground beef soft taco. It's not something I would normally order but the meat was flavored well. There was only lettuce & cheese on it.

My favorite Mexican dish is a chile relleno, however, they can be hit & miss. This one is prepared very nicely! Normally I'm not a fan of red enchilada sauce on them but this one pairs well! The cheese enchilada the #6 meal is paired with is very good also. Rice & beans are standard. 

And lastly, the 5 rolled tacos w/guacamole for $3.75 is a deal! They are very similar to Roberto's although Roberto's is more generous w/the toppings (not that Habaneros' is skimpy) & may be a little tastier but these are definitely worth ordering.",HyWefmJIsc4SpAF8yjevfw,3,0,5,KKtO-QTlH-6ucRtkA-LWUA

One ""different"" menu item to try is the #26 special. It's a 5-piece order of rolled tacos topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream, guac, and your choice of meat. It's like asada fries, but with taquitos instead of fries. Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share.

Along the way home my husband pointed out Habanero's. He said he wanted to try it so off we went. 

The establishment was very clean when we stepped foot inside, the cashier was very helpful and answered any questions we had. Prices are very reasonable and portions are big, our total for our meals with three drinks only came out to $30. It's definitely a step up from Roberto's. 

Item's ordered:

- Fish burrito
- Carne asada burrito
- 2 carne asada tacos
- Chicken taquitos meal

The taquitos meal came with a side of rice and beans, there were 5 taquitos, which was surprising because most establishments only include 3. They were topped off with lettuce, cheese, and guacamole. The carne asada tacos were served on an average sized tortilla instead of the typical small ones and came topped with tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro, and guacamole, surprising as well since most places charge extra for guacamole. Carne asada burrito was huge, so was the fish burrito. Downside, they use frozen fish sticks for the fish burrito. You could taste them, that's the only complaint. Overall, everything was good and had good flavor. They have a good variety of self serve salsa's as well.

Habaneros is a pretty authentic Mexican fast food joint (think more Roberto's than Taco Bell). 

Nothing fancy, the crowded menu is listed behind the counter. They sell all versions of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and everything in between. Prices are perhaps slightly higher than Roberto's, but a meal of 4 chicken tacos and a chicken quesadilla (which comes with guacamole and sour cream) was around $15. 

I didn't sample the tacos, but my quesadilla was tasty, didn't taste processed, was full of meat, and I had enough left to take home for a small snack later. The guacamole wasn't that good, though- runny and tasteless. Eh, can't win em all, I guess.

The refried beans had zero taste. Disappointing. Like paste.

So I finally had a chance to go and take some food for lunch. I asked the guy if he had rolled tacos filled with potatoes, He said we can do anything you like. I loved that answer. 
I got 5 potato rolled tacos with rice and beans. Everything was delicious, this is the best Mexican fast food I've eaten in the U.S.
The beans and rice  tasted homemade, the taquitos were crunchy and with enough filling. Next time I will ask with no guacamole or cheese, because I got so full. I was able to eat only 3.My only complaint or comment is that I got the habanero salsa and a regular salsa, and the regular salsa was spicier than the habanero one. Maybe they got mixed. Even the salsas are really good and you can actually taste different flavors on each salsa. ( the others fast food places, all their salsas taste the same or don't have any flavor).

I was on a serious Mexican Food craving streak this past weekend and wanted something other than Roberto's. Something fast and not sit-down restaurant style. Ah-ha! Habaneros Taco Grill awaited for me! I previewed the menu slightly on YELP prior to pulling up in the drive thru because umm that's what us true YELPER's do.. Check that place out and it's reviews before stepping foot in to spend some money. Plenty people compared this place to Roberto's and rightfully so. The vibe they gave me had some very similar things in common. I have to give this place a one up on Roberto's because the variety that they have on the menu.. It can be a bit overwhelming in the drive thru because the options seem unlimited! If it's a Mexican dish you want I'm betting they have it and if it's not on the menu I'm sure they can make it! I love the ""California"" style burritos and really enjoyed the fact that they let the customer decide on the meat options. El Pastor happens to be one of my favorite meat type's and I decided on that as my meat choice on the burrito. No additional cost just the flat $5.75! Can't beat that! Most places charge you according to the type of meat you choose to have and I like that they don't. Carne Asada is what comes with this burrito selection at Roberto's so that's all I knew. I think I have found my new Roberto's replacement, who knows we have to see how they measure up on the Carne Asada fries! All in all It great!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,1,4,gvAAs0SxPJ4P1z6MuTr1yg

This is for the newly opened Habanero's Grill # 2 at 604 N. Rainbow Bl., just west of Washington.
If you think this is ""just another"" mex fast food stand, think again. I have to say, I haven't had burritos this good, this tasty, since I left California almost 10 years ago. Habanero's may not be the best in Vegas --- but they're the best I'VE had in Vegas.
I've had the simple bean & cheese burrito. It took the simple fare to another level. The beans were just Better. And it's Huge.
I've had the 3 meat breakfast burrito, that sucker damn near made me cry it was so awesome. I've had the egg, bean & cheese burrito, fantastic! I've had the adobado fries, excellent! 
The salsa bar is the best, too. The salsas range from mild - to pretty dang hot, and I like that.
They have taco specials. Monday is hard shell seasoned ground beef tacos for $1. Tuesday is hard shell chicken tacos for $1. 
Wednesday is 3 fish tacos for $5.
I'm telling you - don't make the mistake of thinking Habanero's is the same old same old, don't lump them in with Roberto's, or Pepe's. 
Habanero's Grill epitomizes all the great flavorful Mexican offerings to be had in Southern California, without having to go there.",Z4-fGDigomv6Yr6TZ93s1w,2,1,5,1hdmMvH8_HXQw0ZZ76n7Cg

Baja Taco was nothing authentic, but the food was fresh and decent enough. While I have no idea if it's the same people, I did enjoy what I ordered here from Habanero Tacos and would stop by again. 

Rolled Tacos with Sour Cream and Cheese ($3.50 for 3) - I didn't choose the rolled tacos with guacamole because from the pictures on yelp the guac looks like the runny frozen type, so I passed. There was a generous amount of shredded cheddar and sour cream on top of the rolled tacos and it all tasted good. I liked that they weren't very greasy either. Solid option and something I'd order again. 

Carne Asada Burrito (5.75) - I asked for just meat, cheese and salsa. The salsa was fresh and the meat was tender with good flavor. My hubby even liked his. 

I can't say the food was anything I'd drive across town for and it's not authentic Mexican food, but it did taste good and the drive-thru is convenient. The guy who took our order was very friendly and verified our order when it was ready ensuring we had everything.

We ordered tacos al pastor 'street style'. We also got chips with guacamole. Our cashier was super friendly, that is always a plus.
The tacos were really hot when they arrived, and they were pretty filling. The flavor was great. Loved their salsa bar. I loved the mild green salsa, and the brown salsa was really spicy. The kind that makes your forehead sweat!

As for the chips and guac, nah. I will pass. Regular tortilla chips, with some sort of melted cheddar on top, and then slathered with an avocado mixture that looks as though it was run through the blender and poured on to the chips. They were just ok. But the tacos! VERY good, and I am glad that we stopped.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,4,4,4,jDCci1hSR-XEdV99RSGwsQ

They are on UberEats and closest to my house so I decided to try it out one day. And not gonna lie I love this place! I love their habanero hot sauce, it gives my meal that kick I need!! 

The price point is great and it's worth every penny!! I initially ordered carne asada fries, shredded beef chimichanga and beef tacos. I was surprised at how much was in each combo plate! And I ate every bit of my chimichanga! My fam ate all their plates too and it was sooo good! We compare it Roberto's and hands down I've been coming to Habaneros for months now instead of Roberto's! 

I always order a shredded beef chimichanga with hella habaneros sauce because it's life! Only recently I've discovered their chips and guac! It was amazing!! It's their crispy crunchy chips with guac on top with melted shredded cheese and it's delicious! It's like $5 which might be a little pricy, but you get a big wad of chips with more than enough guac and cheese for every bite! 

If you're looking for somewhere new but something familiar at the same time! Check out Habaneros! I pretty much crave this spot once a week! OH AND they have a drive thru!!",V0GV8oGj4G_u5MBZEZt18Q,5,3,5,cyLcNGJMyTkV3JmRl5KvlQ

My choice of meat, nachos, beans, and cheese.
First bite: Hard. I bit into stale nachos and tortilla.
Next couple of bites: Where's the cheese? There was no cheese in my nacho burrito, whatsoever. There were no special instructions to take out the cheese or anything, so why am I missing the key ingredient to nachos?
I ate it because I was able to put some guacamole and sour cream from my brother's quesadilla plate and make my Terribly Dry and Stale Nacho meal salvageable.

Usually the burritos are stuffed but im a bit disappointed lately that when I unravel burrito it's been mainly tortilla and a little amount of meat I hope management addresses that because this is literally my favorite burrito place.

I am sure that I will be returning and trying other dishes.   Don't expect fancy as this is a old fast food place (Burger King or similar) and the clientele is an indication of the food.   At lunchtime the crowd is mainly Hispanic labor workers which just tells me that the food is good and a good value.

I came here yesterday and idk if it's because I was sooooo hungry but the food was delicious. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, nothing special because it's my safe food when I try a new Mexican joint. The tortillas appear to be handmade, nice and thick so they don't fall apart when you load up on sauce. The meat was seasoned perfectly. Huge portion comes with pico, and guac. I got some spicy red sauce for them and ohhhh sweet Jesus was it delicious. The 2 tacos I ordered came out to about $6 because they're not your average taco truck tacos. These things were massive. He gave them to me in a carne asada nachos container to be able to hold both. Super yum. I'll definitely be back.

As soon as took a bite of the first tamale, they skimped me out on the chicken barely anything in the tamale. The second tamale was pork, person making it thought I couldn't tell the difference between pork and chicken.

I usually get either a surf and turf(not on the menu) or a chile relleno burrito. Both or legit and they def don't skimp. Along side is usually carne asada fries, plain churro and a horchata. Can I say that none of these fall short of quality? This is as close to the border taste as I can get on the west side of Vegas. And oh, the salsa options are amaze balls. Esp the salsa verde.
