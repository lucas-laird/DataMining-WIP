Their mild wings were seasoned just right and delicious and the 14"" flat pizza (not Chicago style) was so good, it was halfway finished before I got home. Fortunately, it was cut into small slices which made eating while driving easy.",PWRJdCRafTE60OTkn3JCCQ,0,0,5,HkMphOPRLXN0eaSSgUafxg

2976419,2017-03-16,0,8EU78DspV7ORFRXr9BPxuA,"Stopped by one day after work since it was near home to get a Gyro and an Italian Beef.  Was a little hesitant since everytime I pass by, there are no cars parked in front of the restaurant.  Food was alright.  Gyro meat was a bit on the dry side, not enough Tzatziki sauce even when I asked for extra, asked for a wet Italian Beef, not wet enough.  Oh well.  Nothing for me to rave about.  Decent food, nice people, just was a bit surprised that their prices were a bit higher and portions were a little less than Windy CIty.  I'll think long and hard before going back  So for now, I'll stick with Windy City.",RQj6Lo_h2wbMMdb9iizK7A,0,0,3,OGk3gtEbErZWalfQduqYyA

I know another poster said the doors were locked on Saturday, so I'm guessing it is no longer in business.  Can anyone provide information?",gqf9cFDyA2sb9WjLRNn1yw,0,0,1,BIMM5Hlfz5R2cOOO-4vzCw
4061644,2017-04-17,0,8EU78DspV7ORFRXr9BPxuA,"Ordered pizza, wings, fries and chilli cheese dog. Food was okay. Rating 1 star for overall experience (food mediocre, food cold, no utensils/condoments included, inaccurate food description, not satisfied). Wings were okay. Chilli cheese dog had a soggy bun but was okay. Pizza was thin crust, not chicago deep dish like description said. Paid for extra toppings (Pinnaple & pepperoni that were an additional $1.50 each). Save yourself the time, go somewhere else.",ZBaL79EHn8Ki7YJlVJFj5A,0,1,1,qzQm2MM_jHc0783Vb1RpxA

4462971,2017-03-11,0,8EU78DspV7ORFRXr9BPxuA,Finally a real deal Chicago restaurant in Las Vegas. So many in the city claim to be authentic but not close.

4618424,2017-03-04,0,8EU78DspV7ORFRXr9BPxuA,The pizza is very authentic...but it's not the THICK MULITLAYERED Chicago style pizza that they have pictures on the sign in front of the store... but still extremely good.  The Chicago dog is great! The couple who runs it are so nice... VERY CHICAGO.,86qcHJ_VYdQ_6RK0NsvEJA,1,0,4,ipxpjY0nOppN4bBJJO_ZXA
5259879,2017-02-25,0,8EU78DspV7ORFRXr9BPxuA,Tried to order.  They didn't have a delivery driver and couldn't give a time when they would have one.  Not a great start IMO.  I was looking forward to trying a new Pizza place.  Maybe next time.,M5NCXnGqQtDUk75FR3Tf8g,0,0,1,tznflM6wMxmFzMF-OoPNzQ

A variety of crust thicknesses to choose from.  The medium or thick crusts are best bets.,IIumEd4NKdw9Iglfx6NjWA,0,0,5,MmeKn6jVjwtkXz5VzMt6cg

For Tony H, get a life you have no idea what good Chicago Beef is.  Their beef was so juicy and flavorful and nothing close to Potroast. Better than Windy City and Als Beef.  The owners are great people and keep the restaurant very clean.  If your expecting 5 star, go to the wynn.  If you want great food and service with a smile, Chicago Cravings is the place.",B92PPmbiUFIRg1fJXeEF7A,3,2,5,0rqXDUQ1l_W8uT5rdez4Jw
