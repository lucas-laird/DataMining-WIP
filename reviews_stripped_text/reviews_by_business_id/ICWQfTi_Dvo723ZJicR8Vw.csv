I guess it is still new, since they just open few months back. It is a bit smaller than the Seafood City on Maryland Parkway. But their selections r well stock for your basic needs.

We go here once in a while because it is kind of pricey. We particularly love the chicken skins and the vinegar dipping sauce. My parents enjoy driving 30-40 minutes to get here for the variety of fresh seafood available. We ordered the gutted roasted pig for a family event one time and it was definitely a savory hit.  I have 4 stars instead of 5 due to the pricey packages goods I can find cheaper elsewhere in international good sections as well as the crammed walking space.",r2WaO2eiaJiey35Dh-jotQ,0,0,4,gwzWyB8ACDDtk-uaDLpNHg

Went to this Super market and bought brown jasmine rice. I noticed larva inside the bag!  After seeing that, I decided to throw it out, thinking it might be a bad batch of rice....  

Went back there trying to give this place a second chance today and bought Bok Choy, Green beans & Salted eggs.   Got home and started to wash the vegetables and found small worms.  So I then I decided to open up the Salted Eggs and as I was cutting into the first one, low and behold, mold inside and in the yolk!.... not just the first one i cut, but the 2nd egg i cut, WAS MOLDY AND WATERY!  

At this point, I give up. I go back to the grocery store and approach the cashier and show them the product that they are selling.  The cashier then says, ""sorry ma'am but I can give you a refund""..... then a couple seconds later she says, ""sorry ma'am, but the only thing we can do is give you an exchange... we will give you another one"". ........wait, WHAT?!?!? DO YOU HONESTLY THINK I WANT ANYTHING FROM YOUR STORE AFTER THAT?!?!

After all this, I've been convinced to NEVER ever shop at this grocery store again... it not only is a health risk.... but IT ISNT SAFE! (even after I  tell the cashier that it wasn't safe, she still found a way to drive me away!)  I guess that didn't matter!

A few cons:
-A/C was barely working. It was 106F outside that day, so add in the people/crowd, the fish frying/cooking station.. The heat/humidity inside didn't help.
-After shopping, there are some bake goods near the door, and a cashier next to the display. After making my selection, I was informed that these items were not part of their menu (it was a little bakery shop inside the market) and I had to stand back in the regular line to purchase them.. I think their display placement was misleading.

Pro:
-Clean bathroom

The disgust on her face was priceless in Vons as she ripped me apart of ""yes it's great to be healthy and have lean meats, BUT she couldn't do crap with what they had"", we had burgers that night lol.  

Short version of review:  Definitely thrilled that this marker opened on the west side of town.  Yay!!!!

Pacific Island  is conveniently located on Durango and Tropicana where Fresh N Easy used to be (for those who keep identifying the ""small"" size of the market).  The market offers all basics and necessities for home cooking, which may I add is great for those like me who unfortunately had to suffice for meats and veggies found at Vons and Sprouts when you don't want to go the distance of the east side.   Produce is fresh, the only thing that looked limited was fruits, but I assume it will vary by season.  Aisles are short but abundantly stocked with all sorts of goods from condiments to noodles to snacks, etc.    

Outside the grocery section you will find PhilHouse and Bread Republic.  I have yet to try the bakery, however PhilHouse is awesome!  Portions are plenty and flavors are zesty!  The sisig is my fav as beefsteak is my husbands choice.",or80c6AIaubbsk2daap3Fw,3,1,5,SGy6ReTufrBXFUgIJplmNQ

The bakery is cash only. Why? The store and foodcourt accept debit. 

Finally got to try the food court. Went here after church. So around 10:45am. Went to get a few things. Most of the people flock to the back to get fish & meat.

2. Only few dishes are good tho-sinigang, barbecue, mechado, afritada and kare-kare.
The taste of the food is not consistent. Sometimes it's just right but sometimes it's salty, like their tahong. And the ginataang kalabasa at sitaw was sour the last time i ordered. It's weird.

3. Watch out with the breads near the windows.
They don't cover the windows from the sun or move the breads from it so at the end of the day you will notice the breads (like packed pandesal) having little dark green dots (amag). I took all those breads, brought it to the cashier and told her about it and she just said ok. I didn't think she cared at all.

1488969,2016-05-15,7,ICWQfTi_Dvo723ZJicR8Vw,"I'm thrilled that an alternative to Seafood City opened up on the west side of the valley and definitely makes this place very special because it specializes in the mass level of products from the Philippines other then a Chinese supermarket. It may not be as big as Seafood City (east side), but this place definitely looks much cleaner and is well organized. The staff I saw were all Filipinos and that helps a lot! Most Chinese supermarkets staff are Hispanics and some doesn't seem to understand English and I get frustrated when I can't find the product I am looking for. Hahaha!

I agree with the other reviewer that the aisles are shorter than normal, but as long as they have what I need, it's all good! The Sarangani Bay brand of fish are all in one open freezer section and that is so clever! Other supermarkets have them in different places. The seafood and meat area have great selections and seem more fresh than others. The prices are lower here but perhaps due to their grand opening.

This place surely hits the spot from veggies to canned products to satisfy your Asian needs. They also offer short order of Filipino dishes such as combos, all the grilling, and the deep frying goodness! The bakery also gives an added bonus to your one stop shop of fresh baked goodies made in-house. However, it's a small bakery so there may be limited options.

Island Pacific Seafood Market surely makes the Asian grocery market more competitive! And this place makes it on the top of my list! From just being minutes away from my work and IKEA, and easy access to 215, this place deserves great stars!

1. ""Beef for stewing"" package is of very low quality. Took 3 hours to cook and you can tell by the looks of it that it is not the best meat part/cut. 
2. One of the older man serving at the fish/meat section who weighs and cooks fish products is a pervert and was constantly asking for tips. Though, he makes it sound like that he is joking, he does talk about it each time.

Right as you enter you are greeted with the smells of fresh baked goodies and filipino pastries at their bread republic bakery.

The layout of the market is fairly simple. You start with the vegetables which wrap around towards the back and transitions into the meats and fish. You can choose pre packaged items or get it cut the way you want.

In the middle aisles you have the necessary ingredients and spices for a multitude of dishes. They have a few aisles dedicated to those filipino snack cravings. 

In the far side, oppose of the vegetable aisle is the frozen area where youll find tons of ice cream from the philippines. 

The marketplace is fairly clean and offers the use of their restroom in the back. Its not the nicest but better than having none.

The checkout lane can get fairly packed since there is only a few lanes available for checkout. Id say about 6 with sometimes 2 or 3 cashiers. The staff has always been friendly since ive gone.

1821728,2016-08-28,0,ICWQfTi_Dvo723ZJicR8Vw,"New Filipino Market that we visited today. For what they are trying to accomplish (just like the Sea Food City and 99 Ranch Market place at Maryland Pkwy), the place is too small. As you enter, there are two different independent tables to the left and right offering you buy their food. One is a Dessert table and the other a Filipino street food table. There is just too much going on in a span of a few seconds as soon as you enter. Instead of observing which areas you'd like to shop at, they have you, forcefully, buy their food. The Dessert table is a like too aggressive (pushy). Being that it's new, the place is clean. We bought food at their eatery, PhilHouse & the food is good. Their Chicken bbq on a stick is superb. The flavor is so perfect, just like how it taste like in the Philippines. The food that I ate is flavored great, balanced and taste just like Mom's cooking. It was just too crowded. There was only 4 registers so the line was long and there was hardly any space to walk about on. We all had to walk sideways to get from one space to the next.

1962000,2018-01-15,0,ICWQfTi_Dvo723ZJicR8Vw,"What a great little find. This is the cleanest Pinoy supermarket I've been to... very neatly-wrapped produce; no leaking styrofoam trays, etc. Big plus is that they're the only Asian market that sells (at least today) fish roe (""bihud"" in Filipino) - not fish eggs (like caviar) - but the full sac that contains millions of eggs (see photo). They call it ""Buffalo Roe"" (whatever - just glad I found it). Also, it's the only small niche supermarket that I've seen that sells the following: barquillos, Navarro's crab paste and a frozen pig's head. A big plus is that it's a (less than) 10-minute drive from where I live - and I don't have to schlep to Maryland Parkway or fight for parking in Diho/168 Supermarket.

The rest of the groceries you will find in a Diho, or Seafood City, so if you're loyal to those places, then this won't be a tipping point for you - unless you live in the area. Also like other Asian markets, they'll fry your fish for you. 

There's also a small food court that sells the usual - Pinoy bbq, fried fish, chicharon bulaklak, etc. - again, very clean, but I have not tried the food, so I don't know if it's any good. There's also a bakery that looks pretty comprehensive.

As the name implies, store stock features a good selection of fish- and they were appropriately priced and fresh, with fairly clear eyes compared to other places in town. Unfortunately, their beef, pork, and chicken options were more limited and somewhat overpriced- they do have traditional sausages like longanisa available. 

Their produce section is fresh but also limited, with few herbs available and an emphasis on specialty veggies such as chili leaf and bean sprouts rather than having a selection of tomatoes or more than one lettuce. Some items I thought I should be able to find here were not stocked.

Store staff are around but busy stocking and not particularly able to help you find an item.

It was during a Friday but almost every aisle has boxes with an employee unpacking, stacking and pricing merchandise. Why would they do all this during the busy day and not when the store is close, the store is not that spacious to be doing all that and worse part some are chatting and standing around by their boxes. The pastry area could use more space. Food area could use more dessert options, they can just get the egg pies and flan from the front pastry area and sell it by slice. And when I was occupying the restroom, someone keep trying to open the door (3x) even after I said ""hold please"". When I got out I apologize by saying ""sorry"", it was an employee and I know how it feels when needing to use the restroom and needing to get back to work but her face towards me was furious. Employees should have separate restrooms to use that way they don't keep repeating to try to open the door when someone is using the restroom, they only have one restroom/toilet for men and one restroom/toilet for women. 

Wish the place can be more spacious and have better supervision if their going to be doing all the merchandise unpacking, stacking, etc., on a Friday, that way customers doesn't get frustrated trying to go through from one aisle to another.

Did you know a nice big chunk of fresh Ahi tuna is only $5? Well it is here! I took it home, seared it, sliced it and made three salads just like the ones at cheesecake factory for a fraction of the price. Now that's awesome. 

As you walk in further, there's a real open market feel, with hard to find fresh vegetables and full fish with scales in open ice. There was even a boar's head in the freezer section. There were specialty items glore and quite a selection at that. 

The only strike against it was the cleanliness of the shelves and the selection of mainstream foods. It would have been nice to pick up some yogurt, but I get it.

They have a good selection of seafood and meats. Not the largest selection of fruits and vegetables. Most of the items are reasonably priced. Check their ads items get cheap. They have ube ice cream and ingredients to make halo halo if that's important to you. The aisles are tight and they only have 4 cash registers.

If you're not looking into grocery shopping they also have PhilHouse. They serve all kinds of cooked food. The foods actually not that bad. You can either take it to go or dine-in.

They had different kinds of fillings that I haven't seen available in Jersey, like banana, mango, coconut. They also had ones I was more familiar with, like condensed milk. Place looked pretty clean. And we actually had a shopping cart that wasn't broken down, like when we were in Seafood City. Our cart here had a handle.. haha. It really doesn't take much to make me happy. Items also are geared for Filipino/ Pacific Islander/ Asian shoppers. Just like Seafood City, they have a wide variety of items, produce, meat, and fish. One main difference was their eatery area was smaller. In Seafood City, there were multiple vendors to choose from to get food, and a lot of tables and seating. Here, there was one main food vendor, but they did offer a wide variety of foods that was similar to all the different vendors at Seafood City, and not as much places to sit and eat. I'm assuming most of their customers get their food to go. It was also located in a higher income area of Vegas, as there were significantly more Palm trees and grass here, and the neighborhoods/ homes had more of a California feel. Another reason I gave them 5 stars is because they had lechon belly (pork belly) roasting on a spit above fire. Looked soooo delicious! If we lived here, I would definitely order a whole slab everytime we had a house party. So sad we don't have this place or Seafood City in NJ/NY area! They really should open one up on the East Coast! They would do well over there. Our friends here tell us they have only seen them on the west coast. Sadness!

This is bad customer service and also at its worst!

I'm not Filipino but I love Filipino supermarket because they have all kinds of different seafood.
Just like Seafood City on Maryland, this place also had many kinds of seafood. When you get fish (a whole fish with head and tail) in Las Vegas, it's usually not very fresh looking. You can tell by looking into fish eyes. In Greenland on Rainbow, 100% of their whole fish look like they died a couple weeks ago (super old and smelly). This place, I found at least 20% of their whole fish was fresh looking with clear eyes which is very good and very rare to find in Las Vegas. Very nice!! I loved they had live blue crab!! I didn't see live lobster tank here, but I'm sure they 'll put one in soon... (I hope.) 
As a seafood lover, this place is absolutely amazing!! You can pick fresh looking fish and bring it to the front and they can clean the fish and grill it for you. Nice!! The grilled squid looked so delicious with the special sauce.

I didn't really look through the whole store yet because it was crazy busy (opening weekend) and this brings me to the one thing about it that I didn't like...
The set up feels terribly cramped and unorganized. When you walk in there's one narrow entrance to the right which is partially blocked by people checking out, and to the left is kind of the same thing so you have a traffic jam right in front. Not to mention the food counter is right there and the line was crazy long so you have all these people jammed up on that side. 

It took patience and a pry bar to wedge ourselves through that mess and once in aisles are small and jammed with stuff so brush up on your cart skills as you maneuver though this store.
That being said, the selection of stuff looks pretty decent and pricing isn't too bad although I passed on their shrimp because Smiths had larger shrimp for less dough.

On their pansit they try to cut corners by using a lot of tokwa vs meat or shrimp ingredients. Be careful of what you order cause their always seems to be an added cost of $.50 for some reason.

2. They put chicken drumsticks on sale for .50 cents and it was so old and nasty like they were diseased, had to dump that.  I'd rather go across the street to Walmart and purchase meat there. 

3. Bought pandesal (Zambales brand) the minute you take it out of the bag it shriveled to pieces.

They have a meat counter where I was able to get some pork belly and beef short ribs. The meat is fresh and service is friendly. Everyone I encountered was actually very helpful and seemed  happy to be there. There's a a Goldilocks Bakery in there that has lots of yummy pastries and cakes too. It used to a Fresh N Easy store so it's not huge and not small. Plenty of frozen goodies available as well such as frozen shu mai (Chinese dumplings) and frozen lumpias ( Filipino style egg rolls ). Convenient! There's even a fast food restaurant inside that I will have to try out next time. Lots of mangos and even fresh whole Jackfruit. Kinda cool not to see exotic fruits in a can.

Fyi, right in front of the supermarket there are parking spots marked for the animal hospital adjacent to them. Even though those spots are closer to seafood city,  do not park there. Someone left a couple shopping carts behind my car probably because of that even though there were multiple free parking spots for the hospital that were vacant.

Been here twice and will definitely be back. The supermarket has a lot of variety. One good thing I like about this place is that you can buy fish, have them clean it and fry it as well. I love eating fish but hate the smell of it when you cook it at home. 

They also have a fast food place where you can buy cooked food and eat it there too. My husband's favorite is their chicharon bulaklak. 

Next time, will try some of their local delicatessen. Filipino kakanin like suman sa lihiya, puto, mamon, ensaymada, banana cue and so much more.

So many to mention, definitely a must see and try. Only thing though is that a bit crowded as they try to pack in as much stalls they could.",APJZG-Mt2VklE63dJOiiZQ,1,1,4,nbNGYHPqBFryXtyVgBF_sg

*clean
*new
*good selection of produce
*competitive prices  (at least for now, during grand opening)
*philhouse restaurant & a turo-turo (point-point) eatery line-up upon entry.

When I lived in Vallejo I liked this place better than seafood city, because it was better priced and closer to home as is the case still, just now here in vegas.
I'd give this place a 4 star if:
*one skinny shopping cart didn't take almost the whole aisle way
*didn't have extra items for sale, displayed on boxes in the Isle way making the space even more narrow.
*the meat area was so chaotic and unorganized. my wife wanted some fish fried and the 1st butcher directed her to the middle station. As soon as she gets there she tells me the butcher immediately starts talking to her in tagalog and my wife isn't pinay. Then everyone starts jumping ahead of her so rudely and the guy doesn't care and just goes on about his business and blows my wife off while she is trying to ask him for further assistance and find out if she's in the right section since he's  just going ahead with the other customers behind her. I hope they can work on this, because we would really like to support this part of the market too.
*the checkout counter at this supermarket is supersmall, to where you have to wait for the cashier to ring up enough stuff, so you can put the next items on, and once on, you have to manually push them through or hand it over because it is that small, where there's no automatic belt. On top of that is the container of Toblerone  (a chocolate fave of my people I notice) amongst other things that you or the cashier have to push around to make room, kinda like that old skoo plastic game that has numbers on squares jumbled up and you have to shift it around with your fingers to get them back in numerical order (hopefully I didn't just date myself here:(",8oYMqhC5fhqAK_yxRjE7dQ,1,1,3,0u_qdNVmUKBCnNpmaPW1xA

We usually come here to get frozen tako (octopus) to make Tako Poke. 

It's a lot like Seafood City but smaller yet designed well and in a more convenient location. 

They have a good variety of fresh vegetables, seafood and Filipino snacks, ice cream and the usual stuff you would find in a Filipino grocery market. Definitely more options than the tiny Filipino markets popping up all over town. 

The design definitely makes the space feel smaller than when it was a Fresh and Easy market but they don't need that much space. I like how they have more than enough space for a bakery (Bread Republic - fresh pan de sal) and a quick serve restaurant, Philhouse. 

There's usually a line at the registers but the cashiers are fast and friendly so you don't have to wait too long. 

Prices are fair and I'd rather go here than Seafood City, less traffic and always good parking and friendly service. I can't wait for their Silverado Ranch location, even better for me!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,10,8,4,XhFsqBcK934u5OUjHg6i4g

This market is located in an area where there is a surge of grocery items that one can find when needing Filipino and Asian products on the West/Southwest side of Las Vegas. What you'll come across once you enter:

1) Bread Republic- Filipino style bakery with hot and fresh Pandesal (Traditional Filipino Dinner Roll).

2) PhilHouse- Quick Service Restaurant (like a Filipino style Panda Express)

3) Fresh Fish and Seafood section (Cleaning Service and Frying)

4) Produce (Vegetable staples and popular veggies for certain Filipino dishes).

5) Canned and Vaccum sealed items that are popular among Filipinos and Southeast Asians.

Overall the market was clean and organized. The staff was friendly and helpful just overwhelmed because its been busy every day. Compared to Seafood City, Island Pacific is smaller and could use more open space. The main reason why I didn't give them 5 stars unless they expand into Tuesday Morning.

FYI:
A good portion of the products comes from the Philippines but you can find items from China, Taiwain, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,4,1,4,d5htgBSwLTOfrx13PuZzlg
