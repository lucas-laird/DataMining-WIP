It's just not quite in the same quality category as my beloved Me-N-Ed's in Central Cali.  But it IS Brick oven pizza and it IS pretty good!!  Average price, fantastic friendly staff and gelato!! The BBQ chicken Pizza is a family favorite.  Maybe that's why I am not a huge fan.  I prefer the classic pepperoni and extra cheese (sometimes add pineapple and jalape√±o) or a combo.  I am not too big on the BBQ mixin with my Pizza. Anyway... I digress.  This place is not to be avoided! Not sayin I am running here every time I crave pizza... but I never complain when the family requests it!",0m8n4al8qpSYoAhQfSDpHA,3,1,3,NV3U_kiyX1oHTNrmzFK1bg
