20122,2015-04-28,1,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,I have been going here for 15 years. It has always been hands down the best place in town. It has been quite a while since we have been there and a special occasion brought us in. The place didn't just go downhill it took a nose dive. When you first walk in the door there is a foul odor that smells like a backed up sewer trap. We sat at the sushi bar and were met with lackluster service and slightly below mediocre sushi. It was possibly the worse sushi I have had in years. While we were eating I noticed the ledge of the sushi bar had what looked like black mold scattered on it. After years of recommending this place we will NEVER be back.,GXCmbCh_P2MNpn-o0VFLjg,2,0,1,4Gpm-_JNlqaDRS0RKpMWtQ

Not much of a menu for those not into that cuisine. However I did have the Garlic Edamame. Great taste but way overpriced for seasoned soybeans.,1kpLPxJMQKApKj0dz3_tCQ,0,0,1,NEkmxT94J3sXM1EPEK3T3Q

Sat at the end of the sushi bar and asked the couple next to me for their favorites.  First thing I ordered was ""garlic tuna sashimi"" and it was incredibly good!  Then I ordered the Apple Roll which I had read many mention in reviews and it was amazing and a combo I'd never experienced in all my sushi experiences!  I then ordered the albacore sushi, which is my test of all sushi restaurants and it was perfect, so I ordered another :)  This is the best and most unique sushi experience I've had in years, ever since the famous Nozawa retired in Los Angeles. And fairly priced, too.  Excellent service and complimentary amuse bouche and sliced orange at the end.",LDTpWO2hDcguDxU4W941AA,0,0,5,JA7bp8ZgehdVhIy6LQomow

Four tables eating some at the sushi bar.
I have traveled a great deal in Okinawa, and all the Islands of Japan. I have lived here for 21 years. 
With out a doubt I had the worst dinning experience in this establishment that I have had in years. 
Start with patrons, I baby screaming for the entire time. 
Mother and 3 kids 10-12 years old that thought this was Taco Bell, or Micky dees anyway scream at each other, playing tag, and climbing in and out of chairs like they were the play yard. Now we have six tables and and it is like an outdoor play yard. 
We ordered Spicy Tuna it was barely eatable very fishy. Anyone who eats sushi knows that you should not be over wheeled by the old fish flavor. Next ordered Shrimp Tempura, cucumber salad was terrible, house salad was lettuce with lousy house dressing. Shrimp was fried Panko flacks. The veg. We're fried in cold grease, and terrible tempura batter mix. 
We paid 89.00 for a terrible experience. 
This is a very fair review by someone who has travel all over the Orient and this is bad.",gt0KuGhFZB-6wPEJ4x-1Ew,0,0,1,pkyMOuDXgI4-gL8fPzeq4w

125790,2014-08-13,0,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"We arrived around 4:30 to an empty dining room and only three people sitting at the sushi bar.  We told the waitress we would like a table and she tried seating us at the smallest table in the room right next the entrance of the dining room.  As I said the place was empty so I asked if we could be sat next to one of the windows.  The two women on the floor began talking back and forth to each other in Japanese for a couple minutes and seeming very perturbed we wanted to move.  I didn't see the big deal again as there was no else at any of the tables but for some reason they kind of made a big deal about it.  Another couple came in a minute after we sat down and sat at the table they wanted to with no problems. Now because the waitress seemed to know the couple she took their order first and only came to get our drink order after she chatted it up with them for a couple minutes and took their full order.  She then came to our table got only our drink order and never offered us water.  With in minutes the other couple had the first half of their order and their drinks brought to the table with our drinks coming out five minutes after.  My wife and I normally just order traditional rolls and sashimi but will order a specialty roll if its not packed with cream cheese or fried fish.  Not a single specialty roll on the menu was without one or both of the ingredients I mentioned.  I had read about the apple rolls from other reviews but was unable to find it on the menu.  I had to ask the waitress if they still served it and she showed me where it was listed on the back of the sushi order card with no description just simply a tiny line that said apple roll.  The quality of their fish was sub par.  The yellowtail was rubbery and tasted as though it was a little past it's prime and the spicy tuna roll was sixty percent tobiko and mayonnaise.  Needless to say I was unimpressed with the food asking for a box to take home the leftovers because I hate to waste food but I couldn't stomach anymore and as a chef hate to see uneaten food come back to the kitchen and go in the trash (which is where I put it once I got home as my stomach was majorly upset).  The bill arrived and was way more then it should have been; instead of being able to review the bill on an itemized receipt they had hand written out the bill and stapled the sushi order card to the back of the bill.  So I took out the staples and read the order card.  They had given me the other couples ticket which had way more then we had ordered and of course the other couple had already paid what I assume was our bill and left.  I called over another women who seemed to be the manager, showed her the ticket and explained the problem.  After another ten minutes they brought another hand written bill and a new order card stapled to it.  I don't know how they do their pricing but compared to my favorite restaurant Osaka's we got half the amount of food for what I would have paid there and I wouldn't have had to use a paper napkin and talk over a tv playing sports center.  Bottom line this place gave me a bad taste in my mouth in more ways then one.",JfVwDsU452CQ3LWiTiRzuA,0,0,1,qpeywQHD9m-H285oCBY-sg

I came for lunch on a Wednesday, and walked into a busy restaurant.  I sat at the sushi bar, which feels very clustered and crowded.  The bar is high up, and right in your face so you must really look up at the chefs to order, it isn't comfortable.  

I didn't order a lot today, so this review doesn't reflect the majority of the menu, but should still be a fair picture of what to expect.

I ordered Tuna nigiri, and Mackeral nigiri, along with an Arizona roll (yellowtail, green onion, topped with yellowtail).

Tuna $4 - Nice and tender, not overly flavorful but a nice texture.

Mackeral $4 - Tasted a bit ""fishier"" than mackerel should and a bit tougher.  I wouldn't order it again.

Arizona Roll $9 - The yellowtail was chewy, and the green onion was too dominating.  Only after drawing this dry roll in wasabi and soy sauce did I enjoy it.

Order as much as you think you can eat, and make sure to share your sake or beer with the sushi chef...nothing is more fun than a liquored up sushi chef!  Plus, once they start pushing their custom creations on you, then you know you're knocking on the door to excellence.

Although the somewhat erratic service has in past months made a poor impression on visitors that we take to Sushi Fever, this week the service was solid. We took friends from Salzburg, Austra -- one sushi enthusiast, and one who went for the grilled shrimp -- and they were delighted, especially by the American-sized portions. While one of our friend's entreé, which included both miso soup and salad, arrived all at the same time (as opposed to miso soup first, tasty house salad with ginger dressing second, and entreé third), which made it challenging for him to manage all the delicacies set up on front of him.

My friend Sandra, who doesn't get to eat much good sushi in landlocked Austria, and my husband and I ordered our usual assortment of sushi, with Joe's special ($16) being the centerpiece. It's a large roll with deep-fried prawns and tuna and avocado on top, covered in the place's ""special sauce"" which is red, very liquid, and delicious (and definitely has some ginger in it). The salmon sushi, the California roll, and the spicy tuna roll were also very fresh and tasty. For dessert, we usually went  with just one scoop of green tea ice cream, which cleanses your palate and is a satisfying end to a tasty and healthy dinner.

You can't go wrong with any of the special rolls on the back page of the menu- the #2 and the #3 in particular are good choices because they come with a large, great roll topped with a seafood salad, so it's like getting a free app with your roll. Other favorites include the Carrot Top (topped with fried, shredded carrots), the Something Sexy #2 (topped with grilled mushrooms and onions), and the Linda Special (topped with grilled peppers and onions)... in addition to tons of toppings, these rolls usually all come with their own dipping sauce. Authentic Japanese sushi this is not, but the rolls are great nonetheless. 

The best rolls here will set you back $14-17, but they're large portions (usually 8-10 pieces) and packed with fish and ingredients rather than rice. Sashimi is good here too, served with fresh lemon, radish, and shiso leaf, and cut nice and thick.

I've found the service is best when eating at the sushi bar. You get a cucumber salad and edamame upon being seated, then place your orders and get fresh orange slices to finish.

They have a lot of things going for them: good fish, open late, friendly service, and some really great rolls. I would suggest sitting at the sushi bar- it's a very pleasant experience between the sushi chefs and the other diners, who tend to be a friendly crowd. However, they have a split restaurant of sorts, one side with the sushi bar and tables, and the other with Teppanyaki. I generally prefer the sushi side, but I have gone with groups for Teppanyaki and it was also a good experience (consistently good food, great service, and not too loud), so if you're a big Teppanyaki fan, they do that well too!
One of the difficulties in finding sushi in Vegas is the tendency of restaurants on the strip to charge exorbitant prices for mediocre fish- Sushi Fever charges reasonable prices for good fish (and pretty good portions too!) and great service.

The pricing is my biggest problem with this place. We eat here every so often as its close to the house. Normally order out. We ate there tonight and I ordered a water. Rest of the group ordered misc drinks. Got the combo plate and was charged $2 more for beef. You have to read the fine print on the specials. For just my dinner and 2 cali rolls bill came to about $35 for just me without tip. I asked for a to go box and was given a teeny tiny box. Was afraid to ask for a bigger one as there might be a styrofoam charge additional so I just crammed everything in there and went on my  merry way.
Place had a nice vibe. Big tvs everywhere. Not a whole lot of seating so come early and not during prime dinner times or you will have to wait.
Pretty average food not worth the added charges. Portions were small. Other specialty sushi was good but again the prices were a high compared to other places and nothing especially great. The teriyaki beef that was an additional $2 was silly small. About 6 little pieces of meat with a splat of teriyaki sauce and not the best quality cut, kinda chewy.

At Sushi Fever you can expect good quality fish all of the time and it's consistent because they don't mess around with happy hour specials or (AYCE) all you can eat.  For the best experience sit at the sushi bar and get to know the chefs.  My favorite things to enjoy here are: 

The Yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeño served on a cold plate.  For a little extra spicy kick you can ask for it served with a little Sriracha sauce.

Rock & Roll: Crab, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, w/ a cucumber wrap outside sprinkled with sesame seeds and a chef's special dipping sauce. (No rice or seaweed in this one)

Kiss of Fire: Spicy crab, tempura shrimp, cucumber, soft shell crab, and albacore tuna inside.  Jalapeño on top with extra spicy ponzu sauce.

IMO they have the best cucumber salad out of any I have ever tasted anywhere. The Spicy California Roll is excellent here as well.

Uni when they have it is fresh and delicious.

The Monica Roll ($15) was pretty tasty with spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, tuna, and spicy mayo. The letdown of this roll was the accompanied dipping sauce-white, watery & tasteless mayo-ish sauce. 

I also ordered the Jay Roll ($16) which was similar to the Monica but it had salmon, yellowtail, and jalapeño. The spicy ponzu dipping sauce was so delish that I dipped my Monica roll into this sauce. 

I also ordered the Spicy Albacore roll. (Forgot the cost.) This entree may be the only roll worth getting bc it was too unique. The roll was formed in a circle topped with ultra fine fried carrot strings that tasted like sweet potatoes. The actual roll was sweet and ponzu salty with the cold freshness of the albacore. My mouth was dancing on a Japanese cloud 9! 

I also ordered a Soft Shell Crab hand roll ($9.25) with avocado. Apparently it cost $1 more for the avocado. (The server didn't advise of the extra charge.)

In short, my first non-AYCE sushi experience may most likely be my last bc the value is better at the AYCE. I didn't feel that the fish was more, or less, fresh than the AYCE. The service was very  attentive.",3hF073ccmk1WuBEOZNtZqA,1,0,4,g9nGcB3y3cM02Vdvd8kxbA

The worst thing is although I didn't say anything at the time I was at the restaurant I have called to speak to the manager for the last 2 days and have not received a call back.

The waitresses/waiters are really nice. A lot of them have what I order memorized which makes things easy since I can be a bit high maintenance when it comes to ordering my sushi. My favorite item to order here, hands down is the Apple Roll. It consists of salmon, tuna and yellowtail with avocado wrapped in green apple with a dot of Sriracha on each piece. I like it because there's no rice so it is the perfect low carb option for me. They serve the Apple Roll with spicy ponzu sauce with cut up scallions in it. The sauce goes perfectly with the tart taste of the green apple. So delish and refreshing in the summer time! I crave these often and am pretty much hooked on this place as a result. Be forewarned it takes a bit longer for them to make this because of them having to cut the apple, but it is well worth the wait. I'd suggest to order a few other items so that you have something to tide you over in the meantime.

They were both very, very tasty, but the Love Me Tender was my favorite. Both were full of fish, not rice, and came with their own sauces, so I didn't even need to mix up the soy and wasabi.

They seem to come over to my table and push the food closer and closer towards me as if I'm not eating fast enough. Food seems rushed and I feel bombarded when I'm paying the bill. The only reason I still come here is for the food, because the customer service is defiantly not up to my standards.",0DrOgFbLUwMvQySYfIYBsg,0,0,4,X3VJP06e0d_Sz9aOLlx-ug

I'm not a big fan of AYCE and since this place doesn't have it, there is no pressure.  Some of the AYCE places insist you eat everything even if you hate it, which makes for a stressful dining experience (you will eat all of our crappy sushi roll, or else!).  Plus, I always end up leaving AYCE sushi feeling sick and swearing off sushi forever because my friends order too much crap and only want the fried rolls covered in cream cheese.  Maybe I need better AYCE sushi friends. 

Here, all the sushi is quality and the sushi chefs are terrific.  I'm willing to pay more for good quality sushi in a fun environment.  If you like spicy, try the Jay Roll.  The Gail Special is also really good.  I agree with Robert T, eat at the sushi bar if you can.  Much better service and more fun.

When the server brought it back there was only $6 when she should have been returned $17.  My mother got up and told the lady at the front what had happened, she was returning her the rest of the money when the server came by and asked what was happening. My mother explained the situation again and our server disagreed and said she had only received $30 from my mother which still would have made her a $1 short in the change she returned back! The two ladies were speaking in their language and refused to give my mother back her money. My mother explained that she would not be leaving them a tip and would never be returning!

2713318,2011-12-16,3,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"I had one of my best experiences here. Not because of the food. To be honest, since my father is a chef -- I have high expectations when it comes to Fine Japanese cuisine and this spot does NOT do it right. My father trained the chef who trained the owner of this store and for that reason ... My mother and I ventured here when I was craving raw fish in Las Vegas.

To be fair, getting good sashimi and such in Vegas is quite a task. This place is local to my mother's home, and due to the familiarity of how this chef was trained, we decided to take a shot.

What made this experience so great was that my beau, who is completely allergic to fish, was ready to rumble in the ring -- to make me happy. His lips puffed up as he ate but he kept a smile on his face. My mother and I were both mutually impressed. And he made me happy ... Ok this is coming off wrong. I'm not happy that he's allergic, I was happy that he cared to make me happy... Whoa whoa whoa! Back to the food story:

Alright so service, not so good. It was slow, and the waitress forgot to give me my miso soup and cucumber set. When I asked her about it, she said ""Oh I didn't give you one?"" Clearly, lady... clearly... So she went to get me a set. Then she noticed that we had edamame on our table... To be real, oftentimes sushi restaurants hookup a small portion for free so we were nibbling on them waiting for our dish... Well well well, when the waitres noticed our edamame, she took it away, mentioned that we didn't ""order"" any, and gave it to another table!!! GROSS!! Hamachi kama was the best thing, but that's usually always safe.

The sashimi was OK. Not the freshest but the best I've had in Vegas. Not saying much. Amaebi was supposed to be live, but they added way too much wasabi and it was not tasty. Lost the sweet flavor for real.  Dynamite was frozen scallops and mushroom and rice... Not up to par AT ALL.

Sure it's not the fanciest looking place.  On a busy, understaffed night things might take a little long (very rare) - but there is no better place. I've converted non-sushi eaters to sushi eaters.  A simple Ultimate Shrimp is a sure fire way to get them in the mix.  Then you can introduce the Monica Roll and expand.

Lamborghini (share this one)
Something Wrong Roll #7 (spicy kick)
Jay Roll (spicy no tempura)
Naked Salmon (no rice and delicious salmon dish)
Screaming Orgasm (tuna and radish treat)
Apple Roll (non-rice pallet cleanser)

Their spider roll is my second favorite.  They don't serve the typical puny crab at Sushi Fever as I usually receive a large soft shell crab in my Spider Roll which is always crunchy and awesome.

Ignore the other reviews about the Sushi Bar being too high when you sit at it.  Never had a problem with its height and the sushi chefs are always responsive to your needs.

Friend of mine introduced me to this place, a little hole in the wall restaurant not so extravagant but cozy, they had the most fresh Uni. (See urchin) not many peoples favorite but if you know the taste of fresh Uni, you know what fresh is. I've tried Uni from many other places found that all other places either had a smell or not cold enough. Sushi fever delivers that freshness. Therefore I've tried my others such as super white sashimi that literally melts in your mouth and tiger eye roll with thinly cut lemon, apple rolls and carrot top roll. And I don't really care for rolls but this really was very good. I advise ordering apple roll first before any other. Its very refreshing like having a salad before a meal. Its a little pricey but I will definitely go back again to try others they have on the menu and non the menu. You can ask the sushi chief to make you a special and he will whip you up a surprise.

The atmosphere is also great which would explain why it is always busy. I have brought several friends that don't like sushi.

Over the 10 years, my expectation's concerning sushi have grown higher, while Sushi Fever has stayed the same as it has always been...A-OK.

There are plenty of seats at the bar, as well as in the dinning area.  Over the years, they expanded their dining area to keep up with their popularity...and truth be told, at Sushi Fever, I prefer to sit in the main dining area right next to the Sushi bar.

The service has always been superb.  When you walk in, all the chefs and staff welcome you with a cheerful ""Irasshaimase!"" My water never goes empty and the staff is continually doing their part in making sure the dishes are tasty to your liking.  They are even willing to modify their regular menu to satisfy you.  So why does Sushi Fever get only 3 stars? Inconsistency.  Sometimes it's good, other times it is simply average.

I normally...let me correct myself...I always get the ""Chirachi Bowl,"" so I can enjoy a variety of fish in one order, with a bed of rice, no less.  On a recent visit, I ordered it, and it was delightful with added Yuzu sauce on some sashimi, and fresh fish to be found everywhere.  But on my  most recent visit, it went back to being only an average bowl.  This lack of consistencey leads  me to wonder, ""what is Sushi Fever's true identity?""  

If you like to order rolls with sweet and yummy sauce, or cooked dishes, this is definitely a good option for you...but if you want to enjoy, consistent, fresh, and high quality Japanese Sushi, there are other options in town you would do much better to experience.

The bad:
we walked and had not even sat down and the wait person asked if we wanted drinks.
I asked for water and said I would like to see the menu.
There were several menus with different meals and options but only one of each for a party of 4
I requested more menus and never  got them.
Asked for a house Merlot which was $4.50 on the menu. The manager came over and said we don't have that anymore and I asked what is the least expensive wine and she said $8 I was not happy about that.
Then she said that she would look and see if they have the house Merlot. She said she had the last bottle and proceeded to pour a very small glass - less than half full.
Others at the table ordered hot food. Chicken and salmon teriyaki very ordinary and the salad on the menu never came. . Chicken katsu was dry as a bone. Spicy pork dish very good but came out only when we wondered where it was and asked about it.
I ordered special #4 which I thought were 2 hand rolls for $12.  A nice hand roll came out and I asked where the other one was and they said no- just one. All at table agreed that they thought there were 2 hand rolls as described on the menu. 

I would suggest JJanga or Kona Grill instead. I really felt hustled both by the wine situation and the way the # 4 special was described. As well as the fact that the noise level was very loud and service very disjointed. It seems that they are successful and no longer feel they have to give value or service.

We can go crazy and have a big bill b/c there are a lot of fantastic specialty rolls, but it's always worth a trip over to get there sushi and you can get out of there full, happy, and with a small bill too.

I've had probably about half the rolls on the menu.  My favorites are the Something Sexy #1 (With ALL Salmon instead of Tuna...but I hear is great with tuna as well), Something Sexy # 2, Ultimate Shrimp, Screaming O, Japanese Burrito, Yum Yum (Scallop Cooked), Alaska Roll, Grand Canyon Roll...and they have the best plain old California Roll.  The Apple Roll is tasty if you're looking for something different, and I think this roll is alright, but a lot of my friends really like the Dale Earnhardt roll too.  Although I've eaten here a 100 or more times so I've ventured to even try half the menu...I definitely have my favorites and only try something new when I'm with a group or really in the mood for a different flavor.

This place is a great sushi place to take beginning sushi eaters, or even to take someone that LOVES sushi...everyone will leave wanting to come back.  The sashimi is excellent here too and always so fresh.  The salmon almost melts in your mouth.  My Dad is not a sushi eater and I convinced him to try a tiny bite of the salmon sashimi and he was impressed...even finished the whole piece!  

Sushi bar is a fun place to sit and eat.  The sushi chefs are SO fun and love interacting with the customers.  Buy a bottle of saki and give them a couple of shots and they will hook up your rolls too.  ;)  They serve edamame and oranges at the bar at no additional charge.  Sushi rolls come out beautifully and each roll's presentation is just amazing here.  They do such a wonderful job.

Great lunch specials and offer  too.  And also have half the restaurant for Teppanyaki.  You can order the Teppanyaki anywhere though, and if on the sushi side of the restaurant it comes on a nice hot iron plate which is awesome b/c it keeps your food warm!  Other favorites are the Beef Terryaki...reallllllly good (not a fan of the chicken terryaki...you're better getting the chicken Teppanyaki b/c they use better chicken in it) and the Shrimp Tempura (which I don't order as often b/c it's fried) is a really great treat on occasion.",X26028b-8PmvFyprCfOiWg,0,0,5,Oef8JNn8Iqu_waYxktbZYw

The Screaming O is a little fiesta in your mouf, but I'm not a huge fan of mayo and usually ask them to leave that out of the sauce (and any other sauce they put on my rolls).

This place was recommended to me by someone who does not use Yelp, therefore I was a little skeptical. We tasted a total of four rolls. The spider roll, which was the simplest of the four, came with soft shell crab and imitation crab and it was simply delicious. The  other two roles we tried had a number of ingredients and we're elaborate, like a large majority of the menu (which I appreciate). The Carrot Top roll was covered in thinly shredded fried carrots which tasted ridiculously amazing and snackable. That was by far my favorite, so good. Then the special number 2 had a little kick to it; it was nice but it was no where near The Carrot Top roll. For dessert we had The Monkey roll, a deep fried banana topped with imitation crab and etc. Such a different combination that worked so well; great way to end your meal as it serves as a dessert.

 We were seated within a short amount of time and our orders took about 10 minutes to come out, which was fantastic; and on top of that they worked in an open kitchen to make the sushi. Everything we had tasted fresh, like it had just been made. Although the decor in the condition of the place was not at all bad it was nothing to write home about.

The large interior is filled with teppanyaki tables, a large U-shaped sushi bar, and a dining room. The quality of the food is average with rolls like the Hawaiian ($10.50) constructed with minimal rice and decent flavors from the tuna. The Don't Tell Mama ($16) was more visually impressive, but flavors were dominated by the overall spiciness of the chili sauce. For dessert, the deep fried cheesecake was disappointing. The center still frozen and the tempura batter covering the slice was uneven with some areas too thick and chewy.

Its made with tuna but i ask for half salmon as well. And the ""screaming orgasm"" sauce is the best for dipping other rolls as well even if your not enjoying the ""screaming orgasm""

No all you can eat which I think helps with the food quality staying so consistent.

(My favorite place to sit) I was greeted immediately, given my plate with ginger and wasabi, some edamame, and a cucumber salad. All free!!! That was such a great surprise! I ordered the sashimi 10 piece platter. The fish was all fresh and delicious. (Salmon is my favorite and it was like butter, yummy) Then I ordered a ""Oops"" roll. It had salmon, tuna, crab salad, shrimp, deep fried jalapeños, and spicy mayo. (I believe that was all that was in it) It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! Full of flavor, and no rice! What a great option. 
The menu was spectacular! They really organized it into great categories that really made it easy to order. Usually at sushi restaurants, it take me FOREVER to decide because I have to read all of them and sift through all of them. At Sushi Fever, they organize it by tempura, rolls without rice, etc.

4116241,2012-09-01,2,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"I recently moved to Summerlin from Chino Hills in Southern California. There were quite a few good sushi restaurants back home, and I was looking forward to trying and finding some good ones out here in Las Vegas. So, after a quick scan on yelp, we decided to check out Sushi Fever.

Now, I haven't tried any sushi from anywhere else here in Las Vegas yet, but compared to places I've been previously, this was easily one of the worst. We went on a Saturday afternoon, around 1 o'clock, and the place was moderately busy. Our service was a little on the slow side, but not the worst I've experienced. Our food, however, was a very big disappointment, especially for the price. The rolls average around $14, and based on the quality and quantity they give, I'd put their value closer to $7-$8. We ordered 2 Miso Soups, 1 order of steamed Gyoza, 1 order of yellowtail nigiri, 1 kamikaze hand-roll, 1 yum yum hand-roll, 1 Mistake specialty roll, 1 Volcano specialty roll, and just water to drink. The bill was $54. I'd probably rate this place a 2 - 2.5 star establishment if the bill was closer to $30.

As for our food, the miso soup was extremely bland, with an over powering taste of onion. I'm not sure how they managed to screw up miso soup, but they did. There was a lot of tofu though, so that may or may not be a bonus for some people. The gyoza was a limp sack of spinach, with a mediocre sauce on the side. We ate half of them before deciding we'd rather be hungry than continue eating those. The yellowtail nigiri was alright, nothing special, nothing terrible. The kamikaze hand-roll was definitely on the lower end of hand-rolls I've had, and all of the cream cheese was on the bottom for some reason, so the last bite was exceptionally bad. The yum yum hand-roll also managed to have an overpowering oniony taste somehow, despite me not actually seeing any onions. The mistake specialty roll was on par with a Vons brand spicy tuna roll, except this one looking like it was rolled by someone with tremors. Finally, the volcano specialty roll. This was easily the best thing we ordered off the menu, but it came out 10 minutes after the rest of our food, cost $12, and we only got 4 medium sized pieces of sushi. Plus, it was a baked roll, despite not mentioning that on the menu, which sadly my fiancee doesn't like.

I don't know if this place just has off days or what, but we definitely won't be coming back. I've generally been pretty pleased with the restaurant scene out here, and I was pretty surprised at how bad the food was for the price. I hope the other nearby sushi bars can do better.",fEHukYSzjf43Q49uketgSA,0,0,1,Q8QSqJhNydkdNWW7IPa7xA

You get to choose from two proteins, I chose fish tempura and yakitori and it also comes with miso soup, a spring roll, a California roll, gyoza, rice and salad. Wow, was I super impressed.

Sushi Fever what a great name, so great I made a list of Sushi joints in Vegas you should try out. I actually insist you take a look at that list because I've had so much better and so can YOU.

Teppan: 3/5 I love Teppan its just something as a family or a group of friends have to try. Basically Teppan is a style of Japanese cooking where the chef cooks in front of you and does cool tricks as you enjoy your dinner. Dinner and a show what a great combo. I love Teppan but the food is only good as its entertainer. When I went I had a horrible chef that wasn't interactive at all. He wasn't even social, maybe there was a language barrier I don't know but honestly what ever this chef was doing I could've done same thing. All he did was stand there and cook. 

Nigiri: 3/5 I was happy to find a place that actually had fresh fish but the portions were off. I find this a lot in Las Vegas. The ratio of Rice to Fish is so off. This place isn't even AYCE (all you can eat) so they shouldn't have a reason to cheat people off on their nigiri's 

Sashimi: 3/5 I was happy to see shashimi on the menu, you don't see to many of that around Las Vegas. Like I said the Fish here was fresh but the slices are super thin.

Price: 3/5 This place can be a bit pricy, there's no AYCE and the teppan for JUST the combination's it was about $20-40 (enough for 1-2 people). So you'll end up ordering multiple combinations and sides. The bill adds up.",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,3,2,3,WLzpaZ92ZsZPqP1NoCPB-A

They will give you nice cuts of fresh fish. Tuna, Salmon, YellowTail, Squid, Mackerel, and one more I forgot about.

4484303,2010-03-27,0,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"A few weeks ago I went to the popular Sushi Fever on Buffalo and Sahara, where I have dined many times before. We had to wait ten minutes for a table, which may be a sign that the economy is coming back, or a sign they need more tables. One thing I love about Vegas is that you rarely need to make reservations, however, Sushi Fever has been around for awhile and has a large following. Though not the absolute best sushi place I have been (that Frugal Foodie award would go to the ridiculously un-frugal Sushi Sasabune in Los Angeles), the rolls are fresh, creative, and well-executed. Most are in the $12-$15 range but there are some relative bargains such as the Washington Roll for $9.50. This roll is stuffed with salmon, avocado, cucumber and one of my personal favorite fillings, yamagobo, which is a pickled Japanese root vegetable similar to a carrot in the shape of a stringbean. It adds great texture to the roll as it has a hearty crunch. The Washington Roll is topped with a very thin layer of salmon, which normally I would say is a cheap way for a restaurant to advertise more fish, but in this case worked very well since there were also big chunks of salmon inside. I think the roll might have been too big and salmon-y had the slice been thicker. 

We also ordered two of my personal favorites, the 90% Roll and the Rock and Roll. Both of these are quite the mouthful but incredibly tasty, not least because they both come with an out-of this world tangy dipping sauce. The ingredients I can identify in the sauce are rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, scallions, tiny fish roe, and kewpie mayonaise, a Japanese mayonaise that in my opinion is much better than American mayonaises (see the ingredient shopping page). My dad had the brilliant idea of using a spoon to ladel the sauce on top because otherwise it is very easy to lose your roll to the bottom of the bowl while dipping. The 90% Roll has fried sof-shell crap in the interior, is wrapped with ahi tuna, and then is topped with chopped and baked scallops. It's not the healthiest but a must try. The Rock and Roll is much lighter but equally delicious. It has hamachi, salmon, tuna, and crab and is wrapped skillfully in cucumber. We also had to order the hamachi sashimi, because although rolls are fun to eat, they are definitely not authentic. A great piece of butttery fish with a little soy sauce and wasabi is beautiful in its simplicity and truly lets you enjoy the flavor of the fish. 

The meal was highly enjoyable, but the service and ambiance ceratinly left something to be desired. Once we were able to locate our waiter the rolls came out quickly, but I don't think I'll be going to Sushi Fever on a Friday night anytime soon. For good reason is it a popular spot, and as long as you go at the right time, it should prove to be a fullfilling experience!",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,3,1,4,Yqd-CymAv_CjQgBfp1Vm8A

Went for lunch with my daughter. It was super busy and felt cramped, but the service was great.
My daughter ordered the lunch time special with chicken teriyaki. Super generous portions with California rolls, a salad, potstickers, an egg roll, and miso soup. I was jealous....and a little disappointed that there wasn't a real sushi option for the lunch special. I wound up getting a screaming O salad and a miso soup. The screaming O was, well, amazing (that's what she said). My kiddo and i were both put off by the soup. It had an odd dish soap taste and the tofu texture was weird.
Overall, kind of pricey for a ten year old and mom lunch. I do wish there were more sushi lunch options. I'm talking a mean game about not being impressed, when odds are I will be heading back for more screaming O before the week is over.",qTI_7p2Ms7yXhcngbAdzpQ,1,0,4,5C3RlaeMCzYdTZrr5EdNsw

An empty sake cup is the ULTIMATE sushi dining foul! Grr!

This place has been given rave reviews from all of my friends, so I had to try it for myself.

It's VERY American meaning large portions and  lots of American ingredients. 

They did have this incredible roll called the Something Wrong #35. Oh, there was something oh-so right about this something wrong. The tempura yams and carrots we very unique, and this was my hands down favorite. 

I fell in love with ""japanese lasagna"" at Osaka, but Sushi Fever's version didn't give the dish its due.  The cool thing about this restaurant is the clever naming of the rolls (really?! Dale Earnheart --whoever that is with THAT spelling) has his own roll? Oh, and I think I'll try this one ""Just for the Halibut."" 

Punny. Corny. Still Fun.

But I digress...

This place was jumping for an early Sunday evening. The people didn't stop waltzing through the doors in their khaki shorts, t-shirts, and hiking shoes (c'mon people! Dress up for a change!). The fact that each customer was greeted with some foreign Japanese phrase (it probably means a$$hole for all I know because I stopped speaking Japanese in elementary school) was a unique  personal touch.

Next time I'll sit at the bar. At least I'll be entertained by the sushi chef while I wait for my sake cup to be refilled.

Give it a shot!

Don't get me wrong.... I isn't bad sushi, for being in the middle of a desert. But like Vegas itself, it is a lot of hype and just average experience. The place was packed, so I know the food must be above average, but if this place was in California, it wouldn't last. The restaurant is great out in Nevada because Nevada sucks and the people here don't really know what ""good food at a good price is."" The sushi wasn't all that fresh and most of the rolls showed the paper on the outside! Really.... name a good sushi place that shows the paper on the outside of its rolls? To compensate for the lack of fresh fish, each roll was doused in sauces and BS... Not for me I guess, but good for the Desert Dwellers out her that don't know any better....
The free soy beans, hot towel and cucumber were nice to start the meal, but the rolls were waaaaaaay over priced. Even for a place 7 miles west of the Strip. The  Carrot Top roll was pretty good, but nothing I'd brag about to anyone... The Sexy Girl #2 was god awful.... bad roll covered in fried onion, garlic and mushrooms. Just terrible....

-Apple Roll: fresh fish wrapped in Apple and served with spicy ponzu sauce... Wow I had never seen that done anywhere else so I thought that was pretty cool! It's tart green apple so the flavors went well with each other and it's rice less... Loved it!
-Salmon lover: salmon wrapped in cucumber also rice less! YUM
-Screaming O: tuna with lots of spicy mayo, ponzu and daikon.. If you love super saucy things then get this.. Another rice less dish
-Carrot Top: shrimp tempura roll, with sauce and lots of fried shredded yams on top.. Presentation was nice and it tasted good too!
-Spider roll: wrapped in soy paper.. Crisp soft shell crap
-Bento Box: with teriyaki chicken and salmon = $18.95... No no no! It came with saddest looking ""salad,"" the smallest pieces of chicken and salmon, store bought egg roll & potstickers, watery miso soup and a big bowl of rice.. This was a complete waste of money!

Service was friendly and fast.. Everyone was Korean so I'm assuming it's Korean owned? The bill came out to be what we would have paid at AYCE,.. I'm more of a nigiri person but I will say the rolls here are pretty good!

Lesson learned after eating there today?  Great poker players do not equate to foodies.

Nice staff, nice sushi chefs, but the food isn't great besides their fish tempura which was awesome-o.

With the surprisingly large number of good Japanese restaurants in the area you can definitely find better places than the Fever.  I will say, though, that most Japanese places in town have a large Asian clientele where this one is mostly Caucasian.  It's possible my many Caucasian friends will like this place better.  I could be used to different flavors, etc.

But they charged me like $7 for a unagi nagiri order.  2 pieces of mediocre unagi.  Really...it was dry.  Their rice is great but come on.  Unagi is supposed to be moist.

Should have known when their bento box comes with a California roll.  Yikes.  Their tonkatsu was dry and flavorless.  Again, maybe it's for Caucasian tastes as many of my friends distrust fattier parts of the pork.  But fat=flavor my friends.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,0,0,2,xbi2GKM2H1aE60_fMRBQTA

-The prices are comparable to everywhere else. 

-They have some of the best rolls I've had in town. They have a good mix of rolls, but there is something about the sauces they use. We've had similar rolls at other places in town, and they just don't seem to compare. 

The best thing about this place is the ""Grand Canyon"" roll. Which is easily my favorite. It's a Cali roll topped with large pieces of shrimp, scallops, onions, mushrooms, chives and a delicious creamy sauce. Honestly, I could eat the topping without the roll itself.   

I also recommend -

The attraction here is not AYCE; it is not an option. They don't have happy hour specials either. People come here for creative rolls made with ingredients other than spicy tuna, crab and fried shrimp. For example, several rolls include scallops. The rolls here average $12. You do receive complimentary edamame and cucumber salad, but don't expect any refills on those little treats! My husband was pleading with me to sweet talk us into some more edamame, but before I could even get up the courage, the waitress came and whisked away our bowl. No more edamame for us!

The atmosphere might not be phenomenal, but I actually think the sushi bar is quite comfortable. Plus, the sushi chefs are particularly friendly and helpful. I could tell that our chef was concerned about our culinary experience. He was eager to find out what we liked so that he could make suggestions. Little did he know that when it comes to sushi, we're rather simplistic and not interested in the fancy stuff. Although, I did order a roll made with cucumber wraps in place of rice-- interesting, pretty tasty. Our other rolls appeared a little sloppy, but overall were fresh and flavorful.

Side note: I will forever be perplexed why restaurants use fake crab, especially when they are charging $12-$15/roll. Is that their way of telling you that you should not order crab?

My conclusion: If you are someone who really enjoys creative sushi rolls and doesn't mind paying a premium over AYCE, then you might appreciate Sushi Fever. However, if you think creativity is overrated, and you just want to stuff your hole with rolls, you should probably take a pass.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,11,3,QGVrS-tyWqw6wEz2E_tiVg

I went here a few weeks back, and was impressed by the quality of the sushi.  Places like this can go either way in terms of food content, and I wanted to try a new place as I've been getting more rice than fish in my rolls.  

Not here.  We tried a few of the specialty rolls and a sashimi platter.  The rolls were tasty, but the platter really stood out.  They pack their rolls with fish, and everything tasted really fresh, so you definitely get what you pay for.  The prices themselves aren't that bad, either, so you can get filled up pretty quickly for a reasonable price.  Big points for their sake.  It helped to make the already pleasant rolls that much more, well, pleasant.

The service was no slouch, either.  Attentive to the point of covering whatever was needed, by not constantly in your face or disruptive when you had a mouth full of food.  Everything was very laid back and casual, and the servers were helpful for new choices.  Bear in mind this was during a lunch, so I can't speak for any potential dinner rush.

5582932,2018-06-17,0,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"Sorry for the length but this review really hurts. My colleagues and I have been going to Sushi Fever for many years (since 2003) whenever we are in Vegas for business. We have always found both the food and service to be exceptional and the prices extremely reasonable. In addition we always recognized most of the chefs and servers and felt very comfortable and welcomed. 
    Earlier this month we (4 of us) visited on a Tuesday (6/5) around 9:30PM to find an almost empty room. At the time we felt lucky about the crowd and looked forward to our usual exceptional meal and service. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow and unfriendly plus the rice seemed to be falling apart upon removing any Nigiri from the plates. During dinner we received a call from friends wanting to meet us there. After being told last call was at 10:45, our server began pressuring us to order for them at 10:30. In the end we all felt the food was okay (not great) and the service was nowhere near our previous 30+ trips.
   On Thursday (6/7) several of our trade show colleagues wanted to go eat at Fever and asked us to come along. With 10 in-tow on a Thursday night we were hopeful for a redemption meal. Well...that did NOT happen. Service was EXTREMELY slow and considering the fact we had several novices to the menu, the server was of no help and couldn't answer basic questions about the rolls. I ordered for all and the food was a disappointment compared to previous visits.

5622613,2011-06-29,1,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"Sushi Fever certainly makes a strong, strong case for the ""Most Interesting Meal of My Life"".

I suppose that I should have entered my dinner with this expectation in mind, as I was already coming fresh off of the sensory stimulation-packed slambanggasms of the 2011 Electric Daisy Carnival. With this being said, my dining companions and I were looking forward to a relaxing, refreshing meal - the ideal contrast to three days' worth of dancing between the hours of 8 PM and 6 AM. 

In a way, Sushi Fever certainly did accomplish just that. The sheer variety of the restaurant's offerings is simply staggering, as the five separate types of menus awaiting our party of six were accompanied by lists of the day's specials that were craftily placed under the glass surface of our table. Although it did take some time to decide between dozens of sushi varieties (and a nifty selection of entree items such as teriyaki, as well), I decided on a Crunch Roll (a reliable classic that has yet to disappoint me at any sushi bar) and a Honey Roll (I think that was what it was called, I know that it was the first item on one of the special rolls menus and that the roll was listed as being drizzled with eel sauce). 

My fellow diners and I also ordered two orders of gyoza - one steamed and one fried. Each order consisted of six potstickers, so all six of us exhausted rave-slaves were able to sample the dual dishes' tender/crispy textures and refreshing meat/broth filling. The dishes also came with a nice bowl of edamame - just what my tired bones and seratonin-depleted brain were looking for! Healthy and refreshing.

NOTE: THIS ENDS THE PORTION OF THE REVIEW WHERE THE DINING EXPERIENCE CAN BE CONSIDERED ""NORMAL"". Thank you.

Upon finishing our appetizers, my friends and I expected to receive our entrees within roughly 5-10 minutes. Strangely enough, Sushi Fever seemed grounded in the practice of bringing our entrees out one by one. Poor Nick got his chicken teriyaki almost twenty minutes before any other entrees were served, and it must've been strange for him to nibble on the twin chicken breasts bit-by-bit as the rest of us suppressed our appetites. I sampled a bit of the miso salad that his teriyaki came with (the dish also comes with miso soup), and the salad was relatively tasty, but not anything to write home about. 

Ryan was the next at our table to receive his dinner, and he too attempted to slow down his eating while waiting for the rest of our entrees to be served. The gap between the arrival of his entree and the arrival of the next two dishes was about ten minutes, and I did note that the restaurant appeared to be picking up in pace rapidly, as dinner customers were arriving in larger parties. Still, shouldn't establishments be prepared for stuff like this?

Nevertheless, my food finally arrived. The Crunch Roll had a somewhat strange presentation; it almost seemed as though the roll had been organized in a sort of jumbled fashion on the plate, and the sushi was positioned in a shallow plate of sweet sauce (not quite teriyaki sweet, but still sweet nonetheless). 

Now inevitably, you're probably wondering how Sushi Fever earned three stars (or any stars at all), and this rating is due almost entirely to the INSANE FLAVOR OF THE SOOSH! For all of the restaurant's shortcomings, I cannot deny that my sixteen dollars certainly went far in the way of the food itself; funky presentation and Snorlax-esque service couldn't upset the fact that the Crunch Roll had an unforgettable contrast of texture and that the Honey Roll offered a mellow, rich, refreshing flavor that jolted the tastebuds in the same way that the Swedish House Mafia's drops jolted my eyes into the back of my head at around 1 AM on Sunday morning. Pure bliss. The portion size on the Honey Roll did leave a bit to be desired, however.

Our meal took a turn for Beyond Wonderland, however, once my friend Scott received his ""Chef's Special"". I'm not entirely sure as to what the roll's contents were, but the dish resembled a regular sushi roll with a transplanted hat of crabmeat glued to the top. Looks weren't deceiving on this day, as Scott took a bite of his sushi and promptly proceeded to gag, again and again (HAHAHA). He washed the piece of sushi down with some lemonade, and my friends and I decided to have a Man Vs. Food moment of our own by sampling the choke-inducing dish.

Oh my.

Strange stuff; I suppose that being Filipino really saved me today, as my companions each began to put on the most grotesque faces upon sampling the Chef's Special. My tongue, specifically, was greeted by relatively normal sushi flavors and an undesirable gut-punch of bitterness (not the sharp heat of wasabi, nor the unmistakable flavor of ginger, mind you, but some awful bitterness). Never again. 

In any case, Sushi Fever was a hit-or-miss experience. Kinda like Russian Roulette. You just gotta know what to order.",Hv3vaKQGK71sLei7hQs9og,1,0,3,e3E9FlRPrwMvwAZy2FhS5A
5653764,2016-02-27,1,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"Sushi Fever is my favorite sushi place. It is located right off West Sahara in between Buffalo Dr. and Cimarron Rd. I have been dining here for about ten years. I know that the sushi is consistent in taste and I enjoy the casual atmosphere. We always sit at the sushi bar, where it is easy to strike about a conversation with strangers. I always like to see what others order and hear their opinions which spurs me on to try something new. When we are in larger parties, we will sit at a table but not the same. We enjoy interacting with the sushi chefs and we often will treat them to a beer or sake (Kumpai!) Often, they will give us a new roll to try so it makes it worth it to be friendly.  The dinner begins with a cup of edamame, followed by the traditional cucumber and crab salad. The sushi chef provides you with your tray of pickled ginger and wasabi. We always start with the traditional rainbow roll which gives you a taste of salmon, ahi tuna, shrimp, yellowtail. I am a strong believer in avocado in my rolls as well. Just love the creaminess it provides in the rolls. Next we move on to the extraordinary Apple Roll served with a side of Ponzu sauce. The unbelievable thing about this roll is how much the apple that is wrapped around this roll sets off the taste of this fish. I could eat these all day long....seriously! We finished off with Rock and Roll which consists of tuna, crab, whitefish wrapped in  cucumber. This roll is served with a side of ponzu sauce mixed with a little creamy mayo. The fish always taste fresh and  I love the fact that whenever I eat sushi, I walk away satisfied instead of full. We close the meal out with oranges which is a nice topper instead of a heavy dessert offering. The service is spot on and friendly. 

I enjoy trying other sushi restaurants but Sushi Fever is hands down the place I eat sushi at most often. If you are in the neighborhood, be sure to give them a try",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,3,2,4,zBY9e3uRInDXlm-HCzHzsg

Ahun gave me some amazingly fresh salmon, tuna, bluefin tuna, and then he even told me to try toe japanese mackeral which was great! He could tell that I was a sushi lover and offered me fresh/real wasabi which was amazing too.  I also had a few hand rolls and a very tasty mango salmon roll (no rice) that Ahun told me he created on the menu.

I come to Vegas every week and have not yet found any great sushi places, even in the expensive resorts the sushi is just blah.  Overall this not fancy, off the strip local sushi place is one of the best on Vegas, for whatever that is worth.

5814531,2012-07-18,1,GkRF8rSvh9cOQuuPeDh9bg,"Growing up in Hawaii We never had a lack of fresh fish. Now that I live in Cincinnati, I wish i would of eaten what was more readily available as a kid. Once my folks moved to Vegas, they knew what i was saying all these years. Once you leave the ocean, you leave delicious fresh fish. The more land locked you are, the more it all taste like LJS, yuck :(

So while visiting my folks, mom wanted to go out for some Sashimi Ahi. Almost laughing on the inside we searched yelp to find something worth trying, and Thank the heavens above we decided on this place.

Its located in a business park almost, but as we drove by, Sushi fever was jam packed with cars parked in front of it, good sign number one.

As we entered the place was busy and hopping, but we got to sit at the Sushi bar, the best place to sit in my opinion and was given a bowl of edamame from out Sushi Chef, excellent sign number 2.

As Dad and I went on the hunt for what rolls we wanted, Mom just blurted out 3 Sashimi Ahi to get the party started. WOW this was some of the best fish i have had since leaving Hawaii. The Ahi was perfect in color, the flavor was super fantastic, and the texture was spot on. No gritty over frozen or pale flesh to look it.

This was always our favorite place but today...ugh.. it was packed as usual tonight and my bf and I sat at the sushi bar. We ordered the Monica roll and kalbi. They brought us our Kalbi and told us they take out of rice, so we ended up waiting 20mins for them to cook it. Finally, they brought it to the table and halfway through, I saw a long piece of hair. I immediately stopped eating and asked for he check. I let the waitress know and when she looked, she asked me if it was my hair- seriously?? That piece of hair was cooked into the kalbi, IT WASN'T MINE....she seemed annoyed and then asked if I wanted it off the bill, mind you we still had half of the kalbi untouched. They ended up taking it off however they were noticeably irritated. 

Sad to say, I won't be going back. Looks like I'll switch to naked fish. It's a shame because most of the staff is friendly but tonight was awful. Sushi fever, please make your staff wear hairnets!",9nFf9SoGBA_fsxYzF71JhQ,2,2,2,mbSZX9DkCJ_fXrVv3x7UAA
