Now on to the bitching.  

Do not eat here.  I am a fool.  No matter how appetizing bar food may seem at the moment, you don't want theirs.  I ate over 2 hours ago, and my stomach ache has yet to find an upper limit.  It just keeps getting worse.

Ugh.  Did you see that?  Before I could even finish this review, I just ran off to the bathroom and violently vomited.  I'm in hell right now.  I don't think it's food poisoning.  My boyfriend and I shared our turkey club sandwich and onion rings, and he's okay.  They probably just never clean out their fryer, or something

I mean, the food tasted alright (the first time around, not the second!), but I will never go back now.  Not even for a drink.

Oh, and the bartender was surly as hell.  Yes, dear we aren't regulars.  And with that attitude, you have assured that we never will be.

Went in here while staying near by on a work trip. Definitely a local dive bar. A couple pool tables and a big TV in the corner.

(They also have video poker with running jackpots)

The giant draft beers are $5. Which is a pretty good deal. Food was really good I got the Bobby Steak which is a classic cheese steak with jalapenos. And the mozzarella sticks which caught my eye because they were almost $9 but when they bring them out you see why. Definitely for sharing.

5326531,2013-10-09,1,fzpnaYOqBDjKnnAgFcgR8A,"My perspective is from die-hard N.Y. Giants fan and all around bar fan. This bar is only one of two bars in town that cater to 'NY Giants' fans. As you read this review, keep in mind that this was an early game but this is football season in Vegas and I have been to bars for early games and they were as busy as if it were Monday Night Football.

CONS:
This place is not advertized to the general public as a NYGiants themed bar in the Las Vegas area. I found out about this place through a buddy of mine. The reason they can't advertise as being a Giants bar is because one of the criteria required by the Las Vegas Review Journal is that you cater only to the team support and not show any other game while your team is playing. But, they do, they have every game on TV and they display the Giants game on the big screen with sound. This in and of itslef is not that big of a deal because there is a decent amount of Giants fans in the place, but there are also plenty of fans of other teams too and that kind of takes away from the whole concept.

They raffle prizes at half-time but they are freebies they get from vendors and none Giants related. 

The bartender wears a Philidelphia Eagles jersey every week. 

Smoking is allowed and ventilation is definitely lacking.


PROS:
Because its definitely a locals place, the price is right. The service is always excellent. The staff is welcoming. The customers are friendly and the place is set up pretty nicely. The menu is pretty good. When I go to an early game I have the stake and eggs with hashbrowns and choice of toast for $9. It's absolutely excellent!, Well cooked and delicious. The beer always cold and on point. I'd already had breakfast so I just had the potato chip fries. These chips are very good. 

CONCLUSION:
As a bar it gets four stars but I only go during football season to watch the Giants when their not already on TV so that's all I have to go by. I gave the place three stars instead of two as a 'Giants' bar because it is as close to a Giants bar as any other bar gets in this town and beggers can't be choosers. I'd give it four stars if they were a strickly Giants bar, and five if the bartender didn't wear an Eagles jersey. If you're a football fan you understand.",3MwccEgTNoXgc-en9e7Qzw,2,1,3,6DV8t0sKrJ8U06YwkSQX5Q

I'm extremely glad that my friend invited me and a few of other friends to come and visit this gem!

The decor is ""old-wester-Vegas"" as this pub has been around for quite a few years living through the ups and downs of Vegas and the growth of its West side, where this pub is located.

The food was EXTREMELY affordable--we're talking $4.00 for a full platter! It is more of a diner fare with a few upgrades. The service is extremely quick, the drink selection is vast and also affordable. Bartender was very good and waitress made us feel at home. I loved their BLT sandwish on sour dough bread, and their take on ""quasadillas"" stuffed with a plethora of meats and vegetables. Their yummy fries come in different flavors and seasonings, my favorite being ""cajun.""

This was a very good experience from start to finish. I could understand that even on a week night it was packed. Highly recommend this place!
