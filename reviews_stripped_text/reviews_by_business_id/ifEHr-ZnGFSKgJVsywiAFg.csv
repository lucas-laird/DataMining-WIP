Especially liked that you could order flights of Italian, American or other wines, and/or specify the size of your glass of wine.  The markup on the wines is quite high, but what a fun wine list to read.  The dining room off to the main room is comfortable and romantic.  The service was friendly and professional. Our food was creative modern Italian - especially liked the swordfish rollatini and gnocci.  My only criticism might be that the portions are kind of skimpy for the prices charged, and that wasn't for the ""small plates"".  The basket of breads and spoons of olive oil made the portion size tolerable.  We'll gladly go back again, but consider it a splurge.",3bsZTcrWWbeou4aj0dOAtA,0,0,4,TmYZGTYXmz29MnpJBTsGrQ

My favorite spot was up at the food bar, and not at the tables.  The guy that put the cheese and meat plates together for those at the bar was very well-informed and matched the cheeses and meats to what we were drinking...one of the great sides was a marmalade with mustard seeds in it that we would dip sharp cheese into - that was one of the best flavors to hit my palate.
When sitting at the tables, watch what you're ordering - listen to the server when they tell you ""family"" style....that means DON'T ORDER SO MANY SIDES...you'll look at each other and wonder...""why didn't we listen to the server""...
If you have room after the wining and dining for dessert you will be impressed...but so often I never made it that far...call me full and buzzed!",alctQACS3gqdYLN6GxZr1g,0,0,5,G3vIbD9rHIYWT62r5SyMgQ

Great place for a solid wine list, but the thing we eat here is the pizza. The one we get is not a sauce based pizza, and Norah's does it quite well. Other places offer it as well, but Nora's wine bar does it the best and most consistent.

We have had some of the pasta, and while it is good, we kept going back for the pizza.

Anyway, my husband and I came early and sat at the bar while we waited for our party.  The bartender was very friendly and quite helpful, and we were seated right away as soon as the other folks arrived (the place was practically empty on a Saturday night at 6:30pm.)

The restaurant was quite nice and inviting - not the hoity toity intimidating atmosphere you get from some wine bars - and conveniently located in Summerlin (Boca Park.)

Other Highlights
-Appetizers we had were fabulous:
-Arancini (risotto and mozzerella balls) 
-Bacon-wrapped dates with parmesan
-They do have an extensive and seemingly unending selection of wines by the bottle though.

Cons
-Slow service
-We were disappointed that for a wine bar there was not much of a wine-by-the-glass selection at the bar.
-Food was good but not excellent (at least not the entrees we ordered)
-Wines and food seem overpriced.

I've struggled with what to rate Nora's since it is a nice restaurant with great wine, but although we enjoyed our experience I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.  I'm going for a 3.5.",P0-WcQ3TyUMPRuX6h4bisg,0,0,3,5io0qVtsmbtqQgo9b5ebGw

We've eaten there twice, and both the food and service seemed to take a severe downturn the second time. The first time, we were given a nice plate of olive oils and salts to sample and enjoy with our bread. This time, a girl simply came around with some bottles of oil and allowed us to choose only one. Sad. The new wine system seemed neat, but I'm a lazy ass who doesn't want to have to get up in the middle of my meal and pour myself more wine, so I didn't use it. The clincher, however, is that both times we've gone there we've had to order our second (or in my husband's case, third) choice of entrees, as they were completely out of our first choices.

449124,2011-01-21,0,ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg,"A couple friends and I decided to try this place out because 1) they are wine drinkers and 2) wanted a chill atmosphere. So being the person I am and always wanting to try new places around town, I figured I would give it a try.

Located in the Boca Park area by William Sonoma, Banana Republic and P.F. Changs, you know you're in Summerlin and the dining is going to be a little more high class. On the night we went, there were only a couple tables occupied. As soon as I walked in, a whiff of snootty-ness was in the air. Now I can get along with anyone or anything but the caliber of people in this place was unbelievable. I actually felt a little out of place because I'm one of those people that enjoys having a good time when I go out to eat, instead I felt like I had to behave myself.

Our waiter, Diego, poor dude. It's like he didn't even want to be there and the guy was so monotone, as my friend stated, an ""Italian Frankenstein."" He started to get irritated because we were still waiting for the rest of our party to show up and were not ready to order. But yet he kept asking!

So looking over the menu...first who uses a suede type menu? Oh Nora's does. I know you're trying to go for the sophisticated look but the EVOO stains on the menu are not very appealing. Side note- nothing on the menu was cheaper than $10. The best way to classify Nora's is Italian tapas ranging from apps to small bites to entrees to desserts. We found it much more beneficial to share the dishes we ordered and ended up paying around $60 for the 3 of us, of course we never did sample the wine. Perhaps it was because we didn't want to get to rowdy in this place (we did anyways and we just got stink eye from those around us).

We ordered the rollo di pollo, (chicken parmsigana stuffed with ham( from the small bites menu. There were 4 pieces, which suited us fine. It was actually pretty enjoyable, I was afraid it might have still been raw like other places but it was actually cooked right! Our next dish was the tomato & basil capellini. It's really hard to mess this simple dish up. So it was okay nothing to make you say ""WOW."" And last but not least we ordered the small spinach & endive salad. I enjoyed this salad because it was light and quite refreshing.  The three dishes we ordered actually worked out well together and naturally balanced each other out. 

Overall Nora's wasn't bad, however, the service and atmosphere made me give it 3 stars. I'd give it another shot to see if it was just a bad night and to possibly sample the wine. It does remind me of the Grape in Town Square, but the Grape has more of a laid back atmosphere and has ladies night, with a reasonable food & drink menu!",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0,0,3,BHCz-APSAuExh4JjBDKkdQ

To start with it took a while to be seated and there were only two other couples there...it was a very calm Sunday evening and at least two waiters looked over at us standing there at the door.

The waiter got a new glass, but didn't bother to apologize...I realize it could have been someone else who prepared the drink, so I didn't let it ruin our dinner. 

The rest of the dinner was okay...our waiter had a horrible attitude and it took a while to get refills on water and drinks.  I won't be back here any time soon!

I enjoyed having the restaurant to ourselves as it gave us a chance to talk at a normal level without having to yell. My vocal cords were already hoarse from the 3 days of non-stop drinking and partying so this was a welcome respite. 

Having eaten like a king for the past couple of days, I needed something manageable to digest so I opted for a chicken breast salad. My friend got the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich. Both entrees were on point especially my friend's entree. It was like something you would have your mom make when you were sick. 

The best part of the whole meal was the bread with dipping oils that preceeded the entrees. I am a salt snob so I was happy to see three different kinds of salt as well.

706355,2010-04-30,0,ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg,"I get why people love this place. It's far superior to many other places in the city, however I personally didn't love it. 

A huge plus about Nora's is that it is one of the few places that I have been to that offers organic meats on their menu. This alone earned the third star. 

The reason why they don't get anything more than 3 stars is because absolutely everything is salted to death. I love salt, but this was just too much. I left feeling almost mummified. It started with the bread that is brought to the table. They use 3 different salts as a dip for your bread and olive oil. People, salt is not a dip! My appetizer, the organic duck egg, came with with a ladle spoon of truffled salt, and even my dessert (the pannacotta) came with a salted caramel flavor. Total overkill. 

I would give Nora's another go, they do have a fantastic wine list and their small plates look decent. Next time though I will treat this as a place for a drink and nibble rather than a sit down dinner. The ambiance is good, provided that you sit in main area. There is a side room that is cut off from the rest, and is devoid of any vibe what so ever, so avoid if possible. 

Service, 2 stars only. Rushed, and forgetful.",wTVl4owjHa278i-fxmYcCw,2,0,3,rXRp4SWhfDZs3TqQ1R0AAw

There were 3 of us and for a Monday night the dining room was almost full but luckily without reservations we only had to wait a couple minutes. 

Loved the option of 3 or 6 oz pours and wine fleets as well (all very fairly priced). It was a great way of tasting a few wines more than we typically would have. 

For food, we started with the choice of 3 option for bruschette. We tried the chicken liver puree, eggplant with pine nuts and sardines. All were delicious with the eggplant being the standout. Also ordered the arancini - nice and light while tasty and grilled veg plate as appetizers. Pasta course we ordered the papardelle and wild boar with farro. Both were amazing and very nice size portions. We also had the pork siciliana which was cooked a perfect medium and balanced nicely with the arugula and a nice way to finish the meal. The 3 of us were beyond stuffed by then and sadly skipped out on cheese but opted to share a panna cotta and ricotta donuts with some expresso. Both were good, although the donuts were a little bitter tasting even with the honey. They use Lavazza expresso however which was delicious. 

Service was great! Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable as was his back waiter/busboy(?) who kept a good eye on our water glasses and bread basket and answered any questions we had.
All the food came out at a great pace and we definately didn't feel rushed even when we sat around for another 30 minutes talking while digesting. 

Definately a great place to grab a glass of wine and some snacks OR for a full on multicourse meal with friends. They even have a communal table in front of the open kitchen.",bKGgPuuLg5aWrZVKxCD2hA,0,0,5,o2ZkZ_KgeqLJGf3uAbaXEg

Some downs: I've been there twice now, and both times the pasta dishes were too salty for my taste (meat sauce w/angel hair, tortelloni, and the seafood cous cous).  I noticed similar concerns about things being salty.  I had the bread pudding which was cold and disappointing as well.

Yet, he had no problem serving us the saturated fat meat plate that would eventually kill us. While we discussed this among ourselves that it must be a cost cutting decision, the chef came out and berated us and proceeded to try to explain his philosophy on the reason for eliminating this very essential product served in all Italian restaurant's. He made us aware that to add vinegar to his loss leading cost of $1.75 to give his patrons bread and oil would not be beneficial to him as a business man. Hence, our original argument of cost costing was correct.

Wine:
We had a bottle of Ill Boro, the 2006 Toscana. It was exquisite. Paired perfectly with the lamb chops doused in red wine reduction... words can't justify how I felt with each and every delectable bite.

Entrees:
In addition to the delicious lamb chops I mentioned above, I had a second dish, the Rabbit 5-Ways. This was also ok. I say ok for two reasons:

1. The lamb chops & wine pairing stole the show (salivating just thinking about it!). This is what puts the review at 5 stars.

2. The rabbit was slightly too well done. It was dry, not juicy or tender. I still ate it because it was tasty, but when you have a rare meat, you sort of expect a higher grade experience, ya know?

Next time, ask for Bebe the somolier and someone PLEASE let me know if you enjoyed the Monkfish Picatta...that will be my next choice!",qORzbdZ8oE22u_NWI410MA,1,1,5,AZTRtj8dsoFlwTiMAHsqAA

My mom and I came in here for a few drinks and some appetizers in the middle of the afternoon (3pm).  Cannot wait to go back!!!

We had:
Bruschette (Pick 3 for $9.00)
1. Roasted Garlic & Onion
2. Roasted Mushrooms, Peppers & Gorgonzola
3. Shrimp & Avocado
-ALL WERE FANTASTIC!  We sat at the bar, and the bartender knew we would share, and had them cut in half- perfect!

The bartender recommended the: Burrata Caprese.
AMAZING!!!  The cheese was delicious!  Never had something so creamy but still hold it's shape. The flavors all came together wonderfully.  (like a regular caprese salad... but MUCH MUCH better!)

I had a Bellini (yum!) and a glass of red Sangria (huge glass for $8) and it was probably the best sangria I have had all year. (and I drink a lot of Sangria...haha!)

2146377,2010-02-04,0,ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg,"Owned by ""sons of Nora"" from Nora's Italian restaurant on West Flamingo, Nora's Wine Bar and Osteria located in the toney Rampart Mall in the upscale Summerlin area in NW Las Vegas is as different from the ""mother ship"" as day is to night.

AMBIANCE: This is combination wine bar and upscale Italian dining with a menu designed for shareable plates.  We enjoyed our first visit; the food and service were both very good.  (But REALLY...they need to turn down the music on the sound system which is ""dance club"" loud.)  An open kitchen adds to the casual but hip feel of the place, along with white tablecloths, high backed black chairs, and just right ambiant lighting.

WINE,   both by the bottle and glass, is pricey.   Sampling flights are featured in the wine list and one can create their own ""sampling"" in pours from the oh so trendy ""Enomatic"" wine server in 3, 6 or 9 ounces.  We selected four Italian reds in 3 ounce pours and the wine total was nearly $39.00.  

OUR MEAL, for two, included good arancini, dates stuffed with parmesan and wrapped in crispy bacon, pappardelle with succulent wild boar ragu and a small serving of nicely sauteed baby spinach.   We would order them all a second time.  And...the bread!  An assortment of really good breads served in a small, white napkin lined metal basket along with a sampling of three different olive oils for dipping and three different salts for sprinkiing.  A perfect start to the meal to set the stage and tone.  Well done.

A disappointment of the evening was the dessert course of a trio of panna cotta.  The three flavors - salted caramel, citrus and espresso - were lovely, perfectly flavored and not too sweet.  But there was simply too much gelatin in the panna cotta, making them more stiff than the unctuous, silky texture they should be.  

SERVICE: The espresso one of us ordered to accompany dessert was served nice and hot.  Which was, in part, a function of the great service we enjoyed all night.  In addition to the waitress who took our order (her first night she told us and she was doing a good job) there were runners from the kitchen as well as a most professional server's assistant who delivered the dessert, coffee and the bread that started our meal.

VALUE: The total bill, savory dishes, wine, espresso and dessert was just about $100. But there were lots of choices on the creative, well designed menu, like great looking pizzas for an average price of about $14 or salads for about $12, that would have allowed the two of us to eat at a more ""bargain"" price, especially if we had selected only one pour of wine each.

BOTTOM LINE: The restaurant was about half full at 7:00 on a Wednesday night and seemed to be mostly Summerlin area locals.  One of Nora's Wine Bar owners was in Nora's Restaurant the night before, as were we, and he sat  at a table behind us to speak with customers there who were apparently long time patrons of Nora's. He said the Wine Bar is enjoying great success.  We can see why!  We'll be back when we visit Las Vegas again.",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,1,1,4,KUUUNkwR7yzcX2o38AYTQQ
2206235,2010-08-23,1,ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg,"This review pertains to the dinner menu.

The Skinny: the best lasagna in Vegas is here folks! (4) but the service unfortunately has taken a turn for the worse (2) value: it's okay but a little on the pricey side for some items (see below, 2.5).

I'm not sure what's been happening lately but Nora's been a little disappointing over the past couple of weeks.

We went last week for linner (lunch/dinner) at around 4:30 on Monday. The restaurant was still relatively quiet (maybe 5-6 tables). Our server was all over the room and obviously carrying the majority of the load. Albeit, he took our orders promptly and was quite personable, the beverage refills were slow in coming.

We used to love their bread service. The types of EVOO and different salts were labelled  and described on their plates while there was at least 3-4 types of bread to munch on. Our last experience, there was no labels and only one type of bread which was a far cry from our previous visits.

If you come here, you must order their absolutely divine crepe lasagna. It's really bings all the taste receptors in your mouth in a harmonious heavenly fashion. The meat sauce, bechamel, and peas really work together nicely. Love the lightness of the crepes versus the use of regular pasta. Nora's has ruined me for all over lasagnas for the rest of my life.

The rollo di pollo, which we ordered for the first time, was a little on the bland side. Supposedly using Jidori organic chicken, it's hard to make the chicken shine with so many ingredients on the plate (ham, provolone, arugula). When it comes to great chicken like that, less is definitely more. This dish was billed as a type of chicken parm - which it clearly wasn't - there wasn't anything fried or crispy on the plate. So overall, I was a little disappointed with this dish.

Also tried the fried potatoes with truffle salt. First of all, I won't deny that the fries were really great - they had the flavour and even crispier texture than the Double Arches (which I hate to admit it, is the gold standard I judge all other french fries). The unfortunate thing was the truffle salt. The truffle salt wasn't infused with enough truffle flavour. The dish really needed some truffle oil aioli or something. In the end of the day, you ended up getting was a slightly upscale plate of Mickey D's french fries (which are awesome, don't get me wrong) for $10. A bit overpriced for what it is.

Overall, a 3.5 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,4,3,AOeSJRGMwDSeC6Pkh5p-mA
2225495,2007-12-14,0,ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg,"i must preface this review with the fact that we don't drink.
we have never and will never come here for the wine.
we're strictly foodies.
therefore we have no opinion in regards to the wine.
although my best friend, who is a connoisseur of wine, stated that she really enjoyed all of the wine pairings that she received with the food.

we've eaten here several times and we've introduced all of our friends to it.
we were patrons of the original nora's so when we heard that they'd opened a new place in summerlin, we were all over it.
the first, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and possibly 5th time we ate here, we had a server named antonio.
he was cool as f**k!
recommended good stuff, friendly, funny, attentive, etc.
he was also fluent in tagalog which mom & dad were so thrilled about.
to our pleasant surprise, everything is served family style.
you know my chinese ass is all over that!
ha!

so our first meal here consisted of the bruschette, caesar salad, penne alla vodka, rib eye, orange roughy, salmon pizza (which they no longer serve) and of course the bread pudding for deessert.
the bruschette is served 3 or 5 pieces and you get to choose your toppings.
we had the sardine one, mushroom one and eggplant one.
all yummy!
the caesar salad could very well be the best i've had in a long time.
the penne alla vodka was delish as the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was so good i seriously wanted to lick the bowl clean.
the rib eye was smothered in this buttery sauce clogging my arteries with every bite.
the roughy, served with a faggioli sauce, was cooked perfectly again with the plate lickable sauce.
then the bread pudding, oh the bread pudding, made with panettone (italian holiday bread).
serious mouthwatering going on here.
it is so good and i don't even like bread pudding!

and here are other dishes we've ordered since then...
spinach & belgian endive salad with radicchio, apples, gorgonzola, candied walnuts and fig vinaigrette.
arancini - fried risotto balls
brown bag potatoes
pasta a forno - baked penne, ground beef, ham, peas, sliced eggs & ricotta cheese
papardelle alla luisa - papardelle, sausage, sun dried tomatoes & cream
scallops & bottarga (sicilian caviar) - spaghetti, diver scallops, salted tuna roe & garlic
warm chocolate cake which needs to be ordered early with your meal.

the last couple times we went they had changed their bread service.
before they used to just serve bread with olive oil & vinegar.
they serve the same hot bread but now you get an olive oil and sea salt sampler which i think is so clever and quite tasty.

we haven't been back in some time.
i think we'll go tomorrow!
=)

12/14/07 - update - i told you we'd go today.
i wish we hadn't because our server was terrible!
wah!
but the food was still good and our busser, who ended up taking our order because our server was too busy to pay any attention to us, was awesome!
we ordered a couple of different items today.
sauteed spinach.
pork siciliana.
both so yummy!

UPDATE:  friends of ours went there for the first time and ordered the stuff we usually get but they also got the boar, which is freakin outrageously delicious.  one of our friends took one bite of the boar, closed her eyes, breathed a big huge sigh, sat back in her chair, chewed, swallowed, opened her eyes and said 'oh my gawd, that is so good!  it could very well be better than s..'.  nuff said.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,1,1,4,7u9MaLtxClV5-LS7dYScSQ

2289793,2010-12-04,0,ifEHr-ZnGFSKgJVsywiAFg,"I still dig this place, but I have to knock it down a star.  We showed up around 9-9:30 pm on a Friday night.  The place was pretty empty but the hostess took a while trying to figure out if she could seat us.  I guess they were closing sections.

They changed their menu... it's now printed on some fabric with a suede frame.  A little weird because people have dripped food on it. 

Our server, Diego, was super friendly and helpful.  He even took our groupon without blinking.  My only complaints would be that he asked if he was cut within earshot of us and he assumed I did not know what rapini is.  But that's all forgivable.  

We got:
Pork tanata - a cold pork dish with capers, olives and a mustard-cream sauce.  Very good.  This was a special so I'm not sure they always have it.

Orecchiette (thank God for Google as spell check!) - gnocchi-like pasta with tomatoes, sausage and rapini.  The orecchiette is also good, but filling.  This is the dish with the rapini so if you don't like bitter vegetables in your pasta, stay away.  I think that's why the server was trying to explain rapini to me.  I guess he got burned before.

Grilled lemon leaves stuffed with meat - kinda of self explanatory.  Made with three kinds of meat, although I neglected to find out what three kinds.  This dish is very, very good. But get instructions on how to eat it.  Let's just say I screwed it up, even after the server explained it.  

Rabbit 5 ways - Served saltimbocca, agro dolce, ragu, confit and grilled. Saltimbocca is like a roll, with rabbit in this case.  The agro dolce is sweet and sour meatballs, just made with rabbit.  The ragu is a very good tomato sauce pasta with ground rabbit.  Confit is cold rabbit, served with capers.  And grilled, is well, grilled.  I highly recommend it. Just don't linger... when the hot dishes get cold it is not so good.  

As always, we got our wine from the enomatic machine.  They've changed the system since I was last here.  Before, you purchased a card and put a certain about of money on it.  When the money was gone, you'd have to recharge the card.  Now the server gives you a blank card that totals up how much wine you get and then they charge you at the end.  I guess this could be dangerous because you might limit yourself more if the card runs out of money.  But I like it better - no more recharging the card or having a card with $0.94 on it with nothing to buy.  

The reason why I am deducting a star, maybe a half star, is the hostess decided to start cleaning the metal buckets on the tables with Windex while people were still dining.  I abhor the smell of Windex.  And it was only 10pm.  The restaurant is open until 11pm.  Maybe I could understand if we were there past closing - people gotta go home.  But not 1 hour before closing.

Also, a word of warning about take-out.  Just call.  Don't use the online ordering system.  One time I used the online ordering system, they did not bother to check the computer and had not started making my order when I arrived.  They were very apologetic but still.  Also, the menu online is not accurate.  The menu has changed.  So you risk ordering things and then getting a call that the items you ordered are not available... this is all assuming that they got your order.  So, just call... the old fashioned way.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,4,1,4,8DwGK82Z1ANC3we16326qA

Our last visit was by far the best it has ever been, but I give it four stars on an average of our experience.  As others have said, it is a small little restaurant with a large wine bar attached.  

During our last visit, we noticed they had changed some items and put the menus on a suede cards.  The first thing was that the bruchetta, which is one of their signature items, has been changed.  Now they offer several pieces of bread, which has been seasoned and toasted, along with 4 cups filled with the toppings you select, so you make your own.  Overall, very good.  The sausage and rapini topping was excellent, as were the mushroom/onion/gorgonzola, the tomato/basil and the one I forget.  My wife and I shared an excellent antipasto salad, which was filled with mozzarella and ham and salami, with a nice bed of green lettuce.  It also had peppers and tomato and was very good.  Dinner was squash gnocchi and orechiette pasta with rapini and sausage.  Both were excellent.  The squash were buttery, yet light and chewy.  The pasta was delicious as it had a nice kick from the sausage, and a great texture with the chewiness of the pasta and the sharp rapini contrast. 

Dessert was a bit of a downer though. We ordered an italian plate with butterscotch panna cotta, sfongi with honey, some fried ravioli with some sweet filling and some pistachio cannoli.  The panna cotta, while good, was vanilla.  The sfongi were SALTY and not very good.  The ravioli tasted too ""fried"", and the cannoli had a very heavy and thick over fried shell.  The waiter was very nice and inquired for us, and found that a) yes, it was vanilla by accident, which while still good, the butterscotch was the main reason my wife wanted it and b) yes they put way too much baking powder in the sfongi.  They brought me a little chocolate tart to have, but honestly, they should have removed it from the bill.  I mean, of the 4 items, 1 was misadvertised, 1 was admittedly screwed up, and the other 2 were not very good and we didn't eat them.  This kind of chapped me.  Otherwise, a stellar meal.

Overall, other visits have been good enough to always get us to come back every few months (it isn't cheap), but never blown us away.  This meal was very very good overall, and we will definitely return.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,0,0,4,ldfzg9EI3TqxeTDKz6HJqg

They have an extensive wine selection but nothing to write home about. A few rare gems can be found (5 Turley Wines). Unfortunately, they rely heavily on Italian varietals. Mostly Nebbiolo and Sangiovese, both of those are not to my liking, but I digress. The atmosphere was buzzing with a steady hum. A local place where the bar area is mixed with bankers, musicians, software engineers and CEOs. All entertaining new acquaintances merrily, along their wine and cheese selections. 

On to the Dinner. The Service was attentive and prompt. The Waiter, Giancarlo was very helpful and suggested a great Russian River Zinfandel. We started with an Endive & Fig salad. It was delicious, with bits of blue cheese and sugared walnuts, but a bit on the dry side. The Main course was a lightly tossed capellini with slightly roasted tomato, fresh basil and EVOO. It was perfectly cooked and amply served. Nora's is about sharing. All the portions are served in platters and basins, so I would suggest one appetizer and one entree if you're sharing.

Overall I was very satisfied with the ambiance, service and food but there was something missing. Maybe our selection didn't showcase the chef's brilliance or maybe the intent is to nourish and imbibe casually, while the conversations and chats take center stage. Either way, it's was not a mind-blowing experience, and that's ok. I will definitely come back again and again.",qcipOrZqqLTEknJkV8IekQ,1,0,4,i46He3tkZVHji5JVNf1gzQ

The first time, the service was knockout amazing and the food was really good. We had a three year old with us and the waitstaff treated him like a king, and he was super well behaved, so it spoke well of the place. I had spaghetti with marinara, she had the crepe lasagna. I wasn't crazy about the crepe lasagna but other people like it.

Second time, I took my teenaged brother for a holiday night. Again, the food was really good. I wasn't crazy about my penne vodka but he got the gnocci with the oxtail ragu, which I adored. We sat on the patio and I felt sometimes slightly ignored, but that was okay for the mood.

Third time, I took my mom for her birthday with teenaged brother on 11/13. Food was mostly okay - my brother got the swordfish and no one liked that. The caprese appetizer could use more of the tomatoes. My gnocci was still great but the caesar salad was served with half a chunk of the head of lettuce uncut. They were really busy and we were really demanding, but service wasn't 100%. Spots on the silverwear, my mom's steak was really pretty rare for 'medium' and had to be taken back, etc.

The one thing I will say is that unlike the other reviewer here on the same night, my mom really liked her special dessert plate. Nutella ice cream is a good idea - my mom is not an adventurous eater so it was right in her dessert range.

I loved Nora's, always went and got the cheese selection, the manager Nate was awesome, and the wine fantastic.  Things have changed.  Nate is no longer there, and the new manager seems very stand-offish.  The cheese selection has changed, it is not a plate where you pick your own cheese anymore, it is just a cheese platter with a few types.  The wine is still good, but it's changing to a strictly Italian format.  

The service was horrible, and I am as easy as they come, and as a server, I never complain, but this was so bad that my boyfriend, a F&B manager, was even upset, and he never gets upset.  The restaurant was not packed and even if it was, all the server had to do was acknowledge us, not ignore us for quite a while.  We eventually got so upset that we just cut our night short and asked for the check.

The food was good, we got the antipasto salad, asked for no onions, but they must have forgot.  We got the meat platter, and it was good, but I asked for bread 3 times so I could eat it with it, and it took 15 mins and 3 servers to bring it.  That's when we decided to just leave and not order more, but since I had an email club offer for a dessert, we decided to wait for that.

Oh, and the dessert, oh no.  I love sweets and always enjoy dessert, but this was bleh!  It was a special plate that comes with a chocolate mousse, a chocolate molten cake, a chocolate gelato, and some chocolate truffles.  First off, the mousse literally comes on the plate looking like a pile of crap, yes, poop.  I wish I would have taken a picture, it looked like a pile of dog crap, I didn't even want to try it, but I did, and it was not very good.  The chocolate lava cake was cold, and the lava in the middle was congealed instead of warm and flowing.  The gelato tasted icey and milky, not creamy at all.  The truffles were eh, they looked pretty but not much taste.  It was just a very unappetizing selection, and I love dessert, I'll eat anything sweet.

I was not happy with this experience at all, and I don't think I could ever bring myself to go back.  I loved Nora's, but things have changed, and it no longer has the same feel it used to.  I am sad, I feel like I lost a great place to go.",3KFZ0P6I3_55iFU-KOSc8Q,0,0,2,8biR7vZtYVxgFo2kQYB8EA

I've been here before and as expected... Nora's does not fail to please. 

Went to Nora's after the movies on Saturday evening and we were seated right away at 6pm. By 7pm, the place was packed...not an empty table anywhere. 

Definitely make reservations. We got lucky.... being able to just walk right in. 

The olive oil and salt sampler with your bread is definitely a unique experience and a fun sampler. Who knew there was so much taste difference? I take salt and olive oil for granted..... 

Everything is family style so order with sharing in mind. 
They also focus on wine samplers / flights and a DIY wine machine with like 50 different wines....so if you are adventurous these are a good way to try different wines. You can, of course, order by the glass. 

Service: A+ courteous and attentive without being annoying 

Ambiance: It's like one big, loud Italian dinner. Don't go expecting a quiet, romantic meal. 

What we enjoyed: 

Appetizers: Dates wrapped in applewood smoked bacon... YUM! Squash blossoms filled with ricotta.... so light and tasty. 

Pasta: we ordered the Roman Gnocchi where the sauce was rich, meaty and decadent. 

Salads: order the 1/2 orders if it's just 2-3 people. The Antipasto salad was HUGE and it was just a half.... could have easily fed 4. The Marinated Veg salad was just the right size for 2 people.

It took five minutes for our server to get our drink orders because he was handling half of the restaurant on his own.  That was okay, considering the busy lunch hour, so we ordered appetizers and waited for our food while drinking a bottle of wine.  The wine was a 65 dollar bottle, and it was just okay.  I was shocked a wine like that would cost that much.  Maybe I'm just spoiled, but it wasn't as great as he suggested.  Our appetizers were out after 20 minutes, and all we ordered were grilled artichokes and truffle fries.  Taste-wise, it was okay and not exciting or interesting at all.  

The worst part of the meal was the chicken Frank ordered and the pizza I tried out.  Frank's bbq chicken was literally raw when it came out.  It had the grill marks outside, but was stone cold and red on the inside.  They re-fired the chicken and it took about 8 minutes to get the chicken again, only to have it raw.  AGAIN.  Needless to say he had violent food poisoning that evening and all day the next day.  As for my pizza, it was so bland and depressing that we ended up paying out 100 dollar ticket there and going to Grimaldi's across the street just to make ourselves feel better about a bad food and pizza experience.  

This place isn't worth the money or worth another try in six months, which I usually do when a restaurant does so poorly the first time around. Why?  Because there is no excuse for serving raw chicken.  Twice.  That's just ridiculous, especially for an established place like Nora's.  

If you want amazing pizza, skip this place and go across the street.  Want grilled chicken?  Check El Pollo Loco.  I bet they could do it ten times better than this place.  Whether it was a fluke day or not, there is no excuse for line cooks or the regular chefs to mess it up.  They should know better.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,0,1,yKtYrUhhZGcyk6bvMbRd4A

Wine selection is vast, particularly by the glass but the actual selections are not inspired, and there are no bargains.

Food wants to be high-end but just succeeds in being high-bland.

Bread selection is shockingly weak: some regular italian slices and some over-salted focaccia. The elaborate pouring of three olive oils doesn't cover the weak selection.

This time, we went back because I had a Groupon... $40 worth of food for $20.  I think the menu changed, because it didn't seem familiar to us at all.  Much more tapas-oriented now, which is OK by us.

We started with the torta fritta, which was fried dough served with meats and cheeses.  Then we had the arancini, which was baked risotto balls with mozzarella cheese.  My girlfriend loved that dish.  Next we had the polpette agro, which are swedish sweet & sour meatballs.  Also delicious.  Lastly, we had the pesto gnocchi.  I was craving gnocchi when I got there, but I was a little disappointed with Nora's take on it.  Just not the texture of gnocchi I was craving.

Overall, I was very happy with our meal.  Total bill was $45 before taking off the Groupon, which means I paid $25 for all of this, plus tip.

Had lunch here yesterday with a few friends.  Our server was attentive and we never went very long without anything.  I supposed pouring him a taste of our wine didn't hurt.  

Speaking of wine, Nora's Wine Bar allows for corkage, as long as they don't have the same wine in stock.  The waiter originally told us it would be $10 per bottle, but it showed up as $20 on our final bill.  No biggie.  I brought a 1999 Duckhorn Three Palms Merlot and a 2004 Blankiet Estate Cabernet.  

We got things rolling slowly, ordering three bruschette:  roasted garlic and onion; tomato and basil; and mushrooms and roasted peppers.  None of the three really stood out as being amazing or that I would crave.  The tomato basil was especially disappointing, as there just wasn't a whole lot of flavor to it.

Next, we ordered the artisan cheese platter with three selections.  I can't remember what they were called, but one was a soft cheese, much like a brie, but with a bit more nuttiness.  We chose to have the truffle cheese twice because, well, I like truffles.  The soft cheese was good, but nothing to write home about.  The truffle cheese was good, with that great earthy quality of black truffles - I do wish it was a little stronger in flavor, though.  The platter came with candied walnuts (yum), some kind of cranberry sauce (meh) and delicious honey.

While we ate our cheese, we saw a big antipasto salad delivered to a neighboring table and decided to order it.  Meats and cheeses were plentiful, lettuce was crunchy and fresh, and the tomatoes nice and ripe.  It was a good salad, but it could have used more pizazz; maybe a more flavorful dressing or use heirloom tomatoes or something.  I guess it is a salad, but it doesn't have to be plain.

To finish the meal, we ordered a serving of four lamb chops.  These things were big and meaty.  We ordered them medium-rare and they could not have been cooked more perfectly.  Whatever seasoning was on it was delicious!  Maybe just salt and pepper, but I felt like licking the stuff off it was that good.

It's a good joint and has some interesting menu items.  But a lot of the dishes just don't stand out from a very crowded and competitive market for my discretionary funds (sorry, been watching too much CNBC lately).

I was there in December and virtually all enomatic wines had been changed to italian wines and many lacked any written descriptions (supposedly because the changes were still getting tweaked).  

Kinda hard to stomach paying in the 3 buck range for only about two big sips of wine that you know zero about.  And had to go back and forth with the bartender in a ridiculous ""who's on first"" exchange when I simply wanted to put cash on an existing enomatic card.

New menu too as has been mentioned in previous reviews.  Bruschetta variety is still as yummy as ever and is a great snack with the variety of mystery wine samples.

We decided to come here because one of our friends had the awesome Groupon deal. $40 bucks off and we were able to use both of her Groupons...so we had $80 bucks taken of the total tab! We decided to start with the bruschette. I decided to try the Mushroom, roasted peppers and Gorgonzola as this was recommended by the server. It was definitely a good recommendation.   We also decided to start with the Arancini balls loaded with risotto and mozzarella. I was not so impressed. There were parts of the ball that were very hard (too hard to bite) and the texture was just not consistent. 

We decided to go family style on our meals since there was only 4 of us. We all came into an agreement and ordered the Veal Osso Bucco, Roasted Chicken Thighs, Papperdelle Luisa and the large Caesar salad. I'm not a huge fan of salads, because I feel that you can make it easily at home and really its just a bunch of lettuce. The Caesar salad was nothing special, I am a bigger fan of their Antipasto Salad instead. The Osso Bucco was delicious! Tender and juicy, everything it should be with a spoon for the bone marrow. I'm not a fan of dark meat and this chicken was not my favorite. There was nothing to it that made it stand out from the rest of the meal. The Papperdelle Luisa was probably my favorite dish of the night. I'm a huge sucker for carbs and the pasta was cooked perfectly with a biteful of flavor.  

I enjoyed Nora's, but I really don't think that it should take about 3 hours for a simple meal like the one we had. Luckily I enjoyed the company, but I was not too happy about the VERY slow service. If it wasn't for my previous experiences at Nora's, I would have given them 3 stars.

The wine bottles are of course part of the decor and ambiance. I think I may have even passed a wine cellar room to get to the bathroom.

Nora indulges in the Italian culture. It plays to an older crowd. A more sophisticated crowd that's slightly more pretentious than Nora's Cuisine. But that's OK because this is a place where you can take a date or your visiting folks and be proud. The wine selection is top notch and you can even do tastings at the enomatic bar. 

Their homemade bread is served with 3 different olive oils, and 3 different sea salts. Seriously, they had me at the salt at this point and the food was free so far. The Salish Alderwood smoked sea salt was so good I had to buy a bottle on the way out.  Their Bruschette are just to die for. My favorite is the Eggplant caponata.  Pair that with the cheese selection and I'm already feeling stuffed at the Primi.  We ordered the a traditional pasta dish but it was slightly salty.

I couldn't even make it to the desert which I'm sure will be divine. Then again, McDonald's 99c soft serve was calling my name in the next door plaza.

If I love Nora's anymore than this, I'll name my next child after the restaurant.

1. Service: WONDERFUL - no question- no doubt. It wasn't standard service, it was EXCELLENT service.
2. Starters: Bummer. Concept and flavors were outstanding. We had the squash blossoms with a delicious goat cheese ricotta. They were almost perfect, but.... they weren't fried long enough, or until golden.
We also had the Arancini: risotto was al dente unfortunately, instead of all onda - which ruined them. They were a bit over-salted and they too, were not fried long enough.
3. Bread: perfect Housemade bread three ways and the salts/olive oil combinations were interactive and delicious
4. Crepe Lasagna: As most reviewers have commented: Memorable and reason enough to return
5. Wild Boar Pizza: Fantastic. I was afraid that it was going to be over-salted, since I've had many experiences with overly salted boar but... it was perfect. The ragu was gentle and like the crepe, no flavors competed with each other. The crust was clean... if that makes sense. Just perfect with just the right balance. It had wonderful texture all the way around except the middle of the pizza was a bit soggy- it could have been cooked longer.
6. Wine selection: very good
7. Espresso: not good at all, bummer.

I came in with mind made up - the lamb chops ($12.50) or the grilled chicken thighs ($9.50). 

We show up and not only is the menu ridiculous (a leather menu?!), but it has no descriptions and it's COMPLETELY different from the website menu found here (http://www.noraswinebar.com/lunch.pdf ). Hey Nora's, we're in the internet age - keep your website up to date!

I settled on the ribeye ($17), my coworkers got the chicken milanese and the salmon with pasta. We started with some bacon wrapped dates. 

Dates were tasty but can't compete with FireFly. Salmon eating coworker seemed happy, chicken eating coworker was disappointed (the chicken milanese at regular nora's is WAY better), and my ribeye was fabulous. I was pretty bummed when they showed up with diced up ribeye, but it was legit. It was cooked medium-rare as requested (no easy feat on diced meat) and I was happy with the microgreen salad despite how heavy on the dill it was. A delicious filling lunch, but for $17 it should be!

I tried the following items for my dinner:

Polpette Agro Dolce - Sicilian sweet & sour meatballs, panelle.  I liked this appetizer. The flavor was nice and the meatballs were tasty. (4)

Oxtail Roman Gnocchi - Oxtail ragu, baked semolina gnocch . Didn't like this one too much though, since it was too salty for me. (2)

Nora's Wild Boar Pancetta & Beans - Roasted wild boar belly, white lentils.  I asked for a recommendation and this was one of them, and it was good.  The wild boar was tender and flavorful, with a slight gamey taste.  (4)

I also tried their Sicilian Plate (their largest dessert item) for dessert.  It consisted of the following:
1) Cannoli stuffed with house made goat's milk ricotta, and rough chopped Sicilian pistachios; 
2) Sfingi di Ricotta, a light Sicilian donut made with ricotta, that is served with warm lavender honey on a spoon. (one of my favorite desserts in that dessert plate)
3) Cassata Sicilian, a layered sponge cake with ricotta (also house made), and marzipan.
4) Sweet Ravioli made with ricotta, dusted with cinnamon.

Overall I thought the desserts looked good, but it wasn't too interesting. If you enjoy ricotta cheese, then that will be the best part of the dessert.  Otherwise, having two components that are fried seemed too much for me.  

Service was good. My waiter Diego was good at what he does.  Makes good recommendations and offers explainations as needed, and he wasn't pushy.  Courses were served in a timely manner without too much wait time in between, the pace of the meal felt perfect. (4.5/5)

Price - maybe a touch on the pricy side for what you get, but it is in a nice neighborhood with presumably higher rent. (3.5/5)

Atmosphere was pleasant.  Everyone in the restaurant seemed to have been enjoying themselves. (4/5) 

Overall, I thought it was a solid 4 stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,5,4,EEVaiDlNWfb5w7GcCgl3Jw

Each and every time, special.  Warm service, lovely food, and exceptional wines.  It was very comfortable.  Always greeted with a smile, and left with a smile that was my own.

I loved their bolognese, which was really dark and almost a smoky flavor.  But I tried nearly all of the menu.

The down and fall may have been the wine store that never opened, or the expansion of the extra side room -- in excess of too much square footage?  I don't know.

To you I toast, thank you...thank you...thank you.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,5,5,5,4vdY_dgu8463VEGgAahHUQ

The service is slow. My party of six waited quite a bit of time for our waiter to acknowledge us. My food was just ok and refills weren't as quick on water and other drinks as I would like. 

When it was time to pack up our meals to go my waiter dropped my food on the floor . The food splashed and hit some of my friend's purses, shoes and jackets, which was annoying. Especially since they left the broken plate and food there for quite a while until they finally sent someone to clean it up after we asked two times. I think it was nice that they replaced my meal free of charge, but since I didn't really enjoy my meal, I didn't really want more of it, lol. I ended up just giving my leftovers to a friend to take home with her. 

When it came time to order dessert our waiter couldn't seem to get it right. He had three different desserts sent out and none of them were what he had ordered. Finally we just gave up as we were running out of time and needed to get going. On top of all that, he was slow with the check and actually tried to charge us for two of the desserts that he sent out incorrectly, despite the fact that we neither ordered nor ate them.

The only saving graces were the cheese plate and some of the dishes I tasted from my friend's plates were decent.

Not sure I have much interest in going back.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,1,2,dx06PbIXg4mC0riAsIIKzA
