19134,2017-07-17,0,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,Awesome place to check out on the strip . Foods really cheap and beyond awesome for the price. I got the Gaelic chicken with mashed potatoes and it was amazing and my son had gotten mac and cheese really good and not like most restaurants just give the kids microwaveable mac and cheese it was made with fresh pasta and cheese hands down the best . Also our server was beyond amazing and attentive very friendly and quick ! So if you want good food and amazing service I would definitely give tilted kilt a try and Ask for Courtney she is amazing !

It's fun, lively, the girls are very pretty and polite, and the drinks are good. We got beers and I ordered a cinnamon toast shot - though I think she liked Mr. Harris, because it was really a double shot.

182528,2014-06-23,0,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"I feel very conflicted in writing this review, but I think it needs to be written. Our party arrived at 4:30pm in order to get a good view of the TVs for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals.

The good: Food. Everything we ordered came out cooked well and tasted fantastic. The beer cheese? AMAZING. Pulled Pork? Fantastic. After ordering fries from the happy hour menu (more on this later), it took about 20 minutes to get them. Our server gave us a second order at no charge. That's really where the ""good"" ends.

The bad: They didn't have ANY drinks available for happy hour! What kind of bar, new or old, doesn't have drinks available for happy hour?! It's on the menu, but they ""haven't figured out the pricing for it yet."" So you still pay Strip prices for alcohol. This was a huge disappointment that they hopefully fix very soon.

The UGLY: After being there for a couple hours (3 periods, plus intermissions and OT), someone decided to change the channel in the middle of the OT period. We waited for about 2 minutes before we bailed on our check and ran down the way to Yard House who had the game on. We did come back to pay our check and watch the second OT period, but they had split up our table and didn't put the game back on the TV we had been watching. Our server apologized, but the only comment we received from management was ""you should've stayed. They got the game back on,"" met with a chuckle. As a Kings fan, during the eventual Cup winning game, I felt this was very rude and a little bit disrespectful.

I won't trust Tilted Kilt LV to air any professional sport in its entirety from here out. I understand it could have been a freak incident, but to cause customers and fans to potentially miss the game winning goal and NOT APOLOGIZING is pathetic. They are lucky we were honest people that came back to pay the check. Get your issues hashed out and put booze on the happy hour menu and MAYBE I'll change my star rating. Until then, I won't recommend this place to anyone.",QmkyZNoC6gQUfPYeMhnQBQ,0,0,2,_lGSO7-pXpBNcO2irIwOFg

Bad service from the get go. Walked up to the front and 3 hosts standing there. No smiles or even a greeting. We were the first to speak and we said ""for 2"". Because they just stared at us. Pretty rude. The blonde girl walked us to the table, silent and seemed as she could care less. Then our server was alright until we were finished with our food and drinks and didn't receive our check until 30 min after we were finished. It was also the Tuesday block party so there are specials at all the restaurants and shops and for tilted kilt it's 20% entire check. We received our check and of course there is no discount on there. So when the server came by to pick up the check we asked where is the 20% off discount and she replied in shock, ""ooh yeah I can do that for you."" So I suggest if you are coming in for their specials for the Tuesday block party you ask!! I'm sure she was hoping we didn't know about the 20% off. 

We ordered off the hoppy hour menu. The prices are good. Range from $2-$4 appetizers. Food was decent. 

Holy hell the beer is damn expensive. They have better deals at other bars at the linq. 32 for 3 beers and 2 were summer shandy?! The beer was more expensive than our food.

465806,2017-09-29,0,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"We were in town last weekend for a wedding and attempted to eat here twice. The first time was a Wednesday night and there may have been 15 other people there at the time, all at the bar. There were literally NO tables seated in the entire restaurant. There were 8 of us and we were sat under the big screen, next to a speaker and a sub. There was an amazing mix of hip hop happening, which would have been amazing if we had brought our glow sticks and dancing shoes. Unfortunately, we all just flew into town and hadn't eaten for hours and just wanted to talk over some burgers. We asked the hostess if we could move to the table in the far back corner where there were no speakers. She replied that there wasn't a server for that table. When we asked if our original server could just take us at the other table, she stared at us with a look of confusion and said she didn't think that was possible... we left.

The second time was Sunday around 11:30 am, we were hoping to get a table to watch the Packers & the Chiefs. We approached the host stand where there were 3 gals talking to each other. After a minute or so, one of them acknowledged us and we asked if we could put our name in... she looked very confused and said that there wouldn't be a table until the game ended around 12:45. We told her that wasn't a problem the games we wanted to watch were at 1:30, we would like to put our name on the waitlist. At that time, one of the other gals knocked over the bin of silverware. Our hostess stopped talking to us, mid sentence, laughed and bent down to pick up the silverware and chat with her coworker. We waited. A minute or so later, she stood back up and said there is no waitlist. If we wanted to get a table we had to stand there until one was ready... we left.

The atmosphere is ""sports bar busyness.""  Both days we sat at the bar rather than in the dining area.  The bartenders were attentive and friendly.  I ordered the spicy southwest chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and both were awesome!  The fries were cooked perfectly - I like them crispy.  The wrap was filled with chunks of chicken and veggies.  The southwest sauce added the perfect amount of zing.  I also ordered a side of the pre-game fried pickle chips.  The breading on them was super-thin - unlike any I'd had before - and I loved them.  They come with a cayenne mayo (?) dipping sauce that I actually enjoyed with my sweet potato fries.  My husband ordered the black and blue burger - piled high with blue cheese crumbles and onion strings.  The prices of the meals were reasonable ($12.50 for my wrap and $13.50 for the burger) - the drinks a little on the high side ($8 for a 16oz draft beer and $12 for a double Captain Coke).  But given that this is just off the Strip in Vegas, it was to be expected.  Speaking of the location, the LINQ shopping area provided a nice respite from the busyness of the Strip.  There are several places to shop or eat along the area.  It's also close to the High Roller Wheel.",W2K4mH4kYVvU8RdQLy8Xrg,0,0,4,T9bP4qyb8rtH4XXKW9W0Kw

578265,2015-09-16,0,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"Last football season, our group ate here a lot because they're one of the only places in the Linq that plays sound for at least one of the games. The food portions, especially with regard to the burgers, was ample. And there were also some good choices for what's on tap. It wasn't inexpensive, but prices weren't outrageous either.

This time however, during happy hour on Sunday for game day; the burgers we were served were a sad shadow of last years in portion and accompanying fries. Bland fries and sparse toppings for the burger. The beer, of which I got the monthly special so it was a dollar off, was $11 a glass. The service was about what you'd expect on a crowded game day, but for waiting as long as we did for our order there should have been more on the plate.

578885,2016-03-27,1,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"It was an average experience until I asked one of the bartenders what drink had just been made for some woman. 

""That's a Mai Tai"" she responded. ""How are they?"", I asked. ""Too sweet, I don't like sweet drinks"", she returned. ""Me neither"" I said, continuing to ask ""Do you know of any good sour drinks? I feel like something tart"". ""I don't like sour drinks either"" is what I got back.

So I guess the customer isn't allowed to have subjective taste, because she definitely wasn't going to ask one of the other bartender's, though she was fine with making the other woman a Mai Tai. 

After several minutes of being ignored, I ordered a shot of tequila, only to watch her serve six plastic cups of beer to other people as they came and ordered them before I went to another bartender and cashed out.

My issue is with the food which is Denny's quality but with strip prices. 

The wait time for said Denny's quality grub (nothing against Denny's btw), which was close to 45mins.

Maybe I wasn't paying close attention to my tab but I have been at far more established places and don't remember paying as much for drinks, again very costly. 

Bar staff were uninterested, maybe I wasn't attractive enough for them which I gathered was the motivation of interest for them given the pattern of service they provided. 
I happen to think I'm a solid 6.5 ;) 

I enjoy trying new places and experiencing the best Vegas has to offer. 

Happily though I won't be returning to this place. 
It made me sad to see some of the nice girls with so much personality waste there talents in this establishment. 

I would say I wish tilted kilt all the best in the future but that would be a lie.

Staff:  loved the staff. We sat at the bar and chatted up three different bartenders.  And were checked on by two others. One of the bartenders even photo bombed my drink pic.  LOL. 

But the thing that I really appreciated, when we first arrived my wife asked the hostess if they had any ciders.  The hostess asked if my wife was gluten free.  She is.  She was diagnosed with severe gluten allergies earlier this year.  The hostess told my wife they had gluten free beer.  Awesome.

Atmosphere:  was good.  Loved the decor.  I love Irish pubs.  This felt removed from the Vegas glitz, even though it obviously was still part of it.  But, it still had that homey feel I like in pubs.  And I loved the mix the DJ was playing.

Prices were par for Vegas, high for home.  But I can't mark them down for charging to pay the bills.

Now, if corporate reads this, please open one is Pasadena, CA.  It's rare to find a chain that feels like a local pub.",RRm8FTYMRgi03pxS3FJC1w,4,1,4,zhN5mYIWR9puOeoslLu_qA

The food was sub par and the service was horrible from the start.
Girl seating us was not at all friendly or greeting. 
We waited approximately 8-10 min before being seen by our waitress.
Drinks went empty 2x and delay in food was 40-45 min for our burgers.
We had to go get utensils from another table on our own.
Wife ordered well done. The burger was closer to medium with alot of pink inside. The portion of fries was a McDonald's small at best. My burger was uneventful but not bad.
The elderly woman behind us had a drink spilled on her by the staff (accidents happen and the guy that spilled it was very apologetic) it soaked her, her purse and the table. The couple had to clean it up mostly by themselves as the staff had to take off to get napkins (approx 5 min)
I overheard the manager offer them a lousy 20% discount. The couple was just eager to leave.
The manager offered to remove my wife's burger from the tab (which about 90% of the burger remained uneaten) which is the reason for the second star.
It sounds like im just trying to trash the place but this was honestly our entire experience. 
I'd recommend both Hooters and Twin Peaks over this place if looking for similar atmosphere. 

The poor management completely dropped the ball with hiring this staff. Great location and concept but failed to deliver in every aspect of customer service.",aezvURrpV8c5odH6zl8Njw,0,0,2,T5fIUhUfmTlA0xlloHFW9Q

We ordered the sampler ($14) and it came with 4 boneless chix bites, 4 skinny mozzarella sticks, fried pickles and 1 tasteless pretzel bread. We weren't impressed as ive tasted better mozzarella sticks from the freezer section of Costco.  Lol. 

We decided to split an entree to save us both a disappointment and share in the misery. We got the BBQ pork Mac and cheese. It sounded good. Something you'd hear on diner, drives and dives. Well it wasn't very good. At all. BBQ sauce was sweet, pork was flavorless, the macaroni was chewy and the cheese sauce tasted like that cheese pack you get in the Kraft box. 

As a plus they have daily drink specials...tequila Tuesdays and so forth and two happy hours. Server was nice, but don't expect service that excels. We didn't eat more than a few bites of the entree and the server didn't bother to ask why.

Sign outside says $5 drafts - night special, Tilted Kilt night.  Great, we say!  We'd love a happy hour draft on a hot day.

We walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites.

Bill comes, and we're charged $16.  What!?  I ask, he tells me the $5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry.  What does that even mean?  I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does.  I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not.

He says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you $10.  Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.  Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business.

Plenty of help on Saturday, not so much on Monday, Saturday also seemed to have all the seasoned help, Monday appeared to have all the new employees fumbling around. I liked the food and the portions were decent, not huge but enough to fill you up. Good location by the Linq, reasonable prices for the location and well kept as in clean, a big plus for the wife. 

If you are in the area on a weekend you should be able to get in and out quickly if you want, as I mentioned earlier Monday was a bit of a challenge. As there appeared to be just two waitress taking orders and at least ours didn't have time to check back with us to take our order, beyond our drinks and appetizers. One of the bussers finally got her attention for us and we were able to order our meal. Saturday everything flowed like a well oiled machine, no sooner than our appetizers were done and we were getting refills on our drinks along with our main course. 

Another big difference between the two nights, even though the crowd seemed to be about the same the volume level on Saturday was at a modest level, You could talk without having raise your voice, but Monday the music was considerably louder. 

All in all a decent meal at reasonable prices especially when you take into account the location, I would go back but I'll check to see how many servers they have working before taking a seat.",L6-_EsiHFy3a1K2kGOdm1g,0,0,4,n1L_0V9zgxVsrqxgsHA51w

I'm not to sure its a great place just to go for dinner, But if you are into sports that place is AWESOME.

With 30 beers on tap and plenty other in bottles, It also offers a full bar and TV's EVERYWHERE. I almost forgot the about the hottie serves walking around in red plaid mini skirts and a top to match. 
Back to dinner, I of coursed ordered the One Shot Johnny Shepherd's Pie. It came out at the right temp, So I didn't burn my mouth. It had the right amount of  of meet, potatoes and veggies inside. Usually the mashed potatoes over power the rest of the ingredients but not in this one. The bread that it came with was perfect. This shepherds pie ranked #2 out of my top 10 shepherd pie. 
My wife ordered the Sadie's Stuffed Breast, The chicken breast was nice and moist and had great flavor, It was stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon. Which added to how awesome it tasted. Such a great taste to your pallet. It also came with steamed broccoli, It was steamed to perfection. 
Next time that i'm in Vegas ill more then likely try something else on their menu.

Anyway, it is just a typical bar serving typical pub food.  Food was not bad, just nothing to write home about.  BF got the Boston Burger, asked for MR got MW to W.  He said the taste was good though.  I got the Irish Dip (French Dip) which tasted just like a French Dip I could order anywhere.  We did get the pretzels, which were good - soft and not too much salt, but the cheese dip left a lot to be desired.   With my water and his lemonade, the total bill tip and all was $50.  I can't imagine what it would be if we had ordered drinks.  I agree with what others say in that, yes, drink prices on the Strip are typically higher, but these were way out of line with the norm.

We came for lunch I wasn't too hungry so we ordered a few appetizers. From entering the restaurant to leaving I have to say one of the worst services I have ever experienced coming from the Las Vegas Strip. 

You can tell that the focus of this place is on the girls. Which is great put pretty girls in cute outfits and have their bubbly personalities serve guest. Clearly sex sells especially in Vegas. The idea is there but the execution isn't. Other than the fact that some of these girls look underage I have never encountered such horrible personalities. This isn't a night club and these girls are far away from those standards they shouldn't hold themselves so high up the podium acting like their better then everyone around them.

The hostess was clueless when I approached her looking for my party. I don't know if my server was sober or just not all there cause she would just stare at us without any reaction. Started to clear the table while we where still eating without excusing herself. The girls at the front where all busy gossiping while the ones by the bar gossiped as well. They kept glancing at our table then would talk amongst each other and stare again. Don't make it go obvious when your talking about someone. On our way out not one of the 3-4 hostesses at the podium took the time to welcome us back or even wish us a good day.

This team is so unprofessional they are to into themselves/their personal lives vs. serving their guest. It's actually sad cause this place has decent food, decent prices, decent atmosphere but service plays a big role in dining for me it's the overall experience that matters.

Our soup was ok. We ordered the beer cheese soup but it reminded my niece of queso dip. A little spicy, a thicker consistency but no real pizzaz. 
We decided to get the BBQ cheese burger and garlic Parmesan fries. It took a bit to come out and when it finally arrived the fries were undercooked and cold, the bun was as cold as the vegetables on the burger and the patty from just an external touch was tepid (at best). The server was quick to take it back and have it fixed. 
Two minutes later it comes out. I think WOW that's fast. How did they do that and my niece pointed out it was the same plate of food. Upon inspection, it was. The fries were put back in the fryer and the bun toasted (too much at this point, it was hard around the edges) and the same lukewarm patty all places back before me.
I summoned the manager. He explained he was sorry it was a mistake and would have it re-made an additional time. He emphasized everyone makes a mistake now and again. I readily agreed. I stated that when they brought out the food knowing it had been back there some time and was probably running on the cold side. When I returned it expecting a fresh hot meal and had a reheated variation of the original was returned to me.. That wasn't a MISTAKE.. It's dishonest. I kindly stated at that point unless he made it personally I didn't trust his kitchen with my food. He removed the burger off my bill and I paid for my beverage and soup.

I was thrilled because it is a wonderful sports bar with a great business model.  The servers are probably the friendliest I've encountered in a long time. Paula had no problem spending time with us and that made us feel right at home.  They also offered us a discount simply because we were locals (people who actually live in Vegas)..  We really did enjoy ourselves, that is, until the food came.  It would probably be no surprise to our friends to hear that we chose the fish and chips on the menu.  We've been looking for a good one since our favorite place for this item closed last year.  The fish was a beer-battered cod that the restaurant proudly claims is made with Sam Adams beer.  It is proudly displayed on the menu as a featured item.  We were very disappointed.  It looked great when it arrived in the basket with fries and onion rings on the side but, we quickly lost interest as we dug in.  The breading was quite doughy and flavorless.  it tasted like grease and when I took a fork and pressed into the fish, it oozed oil.  The same for the onion rings and fries.  Greasy as can be.  This tells me the oil was not hot enough when the food was dropped in.  Why can't these kitchens test the the temperature of oil before they dip anything into it?  Why doesn't a good  line cook or chef know that it takes time for a deep fryer to recover heat lost after frying a batch of battered fish?  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I expect too much but, I don't think so.  I grew up on the East Coast having fish and chips every Friday for most of my young life.  While in school, I worked at several restaurants that specialized in making fish and chips .. or a ""fish fry"" as we called them.  I guess I'll just have to keep looking for that elusive fish fry.

Then spilled someone else's drink all over my lap and in my purse- again without apologizing (now see I personally am not upset about the spilling, accidents happen.

I definitely would have been upset if I payed full price for the small portions. It's not difficult being a waitress, but the girl who served us seemed to not get it. Every table around us was waiting on something and trying to get her attention. She'd check on one table, leave then come back for another table, making her workload seem a lot more stressful than if she would have just checked on every table at the same time. I asked her for waters for both myself and my friend and she took my glass then came back and asked my friend if she needed some. Apparently she could only do one thing at a time. Was more annoying than fun. Go to Twin Peaks around the corner instead, hot staff, better food and better service.",5whDuPioWXFJc727fPPeaA,0,0,2,wue6-yLG6D-HlC2IHHJvmg
2485309,2016-02-14,2,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"Having been to maybe 6-8 locations as a basis for comparison, I was truly disappointed with this one.

I come to TK for the food, the atmosphere, and the craft beer. Without any of these three things, it's just any old place to eat. 

This is a great location with great foot traffic, dragged down by no craft beer, and a bored staff.

In the city known for its endless supply of beautiful women, TK managed to not hire a single one of them.

Many locations pride themselves on their connection to local craft breweries offering some of the best beers from local suppliers. I like to come to TKs then I travel to try the local beers in the lovely TK environment. This location missed this opportunity completely.

With two strikes against them, all that's left is the food. It was fine. Nothing extraordinary but fine.

As much as I really wanted to have a good time and enjoy this location; it wasn't possible given it's obvious shortcomings.

I can't recommend this location. Try harder and I might try it again the next time I am in town.",8s4D5BAyS_hloo8sxx7sCQ,2,0,1,WXQCiO_YwO2fNRO-B6Hl0Q

I've tried their fish tacos and now their chicken wings with chips and salsa. We ordered a side of their beer cheese sauce that pairs well with Chips, French fries or pretzel sticks.
It's definitely a sports bar kind of place so it can get pretty noisy but if you're interested in watching sports while you eat they have them all over the restaurant so you'll have a good view for that.

Our waitress was pretty prompt and on it. We ordered wings as an appetizer with Mango Habenero and Buffalo sauces. The Buffalo was nice and spicy but Mango wasn't as spicy, still good flavor though. The chicken was nice and crispy. I'd definitely order the wings again. I ordered a club sandwich, which was cooked well and I liked it all but I wish it has just a hint more flavor of some kind. The fries were basic but good. My boyfriend got the wicked Boston burger and he said it was perfectly cooked except the bacon was not cooked as much as he would normally like.

3215542,2015-08-18,2,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"Visited Tilted Kilt on a Friday night, around 9pm.  I expected it to be a lot like Twin Peaks.  The decor and girls in uniform were what i expected.  What I did not expect, however, was the loud blaring music coming from the DJ booth.  I'm not sure if all Tilted Kilts have a DJ on the weekends or it was because it was a Friday in Las Vegas at the Linq, but I was not a fan.  Turn down the music and I'll turn up my rating.  In order to talk to someone, you were basically shouting at each other.  Another annoyance was the fact that the restroom was located upstairs!!  How inconvenient is that??!!  

Looking over the menu, all of the food was very reasonably priced, especially considering their location.  I ordered an Irish Dip which was their version of a prime rib dip for a mere $11 which came with a choice of chips, fries, or onion rings.  The onion rings were huge and plentiful.  The Irish dip, however, was on the smaller side.  Portion size aside, the thin slices of prime rib were delicious and their au jus was quite flavorful.  If you are a big eater or even just on the hungry side, I'd definitely suggest ordering an appetizer or a dessert.  Overall, the menu at Tilted Kilt looked pretty good.  There are a lot more dining options here than there are at Twin Peaks.  

I didn't really go over the drink menu very carefully, just asked if they had any house brews.  Our waitresses informed us that they didn't have their own microbrew, but Killian's Irish Red was their house beer.  I'm a fan of Killian's so i had a pint.  

I'd definitely go back and give this place another shot.  But if the music is blasting as it was on Friday, I'm skipping this place and going to Yard House.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,3,2,3,WsQZwPaD98BkVqC3KgMttQ

I truly wasn't impressed.  We sat down and the whole experience was rushed.  The server kept coming to our table too quickly and only half of us were ready to order.  

We ordered a few beers and I had an ancho chile margarita.  Our server didn't fill my water glass once and I drink a lot of water.  

We then ordered.  I got the Fried Egg Burger with a side of the Mac & Chz, 2 others got black bean burgers, and we all shared the sampler to start.  The sampler took forever to come out.  It was truly mediocre at best.  It was a bunch of over fried stuff.  When our food came out the Mac & chz was not hot at all.  I will say, the server was nice and got us a new one.  

I couldn't tell if it was her fault or if they had her working too many tables but she was just all over the place and seemed to have too many people to take care of.

We ordered grilled wings with half the order guiness bbq, the other half TK sauce along with a salad adding grilled chicken.

The windows were open, and it was hot, so do not expect to escape the heat. I am sure they have some kind of air on, we were both warm.

It doesn't bother me that much tbh but prettt sure it bothers 90% of your male customers. It's cool when a guy ask you if you want water and stuff but we would rather take our drink orders from a hot chick. That's the main reason were here lol.

Getting straight to the important stuff.

We ordered:
-Classic traditional wings w/garlic fries
-Sweet potato fries
-Spinach Chicken Salad
-SpicySouthwest Chicken Wrap w/colelsaw 
-BBQ Chicken pizza

The wings were good and I liked that they were saucey but not to the point that they were drowning in it.  It came with celery and ranch but no carrots :(  The garlic fries it came out with though, sooooo damn good and garlic-y! YUM.  They were seriously like the definition of perfection and I seriously could not stop eating them.   

Sweet potato fries were also really good.  They were definitely different from how they are usually served as they were crinkle cut fries and I really appreciated that they weren't soggy or super soft like how crinkle cut fries usually are.  It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  Perfect when dipped in ranch or ketchup.

My friends ordered the Spinach Chicken Salad to share which came with a citrus mustard vinagarette dressing that was really unique but tasty.  The salad consisted of fresh spinach, grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, chopped bacon, dried cranberries and bleu cheese crumbles.  Everything paired very well with each other and it is definitely a salad I'd recommend ordering.

My boyfriend and I shared the Spicy Southwest Chicken wrap again because thats his favorite thing at Tilted Kilt.  It was consistent with my first time trying it and a dish I'd still recommend to others.  It's light but filling!  I really appreciate the fact that they use just the right amount of dressing in the wrap and consisted of a good ratio of salad to chicken. The wrap also comes with your choice of fries, potato chips or coleslaw.  We opted for the coleslaw since we already had 2 baskets of fries.  It's a small portion of coleslaw but I didn't mind since I was already getting full from the other stuff.

The BBQ chicken pizza was your standard BBQ chicken pizza.  Nothing stood out about it but it wasn't bad; it was just average.  Nothing much to say about it.

The service this time was better than last as all the girls working greeted us upon entering and our server made sure to check up on us from time to time.  The food however, did take quite awhile to come out but it was understandable since we were here during the Fight Weekend and it was much more busier than usual.",dR_rEskmBSyY3AuI-84dUQ,4,3,4,so7Iv1gycH2oBgyzkAxB_Q

4132196,2015-05-22,6,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"Really, honestly, bad. 

I literally dropped in 12 months ago, about the time they opened the establishment. It was kinda of lacking in many ways but service was good enough. This time I sat at the bar and ordered a cocktail and a turkey burger. Nothing about the situation was quality. I won't even go into the cocktail issues as really it was just the bartender not listening. I drank it.. Lol.

I ordered the turkey burger while sitting at the bar in an attempt to keep it lighter. The turkey burger was meant to have guacamole on it .. Which it did .. barely.. But as it was literally 24min from order to delivery of the food - I didn't complain. 

The burger was boring. I know turkey burgers don't always get the best reviews overall - but there is no reason they should taste literally like cardboard. Especially in this day and age of over-priced, extremely casual dinner fare. You can at least have it not taste bad. I didn't eat it. It was not good. I ordered them with potato chips which were over cooked and cardboard like as well. When he basket was picked up eventually, it was without question of why it was over half  un-eaten.

In addition, I was asked to pay for my food before it arrived, which I found odd. I was informed that I needed to give a credit card if I wanted to eat at the bar. I reluctantly gave a card and requested that it not be charged because I wanted to pay cash. I was then told - ""anytime you eat at a bar in Vegas, you are required to pay up front."" I was like ... what? Hahah. 

After that - the bartender never checked on me once, as he was constantly talking with his friends and juggling bottles. All of that is fine - if you can give proper service. Otherwise .. Please focus on your guests.

I asked for the check - and I waited literally 18 minutes to receive the check - which the bartender charged to my credit card after I once again, asked him to allow me to pay cash. He took off and didn't even give me a pen. I went to the hostess stand and asked the manager there for a pen. 

I mean it was just not a good situation and I have no reason to go back. If it weren't truly bad I wouldn't go this far as to be so descriptive - but it was that bad. I'm a believer in allowing a situation to be fixed - but I had little opportunity and I just wanted out of there. Better luck to you if you decide to check it out.

We were seated right away. The host were standard. Not super friendly and energetic like we prefer. They kind of just went through the motions, but at least they smiled.

Our server was nice, but pretty mono tone like the host. The restaurant was pretty slow, so they were probably just bored lol. Anywho, we ordered the Nachos, and pre game pickles. We only got the pickles because they were free if you add your email to their email list. I'm glad we got the pickles though because they tasted pretty good. The nachos tasted like pure grease, and the meat on them was blah. For our entrees we order a half rack of ribs, kids mac n cheese & the fish N chips. I didn't see ONE salad option on the menu, which was disappointing. I mentioned that to my husband later, and he said he did see 1 salad, but only 1, so it was probably a plain house salad. Anywho, back to the food. My husband really enjoyed his ribs. He said the sauce was great, and that the half rack was plenty. The kids mac n cheese was a great size. My fish N Chips was disappointing since I was really craving a tasty flavorful batter around some fish, but the batter tasted like the nacho chips, just like grease. It didn't have any flavor, no seasoning, salt, nothing. Grease.

I must say the red Sangria was fantastic. I am not much of a drinker, so many times I end up leaving most of my drinks pretty full because the alcohol is just yuck to me. Nope, not today. It was sooooo good. I was giving 3 stars, but decided to make it 4 only because the Red Sangria was great.

I've been here an unfortunate two times while visiting the LINQ. The first time I went with a few girlfriends to grab dinner and drinks. The food took a long time to come out (over 45 minutes) and when it finally did, the wings I ordered were cold. I let the server know and she took the wings back. I think they popped the entire thing in the microwave because it came out looking the same and luke warm instead of cold. I wasn't happy about it and they were accommodating enough to take it off of our bill. I was still hungry but had no desire to order something else off of their menu.

The second time I sat at the bar for drinks. I went with a few others and we each ordered a beer right away. It was super odd because after we ordered, the bartender said he closed us out and gave us all our individual bills. Like he was worried we wouldn't pay? Usually a bartender would ask if we want to start a tab or close out and pay for the drink. I don't know why this annoyed me but it did. I also literally watched a cockroach scurry across the floor which was incredibly disturbing and speaks volume on the cleanliness of the restaurant.

I will not be back. Not sure why I even went back after the first time. It's conveniently located if you want to bar hop at the LINQ but I definitely think you should find elsewhere. Try Yardhouse over by the high roller.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,4,0,1,hDx6FJ9Y7760Vee12e5Rhg

The service was super slow, I just wanted to see that bill come out and leave.

I came here with my friends for Happy Hour, and we almost ordered the entire Happy Hour menu! I think we might have. We were initially skeptical about the Buffalo Chips because it's just potato chips with a buffalo chicken dip, but our server highly recommended that, so we got it. Lucky we did because the dip was very, very tasty and delicious. We ended up dipping all our other stuff in that dip. Sadly, that was the best part of the meal.

The Boneless Wings weren't very good. It was prepared poorly with the batter all over the place and not even fully on the chicken, and it was bland and overcooked. Pretty disappointing.

We ordered the Sliders, which was a total rip-off. $4 for ONE little slider that looked like a hamburger from McDonalds, but even smaller and more flat? No thank you. There was barely any meat inside the two flattened buns that's just pulled out of the plastic bag to even care to type out any description.

I can throw in the steak skewers in the same category as the sliders. It was so bad that I shouldn't waste my time typing it out. All I need to say was that the beef was bland and way overcooked. Just awful.

The fried mozzarella were soft and mushy, not crispy at all. The cheese is already soft and mushy, so having the batter the same way isn't very good.

We ordered a couple of those Spring rolls, which I didn't eat, but my friends did not like it what-so-ever, and it was a rip-off as well.

The fries were pretty good though. Nicely fried to a crisp and well-seasoned.

The service was okay. When the server was at our table, she was friendly and helpful, but that's only when she was at out table, which was not often.

Overall, I didn't care much about the food that was overpriced and poorly portioned, especially for a Happy Hour. The service was friendly, but lacked attentiveness. I don't plan to return here on my next visit. Sorry, those short skirts, crop tops, and push up bras with cleavage hanging out won't make me come back.

One of our orders was the Shepherd's Pie, which looked nothing like the photo in the menu nor any of the photos people have posted on Yelp. The server again explained it had something to do with the updated menu. If they're going to update a menu, the least they could do is update the photo and price accordingly. It was in a shallow mini cast iron skillet about an inch tall, filled halfway up, and about 5-6"" in diameter. My bf doesn't ever want to complain about his food so I didn't embarrass him by taking a photo of it, but it was the saddest Shepherd's Pie I had ever seen. He was still hungry after taking his 6 bites of food, and all the server could offer is ask if we wanted to order more food. No, not after spending $14.00 on this. 

We expressed our dismay but she didn't seem concerned at all, didn't offer to call a manager over. In fact, the manager didn't come to our table to verify our discount as shown in our phone app. The server wanted to take our phone away to bring it to the manager. Never, ever, take a customer's unlocked phone. Our server was full of smiles, but smiling cutely at disappointed customers does not make good service. It was a pretty dismal dinner and we don't plan on returning. Too bad Tilted Kilt -- you have great potential in a great location.

It was not crowded at all when we went, so the service was very attentive.  My husband ordered the Fat Bastard Mac and Cheese, and I ordered the Irish Dip sandwhich.  My husband loved the Mac and cheese, and said it tasted like fetucinni Alfredo but with macaroni and buffalo chicken (he loves Alfredo so that's a good thing).  The sandwhich was very tasty.  The bread was fresh and the meat was tender and seasoned well.  Prices were a little on the high side for what it was, but compared to some other places on and near the strip, we considered it fairly reasonable.  

We were in Vegas celebrating my birthday.  At the end of our meal, our waitress brought us a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream that was divine!  Out of all the establishments we visited during the three and a half days we were in Vegas, including a rather expensive restaurant that we ate at later that evening where it was noted when we made the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, the Tikted Kilt was the ONLY one that did anything special for my birthday (except for Sprinkles, where I got a lovely complimentary cupcake, but it was because I had signed up for their rewards program and had a coupon).  The expensive place we went to for dinner didn't even ask us if we were celebrating anything special (despite the fact that it was noted on the reservation) or so much as wish me a happy birthday.

The place is pretty nice, very big and is open to the promenade so you can enjoy the fresh air and do some people watching. Lots of TV's for catching the latest sports. And of course, the waitresses are nice to look at. 

The bad part is the beer selection and the food. They have a ton of beers, but it's all the standard large brewery (12 variations of Budweiser, Coors, Miller, etc) stuff. Lagunitas' IPA was the most extreme on the menu. That's not a show stopper, because hey, I like me some Lagunitas, but the food was sad. We ordered some fried pickles to start and we got a tiny portion of pickles, spread out over the plate really thin in an apparent attempt to make it look like a normal sized order. It was like that's all that was left and they didn't want to drop more into the fryer. Pathetic. We decided not to order anything else. We split and went to eat somewhere else.

The area is small (with high chairs) and a very loud band that blasts ear-splitting music (nice selection of music, they take requests, and encourage patrons to dance) that make conversing (unless you enjoy yelling into each other's ears) futile.  

As for the food - I hated my fish and chips.  They were greasy and often fell apart or became mush when trying to dip them into sauce.  The ""chips"" (shoestring fries) were glued together due to the congealed grease.  My wife however had the Irish Dip (shaved rib eye with au jus) sandwich which she liked.  

Service was attentive and attractive.  The waitress came often checking in on our drinks, although food delivery was a bit long, about a 20-25 minute wait.  There is a second story that houses small tables and a bathroom attendant scourging for tips.  

We visited Tilted Kilt on a Tuesday around 7pm and were seated at a table without wait (they are on OpenTable).  Prices were $$, a nice find especially on The Strip.  Even though I disliked the food it was nice to find a place that advertised a ""Pub Fare Menu"" that actually had Pub Fare prices.  

Tilted Kilt advertises itself as a ""Celtic-themed environment"" which to me sounds like they couldn't call themselves an Irish Pub along the lines of Nine Fine Irishmen (NYNY) or Ri Ra (Mandalay Bay) especially since O'Shea's is right down the Linq's promenade.

Once we finally ordered our food, we waited. And waited. And waited. While we watched all of the tables around us get their meals... and send them back to the kitchen because they were wrong. The table directly beside us received half of their tables food while the other half had to wait because the kitchen ""must have forgotten the order."" We were still waiting when the waitress brought out the other two meals, which the couple promptly discovered were not even cooked all the way through. The man ordered a well done burger and when he cut it in half it bled like he was cutting into a live cow, while the woman complained that her fries were still frozen. It really excited me to finally receive my food. When I saw it coming, I was just happy it was finally arriving. That was about it that excited me about this meal. My chicken sandwich was placed in front of me and the chicken was so over cooked it felt like plastic. The fries weren't cooked. My friend's burger was so undercooked I think I actually heard it moo. And my other friends French dip wasn't a French dip at all. The waitress brought out a steak sub with peppers and onions. When the waitress came over to us she said ""what's wrong"" and we promptly told her we would like to speak to a manager. Which we had to wait to do, because she was busy comping three other tables meals due to the incompetent kitchen and rude waitress. When she finally came over, the waitress also had the French dip with her and when she placed it down she said ""I was confused because you said steak."" No apology. No remorse.

The server didn't really know much about the prices of drinks or the specials of the night...like we knew more about the specials because they were posted outside of the door. I just got a cheeseburger and there was nothing spectacular about it. Prices are decent though if you want a quick bite to eat before a show.",bJhvtW536XsQSm2L1EaYWQ,0,0,3,YHnXdiHDgXmoDn3fsRALbg

With the premise being a classier version of Hooter's, how can you go wrong?  The occasion finally comes in the form of a bachelor party, as a few of my friends from Chicago make their way to Vegas for their own version of Hangover.  

We meet up at Caesar's and cross the street to the Linq, and they're impressed with the short strip of entertainment.  We wait just a bit (10 minutes or so) for a table, and get seated by one of the girls.  Positives:  Girls are really nice, from the hosts up front to our server.  There are TVs everywhere for the games, and every spot is a good spot for watching.  Food comes fast, and they are pretty good - wings, flatbreads, and garlic fries.  The have Smithwick's on tap!  Negatives:  Girls don't quite reach our expectations from physical-standpoint, and are not as social as Hooter's.  Food is only pretty good, not great.  They don't have Boddington's, or at least our server didn't know what it was so I assume they don't.  

While we had light fare this evening, we did drink and it only came out to about $30 each including tips.  This indeed is couple notches above Hooter's, and to me a more enjoyable place to watch the games because of their much more diverse food and drink options.  If it wasn't so far from my house (and if it wasn't in the middle of the strip), I'd probably come here more often.  3.5 stars overall I think, but since I can't give that and I'm still on the fence about it, I'll bump it down.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Large bar, but do you really want to sit here by yourself?",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,0,0,3,Sy2A_ralQbHAOO7AO_2ivA
5774163,2016-07-13,3,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"Ah the Tilted Kilt. Met a friend here Thursday evening around 530pm for a quick beer before heading out for the night. My memories of Tilted Kilt were mostly about the hot beautiful ladies serving and bartending, so I was quite shocked to see a guy bartending on this particular evening. No offense to him, he was a very good bartender and knowledgeable on beers, but I can find that at hundreds of other places in town. I wanted to see cute girls!!!!

The 3 stars is because their selection of beverages, while eclectic, is pretty routine and lacks a good Hefeweizen. I had the Joseph James local one, and it was lacking for my taste buds with a bit too much hoppiness.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,2,3,VP41gU3ESu95apEUA_ET3Q

Average bar food, decent service, but LOTS of tvs. Worth going to if you want to watch sports and get some food, and take a break from the losing tables and slots.",q_IMsW8_z54AgdVnzCWtlA,0,0,3,i8xY0gV7nzqkBbE6l0Wgog
5950345,2015-04-21,0,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,"The food and atmosphere is good.  Mostly men eating and drinking when we wandered in off the Linq promenade.  Waitresses are in very pert kilt and midriff baring tops.  

Overall I would give this place a 4 star, but our waitress sent it over the top. Piper our waitress was amazing.  Funny, articulate, attentive. My French dip sandwich was kind of slopped onto the table, dousing the sandwich and onion rings.  When Piper stopped by and I told her, she immediately had my meal replaced.

I have been to the Tilted Kilt in San Diego as well.  It's a solid restaurant. I would definitely eat here again.",PTmxRprtkgMtDTuHqb-7-A,0,0,4,qy140qktkvFTr1FG3KzPrQ

Odd that I'm much taller and older then little miss hostess, I see numerous empty tables. 
Great thing about Vegas, go across the way and spend your money at Virgil's BBQ!!  Much better food, too bad that the hostess Kilt blocked a sale during playoff hockey season, and maybe for the rest of my week.
Surprisingly my food came before I was even done writing this review!! 
Bye bye Tilted Kilt Las Vegas!!",5dchjtl4jULa55BFAsds3g,0,0,2,8ucTCHRrKXXW0gGwniUw9Q
5958792,2016-10-25,0,5_MrPFw9E0cMJ1Q0DJFZOQ,The breakfast here was not worth it. I mean it was cheap! but still not worth the cheap prices! the menu is very limited. The server was cute and everything but she wasn't very aware of what could or could not be done (for instance I asked for onions in my potatoes and she had to check to see if I could do that lol) the food came out lukewarm at best and it was just nothing to go crazy over.,JfP5MMbusELFFL7JF_TiOA,0,0,1,TevDCF2D2iWUbPY6VCixPQ
