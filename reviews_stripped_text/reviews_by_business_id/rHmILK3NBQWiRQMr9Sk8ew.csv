The bartenders are friendly and know how to make pretty much anything. They're also kinda hot with those leather vests.",fMdDLlybOYPheFpq5QQLfw,1,0,4,lCqwk3jeHVk2NpC61B3T2w

1258053,2013-01-14,0,rHmILK3NBQWiRQMr9Sk8ew,"This place is a solid bar-staple in Las Vegas.  My understanding is that there are 54 locations in town, all of them 24 hours with happy hour from 4-7p.m. and again from midnight till 3.    Happy hour equals half-off ALL drinks and giant pizzas with your choice of toppings.  
The bartenders are usually friendly and efficient.  It's always smoky---yes they could use more ventilation, but so could every bar.  Pool tables, a few arcade games, megatouch, and of course video poker, ensure that something can always keep your fingers busy at PT's.",h5bp8gnhYGF23GIlvMyQ1A,2,0,4,tnGI0NIcXr5MKIIyuEfRzQ

It's nice to come relax here and watch baseball in the lounge. Watched the nba finals too. Solid TV coverage. The artwork of women in full desert rock regalia just amazes me. Love it here.",B3T9gFiY3UN9YbpahMU35w,0,1,5,AUaGkmPHcbeG8Ea9m_brxg

There is a Roberto's connected for those who want to cap off dive bar with dive Mexican. Not a place I'd hang out all night but a good hit & run, service with a smile.

3431901,2016-02-28,0,rHmILK3NBQWiRQMr9Sk8ew,"My favorite local bar, w my favorite local bartender Candace.  I'm  not usually a yelper but as someone who is there A LOT! ( probably too much ;)) I need to give credit where credit is due. I witnessed some patrons arguing w Candace for over 1/2 hr about how they shouldn't have to pay their tab when they put money in a machine so it should be comped. First off, Anyone who plays knows it's pretty common to play at least a $20 for a comp. This patron was trying to scam the bar by putting in a 20 getting a drink and cashing out. Candace was a total professional about it as She calmly and nicely explained the policy over and over to the people who were very rude and clearly just out to not pay their tab. Im not sure I've seen anyone be so patient. I was super impressed how well she handled the situation and will continue to come there for her awesome service.

4314968,2018-03-15,0,rHmILK3NBQWiRQMr9Sk8ew,"We were in search of some bar food, a beer, and a nice game of pool on our day off. We got exactly that at this nice little PT's on Monday evening. The waitress was sweet and professional. The food was spot on. The Perfect grilled cheese. My husband had the fish & chips which was great too. We didn't gamble this time but there must've been some action because we heard some ding dinging behind the bar. My only minor complaint would be that there are about a Dozen Photos of Half Naked Girls on the walls making the place feel like - I don't know - the inside of a boys bedroom! I got that uneasy feeling you get when you walk into your creepy neighbors house and he's got a trashy calendar on his wall and you feel kind of objectified and unsafe. Not surprisingly, there weren't any other women around gambling or eating or playing pool. My husband and I had a laugh about it. Overall, we still had a great time.

This one actually doesn't serve food, which really sucks. I like getting chicken wings with my beers, but these guys send you to the Roberto's next door to get food. That kinda sucks bc Roberto's doesn't equal wings/burgers/bar food. 

The drinks here are ok, though nothing to get excited about. 

I'll prob return here, but mostly bc it's close to people's houses.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,7,1,3,yRoOSdc8plpLI8v5hPaNBg

5108631,2017-01-17,1,rHmILK3NBQWiRQMr9Sk8ew,"I'm guessing the four star rating is because this is a great place to go for a drink in between making batches of meth. 

For anything else I don't see the appeal. There was one bartender/server and one person in the kitchen on Saturday afternoon and it took two hours to get any food. The bartender/server was slurring her words and took orders three different times and still didn't get it right.

Food was ok but not anything special or fresh and not worth the wait. There was ""something wrong"" with the Blue Moon keg. 

While you are waiting you get to experience the wonderful clientele and have your clothes absorb the ash tray smell of the inside. 

At least it's cheap and if you are lucky at the slot machines inside you can pay for your food/drinks.",ds67i6Ky7jv7FkzRrnwyUg,1,0,1,67N4b90xT7EDUABR9HMiHg
5220131,2016-02-29,0,rHmILK3NBQWiRQMr9Sk8ew,"This is probably my all time favorite bar since relocating to vegas....it's not because of the music or decor, or the big screens or cozy atmosphere. What makes a great establishment is the staff and patrons. Since the first early morning I walked in a bartender named Candace made me comfortable, at ease and ready to grow another long term patron in me. She is funny, professional and knows the perfect balance of checking on me and my needs. Over the years I have watched her with many other patrons and find that she offers the same upstanding service to them. On a few occasions I have witnessed situations with unruly people. She handled them professionally and swiftly as an experienced bartender should. That's when I realized a bartenders true job is to continue to offer the style of atmosphere in which her established long term patrons are accustomed too and grow that base. It's not to allow disrespectful, scamming, free willing antagonist to disrupt everyone else's good time. I hope Pts on lake mead and rampart will be around for years to come! They r a true beating heart for the locals of Las Vegas!!!",7aQ_I69fooCfYYy_PAVAwQ,1,0,5,TZ_n5nbIAq5xJZJq0jFF4w
