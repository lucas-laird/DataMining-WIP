We came to go eat lunch.. it took 30 minutes to seat us when they weren't even busy at all. Rude hostess. One of our orders came out wrong and the waitress blamed it on my friend saying she didn't say what she ordered, unprofessional? I think so. Don't fight with the customer. 

The only thing I thought was good were the onion rings and my steamed vegetables. We all tried eachothers food, THUMBS DOWN. The grilled chicken was the driest piece of .... i've ever had, even if I put sauce with it.. I couldn't finish my meal. The chicken tenders had weird after tastes, and the eggs tasted different.. basically everything tasted different considering that it doesn't taste the way it should.. all processed junk with no quality.

I was right.

Homegirl and I wanted some Hooters wings, but upon seeing the line that literally went out the door and around the corner, we knew we weren't having them. Plan B was this place. She gave me advance notice about their jalapeno corn muffins with honey butter. I've had a few good corn muffins, but this one blows them all out of the water. The jalapeno didn't give too much heat, and the butter complimented the muffin nicely. Actually, I wouldn't have had a problem devouring the butter by itself. It was that good! For the main course, I was about to get their chicken sandwich until I flipped over the menu and saw that their prime rib was $9.95. That's a freakin' steal! I ordered it without any hesitation. It was juicy and tender--the way prime rib should be every time. Their horseradish sauce wasn't as potent as the ones I've tried from other places, so I nearly drenched every bite in it. The food deserves the 4 stars. The service on the other hand is between 2-3. There wasn't anyone at the entrance to welcome us, so we literally walked ourselves in.

It was good enough that I ate my whole family's too. The prime rib had about 1/4 fat. It wasn't as chewable and enjoyable as other prime rib. It wasn't even worth the $9 that we paid for it.

The mashed potatoes were pretty good. They had the right amount of garlic, complimented the prime rib.

The service is another mystery in itself. There was 1 server for the whole restaurant. There were times that we had to ask the food runner for refills and condiments. We sat in a booth that was unique. It sunk like a bucket seat so my face was pretty close to the table top and getting out is a pain, but otherwise it's a decent seat.

This place could really be much more if Hooters invested time and money into this place. Get some decent food and the advertisements will bring flocks of people.",owRJSf6XpxG0d9vBl04uAQ,0,0,2,PwgjheQyU1LiJPyKGIXb_Q

You can choose from breaded or naked with mild, hot, bbq, or 911.  Breaded is good but I think naked is much better.  And I like spicy food so I get Hot.  I don't like 911 because the sauce was really powdery.

Ok I had to get their ""9-1-1"" wings first cause if it's hot then I have to try and stomach that first before trying anything else. The sauce was more of a vinegary salsa that the wings were dipped in, albeit was really hot, it wasn't very appetizing, but if you're looking for hot, get 6 wings in and see how your mouth feels (inside and out!) and don't rub your eyes.

The BBQ sauce was much better, sweet and savory. I also stole off my friends plate a couple of the ""hot"" wings and I think I'd prefer the wings plane with some ranch (which costs as much as 4 wings) to dip them in.

I mean for the price you can't complain, $2.50 for a plate of wings isn't bad. But you have to remember that it's from midnight to 6AM, I only was able to take advantage of this because I had work till 11:30P.....

And in the end I found out my friends had had an under the table bet to find out how many wings I could off...... it was 28....... I could have done 40.

We decided to drive to Las Vegas in the middle of the night instead of waiting until the morning as we originally planned. We had planned on staying in a cheap room in Primm, but at the last second decided to stay at Hooters since we figured we'd be hungry upon arrival at 3AM and the 25 cent wings sounded like a good idea.

We hit up Marino's immediately after dropping our stuff off in the room. My friend had the prime rib special and 10 BBQ wings and my other friend ordered 30 wings (20 medium and 10 BBQ). I ordered 20 BBQ wings and a cup of Dan's chili. Out of the 40 BBQ wings ordered between the 3 of us, about 18 were actually eaten. That's over half the wings that went uneaten. They were so over-sauced and the sauce was so strong that they were almost inedible. I only ate 9 myself. My friend shared his medium wings with me and they were at least edible without having to scrape off the sauce with a fork. Actually, the medium wings were did not have enough sauce. Some of them actually had no sauce whatsoever on them. Luckily, between those, the few BBQ wings I did manage to eat before giving up, and the cup of chili I managed to satiate my hunger. The chili was OK. Nothing special at all. I honestly have no idea what was wrong with the chef that night. I eat Hooters wings all the time and they are not like this. I think a starving guy at 3AM only managing to eat 9 of the 20 wings he ordered says a lot.

Service was OK. It was not very busy. A lot of people ordered food and then immediately asked for a box. They do not allow you to order take out, so people just used this method.",DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw,1,1,1,Ir1dIBre1vZ_Rmdg1e964w

The boyfriend, some friends, and I went here on a friday night. 

We waited about 20 minutes to get a pager, and waited another 30 minutes until the pager went off and were seated.  Under that impression, we thought this place would be good.

We ordered mild, bbq, and ""9-1-1"" wings.

First the mild.
These are fried, greasy, chalky tasting, breaded wings, smothered in butter. No salt. No taste. Disgusting.

Second, the BBQ.
These were the same chalky, floury wings, barely touched with BBQ sauce. It doesn't take a magician to toss a pan of fried wings in sauce yknow.. they could've spent the extra 5 seconds tossing some more sauce so the wings were actually covered in it. Fail.

9-1-1
These brought tears to my friends eyes. The boyfriend, who can normally stomach anything hot, only ate 1. Our friend ate 3. They paid for it later in the bathroom.. lol

The only thing about this place that was positive was our waitress. She was so attentive and friendly. She was right there when our sodas/waters got low. And didn't take long at all when we asked for the bill. She was very awesome, and received a very nice tip from us.

2963857,2007-12-26,4,a2fqQVxtFGc-bjKQ3BXItA,"Here's an advice for late arrivals for hotels check-in: Please make sure you eat before you arrive to Las Vegas if you know you are going to arrive after 11pm. 

We just didn't know that most restaurants or buffets would close at 10pm on a Friday night. It was a bummer for me as we scrambled to see if the Las Vegas's 24/7 guide could bailed us out.

We were surprise to see that most places would closed by either 10pm or even earlier.Vegas never sleep my butt! We were down to either ESPN zone at New York New York hotel or Dan Marino's at Hooters hotel. Both were within walking distance from our hotel.

How's that for your first meal when you arrived in Vegas? Is it a sign of bad omen? All I know is....we should stop gambling if our luck was going to start out like that. We did lost a ton of chump change in Vegas because of a bad start like this.

We settled for the NFL Hall of Famer's restaurant because of the all-you-can-eat $16.99 Baby Back ribs special that was advertised. Alas, by the time we arrived to the place, the special was over as we came in slightly pass midnight. 

Again, it was bumming us out. Our luck was flushed down the toilet before it even started.

The restaurant itself wasn't that bad. The Hooters hotel looked a little shady and a bit run of the mill like an aging horse compares to the stallions look of the other new hotels.  It had some very modern slick look and the place still look immaculate clean as though it had just opened. 

However, with Dan the Man's restaurant, it look more polish with a stride to look like a chic place as a date spot. As it is, the place was misplaced in Hooter's hotel and should have been in Hard Rock hotel.

It's also weird because I was expecting a frat house bar stop like a Mike Ditka or an old hand me down Italian place like Tommy Lasorda's. I was a bit impressed on how the restaurant looked with their plushy booth seats. It was very comfortable and the table was not too squishy by being close to the seat. Most restaurants are small like that.

The menu was very limited by the time we got in. After mentioned, the baby back ribs special of AYCE was gone by midnight. I wound up grabbing their Bacon Cheeseburger with a side of fries.

The gourmet burger was huge with 1/2 pound worth of patties. It was nicely done. Too bad we missed out the regular dinner menu as I noticed on-line where they do serve many variety of pasta, steaks, and seafood dishes.

The service was actually surprisingly attentive. Most nightly 24 hour owl shift tend to be here and there, but with this place stepping up, I was able to get an bottomless ice tea.

Better than what I was expecting for a 24 hour place. Limited menu is a major blow, but it still better than any hotel's room service.

As for my companion's request that all waitress dressed like a Hooter's orange bottom outfit...I can't see it. Dan the Man would never allow it. However if Tony Romo ever decide to open one....you know he's hiring nothing but Blonde chicks!

Bet on it!

The 1st rack is huge and no we're not talking about the measly chicken ribs you'll find at the larger bbq chains (Outback I'm talking to you).  Each rib was struggling to hold onto its moist delicious meat.  I tore through the 1st rack and only got 3-4 ribs into the 2nd, which was a half rack before my gut called it quits and my wife rolled y across the street to our hotel.

Not to be forgotten were the delicious side orders.  I had the baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes both were fantastic.  Like the ribs, Marino's served up an endless supply. 

Lastly, the service was fantastic.

THE ORDER:

$9.95 PRIME RIB DINNER: 2 stars....Good overall VALUE, but the meat was not that good. The corn was waaaaaay over-steamed. The garlic mashed was OKAY, but lacked creaminess, the jalapeno corn bread was tasty....but yah...

$9.95 CHICKEN AND RIB DINNER: 2.5 stars....again, GREAT VALUE...this was better than the P.R. because of the varity...actually a nice lil slab of ribs...but they were much too sweet for my liking....but juicy...i think they were boiled before grilled. Chx breast was juicy....but had the same bbq sauce as the ribs....

Side Salads with Balsamic and BleuCheese: 3 stars...really good for the quality I was expecting...the dressings were good.

Some wine, some beer.....

THE SERVICE:
4.5 stars......REALLY GOOD!!! Very kind, warm, and knowledgable!

I Probably Won't Go Back.......but it wasnt HORRIBLE, just not that GOOD...

The hostess sat us quickly and guided us through the food and garbage scattered on the floor to the closest table to the kitchen. There is no door or anything else hiding the kitchen and the goings on in there. I noticed two tables filled with people next to me that had their menus closed. After about 15 minutes passed and no one bothered to take their orders they picked up and left. No employee that I noticed seemed to care. I grabbed a server and asked to go sit in the bar section. I figured the bartender would have more direct contact with the customers and I would be better served. I'm pretty sure I made the right choice. 

I ordered the BBQ chicken and ribs, which were good but not sure it was any better than any other BBQ joint in the world and a long stretch from fine dining. My coworker had the prime rib. For both of us the meat was good, the mashed potatoes horrible, corn on the cobb mushy and over cooked and they forgot the corn muffins.

Anyways - located inside the Hooters Hotel and Casino - and the menu is not that of a Hooters restaurant (they have one in the Casino already) although I have heard you can order Hooters stuff from the bar.

Anyways - ordering off the menu of this place is plenty for me!  The drinks and food were more then affordable and it was more then enough food to keep me going throughout the long night in Vegas.  With reasonably priced, decently portioned delicious food, how can you go wrong?  They also have a $17.99 all you can eat Rib special.  Now THAT is worth it!

4172861,2008-08-03,0,a2fqQVxtFGc-bjKQ3BXItA,"I wholeheartedly agree with most of the three-star reviews that have been given to this place.  I don't particularly care for the Miami Dolphins, and the only thing I truly know and love about Dan Marino is his infamous role on the first Ace Ventura movie.  Other than that, three stars for the general experience.

Soooo...  why five stars then?  Great question!

After midnight wings are 25 cents a piece...  and although you can't be insane like me and want to order an odd number, like 7 or whatever, you cannot beat 20 big, crispy, buttery, hot, saucy wings (20 wings medium for brother, 20 hot wings for me) that withstood another day so we could snack on leftovers in our room over @ the Trop.

We got a side salad to *start* with which was a reasonable price, and had really delicious honey mustard dressing.

Although our servers weren't in Hooters gear, trust me, that's alright for here.  The *decor* seems to indicate that DM's is a more high-caliber (if you will) establishment than the Hooters restaurant across the way, so it's cool that the people working the floor are dressed as such.  Lots of pretty plasma TVs playing sports stuff (okay, maybe just variations of the ESPN channels, but that's ok with me -- I sleep with ESPN on my tv) and my Heineken was only 5 bucks (I know -- it's free outside, ok, so I suck -- but I needed it to wash down the wing goodness!).

Let's get our math together here:  40 wings, salad, beer = around $20.

Minus 0.5 star for the effed up long ass wait...  Well, the hostesses said 45 minutes to an hour and it actually turned out to be more like 20 minutes.  So okay, put that 0.5 back up then!  We spent the time at a fun blackjack table anyway...

Bottom line:  quick and friendly service, cheap (and FRESH) wings, decent prices for most other food items (sorry everybody I guess this review is only for the wing special...  but it's still worth it if you luuuurve Hooters wings like I do!), and worth checking out! ...  Although prior to this, I did check out the Hooters Casino and Hotel reviews, and I think they are rather sad...  which I DO understand...  so I hope people come on over to check out DM's!",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,0,0,5,sNgNeMrfFms9gwjl009PAA

That's right.

Normally, that fact alone wouldn't justify a 1-star review. But everything else was just horrible. We came here expecting our beloved, delicious 25-cent wings that we've been coming for for years, only to be told that this was discontinued 2 months ago. Now you can have 10 wings and fries for 8 dollars. Whatever, we'd come here all the way from the Venetian and we were hungry. The fact that there was no wait, like there usually is, should have tipped us off. 

The restaurant was dirty and had sticky tables. I don't know why I did, but I ordered the fried calamari, which came out burned-looking and the calamari chewy, rubbery, and gross. I couldn't even have my friends try them because I didn't want to make more than one person ill. The waitress never asked why I hadn't touched my plate, or offered anything else.

My friend also had the ""worst chicken fingers she'd ever had,"" consisting of mostly bread. There really wasn't any saving grace to this place at all.

I felt bad for raving about this place and taking my friends here, and also for telling everyone else I knew about it. I loved this place and their amazing wing deals for years, and am sad that I can't come back. Dan Marino would be ashamed, too.",QJW33YrUGp-wVMI8M5mObg,0,0,1,bLLE1MV7lCYSwB_X38u6kA

Ok, sure I've been there before and saw tons of people order those wings so I'll go with that. BAD DECISION!!! 

if Hooters is closed, just go home and get a great breakfast somewhere else in the AM. The wings were the worst I've ever tasted. I thought Rum Runner was the worst wings but this place gave them a run for their $ and have been crowned worst wings ever.

You should be used to patrons asking for different things on the menu. and beign this is y oru late night special - I'd figure this is something you'd prepare to order... for this to be fresh today not fresh yesterday. 

I stomached literally 1.5 wings. 1st b/c i didnt know.. 2nd 1/2 just to make sure. even the french fries were inedible.

There is a 10 wing minimum, but since we went in a large group, wasn't that hard to order over 100 wings together. We ordered breaded and non-breaded wings, some hot and then some 911. The wings came pretty quickly much to our surprise, our waitress was super attentive and friendly. The wings were tasty and I have to say that the 911 wings were a tad too vinegary for me.

I was immediately turned off by the fact that at 1:45p.m. the place was a mess.   Paper, food and other things littered the floor.  The tables seemed to be only wiped down and the staff absent.  We should have left at this point, but stayed. 

There were about 4 other tables seated during this time and we ordered first and got our meal last.  

I couldn't bring myself to order anything traditional, since I was so turned off by the cleanliness of the place, so I got a house salad.  The tomatoes were mushy, the lettuce wilted and warm.  While it was a decent size, it lacked greatly.  Not to mention I found a hair in it, which was NOT mine.  6 bites into it and I was done.  

My boyfriend ordered the Brisket Platter, the only edible thing on that was the garlic mashed potatoes and those were mediocre.  The meat on this platter was ok, but over sauced and it seems that they use a cinnamon base, so it was too sweet.  The corn on the cob was bland, cold and most kernels were broken and destroyed as if it had sat in water way too long or been rough handled.    The platter was supposed to come with a corn muffin, but did not.  Probably best. 

Some staff were friendly, while others seemed rude.   

A huge disappointment.   We are only giving it a 1, because we cannot go any lower.   We will definitely stay away from this place and Hooters all together.",MOQn-nHMKEUZNn65wzqe_A,1,1,1,qR-r05I5CGyKPgi5RuWKaw

The amount, not the taste, was the best part of my meal.  An 8 ounce NY Strip medium rare, 3 fried eggs w/toast and tomatoes, and fried potato skins.  The food wasn't bad mind you, but there was nothing about the steak or the eggs that would compel me to run out and tell the world.  Just a 3 star experience.

It probably would have gotten a better rating if it was 3am, I was intoxicated, and eating cheap chicken wings. Unfortunately, it was 1pm, I was sober/hungover, and paying way too much for the experience that was my lunch that day.

I stayed at Hooter's and was killing time before my shuttle came to take me to the airport. It looked pretty slow, but as we were sitting, we noticed about five other tables come in within about ten minutes. I'm a waitress also and I know that if I was the only server on the floor and I received 5 tables in 10 minutes and I already had tables, I would be freaking out a bit. I think our server was the only one on until (it looked like) another one came from break or clocked in.

My friends split a garden salad with ranch and I ordered a Caesar salad to start with. A guy brought out our salads, dropped them on the table and walked away without making sure that everything was correct. My Caesar salad was actually a salad with bleu cheese and by the time we got it fixed (about 10 minutes later), my food came out after I took about 2 bites of it. At that point, I was a little annoyed (if not sleep-deprived and grumpy), but it wasn't a big deal.

I don't remember what my friends ordered, but I got the brisket sandwich, which was decent, but I probably wouldn't order it again. This is where I thought I was on candid camera or temporarily invisible. And it kind of killed the whole meal. I don't know if I pissed off my waitress because of the whole salad debacle, but she hardly even looked at me throughout the rest of the meal. My friends each got refills on their diet cokes and when she brought the iced tea pitcher by, I THOUGHT she asked me if I wanted more iced tea (my glass had been empty for 10 minutes), and when I said yes, she turned around and refilled the table behind us with iced tea. Uhm, HUH? It was almost kind of comical.

I have to admit, this is my first 1-star rating for anywhere and maybe I'm expecting too much (Maybe refills are overrated?), but I would probably only come back for the 25 cent wings when I'm intoxicated at Hooter's at 3am.",FEiGViDkyGPM5jp6cy-F4g,1,0,1,nDEN-5v2VieyihyVGjlyBw
