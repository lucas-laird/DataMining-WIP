Me, my wife and 8 year old daughter came here for lunch around noon. The place was empty the whole time we were there. Now the service was ok. Our waitress was attentive but forgot a few items that we ordered. Usually that would annoy me but the food was so bad I was actually thankful of her forgetfulness. Majority of the Nigiri we ordered the fish tasted bitter. Not exactly the flavor profile I would expect from raw fish. The Uni was very dark that left a bad taste in my mouth even after several helpings of ginger.... And I hate ginger with a passion. So to use that to cleanse my palette is saying a lot. I cannot convey my dissatisfaction of Gorilla Sushi because words haven't been created in the English language that would equal my feelings of disgust....",TiQGSEJSau7gMLU9m1Q2og,0,0,1,Vyb3hliuTnGyX20Mi8_eeg

He liked the uni (Sea Urchin) nigiri sushi - which is fine. He can have mine.

We both agreed that the rice was good.

Minor complaint; the music was a bit boisterous and loud for us - but we're a couple of 50-year-old guys who like to converse and gaze adoringly into each other's eyes while we dine. This was a bit more of a college party atmosphere than we tend to enjoy. But that's just us.

Outside reminds me of Kabuto, a high end omakase style only restaurant in town. Simplistic plain, white walls with narrow windows.... except it all changes when u go inside. Very conflicted decor. Lol. Ceiling had a nice design with the varying height lighting. the sushi bar and the wall behind looked nice with the layered acoustic sound dampening foam lookin like design wall (i dont know how to describe it) Then... u have the cheap bar chairs that look like they are from hawaii, and tables with benches that remind me im in a food court. see? conflicted.....

We were sat at a table fairly quickly and had our drink orders taken. And that was that. Lol. One of my friends had written down our nigiri order on a napkin and handed it to the waitress. It took one or two more servers to ask us before we had actually even received our waters. 

Food came out periodically. Fairly slowly. Actually quite slow considering they seemed to have a fully staffed sushi bar with 3 chefs and a restaurant barely half full, if that. The dining room staff was very attentive in repeatedly asking us if everything was ok, by multiple people... but nothing ever came out quicker than expected after telling them we were waiting for our orders. 

Fish to rice ratio was pretty decent but fish slice size were definitely inconsistent. Fish slices varied in thickness. Some quite thin. Some quite thick. Their sexy salmon nigiri was essentially a salmon nigiri with a slice of avocado on top, slice of lime without the peel but WITH the seeds, some spicy thousand island-like sauce, and a small spot of sriracha. Quite inconvenient to eat when u have to eventually pull out the seed from the cut slice of lime. Nigiri overall were ok. The most weird one was probably the Ikura. Never had i seen such ""ugly"" ikura. Quite the few were ""deflated"" and ""flat"". Some seemed ""mushed up"". Color seemed a bit off too. Rice was a bit weird in combination with the ikura. Rice seemed mushy in this order. The rice, itself, in the nigiri was ok but would have preferred a little more vinegar taste but seemed to vary in quality over the course of the night. Some was soft, some seemed like it sat out for a while..... 

Our 2nd order essentially disappeared, despite being placed to the manager himself. Order was checked on by the servers and eventually the manager. We had ordered the Gorilla tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi as well as some hand rolls and appetizers. Tuna sashimi had some cajun spice on top. Salmon sashimi had some weird sweet sauce on it and cut weirdly.. Yellowtail with ponzu but fairly ""normal"" in that aspect. I had ordered a salmon avocado handroll and a salmon skin hand roll. When the handrolls came, the manager was like, ""oh i had the chef put more fish in the handrolls for you since it took so long"". To be honest, i dont feel like it was larger than how any other restaurant would have done it. Also, my salmon skin handroll became a salmon handroll, with less salmon than my salmon avocado handroll. Lol Friend's agedashi appetizer came before the sashimi's but my green mussels were no where to be found

As mentioned previously, food came out slowly. probably a good 15 minutes or longer between each dish. 

We had originally arrived at 8... by the time we got thru our 2 orders... they were asking for last call by 1030. We decided to just give up and go for dessert. Something outside of the sushi chef's realm. It was a choice of either ice cream, mochi, or tempura ice cream. With tempura ice cream, we had a choice of what ice cream, so each of us ordered one as well as other things. The server later came back soon after taking our order and told us they were out of all tempura ice creams and asked if we'd like to order any other ones in addition to what we had before. So we did. When the desserts came out, the ice creams had chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Normally it wouldnt be weird to have this happen but who in their right minds would drizzle chocolate syrup on top of green tea ice cream.... another weird combination by gorilla sushi ! ! 

Price wise WITH the 50% off is a great deal but you must allocate quite the amount of time to eat. After about 2.5 hours, we still left not really full. Would have loved to order more but they were so slow in fulfilling their orders, who knows when we'd get it... IMAGINE how much worse it can get when the restaurant is actually full.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,3,2,9SbL5zufELQ6aAqcS7adpg

Location is clean, service from Austin was super friendly, but more importantly, the fish was hella fresh! The apps alone were worth it for me, with ample starter portions of one-limit items like sashimi salad rather than a couple of tablespoons in a tiny bowl. They also offer a couple of dinner-only sashimi options. The poke and salad were solid, but the seafood nachos and stuffed tomato (crab + avocado wrapped in tuna) were better. Their version of the classic riceless Rock N Roll was better than almost any other version I've tried. I did not partake but their dessert menu is larger than other AYCE options, which is a plus.

1493509,2016-08-27,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Gorilla Sushi is still very new, so I understand that service may not be the best, but... woo. I came with two of my friends on the last day of their half off special and around 6pm, which unfortunately seemed to be the peak dinner rush, as we walked inside to a completely full line. One of the servers kept returning to the front to take names down for a waiting list, and it reached a point where some people were warned of a two hour wait and people waited outside to be called in. It took my friends and I roughly an hour to be seated, but even then, people who came after us were seated first and it seemed they had lost our name on the list (rip). When we mentioned it the server, he immediately seated us at an open table, where we sat for another 10 or 15 minutes before flagging down a different server for a few waters. She was very kind and immediately took our order, and my friends and I decided to order quite a lot because we expected them to be done slowly due to the high volume of people in the restaurant. 

We never had one specific server attending to us - we ending up interacting with each one, but usually to ask about the status of our other orders or to request more food, because our first server never came back until the end of our meal. They didn't seem to have assigned tables to specific servers, which may have furthered the confusion when trying to deliver orders. All of the servers were very nice and tried to make sure we were getting our orders, and one was sweating terribly from continuously running around, so I never felt irritated by the service even though it wasn't great. In the end, a decent chunk of our orders never arrived, we received a few wrong orders for different tables, and we never got any water refills (we never asked for any, but I assumed it would be done automatically?). They had run out of a few items by the time we were able to order - sea urchin, most of the mochi ice creams, and fried ice cream - but it wasn't a big deal to us. Ultimately, we spent 4 hours trying to get all of our orders, and our friend who mainly came for appetizers (not much of a sushi fan) left still a bit hungry because those came out the slowest. They also apparently closed early, as they were turning away customers while my table and 3/4ths of the restaurant was still eating around 9.

Side notes on a few memorable dishes:
- Takoyaki costs $4.50, comes with only TWO balls, and an incredibly small piece of octopus inside. Highway robbery if you're ordering that for a la carte. 
- The deep fried rolls have a very thin layer of batter on the outside, so if you love ordering it for the crunch that gives, you may be disappointed. 
- Bulgogi was super tender! I think this might be a Korean owned place, because there was ""spicy rice cake"" available, which I was fairly certain meant ddeokbokki. I haven't seen that at other sushi places before, but I also don't go out for sushi that often. 

Objectively, the conflicting service was two stars because of the multiple mix-ups and forgetting portions of each of our four orders. Interior decor and the fact that they're still new gets them another, because I didn't leave unhappy - they definitely need to improve their system though. The only items I loved were a few appetizers - namely the gyoza, shumai, and bulgogi - while everything else didn't quite stand out to me. Personally, I wouldn't come again just because there wasn't much I was crazy for from what I tried.",2QinH3PSln8t6TjXPlA8wg,1,0,3,WYZadjWIb6oetn502rE1vg

1607292,2016-08-26,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"So I'm basing this review on a two day experience. 
Day 1: The grand opening we were there when they just opened. Our server was Steven and he seemed like a nice guy but often felt like our table was forgotten. We wanted appetizers first to start and we wanted the Hawaiian Kalbi, the pork belly, Gyoza, and bulgogi with rice. We never got the Kalbi or the pork belly because they were out of it and I'm wondering how because it's day one for them and we were literally one of the first customers. The Gyoza is good and the bulgogi is good. The sushi is decent but there was a weird taste to the crunch rolls. It got busier and what became frustrating is that my table was not getting the service we wanted. What started off as Steven as our server became every server taking our orders getting super confused and then the servers are confused because there's like 4 servers trying to help us and couldn't get our food on time. It was a really long wait to get food. We thought to ourselves not a very good first impression but we will come back when they fixed the kinks.

Day 2: we went yesterday Thursday a day before the final day for 50% off. Just me and my girlfriend this time and we had a table fit for two and we had a guy as our server I don't recall his name but I noticed had like 3 tables two of those tables was me and my girlfriend and another couple sitting next to us. The other table was like a party of 3. Our server was a bit better than last time because he initially took care of us but as the time progressed he forgot about us a lot and I watched him help the other tables back and forth and look at me but would forget to come back and so many times would forget our order and have to remind him three times. 

The positive that made me and my girlfriend experience there better was this girl who was working the tables at the other side of the restaurant she was in charge of the tables party of 10, 7, and like 8. She was hustling. Her name is Almira and she walked all the way over to us and asked if we were taken care of and we let her know that we thought but we've been waiting. She decided to help us out even though she had those tables with a huge party when she took our order she got our food in time, she refilled our waters on time which by the way I've been waiting to get refilled if it wasn't for Almira. We got more food and she made sure it got to us. We finally tried the Kalbi and pork belly and it's actually very good. She was a very hard worker and regardless how busy, her customer service stayed on point. We got our desserts on time. The original guy came back and asked if we're okay we told him yes because Almira has been helping us and we really want our check so we can leave now. He said ok be right back and he never came back and we waited 15 more minutes and Almira comes back and asks what we are still doing here because she thought after desserts we would have paid and leave and we told her the situation and she got us our check in not even a minute. So explain that please Gorilla. 

Me and my girlfriend were so pleased with how amazing Almiras customer service was and he ability to work under pressure and still be on top of her game. She deserves to be a lead and show everyone else how it's done. The full five stars is respectively for Almira. Thanks from me and my girlfriend for turning our frown upside down.

TIP: ask for Almira next time to serve you, try the Hawaiian Kalbi and pork belly and the sexy salmon nigiri.",jDcEgczm7r2zlzV1keoW2g,0,0,3,dwS-7uFoqh8jQqSnULb9kQ

I don't think they realized unexpectedly closing and reopening for dinner with a huge group can cause more problems than keeping it open. The chefs get swamped and servers run around trying to get everything done at once for every seat that had just been sat.  They apologised for the delay (a lot). Luckily, the servers were nice and the food was pretty good. I was disappointed that the food ran a bit slow (like I said, reopening and letting everyone in at once is like opening a flood gate), our second set of orders finally came through about a little over an hour after sitting, (30 minutes after our last of the first order came in) and a lot of options started running out. Other than that, the food was really delicious and the place has a ton of potential. I had some water spilled all over me, which wasn't a big deal, since our server was probably a little nervous. I just wish the manager had re-seated, instead of me having to ask while I stood waiting for them to finish mopping around me. Also, like I said, a lot of apologies. They should take pride in their work, not feel sorry. It's okay. Spilled water is spilled water. Apologize once, re-seat your guests,  and thank them for understanding. Overall, it was a pretty great place. But I do have to say, the lobster roll was a bit of a turn off. Glad that was the last part of the meal!

Ambiance is good (though location could be better). Now the food.. mostly fresh but BLAND. Oddly-shaped nigiris have way too little rice. I had salmon and yellowtail nigiris = bland. I liked the charred eel nigiri but it was overcooked = dry. Gorilla special handroll was bland. Their uni nigiri was the worst I've had by far. Not fresh and very fishy.... and BLAND! I would say this place is more of a korean-japanese fusion. Their Korean dishes are way tastier than their Japanese food offerings. The sushi chefs were all Koreans (figured). Don't be fooled by the pictures posted in Yelp. Food will come to you in a lot smaller fashion.

Our experience wasn't really bad. Just very very average. Will I go back?Probably not. 

Dinner AYCE of $25.95 is standard but you're better off with Sakana (best AYCE sushi by far in my book) or Yama Sushi (the only place with $23.95 AYCE dinner price).",RT768sPSTI2BRSq-1aF2Fw,0,0,3,zQYvuyABxI8GHsRWq_vTlQ

Ok fine. 

Let's start again. I like Gorilla Sushi. The one thing really going for them is the quality of their seafood. Its excellent. The nigiris have the perfect fish to rice ratio, huge nice cuts of fish and less rice. The garlic tuna, salmon, and hamachi were my favs and would recommend. I believe they offer only an order of sashimi for their AYCE and its only for dinner. I liked the salmon skin salad, screaming orgasm, and white orgasm were all tasty just don't wear a white shirt. They also have a lots of appetizers not just sushi like kalbi, bulgogi, soups, spicy fried chicken. For desserts they're only one order person but they have a good selection like the green tea cheese cake, mochi ice, snowflake which is shaved ice with condensed milk and some flavors chocolate and red bean, affogato, and a few more. The rolls were good couldn't remember them as I ate a lot of different ones. You can order half rolls for a lot of them.

They did forget to make a few items that may or may not have been ordered but no biggy everyone has that problem keeping up with my appetite. Just placed another order then all good. I'd definitely be back though.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,6,8,4,du7tEkg7Vnpnytfi5NmAWA

2544552,2016-08-24,2,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Let me start by saying that I was really excited to come to this place due to the half off promotion they were having for their opening week. 

My group arrived at 5pm expecting some kind of wait only to be greeted with a sign that said ""reopening at 630pm"" which forced us to find something else to do for another hour and a half which we didn't mind because we understood that the might have needed some time to replenish for the next crowd.

My group of 8 were the first to be seated at 630pm, all starving and ready to eat AYCE sushi. The waitress immediately served us drinks and grabbed our first order. Seemed like a good start!
 
The first round came out after 30 mins consisting of 3 rolls and about 15 orders of appetizers. 10 mins after demolishing that, we ordered again, then another 42 mins for the second order. So far still good considering how many people were there. 

AND THEN ... close to an hour later, the waitress comes back and says that our third and fourth orders were coming. 20 mins after that, still nothing. I think they completely forgot about our orders! To my friends annoyance,  he asked her again if the food was even coming and when she came back after checking on it and said ""almost"". He just asked for the check so my group can leave. The only time someone would come to our table was to give us more water and more napkins (which we didn't need because we weren't eating anything). 

We were in there a total of 3+ hours and I don't think I even ate a whole roll of sushi because we were all sharing the ones that came to our table. Despite their cheap prices, they were clearly understaffed for this promotion and their service was slow. It almost seemed like they didn't expect to be busy. I definitely would have been more understanding if the staff were ALL busy but I saw some hanging around this podium and just waiting for people to make eye contact with them. No sense of urgency for a place that was so busy. 

As for the food, order the Starbux roll. That was the only one I liked because that was the only one I got to taste.",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,2,0,3,7whRnM3cqYzD7ekJ9itnrg

Not very heavy on the sauce, which I like, and the common special rolls like the Dragon, Caterpillar, and the Lisa Lisa was really on top of its game compared to some other places. My friends said it was a great first experience eating sushi and we were glad it had to be that place. Expect us every other week to eat there and play pool at the cafe.

The sushi was good. We like getting a lot of the cooked rolls to be honest, they were good rolls, but they were somewhat drenched in the eel sauce.

2861024,2016-08-24,2,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"I have SO much to review and, unfortunately, it's not very pleasant. Needless to say, we all know that this place had its grand opening only a couple days ago and are offering half off AYCE sushi. I thought I'd wait until the hype had died down, but was given a chance to come tonight. A couple friends and I came here tonight (Tuesday night) a little before 7pm, apparently right after a party of 25 came in.

Entrance : you enter through unmarked regular doors and come upon a wall straight in front of you. There, you wait for someone to seat you when they see you(Fortunately for us, my friend was seated and we didn't have to wait there, but we saw many people standing awkwardly for a while until someone approached them). 

Decor: white walls over, chic wood looking benches/seats, sushi bar to the left, and a colored and lit DJ/Bar looking area to the back. Very clean 

Service: Servers are super nice. Devi was amazing, and always checked up on us, as well as tried to get our orders going along. However the service time was Ridiculously long. We waited an hour after we ordered, to get our food from the bar. (we were able to snack on ""appetizers"" that were able to be made in the back, such as edamame). They spent all of their time waiting on the group of 25, that we could see that our table as well as 5 others around us weren't being served anything. The 3 sushi chefs (found out that one had called out) were filling orders only for that table, and no other tables were served. When they were finally serving good to other tables, lots of rolls were being run to the wrong tables. However, you could tell everyone on staff plus the man who we believe may have been the owner or MOD at the time was frantically trying to figure it out. Effort was great, execution was not. Definitely needed to fix their system. 

Food: after waiting an hour (1 hr and 4 min actually) for our first roll from the actual bar, it was just subpar. You could tell at this point that they just needed to get orders out. It was made a bit sloppier, with a tad too much sauce on a couple of the rolls, but the quality of some of the fish was actually pretty good. (Fatty, large pieces of salmon nigiri was great). Unfortunately we didn't get to try all the rolls we ordered because they missed about 3 rolls. (1 order would be missing out of 4 that we would ask for per ticket). 
**if you do go in the future, order the dessert type roll. (gorilla roll?) It has mango, banana, and strawberry and was pretty good. Even decided to order vanilla ice cream with it. 

Honestly, I believe this has largely to do with them being open for such a short amount of time and most likely not being prepared for large crowds/large parties. We left 2.5 hours later at 9:30, not full and not very satisfied. We even felt bad for the table that came in not too long after us that had barely gotten any food. If it wasn't for how wonderful and sympathetic our server was as well as the the decor, this place would have 1 star. 

My suggestion is to stay away from this place until at least a couple weeks after the grand opening and come during slower hours. :) the half off was not worth it.",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,2,1,2,r8Zqc_K5akMMfn6FpCyLDw

I had to leave the party early so I asked the server to please charge me for my AYCE. HE CHARGED ME FOR THE ENTIRE GROUP'S MEAL! It came out to be about $300. I am the type of person that doesn't like to complain and usually just brush stuff off. But I did feel the need to say something since we did tell him from the start we'd like separate checks & he seemed perfectly fine with it. When I did inform him, he became irritated, gave me a horrible attitude and basically accused me & said it was my fault. They did reverse the charge & apologized in the end.

2969102,2017-08-01,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Wanted to have some sushi buffet, and after looking at a lot of menus from other places, I decided on this one. We came with a party of 6, so we wanted variety for everybody's taste. 

There are many special items that can only be ordered once, but they're pretty good portions. The uni came with 2 pieces per order. Nice and creamy. The shrimp came with 2 pieces, the fried head was sooo fresh and good. The sushi was perfect one bite. 

We tried many different rolls, they were all created with heart. The only downside is the rolls takes a long time to come. The sushi in general took a long time. They need more sushi chefs. We got most of our order, and was told we still have like 6 rolls left. Kinda sucks because you want to eat the roll when you're most hungry to enjoy the taste. 

The sashimi allowed per person was great, I couldn't find another place that offered sashimi except here. They were cut really thinly. And we asked for a couple with no sauce to taste the freshness. It was great! 

The rock and roll was good, rice less and refreshing. 
Sashimi nachos was good, crispy with nice cold sashimi and sauce. 

Was really full near the end but still got some ice cream and mochi in the tummy.

The party was really impressed since this is their first Japanese buffet in Las Vegas.

FOOD: I've had AYCE sushi all over the valley. Woth that being said, this is one of the best places I've ever eaten at. Where do I start?? 

Appetizers - we ordered shumai (steamed), fried soft shell crab, corn cheese, baked mussels, takoyaki, shrimp tempura, bulgogu, gorilla hot dog, spicy fried chicken, and pork belly. All of our appetizers tasted very good, except the bulgogi was a bit on the tough side. 

Sushi - we had the following nigiri: garlic tuna, yuzu yellowtail, smelt roe, flying fish roe, and sexy salmon. On to the rolls: spicy yellowtail roll, gorilla dream, gorilla special handroll, hawaiian roll, lobster roll, mexican Fiesta roll, and Jay roll.

The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was phenomenal. You get a huge piece of fish and a small ball of rice. The garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail was out of bounds good!! All of the rolls tasted good as well, but the nigiri were the star of the show!! 

Dessert - green tea cheese cake and a snowflake. Green tea cheesecake was so good!!

We could've have just left then but we felt obligated and stuck so we ordered anyway. No teasers (edamame or cucumber salad) and no offer of ginger/wasabi (#4) Rolls were OKAY. Sushi chef was awkward but really nice and owner was a helicopter in a creepy way. We left with our fingers crossed to not have food poisoning.

3591712,2016-08-24,4,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Unfortunately, my time at Gorilla Sushi was quite poor. I enjoyed what food I got, but the amount of time we waited, and the fact they ran out of: Salmon, Kalbi, Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Tempura Ice Cream, Salmon Collar, and Unagi were simply unacceptable even in a soft opening situation. We spent 3.5 hours here, the first full hour of which no sushi dishes came out. The staff was apologetic and I didn't really feel any need to blame them, but there aren't enough sushi chefs and they don't apparently work particularly fast. Another problem is that there are only 3 working during a full dinner evening. They have a lengthy sushi bar, and the fact that they have to take sushi orders from patrons at the bar while falling dramatically behind is flawed.

We made 4 orders on the night. None of them were ever completely filled. The 2nd order came out almost fully before the 1st, and the 1st basically never got filled at all, except for a couple of the rolls. We tried to reorder most of it in the 3rd but by then all the salmon was gone. That meant the three orders of salmon sashimi, five orders of salmon, and three salmon hand rolls *that we had ordered at 7:15pm* never came out. This is probably 9pm by now. And soon after that, they had run out of another 3 common items. We were never informed that they didn't have uni, but I don't think they ever had that, nor the sweet shrimp.

Still, the staff made an effort to apologize and their hands were clearly tied since they simply had run out of stuff. But to run out of Salmon and Unagi at a sushi restaurant? Pretty bad supply management.

As for things that were good - the sushi rice has a decent flavor. The fish quality was adequate to good for an AYCE. While nothing to rave about, their cooked dishes were okay to good. In fact, cooked dishes and ice cream were extremely prompt in delivery. Just not the sushi. And considering the relatively attentive service, I settled on two stars rather than one.

I'm sure they'll iron out the details but I'm not sure we found anything unique or enticing enough to return. The promo they are running during the first week does make it so you'll always get value out of the promo, but not if you include the time invested.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,5,1,2,tZU8GLUzi9US158fO0Qs8A

The veggies included zucchini and sort of a Japanese onion ring.  The batter was very light and the dipping sauces were good.  Next they brought out various plates of different kinds of sushi rolls.  There were spicy tuna rolls, spicy shrimp rolls, salmon philly rolls, some kind of an eel sauce roll rainbow rolls, and California rolls.  All were very good!  One of my classmates didn't want to eat raw fish so she ordered a few rolls that were cooked like Japanese lasagna and a cooked scallops and mushroom roll. I liked everything on the menu!

They get 4 stars for service because there has been times where we would have to wave for the wait staff or they actually brought the wrong order over it ordered it wrong from the start.  Timeliness is 4 stars because anything made from the back kitchen is slow.  I will say staff and what appears to be the manager is super friendly!  My biggest pet peeve is this-  they show videos on the tv but it's sometimes inappropriate videos and all of it is in English or Spanish - I would much rather see Asian singers such as KPop or even movies then what they have now the second pet peeve is how uncomfortable the booths are I know some places do that so people don't stay long but seriously? My mom has a back problem and literally couldn't sit for more then half hour and left hungry,W4rTVigYN6rz57AXCgQuAQ,0,0,4,vOVhTEuKK2FBHrbe-Qj6ag
3995467,2016-08-27,2,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,Don't bother. I called to ask how long their wait was bc I know they have a special going on and the person that answered the phone told me 45 minutes and that he would put me on the list as long as I came in 30 minutes to ensure my name wasn't called before I got there. I show up and I'm told my name isn't in the list and they don't take reservations. I'd recommend going to Sakana.,U-bfKsbc-7kXPJ-09B5CNQ,0,0,2,hrfVJe7i0Wmz0fDqCJ16bQ

After living by China Town for years, it's hard finding good AYCE places on this side of town but I'm glad my boyfriend and I found this little hidden gem!

I must say, I love their garlic salmon & garlic tuna nigiri. Actually, just all their nigiris were really good and great portion of fish! We also tried their seared salmon (least favorite), sweet ebi, and white tuna. 

I think we overdone it with their appetizers. We tried their oyster, shrimp tempura, fried chicken, shrimp and asparagus skewer and baked green mussel, which by the way I really enjoyed and had way less cheese and cream than most AYCE places. 

And the reason why I say we over done it with the rolls is because we could barely finish the actual rolls we ordered. Not really a fan of rolls to begin with, but we decided to try three of them, Boom Boom, Gorilla lasagna and Japanese pizza. The Japanese pizza and gorilla lasagna were pretty much the same flavor, so it was hard to eat both of them.


And to top it off, we ordered Mochi ice cream and Japanese cheesecake for dessert.

Overall, it was probably a 4.5, rounded up of course. The quality of the food was great and the service was also very quick!",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,1,1,5,j-xejwdgu5-MA5UOARAXvw

It's basically a dessert sushi stuffed with tempura mango and strawberries. Their short ribs and teriyaki salmon is the best! It's like a dream come true melting in your mouth. Tuna Poke is chibi-sized and very satisfying. And to finish it off--- you must get the Tempura Green Tea Icecream!!!!,DQeSjKdIq73KpBFri9j7Hw,2,0,5,rdk1Q2TgOWZLbXtUc3hpfQ

I'm still sore after losing Min Sok Chon in this location so many years ago, but in all of the incarnations of this business space, the consistent element is friendly, welcoming service. Calling in a pick up order is so quick and easy, and twice when I had questions over menu items, whoever took my order went out of their way to ask the chefs when they weren't 100% sure how to answer my question. That's integrity right there. The menu features lots of over-the-top rolls, but the quality of the fish is not compromised. The prices of basic rolls is obviously a steal; if you are a UNLV student and you don't know about these cheap Cali rolls, you're missing out on life. But I like the Korean dishes that are also available here - don't miss the Scallop Dynomite appetizer, mmmm. One of these days I'll come for the AYCE dinner; they also have a full bar.

4239648,2018-06-24,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"I had heard about this place a long time ago and kept passing it by while driving for various ride share jobs ;-). I finally got to try this place on a Sunday Night with my wife just a couple days ago.

With that said here is my only complaint: The benches that you sit on are not padded so not very comfortable. I'm guessing they do this to make sure people stick to the 90 minute dining rule lol. 

Now, my praise: J.B. was one of the friendliest  and funniest servers we've ever experienced in a restaurant. He joked around and laughed with us like we were just eating in his house. We ordered ""The Boom Boom"" and right after the song ""Boom Boom"" came on and he came over and pointed it out and then just laughed about it! LOL

The names on some of the sushi dishes had me cracking up! Viagra, Who's Your Daddy, Who's Your Ex-Wife, Taste Like My Ex-Girlfriend and on and on. SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM!!!! The ones we had were so awesome! The sauce that they put on many of the dishes was making me melt in my not so comfortable seat. I don't know what kind of sauce it was but it was brown and drizzled on a lot of different dishes. I had The Baked Gorilla, Surf & Turf (Highly recommend), Who's Your Ex-Wife (Deep fried spicy tuna, spicy crab mix in a jalapeno w/spicy mayo & eel sauce) OHHHHH EMMMMMM GEEEEEEE!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOO FRICKEN GOOD!!!! I think it was that eel sauce that I couldn't get enough of! If you like spicy you have to get the ""Who's Your Ex Wife""! but lete it sit for a minute because they bake it and it comes to your table HOT as in temperature hot, not just spicy hot.

This isn't a fancy spot but they have very nice and friendly servers and the food is good. K-Pop is playing on the TV and the place is clean! If you love sushi you HAVE to try Gorilla Sushi!

4466903,2017-04-08,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"I usually like eating at gorilla sushi when I'm around the area, so I decided to eat here during lunchtime with friends and family. So we walk in and we were immediately seated, asked what we wanted to drink. The server then disappeared into the kitchen and took her time to bring out drinks. It also took awhile for us to be able to order, (though there were only 2 people out of 4 at our table, so I don't completely blame the delay in being able to put in an order).
After some time, we were able to order. Sweet. 
The rest of my party comes, and everything is pretty okay, we ordered some more. Time passes and eventually the customer service deteriorates. We ordered our last round of food and a dessert for one person.  While waiting for the food, a check hits the table. Uhhh sorry we didn't say we were done yet? We just ordered more food!! It's as if we were being rushed out. We were a little bit over the ""time limit,"" but it was not busy at all, there were only 3 other tables so I doubt that it was being reinforced. If the server was concerning us with the time limit, she could've told us that we were overstaying our welcome. Anyways, the food came and we ordered dessert for the rest of the party. Mind you, we were still not done eating so we didn't pay attention to putting the payment in the check yet. (Not like it's our fault). All of a sudden the check is being taken away with an insincere ""thank you."" The server thought that we were ready to pay, but my mom told them that there isn't anything in the check. Lol. You think this is the worst of it all? No it gets worse. My mom decides to tip in cash, and sets it to the side. She was actually planning to put it in the check so she can personally hand it to the server. A couple seconds later, that tip was snatched right off of the table. Wtf? Rude?? I'm a server at another restaurant,,,and its common knowledge that it's courteous to not touch the tip (let alone snatch it off the table lol) or the signed check until the customer has left. Food was alright today, but only it was because they stood on the bar area for long periods of time (8-10 minutes) because of incompetence. Customer service was just a miss today. It's usually great, especially with server Jay. I was hoping that he was working today but unfortunately he wasn't. Too bad. This business is lucky for getting a 3 star from me despite the ""service"" from lunchtime today.

Food: The sushi was good in terms of flavor but I would sometimes get sushi that was dry and not cold enough. Don't get me wrong but isn't fresh, raw fish supposed to cold? Yes, it is. The sushi that I got was warm. Consistency is definitely the key. Other than that, there are a lot of different sushi to choose from and some of them are really good such as the Red Snapper and the dragon roll. 

Service: The service was really good. The servers were really nice and catered to our needs well. I didn't even have to ask for a refill once when I needed one. They are all very kind.

Overall, I left this restaurant with a good impression but not a great one. I understand that they are still new and have a lot of improvements to be made.

Located in a tight strip mall plaza, I was pleasantly surprised how modern and clean it was inside. We were greeted right away and was seated even though we were planning on getting our food to go. 

The dining area was open and spacious. The ceiling had an interesting lighting which brightened up the room quite well. There were 3 chefs at the bar area, which I thought about sitting over there as it was welcoming. Also because it was not the super high table tops I have encountered before at other restaurants. The waitress, Claire, was very friendly and took our orders. Since I couldn't decide, Claire asked me what roll I liked best and I said super white is usually my go to and she recommended the I Love My A** Roll. The menu said it was spicy, but I went for it. Also ordered the Japanese Lasagna, honey toast, spicy ramen, Washington Roll, and Alaska Roll.  Ice cold water was brought out as we waited for our food. The manager, Amy, went above and beyond my expectation. She checked on us as we waited and offered some fried gyoza because she knew we were on lunch and must be hungry! How thoughtful! There is also an AYCE lunch special available, so I will be sure to keep that in mind.

All the food was neatly packaged and I wished I had more time to dine inside, since service was solid. The honey toast was delicious. The Japanese Lasagna was a cream cheese and crab meat delight. The Love Roll was spicy, but I kept eating it anyways. The Washing and Alsaka Roll was mostly salmon based and tasted fresh. Since I didn't have the ramen myself, my coworker said was good, spicy, and had lots of mushrooms in it. I will have to give the ramen try next time. The honey toast was warm had a good honey coating that blended well with the vanilla ice cream. Not a huge portion, but it was enough to satisfy the sweet tooth after a big lunch.

We were so tired of paying $10 for beer and more than $15 for anything you eat on the strip.  This place is so worth our short Uber ride off the strip.

GOOD:
LOTS of varieties and everything was delicious.
Friendly, solid service
$1 sake and beer Mon-Thurs.  SERIOUSLY, $1!!!
$.01 sake on Tuesdays. That's NOT a typo.
Ample parking
AYCE = $26-ish?  I didnt pay attention to the exact amount.
CLEAN restaurant
AYCE includes EVERYTHING that was on the menu... apps, salad, speciality rolls, nigiri (even uni!), sashimi, dessert.

BAD: 
A little hard to find.  It's in a strip mall w/a 7-11.
Some of sushi roll names are super stupid and embarrassing to order in front of my parents (eg. 'Eat Your Ass Roll').

I will definitely be coming here again and again.",l-brIYtiHkd_WbKLfZ93cQ,0,0,5,LNXlx8-SG4bWzPelZKngOw

First of all, the restaurant has a fresh interior which is very clean and spacious.  This is a contrast to the neighborhood which is a bit on the sketchy side (Eastside of Las Vegas).  We made it out alive, so it's not that bad.

For $26, it's a few dollars more than it's AYCE peers.  Is it worth it?  There is nothing to complain about the sushi, a good rice to fish ratio, precise cuts and fish is of decent quality.  The sashimi is limited to one serving per person and it's worth it, it's a much higher grade than anticipated.  Service is pretty good, with consistent check ins to make sure we placed our orders.

The honey toast was a downer, it's just a sweet bread roll that is slightly toasted with some honey and a scoop of ice cream.  Stick with the ice cream instead

What could improve?

-After about 30 minutes or so on both visits we noticed the service dramatically slow down to a point where you think it's done intentionally for you to take it as a cue to leave

At gorilla once you order the food it starts coming out. They were so on top of it. I usually order and wait 5-10 minutes between the orders to get everything. Here it was almost instantly! Another great thing about Gorilla is that the server got about 95% of our order correct, meaning they only missed about 2 orders total!

As for the sushi we loved it. For the price you pay you get pretty decent quality. Their sashimi was surprisingly fresh. Being in the middle of the desert, I didn't expect much. I got some good fish. It definitely wasn't the best but pretty good for AYCE. Their rolls tasted great and not cheap at all. Their nigiri has a perfect ratio. There wasn't an excess amount of rice compared to fish.

It was only my friend and I in the restaurant so our orders came in quick and our server refilled our waters a lot, and checked up on us consistently. However, we did go into the AYCE mindset where everything is all you can eat including desserts (limiting mochi ice-cream like the other restaurants) and this place only lets you chose ONE dessert item per person. So if you want two scoops of green tea ice-cream, you can't. In our case we wanted to try their fried ice-cream and mochi ice-cream but we could only chose one, other sushi places offer the flexibility to have as much ice-cream scoops and misc. dessert items more than once.

Upon arrival we were sat immediately, it wasn't busy. We arrived for lunch and was told someone would serve us soon. A good 12-15 minutes passed and people after us were being served, then finally someone asked if we had been helped...

First off the food here is good, they just need to get their shit together. I ordered Hamachi Kama, which is not on the menu but was stoked that they offered it because I LOVE HAMACHI KAMA. I ordered that shit first. After about 30 minutes, and after seeing 3 hamachi kamas go this family, I asked to check on it. Only to find out that the family got my order and they ran out. Thanks gorilla sushi for letting me down and thank you to the family for just taking my order and not refusing. 

We also ordered Udon in which our server insisted TWO TIMES, it took long because the kitchen was backed up. It's not busy at all, how long does it take make udon? Apparently 30 minutes. Come to find out they lost the order and it was ready after 3 minutes after ordering it a 3rd time...

We left not satisfied, and still missing a few dishes. Big up to the server for crediting us just one AYCE because of their fuck ups... 

HEREs the bottom line. Your food is good, you really need to re-evaluate your service. Your servers do not know which table is which, as I heard them counting. You lost points with me when my hamachi Kama, which I love so dearly was given to someone else, and you take long for service... A simple sorry will not do, our server apologized for their fuck ups like a dozen times... 

Wouldnt mind trying here again but until then, I will not returning until they get their shit together... This is what I get for a restaurant that has a grand opening with a gimmick of half off...",AkSd4bV8E1aOswL-IcNB4w,1,0,2,qCtwRA4ZLMFTrs5okHZPTw

5309595,2017-08-30,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Highly disappointing birthday trip. I have been wanting to come try this place for months. I heard good things, read good things and was excited to have free AYCE on the day of my birthday. Come to find out the free AYCE is only valid with a party of 4 or more and all must be AYCE. 

Today was their one year anniversary. Their special was 50% off. Sweeeet! We arrived a little before 5PM and was seated right away. Small place but clean. Vicki was our server. She was. A bit of a airhead. I asked for a high chair for my 22 month old and she didn't know where to place it so she asked us to move to a table in the back. Totally fine with us. We wait for them to get the table cleaned. They moved our stuff. Took 5-10 mins for our new server Clair to one to our table. We patiently waited. Service once we ordered was roughly good given the fact they were a pretty much full house. 

We got the seafood nachos which was okay, got some other appetizers and only ordered 3 rolls. Yes, three rolls. We ordered the Grand Canyon, Holy Cow and Tastes like my Ex Girlfriend. Holy Cow was okay, Tastes Like my Ex GF was the best and Grand Canyon was disgusting. It was so bad it left a nasty taste in my mouth for over an hour. 

I called Clair over so we can order our dessert and she told us that due to their anniversary they would be really adamant with the hour rule. I said hays fine but 1) we haven't been here for an hour and 2) we still wanted out dessert. I got really offended as there was a table we're next to who was there prior to us and was still there eating and ordered. Um....why you kicking us out 40 mins into our visit when it took 15 mins to move us to a table and get a server to us? We didn't ask to be moved, you moved us!

I definitely won't be returning here. Place was nice and small. But even with the half off price, it was not worth it. 

Amy the owner was great, that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. She took care of us more than the actually servers.",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,2,0,2,SrN7CAPDU5n1I5r9meUOCg

5349060,2016-08-25,10,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Came here last night with some friends to take advantage of their grand opening special, which was 50% off everything, including their AYCE. AYCE dinner is around $25 per person regular price so during their special, it ends up to be $12.50 per person. That is a wonderful price. However, I can't say that everything else was wonderful. 

We got to the establishment at around 7 pm and we started to order our food at around 715 pm. We ordered some appetizers and a lot of sushi. All of our appetizers came before any of our sushi came. We waited and waited ... and waited ... and waited. The servers kept apologizing but it's really not their fault. The sushi chefs were backed up. They only had three sushi chefs that were fulfilling the whole restaurants orders. Clearly, they couldn't keep up. So we decided to put in another order because if it's going to take this long to get our first order, we might as well. So when/if our first order came, our second order should be here after we finish right? 

We decided to order more appetizers since the kitchen isn't backed up at all. We would order their galbi, soups, mussels, etc. Turns out they're out of the salmon collar or perhaps they didn't even have it to begin with. Also turns out they were out of sweet shrimp and uni, which the first server failed to inform us about. 

You know there's something wrong when your second set of sushi orders came out but your first set of sushi orders is still missing. It turns out our first sushi orders were placed somewhere and the chefs never got to it. So our second orders got to the chef first while our first order was sitting in oblivion. We had to bring up the issue about 2-3 times to the servers and to the manager. We eventually decided to put in a third order cause our first order was taking so long. Anddddd they came to let us know that they ran out of salmon and unagi. WHAT. Half of our first order had at least 20 orders of salmon. Now if they'd fulfill that first order....

For the whole night, we had about 4-5 orders and none of them were 100% completed. On top of that, our dinner took 3.5 hours, which is a ridiculous amount of time. One of our friends wasn't full but he didn't want to order anything more because we'd have to wait another half an hour. We actually joked that we'd be here waiting until the next morning. 

 The restaurant was never 100% full the whole night we were there so I'm not sure why everything took forever. Not only that but they ran out of or didn't have: uni, sweet shrimp, salmon collar, unagi, salmon, kalbi, and tempura ice cream. I have never been to a sushi restaurant where they ran out of FISH. Yes, it's their first week. Yes, they are still new. But uhm, if you're going to offer 50% off then you should be adequately prepared. 


Honestly, even with the great price, I don't think it was worth 3.5 hours of my time. I'm not sure if I'd return to the establishment for lunch or dinner.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,7,5,2,WWYZYm7sUfAgoL-tIAD45A
5354831,2018-06-06,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Stumbled across this on yelp and decided to give it a shot. I'm a very big fan of sushi and sometimes I get bored of my same haunts. I was surprised I had never heard of this location, even though I literally lived a mile down the road for 2 years. The good thing is that the place has an amazing ambiance. Slightly dimmed lights gave it that quiet hangout feel which is awesome. I loved the multiple tv's tuned to different stations. 1 was the knight's playoff game, 1 was an E-league match, 1 was baseball, and 1 was a youtube playlist which coincidentally was their source of overhead music. The exact same 4 screens(in backwards order haha) on the opposite wall so everyone can catch whatever no matter where they sit. I love that. The table was clean, and food was tasty. If it had ended there, this place would have been perfect. The 1 fault I had was that there were 5, yes 5 wait staff who work the entire floor. Meaning every. single. 15. seconds. we were hit up with the regular, everything ok? doing alright? everything good? anything else? more drink? Anywhere else with less intensity it would have been a really great thing, but it actually ruined the meal. Pretty much every single bite or sip someone popped up to interrupt us. Dinner conversation? Not likely..... I really REALLY wanna give them the benefit of the doubt and just say ok, the place was mostly empty, which it was, they were a tad over staffed for the hour we were there, everyone was bored and trying to make themselves useful. I really want that to be the case, because they were all super polite and helpful with any questions we had, seriously much love to JD and the rest of them, but my mother was seriously annoyed and I can never bring her back here. I would definitely recommend this place, as I know for a fact it's the best sushi place in it's zip code. Nowhere within 4-5 miles that's as good quality and as comfortable as this place. But for family sushi night? I must resign myself elsewhere.",3a8JVsABTdbJ8pLVX-Dcsw,1,0,4,aC6UVEJgYh77Ocv0rjdmcA

I didn't experience the subpar service the other reviewers have mentioned, so I'm assuming all of the grand opening kinks have been ironed out by now. They have a very extensive menu that has something for everyone - even vegetarians and non-fish eaters. I went in a group of four (all of us seasoned sushi vets) and everyone had a superb meal from beginning to end. Our server (female, don't remember her name) was very attentive throughout the meal, refilling our drinks without us having to ask, clearing empty plates immediately, and taking additional orders. The manager (Chung, I think his name was?) was also very attentive and friendly, taking time to stop by our (and other's) table to check-in and see how our meal/service was going. He seemed to be popular with another table, as well, as I saw them buy him some sake to drink with them. Wish people at my job would liquor me up lol

Looking at the menu, I immediately saw a couple things (half rolls) I wanted to start of with so I put my order in fairly quickly after I got there but I ended up waiting and waiting. My date got two of his rolls, and still mine didn't come out. There was a couple that got there a good 10-15 minutes after I did and they were brought out 4 orders and still nothing of mine had come out. Finally, it must have been nearly 25 mins until I got my half rolls but the server left so fast I couldn't put in more orders which I wanted to do seeing as it was going to take forever. Also, my date had asked for the miso soup as an appetizer and after 3 rolls and still no miso, we had to ask for it again. 3 times we were brought incorrect rolls and once our roll was almost given to the table next to us and it would have been if we hadn't told the server that was ours. Of course we didn't take the incorrect rolls that were brought to us because we assumed they were someone else's and it wouldn't have been right, even if we were hungry and even if ours were taking forever. There was definitely some sort of miscommunication happening between the kitchen and the servers but the servers were still very nice and attentive of re-filling our drinks and aslo very apologetic when something wasn't right so I don't feel like I can knock them. There was a baked roll that I never got but I was already pretty full so no harm done. Other than this though, the food was really good and they have a lot of unique rolls. We ended up being there for over two hours and most of the time we spent waiting. I wasn't in a hurry so although the food took forever, I was a bit annoyed but not too much. If I had somewhere to be afterwards I would've been livid and probably would have asked for a discount. Maybe they were just having a rough start that day.

Even if you're going ala carte it's still fairly priced. The food and portions of each item were plenty and the dishes kept coming out. There's a nice mix of Japanese and Korean choices.

Every time the chef makes something special for me. I absolutely love this place.,41SGPKH6MxheSMzrhac0kw,0,0,5,3u8V1a3V0B3a0Q_ujlHafQ
5918523,2017-11-06,17,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Gorilla and Sushi? Does Gorillas even eat meat, or fish for that matter? I have read articles stating due to climate change and affects on the seasons, grizzly bears are opting for elderberries instead of salmon. So I suppose gorillas could adapt to a sushi diet if they move closer to the sea.

And in the Planet of the Ape universe, maybe they have evolved to consume a wider range of items for sustenance.  Not really sure, plus I have not even watched that movie yet. 

But I am absolutely sure that Gorilla Sushi, the AYCE Sushi restaurant that opened its door for business over a year ago is much better looking on the inside than their low key exterior would hint at.  

I never made it to their 50% off grand opening promo, so I never personally experienced the new restaurant hiccup they had to overcome, but on a recent group dinner outing, the Gorilla was impressive in their FOH service level and their sushi chef and kitchen staff did not miss a beat when they received our first orders (even for a group of 11, I thought it was a huge order).  After the first nigiri orders, we collectively placed another huge order just for the appetizers (Soft Shell Crab was totally worth it and served whole).  Our group didn't tackle their Sushi Roll part of their menu as much, but the selection is huge.

Here are some highlights and insights on what we ordered:

Fried Soft Shell Crab - Served whole!!! So yummy and photogenic. O R D E R   I T !!!

Three Sashimi Options to select from per person - All winners, but only offered with AYCE dinner.

Appetizers - So many choices, but if you are here for sushi, try to refrain yourself. On the other hand, it also means your non-sushi friends can come out for lunch or dinner too!

Fish to rice ratio - In favor of the customer, so don't waste the rice.

Nigiri Highlights - Salmon Roe, Salmon, Halibut.

Be organize and prepare with what you plan to order, and obviously order what your party can finish. 

Service was fantastic for our large party and on my subsequent visit. I totally look forward to going back, especially if my foodie friends ever wanted to plan a sushi night out.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,23,25,5,9xx_KQelHHtXJBPLBdDzQg
5931955,2016-10-26,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Sushi and service here is great.  Teriyaki salmon was my favorite of the night (non sushi dish).  Everyone here was very nice and attentative.  They have a very unique and yummy dessert sushi called gorilla dream.  It has mango, deep fried banana, apple with deep fried banana and strawberry on top drizzled with sweet sauce.  

The place is very clean and bright and modern which is a great contrast from the outside where it looks dark and old.  

Dont forget to get the kalbi, it is great. Also the yakitori. Yum!",aBKfBuDXSMAUdQWFfEgn7g,0,0,4,8lU5WbKdpZafMnAmU0LvRw

5951998,2016-12-24,1,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,First time here. The customer service was up to par very friendly and very accommodating went Friday night and they had a special going on $19 for all you can eat sushi that was a great deal. The sushi was pretty good and their apetizers were pretty good I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I have ever had but for the price it's well worth it happy yelping go check them out,RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,4,3,4,clRk52RuWM0C7atgT4Um3Q
5953714,2017-08-30,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,I love the service here and food quality. We were greeted soon as we entered. The food was quick and server attended to our every need. The restaurant was clean including bathroom. The sushi was plentiful and delicious. We will definitely come again. It's on the opposite side of town from me that's why I rarely check in here.,4YG3CmhBFYajaxa1L2mIRA,0,0,4,AuFj_5pZ1zijtLY077GZOA
5979562,2017-11-06,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,"Ayce is $25 dinner. Clean place, very nice waitress, and great selection of sushi and appetizers. Their menu is great because they have pictures to see. The reason why only four stars is that you can only have one dessert and some of their appetizers and sushi selections are one time order only.",yJCNVrn161Cx9g6WdwOnew,1,0,4,X7lz-xlSvtymttJgCJrJtw
5990862,2017-11-23,0,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,Okay this place is quite different from other sushi places that I have visited here in Las Vegas. One reason that their actually dress in the traditional Japanese kimono and they look fantastic. Not only do they dress well but the play K-pop. If you want a fantastic desert definitely get the affogato ice cream that is on point,DUPRsj5lUBbMEf0ahP8SAg,0,0,5,OHPfK_V3xJb7PVTtccRfjw
