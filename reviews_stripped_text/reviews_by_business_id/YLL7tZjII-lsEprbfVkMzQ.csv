We all ordered  4 incredibly dry tasteless burgers.  Not only do you pay an $8.00 base price just for the burger you pay a $1.00 up charge for each add on. So basically god forbid you prefer flavor or moisture on your sandwich on that overcooked slab of meat. We have been to many J.R's  and not only do they have an expansive menu the food has never been anything but delicious. We even went to one in cancun Mexico in September that had a 3-4 page menu and the food was PHENOMENAL ... The man next to me ordered the chicken tenders and his girlfriend ordered the burger she ate 1/2 and he ate 1/2 of 1 strip and  refused to eat them. I heard him tell the server that they were over cooked and tasted like the oil was burnt, but yet she didn't take them back nor did she offer him anything in place of it. I thought that was in poor service but yet she let him pay for it on his bill. I heard his girlfriend make a complaint .

All the burgers are consistently good, I usually opt for the Original (cheese is extra) or the Route 66 (mushroom Swiss). BF always has to have the chili cheese fries with white onion added, but I personally favor just cheese on mine.

Wait was a bit but I thought it was okay since I ordered chicken tenders along with my burger. 

So I brought the takeout with me to my hotel room to eat it. Burger was good however when I got to the chicken tenders, two of them were raw. They were probably frozen then quickly thawed and deep fried. Luckily I ate only a bit before spitting it out and caught it in time. Unfortunately my flight was very soon so I had no time to show them and complain.

The menu is simplified down to just their burgers (and a chicken sandwich) and fries, but unlike a ""normal"" JR, this location also offers all day breakfast sandwiches (and accompanying tots)! While you can always get take out at JR, this location is clearly designed/better equipped to accommodate quick service ordering and expediting; if you're not wanting full, sit down service, there is a separate register and menu board. 

This location is inside the Bally's food court. It can be easily accessed from the street on Flamingo near Linq Lane. From inside Bally's- follow the food court signs and take the escalator down from the casino floor, near Buca di Beppo. 

Food is good and true to the brand's identity. I am a lifelong fan so I was a little leery based on the restaurant and menu appearance, but it is exactly what I expect when I eat there. 

The real motivation for this review is to highlight the enthusiastic, one of a kind service you will receive from Thomas. He's mentioned by name in so many reviews for a reason! He is so warm and personable, making every guest feel welcomed and appreciated.

I live nowhere near a Johnny Rockets!  Every other trip we take I apparently get very excited when I see a Johnny Rockets!  I don't even always go in to eat.  Sometimes I just take photos.  I don't know the genesis of this low key obsession.  I don't know what it is because I almost never eat red meat ( months at a time between consumption ) pork (never) or chicken (possibly years between)! I'm a default pescatarian.  They serve all of the aforementioned with burgers at their forefront.

Their french fries are savory. I've yet to have their onion rings.  I've witnessed my husband devour their BLT with a side of ranch dressing.  I think I mainly have fries and ice cream here. 

This particular Johnny Rockets could be a tad quicker.  It isn't McDonald's so I don't expect a 2 minute turn around but after 10 minutes I expect 1 complete order.  This did not occur.

It's a fast casual joint in Bally's food court. Go to the counter, place your order, pay and wait for the beeper to beep. Pick up your food and seat yourself. 

I got the The Original w/ Fried Egg. It's a good burger, very juicy. The fried egg was well, fried. Fried to death. lol. No yolk to add more creaminess. Skip the fried egg IMO. 

Smoke House w/ Mushroom. This is The Original with bacon and cheese. My nephew added mushroom to his burger. He liked it. 

The Rocket is an Original with cheese. A cheeseburger in other words. My nephew inhaled this burger. Lol. 

Fries were okay. But at almost $5 an order, you don't get much for your money. 

For drinks, two of us got the root beer float. It was really good. My other nephew got the strawberry & banana shake, he liked it. 

Price was on the high side. Dinner was over $70 for burger, shake & fries for 3. Yikes.
