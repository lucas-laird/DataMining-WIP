2911442,2012-12-15,4,gkU9qqkTeH72ss8SzBZYAQ,"I can't believe I've lived here 6 months and just discovered that I live this close to a Subway!

I went and got a foot long cold cut combo today and was pretty impressed. The place is very clean. The girl who made my sub was friendly and put together one tasty sub. All in all, I don't know what else I could have asked for.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because there are just too many places in the city that make better subs(Earl of Sandwich, Capriottis, Firehouse). As far as Subways go, this is one of the best Subways I've ever been to.

I will most certainly be back..

Eh, it's Subway. They make the sandwich, you watch, it's good. The gals there are entertaining.
A guy walked in behind us with a Yankees ball cap and shirt on, and one of the gals asked if he was a fan. His response, ""No. I just like the colors."" One of those ""Here's your sign,"" moments. Priceless. :)",EfDGaqgxsAzCWQ7lqNz3lQ,1,1,5,MBFBYSfh279xMNsa0hi6SA

I ended up feeding my son a kids meal with a roast beef sandwich. I opted for healthy with apples and juice and it even came with a toy. The customer service at this location is stellar too so much positivity when you walk in the door. The store is so very clean as well it just screams happy and upbeat.,I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,2,2,5,DgMfu5uWB_aKpMtLJL2k2A

Food - well put together sandwich, just the way I like it. They asked me if I wanted it toasted, I said yes, and it was indeed, toasted. Extra point!

The Place - Clean-cut looking establishment. Chairs, tables, etc. all taken care of and clean.

Bathroom - Clean.

Service - Perfect. Two youngish teenager looking boys helped me. They greeted me, they made my sandwich, they said goodbye. 

Overall - 5 Stars. One of the better Subways I've been to in the valley.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,5,8FFCdZ4AGNICqFPMCBh7Jw
4755984,2016-08-07,0,gkU9qqkTeH72ss8SzBZYAQ,"Went here with my friend and her daughter and the tables were dirty (All of them) which for the fact no one was there and two girls working behind the counter, there was no reason for it.  Also they both didn't seem to like their jobs because of their attitudes. One girl was cleaning out some gunk from the bottom of the cooling bin where the metal containers rest on to keep the ingredients cold but she wasn't careful nor paying attention to the fact that stuff kept falling into the bins with clean ingredients because she held the dirty rag over the clean food. Not the smartest bulb in the bunch. If it wasn't for the fact my friends daughter was hungry I would never have eaten here.",vU8eyqx5z-g8TVmgPvRfVQ,0,0,1,sqVg3ow6UZDurvCtscjwYA

Recently opened, it's located across from vons, and right next to bachi burger. Overall the place is very clean and likewise with the food prep.

The workers are all very friendly and very prompt making your food. All in all one of the better subways in vegas.

Protip: they just got jalapeno bread!!! :D",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,0,0,4,L9iR2EvHf2IhjJvPXdVibg
5373037,2012-02-07,0,gkU9qqkTeH72ss8SzBZYAQ,"9 Grain Wheat or Honey Rolled Oats are breads after my heart. Instead of the humdrum white flour variety, wheat breads have a natural sweetness to them that elevates a sandwich. Right now they are running the FrebruANY promotion. Any foot long is only five dollars. It makes no difference to me because my normal Veggie Delite is the same price year long. 

I might not be a vegetarian, but I feel no sense of loss when ordering. The fresh selections of vegetables more than make up for the fact that I am not taking advantage of their deal. I have a sandwich stacked high with lettuce, spinach, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, olives, pepperoncinis, and a generous amount of red wine vinegar. Adding avocado helps to balance the tartness of the vinegar with some healthy fats. With all their sandwiches, the option to get cheese is also readily available. 

With all this talk about Subway being a healthy option for dining, maybe I should not jump in my car and just walk across the street. Oh well, one step at a time.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,0,4,-j19ebHWTtzgKd4g1Gkp1A

Pick your bread, meat, cheese, ""would you like that toasted"", now on with the veggies, sauces, seasoning. Would you like to make that a combo with chips and a drink?
Thank you and come again.
Oh, watch your step.",Si3aMsOVGSVlsc54iuiPwA,0,0,4,83DyQUtKewOp_PRZfwQDFA
