Also were helpful when my son got sick at the table from eating the Fresno Chile that came with his bbq wings. Also they removed the pepperoni breadsticks from my bill when it was obvious they were not a hit with the table. 

Here is the bad: my son said the Wings tasted funny. So I made the mistake of eating them. I didn't pay attention to whether the meat was fully cooked. But the meat must not have been, because within one hour of leaving I became violently ill. I am on my third day of suffering the effects of the food poisoning. Ruined the last 2 days of my trip to Vegas. My friend's son got the runs from eating the hamburger. And my friend is still sick as well from the grease. We are pretty sure the issue was  uncooked chicken and old grease. We will not return to the restaurant.

The atmosphere was cool; we sat outside on the patio to listen to the music in the surrounding area/casino. Our server looked like he did not want to be there and was not pleasant. The Mac + Cheese Bacon burger was huge and pretty good. My husband's Triple B Burger was over seasoned, leaving a bad taste. All our fries with our meals were all too salty - over seasoned!  Even both our kids, who love fries, didn't like it or want any. The  Double Barrel BBQ wings were ok, nothing to brag about. Our server never checked on us during the meal, then all of a sudden, another server was asking if we wanted dessert. We kindly declined and asked for the bill. When we got it, some of the billing/charges were incorrect. If you have a ""Total Rewards"" players card, each of the meal prices should be discounted. This had not been the case,  only two items were discounted; the new server blamed our first server since he entered our order on the system/computer. Please review your itemize receipt before paying.

The nachos were made with processed cheese out of a can, not even fresh shredded cheddar.  They were heated just warm canned cheese which made the nachos soggy.  I could get better at 7-11.  Such a disappointment.
My french dip was very large and looked good but the cut of meat was very poor and chewy.  Not like a prime rib dip.  Another disappointment.
I had such high expectations but now I realize he has never visited his restaurant but always somebody other than his.  I was so disappointed and would say maybe the burgers were the bomb but not what we ordered.

I ordered a pulled pork sandy and my bf got the Mac n cheese burger. OMG everything about it was AMAZING how is that even possible it's just a sandwich? My sandy was served on a pretzel garlic bread bun and the fries were ridiculous. I would absolutely rate this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the service!

It's awful because I am aware of what it's like in the food industry and I try and give the benefit of the doubt always, but our waitress was extremely rude to the point of making us both uncomfortable.

My daughter and friends are oddly fascinated and possibly obsessed with going to 'Flavor Town'. We eat out a lot and have high expectations when comes to service and food. Let's just say this visit led to us rerunning the following day with her brothers... It was AMAZING!!! The Mac & cheese bacon burger was delectable... The ranch was out of this world, I cannot even put it into words... Did I mention it was on the Happy Hour menu? Just typing this is making my mouth water, literally. Nice size patty with bacon, lettuce, pickles and a lightly toasted bun... The flavor was unlike any other I had ever had before. The Mac & cheese enhanced those flavors and took this burger to the next level. The fries came with ketchup, BBQ sauce and yes friends, RANCH!!! Also on the happy hour menu was frozen peach Ciroq shots for 9$ I could go on forever, but no worries, I won't. Last but certainly not least was our server, Chris Anderson from Glendora, CA. He was the best server that I've seen and took very good care of us. He made sure we had everything we needed and answered all our questions about the food, restaurant and 'our' new obsession, Mr. Fieri. A real genuine man who made sure our night out as a family was a memorable one. As I mentioned before, we eat out a lot and this is my very first Yelp review.

My other negative was the cocktail. While delicious, it was small- almost the size of a large shot and it was $14. Yes, this is Vegas, but you can get way more for the price or less at other locations. Skip the cocktails and just get beer.

First, the service was piss poor. The server acted as if he didn't want to be there. He was very unenthusiastic, drab and unresponsive. We had to asked several times for simple things. He didn't inquire if we had ever been there before so he could tell us about the place, specials and offer suggestions. He barely spoke a word to us the whole time we were there. I guess he didn't care because the size of our party meant his tip was automatically included, which amounted to about $35. 

On to the food. My kids ordered the Double BBQ wings. They were presented without the sauce on them. The sauce was on the side in a cup. You had to dip them. The wings by themselves were dry and overcooked. The sauce taste like a plain out of the bottle BTQ sauce, nothing special. 

A few of us had burgers which were dry and over cooked. I was told they would be medium well but they were over well. I had the bacon Mac n cheese burger. The mac n cheese was dry also. 

Basically everything was over cooked and disgusting. The kids didn't even like the so called fries that come with the burgers.

His nyc disaster opening in furthered my distaste for him. After eating at his restaurant I do think he is a legit restaurateur.  The food was fantastic. Our waitstaff was super pleasant. We had the turkey picnic, Mac and cheese burger, and lettuce wraps. The lettuce wrap stuffing and sauces were awesome. Spring rolls were crispy and delicate yet bumped up by the sauces. The turkey sandwich was raved by our friends. The pretzel roll was amazing!  Turkey well cooked. The burger was definitely a signature burger and super tasty. The Mac and cheese can be flavorless (Cheesecake Factory) but this one actually added a nice cheese sauce and extra carbs to the burger. No need for ketchup for us as the sauce on there was plenty. The fries were fantastic and a mix of different kinds. The locked up spicy ketchup was a perfect complement for the fries. Overall great place. Food came out slowly. We anted breakfast and just missed it ( I guess 10:30 or 11?).  Since when did guy allow breakfast?  Our campus vision wasn't allowed to do breakfast but this place had it.

My boyfriend ordered their ""award"" winning Mac n Cheese Burger. LOL nothing winning about this burger. It was super gross to me. Way waay worst than my sandwich. Where's why:  The lettuce used was the same nasty subway lettuce. To describe it- it tasted like the lettuce was not covered in the refrigerator and tasted like the fridge chemicals. It over powered the entire burger. The patty was over cooked so it made the burger dry. 

Fries: 
Our orders came with the Quad Fries. It was cool. Had a selection of 4 types of fries. Just wished the fries were a bit crisper. But thats just a personal choice. 

Customer service: Average. Not bad, but not great either. 

Pros
1. Location: has outside patio seating. Conveniently located on the strip.

Overall :: Not good. With the tuff pull pork, overcooked patty and the lettuce they use I recommend you go somewhere else for a burger.",tvVHx67WaLiEO4ijMXFxqA,6,0,2,eH2BTIFULwfY9I79HtidIg

I asked everyone around us if they were watching the current game, which by the way was an NIT game, and no one was watching it at all and they didn't care.  We got up and left.  Went somewhere else that had the game on, and spent our $$ there.  Strong position for them to take on the first weekend of NCAA March Madness to play an NIT game when NCAA Tournament games are on.

I had the ""chilaquiles"". It cost around $16. It consisted of fried tortilla chips coated in some type of hot sauce, with carne Asada, two sunny eggs, avacado, some fried chili's, and a grilled lime on top. The food tasted as good as I would expect from a place with Guy Fieri's name on it. For me I would rate the food I had 4 stars.

The service was somewhat lacking. I feel in Las Vegas there are so many other places with a similar place point that just to it better. It wasn't abysmal by any means, just not quite what I expected. Some of the things I would mark them down for my seem little, but in my opinion that is what separates ok from world class. First it took 28 minutes to receive the food.( this may have been a kitchen issue, but the place was only 75% full). That may not have been on the server, but what was on the server is he didn't check on my beverages until it had been 25 minutes. Then an expo brought the food, but no silverware. The server then came and checked on my food within 1 minute of it being dropped off. That's great but I hadn't even had a chance to take a bite. He never checked again. What if I needed any condiments or it wasn't satisfactory? Thankfully it was good. Lastly it took 12 minutes from when I finished until the server asked if I needed anything else it if I wanted my check. Also not one employee I walked past smiled or gave any type greeting.

Mind you each total was around $65.

Which is funny that it's a 25 to 30min wait and the entire front had six people standing there, two of them us. Completely ridicules as there was 1/4 of the patio open with tables. So basically they were not seating anybody....for lunch or breakfast. Needless to say we will most likely never come back.",sZ-h6YXRKtVM3tDKk1rzfQ,0,1,1,xrNHCvcDm3amiuaN31Y5zQ

The place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  Went on a nice Sunday for lunch.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  We ordered our drinks and it came.  Flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  I don't know where our server disappeared to.  After that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  Presentation was nice!  I ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- I can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which I recommend on the side.  My son ordered the fish tacos.  He said it was plain and not much flavor.  My other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  It was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  The truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  The server forgot my daughter's water.  She finally got it when our food was brought out.  Service was 1 out of 10.  We ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  When our server came to bring our check and I told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  I don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  Apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  Which I won't.  Did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  Not!  The lunch experience left a bad taste.

I may get shot for this, but my burger tasted exactly like a Harvey's hamburger (for those of you in Canada). I like a Harvey's burger, but I also only pay $5.00 for it.

-Husband ordered the sashimi tuna tacos and the fireball whiskey hot wings. No flavor!!! The wings tasted like plain ass wings I could buy frozen from the store and bake but these were worse as they were so over baked, ended up very chewy. The tuna, omg, a crime to waste tuna on this flavorless dish. When I saw the episode where they made those tacos, I couldn't wait to try them. The way they marinaded the fish, and all the flavors, it was supposed to be a party in my mouth!!!
-I ordered the Triple B burger just cuz I love bleu cheese.

It's not the kitchens fault, or even if it is, if Guy stayed on top of it, the food wouldn't suck so bad. I wanted to message Guy personally but who knows if he'd ever be the one to read the review.

We took my mom here to celebrate her 52nd bday because she is a big fan of Guy Fieri. The estimated wait time was 45 min, which we were totally okay with and surprised when we got a ""table ready"" text, after waiting only 15-20 min. It was 7:48pm when I received this text.

Our server was great at first. We ordered a few cocktails, an appetizer and 3 burgers.

They then seated a couple to our right, and then two ladies to our left. Both parties were served there appetizers, and then burgers, and FINISHED before we were ever served our meals. Our server came out 3 times to tell us our food was ""on its way"". If you forgot to place the order or something got messed up in the kitchen, whatever the case, just let us know so it's not a waiting game!! We were chatting with the couple next to us all night and even they were amazed.

By 9:20, hour and a half later, our server was nowhere to be found, so I told another server if he can let ours know to just box our food. Our server comes out with 3 plates and says ""oh are you sure you want boxes?"" And thinking the food he was holding was ours, we said now we weren't sure. He says ""ok it will be right out."" And serves the now third table that's come in after us. We were done waiting and requested a manager and walked up to the host area. No kidding another 20 minutes passed and we were pissed!!  At this point we wanted to pay our tab for the drinks and appetizer and leave. We explained this to a different host and she said ""I have no idea where the mgr is, let me get the chef."" Uhhm ok?

Here comes the other Asian host, Ms. Thing with her poor attitude and rolling eyes. My parents were upset, especially my mom because this was her bday night!! And she loves Guy Fieri!! She was disappointed and telling Ms. Thing, and the young girl just gave attitude and very smartass remarks. Extremely unprofessional! 

The mgr FINALLY comes out, no apology at all, just stated that our server said the two parties next to us ""ate faster"" than we did. Dumbest thing I've ever heard. Seriously.

Says he'll be right back with the check.

10 more minutes. My dad tells the host if the mgr doesn't come back in 2 min we are leaving. She states ""That's fine I ran track in highschool I'll chase you down."" WHAT?!??? What in the hell? The look on the faces of the people standing in line observing this whole thing, some were laughing at the little girl and one group turned around and left!!

Finally the manager comes out and I don't even know why at this point but we paid the tab and left.

I've met Guy before, he's a cool dude and I'm a fan of his show, but it's really a shame this is how his restaurant is ran. I work for Caesar's Ent. and I LOVE the Linq!

245701,2015-01-16,1,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Guy Fieri's in Las Vegas is exactly as Guy's show is on the Food Network, big burgers and lots of fries. The interior is indicative of his style with the clipboard menu and the wood planks that hold the drinks menu. Our server, Brittany provided great service. The kitchen is an open design where you can see what all of the line cooks are doing inside.

For two, we ordered the Triple T Fries (truffles), the Bacon Mac N Cheese Burger, and the Triple B Burger. The Triple T Fries are very thin cut fries that come with micro-planed truffle shavings, gouda cheese and parsley sprinkled on top. The thin cut fries are very crispy, and have great texture. The gouda cheese gives the fries a nice cheesy taste without overwhelming the taste of the fries or the truffles. The truffle, just as importantly was not overwhelming as well, providing an extra layer of flavor with the earthy, mushroomy tones. The creamy white truffle dip really did just taste like sour cream. As the price would suggest, the Triple T Fries do come with a lot of fries. I would recommend sharing this with up to 4 people if everyone is having a burger as well.

The Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger is a charbroiled burger topped with a mac and cheese that is slightly better than average. Other toppings included crispy deep fried onion stings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The burger comes with what would be the equivalent of a medium McDonalds fries (more on this later). The tomato really did not add much to this burger and really could have been either left off or given another slice of. The burger patty alone was actually a little dry and could have been a bit moister. The Mac-N-Cheese was not supermelty as the menu would have you believe, but was tasty anyway. The donkey-sauce, I believe, is the bbq sauce at the bottom of the burger. The apple-wood bacon brought in salty and smoky flavors to the party and is always a great addition to a burger or mac-n-cheese. The brioche bun brought in some sweetness to balance all of the salty flavors in between. I wish there was a bit more pickle, but I just like pickles. Overall, this burger was good, but short of great or excellent.

The Triple B Burger is a charbroiled burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, with addition toppings of crisped onion strings, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The Triple B Burger is also served on a brioche bun and this also helps balance out the flavors a little. The blue cheese was actually a little overwhelming on some parts of that burger, some areas of it had a ton of blue cheese and other areas had little to none. The burger did have some interesting spice flavor to it, but it was difficult to discern what those were among the blue cheese. This burger also had the same problem with the dryer burger patty as the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger. Overall, this burger was good as well, it just could have used a bit more attention to detail to prevent that blue cheese from being overwhelming in certain areas of the burger.

The fries that come with the burger are crunchy just like the fries with the Triple T Fries, but there is a bit of variation, some are thicker cut home fries, mixed in with a few waffle fries, and the super thin cut fries as well. The larger fries are seasoned with a spicy Cajun type seasoning or spicy seasoned salt.

Overall, this was a good meal with solid flavors. I think that I can make a better Mac-N-Cheese with just three cheeses and have it actually be supermelty. The Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger suffers from not having that supermelty cheese as well as a slightly moister patty. The Triple B Burger has the same problem with the burger patty and needed a bit more attention to detail. Overall, the food was a solid 3/5 and the interior/service was an excellent concept for Guy's restaurant (4/5). In any other location, I would consider the price and knock this down one star for the price based on the offerings. However, in Vegas, it seems pretty average. Guy Fieri's gets a 3.5/5 with all things considered.",_xxNHQ4ml5gSH6uTWSylIQ,1,1,4,xSIDl47QzQVfUDg1kFQ7ng

262663,2015-08-29,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I was underwhelmed. The restaurant was nice and the late night menu looked appetizing until the food came. I had the ringer burger (no cheese) and my mom got the pulled pork sandwich. First off, the playing was terrible. It was a small and narrow wooden slab and the food was barely on it. If something shifted, your food would be on the table. The burger was thinner than I expected but the meat was seasoned well. The onion ring on top of the burger was not good flavor wise. Is once that is the feature of this particular item, that is ungood. The breading was too think and it was not crispy. The bun was a buttered brioche bun and it had a spicy mayo and BBQ sauce condiment. All that made the burger greasy and it was too many competing flavors. I ended up cutting the buttery part out and it ended up being much better.  My mother liked the pulled pork but the bread was too much. 

The last disappointment was the fries. I LOVE FRIES and that is usually my favorite part. This plate had four different types of fries (waffle, shoestring, crinkle & curly). Some of the fries were seasoned and some were not. This was awful. They were overseasoned and due to the different types it highlighted what you didn't like. I think it should be ONE type of fry and the best one was the curly. I wanted to like this place but I did not. I definitely would not go back.",GQWk8vgYGlN9hp0XP0V05w,1,0,2,9QtOeyBcV1O0f8xWmD1n5g

The food, on the other hand, was just 'ok'.  I was expecting an elevation of the ""diners, drive-ins and dives"" concept, especially for the price, but what we got was pretty much what you'd expect having watched the show - lots of cheese, deep-fried everything, sauces with names like ""donkey sauce"" (wha?). 
I had the chili with cornbread and it was underwhelming. The chili was just ok. I think I make a better one! The cornbread was dry and lacked flavour. 
My husband had pulled pork on a pretzel hoagie. The sandwich was big and fairly tasty - definitely the best thing we ordered. The fries - spiced and mildly sweet - were just ok.

Let's get this out of the way.... It was overpriced. It's Vegas, It's on the strip, and it has a celebrity chefs name on it. Of course it's overpriced. 

I usually talk about the food first, but the creativity of this place and everything inside prompts a mention first. Everything from the decor, down to the forks, oddly shaped glasses and wooden menus is unique. It gives it the extra charm i look for. 

The food was great, but small portions. We just got some things to snack on so we had the Sashimi Won Tacos and the Asian Chicken Wraps. They were really good, had some dipping sauces (love that) and cooked nicely.

The high tables are super uncomfortable if you don't have long, long legs.  I am 5'6"", so not very short, but too short for comfort at one of those tables.  The wooden stool just dug into my legs the whole time because my legs just weren't long enough for my feet to rest on the top rung of the stool.

I tried a couple dishes here, the Tripple T Fries, which were delish.  I could seriously live on them.  They are thin cut fries so nice and crispy with loads of truffle.  They are seriously a 5/5.

What I was not crazy about was the Gnarly Greek Salad... this was the least Greek salad I have ever tasted in my life.  I understand that Guy does his own take on recipes, but this was taken so far to the extreme that it wasn't even recognizable.  It had croutons, carrot and chickpeas which was odd, but okay.

The Good:
Friendly staff
Great house Sammy Hagar rum drink.
Good to great food (tossed buffalo fries and mac n cheese burger)

Needs Work:
Service was SLOOOW. Took 90 minutes for dinner. 
Burger overcooked.

Problem seems to be difficulty the wait staff has getting food out of the kitchen and drinks out of the bar. Wait staff would disappear but always seemed to come flying back out of the little bar nook where they were held up waiting for customer's drinks. Guys next to us waited 15 minutes for a beer. One beer. That's a flow problem for MANAGEMENT to fix. And it NEEDS to be fixed.

Loved the buffalo tossed fries. Interesting shapes and not too much sauce. Burger would have been good but was overcooked. They don't ask how you want it, which should have been the first clue. They're all well done.

So....we gave them another chance tonight. We were given a ""late night"" menu, which I wasn't expecting. I was going to have the lettuce wraps again but they weren't available.

I was disappointed. Had the Bacon-Mac-n-Cheese burger.

Burger was overloaded with other things except a decent burger patty.
Naturally one would assume the key ingredient should be... ta-da! the burger! But it was too thin and not prominent amongst all the other fillings.

Personally I like a decent burger and bun first and foremost and then some adventurous toppings if you so choose.

If you want a good burger there's other places to go instead.

499080,2016-06-26,1,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"We're Vegas locals so we decided to brave the strip on a Saturday night and try Guy's new restaurant.

First off, this place is very small for being a celebrity chef restaurant. The door to get into the place could easily be mistaken for a service entrance, if not for the long line of people waiting to try to cram themselves through it.

After making our way to the hostess stand, we were told that our party of four would have a 45-minute wait before we could be seated. We had no problem waiting, but the inconvenient part about that is they don't give you a pager so you can freely roam about while you're waiting. You have to hope that you're in the cramped entry space and within earshot of her calling out the names of parties when it's time for your party to be seated, otherwise you get skipped.

After we waited our allotted 45 minutes, we were seated and proceeded to order drinks. I personally tried the Guido's freaky Tiki and the Austin sweet tea. Guido's freaky Tiki is ok by most standards, but the sweet tea was terrible and I ended up sending it back.

We ordered the trashcan nachos and the Vegas fries for appetizers for the table. Three of us ordered the original ringer burger, and my brother ordered the mac and cheese burger.

After 25 minutes our appetizers came out. The trash can nachos were amazing. The Vegas Fries however didn't come with enough blue cheese dressing to warrant the fact that the fries are HEAVILY coated in Buffalo sauce and they give you about 8 whole potatoes worth of fries. Basically, enough dip for one person and enough fries for 10 people. 

It took a full 90 minutes from the time we ordered to get our burgers. To make matters worse, my brother's girlfriend didn't even get the burger she ordered. She was given a mac and cheese burger just like my brother, but since the wait was so long to even get the food to the table in the first place, she ate it anyway because we didn't want to have to wait another hour and a half for them to correct the problem.

The burgers were OK at best. They were juicy, but the onion ring on mine was burnt to say the least, and it seems that everybody at the table had a hard time trying to keep all of the toppings on the burger together when eating it. I know they are going for the whole Guy Fieri hunch that he does on Triple D to have to eat the burger, but it's a little inconvenient when nothing wants to stay on the bread. The burgers are served with three different cuts of french fries because, why not; and a side of ketchup. 

Our server seemed pretty annoyed with the tables he was serving and tried to come around as little as physically possible while we were there. We saw another server who was an attractive blonde, but she had RBF really bad and my brother and I even joked that she might die if she cracked a smile. In fact, the whole staff seemed like they hated you for being there and taking up their valuable time.

On two different occasions, our server came to the table and refilled a glass of Sprite with water because they weren't paying attention. Our server going as far as to say my brother was ""going to give (him) an aneurysm"" for pointing it out.

To anybody considering this restaurant, I say, do yourself a favor and walk around the corner and go to Margaritaville instead. The food is better, the staff is more friendly, the atmosphere is more fun, and there's more room to move. Plus they have live music on the weekends.",2LyTk2_Uy4PMu342NxvoRg,5,0,2,xjuQaRossVjvCy9gx1VyYw

Arrived at 11:30 pm and asked hostesses if I could self seat at bar (was told that would be fine).  Bartender who first came up rudely informed me they were closing up the bar and indicated the plastic sheeting they were using to cover the liquor. I stated that the hostesses had indicated they were still open. She then mocked the hostesses from across the room and when I asked her if I could be served and she said yeah because the hostesses said so.
Rest of service was from a second bartender who was much nicer. 
Ordered their mac and cheese burger which was pretty good but obvious it was the end of the night as the lettuce was wilted and the some of the fries (mixture of four different types) were cold.  While the second bartender was nice they were cleaning around me and the whole experience felt rushed. 
imagine this place could be awesome when they want you there. If you want to stop serving at 11:30 then your should adjust your hours to seating until 11:30. Manger stopped by to ask me how everything was as I was wrapping up the rest of my food to go.  While he assured me he would take to the first bartender he offered nothing in the way of a bit of the meal or a drink on the house. Guess with $20 for a burger it's not that type of place. When I told him based on the experience I wouldn't be back he told me he wished I would come back again... Not much motivation too.

1) The ""Honkey Tonkey Double McBurger Blaster"" was phenomenal. The two beef patties were masterfully placed between two artisan created pieces of toast. Accompanying this sandwich was Guy's Ragin Flamin' splooge sauce that added subtle notes of hickory and leather.

2) ""Guy's Mozzarella Sticks"" were truly out of this world...possibly in the next universe. White cheese resembling mozzarella was delicately coated with a bread crumble that Guy calls Pano de coto. Simply outsanding!

3) ""Le Chicken Dubenaise"" was the star! A fully cooked chicken was presented table side and the waiter sliced each piece to your liking. It was then served with the most delicious Dubenaise sauce I have ever had.

We were seated very quickly and the waitress got to us the moment we were seated. I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a soda. It did take a long time to get our drinks. I had to ask about my beer a second time. I did cut them some slack because of how busy they were and it appeared they were a bit short staffed.

The place has a simple decor. But it does not stand out as anything special. It is just pleasant, nothing more.

Guy has put out an eclectic menu here. It is only two pages, so not a huge selection, but it is a pleasant selection consisting of Salad's, Wings, Burgers, BBQ, Fries and desserts. I had a chili bowl. The taste was pretty good, but for the price I expected a little bit more. I think Guy's is a good place to give a try.

Entree for me was the Cajun sandwich with grilled chicken, sausage, peppers... Heaven on a hogie.   The Missus did the wings, which she went nuts for.... And we both loved the fries 3 ways.

Great times, hard working, friendly staff, cool... Until.

Some self important manager in a suit (the only staff member that wasn't dressed in Guy-style) started huffing around, bossing the staff around.   The people beside us at the bar had only gotten up a minute before when he strutted up and bellowed, ""Get this cleaned up, this side of the bar is filthy!""   Mind you, the staff was working their asses off, and didn't need to be bullied... Nor did we, as customers, have to witness it.

The waiter felt compelled to tell my guy that he was a beer connoisseur as he smelled his beer.  This really appalled us.  The waiter found out that it was indeed the wrong beer!

They took too long to make and slowed up the kitchen . Really ?

After another bite and further inspection they were clearly steak.

A couple buddies and I decided to come her before heading out on the town.  Considering we generally subscribe to the dives and hole in the walls with good food mindset when it comes to food, we thought a restaurant by the host of a similarly named show would work splendidly.  We were so wrong.  I think about those hole in the walls that have created a name for themselves based off of a passion for quality of food.  When I think of the exact opposite, Guy Fieri's comes to mind.  The food was largely bland and unimaginative.  For as much as he has seemingly experienced, I was expecting a lot more.  I can only imagine that they provide so much food so that the sure to follow food coma dismisses all potential of motivation for negative thoughts.

Food aside, I do have to give a lot of credit to the staff.  My friend's water glass broke mid-drink.  Literally.  The bottom fell from the glass while he was drinking, and, well you can imagine what happened from that.  Sheer pandemonium of course.  Women were screaming.  Kids were crying.  Cars were burning.  It was mass chaos.  No not really...it was just inconvenient.  The manager, whom I did not notice prior, was on it in a heartbeat.  He was over to our table in what seemed like a matter of seconds apologizing.  On top of that, he even managed to comp a meal, a couple beers, and give a free desert for the table.  That attentiveness was impressive.

My husband is a huge burger fan so this seemed like a sensible place to go. We didn't make a reservation since we were still on the fence about it all day. It was a Friday night and I was expecting a much longer wait than what we were quoted, 40 minutes and that was accurate. 
There was not enough room for everybody waiting so that was really annoying. The front staff just seemed to be unhappy to be there. The lead host they had barely even looked up from her computer while she spoke with the guests. I did observe an older couple coming up to the host stand, old man was very friendly but like I said, lead host had no personality and eventually seemed to make the old man uncomfortable with the exchange. This really frustrated me because when I used to work the service industry, I would never let my guest feel like this. I did not see her smile once during my 40-minute wait. The other hosts seemed friendlier but mostly seemed fake. I also saw a manager bossing everybody around but not helping out. Big pet peeve!!! Managers, you are not above your employees. If it weren't for their hard work, you wouldn't be around!
We finally got sat and our server was very friendly. She was very attentive to our table and she had a few others too. My husband likes to gulp his drinks so it tends to be a lot of work for the servers and we make up for it with our tip. This night, he didn't even need to ask for a refill. Not once! I am kicking myself right now for not remember her name! I ordered a mojito and it was really good. Husband and I tried the Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries for the appetizer. The waffle fries were amazing, the chili was good but nothing special. I had the Motley Que Sandwich and my husband tried the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger. The barbeque sandwich was phenomenal and my husband enjoyed his burger. However, I still didn't feel that the prices were justified. I've had better and cheaper barbeque and that goes the same for my husband and burgers.
The portions are big and we didn't really have the table space for them but I guess we made it work. I really should have been more mindful of this but I really didn't expect that the music would be so loud. My husband and I couldn't have a normal conversation without having to raise our voices to a level past our comfort zone. I also noticed a busser slacking off, chatting it up with the servers when there were three dirty tables within five feet of him. I consider this an eyesore, the dirty tables and the lazy employee. 
Overall, my husband and I had an okay experience. We will definitely remember not to come here for a romantic date night. This would be a great place to hang out with some friends though. Food was great, server was great, music was way too loud for comfort, either a bigger wait area or more efficient seating during volume, managers need to be leaders, not bosses, friendlier front staff!
We most likely won't be back. Maybe unless we were already in vicinity and hungry. Then again, there's a few other restaurants we could try out for experience. Only because we have burger and barbeque joints that we go to that are cheaper, better, and friendlier front staff.",cZZAaDUoKu538E7w7ulSVQ,1,0,3,zcYuMmVi3I-uCXN1joPC0Q

This isnt a 5 star restaurant. We went anyway that evening and expected to wait, but never anticipated what was in store for us later. We ordered only one appetizer and a couple sat down next to us then they ordered and they received their appetizer right away. We only had a total of 3 in my party and then they got their main dish and finally here comes our appetizer. Oh btw another 2 gals sat down at the table on the other side of us by now and have ordered an appetizer as well. They get it right away and another 4 people seated at the nearest table are soon ordering. By now we have already finished our appetizer and have been waiting for our hamburgers, the gals next to us receive their sandwiches, those other 4 people we notice are receiving their orders and another table is seated orders also soon  receives food. Where in the world is are hamburgers? Even the couple next to us cannot believe what is going on. We are fed up by now, disgusted, wondering why this is where I wanted to spend my birthday. But thats not it. Then they WOULDNT give us the check. They kept making us wait. We asked for a mgr, they could not find one, then told us one would be back in 20 min., then someone said let us get the head chef which they couldnt find him either. So we figured if we started to walk out maybe that would get someones attention right? A stupid teenage asian hostess girl comes running after us screaming she ran track in high school, like who cares all we wanted to do was get the hell out of that place. We were there over 2hrs,. Finally a nervous mgr appears. No apology, no nothing for the terrible service nothing just gave us the bill. Unbelievable. I hope Guy Fieri is proud of this disaster, because it will be going out of business in this town there are way too many other restaurants with better food and much more class. And employees who treat the customers with respect. And after that damn asian girl was still provoking us she went and called security and the mgr was there he was like why did she even call me? I  told him she is a little immature girl wanting attention. She kept throwing digs and antagonistic remarks at us in front of the mgr., and he allowed her to speak to us that way in front of ALL the other customers. So embarrassing. So unprofessional,  If I could have stooped to her level I wouldve knocked her out. Never in my life in a restaurant have I ever seen such drama, and that mgr allowed his employee to treat the customers like that.

The server did offer a replacement meal, she saw what we were served and was surprised.

For a restaurant that is a BBQ place, they might want to check their timers, it must have been set for 1.4 hours not 14.  Cold slabs of fat with almost no meat, the person that plated it knew it was unacceptable.

626886,2015-02-19,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"This was our one must-do dining experiences in Vegas for the infamous bacon mac-n-cheese burger.  We waited ten minutes to get on the wait list.  We were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes but only took about 15 minutes probably because of the number of people not willing to wait that long.  

Initially service was good, drinks were prompt.  We ordered and waited, and waited.  After 40 minutes, we were informed they were out of turkey burgers and would have to choose something else.  Well, there is not much else on the menu for one that is allergic to hoofed animals.  Finally they substituted unseasoned sliced turkey on the burger.  At that time I communicated my concern about the amount of time we had already waited.  They said they would get right on it and bring it all out.  Fifteen minutes later a server (not our waiter) brought out the food.  It did look amazing, but that's where it ended.  The pulled pork sandwich and bacon mac-n-cheese burger had obviously been sitting in wait of the turkey burger.  Everything was cold and the coleslaw had made the roll completely soggy.  The substitute turkey sandwich was pathetically bland.

I would have mentioned this to our waiter but he became David Copperfield and vanished. We had to flag down other wait staff to ask for something to put on the bland turkey sandwich.  We didn't see our waiter again until he brought out the $80 check for 3 burgers, he never did ask how the food was, I'm sure he knew. They did not even offer menial compensation for substituting as sub-par sandwich in place of a $20 burger.

My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it!

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

Overall great vibe in the restaurant. At first our server greeted us and told us he'll give us a few minutes to decide on what to drink, after we told him that we needed waters all around. Took a good 5-8 minutes to get it. He stopped by after we received our waters and said he'll be right back to take our order. 15 minutes go and still have not ordered. Once we ordered, food came out pretty quickly in about 8-10 minutes. More than halfway through our meal, pops in our server to finally check on us, and had to ask for water refills. 5 minutes go past, and manager approaches us asking how everything was. We told him that we were still waiting for our water to be refilled. Finally refilled. When finished with our meals, we needed to-go boxes, and another 10 minutes of waiting for our server to finally ask for the boxes. I think the manager said something to the server to be more attentive, because attentiveness was barely there until after the manager stopped by. Food was very tasty. Had the pulled pork, general wings, and two almost bland burgers. A bit hard to eat on these warped wooden planks, but cool presentation. 4 stars for food. 1 star for server attentiveness.  3 stars overall.

For appetizers, we ordered The General's Wings. General Tso's chicken, but in wing form. Like a sesame chicken wing fort those unfamiliar with General Tso's chicken. The plate looked lovely and the wings were very crispy, and amazingly good! The crunchy dipping sides of crushed wasabi peas, rice crackers and peanuts added a very enjoyable texture that paired excellently well with each bite! 

For our entree, my girlfriend and I both ordered the Bacon Mac-N-Cheeseburger. All I can say is mouthwateringly delicious!! The idea of having mac and cheese on a burger was genius! The burger itself was juicy and worked very well with the garlic-buttered brioche bun. It was all presented lovely with the side of fries...4 different ways!

Do not get the wings if, you are expecting the nice, subtle heat you would expect from a general tso sauce. The sauce tastes like a mandarin orange sauce, very bitter, not spicy. I would have thought the sauce would be made in house but it seems as if it is a Sysco sauce that has been mass produced. The nachos were okay, not great but, the better of the two items. Not sure about this place, and not sure if I will come back.

No other place cam close. 45 minutes the first morning. 15 minutes the second morning. Just sitting at the ledge overlooking walker-by people. Second morning after 15 I headed into bat to order bloody Mary's. They are excellent just not worth the wait. The location is excellent just not sure worth the wait. Did witness bartender making the drink - not sure I would make the bartender put all accompaniments together each Bloody Mary.

803781,2014-07-23,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"There are few culinary experiences that can adequately prepare you for a layover in flavortown.  Having spent a good portion of my adult life watching Triple D, and with a healthy respect for all that is Guy, I would have been remiss if I didn't make a pilgrimage to the temple of Fieri while on business in Las Vegas.  I would later discover that the decision would be the best of my entire journey through Sin City, and stands as the crowning achievement of the trip.

Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen + Bar is located inside the Quad on the Vegas strip.  Walking in is an experience in visual and aural stimulation, complete with a haphazard blend of memorabilia and celebrity autographed knick knacks stapled on the walls throughout the establishment.  The staff is attentive and eager, even on a slow Monday lunch shift, and I was particularly impressed by the pony tail on one young gentleman working an outdoor seating section of the restaurant.  

My culinary experience, as I had been hoping for, was ""off the chain"".  Being a Triple D fan, it was only natural for me to select the ""Triple B"" burger complete with bacon, bleu cheese, brioche bun, and a healthy helping of Guy's very own ""donkey sauce"".  The concept of portion size has long been proven obsolete, and Guy's burger made my stomach cower in fear.  I struggled to find places to stuff my enormous smoky burger, and enjoyed every minute of the battle.  The extensive beer selection is sure to satisfy any palate and would have left me wanting more were it not for how uncomfortably full I was at the end of my meal.  

The staff at the restaurant are very friendly, engaging, and encouraging when you find yourself torn between the ""Parmageddon Wings"" and the ""Motley Que"".  Our particularly buxom bartender was keen to promote the ""Tapped by Guy"" deal, but my liver and kidneys were on strike and vetoed the idea immediately.  In hindsight I would have told them to get stuffed and pulled the trigger on a 16 beer flight, but I suppose I'll have to save that for my next trip to Vegas. 

All in all, I am ecstatic that I was given the opportunity to experience Guy's kitchen, and I will absolutely be back if I find myself in Vegas again. 

TLDR: This place kicks ass.  Spend every dime you have there. Long live the mayor of flavortown. #SoMuchSalamiCallMyMommy.",c6tHNAllC_rKPtmxST6onw,2,0,5,3lZ6HC1v7t5msKmUZIMo8w

We were instantly greeted and shown our table. Although, we weren't seated at the bar, the bartenders made us feel welcome as we passed by. 

The service was quick and they managed to make conversation despite being packed. My glass was never empty and the servers were kind. 

We ordered the Big Dipper, Triple T fries, Nachos Del Jefe, General's Wings, Margarita Fajita Wings, and Victor's Sweet Tacos. And for dessert we had the Triple Doublemint Pie. We were huge fans of the Margarita Fajita wings, the amazing truffles smothered all over the Triple T fries, Nachos Del Jefe and the Big Dipper. 

The sauce for the Margarita Fajita wings was phenomenal. They almost took this off the menu, but we are so glad that they didn't. It was a sweet and sour sauce with herbs accompanied with perfectly cooked chicken. So worth it! 

My brother loved the Nachos Del Jefe. Everyone else at the table enjoyed it, but didn't believe that it was ""spectacular"". 

Everyone at the table loved the Triple T fries. There were truffles over the fries and within the sauce. There was so much, we couldn't possibly finish all of it, because the portion size was HUGE (which is a great thing). 

The Big Dipper was a great sandwich. The manager came by to inquire about our experience and he informed us that they spent hours cooking the meat to perfection. It was seasoned well, and moist. It's a must try! 

Overall, we enjoyed the food, service and staff. The managers even came by a couple times to personally talk and make us feel welcome while the servers were friendly and consistently checked on us in a pleasant manner.",hYuhpnGe-IDgyqzhOAhUyg,2,2,5,3-w0XM2_Na7-75e12WMgyQ

We only had to wait about 30 minutes for a table on a Friday night, which wasn't too bad. However, the service at the table was extremely slow and our waiter was not attentive or apologetic for taking too long to bring our food and the check. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out between appetizer and entrée, and then our waiter mysteriously disappeared for about 30 more minutes without any explanation at all.

The food was in some ways what we expected from Guy Fieri - big, loud, over the top and bold. The Vegas fries were a great appetizer with a delicious hot sauce, but our entrees (burgers and sandwiches) were far too large to be easily eaten, and the seasoning was overpowering. ""Light"" is definitely not a word I'd use to describe anything on the menu.

Location is good and patio view is nice.

Our service was very poor.  15 minutes before drink order was taken.  
Another 10 before food was ordered.  After the server delivered the food, that was it for service.   The waiter never showed up again.  We had to go to the waiter station for service.  No second beverage offered.

The food was tasty however very over priced for what was served.  The Mac and cheese burger tasted well but was dried out.  The fries are over seasoned.  It is like eating the crumbs from the bottom of a bag of bbq chips.
Chicken wings were good except that the larger ones were raw and bleeding in the center.

Ketchup would have helped the fries and burger go down but apparently there is a shortage here. You get approximately one package served in a small container.  No opportunity to get more because Raymond was too busy elsewhere (visiting with other staff).  The wings went uneaten and were removed from the bill. No apology or resolution.

No way to really say it but Ed was a total douche.

She never gets to choose a place again.

* When we walked in, we were told it would be ""about 10 minutes"" to get a table. That 10 minutes became a little over 45.
* She ordered a Coke, and I ordered a beer ... and had to go through four options on the menu before landing on one they had in stock. Of course, they brought her a Pepsi without asking if it was an acceptable substitute (which, in her opinion, it is not).
* The description of the chili cheese fries sounded calorie-laden but worth it, and we decided to try it. The cheese on top was terrific, the fries themselves were average, the chili was terrible (apparently they think that over-spicing makes a quality recipe). By the time we stopped, we both had indigestion or heartburn or both.
* We each ordered a burger with small modifications (we each wanted something left off our burgers) and the waitress didn't write anything down. When she got distracted by another waiter, I figured she might mix up the details and asked if she wanted to write it down. She assured me that she had it memorized ... so of course, both of our orders were wrong. She not only didn't leave off what I wanted eliminated (pickles), she actually ADDED mushrooms -- I'm allergic to mushrooms and have never asked for them in my life. 
* Because we were in a rush to get to an event that night, we decided to make the best of it and eat what we had not ordered but had been delivered (after scraping off the mushrooms as much as I could). The burgers were .... awful. Greasy and completely void of flavor. Fell apart inside the bun when lifted. My colleague, who is a lot nicer than I am, even said, ""if he has a TV show, shouldn't he have better food than this?""
* Then the bill came. Two burgers, one order of chili cheese fries, one beer, one Pepsi ... for 78 DOLLARS??? Yes, things in Vegas are more expensive than in many other cities, but that's ridiculous. 

Bad service by staff who were uninterested and inattentative. Insanely overpriced. Food that could generously be called mediocre. I don't know if Guy Fieri is an actual chef, or just a TV personality, but it's hard to believe he would attach his name to this place. Las Vegas has lots of good and great restaurants.

We also asked for ranch for our appetizers which never came even after asking 3 times along with lemons. We also asked for the lemons multiple times and where told after about the 4th time that there were none. Finally when our food arrived one of the burgers was missing toppings and had mayonnaise which if he had written down the order wouldn't have happened. Perhaps the worst part of my expirences was that instead of worrying about his  paying customers the waiter was helping someone on the outside that was picking food off of others plates and gave her a box to take the food with her.

This is my second time dining here and each time, the fries were the highlight of my meal. (Truffle fries are the best!) I always order their Caesar salad as it's the only vegetarian friendly meal they offer. It's a really savory salad that comes in great proportions! I really dislike that giant crouton it comes with, though. It looks like a bread bowl that takes up almost half the plate and is INCREDIBLY hard, basically a rock. I shouldn't need a steak knife to eat my salad. Trying to cut pieces off that giant crouton is a task making it feel as if it's not meant to be eaten. However, I don't expect to eat the best salad at Guy Fieri's restaurant LOL. 
Their Bloody Mary's are awesome! You get to choose on a level of 1-5 how spicy you want yours to be, though be advised they tend to run on the spicier side. I ordered a 2 which is supposed to be lightly spicy but was rather a medium level of spicy. Still super good! Its garnish for dinner time consists of a generous sized stalk of celery accompanied with a raspberry, a cherry, a few olives & jalapeños. 
Though I haven't tried them myself, my friends love to order the burgers here which come in huge proportions and make the best pre-drinking meal.

We arrived on a Friday night (August 26) at 7:30 p.m. - yes there was a 50-60 minute wait, which was of course expected and to no fault of the restaurant! 

My wife and I were waiting in their small designated area for about 45 minutes when I went to the washroom. I come back to see my wife extremely shaken-up and looking on the verge of tears. Turns out, the manager (tall, dark hair, big guy) had literally screamed at her, in front of a large crowd, claiming she was harassing staff and telling her just how horrible of a person she is. Loudly proclaiming just how much he doesn't tolerate ""bulls!t"" and how ""sick people like you make me."" After almost a minute of abuse and very confused, she asks what she did to deserve this public humiliation, he finally realizes she was NOT with the intoxicated group in question and he had the wrong person. He says a casual ""oh, it wasn't you, my bad"" and walks off. Excuse me? 

About to leave the restaurant after I find this out, the hostess comes by and profusely apologizes, and says the manager had to go do something, but will be coming over to our table to apologize properly in a few minutes and asks that we please stay. My wife and I decide to stay (not sure why, now that I think about it). The abusive manager never comes back. 

Our meal came, which was absolutely horrible. Honestly, even if this had not happened, this food was not edible. My wife had a laughable salad called ""Italian Deli"" that came out with pickles (not pickled Italian veggies... pickles), wrapped in a cold piece of prosciutto. I had the ""Mayor of Flavortown burger"" - overcooked, dry patty that was served with fries that look like they came out of a frozen bag from Walmart. Horrible.

It's a shame, we were actually huge Guy Fieri fans before this - yes it's ridiculous to think that it's ""his or his brand's fault"" that this despicable human being of a manager did what he did, and the food came out inedible, but we're definitely done with anything ""Guy"". 

If ever this manager reads his Yelp reviews: you should be ashamed of yourself.",nRfJBg-4MwxtJG4-TgnFow,0,1,1,q5XYfb61m2koPwho7MKJUw

Disappointed not only with the burger, but with the entire experience. When I asked my server I was told that the pepper was in the burger patty itself. The cocktail I ordered, cucumber and melon should have been cold, instead it was tepid, almost warm and could should have been strained.

My peeves about our experience:

1) Prices on the menu are not what you pay unless you are some type of loyalty member.  Not that big of a deal but this is something our server should have explained.  (Non member prices push your bill about 25% higher in our experience)

2) No restroom.  Need to use casino restroom. (I assume employees can wash their hands onsite :) )

3) Service:  they seem to be trying hard, us, and some other tables had to go to the bar to get a second drink. (Wasn't terribly busy)

We ordered the Won Tacos for an appetizer, which was recommended by our server.  The right amount of heat on tuna tacos. I could have just eaten a couple more of these and had been happy.  Very good.
I ordered the Double Barrel BBQ wings.  I was initially skeptical because I thought that the effort to make them ""lollipop"" wings (pushing all of the meat to one end of the bone) was to disguise something was missing.  But I was wrong, they were delicious all around.
It's a burger joint, so we had to order a burger.  my girl got the Smash Burger, which was great.  The plating was again fun, a little bit heavy on the salt-side but nothing overwhelming.

The wait one Saturday for 2 over the Fourth of July weekend was about 30 minutes. There isn't much of a waiting area and they only take your first name.  If you're not crowded near the hosts' stand you may not hear your name. Another couple tried to take my spot. Once seated,  the service was great. There were enough misting hoses to make sitting outside comfortable. 
The food though- you'll either love it or hate it. 
There is absolutely no way you can walk out of here feeling satisfied without devouring over a couple of day's worth of fat and cholesterol.  We tried the Fireball Whiskey wings and they were too sweet and dry but the highlight of our food. We had the Cajun and Motley Que, both were very over the top. It was a carnival of flavors that did not blend well. It's like they put the whole kitchen sink in each entree so there's no subtly of flavors. Just a mix and fat and wackiness. We could not enjoy the food. I enjoy curious flavors and trying new food, but this is smothered oil, gravies and sauces all in one topped with whatever can be fried. This will probably delight many but disgust others. If you're after heartattck type food, you'll love it. If on the other hand you're looking for a good burger, anything at Gordon Ramsays Burger tops this place. 
I've been to many of the places in various cities that were featured in Diners Drive ins &Dives. I enjoyed each one of those over this place.

The selection was only around eight things to choose from.  That was kind of a downer. I think when you go to a good restaurant they ask you how you want your burger to be cooked and this place did not. unfortunately I don't think the added macaroni in a burger is worth the $20 charge for a burger and fries which normal places you'd pay anywhere from 10 to 15 bucks. I think that five dollars extra is just going to Guys pocket which is why he's driving a Lamborghini and you reading are driving a Honda Civic. Overall I probably won't be back if I want to grab a burger I will definitely go to Gordan Ramsay's restaurant down the street, cheers!!",5fyWR-fHqD24Fnb5YhHWmA,0,0,2,b6QlMetxubH0C1x39k5K5Q

The restaraunt is very nice and the open kitchen rocks.  The wait staff was fun and attentative.  

All of the decor, uniforms, menu and experience  totalled up to be very Guyish.  Dug it. 

Our meals, however, were a bit up and down.  I'll describe each meal and dish seperately. 

LUNCH: 

2 people - 0 wait time

App: 
Ultimate Chicken wrap - this was very good.  Consisted of a few small egg rolls, a few chicken skewers, and lettuce wraps with three sauces (spicy sweet/sour, soy, satay).  This was a great start to the meal. 

Meal: 
Tatted-Up Turkey Burger.  It is big and awesome.  Great flavor. This comes with a medley of fries with a very good seasoning.  I, now, have a mission to find ancho bacon.  

IMPRESSION: This was a great experience.  My wife and I loved our meal.  

DINNER: 

5 people - 20 minute wait time

App: 
Rojo Rings:   Both of these were brought out quickly.  The onion rings were good and crispy.  They had good seasoning on the batter and the sauce was great.   

Nachos Del Jefe: The Nachos (holy batman!) were killer.  These little chips are a sublime mix of mild chorizo and cheese that bring flavortown down to it's knees praying.  They are that good.

Meal:

Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger: Friend had this and loved it.  

Victors Street Tacos: very average and small.  the tortilla's weren't really prepped at all. Friend stated that this was bland and needed more salsa. 

The Motley Que Sandwich: This was were the rails came off.  This sandwich is an exact replica of the Deli Cowboy from Jason's Deli.  It is a very saucy pulled pork.  All you can taste is a BBQ that I would expect any Joe Blow to be able to prep in their crock pot.  To make matters worse, the waitress stated that this sandwich was the absolute best thing on the menu.  I don't think the chick from Vegas knows what real BBQ should be.  When you have tp pay $20 bucks for it, it just makes you disappointed.  

Dessert: 

S'mores Monte Cristo: This was ok.  It looks cool, but it came accross too greasy.  it is really big and all in all, too much grease and sweetness to eat all of it.... even for 5 of us sharing one dessert.  

I would have marked this a 5 after lunch... but, a few pieces of the dinner made this a big dip.  That Pulled Pork sandwich should really, really be re-considered.",yH9hR4xik16HLQ8Wm4nuoQ,0,0,3,Wga2ZqafcAj3CWsEG2ZOig

I've told myself to stay away from foo foo non traditional burgers and I've been grilling them at home recently because I've been so disappointed lately. My favorite burger in LA is Pie and Burger in Pasadena so you can have an idea what I like.

Wifey wanted to hit this up. I had low expectations. We ordered the regular burger (forgot the name but it had BBQ sauce). Now I would normally not get bbq sauce but this burger was tasty. The bread was soft and fresh (so important). The meat was super juicy and not overcooked. Perfect amount of condiments to keep it all moist and together. Loved the different fries on the side. Already seasoned and came out piping hot and fresh. I was so impressed with the burger.

We sat at the bar to avoid waiting. Wifey loved her lemon drop drink and I appreciated the proper Guiness pulls on my draft. Also had the fireball wings. They were okay. Good concept and I love how they cut them up and push em up before cooking like those asian style wings. I'm just more of a fried wing kinda guy. Liked the wasabi blue cheese sauce.

I had the beef brisket plate. The meat was very dry, and it did not have enough sauce.  The fries were good, it was a mixture of crispy seasoned fries, crinkle fries fries, and chiplike fries. The toast it came with was okay, nothing special at all. As for the coleslaw that was atop the brisket, it was just that. Sliced up cabbage with what seemed like no dressing.

I have to say I really, really wanted to like Guy Fieri. We were hanging out at the Linq on a Tuesday and saw his sign. I suggested it, and after some discussion, we we headed over. There were a few couples in line, but it wasn't a terrible wait. When we checked in she said, Oh, we have a table being cleaned right now. It should only take 10-15 minutes. (???) We only had 2 in our party, and exactly 9 people who arrived after us were seated before us. I even went back to the desk to ask if they had missed us. They have tables that are just for 2, and that's what they were waiting on. The tables are like not even a foot away from the next set of 2 people. It was like having dinner with 2 strangers. Really, really weird. I understand maximizing space, but the waitress could barely even get between to hand them their food/bill, etc. I noticed several tables that are in weird configurations - like a set of 3 people who were all sitting facing out, away from each other. Weird. There were plenty of tables that were open, but they hadn't been cleaned.

And speaking of clean, it has huge beautiful windows that face Harrah's. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. The floors were covered in food and, like I mentioned, lots of tables were just hanging out, dirty. When they are a foot away from you, it's kinda yuck.

On to the food! This is my first (and probably last) Guy restaurant. We've tried out a lot of suggestions from Diners, Drive Ins and Dives so I thought Guy would know what he was doing. This is clearly a restaurant he's hoping will just make it off his name alone.  Your choices are basically sandwiches, salads, wings, burgers and fries. The appetizer section was nearly all fries...which is weird because your order comes with fries. A few of the appetizers we saw come out looked really cute - they are definitely plated well. But after reviewing the menu, there wasn't anything we wanted to try. 

So, I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger because it said it was an award winner. I mean, seriously. How could you go wrong? But, alas, there was absolutely nothing remarkable about it. It had fried onions, pickles, bacon, mac and cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato. It was big. I asked for knife to cut it in half. I think it looked bigger because it's stuffed full with so much shredded lettuce. But, it was extremely dry. Maybe the driest burger I have ever had. EVER. I asked for extra ketchup and mayo. You'd think it'd be dripping with mac and cheese, but no. The bun was falling apart. The mac and cheese was drier than the blue box stuff I refuse to buy, even when it's on sale for 69 cents, and, in all honesty, you really didn't even notice it was there. I pulled the buns apart to find the mac and cheese bite, just to make sure I was actually getting some. The bacon was nearly completely off my burger, almost like they forgot it and shoved it in there later. I also asked it to be cooked medium, but she said all burgers come out medium well. Hmmm. Interesting for a place that pretty much only does burgers. The burger itself was thin. It came with fries - a bunch of types mixed together. Those were good. A combo of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some seasoning. My hubby also ordered a burger. He didn't even eat it. The waitress joked she'd bring us a box so we could take it home and feed it to the dog. No, seriously. She did.

Our waitress was good. She was friendly, and pretty attentive until we got our food, which came out pretty fast.  Took a while to get our bill (it was $56 for 2 burgers and 2 beers). A manager came by to see how our food was, but he seemed so uncomfortable talking to people and in a hurry. He said ""How was everything?"" By the time we said ""good"" and he was already headed off. Shouldn't have bothered.

The amount of other good reviews leaves me scratching my head. Are they fake? Did they go on a different night when there was a Master Chef in town? Is breakfast waaay better than dinner? I don't have the answers.

There are so many places to choose, I definitely recommend skipping this one. But if you go, don't forget your Total Rewards card. They'll give you a discount. I think it was a dollar an item, but hey... after eating, you'll be glad you saved a few bucks.",n4TZSTUWKfKNsFHMxpAtOQ,4,2,2,-q2JiH7dp1uLjNQzh5ivEw

First I have to say that I am a HUGE Guy Fieri fan so was very excited to eat at one of his restaurants...that being said, I should have waited to make it to California before I ate at one of his restaurants... 

From the start it was an awkward place to go, when we went to put our name in to be seated our name were not taken and we were told that we could wait in the seats around the corner out of the Hostesses view.  We sat there for a second then opted to stand in the tiny waiting area as we were not confident she would remember that we were there.  

We were escorted to our table and given very awkward planks of wood with the menu items on it (in the style of a clipboard).   Once we decided on what we wanted we waited...and waited...and waited for our server.  When he got there we both ordered the tacos (the chicken and steak respectively).  I was impressed by the burgers so I didn't think about taco size.  

When they arrived I was FLOORED - for $16 I got 4 small tacos....appetizer size!.  I looked in disbelieve at my tacos compared to the burgers.  I wasn't expecting huge tacos but the were so small that I asked if maybe we accidentally got the kids size tacos.  Nope those were the adult tacos.

Once breakfast was delivered steak was dry and over salted to the point of being like jerky. 2 other tables served by same waitress were also misplaced. How do you f**k up breakfast?! Just ask douche bag Guy. I had my doubts, but thought I would give it a try, lesson learned. Saw servers clustered and chatting throughout my wait time. Restaurant had only 8 tables seated and still couldn't handle it. SKIP this place, way too many other better options on the strip. ""Flavortown"" is mostly salt and regret, be warned. BTW this is my first Yelp review, I usually let things slide and know that food reviews are very subjective. I wanted to like this place but the overall attitude was ""I just don't give a F*ck here"". For the prices charged, they really should.

Overall pretty busy night and thus there was a wait. No problem. Found a spot at the bar and grabbed a drink - expensive but it's Vegas and your not at a table gambling so expect higher prices. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed with the traffic though there were certainly plenty of them. (Brittany at the bar was gorgeous but that is another story). 

About 30 minutes later seated to a tiny table backed up to a tall dividing wall making table space seem very small and a bit claustrophobic which was strange as whole restaurant bar seemed pretty open and inviting. 

Onto the food - had two things at the table - the pulled pork sandwich (famous from triple-d) and the bacon Mac n cheese burger. The sandwich was healthy portion on a long pretzel roll. Had slaw and pickles on it as well. For a $20 sandwich you can do much better but the pork was tender although a bit sweet. 

My buddy had the Mac burger and said it was excellent. Even though it sounded incredibly rich, he said it was light leading me to believe that is had been prepared really well and not overdone with the cheese so it was too dense. 

Both of us got the fries and they were a bit cold and not too exciting. They were strange in that they were all different shapes and sizes from shoestring to steak fry to waffle fries. Just strange. 

Not sure that I will be back other than for the scenery but overall an average Vegas destination. If you are a Caesars rewards member you get a $1 or so off each entree. Just saying.",uhd9OA8RidwPEW77gUJunQ,1,0,3,XyfM0T82SCBo7VHCdHDxxw

I wanted to order that, but I didn't want to look like a jackass ordering so I ordered the Original Ringer.  

Mayor of flavortown?  Give it a rest.  You go to a restaurant for the food and the ambiance...not necessarily the person that owns the restaurant.  The food is top-notch and the ambiance is awesome.  You could literally drink there for relatively cheap at the bar and then party on the strip.

We ordered the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers and the Righteous Rojo Rings for an appetizer. We loved it, and couldn't get enough! Finally something different!

Another one of my favorite are the Fireball Whiskey Wings. The blue-sabi sauce that comes with it is divine! 
The fries! OMG! The best fries I ate in the United States for sure. They come in different sizes and styles... a must try! 

I especially like the unique way the food is presented. Each menu item has a different kind of set up. I love eating with my eyes, and I was satisfied for sure.

My buddy ordered chicken fried bacon and eggs.  I'm going to say they were ""MONEY"" again to be smart ass.  It looked awful and I'm guessing by how much was left at the end that it wasn't good

I'm sure he would love his money back for this ""MONEY"" dish.  Overcooked breaded bacon, rock hard biscuit, and average eggs.

I ordered a burrito.  It was just OK.  Nothing special - eggs, potatoes, sausage....blah blah blah.  Nothing I've not had before.  I would rather it had been smaller and a bit more than just ""MONEY"" (sorry). Our bill with coffees was around 50 bucks.

There are so many choices that this could easily be passed up with no effort.",QQWUT71d6p6wOn7EpId4TA,7,2,2,rfbw4U9tYxe1M9BjCj_yDw

The staff was super attentive; always refilling water and coffee, and checking that we were doing well. 

We sat outside to eat, but also at the bar for a moment while we waited for our table.

The food. Man oh man. I had the benedict and my husband had the chilaquiles. Exquisite!! Both had such a nice presentation too. My Benedict had such yummy chili; just a little spicy but then the sour cream around the plate mellowed it out. The chilaquiles portion was pretty big, and the meat was tender and delicious!

Being a fan of the ""Triple D"" show I was happy to find Guy's place at the LINQ. Although, I really wanted to like this place I couldn't get myself to give this place a rating higher than 2 stars.

To be fair we were headed to The Hash House but had to leave because the wait was over an hour for breakfast. Looking for an alternative we walked by Guy Fieri's Food and decided to drop in. There wasn't a line and we were seated right away. On the recommendation of the waiter I ordered Chicken Fried Bacon, eggs on a buttermilk biscuit with country gravy. The waiter described the Chicken Fried Bacon as a thick cut bacon battered like a chicken fried steak. So I thought thick cut bacon, who wouldn't like thick cut bacon? When the plate came out it looked good. However, after I took my first bite it wasn't what I was expecting. The bacon wasn't thick cut, it was a regular piece of bacon that was covered in a lot of batter and deep fried. After the first bite I peeled off all of the batter from the bacon. The biscuit was huge and dry. The flavor of the biscuit was good but was too dry, so much so I could only eat 1/2 of one side. The eggs were over done and not seasoned. The country gravy had good flavor but didn't have any sausage or ham in it. To top it all off the service was slooooow. I couldn't understand why it took so long to take our order (the breakfast menu isn't very big), bring out drinks and deliver the food. The place wasn't very busy at all but the service seem particularly slow.

Overall the food wasn't and service weren't  good. The price was way too high even for a strip hotel restaurant.

Although, I wouldn't recommend this place or go back for breakfast, I'll keep watching the show.

Everything was on salt overload.  My pulled pork had way too much mayo and Drew's sand which was so salty from the sausage and the sauce he couldn't finish it. 

I will say, the potatoes we had were AMAZING, beer selection and service saved this place for me.  

I would probably skip lunch and just do happy hour here.

Finally, the hostess was the singularly most unhappy person we met in Vegas. Not a crack or hint of a smile. She obviously hates her job and no one will call her out on it.  If you're in a service industry you better learn to fake some kind of interest. I watched her while we were there walk everyone to their table, slap down menus, and walk away without even so much as ""enjoy"".  Bad impression from the get go in a place like this.

There seems to be a never-ending line around peak meal times (I heard a customer say that they waited 3 hours to get seated. Three. Hours.), so we delayed our lunch time and sauntered in around 2PM. No lines. 1 minute wait while they cleaned a table for us. No pain.

As soon as we sat down, I already knew what I wanted -- the bacon mac and cheese burger. One of my weaknesses is mac and cheese, so of course I had to have it. The burger is massive -- piled high with a patty, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and of course, the mac and cheese and bacon. Sadly, the patty was a bit thin and dry compared to other burgers I've had. Maybe I can ask for it to be medium rare next time... The flavor of everything else was good but not foodgasmic. I'm glad to have tried it, but I'm not sure I would drop $20 for it again.

I like that they give a variety of fries on the side -- skinny cut, thick cut, waffle cut... all perfectly seasoned with a side of ketchup.

Service is superb. Our server was extremely friendly and came around as much as he could to check on us.

As far as burgers go, though, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR still wins for now. Sorry, Guy.",Ok4JzVqlcGmQ0ZzoIld8aA,2,1,3,N1nMc2HGe2QSl9K0X7SOuQ

Got seated outside on the patio which happens to be close to the Harrah's outdoor stage next door. The music was so loud you couldn't hear someone three seats away. The sandwiches are expensive $18, $19, $20. I had the ""Mayor of Flavortown"" which is pastrami on a burger patty with a pretzel bun. Was it good? Yeah, it was pretty good. Was it worth $19? Um, no. It does come with fries which, in my case anyway, were not very hot and were over seasoned to the point that I didn't eat many of them.
The trend in Vegas now is to slap a famous chef's name on a place and jack up the price on otherwise close to ordinary bar food. I'd say that sums up my experience here. To be fair, our service was pretty good and, although not quick, the food didn't take an excessive amount of time to come out.",y971YKIxY4znwY2mFGyXog,0,0,2,aVpWQ4XfMecSHTDfkox3qQ

We just wanted to get a quick bite and ended up sharing a veggie burger because the prices were so steep. $20 for the burger and fries. Each drink was at least 10$ so we easily spent $100. There was a group of older men that kept trying to talk to us. We were having a decent  conversation and then it took a turn for the worse. Tried to hint to the bartenders that we were uncomfortable. For some reason Mike not only didnt pick up on these cues but he continued to be really rude. Ie: we had finished our burger but was still working on the fries. We were also taking ""bomb"" style drinks so I had my napkin in my hand on the bar counter. Mike asked me if i was still using it. I said yes and put it on my lap. Not even 10 min later he came by and was like ""can i get that napkin?!"" So i gave it back and ended up using my sleeve.  I just couldn't believe that. Its all good though because Frank talked to me for a good 10min even though I knew he was busy working. And when one of the creepy guys tried coming up to me I just ignored him and continued to talk to Frank. The guy got the hint and went back to his table. Wish I could come back and try the bloody marys or other dishes. My friend is a vegetarian so thats why I chose to split the black bean burger. It was just OK -dry- and the fries were severely oversalted. Just a hint to Mike, when you're on the strip, your customer service goes a long way. Why would I choose to come back here and spend $100s when I can spend the same amount and eat somewhere else where I will be treated with enough respect to use my damn napkin as long as I see fit.

I love the vibe of this whole restaurant. From the really big ice cubes they serve with your drinks, the design of silverware, to the uniforms that the workers have to wear, this restaurant is so fun!

I ordered Guy-talian Fondue Dippers as an appetizer, which were so good dipped into the smoky provolone cheese dip. I ordered a Tatted-Up Turkey Burger as my entree. The pretzel bun was really good, and the burger itself was huge! My favorite part is their fires. They mix several different types of fries together, which I think is really fun. The only thing is that they don't serve a lot of fries with the entree and I definitely could have eaten more of them. I also dipped my fries into the left over smoky provolone dip and it was really tasty. 

The second time I went it was late at night so they had a smaller A La Carte menu. I order the Southern Smothered Chili Bowl, and a side of fries. The fries were the same mixture as the first time! The chili bowl was really good, but the corn bread wasn't anything special like I had hoped.

The crispy onions were great on top of the sandwich, the horseradish was ""on point"" but man, I gotta tell ya, the prime rib was just too fatty.

Listen, I know that fat = flavor so you have to leave some of that in there to make a good tasting sandwich.  And I wanted so bad to eat all of it because the flavor was great.  It was just too fatty; it felt like I was eating more fat than meat.

The portions are HUGE and you would assume the price tag for a portion of that size would be on the pricier side - but it's not. 

You would expect quality taste...I mean it's Guy Fieri, right? Fortunately, for me, his restaurant and the quality of flavor meets that expectation. And at the end of it all, I was so stuffed that I didn't have any room for dessert (bummer).

The cucumber martini was so refreshing and just the right amount of alcohol. 

The lobster lollipops (appetizer) were well made. The batter was light and fluffy. The lobster was cooked to perfection. I liked the sauce that was in the lollipops the best. 

The burger was ... amazing. The thick bacon, scoop of Mac and cheese, well cooked burger and special sauce made the burger to die for.

The wait time was alright (45 minutes). It was a tad bit shorter than that. We were all hungry and we were already here because we were listening to a good friend playing outside with the band.

Our server comes to us and takes our order... I get the mayor of flavortown. pastrami, burger, slaw, cheese, and onion straws. Pastrami was dry. almost to jerky status. Burger was somewhat dry. The chuck was seasoned very well. I believe the sauce was a garlic butter based sauce. This happened to be pretty good. Pretzel bun also complimented the size of the burger and held it together. The amount of meat you get is gargantuan. Could this burger be good? YES. This burger has the most amount of potential. If the pastrami was a couple mm thicker and if the burger was cooked to a medium like I asked this burger would have been phenomenal. Not only that but it took about 30 minutes to get our food which is slightly ridiculous.

The fries on the other hand were grrreat. They had barbeque seasoning and made it amazing. It was not overwhelming thankfully.

The waitress gave us a hard time with splitting checks. So I am not sure if this is a company policy but the waitress had to her manager to run this transaction. Not only does it make the payment easier for the cashier, a lot of math doesn't have to be done on the customers behalf.

Made with brisket (being from Memphis we loved that), and fresh (not pickled!!!) jalapeños. We chose the bacon Mac n cheese burger, and that was the consensus favorite by the 4 of us. The other burger we chose was the turkey burger, which is unique in the fact that it is made with a slice of turkey rather than a patty.

Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers- pepperoni is wrapped around a breadstick. It comes with fondue dipping sauce which is really good but the breadsticks are just okay. 

Nachos- very different than any other nachos I've ever had. We ordered ours without beans and jalapeños. The chips are a little harder than normal which I think is good because they don't get soggy with all the toppings. One thing I liked....each chip had a good amount of toppings. Not like other places where the topping are in the middle and most chips and plain. It's a big portion, three people could share easily. 

Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger- on the first visit I had this burger and then my friend had it I on my second visit. We both had the same complaint...the macaroni wasn't even on the burger. When you get to the second half, there was barely any. 

Motley Que Sandwich- BBQ pulled pork on a pretzel bun. I asked for no citrus slaw but it was on there instead of the onions :( I didn't mention it though. Nice BBQ option...beware it's messy lol! The fries are very good!

What I like most about the restaurant...the staff. They really do care about your experience! Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. 


Bring a total rewards card and you'll save a few dollars! They sell Guy's merchandise in the front of the store. 


Price: On the first visit our bill for an appetizer, two entrees, water, and a soda came to $72.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,5,1,3,EehKqB74QSuKj74HBsix2g

I have loved him ever since he first appeared on the Next Food Network Star.  I was so eager to go to his place!  Me and my Girl went on a Thursday night and guess who won?  I did because low and behold he was there with his family and his entourage!!!!  We arrive outside a quaint part of the strip what I like to call the ""strip inside the Strip"" the boardwalk underneath the high roller.  We are told we have to wait an hour but to our surprise it was only maybe a half hour.  The place was exactly what I thought it would be and that was Awesome!  Kinda reminded me of like an extension of his Big Bite Set.  Guy and his family were eating on the outside patio.  I have never seen him in person and so I get pretty nervous thinking I might just get to meet the man and eat at his restaurant the same night.  OH yeah this is a food review.  I had the Onion Ring deal, the BBQ sandwich.  They were both off the hook as explained in the menu's.  The BBQ was a hoagie roll with pulled pork and slaw topped with a very Whiskyish BBQ sauce.  Awesome non the less and the O rings with the rémoulade... Well let's just use the man himself s expression.  ""MONEY!""  My woman had the Whiskey Wings.  They were HOT but really good.  Like hot Tabasco Lollipop's... Pleased with the staff, food and atmosphere.  Oh yeah.  Did I meet Guy?  well as you would expect he was having Family time but, did manage to get up every so often to cruise his guest.  He was just very bombarded when this would happen.  I am not the type of fan who will go over to the table or swarm him for a Selfie Bomb however, He did at one time Go behind the bar to buy the whole bar shots and my Girl Vicki decided to go back there to talk to him.  she asked if he would take a PIC with us and he politely replied ""of course if you will get out from behind my Bar (smiling)""  well, I didn't want to wait in the swarm of people to get just a photo bomb with him so I passed finished my meal and while my girl didn't like it as much as I did.  I give it a 5 Star rating.  Love it and hope to return soon or even sooner!... P.S. about a year later I was working the Sammy Hagar concert at the D Casino and running to one of the booths to fix a computer and ran (literally) into Guy himself.  He needed help with getting some club soda for his drink that was way too strong.  I let him behind the bar in one of the cooler tents... Thanked him and he went on his way Later that night I met all of his crew and then him and he is a awesome down to earth guy.

The presentation of the food itself was great, but the food tasted just ok. We tried nachos, the generals chicken wings, truffle fries and fondue dippers. The chicken wings were yummy to the tummy. It was the favorite of the table! Fondue dippers just didn't have enough pepperoni in it. It sounds better on the menu. The truffle fries were pretty good. The flavor was on point and I love truffle and more truffle! The nachos looked so good. The barbecue sauce seem to overpower the nachos.

Boyfriend and I was super stoked when we found out that Guy have a restaurant in the strip. I watched his shows here and there but my boyfriend loves him. Lol, literally. Anyways we decided to eat here for lunch and the wait was about 25-30 minutes. Not bad considering how packed it was.

I wasn't too hungry so I got the general's wings and my boyfriend got the original ringer burger with bacon. By the way, we loved how they have pepsi. HUGE PLUS. Anyways, didn't take long for food to come out, but wow presentation was great. For my wings at least. My boyfriend loved the burger.

It definitely tasted like something I've never taste before, which is a good thing. Unique. But I just can't put my finger on it, the taste of the wings were sweet and tangy. Hard to explain but it goes really well with the peanut they provided. I didn't finish the wings but if I could, I would give it a 7/10. Not my kind of taste bud but could be someone's else.

Hearing a lot of buzz about the bacon mac n cheese burger, it was something that I was gonna try first time out. So me and the lady both got the bacon mac n cheese burger, the triple t fries, and the fondue dippers. Let's start with the sides. The fondue dippers was great, it was very flavorful, the fondue was light and cheesy.  The triple t fries were great! I would say one of the top truffle fries I have tried. Definitely a thing to try when coming here. Now here's the thing with the bacon mac n cheese burger, I read that it was one of Guy fieri's award winning burgers. The bacon was cooked great and tasted great. The burger was also tasty and cooked and seasoned well. Now the mac n cheese was a huge let down, the burger is complex and has so much flavors in the bacon and the burger seasoned to perfection, then you put mac n cheese that has been sitting under a heat lamp, dried out, clumpy and very bland on it and it just about ruins it. As great as everything else was on the burger, the mac n cheese just brought the burger down. I dont mind paying $20 for a burger as I love food and trying new things. I just dont understand why the short cut?? I know time is pressed and everything needs to be done as quickly as possible, but when quality gets sacrificed things need to be reevaluated. Also the burger does come with fries (a mixture of crinkle cut, straw fries, waffle fries, and chips???) but you cannot substitute the fries that come with the burger for the likes of the triple t fries, forcing you to buy an entire order if you wanted. Although the fries are a huge order and I was glad I got them maybe having the option to substitute the region fries that come with the burgers for them would be a good idea. So for around $75 for me and my lady it was expensive but in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. Sadly the only way I would ever get the bacon mac n cheese burger would be if Guy himself made it to his standards and maybe then it Will be the great burger that it is claimed to be.",i7K3PDFJzXJSebzCj8UYJw,0,0,3,ZWdYE6WroI_xADbzC89fgA

I had the Original Smash Burger and my friend had the Tatted Turkey Burger.  The meat patties are larger than the bun. They also come with assorted french fries which I love.  My burger was delicious however if I order a burger again I would order it Medium as all burgers are made medium well. I wish my burger had more bbq sauce on it, however I devoured it so fast I didn't have time to ask for an extra side.  The turkey burger was good as well but not as good as the the smash burger.
The portions are healthy so unless you are with a group it is hard to even want to order and appetizer.
We shared the fried ice cream sundae.  A terrific idea, since I love deep fried ice cream and think the best one comes from El Torito when they use chocolate chip ice cream.  The idea was good execution poor.  It comes with a side of caramel syrup, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, bananas and peanut butter, pineapple, and strawberries.  All the sides were great it was just the fried shell was not up to par.  The cornflakes were bland and seemed stale tasting.  Maybe needing to be fried longer or something.

1631235,2014-06-19,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"""Expensive, but, it IS on the Strip""

One of the first questions I asked our server was, ""Why are the prices SO high?"" She said right off because they're on the strip - although you need to walk around the place into the Quad to find the entrance. As for prices, for their selections, especially the burgers, I have seen lower prices at various hotels along the Strip in Las Vegas.

The burgers: With so many options for burgers along the Strip, I have become very picky about the taste of the MEAT in the burger, rather than just all the fancy toppings that places have been putting on their burgers to entice one to order. Three of us ordered three different burgers, and surprisingly, the meat on all three tasted different, and not from the toppings. We actually talked extensively about the different tastes of the meat alone, not the burger as a whole. So, while the burgers are overpriced, they were good. Many of my Las Vegas meat experiences have been that the meat is okay, just no special flavors in the meat itself. The burgers taste came mostly from the toppings.

The fries were fries, although their standard fries that come with the burger are a mix of three - waffle, curly, and regular.

Drinks - both non-alcoholic as well as the alcoholic - are very pricey.

Service was good.

Overall it was a ""standard"" Las Vegas establishment: pricey and themed. Although, I must say we were impressed with the quality and taste of the burger meat. (Which is why they got star #4.) However, I probably won't go back without a BOGO.",PpSuSHh-_sN-9VPYyQMWAA,0,0,4,cAravUAUg5ExnfaG-xVhPg

1635825,2016-07-12,5,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"It's like Guy Fieri walked into a room in The LINQ.  Suddenly, somebody lit his hair on fire.  It rapidly burned down like a fuse.  And then, he exploded.

That appears to be how Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar was decorated.

The staff then found a stray pool of his blood, and used it as ink to write the menu -- All the while being possessed by his ghost, which was summoned by watching ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" in reverse on an upside down television.

What I'm getting at:  If you know anything about Guy Fieri, you'll know what to expect.  And you may even enjoy it, if you're the type to walk into a Hooters or TGI Fridays and think that their American-Dude-Bar-Kitch vibe is just a bit too tame.

This is a serviceable restaurant.  If you find yourself in Vegas, on this particular part of the strip, and cannot possibly manage to walk another 500 feet to some place (any place) better, then I guess you could do worse.

The fries we had as an appetizer were good.  Our party ordered both the Vegas Fries and the Truffle Fries.  Because, Vegas.  And french fries.

When the waiter recommended the ribs, I thought, sure.  Hell yeah.  If there's one thing this Food Network Frosted-Tip Chef in Chief knows how to put on a menu, it's probably ribs.

Oh god.  Oh god no.  No no no no no.  

Three of us ordered the ribs.  So dry.  So overcooked and burnt, they were nearly inedible.  The responsible waiter even seemed to understand that the ribs were a huge mistake, and came back to check on us mere minutes after delivering them.  He didn't ask if everything was good.  He didn't ask if there was anything else we needed.  He straight-up asked, ""are you sure you want to eat those ribs?""  No, thank you, kind sir.  We did not.

He took them all back, and we went with different variations of the burger.  The burger was fine.   It was cooked to our preferred temperatures.  Nothing special, especially compared to many options you may find within a Vegas block of this place.

That waiter, along with the good fries and decent burger, saved this review from being one star.  But really, ask yourself, if there are other options available, why are you going here?",FP_15PcBXVamc8OV54XXsQ,1,1,2,bzw8o0Qv_c-_bhugOthCRA

When I arrived, there was people piling up in the waiting area... the hostess asked if I want to sit at the bar with no waiting... so I did.

The bartender was quick, attentive, knowledgeable about the food and very kind.

My appetizer came out quickly (fondue) and OH MY GOSH!!!! It was amazing in flavor and plentiful... I shared some with my fellow bar patrons because they wanted to know how it was....

Amidst all the loud restaurant noise and TV screens, the bartender checked back frequently and always with a smile.

Then the main course: the big dipper...
Now this one is a bit difficult for me...
It was big! It had a pile of meat ( but the meat was under seasoned) with cheese and onions...
The hoagie was cut disproportionately so it was hard to grab the sandwich and actually dip in the au jus (also bland)... the horseradish cream was a nice intended touch... but it was At best 5% horseradish and the rest was cream. If you're going to dilute it that much and serve on side of a bland sandwich...then call it cream with horseradish...

* Mac N Cheese Burger - bacon, mac n cheese served on a brioche bun -- DELICIOUS!
* Mexican Churros - fried churros with two dips : spicy chocolate & dulce de leche (my fave of the two!)

When we got seated we were lucky enough to score table outside. Could hear the band from the local music. It was nice. Ordered some wings barbecue I think. Also ordered the American ribs.
Food arrived in a timely manner. Also ordered sodas. When the food arrives, it looked amazing. You could smell the barbecue sauce and it was played it properly.
Portions were ample and we devoured almost all of it. Besides for the ribs or mac & cheese. Good. Smaller size for a side dish, but still good. The chicken wings came with an array of vegetables to dip into the blue cheese dressing. Wings had a slight Tingley and spicy flavor, but not overpowering. Ribs had a very tangy barbecue sauce that was on the sweeter side. Nice buck on the ribs, but I did notice that they had it removed the membrane before cooking. I know that's a personal choice for chefs. So I thought it was fine.

server was very sweet and helpful. Great demeanor and seemed like she was a pro at what she did.

Downsides? We were not offered anything to clean up our hands at the end of dinner. We had finger food. It would've been a nice touch. Other comment? Four dollars per soft drink. Free refills, but still? Expensive I think. Even for Vegas. 
Also didn't like the uniforms that the servers were. They had a country vibe, which doesn't go with the restaurant. Boyfriend suggested using dickies work shirts and dickeys pants for men and dickies work shirt and denim skirts for the girls. I think that would look much better.

1656751,2017-11-27,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I swear, it was like foreshadowing when I walked up to the front and there was no wait to be seated.  The restaurant was very empty.  This should've been my cue to step back out of the restaurant and eat elsewhere, but I really wanted to give Guy Fieri's restaurant in Vegas a chance.  I was asked if I wanted to be seated at the bar or a table.  I decided on the bar since I didn't want to take up a whole table when I was eating alone.    

The girl behind the bar was knowledgeable when it came to what the cooks were capable of doing and what dishes did and did not contain gluten.  At first, I wanted to try The Original Ringer Burger and substitute the bun with gluten free buns for an extra cost.  However, I was told that Guy's signature Bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce contained gluten.  She said I could leave the sauce out.  I said that I really wanted to try Fieri's food and that taking out the BBQ sauce would alter the burger too much.  I then decided on the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger which looked fairly safe based on the ingredients mentioned in the menu.  This was when I was told by the bartender that the turkey patty is made with breading throughout.  She then recommended the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger which threw me off a little because Mac-N-Cheese is straight up all gluten!  I finally just decided on the Mayor Of Flavortown Burger since that one would be the easiest to alter.

The Mayor Of Flavortown Burger ($20.50) came with USDA choice ground beef patty, seasoned pastrami, Swiss cheese, caraway seed slaw, dill pickles, sliced tomatoes, onion straws, Dijon mustard, and the bun which I substituted with gluten free buns.  All of the burgers come with quad fries.  

Just an FYI for the gluten sensitive folks out there, this joint does offer gluten free buns, but there is a very high chance of cross contamination in the kitchen since the fryer is used for both gluten and gluten-free foods.  The staff is very open and honest about this.

Ok, back to the food.  When the food came out, the burger was humongous and looked just like something that Guy Fieri would eat that would induce a myocardial infarction.  The burger screamed Guy Fieri and it looked pretty good actually presentation wise.  The main problem was when I bit into it and the burger had no flavor and was super dry!  What the hell?!?  I was shocked especially since the burger was greasy.  I figured it was at least somewhat moist on the inside.  Nope!  The burger in general was nothing special either.  It was very disappointing since I was super hungry.  The fries tasted like your everyday fries, nothing special.

Guy Fieri seriously needs to continue doing what he does best and that is eating other people's food.  He needs to stay out of the kitchen as a chef because his food sucks!

I only gave two stars just because the bartender was somewhat knowledgeable about gluten free options at the restaurant, and she provided average customer service.  Other than that, the food is way overpriced for being not good and you have way better food options out on the strip!  Don't be dumb like me and spend $30 (fees for alteration + tip) on a shitty Burger.  In-N-Out is way better and cheaper.",2Hs4XM3ENjn5WTNfjM86-A,3,0,2,bElDDMYCLJfdjSIbwLDgIA

After dining with them on the Grand Opening, I wanted to bring my husband to taste the magnificent creations of Guy Fieri.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Awesome.  Within seconds, Nick the Sheriff, was over to introduce himself.  He was incredible and took great care of us during our dining visit.  Thanks Nick!

We started off with the Rojo Rings to split.   So huge! So tasty! I love the dipping sauce it comes with.  Has a kick to it that compliments the rings.  

We then split the Mac N Cheese Bacon Burger.  Since we told Nick, he had the kitchen already cut it for us.  We also had our own serving of French fries. Nice! I love the blend of every style of fry in one bunch on your plate.  As for the burger? Just as delicious as I remember.  So juicy and full of flavor.  I was glad we split it because I couldn't have finished it myself.  

It is a great bar and grill that's full of life in a great location in the strip.  Don't forget to bring your Total Rewards card for the $1 discount on each menu item.  Your stomach will thank you for eating here!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,13,8,4,Qk7Dw3DnqjyKJu7p6NHgtA

GET THIS: 
Triple T Fries are delish, but don't eat the ""creamy white truffle dip""- no flavor, seems to be sour cream. Oh, and they're $14, so consider yourself warned.
The hefeweizen beer featured on the current menu is also damn delicious. Too bad it took 20 minutes and half of our meal to get to us.

DON'T GET: 
MORGAN'S GREEK SALAD is plated poorly and difficult to cut up and eat the full romaine leaves. Only one piece of feta in the entire dish, fell off the plate due to the plating issue and was unable to eat it. The dressing was citrusy and not at all appealing. Only Greek components of this salad were the feta I couldn't eat and a handful of olives. There was no hummus in this dish as listed on menu, and the croutons were soggy.
The MAYOR OF FLAVORTOWN is a dry burger with pastrami of questionable quality. Somehow it looked like brisket with a dark color and odd taste. The Dijon mustard was also flavorless. Served with crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that looked and tasted like they were from the grocery store bulk bag. Did not finish.

MAYBE TAKE A GAMBLE:
DOUBLE BARREL BBQ WINGS are cut lollipop style, which was visually pleasing and easier for my bf's dad to consume, and Guy's signature bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was neither bold nor flavorful, making it even more palatable for a guy who hates spice but couldn't find anything else on the menu he wanted to take a gamble on. Good dish for the person who ordered it, but not something I can recommend.

Service was also awful. As mentioned above, we waited 20 minutes for our beers. That is simply unacceptable. We also ordered a margarita that tasted like lemonade and did not seem to have any liquor in it- sent it back. Should have sent everything back, but at 1AM our options were limited, I didn't want to make a scene in front of my potential future in-laws, and quite frankly, we never saw our server.

Receipt came in an iPhone holder, with the device, to complete a dining experience survey about our visit. I would have loved to. But the iPhone was out of battery and shut off. Seriously?!

I am so embarrassed to have suggested this place and will not be recommending it.  Spending $100 to like an order of fries is ridiculous.

What a disappointment. $18 for a burger. Thank goodness my husband and I shared. The burger was really sad. Super thin and no flavor or taste very dry, like someone smashed the meat. We asked for medium and it came out well done. It is literally 1/4 inch thick. I can have 5 In and Out burgers for this price, 1.5 Unami burgers, 3 Shake Shack burgers and been much more satisfied. Ok everything is very overpriced and just blah. We got the man n cheese burger- bread was not worth it to me so I removed half a bun, why waste my carbs? Mac and cheese and bacon gave it any flavor that it did have, but the ""burger patty"" itself was awful. 

So the two stars goes for these reasons-

8 small wings for $16. The wings were good. They were small though. $16? 

Triple t fries- Perfect fries, I only wish Bachi or Unami had good fries like this. $14 for fries? 

A friendly nice waitress that told me not to get the ribs because they are inconsistent. Thanks so much for the honesty so I don't waste $33. She did recommend the burger though. Eeek.

One we got to our table of four we immediately noticed only 2 sets of dining utensils. Okay fine, the waitress will come back and give us more later. FAIL. 

We asked for water with lemon. The waitress came out with 4 dirty ass glasses and the water tastes like chlorine. Then she forgot our lemons. She looked so irritated when we kindly asked her for lemons which she grabbed from the bar and put out in a glass cup. They were soggy as if cut from days before. 

I ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger. It was delicious. But still no knife, fork or napkin. I had to get up and grab my own napkin. I caught the waitress eyes and she just ignored me. So when she finally came back, I asked her for two more damn sets of utensils. Pathetic.

I had fries with my burger which were nice as they were different varieties e.g skinny fries, crinkle cut fries etc.  

I like the decor and atmosphere here, we were seated outside which was great for a warm Vegas evening.

My negatives however, firstly there were a tonne of people waiting to be seated despite the fact there were lots of empty tables.  The music was horrendously loud to the point where my husband and I couldn't hear ourselves to have a conversation....what is it with this as it seems to be a common thing here in Vegas?  

The biggest negative for me was the stupid wooden tray/plate that the food was served on.  I think that anything wooden in the kitchen can be quite unhygienic (we've all heard of  chopping boards harbouring bacteria) but they also line the wooden plate with paper which eventually softens from the juice in the meat and I ended up with several mouthfuls of goopy paper where is had stuck to my food, not a pleasant sensation for me nor for anyone noticing me digging it out of my mouth!!!!

My problem with this restaurant was the service. It was slower than I've ever had, well ever. We asked for waters which didn't arrive until after our appetizer was half eaten (about 30 minutes from when we sat down) and we wanted to order alcoholic beverages but we barely saw our server after we ordered our appetizer and meals.

1738796,2016-07-13,3,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Guy Fieri's was on my list for Vegas, but we didn't intend to come here. Fact was, this place was open during brunch time and didn't have an hour+ wait. And I also saw a platter of food go by and decided that we weren't going to wait a minute longer to dive right into that. So we came here. 

So if you've ever seen Guy Fieri's shows, you'll associate the guy with indulgence: hearty portions, rich sauces, thick cuts of meat, deep fried goodness, etc. That is what I was expecting to eat when I came here. The menu is great at selling itself; everything sounds amazing. But the food was hit or miss.

Trash Can Brisket Nachos: these looked sad to me. These were not Guy Fieri's nachos. He would not eat these. He would tell them to put some toppings on there. The meat was strategically placed in one area and then nothing. Nacho cheese sauce was on five tortilla chips. Pico de gallo was just cut tomatoes, no onions, cilantro, or chilies. BBQ sauce was okay. $19 for something that was small compared to everything else I saw in the restaurant. Hard pass.

I got the Double-Barrel BBQ wings because I was trying to resist having yet another burger after having a crap burger the night before and looking forward to a dinner at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR later that evening. I done did wrong. I do appreciate that my wings were actually all drumettes, but this was a small portion. The sauce was good, but it wasn't lick-your-fingers good. The dipping sauce ran out super fast; this should definitely come with a larger serving of ranch. The presentation was awfully cute, but way too neat and pretty for what I expected. I wanted a platter of wings slathered in sauce that would leave my face, hands, and potentially shirt stained. Good, but not great. B rating. 

Motley Que Sandwich. I was looking at this fucker for ages before deciding to be a schmuck and get the BBQ wings, and boy did I regret it when this beast landed in front of my friend. THIS SANDWICH IS WHAT GUY FIERI WOULD BE PROUD OF. What the fuck was I eating? Luckily my friend is a cool dude and let me have multiple bites of his sandwich. Incredible. Fuck the rest, get this. Also, MIXED FRIES. I love surprise curly fries! YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT, TOO. 

Cheesecake Challenge: yes, my friend got cheesecake for brunch. The pictures make it seem huge, but it's smaller in person. Actual cheesecake part was very good, but I've definitely had better. The crust was stale. The chips were stale. The pretzels were stale. Major MEH moment. My friend was super disappointed with his choice, but at least he can say that he tried it. Between you and me, the Smores Monte Cristo looked AMAAAAZING, but nobody wanted to listen to me. Tsk tsk. 

Service was a little sluggish, but overall decent. I got refills once and we got our bill after flagging our man down. He offered to split the check for us, which was awesome. But that's pretty much that.

I guess it really depends on whether or not you luck out with A) little to no wait, B) the right server, and C) the right food choice here. I could see myself having an awesome time here if only we had chosen better options. I'm looking at you, Motley Que!",n4usc2DF4pd9fdi2wLDloQ,4,4,3,hiVeOoAMmYMf_zcFFSwehA

we had the Dragon Breath chili fries, Mac & Cheese Bacon burger, Motley Que pork sandwich and the Smore monte cristo

by far my fav was the Motley Que
perfectly smoked pork, crunchy slaw with a pretzel bun

second is the Mac & Cheese bacon burger... very very yummy - paired with wonderfully seasoned French fries - the mac and cheese was perfect

third would be the Dragons Breath fries - all fresh ingredients with a really good cheese sauce - we weren't able to finish it we were too full - big portion

sadly I wasn't too impressed with the dessert - while It was good it wasn't amazing... it didn't have any graham cracker that I could taste... looked like chocolate and marshmallow in between two slices of  bread then deep fried (kind of oily).  came with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauce

I was pretty impressed given the location and celebrity chef status...anticipated, mediocre and overpriced food.   It ended up a pretty decent value given those specifics.

Ordered the $33 rack of ribs...which was basically 3 half racks (6 meaty, moist bones) plated w yummy moist jalapeno corn cakes and mac n cheese, creamy topped w onion straws.  Shared this w my mom, really whole table ate off it.  You could smell the ribs being slow cooked when you walked in, so if people don't enjoy bbq smell, lol.  Was surprised by the texas decor.

Also ordered the bleu cheese burger, had a lot of creamy bleu cheese, great for me, might be a bit much for others.  

Also ordered the mac n cheese burger...huge and shareable served w seasoned house fries included...rare for a celeb place to have sandwiches include fries.

I will not say sides because there were no sides, which is strange and my one complaint.....the menu was too limited.  I am not a burger person anyway, but 3 burgers and 3 flavors of wings and a few random things thrown on for good measure just doesn't make sense, except that he wants a limited menu to turn over tables quickly without a lot of kitchen prep.  Disappointed that a man whose job it is to find the tastiest menu items in the country has this menu....but the menu itself was well implemented.  We did not get to try any of the wings.  Again, reiterating that everything was flavorful and ""high end"", not a here's a 3 dollar burgar, add my name and pay 16.  

Portions and location made this a pretty good value, so add celeb name and I call it a good value.

Also ordered the smores monte cristo....good, reminded me of a funnel cake w chocolate.  Shared w 5.  Dipping choc was delish.  I would order again.

Already having the munchies, I medicated even more in the car, expecting a wait. I was wrong. Higher than the High Roller itself, I walked in and was greeted by a beautiful hostess. We waited for what seemed like less than a minute, before we were called for our seats. (I like how you could see the open kitchen when you're being seated.) 

The menus were clipped to what seemed like oversized, thick clipboards. The menu  was simple and easily understood with a good amount of items. We started with drinks. ""Lemon drop...Not!"" for her and a Firestone Union Jack IPA for me. I don't usually drink lemon drops (only when I try hers) but I have to say it was the best one I've had so far. We decided on the Drunken Fish Tacos, Triple T Fries, Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps and the Mac + Cheese Bacon Burger. 

The Triple T fries and Drunken Fish tacos were served first. The Triple T fries were amazing! Truffle chunks, truffle infused Gouda and a creamy truffle sauce. Bachi who? They don't skimp here! The Drunken Fish tacos were on another level. They consist of lightly grilled tequila-citrus tilapia, cabbage and avocado. Then topped with radish and pickled ginger for a tasty combination. 

Soon after, the Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps and Mac + Cheese Bacon burger were heading to our table. The Ultimate Asian Chicken wraps are a must try. The Chinese minced chicken was on point. You also get three spring rolls and two Thai style skewers. It's also a good way to be romantic, making your date lettuce wraps. Just make sure your hands are washed! Now onto the burger. The Six Cheese Mac + Cheese Bacon burger was bombdotcom. Hands down one of the best burgers I've had. Mac + Cheese flowing over the thick applewood bacon all between a toasted garlic brioche bun. Accompanied with a  combination of potato wedges, crisscut and regular fries. I was already full from finishing the previous dishes so I only ate half and have to pack the rest. Next time I won't order as much so we could get dessert.

She requested my cell phone number and informed me when a table was ready, I would be receiving a text message from them.  The text finally came and we were seated in a booth.  The drinks here are a bit overpriced, in my opinion (approximately $15-$20).  However, they are delicious.  The drink I had was (I believe) called the ""Guava Java."".  The prices for their food items are decent, especially considering their food portions are Texas-sized, meaning HUGE food portions!

My only issue, tiny tiny issue, was that the '68 cajun sandwich is served on this shallow roll so there is no good way to contain all the smoky meaty goodness inside. You end up eating it pretty much like a sandwich without a top. It was so good though that I really didn't care. Besides, more bread may have just interfered with the flavor and just soaks up the tasty beer anyway. This is a two pint sammich!

They were busy but we sat at bar and the bartender was good at checking in on us without being bothersome.

I suppose it was a busy afternoon.  We were sat, but not greeted for at least 15 minutes.  When we finally were able to order we decided on sharing the Vegas Fries and two Brutha's Badass Caesar Salad to start with. The fries were delicious I loved the buffalo seasoning and blue cheese. Some of the potatoes were over cooked though and we had to pick through a lot of inedible fries. The salads were pretty boring and weren't worth the money spent on them. I don't know what went wrong they just didn't taste good at all. 

My boyfriend had a regular burger which he said he enjoyed and I ordered the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger. It was probably the most delicious turkey burger I've ever eaten.  

I'd probably go back just to get the turkey burger but to be honest going to the strip hotels is not very convenient even as a local, and I probably wouldn't bother making a trip just for a burger.",IkOg7-HKbBb2Sjuh48xzSg,1,0,3,CF_5xDnyfVlYzXSv7kUaSw

The French Toast with candied bacon was one of the best breakfast's I have eaten in a very long time. For my breakfast the following day I changed it up and tried the breakfast burrito, while it was very good it did not compare to the french toast I had a day earlier. The bloody Mary's are great too, perfect blend of sweet and spice, first the sweet hits you and then the spice kicks in. You can get bacon in your Bloody Mary, need I say more? 

For lunch I went with Guy's signature bacon mac-n chees burger, it was amazing. The following day we were craving a mid day snack so we headed back and rather than try one of the other tempting items on the menu I went with old faithful and ordered the burger again.

I will say, our server was awesome. He was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. He repeated our order back to us so we knew that we were getting the correct items.

Truffle fries were great! Honestly thought I haven't had truffle fries I haven't liked. That's about the best part. I order the General wings.

I will admit the wings/salads looked good but I didn't try them.

I got the '86 cajun chicken sandwich based on reviews and the flavor was there, but the portion size was very weak. I had about 5-6 bites with chicken in it. Give it a go if you're not very hungry.

I tried the Mac n Cheese burger and it was very mediocre, like others have mentioned.

The fries are nothing special, just different types.

I don't usually care too much about presentation but it actually bothered me a lot. They give you this sandwich on a little board with absolutely no room. The fries are spilling down the slanted paper holder they're on, so it's almost impossible to not have your food hit the table.

We ordered 2 items from the menu and 2 beers.  I had the summer ale and the hubs had a lager.  She brought the beers out and mistakenly gave me my husband's.  I didn't know and I took a couple of sips before my husband realized it.  We ordered the whiskey spicy wings and the drunkun fish tacos, both were good but the wings were not spicy. The server brought the food out, laid them on the table and disappeared.  It would be nice of her to offer a couple of plates...  we had to ask for it when she reappeared which was a while later. Towards the end of the meal, she did ask us once how the food was but as soon as she asked the question, she looked away to check on the next table, never looking back at us for our response.  Finally what I found to be the most rude is that she never thanked us for coming.  She handed me the bill without saying anything!!!

The mayor of flavorton was a huge, tall burger! The pretzel bun is perfect for juicy thick burgers. The pastrami was a little salty for my taste but I'd still say it was a yummy burger. 

I had the white gummy bear shot. I believe it had peach schnapps and maybe another type of alcohol mixed with it and topped with a raspberry. It was delicious and sweet (but not overly sweet).

FOOD:

The Mayor of Flavortown $19
Seasoned Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, Caraway Seed Slaw, Dill Pickles, Onion Straws, Dijon Mustard on Garlic Buttered Pretzel Bun.

At first, I thought it was only going to be pastrami meat only, but it was actually a burger patty WITH pastrami on top. The burger patty was tender. The pastrami had quality but was a bit dry. Their slaw is not too over powering. The onion straws were crunchy. The bun itself was soft and flavorful. Very meaty burger and was tasty but very heavy. Its that type of food that will put you in a food coma.

Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger $20
Crispy Applewood Bacon, Six-Cheese Mac n' Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickle, Cheese and Donkey Sauce on Garlic Buttered Brioche Bun.

This is their most popular burger. Its your basic burger with a slight twist. The bacon is cooked to perfection. There is a light serving of mac n cheese in between, not smothered. Everything went well together and was good. 

Quad Fries 
Served as a side with each burger. These fries are really unique because it is a pile made of fat crinkle fries, skinny string fries, mini waffle fries, and mini wedge fries. I think that it is a great and creative combination. And yes, they were delicious.

Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries $16
Yes, we had more fries! This was a mountain of waffle fries covered in chili and topped with melted cheddar, pico de gallo, sour cream, and scallions. This was one of the best appetizers ever ! Everything complimented the fries so well. The fries were crispy. And everything else was melting goodness. Try not to eat so much before your actual meal comes out! Its quite a big portion! I would say it is large enough to share between 2-4 people.

The wait was incredibly long. We waited for about 45mins for a table outside. The restaurant itself is what you'd expect for a pub with a bit of a country feel. The staff as friendly, our server was hard to catch due to how busy they are. 

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese burger. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty big. The pork was tender and moist. The sauce was perfect. The mac n cheese burger is their most ordered item on the menu. You can't go wrong ordering this. It's just mouth watering and the meat is juicy with the right seasoning. Both order come with fries. We also ordered the deep fried ice cream which was good if you love ice cream. The dessert is perfect for sharing between 2-4 people.

The deep fried bacon, while it had a good breading, was severely undercooked with the fat no where near being rendered. The eggs had an off-flavor that I couldn't quite put my my finger on.

In retrospect, I should have gone with trusty breakfast items such as pancakes (a couple next to us had some and it looked great... the two gentlemen looked perfectly fine with their meal).

GENERAL'S WINGS -5/5 - Highly recommend!!!! It's delicious!!!! I like the sauce, and having different types of nuts to dip the wings in is a clever idea! It gives that nice crunchiness to it. I'll get this one again if we go back. 

MAC AND CHEESE BURGER -3.75/5 - This was recommended by most Yelpers. It's pretty good, but it's not as spectacular as I thought it would be. I'd rather go to Bachi Burger or Holstein's. Deducted some points for the fries that came with it because they were overcooked, hard and chewy. 

LEMON DROP - 4/5 - It was pretty good. I like that they added sugar on the rim so it balanced the strong acidity of the drink. The alcohol content is pretty strong from a small drink, which was okay with me.

The first time, we sat outside, which was actually pretty nice. It's rather loud, but the people watching is awesome and you can hear / somewhat see the bands playing at Carnival Court. On our second visit, we sat inside at a high top. Avoid this at all costs. The high-tops are way way WAY too close together and super awkward. Our sever even apologized for how awkward it was. 

The ambiance and space are cool. Has a definite Guy feel to it. It reminds me of a nicer and newer Tex Wasabi's (Sonoma Valley location). 

I was super SUPER excited to come here because of one thing: Vegas fries! As you might notice on my profile here on Yelp, Vegas fries would be my last meal. The Vegas fries at Tex Wasabi's are just a total dream. But alas, they are all different here. At Wasabi's, they are thin fries, covered and drenched in hot sauce and Parmesan crumbs. Drenched, but still crispy. Here, they're giant twisty fries. And you get a shot of hot sauce to pour over them. Hint: Right away when you order them, order extra hot sauce and extra blue wasabi sauce. The blue wasabi dipping sauce is insanely delicious. I could eat it by itself with a spoon. Seriously. God bless Guy Fieri for coming up with this. So while the Vegas fries aren't the same, they're still tasty. And the portion is huge. 4 stars.

So on to the wings. Have I mentioned how much I love hot wings? The Fireball whiskey wings have a fantastic flavor and are served with the divine blue wasabi sauce. 4 stars. The Parmaggedon wings are mostly breading and were too dry and overdone. They're served with a marinara dipping sauce which was tasty. 2 stars. The wings themselves are kinda fatty and don't seem like the best quality. If they were better quality, they'd be more stars.

Be wary of the beer flight deal. We were told it was $11. But that's actually $11 per each series of 4 beers. We were quite shocked when we received our bill. But after asking the waitress, she knocked the price back to what we thought it was. The full tasting is 4 series of 4 beers. And if you drink them all, you get a t-shirt. James O. and I were sharing, so our server was really nice and let us each have a t-shirt. Very cool. Fair warning: The beers are mostly IPAs, and you should share as, well, that's a lot of f-ing beer.

The frozen shots sounded intriguing to me, so I ordered the Fireball whiskey one. It was not frozen. It was totally room temp in a cold shot glass. Not at all what I was imagining.

The fried sundae was so fabulous. Huge! Get it! It comes with a ton of toppings and you basically create your own fried ice cream sundae. We had a blast with this. 5 stars.

On both visits, the servers were nice, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive. 

All in all, I'll keep coming back. But I wonder if I can get the Vegas fries Tex Wasabi-style? They are quite better that way.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,4,3,4,DwE43rpUgyMTi4xKxII8cg

1) The food was ok. I will say that the meat portion of the meal was good I ordered the ribs and they were tender and had some flavor, however the mac n cheese that came with the meal was horrible. My son ordered the brisket and also tasted good, but again the side dishes were the problem, his fries were burnt and the Texas Toast was anything but good it was like they stuck 2 pieces of bread in a toaster. I asked for salt and pepper since there was none on the table and I was told by the waiter they do not have salt and pepper on their tables because it would ruin the taste of the food. I think salt and pepper would have made the side dishes a little more tolerable. 
2) The service was horrible. Our waiter would disappear and we sat there with no drinks through half of our meal. We finally received our drinks when we were done with our meal. It took him 25 minutes to bring me my check and another 15 to cash me out. 

Needless to say we left there not satisfied at all. I think for the price I paid for the meal I should be raving about the meal.",zU4_rZlMtIKF5K9sMtCU9w,0,0,2,pxphIz7Eq2YTZ2HaI3S3eg

Excellent. What he's not good at is having his own restaurant(s).

I wanted to add a zero but Yelp doesn't allow it...

My friends and I are from SoCal. Another place filled with great restaurants and busy ones. We were a group of 5 on a Sunday afternoon. So yes it was very busy. We waited 1hr for a table, no problem we understand. 

Finally after being seated outside, we had a server named Nick. White guy with blond hair and glasses. Make sure if you see this server ask to be moved immediately!!! 

We ordered 2 appetizers, which came out way late, but again we understand because it was busy. 

Each of us ordered a sandwich or burger of some kind. Everyone's order, not a single one of us got what we ordered. He then looked at us like we were crazy. Finally another 30+ minutes later we get what we ordered. 

Food was very below average. Meat was dry, over cooked n way TOO SALTY!! This seems like a problem with many reviews leading to their very very poor cooks. 

Time to pay... Of course another problem. I have hundreds of dollars in comps so I handed Nick, my players card to pay and also handed him a credit card in case I didn't have enough to put the balance on the card.

He comes back and says: ""oh the first time I ran ur players card I couldn't get the money so I charged your credit card, n then I figured out how to do it and I charged your players card and voided your credit card"".... REATARD!! Come to find out today, 4 days later, the charge went through on my card!!! Now I have to fight this with my bank.

It was hot as balls outside, but the large outdoor patio had perfect people watching views, equipped with tv's, (showing the Food Network, of course) misters, and fans. The service started out sllooowww. Our server was busy, so we cut her some slack, but after 20 minutes of her not even stopping by our table to say hello, or offer any drinks, we realized that she simply just forgot about us. My friend had to walk up to a random server and ask him to help us. He apologized profusely and told us they were going through a shift change, and although he was on his way out, he took our drink order and introduced us to Amber who would be our new server. Amber was very nice and took care of us for the remainder of our lunch, but I still saw the other chick serving tables, so I wonder what the deal was.

My friend ordered some fruity drink, and also the beer sampler. I ordered a Blue Moon, but was told they were out, so Amber suggested a Lemon Shandy. A short time later, the table next to us receives a pitcher of Blue Moon. WTF! I thought they were out. I didn't say anything because I enjoyed the Lemon Shandy, but it's the principle. The other table came in after us too, so it wasn't like they had just emptied out the keg with their pitcher or anything. Things that make you go hmmm.

Ok so the food which I thought would be amazing, was not even good, and the prices were ridonkulous. I ordered the Ringer Burger, which sounded great, but it was actually very boring. The quad fries that came with the burger were ok, mostly cold though. Dip em' in the house made ranch-that stuff is bomb. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and she seemed to enjoy it.

The nachos were so overrated. This is when the internet hypes things it shouldn't. They didn't have a ton of toppings. The brisket was meh and our jalapeños were rotten. Good thing they were free because $20 for these is a rip off.

I had the cucmelon drink and my husband had the mojito. They were good, better because they were free I wouldn't have paid $15 each for them.

Hubby got the mac and cheese burger. It had no flavor and the meat was like burned. It was just a big pile of calories. The fries I think were supposed to be a mix of different types, but to me just seemed like the bottom of the fry basket. I really like fries and these I hand a small handful and passed on. 

Our original waitress finally showed up like 20/25 mins in and made up a lie about something having happened that she was attending to. We realized she was the waitress at the table next to us and had walked by us at least 3 times bringing the guy next to is multiple drinks. It was clear she just didn't know we were her table so she ignored so, so just say that you don't have to lie to our faces.

I would have been level 10 mad if we had paid the true value of approx $80/90 for this meal. I was still annoyed at the $25 for my husbands burger meal. Seriously get a burger at in n out instead and get happy hour nachos from yard house. Both significantly better and cheaper.

The presentation of the food is amazing, and the setting is kind of fun. But, I didn't think the food was anything to write home about. While creative, it's not much different in flavor than what I can get or make at home.

Put our name in and they said they would find us. After quite awhile, no one came out. We went back in and they said we were next and to wait next to the podium. Then they didn't call us so we went up to them 20 min later and they said ""oh"" you are next. 

We sat down and waited. It took 20 min for our server to come over. It didn't look as he was terribly busy as he had quite a few tables around him. We were sat on the patio. Although it was cold out, they have heaters outside which was nice but they sat us at the one that was off or broke. Needless to say, it was cold. 

On food, we ordered Chili, turkey burger and a a suggested sandwich (I can't recall the name but Monte something). I ordered a salad to start. He asked if i wanted it first and i said yes. About 20-30 min later my salad came out and 1 min later the food came out. The food took forever. The food runner was good and very professional when it came out, however it took forever and no apologies. The sever came back about 20 min later. My Monte sandwich (on a pretzel bun with some chunks of pork and cheese and slaw on it) was rock hard and cold on the inside. The fries were cold as well. We was starving and tried to eat it but only ate half and it was very poor all around. My wife had the turkey and she said it was like sliced deli Turkey and had an odd taste. She was not impressed. My friends chili was good with no complaints. The server this time didn't come back this time for 30+ min. We wanted dessert. He ordered it. It took 10 min and it looked as it had canned crushed pineapple on it. It wasn't very appealing and the taste wasn't worth the $15. The total experience, when we sat down, took 2 hours. TWO HOURS in the cold with crappy food. Not typical, I'm sure, but very poor. We travel 300 days a year and this was one of the worst experiences for a reputable place I've been to in a long while.

Me- ""OK but there are numerous empty tables now."" Her - ""Yes sir, we will seat you as soon as possible."" Me- ""May I speak to a manager?"" ""Alex..a customer wishes to speak to a manager.""

First staffing issues happen and lines cannot be avoided in Las Vegas. But the lack of real concern and the condescending tone certainly didn't help to mitigate the disappointment. I was certainly willing to pay $20 for a mac and cheese burger, I'm not going to.wait needlessly to get it.  With a line out the door and empty tables scattered throughout the visible area, seems like a manager on top of his game would staff up!

2138359,2017-02-25,1,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"We walked past the restaurant several times as we traveled up and down the Strip. I scoffed to myself how I wasn't going to waste one of my precious few meals during my trip to one of the greatest food cities in America by walking into the restaurant of a Food Network personality. But then it became Sunday brunchtime, and our group saw the hundreds of people in line at the Bacchanal Cafe, and then we crossed the street and saw the dozens of people waiting to be seated at Hash House a Go Go, and we ran out of ideas. The line at Fieri's was nonexistent, and we were too hungry to try to walk anywhere else, so Fieri's it was.

The restaurant looks like you stepped into Guy Fieri's bleach-blonde head, which is to say that the design aesthetic is very much on point with his brand. We were seated at about 10:45 and were hoping to get brunch, but we were told that the brunch menu ends at 11:00, despite the countless bloody Mary's that passed our table for the duration of our lunch. I prefer more savory foods at the beginning of the day, anyway, so I was fine with it.

For a city as over-the-top as Las Vegas, the aggressive menu fits in very well. It's like a TGI Friday's cranked up to 11; every item has a paragraph description of its ingredients peppered with unnecessary abbreviations (SMC: super-melty cheese) and descriptors (burgers are ""cooked to perfection,"" as opposed to the aspirations of other restaurants to merely cook burgers to mediocrity). Two of us at the table fell for the advertising around the bacon mac and cheese burger, which was voted the best burger in Las Vegas by Seven Magazine, as it states on the menu and the large framed clipping by the hostess stand. Another diner nibbled on the trash can brisket nachos. Why a restaurant would voluntarily associate their food with garbage, I'll never know. Nor why they feel the need to deliver it to the table in a chimney starter. The brisket was hard to find amid all the chips.

Not wanting to kill my appetite for later in the day, I went with the veggie burger, which was a patty comprised of (deep breath) black beans, chickpeas, white beans, black olives, red bell pepper, garlic, artichoke hearts, jalapenos, and oats. It was topped with plenty of Guy's infamous donkey sauce and some fried onion straws. As far as veggie burgers go it was one of the most intricate in terms of ingredient lists that I've ever experienced, and it was, in my limited experience, pretty good.

I'm sure everything on the menu is pretty good; Guy's Kitchen was engineered to be in that category of restaurant that does nothing but hammer your pleasure centers with a coma-inducing amount of salt, sugar, and fat with just a little flair in presentation because it's Vegas and they want you to pay $20 for a burger. Service was a little slow, but only because the server was busting his butt to stay on top of all of the tables he had. Satiated, we paid and left, passing a much lengthier line of people waiting to get into the restaurant for lunch. Our visit to Guy's was forgotten as soon as we left, never to be spoken of again.",rlDDkE6G-nMO-z0hNqekzA,1,0,3,w9FVz4365x9M2QZ6xJkPrg

For brunch, the menu is really small. Be prepared to wait on a Saturday or Sunday since it's a pretty popular location. Their chilaquiles were decent and the steak was tender, but it got soggy pretty fast as expected. The shortbread pancake and ""pot pie"" was interesting. It actually had real pancakes layered with fresh fruit on top of a shortbread crumble on the bottom, served with raspberry sauce on the side. I was disappointed because I thought the shortbread was homemade, but they were just Lorna Doone cookies. 

For dinner, we got the Vegas fries and the beef brisket, which were both ok. We also shared a cocktail in a 52 oz punch bowl, which was pretty fun.  The portions were pretty large, so be prepared for a food coma afterwards.",dY6GK465j-kLlrXalgdsNA,0,1,4,c2RyDYHl_QIEhnPFWlFsGQ

-Do yourself a favor and get the Quad fries. With the seasoning salt and assortment of waffle, shoestring, sweet potato and crinkle cut taters... I couldn't bare to share, but I did because sharing is caring.
-If you don't want to wait for a table, I highly suggest you sit at the bar. The servers are attentive and you get to meet some pretty interesting folks.",ceC9qIoD6MDCmENjN11_mA,3,2,4,LmLk7t2CP83Zf0-wTycpiA

And the mac and cheese just tasted so dry, like the noodles soaked up all the cheese and what you had left over was dry cheese flavored noodles.

But $12 bucks for what looks and tastes like Hormel chili out of the can with grocery store mix cornbread on top?    I thought GF would know real chili does not have beans.  He doesn't.  The cornbread fell apart immedaitely and was placed on top of the chili which prevents the scallions and sour cream that were on top of the cornbread from getting into the chili.  Such a simple dish done so horribly wrong.  Did I mention it was $12?  The sandwiches ($20) I saw served to those seated around me looked like something out of a dive (and not a good one).

The portions are HUGE. Way more than anyone needs to eat. You will be leaving full and happy. The flavors are also spectacular. 

The first morning I got the Bloody Mary. I went ahead and picked my own five garnishes. The mix was so, so good. One of the best I've ever had. You also get to pick how spicy it is. The garnishes range from proteins to veggies, you have lots of choices. For food I got Carne Asada Chilaquiles. I couldn't even begin to tell you what this is except for it was great to look at and even better to taste. I loved it! I could only eat half, though, because it filled me up fast. 

When I went back, I got the Dragon's Breath Chili Cornbread Benedict. This was really good, too. Just a little bit of spice. It was very different. The cornbread was out of this world. Very moist and sweet. I enjoyed it. However, I'd pick the Chilaquiles over the Benedict. 

My cousin got Guy's Big Bite Burrito, both times, and could only eat one half of it each time. This burrito is massive. And it was packed with flavor and goodness. The best part about her meal, though, was the guacamole. I love guac, I make it at home all the time. But when I say it was the best I've ever had? I mean it. The flavors are ridiculously good. You can literally taste each ingredient that's put in it. We both loved it and she doesn't even like guacamole!

I do, however, give this place four instead of five stars because the service wasn't as great as the food was. The first time, our service was dull and a bit slow. Not very friendly. The second time, extremely friendly and personable but our order wasn't put in and we had to wait awhile.

We were seated outside and the waitress who came was horrible. She took forever to bring us our drinks we ordered. When we put in our drink order, we put in an appetizer order as well of Vegas Fries. They literally came 5 minutes before our actual meal came. We waited 40 minutes for those fries, which was the only good thing out of the whole meal. Two of us ordered the bacon Mac and cheese burger and two others ordered the ringer burger. The bacon Mac and cheese had very little cheese and macaroni. I paid $22 for this burger and there was no flavor besides the meat. I could have walked down the Linq Promenade and had Yardhouse for half the price, better food, and great service. The waitress took 15 minutes to refill our drinks and that was after we sat there waiting for her to come back outside for almost 20 minutes. My friend asked for a refill of her beer when our food arrived and she didn't receive it until after we were finished eating. And Rada was rude, never said you're welcome when we said thank you when she finally came to our table and never had a smile on her face.

My sandwich was dry and sadly no flavor whatsoever and my husband's burger patty was burnt.  We also ordered mojitos which were good and fresh.

Service was awesome. Scott was personable and attentive. He touched our table enough times that we felt acknowledged. Alex, the manager came to check on us as well which was nice to know the manager is involved as well in the customer service of the restaurant. 

The food came out fairly quickly. I tried the fireball whisky wings and vegas fries. The fries are definitely different, a good different.  They are twice fried with buffalo sauce so its got a kick. The whisky wings sure give you a jolt of spice. Beware though if you are not a fan of spice. I love it so they were bomb to me!!!

The good:
Attention and service from Christopher was outstanding. Drinks were always filled. Very helpful with the menu. Managers also stopped by frequently to check up on us.

The nachos were the best ever! First, they prepare the dish by spreading out the chips in a single layer and putting all the toppings on every chip before baking. Then they pile the chips onto the serving plate. The effect is that every chip has cheese and toppings on it. No blank chips in the middle and bottom. Plus, tons of flavor on the toppings.

Lettuce wraps were fantastic. Served with chicken cooked two different ways and a flavorful sauce. 

The chili was outstanding. Very mild, but served with Sriracha so that you could add heat to your own taste.

The not-so-good:
Food was slow coming out. Obviously a kitchen issue, because at every round, the waiter came by to apologize and say the food would be out soon.

The hamburger was just OK. My son said he would prefer a Red Robin burger.",nGx5vw1WJ7y_mmwC-0keDw,0,0,4,QmCwu1wSvaYwe1i34otI6Q

I was really disappointed in their alcohol selection. They don't have a big menu for their specialty drinks (I think maybe less than 10 listed), they don't have a blender and they were out of midori. So that was a bummer.

I ordered takeout, which took a long time because I think the bartender forgot to put in my order. You can watch what's going on in the wide open kitchen. Staff was standing around, getting ready for the next rush. No takeout was being packed until I asked a few times where my food was.
I've had the Caesar at Guy's place in Bakersfield, which was much better. This was a bit on the soggy side with too much dressing. Needed some fresh, cracked pepper.
I got the Sammy recommended by the bartender as his fave dish on the menu, the Motley Que. I really liked this pulled pork delight on a pretzel bun with coleslaw. Maybe a teensy sweet/spicy BBQ sauce would amp it up? I pulled the unmelted, greasy cheese off. Yuck. Ooh, not interested! Still, sandwich is really good. The assorted fries were on the hard side, and the seasoning is a little much. It came with a whole dill pickle. Mine seemed to already have a bite out of it. Hmmmm ...?
One last note ... Most of the takeout packaging was nice. I think they buy the cheapest cutlery kit you can buy..... White, medium weight polypropylene. Thin, one ply napkin included. This is about the cheapest you can buy. They spend a lot on the nice bag, a little on the takeout boxes and portion cups, and skimp big time on the cutlery kit.

The atmopshere is pretty cool, the staff was attentive.   I ordered a bloody mary and a few minutes later received the biggest bloody mary I've ever had.  It was really pretty good and had about a pound of vegetables on the rim.  A few people around me asked about it and also ordered one.  I was very (happily) suprised when my bill came to find out it was only $10.   I didn't ask the price when I ordered and when it arrived I was thinking to myself.. I'm in Vegas, this will probably be a $25 drink.  Haha.

For breakfast I ordered the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy.   This is the reason for the two star review.  My meal was gross.  The chicken fried bacon was fried until it was almost black.  It was burnt.  The biscuit was very big and very dense and dry.  The gravy was lukewarm, lumpy, and pasty.  It wasn't very good gravy.  It tasted like flour.  They added way too much flour to the gravy for some reason and when it cooled down it gummed up.  If the star of the dish is biscuit and gravy, the biscuit and gravy better be good, which this was not.   The bacon was a big disappointment.  If you are going to bread and deep fry something like bacon (which I'm sure is actually kind of tough to do) then get it right or don't do it.  I would have been just as happy with regular bacon and good gravy.   

Some of the sandwiches I saw come out to other people looked really good, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.   I'm not local, so it will be a while before I come back to Vegas again, but I probably won't try the food next time.  I would stop in for a bloody mary though and eat somewhere else!",m71OGIvYxUSaEJAy5HhlYg,0,0,2,TLCiwKQY0MaHMVf7eJFAJw

Guy's Executive Chef Tony wrote me to tell me how sorry he was and invited us back in for a round of burgers and drinks.  We decided to give Guy's a 2nd chance and wow-Service was awesome, the Mgr (he was new) offered us fireball cherry shots and they were awesome.

The menu was very small and everything was very pricey for the quality of food they were serving.

My wife ordered the street tacos and for $20 they brought out a few tiny tacos that didn't compare to a local taco shop that would give you 20 of them that were bigger, better, and full of flavor for the same price.

The burger patty was maybe 4oz...where's the beef??...definitely more toppings than burger patty and served with warm not hot trio fries.

In any case, we stuck it out since we really wanted to try out the drinks (which I ended up not getting because they were taking too long so I drank the red bull and vodka my friend brought with her on the walk to and from the TI, her hotel). After ordering drinks, our party waited at least 30 minutes for drinks. This includes non alcoholic drinks. For real?!?  Disappointment after disappointment. Menu was subpar. As my husband states, ""for a guy that travels around the country trying different food, the menu sure lacks variety and creativity.""  Then, the food we ordered took another 45 minutes to arrive. Finally, when asking for water from the same server, 3 times, and not getting it, my friend got up and got it herself. When a waitress came over to the station where the water was held, instead of telling my friend that she would take us water, as she should have done, she directed my friend to the water with ice and told her to go ahead and take it to our table. How unprofessional!!!!  If she saw a colleague of hers wasn't working to her potential when it comes to customer service, she should have done it herself to help the restaurant redeem itself. 

When out friend spoke to the manager, his excuse was that that they were short staffed. Again, a Friday night on the strip, you should have more than enough staff, knowing how busy it can get.

Most of my chips were soggy and some were actually cold like they'd just been defrosted. The fresh slice of avocado was good. We were hoping for a ""oh wow"" moment that didn't happen.

I mean, I have yet to be disappointed by any of the restaurants featured on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives that I've visited.

Well, so much for his namesake restaurant. Prices are in line with similar Vegas restaurants. That said, for the amount of money you're dropping, and the fact that the place carries a food celebrity endorsement, you'd expect a lot better quality food.

Had the bacon mac & cheese burger, and it's a fantastic burger in theory. Execution, however, left a crap-ton to be desired. The burger was dry (not moist & juicy) and clearly flat-top fried and not grilled. Then they serve it to you on this narrow wooden plank, which certainly looked cool. But when it's a big, messy, burger, the serving plate was utterly useless. The fried goodies it came with were also served in an odd manner -- wrapped in wax paper and suspended from an aluminum-wire thing. Super messy -- all form, no function.

Portions were, no surprise, massive. But when you consider the food was mediocre, it was just a plate full of blah. Ignore the Guy Fieri hype. No need to bother with this place.",QBgKo-REQCVZBQXT6of6Wg,8,6,2,PhgPBC-P0OBQba7iAQgmew

The service was O.K. My friends and I was hungry and staying in a nearby hotel.

The food was average. The waiter recommended the ""Vegas Fries."" Our whole table tried a couple of fries each and we did not finish them. They were served cold, and we pretty salty.  We also ordered the BBQ chicken wings. I really enjoyed the chicken wings. The were brined before served and gave it a lot of flavor, and the ranch sauce it was served with was awesome.

We recieved our meals and the runner just dropped them off and ran. We had no silverware, empty drinks the whole meal and had to wait for our server for a good 7 minutes to ask for our ranvh and silverware.

Everything is expensive and Vegasy so you have to rate them based on other Vegasy places.  So I must give Guy Fieri an average rating.  The food was good but not great and if I am paying Vegas prices I want high Vegas quality food.  

The restaurant is pretty small so if you don't have a reservation you will probably have to wait during peak times.  We arrived and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we put our name down and then stacked out a place at the bar and were able to claim bar seating in about 5 minutes.  The service from behind the bar was very good, fast but not bothersome.  The specialty drinks ok but small for the price.  

I had the turkey burger and it was better than most I have had at restaurants but still not as good as the one my husband makes at home.  I did find it funny that they put bacon on a turkey burger but hey that was fine with me.  I liked that the pretzel bun was good and soft like I prefer.

Ok so the food pre meets the expectations of the photos i viewed prior to dining here tonight. The fries were so good that I honestly wasn't as hungry once my burger arrived, but I still cut that sucker in half and did my best to eat every bit. I ordered the mac n cheese burger with a special request of pastrami on it. Figured I switch it up a bit and I was happy to do so. Our server was name Nick and he was FANTASTIC. Superb service for a burger joint. He made our experience that much better due to his patience and willingness to help us find the entrees we were in the mood for and we appreciate that. 

So for recommendations, here our suggestions.

Truffle fries (be carefully as the portion is super large)

Pepperoni sticks (personally liked the dip more than the sticks but the wife liked them)

Chicken wings (good and fancy not mind blowing)

Mac n cheese (overrated in my opinion or more like the outback of steakhouses kind of burger) if you like outback, you'll likely like this burger.",BIRtQp7NloQMdt7fPYYWdA,2,0,4,0yGd4HFNbNykHS4SuUCXig

We order everything at once, get our drinks and appy within a reasonable time.
Things start to take a change from here. Our meal comes while we've barely had a chance to take a couple bites of the appy. After this our server is almost non existent so she couldn't ask us if we wanted more drinks or if our ribs (which were very tough and chewy) were to our liking. 
Whatever right? We finish up and wait for her to come by. And wait. And wait. She walks by quite a few times avoiding my eye contact as best as possible and just walking on by when I fairly loudly say ""hi"" directed right at her.
Giving up I go to the front to ask for the manager. He comes by and I explain the situation. What does he offer?

The first night Christina helped me. She was very friendly and outgoing. If I needed anything she was right there. I ordered the Triple B Burger. It was phenomenal. One of the best burgers I've had. It came with a small sampling of four different fries. The fries weren't bad but nothing to write home about. At the end of my meal I was asked to fill out a short survey which I was sure would be thrown out because I answered so positively about her. The food service was quick and I enjoyed my visit. Enough to come back the very next day even.

Now the next visit I came in around the same time and was again seated at the full service bar. This time however the service was less than par. I sat on my stool for a solid five minutes before being handed a menu. One bartender spent this entire time talking to his friend that were sitting next to me. I knew they were friends because he knew their names and talked about what they posted on Facebook. The bartender that finally helped me though barely looked at me other than to take my menu.

I ordered the Mac n Cheese Bacon Burger which came out fairly quickly. Again the burger was incredible, just as I expected. I have nothing bad to say about the food. However, while eating I finished my drink and despite sitting right at the bar it took nearly ten minutes to be refilled. I finished my meal and had to wait between five and ten minutes before I could ask for the check.

I'm short, my experience was over priced and sub par.

At around 2pm on a Friday, There was quite a wait to sit inside, but immediate seating on the patio. We opted for the latter. The restaurant couldn't control the weather, but some misters out there would be nice.

The waiter took some time to get to us, which was particularly odd since there were only a couple tables seated outside. We ordered water and he had to come by twice to say our drinks were on the way... -_-

We passed on any appetizers as we found that section to be a little lacking. Actually, I expected more from the entire menu.

I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and my fiancé ordered the signature mac and cheese bacon burger. We both finished our waters and didn't have a refill until after our food arrived. 

My Cajun sandwich tasted like the chicken had been pre cooked and then reheated with the vegetables and seasonings separately. The cheese was melted into the roll and then the filling placed on top. When it arrived, the cheese had hardened again-as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp for some time after being cooked. I asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...I finished half my food before it arrived.

The ""signature"" burger wasn't all that much better. First, they need to use a different bun. It fell apart immediately. The burger itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. I think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese was bland. The blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. The bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.

I will say the fries were good. A combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some BBQ cheddar kind of seasoning.

It seemed like everything on the menu was $20. We passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/",W5_OS_FuMRWZ0KobEscPlQ,3,0,1,-jVQvTktgDq4Fs1fwpQP9Q

I went in with high hopes and was wildly disappointed. We started with the vegas fries, this was the best thing we had. The fries- a cross between a curly fry and a thick chip- were very crispy. They were served with a spicy sauce you could drizzle on yourself. I liked the level of heat, but my boyfriend found them too spicy. On the side for dipping was a blue-sabi sauce (blue cheese and wasabi) which was pretty good with spice from the wasabi and a nice cooling effect from the blue cheese. 

From there it was all down hill. I ordered the Tatted Up Turkey Burger with a side Caesar. First off, the side Caesar had a home made dressing that wasn't nearly reminiscent of the classic. It tasted almost like straight mayo which was not pleasant. 

As for the burger, the patty, though juicy and well cooked, was 2x the size of the bun which made this extremely challenging and messy to eat. The bun-a garlic buttered pretzel bun, sounded good, but it couldn't stand up to all the ingredients in this burger. I also got no garlic butter flavor, if anything the dough itself tasted a little sweet. Inside was poblano peppers and pepper jack cheese which got completely lost, I didn't taste these at all. There was also Gouda cheese, which I could see melted but again it got lost in all the ingredients. The main flavor overpowering everything was the sweet pepper jam. There needed to be a lot less of this to let the other flavors shine. There was however very crisp bacon on this which was it's only redeeming component. 

Overall I was really disappointed in this meal. I do wish in retrospect I had tried the trash can nachos which looked pretty good on someone else's table. But from what I got, I would honestly not go back- sorry Guy, still love you though!",bxm90XH7RT4QhSZeiM1kaw,3,0,2,EIp6GpyrwMGZ6whj8pEtoA

I had the Dragon's Breath Chile Benedict - a generous portion of chili over house made cornbread rounds topped with cheese sauce and poached eggs. The sweet of the cornbread counters and compliments the savory chili, eggs and sauce nicely. As a side note, take your Zantac! My wife had the Carne Chiliquilles very flavorful but had to search for the beef.
  Small ding to the score due tithe lack of beef, and some unhulled  garlic  in the chili.
    Don't get me wrong, Guy has some great flavor profiles in his food much to his credit,

The narrow small entrance creates a  slow flow area as everyone is funneled in and out of this place.  It has the feel of a DDD place and the ambiance is loud.  The menu was surprisingly disappointing.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised since it was really limited to bar food.

The Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger plus waffle fries was ordered. It took about 25 minutes to make, which I guess isn't a terribly long time, but when you're just standing, waiting in the restaurant, it feels like an eternity. 

Finally we got our bag of food and got out of there... When we finally tore open the bag about 10-15 minutes later, a BBQ/SMOKEY AROMA filled the air... And instantly my husband and I recognized the scent but we couldn't put our name on it until I put a fry up to my nose and inhaled deeply. 

BBQ DORITOS.

I hate BBQ DORITOS... And so does my husband.

Uh. Oh. 

So yeah, the fries, not wonderful but good enough to eat (or perhaps we were just hungry enough that we didn't care?). As for the burger... Despite the Mac & Cheese and Bacon, it was bland and dry... it needed salt, thus it was added... And desperately needed ketchup which was later found at the bottom of the bag AFTER the burger was finished. 

As you can see, despite hearing good things about Guy Fieri's Restaurant, it fell short of impressing us... And I later found out my Vegas-Resident friend absolutely hates Guy's restaurant. WHOOPS.

The breakfast burger was so-so. I've had better elsewhere, but its size and presentation made it seem extravagant. I did enjoy the assortment of waffle fries and regular fries that came on the side.

Fieri Family French Toast is a decent breakfast choice here. I felt the bacon didn't work too well with the French toast. Some establishments have excellent bacon and sweet pairings. They would candy the bacon and slice them into smaller bits. Then, the bacon would work harmoniously with other sweets as it introduces a unique subdued flavor. The French Toast here placed regular slices of large savory bacon on my toast and the flavors didn't work so well together. Of course the banana itself worked with the toast.

Guy Fieri is a culinary quack and beneath the permafrost of his bloviating Edibles , you'll find just an opportunist and an ego whose palatable progeny is quite envious of all the other celebrity chefs who've made a name for themselves in Las Vegas.

Yeah, he's compensating for something. Large portions, bland to perfection and super expensive.

 So like if anything is a testament to my claim above, try their 'trash can' nachos. And get this:

Literally, he dresses the dish up to resemble that of a hobos kitchenware because you know nothing screams tasteful eats than to be reminded of all that is discarded on the strip... and we're talking hobo cheese ladies and gentlemen ! Don't worry it's pasteurized !

All of this of course I could have potentially overlooked  if my turkey burger pleased my taste buds.

It didn't. It was a mess. The giant patty itself was drenched in greasy oil and obfuscated any discernible taste. It wasn't advertised as fried, yet whoever crafted this down syndrome sandwich literally nuked it with the whole bottle of cannoli oil.

Fries were leftover waffle fries, shoestring fries, potato wedges and I think I found bits and pieces of what looked like to be onion ring skin. What the hell? Now it may be the chef was trying to let the patrons survey the fries, but it felt like he scraped whatever leftovers and threw them together like in the visual narrative example the chef did in 'the big short' to illustrate toxic collateralized debt obligation sub prime packages.",QTeq4wLhXlN4Dr0obpLnbQ,4,1,1,M8n4OHJx9ILPa2gt3AeLqA

Yelp let us down. Our fist dish, bourbon buffalo wings, had a weird taste to it. The wings were cold when they arrived. I showed my wife the inside of a red pepper half that came as a veggie side with the wings because it looked black. I looked at the other half and it was moldy. My wife showed it to the manager, and he quickly took it away and removed it from the bill. The beef ribs had an equally weird taste and were served just a little warm. They came with little bars of soft flavorless bread. We ordered a burger, and that at least was good. The temperature was appropriate, and the side of fries was fresh from the frier. 

My wife agreed with me. Guy Fieri f-ed up two of our favorite foods: wings and ribs. I would give them one star except for the great service. The manager and the waiter were very attentive.

Which to me seemed lacking in booze. And with my burger the tab was $100. Pretty outrageous.,k249VH-43EzFORjg3rMtuQ,0,0,2,85CXeRky5eTHbmbzv3a2IA

My friend ordered a medium steak, was given well done. I ordered the Turkey Burger and Poke tacos for an appetizer.

I've tried updating the name and it was denied.  So annoying.  I mean there was a Yelp event here.  You would think we could get the name right.  

We stopped in for a late dinner.  After 10 pm they have a limited menu, but are less busy so it's not too bad of a trade off.  There was a short line even though the restaurant inside and out was mostly empty.  Parties of 4 or less wait in line.  5 or more check in with the hostess.  When we got to the front we were asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside or at the bar.  We didn't have a preference until the hostess told it would be 15 min wait for inside/outside or we could sit at the bar right away.  So the bar it was.  Funny though that there was that much of a wait when there were dozen's of empty tables all around.  

We sat at the bar and got a cider and a Guido's Freaky Tiki.  We ordered Fireball Whiskey Wings, Quad Fries and Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger.  OMG all of it was amazing.  So good.  I'll admit I was a little surprised.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  I don't like chicken wings and I loved these.  The burger was excellent.

We got seated and was given a menu. We looked over the menu, but we had a good idea already as to what we wanted to order. So now we're just sitting, waiting, thinking over how are weekend was in Vegas since we were just hours away from going home. Well, that time passed and passed...okay so we're super hungry and we're still waiting for someone to introduce themself to us. My boyfriend had to flag down a server and tell them we we're waiting for service! On top of that, we still waited an extra three mins for someone to come by. When the guy did, he was honestly creepy. Plus he had just visited another table cuz he was carrying trays and menus. He asked us if we wanted anything to drink and then was going to get that, but we kinda were on a time crunch so we told him we were ready to order then too. Our food took awhile, but that was worth the wait.

 I order the Double Barrel BBQ Wings, the BF ordered the Mac Cheese Bacon Burger. My friends ordered the Fireball Whiskey Wings and Sashimi Won-tacos. I loved my wings!!! So much flavor, and it came with some veggies. Plus on top of the wings were onion strings, yum! I had a piece of the burger and it was juicy and oily lol. I loved the fries that came with it. I also had a Fireball Wing. I didn't think it was that spicy, it was good, but spice wise, no. My friends also ordered Triple T Fries later on while we were eating. Those took foreverrrrr to come out!!! They were good though, but man.

The food was AMAZING! The service was TERRIBLE and SLOW! Our server took our checks and it took 12 mins! Why? I saw him making up a drink @ bar for another table of his. Isn't that the bartenders job?? Then he took to them and then did our checks! Like, if you're going to do that stuff @ least do it behind a solid wall, there wasn't even a wall to block him. I could see him!!! 

Like seriously!!! It was like the server worked @ a fancy fancy restaurant where the service and speed was more on the slow side. This wasn't and isn't that kind of place. We got seated @ 12:55pm. I thought we were going to be there for like an hour and 15mins, NO! We were there till 2:36pm! I know this cuz we wanted to leave Vegas by 3pm. And we still had shopping to do.

We went there to cap off our day on the strip and hopefully finish off on a good note. The restaurant sits in a pretty busy corner of the linq so expect constant traffic, noise and the occasional drunk A-hole who passes by your table and belts out some crude remark. The restaurant décor is very cool, we opted to sit outside but after a few minutes we knew we should have enjoyed the interior, especially on a hot day but we thought we should just tough it out after all, it's Vegas! We were initially seated right next to the railing but since it was windy, we asked to be seated further inward which sparked a look from our hostess as if we had killed her kitten. After sitting we waited about 10 minutes before our waiter realized we were sitting there (even though he passed by us several times) he promptly took our drink order and since we had been waiting a while we decided to give him our dinner order as well. The drinks arrived about 10 minutes later, the beer was cold and yummy, if you have multiple people in your party who drink the same thing I recommend the pitcher instead of individual drinks, it might save you a few bucks. about 20 minutes later our food arrived, the presentation was good but the portions were disappointing for the price. Now mind you,  it's Vegas! so be prepared to pay Vegas prices for anything you order especially at a place bearing a food network star's name. The burgers were OK but definitely not worth the hefty $20 price tag, you can find hearty, tasty burgers somewhere else on the strip for a cheaper price. The Greek salad was definitely disappointing, it was four large pieces of romaine lettuce with a small serving of mixed vegetables and some feta cheese in the middle, definitely didn't warrant the $20 price tag either. Then came the wings, you get 8 drumettes for $16, yes, that's $2 a wing drumette but hey, it's Vegas! We had both varieties, the hot wings and BBQ wings, both sauces were tasty but about halfway thru our wings we both got a couple of wings that were raw in the middle, we set those aside and ate the others. When our waiter stopped by again, we told him about it, he said ""I'll tell the manager"" took our plates, and offered to have the kitchen cook us a couple more, we declined, we didn't want to take a chance at this point. We lost sight of our waiter again until he came back and offered dessert, we looked at each other and wondered how his conversation with his manager went. We declined dessert and asked for our check. The check came, of course there was no adjustments for the uncooked wings but we thought the manager would stop in and apologize, of course he never did so we paid our bill and left. Now one thing to understand about my reviews, I don't expect any compensation when an establishment comes up short but I expect them to try, if they try I will give them full credit for it and consider that in my review. It appears Guy Fieri's Vegas restaurant is riding on his reputation, hinging on the possibility his name will excuse any sins his staff and management may commit but there's a long way to go for his name to fix all that. It's disappointing to see Guy Fieri's restaurant is just another pedestrian eatery on the strip that comes up short in all phases of operation, I would rest assured that if Guy was sitting at our table and witnessed our experience, there would be some vacancies at this location. There are hundreds of choices on the strip, make one of those other places your primary choice and avoid Guy Fieri's, your belly and wallet will thank you for it.

2629497,2014-11-18,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I have been looking forward to trying Guys food for a long time and I finally got the chance on my recent Vegas Vacation.  Located at the Linq Hotel and Casino the Restaurant has a pretty hip vibe and some damn fine looking waitresses. The place is pretty tightly crammed together so it if your looking for a romantic dinner go elsewhere, but if you like an exciting place and good people watching then this fits the bill.The food however was hit and miss.  First off was the starter Triple T Fries. These were seriously good, as long as you like all things mushroom. Crispy and thin shoestring fries are topped with Black and White Shaved Truffles, Truffled Gouda Cheese and are served with Truffle Dip. The portion was huge but of course we finished them all.
Next up were the entrees. My Turkey Picnic Sandwich entrée was great, perhaps one of the better sandwiches I have had recently. Thick slices of moist roasted Turkey are topped with cranberry relish, melted Swiss, creamy coleslaw and (here's the kicker)...Crunchy BBQ Chips. Its all served between a sliced pretzel baguette slathered with Guys  signature donkey sauce ( basically fancy thousand Island dressing). That's a lot of stuff stuffed into one sandwich but it all mixed great together and every level of flavor showed up in each bite. Also on the side of the sandwich were a mix of fries that were seasoned with BBQ spices. Not that I needed more fries but these were also excellent so I of course finished them.  As good as my Sandwich was, I was very disappointed by my wife Simones, Smothered Chili Bowl entrée.  A rather large bowl of chili arrived to the table topped with melted cheese, sour cream, scallions and a big hunk of cornbread and it looked impressive. However, once we moved the cornbread the bowl itself was barely half full with the actual chili. Then, after the first bite we both agreed that we have had better chili from the local Wendys. Someone took the wrong turn at Flavortown and ended up at the No Spice Nursing home. This was perhaps one of the blandest bowls of Chili I have had in recent memory. This was a disappointing end to an otherwise great meal. So at least in my experience I would say that depending on what you order you could walk away very happy or very letdown from Guy's. I would return again but stick to the sandwich menu.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,0,0,3,xJ8D52n9W74lqlNJ3Hqb5g

Unfortunately, half of the indoor seating was in direct blinding sunlight. As in you had to wear sunglasses during the dinner to not be blinded. And sadly, many patrons did wear them. Seriously? Not acceptable. Then our waitress (I don't think she ever told us her name, which is lucky for her so I can't call her out) disappeared and barely to our order and had to be asked several times to refill our waters. She never even came back to take our cocktail order after I told her I needed a few extra minutes to order. Oddly, she was extremely attentive to the table next to us. Even then, our glasses sat empty forever. The food was salty, over sized portions and over priced. $19 for a pulled pork sandwich. That's high even by the Strip prices. Did I mention it was SALTY?

The flavors were not on point and didn't scream BIG in-your-face-flavor as he had promised. The flavors were very one noted (simple if you will.) Salt was the most highlighted ingredient last evening. I love Guy and this won't stop me from enjoying his shows, but what the heck? There was no layering of flavor! None.

Can you believe I had a nightmare last night because his food was such a total disappointment? I dreamt that I confronted Guy about how his food was misleading and that the flavors really missed the mark and he just dodged each and every one of my comments. lol! Foreshadowing, it may be? 

I'm not giving them 1 star because our server Brittney was amazing! I wish the same could be said about the food. :x

My boyfriend and I tried ""The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps"" ($13) - The portion on this one was horrendous, tiny bits of food here and there. But I would forgive them, if the food was actually fantastic. I can quickly recommend the Yard House and Cheesecake Factory for having better asian lettuce wraps - They have better portions, tastier meats and extremely complex and flavorful sauces in their versions. The sauces here were very simple - Peanut, sweet and sour, sweet soy. If I could tell each ingredient immediately right off the bat, that makes for an amateur sauce, if you ask me (the sauce queen.) The chicken sate skewers tasted identical to the Thai and Chinese restaurants in the mall's food court that offer you samples on toothpicks. Yeah it's moist, but it also lacks the finesse and flavor that you would come to expect from the Mayor of Flavortown. The Chinese minced chicken was beyond salt bombed. That's all we tasted, salt. It's funny to me that the idea of ""Asian"" inspired is to douse everything with soy sauce. Lol. Hey, there's more to asian flavors than just salty soy sauce. 

We also shared the ""Big Dipper Sandwich"" ($17) - The roast beef was bland, chewy, hard and dry. The fries were dried out and rock hard - they've been sitting on a heating rack, that's for sure. It's upsetting that they couldn't even manage to dish out freshly fried-to-order fries. The bread roll was hard and plain - where's the toasted garlic torpedo roll that was advertised? Definitely didn't taste any garlic. I also didn't taste the creamy horseradish sauce and the au jus?! Ha. Let's just say it tasted like worcestershire sauce and water. I dunked my sandwich and I didn't taste any richness, any soul, any flavor! I see a rosemary garnish but no rosemary flavor? Weird. The lovely (random) ladies next to us from Pennsylvania ordered the same and they were highly disappointed as well. They said it was ""very dry."" 

I'm relieved we didn't order more food because the truth is we didn't want to eat the rest of our food. It was all so upsetting. There is a slight chance we may come back to dabble in his wings and burgers but, man! were we disappointed!

There are so many flavors in this burger from the ancho bacon to the donkey sauce.  The pretzel bun is a nice touch!  Quad fries literally means four different types of french fries all with a savory yet spicy seasoning on top.  Needless to say, I ate most of them PLUS my husband's.  But above all, dessert... not to be missed!!  The four of us split the Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae.  This thing is MASSIVE.  Crunchy, sweet, fruity, salty, everything you could want is there.

Wife had a TWENTY TWO DOLLAR salad that was horrible. The crouton was a one giant piece of cumbersome stale breadcrumb. The additional $7 for chicken was a mistake as it was charred to an almost unendurable state, leaving MAYBE half the two small skewers of chicken edible. The only reason we didn't send it back was because we had to send MY food back.

I ordered the ""famous"" Mac N Cheese burger with no tomato. Guess what? Showed up with tomato. It also showed up with congealed macaroni and cheese as it had been under the heat lamp too long. And I know this happens because when we were waiting for our table I was watching food placed under said lamps in a very open and public kitchen area that sat there for eons.

We had our children with us and guess what? First place we have ever been which did not have a kids menu. That's just par for the course anywhere that is not a high end steak house. 

Our server was a middle aged gentlemen with a pony tail who seemed absolutely disinterested in our interests and experience. He didn't smile, seemed like it was as painful for him to work there as it was for us to eat there.

This place wasn't even busy when we were there, tons of open tables and it was just the absolute worst dining experience we have ever had in Las Vegas.

This place is an utter tourist trap and I fell for it which is sad because I consider myself quite savvy with food and dining. HIGHLY overpriced and MASSIVELY under delivers.

Well Turkey Burger was so good I might venture to say it's better than the Mac and cheese. The meat on both was tender and juicy. The burger ratio to bun was overwhelming larger than the bun..

The cheesecake challenge - well, we did not succeed in finishing the challenge. :( It was essentially half a cheesecake, decorated with potato chips, pretzels, and chocolate sauce.

Every sip was better and better ! So good that I had to have THREE ... I'm making that at home for sure - thanks Guy ! 

Order Tuna Sashimi Tacos and they had fresh Tuna and a mango salsa with creme and a wonton wrapper as the taco shell served with fresh lines and some radish. They were amazing and only 4 very small tacos. Wish you could order that with something else small for lunch cause they were very small - but it was only an appetizer. So after my second drink I ordered the Triple T fries with Truffles, Gouda and a truffle drip, OMG that was the best plate of French  fries that I ever ate (beats EARL'S truffle fries) thin little shoestring fries with truffle oil and very fine shredded Gouda on top with a mayo and truffle oil dip - all was absolutely amazing.

I ate there twice, first dinner, then breakfast the following morning (only because the Hash House a Go Go had a long wait).

For dinner, I had the ""award winning"" bacon mac n cheese burger. It wasn't terrible, but not great either. The mac n cheese part was good, bun was ok, bacon was ok (I know, right...bacon was only ok), but I wasn't given an option on how I'd like my burger cooked. Apparently the only option is slightly burnt. Not as burnt as the fries though. I'm fine with crispy fries, but they passed crispy and kept going. Sadly, they weren't event hot when they got to the table, only crunchy. My dad's brisket was above average. The only complaint about that was the $33 price tag for what you can find in the terminal at DFW airport for twelve bucks. I get it, gotta pay that LV strip overhead. Service was very quick and friendly. The server tried a little too hard to seem ""cool"", he almost was. He used the term ""shit ton"" to describe the amount of fries that came with the meals. It didn't bother me, it happens to be an adjective that I commonly use, but some customers might be offended.

Breakfast was where they really lost me. Chicken fried bacon on sage biscuits with sausage gravy. How could that not be delicious? The gravy, what little of it there was, was good enough, but there's not enough gravy in the dirty south to help choke down those dry ass biscuits. The busser had to refill my water about five times just so I could get through it. Like eating gravy flavored saw dust. I thought someone was gonna have to heimlick me from choking on a bite of a biscuit. The chicken fried bacon...this was my fist time trying it. I can't say it made the bacon any better, though it WAS an improvement from the bacon in my burger. Again, the server was fast and pleasant.

I loved the concept of the fries you get on the side... It's a mix of curly, straight, crinkle, and waffle fries!  And the homemade ranch was perfect.  The two of us also shared the bowl-sized berry mojito and was a great value.  The drink was $38 which seemed high until we were both good and buzzed after only that drink.  The food was a bit overpriced though.  $21 for a burger is probably the most I've ever paid (including at other celebrity chef's restaurants on the strip), but at least the price included the fries.  Overall, it was the 3rd best burger I've had on the LV strip, behind Ramsay Burger and Bobby's Burger Place.
BTW Service was GREAT!!! And the server said that Guy Fieri was a cool guy which is always good to hear about a family-owned place.  I can't remember the server's name but I wish I did because he deserves to be noticed.",2SZbcuHAvZG4QHxiWFJj2A,0,0,4,eS2K3J3evtv4bCFI_tq-pA

Decor is is industrial. Lots of exposed brick or faux brick, metal, floor to ceiling windows. The patio has 6 large televisions. It wasn't that bad being out on. The patio in 104 degree heat, there was a breeze coming from somewhere and the cold beer kept us pretty cool. 

Our server Jonathan was really sweet and very attentive. At first I though oh no he looks mean but that was not the case I think he just has RBF, lol. He recommended Pizza Chronic ale and omg this is the best IPA I've tasted. Normally I don't like IPAs at all but this one was delish. I wish I had ordered that for myself instead of the angry orchard I normally get but I still stole a few sips from my boyfriend. 

We for apps we ordered the chili bowl and fondue dippers. The fondue dippers were good. For an app they were really good. The chili bowl comes with corn bread on top but due to corn allergies we asked for it on the side. The chili was good, very meaty comes with a really hot sauce and sour cream with chives on the side. It was good but nothing special about it. The corn bread was bland. But the chili covered it up. Wish it was gritty like Jiffy brand. I ordered the frozen Fireball that I was told would be kinda slushy. The shot was like a normal chilled shot. That bummed  me out. Don't advertise frozen if it's not. 

I asked how the mayor of flavor town was. Jonathan said its the best burger ever. This was an awesome burger. Cooked perfectly, full of flavor and juices without being pink.  It's a burger on a pretzel bun topped with Swiss cheese, slaw, and lean pastrami. Juices just running onto my hand mmmm.   The fries were a mixture of different fry styles.To me they tasted like Lays BBQ Potato chips. Good portion but still pricey $19. Boyfriend ordered the brisket which was good, full of flavor but not much brisket, it looked sooo big because of the the two giant inch thick Texas toast it sits on. Also served with fries.

For appetizers we got Righteous Rojo Rings and Guy-talian Fondue Dippers, the sauce for the rings was awesome nice and spicy. The dippers were also wicked good, my mom started making them at home, just can't get the dip right! For my meal I got Carne Asada Street Tacos, which were okay. The filling was very good but the thing I did not like was that the tacos seemed to be wrapped with two soft taco shells which were really really really dry. The best part was the dessert, the Triple Doublemint Pie, which was shared amongst all four of us because it was definitely too large for one person.

Our server is what killed this whole experience. I am not sure where she kept on disappearing to but she brought our drinks and then ran off for almost 20min before taking any part of our order. Then after our meal it took awhile before she even asked if we wanted to dessert (which I did, come on it was my birthday!). My mom did ask several times for a glass of water which she never brought over. She was more concerned with other tables around us with whom she could flirt with (apparently my husband and dad are unflirtable?), and we tip well as long as you pay attention and are a good server. 

All in all it was a great place and next time I am back in Vegas I will definitely go back.",yOHyqivvvlsg6rl2TRD-zw,0,0,3,yfOXdBMXjqNyn5dOfQ8vMQ

This restaurant is new to me as I haven't stayed at Harrah's in a couple of years and this is located right outside going into the The Linq Hotel and Casino next door. Every time I walked past the place it was slam full as most restaurants in Vegas are; especially the celebrity chef restaurants. 

I swore I wasn't going to go but on the last day I decided to give it a shot. Place doesn't open until 9 which is fine for Las Vegas but bad for Jeff. Damnit, I was hungry but luckily, the wife keeps mini chocolate bars in her purse for just such occasions when I get hangry and start to hulk out.

9:05 and the three young ladies at the stand still weren't letting us in. Should have took this as a sign but I didn't. Already committed so I stayed the course. Once in and were finally waited on, I went with the simple breakfast platter which included a biscuit (?), eggs, bacon, apple sausage, and roasted potatoes with red peppers and onions. 

The reason for the question mark on the biscuit is cause it didn't look like any biscuit I ever saw but it tasted alright. Downside about it was that it was stone cold. More about that later.
As far as the rest of the meal, eggs are eggs, apple sausage was fantastic, bacon was so-so, and the potatoes were delicious.

Now the wife. She went with the biscuit and gravy. The best part of this meal was the country fried bacon. That's right, country fried BACON. The rest of it: I've had way better biscuits and gravy for a third of the price. Gravy was bland and the biscuit was cold.

We asked our server why our biscuits were cold, figuring it was that way per the chef's (Guy) instructions. He stated that they were supposed to be hot. Also, he told us that they were not prepared fresh every day. After enlightening us to this little tidbit, the manager came out to talk with us. Why, I have no idea. He told us that heat lamp on the food may have not heated the entire meal.

If my meal is being prepared fresh, It shouldn't have that much time to cool out from under a lamp. Well, they offered to reheat it but that's about it. Not much in the way of compensation after paying $17 for biscuits and gravy.

I have to say, the whole meal was a little pricey even by Vegas standards and I don't have a problem paying the high prices if the food is worth it but just wasn't for us. Hopefully it's just a coincidence but I'm afraid I won't be taking another chance next time I'm in town.",t4cRy5hYQKzYVnzbUmC58g,8,1,2,saxfZTmOWF-oqXttkK4jGw

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

First, great location and decor. This is a sports bar with great food. The bar area is the center of attention and a great place to eat. They keep the TVs going and are attentive to the games being played. 

The food was great. Guy always talks about big flavors. You get that here. My chili was walking the line of too spicy, but it didn't cross it. My wife's pulled pork sandwich was a perfect combination of sweet, savory and sour. The desert was decadent. Beers cold. Excellent overall. 

To me the most difficult for most places is great customer service. Not here. The staff #hustles and make it look easy. Want a particular condiment? It is served immediately. You can see inside the kitchen, too. Fast, accurate and clean. No mysteries, and always smiling, even when slammed with an hour of waiting customers.

On a personal note, our bartender (Brittney, an original worker from the opening of the bar) swore she remembered us. We have been there only one other time and it was over a year ago. But she told us where we sat before and what we ordered. Interesting! Could have been a lucky guess, but she was convincing. Also, when I inquired as to certain ingredients in a mixed drink, she not only showed me but poured a small sample. I've been a bartender before and I'm always curious about new concoctions.

My burger was out of this world, mac n cheese, perfectly cooked bacon, lettuce, cheese and a juicy burger.  The burger and all sandwiches are served with a side of assorted fries.

So anyhow, since we came so late. We didn't get a full menu. But who could tell? I guess the only thing why I didn't give them 5 stars.

Our server was nice and quick, he took care of everything we needed when we needed it. 

My boyfriend ordered the amazing Mac-N-Cheese And Bacon Burger. He asked me if he should order it before he did because just like everyone else, he was worried it would be wayyyy too much! I expressed my same concerns but we both decided it needed to be ordered and eaten by us. After all, we were at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen!! It was the best idea we ever agreed on. It was PERFECT! Just the right bite, the Mac n Cheese was not overwhelming, you can still taste everything else the burger is made out of. My boyfriend actually said he would've liked having even more Mac n Cheese on top of it. 

I ordered the Picnic Turkey Sandwich and I was in love at the first bite. The pretzel hoagie was yum, the sauce, turkey, everything was perfect. Especially the kettle BBQ chips!! I ate the whole thing and licked my fingers clean. Mmmm.

We went yesterday and while I do enjoy the atmosphere, that is about it.  The first time we went a few months ago, we thought it was just okay too, but not bad enough to post a review, but also not good enough either.  The items we have tried thus far:
Fireball whiskey wings - not spicy at all, but i did like the lollipop style presentation.
Carne asada tacos - no flavor to the meat at all.  Salsa bland as well.
BBQ burger -  WAY better and much cheaper at Bobby's Burger Palace.
Big Dipper roast beef sandwich - NO FLAVOR AT ALL!  No horseradish taste and the au jus tasted like canned beef broth.  Also, horribly tough meat that tasted faintly like smoke and the bread hardened up immediately as if microwaved.

Both the above had an assortment of different fries tossed together that would have been good had they not tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.

Now mind you, nothing at all between the meats and the fries on both visits tasted like they had been hit with any seasoning at all. I am very surprised at the bland fast food quality for the prices they charge.  Guy always seems to be about flavor and nothing has it!!  I am a local and love his shows, which is why I gave him a second chance to begin with.  The restaurant seems to be about style only, not food and not service.

Tried the beef brisket this time around. The BBQ sauce was a bit overpowering at times but a small swipe to the side with a fork took care of any extra BBQ sauce. The brisket itself was tender with a delicious smoked flavor. I love garlic toast so it was pleasing to have two thick slices under the brisket.

Last was the Dragon breath chili cheese fries I shared amongst friends. I couldn't quite figure out the flavor of Guy's chili in terms of seasoning but it was good stuff. There's nothing better than good chili, which now prompts me to try his chili bowl with sweet corn bread my next go round for lunch or dinner. 

Service was excellent as usual. I still have yet to have bad service and I'm sure it'll stay that way. Another great ending to a Vegas trip at Guy Fieri's.

Alfredo sauce on the cajun chicken alfredo tasted like some kind of horrific canned cheese sauce, I didn't eat much of it or take it with me, also nothing even remotely ""cajun"" about the dish. The chicken chunks were boring, tasteless paper-white pieces of dry meat. The boys got burgers, which neither of them finished and that's really saying something when two grown men with the drunk munchies won't even finish a cheeseburger. Tuna on the won-tacos was extreeeemely fishy and off-putting, likely because it was NOT fresh.

I tasted the burger with the pastrami and the description on the menu was better than the burger!  I had the chili with corn bread... Marie Callender's is better for half the price.

Pepperoni pretzels with sausage dip was good.  Salad served in a prosciutto bowl was decent.  Mac burger was messy and the eaters weren't impressed.

Getting to the restaurant is either a quick trip up Las Vegas Blvd or a confusing labyrinth through the parking and casino at the Linq (I'd advise against parking there unless you're on the far end of the strip)

The menu was fairly simple with a few varieties of wings, burgers and sandwiches. My wife got the Turkey Cranberry sandwich, which was decently adequate. I got The Real Ringer Burger which, while being a good flavor combo, also happened to be incredibly greasy. 

There aren't any restrooms within the restaurant premises, I was pointed out of the restaurant and into the nearby casino.

Overall I would put Guy's a notch or two below the typical tourist traps (hard rock, bubba gump) but worth a visit if you're a big enough fan of his shows.",UwADiWc8Ww63wrmsX5DUvQ,0,1,3,-qYcqNJZk6t9ycnORYLh7A

The portions are also enormous and I normally wouldn't mind but I feel bad for wasting when the food just isn't that great! First off, the atmosphere is really fun and lively and our waiter was friendly. We came as a party of 5 and we had no wait going at 11pm on a Sunday. Our drinks were kept full and our food arrived in a timely manner. 

Fondue dippers $13- pretty good flavor and their cheese sauce had a nice tang to it.

Mac + Cheese Bacon Burger $17- pretty dry and over cooked :( also nothing really popped in flavor, it was kind of under-seasoned. For how tall the whole burger was, the beef was probably only 1/4 an inch thick at most. I picked at the Mac & Cheese and that by itself was pretty bland. One thing I really liked was that your $17 Burger comes with fries, you don't have to order it a la carte like most Burger places on the strip. However, the fries were pretty stale and too crunchy, but wayy too seasoning! Also, the serving board it comes on is ridiculous. It looks really nice but it's way too small, three of us that got burgers asked for extra plates otherwise it would end up on our laps.

Off Da' Hook Burger $16- I didn't try this one but boyfriend basically said the same thing I said about the Mac & Cheese Burger.

Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos $17- I didn't try these as well but my friend said she really liked them even though she took all the toppings off lol.

S'mores Monte Cristo $10- this thing was rock hard!!!! I had to use my burger knife to cut through it and I could barely taste the chocolate and marshmallow :( way overfried. The raspberry dipping sauce it came with was really good so it saved it from being a complete fail. 

Cheesecake Challenge $12- another huge portion of eh. Cheesecake tasted like something I could buy at Smiths or Albertsons. Impressive looking but not impressive in flavor.

Maybe it was an off night of everything being overcooked but overall, another case of where food looks way better than it tastes. $175 worth of mediocre food. The price isn't the issue since the portions are huge and comparable to other burger joints on the strip but the quality of flavor just wasn't there. I still think Gordon Ramsey's BurGR and Holsteins are my favorite. I would even prefer Bachi Burger.  My boyfriend and I didn't care for it, maybe we are spoiled here in Vegas?

I know... you think I'm being a jerk, but if you're selling flavor... people are gonna expect a lot of it! I tend to be mostly unbiased, and after having read the NY Times' review of Guy Fieri's Times Square restaurant, I kept my expectations realistic and thought of it more as FlavorHouse instead of FlavorTown. 

This place is overhyped on the flavor thing... it's comparable to Chili's with food quality that is partially better. 

Atmosphere 5/5- Cute place with a farm-to-table type of look, and the waitresses have great outfits. Hostess stand has massive bottleneck entry. Note: no bathroom inside, but there is just a few steps down around the corner in the Linq.

Service 3.5/5- Nothing memorable, whether good or bad.

Burgers 3/5- Dryyyyyy burgers. But damn! Great buns here. Slightly sweet in flavor. If nothing else, Guy has great buns... Never thought those words would come outta my mouth. Portions are substantial and come with fries. $17-20

Caesar salad 4/5- They hollow out a huge, dry crouton for a massive Caesar salad. The dressing is homemade and tastes nice. If croutons were girls in a Vegas club, they'd be a 23 year old in a black dress limping in heels... in other words, not memorable or particularly sexy. $15 

Brunch here looked appealing and in large portions. I would be hard pressed to come here instead of go to Hash House a Go Go for breakfast/brunch, though.

For strip food pricing, I would say it's good, not great. Typical bar food done decently with a celebrity stamp on it... It's consolidated its punch to a FlavorHouse, not FlavorTown :)",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,16,10,3,LHEmG-VtibE5Sk3zGGQM-Q

The salad was ""whatever"" but the sandwich was tasty. The pork was plentiful and tender with a delicious porky flavor although not at all smokey. Fieri's bourbon-brown sugar BBQ sauce was ""okay"" but much too runny. This is definitely the messiest sandwich on the Strip.

The signature trash can nachos are actually really delicious. The brisket is cooked perfectly and the barbecue sauce mixes wonderfully with the nacho cheese. It really balances a hard night.
The triple t fries, for the truffle, truffle oil, and truffle sauce are also ridiculously tasty. 
The burgers are hand formed and seared beautifully. The portions are massive which more than justify the prices. 
My only real complaint is how heavy and greasy everything is. It fits the spot for your hangover but you suffer a little bit afterwards.

Okay when you order a $20 burger it better be fantastic. Fortunately my wife and me decided to order a burger and split it. I can say this the single worst burger we ever had. A very small plate with dry bread with a burger slapped in it and nothing else. There was another plate with a bit of shredded lettuce a poor excuse for a tomato with a few thinly sliced onions. Under all of that was a, literally cold and soggy, onion ring so wet with grease it could not be eaten.   I had water and my wife had a beer. 

While I like Guy very much I am very disappointed with his quality control, food presentation and the temperature of what is being served. With all due respect Guy, take a few lessons from those restaurants you visit and tape. You say you're going to use some of which you taste...it's time to do that. Given that resource, we thought we were in for a real burger.  

We have visited other restaurants of yours one specifically Tex Wasabi in Sacramento which I see is gone.

Not only was the place good but it was great. They killed it. The bartenders were hilarious and helpful and put up with our sassy friend. We met some other vacationers and it was the perfect launching point for the day.
Most everyone bit on the steak breakfast and it was fun that they served it with a watermelon gazpacho. The gazpacho was so good that my friend turned it into a 55oz mimosa. It was amazing!!!! The bartenders charged our buddy's phone and before giving it back took a bunch of hilarious pictures. 
You should def go here to start your day off because everyone will make you smile and the food is very reasonable and delicious.",fKh192utZyTK4w1VmyAPqA,1,0,5,OqnD6MRvz98Kazmz7lUaYg

We got the trash can nachos as an app- there are many conflicting reviews on here so here's how we rate them: if you love nachos as much as we do it's a must try! There was only two of us and we had leftovers so I feel 3-4 people would be perfect to share! They bring it out in a silver tub looking thing and ""dump/shake"" it out onto a plate for you. Pros: this dumping processes mixes all the ingredients up for you so each bite has a little bit of everything on it! To me was awesome! I hate having to pick at my nachos trying to fill up my chips to get a bit of it all! Also was more of a fried pita for the chip rather than tortilla- we really liked it. Con: with the mixing you get fresh cut tomatoes and sour cream in the mix which honestly cooled down the melted cheese and meat a bit so not super hot but more warm but mixing in the cool ingredients it makes sense that would happen. We definitely recommend the nachos! Fiancé got the infamous bacon and Mac and cheese burger (he's a huge burger guy and loves trying new ones!) I personally thought it sounded like a heart attack and didn't think the Mac and cheese sounded good on a burger- he took one bite and MADE me try a bite (he never shares lol) I admit is was pretty dang delicious and not at all what I expected.

Food: The menu is pretty much your regular burgers, tacos, wings but definitely with a gourmet twist. We went with the Mac and Cheese Bacon Burger. We originally had it cut in half to share, but it was crazy messy. The patty is pretty thin but super wide...way wider than the bun. The burger itself was really tasty, complete with the gooey mac and cheese and crispy bacon. I really liked the fries that was served with the burger. There were different types: curly, ridged, wedges, and I'm sure I found a regular fry in there as well. We also ordered the Triple-T fries which was just as it was described: Truffle+truffle+more truffle! Loved the truffle flavor and the shoestring style fries. We didn't get to really try anything else because we were so full, but I definitely want to try their cocktails and dessert next time.

Ambiance: Alan L. described it perfectly: Ed Hardy-themed. And an extra touch of rocker style. The indoor seating area seemed a little small, but I would recommend sitting outdoors. The outdoor seating area sits right next to the walkway between the Quad and Harrah's. You definitely get a good view of people walking right by. Hopefully they see your meal and suddenly get a craving for some good burgers. 

Service: The staff was fantastic! Our servers were attentive and helpful. We did have to wait for our food but the restaurant was about a week old and they were pretty busy that day. 

Tips: Try out this place if you're wanting an overall good dining experience on the strip. And definitely opt for outdoor seating!",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,4,2,4,uDNbcoawgwLGZ0cDPsTZww

My husband's pulled pork sandwich seemed to have the same aggressive ""seasoning salt"" poured over it, and it was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted.

Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen is what you would expect of the industrial restaurant complex, big flashy theme, oversize portions, and no soul.

I sat at the bar which I will say is the best part of the restaurant. The bartender was friendly and knowledgable and they serve some very cold beers. 

After asking for a recommendation I settled on The General's Wings which is suppose to be Guy's take on General Tso but it was nothing more than a molasses like sweet sauce that had no heat and lacked flavor. It also comes with three dipping sauces that were not sauces at all but more like toppings either way the dish fails in every way.

The bartender, Andrew, worked his ass off that night and still remained very courteous and patient with the customers at the bar -  even though some of them were being difficult.  He also did a great job preparing the drinks. For some reason, they tasted better than Michael's versions.

For the late night snack, we got the Sashimi Won-Ton Tacos. These were delicious and possibly one of the highlights of the menu! The wrappers were in the shape of taco shells and were perfect! Super light and crispy. The filling was ahi tuna with a mango salsa- delicious! We ordered the Fried Ice Cream dessert and I was pretty disappointed with the fried part- it was actually pretty soggy and instead of being crispy- it actually was more chewy- not what I had hoped for. It did come with a considerable amount of sides to top with it to make it your own- but I wouldn't order that one again. 

The second meal we had here I tried the carne asada tacos. You get 4 small tacos to an order, which is a good portion size. They were great and came with two salsa options. There was a good portion of steak in each of the tacos and a yummy cabbage slaw on top.  The Quad hotel gave us a free coupon for Vegas fries- so we tried those too--- think steak type fries meets buffalo wings. The bleu cheese dressing is pretty over whelming- I went for ranch instead. 

Overall, the service is pretty good, the staff is welcoming and generally attentive. You even have the opportunity to do a digital survey (There's an I-touch in the bill folio) at the end of your meal to give feedback.

That is definitely the premise here. The portions and plating are designed to shock and awe. But the food? Well, let's just say I'm afraid to find out what part of the donkey the ""donkey sauce"" on my mac & cheese burger came from. It tasted like raw garlic mixed with mayo. The fries taste like they're seasoned with the same stuff they put on BBQ potato chips. The bartender was cool and took it away when she saw I wasn't overly pleased with my meal. But I couldn't find anything on the menu that really appealed to me to replace it - the entire menu is designed to overwhelm. It seems like the idea is to just pile a whole bunch of things on for the sake of piling them on, taste be damned.

So I switched to dessert. The chocolate mint ice cream pie must come with at least a pint of ice cream, topped with mint Oreos, and drizzled tableside with chocolate. It was tasty but enough to feed a family of 6. They took the burger off of my bill, and two drinks and dessert came to $30.

I'll dispense with gushing over the celebrity chef, but suffice to say, Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar was high on my foodie to-do list. I have found that celebrity chef restaurants often fail to live up the hype of their larger than life owners. Not so here. It definitely delivered on the creativity, flavor and attitude of it's namesake chef.

My wife and I stopped in about 5pm on a Wednesday and was surprised to be seated immediately. As we were leaving, the line was already building, so I think you should generally expect a bit of a wait here. 

Loved the atmosphere. Casual country with attitude. Our waiter made a splash with his enthusiasm right from the start, stating ""I want you to do me a favor. Close your eyes and pick anything on the menu. If you don't like it, I would be happy to eat it."" Now there is an enthusiastic endorsement!

We started with some cocktails -- my wife had a Guido's Freaky Tiki which was a fun twist on her favorite Mai Tai cocktail. Passion fruit purée really made this drink by giving it some interesting texture. I'm a hardcore old fashioned man, so I had to try the ""not so old fashioned"" which featured basil-infused apple syrup. This was one of the best old fashioned cocktails I've ever had. Totally anchored the evening for me. 

On to the food. While our waiter said he would be happy to eat anything we didn't like, the real service would have been to help with our leftovers because the portions are HUGE. My wife had the Motley Que sandwich, which turned out to be amazing. Piles and piles of delicious, sweet barbecue on a big pretzel hoagie bun. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the sauce was crazy good. Being a burger fan, I had to go with the unique and award-winning Bacon Mac-n-Cheese burger. Loved this burger! It was a wonderfully crispy smashed patty stacked with lettuce, tomato, crispy bacon and creamy Mac and cheese. Combined with the regular cheese on the burger, this was ooey gooey deliciousness. It was all captured in a delicious garlic-buttered brioche bun. Absolutely perfect. But you know what stood up these sandwiches? The fries. Each came with a basket of fries -- a fun mix of waffle fries, potato sticks, and crinkles. The seasoning on them was both sweet and savory. Much like Red Robin seasoning, I may have to find this to buy for home. 

Total for cocktails and a couple sandwiches was about $80, which is a little on the pricey side but I found it to be worth it for the fun attitude and unique, delicious food we received along with the great service. Can't wait to return and try other items on Guy's fantastic menu.",xxLv8dvGKwdZVEG_wtr4lA,2,1,5,qTHCCF_pjLgaHJ7whAlgcw

At lunch the place was doing a brisk business. Table wait time was estimated at 20 minutes but was actually 15. Once seated our server Ed welcomed us and immediately took our drink order. Wait time for food was about what you would expect when the kitchen is slammed. 
We ordered the Motley Que pulled pork sandwich and requested the Caesar salad in place of the fries and the Original Burger without the bun. The burger comes with fries. Both lunch items are large size orders that could be shared by two. 
The pulled pork sandwich was pilled high with shredded and chunks of meat. A heaping portion of slaw, bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce on a pretzel bun completed the sandwich. The meat was tender with just right amount of smoke made one tasty sandwich. The whole dill pickle was crisp and tangy, one of the best that I have tasted. I am glad the sandwich was cut in half which made it manageable to hold.
The Original Burger was juicy even though it was cooked as ordered well done. The order of fries were a combination of waffle,shoestring and crinkle cut. The fries were crisp outside soft inside and grease less.
Because there are many more restaurants to experience up and down the strip it will probably be a long time for a return visit.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,3,xTLW82gWBHqV_GgG723ELQ

I'm a local and appreciated it so I'm sure an out of towner would love it. 
We ended up ordering the 52oz hangover fishbowl Bloody Mary (extra spicy) and OH MY GOD, delicious. I ordered the chili bowl and my fiancé ordered the motley que sandwich. For some reason the service was really slow, but at least our server was apologetic about it and brought us out complimentary shots. It was a mix of fireball and angry orchard. Definitely not something I'd order on my own but it was free, so I gladly partook. I wish I remembered our servers name, she was a sweetheart. 
Our food arrived and it was amazing. The chili had a layer of cheese on top to separate the cornbread so it didn't get soggy. I thought that was genius. 
My fiance's sandwich was amazing. The smoked pulled pork was some of the best I've had in this town which I wasn't really expecting. The perfect amount of smokey flavor with moisture in the meat. 
We also got the cheesecake challenge to go since we were stuffed, but I've been snacking on it all night. You wouldn't ever think to put potato chips and pretzels on a cheesecake but now I don't think I can eat it any other way.

Just asking what we wanted and left. We asked about the seasonal shot... apparently they ran out. He didnt reccomend anything in its place. And half way thru our meal we had a different server. Usually they tell us theyre going on break or something but nope. And it was a server who passed us multiple times without saying a word. So yea there wasnt going to be a good tip. Sorry not sorry

Now to the food. Maybe i was buzzed last time and now i wasnt but the nachos were subpar. The cheese tasted like melted kraft singles. We also split a burger i forgot which one tho. It was aight.

The food was mediocre at best.  However, the service here was absolutely crap.

I ordered steak and eggs which they managed to screw up.  VERY RARE steak and egg whites only.  Nope.  These fools gave me a well done steak and scrambled the eggs.  They didn't charge me for only asking for egg whites so it's whatever.  I purposely waited until the check came before I ate my eggs so that in the event they did charge me extra, I can prove they did not give me what I had asked for.  I couldn't ask server Kayla because she disappeared off the face if the earth after she took our orders.

The service was atrocious, at least from our server Kayla.  All she did was take our order.  Someone else brought out the food.  She never came back to ask how everything was.  She never came back to refill anything.    If fact, she didn't do jack sht.  The next time we saw her was when she came back to drop off the check without a peep.  Not even, ""Can I get you anything else?""

She comes back to get the check after I had signed for it and has the audacity to just stand there awkwardly at our table and stare at it... As if she's getting more than what she truly deserves!  Oh wait, she already did!

For a food network star restaurant, food is probably a 2 or 3 (not horrible, but still disappointing) but service from this chick... 0.  She's lucky she got anything out of us.  I should have played the stupid foreign tourist card and left zilch $ for zilch effort.  There's a math wiz.",KDw1B6VZ-c0cSobzgRx06A,4,1,1,04Vb93lx9uH9de0ssIstTQ

When the credit card slip arrived the bartender said ""I'll be right back with a pen."" When I glanced down at the slip it was not for my order, but for the two gentlemen sitting next to me.
She attempted to joke with the other guests and said ""He's trying to pay for your meal.""

She attempted to run my card, but said it didn't go through and that maybe because I was from California and sometimes the banks put holds on the cards. I then asked why my card was approved to pay for the bill for the guys sitting next to me.

If my card wasn't charged, then why did you tell me you'd be back with a pen? If I would have signed that would have been the end of it. It was a very unprofessional and rude experience at the bar.

When we went to order it, our waiter actually talked us into the nachos instead. OMG!! Best nachos we've ever had!! Chips were crispy and freshly made, and the sauce, the sauce was delicious!! 

When it came time to order we were still stuck on those fondue dippers. So, we ended up ordering the Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger with fries and the fondue dippers and shared both. The Mac & Cheese Burger was the best burger I've ever had. So flavorful and juicy!! Fries were seasoned with this yummy BBQ spice (sweet & salty). As for the fondue dippers....our waiter was right. They weren't that great and we had wished we ordered a sandwich instead to share. The dippers were really salty!! Between the pepperoni, the salt on the pretzel rod and the salt from the chorizo meat in the cheese sauce, all you could taste was salt. Not good at all.

It took him awhile to bring our waters and seeing from the next two tables over, it was clear that he wasn't able to handle his section. He messed up on a few peoples orders and judging by the looks on their faces, it made me worry about my order. When I received my burger, it was horrible. Barely any Mac and Cheese (just a few strands of pasta) and he didn't even ask me how I liked my burger. The burger was too well done for my taste and when I asked him about it, he looked at me like ""what did you want me to do with it?"" He apologized and told me he didn't know and forgot to ask me. This place is supposedly known for their burgers, HOW DO YOU NOT ask a customer how they want their burger?! The burger mostly had stringy pickled lettuce or something, it did NOT go good with the burger AT ALL. Oh and did I mention the burger was $20? I didn't even finish it because it was horrible.

My boyfriend also asked for a plate to split the burger with me, as soon as we got the meal and he never even returned with the plate. We asked for the check and we immediately got that instead. Nice to know that we were getting rid of is my guess.

Please don't go here. The service is HORRIBLE as well as the food. The hype is not at all about what it seems. Go spend your money else where on a decent burger that is cheaper and better.",v9-miEVuVWVhJHCSm0F3oA,2,0,1,o47KCYnrewlKczQQUQWDbQ

We'd get called around 25 minutes, but they forgot about the patio request and wanted to seat us inside. We eventually got the patio seating. 
  Once seated, service was on the slow side. We ordered drinks, I got the Sammy Hagar rum drink, which was very good. But our order was not taken until we got our drinks after a long wait.  We ordered hamburgers, I got the Mac and Bacon Burger. I took about 30 mins to come out. The burgers are smash burger style, and unfortunately ours were on the over done side. The burger is described as an award winning burger, but not in this case. The Mac and cheese was stingily applied and could not overcome the dryness of an overdone burger. 

During the whole time there, when visits from the server were few and far between, there were about six people getting a table ready for a group of 15. Must have been a VIP, because it was setup meticulously. I've never seen that much cleaning and rechecking of the setup before. Maybe if they put that much attention to the rest of the customers, it would have been a better experience.

3429990,2018-01-20,5,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"It is said that America is an idea. For this reason, I've long believed that Las Vegas is the quintessentially American city--unmoored from any specific reality, yet a phantasmagoric facsimile of many of them. Las Vegas embodies artifice, but it also suggests something else: that the imagined is more essential than the actual. You don't have to be in New York City in order to ""spend all your money"" or ""eat at Rao's"" within view of the ""New York skyline."" You don't have to be a race car driver to drive a Ferrari around a track at warp speed. You don't have to convince an actual person to be in a relationship with you to... well, you get the picture. 

Guy Fieri, auteur of the Vegas mileu (and creator of Vegas Fries(TM)) knows this instinctually. Little surprise then that the man is well-represented in this town, including by the savagely brilliant Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar.

A waiter rolls up to your table bearing a small trash can of nachos and some spicy margaritas. As you wonder how your grubby little fingers will reach the cheesy, barbecue-blasted goo at the root of this heapin' helpin' o' chips, voila! -- the bottomless can is snatched away, leaving a dare-I-say perfect cylinder of slightly-sweet yet tasty nacho.  

Ever had a burger spackled with SMC (that's ""super melty cheese"" to the uninitiated)? If you've been to Flavortown you have. Is that burger ""the best in Las Vegas"" (as voted by SEVEN magazine, whatever that is)? DNDC (that's ""don't know / don't care): What I do know is that along with SMC, that burger has mac n' cheese, bacon, LTOP (I'm not spelling that out; keep up) and the inimitable Donkey Sauce(TM) all over it, and it goes down just fine before or after a (once again slightly sweet) Fireball Whiskey Wing. Oh, and for real, don't eff with that spicy margarita. 

Chilaquiles? Now? It seems counterintuitive, really, but if you've been up till 8 a.m. blastin' your schnozz with 'caine and/or hip-thrustin' to the block rockin' beats of Tiesto, then 3 p.m. on a Thursday is Vegas Brunch O'Clock, my friend. And these chilaquiles, to be truthful, are the best looking plate I've seen from this joint yet. 

You can dine outdoors at Guy's Vegas Kitchen, and you ought to -- the better to drink in the corporate colossuses stacked around you, punctuating that dry desert air soaked with the smell of money ill spent. Should this plate of nachos cost twenty bucks, a plate of ribs north of thirty? Nah. But by Vegas logic -- nay, by Flavortown logic -- it not only should, but it must. For if there is one idea that (T)rumps all others in America, and in the most American city, it is extraction. Capitalism is both engine of and raison d'etre for American freedom. Vegas takes that capitalism, stuffs it in a fake-bottomed trash can, slathers it with cheese sauce and barbecued meat, and charges you twenty bucks for the privilege of stuffing that bad boy in your mouth. Vegas takes capitalism to Flavortown. 

And as Vegas is to America, so, then, is Flavortown to food. It is a place that connects us without connection, that unites our people behind a vague, occasionally multiethnic, promise of familiar abundance. It is any America: a Texas roadhouse, a Midwestern diner, a BBQ joint, a dive bar. It is, in an often lonely city that is somewhere yet nowhere, a home.",Z3pBGiRZOzxBoUz0Ric18g,2,0,5,yudtPJymu0S1SfE6SxWp6A

3455179,2014-08-23,5,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Some ""Guys"" deserve a second chance. One of the managers contacted me to address concerns that I shared in my previous review, and invited me to return to the restaurant to make up for the negative experience I had.

Before I begin my review, I don't Yelp for free meals. I'm just here to share my experiences, hoping that they can help others. The fact that someone even reached out from the restaurant shows good customer service on their part, and an effort to make improvements.

Appetizer - Sashimi Won Tacos: Finally, I felt like I arrived at ""Flavortown."" Out of everything I tried during my first and second visit, this was the best. Crunchy and tasty and perfect with lime, four of these tacos make for a good appetizer or a light meal.

Entree - Pic-a-Nik Sandwich: I stayed away from the burgers because of my last experience, and instead went for a sandwich. Basically, this is Guy's take on a Bobby sandwich. Average at best. It would've tasted much better if the slices of turkey meat weren't cold. Meh. 

The Big Dipper Sandwich: This was my boyfriend's order. The house-smoked shaved prime-rib has a strong smokiness. I personally didn't like it. 

Dessert - Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae:  It really was a (small) boulder of ice cream that's large enough to be shared. Toppings like a banana with peanut butter, a caramel shooter, chocolate fudge, and strawberries come with this, but I think the fried ice cream was fine by itself.

Service - Better than my last visit. Much more attentive, not sarcastic, but expected.  

Other - The wait is over an hour on the weekends for a table. The line to save your spot in person reaches all the way to the entrance of the restaurant. Did I mention that they also don't take reservations? In our case, we didn't have to wait, but it was sad sight seeing people leave out of frustration or having to wait it out. 

Overall - My opinion still stands that this restaurant is just a glorified Applebee's, where outrageous food is just served for show. Perhaps the ""tamer"" items on the menu are worth trying, but considering the wait time and hit or miss food, I wouldn't take another gamble here.

I ordered an iced tea.   Was a smaller sized glass which was surprising for this place.   It wasn't an issue though as they refilled it frequently.

I also wanted the food to be really good and it was just okay. It was way overpriced we got 4 tiny tiny tacos for $18. It wasn't even worth $10. just a bunch of lettuce cheese and tomatoes stuffed into a taco shell.
nothing special. Also the service was pretty bad, not that they were rude or anything they just neglected us. We had asked for two plates for the tacos and they didn't bring it to us until after we didn't need it because they didn't even check on this until way after food it come out.

Our favorite item was the trash can nachos, actually delivered to your table inside a metal trash can on a plate, fun display :)  They lift the lid to expose all of the layered cheesy, brisket goodness then lift the trash can, allowing the nachos to pour out the bottom onto your plate. Definite must share! There are a lot of nachos in that can!

The Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger by far was an awesome display and not just in looks, but the wonderfully seasoned beef and fries lived up to hype. And if you love mac & cheese, get a side of it to share too (not on the menu). However, I recommend getting the fried onions on the side (think they're out of a can, not fried in-house). A couple crisps are good with a bite but mixing them all in overpowers the mac & cheese yumminess. 

Now for the disappoints. We were really underwhelmed by the Pepperoni Fondue Dippers ... so not hype worthy. The dippers were simply pepperoni flavored chewy breadsticks - NOT wrapped in pepperoni as advertised or in ""some"" Yelp pics. Booooooooo for not telling fans when ordering that they're getting end of night leftovers. And the drinks were meh.. a few can be seen in pics, served in water glass without any real presentation or umph. Plus no copper tins for the mules which was a bit of a bummer.

I blame the Bloody Mary mostly. It was so beautiful and full of garnishes that I immediately had to have one...even though we had eaten shortly before. There was sausage, bacon, a French fry, a full harvest of pickled vegetables, and some lettuce to fluff it all up. The actual Bloody wasn't as good as Hash House, spicy and peppery but runnier and less tomato flavor than I  preferred. Of course, I still happily drank it as I dipped my garnishes in the deep red liquid. 

The REAL star of our drinks and apps visit was the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. I know. The name alone is cringe worthy, but these damn dippers were like a pizza crust pretzel love child who was then swaddled in pepperoni. Briefly crispy then satisfyingly doughy. They were served with this Sausage CRACK dip and cheese dip and I literally could not get enough.

You're going to be paying Vegas Strip prices here but it's beyond worth it. We ordered the trash can nahos which was $20 but a TON of food! Honestly, they were the best nachos I've ever had. The BBQ sauce that is on the brisket has a great sweet flavor which goes perfectly with the heat of the pepers. 

The flavortown burger that I got had a ton of delicious pastronami on it and the size of the burger itself was far more than I could eat in one sitting (after I shoved my face with nachos.)

Our first experience with Guy Fieri and his delectable burgers was on a recent Carnival Cruise where Carnival introduced  ""Guy's Burger Joint"" on some of their cruise ships.  No joke...the burgers were so delicious and bursting with flavor that we ate there 6 out of 7 days on the cruise...sometimes twice, most times even avoiding the gourmet meals provided by the cruise.  And we were not alone. So after a late night show in Vegas we discovered Guy had a restaurant in the ""Quad"" and had to try it out. The restaurant offers ample outdoor seating for great late night people watching on the strip.

As for the menu:   My wife and I split the ""Original Smash Burger"" and an order of ""Vegas Fries"".  The smash burger just melts in your mouth with bursting flavor...it is like an unbelievable taste beyond anything you have ever  experienced.  The burger comes with its own set of ""fries""...a collection of different types of fries along with blue cheese and buffalo sauce for dipping.  The Vegas fries are also a taste sensation and ""rolled"" in buffalo sauce and again bursting with flavor.  Hint: next time, my wife and I agreed...no splitting of the burger (cause you just can't get enough)...and the burger comes with fries as well.  (Who Knew).  There are tons of other choices but why venture beyond the burger.

An embargo should be placed on Flavortown for their over the top ridiculousness of the bold flavors, crazy dia de los muertos meets affliction decor, and outlandish copywriting. The restaurant comes across as a parody straight out of SNL, but it's real. 

The parmageddon wings suffered from breading that was too thick and an overpowering parmesan flavor. The mac n cheese burger had so many flavors and ingredients that the beef patty was lost. And, by lost I mean the flavor. The patty itself was a mess -- weirdly shaped and thin as if a child assembled it then someone ran it over. No wonder they call it a meat blanket. The bun was great, but the rest of the burger was just an odd tasting mess. The order came with a mix of skinny, handcut, and waffle fries, all of which were pretty good.

Expect long waits because of Guy's popularity. It's Applebee's on steroids.

I got the turkey sandwich with thick sliced turkey, bbq potato chips, slaw and cranberry sauce on a pretzel hoagie. It was fantastic! The potato chips gave a great crunch and added a smoky flavor to the hearty savory flavor of the turkey and slaw combo.

They're tourist traps designed to give the impression that you are getting the experience of the chef's vision.  After looking at the menu, I think it was derived more from Fieri's agent than the from him.  Here's how the convo probably went when they were conceiving the restaurant idea:

Restaurant Owner - I watch the show all the time....so I guess it'll  be a menu of some burgers , meatloaf, and pulled pork.

Agent -  Yeah.  Sure.

Restaurant Owner - Ummm....did he tell you what he though should be on the menu?

Agent - Naw.  Not really.

Restaurant Owner - Okkkkk.......

**awkward silence**

Agent - I dunno.  Take something from Appleby's, Cici's, and Red Robin and that should be the menu.  I don't have time to look through all of the shows to break that down.  I got 18 holes in about 45 minutes.

Restaurant Owner -  Ok, but what about drinks?  Hello?  Hello?


The menu was unimaginative to me.  I took me a long time to decide because I wanted some greens or some sort and the nothing on the menu stood out.  I only tasted a few dishes; the Montgomery salad, the some-fancy-named nachos, and the firewall wings.  The salad was good; very good in fact.  The nachos were over the top to a fault. Any type of loaded nachos should be a medley not cutesy.  Regular tortilla chips, chili. onions, jalepenos, beef.  Done.  Their nachos were supposed to have simmered beef.  That night, they were out, but offered chili as a replacement.  Bad choice.  The chili was no where near the quality it was supposed to be for that price as a replacement for the beef.  The chips were too fancy for dish as well.  Remember what I wrote about a medley?  Yeah, there wasn't one.  My wings were tasty sauce-wise, but it was hard to really enjoy it as I was worried after each bite since each wing had a touch of pink on the inside.  The only reason I didn't send them back was because typically when a cook doesn't cook chicken enough, he/she only knows how to under-cook it or burn it.  I kissed it to God and kept it moving.

I ordered a pitcher of blackberry sangria.  $45 whole American dollars.  Was it good? Yes.  Was it $45 good, not even close.

Personally, I don't thing there are any restaurants on the strip or in the casinos that are worth the money.  Guy Fieri's is just one of them.",BL1F9pN-kthJUi74Z9debA,3,2,2,qvb6hYzxVIqLAr1KX9cfMw

It's big and overflowing with garnishes. 
Runs $15 but it ain't lacking in booze or flavor. 
Not to mention they bring you out a small plate because you're basically getting a personal appetizer as well, what with all those garnishes. 
Can't speak to the trash can nachos (although they looked interesting) but if you're in the mood for some breakfast booze, this place is as good as any.",8tA-qnRM1Eu012svxTe6ww,2,2,4,fy18mkEHo8AaUEEsd4jEkg

I glanced at the menu and saw that they had something for everybody in my group, so I picked that for our lunch destination. I'm vegan, so I was delighted to see that they had a veggie burger. I avidly LOVE Guy and was so excited to taste his food. The atmosphere was charming, and the waitresses were adorable. We were promptly seated and the service was quick. 

I ordered the veggie burger, with no cheese, mayo, etc. so, the waitress caught on to the fact that I don't eat animal products. She then told me that the veggie patty has egg and cheese in it!:( she felt really bad, but I assured her that it wasn't her fault. So there I was, the person who chose the restaurant, eating a small side salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing. So sad. The rest of my party totally enjoyed their food, but I was so bummed that there weren't any vegan options! I would LOVE to see a vegan burger here in the future, especially during the year 2016 where people are beginning to wake up to the truth about animal agriculture.

3552086,2016-03-22,2,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I know that Guy Fieri is the biggest joke in the culinary world. And why wouldn't he be? He's known for a reality TV show, his food is glorified junk food and he's got a super-outgoing personality that is easy to make fun of. That being said, who doesn't love watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives? And who doesn't love yummy junk food? That's why I love eating at Guy Fieri establishments and I ask you not to judge me until you try it for yourself! 

My first Guy Fieri experience was in Las Vegas at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar, located in the LINQ Hotel Carnival Food Court. When you are hungover, nothing sounds as good as a (veggie) burger and fries dripping with grease and cheese. No one in my group had ever eaten Guy Fieri food so we stopped by. My friend Cindy asked, ""What is Guy Fieri's food like?"" Pointing to the menu and reading off the first thing I saw, which was a marble cheesecake topped with potato chips, pretzels and melted fudge, was the best way to describe what she was getting herself into. 

When I saw the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger, I just had to have it in and around my mouth. Unfortunately, for some reason Guy Fieri does not offer a veggie burger???!!! So I ordered this burger without the burger...and without the bacon. Still, I got a huge pile of six-cheese macaroni and cheese in between a garlic buttered brioche bun, topped with super-melty cheese, donkey sauce, lettuce, tomato onion and pickle.

We ordered a little bit of everything, including the fireball wings, pepperoni fondue dippers, the turkey burger, fried ice cream and churros. 

The wings were good, sweet and spicy and all drums so we liked that. 

The fondue dippers...I wanted real warm soft pretzels with cheese sauce so bad. These pretzel rods were the hard crunchy ones you can buy in the store so they weren't my favorite and at $12! Yikes! The fondue was delicious though, a good portion and we used it for our fries.

The tatted-up turkey burger I had was full of flavor, it's smashed so not your typical juicy burger but had plenty of sauce and toppings to make up for that. Layered with bacon, great slaw, red pepper sauce and the perfect cheese. It's served with a side of various fries but for $18 it's overpiced.

The churro was perfect. Warm dough fried and tossed in cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate and Duce de leche. I'd order it again. The fried ice cream was also killer. It's served with a smorgasbord of sides including pineapple, Mexican creme, Burbon syrup, bananas and peanut butter and strawberries. 

As for the service, it was constantly delayed. We had to ask then wait 5 minutes for appetizer plates so the apps became cold, we needed ketchup with our burgers and she didn't come back after our food was delivered for over 10. Then delayed the check and bringing back our cards as well. Our dinner took entirely too long based on service alone.

3583734,2014-05-20,6,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"2 words: FOOD POISONING!!!
Let me start this by saying that I do not drink alcohol so that y'all don't think it was alcohol poisoning. 

I ordered the burger that had bleu cheese. I'm not quite sure what it was called, but i know it was $18.00. I also ordered the Vegas Fries as an appetizer for our table to share.

The fries were nothing special. They are wedge cut and come with some sort of ranch dressing on the side. I really only ordered them because I LOVE bleu cheese. 

As soon as I bit into my burger, I told everyone sitting with me that the burger was not good. It was extremely dry and the meat was soooo thick it was hard to chew and even harder to swallow. 

Anywho, I did not like the burger but I ate it anyway because I was starving. I couldn't finish it because it was soooo dry. So I left a little less than half. I was completely unsatisfied but I did not care enough to send it back. 

We paid and went on our merry way to enjoy our last night in Sin City. I got back to the room and a few hours later I had to run to the bathroom to throw everything up. I'm sorry if this is too much info but it's what happened. I threw up 4 times and all 4 times it was the hamburger patty and the bleu cheese. It was the worst feeling ever. And then a little something else hit me, but I won't mention that. Around my eye area, I saw that I was starting to develop these little red dots all over and a little above my forehead. It had to have been an allergic reaction to the bad meat. Now I thought it was just me, but that morning when we were heading down to valet, one of the girls who was in our party but staying in a different hotel told me she threw up 3 times and it was ALL of the burger. She had the same burger as I did. Coincidence? I think not. 

2 nights before, we had eaten at Gordon Ramsay's BURGR, and I had also ordered a burger with bleu cheese and I was perfectly fine. 

I hate to base my review on my experience but I can guarantee I'll never go back because just the thought of walking by there makes me sick to my stomach. 

I had to catch a flight back and I was terrified of not making it to the bathroom in time in case it hit me again. 

I will say this, even before I got sick, I did not like the taste of any of the food. 

Sorry for the TMI but I just needed to get this out there.",hvRgSHf6w70XDz5Ot9HZ7w,9,4,1,wQFi8yRtZTQJnqdqCb9G3Q

3612423,2018-05-10,2,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Like many, I came here for the burger. Good experience overall. I'd say their burgers are worth trying. 

This was a solo trip, so I ate at the bar. This was on a Wednesday afternoon in May, so there was no wait. There were others eating/drinking at the bar, and I had several seats to choose from. They have a good ratio of TVs going, if that's your thing. And pop music playing, not too loudly. The outdoor seating is shaded and looked fine. 

Burger: the menu had 5 options. Honestly they all sounded good. I was tempted to get the Mac n cheese burger since that's the award winner and most popular, but I went with the turkey burger. 
Wait time on the burger was reasonable, probably about 15 minutes. I learned from the bartender that they make all their patties from scratch, including the veggie burger (which she recommended and to add cheese to it if you get it), so the wait time makes sense. The bartender said her favorite is the pastrami burger, which she said was massive. 

The turkey burger tasted great overall. It's a large burger and very filling. The char on the edge of the burger was really tasty and the patty was savory, tender, and flavorful. The poblano peppers, red onions, and bacon combined together nicely. Not all bites were the same, and in a way that made the eating its own adventure. That said, the edges where the char was and the middle were the best parts, and the others decent but not as good. I've had a lot of turkey burgers at restaurants: this one was unique and probably the best one so far.  

Constructive criticism: I was disappointed with the pretzel bun - the top was too small and the bun was dry and kind of hard. Also, I thought the burger didn't have enough onion jam and donkey sauce. Where I tasted the jam I liked it. I asked the bartender for more donkey sauce, and to try the bourbon bbq sauce for kicks (since I didn't order the original ringer burger). The bourbon sauce was just ok (too bourbon forward and sweet for my taste), but I liked the donkey sauce. Adding those  made the burger better. The sauces go well with the fries too. 

Service was good. Friendly, attentive (timely, repeated water refills!), and receptive to questions / giving recommendations / requests.

It was relatively busy, so I'm willing to overlook the slow pace of service.  The food, however, was just mediocre.  I think all four of us expected something more.  HUGE portions and HUGE flavor were expected.  The portions lived up to expectations, but unfortunately the food didn't.  

I ordered the mac n cheese burger and while it was pretty large, the mac n cheese on it was very bland and the bacon was kind of chewy.  A friend ordered the fireball chicken wings and the wings were small, and it only came with 7 wings.  Another of us ordered the cajun chicken sandwich.  Here is where you would really expect some big flavor, but it was just so-so.  My fiance ordered the ribs (33 bucks for a rack...not too bad for a strip restaurant with a famous dude's name attached) and those were definitely the best thing on our table.  They were tender and smoky and had a lot of flavor.  The rack of ribs came with cornbread that was pretty dry and normal...nothing special, and a small cup of the same bland mac n cheese that was on my burger.  We also ordered the Vegas Fries to share as a table...those were actually pretty tasty.

I'd love to give this place more stars but it just doesn't live up to any expectation we had going on.",ByVNS6P4ENaZ8eJU-1fgrA,2,1,3,f9L_BbA1OcEwQcO6nAK2Hw

3619850,2015-01-28,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"It hurts my heart to give Guy's restaurant a 3. It just didn't blow my mind as I thought it would.

First off, the menu is extensive and everything that Guy Fieri stands for. The menu even reads like Guy talks. Fries, loaded fries, wings, burgers, brisket, sandwiches, salads, dessert...it's a big menu. They also have breakfast as well. I would like to come back and try breakfast -- we came for lunch.

We started off with the Fireball Whisky Wings - they were an interesting flavor, you can definitely taste the Fireball, but they were a bit dry. The wasabi blue cheese that it comes with is delicious. Overall, not my favorite. I'd like to try the General Tso's next time as our neighbor table got them and enjoyed them a lot. The burgers sound ginormous, but they actually are very manageable, so don't be afraid. I got the Triple B Burger ($19 creole blackening spice, blue cheese, bacon,lettuce, tomato, onion, donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche). Underwhelming in flavor - I wouldn't order it again. My girlfriends both got the Mac & Cheese Burger and they loved it. 

The service was the pits. We were drawn in by the ""Hangover Recovery- Build Your Own Bloody Mary"" sign, as we really needed a recovery. When I asked our waitress if I could see the Bloody Mary menu, she said ""pick a vodka and pick a spice level 1-5."" We had no idea how much they cost and were disappointed because that didn't seem like ""building"" to me. I went on the website to look at the food menu to help jog my memory as I write this review, and, there is absolutely a menu for the build your own bloody mary (you choose a protein, you choose garnishes...I'm irritated). 

I would go back, because it's Guy Fieri, and the menu is extensive so I would hope for better service and to try something else that I would enjoy more.",-FuYIK8244zl00282CSDLQ,0,1,3,uTrc-kwIY8Ro4aMO_4bgNw

I really enjoyed the bloody Mary, and that was definitely the highlight, but really it was just just over the top. I feel like they're going for shock factor more than actually good food.

3633926,2015-03-24,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,I finally gave in and walked down to the Linq to see if Guy's burger kitchen and Bar wasn't too busy for my wife and myself to give it try. Lets face it for those who only visit here occasionally you have to pay the prices reflecting the high rent of being on the strip. The eateries don't have to worry about repeat business because new bodies show up everyday and service such as was at  Michael's (Barbary Coast) Is long in the past. Ok got there around 1:30 waited for about 25 min before we were seated. My wife got the Asian chicken wraps (15) and I ordered the original ringer burger (18) yes 18.00 for a burger. Ordered the burger medium. It arrived overcooked and dry (not even a hint of pink). I cut it in half and we shared the wraps also. They were just meh. Since we live on the strip it's hard to pay the going prices for mediocre food. We see no need for a return visit. We don't eat much fast food fare but in our consensus the all natural burger at Carl's Jr. will stand up to any in the valley. CKE has good angus beef. Haven't tried the Gordon Ramsey burger but honestly what can be done to a burger to make it cost over 10 bucks. Seems like the real bargain is a little further down.

It was a Saturday night around 8 so the crowds were starting to pick up, thankfully when we went up to the hostess stand for two there was no long wait. We chose to sit outside on their patio (which was beautiful by the way), at the end of November it wasn't freezing outside. The patio was adorned with heaters and TV's and it wasn't uncomfortable at all. Unfortunately we had to wait a little bit of time to get greeted by our server, think there may have been some confusion as to who was our server because it was a few different girls that helped us.
 
ANYWAYS it didn't take us long to look through the menu and decide what we wanted. My best friend ordered the Mac and Cheese burger, and I ordered the Motley Que sandwich (bbq brisket and cole slaw with French fries) with two shots of ""frozen"" crown royal and patron shots. (9 bucks a piece...not worth it If you ask me but we were paying strip prices so I digress). Everything up to that point was pretty decent until we got to the food. My sandwich was built nicely but lacked in execution, the fries (which I don't know if I still like the three types of fries in one thing) were just okay. Nothing to spectacular or flavorful. The meat was flavored okay, not really hot or sweet. What was horrible was that I would eat the sandwich and the meat would completely fall to the floor. The cole slaw was dry and not saucy. It was just an OKAY sandwich. Wouldn't come back or spend 19 bucks on it again. My friend's experience was the same. Burger was stacked so high once she took a bite everything fell out. The mac and cheese had absolutely no flavor. And even her burger was lukewarm. The ambience was nice and the service was pretty decent BUT we most likely would never come back. Theres no point.

The fries were over seasoned, cold and stale.  The sandwiches had too much bread in relation to the other ingredients.  The cocktail (bloody mary bowl) was flashy, with lots of edibles skewered on top, but was $40.  The macaroni n cheese burger was the best thing we ordered and even it was only decent.  This was a decent burger with a scoop of mac n cheese on top, which added a nice creaminess to the sandwich.  The trash can nachos were also pretty tasty with bbq brisket chunks mixed in.  The desert (fried s'more sandwich) was decent, but also had too much brioche in relation to the filling inside.

The restaurant is located at The Linq which is on the strip, it was not very difficult to find which was a relief. The line was already formed when we arrived but as usual parties began to leave due to not wanting to wait and we were seated in about 15-20 minutes outside with prime seating to watch the final four NCAA game. 
The first thing that came as a pleasant surprise was then having dead guy ale which is one of my favorite beers. We decided to start our meal with the pepperoni wrapped pretzel sticks with fondu dip.

Our waiter promptly greeted us & took our order. We had to hunt him down after finishing our dinner to get our check. It should be noted that even though it was a Friday night, the restaurant wasn't all that busy.

3705251,2016-07-24,4,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Extremely underwhelming. Let me first start off by saying that my boyfriend and I decided to head to Flavor Town solely as the punchline of a joke... In no way did I expect the entire experience to be a joke.

We came towards the end of the night, so as we were seated, we were given a late night menu - which is fine. Lots of places do that. There were a few not-very-different things you could choose from, including a drink menu. By ""not-very-different,"" I mean maybe 3 different burgers, 2 different kinds of wings, something called ""Vegas Fries""... Not a whole lot of variety, which surprised me. So, my boyfriend went with an $18 bacon burger (can't remember the name) and I got the ""Vegas Fries"" for $13 - which was the cheapest thing on the menu, mind you... My only thought was, ""Well, this sh*t better be good.""

Boy, was I wrong. My boyfriend said his burger was okay. Nothing special and definitely not worth $18. The ""Vegas Fries"" were also lackluster. They should change the description to something a little more fitting, something like ""Potato wedge spirals drenched in buffalo sauce and warm bleu cheese. No, seriously, DRENCHED. So sopping wet that these weird fries will fall apart in minutes if you don't eat them NOW."" They were just plain gross. And there's no way anyone could eat the amount they give you. It's like 10 f***ing lb. of spicy mush potatoes. So unnecessary.

On top of that, the service was spotty. We were helped by like, 3 different people because our waitress decided to giggle on her phone RIGHT BEHIND US. I really do not care if I see someone on their phone, please just do your job in the meantime... but that was absolutely ridiculous.

The one redeeming quality of this place is the decor. So corny, so meme-worthy. You couldn't take 10 steps without seeing Guy Fieri's big, red face. The patio area was nice despite it being 110 degrees at 11:00 PM. Woulda been cool to feel misters or something. Oh well. Don't care.

Well, with my last trip to Vegas, I went there with an open mind and I was really impressed.  And definitely blown away with generous portion sizes they serve.  Note that I went here with my mom just for a late lunch\afternoon snack since we were having dinner elsewhere later that night.

The real main reason why I decided to eat here was because I saw their Sashimi Won-Tacos on Eater Vegas.  They looked incredible!  So I ordered that and by the host's recommendation, we ordered the BBQ Brisket Trash Can Nachos as well.

SASHIMI WON-TACOS -- http://bit.ly/2inEqUO
sashimi-grade ahi tuna packed into crispy wonton shells with mango-jicama salsa, sweet soy, scallions + wasabi cream
The tacos were amazing!!  They're basically like tuna tartare in taco form but they looked pretty and tasted delicious.  Although the portion size is a bit small, you do get four tacos and a good amount of tuna inside each one.  It's a great appetizer that can also be just a light afternoon snack.

TRASH CAN BRISKET NACHOS -- http://bit.ly/2inJZ5Q
corn tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce, jalapeños, crema, pico de gallo, house-smoked beef brisket burnt ends + chipotle BBQ sauce
Whoa!!  This was a hot mess, but a tasty hot mess.  It comes to your table literally in a small trash can and then the server unloads it on the serving plate.  It's an impressive site to see and a smart way to prepare and serve nachos since there wasn't a single chip that was naked.  And I was glad to see that they didn't skimp on the brisket and cheese sauce.  The brisket was smokey and full of flavor and there was so much cheese sauce that I really couldn't stop eating the nachos.  I'm glad I got to share this with my mom because I definitely couldn't tackle this all by myself.

I wouldn't mind coming back again to Guy Fieri's.  I want to try more things off their menu.  Their Mac & Cheese Burger was voted the Best Burger in Vegas so I'm definitely going to have to go back and try it.

I'm a fan of Guy Fieri, I love to watch Triple D. With that being said, I am disappointed in his Vegas Kitchen And Bar. My wife and I have gone twice now. The first time we went, the hostess acted very bored and could care less about us. I guess I was expecting a Guy Fieri like enthusiasm. And to be honest, I guess that would not be fair to do. 

The second time around, We arrived sat down at about 11:30. Our server took our order, about 20 minutes later our server came back and claimed that the kitchen was running slow. Mind you, the place was maybe half full. After eating our server gave us the bill which was printed about the same time we were told about the kitchen being slow. I felt like maybe it was the server who was slow to give the kitchen . Was I lied to? I sure felt like it.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,3,6,3,Vt8NOM1wGO0gwcCtZGe_xA

We got the trash can nachos and they were ok, besides the sauce on the brisket. Waaaay too sweet. For sure not worth $20. The Mac and cheese burger was not ooey gooey cheesey like advertised. I've had better from other restaurants. Mac and cheese seemed like it had been sitting for a while. We also ordered the blackened chicken pasta. The flavor was decent but in no way was this blackened chicken. Can get this same dish at Chili's for less than Guy's $39.

We stumbled in on Valentine's Day around 3pm as we were traipsing around Vegas. We knew we wouldn't be able to get in anywhere else on Valentine's Day any later in the evening, so when we were told that it would only be a 10-15 minute wait, we went for it.

We weren't super hungry, so we opted for just drinks and a couple apps.
We got the fondue dippers, fireball whisky wings, & the Caesar salad which comes in a giant crouton.

The service was okay. There were a few times when I would have liked a refill and there was nobody, but they came eventually.

The food was also only ok.

The fondue dippers were okay in my book, but my husband didn't really care for them and only ate one. The pepperoni on them was a bit waxy, but the cheese dip was good I thought. We ate about half the app.

The salad looked cooler than anything else. The giant crouton ring was awesome, but it wasn't super flavorful. The dressing was okay.

The fireball whisky wings were definitely the best part of the meal. They were cut into lollipops which I enjoy if I have to have wings with bones (I'm a boneless fan) and the sauce was delicious. It was spicy and sweet at the same time. I would definitely enjoy having those again, but I could leave the rest.

I would be interested in trying the mac n' cheese burger since it won best burger in Vegas and looked great, but other than that and those wings, I don't think I'd order anything else.

The portions and presentation are huge, and I notice a lot of people don't finish. For lunch I had the Turkey Burger, which the menu implied was spicy but wasn't, though definitely flavorful. I kind of deconstructed it as I got full.

I returned for breakfast and had the Maple Bacon French Toast - the candied bacon and bruleed banana were excellent, but the french toast was a little dry. I made it through about half the toast.

Now think of taking his hit show and making it into an actual restaurant you can eat at while visiting one of the best cities in the world. This restaurant of your dreams exists and it just so happens to be located in Las Vegas, NV at The Linq Hotel & Casino.

Not if but when you decide to visit Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar one dish you need to try is the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. This dish consist of pepperoni-wrapped pretzels served with a smoky melted  provolone and italian pork sausage cheese dip, topped with fresh diced tomato and basil. It is best paired with Guinness Stout. I am a huge 'dip anything into melted cheese' fan so this dish was right up my alley! The cheese is smooth and rich and you got pepperoni in almost every single bite! As long as you don't mind you and your other guests double dipping then this dish is definitely a priority.

When it comes to dessert I love anything chocolate. So we ordered the Triple-Double Mint Pie. Dear God, all you mint chocolate chip fans are in for a serious mind blow. This dish consist of a giant humungous serving of mint chocolate chip ice cream, oreo cookies stuck all over it, mint candies and hot fudge poured over the entire thing. Big enough for like a million people I swear this desert was insane ..... ly good! LOL! :) A must try!

Every dish I had here has been amazing but those two stuck out in my mind the most. Make sure to visit Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar and at least try these 2 meals. I only hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

Thank you Guy Fieri for traveling the country and bringing such amazing dishes to us here in Sin City!

The Mac n cheese was good but I was imagining it to be very gooey and cheesy when in reality it was a bit more like baked mac n cheese (more solid than ooeygooey)  The fry trio was awesome. They were perfectly hot and salty though I wish I had a touch more ketchup. The margaritas were a bit small for $15 but is to be expected with the Vegas Strip I guess. My punch bowl drink was amazing and tasted just like I imagined it would so even though it was expensive I would certainly order it again!

3773381,2016-02-04,7,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Sorry Guy, my experience wasn't the ""real deal.""

It started off great. We were seated right away, in a corner table with a strip view. We browsed the breakfast menu, which is pretty limited. I understand keeping things simple but not everyone wants a huge plate of food. For instance, I like basic eggs & potatoes but don't care for breakfast meat. My only option was to choose the classic plate, which comes with bacon & sausage. 

Yes, total rewards members get $1 off. My eggs & potatoes put me back $15. Fine, we ordered and waited. Then waited some more. Saw larger tables sat after us, on both sides of us get waited on and served their meals. We were still waiting. When our plates finally did arrive, nearly an hour later - I tried to eat the meats on the plate, as I paid for them but the bacon was cold & flabby. I couldn't even cut through the sausage & it had a very odd taste to it. My daughter tried a bite & spot it out. The potatoes were very good and I did enjoy the complimentary watermelon & mint gazpacho shot. Unfortunately, the sage biscuit was dry and my eggs were cold. 

Although multiple servers looked at us and helped other tables around us, no one mentioned or apologized for the incredible delay in the delivery of our cold food. No compensation was given at all on the check. 

The bright side is that they make a pretty good chocolate milk?

It was packed for Friday night which is normal for any restaurant. We waited about 15 minutes. We sat outside near the strip so we can see the people walking up and down the street. Our server Chris was funny as hell. He made our first time coming here very fun and he also recommended some items on the menu. The first thing I got was a shot of fireball whiskey. Next the hubby and I decided what we were going to get. He got the off the hook burger. I got the Triple B burger. We got our food the presentation was good. All the burgers come with fries and its just not one set of Fri you have a mixture of fries there are crinkle cut fries Criss cut fries and steak fries all mixed together in a small dish. They are seasoned with this dry barbecue rub that is so good especially when you dip the fries and ranch. Not to mention that the ranch is homemade which is really good. The hubby and I could not even finish our burgers they were so big and so good. We said we would definitely be back because we want to try the tacos that he has on the menu.

The Quad is really starting to shape into an attractive Vegas casino.. as long as you don't see their hotel rooms. haha
The addition of Guy Fieri's restaurant, along with Hash House, really steps up the food game in this area of the strip..

Food: Going through the menu, there weren't a lot of fancy-shmancy ingredients or toppings.. just your classic all-American foods assembled into fantastic combinations.
I decided to go with the Mac+Cheese Bacon Burger.. the ultimate burger throw-up! The patty: very thin but wide, coming out of the burger covering the entire bottom bun.. while the bacon and mac&cheese slightly oozed out on top of the patty. This is the true definition of a ""beautiful mess"". Very tasty burger, loved the 5-cheese mac&cheese and the simple ""backyard BBQ"" grilled type of burger. 
The fries that came with the burger came in 3 types: ridged, curly, and wedges.. awesome!
We also ordered the Triple-T fries which was like truffle overload with gouda. We didn't get to try any of the specialty cocktails.. there were many interesting concoctions that we'll definitely try next time.

Ambiance: I'd describe it as an Ed Hardy-themed restaurant.. even the napkins had skulls. haha. A lively restaurant with high, exciting energy. If you're there for lunch, definitely sit outside.. you get the view of the walkway between Harrah's and The Quad, and the front of Caesars. I'm not sure how it is at night but probably crazy loud with Harrahs' Carnival court right next door.

Service: Staff was great.. there were two consistent servers continually checking on us. It was a bit of a wait for our food to come out but I give them a little leeway since the restaurant's still brand new.

Tips: Don't pass up this place if you're torn on what to eat on the strip. Grab a burger, a few drinks, and enjoy!",xpaIV92-DStPlBjyfITZqA,6,4,4,8KfAtkPHtYYlyIs7ILmegw

The chicken sandwich was so greasy that I could not finish it. I had a pool of grease on my ""plate"" which is hard to say since their food is served on a wood cutting board. If there is enough grease to soak through the wax paper and soak into the wood ""plate"" and still leave a puddle, there is a problem. 

The mac and cheese burger was just as bad. Something on the burger caused the bottom bun to become a soggy mess. My wife had to resort to eating the burger with a fork and leaving the bottom bun behind. While I appreciate the cook helping us watch our carbs, we would have liked to make that decision ourselves. 

My wife also ordered the berry mojito. It was undrinkable. The bartender put so much mint in it that when my wife fished it out of the glass and placed it on her plate, she could have made a side salad out of it. I'm certain this must have been their way of helping us eat healthy, after all, they were helping us watch are carbs with the buns too.

There's not really a waiting area so I guess if you wanted to you could roam around the casino for a bit. First of all, I want to say our waiter was amazing! He was serving a big party and the rest of his tables but he was able to check up on us pretty frequently. He was such a fun guy to talk to and he gave us recommendations for everything on the menu.

We ordered the sashimi won-tacos for our appetizer and they were really good! Probably my favorite part of my meal. I got the mac+cheese bacon burger for my main course that comes with a bunch of different cut fries. It was good and definitely a big portion but not the best burger I've had. My brother got the same thing and said it's now his favorite burger he's ever tasted. So to each their own. For dessert we shared the Guy's cheesecake challenge. On paper it sounds good, in front of you it looks amazing, but when I actually tasted it, it fell short. The potato chips and pretzels give it a nice contrast of textures to the large mound of cheesecake, which isn't overly sweet. I just didn't find myself wanting more of it after a few spoonfuls.

My friend and I were looking for a place to drink and have dinner after going to a concert at Caesar's Palace and we decided to check this place out.

We walked in at 10:05pm on a Saturday night and immediately ordered a round of draft beers since they offer a late night Happy Hour.

However, despite everyone around us having some really intriguing looking plates of food...we could not potentially experience any of that for ourselves.

Why? Because full menu was not available after 10pm.

Are you kidding me? Center Strip in Las Vegas on a Saturday night?

As Guy would say, ""Shut the front door!"" No, you might as well, if you're going to do this in Las Vegas on a weekend.

Our bartenders apologized to us, said it was a ""new thing"" and all agreed it was an incredibly stupid idea.

So, we finished that one round of drinks and walked out to find a nice dinner at one of the many other options nearby, ALL of which were serving their full menu past 10pm.

They have an option for indoor seating which features awesome brown cow print bar stools or covered outdoor seating allowing for people watching and music courtesy of Carnival's DJ. 

We chose the later, it was a relatively cooler day (in Vegas terms) so outdoor seating was obvious. I chose the Greek salad with the barbecue chicken wings as an appetizer. Our waiter was nice enough and took our orders quickly and got us our drinks. Side note, our waters had some of the largest ice cubes (actual cubes) that I had ever seen in my life - I was amazed. I was also pleasantly surprised by the speediness in which our food came out. 

The chicken drumsticks were ingenious, each drumstick was trimmed down leaving the meat at the bottom of the bone almost creating a handle making it super easy to bite down without the mess. The plate was accompanied by a delicious sauce that I can only guess was a creamy ranch and a bowlful of fresh veggies. 

My Greek salad was a complete work of art in multiple layers, so pretty but in the end a little hard to eat. The base layer of my salad featured hummus and then built upon that were romain lettuce spears, garbanzo beans, red and yellow tomato chunks, cucumbers, feta cheese triangles, croutons and topped off with shredded parmesan. The salad was drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette which I was most excited about however it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. As mentioned before it was difficult to cut into the spears without contents of my salad spilling onto the table so in the end I just picked up the spears with my hands and ate it that way, not a big deal but messy nonetheless. 

During my meal I noticed how attentive the wait staff was, constantly checking on our party and others in our area. At one point a manager even came over to introduce herself to us. I realized why at the end when we were paying, inside of their bill placards they have an iTouch installed so patrons can take surveys about their experience at the restaurant.

And I would follow THAT up by saying how disappointed I was in his restaurant at The Linq in Las Vegas. The fiancee and I came in with realistic expectations. Sure, Strip restaurants come terribly overhyped and overpriced. But we arrived open-minded and craving a solid dining experience. We left underwhelmed and unfortunately, still hungry. 

The wait for a #table4two was an hour at 11AM on a weekday. Luckily, we found ourselves the last two seats at the interior bar. The female bartender was very dry and lacked any of the hospitality that I picture from a Guy Fieri restaurant. The design of the place reminded me of a rockstar barn, with cow print bar stools and loud televisions. And I thought that would be the only downside.

But the food was bland at best. The recommended Vegas Fries lacked any texture and crispness. It was basically a serving of fries with buffalo sauce suffocating the basket. The Mac and Cheese Burger was nothing special, with the flavors just meshing together into one big mess. Nothing was overly distinct, not the Mac, not the brioche bun, nor the bacon. And when the bacon doesn't even stand out, something is definitely wrong. We did have the Bloody Mary, which somewhat saved the experience.

But the biggest blunder of this place is the service. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but the customer experience was lacking. Water glasses were never filled, food was not checked up on, and the lady next to us was delivered the wrong burger altogether. There was a certain nonchalance about the whole place.

I did enjoy the look of this restaurant and the table settings, but unfortunately, that was about it.

After about an hour wait, we were seated at a two-top and waited approx.15 minutes for anyone to stop at our table.  A gentleman took our drink order and advised that our waitress, Erica, would be over shortly.  Our drinks came about 7 or 8 minutes later, but Erica did not materialize for 15 minutes.  We ordered our appetizer and entrees from Erica, who acted very annoyed to be there.  After almost 2 hours of wait time since arrival, I expected our food to be pretty good, but I was less than impressed.

Appetizer: Fondue Dippers- $14- 1/5- Pepperoni-wrapped Pretzels with a provolone fondue.  Super Salty.  We were expecting warm, soft pretzels, however these were just very stale salted snack-food pretzel rods wrapped in extremely salty pepperoni accompanied by a bowl of flavorless melted cheese.  Inedible Fail.

Entrees: 

Big Dipper- $19- 1/5- Supposedly a Philly Cheesesteak, this sandwich contained fatty, greasy, bland meat, topped by greasy cheese.  One bite of this sandwich were enough for me.  The waffle fries would have probably been fine if they were not aggressively coated with what tasted like BBQ chip flavoring that made them too salty to eat. Double Fail.

Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger: $20- 2/5- A bacon cheeseburger topped with a scoop of macaroni and cheese.  The quality of the meat was once again an issue with this burger.  It just was not very good.

Cocktails:

Austin Sweet Tea: $14- 3/5- Deep eddy sweet tea vodka, peach schnapps, lemon juice.  Although this drink was tasty it was a little too sweet for me.

Crazy Hagar: $14- 3/5- Sammy's beach bar rum, mint, lime juice, & cherry ale.  I enjoyed the fresh mint leaves in this cocktail.

Both of these drinks were mostly ice, so I consider them very overpriced at $14 ea.

A peek into the kitchen reveals large heat lamps. Disappointing. We're local and won't return. While the menu offers a great selection of comfort food dishes, paying a premium for COLD food is not palatable. Server never stoped by to check on us after initial order. See pic of food under lamps. If you enjoy cold and limpy French fries and overpriced cold burgers, you'll enjoy Guy's restaurant by the Linq.

I always thought he was such a nice down to earth guy. 
We are locals and have been there a few times even though the prices are ridiculous because we wanted to support who we thought was a good guy. $15 for fries and $20 for a burger is not worth it to support someone who does not appreciate his fans.

Immediately upon entering you're greeted by a thirty foot Guy Fieri picture whose eyes tend to follow you, no matter where you go. Occasionally throughout the meal I made awkward eye contact with Guy. I felt judged. Seriously, it was a little weird.

Service: three different servers asked us if we wanted drinks, which is better than no servers asking if you want drinks, but a little bothersome. Water glasses remained full and $12 mimosa and Bloody Mary were ok. Service was attentive overall, but didn't take our app plate when the entrees came, making it a bit crowded at the table. 

Food: for an appetizer we had the fondue dippers. The cheese sauce was decent, but the breadsticks were more difficult to manage than food should be. Long, dry breadsticks wrapped in pepperoni and dusted with Parmesan cheese. I don't know if they put them in the oven or what, but they were lukewarm and broke easily. Kind of messy. 

My wife had a Caesar salad and the dressing was not good, way too much cheese, and bland overall. It came with something called the ""mega crouton"" which looked like a bread boomerang.  No joke. She could barely eat any of it. $17 Caesar salad failure.  

I had the mayor of flavor town burger, or something like that. It had pastrami on the burger with Asian slaw in a pretzel bun. Came with a fry medley. This is not the kind of burger you can pick up and eat, which was what I was hoping for. If you're dressed nice and away from your hotel, handle with extreme caution. I ended up dismantling it with a fork and knife, but it still wasn't anything special. The fries were good. 

We noticed some other diners having trouble with sandwiches, and I felt a little guilty when I didn't warn the table next to us when they placed their order for burgers.  We found humor in some of the decor and staff uniforms, and had a pretty good time despite the food, but your $95 with tip would be better spent elsewhere.

In short, everything was very average, with no standouts at all...not even the appetizers (which were VERY stingy on portion size)

 Initial contact was okay, but waiting for someone to come to the table and take our orders was a lot longer than it should have been, especially considering that the majority of staff were just lounging about by the bar, on their phones and chatting because they were bored. Most never even looked in our direction or smiled. Apparently, what they were doing was much more absorbing and important than paying any attention to us. 

 The place was practically empty, yet we were seated in an area that made it hard to flag down any staff (as no one was walking around), and also made us apparently invisible to them.

When we finally got our food, my partners burger seemed okay, but she didn't look super happy about it.
 My burger somehow came out overcooked, yet only lukewarm. I did get a replacement which was better, but by then, I had already stopped caring. I took two bites, and left it there, not even wanting to take it home. 

IMHO, unless you're from the middle of nowhere, have never traveled to or eaten anyplace than where you live, and have no clue what actual good food tastes like (ie: a trip to Golden Corral is saved for special occasions, as it's a step up from the usual crap you eat), then you'll be disappointed.

3970956,2014-08-03,9,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I came here with two Yelp friends, Michael U. and Chris V., to try the restaurant's new breakfast menu.  I was here opening night and wanted to make a return visit.  The new breakfast menu was a good reason to go.

We were seated promptly and was brought our coffee.  There was a question about the coffee they used and the server was a little flustered.  More on that later.  We were brought two cups of regular coffee.  We ordered four items that were to be brought as two separate courses.  That's exactly what was done.

We started with the chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy and the Dragon's Breath chili cornbread Benedict.  The chicken fried bacon was nothing special except for the different take on the normal breakfast dish.  The biscuits were flavored perfectly and the pepper flavored gravy was good.  The cornbread of the Benedict was very soft and tasty.  For me, Dragon's breath indicates a hot, spicy flavor.  While there was some heat, it was certainly no Dragon.  But that's my taste buds.  I completely liked this dish.

During our eating, the executive chef, Anthony Leitera, came to the table to respond to our question about the Stumptown coffee that had been asked of the server.  He couldn't answer the question and said he'd send the beverage person to answer.  Before he left, he checked on how we were enjoying breakfast.

The server then brought out part 2 of our order, shortbread pancake and berry pot pie and maple bacon French toast.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pancake pot pie.  I agree with Chris V.'s comments about it falling apart easily.  The pancakes were very soft and the berry filling tended to make cutting and sharing a bit difficult.  I didn't use any of the syrup with the pancake as I tend to eat them without syrups.  The maple bacon French toast was quite good.  Once again the bacon was the weak point.  The candied bacon was nothing special but I really liked the French toast and the brûléed banana slices.  Again, I used no syrup.  The French toast was very moist throughout although the ends were not cooked crisp.

With each dish we received a small glass of juice that was watermelon, orange, and grapefruit combination that was a nice palate cleanser.

During our time there, the GM, Michael Speagle, stopped by to see how we were doing and thank us for our patronage.  

Enough time had gone by that the lunch menu was now available so we decided to share one more dish--the S'mores Monte Cristo.  It's a Monte Cristo made from brioche with a graham cracker butter and stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate and served with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  We used the sauces not for dipping but for pouring over.  This was a excellent!

We had a glitch with the splitting of checks the way we planned but that was rectified.  

While I'm probably not going to be here often, I can see myself returning with a friends to split like we did today.  The process are Strip prices.  Note to Total Rewards members--$1 off each menu item with your TR card.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,11,4,OsY8ufBeQmuBSRPcu5DEhA

My first thought was I ordered the wrong the thing.  The helpful bartenders recommended the  Bacon Mac n Cheese.  Ok Tomorrow lets try this again. Like i said im huge fan of his show.

The fondue appetizer was fantastic and our burgers were amazing. They are the thinner, more tender type burgers, and were very juicy and packed with flavor.

Speaking of which, kudos to them for keeping prices reasonable. They could have pillaged us with exorbitant ""celebrity chef"" prices, but instead the prices are on par w the average Vegas strip brewpub, with much better quality. 

My only suggestion is that outside, when the water misters shut off, flies were a problem (in the summer). For comfort and fly control, they should stay on later. Opt to eat inside if you're concerned (or outside in the winter).

Welcome to Flavortown!  If you are a ultra picky foodie this might not be the place for you.  However if you like real good food with even better service this is the place for you to go!
For an App our family of four had the nachos to share.  Really tasty.  The cheese and topping to chip ratio is better than any other restaurant I have been to.  The flavors are spot on.  Just enough spice to make it all really tasty.
Mains were the street tacos (you got five small tacos with two dipping sauces), and the mac and cheese burger.  The street tacos were really good and almost overstuffed the small tortillas.  The burger was very good.  Too bad I didn't see the mac and cheese as a dish or side.  I would have ordered it.  Fries are also fantastic.  Just enough of a spice to make them a little different.  Warning the burger is messy.  You will get the napkin dirty.  
Service was also really good, place has great food.  Hopefully he branches this concept out to more than Vegas.  I will be back!",hsBD6AIXlaMUlvaoy5Dlkg,1,1,5,fEHXHVFKgNDg3GQOxMtlmA

The advice was right, because the burgers we had were one of a kind without a doubt. They were cooked/grilled to perfection, and the toppings were all such a strange, weird combination although they fit perfectly together to make a taste unlike one I've ever had before.

Our server was the low point of the meal. I can't recall his name, although I wish I did. We waited for 15 minutes for him to come to our table, and when he did he was very chippery and happy, and I liked that. I requested a plain turkey burger, something he didn't seem to comprehend. I guess not all restaurants use the same lingo for food? I don't know. He told me to ""speak up, help me out here, what do you want, what do you not want?"" I just looked at him, and said ""a PLAIN turkey burger, meaning NOTHING but the meat and patty."" He told me that was impossible. Huh? The turkey burger was really the only burger that caught my eye, and I really did not like all the toppings on it - I don't eat bacon and I can't eat onions (from the jam). Regardless, he made me think I was speaking a foreign language and told me he'd see what he could do.

After that point we paced ourselves on our drinks because we didn't know when the waitress would be back for refills. 
While waiting for our food, a waiter passed by our table carrying trays and ended up dropping them, splashing sauces on a member of my party--all on her arm, with spots on her shirt and shorts.

My friends are always willing to try new places so we went in.  There was a pretty long line, which led me to think it would be a long wait, but we were seated shortly after.  

We had two waitresses that took care of our table.  One took the order and brought out the food, and the other was for drinks.  This is something new to me, but was glad it worked out great.  I had my drinks refilled my times without having to ask for a refill.  

On to the food, our table ordered fireball whisky wings, double barrel bbq wings, triple t fries, and the mac and cheese bacon cheeseburger.  
The wings are like a lollipop style so sizes do vary.  Unfortunately, ours were on the smaller size.  We got a wing/pop that was a size of a quarter.  The fireball wings does have a spicy kick to it. Not overwhelmingly spicy but leaves a tingle.  Flavor was pretty good.  The double barrel bbq wing is pretty normal.  The mac and cheese burger was ginormous.  Good luck taking a bite out of this one.  I had to use a fork and knife to eat this burger.   I ordered it medium but it came out well done.  Was not cooked to order.  Wished the mac and cheese would were more cheesy.  Overall, the burger was a bit dry and lacking in flavor.

I ordered the '68 Cajun sandwich. The food was good although I expected it to have a bit more kick to it as far as the spiciness factor goes. It's pretty big. I had to use my knife and fork to break it down. My jaw was starting to hurt from trying to eat it like a normal hoagie. The menu doesn't state this but the sandwiches come with a small side order of fries so don't feel obligated to order one of the big-ass plates of specialty fries on the menu. Unless you want to.

For dessert, my wife and I split the the Triple Double Pie which is chocolate chip mint ice-cream combined with crushed wafer cookies and mint candy. More chocolate than mint. Our waiter referred to it as the Mount Fuji. Be warned that this dessert is ideal for four people. It was all we could do to finish it.

We arrived during breakfast hours, so we were limited to the breakfast menu. I scanned the offerings and quickly settled on Guy's Big Bite Burrito (""soft scrambled eggs, chorizo + breakfast potatoes, wrapped in a cheese quesadilla with pico de gallo, black beans, guacamole + crispy fried tortilla chips + salsa"").

It arrived to the table shortly after and was *enormous*. I was positive I wasn't going to be able to finish it, but as I am a pig finish it I did.

It's really good. The various components all work quite well together and there's a consistency to each bite that's actually pretty impressive. I suppose my one complaint would be the lack of a pronounced punch of flavor. Given Guy's onscreen persona, I admit I was expecting a much more robust trip to Flavortown.

Here for the Rock N Roll Marathon weekend.  Stopped in again on Saturday night.  We got the mac and cheese burger and Italian salad.  Both were outstanding as was the service at the bar!   5 stars!




From 2014:  2 stars -  Had breakfast this morning and was very disappointed.  I am a big fan of Guy Fieri's and went out of my way (passing 50+ other competitors to visit his new Vegas restaurant.

The food was very tasty and the portions were good however the service was not what I expected from one of his restaurants and that alone took away from our overall experience!

Hostess experience was average.  Seated immediately outside.

Waited 14 minutes for waiter to approach me.  No hello, no welcome to our restaurant!  ""Have you decided?"" is all I got.

Another 17 minutes go by and the food finally arrives luke warm.  Normally this wait might not seem like much but most other tables already had their food so the kitchen couldn't have been ""slammed"".

No refill on water.

Done eating.  Waited more than 15 minutes for waiter to return so I could get the check.

Tons of dirty tables with nobody cleaning off the dirty dishes.  

Note to waiter:  Pull up your pants Sai!  Nobody wants to see your boxers!

This shows that no matter how good the food - bad service takes the cake and leaves a lasting impression.

This is my 420th review, in case that has any special significance. I'm sure it does but I just can't think of it right now...

I was a little late to the occasion, but I still got to try a variety of items from the new breakfast menu. The maple bacon french toast was pretty good. I would have liked the brioche to have more of a crunch, but it was pretty fluffy. The candied bacon was a little more toward crunchy then chewy and if you like a sugar coating on your bacon, you're in for a treat. The brulee banana didn't really add that much contrasting texture or flavor for me, but maybe I've just been eating too much banana lately.

Shortbread pancake and berry ""pot pie"" didn't do it for me. Thought that the pancakes were too soft and fell apart a little bit too much (could be personal preference) and didn't have too much flavor. The berry compote and accompanying syrup are far from overly sweet and are actually a little sour, so at least you know they're not hiding the actual flavor of the berries.

Each of the dishes apparently came with a shot of a vegetable juice. Hopefully Michael or Norm have the full ingredient list down. I did like the juice, which didn't have any hints of foulness or additives. Nice of them to give you something healthy.

Since we stayed past breakfast (8-11am), we were able to split a dessert from the regular menu. It was the S'mores monte cristo. This was my favorite part of the meal, with the deep fry treatment crisping up the brioche from the french toast being and melting a bunch of marshmallow and chocolate (plus graham cracker butter, apparently). Chocolate and raspberry syrups upped the indulgence factor a ton, and I enjoyed every bite.

Ambiance: not too loud, classic American music like The Doors and The Beatles, apparently uses old tables and intentionally dinged menu covers (for the breakfast menu) to try to capture the been-around-a-while feel. Can't complain. 

Service: good as far as I saw, as they relocated our party to a larger table, brought out plates and utensils as needed, and never were absent for too long. I think they really emphasize service and want to show that they're trying hard by having a manager walk around to ask if everything's fine and by letting you review the experience through an app on the iPod/iPhone placed inside the checkbook.

I was hovering around a 3.5 rating, but since I generally look at 4 star places as ones that I would prefer to eat at again, I can't give that rating to this restaurant. It's Strip-priced and, based only on what I ate, I've been to better breakfast places around town in that price range or a slightly lower range. I did find it cool to see the open kitchen and to snap a picture of Guy's white jacket from his UNLV culinary school days, so Fieri fanatics may enjoy this place solely for the Guy branding.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,6,3,OHjqkc-nnDFHt8ETcMBoMQ

I noticed that this place looks like it should be sitting in Texas somewhere due to the atmosphere and the way the help staff was dressed. Never would have pegged Guys restaurant as country. 
The food was absolutely delicious! To start we ordered  the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. The cheese sauce for this was the best I had. I would have never put pepperoni around a pretzel stick but it was really good. My husband ordered the Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger, which we were told that it is the most popular burger they have.

We also had the nachos and crispy tuna tacos and they were okay, I would skip those. But the Mac and cheese burger was soooooo good with crispy bacon and amazing gooey mac and cheese. Oh and last but not least we had the cheesecake with potato chips and pretzels that was absolutely amazing, I have an obsession with salty sweet desserts. Hands down I would go here anytime I'm in Vegas at the end of the trip, because you will leave stuffed and feel very snorlax/ whale like and all that fat will help soak up the liqueur from the days before that you can't remember.",xmEzTRGQWeSyY8YY2J8DDA,1,0,4,qRVF_V6-qGiKFz0VGdJXEA

Don't be fooled by the prices, you really get what you pay for! I'm pretty sure you can share everything considering how monstrous the portions are.

Bacon Mac 'n' Cheese Burger: 4/5. The food was good, but nothing to be overly excited about. It was also a lukewarm when it came out. I would have loved to be served warm food. I shared with my boyfriend, and we were both pretty full afterwards!

Fireball whiskey wings: 5/5. My FAVORITE. Flavors were on par, and the dressing was absolutely amazing. I wish I could have more!

Boulder ice cream: 5/5 giant ice cream scoop wrapped in cereal, served with strawberries, pineapples, bananas and peanut butter, whipped cream, maple syrup, and chocolate syrup. All 4 of us shared it and were satisfied! Oh gosh, I loved it! It's too bad I need to burn it all off next week in the gym, but it was worth it!

Everything had tons of flavor, great texture, and fun presentation.  That what's boosted the rating an extra star.  This place lost a lot of stars because of the service or lack there of, especially with rude guests in the place.

We arrived at dinner time and had to wait for a table for a few minutes.  This was ok because it was obvious they were busy.  We were eventually seated at a nice table.  The music was loud and going for a party atmosphere, but it was the ok loud level most of us deal with on a regular basis.  

That was until the party of 15 were sat behind us.  They, the abnormally obnoxious group, obviously were tourists who think it is ok to behave like jerks everywhere they go because ""It's Vegas Baby!""  The whole group were drinking like crazy and acting like fools.  They were screaming and hollering and making all of the surrounding tables feel uncomfortable.  I know this because we talked to the tables on either side of us and we all though they were acting like idiots.  It got to the point where it was hard to talk to the person sitting right next to you because it was so loud. Im pretty sure several tables asked a manager to ask the group to quiet down a bit.  Every now and then you would hear someone from the group apologize for being loud right before they started screaming again.  Annoying.

Our server was also blah.  She was hardly present and did the bare minimum our entire stay.  We hardly saw her except to order and receive our food.  She was then gone until she dropped off the bill.  Bad, bad service.

Something that really annoyed me was the dessert options.  My 4 year old daughter asked for a scoop of ice cream.  I understand that wasn't on the menu, but I figured I would ask anyway.  I was in the food & bev business for a long time and I know everywhere I worked you could order a scoop of ice cream as long as the place had ice cream from casual to fine dining.  Our server said they do not do any side orders at all.  Since I had already promised her ice cream (thats a different story, but ice cream was a must), I had to order her a $15 HUGE do it yourself sundae thing that is meant for 4-6 people.  I thought this was just bad taste and bad customer service.  And annoyed me even more.

So the food is really good and totally ""Flavor Town"" level as GF says on his foodie shows, so yay for good food.  If I ever go back, it definitely will be during the day because later is just obnoxious, unless you are 21 and in a frat perhaps.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,18,15,2,auioA-EQbf0K2-BF3ISobQ

4147064,2015-09-28,2,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"During a recent visit with some family from out of town, we decided it would be fun to try Guy Fieri's Las Vegas restaurant.  We are all big fans of his.  I think the overall feeling of our visit is that it was worth trying once but this will not be a regular rotation location.  It was our mistake for going on a Friday night on the weekend of Life Is Beautiful.  Is there a worse time we could have chosen?  Perhaps New Years but that just seems crazy.  This was busy enough.  The Linq (hotel) was not even going to let us park valet because they were booked solid.  But there are a couple of elderly and handicapped members of our familial group that don't get around so well.  My dad told the valet attendant that we were going to Guy's and he took care of the parking situation for us.  Cool.  

So we get into the casino and put in a name for the seven of us to eat at Guy's. There was a long wait because it was so busy.  And there was very little seating outside of the restaurant for waiting purposes.  The bar was crowded too.  We got a couple of drinks and continued waiting.  When we finally got called up we were taken outside to the patio area.  It was hot and very loud with the adjacent Carnival Court just a few hundred feet away.  It was difficult to enjoy dinner when we were sweaty and struggling to hear each other.  Inside didn't seem much better.  Just as crowded and loud though noticeably cooler.

For all the people who were there I was surprised at how quickly our food came out.  Of course with a smaller menu such as this place has, the preparation must go quickly.  Opinions on the food were decidely mixed.  My aunt and I both got the onion ring burger.  She enjoyed it.  I thought is was over cooked.  But I like my burgers pink in the middle and she likes them well done.  My other aunt and my grandm split a beef dip.  My grandma did not seem to enjoy it much while my aunt loved it with the spicy horse radish sauce.  My dad and step mom both ordered a pulled pork sandwich which they seemed to like.  Most of us had fried with our meals.  The fries were intriguing.  You get shoe strings, crinkle cut and waffle cut fries all in one little paper taco.  The crinkle cut and waffle cut fries were my favorite because you can actually taste the potatoes.  Shoe string fries are too easy to over cook.  And they aren't the best for dipping in ketchup.    

This place is a hopping madhouse and very Fieri-centric.  There are pictures of him with celebrities everywhere.  And so many different products with his name/face.  The man is a marketing genious.  As far as the restaurant goes, meh.  I'd rather pay half as much at Red Robbin for a jucier burger and a quieter atmosphere.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,6,2,3,J3-d7rmtOdFEDnJVh9DmCw

I ordered the fondue, sashimi tacos, and truffle fries.

Our waiter was kind of out of it, i think it was just him cus after he went on break the service was a got a lot better.

The fondue dip was amazing, i'd be taking whatever my friends had and dipping it in that shit. The breadsticks didn't really taste like anything and the pepperoni wasn't too over powering which i thought was kind of nice.

I thought the sashimi tacos were hella good, that wasabi sour cream sauce whatever it was hella did it for me, now if only they were bigger.

Truffle fries, the menu says there's no such thing as too much truffle, but nawww there is. That truffle aioli was definitely doing too much and they came out kind of cold, but then again that could've just been our waiter cus it was the last thing to arrive at our table.

Well the food did not disappoint. The Mac and cheese burger was just delicious. Juicy marriage of flavors. Absolutely something you come up with after some alcohol.  I don't know where this combination came out of but is in one word perfect. 

We shared our burgers so we were able to order the pastrami burger. If the Mac and cheese was perfect then the pastrami one was absolutely perfect. I'm from NY so I love me some pastrami. All of the stuff on it combined with a pretzel bun. Again the taste buds go crazy. Like what's happening here.  Now add to all this the quad fries and it makes it one of the best dinning experiences I've encountered. 

The reason I'm giving it 4 not a 5 is the service. It had a lot to be desired. Took forever to get drinks and even longer to get our bill and our credit card back. She was gone for a good 15 minutes with my card. This is unsettling really.

Service was ok, took them couple minutes to greet us and cleaned dishes in front of us and there were 4 bartenders around. Anyway, we only drank couple  shots of fire ball and couple vodka soda so couldn't really say the quality of their mix drinks but from the menu we saw there was quiet a lot of mix drinks. 

Moving on the the food: we ordered a Mac and cheese burger, it was delicious! Burger patty was juicy, Mac and cheese in it was really moist and seasoned well, buns was also very moist and not dry but not overly buttered either. So after all we are pleased on how the food was cooked. 

Happy hours was awesome. If you didn't know drinking on the strip can be very expensive. So with happy hours it was a steal! Our check came out at $70 I believe; with couple shots and couple vodka soda and food and it being on kn the strip that's pretty cheap! Overall good experience!

Came back today!! Next day!! And got some poke tacos and lollipops lobster.. and that tacos is THE BOMB!!!!! Got Better service too!!

Also came with a side of fries (I really recommend they write this on the menu because we didn't think we were getting any and were thinking of ordering a separate side). The seasoning on the fries was so good. It had a spicy kick with a hint of sweetness. The cocktails are also great. They are so different that the waiter had to explain them all to me to get a sense of what I was ordering. 

Our second trip, we had Nick L for lunch. He is the best server, so ask for him! He gave us great recommendations and was spot on. This time we tried the shrimp tacos and BBQ wings. Again, great. Prices are also unbeatable, especially on the strip. I highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, burgers or wings.",AaHfldSosYA_kghB-M2F8A,0,0,5,Y2qOBUm7w9TRzZtFjSXfwg

The fries were super soggy and it wasnt even frensh fries they were nasty waffles fries. They should remove those off their menu for sure or find a new way to prepare them. Also had the burger with the onion ring on it ( i forgrt the exact name) it was ok but I have for dure had better. Once again wasnt impressed. The service was good, no complaints there which is the only reason I gave it two stars otherwise I would have easily given only 1 star. They ended up taking off the chili fries from my bill because I took 3 bites and couldnt eat it so they took it off for me. That was nice of them considering I would rather not pay for something that was gross and I couldnt eat them. Considering this restaurant is in the main area for Carnival court and between the Linq and Harrahs I am very surprised it wasnt better. You would think they would only allow the best to be in that kind of location. Its a New place so who knows maybe it just wont last. I for sure wont be going back and also wont recommend it to anyone.

On the bright side, the award winning Bacon Mac n Cheese burger and quad fries were among the selected moonlight survivors. Las Vegas has become a Mecca for gourmet burgers and Guy's spot is a strong contributor. The only thing preventing me from giving this place the 5 stars it deserves is the cost. Gordon Ramsay's ""Burgr"" has to be considered a strong rival and my comparable burger there was $6 less, leaving enough left over to add their incredible Oreo creme brûlée milk shake. That being said, you're in Vegas and I'd recommend hitting both Guy and Gordon's spot for a heated burger showdown. If you can only choose one, I would personally give Gordon the slight edge but it could go either way. Gordon's patties are smaller but thicker and Guy's are bigger but thiner. Depending on how you like your burger prepared this could drastically affect your experience. I mean, I personally wouldn't want a one inch thick ""well done"" burger or a quarter inch thick burger done ""medium rare.""

4182039,2014-07-24,1,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Disclaimer: I'm a Guy Fieri fan so my review will be a little biased. If u love triple D you're going to love this place!

From the first moment you walk in it screams Guy Fieri style. It's very rugged and a cowboy feel. The staff wears jeans and cowhide vest or aprons. Very cute!  Lots of little details. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the decor. I definetly appreciated it. For Guy fans, his UNLV coat is hanging by the kitchen entrance. I love the open kitchen concept! No fishy business behind doors! 

We ordered the rojo onion rings. It comes on this nifty metal pipe. The oil dripping from it was mildly disturbing but you're not coming here to stay on your diet! They use nice thick cuts of onions you can really taste and the breading was pretty crunchy. The only downside is that the breading looks better than it tasted. It was very bland. We couldn't appreciate the sweet or spicy aspect..the breading was just crunchy. 

The truffle fries were AMAZING though! The gouda on top and the dipping sauce were soooo good. We inhaled that thing! Definitely a must!! 

We also ordered the mac and cheese bacon burger.  It comes with a side of seasoned fries cut into 3 different shapes. They were pretty darn good! We fought over the waffle shaped ones. The burger itself was a thin flavorless patty and the mac and cheese wasn't very cheesy. Very unfortunate. 

Do try to save room for dessert! The S'more monte cristo is so amazingly good! When it comes out the marshmallow is melted and oozing out saying ""Eat me! Eat me!"" Very nice presentation..in fact everyone around us was asking about it and someone came over to take a picture. Now, this dish tasted as good as it looks! The brioche was nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Kind of like a funnel cake. I couldn't really taste the graham cracker but I didn't care because the chocolate and melted marshmallow was so good! It comes with a delicious raspberry sauce on the side and a dark chocolate sauce. I mostly used the dark chocolate sauce. As a chocoholic...u can NEVER have too much chocolate! 

So I gave this a 4 star because the decor is nice, great service, short wait time for your food. That earned it 3 stars. For the 4th star...it really depends on what you get here. The burger and onion rings were bland but the truffle fries and the monte cristo was very very good. (Flavor town good!) So I gave it another star for those two items. I think its worth coming back to explore the rest of the menu but I would come back for those two things and be happy also!",1C7z-7BMwadi3J31H6_oKA,6,2,4,vEQzaIKrAx1vAp0Sjzm6dg

If you watch Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, you will totally get the ""Guy Vibe"" from this establishment. 

The menu consisted of a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and barbecue items and I found it to be somewhat limited. In fact, there was only one sandwich that stood out to me and I still had to alter it to my liking. However, that one sandwich was so good that I totally wouldn't mind ordering it again, and again, and again. It was the Turkey Picnic Sandwich - thick carved turkey breast, swiss cheese, cranberry relish, and mayo on a garlic buttered pretzel hoagie... I omitted the citrus slaw and bbq kettle chips from the sandwich. My husband ordered the Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger - applewood smoked bacon, six-cheese macaroni, and even more ooey gooey melted cheese on a garlic buttered brioche bun. Both the burger and sandwich were so big we could only finish half of each. They were served with a variety of seasoned fries including waffle, curly, shoe string, and crinkle cut. Those fries were pretty darn awesome too!

Though there was only the one menu item that sounded good to me, I'd definitely return for it and maybe leave some room for the yummy dessert offerings as well. I would love to come back when the weather is warmer to take advantage of the outdoor patio and enjoy my ""picnic"" of a sandwich.",Y_t5q-UsgTwUEnzAQ73u1g,5,4,4,e7PzxoymcqPovKYjPox6uA

Eh. 

The intent was to have a belated birthday bloody mary with a friend here for a convention at the hard rock. I should have just gone with my gut & met them at the round bar. 

The bloody mary came loaded with vegetables like the standard celery, olives & a jalepeno for a little kick, pearl onions & oddly a pickle. I asked if they had cucumbers - they did not. I guess I was supposed to imagine a pickle as a cuke.  *more on the bloody below* 

Anyway we were sipping our drinks trying to decide on what to eat .. now I have to say in their defense it was a Friday night AND it was close to midnight but we waited. 

and waited. 

and waited. 

I got 1/2 way though my bloody mary - it was 'thick"" as bloody mary mixes go and I was full. NOW I'm a fat girl - so you know I have the capacity to suck down 2/3/4 bloody marys and go on. I had lunch leftovers at 5 so by now I should be ready to eat an arm. 
I think the mix was so thick it filled up that giant cavity that is my belly.

I am a Las Vegas local who was entertaining some of my friends visiting from the east coast. We saw a show at the Linq and were absolutely famished afterwards. An employee suggested we go to Fieri's restaurant and highly recommended it so we figured it was a sure shot. 

Upon arriving my friend asked about gluten free options and those were explained to her at the host stand so we proceeded to get a table and order food with our waitress who was a pleasant young blonde girl. 

I decided to get the Mac n cheese burger and was very specific about having an extreme tomato allergy and requested no tomatoes and no bacon--as I do not eat pork. 

As our food came out everything looked delicious but as I pulled the burger apart a giant piece of tomato fell out of it. There were both tomatoes and bacon in the burger. We called the waitress over and she apologized profusely and told us she would take it back. She said the kitchen made the mistake and were probably rushing because the kitchen was closing soon. 

Here's where the situation got progressively worse. She came back shortly after going to the kitchen to tell us the kitchen was closed and they couldn't make anything for me to eat!! So I'm basically stuck sitting here watching as my friends attempt to eat their food but they are so uncomfortable about it that they couldn't even eat anymore. Nobody even approached our table after this whole debacle. We then asked for a manager. 

The manager (""Andrea"" I believe was her name. I had to ask a bartender afterwards because she didn't even have the common decency to introduce herself) came to our table and basically got extremely confrontational with us. She told us that we didn't inform the waitress or kitchen of my tomato allergy when our waitress already apologized for the kitchen being erroneous in the situation and making the order wrong. She went on about the gluten free options they explained to us which had nothing to do with my allergy. She didn't offer any apology for what could have been an even more escalated situation had I not seen the tomato fall out and ingested it! She kept attempting to blame us and got extremely rude and just extremely unprofessional and nasty. I was absolutely shocked that any manager anywhere would treat customers in such a disrespectful way. She then stormed off and we didn't see her or our waitress again. 

One of the bartenders overheard everything that was going on and was super sweet by offering us a beverage but at that point we just wanted to get out of there!! My friends even left their meals uneaten at the table.

It was hot (what an understatement) and so we didn't want to walk any further so we decided to try this place out. Best decision of the trip! We shared an Original Smash Burger which came with their Quad Fries. Pretty damn good. We were both happy with our midnight snack and happily walked back to our hotel in the blistering heat--content, to say the least. Oh!

The boyf and I got the Smashburger again (only this time, the waiter asked us how we wanted it cooked). ""Medium well please!"" My parents shared the Smashburger as well (well done). And my brother got a '67 Cajun Sandwich. We finished every bit of our entrees with the exception of the Quad Fries because we were too busy nomming on the Triple T Fries we ordered on the side. 

Wait. I need to tell you all how these fries make me feel. ""Triple T Fries,"" I say to myself as I roll my eyes in pure foodgasm bliss followed by a mouthwatering longing to taste these beautiful things once again.

Okay. My party was fighting to get the most amount of these fries into our bellies. They were so good! Order them! Don't be like my boyf and I the first time and say, ""Ooh, these sound good. We'll try them next time so we have a reason to come back!"" NO, ORDER THEM THEN AND THERE.

We then ended the wonderful dining experience with a S'mores Monte Cristo for dessert. Boy, believe me when I tell you to never say, ""We'll try it next time!"" when it comes to food. ""Carpe diem"" should be rule number one in any foodie's rule book. Actually, if my high school Latin has actually stuck anything in my brain, it should be ""Carpe cena!"" SEIZE THE MEAL. 

Anyway, dessert was a great way to end the meal even though we were full. The chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces were the best part.

Yes to this place. Yes to the food. Yes to Guy Fieri. Come through! Totally worth every penny :)",pYfYnYBWz8_3PLnS2Qsk0g,3,1,5,vQ3ELYwkM5r3_z6abIp7Zg

Bill was $65 before tip. We ordered an appetizer, tall beer and two dinners. Food was delicious. Fries were awesome!

Was very busy though, however some tables were empty and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. We did call ahead to try to get a reservation, but was told they don't take reservations unless party was 13 or more.

We opted to take a seat outside. Was a cold night, but with the outdoor heaters, it was very comfortable, plus the music from the bar next door and outdoors TV's, plus people watching, it is probably the best seat in the house.

Hostess staff could probably try to smile and acknowledge people right away, but everyone else we encountered staff wise was great. Our server was nice, prompt and very personable. He 'bonded' with my husband because they grew up around the same area in Pennsylvania after chatting for a minute about football (there was a payoff football game on the outdoor TV's).

For the portions I thought the prices were high, especially with better places serving better food at a more affordable price. I guess I paid for Guy's name. My wife got the burger, which she requested without the weird mayo, I believe it was called donkey sauce. Naturally the burger came covered in it. It was served on a wood board that was warped, so every time she touched the board it rolled back and fourth. The burger was just a mess of sauce, that she didn't want, and fell apart, along with being raw in the middle. 

I got the nachos, which weren't to bad, but came served in some weird pot that had no bottom. The server pulled it off and it took a bunch of cheese and sauce with it.

Overall, the experience was great. The server was friendly and very nice. She took our order and had a friendly conversation with us about food and Guy Fieri. 

We ordered the ""Triple T"" fries and the general's wings. It did take about 25 minutes to get our food-disappointing.

The wings were good. A sweet, tangy, and spicy sauce with 3 dipping choices of toppings. Lollipop style wing was easy to eat.

The ""Triple T"" fries were good but not the greatest truffle fries I have tried. In my opinion and the girlfriend's opinion they were a little too greasy.

The Mac and cheese burger was really good and I've had a Mac and cheese burger somewhere else and I didn't like it so I almost didn't get this but I saw it on DDD so I decided to give it a try since it is their number 2 seller. The motley que being the number 1. I also liked the fireball whisky wings. It was really a great sauce for wings. It was spicy but not too spicy. I recommend the Vegas fries for an appetizer.

I ordered the ringer burger, which was tasty but overcooked.  I asked for med-rare, and it was more like med-well done.  That's all fine, and I probably wouldn't write a review if that was all, but the thing that I think really needs to be corrected is the fries.  The ""regular"" fries are so over seasoned they were inedible.  They tasted like bar-be-cue potato chips.  If that's your thing, great, but they should be advertised that way, because that was not what I was expecting.

We started off with Guy-talian Fondue Dippers which were pepperoni-wrapped breadstick with a provolone and sausage cheese dip. Im not a big pretzel person but these were great. The cheese dip is what makes the dish. We also got the Fireball whiskey wings which were great. they came with some kind of blue cheese dip which paired great with it.

For our mains we got the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger which won burger of the year in vegas last year. This burger is built with crispy applewood bacon, six cheese mac, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  Great burger with great flavor. They even cut this burger in fourths for us. The burger comes with 4 different types of fries and all were amazing and went great with the leftover cheese sauce from the pretzels. 

We also got the 14 hour slow smoked brisket. Wow, some serious flavor here. Looks like a plate of BBQ brisket that you would get in Texas. I just thought that were was a little too much bbq sauce drizzled over the meat. I would've liked to try more of the flavor from the brisket. 

Lastly, we ended with Triple Doublemint Pie. Holly cow, this was huge. It was a mint chocolate chip ice cream pie with oreo cookie crust and hot fudge. We had 4 people and couldn't even get close to finishing this dessert.

Upon arrival I realized that this is the same spot I had a work lunch a couple of years ago. At that time I would have rated it at a three, but the food was much better than I remembered on my recent visit. 

Noon on a Saturday is a busy time to visit. The wait for a table was about 20-30 minutes and we had plans so we opted to sit at the bar instead. The bar was serving the full menu and the chairs weren't too crowded together so it was comfortable. I also liked that the bar chairs had backs on them for added comfort. 

We started with Guy-Talian Fondue Dippers. The breadsticks were nice and flavorful. The fondue was creamy and I liked that the added flavors from the sausage, tomato, and basil. It was a unique appetizer and we enjoyed it. The bread and cheese combination made for a hearty appetizer.

After the hearty appetizer we decided to split the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger. It was a really good burger and didn't seem as oversized as the other burgers. All of the flavors worked together well and I enjoyed the pretzel bun twist. The fries on the side were also really good and I enjoyed the seasoning on them. It was fun that the fries were a mix of shoestring and waffle.

The bartenders were good about constantly refilling our waters and taking our orders quickly. The appetizer came out quickly, but the entrée took a little more time. Overall, service was good though.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,6,4,R-CED_u9VJ5_pFkaifhj_g

If you're a fan of his show DDD, that's another story. 

We started off with the Asian lettuce wraps which were amazing. From the minced chicken and chicken skewers, to the choices of three dripping sauces. So good! 

Then the entrees came in. I had the brisket and my girlfriend had the first burger option on the menu - I can't remember the name they have for it 

The brisket - for 30something dollars was a bit of a let down. Covered in a bath of sweet and tangy BBQ sauce and on top of two giant Texas toasts, you're not really giving the chance to taste the flavors of the actual brisket. It comes with an assortment of fries 

The burger - a perfectly seasoned burger with crispy onion ring and a toasty bun. It was good.

It was a little underwhelming. Where the burger presentation is spectacular the taste wasn't entirely there. There seems to be a lot in the burger that the flavors get lost. The scrambled egg made the burger feel foamy and bland. The deep fried bacon, although it added texture, did not really push the bacon flavor. My friend got the pork sandwich which was also underwhelming. I expected a lot more from this place but it felt like an explosion of ingredients and over the top plating, versus the focus of developing flavors and delivering you an insane meal. I will say, the Bloody Mary is pretty damn good. However, it feels like they are not consistent in the toppings that are added.

The area next to the hostess table had a lot of Guy's merchandise, from books to shirts, so there is something for everyone from hardcore Guy fans to those who just want a souvenir. There is seating inside, outside, and at the bar. The seating outside is okay, since you can people watch. But even with the misters, it was too hot and the view is just of the entrance of the LINQ and Harrahs. While waiting, they have some Guy memorabilia, like his UNLV chef coat, to view and the kitchen is open so you can see the burgers coming out.

We ended up sitting near the windows. I loved that the windows added natural light and allowed you to see the strip. I liked the decor from the napkins to the menu clipboards and tables, it was very Guy-esque. 

The food was very delicious and surprisingly filling. Each burger comes with a mixture of waffle fries, shoestring fries, and crinkle cut fries with seasoning. I got the Tatted-Up Turkey Burger and I LOOOVED it!! It's the best turkey burger I've ever had. It was so tasty and everything in and on the burger complimented one another. I tried some of my brother's Off-Da-Hook Original Smash burger and it was also super delicious.

Service was great. We were greeted right away upon arriving. Our waiter was nice and attentive. Bonus, our food came out right away after ordering. FYI, there is no restroom in the restaurant, but outside in the LINQ to the right when you exit. 

Overall, I recommend coming here because as Guy would say, ""It's off the chain!""",Z5n5eq5-7Z804HJqYM4dhQ,0,0,5,3BrpXYrR7VFMrhkOkZxQjw

We love watching Guy on food network and thought how cool he has a restaurant here and we should check it out sometime. There always seem to have a long line and wait so we decided to come back and try again. The second night we were there the wait was about 30-45 minutes. We didn't wait too long and were seated right away. We were sat up against the walls were all 2-seater tables were, squished next to bigger tables that seat 4. We asked if we could sit at the empty table to our left to have more room and was told no that it's for parties of 4. Well right after that they sat a couple like us at that so called table for 4 only. *eye roll* It took our server awhile to show up and when she did she expected us to basically order our drinks, appetizer, food, and probably ask for our bill too all at once. What is the rush? It wasn't even that busy at 9pm Sunday night.

We placed our ordered and it took awhile to come out. We finished our drinks and then our food showed up at the same time our neighboring table did(who were seated way after we did). All they could say was ""sorry it took long"". Okay so trash can nachos seemed cooled, they dumped it out of a bucket. The ribs had about 3 big slabs and definitely shareable. Nachos tasted okay, meat was cooked nicely but it lacked flavor. Ribs were horrible!!!! Overpriced and not good at all. It looked like they just poured bottles of BBQ sauce over it and served to us cold. We mentioned it and again just a ""sorry"". Well we ended dinner quickly and ended up sick and having to go to the bathroom after that experience. We had to find something else to eat later on that night because we were still hungry. It was a waste of time and money. It didn't live up to Guy's standards but then again everyone whose ""out there and known for"" usually has a restaurant and is packed because they're known and not all will be great.

I was so excited to try Guy Fieri's restaurant, but wow was I disappointed. I love his shows on the Food Network and I have been for the longest time, but unfortunately this meal did not do it for me. I tried the sashimi tacos, takeout salad, buffalo fries, but the only thing that passed good/mediocre was the salad. Coming from such a popular chef I guess I came in with very high expectations. Sorry Guy*

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Takeout salad - Creative setting, okay good (3.5)
2. Sashimi Tacos - Too gamey fishy taste, garlic was too overpowering, mango did not complement the tuna. (0/5)
3. Buffalo Fries - mediocre, good vegetarian option. (3/5)",mypaocxQRb7_Md3kONMtBg,4,1,1,lzk26QxDzFZErx5a6iv2TA

We were greeted and seated immediately.  Within just a couple of minutes the waitress came up and introduced herself and asked if we had a chance to look over the drink menu.  We did and ordered.  I got the Tiki Punch and he got a beer.  They came up just a couple of moments later.  We took a few more minutes to look over food menu.  There is all kinds of things to choose from and they all have funky, silly names, makes it fun for us.  Good times.   We decided on the Mayor Of Flavor Town burger and the Nachos (forgot their funky name).  Drinks were cold and tasty. We needed them after walking out in the heat!  Food came up rather quickly.  I was a little worried when he said I have your nachos and they were in a container that looked like a flour sifter.  Scared...I was scared.  haha   Then the expeditor sets my nacho plate down and pulls up on the flour sifter...whoa, nachos everywhere.  Delicious. Pulled pork nachos.  They were very tasty.  Warning, they are a bit sweet, so if you do not like sweet bbq, you would not like these, but I do, so scrumptious. 
My other half must have loved the three flavor fries that came with his burger because I only saw them as the plate was setting down.  Once my nachos were settled, his fries were gone.  No, no worries babe, I didn't want to try one anyway. hahah  
So we got another beer and dug in.  The nachos were crazy delicious and his Mayor of Flavor Town was not only grand but tasty as well. 
You will not go hungry here.  The plates were huge, service was excellent.  Restaurant and bar were both very clean.  Love it.  I would absolutely go back again.

We decided on the wise chocolate cake which looked great but was way too much alcohol taste and we did not like. waitress at first made no attempt to fix and look like she felt bad and took plate away.  We were shocked I thought ok this not going to be good, but then out of nowhere came the general manager Jason McIntosh and he was a Rock Star and came over and said sorry you did not enjoy the desert, let's fix that right now.  He suggested the fried ice cream and we excited to try it. Jason came back with sad look on his face as they were all out.  :(  Yea we were sad, but the smores dessert we ordered was amazing and more than we could eat.

So overall what could have been a very bad experience turned out to be a great night because of an alert waitress and excellent general manager Jason who understands customer service.

The only saving grace is that every person who worked there was nothing short of the perfect employee.  Everyone was so polite, friendly and professional that I couldn't bear to say anything, so I ate in silence.
 
The menu is pretty frenetic!  An offering will  catch your eye, like pulled pork, and they throw so much other crap on it, that it is not really a pulled pork sandwich.  The exact same thing goes for the burger offerings.  When you get right down to it, there isn't that much offered on the menu.

There were so many things offered with the burger that I asked for everything on the side, because there was no description of ""donkey sauce"".  What arrived was something that resembled a tiny hockey puck, with a charred crisp and absolutely zero juiciness left to the meat.   I was able to eat about a quarter of it before deciding that I would rather be hungry that continue.  They couldn't even get the fries right.  There was a mish mosh of different types-shoestring, steak and waffle, all cold from having sat out way too long.

I had such high hopes seeing this name on the brand,  so I'm not sure where this derailed off the planet, but it did.  Does he not care about this venture or did he just sell his name?

With all the other offerings like LVB or Strip Burger serving up amazing dishes, you should go there and talk about his amazing TV show.",dKFGhPr8EcGfJSS0ceDxFw,3,1,1,MBdHZbHBwqBUO5SuQpWpUQ

I am gluten free so I asked the waitress to help me navigate their menu for my eating choices.  The waitress was knew exactly what I could and could not have.  I settled in the Vegan burger.  She assured me there were no breadcrumbs in it.  However, after a few moments the chef presented himself to our table to discuss my selection with me and to inform me that there were indeed breadcrumbs in the burger.  Now, some people may be upset that the waitress was incorrect; however, I am not.  I am amazed that the chef actually came out to talk to me instead of just serving me a burger that would have made me sick.  Top notch service!!  The waitress was extremely apologetic and the kitchen put a rush on my new order.  Seriously impressed!  

I had a regular hamburger on a gluten free bun with crinkle cut fries that they fry in a separate fryer so they remain gluten free.  Tasty!!  Some gluten free buns can be so dry and dense but this one was not.  The burger was done perfectly and the fries came out piping hot.  

Would I return?  Yep, and in fact I did - the very next day for breakfast.  I will say their actual breakfast options are not stellar when it comes to gluten free but the waiter again was able to answer my questions and in the end I went with the burger and fries again.

-Guy-talian Fondue Dippers - These were a little disappointing considering all the reviews on them, mainly because the pretzels tasted a little stale.  I thought it might have been from the baking?  But I'm not sure.  They were wrapped with thinly sliced pepperoni along with a pot of melted cheese.  I wouldn't get this again, though it wasn't bad.
-Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger - Good burger!  The mac 'n cheese didn't make the burger to heavy, as I was worried about.  It actually tasted really good with the burger.  It was also not a huge as it looks in some people's pictures.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big burger and is a half pound but in some pictures, it looks just gigantic.  Came with three different types of fries - I liked the tiny shoestring ones the best.

Drinks were good.  My friend got the Kentucky Rock'r and liked it so much, she chose it for her second drink.   Guido's Freaky Tiki, which was both sweet and sour.  I thought it was okay - I enjoyed my second drink, the Java Guava, better.

The restaurant has a cool vibe to it. Kind of has a man cave type of feel to it. It's got a foosball table in the front and of course there is some Food Network playing while you eat.

I was fortunate enough to get a table without a wait, sat down to review the menu, even though I knew exactly what I wanted and waited. 

My server was nice but not exactly in a hurry. I could have brewed my own iced tea in the time it took her to bring me a glass.

The busboy who was there filling water glasses were exceptional. If not for him, most of us would be dehydrated.

Two things:

1. The bathroom isn't in the restaurant, it's in the casino.
2. Get a players card because you eat here. It'll save you a dollar per item.

The burger. Guys, this burger was amazing. Totally worth the wait. Mac and cheese and bacon-y goodness. The burger was cooked so well. Nice and juicy, but not too bloody. They get a little skimpy on the fries, but you're really so focused on the burger that it kind of doesn't matter.

These chips were absolutely loaded with toppings - plenty of cheese and brisket. The BBQ sauce had a ton of flavor. Definitely on the sweet side, but with a strong tang and a little bit of heat on the back, too. 

Service was friendly and fast. We loved eating on patio and enjoyed the casual atmosphere.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,7,4,5,QELnIq6zVCBP0ZaOtqTGJA

While waiting, I scoped the restaurant and noticed more than a handful of empty tables in the main dining area and the patio with plenty of available seating along the railing in the patio.  I went back to the hostess after some time and asked why the long wait when so many tables are open.  Her response, ""empty tables need to be cleaned"".  I looked back and didn't see them being cleaned.  There were two hostess working the entrance and would have loved to see that if tables needed to be cleaned and if other staff members weren't doing it or weren't available....then it would have been nice to see one of the hostesses take the initiative to take care of it themselves simply to get all these people in who were waiting.  I didn't understand why we waited so long when there were so many tables open!

We were seated in the patio and couldn't help notice all the noise.  I understand it's Vegas, but it was a bit much.  There was music coming from the entrance of the Linq, then there was the tv's in the patio with basketball games, then there was the live music from across the way from whatever restaurant/bar was there.  It was noise overload.

Other than ALL that, the food was good.  My husband and I both had the Original Ringer Burger and liked it.  Loved the presentation.  Menu items are pricey, but gotta expect that from anywhere on the strip, which is too bad!  Now I can say ""been there, done that...NEXT!"".",EcD54PXHwp4y8yif4QFZJg,0,0,3,HEPgwUBUnA4g86aKZsthyg

The waiter was helpful in describing the wings...oh how I love wings! I don't remember which ones I got but I do remember ordering the hot ones (which weren't hot enough) but were tasty.

My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  He convinced me to take a bite and it was rather tasty.  I'm not a fan of pulled pork because I don't like bbq sauce.  The sauce was mild though; you can tell it was homemade.  Probably the best tasting one I've had so far...and I've only had very few.  Not convinced that I'll ever like pulled pork.

The portions could be better; I wasn't too hungry but if I was I think I would've ordered an appetizer and a main entree.  The food presentations were cool though.

It was like In-n-out thin, but really crispy.( btw not a good thing, I hate in-n-out). Tomatoes were soggy, bun was good, bacon was nothing to remember, and the mac tasted like effortless  kraft mac and cheese.

4583042,2014-06-02,1,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I wanted to update my review because the manager messaged me on Yelp inviting me back to the restaurant. I appreciate the fact that they are concerned with their customers feedback. Hopefully they will use the customer feedback and implement the necessary changes that should be made. They could start with either lowering their menu prices or purchasing higher quality product. I don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, but that is not what is offered here. I am not looking for a free meal. I just give honest feedback to inform other consumers. So, I want to be clear about why I gave them two stars on my review.

I would give them five stars if the review was just based on their staff. The service was excellent. The staff is very friendly and attentive to the customers, as demonstrated by the manager showing concern about my review. The kitchen staff did a fine job on the preparation and the presentation of the food. I was disappointed with the quality of the product used in the perpetration. The prime rib in the sandwich and the meat in the burgers were not up to par. The chicken wings were average at best and extremely over priced for what you are served. Personally, I don't care for some of the flavor combinations on the menu.

I want to be very clear about the fact that the kitchen staff cooked the food properly and presented it as they were supposed to. It was the quality of the product I gave two stats to, not the service or the preparation.

I think my expectations of the food before I arrived led me to be so disappointed with the food. It is just average food though. It was not a bad meal and none of the food tasted bad. If the prices were not so high, I may have given them three stats. It is just not worth the money. The burgers are definitely not up to par with the likes of LBS, Bacchi Burger, and Gordon Ramsay Burger. I would even say Smash Burger and Fat Burger serves better tasting burgers.

To be fair, I will conclude by suggesting that you give them a try and make your own decision on the quality and taste of the menu items.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,11,1,2,Or3UxJdn-uSUgs6Ve-KR_Q

The Vegas Fries (which is a big order) were good, but after a few, we stopped using the sauces and knocked the cheese off because it was a bit much and I love Buffalo Sauce and Blue Cheese.  My wife and I also split the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger.  It was a VERY average, almost below average, burger.  Nothing special at all.  The pattie kept falling apart and the mac-n-cheese looked and tasted like something you get from a cheap cafeteria.  What happened to Flavortown on this one???  Very underwhelming food experience from a Chef that I really enjoy watching and I make a lot of his recipes.

As for the service...  Horrible!  The food came out quickly, but only because our waitress didn't run the food.  Our waitress was off doing who knows what because it took her almost 10 minutes to get 2 drinks.  Again, they weren't busy at all!  After we received our drinks, we didn't see our waitress again until we were ready to pay and leave.

I gotta say, this place is Guy Fieri's reputation and it definitely took a negative hit with me.  I'll stick with making his recipes and taking pride in what I put out, but Guy needs to take a good look at this place and fix a lot of issues before it needs to close.

We were thinking about going to Baltimore to check out his other Kitchen & Bar, but after this experience, we'll skip Guy's Kitchen & Bar the next time we're in the Charm City.",wQPAG-0bW0dXSRHnsXcS6w,4,0,1,TuzTZnxN3t6exNlGqWtZIA

The restaurant opened not too long ago so the wait for a table is ridiculous during the weekend and unfortunately they do not allow reservations. The restaurant decor is great and I love the employees uniforms, they are super cute! We ordered the macaroni and cheese burger and the carne asada tacos! They were both great! The bread was soft, the meat very juicy and the overall flavor was exquisite. The only bad part was the taster flights.. For $35 you get 4oz tasting of 16 beers. The bad part is that the ""tasting"" included ordinary beers such as blue moon, PBR, miller light, sierra Nevada well you get the idea.  Who has not sampled those cheap beers before!

4637681,2016-01-22,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Our visit was thoroughly mediocre. It was just a stop in for a bite to eat very shortly after landing in the city. There was a pretty long wait ~40 mins so we retreated to the bar. On the way you notice half the tables are empty. Not a big deal, as I'm sure it's staff based, but that doesn't seem ideal. I sat dead center at the bar. There was this lingering smell you would get whiffs of strongly, with it just hanging in the back of your nose. A dumpster.... You know, like when you are behind a building, in an alley, and the trash truck let's that water and liquid leak out on the ground; the conglomeration of various things that fester in the bottom of the bin....that smell. Not a compliment to a meal.. Or in this case just a drink. Somehow the couple adjacent ate food. We got to go to the table after we confirmed the hostess never really put us on the list in the first place, and with most of the tables empty you could see how dirty the place is...plenty of crumbs and grime. The place does have that rustic rebel vibe going on, but it's just a little too authentic to have real grime. Our party of 5 ordered various items; a couple salads, one sandwich, and two apps. Nobody was very wowed but probably famished from the flight. I had the app with the lettuce wraps because lettuce wraps rock! These did NOT. Bland, weird, gross chicken.... Like it was boiled or something. In contrast the spring rolls and little chicken skewer on the plate were rather tasty. Odd dish. I think Guy should stop by this dive and have a taste. On a side note, one of these stars is for the sugared bacon in the Bloody Mary. Maybe just order a plate of that.",OWAAX8ZwYpgDwDtTvj3nLw,0,0,2,lxS_8KbHs-8zMK0v28ROgQ

Our group of 5 shared: sashimi ""won-tacos,"" triple T fries, the original ringer burger, and the bacon mac-n-cheese burger. We probably could have stuffed ourselves with another item. My favorites were the fries and the original burger. The fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor, especially the aioi. The original burger had the flavors I like most, although I think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.

To me, the burgers are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite I would want again and again (I still prefer Bachi burger or even Holsteins). The tacos were definitely a let down- super small portion of tuna and not very interesting.

4655931,2017-10-23,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Minus a few undesirable kinks, Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar was a superb dinner dining experience for my girlfriend and I while we were visiting Vegas. The restaurant itself is quite large, providing a variety of seating options - including a bar - and features hilarious photos on the walls and signature items from one of the industry's most recognizable chefs. The atmosphere was lively, with plenty of dining groups having a blast chowing and chatting away. Some may complain about the menu prices, but honestly, if you're not aware of the Vegas Strip standards on food and drink - common knowledge for anyone who's visited even once - don't bother going out! Appies are in the $17 range while mains average between $19 and $35.

Before I review the food and drinks - which were totally delicious - I should note the few bumps that made this review instantly drop from five to four stars. For one, the washrooms are outside of the premises, which I know is not uncommon in Las Vegas casinos where there are shared business washrooms similar to a mall, but these washrooms - 'bathrooms' for Yankee readers - were a 90 second walk out of the restaurant, making it a minor inconvenience. Even more of a downfall was our main server's lack of enthusiasm and friendliness when taking our orders, bringing our food and drinks, and taking forever to come over with the machine when we were paying up. He was very unprofessional and could surely use some some proper hospitality training or even advice from more knowledgeable staff.

All that being said, we absolutely loved the food and drinks we had here; we started with the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. At $14.50, these pepperoni-based breadsticks were filling and tasty, with a soft focaccia-like breading that had the pepperoni blended in. The kicker - creamy smoked Provolone and pork sausage dips that would have been equally amazing served with wings. After realizing we were beyond half full - the breadsticks come in a sizeable portion - we tackled the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger, Guy Fieri's award-winning burger, and voted one of the best burgers in Las Vegas. It comes with Quad Fries (really, really good stuff) and sits at $21.50. The beef was super fresh; the secret sauce was tangy, contrasting the beef, the veggies were fresh; the soft brioche bun had delightful garlic butter on it; crispy applewood-smoked bacon. The burger was also not overcooked, lending a nice softness that complimented the bun. Try the fries - I need not even explain how great they were! I have had the pleasure of trying many a burger in my day, but I must say this one definitely ranks in my top 10 best ever! MONEY! The girlfriend and I each enjoyed one of their Cucumelon cocktails - Effen cucumber vodka, fresh cucumber and watermelon juice, lemon squeeze, and tonic - and found them refreshing and boozy, but also steeply priced at $15! For $38, however, you have the option to get any cocktail in a punch bowl for the whole table to slurp up.

I so wish I could give Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar a 5/5 - I would do it for the food in a second - but perhaps this place could work a bit on training their staff to always work with a smile and be conscious of the diner's needs at all times. In the hospitality industry, you only really get one chance to get things right. We'll be back for the food regardless!",63NmoNMOek4R5DX7WA9ffA,0,0,4,Z5QMHgTPk4FH8O6d2pHraA

They have napkins that are cloth, which was not great for messy food, since every time you took a bite you had to wipe your mouth, additional napkins were needed, which we did not have.

Drinks: Good selection. The best bloody mary I had in Las Vegas (contributes to one of the 2 stars). Good spice, and flavor. Loved the raw peppers they add for garnish so you can jazz it up to your spice level. 

Service: Servers were slammed, not much of a connection made with the customers. They got you what you needed when you needed it. 

Food: I expected SO much more from this establishment. My fiance and friends liked their food enough (note none of them can fry an egg basically). However, I was extremely unsatisfied with the Motley Que sandwich. The sauce was in your face in a bad way. It was sickly sweet. I literally counted the 7 strands of ""coleslaw stacked"" on my sandwich. The pretzel bun gave no support to the pork and it was impossible to eat without half the meat falling out. I  ended up scrapping the pork off of the soaked pretzel bun and eating it with a fork (about 75% of my dish remained when it was removed from the table).The pickles served with all of our plates were piss warm and were absolutely disgusting. Pickles are supposed to give your mouth a cooling sensation to break up the richness of every sandwich on this menu. The french fries were crispy, well seasoned (contributes the other star given in this review).

We are huge Guy Fieri and DDD fans so we decided we had to have dinner here.  Great location in the Promenade close to the strip hotel entrance (opposite of the High Roller).  It was not terribly busy (half of the outdoor tables were empty at the time) but they seemed short staffed when we arrived.  You check in with the hostess and they take your cellphone number so they can text you when your table is ready (clever marketing tactic so now they have your real cellphone number).

.Crab Cake Sandwich Special / Club soda and lime - Delicious and ginormous crab cake serving larger than the roll itself.  I was able to eat 1/2 of the sandwich as is and just the other 1/2 of the crab cake (no roll).
.Side of raw carrots for our dog

I had recently saw he had a thing called the ""Trash Can Nachos.""  I found them on the menu and was really excited to try them!  It was a disappointment for me....more show than good.  I also tried the veggie burger which was just ok. The bun to patty ration was way off and the patty fell apart if you touched it. So, I ate it deconstructed style. It did't have much flavor or spice. The fries that came with the burger, I did like. 

I will say that I saw the Bloody Mary's that were served to a table next to us and they looked amazing! Actually, it could have been a complete meal with everything that's loaded on the celery stick! I wish I hadn't played so hard the night before, because I would have ordered that instead of coffee.

The servers were really good! Very nice and friendly, and noticed when your drinks were low! They get an A+. And we sat out in the patio area...it was a beautiful day, great weather and it's a fun location to people watch!

Later in the day, my stomach wasn't feeling so well and I think it was probably from the nachos.  Because I love Guy, I had to try it, but honestly, I wouldn't go there again.",ngZojAnY8V8OfrIqBVt5jQ,0,0,3,wWoMCn3F-oPfyzfBJpvVZA

We waited about 20 minutes or so and were seated, more than reasonable for a weekend evening. Menu has a nice, wide variety of options. The Ms. ordered The General's (Tso) Wings and I (putting my vegetarianism quest *way* aside) opted for the ""Off-Da-Hook Original Smashburger, replete with Guy's ""bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce"".

The burger was fine. Well-cooked and well-seasoned, but it's not going to make me crave beef any time soon. The BBQ sauce was a nice touch, though - had some real kick to it. I also liked how the accompanying fries were kind of a hodgepodge - had some waffle, crinkle, and shoestring all mixed in. Wife thought the wings were flavorful but a bit too salty to fully enjoy. 

The desserts looked pretty good, but we were so full off the entrees alone that there was no way we would/could stuff ourselves like that. 

Overall, four stars from me. Liked the ambience, wait staff was friendly, and not a long wait for the entrees. Would we go back? If we're hanging out around the Linq, quite possibly. Might have to snag a bottle of that BBQ sauce, at least.",GJDWR3qcl1o7W_bHAMiPSA,0,0,4,3UVq5hk0JxbM3PQOYHf1dw

To complete this review, the service was good and the staff friendly. I still think that the outside beverage rule in a Casino is just greed.

My husband ordered The Mac + Cheese Bacon Burger...they didn't ask how he wanted it cooked and so we assumed it would be medium, and it was more medium well. He switched the bun to the pretzel bun, but the bottom bun was so thin it disintegrated. Again, the burger was Bland, the meat, the mac n cheese all bland.

As we waited for our table, there was no chatting, or even asking how we are doing and I don't think she even made eye contact. Just chewed her gum and went about her business.

I'm happy to report that after the experience, I'm glad we did and would totally do it again!
 
The wife and I tend to go big for dinners in Vegas, so this was a great option for lunch.  We arrived around 1p and there was approximately a 30-min wait.  The beauty of being in a casino is that it is SUPER easy to kill a half hour (thank you, Craps table!)  Before we knew it, we got the text that our table was ready and we were seated very soon thereafter.
 
As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of mac & cheese, the wife, with ZERO hesitation, got the Bacon Mac & Cheeseburger ($20; crispy applewood bacon, six-cheese mac 'n' cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle, garlic-buttered brioche bun) and was very pleased.  The burger itself wasn't anything spectacular, but the combination of the bacon, mac & cheese, garlic butter was juicy, flavorful, and downright awesome.
 
I went with The Original Ringer Burger ($18; crispy rojo onion ring, bourbon brown sugar BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle + donkey sauce
on a garlic-buttered brioche bun) and it was outstanding.  The onion ring was huge and crispy, and the BBQ sauce was a sweet compliment to the saltiness of the breading.
 
The Quad Fries that come with the burger are awesome.  They are equal parts shoestring, waffle, wedge, and crinkle fries with some super-delicious BBQ-like seasoning salt.  Delicious, and makes each bite just slightly different!!!
 
My main detractor from 5 Stars is value.  Yeah, I get that we are in Vegas and you have to pay for the Guy Fieri name on the marquee, but $20 for a bacon cheeseburger is a little steep, even by Vegas standards.",-m8nSwgfmQzsctaZ2lVhrA,2,1,4,eNz8FsKVFTm9NzVV8fgIBw

Ahi Won- tacos - Did not like at all. Too much fusion going on here, and it didn't balance right. It almost felt dessert like because the sweet soy/wasabi or whatever sauce was too sweet. And they put so much on it that it coated everything, making it feel heavy and thick. With something deep fried and involving sashimi, I wanted something a little more refreshing, and citrus based.

7 layer jack daniel chocolate cake - This was an actual legit cake. Could easily feed 6-8 people! I thought it was going to be a 7 layer slice, not an entire cake. When I opened up the box, I was shocked. Had a rich chocolate flavor, and a VERY strong alcohol flavor that made my throat and eyes burn. Haha, didn't know it was possible to have that reaction from alcohol in food. 

The two bartenders were both so friendly. The girl was sweet, and when I mentioned a cold, asked if I wanted tea or anything. Not sure if it was free or not, but I was getting a to-go order, and might not have enough hands to carry any beverages with me. But the offer was unexpected and very nice.

-The bacon Mac & cheese burger was good too. I think it can totally lose the shredded lettuce. It's just way too much for that kind of savory burger. 
-The fries that come with the burgers and sandwiches were bomb. I love that they were mixed and matched with waffle & shoestring and whatnot. 
-Caesar salad was basic, fresh and delightful. I didn't care too much for the big crouton that was holding everything up. Too stale. 

Service: 
Elizabeth was nice, knew the menu but there were a couple of times when my guest request was brushed aside and it lagged too much. We asked for salt and pepper with our Caesar and we didn't get it till we were 3/4 of the way done with our Caesar... We're not fast eaters. 
Greeters were not upbeat and did not even seem like they wanted to be there. 

Overall the whole reason why I'm giving this a 3 star rating is because of the cleanliness. My glasses were super dirty. I talked to a manager and said what was wrong, he wasn't defensive but just said that there's something wrong with the water and chemicals.. Sure. I agree with you but a simple polishing of glasses so I don't think it's dirty would be SO MUCH better for my perception. Polishing doesn't take a long time especially since it's just the rim.
Also, the table and booth were dirty and wet upon seating. Seriously? Doesn't take much to clean it up.

While it may seem like an odd sounding meal - it was by far - one of our favorites out!

STAR 1 = Friendly AF staff! We were seated outside on the patio, and greeted promptly. Our server was kind and offered great suggestions to the massive food and drink menu! He made sure we were well taken care of and enjoyed our food.

STAR 2 = Food and booze is outrageously good! We opted to share a large margarita (funky cocktails is their jam) and an appetizer, as we weren't too starving! Their cocktails are offered in a regular 16oz size, or a fishbowl - which we gladly ordered! Our margarita was large in size and had little sour patch kids in them for a twist on a classic! 
The menu features Guy's favorites, like the Bacon Mac-n-Cheese Burger, loaded with everything under the sun! Being that the trashcan nachos are their famous staple, we noshed on them -corn tortilla chips, nacho cheese, jalapenos, crema, pico de gallo, house-smoked pulled pork drizzled in chipotle bbq sauce! It was to die for! NOM!

STAR 3 = Mid day and late night happy hour is offered - featuring bites, brews and cocktails, all for a discounted price!

STAR 4 = Located in the Linq Hotel, it's easy to find, navigate the strip and take part in the action! 

While pricing here is pretty steep, portions are massive and it's VEGAS BABY! I know we'll be back!",crg97ztpsfvf6VQ0y8Nx1A,27,25,4,tnsbCAJK_UN9iM0ZEaDdMw

When in Vegas, try Guy Fieri's restaurant. He is a Vegas native so what better way to experience bold flavours and unique dishes than his very own kitchen and bar in his hometown!

We arrived for a late dinner at approximately 9:00 p.m. and there was still a 45 minute wait so we opted for immediate seating at the bar where they still serve the full menu. The service was mediocre enough to mention in this review - what bar in Vegas doesn't try to attempt to top up your drink?! We had empty glasses sitting at the bar for far too long. There were 3 bartenders at the time of our meal and no one even came to check up on us.

Honourable mention goes to the award winning Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger. It was voted ""Best Burger in Vegas"" by several magazines and a must try if you come here. Taking my first bite felt just like I was on an episode of DDD, grease and bacon fat oozing from the burger onto my fingers and all! It is a healthy portion so if you aren't starving (or hungover), I would recommend sharing this dish along with an appetizer. 

Despite the overall rating, it was still worth the visit and experience.",L02tQFYyMZuR9aDePsc0pQ,1,0,3,rOVwRjsOZ22nILhp8olltA

Having watched Guy's show, I was excited to eat here. I even remember cheering for him on his initial appearance on a Food Network amateur cooking competition show. And then I read about his menu...I was looking so forward to the Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger thinking it sounded as good as it could get. 

I arrived with 8 friends and it took about an hour and a half for a table to open. The interesting thing is that while I sat at the bar waiting, there were more than several empty tables around. 

When we sat down, the waiter was friendly and delivered our menus then literally disappeared for 20mins. After our orders were placed, the appetizers arrived promptly. I had the fondue dipper....breadsticks, wrapped in pepperoni, with a bowl of chews to dip them in, truly a guy's heaven. The food was gobbled up and we sat waiting. So we ran down the waiter and ordered another round of drinks, and we waited. (There seems to be a theme here). The drinks came, we kept talking and drinking and waiting for our food. When it came, it looked incredible. It was presented very well. 

I launched into my burger with gusto expecting to be astounded...and I got only ""meh"". Such a shame! I so wanted that burger to be the end all. It was good, just not great. But it was HUGE! A couple could split this and still take some home. 

And then the bill came. I had a beer, a burger, a coke, and an appetizer...$56. The burger alone was $20. 

All in all it was decent. And I loved the super open kitchen they have so you can watch them at work. Maybe the public view keeps the cooks from adding the magic because the food, although good, was uninspiring. Then add in the price (given its on the Strip and has Strip prices), I don't think I'll return - There are plenty of other awesome good burgers in Vegas.",9eRRQL3JwekCLFPY25tO2A,1,0,3,2zM8GLJXXqWgb7oHEPcnTw

Can you imagine Guy dressed in a suit with sensible hair, trying to pass as a traveling businessman? It would not only be the best ""Undercover Boss"" ever, but Guy would be able to correct some glaring issues with this restaurant. 

I suspect Guy would be happy with the food. My family got the Mac and Cheese Burgers, turkey sandwich, and chicken wings, and all were excellent. 

But, the problems started before we sat down. It wasn't particularly busy when we went, but there were no outdoor seats, which was okay, so we asked for a booth. We were told it would be about 10 minutes to clear a table. Wait...what?? The table was cleared in about 2 minutes, and it sat there until we told the hostess,  who said she had to check to see if it was okay for us to sit down (??) After a few more minutes, we got to sit down. My wife and daughter added Caesar salads to their meal, and we were told we'd have to eat it with the meal (??). My wife asked if she could have it before, and the waitress said she'd have to check with the cooks to see if it was okay to serve before the meal (???). We did get to have them before the meal at least.

When the order arrived, my wife saw that my son and I had sides of fries with our burgers, and she wanted to add a side of fries with her meal. A colossal basket of fries showed up later,  and she said that she wanted a side like the kind we had. The waitress said that, oh, no, there's only one size. When we asked to take it back, she got a forced smile on her face, and stood there without saying anything. It was obvious she didn't want to take it off the bill because she was concerned about how a smaller bill would result in a smaller tip. We had to ask for a manager, who took it off the bill and eventually agreed to give us a free sandwich.

At what point in the baffling dinner service would Guy have ripped off the fake wig to reveal who he really is? As I mentioned, the food was great, but the service makes the $100+ we spent on 4 sandwiches feel like a rip-off. When I think of Guy Fieri, I think of an awesome dude I'd like to hang out with.

They are called ""trash can brisket nachos"", and they come in a metal cylinder, which the server removes at your table.  They probably get their name from the metal cylinder, but regardless, I think the name is quite fitting: they taste like trash. 

At $20, the nachos weren't cheap (and being from Canada, they are closer to $25 with the lousy exchange rate), but my partner and I could only take a couple of bites before giving up.  They tasted just AWFUL.  So bad. I tried to eat them because they were so expensive, but I had to admit defeat after four or five pieces. We paid our bill and left the plate practically untouched.

On one hand, the food was delicious. We had some some Sashimi Won-tons which werent too bad. Those Won-tons were a little different, good but also lacking in some areas. However, I did enjoy them.

Then my girlfriend and I shared the Mac and Cheese burger with their assorted fries. They were delicious. I wasnt starving but I finished that without any issues. 

My reason for the low review was simple... it was the service. We sat down and no one approached us. After ~10 minutes, some guy came over and said he will be back soon. Cue another 5 minutes and still nothing. Cue another 5 minutes and he finally returned. Since we waited almost 30 minutes since he first appeared, we just ordered everything at once since who knows when we will see him next. 

~30 minutes later, the Won-ton appears. I dont know why it took 30 minutes when the fish was raw. Come on now, Ive spend a lot of times the restaurant and it have no idea why it would take over 30 minutes for the first appetizer to appear. 

Then we waited for like another 20 minutes for the burger to arrive. The table next to us appeared while we were waiting for appetizers. And they food came right after ours.

I was at your restaurant on Friday with my boyfriend. We were waiting for my sister to arrive later that night for her 21st birthday and grabbing a snack. 

We sat down at the bar and had only been there a few minutes when one of your waitresses came out with some plates of food. A ramican of truffle oil fell off the plate, hit the ground, and perfectly hit me/my purse/my whole outfit. There was no coming back for my shirt. 

I have to tell you Jason McIntosh your general manager is a true gem. He cleaned my purse for me, sent me off with new shirts from your gift shop, and recommended the BEST drink and appetizers that of course he took care of for me. Btw- those nachos are seriously the best and I don't even like nachos. Not just that but he gave me two of your signed napkins which I gave to my sister for her birthday and she was ecstatic. We may or may not binge watch diners, drive ins and dives... and your grocery games. 

And guess what- the next night, We saw you at Caesar's and you took a picture with my sister without even knowing who we were. I'm so glad the whole staff is a class act. 

Your food is amazing and your staff knows true customer service and has character. For anyone who is looking for top notch service with top notch food- I highly recommend.

I loved that we could just give them our numbers and chill out in a casino until the table was ready. After we were seated, our waiter introduced himself and the night went from average to TOP NOTCH. His name was Chris Anderson and not only did he know his stuff, but he was incredibly attentive and did everything possible to make our first visit THE BEST. We ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and it blew our minds so much that Chris kept bringing out their truffle aioli later for our entrees. Between all os us, we took down the Mac & Cheese Burger (literally one of the best burgers I've ever had, everything down to the lettuce is flavored to a T), the Steak Asado tacos, the Double Barrel BBQ wings, and the Cheesecake for dessert.

Some of the details are immaculate: large square ice cubes that reflect the boldness of the atmosphere, custom napkins and silverware, a watermelon gazpacho shot advertised to cleanse your palette that delivers and refreshes.

With such care put in, why are the home fries from a frozen bag mix? Why does the waitstaff act inconvenienced at having to work the morning shift and need to be requested to serve your coffee before your order arrives?

Perhaps the hit and miss attitude is reflective of counting on the clientele to be hung over.

And, it is great hang over food. The chicken fried bacon biscuits and gravy was an event in my mouth. I've never had chicken fried bacon and it elevates the dish. I had the equivalent biscuits and gravy at Hash House A Go-Go earlier this week and Guy Fieri's knocks it out of the park. 

My partner's basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, and home fries was okay. The biscuit was delicious and the apple chicken sausage was delightful, but overall I would pass on this.

She said it would be 30-45 minutes 
What??? You could clearly see there were open tables and reservations were not allowed. 
I asked why the wait when there were so many tables free. 
She very rudely said, that's the way it is, you will just have to wait like the others. 
Are you kidding me??? 
I could understand if she would have said they were short staffed but there were three girls just standing around. 
Not the way to run a business when there are so many options in Vegas.

First of all the place looks real nice, the service is great, I love triple d show and that alone made me want to come over and try it out.

But the food is just not worth the high prices, and people saying the portions are huge are straight up lying.  We ordered the wiskey wings, 9 bitesize tiny wings for $15, the menu claims they are super hot, but they are not even close to being hot. The taste was not that good and the blue cheese and ranch sauses are disgusting. I had better wings at applebees, and better ranch sauce at jack in the box.

Next we tried the Cesar salad, again not that good either and i have no idea what that wall of hard bread on the salad was, looked like a monster crouton but it was not eatable..

So finally I asked for the best burger so I got the mac and cheese burger...  People claim burger is huge but its really just a decent size and its pricey $19.. The burger was just ok thats it. If thats the best they had i wonder how the others taste. I couldnt even taste the macaroni on the burger.. Honestly i had better burgers at chillis.. Now the fries on the other had were great, they mix 4 different kind of fries together and are tastey..

Ordered the bacon mac n cheese, proclaimed as the best burger in Vegas and some house wings. 

...This was one of the most bland burgers I've ever eaten. The meat was bland, the mac n cheese was bland, even the bacon was bland. How was this voted the best burger in Vegas? Low standards or people too drunk to actually know...? $21.50 for that. I was so disappointed. Drenched this burger in ranch so I could have some flavor. It came with a side of fries -wedges,waffles, and thick cuts. All tasted the same. All lukewarm. 

The wings were so, so overcooked. Chewy, hard, and disgusting. No wonder they drenched it with so much sauce to try and cover up the taste/texture. 

This was the most disappointing eatery throughout my weekend in Vegas. We were in Vegas for a tournament and a lot of the guys asked us for our opinion of this place. We recommended them other burger spots. Can't sabotage their palates.",EXVN2b3Nbz7VP7QVcJvZJA,4,1,1,H_4VBlqm8ZwrWCU4hg8GKQ

I was fully expecting at least a 30 minute wait for a table, based on the reviews but lucked out when we only had to wait 5 minutes to accommodate our group of 6 on a Wednesday evening.  We wanted to watch the hockey game on tv and were able to catch up with old friends, eat dinner all at the same time  -- win-win in my book! 

Speedy service, friendly wait staff, accommodating to large groups. 

We ordered the trash can nachos to start.  Neat concept to pile the ingredients into a can and remove it at the table by lifting the can up and letting the ingredients fall onto the plate.   Good but nachos were a tad too spicy for my liking.   

For dinner, I ordered the original ringer burger and came with fries.  The burger was flavorful but very, very messy.   I asked the waiter if I could sub fries for a side salad and was told that I could.  When I got my check, there was a $3 dollar up charge for subbing the salad.  It didn't break the bank, but would've been nice to know on the front end.

We got there around 5:30 PM.. Seated around 5:45 and weren't asked for a drink order until after 6 pm.  Yes, we waited over 15 minutes to place an order.  If it weren't for the drink runner guy noticing us we would have never even gotten a drink.

Once the waiter finally came to take our order we ordered our 2 iced teas and our burgers.  My husband got the tiple B and I ordered the original ringer.

We got our burgers approximately 25 minutes later and they as well as the fries were dry and boring.  The burgers were nothing special for almost $20 a piece.

At $50 total for the both of us to eat here, I wish I had taken my $50 elsewhere.  We are locals and don't spend much time eating on the strip but we were on our way to see Mystere at TI so we figured why not.

We were told the wait was going to be forty minutes for two. We headed to the bar to grab some drinks and see if we could score two seats at the bar. There were some tables available but they weren't cleared off quickly. We finally got two seats at the bar after 15 minutes. The service was kind of slow even though there were 2-3 bartenders. It took some time for our order to be taken. 

We started off with the Vegas Fries...fries heavily tossed in buffalo sauce topped with blue cheese crumbles served with more buffalo sauce and blue-sabi sauce on the side. The buffalo sauce was too overwhelming for my liking. I definitely wouldn't dip the fries in more buffalo sauce. My husband and I didn't eat much of the appetizer. 

I ordered the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger which tasted amazingly good! The burger patty was cooked and seasoned well. The bacon added a nice crispy texture, while the mac-n-cheese added creamy cheesy goodness. The brioche bun was the perfect choice of bun because of its buttery flavor. Every element of this burger tied in so well together! Quad fries, which consisted of four types of fries, were better than the vegas fries. The portion size was more than enough. I could not finish this burger on my own. Definitely would get this burger again! 

My husband ordered the Motley Que sandwich. I had a couple bites. We both agreed the burger was better. It had a great smokey flavor, but that's all you taste. I would've loved to see some other flavors incorporated into the sandwich. It definitely was cheesy, but again the smoky flavor of the pork muted the flavors of the other components in the sandwich. It was served on a pretzel bun, which was mediocre to me and lacked some of the salty element. I've had better. 

All in all, I give it 3.5 stars if I could. I would go back for that burger and may try the other burgers.",laedVGE7PQ6WoYLnrflKfg,2,1,3,W9QDYZn07OCwcHM1SUbncg

Seating: Table (Inside)
Party: 2 Adults

This was somewhat my first time to Guy Fieri's Kitchen. Let me explain. Went on a Carnival Cruise back in March and the cruise had a Guy's Burger Join, and it was AMAZING. So when I came to Vegas (with the same friend I went on the cruise with), my party and I thought we needed to, without a doubt, check this place out. SUCH A LET DOWN!

CUSTOMER SERVICE = 1 Stars
The wait to get a table was a little lengthy (20-30 minutes) but we considered that normal since it was the middle of the lunch rush on a Saturday. Now when we got seated, our waiter was really nice, but there were so many mix ups with our order. To say the least, the entire ordeal was a disaster, and our waiter was practically absent the entire time. Both my friend and I had to flag him down to get any help.

FOOD = 1 Stars
An absolute let down. First, between the time of us ordering and actually getting our food, it was about 45 minutes. I can understand a place being busy, but that's ridiculous. Next, the drinks. My friend had ordered a soda, and I got a cocktail from the bar. The soda came at a normal speed, however, my cocktail didn't arrive until after my food did. This was with having to ask my waiter twice about my drink. And sadly, the taste of the drink didn't make up for the service on getting it.

Moving on to the food. I had ordered one of Guy's famous Original Ringer Burger (a twist on a BBQ Burger). Now you can get either fries or a salad. I usually order my entree with fries, and then get the salad on the side (as an appetizer kind of deal). When the food arrived, the only thing on the plate was the burger and a salad. Additionally, not even all of the fixings came with my burger (I had to ask for them). When I asked my waiter about the fries, he said he would get them. I was charged extra for the fries (which are several more dollar charge than the salad).

In the end, for two people, we paid over $75 before the tip. Not happy.

ATMOSPHERE = 3 Stars
The atmosphere was pretty nice and was Air Conditioned, something that was extremely needed for the middle of summer in Las Vegas. The decorations and theme were pretty great, and kept my table somewhat entertained as we waited for our food.

CONCLUSION:
Really Disappointed. Went into Guy's really hoping to have an awesome experience, but with how much we paid, versus what we got, made the deciding factor for my friend and I; we won't be coming back on our next visit to Las Vegas.",uvF4kbkd2vW8lwI5mdcXYw,1,0,1,2DfC3VkaBl1BhxJ5EOZoQA

My brother had mentioned before that the aroma that emits from this establishment will peek your interest and urge you to step inside, and it sure worked on my girlfriend and I. We had no issue drifting in to experience something new.

Something new in more ways then one. This was the first time I had been anywhere that has a cut down menu after a certain time. The menu was small but not short of intriguing and delicious sounding items. We went with the Fireball Whisky Wings, and Quad Fries. Both items were so good and they gave us so much. 

The food was really good but the condiments were what I have to rave about. The garlic ranch that came with the fries was hands down the best ranch I have ever had. I wish they bottled it and sold it in stores. The quad fries were unique, it was a basket of four different types of fries, waffle, sidewinders, julienne, and crinkle cut, something for everyone. Wings could be ordered in different quantities so we ordered twelve of their Fireball Whisky Wings and these I enjoyed very much. I have a weird thing about eating chicken on the bone but these were cooked so well that the meat slid right off the bone. They tasted as if they were baked, lightly fried and then covered in sauce. The meat was juicy with the outside having a little crisp. Again the dipping sauce was the thing that  had my attention. It was a blue cheese wasabi sauce, weird combination I know. Somehow it worked, spicy and tangy all in one. 

The service here was top notch, I am always afraid to just order a few small items and watch the waiter or waitress roll their eyes in disgust. Since we just wanted a taste of this place, all that was ordered was some wings, fries, a beer, and a soda. The waiter just said ""excellent, let me get this order in right away for you"", no ""anything else?"", or ""did you need a few more minuets to pick out some more items?"". He was perfectly content with our small order. He came back twice to see if our food was good, filled my soda up twice and quickly got us some more of that amazing garlic ranch that we quickly devoured.

Next positive of this place was the decor. The way I described it while sitting there was a rustic sort of American Pickers kind of vibe. A lot of interesting antique items on the walls. A very comfortable night environment, and if you do not like the inside they have a large outdoor patio that overlooks the Vegas street folk. They are not short of televisions either, at least five right around me, and most of the stations were appropriately tuned into cooking shows which was a nice attention to detail. The silverware was beefy heavy metal and the lighting was nice and dim.

I really enjoyed this place. The best part part is enjoying their tasting menu. So when I go back to Vegas in a few months I will get here in time to try something off their full menu. My suggestion is to stop in, enjoy the service, decor, grab a little snack, and for heavens sake try the garlic ranch!",yzwM0CciecSwsLqWGITXyw,1,0,4,htEb4gr5SQ1K9Kao2OT1AA

in hindsight, we should have just had a few drinks at the bar as the manager was the barkeep and was on his game on both a social and drink making manner. plus they had an awesome selection of craft beers.

we ordered the pepperoni pretzels which were partially covered with pepperoni. the problem was that these pretzels were unfortunately made long in advance and were soggy where the the meat was situated. 

i had the cajun chicken sandwich, which was bland with a capital b and for some reason had almost zero chicken! wtf?  

the saving grace to the meal was the hamburger with the macaroni and cheese topping that my wife liked! her only observation was that she could not really taste the burger. also, the service was very prompt.

lastly, if you are worried about cholesterol or healthy eating, this is not the spot for you or me.

I went through the credit in practically one meal, but had two alcoholic drinks with that one meal.

I went three times over the course of four days

My first visit, I had something called the Tatted Up Turkey burger and it was huge but i manged to scarf the entire thing down and the pretzel bun it comes on was exactly the type of bun this sandwich called for. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. 

My drink of choice was the Cucumelon. Watermelon and cucumber.  Yes, the two go together very well with Hendrick gin, so I went for a second one.

My second visit I had the Flat Iron Steak with smashed potatoes, it was basically brunch for me, around 11am so I went with one of the Bloody Mary's they sell. 

 Im not a bloody mary drinker at all, but this day it seemed like everyone sitting at the bar had one, and I didn't want to be the odd man out.  I was NOT disappointed. I cant tell you all the stuff they garnish the bloody mary with, but I drunk on it for maybe an hour after returning to my room and didn't eat the sausage that was part of the drink until sometime later that night. 

its Vegas baby, they let you leave the restaurant with your drink 

The third day I kept it simple with the Fireball Whiskey wings.  Not a fan of Fireball, but these wings were delicious and the blue cheese, please someone get guy to bottle that up and sell it at my local Publix  Get plenty of napkins and plenty of water.   Returned to the cucumelon drink.  Again, I went for a second one.

5054019,2014-11-04,2,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"AMBIANCE: 2 - I wasn't impressed by the look of the restaurant. It was like a cross between a saloon/log cabin with flat screens to make it a more accessible place for men, so they can eat and watch the game. It looks like a place where modern day, tough-guy bikers are supposed to hang out..with those skulls on the napkins ha! 

They had an okay seating area, but the staff didn't clean it very well. They left tons of crumbs on the seats!! 

SERVICE: 4 - The staff was awesome. Super friendly and funny! They are also very young and some are good-looking ;) 

But, I felt like I was seated after a very long time. There were quite a few ""closed sections""..and even after waiting a super long time, they still didn't clean the table well, which was a little gross. 

FOOD: 3 - The food was definitely average. I had the truffle fries and the Fireball Whisky Wings. Both of which were served pretty lukewarm, which was not that pleasant. I wanted it to be served hot!!! 

Their system of leaving warm things out is ineffective. It leaves the food way, way too cold for my taste. I would have rather taken my food scalding than barely warm. The food would have been way better if served hot. 

The highlight of the wings was the bleu cheese wasabi dipping sauce. It was a great combination and made the chicken loads better! Truffle fries were good, but nothing to write home about. My parents ordered the burgers, and they are probably the best things on the menu. 

In conclusion, it was just okay. I just really wanted hot food--being served cold food made it taste old and not newly cooked.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,5,3,3,Zr-BIfOi76IDi8mymWQlvg

The wait was long but thanks to a friend's Diamond status with Total Rewards we got seated right away. Unfortunately, there were not a lot of options so we sat outside.  I'm all for alfresco dining but this is far from a beautiful vista.  It's Vegas after all.  The music was loud and the band across the way could be heard.  This is not a bad thing but the deck truly has a rock 'n' roll vibe.  

What we ate -
Ahi tuna tacos - perfectly cubed and seasoned tuna cradled in a crispy wonton skin shaped like a taco shell.  - enjoyed by all
Greek Salad with Humus - The salad was great.  Had to do some digging to find this Schmeer of hummus on the bottom of the plate. I hate to quote my father here but if I'm paying that much for a salad they should chop it.  If I wasn't sharing the salad with the table it probably wouldn't of been that big of a deal. 
Pulled pork sandwich with fries - The sandwich was HUGE!!  Tender pork seasons just right with a bit of a kick -- my friends opted out of the pretzel roll but I think it would've been great.  I love that the side of fries is three different kinds fries.

If you're familiar with Guy Fieri on TV and his personality. You will see it echoed prominently in the look & design of his restaurant. Even the attitude & energetic atmosphere exuded by the employees represent Guy Fieri's style. Of course, if you find Guy Fieri's persona & shows unappealing, this would not be the place for you.
I've tried the Tatted-up Turkey burger, '67 Cajun chicken sandwich & mac & cheese bacon burger entrees. All were awesome, full of flavor. Each comes with a fry mix & the burgers are massive. The mac & cheese was quite rich. Some might find it too much so, but heck, theres mac & cheese in there, what do you expect right? The '67 surprised me in that the blackened chicken was super tender & cooked perfectly.  And a tasty turkey burger is always a good thing.
Their appetizers were all very yummy too. My favorites are the Rojo Rings, onion rings that come hanging on a pipe accompanied by a sriracha ketchup. The Guy-talian fondue dippers, giant breadstickers wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage & provolone cheese dip. I was even dipping my fries in the cheesy dip 'cause I loved it so much.
Waiters & servers were very attentive & lively. I was also fortunate enough to meet Mike, the manager of the establishment. I would be willing to go out of my way to The Quad just to come to Guy Fieri's. I do find it interesting that one of the low end hotel casinos on the strip is home to two great food spots.

I didn't know where the restaurant was, and walked down the LINQ Promenade looking for it.  Once we walked around LINQ, we saw it on the corner across from Harrah's.  We accessed the entrance from inside which was a narrow hall.  The hostess let us know it could be a 45 min. wait and we said ok, and then she said it could be faster.  There are 2 small benches outside of the hostess area in dark corners, as well as one seating area by the hostess stand.

It took about 10 minutes and we were shown to our table with booth and chair seating.  We were close enough to our neighbours that we could touch them.  The menu seemed to have changed from my family's visit as the food they ordered wasn't on it.  I decided to get the pulled pork sandwich and although it's not listed, it comes with different cut fries or a salad.  That's good as most of the sandwiches and burgers are between $15-20.  

The food comes out fast! It was probably less than 5 minutes after ordering and I noticed that most people around us also got their food quickly.  The pork was nicely seasoned but tasted a little greasy on the bun.  The fries were good and I liked the crinkle cut ones.  The portion was big and I took half my sandwich to go, but we wanted to try the dessert.

Our dessert was a mountain of mint ice cream covered with chocolate sauce, cookies, and large chocolate chips.  It was hard as you make your way to the middle of the dessert but better than melting.  The server couldn't believe we were able to finish it! This is a dessert that can be shared between 4! 

It's loud with the TVs showing the football games and music playing on the speakers.  

The service to order dessert and refill water was slow.  We had a 10% coupon from our hotel but the server gave us 20% off instead.  The food was good, and comes out fast and big! Come hungry!",wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg,5,4,4,3ugkX8wBQo9ERyGQZ9XAYg

We've been trying out this Nevada weed all morning and decided to get some food.  We spent about 3 minutes walking around the outside looking for the entrance when we finally discovered the entrance was inside the casino.

After being seated outside, we were greeted with our waiter who looked like a bond villian, but was dressed like a cowboy. I asked him what's good around these parts and he goes off and lists dishes that sound like they were named by a 12 year old obese child.

My girl saw $20 unlimited mimosas and jumped at the chance. I quickly followed as soon as I saw Maple Bacon French toast. She been feeling guilty this whole trip so she got the veggie wraps. Which I feel like Guy was pressured to put into the menu at gunpoint.

This shit was amazing. I heard an old woman snap her neck on the walkway as she spotted the French toast.  It was beautiful, cascading ropes of maple syrup will drizzled over gracefully.

Whatever they put in the bacon is amazing, some sweet sprice that adds a hole new dimension. I felt like eating that bacon made me grow a third ball.

Some homeless guy walked by and cleared the whole dining area, smelled like a wet dog, but other than that the experience was pricey, but quite a wonderous experience.",AesJmRDiCq70NBefvlIO0A,0,0,4,he1jJC7SoUh0n0P6yZzj0Q

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For ""shareable"",  respectable ""sashimi won-taco"" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The ""fondue dippers"" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

""Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie"".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A ""big dipper"" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The ""off-da-hook smash burger"" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the ""mac-n-cheese bacon burger""  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.

Saw their HUGE Bloody Mary's on the Food Network Channel and decided to try the smaller version.  This drink was nice and spicy and came with jalapenos, spicy sausage, candied marble bacon and a celery stalk.  You can taste the Vodka, and since my drink came out late, it was FREE.

Ordered the Mayor of Flavortown burger.  The burger patty was cooked nice and was blanketed with seasoned pastrami, which I thought was overcooked.  Swiss cheese, coleslaw, dill pickles, onion straws, and Dijon mustard accompanied all of this sitting on top of a pretzel bun.

The bun was a little on the hard side, so I ate it ""protein style"" (w/o the bun).  The fries that accompanied the burger were good.

All in all, the food was okay.  It didn't suck, but didn't match up to BurGR.  This restaurant is located in the LINQ Hotel.

Unfortunately, they are no longer on the menu and were replaced with regular buffalo wings.   They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.",cJKH1r_6ICgvjcNjm6r9rQ,0,0,2,Apt0OtuZiavHNB2aFcPt_Q

These burgers are serious business my friends. They forgot to mention that each burger comes with extra napkins! On the menu there's salads, sandwiches, and burgers but for the Guy Fieri experience, I think you gotta go with a signature burger. As a plus, each burger comes with a fries sampler with 4 different types of cuts so you don't have to order fries on the side. Don't expect much from the fries though, just average. 

We shared the Mac n Cheese burger and asked them to cut it in half for us since I knew it was going to be monstrous. We also got the rojo rings (HUGE onion rings) and it came with this surprisingly great sriracha/ketchup dipping sauce. We even used it for the fries that came with the burger. It was messy to eat but so tasty, and I'm not even a fan of mac n cheese. Btw I think the menu said it won some sort of nyc burger competition in 2013 so there you go!

The restaurant is in the Linq, nice setup. The staff was nice. 

We ordered a burger, The Mayor of Flavortown and had fries. The fries were interesting they were basically a mixed bad of waffles fries, chips, crinkled fries and normal fries. We wanted something different with burger which had pastrami. The food was excellent. The burger was fantastic. 

Drinks: I ordered an Angry Orchard Cider on tap and my wife had one of their signature mixed drinks that came in just a normal size hurricane glass. 

Now we know we are in Vegas the home of overpriced adult fun but the burger we had, we split it. Our bill with tip was more than $50. The signature drink was $14. Not worth it. 

If we do go back, we will be drinking water. Gotta stay hydrated.",vO4Sz12y5vdcL_10AOx0PA,0,0,3,jxxFB5UWjgytUP8Y6lIzFg

The appetizer ahi won ton tacos I think were amazing!! So many different flavors. Loved them!
Husband had Motley Q, he was in heaven. Loved every bit of it. I cant say enough about the fries....just the thought I want to go back now! Homemade ketchup was great, not sweet like store brands. I dont remember name of what I had but was so good. It had an au jus with it. There was so much food we could have eaten ourselves into a coma. Everything with food was perfect! We were so full we could not eat any dessert. Though they all looked like the bomb.com!!!
Drinks from the bar I have to say were not so good. They were thrown together and probably worst we've had. There were no garnishments on any 5 drinks. Bloody Mary was literally tomatoe juice & vodka. Was so boring that my husband gave bartender a recipe to make for him. Was much better but still no garnishment. No olives, no celery, nothing. We did talk to general manager about it and he did take care of the issue. Assistant manager came by & we made suggestions on the drinks. He did say every drink is to come with garnishment. Both managers were awesome and had great attitudes and asked us personal questions about our visit to Las Vegas. They seemed very sincere. 

We definitely will go again when in Vegas!! We so LOVE LOVE this restaurant!! 

Wish I could give 5 stars but because of the drinks I had to give 4 stars.

We finally made it to the parking garage, which by the way you access through the Harrah's parking. Once you get in there follow the signs to the Ling casino parking lot. 
It's not often l will pay $21.00 for a burger, but l splurged and got his famous bacon macaroni and cheese burger. I asked for no bun....cut down on some carbs , and it comes with fries, spicy waffle and regular shoestring fries. Hubby got a bacon cheeseburger. We were both very happy with our meal. Yummy is an understatement.
As for drinks, l got the Austin Iced tea with sweet tea vodka and l believe peach schnapps. Who cares it was delish, but pretty strong.  Hubby got Guy's winery red blend. Says it was good but hes really a Shiraz man. 
We had no room for dessert l needed someone else to share the Cheesecake challenge and from what l saw the dessert selection was awesome.

I'm a big fan of Guy's DDD show on TV. I seen the episode where they did a feature on this restaurant. I remember one of the dishes featured on the show was the brisket. They showed off their custom smoker and described the method that goes into making their brisket. Looked delicious on TV.

I skimmed though their menu and it seemed pretty limited. None of the sandwiches or burgers looked appetizing to me so I went with the brisket. When I ordered the waiter said its the best thing on the menu and said 'its so tender!'

Well, the brisket was not good. It was tough. It was dry as hell. It was cold when it got to my table. And it had a stinky smell. No lie. What ever spice or rub they use has a strong skunk-like smell. I wouldn't recommend it.

My wife had the mac and cheese burger and she loved it. It looked like one of those sandwiches on the show where its so big you can barely take a bite out of it. She also had the Bloody Mary and it looked like a meal all by itself it had so many toppings. So add a star for that.

Service was excellent. They had football on the TV's and we were seated right away. Its one of those places with a fun Vegas-y vibe. Add another star for that.",JLqFX-w2a4CyiP0wttt81A,0,0,3,PY92VY4CdOE77NM85wLnMg

We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and had to wait about 15 minutes (this was CES week after all). Our waitress showed up quickly and we had drinks in a matter of minutes. Perfect.

We ordered appetizers (GUY-TALIAN FONDUE DIPPERS and BRISKET NACHOS) , both were excellent, very flavorful and large portions, suited for a table of four.

Then orders of the Original Ring Burger and the Mayor of Flavortown Burger. Both amazing, but extremely ""heavy"", I would guess one GigaByte of calories each.

To finalize the adventure in fat nirvana, we got the GUY'S CHEESECAKE CHALLENGE, huge and excellent.

We really liked the experience, although a bit on the heavy side. It is a fun place to have great eats and mingle with friends, and escape the overpriced staples of the big casinos.

What you get for the money is more than worth the price - it is super delicious and the portions are large.I would for sure return next time I am in Vegas craving a burger and fries!",NpZ6hMBncbIvAo4btwrvZQ,3,2,5,kPtCbzX8fjRJVQ4Bl4FZ9A
5252206,2015-03-25,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,This was my second trip to this restaurant and this time it was just average.  It was a pretty busy Thursday night during March Madness and we sat outside which was great.  They were showing the basketball games which was also great but a group a college kids were getting unruly using obscene language and arguing with the group across from them.  The management did nothing to stop them and it was really annoying to the other diners some of which had children at their table.  The other issue that night was that the bartender was having a really bad night.  Of the 4 drinks that came to our table 3 had to go back due to mistakes.  The waiter was obviously very frustrated with the bartender and you could tell they had words.  The positive was that the food was excellent again.  The portions are huge but the quality did not suffer.  We each ordered a separate dish and all walked away extremely impressed.  I had to take off for the lack of crowd control and the poor bartender service but the food was great.  Will definitely go back.,OX6870WoUzX1QZZRGQUAFQ,0,0,3,Vhi8oGQ-A_1BOjO9x-XezQ

His food however I am a huge fan of! 

If you're a fan of burgers of belly busting variety, this is the place for you! Huge, juicy and elbow licking good! They don't shy away from portion size or toppings, piled high to the point you actually cannot get it in your mouth. Good luck finishing your meal! 

With burgers to suit all palates, you won't be disappointed. And with sides like the trio of fries you will be back for more... once you finish the leftovers! Lol...

5278202,2014-12-23,3,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I cannot recommend the churros enough! You have not lived until you've tasted the sugary deep-fried cinnamon sweetness of Guy Fieri's Mexican Churros ($11 with Total Rewards Card). It's all about that dulce de leche dip, man! I could live without the spicy chocolate dip, but I won't let that take away from the overall awesomeness of my favorite spot for churros. 

Excuse my ravings. Now, here's the nitty gritty. Guy Fieri's menu has changed very frequently since my first to this restaurant in the Quad. Prices have gone up $2-3 on all menu items and apparently they've gotten rid of their nachos (lame). Here are my main gripes:

1) They charge $4 for a fountain drink. Really?!
2) The tables are dirty. The tables that have the wood planks on them have tons of food/random sauce wedged in the cracks. Eww.
3) The uniforms of the staff are hideous. They're a tacky denim/Western getup. I hate them. No one likes a ""Denim Dan"".
4) Guy Fieri's is extremely unfriendly for vegetarians, unless you order fries or a salad, which isn't really food. Hence my preference for eating at Guy's mostly for dessert only. 

Okay, now for the good stuff. Everything is presented as an edible masterpiece. Guy's WINS for presentation. Also, the portions are ginormous. Yay! The Caesar salad ($14) is a goodie. There's plenty for two and it can serve as an entree in its own right. The dressing is on the thicker side and the Parmesan cheese was scrumptious. My husband and I had to do the ""push away"" to save room for our main course. 

When Guy's used to have nachos on the menu, those were great too. Very creative and extremely cheesy. The chef's spared no expense on loading the nachos up with ooey gooey cheese!  The jalapenos were my favorite part! Somehow they had an almost sweet taste to them. 

My husband ordered the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger ($19). He barely put a dent in it, it was so huge. He was quite pleased with his burger. 

We did order the Guy's Cheesecake Challenge ($13), once. It's overrated. I'm not really a cheesecake person anyways, so don't mind me. I just gave it a shot because so many people were raving about it, I thought, well if it's so good maybe I'll like cheesecake this one time. No such magical moment happened. I didn't like the potato chips or the pretzels shoved in the cheesecake. They tasted stale. The cheesecake itself just didn't do it for me. Oh well. 

Service has always been great or average. We usually come on Monday or Tuesday nights, so the wait time is under 10 minutes. 

In sum, I like Guy's. The food is fun. To be honest though, I'll probably only eat here for dessert whenever I feel like splurging.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,5,3,4,lFhgPoiLccrICv4w8SXnUQ

In a city where the next big thing is always a week or two away and the majority of local 'critics' are essentially writing fluff-pieces based on comped meals arranged by the folks in marketing at major casinos I knew I needed to wait a while before visiting Guy Fieri's Las Vegas Kitchen & Bar and with a new brunch menu launched on August 1st without a whole lot of hype the time finally seemed right, myself and two others sitting down for four of Chef Leitera's newest creations plus one of Fieri's outlandish desserts just after 10:00am on Saturday with the restaurant just under 3/4 filled.  Not particularly a fan of the spiky haired celebrity but able to appreciate his place in pop-culture it was with an open mind that I approached the doors of the Linq-side locale and greeted by a hostess plus a surprising lack of 'branding' (compared to the likes of Ramsay, Puck, or even Batali) we were quickly led to a table, the service to follow effusively friendly and surprisingly efficient with questions she could not answer deferred to visits from the GM and chef himself.  Every bit the lively scene one would expect of a 'tatted-up' venue spilling from indoors to out yet far less loud than many thanks to high ceilings, reclaimed woods, and plenty of glass it was with the first of several cups of Stumptown Coffee in hand that our morning began and with The Doors alternating to country tunes and 70s hits overhead it would not be long before our savory course arrived, each plate well-crafted with subtle nuances to be discovered amidst decidedly conspicuous portions as the biscuit proved amongst the best in Vegas while the chili walked a fine line between heat and sweet, the white cheddar lending a sharp salinity at the top of each bite.  Always a sucker for sweets it was onward to the griddle that our meal progressed and again investing in a duo I was immediately impressed by the toothsome cornmeal pancakes enveloping a core of butter cookies and fresh fruit only to then be let down by the French Toast that was simply too 'wet' with custard to stand up to the heavily sugared bacon and sugar-torched fruit, the amalgam altogether too sweet and in need of some sort of textural variance - perhaps something along the lines of a trip to the deep-fryer in order to crisp the bread as was done in the case of a 'Monte Cristo' more than happy to eschew any façade of healthiness as smoky marshmallow fluff encased in golden brioche found balance in cinnamon spread and rich chocolate, the housemade raspberry preserves a nod to the classic adding a fruity finish that lingered long on the palate.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,9,3,PhShlzLT7mE7KTJizYPe_Q

I walked into this crowded restaurant as a vegan and crawled out as a carnivore. Guy's food is life-changing! I've actually been here numerous times - which is very rare for me. We always order an absurd amount of food when we come. Here's what we've tried:

APPETIZERS
Guy-talian Fondue Dippers - I don't eat pork, but my friends devoured them in record time

Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries - the chili had pork, but once again my friends couldn't get enough

Vegas Fries - intensely flavorful fries with the tang of blue cheese

ENTREES
Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger - obviously I had them hold the bacon, but this is one of the best burgers I've ever tasted

Pic-A-Nik Sandwich - turkey sandwich with donkey sauce, cranberry sauce,potato chips, and other goodness on top of a pretzel roll 

DESSERT
Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae - phenomenal!

S'mores Monte Cristo - ooey gooey buttery goodness 

Triple Doublemint Pie - skip it...hard as a rock

Guy's Cheesecake Challenge - half a cheesecake with pretzels, chocolate sauce, and potato chips...I was not up for the challenge

Well I tried to get their attention but they would not look our way. Wife finally waved an employee down and asked if we could sit outside the bar area to watch the people go by. We eventually made it to that area and waited...and waited and waited and no one came to us to offer us anything.  We tried making eye contact with a couple employees that were near the area with negative results.

As we passed by the hostess I told her that no one would assist us and she just smiled and said, ""sorryyyy"", and then went back to conversating with the other gals.

5328940,2015-01-13,20,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Someone asked me privately from YELP If I was picky with food because I used to cook for celebrity chefs? I'd like to say no because there are some food establishments that aren't considered 5 star that for a plate I'd slap my mama---but I am harder on establishments that consider themselves elite amongst Top Chefs. 

A friend recommended this place to me and I decided to give it a chance. Normally I don't frequent celebrity chef establishments because having worked in this industry I know that the chef is NOT who is cooking the food. I was excited about going on the strip since I avoid it like EBOLA, so I think my expectations were too high.

We were given a seat on a very busy corner and our next best option was to be seated by this wall with a flat screen. We opted by the wall. While waiting for our food we stared at this wall feeling like inmates serving a prison sentence. Our server brought us some glasses of water and joked that we were about to enjoy the lovely minerals from Lake Mead. After one sip, I knew what he was talking about. YUCK! I couldn't get over the jumbo ice cubes and thought they were the most beautiful thing. 

We started out with the triple T fries which were...OK. Only the very top of the fries contained that truffle ""goodness"" and it was so faint. Which means they probably didn't ""toss"" all of the ingredients together. They just piled and sprinkled it on top. Cooking 101. I love truffle oil and I barely got any, leaving me feel like I just ordered garlic parmesan fries. On the menu it says, ""Truffle, truffle, + more truffle."" It was more like, ""Lies, lies, + more lies!""

Not wanting to gorge myself silly I ordered Bruthas Badass Caesar salad and The Generals wings. My friend ordered some jumbo burger.
Our food came and after one look I could tell that my bread on the plate was stale. Here's a little inside info for you guys. Croutons are usually made with DAY OLD bread to avoid cost and waste. There's nothing wrong with that, but after a day----YOU DON'T MAKE CROUTONS or KEEP the ones you made previously.....you just cut your losses and toss it. I knew right away that jumbo crouton was made more than a day in advance. It was so friggin' hard and you could tell by looking at it closely that it had started to get old because when you cook old ass bread it leaves a pattern that looks pulled. It's hard to explain without showing you closely, but maybe you can see it in my photos.
The salad dressing was sooooo watery and thin, which was most likely caused by tossing the lettuce while wet. I don't even want to get into that. 

The wings were hard as a brick! They were overcooked then glazed with this wierd Walmart Hoisin tasting sauce. Nothing had flavor. My friend didn't enjoy his burger either. It was cold. We didn't complain because I understood that it wasn't something that could be corrected. The food IS WHAT IT IS due to errors that need to be corrected by the Executive Chef, or Guy Fieri just really sucks. I'm gonna sound like an old timer, but back in my day a chef wasn't a chef until he/she spent over ten years training, spent years in Europe giving blood, sweat, and tears on the cooking line, and even then you were humble until you proved yourself leading a line. Too many people call themselves chefs when they haven't mastered the basics of flavor. Even I haven't mastered anything at this point since I left that world and discontinued my training--but I really was hard on this restaurant. Food can't just look pretty on a plate---it has to taste good too. I expected much more from a big name ""chef"".",jwvmw22-y4eMq2rzi0wAeQ,22,15,1,arg5DDjELojkvN_UM9o-sA

Luckily, our waiter was super kind and attentive to our needs. He probably filled my glass of water about 4 times without me asking. Good guy!

So this review is just of their food, though their service was good - no complaints. (Actually, two bartenders fought over serving me...luckily, the male-half of them won out. :-) )

The burger was $20 and I would only spend that on a burger and fries in Vegas. Otherwise, this was worth about $13. Don't get me wrong; it was good, just too damn big. Eventually, I had to use the plastic fork and knife. And the Mac & Cheese stayed with the burger, which I liked. 

The fries were a mixture of two brands; very nice. Unfortunately, the ketchup they gave me to go I had to be extremely conservative on since it was such a small portion.

And speaking of small portions, I'm gonna need to order their smallest burger next time. This was a chore to eat. Again, still good, just hard to eat. I do have a big mouth...just not for actual food.

Now after I stopped eating meat and dairy products, of course, we were looking to find a place to eat at late late evening. We asked hostess if there is any options for me to get anything to eat at this place and been told that there is one vegetarian option. We gave it a try. And it was a very good decision.
We explained my situation to our waiter and he went on and beyond to accommodate our needs. Every thing was prepared a vegan way, our truffle fries was made vegan with cheese and milk content soused on a side, he also brought me some extra souse on a side. 
I still eat fish so it wasn't any problem with my entree , but he made sure there wasn't any butter used. He was also fun to talk to. We had a wonderful time. 
Food is beyond tasty, that truffle fries was something. It was completely gone ( usually we kind of skeptical about fries for appetizers and never finish  it) we were thinking about second order of it.

When we got the text we were seated promptly. Our table was in the patio which was nice, but the band at Carnival was a bit too loud (luckily they only had a few songs left before the end) and the table was slanted/wobbily. I cracked a joke about it with the waiter, but he just made a comment saying it wasn't so bad. We had issues where if one of us took our hand off the table it would lean to the otherside possibly spilling our drinks.

Onto the food. We split an order of General Tso's lollipop wings which were great! They came with crystalized peanuts, wasabi peas, and brown rice chips to dip them in. I really wanted to try some wings here after seeing the pictures of it, unfortunately these were the only ones that sounded appetizing. I wanted some more traditional spicy wings, but the closest one to that was the Fireball wings (which I'm not a fireball fan) and they had spicy bbq sauce on it. I'm glad we got the general tso's.

Main course we both got burgers and split them. We got the Mac'n'Cheese burger and the other one I forgot the name for (onion rings, kicker sauce, and bbq sauce). Both were good, I was worried the Mac'n'Cheese burger would be way too heavy and it wasnt overloaded with it.

Since it was about 35 degrees outside, we weren't interested in that, despite having heat lamps.

The only knock I have against this place is that the menu is a bit limited.  There were several things that looked good to me, but my wife was struggling to find something.  I had the Bacon Mac and Cheese Burger, while my wife decided on a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  Each sandwich comes with a variety of different fries, which is cool.  You get crinkle cut, shoestring, wedge, waffle, etc.  I thought that was a cool idea.  The portions here are enormous, so be sure to bring your appetite.  My wife and I could barely finish half of our meals.  I thought the food tasted really good, so I'd be willing to give this place another shot.  It might be best to spilt a meal between two people, since they're so large.  It's probably not the best place to bring kids, as it's loud and there's a lot of boozing going on.

All in all, I'm a fan of Guy, and I thought his restaurant in Vegas was good.  We got out of here for about $40-$50 for the two of us.  Give this place a shot if you're in Vegas, and sit out on the patio if it's nice outside.",MpQ8K-NFcIB1gvNUwnAYgQ,2,3,4,-9QgXuBTWg8X1jmseAWB7A

We got there sometime after 11am and it wasn't too busy, but it started to fill up soon after. We sat outside where it was sort of shady, sort of not, depending on where you sat.

Oh, and tables were packed kind of close together. But I love outdoor seating on the Strip so I dealt with it all :)

Service was pretty good. We received proper greetings upon entrance and exit, and we never had to wait too long for anything.

 We ordered the mac and cheese burger, the pork sandwich and 3 cocktails.  Big high calorie and fat portions (appropriate for sharing due to massive calories surely contained in each portion but we ordered separately not knowing). Now, the fries were the best I ever had.  

Drinks were weak and expensive.  $12-15!  That should be a strong amazing drink for that price.  The lemon drop one came in a half empty glass that looked like the waiter had spilled half of it.  The other one was jammed full of ice and was weak as could be.  If this was it I'd give 3 stars.

The worst part was the HORRIBLE service.  Our server talked as fast as an auctioneer I had to ask him to repeat!  He brought the food then we ate it. My friend was almost finished but not quite, I was about 2/3 done. He appears, says to us ""are you done"" while reaching his hand for her plate.  Flustered she just said yes. I had to say no.  

Now I'm eating alone and being hurried along feeling bad about eating like I'm not in a eating competition. I finish my meal. THE MINUTE I FINISH, he comes by, grabs the plate, asks if we want dessert and if we WANT THE CHECK! 

 The attitude was like being at a low end Dennys with a waiter chasing table turnover for their instant tip.  The service did not deserve a penny of tip.  Of course we had to leave our 18% because that's how it is these days.  I could say he was just a one off but the other servers were whizzing past our table with trays held up and more than once came within an inch of banging right into my friends HEAD.

For a restaurant hosted by a Food Network Star, I was not impressed..

We ordered the Fireball wings, the Vegas fries, and the brisket nachos. The nachos were okay, the meat was nicely cooked and the flavors were balanced. The cheese sauce made it seem a little on the cheap side. The fries and the wings had the same 'cheap Franks hot sauce' taste and I didn't like either. The fries were drenched in this sauce and had blue cheese to boot and were BEYOND salty. The wings were breaded and also had the same sauce - with the name ""fireball"" i was expecting something much more sweet and the same thing happened when I bit into them as when I bit into the fries: my lips puckered up from the overuse of SALT..

The staff was okay, not super friendly or quick when it came to drinks, food, refills...anything really.

Cost: EACH appetizer was over $15. For the price and after the taste trial, we were pretty disappointed. I know that it is off of the Strip, but I expected at least the wings to be crispy and flavorful.

I wouldn't take anyone back here who was here to visit our town, I would rather go to a smaller local restaurant that put more love into their food than this restaurant did...

The wait for a table was supposed to be about 90 minutes, but we ended up lucking out and getting seated a lot faster...everything was looking promising. We were getting a late lunch and had early dinner plans, so we decided to split an entree and a salad. Unfortunately (for him) I'm a vegetarian and neither one of us wanted a veggie burger (one of the only vegetarian items on the menu...which wasn't TOO big of a surprise). So instead we got a salad and dessert. We also ordered 2 sodas. About half an hour goes by and we haven't seen our server at all. Eventually we tracked him down and he basically admitted that he never placed our food order...no actual apology though. Awhile later, he came by and confirmed that he submitted the order and blamed it on a receipt issue with another customer. By that point, we were both starving, absolutely freezing, and miserable. About an hour after we placed our order, the salad (a large but simple 4 ingredient caesar salad) and a massive (and admittedly delicious) dessert were served to us at the same time. Really? I get that this wasn't the most conventional ""meal"" choice, but have some common sense to at least ask if we want them together or separate. 

We inhaled the food and just wanted to get out of there. Despite the massive inconvenience, we never really got an apology and our $50 bill was hardly justifiable. I get that everything is marked up in Vegas, but $50 for a 4-ingredient salad, essentially a large ice cream sundae and 2 sodas? I'd recommend going pretty much anywhere but here.

We ordered the Vegas Fries.  Loved those, too.  Actually, I think I REALLY loved 'em--more than the Triple T's.  Check the menu to see what they are.

We had a caesar salad that came with a giant crouton underneath.  The salad was kind of small if you consider the giant crouton took up a lot of room on the plate and I think it was stale.  This was a bland caesar among caesars.
Since we couldn't have ribs, the server suggested the brisket nachos.  The chips were definitely stale and the toppings were too sparse.  I liked the idea of them but was disappointed.

I ordered the Breakfast Sausage, Bacon & Eggs. This was listed as: 
two eggs cooked any style, served with two slices of apple wood smoked
bacon, two links of chicken apple sausage, house made home fries tossed with peppers & onions & a warm sage biscuit. When I got my meal I noticed that something was missing. I looked around at other patrons and saw it was my biscuit. I flagged down my waiter and he apologized and grabbed me my biscuit. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the bacon was crispy and not very greasy, the home fries had a little spicy and my husband loved it. The biscuit was only ok and I think it would have been better if I had real butter to spread on it.

My husband was hungry and decided to order the Guy's Big Bite Burrito oft scrambled eggs, chorizo & breakfast potatoes, wrapped in a cheese quesdilla with fresh pico de gallo, black beans, guacamole & crispy fried tortilla chips & salsa. The burrito was huge!!!  This meal could have been shared with another person because if not the burrito sits in your stomach and you will need a good walk afterwards.

5499870,2014-06-23,1,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I think the 4 star average review this place has is spot on.

I enjoy Fieri's (nee: Ferry) show ""Diner's Drive-ins, and Dives"" on the Food Network very much.  Guy himself seems like kind of a d-bag but the places he visits are very interesting.

Being a d-bag from northern California, I suspect his own cuisine for his restaurants is firmly in the Flingers (google Office Space) category: over-engineered snack food for fat/lazy/stupid people.

Now, if you know this going in, it's not half bad.

The waitresses are done up in a denim skirt/dress thing and the waiters are in a similiar denim outfit.  OK I guess, but I prefer waitstaff to not be subject to a fixed  dress code unless I am at Hooters.

I got the drunken fish tacos and the truffle fries.  I could not finish the truffle fries, the bowl was huge.  The tacos were actually not bad, I could eat that regularly.  The fries weren't bad either, but I was on a business trip and eating alone.  To share, they would be perfect.

To sum up, there's really nothing wrong with this place, assuming you are OK with average middle-America mall type food.  This will amaze you.

It's a little hard to get to (unless you are staying at the Quad); you have to negotiate your way to the Self-Parking (or take the tram) and then find your way back to the car afterwards.  

I know it sounds like I'm dumping all over the place, but I did like it.  I would even go back and try something else out.  I bet it would be a blast with friends (kinda like a sports bar).  But haute cuisine it's not.  Expect something better than your average TGI-Fridays and you'll have a good time.

Another plus is that it is open late (2AM) which kept it on my ""list of places to try when I've been out all night and everything else is closed"".",p7RiGtUfifXYYfDcxcGcFg,0,0,4,ywP9lwPjrfhIqCEk5ndx4A

Our server was really nice, but extremely slow. We got our drinks after 20 minutes of ordering and our food - a salad and a burger - after a little over an hour. The only thing that came rather quick was the check of course 

Food: I got the Greek salad and boyfriend got the mac n cheese burger with fries. The salad must have been the worst Greek salad I've ever had. The dressing was really heavy and none of the vegetables were actually cut up. I had to individually cut each vegetable for it to be bite size which I though was a rather peculiar presentation.
The mac n cheese burger was well done instead of medium rare like my boyfriend asked, but the fries had a delicious garlic aioli sauce that made me give this place 2 stars instead of 1. 

Drinks: we both good bloody marys, which had a cool presentation but the Bloody Mary mix was store bought or just terribly mixed. 

All in all the place is very touristy, hence the really high prices for the sub par food and service, but they still get a lot of people because of their location.

This quick rundown is to justify the grading criteria:
Atmosphere: 3/5 (music too loud)
Food: 3/5 (everything was DELICIOUS!! but many things forgotten throughout meals)


wooohoo! Finally had the chance to try one of guy Fieri's restaurants!! He is one of my favorite chefs (Gordon Ramsay, Mario Battali, Giada DeLarentis in that list) and when in Vegas, Gordon's restaurant was...well certain issues prevented us from going so i was still happy getting to Guy's!

First off, the place was packed!! Saturday night and 20-30 people waiting outside!

My parents waited while I played my first game of blackjack (3 straight blackjacks ;)
We came in to find them seated on the outdoor patio and immediately: the music was way.too.damn.loud.!!! The type of music was no issue for me, personally . . . BUT the fact it was so loud + casino sounds + packed restaurant volume + Vegas strip sounds=no good at all!!!
Then our server was just...wack! My girlfriend and I sit down and immediately he comes over asking if we are ready to order . .. uhm chill! 

anyways, we went through the menu and this is how everyone ordered:
Greek Salad: i did not try it but mom liked it, unfortunately they forgot the hummus ...

fireball whiskey wings: oh my god!! These were delicious!! my girlfriend ordered these and hot damn!! they were not that spicy, but had a great kick and a whole lotta flavor!! simple, delicious and amazingly Guy-oriented! 

Motley Que Sandwich: my dad and I ordered and split this as well as the Vegas Fries (next item) the pulled pork was UH-MAZE-ING!! delicious, tender, juicy, a whole lotta pork on the which!! the bourbon brown sugar bbq sauce was just the right amount of sweet and tangy, and was perfect with the pork; i am  not sure what the donkey sauce is but i could tell there was another sharp flavor; the cheddar was thick and blended well with the whole sandwich! unfortunately, i just realized this sandwich was missing the onion straws and slaw . . . :( 
and lastly the Vegas Fries! Simply waffle fries tossed in buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese and a side of blue cheese+wasabi dressing! these were perfect!! the fries were still crispy since they were not ""soaking"" in the sauce just coated; the side sauce was delicious! (also a shot of buffalo sauce) and overall very great fries!

so, as mentioned at the top, I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to give this place a 4/5...BUT...due to the crazy loud music, lacking server, and forgotten items throughout the dishes, 3/5 is the best I could do :(
BUT also, I would love to return :)",iqsUoSxTpzAxt8AX8OgSZA,2,1,3,zNcm0GZH_KxNIekYXBeL_g

I ordered the Bacon Mac n cheese burger and was delighted. It was big - I managed to eat about 2/3 of it. The side of fries was most interesting- a combination of skinny, crinkle cut, & waffle fries. Seasoned with a spicy blend but the ketchup cut the heat nicely. My friend had the Original Ring burger. She finished it and loved every bite. Come here.

Well, as you can see, I'm leaving one of them. Being that we were both drinking, we made a poor decision to stop by this sad-famous chef named restaurant. 

It was pretty empty when we entered which should've given us a clear indication of how much the food sucked... We got the bacon Mac and cheese burger and the waffle chili cheese fries. I mean, how could you even go wrong with a combination like that? Well, you can at Guy's. The burger was so over cooked it was black, they basically just slapped some Kraft cheese on top of pasta and microwaved some bacon and put that monstrosity together... and my waffle fries!! My poor dried hard crispy fries. They sat in the fryer way too long. They basically just added a bunch of chili and cheese to cover up what they'd done, but you can't fool me! Honestly, Carl's Jr crisscut fries are better. And the cocktail, the $14 cocktail that was only filled just a little more than half way of my glass...

I had some friends in town and wanted to give this place another chance.  
I was feeling adventurous and tried the smoke and mirrors.fireball cinnamon whisky, fresh lemon juice, apple & cherry Juice dash of lagavulin single malt
I really enjoyed this drink.  
For food starters we split the Fondue Dippers, crisp breadsticks wrapped with pepperoni and an amazing provolone and sausage cheese dip. The breadsticks were forgettable but the dip was fantastic.  We took the manager's advice and kept the dip for our fries later.
For my entree I went with the 67 Cajun sandwich. From the menu "" This one packs a punch! It's crammed with blackened chicken, Andouille sausage, cheddar cheese, the creole trinity + Louisiana hot sauce.""
I got the hot sauce on the side.  The chicken, sausage and cheese were excellent.  I was a bit disappointed with the hot sauce as it tasted more buffalo than cajun but because I had it on the side, I was able to dip into the provolone dip.  The bread was a little chewy and didn't add anything to the dish but didn't hurt it either.

What struck me about this visit was the shrimp tacos that were skimpy and bland the first time we came were smothered in shrimp this time.  My friend enjoyed them.  The mac and cheese burger was also a hit with my other dining mate.

The fries remain the hit though and I still get a kick out of the different fries mixed together.  

For desert we had the smores.  a monte cristo style desert that rocked.  We couldn't finish it between the three of us because we were stuffed.

Finally, I commend the service again.  Colie (sp?) was an excellent waitress with a sharp wit and happy to make suggestions.  Colie really took this up to the fourth star.  

We also got to meet Chef Kyle and the managers and I am really impressed with their commitment to the restaurant's success and desire for it to stand on its own.

For my entree, I had the poutine.  The gravy and cheese were melted in a pool at the bottom of the bowl.  One congealed mass.  The fries were nice and crisp and they stayed crisp.  The ""steak"" was, I kid you not, 6 bites of the toughest meat I ever had.  The flat iron was not properly trimmed, and was totally streaked with connective tissue.  It was impossible to cut.

I had ordered a side Caesar salad.  It was billed as being garlicky.  The salad came out when I was almost done with my entree.  It tasted like Sysco dressing, no flavor.  The croutons which were so tantalizingly described on the menu, were nothing more than torn pieces of stale bread.

For the entree my friend recommended the bacon mac and cheese burger. Omg, it was amazing and I was definitely in heaven eating this thing. Seriously imagine a huge burger with mac and cheese in it. One of the best parts was the burgers come with fries. No extra charge! & not just fries but a variety. Truffle fries, onion rings, and regular fries, so you get to try a little bit of everything.

One ordered the Smash burger , one the Turkey burger , and 2 of us - the Mayor of Flavortown burger (couldnt be farther from the Truth). We also all split an order of Trash can nachos.
Lets start with the nacho - Described as loaded with cheese , brisket , jalapenos , etc. The nachos came in a charcoal starter metal can. The waitress ejected them on our plate. It was hard to find any meat on them , jalapenos almost non existent , smotherthed in VELVEETA ?? cheese with stale Tostitos style chips. Any other ingredients almost non existent. No sour cream or guacamole all for $ 16.50. Enough for the four of us but what a joke !!
 All of our burgers had the tiniest portions of fries. The buns on all 4 burgers were so small and disproportionate to the filling between the buns. We all agreed these were the most bland flavorless burgers we ever had. All Well Done when we all asked for Medium. These were close to 20 bucks each !! What a ripoff this place was !!! Do yourself a favor - Go to the smoky little dive bar called the Dispensary Lounge on Tropicana. Order the Steak burger with sauteed mushroom , bacon , and swiss with all the produce. Only $5.95 and one of the juciest BEST burgers in town. Trust me , I've been living in Vegas almost 6 years now !!",-Ia1lWvBNdgGySyB2VSgNQ,0,0,1,ebOzw8uKhAe05uD4GfvZNg

His food tends to be so over the top as it tries to incorporate almost every culinary cliche known to man.  It is like TGIFriday's on steroids.  Of the dishes we had that night I thought the Motley Que was pretty decent albeit a little on the sweet side.  The bread n butter pickle chips gave a nice dimension to the sandwich.  Mac n cheese burger was a bit too much and flavor of mac n cheese got drowned out by the burger.  The Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries is as if Nachos Supreme had an unholy love child with chili cheese fries.  I know that it may be a bit paradoxical, but there are so many flavors, that it ends up having no real flavor.  

Service was a miss for us that night as our server never came  by to check on how we were doing.  Sure he passed our table many times...at warp speed. We even had to wait 20 min for our to-go containers.  But this may improve as time goes on as it was pretty clear that they were all overwhelmed.

Not wanting to load up too much, had a Greek Salad and water.  The drinks looked amazing, but being the responsible parent I drank an Arnold Palmer.

Our server, Nichole, was very attentive and got our order right away and refilled my drink 3 times before we left. Sounds trivial, but many times I've had Arnold Palmer refills be just iced tea or lemonade.

The sandwich was amazing and I have to say we were quite surprised at the generous and tasty Greek Salad.  The pulled pork was both crispy and tender and the donkey sauce was nice and sweet.

Came here with about 17 people... Reservations were called in and confirmed ahead of time.  Sure enough, we all show up and the greeter says they don't take reservations and it'd be a 90 minute wait.  Wait, what?  Needless to say that struck a nerve with all of us.  Despite telling the greeter, who we spoke to on the phone, they weren't prepared for us.

A member of our group even took to Twitter asking for some assistance -- nothing.

In any case, we waited probably an hour or so to be sat and the waiter, who shared a similar likeness in his hairstyle to Guy, seemed rather overwhelmed by us.  He said he was only going to repeat the fixed menu once (we're 17 people in a LOUD restaurant dude) and I kind of knew what type of experience we were going to have based just on our initial observations. 

The food was OK ... Nothing I'd return for, let's put it that way, and I'm being objective.  The service, on the other hand, was bad.  I'm sure the tip was included for a party of our size, and I think that often people tend to feel that when that's the case, they don't have to put in as much effort.  Things like water being refilled, dishes being cleared, even a ""how is everything"" were absent.

15% eggs
15% potatoes
70% wrap/bread

It was just so heavy and not tasty because the eggs and potatoes made up so little of the wrap. You only realize after unwrapping it of how truly imbalanced it is.

After we found the video of the famous trash nachos, for weeks we drooled over the anticipation of them. We finally get to our hotel The Linq and decide to take a dive into this mountain of nacho chaos and as they came to the table we were all a little ... Okay very dissappointed in the presentation and quantity of this plate . For one... Okay $20 for nachos , you're in Vegas and at a famous chefs restaurant so fine we can get over the price, however, coming out with a bucket that is barely to if even HALF full and barely smothered with toppings when ... On the video where y'all promoted this plate it was a completely full gooey mess ... Was a huge disappointment . Guy Fieri, if for some reason you decide to browse through yelp and read this comment, please note that I am not tryin to criticize you or your menu however as a chef and foodie yourself you need to know that your false advertisement of this bucket is cheating people out of their time and money and for a foodie I feel as if that's a cardinal sin.

The food here is HEAVY  and GREASY.  The platters look huge when the server brings them.
I had the ""Mayor of Flavortown"" burger.  It  had pastrami on it. It also had coleslaw and some sort of deep fried onion and somewhere down at the bottom an overcooked beef patty. They allow the grease from the patty to soak into the bottom bun, yuk, instead of properly draining the burger.   The menu said swiss cheese also, but if it was in that gelatinous mess, it had no flavor. 

These are not hamburgers, these are some monster creation, flavorless concoctions of garbage, with a garnish of overcooked beef and a grease filled bun.

When I have a burger, I want to taste the beef.  Sorry to have to write this I was expecting better.

I asked for Balsamic Vinegar and oil for the salad.  They brought them mixed together so it was impossible to get the mix of oil and vinegar that I liked.  Also, if they paid a dollar a gallon for that vinegar, they overpaid.  It was HARSH.

The thing is, if he did, he surely got better service being a VIP. The waitstaff here are like the Walking Dead. They don't seem to have a pulse, are lethargic in their service and can barely be bothered to get you a coffee. The sound of their feet quiet literally dragging across the floor in a slow shuffle is hardly music to any diners ears. With the exception of the host staff and hot lesbian table runner, this place exudes a total too cool for school attitude that translates into a lackluster dining experience.

The food: quite frankly, Robert Irvine would have a field day here. I am 99% sure my breakfast potatoes were frozen and the accompanying onions were a weird gray color, the peppers limp and wilted. This from a TV personality that takes us around the country sampling fresh, unctuous, decadent dishes from our favorite greasy spoons? Something is not quite right -- the food doesn't represent the name on the marquee leading me to believe that perhaps it is just that -- a famous name slapped onto a mediocre at best restaurant.

I personally have never been adventurous enough to eat this until now. I really cant even imagine at what point in time someone was digging around in the dirt and unearthed something that looks like a sophisticated cow patty and said to them selves; I am so going to add this to my fries for dinner!

Since I know it's good though, I ordered that and was content. I liked the concept of the Quad fries, too. Really crunchy and good for those of us who like a little variety of all of the different kind of fries.
Service - slow as f. It was unclear who our server even was, since we had multiple people helping us, but whatever. Either way, they could step up their game in that arena.  And side note, I wish they served breakfast longer. I was dying to try the bacon biscuits (they have them advertised on their menu and I feel like I saw them somewhere else in some Vegas highlights magazine), so it was a bummer to not be able to try them.

Let me start with the staff. I get you have to put up with tourists, but guess what? We tip...and we review. Staff was lackluster. Smiles and a good attitude would be appreciated. 
We had to get up and go to the servers station to get silver wear because there wasn't enough settings on the table and the waitress didn't seem to care. 
The menus were missing pages. Some were missing drink menus, some were missing beer menus. 
Now for the food.
Mac and cheese bacon burger a huge hit. Shredded BBQ pork sandwich was so good the person in my group ate it all! Portions are no joke. One of us ordered the chopped Italian salad and said it had pickled crunchy veggies that were to die for. Hubby and I shared poutine with flat iron steak on top.
Have you ever had poutine? Do you know it is supposed to have gravy? Ours was served luke warm (probably because we were in a party of 9 and they brought out food all at once) and it may as well have been dry. Cheese curds were real but there weren't enough on there in my opinion. Steak was good.

This was our number one place to eat and I for one, won't come back. Our waters never got refilled. We had to ask about what other people were drinking ( there is a fish bowl type vessel you can get to save money if you are gonna order multiple drinks.)
Suggestions about the menu was never offered.
In fact I did my research before I went. I know they have a build your bloody Mary brunch bar. This should be mentioned by every server if for no other reason than to get people to order a bloody mary or to start the ball rolling on talking about your specialty drink selection instead of just saying, ""any drinks?""
It is my belief that our waitress figured out her tip was already in the bag due to our party of 9 so no effort was put out. We had to keep asking her to repeat what she was saying because she never bothered to raise her voice. We are a fun group that left totally deflated. Honey, you are young, pretty and working for tips. You might want to smile and try to engage your guests.

Dinner, went fairly early for a Vegas dinner crowd, no waiting at all. Wait staff and hostesses were polite and helpful.  Menu is perfect, easy to navigate, not a book of choices, just a select few of very good ones.

Started with the Vegas Fries, which were basically wedge french fries in some sort of batter that gave them a fantastic buffalo tender texture. Perfect blend of buffalo sauce and herbs and cooked to a fantastic crunchiness.  I really enjoyed it as an app, two of us finished the plate with no problem.

For dinner I had the Italian Cold Cut salad. Awesome to say the least.  It was a light salad tossed in a vinegar italian dressing. Great cuts of sausage found inside, along with olives, pepperoncini and other surprises. The best part of the dish though? Served in a bowl made of prosciutto and provolone (I believe it was provolone).  Fantastic, the perfect cross between filling and light.

Two days later we went back for breakfast.  I had the Maple bacon french toast, just as awesome as the dishes from the first trip!  Delicious (although just a touch overcooked) french toast, thick and crispy maple encrusted bacon, caramelized banana wedges. Outstanding.  To complete the dish, also included a watermelon gazpacho to cleanse the palate.

Overall very happy with the service and the food. I will most certainly be coming back on my next visit to Vegas!",Sj9wrHrlnt_pmrWit5RyWg,0,0,5,9DvfkNFokrH79ZG_NvYHwA

This time he's taking no prisoners -- well, no chefs -- because Chefs Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay should be quivering and quaking in their boots because, by far, Guy has the best burger in Vegas, especially with the BBQ Bourbon Sauce.

My wife, 11-year-old daughter, and I had an Italian themed day in Vegas. We  went to Mob Museum (Daughter thought one of the mobsters looked like Actor Robert DeNiro), Rode on a Gondola at the Venetian, went to a Gun Range, and topped it off by eating at the Italian's place Guy Fieri, who is aka Guido. 

We started with the Sashimi Won-Taco shareables. Awesome. My daughter wanted more --- all of us did.Then, my wife ordered the carne tacos, I ordered a burger and my daughter ordered the pork sandwich. All were awesome.The mixture of the fries were great! Though, I'd like a twist on the sauce, say, a kicked up Dill dipping sauce for the fries along with the standard ketchup. (Fryer Tuck eatery in Portland, OR had that sauce years ago with their wedge-like fries)

Unfortunately, we had a problem. The dessert. My wife and I loved the Monte Cristo dessert creation but my daughter had an allergic reaction. We had asked the waitress if there were any tree nuts in the dessert. She checked. The Kitchen told her no. (I wonder if peanut oil uses any tree nuts.)

But reaction was just like a reaction she had before with tree nuts. Her lips became swollen, throat itchy and bumps on her head. (Several hours past till she was okay again.)

The waitress immediately got the assistant manager involved. She was a super waitress, and he was a super man as a manager.

He went way above and beyond the call of duty --- he went to store across the way and purchased Benadyrl for my daughter! 

Wow, the assistant manager treated us as if we were Guy, his wife Lori and this had happened to one of Guy's sons Hunter or Ryder.

The manager comped us the $90 bill too! 

We left a nice tip for our waitress despite the incident because service and food were excellent.

We will definitely go back for not only the great food but the awesome customer service.

By the way, Guy seems so real and unpretentious like we're part of his family --- and now we witnessed how that attitude spilled over into the attitude of his staff.

Finally, here's a big and heartfelt thank you to Guy, his family and his wonderful staff for taking care of our daughter though it was an unfortunate incident, it made it more palatable for us even if was for the rest of the evening.

We wish Guy, his family and his staff much success with the new ""Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar""!

See you next time we're in Vegas! We will definitely be eating at ""Flavortown"" again!

By the way, Italians, Food, and Casinos go well together. Bada bing, Cha Ching!

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - This is what happens when you have a buffet breakfast and miss lunch.
I love my Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  Guy kinda cheated here reviewing his own place for the show.  

Atmosphere - Classic Guy style, big and bold.  A bar with great food.  
 
Food
  Drinks - A decent beer list and I went with a local beer, Joseph James Weize Guys's Hefeweizen.

  Dinner - The prices are on the high end for a meal but they big portions.  I had the Motley Que since was featured on his show.  Eating like a sandwich was challenging and gave in to the fork and knife.  The utensils were just sitting there doing nothing else.  Next time I will replace the fries they give you with crinkle cut fries.  My wife's fries looked awesome.  

Service - Our waitress failed on my wife's meal as she asked about the veggie burger and if it was gluten free.  The kitchen noticed the gluten free comments and actually came to the table, not the waitress.  I like that the cook came out as he knows how he preparing the food and detailed questions can be exchanged instead of a middle man, ie our waitress, being involved.  The cook told us that it had panko bread crumbs as a binder which makes the burger gluten.  He sent the waitress back to us so she could reorder.  The order was rushed and only came out a few minutes after our meal.  As team they kicked butt.  Easy mistake with the binder, but because the waitress added the gluten comments to the kitchen order my wife getting sick was avoided.  I forgot to mention they do have gluten free buns.

Future - I guess so, we ended up here the next morning as the Hash House was packed.  Figured 15 minute wait before this place opens was better than the wait there.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,21,21,5,6BxELT6zi_kBY39N6JVMvg

I ordered a Bloody Mary which you can pick different toppings for. My drink came out with none of the toppings I requested but instead had cucumber, jalapeños, peppers and pepperoni. When I told the server it wasn't what I ordered, she simply said, ""Oh, we are out of everything else."" Why wouldn't she have told me that when I ordered it or at least come to tell me before making it?? 

Then our food came out. My husband ordered the Mac and cheese burger and I ordered the original one that is very plain. Our burgers were only $2 different on price, but his had a ton of stuff on it?! Both of them were cooked very well done and were like dry hockey pucks. 

The service was mediocre at best. The server rarely came around to refill water and we were sitting outside in 96* heat. 

I have to say it was disappointing. If they can't keep up with their sections, they shouldn't give the servers so many tables so they are able to pay more attention and give better service to the ones they have.

Side note: It is extremely loud. It's possibly so loud that the servers couldn't hear what was being ordered and that's why there were so many other mistakes (I didn't mention all of them). If you want to have a conversation with your dining partners, don't come here or come when it's not busy!!

But let me say to Guy, the Veggie Burger was the worse I have ever eaten and that includes frozen. I ordered a side of coleslaw to put on it to help with the dryness. It was no help, I think the chickpeas and oats just swelled in my mouth. Basically the burger was flavorless and dry. 

Sorry Guy but I promise you, I was more disappointed than you could be because after reading the ingredients I was really looking forward to a great veggie burger.

A side of Mac and Cheese for my baby, ate one bite and didn't want it. Other kid places that have mac and cheese he love, and this is suppose to be good?
Not good for kids! No kids menu is offered at this place. too expensive to order for a kid or child and not worth it.

I remember getting the '68 Cajun Sandwich with the waffle fries. Wow, that was perfect. The way the cajun sauces just flavored everything. I also love the presentation, with everything on a wooden cutting board. The waffle fries were delicious. One of my friends told me I need to try their garlic fries next time. Definitely will. 

I was also really impressed with how attentive the service I've gotten here. Our waiter checked in with us pretty frequently -- probably about every 15-20 minutes.

Overall, I can say I like this place and I'll be back, but there isn't anything I've tried here that I *crave.* (Except maybe the fries.) So I think ultimately it depends on how long the wait is. We didn't have a wait, so our experience started off great -- but I've heard people who have waited over an hour to get a table. I'm not so sure I'd be happy with the experience if I had to wait that long. 

They do have both indoor and outdoor seating though. So if you like people watching, you could always grab an outdoor seat.

P.S. This location is part of The Linq building, which is part of Total Rewards. So if there's a massive line and you want to skip the line, just go find yourself a new friend with Diamond status or higher with Total Rewards.

Upon arrival, I sat at the bar and was tended to by ""Mike,"" who I would consider inept at best or else just plain rude. Either way, it was a start to a lackluster visit. 

Caesars emailed me a coupon for a free beer which I tried to redeem. Even though the codes and terms were clearly on it, Mike had no clue, and made me wait over 15 minutes before I finally told him to just charge me for the beer as I was sick of waiting.

Next I ordered a 68 Cajun sandwich. I have enjoyed this at other locations, and know what to expect. Mike then demanded that I open a tab. I indicated that this would be all I wanted, but Mike refused to allow me to just pay for what I ordered. He claimed it was policy. I admittedly snarked back at this but begrudgingly capitulated. I would have just been annoyed if it wasn't for the fact that an attractive young lady sat next to me, ordered and he gave her the option of opening a tab or not...

Next up came my sandwich. I was heartbroken. The 68 is a chicken and andouille sandwich with onions peppers and celery in a butter/hot sauce served along with a melange of fries. Said fries tasted lukewarm as if sitting under a heatlamp for a while. The hoagie roll would not cut in half due to being rubbery. The celery was cut the long way making it hard to chew through. instead of the buttery sauce the sandwich was filled with straight hot sauce. And perhaps most offensive, the chicken tasted as if it were frozen in advance and microwaved, rubbery and tasteless.

I had high hopes for Guy's college hometown joint, but was totally disappointed. My advice, go to the White Castle across the street, sure they use frozen patties, but at least you know what to expect.",bQnJ3tfF5TgLlc__SD390w,1,0,1,YV_FDl5DXVwX3zRCZ_53KQ

I originally ordered the Big Dipper sandwich and they were out of the meat!!!  I was shocked to say the least!!!  I ended up ordering the original smash burger and it was disappointing.  Really sweet and the onion ring wasn't crunchy at all.  Kind of mushy.  Then the fries had a sweet seasoning on them as well which didn't taste that good.  They had flavor, but just too sweet.  I did like how there was a variety of different types of fries.  That was the only cool thing.  It also had sweet pickles on it which made the sweetness on overload.  I think dill would be a better choice.  Then my husband had the brisket nachos.  Nothing special whatsoever!  They were kind of a joke.  A 5 year old could make them.  Horrible, and didn't even have good flavor.  Margarita was fair at best...definitely not worth $12.50 for a house drink, and my husbands $11.00 house Chardonnay was fair as well.

It was super fresh and tasty. The gravy was greasy and bland, the eggs were average, the chicken fried bacon was gross. The bacon slice was very thick and not cooked crisp so it was very tough and chewy. The coating was coming off and wasn't very flavorful either. On top of that you only get one slice of bacon.

After such an event, a greasy delicious burger at Guy Fieri's seemed like a good fit. I guess it barely lived up to what we expected. 

I'll start by saying there are better burgers in Vegas. Those better burgers are also in the same price range or less expensive. You are paying for the name here. It felt slightly trashy when we walked in, but fit what I expected. We got the famous mac and cheese bacon burger with trash can pork nachos and tried some of a friend's mai tai like drink. The pork in the nachos were very fatty and cut into large chunks. It did have good flavor with the cheese sauce and BBQ sauce. The chips stayed crisp despite being smothered. It was pretty good. The burger was actually relatively good too. The pickles were cut thin and the burger was cooked very well (without the waitress asking how we wanted it). He bacon was soggy though and that's not good. It was good but not great or anything to write home about. The drink was subpar, but after an amazing cocktail crawl I didn't expect it to be great.

I'd say overall, 3 stars. Don't avoid it if the above sounds good to you, but if you are looking for a good burger, I'd recommend other places over this.

5837943,2017-11-19,3,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Diane and I ventured here for the first time, and arrived at just the right moment to be seated on arrival: about 5:30 p.m. on a Tuesday.  Just 15 minutes later all booths were taken, and at 6:15 p.m. easily 50 people were milling at the entrance seeking admission.

I began with a Side Caesar Salad, although no starter was at all necessary.  If I had been with a larger group I would have ordered the Trash Can Nachos anyway, because I have had them at El Burro Borracho in Laughlin, and they are flavorful indeed.  But we were attending the Mat Franco magic show right after dinner, and I knew that the inevitable plentiful leftovers would just go to waste.  So I ordered a Side Caesar instead, which was a very tasty rendition of a classic Caesar Salad, including plenty of vibrant creamy Caesar Dressing and large croutons.

My The Original Ringer Burger with added pastrami sported a crispy Rojo Onion Ring, a hint of tangy Bourbon Brown Sugar Sauce, Super Melty Cheese in addition to Cheddar Cheese, lettuce, tomato slices, onions, pickle chips, and Donkey Sauce.  I don't know the ingredients of Bourbon Brown Sugar Sauce, Donkey Sauce, or Super Melty Cheese, but they sure added punch and creaminess to the 1/2-lb. burger, so that I knew I was in Flavor Town.  I asked for and received copious amounts of ketchup to add yet another element beneath the dome of the enjoyable Garlic-Buttered Brioche Bun.  Cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, this was an excellent, very tasty burger, with Guy Fieri's touch quite evident in the recipe and seasoning!  

Though quite expensive, all burgers here come with an ample amount of Quad Fries, which is another conversation piece in itself.  In a silver container sit four types of fried potatoes: Waffle Fries, Skinny Fries, Crinkle Fries, and Sidewinders that look like twisted ear lobes.  This was an interesting combination.  All varieties presented were good accompaniments for my burger, and the Sidewinders packed some extra heat, like possibly a Cajun spice.       

Diane enjoyed her Mac-N-Cheese Burger, which featured Provolone, Pepper Jack, and American Cheese.  The Mac-N-Cheese was smooth, creamy, and mellow--not spicy.  I know, because I sampled it.

Our booth had very comfortable leathery seating with a rustic, distressed wood table top in a nice casual atmosphere on the northwestern edge of The LINQ Hotel & Casino.  But it was cold inside the restaurant on this November day.  Service by Jose was very good and attentive, and our food came out of the kitchen fast, with the salad first, just as I wished.  Our assistant server one time mistakenly poured Iced Tea into my empty water glass, but the error was immediately caught and quickly corrected.

When ravenous for a delicious flavor-packed burger we will surely be back for more of the same.

Its basically 4 mini tacos from the appetizers. They were good but just needed a little bit more flavor. I thought if they added 1 more taco then it would be worth spending $14 for it. The sashimi was fresh and the shells are a soft crisp. They broke apart pretty easily. Also tried the chicken wraps. Its only enough for 3 people. They give you only 3 pieces of lettuce and assorted chicken. Its ground chicken, skewered chicken and chicken egg rolls. My friends had a regular burger and and a turkey burger. Both dishes came with 3 or 4 assorted fries. It had good sized portions.

For a drink, I got the Java Guava. Really good. It had a little spice to it. It came with a jalapeno on the side. Dessert, we ordered a simple mint chocolate chip ice cream with oreos. Nothing too special. It was just drizzled in fudge and oreos. Also a good portion. Its enough for 3-4 people.

We tried the Mac n Cheese Burger with the Mac n Cheese being the only remarkable thing about the burger. The Mac did taste better than anything I've been able to make at home. 

We also tried the 67 Cajun Chicken sandwich which had horribly dried out chicken (as if was 2230 hours it may have been leftovers from the swing shift). It came with a sauce that helped with the dryness but it was still a very disappointing sandwich. 

Only saving grace was the Triple T fries. Truffles Truffles and more Truffles as the menu described. They were thinly sliced fries perfectly fried, crispy and seasoned; as my Fiancé described them ""OMFG these are the best fries I've ever had"" I did have to agree.

Our waiter explained after our ordering  it was his time to go home and passed us off to another. Our server then spent 30 mins at the bar doing prep work and that was the last we saw of anyone till I finally got up grabbed the first person I saw and asked for our bill. 

We had to wait 20 minutes for a table as they refused to give us a reservation (their policy I'm guessing to have people lined up outside to make them look popular/ busy) there were empty tables every where when we sat but we were given a two top that didn't have room for all our food. Think of the user experience that late at night and give them a real table for heavens sake.

LOCATION: It's located in the LINQ, which you can access from the strip or if you park you have to go through the Casino towards the back of the hotel.  

WAIT: We came on a Saturday morning around 10:30am and there was no wait! There is a lot of seating at the bar, in the restaurant and outside.  

ATMOSPHERE: Lots of TVs and general casual, fun atmosphere.  It definitely feels like a diner/bar restaurant.

FOOD: I got 2 things here and both were good, breakfast items.

CHICKEN BACON BISCUITS AND GRAVY - it comes with scrambled eggs but we changed it to poached and it was a great idea, the ooze on the egg yolk was on point.  We were a little confused at first because we didnt see any chicken.  It turns out the meat is actually one large thick piece of bacon that is covered in fried chicken skin.  It was very good, not overly salty and tasty.  The biscuits are big (reminded me of hash house) and the gravy wasn't too overwhelming.  They give you more on the side if you need extra gravy.  Overall a solid dish shareable between 2 people.

BREAKFAST BURRITO - also shareable as it's pretty large.  Comes with fresh tortilla chips and guac all taste freshly made.  The burrito is a quesarrito so the outside tortilla is a quesadilla itself, which is amazing.  Lots of filling inside, very tasty and not that spicy despite having chorizo.  Also a great option if you're in the mood for a breakfast burrito.

This pub puts a spin in your classic American burger and fries joint. If you're familiar with the show, Diner's, Drive ins, and Dives, you will find a lot of resemblance from triple D into the restaurant such as the atmosphere, the decoration, and even the entrée names on the menu.

To start things off, they have a lot of wines, mixed cocktails, and plenty of beers on tap. I suggest you try some of the cocktails they have. They also have a couple of appetizers such as lettuce wraps, spinach dip, and tacos. 

For the entrees, their specialty revolves around their burgers, I suggest you try the original ringer burger, a burger with a friend onion ring inside. Another burger I would suggest is the mc n cheese burger. They also added steaks to their menu and they do have quite a few choices in cuts. I think what makes this place stand out is their Vegas style fries. A vegas style fries is basically 4-5 different cuts of French fries (straight, crinkled, wedges, waffle, and curly). I urge you to try it as it is delicious and different.

Boy, am I glad we went!

We had a fairly large group of 11 people so we put our name in, only 30 minutes later I got a text telling us to gather for seating.
We were sat outside at a nice table with plenty of room.

Our waitress was excellent from beginning to end, getting all our orders right and the food all arrived at the same time so no one was sitting there without food. She even brought me a complimentary tequila shot as it was obvious from our matching T-shirts that we were in Vegas for my 50th birthday.

The food was awesome and the portions were monstrous! I couldn't finish my burger, it was just so huge.

Highly recommend this place; it was fantastic from start to finish. I will definitely go back the next time we're in Las Vegas.

When our group chose this restaurant we were skeptical but starving so we took a chance. We all LOVED it!!! All the food we ordered was amazing. Great drinks! The service was awesome! The server brought me the wrong dish and when I pointed it out she was very apologetic and the meal I originally ordered was at our table within a few minutes. The manager came out and apologized. They left the food I didn't order at the table so our group could eat it. The manager gave me a free beer. The way it was handled was very impressive!

This place had only been opened couple weeks when i went and was overpacked.  From the moment you walk in, you see Guy's portrait and books to remind you of where you are.  But it's the little touches that makes this place unique.  Napkins themed with spanish Dia de Muertos art to big wooden clipboard menus.  It's different with a unique touch of style

The food is out of bounds as you might expect.  Big burgers to giant onion rings served on a metal pipe rack.  The cocktails did not dissapoint and i suggest you try some of them.  The star of the night was their peperoni wrapped breadstick fondue.  I ordered their champion Mac n Cheese burger and it was huge!  burger was decent but the meat could have been seasoned better.  Finally we ended up sharing the recommended fried ice cream sundae, which is a masterpiece.

Our server was super nice, happy and so quick with our drinks.
I ordered the Original Ringer Burger (19.50) and my husband ordered the  Buffalo Wings (16.50).
The burger was definitely the best burger I have ever eaten, and I ate the entire thing, including the fries, which were seasoned with a bit of a spicy seasoning. The burger was so juicy, full of flavor, and toppings were not used sparingly. Messy to eat, but my goodness....so delish. My husband loved the wings...said he's never had anything like them...and he's a wing nut!  :) 
We went back again the next evening, and I tried the Steak sandwich, and my husband had the Mac and Cheese Burger (21.50). I wasn't as impressed with the steak sandwich, as I was with the burger I had the night before. My husband totally loved his burger!

5915239,2015-01-02,8,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I was honestly a little skeptical on taking another trip to flavortown. My first visit was at Tex Wasabi in Cali and was bummed about the trip. We just so happened to be famished from all of the running around that the NASCAR fan week had us do so needless to say that we were ready to head in for a refuel (silly pun). 

For starters we ordered the Triple T fries
They weren't kidding around with the description. This dish was LOADED with truffle essence! To my surprise the Gouda cheese (which I am not a fan of; sorry it an Asian thing) that topped the fries did not overpower the dish but gave it a nice gooey accent. Good Job Guy!

For the main event I ordered the ""Mayor of Flavortown"" 
A HUGE patty (overkill on the meat to bun ratio) topped with pastrami and all of the fixins on a pretzel bun! Think of it as Sammy's Pastrami burger's 6' tall dressed dressed up Sasquatch of a cousin.  
I cheated and got a side of Bourbon BBQ sauce to slather on this monster. The Bourbon burn really comes through giving it a nice burn to accompany the tang. It was a prefect add-on for the burger. Sorry Guy, The burger was good the way your created it BUT BBQ Sauce makes everything better..

The burger was well put together, most importantly; it could be eaten like a burger. Too often when you get giant burgers, they don't hold up well and you end up having to fork and knife it. To me this kills the ""burger"" experience so this is why I bring it up...    
The burger was also served with a ""small"" side of the quad fries; aptly named for the location and the 4 kinds of fries...This was overkill as we had more than half of our 3T fries.. 

Don't balk at the $18/17 price tag as you get more than your money's worth with this monstrosity of a sandwich. 


Service was decent; I value that our server gave us his honest opinions on the food and made real suggestions. 

The one knock if any that I will give this place is that all of the food was a bit on the salty side. No biggie for us BUT it is noticeable. We came for flavor town not the salt mine. 

Anyhow Guy's is near the top of my list of INSANE CHEAT MEALS 
Tips: 
Don't forget to bring your Total Rewards players card; it will save you a dollar on everything you order.

We both agreed that this was a overly expensive burger for its quality.

The fries that came with the burger were a joke, they were probably worse than McDonald's, and came with a ketchup-like (which was probably just ketchup) sauce.

We ended up being quite happy that there was a wait for restaurant seating on a recent September Saturday morning.  Hungry, we opted to check out the bar, and got VERY lucky when a couple got up and left, vacating the perfect comfy spot for us.  Honestly, this was the most comfortable bar stool I've ever sat in! We settled in and connected with new friends (they even let us try their Sweet Tea giant drink.  (way better than I would have thought, and surprisingly not too sweet!).  For around $35 you can get a giant fishbowl full of about 5 drinks that includes a free t-shirt.  Not a bad deal! We even watched them walk vs. stumble out later.  Kudos new friends!

However still breakfast to us, we opted to go a little easier than that...very good regular iced tea for me, and a couple brews for Husband.  Later I added a  ""Lemon Drop...Not"", which was very good. Hungry, we had to start with the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers. (after I presented our Bartender with my Total Rewards card to save a buck per item).  Good thing we had already ordered our mains before this arrived, or we might have been fine with just these.  Huge, majorly rich, and totally off the hook!  Where else would you find pepperoni wrapped breadsticks with a cheese fondue with sausage, tomato and basil in it?  With a kicker of pepperoncini to cut through the richness? NO where else...  Thanks Guy!

Our Bartender was so awesome that she saved our leftover fondue for future fry-dipping...wise gal...loved her and her hard-working cohorts!  Husband's '67 Cajun Sandwich was flavor-town indeed!  I know because of the small taste that he was willing to part with. He did more (slightly) willingly share his trio of fries with chipotle ketchup.  Yum to all of them!  

Meanwhile I was chowing down on The General's Wings.  As good as these were, they were wayyy sweet.  Would have loved to share them and have something else with them as well, but alas Husband doesn't do bones.  Loved that they were served with crushed wasabi peas, peanuts and sesame sticks to dip the sticky sweetness into.  The salty crunch was a perfect compliment.  I didn't waste a bit.  (you're welcome, Grandma in heaven).  

Needless to say we were way too full to even contemplate desserts.

Had an absolutely delightful time...UNTIL a big suit guy (the kind you see in the pit at a casino that is intimidating) come barging over to complain to the hard-working Bartenders that the area was ""messy"".  (our neighbors had JUST left...you know, the ones that had just spent all that money on two breakfasts and several drinks including the giant one?)

They poach the eggs by hand and not with those stupid egg poacher things, which makes a HUGE taste difference and I have a lot of respect for the care that goes into that. The real standouts of the meal were the Bloody Mary, and the crispy home fries. Oh. My. Goodness. If you get nothing else, GET THE HOME FRIES. 

Cons:  Other than that, the chili was meh, and I am SO thankful I got the cheese sauce on the side because it was basically super gloopy Mac and cheese sauce. I think it was sitting for a while because it had a film over the top. The steak, while almost cooked to perfection(almost is he key here, it was closer to M/MW rather than MR) was overseasoned. But that might be because I tend to be a purist about steaks. Salt, pepper, butter for such a good cut. The eggs, while poached very well, weren't seasoned. My husband's scrambled eggs weren't seasoned either. 

Overall, there are a lot of good restaurants in Vegas, I am glad I went but I probably won't come back.",ylcjsNkIGOtyYC8pUVxo8Q,1,1,3,YvgBEOoDsewXTDCmnmsz1w

5967213,2015-04-02,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"Decided to try this place out after seeing the long lines and stopping by Las Vegas this week.  The wait was not too bad, around 25 minutes.  The front staff was very courteous and friendly.  We obtained a table for 5 and were seated in a central location.  The ambiance was nice as the place has plenty of windows and you get a partial view of the strip and surrounding buildings.  I understand the place was busy, but our food did take 52 minutes to arrive to our table.  When I asked our server Gregory why the food was taking so long he said ""Its because you ordered appetizers"" as if I was being penalized for ordering 2 appetizers.  He didn't even apologize.  I asked for a manager who came by was very polite and apologized for the situation.  He offered free dessert, which I politely declined and stated I just really wanted to give him the feedback.  The server later gave us the check and asked if he could take our bill quickly so ""we didn't have to wait..."" with a sarcastic undertone.  Not nice... As far as the food goes, the appetizers we had were the cheese fries and the wings.  The fries were good, lots of cheese and flavor... The wings were just OK, and were a bit cold.  They have very little meat on them as they shave the bottom half of the wing to ""make it easier to eat"".  Some of the plates we ordered included the blue cheese burger and the original burger.  They were mediocre at best.  For a $20 burger, I was expecting something much better.  The meat was dry and the bun was brittle and didn't taste fresh.  At the end of the day there are plenty of restaurants in Las Vegas that deserve your time and money, and this clearly is not one of them.  I had high hopes coming into this place, but left disappointed.  Hopefully things change in the future.",fcav_O38ylstkFUfOIT8IQ,1,0,2,MiOMU2xOyuloRULDWTQV9g

Four of us went, enjoyed the mayor of flavortown burger, chicken Alfredo, mac-n-cheese burger and veggie burger. Lots of sharing by our group. All awesome tastes. 
Finished off with jack Daniels chocolate cake - oh my - got carded for the cake!! Taking a bite you can tell - lots of jack I the cake.  The cheesecake was also awesome. Both were huge. See pictures. 
Funny story - we rec our jack cake - tried the sauce.......weird flavor.....called our server, took it back to kitchen., turned out someone grabbed the horsey sauce rather than the White  chocolate sauce!! We all had a laugh, Jason the GM we out to apologized, the manger apologized, we all laughed and enjoyed the new cake - all tasty.

5971956,2015-11-21,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,I guess a lot of the review depends on the mood you are in lol. We went to Vegas for our grand daughters 21st birthday. We had a good size bunch (11) and got a table fairly quickly on a Sunday afternoon. Our waiter was amazing and we sat outside to listen to the music. My daughter asked aboout the bloody mary with the bacon and he got them for our table. My husband and I split the nachos ( best nachos in a long time!). Between us all we ordered 7 or 8 different dishes and they were all fantastic. Go here with a smile and I think you will leave with one too!,QopYSA6M04y-WZYO_HNsAA,0,0,4,G0IlRcnWmQvoz8f-V_HfaA

5981262,2015-06-29,0,HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,"I didn't go here expecting a gourmet food experience, but even without expectations it was a little disappointing.  

We tried the fondue dippers- pepperoni wrapped around pretzels- and I'm pretty sure it was cobbled together from store-bought ingredients, something most of us could make at home.  The Caesar salad had a massive crouton that couldn't be cut even with a steak knife.  The brisket was good, though, and the drinks were decent. 

The food wasn't that great, but I dropped the review by a couple stars purely because they were switching to a special ""late night"" menu on a Saturday at 10pm in Vegas.  I can understand a limited menu after midnight (though even that seems early in that city), but 10pm is just bizarre, and it made the whole seating/ordering process an unnecessarily nerve-wracking game of beat-the-clock.",TeGXmICxSDzjeN61MoNUDg,0,0,2,9ofwRVjAoOe_P6EYGCY5QA

Just a heads up that this place is always super busy so you might have to wait to get in. I came in on a weekday in the mid afternoon, even so, there was a 10 mins wait time. 

At my visit, I ordered a Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger, which was with crispy Applewood bacon, 6 cheese Mac n Cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cheese and donkey sauce on a garlic-buttered brioche bun..

I was particularly pleased with the spice on the burger. It was not overwhelmingly salty like most burgers I have had, this one was just perfect! The fries that came with had a variety of cuts (including crinkle cuts, curly fries and etc) and was perfectly seasoned. They were definitely some of the BEST fries I had ever had! 

The food was a bit pricey I found (especially for a restaurant and bar type of ambient) but it was expected as it is on the strip, and you're also paying for the big name of the owner/chef. 

Nevertheless, if you are in Vegas, you need to check this place out!",8Zzmpf9iTSHNoz3jnL2hmA,0,0,4,nIF6v6-oon9Mqhdc3YkmUA

WHY IN THE WORLD do you have customers wait...most silliest thing I have every experienced.

Food - had burger with Mac and cheese, French dip, 68 Cajun sandwich and Caesar salad.  Food was good and no complaints.

Reason for the one star is the horrible hostess staff...they should all be replaced immediately!  They were not engaging or excited to be working and it seemed like it was a chore to seat people. Just one example is that they seated a gentlemen who was in a wheelchair at a high top that has no support for him.  Thank god some patrons at the bar saw that and switched out chairs so he had a back support.",HDV3IxqCigmY6Kwj-ZJjiw,0,0,1,lnUQb9h-uQYfG4Yo4YaB1Q

They wouldn't even make eye contact.  Finally when I got someone's attention, that was the last time I was helped.  I got my one set of drinks and my food.
