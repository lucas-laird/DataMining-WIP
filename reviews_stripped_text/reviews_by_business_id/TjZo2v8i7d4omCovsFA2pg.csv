68657,2014-08-01,0,TjZo2v8i7d4omCovsFA2pg,Only one star because 0 stars isn't an option   I arrived late due to nightmare traffic on I-15 and nearly everything was closed. Despite my deeply held loathing for Papa John's (issues with them honoring their own coupons) I called them anyway to order two cheese pizzas for pickup. I was informed that I could wait 90 minutes for delivery but couldn't drive there and pick them up. Huh?  I was told its a safety issue. But it's perfectly safe to send drivers out at night?  Morons. They just confirmed everything I hate about Papa John's.  I've never wanted to see a company go out of business so badly as I do Papa John's.,M40Wx7Q3cxRe1nPQgd-OkA,0,0,1,Avck7cKzR3GlJmr-w4F15Q

Also, when I ordered, I gave them my credit card info and even included a tip.  They said they wouldn't charge me for the pizza but did anyway.

The pizza itself was very good.  Got the new Chicken Chipotle.  However, it's completely unacceptable to be almost 2 hours late with the pizza and then be charged for it when told you wouldn't be.

A few weeks ago, I ordered and a young, somewhat unkempt, but because she thought it was ""cool"" girl was at the register with her emo hair flying wildly out of her hat.  As both a customer and a former employer of teens in food labor, this was very disgusting and off putting for me and I really don't want to eat from someone who just handed me my food with straggly, wild hair everywhere.  I would have preferred the girl have a little more of a clean cut style, but she also wasn't necessarily unclean.  Just personally also disgusting to see people mutating their ears with those plug things.  The issue was just more of a management issue of teaching teens about proper work place hygiene in a kitchen.  

As everyone mentioned below, I sent a review through papa john's website to corporate only to get no response and when I went in today had the same exact girl with the same exact issue of ""cool"" scruffed up hair wildly bursting out of her ball cap....this also led me to see that no one was wearing gloves of any kind, nor hair nets.  I have always felt that the kitchen was decently ran and clean, but noticing an unkempt employee makes one glance further and my stomach is a little turned off.  

It would be nice if papa john responded to customer relations because they may have just lost a pizza a week customer for the last ten years.",WIu4IqktLQ6Qm46L5r5Baw,0,0,2,3b_hLz8d1jOPTAaRfR50hQ

1908084,2016-06-06,1,TjZo2v8i7d4omCovsFA2pg,"3460 E Sunset RD; Suite U, Las Vegas, NV 89120. (6-6-16) 
FUCKING NASTIEST EMPLOYEE I'VE EVER COME ACROSS & THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. Our company has ordered from Papa John's EVERY Monday for the past 6 months. Buying AT LEAST $30 worth every time.. UP TO even $70 sometimes! Today (6-6-16 @ 11:30AM) we ordered ONE pizza & wings for delivery. OUR TOTAL WAS BASICALLY $30. ($29.80) I wrote in the ""comments"" to please bring change, as my employer was paying cash & only had a $50 bill today. Someone called me from the store, informed me the drivers are not allowed to carry more than $20 change. Understandable. So, while on the phone I offered to pay with an AMEX. The guy couldn't find the manual entry screen or was having SOME kind of difficulty (& it sure as hell WASN'T because of a busy store) but ended up placing me on hold. FOR 6 minutes!!!!!!!!! I hung up & called back. He answered right away. FRUSTRATED-- but I asked him NICELY to put the order through & instead, I would come in with the $50 bill & CARRY OUT THE ORDER. He thanked me (mercifully) & said he would put the order through. GREAT, AWESOME, NO BIG DEAL. They're right down the road.... SO I gave them 10-15 mins to make the small order & took my own time FROM BEING AT WORK & hopped in my car to get lunch for the office. I show up, walk inside. NO ONE TO BE SEEN. NOT ONE SOUL. Found it odd, but I wait patiently. 3 minutes goes by-- I AM STANDING LIKE AN IDIOT at the front. I am pretty much STARING AT my order, (& THE ONLY ONE) on the rack. NO greeting yet, still. NO ""Hello!"", NO ""Be right there!"", NO ""Just one moment!"" NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHATSOEVER that I had stepped foot into the store... for now, 5 minutes. SO I did a soft whistle. (Doubted it, but MAYBE someone really hadn't seen me??) I hear from the back office ""Hold on, just a sec!"" ????? Didn't really have a choice..... So I waited at the front register for someone to emerge. ANOTHER 3 minutes of silence goes by. SO NOW, I HAVE BEEN SITTING AT THE FRONT FOR ABOUT 10mins (watching our pizza & wings getting cold on the rack) & that I am away from work. A guy pops out from the back office. I would call him a gentleman, but he wasn't. He was dirty. NASTY. GROSS. Hair, nails, uniform, appearance, teeth. Everything about him; DISGUSTING. He says to me ""You have a pick up?"". (Regrettably at this point) I replied ""Yes."" He sees the $50 I had waiting with me, in my hand. ""Oh we can't-- break that, like.. we're not allowed to break that."" I STARED AT HIM IN AWE. WHAT. IS. HAPPENING. How hard does this have to BE?! I had just spoke with a male maybe 12 minutes (plus my wait time IN STORE) EARLIER. So, I asked him, ""Are YOU the person I just talked to on the phone?"" He claimed ""No, that was my driver..."". I said "" I JUST TOLD SOMEONE that I would be here in 10-15mins with a $50 bill to carry this out, & he said ok."" He repeated AGAIN that he wasn't going to/can't break the bill. ALL I COULD DO WAS STARE. I CANNOT GET A GRIP ON THIS. I understand drivers not being able to carry change over $20....  BUT THE FUCKING STORE?!? Papa John's Pizza is worth 600 MILLION dollars.
600.
MILLION.
DOLLARS.
& HE CAN'T BREAK A $50 BILL FOR A $30 ORDER from the register?!??!?!?!??!?!??!?!?!
Fucking ridiculous. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER, AGAIN WILL I GIVE OR LET ANYONE ELSE I KNOW GIVE ONE DOLLAR TO PAPA JOHN'S AGAIN. WORD OF MOUTH IS POWERFUL. 
If I was a scumbag, I could have easily TAKEN MY ORDER along with some other items by the time he came out from doing WHATEVER he was doing back there.
