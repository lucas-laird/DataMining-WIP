When we first went there, we weren't sure how the food would be, but we were extremely happy with the quality & amount of food, and the pricing was great, too. You can get several dinner specials for just $7.95 +tax, which comes with a drink, soup, and an egg roll.

The main reason I'm so impressed with Mr. Chop Chop, though, is that when my other half went in the other night to pick up dinner, the owner pointed out that we were just in the day before. He mentioned that I wasn't feeling well, and the owner told him to wait a moment. She went in the back and made me a bowl of vegetable soup from scratch. We go to a lot of restaurants on a regular basis, but none of them have ever done that for us. 

Mr. Chop Chop is fantastic all around. Go there, you won't be disappointed. :)",Jmlqb5UYfygtUXugrpywjg,1,0,5,eX2ueK3EYnFpzFdec_GAEw

The delivery guys have always been very nice to me and their food has never done me wrong! I have ordered so many different things from here after knowing and trusting the quality of their food. Sometimes quality can be forgotten when it's delivery but this is never an issue with Mr. Chop Chop. I have tried most of their curries (my favorite being the yellow curry), their pad thai which was pretty tasty with a little spice, orange chicken and egg rolls. 

What I enjoy the most about this restaurant is that all the ingredients taste fresh! However, with some dishes I believe they go a little to easy on the spices. Maybe they've had complaints with spiciness from other customers but as far as I'm concerned if you can't handle heat then don't order these kinds of dishes.

New management and staff took over in mid-January: wish they'd changed the restaurant name so reviews for previous ownership would be separate. However, keeping the name did allow them to inherit the constant flow of phone orders and takeout from regulars.

POK TAK: Seafood lemongrass soup with shrimp, mussel, squid, catfish, red onion, basil and mushroom infused with lemongrass, lime leaves, and galangal.  Shared a hotpot among four diners, everyone enjoyed this. 
YEN TA FO NOODLE SOUP: Noodles with fish ball, white mushroom shrimp, squid, fried tofu, spinach with Thai triple delight soup topped with fried wontons and cilantro. BF really liked this, the light citrusy broth was reminiscent of an Asian take on gazpacho.
CRAB FRIED RICE memorable, ample amounts of crab, huge portion. BBQ pork version is not nearly as good. Either can be made Thai-style, adding extra veggies and chili sauce. 
PANANG CURRY and GREEN CURRY were both solid, appreciate that they offer brown rice instead of white without an upcharge. 
DRUNKEN NOODLES: SO tasty! Generous portion of veggies, less noodles than other versions but palpable freshness. I inhaled this!
PORK & VEGGIE EGG FOO YUNG: Kind of an Americanized version, in that it's a gigantic portion and the egg is actually really crispy. Very vegetable-heavy (in a good way!), would get the seafood version to try next time.

I would definitely recommend this place for a cheap, but tasty, meal. 

The only things (which aren't even that major) keeping them from getting 5 stars is that they serve Mr. Pibb in place of Dr. Pepper after being asked which of the two are available (both are listen on the menu) and sometimes being a little untidy (not having gotten to clean the tables yet after customers leave - nothing major in terms of cleanliness).",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,4,lL7UP6OCh-VtMrs8KqnHqA

The big draw for this Thai food is the consistent use of fresh ingredients--most of the dishes are made up of crisp vegetables full of flavor (fresh mushrooms everyone! -- You'd think that would be a standard in food everywhere, but other Vegas places do love a canned mushroom).

The best dishes here are the curry dishes and the Tom Yum soups.  If you're a Tom Yum fan, Mr. Chop Chop serves up a delicious hot and sour soup chock full of vegetables.  And you can't go wrong with the curry dishes.  Each one I've ordered is spicy and tasty and delicious.

There are some missteps around the menu as well.  The papaya salad was sadly bland and the Pad See Ew was disappointing.  It makes it hard to want to test out new dishes.

Bottom line: 3 stars for the fresh ingredients, excellent curry dishes, and Tom Yum soup.  Add in half a star for the personal customer service.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,1,3,wyy1lXkpYoDCB-9aY4gxDg

The shop is within walking distance from our house and we must have passed 1000 times without entering due to the external design. But after noticing the local firefighters getting their dinner there daily we figured we'd give it a shot.
The food is mostly hand made and the Pom fish commented about below is now on the menu as a special. And.....its tasty. The cook will make you anything you'd like if you ask. I like the Tom Ka soup with chix, very spicy.
They are always accommodating and the prices are very reasonable.

After all, what kind of authenticity could I expect from a place with such a silly name? Who is this Mr. Chop Chop, and is he the mascot of the restaurant? 

Well, OBVIOUSLY I was a fool. A silly, misguided fool! Whoever Mr. Chop Chop is, I'd definitely want to be his friend. 

We've ordered from them twice and its been consistently flavorful and fast. The boy always gets a red curry when we have thai, and the first time he got a Mongolian beef that he enjoyed. Last time we ordered the curry, spicy mint pork, chicken satay, tom yum kai and crab rangoon. The rangoon was fat with cream cheese and a bit of crab, and the wontons were light and crispy. The curry was spicy and had lots of vegetables with juicy bits of chicken. 

I love tom yum kai and use it as my gauge, and their's was great. It had a definite home-made feel, with big chunks of galangal and lemongrass. The chicken was tender and definitely a lot fresher than some of the other places I've tried. They put strips of jalapeno into the soup and it was definitely spicy! 

The satay came with a peanut sauce and some sweet vinegar pickles that were delicious! A great compliment to the rich peanut sauce. 

The pork was also good, with a medley of vegetables and lots of chunks of fresh garlic. The meat was flavorful without being dense or overly porky, and the mint was a great addition. It made the whole dish taste lighter, fresher and more balanced. 

The delivery was relatively quick, within an hour, and we were very satisfied with the spice level. Most places go easy on it doubting our abilities as caucasians, leaving me to dump chili sauce into it. That was definitely not the case here, my first bite of the tom yum kai was a  shock. So spicy! It was great! I appreciate their generosity with the spice. 

We only got one rice with the meal, but it was enough for the meal. I may need to make a fresh batch for the leftovers, of which there is plenty. We got a ton of food for about $40 with enough for another meal. If we hadn't been so enthusiastic about trying things, we probably could have gotten a third meal out of it.

We placed a large order to feed six and were told that delivery would be a one hour affair. With time to kill, there were a few beers left and the film ""Tower Heist"" was airing on television. If you've ever seen ""Tower Heist"", capped by brilliant penmanship and epic performances from Ben Stiller and Casey Affleck, then you know that such a cinematic gem can only build your appetite for the finest Asian cuisine, because you are literally starving for quality after watching such schlock. Enter Mr. Chop Chop, not one, but two hours later.

The crab rangoons looked like they were previously used as suppositories in a subsidized retirement community. Usually having no crabs in Vegas is a good thing, unless you're expecting it in your food as opposed to your nether region. I could not surmise a more pathetic excuse for this staple of Ameri-Asian cuisine than what revealed itself in those styrofoam containers. Suffice to say, they are rotting in a dumpster somewhere in the bowels of the Wynn property.

The chicken chow mein noodles tasted as if God decided that sodium no longer had a place on the table of periodic elements. Consider the effect on our ecosystem if this were the case. All sea life would perish, average blood pressure would drop, and Mr. Chop Chop's cooking would still be available to damn civilization. I made it through about five bites before wisely placing the carton in the $25 incidental refrigerator we had delivered to the room. Some poor sap was going to get drunk later and eat that. But I knew it wouldn't be me. 

In the aftermath of eating, everyone in the group was writhing in pain. There was no satisfaction on the miserable faces of my companions. People would disappear randomly in 20 minute intervals and I can only imagine that this was time spent slumped over the toilet in a desperate attempt to void our bodies of the filth that was Mr. Chop Chop's plague. Ipecac syrup would have tasted like holy ambrosia at that point. 

To those that wrote positive reviews, I have two theories. One is that you have personal ties to the restaurant, which is totally fine. People come onto Yelp all the time to defend their establishments, however fruitless and absurd it may be. The second theory is that you've never left the desert, nor eaten any other Asian cuisine in your life. I'm not here to knock you down or criticize your taste. Many find comfort in bland, diarrhea-inducing food to ""flush"" themselves, and I respect that. This beef is between me and Mr. Chop Chop. And should this beef ever resolve itself, it certainly won't be in any dish served by this restaurant in the lonesome outskirts of the Las Vegas strip.",6cKwdGLxZskZ6Yd6kSkNAg,2,2,1,QgG7j6vMB0aJ_KWVktjbUg

After a quick overview of previous reviews my son and I decided this looked like a good place to dine for the evening. BOY WERE WE WRONG. Upon entering you get a feeling that maybe you've chosen wrong. As we have eaten at many hole in the wall places and they were fabulous, we said to never judge a book by it's cover. The service was poor and I think that was due to the fact the owners employ both of their sons ages 13 and 15. I don't like to speak ill about children so this is more or less to the choice of their parents. Upon entering we were not greeted and seated. We went up to the take out counter, grabbed a menu and asked our server/bus boy who was cleaning tables, where we should sit. He stated, ""Oh, well, any where but that table because I haven't cleaned it yet.""

 After cleaning the rest of the tables he came to take our drink order. It was clear the boy had no training. He didn't know all of what was on the menu or what the dishes were made up of....sad. We ordered an appetizer of wontons, Singapore noodles and Yellow Curry Cream Sauce Shrimp. Let me tell you this is absolutely the worst tasting Asian food I have ever tried to eat. When the wontons came, I kid you not, there was less than a quarter size filling in each. Some of them even had less than a wonton strip full of filling! When I brought the boy server to the table to address it and had it taken back to the kitchen to show the chef he told me that sometimes, depending on who makes them, they are less full. Really kid, that was ridiculous and a poor excuse. PHOTO IS ATTACHED!

As for the yellow ""cream sauce"" curry....it was not a cream sauce at all and definitely not as pictured on their menu. Photo is also attached. 

Sorry to say this but I was highly disappointed, will never return and absolutely would not recommend anyone choose this joint if you are looking for Authentic Thai or Chinese.",Fy9JxbJEdSXX-Aq-59aP6w,3,0,1,2H5EnHHJ06m5pGvgTW-SKg

You won't get fancy decor, it's away from the strip and in a run down mostly vacant strip center. I was a little reluctant eating here, but seeing this family working reminded me of myself working at my families Chinese restaurant years ago - when I was only 15 years old. 

Mr. Chop Chop is tiny place but their food is tasty, has generous portions and is reasonable. I ordered the fish cake appetizer (awesome dipping sauce), Chili paste delight with catfish and yellow curry chicken. 

Overall I was happy with the quality and taste here and would recommend Mr Chop Chop for lunch or dinner.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,2,1,4,YX0BLup7uqv1KmhvDo8bdA

4325126,2013-08-14,0,rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g,"Although there are several good Thai places near us (each with their own strengths & weaknesses), we order from Mr. Chop Chop frequently for delivery.  The food is always fresh and tasty. The delivery time is always 45 minutes plus though despite us being only down the street because there are always half a dozen orders ahead of ours--and yes, I know we are lazy to have them deliver when we only live 5 minutes down the street.  The food is definitely worth the wait though.

Mr. Chop Chop is my favorite Thai place because are **consistently** yummy and *SPICY*.   Also the family who runs the place is very nice.  Service is always friendly even when they are slammed.

If you love spicy food, this is the place for you. Most Thai places are hit and miss on the heat level. Even when I frequented other restaurants (to the point where they knew me), one order I would get would be perfect (very spicy) and then next time I would order it would be incredibly mild.  Not Mr. Chop Chop. If you say 6 out of 5 spicy, it will be always be 5-7 out of 5 spicy :). Unfortunately, my boyfriend  has been having problems with super spicy food lately, so we have been forced to tone it down and order only 4 or 5 out 5. It is still flavorful and enjoyable even at the lower heat levels.

Our normal order (these all get a rating of 10 out of 10):
+ Yellow Chicken Curry - YUMMY!
+ Spicy Mint Chicken- YUMMY!
+ Spicy Eggplant Tofu - Note on this one, somewhat frequently they run low on eggplant and you end up with way more tofu than eggplant :(. It's still yummy though.
+ Pad-see-ew Beef - VERY yummy but not the best I've had (there was one other restaurant that had the best pad-see-ew ever). I like that it's not greasy like most other Thai places though.
+ Pot stickers (chicken) - I love pot stickers so I may be biased. 

Other items we've tried:
+ Yellow Curry Cream Sauce - We didn't care for this. I haven't had it anywhere else so I don't know if it's just Chop Chop's or that we just plain don't like this (I think it's the latter).
+ General Tso's Chicken - It's a Chinese dish so I didn't expect it to be super great from a Thai restaurant, but it's good (better than when you order it from most Chinese restaurants). My  brother likes this dish, so that's why we ordered it a few times. I just don't care for sweetness that much though.

I think we have tried their Panang before, but I don't care for Panang that much in general and neither did the boyfriend, so we never ordered it again.",o3gVkrPnWxglKlwQIZF_-w,0,0,5,GkVuUzwn-XuA7tTPdhCM6w

4744350,2011-05-25,2,rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g,"The Tom Yum Goong here was good.  It had a great balance of hot and sour, along with generous portions of mushroom, tomato and shrimp.  At spice level 3 out of 5 my lips felt some fire, but my tongue didn't taste much heat.  With this being the first dish brought out, I felt that it was a strong start to the meal.  The other highlight of the night were the Chop Chop Original Thai-Style Chicken Wings.  The sauce was good; the chicken, not so much.

My palate and experience for Thai food is admitedly limited, since I always like to order Panang Curry and Pad See Ew whenever I'm at a Thai restaurant.  Due to that habit I've come to form my own expectations for these two dishes, and those expectations were not met at Mr. Chop Chop.  The Panang Curry had a sweet flavor, and the Pad See Ew tasted like noodles that were just heated up; not much flavor was present.

One thing that was different about this meal was that each dish came out on it's own, as if each dish was it's own course.  We were at the restaurant for two hours, and much of that time was spent eating.  Out of the five dishes we ordered, four of them were ordered at the same time at the beginning.  I don't know if they usually serve their food one dish at a time, but I was definitely expecting most of the food to come out together.  Two stars says it all: I've experienced better.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,5,2,2,VyOUVfxbO_aXcZl7dryg_w
5143830,2012-01-21,0,rdifwelsxkuUf-tw2O4o1g,"So, I recently got a take out order from Mr. Chop Chop.  A teenage boy was getting ready to put rice in the box when the box fell on the floor - the very dirty floor.  My mouth dropped when he picked it up and resumed filling it with rice.  I said ""Excuse me.   That box fell on the floor. Could you please get a new box for my rice?""  His response: ""Only the outside of the box touched the floor.  It is fine.""  He proceeded to fill the box with rice!!!  At that point, I told him that I would not take or pay for that container of rice.  He angrily responded ""Fine"" and finally gave me a new box.  

Their food is good, but I have been reluctant to go back since then.  I don't think this kids standards reflect the standards of the kitchen, but if he thinks using take out boxes from a dirty floor is okay, we just have standards of food safety/cleanliness that are quite different.",XlMviIjH0seNavS6pVy0ng,0,0,1,24vO65f2-YqIAKDSPRxG_A
