Run, walk, jog, drive, fly, and of course bring a friend to the newest cafe in Vegas. In the former Bronze Cafe spot inside The Center lies flavors that will make your tongue pop right out of your mouth!

Owners of MTO created this spot of love and the kindness matches the yummy flavors. I came here on opening day, well post soft opening, and they are getting the hang of things fast.
A smiling beauty greeted me and she answered all the questions I asked kindly.

Us plant based peeps always have a million questions and the options here are extremely vegan friendly! 

My eyes quickly were looking for the IG worthy Rainbow Latte but its not available yet. That's ok because I was craving an iced mocha, which is strange because I usually drink iced Doppio's. The iced almond milk mocha was not sweet and I'm pretty sure it is made from LaVazza coffee. Soooo yum. The small size was perfect. Yum.

I was also craving a juice or smoothie. My eyes locked on the PB&J smoothie with a default base of almond milk. PERFECT!
This smoothie...wow...once again I don't like sweets so an odd choice again...it is perfect. A party in my mouth a perfect balance. I couldn't stop. I had it half drank in a few pulls. Accompanied by intense brain freezes that were very worth it!

I wanted lunch to eat later today and so my eyes locked on a to go salad that looked amazing called the Habibi. It had all my favs but I don't like avocado anymore, weird I know, but I forgot to ask minus that.
When the salad came it was like Christmas morning opening that thing up. 
Why?!?!??!?!?!!??????????????
Because it is my favorite salad in the whole city. It is Quinoa Crunch Salad at MTO. I forgot to also say no dressing because I don't like dressing. Yes I am a weirdo. This salad doesn't need any, anyway. The edamame hummus is creamy and amazing. Oh and guess what? It came with a side of hot sauce. My bae is hot sauce. 

Please see my pics. I could literally write three reviews full and a book about how excited I am about this place and I was super excited to chat a little with the owner? today. He is beautiful inside and out. I think I spoke with him years ago at MTO, but it was nice to chat a little then ultimately reveal my fangirl status of MTO and my obsession with this salad. Heh.

Thank you for feeding more love to Las Vegas and I can't wait to visit again!!!!!!!!!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,7,6,5,qDkoNb144bgPanxOqMc47A

Love the smaller price tags too- very affordable, think $5 toasts and beverages, vegan items available.

The Bravo toast (avo, bacon, watermelon radish) and a hazelnut latte were my go-to for their first day. I'm champing at the bit for them to release the Rainbow Latte they've been promoting on social media, but it's definitely a place I see myself revisiting (for the PBJ one Elizabeth was raving about!) so not worries about that.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,14,4,T-vk_MxXKs-bCbJrOiA3jQ

Even though they have only been open just a couple a weeks, I expect them to be a staple downtown.",LtEPehYVThFVmsN3jFNjBw,0,0,5,0T7er2TOj8T-djPsLPzmUA
