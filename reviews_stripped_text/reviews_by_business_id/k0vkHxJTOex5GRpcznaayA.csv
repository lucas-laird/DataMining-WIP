I ordered a Bacon, Egg & Cheese McGriddle and specifically requested a round egg. Instead, I got a McGriddle with a fake ass jiggly-yellow thing that McDonald's calls an ""egg.""  I know most of the ""food"" that McDonald's serves is fake, but at least give me a real egg to make me feel a little better about eating here. Anyway, the McGriddle wasn't great, and it wasn't bad either. The pancake part was DENSE...you could probably use it to smack someone.

Hash browns were all right, and the apple pie was disappointing, no wonder they're always trying to get rid of it when you place an order.  I'm not expecting Marie Calendar's quality pie, but I don't remember the apple pies tasting so bland. I also tried half of their ""Egg"" McMuffin because a whole one probably would've made me barf from all the saltiness.",CP4WKLIlLcIVm6ov8umgdw,0,0,2,rxeGOeQfO7dULyhSRpcHNA

Still, I always seem to forget and give it another chance, but I had the worst fast food experience of my life here a few weeks ago. 

It was about 11:30 p.m. when I pulled into the drive-thru, with 4 cars ahead of me. I place my order and pull up a little bit. That was the last time I moved for the next 20 minutes. It is not an exaggeration. The drive-thru is set up so that there is absolutely no way you can get out of it once you're in it. I was trapped in this stupid drive-thru for what felt like an eternity, and I hadn't even paid.

When I finally get to the first window, there is nobody there. After about a minute the girl came scurrying in and had to ask me what I had ordered. Holy. Crap. (As a side note, cashier girl, if you ever read this, I'm sorry I was kind of rude to you. I felt pretty bad about it. It wasn't your fault.)

Anyway, after finally paying, we're stuck again. While I'm waiting, I can see the food window handing bags and taking them back from the car that's there currently. Great, they're messing up orders. The next car has the same situation.

I get up to the window and the guy hands me a bag that is very clearly not my food based on the size, but I checked anyway. Nope. I wait for him to come back and tell him, and he grabs the other bag that had been sitting there since before I even got to the window and hands me that one instead. No apology, nothing. He didn't even look inside either of the bags.

The worst part of all of it is that after this 30-minute journey, my fries were so cold. So, so cold. Hot McDonald's fries are the only reason to go to McDonald's! At that point, I just wanted to get as far away as possible from this place. 

It should never be so hard to get terrible food. I always go to McDonald's with hardly any expectation, but somehow this one always seems to surprise me. Wait through the light at 215 and go to Burger King instead if you've got a hankering for $1 burgers.",O60kMLO3IdqRkajj75DgBQ,1,0,1,7sVtHFIPsy2b_duTjJboJw

Sorry military folks - You are out of luck getting a discount here. I have tried asking if they do before - but have been told no. This last visit I tried to ask the Manager on Duty if they would be implementing such a policy in the forseeable future (very politely). Manager didn't even come to the window to talk to me, and just shook the head, then turned off and walked away. I felt that was kind of rude of a manager to not even speak to me, after asking nicely to do so!

Have to admit, I was disappointed with my last Drive Thru visit (happened about 2 weeks ago). During their busy lunch hours they will post a person outside to take orders. The young lass I ordered through, I specifically asked for no fries in the kiddy meal, and replace the fries with the apple slices (I was going to share the ones from my order with my child). She got the order right - but the staff fulfilling the order did not.

The problem with this place is that they consistently under fill their smoothies, and only the smoothies. Every single time. I've attached a picture with about 2/3 of an inch of empty space in the cup.  

Initially I thought this was due to their auto-fill system being set up that way, but if you go to other McDonald's they fill the cups up completely with the smoothies.  Not so here.  Either they have their machine set up incorrectly or its an effort to cut costs by management.  Under either situation its just not acceptable.",76xS0Vin4uT25XKaxbsvmQ,3,0,1,04L4_sPyBTGWfXfxpmbqrA

Because the sign stated ONLY CASH will be accepted due to the card machines not working.  After I walked into the restaurant to let a petite blonde worker know, she looked disgusted. I thought if you hate your job that much get an education, learn a trade or apply for a job you do like. I requested to speak to a manager since the business should be made aware of the signs. There was even a typo. In this age of spellcheck -seriously?! 

The shift manager wasn't wearing a nametag and neither was the irritated petite blonde. I stated the problem to the shift manager and was informed that the card machines do work, sometimes . This begs the question of why maintenance isn't the norm. She asked if I was ordering or not. I answered in the affirmative.  I  ordered and requested a Mocha Frappuccino which was replacing the medium drink in the 2 cheeseburger meal. I was charged extra but didn't go back since the Friday night crowd was in force. My order wasn't read back to me and it was my fault that I didn't bring it to the unconcerned manager's attention.( I was at home when I read the receipt.)

After having dinner on the Las Vegas Strip and catching Jubilee at the Flamingo, my wife and I decided to cap off date night with an ice cream cone and hot apple pie from McDonalds on the way home.

No dice.  Despite the long line at the drive thru, we were informed that the ice cream machine was down.  No problem, we thought, just give us our hot apple pies and we'll take a latte to share.

Now, the fact that the package the apple came in read ""Caution: HOT!"" led me to believe that the apple pie would actually be, you know, hot.  My handy dandy insta-read thermometer informs me that the actual temperature of my ""HOT!"" apple pie is actually 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  If I convert this temperature to Kelvin, THEN  it seems to be hot, but on both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales this seems to be sorely lacking.

C'mon guys.  It doesn't seem to much to ask that the ""HOT!"" apples pies at least be warmer than body temperature.

Yesterday, National Vanilla Ice Cream Day led me to this very Golden Arches. 

  The McDonald's cone of soft vanilla ice cream is a treat that brings me back to when I was a little kid in the late 1970s when my grandfather treated me to this ice cream in the Whitestone Expressway McDonald's  (Flushing, New York City). Somewhere along the way I grew tired of vanilla ice cream. This cone of soft vanilla ice cream that I celebrated on National Vanilla Ice Cream Day was the first in at twenty years. You know what? This soft vanilla ice cream in a cake cone tasted delicious and changed my negative opinion of vanilla ice cream onto a positive one. It is only $1.08 after tax and one of McDonald's best kept secrets. 

  It was more than vanilla ice cream that led me here. I had been hiking for hours up in Mount Charleston and was going to meet up with my brother. I was in the mood for quick, convenient, and inexpensive fast food. After hours of hiking in Mount Charleston my tired brain was in a state where McDonald's was as good as Bachi Burger. Before participating in National Vanilla Ice Cream Day, I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese meal that came out to around $6.40. After hours of hiking in the mountains, it really hit the spot. 

  As far as McDonald's this is a modern location. They have the computerized menu and the screen showing the orders that are ready. There is also a mini lounge with two plush chairs. 

 There were some opportunities in cleanliness and service. There was one very young woman that was taking orders. From my observation she seemed to be brand new which caused her to have to call the shift manager about a credit card and a customer mentioning that he waited twenty minutes for his cookies. When I left, what seemed to be an off the clock McDonald's employee was joking with an employee that he is not supposed to use that language in front of customers. As far as cleanliness, the trash buckets at the Coke machines were also overflowing. In reality this is the quintessential McDonald's. 

  In my opinion McDonald's is solid but not great fast food. However, childhood memories of the McDonald's cone of soft vanilla ice cream led me to this location that is between Mount Charleston and my brother's house to celebrate National Vanilla Ice Cream Day. Preceding the vanilla ice cream cone, I enjoyed an inexpensive, fast, and convenient post-hiking dinner.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,10,3,RJ3f6dRPAs-r87P7wJkY-g
