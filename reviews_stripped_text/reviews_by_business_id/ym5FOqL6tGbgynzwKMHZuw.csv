I'm a newbie to Maryland style seafood so I had to ask Sam how to eat the Maryland Blue Crab. Even though it was my first one I could tell it was fresh and of good quality. Sam suggested the $1 happy hour oysters. I'm glad he did because they were delicious. Fresh and buttery. Their crab cakes are some of the best I've had. They're mostly crab meat. Hardly any breading. Lightly broiled and delicious.

This place is definitely worth a try. If your looking to watch a game the bar area has plenty of flat screens and good sound. You can either belly up to the bar, or sit at a table and watch a game. The bar is half inside and half outside on the patio. When the weather warms up the patio bar seating will be a great spot to eat, drink, and watch a game.",Ht-Ni1czaq10Y4nMiAliDw,4,1,5,HXcFhV8jjnCUKIr5mK1K0Q

I don't normally give bad reviews but this place took the cake for me. Shaking my head on how bad the customer service and food were.....We were driving by this shack and my husband said, ""hey I'm starving, let's get some food...how about that place? I said, well the last time we were there(2 yrs ago) we looked at their menu and walked out, but why the heck not, let's give it another shot. I ordered food to go since my baby was still sleeping in the car and we didn't wanna wake her up. Few minutes later she woke up so my husband decided that we should it at the restaurant instead. so I asked the host, she said I'll ask the manager. The host was nice and friendly that's why I gave this place 2 stars.

So my husband left to go to the bathroom. I sat down and waited. Then I overheard this lady saying to the host ""to go is to go"" she wasn't happy about it she acted like a b*tch! She finally came up to me and so I said we can't even even seat down and eat here instead? Then she said it again...well did u order it to go? I said yep, then she said ......to go is go and I said yeah but we are starving and we want to eat here.

She looked at me for a second and said okayyyy in an annoyed voice and expression, she turned around and talked to the cook she got our food on the table. Food was ok, the best thing about it was the green beans. The blue crab hard shell 11.99/lb was not good there was nothing in it and it's small, it looks like a skeleton, good thing I'm on a diet so I didn't care on eating it much!!!! It was saut√©ed with lots of butter. My husband had fish and chips, there were no chips but it comes with 2 sides. Fish was ok we had better. We had to ask for water few minutes later and we had to help ourselves with some to go boxes. No one came to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. Bad customer service. You know the saying goes...you get what you paid for...LoL....I tip the front 10% for to go order and I was going to tip 20% for dining but since it was so bad we decided to leave and didn't leave a tip on the table. What a big disappointment! We always go to Tommy Bahama's restaurant at town square, the ambiance is 100X better and food is excellent, food might be a bit expensive but it's worth it. Not going back to crab corner, We don't like the crabby customer service. We should have listened to our instincts.",uGR5GR0G2KN8TlbijUYx2Q,3,1,2,3ErG-j389TAn2CO7exX_HQ

Foods: Not very pleased! The sauce were almost bland (we got the sampler). It seems like the seafoods were frozen and as they cooked, the ice thawed out and watered down the sauce. At least that's how I'd imagine what happened. The crab itself was very salty though.

Prices: I expect for seafoods to be slightly expensive but I'd willingly pay that price if the food tastes weren't disappointing!

Second, the server was quite unprofessional and very unattentive.  I did not get a refill on my water or a check back on how things were.  Asked for the manager, we were told, "" he stepped out"". 

Being new and first time customers we were very disappointed.  It would've been nice if they offered to show us how to best eat a Maryland Crab.

When we get there, the guy tells us they didn't get that many crabs that day so there are no females and no special on the crabs. I thought that was fair, but assumed the drink specials ($2 Rolling Rock or PBR) would still be in effect... unless, God forbid, the availability of beer in the city suddenly drops overnight. Ended up being charged full price for the beer though so had to deduct a star.

531177,2014-07-31,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"For just the seafood, Crab Corner is pretty good.  I went twice, once for the fried softshell crab and then went back because I just had to try the crabcakes.  I also tried the Maryland crab soup and the bacon-wrapped scallops.  First, avoid the bacon-wrapped scallops!  They were horribly overcooked and therefore dry, tough, and except for the bacon, flavorless.  But the other three seafood items were terrific.  The crab in the crabcakes and soup tasted fresh, as opposed to frozen or out of a can.  If you have a craving for seafood (which tends to be either very bad or very expensive in the middle of the desert), Crab Corner is great.  But where this place really disappoints is everything else on the menu.  Every side I tried was just awful.  The corn on the cob had the taste and consistency of something that had been sitting in a warmer for hours, if not days.  The sweet potato tater tots are a great concept with weak execution.  And the hush puppies were either left in the fryer or sat in the warmer for so long that they were almost as tough as the scallops.  Finally, the dessert selection is almost nonexistent:  either snow cones (I tried the root beer - yuck) or Tasty Cakes (sounded very factory, so I didn't bother).  For seafood, Crab Corner gets 3 stars (the horrible bacon-wrapped scallops drops it a star).  But for everything else on the menu, it gets 1 star.  Both servers I had were great, so 4 stars for service.

The manager came up to me and said that he couldn't serve the blue crab on the happy hour but I could buy the one for $11.99 lb instead. THIS WAS A NEW RULE THAT JUST STARTED TODAY, so yesterday they served the blue crab at happy hour... So I asked why he couldn't serve the happy hour blue crab and he said because it's too expensive for them to let customers order from the happy hour menu. So I asked why it was on the menu with a price if he didn't want to serve it at that price and why ""market price or it changes""  wasn't written there and his solution was to remove the menu from the table and said ""that's how to fix that""  but you can buy the entree crab... 

As an establishment the restaurant creates the price for each item, and they just decided that they didn't want to serve it for that price without changing the menu or anything.

THE MANAGER DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIS SERVERS ABOUT THIS NEW RULE UNTIL AFTER I ALREADY ORDERED MY DISH

The waitress was very nice but it didn't make up for the managers incompetence. They should just take it off the menu or serve the dish.

I bought two Amazon Local gift certificates to use here. The first visit, we weren't brought any silverware or condiments. After five minutes of our food sitting getting cold, I had to walk up to the server station and fetch them myself. No one refilled our drinks the entire time. The signature crab stew was bitter and nasty. The steamed blue crabs are a ridiculous ripoff. What little meat they contain sticks to the shell and shreds apart making it maddeningly impossible to eat.

After that lovely meal, we still had another gift certificate so we gave them another chance. This time we were looking to sample the crab cakes. After not being greeted by the hostess and having to initiate contact, we finally were seated. And there we sat, ignored, for 35 minutes before the jackass waiter approached our table. With no eye contact, the first words out of his mouth were, ""So you ready?"" We stood up and walked out.",U7DdL_tQkebo2ySe8qIhLQ,7,0,1,5pixsL_eTe9xeq0bw4xeIg

The server was attentive and since it was a work trip I decided to splurge with a little of everything. First up raw oysters. While not for everyone I am a big fan and these did not disappoint. The shell is pretty deep so it was like a bowl of oyster. Next up was the bacon wrapped scallops. They were super hot so it needed a good cut in the middle and some the apricot sauce it comes with. It's bacon and scallops so you know it's amazing.

If you didn't already know, their cell phones have an operating program that's connected to their computers & printers; therefore, instead of writing it down they use their phones & once they hit send it goes straight to the kitchen's printer. Not quite sure if this technique is really professional or even more efficient than the old fashion way, but I guess that's just how they do things here & I have no problem with that.

Let's move on, the food I absolutely love! I am a seafood fanatic & this place is one of my favorite places to go. They give you good portions especially for their snow crab legs. The only problem I have is that they charge an outrageous amount for a half a pound of shrimp. I think it was either $8.99 or $9.99. Personally I can go somewhere else for cheaper shrimp that tastes the same, but I still sometimes come here anyway.

We decided we would stop here on our way back in last night, which we did. We figured it would have been a nice unwind. Enjoy some delicious sea food, have a cold beer and try out someplace new.

When we arrived they had a live band inside and the music was way to loud, I requested a table as far away as possible because I did not want that to ruin the evening. Even being in the back of the place I could hardly have a conversation without speaking much to loud just to communicate. It was rather annoying. The band was decent but no reason for that type of volume in such a small place.

Our server was very nice, respectful and answered all of our questions without issue, I believe his name was Jim. We ordered black muscles, crab legs, cream of crab soup, lobster bisque, and crab cakes. It was all ok, but nothing special or even close to raving about, which confuses me about all these previous reviews. I am assuming they have been limited on their seafood intake as far as quality, or we just had the unfortunate night of a new cook. I would call this place a mini Joes Crab shack.

Let me start off by saying that the food at Crab Corner is not my thing. I'm not big on fried foods. At all. If you like deep fried everything (especially seafood) then, seriously, look no further. 

This place is very large.  It has lots of space, several TVs, a big bar and a great patio. The smell (seafood) is very strong when you walk in the door which kind of killed my appetite a little. The staff is great.  There was one guy, who was playing host, waiter, and bus boy.  He was doing an excellent job too - very friendly and super quick. 

We ate: 
Boardwalk Fries - Pretty tasty and very well seasoned. 
Cod - This was beer battered and fried. By far the heaviest thing we ordered. 
Catfish - ""Lightly"" breaded and fried.
Onion Rings 
Hush Puppies
Pretty much all of this tasted the same and all of it tasted like greasy breading with the exception of the Cod which had a nice vinegar finish.  I kind of dug it, but I was starting to feel really gross by the time I tasted this. 
My husband really liked the hush puppies (I thought they were kind of so so) and he also thoroughly enjoyed his soft shell crab sandwich.  

I HATE to give such a low star review and was fully prepared to 3 star this place and move on. Then, hoping to salvage the meal by treating myself to a rare something sweet, I ordered the only dessert on the menu - the snow ball.  I'm sorry but this thing was unforgivable.  If you are going to put a snow cone on your restaurant menu, it should probably be a dang good snow cone. I've had better ones served to me by 9 year olds at little league games.

I, like many from there, grew up crabbing and eating Maryland blue crabs which have a distinct buttery-sweet flavor. Steam them up in a pot with generous handfuls of Old Bay season and I'm your best friend! I travel to Vegas a few times a year from L.A. One day recently, I found myself watching a video on ways to eat blue crabs and ended up watching one from a guy who owned 2 restaurants in Vegas. WHAT?? Blue crabs in Vegas?? Sure, there are places that serve the meat in dishes (crab cakes, sushi) but I haven't heard of any that steam them and serve (dump) them on your butcher-paper-covered table with vinegar, extra seasoning, a mallet and crab knife like this place does--Chesapeake Bay-style. The peel-and-eat shrimp was also good. The boardwalk fries (similar to the ones sold at Thrasher's in Ocean City, MD) did kinda take me back. The crabs? Mouth-wateringly, finger-licking good! Although the spice blend they use isn't actually Old Bay, it's very similar. The vinegar cups they give you even have tiny peppers in them to spice it up. Plenty of DC/MD memorabilia all over so it made me feel a little bit at home. The only caveat to me was the service: although attentive and prompt, they were not terribly friendly or engaging. I wasn't expecting them to be super outgoing but still felt kinda like we were just given the food and the check and that was it. I might be able to understand somewhat if it were busy, but it wasn't while we were there. Regardless, I truly hope this place survives and sticks around for years.

Our party of four wanted crabs! We're all from Delaware, and two of us have been living in the desert for a couple years, missing blue crabs like crazy. We went on ""Three Dollar Thursday"", for which we ordered 2.5 dozen large males at $4 a pop (about half price off their menu board). Before they came out, we ordered two appetizers: a blue crab dip & a crab pretzel. Both were pretty good, however I felt that the same exact crab mix was used for both apps. The only difference was melted cheese was placed over the pretzel. The pretzel made me miss Philly pretzels, not the same.

With each dozen of crabs delivered to our table, we all gave various feedback from cooked perfectly to too mushy to eat. I personally ate 5 crabs and 2 of those were on the overcooked end. That seemed to be the consensus also: somewhere around 60-70% of the crabs weren't cooked to perfection. But it was worth it. We filled our bellies and were happy. We may return if the craving ever comes back, since flying home would be a lot more pricey and time consuming rather than dealing with a less than perfect cook on the crabs.

Everything is super fresh and the beachy decor kind of lets you delude yourself into thinking you've taken a brief vacation. Except for the video poker built into the bar, but hey, you're still in Vegas.

Happy Hour is offered daily from 2-6PM, with buck-a-shuck oysters! Their cocktail sauce is nice and thick, and the horseradish is super spicy, but these are just as enjoyable plain. Crab cakes are a good option, and if you're feeling especially indulgent (or with a group), try the Crab Pretzel- a soft Bavarian style pretzel topped with Anapolis-style crab salad and cheese. 

The steamer sampler is always a good option fora couple (or a trio!), with shrimp and three kinds of crab. I'm not the hugest fan of ""market pricing"" because you don't really have an idea how much you'll be spending (and it can really add up!), but you can certainly call before you visit.

Ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell as an appetizer. What a joke. 4 of the 7 oysters they gave us had absolutely no meat in them. It just looked like gray slime. So I am sure that's why we got an extra one to try to make up for the pathetic ones. And they had the nerve to charge $10.50 for them. I've had better oysters at AYCE sushi restaurants in this town or even Tides Oyster Bar @ Sunset Station. Ordered the soft shell crab sandwich for $13.99 (I believe). It was good I have to say but I have again had better. Tarter sauce was good though.

We ordered the crab cake sandwich, soft shell crab sandwich, and a side of fries. (Don't sandwiches usually come with fries??) The price was a bit steep for food that wasn't impressive. 

I didn't want to order any seafood that I would much rather go to hot n juicy for or boiling crab for fear that I would be disappointed. I'm sure glad we didn't. Sandwiches were mediocre at best.

I have sampled most of their menu, and have yet to find anything I dislike. Please, if you come to a place called Crab Corner and order a chicken sandwich, you forfeit your right to complain.
They have great happy hour specials (I believe $4 wine and beer), and a number of appetizers to choose from. Also, they have $1 Oysters during happy hour and on Sundays. Yes, their oysters are small but the texture is just right and they are always fresh. So, if you are a fan of huge, briny oysters this is not the place for you. The price point matches what you get. I've also had their calamari fries which were delicious. We have shared the garlic steam pot among four people ($49.99) and it was filled with corn, shrimp, and various types of crab. I have also had their fried soft shell blue crab and it was perfect. They offer several sides but my favorite were the fried okra and sweet potato tots.
The service was great, the price point just right, and the interior was spacious with a fully stocked bar. On certain nights they host trivia there and it gets pretty packed.

Pricey, Plan to spend $13+ for lunch. We consider this expensive for a work day lunch.

My co worker liked it, but I only ate half which is highly unusual for me. It was a bit fishy for my liking, seemed they were masking smelly cheap crab with too heavy paste like cream & lots of pepper. Even ran into a shell chip or two. Ick. The only thing that got me really crabby ( bad pun) was it took over 1/2 hour for them to ladle out 2 bowls of soup, plunk down a handful of saltines, and napkins. Ridiculous! I will say the hush puppies we split were top notch.. The ambience is horrible, school bus yellow walls with stop sign red below chair rail, think nursery school, or sports team. Ya I get they're football fans but its a bit too teenage boys bedroom. Coincidentally, all the wait staff & cooks were younger asian men...Not sure what that means? Its an oxymoron, I don't put Maryland crab expertise..think fishermen, think sea captains, think east coast old world, think Loyola, ...with surfer dudes toting iPods.  Either way, Service was laughably bad, food pricey for fried fare, ambience none existent. Doubt we will return.",nBenF2ly5Ig285-9u_1EXA,0,1,2,s3gJ7hm5XUBDB7pLY-0cQg

We came in town for a conference and decided to bring my parents and our kids, there were 6 of us that being said two were children one 8 and the other 11.  The waiter was friendly but never anywhere to be found, when I ask for the check I noticed he added 18% to my bill, My husband and I waited tables all through high school and college so we tip between 20 and 25% always, I gave them 3 stars because first of all the service sucked we saw him all of 3 times he came back once in the hour and forty five minutes that we were there to fill our tea and water the rest of the time it was just to drop off our food he didn't even clear the dirty dishes out of the way till he brought the check.. I should be happy he saved me money because my husband would have insisted on leaving at least 20% but when he saw that he put 18% tip on for 4 adults and 2 children he agreed.. I really would say for the price of the meal and the lack of service go somewhere else there are so many other places in the Las Vegas area where you will have better service.. I wish I could say we would be back but I think we will be looking for other places to visit on our next trip.",VAOes49YNgR34hoBJH_qIg,0,0,3,ewBCLkabwDXFfoEDMODCyA

I had the po boy sandwich with chips. The chips were out of this world!!! The sandwich was tasty too. The next time I had the garlic steamer and it was full of good stuff. Shrimp,  crab, and corn. It was delicious. It was hot,steamy and we'll seasoned. Our bill was a little pricey but we also had two drinks and my husband ordered his own meal. The steamer is plenty to share.

The crab cake is one of the best 'I've had with great flavor an large lumps of crabs with little filler. I also got the Alaskan crab legs on this visit and they were some of the best  I have had hands down.  The bar area is a great set up as the back opens up with a view of the patio which is great on a nice day. I actually hit this establishment twice on my visit since I enjoyed it so much the first day I arrived. Its not too far of the strip with 5 star food for reasonable prices.,rLXeF5hSvnVpBzl_b1ASuQ,3,0,5,VrJvvJpZXKUcDsf9SByC_Q
1754961,2017-03-06,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,I finally got to go to crab corner on Saturday with my daughter & my friend. It was her first time going as well.  I heard alot of good reviews & the pictures looked delicious. I enjoyed the food very much the garlic steam pot was just like the pictures I saw & I could see why it was $64.99. The reason why I couldn't give them 5 stars was due our waiter Greg. I informed him that we had separate bills me & my daughter from my friend.  I asked for the garlic steam pot & he went into how much it cost like I couldn't afford it then he went on to say it's alot of food for just the two of us & how it's enough for 3 people.  I was like wait a minute why is he trying to get me to change my order & how does he know we couldnt eat it all. It's my money let me get what I want I felt like he didn't want me order it. My friend was kinda unsure because she wanted both catfish & fried oysters so he offered to combine her plate with both instead of ordering them separately. I ordered 2 appetizers mini crab cakes (delicious) & crab pretzel.  I got one appetizer b4 dinner & the other one (crab pretzel) came with our entr√©es.  Since my crab pretzel came with our food I didn't get to eat it cuz I wanted to enjoy our entr√©es b4 our food got cold. I didn't understand that.  Then on top of that when my friend plate arrived she only had fried oysters her catfish was missing. She had to wait 10 more minutes for them to deliver 1 piece of fish. No butter was given to us for our crabs & I had to ask twice for napkins. Our waiter was no where to be found. I had to ask the hostess who seated us for butter. I could see our waiter talking & laughing with other customers sitting around us & I tried to call him by his name to get his attend but he walked off like he didn't hear. The couple he was talking to right next to us felt the need to say I'm sorry after they saw me trying to get his attention.  He never checked in with us too see if we needed anything only to apologize to my friend for messing up her order.We both felt he didn't deserve a tip but being the person I am I gave him $5 dlrs & she gave him $3 dlrs.  All in all I would go back for the food the fried soft crab & those crab cakes is worth my return just hopefully I get a different waiter.,fWd0NHizdU-zdL-FWJpLeA,0,0,3,N-OodiWgBb3RYiXq6j6qeg

They have Crab brought in every day so look for the specials on the big blackboard. They sell crab by the pound and the size, and sex. They have blue crab but check first. 

The service is a bit rustic and so it the presentation. But they usually have a Game on, and cold beer and crabs, shrimp and all, so laid back and smash some crab. 

They do have a small selection of no seafood items like chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich.

We started out woth a Seafood Gumbo that was to die for. All kinds of Seafood and some great shrimp to boot. Then we had the Crab Cakes with 2 sides and we chose the Potato Salad & Cole Slaw that were both scrumptious to devour.

1886722,2013-10-09,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"I am a super fan for the Crab Corner Southwest!  I love the indoor / outdoor bar which comes with bartenders who are friendly, personable and know how to make great cocktails.  They have New Castle and Magic Hat on draft which are 2 of my favorite draft beers right now.  I like that they have a Shuffleboard table, Corn Hole and Beer Pong which makes hanging out with my friends all the more fun.  I met the owners (2 brothers) and they are super passionate about everything Maryland and always have a great game playing on the 9 TV's so you are not going to miss anything.  (yes I am a football fan)  They also make sure to get the Freshest Seafood possible (which I love) by having LIVE blue crab flown in daily!  I asked for the secret recipe for the crab dip but there was no way I was going to get it.  :O)

Now about my favorite items on the menu.......  I am a huge foodie and love trying different food and immediately fell in love with multiple menu items.  I know blue crab is a little more work but once you get crab picking down the meat is sweet and delicious and worth the little mess that comes with it.  Below are my favorites so far............  

LOVE!!

BLUE CRABS W/ THE SPICE & DRAWN BUTTER
CRAB DIP (SO GOOD)
MINI CRAB CAKES
HEAD ON SHRIMP WITH THE SPICY SAUCE
SOFT SHELL SANDWICH IS PERFECT FOR LUNCH
BOARDWALK FRIES (I ASK FOR A LITTLE EXTRA CRISP & EAT THEM WITH THE MALT VINEGAR)
OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL ARE ALWAYS FRESH
CLAM STEAMERS
PEI MUSSELS

My son ordered a salmon dish that had more noodles than it did fish, my husband ordered shrimp that was over battered and looked and tasted like frozen out of a box, I got the fish n chips and it had hardly any flavor to it other than salty, the tarter sauce was not very good.  Not to mention that non of their dinner dishes come with either soup or salad and it was quite pricey for just meals.

2290453,2014-02-05,6,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"There are only 3 things I order here, and I love them. Blue crabs, happy hour oysters, and happy hour beer. I don't mess with anything else. You'll notice that most of the 2-star Yelp reviews are from people who don't eat blue crabs. Blue crabs are what Crab Corner does best. I understand picking crabs isn't for everyone, but this is one of those places where you have to know what to order.

I'm a fan. But it's a real time consuming meal - figure about 8-10mins per crab. Don't miss $2 crab Tuesdays (regular size) and $3 crab Thursdays (large size). I've never done the all-you-can-eat Mondays ($24.99) there, because that could be big trouble timewise and healthwise. Picking crabs is hard on your fingertips, and I usually eat 7 or 8 in one sitting. I'm not full after 7 or 8 crabs, but at that point I do feel like taking a shower after that much cracking, splatting and sucking. Feeling rich? Get the jumbo size - a lot easier to pick and a lot more meat.

The $1 happy hour oysters from 2pm-6pm are usually a large variety like Chesapeake or Fannie Mae. Very tasty and a great deal. Draft beers are $3 during happy hour.

It could literally take you 2+ hours to eat here, picking and grinning the entire time. My best suggestion is to order at most 3 crabs per person at a time, so they stay hot. When starting on your last crab, put another order in.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,15,7,5,rcZ6mYmd271pJPctpQwcaQ
2300405,2014-03-17,2,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"I heard about their $1 oyster special on Sundays so came here to check it out. The oysters were decent sized and tasty. Came with the typical lemon, horse radish and cocktail sauce. They weren't the best but for $1 each... Totally worth it. For my entree, I had the crab cake sandwich. The food took a while to come out but when it finally did, I must say... I was pretty impressed. The crab cake was huge! It was a little bland but nothing a touch of ketchup and ranch can't fix. My mom got the soft shell crab sandwich. The crab on hers was huge too! She had to rip off the arms so that she could get a grip on the sandwich. We also ordered a side of French fries but they ran out so have us boardwalk fries (at no extra charge) instead. I would have preferred the regular fries because the boardwalk was too salty for me. Oh well. 

The restaurant is very open. Staff... Super friendly and welcoming. The one thing that really bugged me was the fact that the waiters take the orders on their cell phones. At first, I thought our waiter was in the middle of a text message, or tweet, or what have you... While taking our appetizer order. I was a little offended and felt very uncomfortable. When she came back to take our entree order, she bent down a little and that's when I realized she was punching in our order on her phone! I get that technology is the way to go nowadays but c'mon! It was such an awkward situation. My mom thought she was being extremely rude so I had to explain to her that she was just doing her job. I hope management realizes this and changes the way they take orders because if I had not seen her screen, I would have never known! 

Crab corner definitely has the potential for improvement. I'm gonna be coming here again sometime in the future and I would love to give them more stars. But for now, I'm sticking with a 3.",3r9BVzKJ7jA4SCDgjhBzZQ,3,1,3,3bQ5yXbNOP6zpQ08-Cwn8g

Me and my wife came in expecting to do the AYCE crab special that was on Monday nights. We came into the restaurant and it reeked of old bay seasoning and that bad fish smell you find in old markets. We weren't too upset by this, just figured it was part of the atmosphere. We ordered our food and had about 6-8 very small blue crabs dropped off at our table. We have never eaten crabs like this before and how no idea how to do it, but the waiter just left them there on the table and walked away. There was very little meat in the crabs and the act of ripping them open and seeing the ""gut mustard"" was absolutely disgusting and enough to ruin our appetite. We attempted to eat it and realized there was no way we would get full or even stomach it. The manager told us he would charge us for 6 of the crabs plus our appetizers and that he would bring us out some King Crab legs that we ordered instead. The crab legs were good but after our clothes and body were covered in crab juice and old bay seasoning, we weren't able to enjoy it from the stench that was burned into our nostrils.  We didn't expect what happened next, the waiter gave us our bill for $80 which included the crab we didn't even eat... What type of customer service is that? Especially in Las Vegas... I do not see this place surviving here long and definitely warn people to avoid it, not worth the time, money, or the amount of detergent it will take to get that smell out of your clothes.",RYtoB7pAerYmTFxlXBnKYg,3,1,2,N4Y_wfuzfhg5h-4reUwRhA

2340806,2016-04-11,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"So My husband and I saw this place from Yelp and went to try. First,they didn't have any female crabs today, we ordered male crab - which means it won't have any eggs or a lot of sweet meat like a female one. Okay, that's fine, so we ordered Jumbo and Large Blue male Crabs.  However, the Jumbo was smaller than the Large size.. (even large was pretty small) Since our Jumbo was so small, the waitress brought us one more bigger size of crab later (we didn't ask for, she just brought one more and we really appreciated). The service was very nice. But the crabs were pretty bad. I felt like I spent $60 dollars to eat the SHELLS...  [I guess if you go there during the happy hour, it's different story].
Anyways, we had to order a Lobster roll (sandwich) so we don't get grumpy after we eat in this place. However, they didn't have sweet potato fries... so they gave us some kind of chips which tasted like a week old... so we didn't eat that. Lobster roll was okay, but for $20 dollars, I won't ever order it again. Very salty and taste not that fresh.. 
Overall, the service was good, the concept of this business was okay, but food was horrible in my opinion. You could go to other cajun crab/seafood places with the same price for better quality..",g6vlfVVx_N0-_MeFc4HA8g,0,0,1,wTn1AlhOfxykfKI_jNHzhQ

I arrived and there were only two parties seated, in a Ravens bar, on Sunday. Not what I was expecting.

I paid $46 for two sandwiches and a crab pretzel and sped home with lunch.....only to open the crab pretzel which smelled like the ocean. 

The lobster roll had an ample amount of lobster, crunch bread, and an underwhelming amount of flavor (sad face), for $20!!!! 

The other sandwich had a great sauce and good bread but the fried oysters, fish and shrimp themselves had no flavor at all.

We went around 5pm on a Friday night and it was easy to get a table still. The place is relatively loud however so don't expect to have any easy conversations. 

First off, the food is good but nothing to write home about. There wasn't really anything that we didn't like but we've been to steakhouses or non seafood restaurants that had better fish. I got the soft shell crab sandwich which doesn't come with any side so I ordered onion rings, and my wife got the King crab legs and a $3 happy hour beer. We shared a crab cake platter which comes with two very small sides. All of this came out to $75 with tax which in our opinion was far overpriced.

 I started w/the Maryland Crab soup which tasted exactly like it came from a can. I had two bites and couldn't tolerate the ""can"" remnants left on my tongue. Slowly (very slowly) our 3 appetizers came out to the table by two (the only two) waiters in the place who would play a video game each and every time they passed the large, out of place, golf game. As my  Pepsi cup sat empty, I watched as both waiters made direct beelines for the game at every opportunity they could- which was about every 30 seconds....
 So, out came our  undercooked Scallops wrapped in  beyond burnt bacon, our Calamari fries that did not taste or look anything comparable to Calamari, and the Crab cakes- which were the ONLY food we had that we both actually enjoyed....
  I would ONLY come back to try their Mon special which is endless crabs piled on the table.. I grew up on Long Island, and we LOVEd to go crabbing- so when family comes into town we will go back for the CRABS ONLY...... CRABS and soda- that's it..........

This is a really great layout, I absolutely love the outside/inside bar and patio area. The restaurant is pretty big inside with lots of TV's (they had the football games on when we were there, most people at the bar were watching). 

The menu had so much to choose from, we spent more time debating on what to get than your average customer. So the plan was to get a couple things and share. This was our order:

Lobster bisque- awesome, prob one of the best I've had, tasted like I was at a strip restaurant. Not too much sherry, and the broth was delish. 

Crab Cakes- outstanding. About 90% crab (real crab) and not too much breading. Sauce is excellent too. 

Alaskan Cod and Fried Sea Clams-cod was excellent and I loved you could get a hint of the beer in the batter. 

Soft Shell Crab-so good! Batter was good, didn't take away from the taste of the crabs. 

Sides-
*Hushpuppies were the best I've had (better than the ones I recently had in North Carolina) Not dry at all and had a good seasoning. 
*Sweet potato fries (can't really mess those up)
*Coleslaw was good but it was a tad warm, needs to be a lot colder. 
*Potato salad wasn't the best I've had, a little on the plain side. 

I definitely want to come back and try some of their cocktails and sit outside on their patio. They had an good specialty cocktail list.

3005483,2014-06-18,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"Bottom line on this recent visit: the crabs are great; the service.....not so much. 

We were served by a waiter named Kyle. After he brought us our drinks, he then took our order of 8 blue crabs (Tuesday's special at $2/crab) and an order of black mussels. We waited for about 10 minutes until the crabs arrived, however there was no sign of the black mussels nor did Kyle tell us that the mussels would be coming up shortly. That's fine we thought. We figured the mussels would arrive soon. 15 minutes into our enjoyment of the crabs, we realized that our order of mussels had yet to arrive. Ok, we'll just ask Kyle about the order of mussels when he checks up on us or when he returns to refill our drinks. 

Turns out that would never happen. 

Not once did Kyle check up on us or refill our drinks until well afterward as we were finishing up our meal. One of the other servers (his name was David, I believe, and he appeared to be a senior member of the staff) took it upon himself to refill our drinks and ask us if we needed more crabs. If it weren't for David, we would still be waiting there to have our drinks refilled and our second order of crabs taken. Prior and after David approaching us, we would notice Kyle walk by and glance at our table several times during our meal. Not once did he ask us if the meal was to our liking nor did he refill our drinks. It seems that he didn't notice our drinks (or lack there of) or that he just couldn't be bothered to refill them. We were not about to ask to have our drinks refilled nor ask about our missing order of mussels because we as paying customers feel that we SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. The server should be looking after the customer frequently and making sure that every need is met without having to be flagged down or asked. 
Only at the very end of our meal did Kyle finally approach us and ask us if we needed anything else. By that point I didn't even mention the order of mussels that we never received and just asked for refills of our water. I would only mention the missing order of mussels if they showed up on our bill (it did not, which is another issue entirely). 

We've been here several times before and have usually had good service.

I do have some minor complaints. Sometimes they run out of blue crab. Occasionally they overcook the fried food (like the hushpuppies), although the food is still good.

I hadn't seen it before and because I'm such a foodie I just had to try it being that I LOVE seafood! I suggested this place to a friend and she was down to try it out with me! When we walked in we were greeted by a nice guy and was told that because it was Wednesday they were running some sort of ""flip a coin night"" which consist of them flipping a quarter at 10PM and they total out your tab for whatever you've ordered up to this point.. Then if you win you get your whole bill take. Care of.. I thought to myself this is interesting.. We ordered the 8 small crab cakes for $19.99 I believe and I selected off the ""Pick Two"" menu choosing the Atlantic Cod and what we're suppose to be catfish nuggets but came out as a fillet.. No big deal I guess.. You also get two sides with that option and I preferred the corn on the cob followed by the sweet potato fries.. If I could rate my whole meal experience on a scale from 1-10 Id give them a 7.. There was nothing spectacular about my meal in fact I felt like I could've got the same quality out of the VanKemp boxed fish out the frozen food isle at the grocery store. My friend said her crab cakes were just okay as well.

My daughter and I stopped in yesterday for a quick bite to eat before heading back to work. From the minute we walked in the smell was terrible, granted we know seafood places have a tendency to smell a little funky but this place just smelled bad.  The table condiments were filthy. We were looking at what was available to use and when we picked up the large container of seasoning, it was covered with food and smears and old fingerprints from previous patrons. It looked like someone had been eating crab legs with their fingers then moved onto the seasonings over and over again. The bus boy or waiting staff obviously never wipe them down.  In the women's bathroom the wall was covered in dirt and the bathrooms had all the toilet paper spindles empty with extra TP just sitting on top of the back of the toilet. Looked like no one had serviced or emptied the waste disposal unit located in each bathroom as they were overflowing with trash. 

We decided to play it safe and order the chicken fingers or chicken nuggets I think they were called, we paid approx 10 buck a piece. When they came out there were 2 in each basket with fries.  They were the pre bought frozen chicken fingers and were pretty gross.  It doeskin take much for a restaurant to purchase fresh chicken tenderloins and dredge them in some milk cover them with some flour and deep fry them.  This is a pretty simple meal to prepare for most restaurants.  Not to mention the price was way over for 2 nuggets I mean they weren't even extra big just seems a bit steep for 2 bites.  

Needless to say we wont be back and would recommend that they either find a cleaning crew to clean things up or they wont be in business too long.  Also a little fresh food really goes along way.",Otoblf7lFBZUGokgOTL50g,2,0,1,eVtD__lM-Z0tTqSF670qqg

Our visit to this location was during their Tuesday special and we arrived at 5:45pm and was able to catch the tail end of their happy hour. I've come in the past with my family and we enjoyed the crab. I wanted to order about a dozen female crabs but our waiter suggested I order half now and the rest later so it wouldn't get cold. An hour later we are approached by the owner apologizing for the delay but the expediter was new and gave our crab to another table. He gave us shrimp to nibble on and another beer as we waited for our crabs. Our waiter at this time was also the bartender and he was very VERY apologetic and sincere. Over an hour later we get six crabs. I don't trust the wait so I order six more female crabs. He appologizes that they are out of the smaller size but we will get the larger size for the same price. When the crabs arrive they are all males. I ask what happened to my order of females and he again apologizes that they ran out. Well I still don't understand why they didn't say they ran out of female crabs when I ordered. 

Lesson learned from my visit to both locations ...just because they are named crab corner and boast their Maryland crabs doesn't mean they have crabs to sell at their restaurants, maybe the crabs are hiding in the ocean but next time I want blue crabs I'll head over to the Asian market and cook them myself.",lTWXNRmeCbD6nEBc9upCqQ,0,0,1,l03EXJuOVAfa1ujtS2NxeA

The memories were easily found with the same set-up, even with alignment remaining the same. This should have been more than a hint, but of course we proceeded to order.

The menu was basic, but much listed as 'market' price. With the bill, the market rates seemed to be more from a greedy Wall Street banker lining their pockets on seafood futures, than from a local crab shack worth spending a dime.

The food was not bad, but very in-proportionate and served on China from a local dollar store. The table was crowded with customary sauces and shakes of seasonings, but oddly served in a Pepsi bucket as if a local sports bar.

The service was poor at best. Perhaps suited for a group of college kids out for a binge, but not to par with expectations for such high prices and very subpar presentation. 

In closing I would not make this a personal recommendation, but then again know that for the same price there are wide selections of superior rated and highly frequented competitors not far off the beaten path.",R119EvxHr2oZ3LMzlbPVDw,3,0,2,eEWcGygzWn6zVckM3UiHtA

Not a small baby, a huge roach about an inch and a half long and half inch wide crawled across my table in the later half of my meal. I immediately got up, in disgust and walked away from my table.

As I offered to tip my waiter accordingly, but did not feel it was right for me to pay for this meal, he called the cops on me and I stayed in the restaurant till they arrived.

So after a little bit of scrolling through my Yelp Bookmarks, we settled for Venezuelan. So driving down Rainbow from Warm Springs, I opened my big mouth and said, ""oh, Crab Corner is right there!""  To which my husband said, ""oh, I could use a crab pot!"" and makes a U-turn.

We got there right before the ""dinner rush"". We sat down ordered water and a Pepsi and started looking over the menu when my husband realized, it wasn't the Creole crab pot style restaurant. Hence the Maryland Crab signs all over the restaurant. Although a little bummed, we were already seated and so we decided to give it a try and I'm glad we did.

#1, thing we loved about this place, the 80s music. It really brought us back in time.
#2, the lobster bisque was amazing
#3, the soft shell crab was pretty good
#4, super large portion of pasta under the large grilled salmon. So much so, that I don't think I ate half of it.

The service was great, but a little slow.

As we watched dishes come out from the kitchen, because we were seated right outside of it, my husband noticed that some platters coming out only had rows of crabs.  As we got our check, my husband asked the waitress what that was about since he didn't see it on the menu. The waitress pointed out to the chalkboard behind me where it had a list of crab sizes and prices for female versus male crabs. She explained to us that those tables had only ordered the crabs. The least expensive was $4 for the small female crab while the most expensive was the jumbo size male at $12. Per the waitress, the jumbo male size measures 7-inches. The price for crab of the size crab is reasonably priced.

Note: If you're accustomed to having just crab legs, the measurement is referring to the body of the crab and not the legs. I've had dinner with girlfriends where they've never had shellfish in its natural shell and was surprised when it came out.

4 stars for the service and ambiance. 

My husband is a Maryland native and he had been wanting to go here for a while. This is a little far from our house, but since we were in town we decided to stop in. Fortunately we stopped in right when it was happy hour so we got a couple bucks off. We got ourselves a nice assortment of food including:

Crab cake - We only got a small one and it came free for joining the text club. This was really good and we should have gotten more!

Boardwalk fries - Eh maybe my expectations were high but these are no Thresher's fries (which they're modeled after). We actually had two batches and both were not as crispy as I was hoping. 

Crab soup - This was also just okay.  Kinda pricey for $5 for what you got. As it cooled it wasn't bad. 

Crab Cobb salad - Salad was flavorful and I appreciated how they separated all the ingredients so I could pick and choose what I wanted. I felt the crab meat they used for the salad was sub par. Kinda wish I got grilled shrimp instead after all the crab overload. 

Rockefeller Oysters - Not bad but not as big - or as cheesy - as they looked in the picture. 

Female crabs - We got an order of 6 small female blue crabs and I was reminded how much work they were. I was hoping for a more flavorful crab but I think I was a little underwhelmed. Some crab meat was more dry and some was juicier so there wasn't as much of a consistency. 

Oh - and they had video poker which was actually quite fun to kill some time while waiting for the food. 

Overall this place was worth a visit, especially if you've lived in Maryland and want some nostalgia. We will be back but probably get more crab cakes. And maybe try another seafood to balance it out.",pWlelwBYGwvzISHzauw6-A,3,0,4,Bc8yfbR3i2nl9YLAwvDspw

The best times are when there is a special or Happy Hour. There is usually a good sports game on, and a good selection of beer. The crabs are pretty good, but can vary. The crab boil is fine and plentiful to share, but not spot on. It's not a problem, however. The collective experience is more of a kind of place that you return to because it is familiar and unassuming. It is fun to use a mallet to crack crabs with your chums. Don't overthink it!

So we were promptly greeted from the moment we walked in and seated in the bar. The waiter was nice and informative but he forgot my soup, so I never got to try it and almost forgot to take it off our ticket at the end. He also was a bit forgetful with the condiments and $2 crab that I ordered. 

First we ordered the mozzarella sticks. The marinara sauce was cold but the sticks were good.  The fried oysters weren't very crispy though big in size. The green beans were flavorful and the sweet potato fries though crispy were a little bland. The best part by far was the $2 crab. Since I had no idea how to get into it they sent another waitress over to show me the ropes, that was very kind of them. The crab was fun to eat and I got lucky and had one with lots of eggs. Yum!

We arrived just in time for hour which they offer DAILY from 2-6pm. Bacon-wrapped shrimp, oysters on the 1/2 shell, calamari fries, crab pretzel... just to name a couple options. We ordered 2 orders of bacon-wrapped shrimp (comes w/ 3 per order), and $1 oysters off the happy hour and opted for the grilled shrimp ceasar and blackened mahi mahi which came in big enough portions to feed the boyfriend and I.

Service was great, there were about 3 people helping us out. Would help if we just had only one server (who introduced themselves) and 1-2 bussers just because we never knew who to ask. Although they were all willing to help us out, just got a little confusing. 

Known for their signature blue crabs which I'm still kicking myself for not trying, but we will definitely be returning for those and happy hour!

The first impression this place left on me was...well,  that fishy smell, not off to a good start....... Myself and a few co-workers stopped here for lunch. As it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago. I figured they would have their best foot forward.  Sure hope that was not the case. 

Cant remember the name of the server, we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit. 1) bring water and take order 2) drop off food 3) drop off check.  Now let me clarify, I do not expect to be served like a king, I am not a nose up type of person. However, when we had to ask for a re-fill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walking by, then I started to question the service.

This brings me to the food. Part of the drink re-fill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty. We were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food. The fried soft shell crab was not very impressive, scrawny little guys, 90% shell/breading, 5% meat, 5% grease/salt. The fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either. The potato salad was pretty good.

All the seasoning is on the outside so if you deshell the meat and dip a bit on the outer crab, you get the J.O. Aka ol bay flavas.  Those real crab luvas out there know the sweet treasure that lies inside the main shell!!  Just like shrimp heads n crawfish noggins! Service was ok, but quick. Peel n eat shrimp was the best dish as there was more meat, the crabs are laborious lil suckas for a lil bit o meat... But it's an experience and an indulgence at that.  Overall 4 stars, it just wasn't real satisfying and no Bammmm! But  I would return if craving crab, Monday is AYCE @ $24.99, so may be a good value if you can crack alotta crabs!

Called in advance to see if they took reservations and was told ""no just come in."" Bad idea! The wait was 20mins even though they weren't busy half the restaurant was empty. Not only that, people are walking in with reservations! 

Once we were seated at a table with no serving ware we waited 17 mins for someone to take our drink order. Then the waiter comes and asks ""what are we eating?"" No introduction. No specials were told. Hell to this day I don't even know his name because he failed to tell us! 

Our order arrived in a timely manner although we didn't have anything to eat it with (still no serving ware) My water was now empty and I'm parched so we order the bottle of champagne. Wrong! Champagne served in wine glasses and there wasn't a chiller provided so the bottle sweats on the table and we're drinking warm champagne. Smh. For some odd reason an order of white rice came out with our meal and it didn't belong to us. It sat as we began to eat and the waiter returns with a bashful smile and says ""Uhhhh yeaaaaaa this isn't yourssss"" then proceeds to do a slow motion James Brown slide as he takes it to the correct table. Yes, he took it to the table as if it were a fresh bowl prepared for them.

The food is barely spiced, which is bland and boring. Got the garbage can lid filled with corn, crab, and potatoes. The last thing that really made me not want to return was that they decided to use the cooling of outside air by opening the front doors. The parking lot always smells like sewer vent gasses and that smell came right into the building. The smell made it hard to eat.

We ordered just what they are known for...Crabs! They had the $3/large crab special. Ordered 8pcs, 2 orders of white rice, and lobster bisque.

First off, we were greeted promptly and seated right away as soon as we walked in. That was instantly a relief since those were some of the issues of patrons here. We were handed menus and order was taken about 7 minutes later by our very friendly server. 

Then our order came, as soon as I opened my first crab, it was love at first sight! It was meaty, full of crab butter, and steamed just perfectly!!! That just sealed the deal for us. Our server served all of our side dishes, limes, vinegar, drinks at one time so we never had to flag him for anything. We devoured and enjoyed our crabs dipped in spicy vinegar. 

This place was truly above and beyond my expectations. Everything went smoothly service and quality of food wise. Although, I cannot speak for the other items they have for their menu since we only ordered what they are popular for, and that is their crabs.  Yelp is a great source in our dining choices but it does not always determine the outcome of our dining experience. One customer might have a horrible time but it doesn't mean you will too. Sometimes people could be ordering items that are not really their specialty so you cannot really set your expectations high. I remember dining at a vietnamese restaurant that served one of the best Pho' but their Pad Thai was anything but great.  So always give a place the benefit of the doubt and stick to the highlights of their menu.

We sure glad we did because we have just discovered a hidden gem next time we crave for blue crabs at a very reasonable price!",ocaGKV_D3WsXnjm2T33pVQ,2,1,5,tP_d_E2DXA8Uf_GEw5VKlg

Boardwalk fries were fun. Love Old Bay. Brussel sprouts were the best I've had in a restaurant and the corn on the cob was so good it was promptly inhaled. Hush puppies were on the good side of fair.

Decided to give 2 stars because the service was actually not bad. We were in a group of six and the waiter got everything ordered in a timely manner and all the orders were correct. We had been planning this trip for a month and I was excited to try the Blue Crab. We learned from the waiter that they had only King Crab or Snow Crab, no Blue Crab at all. They hadn't had Blue Crab for 4 days. The menu and advertisements place a huge emphasis on Blue Crab being available for a variety of options, but to our disappointment a lot of the menu was not available to us due to the lack of Blue Crab. 

We ended up ordering fish, shrimp, oysters; they were mediocre at best. I can get deep fried seafood at many other places as long as they have a fry basket. The one thing that had the potential to satisfy me were the bacon-wrapped scallops but they were not very good either. They were small under-cooked bay scallops wrapped in bland fatty bacon.

As far as the food goes, I don't understand what people love. Granted, we didn't order the famous Maryland crabs, I expected much much more from what we did order.

Everything was delicious. I was so happy and pleased with their oysters. It was so delicious and fresh. You can't beat $1 oysters that are fresh as the ones here at crab corner. The blue crabs was good, but I wish they had more juices in the crab but it was still good. Although it does take some work to get into the crab so if you patient and work hard to open your crab, it's worth it. Definitely recommend coming here for happy hour if you're a seafood person.",lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,1,0,4,Hx5zleFWmnmWeVKv1Nj-9g

Our preferred starter is the mini crab cakes. I definitely can't complain about lack of crab here. These crab cakes are almost all crab and have very little filling. The crab here is reasonably priced and very fresh. It's also prepared perfectly so it's easy to crack the crab and get to the meat in no time. The sweet hushpuppies side is generously portioned and delicious. The flavor is great and they have a nice amount of sweetness. 

The restaurant is very sports oriented so I would suggest avoiding this place on a Saturday or Sunday during football season. It says a lot about their crab if I can sit through sports to eat my crab.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,1,4,mBVBA_tFhQjN1zGcBG8bMg

The atmosphere is cool and casual with a sports bar feel to it. It's covered in Ravens, Orioles, and Terps gear. We opted for an inside seat, but we noticed that outside had cool hammocks. Bucket list item for when I come back. We got a couple of beers. They had a decent selection, and we're kinda craft beer snobs. 

I ordered 5 regular and medium jimmies (male crabs). The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because they serve fresh sooks (female crabs) on their all-you-can-eat special. Now, I get that a lot of people prefer the sooks, but from an ethical perspective, I just don't jive with this business practice. If you are going to offer sooks, limit it per customer please!

Enuff soap boxing! The jimmies were GREAT. Boiled perfectly with tons of Old Bay seasoning. I took my time with them.

It even had a smell which should have been my warning to stop eating it. The MD crab soup was ok, not as good as stuff back home, with a good amount of old bay. The crab cake had cartilage that I had to stop and pick out. Neither the crab dip nor the crab cake had old bay. I asked for old bay chips and there wasn't a speckle of old bay on there.

I ordered the fried clams with a side of brussels sprouts and garlic green beans. The clams were incredibly tasty with a nice surprise that they were clean.. no grit or sand.
The tartar sauce was on point as were the sides.  I did try a sample of the coleslaw but it wasn't quite to my liking. 
My boyfriend ordered the Crabby Cobb which was a gorgeous salad filled with all of the goodies a salad should have.. they aren't skimpy by any means with anything.
I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was also very good, no complaints here.
We finished off our meal with a snow cone type dessert 'pina colada'... not bad!
I highly recommend taking your family, friends, mate, co-worker, or just bring yourself. The prices are outstanding for what you are served, and the menu is complete...

4626494,2016-04-24,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"My wife and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for some time. We came on a Saturday for an early dinner (3:45p). Aside from the bar, there were only two tables occupied. It took a couple of minutes to be seated, and the hostess had trouble finding a clean table. The server was quick to take our drink order; however, he told me that he had to check to make sure they had the stuff to mix my drink. Which is fine - i get that, but he disappeared for 10 minutes after that and never confirmed whether or not I had to choose a different drink. I watched him flirt and socialize with different employees before he returned to our table with drinks in hand.

After that we had to wait an additional 10 minutes to have our order taken. The food came pretty quickly after that. The bacon wrapped scallops were really tasty, but you only get 4 scallops that were on the small side for $14, so it was a bit overpriced. The lobster bisque was very well done... would have preferred more lobster chunks instead of the slivers, but I was grateful for what was there compared to the crab soup that my spouse got. There wasn't any discernable piece of crab to be found in the otherwise tasty veggie soup. Maybe it was just the portions we were given... not sure.

We ordered the garlic blue crab, peel and eat shrimp, homemade potato salad, and onion rings. The potato salad was excellent! The onion rings were battered nicely, but they would have been much better if paired with some kind of cheese dipping sauce. When we asked for that, we were told that the only sauces available were salad dressings, which was disappointing. The shrimp was tasty, decently sized and portioned for the price. We were rather disappointed with the crab. We were given 3 blue crabs smothered in a garlic sauce. Maybe blue crab is small in nature, but the actual meat inside the crab was mushy and difficult to extract from the shell. We are used to eating snow, dungeness, and king crab, so we didn't really consider the crab to be an accurate reflection of the restaurant's abilities. 

As we live in North Las Vegas, and stopped by this place because we were in the area, I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon. However, if a location opens up closer to us, we would consider returning to try other items on the menu.",HvxtWwaiQw0yu32Dc6NRmQ,0,0,3,1zl5smHwHwERfl4JlkwypQ

The guy, Richard who took out orders and brought the food out was probably having a bad day?  When he dropped off the food, he just left and didn't check back on us until he brought the check and clear out the plates. Oh and we couldn't flag him down as he was either chatting with someone at the other end of the room or he would have his head buried in His phone at the front desk.  

So when I finally had a chance to catch his attention on my way to the bathroom and he was carrying the empty plates back to the kitchen, I asked him why the oysters were so shriveled and dry, with no brine AT ALL... his response? Oh we fly it in fresh and it's not dry. I pulled up the pics I took of the horrible oysters and he then somewhat looked like he would say something to ""fix the issue"" BUT to my shock, he blurred out: ""why did you not tell me before?"" Ugh!  Really?  It's my fault that you didn't do YOUR job and served us old lame dry oysters & you still blame it on me for saying something in hope you would fix it and not get a scathing review?

Instead of buying it through groupon and having them get a 50% cut on their end.  So I went it and mentioned it to the waiter. He told me I had to buy it first through groupon, AND I had to wait 4 hours before I can use it. I asked why , because that doesn't make any sense. And thats when he told me ""Groupon just doesn't allow us to have the vouchers used right away"" ..... okay but thats not true. And whoever in there thinks its a brilliant idea to lie to customers is an idiot. I have a business myself and am a groupon merchant. So I know exactly how it works and it does not require a 4 hour wait to use. It doesn't even take a person who is a merchant to know that. It's obviously a setup to force the customer to pay full price. Which is not really an issue for me , but they way the business is shady about it and lying to people is not a good way to make customers. I wanted to use the groupon to try the food, see how I like it (regardless of the bad reviews) and if I like it, ill come back and ill be happy to pay full price. I understand that the business is trying to make it and would prefer to have full paying customers, but heres the thing, What's better? $30 bucks plus a good tip ( especially to compensate for the groupon) or $0 ?

This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.  
I had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad.
The low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???",IX8mam81dgMmRS9TZWRLyQ,2,0,2,kswWZ39Ov1OviwExqWnoOg

Walked in to place an order to-go and was not greeted or acknowledge by any worker for about 7 minutes.  Within the six minutes I grabbed a menu and stood by the podium to place in order.  I saw 3 employees during that time one which helped another person sitting down that was waiting before me.  The other two went to the podium to grab something only to walk away right after.  Another person walked in and was acknowledged immediately by a waiter.  It was only until this time the waiter said ""we will
be right with you.""  

As for the food, I ordered a few female crabs and the crawfish special.  The crabs were excellent 4.5/5 as expected.  The crawfish was slightly bland but I guess that's how it is normally cooked with that style.  I asked if the crawfish were live but when I started eating it I found a few about less than a pound that had signs of being dead and old such as being mushy or black mush inside the crawfish with no meat.

Overall, the crab were delicious, crawfish was less than mediocre, but the service was abysmal.  Plus side is when you finally get to order they come out in 10 minutes or less.",uhrThdcB_cfX9o-urj8wzA,1,0,2,YondQICNx4EoRtbwwDuM4w

We ordered 18 blue crabs, a dozen of oysters, 2 lbs of clams, 1 lb of mussels, and a bunch of other items.. the food was ok (a little disappointed since they ran out of the female blue crabs). However, towards the end, I had my last piece of clams and when I opened it up, it was all dirt and black color. I don't even know what it is. So i ask the manager, same guy unfortunately (Jeremy) and asked him what it was. Sure enough, same attitude with the response stating ""well, its probably dirt and you can get 1 or 2 bad ones in the batch."" Really?!? That's how he address the issue to the customer??

They have great happy hours and special days....Like on Wednesday during 9PM to 10PM, they have flip it or bill it (i think that's what they call it) but basically whatever you order during that hour (drinks, beer, food, etc...) you flip a coin and you call it. If you call it right, its FREE and if not, then pay your regular bill whatever it is. 

So.. lets see...

FOOD....good food, its not a fancy seafood place here. It's bar sooo yeah, seafood and beer and stuff. So don't wear your fancy shirt and pants. Food presentation is going to be basic, again it's not fancy, so don't whiny about presentation. The food here is fresh. I come here usually for happy hour because they have $4 blue crabs and $1 oyster. Its good, but the oyster are so small you need to order 2 dozen just to make you feel you ate a dozen oyster. 

PRICE....its seafood, some dish are cheap and others are little expensive just depending what type of seafood you order. 

PLACE...lots of parking, TV, chairs and tables. they have 3 side in that restaurant: one side is for the bar, other is for the restaurant and they also have outside tables. 

STAFF... some are good and some are bad. The people who are bad are usually new staff. so obviously, they're still learning. So I cant really complain. Btw, read what on their shirt says...(pretty funny)!

One bad time... i had was when i order blue crab cake entree, and they had a little side salad. in that salad....a big huge dead moth....they gave me like 10% or 25 % off for that meal. But i still afraid to finish the remainder of the food, so i barely ate half of the meal. so i felt it's not fair just getting 10 or 25 % off for a meal i barely ate half of.",JjkEIRpAzESph_QOky1fYQ,3,0,3,lGLBZCU5cuErnNeYFss9FA

4855409,2014-03-08,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"This review is not meant to pan Crab Corner, but help it a bit. The food is good for the Eastern Ave. location that is more reminiscent of Eastern Ave. in Essex, but with the new location that is a bit more like Cockeysville or Reisterstown. A better location with hopefully better food. This review is also the culmination of about 10 visits over a few months. 

First of all the crabs are good. It's great to have a bit of home in Vegas but your staple can't carry the entire business. Let's look at some of the other food. The crab dip is horrendous in style and presentation. It's small French bread slices with the crab dip on the toasted bread. It needs to be a hot creamy bowl that the warm French bread is dipped into presented on a seperate basket on the side...that's how it's been every time I've ordered it in Bal'mer. Every time I order it I feel a bit cheated. 

I don't always have time to order the crabs and when taking a client there for lunch have to order off the limited menu. I end up with the shrimp salad sandwich because it's quick and easy. However, every time I order it's described as 'large spiced shrimp' and I always get it and feel cheated yet again. They are quite small and not up to normal Baltimore restaurant size (or at least what I'm use to from Little Lou's). They could be a bit bigger and offer a choice of buns like a roll since small shrimp are hard to eat on a sandwich roll in an earth-like gravity. 

The steamer sampler is good, however the crabs are female (I NEVER eat females as they decrease the population) and feel it should be mentioned on the menu before ordering. I would like to see a choice of sauces like Bertha's. You can be Bal'mer style without directly copying. 

OK, with the menu choices are kinda lax. I would like to see burgers and local favorites like crab burger or hot & Bleu burger.

I know you can't get Boh, but would like to see more local Beers like Dogfish Head IPA. It's a crab staple in MD and readily available here. 

I hope to see Crab Corner improve as it grows.",7QqH4mMwEhtZp6QJi6iWew,3,2,3,h5gOsi7_iHiRFPsp6J1l9g

We waited for 30 minutes to get a drink order. We never got the crayons I requested for my kiddos to entertain them while we waiting so long. 

The waiters take their orders from their iPhones which seem a little unprofessional. My husband requested a dozen crabs to share with my son and the waiter recommended only getting one crab per person. We waited an hour to receive our food. I ordered two appetizers and I was pleased with my food but my husband and my son were starving after finishing their one crab. We had to go get something to eat afterward.

4940583,2014-01-23,3,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"To be fair I am originally from Maryland so my standards for a place that claims to have Maryland style seafood might be high but it also meant I was super stoked to try this place out. We had a group on deal that was purchased for $15 for 25$ worth of food. Upon arrival we were seated by a hostess who took our drink orders. The server ""Richard"" came up to take our order with a smile but using his iphone. I was having dinner with my Mother and two children aged 7 and 4 . Since  the restaurant only has two items on their kids menu - Fried Shrimp or Chicken strips I was forced to get my 7 year old a adult entree of spice and peel  shrimp which turned out to be my favorite thing in the whole place. My Mother got a order of Boardwalk fries and the Annapolis Crab Dip (Sliced toasted baguette covered with rich cream cheese & crab meat) yes it was a appetizer but she ordered it as her entree and they brought it out FIRST which is a personal pet peeve of mine but hey at least they didn't let it get cold right?  The dip appeared to have tons of crab in it but it was majorly lacking flavor and the Baguettes were very chewy and not anything I would order again especially for the price . We were pleased it didn't have a artificial crab flavor. Since our server was no where to be found we weren't able to locate the Old Bay till the end our meal but it helped with the flavor a bit. I ordered the Pick 2 Combo Entree  which they have a decent number of options to pick from I went with Fried Oysters (My personal Fav anywhere that serves them) and Fried Clams which comes with two sides (I went with hush puppies and potato salad) for 12.99. I thought it was a pretty good deal $ wise. My Oysters were really good but my clams were way over cooked same with the hush puppies. When the host lady brought my food I didn't notice until I went to ask for Tartar sauce that my potato salad was missing and this is why my rating ended up being a 2 instead of a  3. I advised her that my potato salad must of been forgotten and that we were still waiting on the fries instead of a let me check on where those are or a sorry she said and I quote "" No Maam it just wasn't ready yet so it didn't get brought out""  so to me that was just really rude because I have been many places and they do not prepare potato salad made to order it's essentially just a scoop which I did eventually get . She didn't bring my tartar sauce and when I finally flagged down our server ""Richard"" he did say sorry and that he would get my potato salad and check on my Moms fries. Guess what? he brought my potato salad but didn't bring my tartar sauce which was what I wanted all along so by the time I was able to eat my yummy oysters they were cold and I was already annoyed. The boardwalk fries did finally come out once we were almost done with our whole meal but Richard was kind enough to try to rectify my upset by comping us for the fries which turned out to be somewhat of a saving grace but I still wouldn't go back to this place again. The service needs improvement and for the price the food just doesn't outweigh the slow turnover and mediocre job on the items. The peel and eat shrimp really was delicious though and if you are dying for a place where you can pick your own crab and enjoy some spicy shrimp its worth checking out but I can't say I will be back.",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,3,1,2,mL6-Esed4qblDxJMDUyS-g

I work in the plaza that Crab Corner is in and have been warned many times not to dine there.  Well, guess what? I went anyways.....and I was wrong.

We went on a Friday night and the place was absolutely amazing empty.  Despite the few people in the restaurant, service was slow and inattentive. We had a really hard time getting the server's attention.

My real issue is with the food. We started a dozen oysters, which did not taste fresh at all.  We then ordered their signature blue crap.  They offer 5 different sizes, from regular with jumbo.  Go big or go home right? We opted to for for jumbo crabs, which were 3X the price of regular crabs.  Well, we went big and had to go home anyways. The jumbo crabs were smaller than the size of my hands. There were about 3-4 bites of meat inside.  The legs were so skinny that they were practically empty. 

After spending $70 for two people, we were still hungry. We ended up going to another restaurant for more food.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,2,0,1,xlqaKRvfYRmdMPhl-dKXwg

I have been coming here since the place first opened to eat Maryland  blue crab. I'm originally from Maryland and I consider myself a professional crab eater. In other words ....I love crabs, I eat them all year around, I can crack them with my hands no utensils needed and I can eat dozens by myself.

Here are the reasons why I will never EVER never go back. ....1. The guy /cashier is soooo  soooo  soooooo rude and unprofessional. 2. The guy attempted to pick  an argument with me before the crabs were even sold. 3. The guy knew the crabs were bad when he sold them but chose to sale them anyway...integrity. 4. He tried to lie about the crabs being from Maryland. . . The crabs are from Texas. Texas?? Why advertise Maryland blue crab when they arent.  5. The meat in the crabs were mushy and he had to crack one just to see for himself. As if I was lying 6. Crabs should not be full of water..they know that but  they sell them to people anyway.   7. I ordered a dozen medium male and 2 reg females. The guy acted like he forgot I ordered to female crabs. When I turned all of them over and showed him all males he acted like he was shocked .. he didn't realize he was messing with a pro . 8. The guy tried to make me pay for the crabs even though he knew they weren't any good. 9. Because i wasnt in the mood to argue...We agreed that I would pay for 3 and my friend would pay for 3...although  ....   we ate NONE. Each one we cracked was full of water and one look or feel of the very little (light weight)...real crab eaters know what I mean when I say light weight) meat ..u can tell the meat was mushy.. 10. Even after we paid for the food we didn't eat the guy tried once again to pick an argument by making condescending statements. Once again I will NEVER ever NEVER GO BACK!!!

I came on a Tuesday and it was $2 for a medium Maryland blue crab. The guy that worked there, told me that on Thursdays it was $3 for a large Maryland blue crab. I couldn't pass up that deal. You need to get here early. Once they sell out of the crabs, that's it. You're either going to have to order another size or wait for another day. Sometimes, they don't get the crabs in, so the guy told me to call first. 

Their crabs are flown in fresh. It was so fresh, sweet, and yummy. On Tuesday, I ordered four. On Thursday, I ordered three. They were broiled with Old Bay seasoning sprinkled on the shell. They were all delicious. I also had the crab cakes. They're the best crab cakes ever. Every bite of the crab cake had chunks of meat and very little filling. It was seasoned to bring out the freshness of the crab. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. It was a huge portion and fried perfectly.

My husband doesn't like seafood so he ordered the grilled cheese sandwich that came with chips. He said the sandwich was good and stuffed with cheese. He didn't finish the chips. It might have needed more salt or seasoning. He also got the mozzarella sticks for his appetizer and polished those off. They were really good with the marinara dip.

The guys working there were really friendly. We talked story and about football. We needed directions to Trader Joe's and they were more than happy to help. One of the guys even helped me with my fantasy football pick.

I told the guy that they needed to open up a spot on Oahu. He smiled and said that the prices weren't going to be the same, shipping charges to Hawaii are horrendous. It's the story of my life.

Not that that is a bad thing, I like the quietness. It just rarely happens. The service was simple. Take your order, deliver your food, drop off the check and good bye. Nothing too special to write home about. 

Anyways, the ambiance is open and spread out, probably seemed more so since it was so slow. the menu is large with additional flip menus on the table. For happy hour we got a doze of the fresh half shell oysters for $1 each. They were delicious, served with lemon, horseradish and Marinara. 

Then, for our main lunch I got the crab cake sandwich which was so delicious it was one of those melt in your mouth experiences. It had amazing flavor and just the right amount of density to keep its form and the perfect crunch with crisp lettuce and tomato. It was also served with their home made potato chips.

I had a lapse on this trip. I am normally pretty good at taking photos of what I have eaten. I guess that my friend was a distraction. All I found in my photos was a single photo of the view from where I was sitting. Luckily, I do remember what we had eaten.

My friend doesn't eat pork, so going to a seafood place was perfect. We ordered crab cakes, calamari, soft shell crab, and fried mozzarella sticks.

I loved the crab cakes the best. They were a decent size and tasted yummy. The calamari was okay. It was slightly on the oily size. The soft shell crab was yummy, too. I am not a big fan of mozzarella sticks to begin with. I found them to be okay. I only had a couple of them.

I also ordered a Diet Pepsi to wash everything down. I got a refill, which was nice.

Our server was friendly and helpful. I have no complaints about service.

This place offers good seafood. It's not the best that I have ever had. However, if you are in Vegas and are craving seafood in a casual setting, come here.

This past Friday night was the fist night of Karate Karaoke at Crab Corner, so I was SUPER excited to come out.  I used to go to 3 Tomatoes all the time on the weekends, so it was exciting to be back.

The exterior hasn't changed at all.  The interior really hasn't either, except now they have a huge tank with live blue crab, and they've painted a little...

Now, onto the food.

Ever since my last experience at Crab Corner, I've wanted to try the crab cakes.  My fella isn't big on crab cakes, but agreed to get the appetizer (4 minis) to try.  

When they came out, I was concerned.  They are TINY...and really expensive.  
But after one bite, let me tell you, they were 100% worth the money.
There is SO MUCH CRAB MEAT IN THESE TINY BITES OF AWESOME!  This is going to be a regular item for me, I can tell.  SO delicious. 

We also had the cod, and the clams with hush puppies and fries:  Everything was delicious!  

Drinks were pretty decent...they had a $3 mystery shot, and $3 well whiskey....PBR was $4 at the beginning of the night, but I think it went down to $3 after karaoke started. 

Service was pretty good.  The bartender seemed a little abrasive at the beginning of the night, but she warmed up to us, and ended up being pretty darned cool.  

Karaoke was incredible, as usual.  The host was fun, and it was great to be singing on the patio again!

I can't wait to come back again.  Karaoke was shut down early this week, but from what I understand its supposed to be 10-2 this Friday night.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,4,4,r5VduA5OUTJLUQdmxpRukw

First of all the the calamari was very chewy, I have never had calamari that was so chewy that it made your jaw hurt. Food started to come out...we had order two lobster rolls, kids chicken fingers, clams, cheeseburger and blackened mahi mahi. Everyone food but the cheeseburger and mahi mahi came out, waited another 20 minutes or so for the burger and then another 15 for the mahi mahi.  Waited another 15 minutes for someone to come by to so I may ask for tartar sauce, after no one coming to attend to us I got up and walked over to the bar where the server was sitting on her cell phone to ask her for some tartar sauce.  Waited for another while and thought maybe they forgot about us since we had to call out if anyone was there to give us our check. I had asked prior to leaving because they already had added the gratuity which I felt was not deserved.  They had stated that their internet was down and they needed to run our cards the old way imprinted. After walking out they closed the place early due to Internet not working. I called and spoke with Rina, manager and explained how I felt I shouldn't have had to be forced to pay for the gratuity at a certain amount when the service was bad. Rina apologized and said your card was not run due to Internet being down, which I checked on my account and it wasn't. She stated that the next morning she will run it with a gratuity of my choice minus our drinks...didn't happen. Checked my account first thing and it was run first thing for the full amount. So I called. Spoke with Rina, asked what was going on, mind you she was to call me first thing this morning to give me a new total amount. She now explains that the card was ran last night, but wait I thought the Internet was down? She puts Richard on who is the higher up and he can't do anything says he has to talk to the owner. I finally said you what forget it. I just can't believe this place. Never going back for sure, be careful if they tell you their internet is not up and what they charge you. They brought out the burger without the side and when they did bring out the side it was an upgrade and here we are thinking fires comes with a burger.

That led me to try the combo fried clams and catfish plate with hush puppies.  The clams were thick and sweet but the catfish a bit dry.  The blue crab soup that came with it was delicious.

Then, I wandered over to tank of crabs which had only 3 of them.  One of the three was doing a ""headstand"", i.e. was dead.  I haven't worked in restaurants for a number of years now, but I""m pretty sure if there was a dead fish in the tank, the manager would have ordered somebody to fish it out of tank, and out of the public's view.  I had catfish for the first time in my life.  It was really good.  The corn was really good, too!  There was some type of trivia game going on where a woman was reading questions and playing music.

5599530,2013-12-28,1,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"I remember sampling this place at its original location on the Eastside about a year ago.  It has since expanded, fortunately much closer to home.  It is as good as I remember it and then some.

It went from a small local joint to a hub for sports, great food and Maryland patronage.  One of the head honcho's, I believe named Jay, was still on the front lines getting down.  During our first meeting, he was kind enough to offer us deals on flying in bulk crawfish in from the south since we mentioned that we often threw crab and crawfish boil parties.  In fact, all staff are very welcoming and good peoples.  Not too mention, it's good to see some Pinoys competing in the industry that I have learned to be cornered by some old timers and my Viet homies, especially in Cali (ie. Boiling Crab, etc.)

The menu has expanded as well.  Aside from the typical grinds from hush puppies, fish/chips, oysters and crab cakes, I noticed lots more added such as (real) crab dip and bacon wrapped scallops.  

But the fact remains, this place is built on cornering the niche that no one else has in the valley, blue crab!  Not just any old blue crab, Maryland style baby!  Although some compassion about the work expended when eating crawfish and blue crab, it's all about the entire experience, not too mention, these crabs are streamed just above rare, I can just imagine Katsumoto uttering...perrrfecct #lastsamurai.

Topped with that Maryland spice and throw in the Filipino vinegar, and you got yourself a feast line no other.  The trick is to get the large or jumbo female blue crab, that way when you pop em open, all the savory goodness can be enjoyed with a bowl of white steamed rice, gotta get yo starches in complete the meal.  Booyahh!   BTW, my wife says the (real) crab cakes here is one of the best she ever had [Drake voice].

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, happy hour starts at 2:00 p.m. and ruins until 6:00 p.m.  what a way to put a cherry on the crab cake.  I gotta go with the drafts for $3 a pop and the Crabby Mary is definitely a treat.  Just know, this place is ran by Terps, yet no turtles are served in the menu.  So if you root for the Ravens, the Terapins or anything else Marlylandish, roll through and be ready to get crackin'.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,0,4,UaRF_M3ZUlvFTK5FHOHRDQ

Gee, how in the world do I start this? 

Well first, the oysters are so small, so laughable, that when they were brought to me, I actually thought that someone pulled a prank on me.

In short, no, no one pranked me. There was no candid camera, no Ashton Kutcher running to me to tell me that I was punk'd, and I'm not entirely sure if it could have been John Qui√±ones from 'What would you do?' running out of scenarios. 

I also ordered a lobster roll, which was a poor amount of lobster to justify the cost, in what seemed to be a garlic bread bun....like, garlic bread from the supermarket freezer that you throw in the oven. Ok so maybe I was setting my expectations too high, I had gone to the Westgate the previous night and had a top notch lobster roll there for relatively the same price, and was craving another one closer to home.... but that to me was a sad excuse for what a lobster roll should be.

I ended up getting a ""Combo Platter"" which is your choice of (all fried) cod, shrimp, oysters, catfish, clams or chicken strips. I asked if I could get steamed/boiled shrimp instead of fried since I didn't want to consume so much fried food but was told no. Unless your body is used to eating massive amounts of fried food you may want to steer clear of this. I felt awful and hated myself the rest of the day. 

Our server, Jared, was well past the 'unhelpful' threshold and operated in the 'rude' category. Here's a fun exchange showing how helpful he was (verbatim):
Me: How much are 6 crabs?
Jared: They are priced by the dozen.
Me: How much are a dozen?
Jared: What size?
Me: ?...Medium.
Jared: $64
I think this whole exchange could have been shortened. But granted he did then tell me 6 would be $32 since I apparently don't look like the type that can do complex math with the facts thus provided. 

As I awaited him to come by so I could request the check, the ample time allowed me to check-in and find a deal for ""any beer for $3""! Thanks Yelp! I asked to apply that to my bill as well as inform him we'd be using a Living Social. He balked at this saying you can only use one ""discount"". I scoffed right back so I was allowed to use both after a talk with the manager...""but just this once.""

Now I'm not sure if anyone else is with me, but I don't consider Groupons or Living Socials ""discounts"". They are marketing tools made 1) to get customers into the restaurant, 2) are pre-purchased, and 3) are known sunk costs. Whereas discounts/coupons are used to get people in but that's where the similarities end - they do not know how many people will take advantage of it, etc. Who's with me?

5902588,2017-09-11,0,ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,"My original bad review was removed for lack of specificity.  So here is the original review with all the detail a person could want:

Skip it ... trust me.  Bad food bad service, bottomless mimosas were 90% orange juice.  

(1) Skip it: if you are looking to try somewhere new my recommendation is that this place should not make the list.  I was not impressed with the food the service or the overall experience.  

(2) Trust me:  with extended family in Pennsylvania and Maryland I spend my summers growing up in the northeast.  My grandmother made Maryland crab cakes at home, and we tried the Maryland crab cakes at dozens of establishments across Maryland.  I am no expert but I can tell the difference between good and bad crab. 

(3) Bad food: we started with the bacon wrapped scallops.  The bacon was charred and the scallops were so overdone they were rubbery and difficult to chew (if you haven't had scallops they should not be rubbery or chewy).  We then had crab dip which was not dip at all.   It was mushy crab goo piled onto small slices of bread.  The flavor left a lot to be desired and the consistency was the straw that broke the camels back.  After a bite I opted to move onto the next thing.  Now the true disappointment, the crab Benedict.  Let me first say, I LOVE crab Benedict ... just not this one.  I didn't know you could butcher the concept of fresh crab, hollandaise sauce and a poached egg, but crab corner figured out how to.  I made it about halfway through before I gave up.  The flavor left something to be desired on every front.  

(4) Bad service: here is the kicker.  Had the the service been great I might have overlooked the bad food, but it simply wasn't.  There were 2 male servers sharing the responsibilities for the restaurant.  They tried to be attentive (I think) but failed miserably.  We went long periods with empty drinks (mimosas that were supposed to be bottomless, sodas, tea and water too), and plates on the table that needed to be cleared.  I also respect that many places have a limit to bottomless mimosas, but it would be nice if the only notice of that was not a waiter (who had been previously ignoring us) announcing with a less than polite tone ""you've got 20 minutes left, do you want anything else or are you done?!""  Sure let us know we're coming to the end of our bad experience, thanks, but at least do it politely!  Our server did finally crack a smile at the end of our meal, but by then it was too late. 

(5) As for the mimosas, maybe some people like a mostly orange juice with a splash of champagne.  I on the other hand, do not.  But I'll let you judge this on your own should you choose to make a trip to this skippable restaurant.  

I imagine that it's reasonable to have a review removed that's not specific enough, but I doubt anybody is asking to have reviews removed that say ""this place is great"" without any details.  So I hope this review had all the details you ever wanted about my bad experience.  Happy dining!",G-UVWZAeJ2VUwotpjXipvw,6,2,1,uq9plxrumEjlfXRh9G_cnw

They get fresh seafood in everyday and the quality rings true. I've had crab , shrimp, and the soft shell crab here. Soft shell is just a favorite of mine and l don't know of any establishment here that does it better .",RzMq9tHzxZoo3bHfn8Vu1w,0,0,5,Ckbluk6lq1UC8f_1kz5H2Q
