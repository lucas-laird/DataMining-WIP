We tried the Godfather and Blue Balls Special and both dishes as we say in Hawaii was ""broke da mouth"" or ""simply delicious!""  

It was a definite change from the normal massive plate lunches that were so accustomed to eating growing up in the islands.  Every once in awhile you crave that change in taste and Haulin Balls served that desire!  Their unique meatball wraps were fresh, very light, healthy, and extremely tasty.  The portions were perfect and left the three of us content.

Ultimately, customer service for me makes or breaks a business.  Everyone from the cooks to the cashier were very friendly, genuine and sincere, in Hawaii we call that the ""Aloha spirit.""   

Hoku in Hawaiian means Star and 'elima means 5.

As for the food, 2 of us shared the Zorba, Porky, Mac n' Cheese, and fries courtesy of the Yelp check-in.

Zorba: Quite tasty! It has all the traditional flavors of a classic Mediterranean dish packed into 2 compact balls, shoved into a sandwich. The tzatziki sauce was well flavored and the red onions in the sandwich weren't too strong or overpowering, as they can be sometimes. My only complaint was that the lamb meatballs were a little smoother in texture than I like, but they still tasted good.

Porky: This is a pretty standard pulled pork sandwich. They pile on the meat and it's super tender and juicy. The sandwich was so juicy that the bun was falling apart beneath it. Definitely be prepared to get your hands dirty.

Mac n' Cheese: It's flavored with truffle oil and I really liked this one because it had a light hint of truffle, but it wasn't too strong. It also has a nice crispy crumble on top of it for a little crunch.

So far, it seems like Nevada has some pretty good food trucks to offer. I can't wait to be back to try their BBQ pork nachos next time!",-LEJFq5RC0rQAG831uYRKg,2,2,4,6mkcB7mImNfaXnyYXY3sSg

The menu was not clear, like they had to erase stuff off of it, but said the item would be there in a half hour, but I never saw it. Then there was an item description, but no name. When I inquired about the description she simply put my order in for it. Turns out I was referring to the zorba. Ordinarily I'd say something, but it was such a pain to inquire/redeem/explain the check-in offer that I was over it. She did not know anything about the check in offer, but said she'd gladly give it to me. When I went to get my food there were no fries. The cook was like sorry, but I don't see any fries on here. I mean, you two are right next to each other. What's going on? So eventually I get my fries, but no one said, ""Here they are!"" I had to go up there and be like, ""Are those fries mine?"" Anyway, the food was just okay.

Thai meatballs: Two meatballs not especially large wrapped in lettuce that was brown and wilted on the edges. I mean, I'm still well, and it was inexpensive, but that sucks. The actual meatballs were sweet. I wish it was bigger.

Mac&Cheese: Very rich and tasty. This was the least disappointing part of my meal. The sauce was thick and the portion was just right. Pretty good for $4.

Sweet Potato Tots: Not too sweet and great with ketchup.

Ugh and the music! What torture! Even on the flippin' website.

My first visit I drove across town only to find they closed/left early.  At least send out a tweet or something. It was disappointing but things happen.

My second visit I caught them at Saturday Night Truck stop and got the Maryland Crab balls.  I believe they were $8 or $9.  Crab is expensive so I went with it.  I got two very small balls on a piece of wilted lettuce.  The balls were bite size.  The flavor was good.  I just felt they were to small for the price and the lettuce was unappetizing.  

I decided to give them another try.  I kept seeing people tweeting about their bbq pork nachos.  I went to Vegas Streats and they were sold out.  That made me want them more so I finally tracked them down a few weeks later and got a order.  The flavors were good.  Maybe it was built up to much in my mind I expected more.  They advertise fresh homemade chips but I got cheap yellow tortilla chips.  I mean if your going buy store bought at least get some good ones.  They really ruined the nachos.

2659678,2012-11-25,5,YZ4P5I-OsQxVVoTENo1OAg,"Balls are an often unappreciated entity: not here my friends, not here. The guys were super friendly and generously came out to support the Yelp/Johnny Fontane's Sandy Fundraiser. They brought a bevy of balls along...Zorba (lamb) & the rest are in picture of cool sign (which changed colors to the delight of my raging ADHD) 

Being pescetarian, I had one ""ball"" choice this evening: the much lauded Dragon Balls (spicy tuna with a spicy sauce) the inside reminded me more of crab cakes, but I enjoyed the flavor profile. My only problem was one of the (3) balls was so rock hard, it was impenetrable and inedible, at $9 ordinarily I'd have returned it (and am quite sure the guys would have gladly given me another one of their balls) but since this was a charity event, I let it go. The sweet potato tots ($3) were a delicious, huge portion I shared with fellow philanthropic Yelpers. 

Misti got the Barnyard Pimp Sticks (gargantuan portion of barbecued pulled chicken over thin crispy fries) that she enjoyed; smelled and looked fantastic. Tien also had the Dragon Balls and I know Mario and many other Yelpers hit up the truck for more ball offerings throughout the night. 

So, while my one wayward ball was disappointing: in all, I found the food tasty, the service on point (and very kind) so I rounded up and look forward to tasting more of their balls in the future: blue balls and falafel are on my radar. 

Thanks again for sharing your unique and creative balls and supporting a great cause. They also take credit cards = score!

Tender juicy meatballs covered in tangy marinara, melty mozzarella and a chiffonade of basil. The bread is soft and holds the sauce well. Its still a bit messy, but I don't think it would be a worthy meatball sandwich if it was not. I like putting extra garlic on mine and for me one is enough. I cannot say enough about the ""crack and cheese"" as they like to call it. Truly is quite addicting. The noodles are not overdone, the cheese sauce is nice and creamy (garlicky too!) and the breadcrumbs on top are a nice touch.

My bf had their Zorba with the lamb meatballs he said it was good but after tasting my Gotdfather was quite impressed and liked it much better.

3519450,2011-07-24,1,YZ4P5I-OsQxVVoTENo1OAg,"Forget about all the ball jokes. This is one food truck that should be taken seriously because of their tasty eats. The Godfather was a hit -- 2 ground beef meat balls with fresh basil, parsley, garlic, onions, pomodoro sauce, pecorino romano, and plenty of melted mozzarella in a soft, chewy bun. The savory meatballs had plenty of depth in flavor and were perfectly tender, not mushy.

The Zorba (ground lamb, fresh mint, oregano, parsley, garlic, served with a tomato-olive spread, lettuce, feta, red onion and homemade tzatziki sauce) was decent, but the taste of the lamb wasn't overly appealing. I did enjoy the olive spread and appreciated the subtlety of the mint, but I don't think it's a sammie I'd get again.

The pricing is as follows: 1 for $5, 2 for $9, or 3 for $12. Two sandwiches should be enough for most people, but if you're really hungry, add on a side. I was starving so I got an order of skin-on fries ($2).

When I first received my sandwich I was already discouraged at the size because it was rather small. It had 2 balls and was probably half the size or a regular sized hoagie. For the price of $5, this should have been at least long enough to hold 3 to 4 balls. The flavors were good, but were a little weak. A cucumber sauce would have been nice. Although the worst part was the taste of the meat because it was a little off. I've had lamb in gyros and this taste was very different. Unfortunately it wasn't pleasant. The bread was practically on the verge of being soggy, maybe they should toast it on the grill before serving?

FOOD:
I ordered the Zorba, Fried Ravioli, and Fried Mac n Cheese bites (not listed on their website).  The Zorba didn't have enough seasoning, too much olive, and was only on half a sandwich roll.  When the food was ready, I was so confused on the size of the Zorba for the cost (of $8).  You get two meatballs and half a bread roll... great... 
The fried ravioli and mac n cheese bites were okay but then again they didn't make the food since it was pretty much store bought and they just deep fried it for you.  

SERVICE:
The service was okay.  The employee that took our order was polite but it what i didn't like was that she took forever doing the math.  She actually made circle dots on her order sheet and counted them to give me the total... really?!?!

A few First Fridays ago, a friend and I went on a quest to find the food truck with a funny name, but couldn't find it. We asked at the info tent and they said they saw the truck pull up, but there wasn't enough room, so they left. We checked Facebook/Twitter, but they hadn't posted anything. That would have been a good way to let people know they weren't there! We ended up at Roamin' Dough and had delicious meatball sacks (she said sack.)
This Friday, we finally found our balls! (Heehee.) They had two types: Godfather and Zorba. We decided on the Godfather. We asked the gal how big her balls were (heehee, I'll stop now) and she said they were big enough to share. We were glad because $10 for a meatball sandwich sounded a bit high. She then informed us they were out of cheese...mozzarella AND feta. Blah. We went ahead and ordered it to share, along with some sweet potato tots.
Are you kidding me? Ten bucks for TWO average sized meatballs on half a sub roll? It needed more sauce and the cheese sure would have been nice. The meatball itself was flavorful, but the texture was a bit gristly (granted, I am super picky about my meat.) The sweet potato tots were fine, but nothing magical for $3.
I'm bummed. I REALLY wanted to like Haulin' Balls. It's not that it was BAD, it was just overpriced and I don't get how you run out of cheese at 8:30pm at First Friday! You kind of know it's going to be busy!",81l-HFm3v1IKXvhSQoUBPw,1,1,2,JLOJoklGVVRFlOlh2pKJ5g

There are 4 types currently on the menu (Godfather, Zorba, All Thai'd Up, and Porky(, sides like skin on fries, sweet potato tots, and truffle mac&cheese. There was something on their handout about a ""blue ball special"" but I didn't inquire about the funny name. 

The BF and I tried the ""All Thai'd Up"" which is turkey meat, veggies, sweet chili sauce in a lettuce wrap. One serving came with two wraps with maybe 4 meatballs in each. The meatballs were small, but juicy and the thai sauce was pretty good. We also got the sweet potato taters ($3) and these had a great texture with a nicely crisp outside and moist, sweet inside. I'm normally not a fan of plain sweet potato fries, but these were slammin on their own without a dip.

I like that they have different flavors for everyone and are always working on new things. 

I've had the Godfather (italian style, beef meatball), Zorba (greek, lamb), and All Thai'd Up (thai, turkey), and the Porky (BBQ, pulled pork).  The leaner meats are a bit drier than the beef and pulled pork, but the garnishes and sauces really punch the flavors to match the themes. The ingredients always look, smell and taste fresh (a happy five senses makes a happier meal, eh?). Make sure you get plenty of basil, it always seems to be so pungent (in the best way) and set off the rest of the food.

I order them all protein style, so no bread for me, and the additional lettuce adds an extra freshness/crispness that really makes it for me. Meatball sandwiches aren't the lightest fare, but this is an easy and delicious way to alleviate some of the heaviness (especially in the summer!).

The sweet potato tots are tasty and their mac n' cheese is really a treat. I might like it with a little more crunch on top but, even as it is, you get a creamy, cheesy, and very flavorful incarnation of an all time favorite.

I just wish this fine sandwich would be bigger, but one can always buy and down two of them.

French Fries here are made with frozen skin-on potatoes, but they tasted very good with Heinz Tomato Ketchup drizzled on them.  The ketchup and napkins were thoughtfully provided by a Haulin Balls staffer.  Both the order taker/money collector and cook were friendly and hospitable.  Ordered food was served up 10 minutes after the order was placed, but this will largely depend on how large the crush of patrons is.

After checking out their menu, which made everything sounds so delicious, I ended up ordering the All Thai'd Up. Which was an Atkins diet friendly turkey balls with veggies in lettuce wraps, dressed with Sweet Chili Sauce.  One order comes with two wraps with a slightly larger than golf ball size turkey ball in each wrap (although Jade mentioned in her review she was getting maybe 4 small meatballs in each wrap). The overall flavor was good, kind of like a Thai or Vietnamese salad featuring ground turkey balls as the protein.

The concept of selling meatball sandwiches from a food truck is definitely a unique one (thus far) in Las Vegas.

A fellow Yelper who ordered the Zorba (Lamb Balls) really enjoyed his sandwich, especially after making sure it was not lamb 'balls"".  Although some others were decidedly disappointed at this.  Or maybe they were disappointed that the Blue Balls Special were not on the menu today.

Anyway, like Jade W wrote in her FTR review of Haulin Balls, their pricing is petty simple. One sandwich for $5, two for $9 and three for $12 ($4 each) and you can mix and match your sandwich order.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,0,3,TNlEhQhahKEb6aYjVxBCcg
