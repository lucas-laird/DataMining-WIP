Nor should it be so salty that you could swim in it, saving yourself a trip to the dead sea.

My order:  Crab Rangoons, Hot and Sour Soup and Spicy Pad Thai.

Crab Rangoons were HORRIBLE.  Very soggy and very FLAT.

Hot and Sour Soup:  It was hot, fresh from the stove but had no spicy heat to  it at all.  I ordered it extra spicy.  It also was not sour.  It was edible and since I waited two hours for my order I was VERY hungry.  I ate it.

Spicy Pad Thai.  The menu says ""Pad Thai""  It does not say ""shrimp, or chicken"" on the menu and they don't give you a choice.  I ""assumed"" it was veggie pad thai and any meat would be by request.  I'm Vegetarian.  I get the pad thai and it is full of chicken and shrimp!! Ok..fine...I picked it all out.  I'm dying from starvation by this time. LOL I dig in..and the only thing that was ""pad thai"" was the noodles.  There was no flavor, no spice, it was just greasy noodles.  That went straight into the trash.

I wish I could give this place ""minus"" stars! Won't ever order from there again.

Lucky for us, Subway and Ho Ho Ho are right next to each other. The kid who wanted Subway must have read the Yelp reviews and knew to go with the sandwich. Lucky her. 

After a quick stop at Subway , we walked like three steps over to Ho Ho Ho. Ordered beef and broccoli lunch special with chow mien, and a large entree size Mongolian beef. The food was not great but I've had worse (China Tango, I'm talking to you. Oh wait, they were so bad, they shut down some time ago.). My gripe really is with the portion size. We barely had any meat in either the beef and broccoli or the Mongolian beef. Paying $20 for a lunch special plus an entrée, I expect more than 4 pieces of meat in each dish. Of the two meat dishes, the Mongolian beef was the bigger disappointment in that it was mostly onion. Like an entire onion sliced up. Not good. At all.  

Also, the restaurant was super smoky. Soda foundation was sticky, like greasy sticky.

His was nice and hot except for the rice which after you put sauce on is ok. I have never ever gotten sweet n sour sauce that was stone cold. Not even warm. Over cold rice not good. The batter on the chicken is very thick and heavy same used on the fried shrimp which my husband had no flavor. Will save for left over tomorrow and heat up my self maybe it will be better. Should have asked for some chinese mustard or plum sauce for the shrimp usually it comes with some kind of sauce. Delivery was on time and driver was very nice. Too bad really wanted to find a good place for chinese take out.,fnIItxznQHlG1s_HoJzEQg,1,0,2,9np4mfK6UClfabg2Xi8tDg
2625864,2014-01-19,0,prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA,"I stopped in this small Chinese place while my car was being worked on next door. Since moving to Vegas from the Bay Area I have had serious cravings for really good, authentic Chinese food. Specifically Egg Drop (Flower) Soup. I was impressed by the portions. I ordered a small ($2) and it was a huge serving - enough for two meals. The soup itself was full of flavor and so good, but it really lacked the extra corn and peas I'm used to having in it. I added on a side of steamed rice ($1) and some veggie egg rolls (2.50) to go along with it. The rice was somewhat stale... like it had been a day or two old, but again a massive serving. The egg rolls were slightly under-cooked but they were flavorful. 

The service is fair, the young man was nice but not overly friendly. After I got my food I found him sitting at a side station watching a movie or something on his cell phone. 

The cleanliness of the place is really lacking which is why I deducted stars, it is legit filthy in there. The soda machine is sticky and covered in dust, the tables are dirty, and the salt/pepper shakers look like they've NEVER been cleaned. 
Also, I dined in while waiting for my car and food was served on paper/styrofoam and plastic utensils. I thought maybe it was an accident until another customer dining in got the same thing...didn't really bother me (especially since I'm sure the to go plates are cleaner than a real plate would be there) but I think it's something to mention (not gourmet at all). 

All in all, if you can get past the cleanliness issues and just get your food delivered or to go, it's actually pretty decent. Although, I wouldn't recommend any seafood or meat items, the place is seriously dirty and I would question their practice of safe meat handling.",oTLY1xiJBheerlvuulXocQ,0,0,2,4Z_Yqs5B1s7N9cQApi3-Qg

2786719,2012-10-22,0,prHnRsgY-PuM7vxe8-RwEA,"Okay, I'm from the NYC. Chinese food there has its own unique style not found really anywhere else. So for me to compare, restaurants I've been to outside the city never really match up or do it justice. It certainly (NYC style I mean)  isn't ""authentic Chinese"" as in it typically isn't where the Chinese people tend to go. Of course that isn't the case in Chinatown, the Manhattan or Brooklyn Chinatown (we have two.) Anywho, this place isn't bad and out of several restaurants we've tried here this comes close to NyC style in a lot of respects but they're. Not perfect by any means. The selections we've tried we're limited so I will definitely try other items. 

The Chow Fun which is a broad rice noodle was comparable to anything I've had in NY. the fried rice was at 60% but would order again. The sweet and sour shrimp was awful. It was extremely greasy and for a 1.5"" shrimp it was covered in 5"" of heavy batter... A very bad no no. This was extremely off putting as we're the egg rolls, free with a $10+ order. They're not NY style egg rolls by any stretch of the imagination. They're more like spring rolls which are usually light and airy, but these were dripping with oil. I wrapped it one in a paper towel and set it aside for an hour. The remaining towel was completely translucent with oil and I could probably tie it to a branch and use as a torch next time I'm in a cave. 
I had the food delivered took less than a hour not too bad,but the driver who got $5 bucks as a tip was not rude, but curt and didn't seem thankful. He called me from outside my. Apartment door asking me what my apt number was I told him and he said he was outside. I said I'll be right there and went to through on a pair of shorts and a tee all about 20 seconds and the doorbell starts going off. I open the door and he was in mid-dial calling me again... SERIOUSLY!!!!

All in all I will order the Chowfun again. Never the S/S shrimp or egg rolls. I've heard the general Tso chicken is good so I'd go for that. I think I will try a new dish here and there to whittle down my list but other than that , I'd recommend the place but caution folks to be careful.

Wifey and I went for lunch one weekend on a whim since we were nearby.  We always passed it on Sundays near church and finally figured, ""Eh, why the Hell not?""  Well...I now know why.

Place is not busy AT ALL.  I should take that as a sign like I usually do.  The prices seemed good enough to warrant a lunch special or 2, so that's what we did.  Ordered:

*Shrimp with Lobster Sauce
*Pork Egg Foo Young

Lunch specials come with fried wonton, crab Rangoon, steamed or fried rice, or lo mein noodles.  Value for sure at under $7 for each special.  But that's about where all the good ends.

Food itself?  OMG - soooooo salty!  Soooooo artificially saucy!!!!!  Thick sauces over everything!  The Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was just WEIRD - clearish sauce with barely any shrimp in it, mixed with some random veggies.  Sauce didn't even taste like lobster!  No other taste but salty.  Pork Egg Foo Young was a ruse as well.  Totally frozen-type egg foo young patties fried (in old oil possibly since they were greasy), then topped with some dark soy-based salt that was you guessed it, SALTY.  Even worse, no pork at all in the egg foo young!  The little pork bits were in the SAUCE!  Who does that?  That's how I could tell their egg foo young was a frozen product and not at all fresh.  It wasn't very tasty.  The accompanying lo mein noodles we chose that came with the lunch special was no good either.  Basically noodles with some of their sweet (but still salty) teriyaki-ish sauce!  No veggies added!  Bah.  The fried wontons and crab Rangoon were basically an afterthought too, soggy.

We're lucky we had bottles of water with us for lunch because oh boy, we really needed them.  So much water to balance out all that salt!  

About the only thing Ho Ho Ho Chinese GOURMET has going for them is their prices.  The food?  Not gourmet.

A friend I met out here suggested the place Ho Ho Ho to me.  When I found out where it was located, I was very happy as it was a mere 6 minutes up the road from my parents house in Summerlin!

The General Tso's chicken that I ate was absolutely amazing! Very much like the General Tso's chicken I frequented from a place when I was in college during my last two years!  Yes, there's often a lot of breading more than chicken itself, but they've actually managed to modify the recipe over the last couple years to be a perfect, even distribution of both.

They also used to serve the chicken in a paper carton, and now they serve it in a nice easy to manage plastic container with a lid to secure the freshness!

They are also one of the only places I frequent that has duck sauce packets which I'm always dousing my steamed rice in!

I'm proud to say that I have been ordering from Ho Ho Ho for 10 years now and they can always rely on me to get my usual 'General Tso's chicken, no veggies, with steamed rice, pot stickers, and a Diet Coke!'",m8d1HYOCF8WCfO3AuwiJSw,2,1,4,P7oLeiwlJZm-t56Qsw8oRg

The other food is over sauced, salty, and i must say i was underwhelmed.

We met the owner after having asked if its a family owned business. They hired workers who didn't feel like carrying on their dreams and weren't too kind to the customers, but the owner was super kind and helpful.

Pros: 

 People were quite nice
 Did Chinese carry out, which usually has a bad rep, but this was the most authentic place I've been to that also offers delivery and such
 They were honest that their soda machine was broken and gave us free canned soda

Cons:

 Needs an update, a tad old-ish
 Needs a dusting, display items have grey spots from it
 Food wise, it was a bit dry but they weren't overdone with sauces and fillers like other places try to do 

Overall not a bad experience",GJ80erkFPvOPoA1LnpRouQ,0,0,4,9yVb6IUoeDybx_uTdrmQ5g

I made the mistake of using their restroom after I had just placed my order for garlic shrimp.

It was dirty, the sink had black dirt residue it was so filthy and the bathroom is also used as a storage facility. Although they had toilet seat covers in boxes, they were not stocked for use.

I was on lunch at work and decided on the garlic shrimp w/lo mein soft noodles.

There was very little shrimp, it was mostly water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I really think it should be named garlic mushroom because that was all it was.

The lo mein noodles were even horrible as they were way too salty, thick and dry with zero flavor.

That was my first and last visit!

I have had some bad chinese food in the past however this really is the worst I have ever had no doubt!

It is an insult to associate the word gourmet in any way, shape or form with this disaster of a ""chinese"" restaurant.
