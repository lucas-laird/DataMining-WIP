The food and service is really good. My bartender has been friendly and attentive. I ate the combo shrimp and chicken fajitas. I would definitely get it again. The toffee brownie for dessert was delicious. The best part is that they have normal food and drink prices. Even a good happy hour. The restaurant is also within walking distance from most of the hotels(there's not much for parking).

At this time I walked to the bar so I could put a order in for happy hour. The server arrived to the table after I got back from the bar and informed me that she would need to check and see if she would be able to get us the happy hour price on our food. She then went to talk with her manager, came back and said that her manager would discount the first round to happy hour prices, but ""After that your on your own"". She then took our order, in my opinion she had little knowledge of the menu. The appetizer arrived no problem, we had the table side guacamole. I would say the food followed it out by no more than 5 minutes. The food was set on the table without asking if there was anything else we needed or wanted. My wife wanted some ranch dressing and mayonnaise, it probably took us another 10 minutes to track a server down to get that. The server that I finally got up and asked for help, said he would get it but he was busy with his own tables, so he tracked her down to get it for us. I would say it probably took us another 15 minutes to get the mayonnaise and ranch, at this point my wife's food wasn't hot anymore. Our server made a timely appearance when our meal was completed to ask if we were ready for our dessert (we ordered the 3 for me special). Our check and dessert were delivered together, she highlighted the 18% gratuity and wrote on the check ""Not included"". My wife and I tip 18%-20%, for her to put this on this check when she obviously made our experience less than I'm sure what Chilis expectations are.

This chilis is located on top of another restaurant, so you have to go around the building and up the stairs to actually enter this chili's. 

I've been to many of these restaurants. However, this is not one of the better ones. We both ordered fajitas and the quality was not the best. The portions were okay, but the portions of the sides were really small. Overall, the flavor just wasn't there either. But, recommend the cheddar cheese bites as appetizers and the endless chips and salsa.

When we walked in, the bar looked pretty cool, so we just sat down.  

It was nice and chill, and there were lots of TVs.  And it it was on a Sunday, and it looked liked they had the NFL cause most of the games were on. 

The food was good here too. Got the Top Shelf Enchiladas.  It came with rice and blacks beans, which were surprisingly good.  

But I think the best part about this place was that prices weren't too bad, compared to the typical strip prices.  All the meals were reasonably priced. And It was only $5 for a large beer.  They have a happy hour special on Sundays too.

I think it's in a great location too.  It's right across from the Aria.  It has a nice patio seating area that looks like it has a pretty good view of the strip.

All in all, it was pretty good experience, and I would recommend it to people and families that want to get a great and not ""break the bank"" meal.",bH2EMPAtfyNsFsQDJcPEkg,0,0,5,-SQ_k9_hM2r-KgOAXxZXdw

Otherwise, the $10 fee would have been a waste.

Mom and I shared the loaded chicken fajitas and a triple dipper with southwest eggrolls, honey chipotle chicken strips and the sliders. The fajitas are a total joke. They taste like a Lean Cuisine. Seriously. The chicken tastes boiled and you can tell the ""grill marks"" are artificial. The peppers and onions underneath were soggy and either steamed or boiled. What's worse is the cheese sauce on top. It had no flavor. We filled up on our chips and salsa and my triple dipper, even though the chicken was cold. Whatever.

1421021,2014-12-30,0,PMOlf91mjpkWRiZa5hEr-A,"My friends and I were staying in the Aria across the street and decided to go to Chili's for dinner before the Blue Man Group show.

We arrived around 7:15 and were told that it would be a 15 minute wait for a group of 4 people. The place looked dead so we didn't understand the wait. We ended up being seated in a booth where half of it was open and facing the people waiting for a table. Slightly awkward eating your food with people watching you and waiting for their own table. Our waitress was nice, but it seemed like the service was just SLOW. It took 20 minutes just to get our appetizers (pretzel sticks and chips and dip). One of my friend's order came out wrong. And when we wanted our check, we had to flag down someone else to get it. We got charged full price for the appetizers instead of the Happy Hour price like we were told at the beginning. Then we went to the bar separately to get to-go drinks and THAT took another 15 minutes to make 3 drinks (a cosmo and 2 margaritas). At this point it was 9:00 pm and the place still seemed kind of dead... So we were still wondering why the service was slow. 

So much for going early enough to eat before our show. We got to the theater right before the doors opened. It should not take 2 hours to get 3 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees (travel time walking to the restaurant and back not included).",s8Wj2KOvgURyxnViMKiy2g,0,0,2,kfJXT5TR_6H12dj_TGCAaQ

1618927,2014-10-26,3,PMOlf91mjpkWRiZa5hEr-A,"I noticed this shiny new Chili's on a recent trip to the Aria.  I LOVE a good buffalo chicken salad so I was pretty excited, but with so many great restaurants in the area, I figured I'd save my Chili's fix for the O'Hare airport (my favorite homecoming treat).

One morning/afternoon, after a really fun night out, I found the big red chili pepper, like a beacon in the night, calling me across the street for some 1000 calorie salad goodness.  I wanted to zip over real quick, pick up take out, and come right back to my room.  I have had the Chili's app on my phone for awhile in hopes that one of the O'Hare airport Chili's would let me order from the plane but no luck with that yet.  Fortunately, this Chili's allows you to order from the app.  It worked out great, I even got to customize my order and add avocado!  It's the little things.

I headed out the door about 10 minutes before my order was due to be ready.  After all, this place is right across the street.  Plenty of time.  Upon reaching the end of the Aria drive, though, my fears were realized when I saw that I couldn't cross the street without traveling a couple of blocks in either direction down the Strip.  Obviously, this was crushing news in the blinding daylight and 101 degree heat.  About 20 minutes later  (I may be exaggerating) I finally reached my oasis.

I found the stairway off to the side and headed up to the second floor location.  The interior is really nice.  It's open, spacious, and bright with tons of TVs around the bar.  I guess I never really eat inside of a Chili's so I didn't realize that they have touch screen ordering devices on the table.  You can order when you're ready while watching a game on one of the TVs at the bar...which you can totally see from your table.  It actually seems like a pretty cool place to hang out.

No one was staffing the take out area so I spoke with one of the hostesses.  It seems that there was some kind of mix up with my order so it took a bit of back and forth between the hostess and a guy who seemed like he might be a manager.  When they finally found the order, the register wasn't working so they had to process my payment in the back somewhere.  It was no big deal, though, the staff was all super friendly and apologetic.  The manager even threw in a ridiculous amount of ranch dressing (I have a problem, I know) because I mentioned that I like extra ranch.

When I finally got my salad back to the room, it was beautifully packaged and the presentation was nice.  Unfortunately, it was SUPER salty.  I figure that they're still working out the kinks at this new location.  A little salt isn't enough to keep me away from this place.  I'm glad Chili's made its way to this new location.",j_xdpXxPdSVhlwTJ7roKag,3,2,4,YwzyTXlL0KqlsDEHch2oLg

Our waitress was absolutely incredible - she took the time to go through all the question we had and made sure we were satisfied about everything. The menu design is really nice and there's a lot to chose from. It's impossible not to find something you enjoy eating here. As an appetizer we went with 2 sliders, cheddar bites and fries pickles. Really tasty! For the main dish I went with a 10 oz Sirloin steak and fried shrimp with a side of fries and steamed broccoli. The shrimp was really tasty and the sirloin had insane caramelization on the outside but still cooked to my liking (rare). What really got my attention was the automated checkout system.

Checked their app, and there was no wait, so I just headed over.

Whoever designed the Aria intersection with this place gets a big frown. Having to walk a block just to get across the street...

Anyway, this is supposed to be a review of this place, so. Walked in and was told it would be 5-10 minutes for a table unless I wanted to sit at the bar. I mentioned the app said no wait, but that I wanted a table.

I apparently pissed off the hosts in saying that, because ... I get seated right next to the kitchen, with plenty of other open tables in the place.

Danny, my waiter, comes over after 3ish minutes, and apologizes for not noticing me, because ""they usually don't sit people here"" (and he explained as I was paying that it's usually employee seating), which was obvious because it had a dried (salsa?) stain that took a lot of effort to clean.

Mmmhmm. Also as I was paying, he said two of the hosts were new. In my opinion, the third, who set a bad example to the other two, at minimum shouldn't be training, and really deserves to be told to work elsewhere.

The only other very minor thing was that the chips looked slightly overcooked.

Otherwise, the quesadilla explosion salad was very good, and Danny kept my drink filled.

We waited 20 minutes for our food to arrive and my wife got her salad at the same time as the main entree...poor form.  In addition, we order kid's meals at the beginning of our order; which come with a drink, but the drinks were not delivered until the main meal and they were 2/3 of the way full AND each time the waitress got refills on these (two other times), they were always delivered 2/3 of the way full...I thought it really strange why the waitress did not take the extra initiative to fill the drinks the entire way on a dinky little child size cup.

And to make matters worse, the entire electronic pay processing devices were not working and our only form of payment was a Chili's gift card; which could not be read.  As a result, we had to wait ""10"" minutes to pay the check; while the manager calls and gets verification of funds and so forth and so forth.  It wasn't a great visit in terms of time and waiting.  Hopefully this Chili's gets their act together for the future, because your customers will not want to come back otherwise.

Normally, the words ""Let's go to Chili's on the strip for dinner tonight"" would not be something that would EVER come out of my mouth. But it did and I am sorry for it.

My wife and I received a $25 gift card to Chili's. That is the only reason we decided to eat there on our date night.

When we arrived, we saw that they had an outdoor patio overlooking the strip. Awesome. Maybe this was not going to be so bad afterall, I thought. And hey, we had been walking the strip sipping drinks for an hour already, and I needed to take a leak. 

There was a friendly enough girl at the hostess stand. We asked to be seated outside on the patio where it seems most everyone else must have been sitting because the place was empty inside. She said ""no problem"" and walked us to a table that was on the patio, but not overlooking the strip. We wanted to people watch so we asked if we could get a seat overlooking the strip. There were plenty of open tables that had not been cleaned yet. She did the eye roll and said ""ok"". Maybe they were short on staff, I don't know, but all those dirty tables in the prime table location? Off she went to get someone to clean a table for us, so we could sit and have our view. The famous Chili's Las Vegas Strip view?! Yee haw.

I took this opportunity to find the bathroom. When I came back, my wife said they cleared off a table at the end of the patio, backed by a huge wall. Half the view blocked. Why they decided to clear that table and not one of the other 5 that had awesome views, I have no idea. But my wife asked if we could have one of the better tables in the center, that were empty and needed to be cleaned. The girl gave her famous eye roll once again, and just walked away. 

After standing awkwardly for 5 min waiting to see if the requested table would be cleaned off for us, nobody came. So we did the walk of shame to the table they cleaned for us and sat down. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Nobody looked at us. Nobody came over to us. We just sat there, waiting.

After maybe 10 minutes of awkward waiting, I said we should just leave. We got up and walked out of the place. We walked passed the eye roller at the hostess stand, and she was all happy and smiling. She said, ""thank you for coming"". I really think she thought we had eaten already and we happy customers leaving a nice experience. Uh, nope.

All I can say is this place is painful. What a joke of a restaurant. Are all Chili's like this? I threw the $25 gift certificate in the trash.",MNeRZjw3NoJlCavv7SatzQ,1,0,1,Rq-xTwaNAHvz4JKGqCn_Iw

The food here is subpar.  The fish tacos had a moldy taste. The triple berry desert was under cooked and cheap (the waitresses even commented it didn't look good but then did nothing).  The service was off several times on various requests.  They claimed to be out of house tequilla requiring a 3 dollar up charge on margaritas.  But even with all this it's Chilli's right?

Nope - get ready for the hard sell tactic of the waitresses standing at your table, ringing your bill on a tablet, her calculating a 20 percent tip and adding it to the bill, and then standing table side and asking if that's okay.  Really?  It's such a tacky move I will never again go to a Chilli's.

The place didn't seem to be so terribly crowded (in fact it was near closing).  The reason that it took so long was due to the fact that there were no clean tables available.  Rod B (03/06/2017) mentioned this in his survey.  My visit was just two days ago.  All of the tables around us had leftover food, soiled napkins and dirty glasses on them.
Our orders were taken and when the food arrived, my friend had corn on the cob on his plate that he hadn't ordered (in addition to a portion of fries).  For the error, the waitress brought another order of fries.
While the food was adequate, dining around tables that are filthy does not enhance the experience.  I might also add, that Las Vegas was experiencing record-breaking 117°F temperatures.  This can make a diner more sensitive to the surroundings.  That being said, there is still no excuse for a restaurant's failure to clean up after a meal if diners are being seated.  And given the fact that it's been more than three months' time since that complaint was noted, I think the restaurant proved that it FAILED it's customers again.",aFe_uDM1nzzKBpZBmFUIVQ,2,0,1,Uck-n8ASOr5IS0wrlpWSyQ

I came in for dinner with my 2 boys, and requested for Strip view (it wasn't busy at all, plenty of empty tables around). We were offered the patio table, which we took happily. We've been seated for about 10min with no server to greet us, but since my boys were busy drawing their kids menu and I took some pictures of the view, I didn't mind it at first. Only until there was a couple who came and seated at the table next to us who got greeted by a server immediately that I started to get irked. He told them that he'd be back, as he had some dirty dishes on his hand. When he came back, he took their drink orders, and proceeded to go back inside until I stopped him and complained that I have not even been served since I got in about 10min ago!  He was apologetic and then he went inside, and sent another server to serve us instead!  The nerve of that guy!

So when the other server asked for our drink, I asked for the manager. He proceeded to do so, but never came back to take our order.  The manager himself didn't show up until some minutes later (I think about another 5-10 minutes), in the meantime, when the 2nd server came out, I asked if ANYONE will take our order at all. He said that he was under the impression that I wanted to talk to the manager without ordering anything. OMG! He didn't even bother to check or ask, just making his own assumption!

When the manager came to our table, his explanation was that 2 servers were assigned the patio area, so that's where the confusion started, since one server thought the other already took care of our table. The manager ended up taking our orders instead.  Honestly, if it was not because my boys wanted to eat at Chili's, and that it was not past 7:30P, I would walk out and find another restaurant nearby!

The food was good, as what other Chili's standard, but service is truly lacking! When the food came, I realized that none of the server even gave us utensils and napkins that I had to ask for it. Really, are we supposed to eat our food with our fingers (I ordered steak & salad)??? And when I asked for hot sauce, it didn't come at all - not until the server came out again to see if I needed anything else that he realized that he forgot the hot sauce!

When the bill came (for those who wondered, no, I didn't get any discount from the manager on my bill), I was so tempted to omit leaving any tips, but the civilized part of me prevented that and I left the minimum 15%.

4443213,2017-08-13,0,PMOlf91mjpkWRiZa5hEr-A,"Moving now to Las Vegas coming from Miami, I decided to become part of chilis family by visiting the restaurant every Saturday night to have dinner with my other half. One of the reason why I come to this particular restaurant is because my server Jessica, she is the best server ever. Extremely professional, well manner and fun. This place wouldn't be the same without her. So now, you may ask why one star, today 8/12/2017 at 12:15am, I ordered the usual, quesadilla explosión salad. When I started eating my salad I found GRASS in between. It was gross!!! I called my server she helped immediately but when the Manager Scott or scooter came to my table he had a nasty attitude like if I wanted something for free. So long story short, the manager asked me, is there something wrong? When I replied, well I found grass in my salad. When scoot or scooter replied to me EAT IT, it's just grass that happened when they cut the salad. Like I said, I wasn't expecting anything for free, just an apology would have made the difference. I did ate part of the salad because I didn't wanted to make an scene, and my server was nice enough that i felt sorry returning the salad and then maybe she had to pay for it. Based on this experience I will not stop coming here, due to the fact that she is the most amazing person and human being. She makes feel like back home (MIAMI). I will expect a response from the general manager Mikey Beals. Behaviors like this from SCOTT or Scooter are not professional at all. He is not dealing with bulgar person. I am well educated to behave in such situations. Once again just an apology would have made a big different....",XOPQ3pgXYyotxYwRq08L4A,0,0,1,WgmXUVoyYvHMjT28TJOwdQ

Not much activity here on this past Christmas weekend. The bartender kept leaving the bar to serve tables so it took me a few extra minutes to order another drink @ the bar. The bartender was really nice and helpful.

I've never seen this before at a bar but they had this strip of ice running across the bar where you can set your cup to chill on. That blew my mind!

He brought our drinks promptly and even asked if we wanted an appetizer free of charge while we waited. Although we declined, we truly appreciated that he offered.

We had too wait a few minutes for a table but it was not too bad.  We ended up in the bar area at a high-top table which was fine.  

At first, our waitress was fine, attentive, took our drink and food order quickly.  Then later, we had to track someone else down to get our final bill.  We did try to use the automated table top machines but we had the wrong one on our table.  The other waitress did figure it out and we finally got our bill, way longer than it should have taken.

I had the chicken and shrimp fajitas.  They were tasty but the onions could have been cooked a lot longer.  They were practically raw.  And you want that charred onion taste with fajitas.  My mom had a BBQ burger.  She said it was just okay.  She has had better.

It tasted like the sauce was out of a can and not fresh. The Cajun Chicken was well seasoned and grilled. Our waiter was nice and friendly and even split our pasta dish in 2 seperate plates for us.
