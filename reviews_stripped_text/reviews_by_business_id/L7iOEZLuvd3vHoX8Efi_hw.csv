first, they did not have any breakfast to order which did not match with their Ads outside. after we sat down, we waited more than half an hour for all dishes but in the end, they just cancel our order and let us go becayse there are more people waiting outside.

Then, the food was very little, just one spoon per person and no one was full~ 

 i think this restaurant is not even qualified for one star~

My parents and I came into this place because we were so frustrated after trying to get a table at the other place, and indeed we were seated pretty quickly. This was the second time my parents have been there, the first for me. 

There were a decent amount of people there... I'd say the restaurant was at about 70% capacity. And there were no shortage of waiters and waitresses, but somehow everyone who served us seemed flustered, like they didn't know how to cope with so much business! (This was on maybe the 28th of December, so probably pre-New Year's influx of tourists)

Also, the menu frustrated me. I'm a vegetarian, so when I saw ""Vegetable soup wonton"" in english (""Ji cai won ton"" is what it said in chinese), I figured it'd be a safe bet. Except that when my wonton soup arrived it was like 90% meat and 10% vegetable filling. I ended up drinking the soup around the wontons and eating the wonton skins. I'm sure it would have been delicious if only I could have EATEN IT. :(

They were out of a bunch of stuff, just seemed really disorganized in general, and to make things worse, what my dad ordered, shao bing (the flaky pastry) you tiao (fried dough stick/chinese doughnut)and xian dou jiang (salty soymilk, literally translated) were really really subpar. The shao bing wasn't precut, the you tiao was UNDERCOOKED, and the xian dou jiang had no flavor.

All in all, a very sad meal, especially since it was really expensive for the amounts of food we got (not even going to talk about how expensive it was for the amount of food we ATE).

If you're in Vegas on vacation and trying to avoid the buffet-traps of the strip without breaking the bank, DON'T COME HERE. I don't know about the other restaurants in Chinatown, but this one is just not worth your time.",NfJOIoFS4vd5VuqIyRD2Kg,1,1,2,dNwn8FeMlcGoxv86OQp4sA

We got there for breakfast, and we ordered a large range of items including the dou jiang (soy milk), you tiao, shanghai chow mein, xiaolongbao, etc. The waitress told us to order the Drunken Chicken which she said was particularly good, so we gave in and ordered it as per her suggestion. 

Everything was absolutely disgusting. The drunken chicken was stale and obviously bad, it was completely unedible. The only reason why she kept pushing it was because they didn't want to throw it away. 

The porridge was clumpy and tasteless. I could make better porridge at home, it definitely was not fresh. 

Worst of all, when we poured sugar into the soy milk, there was a DEAD FLY IN THE SUGAR!! She took back the bowl, and we told her to make sure to give us a new bowl. She said yeah, but it came back out steaming hot, much hotter than when she first brought out the soy milk. Which made us think that they microwaved that same bowl!

The xiaolongbao was the only edible thing but it was obviously from a frozen package purchased next door. 

When we got our bill, I asked her to take the drunken chicken off because it was inedible, stale and not fresh at all. Plus, she had been the one who recommended it. They insisted that that's the way it was supposed to be made and refused to take it off the bill. They were obviously hustling us, did not give a damn about the quality of the food and were only about taking our money.

This place was pretty good until recently. I think they had an ownership change. This review is for my visit on New Years weekend.
Came at lunch time. There was 7 people dining in the restaurant including my party of 4.

Everything was ok until the waiter started messing up. This restaurant no longer speaks any English whatsoever. We tried speaking Cantonese but that didn't help either. We stuck to pointing to the menu. Thank goodness that helped.

Once the food was ordered, the waiter was all over the place. We order cokes, which he just plopped the cans on the table. No ice or straws.
We had to ask him for that. When the food came, we were stiffed on the soup that came with the meal. When we brought that up to the waiter, he rolled his eyes. When he brought the food over, he just basically dropped it on the table and walked away. The food proportions were stingy and everything was made just so sloppy.
When it came to giving us the menus, they only gave us 2 for the 4 of us.
It's not like the restaurant was full and short on menus.

The food and service was so bad, we just paid for the food and left. We didn't even eat half of the food. If you're in this plaza, eat at the place next door. They used to be decent and run by a bunch of women who knew what they were doing but now it's run by people who have no clue of running a restaurant.

jellyfish salad:  a cold savory dish.  was expecting a sweet/sour flavor combination...but was good nonetheless...a little more acid would have made it perfect

beefstew with noodles and spinach:  good, but not enough beef

scallion pancake:  i've had better...least favorite dish.

The restaurant was a ghost town on a Saturday night.  We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first half of our meal.  While we ate, the employees were either collaborating with the cleaning of the fish tank or kept pacing around our table.  Can you say, awkward and uncomfortable?!

We ordered the following:

* Shanghai fried noodles: these noodles would put Shanghainese people to shame.  It was more like an Americanized chow mein.  The noodles weren't the authentic thick and round kind, and the taste was a far cry from what I'm accustomed to.  Gross. 
 
* Xiaolong bao: the XLB were decent but you could detect the thawed taste in the meat filling--obviously frozen, not fresh.

* Fish fillets in wine and vinegar sauce: mediocre dish, but the wine and vinegar ratio was very imbalanced.  It was more vinegary than drunken.

* Wheat gluten (mian jin) and mushroom dish for our veggie friend: the mian jin was funky--way too spongy and slimy inside.

What finally broke the camel's back for us was the service.  Keep in mind it was just us and another couple dining here.  Also keep in mind that we were here around 9pm and the restaurant has a huge neon Chinese sign on the outside that says ""late night meals.""  So they were obviously not closing anytime soon.  But midway during our meal, one of the male servers comes over and tells us to take the last XLB from the steamer.  We tell him, ""we'll get to it later, please keep it here.""  As if he didn't understand our Mandarin, he continued ushering us to take the last XLB.  So we continued telling him to leave it alone.  But he wouldn't budge.  So for the sake of not causing a scene, we gave in and just took the darn thing.  It was annoying and rude.  What was the darn rush?  Soon after that incident, he just kept hovering and pacing around our table.

It was 4pm and it was neither here nor there, but I complied.

We get in there and the Shanghainese owner seated us. He was pretty funny. After finding out I could speak the language, he came over and talked and talked with us. 

We got the XLB since it was so cheap hoping it would be good. They also had 'ma lan tou' which is a cold appetizer (which I love). We also ordered scallion pancakes which is lil guy's favorite. Stir fried rice cake is also another favorite of our's so we got an order of that too.  I then noticed they also had salty soy bean milk which, generally is on the weekend menu of many restaurants but here, you can get it at any time.

The rice cakes was delicious, so was the ma lan tou. Lil guy loved the scallion pancakes AND the rice cakes. Hubby loved the salty soy milk. I thought the soy milk was really good.... again so surprising in Las Vegas of all places. The only thing which was not up to par to Din Tai Fung of course as the wrapper was on the thick side, but for $3.95, it was alright.

To find such good Shanghainese food is one thing in the LA area, but in Vegas? I was pretty blown away.

There was no follow-up service, and the wicked servers (which I believed own the place) would rather have you not in there!!!

I can stand poor/bad service sometimes, but when I go to a restaurant I expect to at least not, get yelled at very loudly (indeed it happened to us once when we got napkins off another table because there was NO Service), see other patrons having yelling matches with the servers, see employees yelling at eachother constantly, and fighting to pay your bill and being told to wait (at least 30 mins.)!
