I loved that feeling walking in first thing in the morning! The store front was clean and well kept. I also thought the restaurant was clean and well-kept as well.

The customer service in the restaurant is what needed the most help and it is why they were only given 3 stars. Breakfast servers should be cheery and happy... that is what I look for in my breakfast places as a Las Vegas local. Take a note from the customer service from the staff in the shop. Maybe smile more... maybe come by our table and fill drinks more or let us know our order coming? Especially knowing it was looking like we were there over 30 min just waiting. 

During the 1 hour time of waiting for our order, I observed different people being served before our party of 4.... although they were seated after us. It didn't seem to matter how many were in their party. Looks like perhaps it just depends on the server and or what they ordered.

Once we got there the hostess said that it would be another hour. She also mentioned that if you check in on line it doesn't mean anything until you check in at the restaurant.

1. They called me to the table.  We go to the table only to stand and watch the busser cleaning the table. This seemed to be a standard practice here.  I guess Cracker Barrel wants its patrons to stand and hover while their hard working bussers bust their ass?  Talk about tacky. 

2. When the server says ""you will have to excuse me, I'm very under the weather..."". I guess when the company is too cheap to move to California because it would have to pay its servers minimum wage, you get severs coming to work spreading their illnesses.  

3. Why the hell eat here when you're in Vegas?  

4. Other than the eggs I'm convinced everything is frozen and reheated in the microwave and deep fryer and covered in gravy and pasteurized cheese food product.  Just like Arby's.

The online wait system that is run and managed outside of our jurisdiction) The people who work here are really phenomenal and made the job worth going to.

I took my dad and son to brunch and the waitress was very quick to get our order. Finally we ordered and she forgot a few things but brought them. No big deal. Then my dad got coffee and every time he saw the girl come around she went to every table but ours. He finally asked for a refill when the server finally came back.

I mean the guy is literally just looking at me struggle and still doesn't offer to check us out. Finally he goes ""I'll take care of you here."" Well thank you for finally stepping up to do your job. The two ladies were sweet and could tell I was irritated at his rudeness. There was no one else there but us so it was strange that no one wanted to help us. Anyways, I asked my dad to add a 20% tip and the guy literally tells my dad an amount to write which wasn't even 20% it was 30%!!! In what world is it ok for an employee to tell a guest an amount to tip especially when it's not even close to what I asked!

479633,2017-07-25,3,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Cracker Barrel has many goodies in their pantry, but a seasoning cupboard is not one them. The food is not exactly pricey or horrible, but very bland. Based on the southern recipes I grew up with from my great grandma, I know older style cooking typically has less seasoning than the cuisine aimed at more modern palettes. However, even fat and salt aren't enough to give their classic chicken and dumplings any interest (they were the worst of my sample platter - imagine chicken pot pie but without colorful veggies, crunchy crust, or taste). 

The ham and meatloaf faired better but still are nothing to go out of the way to get (I have had better ham from a little breakfast burrito place wedged in a small strip mall). The mac and cheese was the biggest disappointment. Blandness aside, it felt like watered-down Stouffer's with a thin sauce that felt neither creamy nor cheesy. I enjoyed the fried okra (similar to a drier and non spicy fried jalapeño), but it could use a dip or seasoning salt. The best thing on the plate was the hash brown casserole which aside from being cheesy had pepper (which they really should introduce to their other offerings). 

Biscuits are good. However, likes everything else, they aren't that impressive (maybe I have been spoiled by Mrs. Knotts). Also they came slightly after the meal... before would have made a nice little appetizer to spread out the eating process  like butter. 

Also, you get to wait in a line in a cramped store to pay. Yay.",dSGnDXeCV2mHscEA2-2Jew,4,3,2,tX8lMh_9SuWqei5nwr21zA

We had a party of 9, so we called ahead of time to get an idea of the wait time.  We were told ahead of time the wait would be ""about 40 minutes.""  Ten minutes later we arrived at the restaurant and put our names on the wait list.  Nobody said anything about a longer wait time,

70 minutes later, we asked what was going on, since we were close to 2x the wait time that we were told.  The guy at the front looked at our name on his iPad and he said, ""your wait time is shown as 'about 2 hours.'""   I get that any restaurant can only seat a certain number of people each day and that large parties are hard to accommodate.

The other half is a restaurant. You walk in and can smell the fire burning in this huge fireplace. The staff was super friendly and prompt. I had the breakfast sampler, wife had the egg in a basket and the kids had the pancakes and French toast. 
The good: the hashbrown cass role is bomb. It's made with cheese, cream of chicken soup, and something else. Whatever it is it's great. The pancakes were delicious partly due to the syrup. It's a combination of real maple syrup and sugar. No fake stuff here folks. The biscuits and gravy was delicious as well. You can tell everything was made from scratch. They have fried apples. It's like eating the apple pie filling without the crust. It was different but good. 
The OK: the bacon could've been cooked a little longer. It was a little too flimsy for my taste. The grits were kinda watery. The sausage patty was dry and kinda tasteless.

This is our first time here and I definitely do not feel welcome.  For starters the hostess never smiled once. The guy bringing us to the table never smiled.  Our server, Natalie, tried to smile but you could tell it was forced.  

As we placed our order our server asked if we wanted ""baked potato salad or 3 sides"".  We hesitated because we didn't know what a baked potato salad was.  She repeated herself as of we didn't speak English.  (We understood her loud and clear, it just didn't make sense.)  So, we asked for the potato salad.  To which she asked what type of dressing.  We were confused so I asked why there was dressing on potato salad.  She reiterated by enunciating each word slowly, ""...I said baked potato or salad..."", which she did not. 

Even after I explained that it was our first time she continued to explain what she said.  And never acknowledged us for it.  

Towards the end, and probably because I already started writing this review, she became nicer.

1030457,2016-09-26,2,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"BREAKFAST: If you ask for my opinion, I would not have breakfast here. Their food is low quality and over priced for breakfast. You could literally go to a local breakfast cafe for better food, larger portions, for a better price. 

LUNCH/DINNER: Their lunch and dinner is way better quality than their breakfast. The dishes are all-american favorites. Everything comes in a large portion and their sides are really great with the entrees. Their food tastes like cafeteria styled food so I wouldn't recommend this place if you looking for fresh made to order dishes. My two personal favorites are the fried chicken dinner served on Sundays and their catfish served everyday. I like to add mac n' cheese and mashed potatoes to my orders. They also serve corn bread and/or biscuits with most orders. In addition, you can add soup or salad to your meal for a few dollars.

DRINKS: Their Strawberry Lemonade is super refreshing! Personally, I like to get the bottled sodas:)

SERVICE: I guess in their defense, they are always really busy with a minimum 30 minute wait for a table....but that shouldn't be an excuse. The hosts never seem to call people in the order they come in. People get really angry and frustrated when they wait over an hour for a table and someone who came in five minutes ago slips them a tip and get in immediately. When your table is ready, the hosts take forever before they actually walk you to your table making you wait another 5 to 10 minutes for them to ""clean your table."" Once you sit down, the tables and chairs are dirty and you have to ask someone to clean it for you. It takes forever for waiters to come get your orders and it seems like the waiters don't have stations they work at. They seem to serve all the tables which makes everything unorganized. Every time I've been here, I have to deal with them serving me broken mugs and dirty water glasses. The waiters are all super unfriendly and lazy when you ask for anything too. I have been here a few times because I want to try all their food, but it's discouraging for the customers to come here when they have horrible service every single time they come in!

STORE: Their store is the cutest thing ever with very unique snacks and novelties. I love their variety of bottled sodas in the display area, their old fashion candies, and all the cute stuffed animals!",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,7,3,3,88CsycsKosPVHVUJd2VJCg

This was the first time I have been to cracker barrel for breakfast and my second visit in total. People always say they give the most filling meal and best tasting foods, well not true.

I was surprised how bland tasting the food was and how little I was served. I ordered the egg whites, sourdough French toast meal, Beacon , and their hash browns that was a special style of the al la carte menu. 

First off, they would not substitute my Beacon for any thing else on the menu like fruit or toast, I Dont eat meat.

It was just probably not a good night at The Cracker Barrel I'm guessing. We had a nice waitress but it took 30 minutes to get water & teas (NOT till after we got served salad) and had to ask for our drinks the 2nd time! Even a nearby table received their drinks quicker and they JUST sat down! Next were the Entrees, my Mom ordered the Pot Pie which was the lunch Special so it was (guessing) sitting for 4 hours. It smelt like dog food and my Mom completely lost her appetite and just couldn't think of eating. I ordered the (small plate) of chicken & dumplings with corn & mashed potatoes, it was okay it just hit my stomach like a Brick. Dad had the Meatloaf & mashed potatoes( it was a ""6"" from a 1-10) FYI it's very THICK. The biscuits were the Best thing there!",V-eBx19Yx9F1BtmuM3qTtQ,5,0,1,l7RdeAB-IotbRkK_NBXRVw

I was looking for a little gift for my husband. I asked Quinn if the store had any husband gifts. She looked but couldn't find anything so I decided to create my own soda collection. Quinn could have left me there or in the beginning she could have just said ""no we don't"" and moved on. But instead she stayed curious and eager to help me. She was an expert regarding the history and taste of the different soda collections. She offered her personal testimony of almost all of the sodas. When I described what my husband loves and hates she was able to give me specific options and created an effortless shopping experience. Thank you Quinn for being patient and for being very pleasant during my first visit at your location.

Holland was very nice and efficient. She was able to complete the experience by giving me the information i needed to complete the customer satisfaction survey. I decide to yelp my experience so everyone can get a glimpse of what they can expect when they visit this location.

They brought me an Iced Tea that was cloudy and tasted off.  That usually means they didn't dump out the tea from the night before, or they didn't do a good job washing out the tea container.  Yuck.

I had today's special, Baked Chicken with Dressing.  The chicken was pretty good, and the vegetable side that came with it was also good (carrots).  But I did not like the dressing.

The server was very nice and friendly, but I think they are still a little overwhelmed.  It is still very busy, and maybe they need more staff?  It took quite a while to get the beverages, and then it took a while to get the check afterwards.

Well, the ambiance is fantastic!
The fireplace was glowing and keeping everyone within 15ft. warm and cozy on this Friday morning in December.
They have a checkers table nearest to the fireplace too.
So I asked our hostess and server, what is the most popular item on the breakfast menu.
Gramma's sampler platter - actually not on the menu -was the response.
It's an order of pancakes, bacon or sausage, eggs and choice of potatoes. We chose the hash brown casserole.
When I think of hash browns for breakfast, I'm thinking ...
crispy.
Key word here is CASSEROLE. 
NO crispness at all. 
Soupy ... Soggy shredded potatoes. PASS!
Bacon ordered crispy as usual, bacon I got was soggy and chewy. PASS!
Eggs came as ordered, over easy. BUENO!
Pancakes, I love me some good crispy on the edges pancake that's yeasty and melts in your mouth.
Looked great, butter was frozen and of course, hard to spread.
Pancakes was a little burnt. (see pic)
I didn't bring this to the attention of the staff as we needed to make an appt.
No biggie, flavor was ok and the maple syrup helped.
Coffee was just ok to me but remember, I'm a self appointed coffee snob. (I'm getting better tho)
Perhaps if there is a next time, we'll definitely order something different.
We'll be back in Las Vegas February 2018.

We went for a birthday dinner and was told an hour wait. Ended up being about an hour and half which was okay because there was 10 of us. Diane was great with her service and very friendly. She went above and beyond. Very happy with her service. When our food came out they only brought two of the plates. 15 min later I finally asked a manger where the rest of our food was. 10 min after that they bring our food or what we thought was our food. Wrong table. It was another guests food. They finally bring the rest of the food, it was all messed up. Sides and wrong chicken. The server put the order in right she showed us the ticket. We waited another five min for the last plate which was a medium steak it came out extra well done. One end was bloody and red. Not medium at all.

I have been to this location three or four times. I believe a couple times for breakfast which is your standard breakfast items and truthfully a restaurant would have to drop the food on the floor and scoop it up in order to screw up a standard breakfast. It really was your standard eggs, potatoes, grits, toast and breakfast meat deal. No whoopee.

I did dinner here and my daughter called it ""Old people food"" meaning the food was bland and ordinary. I thought it was a bit better than a Swansons Hungry Man mean, so very average!

So for the desserts, that is where the redemption starts and endfs. I will say the Coca-Cola cake and the Apple Dumplings are very good and probably the only thing decent at any Cracker Barrel.

Once seated, your server usually is quick to come to the table for drink orders and perhaps even food orders if you are ready. That was fairly true at this place, too, but then be prepared for an extra long wait for the now cold food to arrive. Managers start by using the ""that's just the way we do it"" defense - which doesn't work once you have been to several other Cracker Barrel locations. We waited some 45 minutes to get cold food that should have been hot. It appears that the biggest problem areas may be the kitchen and the management - why argue with customers when they are long time customers?  The same basic problems happened on our first visit here so we tried again. It was WORSE the second time. Finally a different manager tried to resolve the problem, but by then the die had pretty much been cast. We hope Corporate staff will intervene soon and fix this place so we can return pleasantly.",1xIk5uZVMs3f5fIxTWK9dQ,2,0,1,ImkHCOEV0sP-bOL3ufiqUg

1546226,2016-08-31,3,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"BEST PLACE TO EAT & SHOP!

Upon entering the store is like walking into your Grandma / or Country's friends home with that faint pumpkin spice / cinnamon / apple butter / bacon cooking / goodness aroma. This is truly a down-to-earth, family, home cooking type atmosphere. I love the warm feeling you receive from entering the doors. The hostess is friendly, the sales associates (if you have to wait & browse) are knowledgeable & outgoing. The layout, the items on display and for sale make this a cozy place to chill & walk around. If you want to extra chill while you wait, just sit in the cozy rockers outside. Note: If it's HOT weather in Vegas, they do have the ""water misters"" on to keep you cool while you wait.

WAIT TIME INFO: The store opens at 6am (no wait time) and probably starts getting busy at 9:30 am with a 1 hour wait time. As I'm sitting writing this, it's 11:22 am on a Wednesday, the wait time is only 30 minutes. YES, I've also been here at 6pm (duh dinner time) and had an hour plus wait time. Don't let the other reviews from people about WAIT TIMES scare you. 

There's a couple of factors that you have to consider when making a ""Cracker Barrel"" breakfast/lunch/dinner 'DO I WANT TO WAIT' decision:

#1: What time of day are you eating? If you want to save yourself some time, call them directly at the Dean Martin location and they will gladly let you know the current wait time. Their number is: (702) 474-1120 and PRESS #3 to speak to an Associate. I did this and they were so friendly! Challenge solved!

#2: They just opened THIS location on July 25th, 2016. Give them a break. You KNOW everyone and their Uncles & Grandmas families will be here PLUS all the tourists? WOW! This speaks volumes. I say they are doing their thing considering the 'craziness' that happens when a new place as great as Cracker Barrel opens. I understand employees that get overwhelmed and it's busy....stuff happens.

#3: If you DO have to wait, take the time to BROWSE the store. THE STORE IS AMAAAAZING!!! Seriously, not fibbing. You can spend HOURS just in their retail store looking at every interesting item like wood wicked scented candles, Burt's bees entire collection of awesome items, Specialty DAD's Sodas, pancake mix, bacon (have to ask them at the register to get you some from the back), cutest baby clothes & toys, women's clothes, UNLV merchandise, various sports team items, holiday decorations, old school & new school candies, kitchen decor, Yankee candles, & SO MUCH MORE!!! CAN YOU TELL I LOVE THE STORE!!

FOOD: Two menus to choose from: Breakfast OR Lunch & Dinner. I always get both. There are a myriad of items to choose from and although I haven't tried everything, it's always fresh and every location I've tried (Utah, Montana and now Nevada) never disappoint me. My favorites include, (Breakfast) Old Timer's Breakfast or Momma's French Toast and I always have a Biscuit WITH APPLE BUTTER and a side of grits...(Dinner), my fav is the Roast Beef Dinner with a side of OKRA, Mashed Potatoes & Grits (no cheese), can you tell I love grits? Btw, the cornbread is sweet FYI. I will come back later to update this area as I try more and more dishes. The Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes are awesome too! Yum, dessert CHOCOLATE COLA CAKE is UNBELIEVABLE! Wow!

TIP: While you are waiting, sit in a rocker outside on the front porch and look over the ENTIRE MENU. There are so many items on BOTH menus that you need time to look it over, seriously, trust me on this.

Overall, excellent experience. I personally love Cracker Barrel and this particular location is clean, friendly and the food (so far) has been a great for myself and my family. As you can tell by my review, I am a Cracker Barrel fan. They pretty much are all the same but since I live 10 minutes away, this can be dangerous for all of us. There is no such thing as 'portioning' here so I am forced to eat the great food.... Wish me luck and hope our paths cross soon!",vMGSO3INkAa0SdFs7SwuIQ,2,1,5,tSPz55GubUIJLaRLwtF4_Q

We tried a couple of the larger sampler plates and tried a variety of dishes- my favorite was the hash brown casserole (get it cheesy!), as well as the pecan pancakes. The grits and biscuits are solid as well. Most breakfast plates have eggs and at least one of the meats, and the chicken fried chicken is a good choice (only on the Grandpa plate!). Whatever you get, the portions are huge, so come extra hungry or expect to leave with a takeout box. 

The biggest tip I can give is to go early (~8am) or on a weekday to avoid ridiculous wait times. If you do end up waiting, browse the country store or grab a rocker on the patio to pass the time.

We finally got called, we had Julian for a waiter. He took our drink and food order, that's all we saw of our waiter ,we had to wait awhile for both. Manager David Hankins came over to us, and asked us how was everything was. We told him that we were waiting awhile for our drinks and food order. He said we are still trying to work things out. It seemed like he was making excuses for his employees. When we finally got our food order, my wife's order was not right. She order, steak & steak fries. She did not receive steak fries with her steak. Since we waited so long for our order, my wife didn't want to say anything. My order was alright, I ordered the Chacker Barrel sampler. We decided to order dessert, we had more problems. They brought out my wife's dessert without mine. I asked, where is mine? They asked what did I order? I said peach cobbler. After waiting 20 to 30 minutes for our dessert, I received my peach cobbler, not what I expected. It came to me like soup! I told the manager David Hankins about my dessert, again he was making excuses for his employees. This manager, did not apologize for anything that went wrong. He didn't even offer to do anything for us, very unprofessional! He walk away saying if there's anything he can do. We should not have to tell a manager what he should do for unhappy customers! Also we notice employees standing around not helping customers . That could of been causing the wait time for people waiting for drinks & food orders. My wife & I never expected to receive the service we received. We went to a Chacker Barrel in Andover Mass and had Excellent Service and Excellent food. That's why came here, we didn't understand why we didn't get the same Service we received back east. It seems that all employees including Managers need further training on taking orders and having customers wait for a long period of time .We hope that things change around so we can come back enjoy our experience with good service and good food.

Growing up with Cracker Barrel restaurants nearby, it was almost certain one meal during the month would be here.  I was happy one opened in the Vegas area.  The southern feel starts out with their 'front porch and rocking chairs.  The front of the restaurant serves as a gift shop full of treats reminiscent of the good old days.  

We walked up around 8 on a Sunday morning.  Luckily we didn't have any wait to be seated.  Being a new business to the area we weren't sure.  Fortunately good service prevailed during our breakfast.  Refills were abundant and done very politely.

So First Up!
CB is across from Silverton, on your right side coming from Dean Martin BLVD...just follow the signs. Make sure when you go in, find the hostess podium or there may be one right as you walk in, Leave your name and how many in your party.  They'll let you know how long the wait is. Make sure you are close by the speaker system so you can hear your name being called when your table is ready! 

Got two visits in, the first, on their grand opening day, the latter two weeks later.  Despite the wait times (1 1/2 hours and 45 min) Everyone seemed to be in a good mood. I killed time browsing thru the country store that was filled with boutiquey like stuff, kitchen goods, novelty foods and throwback candy. 

They have plenty of rocking chairs, fans overhead, two industrial electrical fans, a water cooler on the front ""porch"" to keep everyone as comfortable as much as they can while waiting,

Food
Just going to gloss over this part because not much to it.  I love Southern comfort- stick-to-your ribs and hips kinda food.  The biscuits are warm and fluffy, the corn muffins, buttery, chicken and dumplings, hearty, fried apples, yummy.  The open faced Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, was a disappointment. Not how Mr. B remembered having it when we dined in CB in AZ. The meat was tender, but they were skimpy on the gravy here.   

If you compare this place to Black Bear Diner (the West Coast version of down home cookin) you'll be disappointed in the portions and overall taste from here.  Cracker Barrel was more on the bland side.  

They also lack plating skills..lol...but that's just the foodtographer in me talking. Everything looked like it was just slung on your plate and moved down an assembly line. Nothing wrong with that, but my carrots looked lonely on that big plate.

Price
It's great!  Budget friendly. Young families, retirees on a budget, or travelers will appreciate this place more. That's what the clientele make up here was. 

Service
Our experience was awesome both visits.  ALL the staff were upbeat and confident! Our server and her helpers were pretty efficient. Despite how crazy busy it was, our drinks got refilled, plates cleared out, no long wait on orders on both visits. The line was long on both times when we went up to pay, but we got thru it pretty quickly.

I got their grilled marinated chicken tenderloins with 3 sides that you get pick from a nice list to choose from. My three sides I picked were Mac n cheese, broccoli and mixed green salad and some biscuits. It was delicious!!!! Portion sizes are perfect size and the prices are good as well. I even caved and got a peach cobbler for dessert. For my drink I had a raspberry lemonade and it was so good it was like candy.

I ordered the Momma's French Toast breakfast, which was good, although it says topping of your choosing, but you're limited on fruit toppings (blackberry, apple, and peach).  

There was an issue when paying, they charged me extra for my meal when the extra charge (Turkey Bacon) was supposed to be included with the meal, but they fixed it for me.   Not sure if they did that because it was busy and just opened, and it was only a few dollars, but I know I was right.

Didn't have a chance to peruse the store area, but it looked like it had all the classics: old school candies, merchandise, everything you'd normally find there.

We asked if we could sub out a side with a burger and the waiter laughed at us and said no. Had to ask 3 different people for ranch! Our table was right by the kitchen so I am not sure how it was forgotten so easily. Also my meal came with biscuits\or muffins... we never got those either.

Check in is at the front outside and it looks like a porch with rocking chairs that are for sale.  It was busy and wait was 30 mins but we got in about 20 mins.  You walk through the country store before the dining room so it was packed.  The dining room is cutely decorated.  Tables are neatly placed but very close to one another.  You can reach over and touch the person next to you.  

Service is on point and we never had to wait very long for anything.  We got our food within 10-12 mins.  I ordered the country boy breakfast with steak that included a sample of everything.  Hubs ordered french toast.  Very tasty well seasoned steak although a bit tough but for $12 didn't expect high grade. BEST hash browns that have cheese mixed in. Good grits and apples.  French toast was also the best.  You can taste how much egg is inside.

You pay for your meal in the store and you can add your purchases to it.  The store is surprisingly very reasonably priced.  We spent about $50 in there.  

We enjoyed it here so much that we came for lunch the next day.  Lunch was not as good.  The corn bread was so dry and hard it was not edible.  My chicken strips were on par with Denny's so it tasted like frozen.  

I still give it 5 stars because there is so much I Love about CB.  I would not hesitate to go again.  They different than anything in its class (breakfast places) that I enjoy the nuances.",XS9MxXLAHJz6HWSdUfA4qA,5,6,5,blnQ85PU_75fkS3h0vVO2w

Las Vegas has brought in many big brands and chains recently.  There is a White Castle now.  A Shake Shack.  Now, there is a Cracker Barrel, which is located just off The Strip next to the Silverton casino and hotel.  Cracker Barrel is a chain business that features a restaurant and a faux general store selling dry goods provisions and seasonal items.

The general store offers several items that are probably a waste of money (or at the very least, just items you probably do not need).  The general store though makes the potential long waits you may experience at Cracker Barrel more tolerable.  It also does feature a few fun things like a variety of packaged snacks and sweets, which includes some hard to find and nostalgic candy options.  Cracker Barrel always features seasonal decorations.

The restaurant at Cracker Barrel offers great value.  You can get breakfast all day.  Lunch and dinner are also served.  Most of their lunch and dinner options are in the $9 to $14 range and feature very generous portions.

I had the chicken n' dumplins platter.  The portion of chicken n' dumplins was very generous--lots of chicken breast meat and a fair amount of dumplins.  The chicken breast was fairly good for chain restaurant chicken (it was not too dry).  The dumplins were good.  They had a good chicken noodle quality even if the dumplins themselves were a little doughy.  Unfortunately, the chicken n' dumplins as well as the standard offering of mashed potatoes and gravy were both lukewarm in temperature.

The platter came with 2 additional sides.  I had the turnip greens with ham hock.  The ham hock was a tad salty while the greens were quite bitter (even more bitter than I was expecting).  The fried okra was decent.  There was definitely quite a bit of fried batter so you kind of lose the okra flavor.  The platter was finished with 2 mini cornbread muffins.  They were quite crisp on the outside.  I wish they were a tad sweeter.

Service was very friendly and quick.  Prices are good as they are not too expensive and you get very generous portions.

In terms of décor, Cracker Barrel has a faux old timey look.

Cracker Barrel is not a bad option for large families looking for a lunch or dinner before they get to The Strip or after leaving The Strip.

Cracker Barrel offers free self parking.  The lot is big and it is easy finding and open space.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,15,11,3,kxpHkLdzuxCyg_eaCxTopQ

1. Waiting 25 min JUST for our coffees 
2. Having the kitchen tell us they are OUT OF GRITS....AFTER our food was brought out!!! That's 80% of the reason we chose Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Those grits are amazing and I CANNOT eat biscuits, gravy, casserole, etc due to food allergies. Maaaaany others in the restaurant were pissed as well.

Out in the Midwest some chains are real good as well as the experience, but that's because they been doing it for years. When they bring it out here in the West people get excited, but  it's all hyped up the experience and is not the same. 

Just like your typical popular restaurants and chain out here expect to wait up to 1-2 hours depending when you arrive in the morning. We arrived at 7:15am on Sunday and we still had to wait 30 minutes. Once we left it was 8:50am and we over heard the wait was two hours or so... 

The food was decent and service was so so. Like I said it just open and of course it is going to take sometime until they have all the cogs working in unison. We had some eggshell residue on our eggs, we did bring it up to management so they know. They did offer to give new batch of eggs, so that was good of management to try to rectify the issue that had occurred.

They also have mini store in the front, it will be very crowded, seeing there plethora of people waiting so they are just walking around site seeing until called upon. Once done the payment option is very inefficient. You have to pay your tab while waiting in line with the rest of people shopping at the mini shopping center. So it can take a while.

To be honest with you it's not worth the wait and crowd to have to wait just for bacon, eggs, grits and other breakfast items typically served everywhere else. We ate at the Cracked Egg and it was exceptional breakfast almost similar to Cracker Barrel. I'm sure there are plenty more breakfast joints, but we thought we try out Cracker Barrel because we had a great experience dining and customer service out in the Midwest.

The wait for two was about twenty minutes on a Wednesday late morning. The inside is big enough to sit a decent amount of people but small enough to feel ""Home-y"".
Because it was my first time there and knew I wouldn't be back anytime soon, I got a sampler breakfast plate of eggs any style, ham, sausage and bacon, grits, hash, fried apples and biscuits. Yum yum and yum. 
The biscuits were soft and warm, the hash brown casserole was seasoned well, the grits were solid, and all the meat was good. The sausage was my least favorite, though. I also didn't like the fries apples which actually look like basic baked apple pie filling. I am not a huge Apple fan period so that was no loss. 
All and all it was delicious. For me, in order for a place to get five starts they need to live up to the image they present.

If you KNEW the journey I have been through for Cracker Barrel, only THEN would you understand how excited I am that they have a location in Las Vegas. Yeah sure, it's about 4 hours away from home, but it's closer than Chicago -- which is how far I flew out the last time I wanted their deliciously fluffy pancakes.

So if this isn't the only review you've read on Yelp, then you know that there is probably going to be a wait. And if you are one of those lucky people who didn't have to wait at all, then you're in the right city - the city of Lady Luck!  I am assuming, like many other things in this town, you are taking a gamble when you choose to dine here.  We went on a Saturday morning and we waited an hour for breakfast.  Our breakfast ended up being our lunch, but thank goodness they serve breakfast all day!

To be honest, it's just breakfast food. So why wait an hour? Because it's nostalgically delicious breakfast food.  
Here are some things that you must order: pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cheese hash browns, and their corn bread.  You can get their eggs, or grits, or sausages... those are common place... ohhh but something about their pancakes, makes an hour long wait almost worth it.

That's about it, really.  I can see why people are so angry after waiting a few hours for food.  
I get it.

2042330,2018-06-02,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Ahhh Cracker barrel. you know what you might get if you ever get in, so you look online and it says '5-10 minutes' - yeah right, but you put your name in anyway... and wait outside. and wait. and then you approach the outside hostess to inquire about an ETA and the clueless high school kid says 'they've already called for you, go inside and they'll seat you'. So when in the 20+ minutes that we had been sitting there did they call our name? They didnt. the inside hostess, a snide college kid says bluntly that she called us, so we advise her that we've been listening and did not ever hear our groups name, to which she insists that she did and that we will be seated. no clear apology even when both my wife and I couldn't have been more clear that that was all we were really looking for. flat-out refusing to apologize as if she was somehow in-the-right to just not listen to the customer.  we left. I may never feel the urge for a country boy breakfast ever again, and I'm oddly OK with that.

I know it is summer and the workforce shifts to kids who probably think they have better things to do, but no matter how popular a restaurant brand is, you can't ever forget customer service and its importance today. brands ebb and flow in popularity and kne day you may just need this customer again. 

also, if you have an online system, it should reflect in near real-time what the wait is or like and tell people it is longer. under-promising and then giving yourself the chance to over-deliver is always appreciated from the customer's perspective. 

I know that cracker barrel prides themselves on the old-timey country store, but it just creates a cluttered mess you have to wade through and gives you no good inside waiting option, unless you want to be part of the clutter others are trying to get through to do anything (restrooms are also tucked into this mess)...",tZ4z3R0peQfZjenpbaDRYA,1,0,2,MYhtcq17CCOm3rY9nutWRw
2051712,2016-07-30,2,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Mmm, Cracker Barrel.  The thought of it makes me nostalgic about cross-country road trips - east to west and north to south.  Driving back from Cali a little less than a month ago I noticed a billboard stating the grand opening would be July 25, 2016, so I immediately got excited.  IKEA can wait but Cracker Barrel couldn't, so I stopped by for an early dinner today only to see an expected line of people outside awaiting their turn while rocking in wooden rocking chairs under misting fans and hanging/shading burlap - although the entrance faces east.

I knew I didn't desire to wait two hours to be seated, so I searched on their website for online ordering or perhaps telephone ordering.  The wait for an online order was two hours as well; but, fortunately, I called and the wait for a telephone order was only 30 MINUTES!!  So, pre-order by calling ahead, but be sure to eat it right away - we wouldn't want all that yummy country goodness to get cold.

I ordered Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast which is two scrambled eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, homemade buttermilk biscuits with real butter and strawberry preserves, fried apples, and Country Fried Steak.  Mmm mmm, breakfast for dinner, $11.13.

Enjoy!",amvZ9tmLWraWoML6K4Xiuw,4,1,4,HxdqbLkDOzUPH37C5Y5iLQ

Another 30 mins passed and we were finally called to be seated. Overall I'd say the 50 min wait was fine compared to the hour and 45 mins the other people had to wait who didn't check in online. However they do need to update the website wait time. The hostess outside was super sweet. The hostess inside, Maka... she was ok, but I sensed her irritated vibes. Understandable considering people checking in were a bit hostile. Not everyone but there were a few that I seen. Though she could of put a smile on here face since she is the first person we interact with.

FOOD : *We ordered our food at 11:10 and got our food at 11:40*
Anywhere I dine for breakfast I usually tend to get either eggs Benedict or country fried steak. So when I saw Grandpa's Country fried breakfast I knew had to get it. My dish overall was pretty good. Although I do feel like the gravy needed some sprucing up and it lacked a little flavor. The fried steak was good but that also needed some seasoning. Grits were yummy. The fried apples ... mmm... the fried apples! If fall had a flavor, that bowl of fried apples would be it! The apple butter was divine on the biscuits. My husband got The Cracker Barrel's Country Boy Breakfast w/ steak. His steak was cooked perfectly. He really enjoyed his meal. We got our boys blueberry pancakes that came with blueberry syrup. They devoured them. 


OVERALL ... Everything was good minus the wait for seating and food. I feel once the hype of cracker barrel finally being in Vegas dies down we would come back to dine. We love the store part of the restaurant! So many good finds there! Old school candy, games, home decor. I can go on and on.

We arrived Friday night at 5:30 and were surprised we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated, but that wasn't so bad. My first impression when I entered the dining room was that it was like a school cafeteria with rows of long tables. Turns out there are separate tables but jammed so tightly together there's barely room to walk.
     What impressed me the most was the horrendous noise. We couldn't talk, we had to shout  at each other. With wooden floors and wooden ceilings there's obviously no effort made to reduce the sound. This is a brand new building, and you would think that whoever designed it would have considered the noise and crowding factors, but apparently not. Seems the plan was to jam as many people in the dining room as possible and forget about comfort. If you're looking for charming ambiance and ""a fine dining experience,"" do not go here.

I came here this morning with my sister and my mom. We were excited to come here because there's finally a Cracker Barrel in Vegas. 

There was no wait time since it was an early Monday morning. We had no problems with the service until our food arrived. There was a long hair in our biscuits so we notified a server passing by right away. All he could say was, ""Ew, that's nasty!"" and took the plate away. The manager came by to check on us after that but there was no apology from him. Shortly after our food arrived, our waitress, Michaela, gave us our check and that was the last time we saw her. My family and I were waiting on a to-go order that was taking forever. We also wanted drink refills and to-go boxes, but we never received those. 

Another waitress told us that she would grab our server, but she still never arrived until the very end with our to-go order. Just because you gave us our check at the start of our meal does not mean that you shouldn't tend to us for the rest of our visit. I believe no one showed up because they were embarrassed about the hair in our biscuits. 

Not only did our service end up being horrible, but my family and I felt very sick after our meal. It wasn't just one of us - ALL of us felt ill! Unfortunately this is the last time I will ever visit Cracker Barrel.",pnda6IFF5EyrgSjF5GhOtw,2,0,1,_Y1LDqGbiP4npNsq2rJuJA

We had two servers and neither of them were around much even though the server in the next section was around all the time and taking care of her customers. 

The corn bread was horrible and dry with little taste. The butter was frozen and wouldn't spread so basically it was worthless.

I don't like to send food back or complain about it because I'm scared that the server or cook will do something to my food.

When she asked if I wanted to speak to a manager I told her I didn't have time since my family had been waiting in the car, in the 111 degree Las Vegas heat, for the last 10 minutes while she chatted with the previous customers and I told her that I doubted waiting any extra time for a manager would help the situation. Now she just became the cashier that just wanted to get an unsatisfied customer away from her cash register. She didn't even fix the charges when I brought them up.

This place is packed, so I can see a few hiccups happening still. 
Our food itself came out late and the people next to us who were seated after us got their food first. Not sure if this was a kitchen error or if the server forgot to put our order in.
A manager came up right away and said the food was coming out soon.
A minutes later is when we got it.
Food was good, but the sampler entree platter was a bit.... sad, the ham was cut deli style with only one small slice and the over all presentation of that dish was lack luster.
I got the chicken and dumplings and it was great.
The server dropped the check before we finished and we kinda just stared at it since we had planned to order dessert.
Saw the server some time later and informed her that we wanted two slices of pie.
She came back with them and informed us the pie was on the house due to the mistake. Which was a good thing since the slices were cold with cold icecream on top. I suggest requesting it warmed up since it ruined the dessert all together.

It helps to have a gift shop to look at stuff to make the time pass but Southpoint is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away from CB and I know you'll get their food faster.

Luckily, they've opened another location in North Vegas so if you needed to get your CB fix you can travel there if the wait time is too obscene at this location. The Sunday fried chicken special is good and the chicken and dumplings are also good and filling. The hash brown casserole is a must try.

So I've eaten at Cracker Barrel on two different occasions many, many years apart. I vaguely remembered the first time around that I thought they had really good syrup. Why syrup would stand out and not the meal? Not sure. Well, fast forward like 7-8 years, and I think they still have good syrup, and my entree was highly forgettable. For my entree I went with pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Kind of a staple breakfast for a place that caters to breakfast connisieurs. The pancakes were overcooked, and not just a little overcooked, like dark brown. The bacon was good, crispy just like I ordered it. The eggs, which I ordered over medium, were clearly cooked on way too hot of a griddle and closer to over easy. Pancakes had a decent flavor had they been cooked better.

My wife ordered the chicken fried steak dinner. Another blah-zay option. Gravy didn't have a ton of flavor. The meat did taste a little funny. Again, as a place that is comfort food city, you expect these meals to be decent, and they weren't.

The service also left something to be desired as well. We went on a Friday night, so we expected it to be busy. However, when the third waiter came over to help us, after placing our drink order two prior times it got a little frustrating. We also were dining with our 18 month old and always place his order with our drink order. We asked if we could get some of the biscuits they offer so that the little guy could get his eat on sooner than later. After 15 minutes, asking 4 separate people, we finally got the biscuits, followed by his meal about 30 seconds later. Our meals took another 15 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food a good 40 minutes had passed, we had an antsy toddler, and we were done. When the food comes out and it's less than desirable, it becomes Jason's Series of Unfortunate Events.

PS - the biscuits we eventually got were the most tasteless things I've ever tried in my entire life. Pillsbury canned biscuits are like 11x better.

Slow service, mediocre food at best, and wait times that make zero sense for what they offer. Likely going to pass in the future, which is too bad, because I want this place to be good.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,2,2,50Uqg9AtgZ_vzwGa0t9l9Q

The place was busy and by the time we left there was a long line at check in. There was a roaring fire in the fireplace and that was welcome on a super cold morning. 

The place seems to be well staffed with what appeared to be more than one manager walking around to check on tables. However, they would walk by and mumble ""is everything ok?"" and they were gone. So, really there was no opportunity to say anything other than ""fine"". They should have slowed down to listen to their customers like they were actually interested if everything was satisfactory. 

Our waitress arrived quickly to take our orders. My husband and I both ordered breakfast combos. My husband asked to substitute an item and the waitress seemed confused if this was a possibility, so he said forget it. 

Our food came in about 15 minutes and it was pretty darn cold! I would have told the manager, but he walked by so fast I wasn't able. Cold food is the worst! The hash brown casserole was under-cooked and the potatoes were crunchy. The gravy tasted like a fireplace or liquid smoke. Which is weird. We asked to have it replaced because it was not eatable. The waitress happily brought another one and it was still very funny tasting. 

Despite all the managers on duty ""checking"" with customers, no manager came to check on our complaint or returned food. This is also weird. 

Finally, when I went to pay I asked the cashier if I could leave my cash tip for my server at the front (I needed change) because our table was all the way across the restaurant. She looked confused starting bumbling around a bit and I said never mind and walked it back myself.

Finally got seated and waitress took drink orders. It took a while for the drinks to get delivered and when they did the waitress said she would be back to take our food order. After a long wait another waitress finally took the order. Not sure if she was covering for the other waitress or vice versa but another long wait ensued for the food. When it finally did come to the table it was the worst Cracker Barrel food I have sever seen. Scrambled eggs were slivers of eggs and the eggs over well I ordered were over medium at best. They were flat and about as thick as a quarter. 
I think the oddest thing about the experience is I decided to fill out the online survey - which I normally don't do and it seems like all they wanted to know about is how was the gift shop experience. 
A gentleman assisting the servers, (Manager maybe?) seemed to avoid our entire row of tables. 
Definitely not like my visits to other locations but based on the other reviews for this location it should be a fair warning.",USgJH41VVHbihkVQ4nggsQ,2,0,1,H8fYW7UdOd3AaE-QQHyFxQ

2565940,2016-09-03,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"I've grown up with Cracker Barrel, so as many Vegas locals, was excited to see a location finally being built near the Silverton. We did decided to wait a little bit before visiting allowing them to work out the ""kinks"" associated with opening a new restaurant. This seemed to be the right idea as many who have dined at the first Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas were unhappy the location didn't live up to the Brand's renowned country-style food and service.  After our visit, I can assure everyone they are working the issues out and are beginning to resemble to comfortable, easy eatery and general store I remember from childhood.

We actually attempted to stop by Cracker Barrel a week prior, but left after being quoted over a 2 hour wait! Granted, it was a Sunday morning, but 2 hours later would have been lunch time. This time around, our wait time was quoted at 40 minutes (which was almost exact). It was a chill day, so we waited. All of the signature rocking chairs on the porch were taken, but they had a nice shade and mister system and you could browse the general store. When our name was called we proceeded to the desk to be seated.

The restaurant was very busy. There was a lot of staff including corporate trainers to ensure everyone was adhering to the company's standards. Our server was on the slow side, but not horrible. I ordered my favorite biscuits and sawmill gravy with their delicious smoked sausage patties and fried apples (also asked for some amazing apple butter for one of my biscuits).   Everything was as expected, other than the coffee which wasn't the best. 

Until there are a couple more locations built in the valley, this one is going to be very busy most of the time. Although we will be back, it will most likely be on days where we have the time to wait the long list for a table.",09TLMTWynFwmHwcUl53ytg,2,1,4,Kaz23GZfSdQWA1YgQ1saqQ

We ordered supreme coffee but I really don't know why they called it supreme, it was regular coffee (light) nothing special. I really don't like the small half and half capsules.

Very attentive but they don't really good in looking what you've ordered. Plus, food was bland although condiments are available at the side.

My husband and I were out with a few co-workers yesterday (April 16th 2017) and decided to treat them to lunch. I checked in online for 6 people and saw there was an hour wait, which seemed reasonable considering it was Easter Sunday. On our way to the store we had one additional person agree to go, so when I got there the girl added the other person to the waitlist for us. She told us there would be a 50 minute to 1 hour wait which is what we were expecting. We went to the gift shop, bought some drinks and snacks then headed outside and sat on the porch to wait. After an hour I went back inside to check on our status and the girl told us it would be an additional hour + wait. Mind you, I am here with friends and have bragged about this place to no end. When I asked her why we had to wait another hour she said it was because the size of our party and they could not accommodate us. Meanwhile, there are plenty of smaller parties of 4 - 6 being called over and over. The staff basically told us too bad, just wait. After hearing of the additional wait time a couple of people from our party said they couldn't wait the extra time so we all went our separate ways. This was extremely disappointing. I'm pretty sure after this my friends won't be back and I'm not sure I'll be going back either. 

I am giving 3 stars because normally I love this place. The food is awesome in my opinion and the staff is usually great. Maybe they just don't do well under pressure.",-2hzvxcYCh4UD2PRpbhPyw,1,0,3,tg-WrPGgEglX2YNzfmSCcw
2616099,2017-05-28,5,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"To be quite honest, I was more impressed with the vintage decor throughout the restaurant than I was with my actual meal. Since the opening of this location last year, my parents have been wanting to bring the family here because it was one of their favorite restaurants when they lived on the East Coast years ago.

Cracker Barrel definitely gives me that mom-and-pop feel. You walk up to the restaurant to find a long porch lined with wooden rocking chairs from beginning to end and as soon as you go through the double doors, you'll find yourself in well, the ""Old Country Store"". There are a lot of novelty items for sale such as sodas in glass bottles and old fashioned candies and snacks that are sure to get the nostalgia flowing. Our wait time for the table was about 15 minutes or less and it went by fast since we were all browsing the gift shop.

The dining area of Cracker Barrel was a lot smaller than I had imagined and the table we were at was a bit close to the party next to us, so it was difficult to get in and out of your chair without bumping into someone. Our server Jeff was very friendly. He took the time to explain the menu to us as well as what specials were being offered. We all ordered a meal from the Fancy Fixin's menu. It came with your choice of any three Country Vegetables N' Sides and two made-from-scratch Buttermilk Biscuits or Corn Muffins.

I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken and chose mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and whole kernel corn. I also opted for one buttermilk biscuit and one corn muffin since I couldn't choose between the two. Our meals came out in a decent amount of time. I looked at my plate and was reminded of those TV dinners that my mom would tell us to nuke in the microwave when she didn't feel like cooking. The chicken fried chicken was nice and crispy. I like that the sausage gravy didn't make it soggy. The portion was huge! I could not finish it. My sides were okay, nothing special. I'm def a fan of the buttermilk biscuits though. Corn muffins were a little salty and didn't really taste like corn bread.

Everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was good and prices were great! We will be back again soon, but for breakfast! If you're looking for a decent, filling, homestyle meal, Cracker Barrel's got you covered.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,8,6,3,8Ceo2lbG7rMYq2MXKrCEJA

However, our local cracker barrel has really dropped the ball this morning. My hamburger patty was so over cooked I needed a knife to cut it. I couldn't actually imagine the same meat in an actual hamburger, it'd break someone's teeth! My husband's fried apples had a total of 4 measly apples included, I had to actually take a picture of those! 2 tabs of butter couldn't rescue the dried out grits either. 

After we were finished with our meal we waited quite a while before the waitress finally checked up on us so we could ask for a to go box. In the meantime, I might have been able to ask the manager for a to go box instead but he COMPLETELY skipped over our table during his ""rounds"". Like literally asked the table in front of us if everything was ok then walked past my husband & I & proceeded to ask the table behind us if everything was ok. Looked like he asked the whole restaurant before returning to us AFTER the waitress had finally been around. 

Overall the Vegas local just doesn't seem to really care like the other locations we've stopped at had. The food is sub par & the service is always lacking. Really disappointed I waited years for a local location to be so let down.",nltlR4RvihUOqEL1ZTUzFg,4,0,1,UtDZz14SuTyeUtAhMoLoeg

The initial order was pleasant.  As the food arrived it was clear that was not up to the standards I have come to know.  My order was not correct.  The yolk and white of my over medium eggs flowed like a beverage.   We all thought that there was something wrong with the sausage as it refused to be cut and chewed.  The replacement gave us the same challenge.  It was dry and tough but at least warmer.  One diner had to wait more than 7 minutes for 2 little bottles of syrup.  The biscuits were tinier than most Cracker Barrels.  We had to beg for refills on ice tea and soda.  The manager was sorry.  I think we definitely were sorrier.

Finally everyone arrived and we ended up having an extra person, so I went up to the podium and let them know that we needed to add an extra person (so we had 10 people total). I watched the girl change the number from 9 to 10 and then asked how long it was gonna be and she said an additional 15 to 20 minutes. We continued waiting  and then they finally called our name. We went up to the podium and they said that we had changed from 6 to 10 (which was not true) and they only had a table for 6 available, and when we said ""no, we had 9 and changed to 10"" they were able to get us a table for 4 as well, so we said that was fine. They went to seat us at the tables, but they were far apart from each other. This was not gonna work for us because we are all family and needed to be together. So we told them that we would wait for the table for 10 but then they then said it was going to be another 20 to 25 minutes for the table.

Also second time they said someone in wheelchair was a fire hazard because sticking out.  They could seat us at 2 tables but not at same time but still special request.  So it's ironic that my son who works for big company nearby can get a big group seated for meetings?  He won't be back, I won't be back.

The worst service, I have ever received at this confused, excuse laden, unexcusable mess, called a restaurant!, I was so excited that CB had come further west but alas!  Not a good location. 

 In Las  Vegas, there are 1000's of restaurants and buffets....why do you suck?????

The first waiter disappeared after she brought biscuits and touched them with her booboo, bandaid, hand.. another waiter and another waiter, topped off by snotty manager, D@#e, who villified everything I told him about our lackluster disaster of an experience.... (the 4 different wait staff asking me, ""what dressing do you want again?"")  

ME:  FRENCH.
WAIT STAFF:  RANCH?

My salad comes after my meal, no dressing on the side, 2 tablespoons of green beans, argumentative D@#e, the manager,  likes to tell customers"" what is"" and ""what is not""...bossing customers around like bad, little children...so no napkins for you!!!

Then he accuses me of calling him an idiot....whaaaa???? 

Do not clean up the restaurant and tell us why we have no salt, pepper or napkins, because WE DON'T CARE!!!...YOU ARE OPEN UNTIL 10 p.m. SO GET ORGANIZED!!",my7xZKg5HKSattJvrW2DhQ,2,0,1,bAGvtOqGm9D_oTQil3mBSA

Normally I don't go right in a new restaurant opening because there is so much chaos however we couldn't wait. 
So we went of course as I knew there would be a wait one hour and fifteen minutes however it was worth the wait, we kept busy looking around the store bought a few items the time went quickly. One hour and ten minutes later we were called spot on time they seem to be very good at judging their times.  
We came in on the fifth day of the opening this place was packed. All the employees were very upbeat smiles eager to help even with all that was going on the employees would take time to make sure you were comfortable and could help you in any way.  
We were seated server came over right away introduced her self with a beautiful smile very positive attitude her name was Sarai R. Even though she was very busy she came by checking on everything food coffee etc. she did an excellent job we could not have been happier with the food and service.  
Even though it was the fifth day and the restaurant section was moving like a well oiled machine the corporate staff ( red shirts) were working harder than any I have ever seen no one missed a move if something needed to be done it was done it didn't make any difference if it was your job or station or not it was it was taken care of by every employee regardless of station. 
I n my forty years in the food service industry I have seen very few openings this smooth 
Thank you for a job well done. To all employees THANK YOU FOR A JOB WELL DONE.
Will see you in the future.

You know all the food that makes America obese and is bad for you? They have it all here!! Biscuits, grits, country fried steak for breakfast and fried catfish, burgers and mac and cheese are some options offered on the menu. Breakfast is served all day and they have daily specials for lunch and dinner. The breakfast and lunch/dinner menus offer an extensive amount of sides to customize your meal. 

I'm pretty basic and always opt for breakfast items. The sausage, eggs and bacon are pretty basic and nothing to write home about. So why do we keep coming back?! I love the PANCAKES and biscuits. Omg the pancake!! They are fluffy and buttery. What makes these stand out is that they cook them in a way where the edges are crispy. I freaking love it. And no matter what time of day we go, we always get the biscuits. They are warm and soft and are delicious with apple butter. 

And once you are finished with your 1000 calorie meal, walk around the country store to look at all the little knick knacks and candy they have to offer. All of the employees we have encountered have been warm and friendly. And despite the longer than average wait to be seated, our food has always arrived in a timely manner.

The breasts were too large for me to eat the whole meal, & I ended up taking 1/2 of everything home for round two! The coating on the fried chicken is delicious and has a little bit of a spicy kick to it, which I can't describe from what. I love the cornbread muffins here! This place was worth the wait. I suggest you put your name in two hours ahead of time before you want to eat. Then go shopping at Bass or the Premium Outlet stores and come back when your wait time is up. We were told two hours, came back & were seated in 5 minutes. Stick with the chicken finger dinner for the little kids. If it doesn't look like a chicken finger, they probably won't eat the delicious fried chicken and you will waste your money! The chicken fingers are good. My 9 year old ate them with a side of fries.

We had recently been in New England and seen some pieces that we liked but were not able to bring back on the train.

I came here for a work lunch, we signed up to have our name on the list around 11:30 to arrive at 1 and we were seated around two. This place was so crowded I was convinced the food must be the best ever. It was a Friday so I ordered the fish & chips. I have had fish & chips at many places in the US and abroad. What I was served was the most bland mediocre substance that they presented as fish. The fish had a rubbery texture and tasted like it was cooked from frozen then breaded and served. The ""fries"" were chunky and crispy. I looked at the other stuff my co-workers also got. The presentation is so sloppy. I have no idea why people are willing to wait hours to eat this bland mediocre food. The staff is friendly though. I bought some fudge in the gift shop and it had this off taste to it, the texture was also way too soft like the sugar got hot enough to reach the soft ball stage.

3085348,2017-06-21,2,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"There are no Cracker Barrels in CA, so this chain of restaurants has remained an elusive mystery to me for years and years. When I happened to see one while driving on highway 15 in Vegas, I decided to stop to eat there. It has an old-timey southern general store look to it. There's like a porch in the front with lots of rocking chairs that people can sit on while waiting for their table (the chairs are also for sale). There is a store part and a restaurant part. The store part is where you enter through to find the hostess and it also sells lots of random stuff. Stuff I guess your general store would've sold like moon pie and cornbread mix. They sell Cracker Barrel branded products and also things like home decor, clothes, children's toys, lotions, etc. This is also where you would order takeaway. They have a breakfast menu and a lunch/dinner menu, but they serve breakfast all day. The dinner menu showed the most popular items, like the chicken n dumplings and the chicken tenderloins. The food is pretty much American/Southern food. I saw that they had a kids menu with smaller portions of their popular items and the description said it was for kids of all ages with no age limit. So I asked and they confirmed that anyone could order from the kids menu! 

I ordered the chicken n dumplings and a side of the fried okra and a raspberry iced tea. The girl who took my order was really nice and gave me some recommendations when I told her it as my first time here. I had to wait soooo long for my food though. Like 30 minutes which was annoying. Takeout is supposed to be quicker. When they finally brought out my food, they apologized and said they were waiting for my biscuits to finish cooking. 

The chicken n dumplings were good. I liked the dumplings part with the sauce more than the chicken, which was dry. The fried okra was good too. The biscuit was good but not amazing. And they didn't give me butter to go with my biscuit, so that was disappointing. The raspberry iced tea was refreshing and the right amount of sweetness. 

Overall, I'm glad I finally got to try this place since I'd always been curious about it. I can cross it off my list but I probably won't come back.",_uwuKDqYXnTM2qrpcs3P2w,5,3,3,7E9i1hmfo2ZhLK1_uVNwVg

The food is amazing. I don't think there's anything on the menu that I haven't tried -- and there's not a single thing I hate. The portions are satisfying; you will definitely need to loosen up your belt after leaving. 

My usual meal: meatloaf dinner with mashed potatoes, mac 'n cheese, & sweet carrots. Don't tell my mom, but I prefer Cracker Barrel's meatloaf over hers. 

My favorite part about Cracker Barrel is the customer service. Whoever did the hiring has done an exemplary job. 

Everyone does an amazing job but my friends and I get excited when Lynette serves our table. She has a contagious smile and always remembers our names/orders -- which makes us feel at home.

I asked our server for CRISP BACON & OVER EASY EGGS. What I received is another story. Under cooked bacon so the cook cooked the bacon longer but when I got my plate my eggs were cold. Also one egg was cooked medium to well. Unfortunately the texture of the bacon is like Beef Jerky. A manager came by asked us how things were. My partner said good but I said NOT Good. So he asks me if they fixed the bacon I said yes but I got cold eggs. So I didn't win in this situation. Don't know if the server screwed up or the cook screwed up.

The amount of food you get on the Sunrise Sampler is over whelming.  You get 2 eggs, sausage, ham and bacon, biscuits and gravy and also grits.  It is more good than I can eat at one time.

first off, coming here on the weekend can be a task because the business influx is ridiculous. but, with their check in system online, it becomes less taxing to wait. for the most part, the service is usually friendly and slow paced. we came today without any high expectations for service and food, but it was definitely one of the worst service experiences we had here. 

ordered the chicken fried chicken with different sides and added two eggs over medium to my order. the eggs didn't come till we were almost done with the food and they were not done correctly, which made the wait appear more annoying.

my boyfriend asked for ketchup and that never came so he just continued to eat his food without. i asked in the very beginning for tobasco sauce so the server wouldn't have to bring it later when she was busy, and she joked that i wouldn't be allowed to have it... but, then she totally forgot about it and i ended up asking the food runner Uly for it. he was so nice & it was after i asked three times that i wound up getting it. Uly was our one awesome listener since he brought the sauce without forgetting. 

our ice teas were never once refilled during our meal and the server Dani was not around for us to even ask, till we saw her towards the end when she dropped off our check. we asked for a box and bag... and she brought the box without the bag. overall, the service was terrible with the exception of Joseph who offered to take care of our drinks and a lady named Britney who was super nice to check on our eggs. 

we were on the way out when we the cashier asked about our experience and empathized with the lackluster service. he brought over Chase the manager. super friendly guy. appreciated the service of him taking the time to apologize for the experience and asked us to come back next time to make things better. i don't think ill be back anytime soon, but because of how things ended, i would give this another chance in the future. thank you joseph, britney, uly, & chase for excellent guest follow up service!",KxuNoB6BaSboVkYQ0T4w7A,1,0,2,lQE2bT0UMYIrQUUfA4B6lQ

Took about 45 min to get table for group of 6. The store in front of restaurant very cute and unique. Staff was very friendly ! Unfortunately not impressed by the food at all. Biscuits and gravy was bland no flavor. Turkey sausage was hard. Pecan  pancakes would have been better with less pecans in them. The hash brown casserole was okay , Eggs & turkey bacon were cooked good . It's confusing how the mix everything on small plates too . They put my husbands and I food together , my children ended up having 2 plates each taking up too much room and making it more difficult to move food around so I could cut there pancakes  . I have 3 children , so those of you who have few kids understand this lol .

We were the next party to be called however a woman complained to the manger Daniel Nicholson in which that woman and her party had arrived later than we did and he gave her our seating. We had to wait additional minutes to be seated even though we were next to be called. Their costumer service is very poor. I believe everyone is equally important and everyone should be treated equally.

Anyway, once seated we were greeted promptly by our server Jacque ( I hope I spelled that right).  Jacque made our experience very pleasant. My girlfriend and her parents were grateful for the flexibility when it came to switching out items on the combinations they chose to better suit their desires. The food was awesome.  I tried momma's pancake breakfast with a side order of hash brown casserole.  The pancakes were cooked perfect with that delicious crisp around the edges. I love that the pure natural syrup comes in a small glass bottle, although one bottle is not enough for the three pancakes you get with that meal I was still very satisfied. You get a choice between sausage and bacon, I chose the sausage and thought it was fine but my party thought it was to salty.  The hash brown casserole was a nice addition to the meal for some extra flavor and texture.  I made sure to purchase a box of the pancake mix for my cousin Ola (the person who recommended this place) for telling me about this place.

When the food finally arrived it was average tasting. The worst part was, it was warm, not hot. Cooked food should be served HOT! My dish was a lunch with fried catfish, mashed potatoes and whole kernel corn. It was just barely ok, because it was just barely warm.

I stated there was a hair in my mother food and he stopped me half way through my sentence and stated "" And I took care of that"" ( extremely rude tone) very disrespectful.

The parking lot was full and there was people waiting outside, so it was pretty busy. As you enter the restaurant, there is a store front where they sell various items from toys, gadgets, clothing, and decor. It was interesting. Our wait time was about 15-20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering the amount of people there. I peeked into the dining area and noticed that there were lots of tables and seating, most of which was occupied. I was glad to see this because it meant that even though there was a lot of people waiting, people would get seated shortly since there was a lot of tables. 

I ordered the hamburger steak, eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy. This was all included in one meal! So if you like large portions of food, you will not be disappointed here. The food was pretty good. It was equivalent to other diner style restaurants and I was not disappointed. Their biscuits were fluffy, and the gravy was thick.

Okay...except they took at least 8 other people before us.  I noticed they sat all their parties of 4 (we were a party of 3) before us which didn't make sense because of course they had to sit us at a 4 top. We weren't asked if we wanted breakfast menus (which we did considering we got there at 10:15am).  I had to ask for them in which the waitress brought them right over.  I felt very rushed by our waitress. She gave us maybe 3 minutes before she asked if we were ready to order.  Luckily I had known what I wanted since I've been to other locations several times.  The food took another 45 minutes! (mind you we ordered breakfast!).  When we got the food my french toast & sugar cured ham were both cold! My son & daughter's pancakes were hot (so mine was obviously done first).  I didn't say anything because after 3 1/2 hours of getting to the restaurant I was starving!  The food itself was good. Just not amazing since it was cold.  The $6 piece of ham I got was very small, I cut very small pieces & only got through 1/2 of my french toast before it was gone. The poor experience I had was definitely due to the high volume.  It was odd though because there seemed to be an abundance of bussers who appeared to not have much to do.

I personally was introduced to Cracker Barrel two years ago, but my husband has been eating at them for years and years. His mom and him LOVE it because they are from Texas and always say they can count on good southern cooking. Unfortunately this visit was not the case. It started with my husbands silverware being dirty, we went through three different sets. 

When our food arrived we were shocked. My husband and I ordered the same meal, the chicken and dumplings plate. I honestly should have taken a picture but I was more caught up in dealing with the situation. When our meals arrived my husbands plate had literally half the amount of chicken and dumplings on it than mine did. Extremely confused we showed our waitress who quickly went to the kitchen to get more. You could tell she did everything she could to help, but the silverware was a dishwashers issue and the food was clearly the cooks. 

The times I have been to Cracker Barrel with my husband I always eat breakfast. Wanting to try something new he swore by the chicken and dumplings as this is his go to dish. After getting clean silverware and the correct portion, we started eating. After a few bites (and asking for hot sauce) he asked me what I thought of if. I was honest and said it was the most bland thing I had ever eaten and was confused why he liked it so much. The look said it all. He was just as upset. He said it had never tasted like this and was thrown off by the whole experience. 

For the next 10-20 minutes we were continuously asked if we were done eating as it was clear they were wanting to rush people. This was done by bussers and other wait staff not our waitress. 

Finally we finish our meal and go pay. We're asked how our meal was and we say ""not so good for xyz reasons"". The response? 

""Your total is 43.18""

Wow. Thanks but no thanks. Spend your money elsewhere!!!

But, one our friends REALLY wanted to go there, and she was willing to go early to put our name on the list, so off we went.
We did wait for a while, but we rocked in the chairs out front where it was shady and the time went pleasantly enough. Then, we were ushered in to be seated in the most crowded, noisy environment possible. They were cramming way too many people in too small of a space. Everyone was bumping the person behind them, the servers couldn't get between tables, and you had to take a scenic course to get to the restroom. etc. Hated it.

I vaguely remembered visiting a Cracker Barrel in AZ, and it being a pleasant experience. After my memory was refreshed by this visit, I remembered liking the cute store, the little peg games, and the hash brown casserole. Virtually everything else was an example of home cooking from someone who was not a very good cook.

The servers were pleasant enough, but they brought everyone's food at a different time; my sister's toast was cold and unbuttered, and they brought out rock hard butter LATER which could not be spread;my server asked which two sides I wanted with my sandwich then charge d me for both when it turned out there was only supposed to be one.

They force you to go stand in line in the gift shop so you might buy some extra crap, and the little old lady at the register bungled the simple operation of check splitting so badly that some people paid for things they didn't order, but wanted out so badly it wasn't worth it to try and correct it. 

Some of this could probably be attributed to a fairly recent opening, but there is nothing there that is good enough to warrant the trip, the wait, or the money. Some folks seem to think so but I bet I can guess who they're voting for for president, so disregard their opinion.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,8,3,2,KVpws-WemrR9QwEmTbrP7w

Super cool decorated also. Then we get seated for lunch. Our waitress was nice. The ambiance was also warm. Then I order the Wednesday special. Chicken pot pie, my absolute favorite. Well next thing you know our food came out and my chicken pot pie look dried out. Overly cooked and I tried to eat it. Super dry and the crust was like sand. Also I had to go and ask the manager for silverware. She looks over at my table and makes a joke.  Says today is eat with ur hands. Lol.  Ok no big deal. Then I had to ask another waitress to find my waitress. She finally came and I showed her my meal. She said oh that doesn't look good. I think it was the last one. I replied to her that it shouldn't of came out of the kitchen. The chef can obviously see its over cooked and shouldn't serve it. And she brought it out to me. She can see it's not edible.

3407545,2016-11-21,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Sunday morning, I decided to see what all the hoop-la was about and check out Cracker Barrel. I went on the web site to find out the address. While on the web site, I noticed a reservation link. I clicked on the link and made a reservation for 2. The web site stated that there was about a 40 minute wait.  It took me about 50 minutes to get to the restaurant. Once I arrived, I checked in with a man at the podium. He told me to wait in the store and my name will be called shortly. As soon as I entered into the store, I heard my name being called on the PA system.  After being seated, Joseph our server acknowledged us and said that he will be with us after he delivers the food for the neighboring table.  Several minutes later, Joseph welcomed us and went over the menu. I settled on the pork chops with eggs.  The price was very reasonable ($11.50) and my wife settles on the pancakes.  The food was delivered fairly quickly  Joseph checked back with us frequently and even the managers (2 of them) asked how things were. I asked for some coffee and the manager himself got it for me. The food was very good too. I didn't like the hash browns, and the server immediately replaced them with something else.  The food was so good that I even ordered stuff for take-out.  After we finished eating, I went into the store and bought some misc. food items.

I will definitely return here again. I strongly suggest that you use the web site reservation feature in order to eliminate or reduce your wait times.",GXanDpgw2di3TrpYv3y0_Q,0,0,4,iAwD_DtExfKq9c77HpwTGw
3418345,2016-07-26,7,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"So I came here on opening day.....great idea right? Not really, but a friend wanted to go so we went! 

We were told it would be about a 2 hour wait and were seated in about an hour and half. They were turning tables pretty quickly. What else is there to expect going on opening day? Not to mention opening week. If you plan on coming, then expect a wait for the next week or two at least!! If you complain about the wait, you're a new kind of special. 

The place was packed to say the least, both the store and the restaurant. The seating area outside was pretty packed as well but as they turned tables it slowly got less and less packed. I think people came in waves lol 

After we were seated we were greeted by our waitress who had a member of the training staff with her (red shirt) and she took our drink order. It didn't take any longer than expected for the drinks to come out. We noted that the tables were cleaned up pretty quickly for another party to be seated. 

The service overall was pretty good, they had people coming around checking on tables to make sure the drinks were filled and what not. The assistant managers were checking on tables to make sure people were happy, etc. It's to be expected for opening day. They probably had double the staff on hand working and training. 

I ordered unsweetened ice tea which is pretty much the same where ever you go. The rest of our table had sweet tea, orange 'n cream, and apple cider. The drinks were all on point. I'm not a huge fan of apple cider because I can never find ones that I like, but their apple cider is on point! The sweet tea wasn't overly sweet, which was good for me but my friend likes it extra sweet so she dumped another two packs of sugar into it! 

Our table had Chicken and dumplings platter, rainbow trout dinner plate, and the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast. We all shared a bite to see what everything tasted. The difference between the platters and dinner plate is the size of the entree and an extra side. I got the rainbow trout  with corn and mashed potatoes. It wasn't anything special but good none the less. I just wanted something light and not heavy like the rest of the foods. I tried a bite of the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast and that was nice and moist. The Chicken and dumplings were on point as well. We didn't have anything bad but nothing was THAT great to me but nothing was bad either. 

This was the first time I've ever been to a Cracker Barrel restaurant and it wasn't a bad experience at all. I definitely want to try their breakfast and a few other items that caught my attention.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,11,10,4,uvN_sLrYCuhqC26yz7hdiw

3431153,2017-04-22,1,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"So I've heard so many good things about this place and I know people stormed this location when it first opened up in Las Vegas. I always wanted to try it but we never had the time or the patience to wait in the crazy lines. 
Well we finally came to try the place and we were not disappointed! As you walk in there's a little shop with clothes, candies, old fashioned soda pops, little trinkets and a bunch of other stuff. I almost got too distracted and wanted to shop but hubby was too hungry to allow that. 
We were quickly seated and our server Suki was immediately there taking our drink orders. Now I know they're just drinks but the sweet tea and raspberry iced tea were both amazing. Not too sweet and still had the tea taste unlike other places. 
I ordered the spicy grilled catfish and hubby ordered the country fried shrimp. Each entree came with 3 sides so we ordered the ""dumplins"", hash brown casserole,  whole kernel corn, macaroni and cheese, sweet baby carrots, and homestyle fries. We were also served complimentary biscuits and corn muffins.

Biscuits were ok, a little dry but my puppy loved the leftovers. 

Corn muffins were not what we were expecting at all, they were quite tasteless and a little too ""cornmealy"". 

""Dumplins"" were delicious and were served in a delicious gravy (I usually hate gravy so this is a pretty big deal).

Hash brown casserole was very good, too rich to finish but it was one of our favorites. 

Whole kernel corn was decent after we put some salt on it. 

Macaroni and cheese was very rich!

Homestyle fries- fries are fries lol

Sweet baby carrots were amazing. I told my husband the next time we go, I'm just going to order the carrots for my 3 sides. 

Country fried shrimp was great, they were served with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Very crispy and a good size as well. The hush puppies that were served with them were also very good. They were perfectly cooked.

The spicy grilled catfish was packed with flavor and grilled to perfection. It's easy to overcook fish but this was done perfectly!

Overall, 4/5 for the food! It's definitely a comfort food place. 5/5 for the service! Our waitress, Suki was super sweet and very helpful! We will be back!",JddUKeXfP0lhsxrEkoCBPQ,2,2,4,FLHnAhNfCjH6G9ePz6DtLA

Only paid $105 which includes tax and tip (6 adults and 4 kids) and we were stuffed!

Mistakes - gave us fries instead of mashed potatoes, forgot onions for a burger, forgot apples for a Sunrise sampler, and eggs were scrambled as usual instead of ""lightly"" scrambled as ordered.   As soon as we told the server, he brought out the needed items.  
Other service notes - brought 10 biscuits to start and they were gone in a flash (party of 10), then took about 15 minutes to bring more - our meals actually came out before the second round of biscuits; had to ask a couple of times for gravy

During those 15 minutes I spent my time in the ""country store"" looking at useless stuff for sale. I remember that other Cracker Barrel's in the south sold cute things and yummy treats. This location has very few treats and a lot of junk. Even so, it was wall to wall people and very hard to get around the store. 

We were seated against the wall and even with the shade drawn down I had sun beating against the side of my face and the other lady had sun directly in her face. Nothing could be done about it except squint. When the meal was almost over, the sun did move so it wasn't so bright.

I ordered pancakes and eggs, two ordered meatloaf, and one ordered chicken fried steak. My pancakes were really good and cooked just right. Fluffy on the inside and a crunch on the outside. Grits were served but they weren't that good because they were runny. Biscuits and cornbread came but neither were very tasty. Easily skipped.

Today I called to cash in on my free meal and explained to the person who took my order and the person who gave me my food the order was free because they messed up my order yesterday.  Get home and, wouldn't you know, missing food again.  This time I turned around and went back up there to get it and now I'm at home eating cold ass eggs.

It's not worth it to make multiple trips for what ends up being subpar, cold food.  Until they get their operations together, I won't be back.",qzUTmp4h4e1ohUUOmKpNQw,8,0,1,yDDWAJFqhYr0z-vzR-dFVw

3661889,2016-09-12,4,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"I had high expectations of this restaurant, since I heard this place has very long wait times. My family and I have been waiting to come here for months now. However, I was really disappointed in most aspects of this business, mostly in respect to the food and the service.

Atmosphere: Awesome place. I love the decorations and the country theme. At the back of the menu, there was a story of the origins of Cracker Barrel, which I found super cute. I am not sure if it's true, but I like the idea when people were done with the stuff inside the barrel they used the barrel to play games (ex. chess) on top. The best thing I got from this experience was the mini game at our dining table. This game involved jumping pegs. The goal is to have one peg left. I generally love logic puzzles, and I played this game throughout breakfast (because of the long wait time and horrible food). I even bought it at the store next door, so I can figure the game out. This game seriously made my breakfast better. 

Service: We got there once it opened for breakfast and was seated immediately when we arrived. I was surprised that there were so many people there already since the place opened up 5 minutes prior. Once we got seated, everything went downhill. It took 20-30 minutes for a server to even come to us for our orders, and we even saw other tables getting frustrated because they were also attempting to place their orders. Once we finally placed our orders, it took them a very long time to give us the food. Maybe it's too early in the morning for people to work? Oh maybe, they really want to replicate the Southern attitude by being slow (I am being mean since they were rude to us). On top of that, our waiters gave us the wrong dishes, dishes that we did not order. When we told them their mistakes, they just apologized and did not try to correct their mistakes, except for the incorrect eggs. I guess they don't want generous tips. My dad also thought people were borderline racist, especially the manager who said hello to all the tables in the restaurant who had white families, except for us. But I have no proof of this. I can forgive bad service, if the food was decent.....

Food: Two words - bland and dry. Not sure how they turned food that I really enjoy into these dishes. I can make better these dishes better even though I am not a cook. I ordered Grandpa's dish (biscuits and gravy with fried chicken). Besides the gravy (which was the BOMB) and the eggs (tasted like eggs), everything including the hash, fried chicken, and biscuits were pretty horrible. I also requested the special butter they had for the biscuits. They were jam-like, and we did not see how the biscuits and that ""butter"" went together. I honestly prefer real butter or just a regular berry jam over this concoction. I ate one bite of each of my food, lost my appetite for food, then played my logic puzzle game. McDonald's was honestly way better than this. Denny's would have one Michelin star and Black Bear Diner will have two Michelin stars if other restaurants have to be compared to this place. 

Overall, the food and service are LESS than alright. I am not sure why the wait time is so long, maybe it's for the dinner which we haven't tried. This is a prime example of an overrated place. My family and I are pretty scarred from this experience and probably won't ever come here again, even if they paid us to. Hmmmm....maybe if they paid us to...but I probably only order the eggs (which they probably will get my order wrong and it will take more than an hour to even get) and gravy to-go.

Recommendation: Save your valuable time and go to Egg Works. You won't be disappointed. I come to Las Vegas 4X a year, and all the locals know about this place.

Update: They were not very good at making the food look decent. Just imagine the individual components that you get on a plate. TA DA.",V_V5GvasPh3XWx4GLmVfyQ,6,4,1,3vkCABcUJLL06ISsQu_5Yw

When looking for directions in Yelp we noticed only 3 stars which should have been a warning.    The portions are notably smaller and the much beloved chicken fried steak was merely okay but the biggest disappointment was the hash brown casserole which was so heavily laden in garlic powder the you could not taste anything else.

The wait times are long which is pretty normal for this chain.  There is a system that allows you to put your name on the waitlist online ahead of time to reduce the time spent once there.
The greeter had a fake smile and no warmth to her at all.  She gave us grossly inaccurate wait times, stating 90 minutes when it was about 20 minutes and had a self-satisfied smirk as we discussed whether we should go somewhere else.

The waitress was friendly but not particularly enthusiastic about her job.  She got several components of the order wrong and had to be reminded a few times.  A manager or supervisor came around to check on the tables which was appreciated but really didn't do enough to overcome other issues.

The food is always the most important component and was an abject failure.  Nearly every component of the food served was inadequate.  Eggs over easy came over medium and over hard.  The buttermilk biscuits were underbaked and we had to bring them home and put them in the toaster oven for 5 minutes to fix them.  The gravy and sausage was somewhat bland.  The cheesy hash brown potatos were not cooked all the way and the potatoes were still somewhat raw.  They were again better after microwaving at home for a few minutes.

3889218,2018-02-11,3,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Definitely a solid 2 stars - unfortunately.  I was very excited to try Cracker Barrel because a lot of my FB friends raved about it.  All the food was very underwhelming.

ATMOSPHERE
The establishment is very cute.  I loved all of the decorations they had.  It was all very rustic and really encompasses the epitome of what I imagine a cabin in the country would look like.  I loved it.  It's the reason why I gave this place 2 stars.

CUSTOMER SERVICE
Customer service was great.  From the hostess to the servers, they do a good job to make you feel welcome and a good job taking care of you. 

FOOD
I ordered the EGG SANDWICH and the BISCUITS & GRAVY WITH BACON.  The sandwich was fine.  I ordered my eggs over medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The yolk was a little runny, but all the whites were cooked through.  Runny whites remind me of snot.  Gross!  The sandwich comes with the eggs (2), a few slices of tomato, and mayo on sourdough bread.  It was good.  Especially because I added the bacon that came with my biscuits and gravy to it. SO GOOD!  Except, I like my bacon chewy rather than crispy - which is how they make their bacon there - crispy.  

The BISCUITS & GRAVY was very underwhelming.  The gravy was very bland, and the biscuits, although cooked well, were good, but nothing memorable.  Even after adding salt to the gravy, it still didn't fix it.  I feel like it needed more sausage or something.

My friend ordered the SAMPLER PLATTER which came with eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, grits, and biscuits and gravy.  I tried the sausage and it had good flavor, but was overcooked and VERY dry.  The ham was overly salty.  The grits were bland... Not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but, it wasn't pleasant. Even after adding some butter. 

OVERALL
For the first time trying this place, I definitely wasn't wow'd.  I'm not sure what people were raving about because the food that was served to us was sub par.  Sorry, Cracker Barrel, I definitely will NOT be a returning customer.",vZ81T8pAXintx72RyYgT3g,1,0,2,KjXxGg8HtDMwmmV1s-LHow

I usually get the pot roast dinner and it was very fatty, the muffins were dry, and the service was average.

I also ate breakfast there and when I received the bacon, it was cold, not good ""since I'm a meat and potatoes"" guy and grew up in the Midwest.

Even though we gave it a few months before we attempted to visit Cracker Barrel, it was SOOOOO crowded!

Seriously, the walk-in wait was at least an hour and a half for a Saturday morning!  Luckily we used the online wait list on the Cracker Barrel website to reserve us a table.  Wait was still 45 minutes, but much of that time was taken up by us driving across town to get to the restaurant.  If you have the option to use the online wait list I suggest you do it!  Unless you LOVE sitting outside in one of their many rocking chairs.

Cracker Barrel entry was pure chaos!  Even walking into the restaurant you're greeted with a crowd swell of people.  That's probably because the restaurant itself is connected to their 'old country store'.  Which is speak for, ""Please spend way more money with us then you ever intend to!""  We still had a 10 minute wait before being seated so we wandered around the country store to see what goodies we could find.  Very kitschy but kinda fun just to look.  However be careful because you need to control traffic with the TONS of other folks walking the store, not to mention the line of people waiting to pay their food bill!  Be prepared to be in tight spots.

Coming to Cracker Barrel on a weekend can almost be considered a mistake.  The restaurant is so busy and CROWDED!  Really, there was not one empty table when we dined that day.  Soon as one was cleaned up it was almost immediately filled with the next party.  That being said, service was a little rushed.  Our server was brand spankin' new (like as in he started 2 days prior) so he was still trying to get around the menu and the restaurant service.  He answered our questions to the best of his knowledge, got confused a few times but was pretty apologetic about it.  Our family ended up ordering:

-Sunrise Sampler (2 orders) - 2 eggs cooked to order with grits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole, homemade buttermilk biscuits, sawmill gravy, smoked sausage, country ham & thick-sliced bacon

-Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast - 2 eggs cooked to order with grits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole & smothered country fried steak

Order took a long while - nearly 30 minutes!  I ordinarily would start to throw a tiny fit especially at breakfast but this is what I signed up for with an overcrowded place with fairly new staff.  Thankfully though our food arrived still very hot.  Fresh @$$ biscuits!!  These were the first thing I jumped into, and damn they were worth the calories!  Buttery, a little flaky, warm - delicious with a side of apple butter or some fried apples on top!  I ate 3 of them before I could notice.  Don't hesitate for a refill of biscuits, our server was more than happy to give us a few more.

Our breakfast platters ended up being just so-so, just OK.  Food was warm but the over-easy eggs were overcooked so they weren't as yolky like I like in the middle.  The hashbrown casserole was kind of a one liner - I really don't like soggy potatoes, I wish it was fried on the flattop with a more crisp exterior.  For myself at least, the samples of sausage, ham & bacon weren't anything special.  Tasted just like the breakfast meats you find at your average breakfast diner chain.  Wifey said her country fried steak was tasty - I did have a bite and I have to agree.  Was fried well, and covered with that white gravy it was so rich, after a few bites it would probably be too much.

The food was overall OK with us but very HEAVY, some stick-to-your-ribs type affair.  We had a lot of leftovers to take home with us, even after we were done we still had 2 full takeout boxes!  

It's not particularly cheap to eat at the Cracker Barrel, for our family of 3 it ended up coming to over $45 easy after tax + tip.  Just above average pricing for breakfast but still, I like value ya' know??  I could have gotten breakfast at other restaurants for less.  But we were glad we made the drive at least once to check out Cracker Barrel.  No longer have to really drive here though to have it again...we now have one on our side of town right near Craig road!  May have to visit this one the next time I get a biscuit craving!

Saw this place as we were driving by on the 15 & have always wanted to try them as we continually see commercials in town & have never seen one around, so we wound our way back to find a 45 minute wait, which made us think maybe it was a pretty good chain place to go... WRONG!

First, the customer service could use some improvement.  The lady out front taking names was friendly enough, but the waitress not so much.  Without being downright rude, she was about as unfriendly as you could get.  Very curt when speaking w/ you, sort of just drops the plate in front of you & if you want a refill or something, you practically have to turn into one of those guys on the runway of an airport w/ the light sticks to direct airplanes flailing your arms all around.

Second, the menu/specials are confusing.  They have a chicken fried steak breakfast & a separate one for lunch (only the lunch one is on the menu... other one was a special).  The breakfast one comes w/ 3 sides, none of which are any good... NO eggs, bacon or sausage (just things like mushrooms, etc.).  So, since you can't order breakfast items w/ your breakfast, I chose the lunch version & except for the French fries, the selections are just about as bad... enough so, the fries were the only thing I wanted as a side.  They offered to do 2 of the sides as fries, but not the 3rd for whatever reason, so I ordered a salad that my wife wanted.

& third (& most importantly), the food... practically inedible!  Not sure if all Cracker Barrels are this bad, but this one was disgusting!  Back to the aforementioned salad... it was basically a small salad w/ a TON of dressing on it... yuck!  The French fries were dry, stale & chewy. The chicken-fried steak tasted like it went through a conveyor belt, had some premixed breading that's stored in a plastic bag stamped on each side, flash fried & then flash frozen for shipping.  The gravy was pure white & tasted funky.

I had the Lemon Pepper Trout and it was awesome.  My spouse had fried catfish which was also excellent.  What I like best about this place is the sides.  Between us we had beans, greens, mac-n-cheese, sweet potato, and dumplings.  All of them were great.  This place is brand new so I forgive them for the wait.  They have a few kinks to work out, but for a place that's still having a grand opening it was not bad.  Our 1-3/4 hour wait was really only 1 hour and was worth the wait.  The country store has enough to look at for an hour to kill the time.  I will be back often.

I will admit to crying tears of joy upon learning we were getting this fine establishment.  When I am in need of some hearty, delicious Southern breakfast, Uncle Hershel always delivers. Always.

This Crack Bar is consistent. I've gone on a weekday, a weekend and even PostMated it. I am not ashamed.  The wait times are minimal, but if you find yourself waiting before the heat kicks in, mosey out to the porch and find a rocking chair. No matter what ails you, a rocking chair is the cure.  Once your name gets called and you find yourself in the cavernous dining room (all Crack Bars are loud), be prepared for fast, friendly service. My biggest complaint about CB is that service is hit or miss. Not so here. We have always had great service and a visit from the manager to check on us. A+

Now for the food. My ability to make recommendations is severely compromised by the fact that I literally order Uncle Hershel's Favorite every single time. I can tell you the biscuits are crunchy, the gravy is the perfect consistency (no glue here!) and the food is hot and fresh.  Years ago, I was a big fan of the veggie plate for dinner but I haven't had dinner yet at this location. #2018Goals.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,2,2,5,5-kTgoh-Dg8HwJKq_kwXfg

I expected to wait and hour. I expected it to be noisy and packed, and the service to be a bit off because of that. But i never expected to not want to come back here after my meal. Cracker Barrel was never a place i looked to for a fine dining experience, but more like a hearty meal that was offered on the cheap and didn't taste too bad at the same time. Without going into detail on the already mentioned, horrible service, tasteless cold food, and not worth the efforts of the wait. Ill just chalk it up to saying there are far better options with the same price points and far better service and food, and within a reasonable radius of this location as well. Think twice about waiting in the heat for 45-60 minutes to eat sub par food, as its likely you will leave with disappointment.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,12,1,2,zJ32S7oAMPLmahTQvfu80A

4146987,2017-03-29,1,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"We all got gift cards to Cracker Barrel for Christmas so the next time we were all together the family could go to dinner as we did tonight. Our first visit to this restaurant started out smooth enough. I arrived first and put in my name for a table for five. There was no line then. About 10 minutes later the rest of them pulled to the door and we stood in line waiting to be seated. We were taken to the back about 5 minutes after we got to the host station.

Having never been to Cracker Barrel before, we all took several minutes to look over the menu. We ordered iced tea all around and continued to decode what to order. When our drinks came out, my step mom, my dad and my aunt were given theirs first. As our waitress came around to my grandma the drinks fell and Grandma took a bath. Top to bottom she was pretty well soaked. The waitress apologized and very quickly brought a few towels to mop up the floor, table and chair. She also patted down my Grandma a little bit. She had already taken off the wet jacket but her pants, which were also wet, stayed on leaving poor Grandma wet and cold. Her meal was comped later after my aunt raised a little hell over the accident. We placed our food order shortly after the excitement had died down.

I ordered a Cracker Barrel Sampler. This comes with chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ham with three sides. I ordered turnip greens, green beans and hash brown caserole. Meals also come with a choice of bread. I got both corn bread and a biscuit so I could try it all. The chicken and dumplings tasted good but I was disappointed that there was just one small piece of chicken. And the dumplings were like giant noodles. Not what I am used to but more traditional or so I am told. The meatloaf was a little bit spicy and very moist. I am probably in the minority here but I prefer a dried meatloaf with a nice crust. This was good though. The ham was just a small piece and very salty. Nothing more to say on that. The green beans were not at all exciting. I can tell they are canned beans and rather mushy. The turnip greens were good. Kind of like spinach but more grassy. They had nice shredded bits of pork mixed in. And the hash brown casserole was the best thing on my plate. Cheesey potato goodness. They only thing that could make that better would be a little more of a crust on top. 

The corn bread was just not good. It was dry, dense and over cooked. Some of the muffins were almost as dark and the rocking chairs out front. The biscuit, on the other hand, was good. Soft, warm and fresh. I'd stick with that for a bread option. 

The house salads my family ordered looked good but it was discouraging to see some of the dressings came in individual packs like you see at fast food restaurants. In fact, I recognized the Mezetti packaging from fast food. I'm not saying Cracker Barrel should make their own dressing in house but do they really need to bring you dressing packets?

My step mom and grandma both ordered the 8 oz. sirloin steak. Both ordered it medium-well. My grandma even said she didn't want to see any blood. The two steaks were done completely different. My step moms was medium-well. My grandmas was more medium and even close to medium-rare. There was blood. She still ate about half.

We also passed around a couple of orders of fried apples tonight. They remind me of the apple dessert I used to get in frozen dinners. Only this was more fresh. I suppose these were pretty good apples but they were very sweet. I would pass on them were I to go back.

A few final notes, I like the store. There are a lot of country goods in there. And some old fashioned candies and sodas. The restaurant decor is cool. I love seeing the antiques. There is a sign in there I would love to have in my garage. Too bad its not for sale. 

This place is OK but I'm not a huge fan. I wish the food was better than average. And I wish it was served warmer than we had it. I will be back again mostly because there is money left on that gift card from Christmas. But Cracker Barrel is not one of those places that I will be at often.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,0,3,_3Z_qX5qAlkcJ1_SN-Q5cg

It's a freaking Cracker Barrel! And it's here in Vegas!!! So maybe a liiiiittle bit of that hype transfers over to the experience for some folks, but I can definitely see how many might feel shorted on the service or the food. I, on the other hand, had a beautiful time and am really looking forward to returning once the excitement boils over (is that ever gonna happen?)...

We were expecting a lengthy wait on post-holiday Black Friday, but we took advantage of the time to check out the Country Store for a bit. Once we were seated, bro and I ultimately decided our orders from top to bottom, put in our meals and drinks, and then....... the wait of eternity. Let's face it: this is the genesis of that triangular board peg game, and if you don't get into that (or have a fully charged smartphone), then, yes, indeed, this is going to be a PAINFULLY long wait. Not entirely unexpected, however; were you expecting a five-minute turnaround after having waited on rocking chairs outside for 2 hours???

Anyway, bro ordered the dinner sampler platter and I opted for Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast and sweet tea. Unfortunately the one thing I missed in all the excitement were the items ""on request."" So... no bread, no apple butter :( I'm sure glad my bro asked for water!

Everyone helping us was kind and efficient and very cool. Although the food did take a lengthy period of time, I can't say we weren't taken care of! Plus the food itself came out nice and fresh: meatloaf was actually tasty (sorry I'm not a huge fan of American meatloaf), chicken n' dumplings were PERFECTION, country ham was delicious, my country fried steak was awesome, as were my biscuits, gravy (a tiiiiny bit salty but still yum), and all our other sumptuous sides. Bro opted for a baked sweet potato that *may* have been the least desirable piece of our full meal, but even then it was decent. Personally one of my favorites was the fried apples!

Anyway, we were only in Vegas for the day so we HAD to make our one and only meal in town epic. So happy Cracker Barrel was able to fulfill that destiny! Thank you, sweet hostess standing outside in the cold, super chill servers, and tchotchkies-stuffed Country Store for making our Thanksgiving weekend superb!",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,2,1,4,u_yrl8E4tvcolPTevNYvKQ

Given a 35 minute wait estimate, after an hour we left without service. See below:

Arrival.....
Host: name please?
Me: Paula
Host: Colin?
Me: no, Paula 
Host: what?
Me: P a u l a T. 
Host: ok, there's a 35 minute wait.
Me: ok, thank you. 

After all that, and spelling my name for him, somehow my name was added to their app/list as Paul T.   Ok, close enough. 

We browse through the shop area and hear Megan call out, ""table is being prepared for Paul T.""  I head over to her podium. She doesn't ask my name but quickly tells me to stand to the side because it'll still be about approx 10 minutes.  Ok, no worries. I understand as I've also worked in restaurants. 

Waiting, waiting, waiting. Others who checked in after us are being seated.  Ok, More waiting. I ask her to check on my name, Paula T. or Paul T. 
She's too busy looking @ the new tattoo and putting creme on it. 
She finally says, ""your table isn't ready yet"".
Okay, I ask her to at least check for my name clarification. She didn't. 
She's very busy, but telling customers that this is slow compared to most Sunday mornings so it's no big deal. She's used to it.  I approach again to inquire about name clarification because it's been almost an hour at this point.  
She says, ""oh table for Lupe""? 
No, Paula T. or Paul T. because my name wasn't properly input by the first host outside at the front door. I'm trying to explain to her. She insisted my name must be Lupe because there is no Paula or Paul on her tablet.  
Wait a minute, you called Paul T about 30m ago so......???? 
At this point she was looking but says nobody named Paul or Paula has checked in. I remind her that she called it about 30m ago.  If she'd have listened to me, I could have explained it.  

Cutting off customers as they speak is highly inappropriate. Customer service 101.  
Besides the name mix up she should have at least acknowledged that my husband and I both had been standing in her area for a long time. 

A good hostess would pick up on that, not Megan though.  Her new tattoo was the most important thing for her. 

Left without service. 
Won't be back.

Oh wait, there is almost no gravy on my mashed potatoes, can I have more gravy please? What? You want more gravy? I ate my whole meal, except for the mashed potatoes - oh here is more tea! Yummy!

I've been reading through the reviews. This place has bad service. The management should not be shocked. He offered to pay or do something- I said no thank you and went and paid our check and we left. The food was good. :) 

A suggestion of the management should read this. Go to Lucille's for dinner. Take notes. They work like a team. They have awesome service!! They are packed as well.

My friend said her sandwich was good. It was a pretty basic sandwich. She added her bacon into it. 

My plate was blah. The eggs were fine obviously. I ordered it over medium. The sausage had a good flavor but, so dry. The bacon was good. It was nice and crispy. That's how I like my bacon. The sausage had a weird smell and it was really salty. I love salty but, this was a lot. The hash browns had a weird flavor. There was onions in it. I love onions but, it was odd. The grits were blah. I added salt and butter but, nope I couldn't do it. The biscuits were good but, the gravy lacked flavor. I added salt and pepper to it. The fried apple was a no go for me.

I was very excited when I ordered the fried shrimp dinner. Breading was really over cooked and dried. Shrimp was small too small.

Biscuits was undercooked and corn bread was really dry.  

Again, I was disappointed when compared to Blue Berry and Black Bear restaurant.  At this point I would even say IHOP and Denny's is way better. Sad right?!

Service was overly nice and the restaurant was decorated beautifully. With the Christmas decorations up, it felt like it would start snowing any moment, even in the 70+ degree November weather.
Very large menu that was hard to choose from! I settled with chicken + dumplings w/ two sides and my bf got their special of the day, which was pork chops. I'm giving three stars because the food was mediocre. It seemed to me like cafeteria food. Bland sides that could use more seasoning. Dry chicken and pork chops.

The nice thing about these restaurants is how quiet and ""grandmas kitchen"" the atmosphere is, even if they are fairly busy. Well this location is always so absolutely PACKED with rude city people the atmosphere absolutely ruins it. We went once a few months after it opened and heard nothing but screaming kids, people shouting to talk over each other, servers who were RUNNING and miserable like your average denny's or ihop during sunday breakfast. It lost the atmosphere needed for the type of restaurant it was designed to be. Cracker Barrel was not designed for a city like Las Vegas. 

The final straw that broke the camel's back is we attempted to go recently and give it one more shot only to learn that after how many decades they have REMOVED the only turkey sandwich they ever had from their menu. That is right people....a generic American chain restaurant no longer serves a turkey or club sandwich. I was absolutely floored at this. Meanwhile they have THREE different versions of fried chicken sandwiches (gross!). I was shocked and promptly left since both myself and the person I dine with are very very picky eaters and it is the ONLY thing we ever ate from their menu. Can anyone name a generic chain, low end American restaurant that doesn't have some sort of turkey/club sandwich? Dennys....IHop.....Friendlys....99.....Uno's.....? No? Didn't think so. 

Do not EVER expect corporate to give you a response either. When I called the restaurant here back I was on hold forever, got transferred to someone ""who can help"" who simply told me that item is discontinued, no idea why, you need to call cop orate. Click. If you dine at these places and have an issue you are SOL because you will NOT receive a response or resolution. I e-mailed corporate inquiring with very specific questions and NONE were answered. Why did they remove the only turkey sandwich from their menu? Did this item not sell? Are you replacing it with another similar item or any version of a turkey sandwich? The response I received was the immediate computer generated thank you someone with respond within a couple days. So yes, a few days later I received a message that was an absolute joke with a simple non-informative statement.....""thank you for your comments. We will forward them on to our marketing team.

Also, incredible food. Obviously. It's Cracker Barrel. 

In regard to the low ratings because of the wait, y'all obviously have never been to a Cracker Barrel before. There is ALWAYS a wait during normal meal times, no mater the Cracker Barrel, no matter the state. Expect 45-90 minutes on average depending on the party size.

4531876,2016-08-25,3,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"I really wanted to like this place considering there was so much hype before this restaurant even opened. 

Came here on a Thursday morning and there was a 25 minute wait...okay no big deal. We were seated and ordered our food. 

Finally got our food after waiting 45 minutes and this was probably the worse breakfast I've ever ate. We ordered the sunrise sampler and French toast. Were the eggs even real eggs? They tasted like powdered eggs. Bacon had no taste and the ham didn't look appetizing so I gave it to my husband. He tried a little piece of it and said the ham had an odd smell. The only thing that had flavor was the cheesy hash browns. 

I honestly thought that it was impossible to mess up breakfast food but this place takes the award for that. Service was poor as well, we ordered a blueberry muffin and a water with lemon and the server didn't bring either of those items. Other than childhood memories I really don't understand why people are so attached to this place.",fLJETbq1vVAKDH6TUbfPJQ,7,0,1,an0qwGcM5mGdM0gGeXEoeA

4540199,2016-11-29,15,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"I've been to many across the country and really like this place NORMALLY.   I was so excited they finally opened in Vegas and have been wanting to go so bad.

I decided to come here last night with my daughter and son in law.  The menu is interesting, it's not what you would expect from a place like this.  It was limited, meaning they do not offer a lot of sandwich choices, their main dishes are varied and the food was just ok, nothing special and nothing like the other locations I'd been to in the past.  It was actually very bland and not tasty at all.

I've always liked their breakfast, will have to see their lunch menu, but the dinner menu, I was not impressed with and probably would not go back to this location for dinner unless there is an invitation I just can't pass up...meaning I would go for the company not the food.

This place does not believe in consistency at all.  My daughter and I both decided to order the same dish a combo sampler.  Meatloaf, chicken & dumplings, ham with your choice of 3 sides.  Once my son in law arrived, he decided to order the same thing.  When my daughters and mine came out it was like WHAT???  Two identical plates with two different portions???  One plate had a huge piece of meatloaf, one was a sliver and same thing with the other two items.  Two identical plates with two different portions.  When my son in laws arrived, different from the other two???  No sauce or gravy on the meatloaf, one small piece of chicken hidden under a lot of dumplings and gravy, the smallest sliver of ham not even worthy of a taste.

I even mentioned it to our server who just looked at the plate and chuckled??  Don't get me wrong she was an awesome server but really did not know what to say.  I don't think she knew what to do and just walked away.

I'll give this place a chance for lunch one day maybe, but as for this location, they are not consistent in plating and I will not go back for dinner again.  The food was bland and really not that impressive.  First time ever I heard my son in law not like his food either.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,24,14,2,DCyC5qIAh_0Kv3cDtofEaw

Then i had to struggle to the register because the layout of this place is ridiculous and when i get to the front finally the person who should be waiting on me decides that sending a very long text is more important than my time, and by this time im dieing to get out of this noisy, cluttered, overrated, overpriced, dump they decided to call a restaurant.

4575496,2017-05-23,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"OKAY, So I wish I could write two separate reviews on this place, but I'll just include both experiences here. 

The very first time I went Cracker Barrel - amazing experience. The food was good, great portions, cheap prices, and the FOOD itself was satisfying. And to top in all off, we had GREAT service. Our server was extra attentive to our party of 4 (whom are very needy and specific about what they want). The server was very patient and fulfilled our needs. So, after this experience, we were sure that it was worth coming back to. First time visit: 4 stars

After that, I went two more times. The second time, it was not too special, I ordered the chicken tenders. The food did not ""taste bad"", it was just bland. The third time I went, I felt that the food got worse. It was bland, the mashed potatoes had no seasoning, the mac and cheese were too mushy, but the chicken was good. I even ordered the same entree I did on my first experience because I like it so much, but obviously, there seems to be some consistency issues. This experience, I would give it a 1 star, so that's why I just averaged the score to three stars.

For both times, I did NOT like to cornbread. It's dry, crumbly, and had no flavor; the biscuits are better, but taste store-bought anyway.

However, both times, I really like the coleslaw, so that's a plus, because I am very picky with coleslaw. This is my favorite place so far when it comes to coleslaw.

As for the service, can't say anything bad about it, they do an exceptional job.
I particularly like the little store on the side, too. It carries a lot of candy and pop that bring back memories of my childhood, with very cheap prices as well.

From this review, I would hope to either improve the food, or better, yet, add some consistency, because I may come back another time, and it be fantastic again, but not sure when that day will be? Does it just depend on the cook? Perhaps. But I don't want to visit on a gamble that it MIGHT be good this time around.",Yxtso_x5WiCqb71j9hNaEA,0,0,3,nuYJR7CfWCYgJ6O74faAsA
4578294,2018-05-15,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Decided to check out this Cracker Barrel because we were on this side of town after an event. I have had good experiences at their Craig location so I was excited because we were hungry! There wasn't a wait which was good because I was anticipating one it being a Saturday evening and all. No appetizers this time but we ordered the Signature Burger ($8.99), the Country Fried Steak ($12.4)9, the Meatloaf (10.99), and the Country Fried Shrimp for me ($11.49). 

    While we waited for our food our very nice waitress brought us out some biscuits and corn bread muffins. The corn bread was delicious but we had to bring it to the managers attention (he happened to be walking by and asked us), that the biscuits were very underdone. So much so that the center was gooey. He replaced them with new ones and they were fine.

    My friend, as a one of his sides, ordered a side salad so that came out first. More than a couple pieces of the lettuce were dark and beginning to rot. Then we received our dinners to which I grabbed the dish the butter had come in for the biscuits and muffins to scoop out my side of macaroni and cheese to give to my boyfriend- hey, I'm nice. I then went to eat some of my mashed potatoes and I found a black hair. It was right under the mashed potatoes on the side so it could have been from the macaroni or the potatoes. We brought it the managers attention and he replaced my meal and took the meal off the bill. Which was nice because I wasn't asking for that. But at this point I lost my appetite and had to take the food to go. Which was so unfortunate because it's seafood so it never tastes the same as it does fresh.

    I asked everyone else how their meals were and I got the following feedback
-The burger was fine, it was just generic and the fries were bland.
-The country fried steak was good and it had a nice crunch.
-The meatloaf was bland and not very good.

    Overall, our waitress and the manager were great. The kitchen I would say at this location is seriously lacking. Rotting lettuce, hair in the food and bland meals isn't going to have me return to this location. I'll stick to the one on my side of town.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,0,2,c75KUQuSq_8_IZh3MDN-Cw

4607380,2016-09-18,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,So I don't usually give reviews however everyone needs to know about this place. We waited for over an hour to be seated. When we sat down we already knew what we wanted and placed order immediately. Somehow our order got lost so waited some more. Food arrived chicken sandwich was burnt with literally 5 fries and we asked for no mayo and of course mayo on it so now it's half a sandwich because the other bun was drenched in mayo. Silverware wrapped was dirty with food caked on it. Food orders sides for 3 people all mixed up on each other's plates. The chicken fried chicken barely had any gravy on it. On top of all that yes the manager comes over and apologizes and says she will be discounting the bill and for our troubles free dessert. Well she took $4.00 off the bill and for the dessert at first it was said get what you want then when ordering was told oh that dessert is for two people so they made us share one after saying each one of us would get a dessert. The worst Cracker Barrel experience ever. Would never go back. If you want an amazing Cracker Barrel experience you might rethink this place. Nashville is where I will go back. These people are giving Cracker Barrel a BAD reputation. The only reason one star is up is because you have to at least click on one star to get posted.

Everyone raves, so I took the kids. 45 minute wait on a Monday afternoon? Ok, it's Xmas week, so they get a break. Plus the place is semi-new, so maybe they're still dealing with growing pains. But there was a gigantic line that snaked thru the restaurant - and that was for the cash register!  Food was better than average, prices were better than average. Service was slightly on the slow side, but was expecting worse when I walked in. Corporate needs to look at management here. It's obvious to an amateur that they need more servers, cooks, and cashiers on duty, so obviously they're just trying to save a buck at the expense of customer's time. Overpriced junk in store.

4610631,2018-06-01,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"What pulled this review out of negative territory was the excellent service, decor, and ambiance. If I could solely grade the menu items my review would be minus two. While Cracker Barrel is certainly in the hospitality business they are not in the food and restaurant business. I have dined at this location twice and both times were abject FAILS. I sampled the regular menu fare (we ordered many items off the menu) during my first visit and proclaimed it the worst meal I can recall at a 'restaurant.' My other daughter wanted to try Cracker Barrel so I reluctantly went back and this time thought I couldn't go wrong ordering off the breakfast menu. Second worst meal during a lifetime of dining and just as abominable as the first. If Wonder bread has a cousin they serve it at Cracker barrel. The toast was thin and highly processed. Like cotton candy, it starts dissolving in your mouth before you can chew. I had to send the 'French toast' back (trust me, the French want no part of this toast charade). The kitchen used the same Wonder bread wannabe and fried it in (what I can only guess) some sort of bland highly processed vegetable oil--the kind the FDA is constantly warning you about. How is it possible to ruin elementary-level French toast? The eggs were serviceable and passed muster. Our wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating, the decor delightfully retro-themed, and the background music scored major points. A perusal through the well-stocked gift shop and a leisurely recline in the comfy rocking chairs outside took the edge off of what would have been a disastrous dining experience. We stopped at a pizza place on the way home for some takeout so I could have a meal before retiring. Perhaps it is the transiency of their customers that drives the low standards of this particular Cracker Barrel. They could (and should) do so much better. 

Many have complained about the long wait. A wait is almost always worth it if the food is good. There is nothing to wait for at Cracker Barrel so it would behoove you to mosey on to one of many fine dining options in Las Vegas. 

To the chef at Cracker Barrel: how *is* it possible to ruin French toast and just about everything else on the menu?  This is simple, comfort food...not much to mess up. I do have a suggestion: jack up the prices (they are way too low) and use higher quality victuals.",L8CIcRYINcVz04lfOuGp0g,1,0,1,2YxIsFvP0U1RLQWZe9aH3g

4720980,2017-08-15,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"If you like good old fashioned southern food, then Cracker Barrel is the place for you. They have a huge menu, big portions, great prices, friendly service, and tasty food, which is pretty much all the points a restaurant needs to get for a great review in my book.

This was the first time I have been to this Cracker Barrel, and all my other experience with Cracker Barrel's has been in Arizona. It was pretty much exactly like the one I have been to before, with rocking chairs on the patio area (no outdoor dining, just to wait) and a shop full of country style knick-knacks in front of the dining area. They also sell some off brand soda's and candy.

The menu here is one of the biggest I have ever seen at any restaurant, to the point that they even have a huge list of side dishes (well over 20). We had Lisa for our server, and I swear she gave the best menu rundown I have ever heard. She knew everything and could answer any question, and was just one of the friendliest servers we have ever had.

Entrees range from $8 to $12, and they are all southern style. They are known for their chicken and dumplings, chicken fried steak and ham, among other things. I love that they have a dinner sampler, which comes with ham, meatloaf and chicken & dumplings. As a person that loves trying different things, this is a meal for me! The chicken and dumplings is probably the best of the items I named above, as it is juicy and soaked in a delicious gravy. The ham and meatloaf were also very good, though nothing that special.

Most of the dishes come with your choice of two or three sides, which as mentioned above they have a large variety to choose from. Heck, they even have sides you can only get on certain days of the week. I got the fried okra, hash brown casserole, and turnip greens. All the sides taste great and I want to go back and try them all.

In addition, the meals come with corn bread muffins and biscuits. The corn bread is on the savory side, and I prefer sweet corn bread, but if you like it saltier you will probably enjoy it. I love the biscuits and I suggest you get a side of apple butter to go with them.

I've been to Cracker Barrel's before for breakfast, and they do a great job on that to. Just like the huge portions at dinner, their breakfast are big to. They have a breakfast sampler with ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits, grits, hash browns and gravy for around $10. You just cant beat that variety and size for the price. They also have great pancakes and French toast if you have a morning sweet tooth.

My only real criticism here is that some of the food is a little on the bland side for my pallet, but then again I'm one of those people that loves heavily spiced food, so that is largely a personal preference issue. I have also been told that this Cracker Barrel often has large wait times, though we got right in the night we came, and we were a party of five.

The biggest compliment I can give to the Cracker Barrel is that everything here taste home made. It reminds me of my grandmother's cooking, who is from Arkansas and knows here southern food. Actually my grandmother was with us when we came here and she loved everything about it.

If you want a large southern style meal that taste like it came out of someone's home kitchen, then bring your appetite and stop by here. I'm not usually big on chain restaurants, but Cracker Barrel just get's everything right. I look forward to coming here for some comfort food again.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,2,0,5,--Y0KF8vGj-mo1-aSzDqhw

Felt very welcomed , but I had 1/2 pound cheese burger , the patty wasn't that great ! They called it a 1/2 pound bacon cheese burger , but my patty was literally 5 times smaller then the bread , so therefore I just ate bread , patty is very dry ! Like they were smashing the juice.

I do want to clarify a few things though. This restaurant had only been open for 2 weeks. It is the first Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas. It's understanding that it would be busy.  

When we checked in they said 40 minutes so we decided to wait it out.  I did like the fact that they had large rocking chairs and checkers to play on the deck. You could try them out and actually buy them from the store!  (Nice touch)

The food was extremely yummy. But not sure it was worth the wait. Good thing we had trail mix with us!

Service was pretty good, occasionally one of our drinks would be empty but our server stopped by frequently. I ordered a build your own side platter. I remember ordering this often when I was younger so I decided to try it out. The green beans are AWESOME! The corn, not so much, it is clearly frozen. French fries were good, but that's hard to mess up. Mac & Cheese had the nasty fuzzy texture so I didn't eat much of that. I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup...it was yummy...but it came out barely above lukewarm. My girlfriend ordered a couple entrees so she could sample a few things and nothing was WOW in quality or taste. Overall, disappointing and not what I remembered from my childhood back east. Maybe it's because they have to import everything to the desert? Also want to mention my girlfriend did get sick from eating here.

I on the other hand had my fair share of Cracker Barrel when I used to be the road warrior crossing country. I never really loved the place but for my love I shall eat here one more time.

We arrived around dinner time. The wait wasn't long but we messed around on the rocking chair and browsed the store a little before getting seated.

The menu had a wide range of selections. Breakfast menu was also available even during the evenings. I had my eyes on 10oz ribeye steak, and slave girl got Friday fish fry. 

The fish fry came with 4 pieces of batter fried cod filets, fries and cole slaw. Slave girl told me the fish was dry and she really didn't enjoy it.

My ribeye came with 3 sides. I know my sides didn't make sense, but I got cheese grits, mashed potato, and steamed broccoli. I asked my steak to be cooked at medium rare but it came out well done. The server didn't have any issues and took it back to the kitchen. The second one was more rare, but there was no point for me kept sending the food back so I settled with the rare steak. The flavor was good but meat quality was not impressive. 

The service was strange... When we got there, we had multiple people coming to order our drinks. The real server we got was not bad but she wouldn't take our empty cups away and kept bringing new cups to the table. Eventually we ran out of room on our table and no one wanted to come take things away from the table.

The dumplings were anything but home-made, the chicken clearly not the real thing (tasted like the bags of frozen chicken cutlets you can buy at Target and Walmart where the labels advise that they've been injected with an 80% saline water solution, or something along those lines).

Fried okra had been fried long before. They were out of both honey for the biscuits and sweet potatoes. The cinnamon apples (identified as fried apples on the menu) were worse than mush.

My first visit was fabulous! The place was packed but the staff was efficient in turning tables and getting people in and out without feeling rushed. 
The food was good and service was great. Food and drinks were served promptly. The quality overall was better then your average popular breakfast chain. 

The only bummer is I have been back a handful of times and the restaurant/ kitchen itself is pretty inconsistent. I've gone a time or two and the food is great and another time or two and the food is sub par I've even been served cold, soggy food. 

One thing that is consistent is the service I have always enjoyed all the wait staff, they are friendly, accommodating and quick! I also always enjoy browsing their ""country store"" so many old timey candies, nic-nacs, cookware, toys, hats clothing... 

If the kitchen can be more consistent this place would sure be a home run.

I've had lunch once and order their daily special (which varies day to day) and it was pretty good! Portion size was more than I expected and the chicken was tender. 

I love the store! I could spend a lot of time looking around. There are some unique candies, chocolates, beverages, and jams/jellies you would not find in a regular store. They sell holiday items and decor, kids toys, and a bunch of other pretty cool things.

 On our visit to your store in Las Vegas, Dean Martin Blvd, 12/20/16 9AM. We had the most unpleasant  experience of any restaurant I have ever visited.  I have a daughter in a wheel chair and her friend was also with us that is in a wheelchair  I don't mind waiting my turn,  but when  10 parties are called ahead of me  I find that hard to accept .  The host told us they were trying to make room for us  But when a party of 7 is seated that came in after us.  I find it hard to believe that they could not make room for us. A party of 2 that came in after us including a wheel chair was also seated before us. 
 After we were finally seated.  I looked at the table next to us and the had a small puppy with them and they were passing the puppy back and forth around the table.   The dog hair was flying in my directions  I asked to speak the the manger but he failed to come by my table.  So I went looking for him and voiced my concerns  He told me they would be leaving soon. And did nothing  His name was Dan   I asked if the dog was a service dog and maybe it was being trained but he said NO it just their pet  .  I feel that is very unhealthy to say the least when food is being served and dog hair it all around.  And the food was AWFUL  cold not brought out in a timely manner.  All in all one the WORST visit I have ever had in any restaurant.  I will be telling all my family and friends to NEVER visit the cracker barrel in Las Vegas.

5218606,2016-09-07,2,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"Damn... such a shame.  Was really looking forward to the opening of Cracker Barrel.  I've been following the feeds and waiting for this place to open for months.  Saw on yelp the lines were long and the wait times were 1-2 hours, I should've looked closer at the reviews prior to coming. 

Went on a weds around 12:30, expected a wait which we were quoted 20-30 minutes which was roughly accurate, no issues there as it was expected.  Upon getting our named called for a table, we were told we'd be next up which took another 10 minutes, no biggie.  

Seating seems to be fairly cramped and for literally building this place from scratch I have no idea why they limited the tables the way they did, but it is what it is, not my call.

So on to the actual experience, somehow we seemed to be ""lucky"" enough to be there while they were training some new hires, not just one or two, but we got three all in our little section that were following around someone experienced.  Doesn't seem all that bad at first, but we ended up with 6 people standing by our table every time we turned our head along with a creepy manager, bus boys and whatever other server happened to be walking by at the moment.  Not the most pleasant experience but I'd suck it up if the food was good..... 

so on to the food... Having been to locations in other states, I had maybe an unreasonable expectation?  Being a chain I'd expect some type of quality control would have already been done to make sure the food coming out would be up to the company's standards, unfortunately I vastly over-estimated that.  Fiance got the pecan pancakes, super dense, watched her struggle to cut them, ended up eating one of them before just saying ""f it"" and was over it.  The menu and every other location pancakes typically will come with butter on them, hell even denny's, IHOP, Black Bear or any other place that serves breakfast will typically give you butter on the pancakes....The menu even advises ""real butter"" comes with it...  apparently not here though.  Ended up asking for some and instead of giving a nice little side dish with some they give her ice cold tiny packets meant for biscuits.   Oh well... 

So on to my meal... ended up getting the special of the day ""chicken pot pie"" with a biscuit and cornbread ... having eaten at another location in the past, I was hoping for the best.  The chicken in it wasn't bad, wasn't anything special either though unfortunately.  The broth/gravy, not sure what it's called in there was pretty much non-existent, there was a nice layer of grease and oil though on the bottom that apparently was meant to take it's place.  I've never had a chicken pot pie like that anywhere else and I'm fairly certain there's a good reason for that.  Feel like I've had better one's in my younger days from the grocery store.  On the plus side the biscuit was actually pretty good!!  That was the one bright spot of the entire experience!  Cornbread was dry and after a bite I was more than happy to not have another piece of it.  

So after finishing our meal and joking around about how we won't come back anytime soon, we go to pay for our meal.  The cashier asked how it was and me being a smartass jokingly said ""at least the biscuit was good!"" ... she took that as me complaining and said she'd get a manager as the only way they'd get better would be to hear the complaints, tried to tell her it's alright and I didn't mean anything really by it.... that really just feel on deaf ears and she called for the manager anyway.... *sigh* oh well, he's been called, screw it... So he finally comes up and my fiance who is usually super quiet and won't complain, voiced up about the pancakes.   I was shocked when the manager ended up being quite a dick about the situation.  Apparently in the cluster of the people around us he had come by and asked how our food was (really don't remember this, but oh well)... So apparently because she didn't voice it to him at that time, it's her fault the food was bad??  She even responded that she doesn't like to complain (which is very true)... Either way, was met with extreme attitude from this guy... They ended up comping the pancakes without much issue, really wasn't the expected result.  Honestly would've been happy just paying what we ordered and getting out of there.

Anyway... TL;DR version.... Not worth it to go.  No quality control over the food, it's just bad compared to the other location. After 2 months of being open servers don't appear to know what they are doing yet.  Manager is a dick.",6sjBweiKEIyBB2vXC3V1lw,6,2,1,QQBmalCBcP7hOLj2g1cjdA
5220155,2016-09-11,4,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"tl;dr - Trust me: There is nothing on the menu here that is worth the wait times, extremely slow staff, and the inconsiderate management. 

I have managed to sit and eat here twice since it has opened, only because the first time we came only 30 minutes after they opened and an hour and a half before they closed the second time. If you visit anytime between those hours, you're completely wasting your time. 

First off, the food is just okay. I cannot imagine waiting longer than 2 minutes for a table here. It is not anything you can't get at another restaurant chain or make yourself. Second, the wait staff is extremely slow, so you better ask for EVERYTHING you need the first time they come to your table because you'll never see them again until they bring you your check. Third, don't even bother placing a to-go order. I recently placed an order at 9am, was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, arrived at 9:25am and had to wait another HOUR before my food came out. I was in the process of asking for a refund when my food finally came out (or I would have just left). I politely spoke to the manager, just to give him a heads up on the lack of efficiency his team has in regard to to-go orders, and he literally laughed it off and didn't bother to accommodate me for the inconvenience.

Bacon was fine, hash brown casserole was amazing, biscuits and gravy were good. Server had way too many tables. We asked for things three times and she forgot, the girl who brought my biscuits dropped one on the floor and said she'd bring another (she never came back, we had to ask the server).

I have never been to a Cracker Barrel and have not had to wait, that is the common knowledge of coming to a place like this. I personally checked in online and when I arrived they said it would be about 5 minutes. If you don't want to wait I would suggest doing so and going in prepared. 

The entire staff was very friendly and very accommodating. The manager I noticed was walking around and checking in with all tables, which in my eyes is amazing customer service! Keep it up! 

I ordered the Sunday special which was 2 chicken Breast with a deep fried batter and 2 sides. It was very good, and for the price point for the portion size, I was very impressed!

Once it opened, I heard about the long lines and decided to wait until now to check them out.

My friends and I arrived around 5:15 p.m. on a Friday evening and the wait time was minimal (maybe 5 minutes max). The hostess was decent, but I was just thankful to be seated. 

Our server seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. While I can appreciate prompt service, I know when someone wants to quickly turn over a table. Regardless, our food came out promptly. We were served warm buttery biscuits, but failed to serve us their famous apple butter on the side. Two of my friends ordered the (cod) fish and chips, which included coleslaw and fries. The portions were enormous! Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak and it included three sides. I had the Old-timers breakfast - 2 eggs, 3 slices of turkey bacon, cheesy grits, and a side of the hashbrown casserole. Their idea of cheesy grits is taking plain grits and throwing some cheddar cheese on top. I mixed it myself and doctored it up with some S&P. The hashbrown casserole was extremely crunchy on top and lukewarm. Once you get past the tough top, it's rather tasty. My egg beaters were supposed to be scrambled hard with cheese, but it resembled a small omelet. My eggs were very bland too. 

We were celebrating two of our friend's birthdays and this was the first of my four pals. Their first impression of Cracker Barrel was not positive, but I assured them that this is not how they typically do things at Cracker Barrel. 

Before long, we had our checks. Our party of five were in and out in under 60 minutes.

Completely ignored by the staff yet a couple that came in way after us were sat across from us and taken care of right away. After lots more time passed I finally stopped a server that had made eye contact with me several times mind you and asked him if he could please find our server because no one had acknowledged us for so long. The server (in a surprised tone) says he'll take our order if we are ready. Ummmm...I asked for service, which meant I'm ready and have been for a long time. The food wasn't as great as I expected. The coffee was so weak that two creamers turned it super white. The silver ware was covered in soap and water stains.

I would just like to see the same service as I have always gotten at every other Cracker Barrel, which has always been excellent .",fQ9owsz3ap05vrGrTLPa4Q,1,0,3,lpBnsdqPi5PsH4FE_cV_Sw

Hubby ordered his pancakes & I got Mamma's Pancake that came with eggs & bacon that we would share. I asked if I could get Blueberry Pancakes with it-server said No Problem. Well, it was...

We waited for 15 minutes with others getting meals. Guess pancakes take longer. Got his pancakes, the eggs & bacon of my order and then got regular instead of Blueberry pancakes.  She said it was her fault & went back quickly to reorder. Hubby started on his pancakes while they were hot & we ate the eggs & 1 bacon-but they were soft-the fat was still white & the meat part was not done enough either. I asked if they would cook them a little more but no-they had to bring new ones. She was gone before I could say never mind. So more waiting :( 

My Blueberry Pancakes finally came but looked like they were fried. They were so crispy hubby could hear me crunch when I ate the edge. I ate part of one & asked for a box-hoping they would be better tomorrow. The bacon came & it was HARD. So overdone that it had to be on purpose & they cut (I hope) the fat part so it wouldn't be flabby. I put a butter knife next to it in the picture & they were dwarfed! 

I was SO NOT happy. We packed it up & left. There was another line to pay & hubby nicely said breakfast wasn't good to the girl at the register. She said nothing. Then I was even more not happy so asked for the manager. We waited again & could not even get a manager. We told the girl it was taking too long but explained what happened & she was nice & said she'd pass it on to the manager. 

We have had ok food in other Cracker Barrels so it must be how this one is run. Go anywhere else.",2z2A6ayPZmlVwZFK-uz60w,5,0,1,6Cy_El0OqQXVQd97up20ZA

Cracker Barrel as a kid was one of my favorite destinations because it had good food and a store that sold everything under the sun. Good to know it's still the same way, as it has been decades since I had been to one.

We go to the Bass Pro Shops often whenever in town and we saw that Cracker Barrel set up shop there was well. We finally got to go on a recent trip and the experience went well. First of all, if you're there during peak breakfast/brunch hours, be prepared to wait a little while to be seated. They have 2 rows of rocking chairs you can plop down on and wait while waiting for your table to be ready. Rocking chairs are always fun. I've never had one in any place I have lived in so its cool to me... And they have a ton of them.

I went with Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ($10.29) with country fried steak, scrambled eggs, fried apples, grits & all the fixins (biscuits & gravy, butter and jam). The meal was decent but the country fried steak was overdone. I still ate it cause I was starving having flown into town on the 1st flight but it could have been much better. Eggs were ok, biscuits & gravy were good. The grits were just ok too. My friends would later tell me I gotta get the meatloaf so if i do go back, I will try that. 

Alos ordered was the Sunrise Sampler (eggs, grits, hashbrown casserole,  smoked sausage, ham, bacon & all the fixins) $9.69. It was decent too. Nothing spectacular. Just your typical breakfast meats and eggs. 

Plenty of parking in a shared lot. Be prepared to wait. I think there's a way to get on the waiting list through their website. Sorry to say/see but their men's restroom was not good. They need to clean that up regularly ASAP.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,6,4,3,OmKIMjCc9ExiQI6mQGDbQw

5607387,2017-01-14,0,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"By far not the best Cracker Barrel I have ever been to.  A couple of reasons that I found for this. 

1. This is the busiest Cracker Barrel in the system and the servers are pretty much overwhelmed most of the time.  They should make it larger and space the tables a bit farther apart.  

2. This is trying to be a charming country eatery but none of the employees have any idea what southern charm is.  They have a clipped west coast flair that would be considered rude in the south.  The experience at a Cracker Barrel in Nashville is a completely different experience. 

The food is typical Cracker Barrel.  Country comfort food with a mass prepared food flavor.   The gravy for the biscuits is good while it is hot but turns to paste when it cools.   The grits are a bit bland but turn to gelatinous goo when they cool.  Very off putting.  

In general, it is southern comfort food cooked for the masses.   Either you like Cracker Barrel or you hate it, there is rarely a middle ground.  I am a fan of breakfast here back in TN, MS, and AR.  As for the Vegas location, I would leave it before I take it.

The menu is big and there is a lot to choose from. The featured food is southern cooking. I chose the special of the day which was chicken and rice served with a delicious chicken gravy and green beans, my hubby chose chicken and dumplings, and Mom chose the chicken cutlets with fried ochra and fried apples. They bring over some tasty biscuits and cornbread muffins to chew on while you wait for your food. They have a really yummy homemade lemonade which one cannot get enough of. It has a nice tart finish and I consumed multiple glasses of it. Everyone enjoyed their meal and of course saved room for some peach cobbler and chocolate cake.

Like many other Yelpers, we've been to more than 1 Cracker Barrel. We jumped with joy that this is the closest location to California, without having to drive to Yuma, Arizona for our fix.  This place is truly a comfort southern food  establishment, from getting grits to fried anything to chicken and dumplings.  Most of the food is in the ""yellow"" category so if you're looking for fresh vegs and fruits, this may not be your place.

With that being said, the portions here are puny. I said it.  Compared to my last experience in well, anywhere USA, I was so disappointed that Las Vegas serves up kids size portions compared to their other restaurants.  Normally I could share my sides with someone, and in my last visit, we hoarded our food.

They also need to figure out how to make a biscuit and cornbread. The biscuit I had was pale (as in no color) and the cornbread was hard as a rock.. you could use it for batting practice.  Even with the apple butter, it was not good, and it would take too long to flag down a server to replace both breads.

If you're a fan of CB, then stop by.  If you come on weekends after 8 am, expect to wait over an hour.  Tip: Go to the CB website and add your name to the wait list.

This Cracker Barrel is right next to Silverton Casino and is the first one in Vegas I believe. Due to this, and the location, this location gets PACKED!!! At one point, I got up to use the restroom and had to pass through layers of people waiting by the hostess stand. 

The reason for my two star review is the cramped space, poor crowd control, lacking and very slow service! 

When we were waiting to be seated, I was looking through the store. My family was waiting near the candy listening for our name. We had been told it would be 10 minutes or less to be seated. After 20 minutes or so, we finally asked how much longer. The hostess then said, ""Oh. I thought I seated you. Sorry. Just a few more minutes."" Turns out she had skipped us. While waiting, another family came up to the stand and they too had the same issue.

After being seated, the waitress quickly took our order. Drinks came quickly. Coffee was being refilled quickly. 

The food took much longer than normal for a Cracker Barrel to come out. I ordered the pecan pancakes and a side of biscuits and gravy to share. When my gravy came out, it had a film layer from sitting and my food was all just barely warm.

If you have never been to a Cracker Barrel, I would say to go. For a major chain that is in the Denny's type family to me, it's pretty good. If you have been, then I would say to skip this spot.

I went on a Tuesday around lunch time figuring that it would be slower but boy was I wrong. It was packed but the wait was only 10 -15 minutes no big deal.  Got seated refreshed myself with the menu then waited,  waited, and waited until finally someone came and took our drink order and said the server would be over soon  for our meal order. So then we waited, and waited, and waited like watching grass grow, then someone took our meal order but said our real server would be over soon. The place being packed was a good sign but wow are they under staffed or not prepared. I can't imagine what the place is like on a weekend seriously. The menu options are good on a positive note both breakfast and lunch options available and prices weren't too bad over all. We had to ask for our complimentary corn bread since it never made it to us before . Iced tea was good and little sweat. Meals were good , presentation was good too, but the service just sucked and the girl at checkout where you bring your bill to pay was miserable and rude. Id go back though for the food hoping that they've gotten better with time in the server dept.",grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,3,0,3,e89QskVBzaoSBG3WYzG8JA
5791291,2016-08-22,1,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,Jamie P. Was our server for breakfast she was very friendly and took very good care of our dining needs.... unfortunately some boy brought our food to our table dropped the monkey dish of butters onto our table as my friend was drinking her hot coffee as a natural reaction she kind of jumped a little spilling her hot coffee on her arm and lap the boy didnt even seem to care much at all didn't even ask her if she was ok. He looked like a deer in headlights been trying to catch his name but he has avoided coming near out table. But the food was delicious and our real server was great.  Update: The boys name with poor service is Ernie we had to ask another employee what the boys name was since he continued to avoid us. Ernie needs some more training in how not to drop dishes onto tables and how to apologize for his mistakes. Thank you.,rzVvjG60SH0mWRecW44SXQ,0,0,4,sbR0jXZw_iPI3-2TuMaWEw

The servers are trying to get you out of there quickly, and the food is nothing to write home about. I was constantly bumped by the table bussers, and only one apologized. One waitress almost dumped tea from her pitcher on my head. Customer service wasn't great, and overall my husband and I just weren't impressed.

I was outside with my 3 toddlers, as we were making our way into the restaurant, there were so many people, blocking the path. By the time we made it to the restaurant seating, they called us twice and gave our table away. I was disappointed.  I had to wait another 10 minutes to get a table. Then we were finally seated. Our food took forever. I asked for my kids pancakes to come asap since they havent had any breakfast. It still took a long time. Finally a manager brought the kids some biscuits and a small cup of fruit. Our food finally arrived. I had their country breakfast with the sirloin steak. Ordered it med rare, came out med well. Sent it back. By that time i was full from eating everything else. I also had the turnip greens. Why does the food taste different then the restaurants back east?

5805551,2016-09-03,2,XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ,"I had Cracker Barrel the first time last year. I'm glad there is one here in Vegas. My girlfriend has never been and I wanted to show her why I loved this place so much...but to my dismay I was disappointed and embarrassed that I raved so highly about this place.

Parking lot isn't bad, upon entrance you have the segmented parking for the restaurant and of course the vast parking lot from the casino. It's good though. We came around 830am, we knew it would be busy and may have had to wait. We only waited a couple minutes. It was busy. 

Walking into the dining area, it's cramped, but decent. They should've expanded it just a tad, or add outdoor seating it's perfect during the fall and spring months. Anyways, our drink order was taken, then a few moments later our breakfast order. My girlfriend and I ordered Grandpas Country Breakfast. About 10 mins later our food was brought out by this rude server she was skinny, tall and platinum blonde short hair...she threw our plates at us. Literally didn't say anything, just threw the plates in front of us and left, didn't bring our Apple butter or ask if everything looked right which my girlfriend got the wrong meal.

Luckily we had a server in training who came by to check on us and noticed that my girlfriend had received the wrong meal and went to change it immediately. 

Getting a refill on my coffee was nearly impossible, no one ever came around. And my eggs were undercooked for an over easy egg. 

Of course we will try this place again, I want to be able to give it 5 stars instead of 3, but the 3 is for the chicken fried chicken.",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,4,3,3,eNRmg2670pdb-zi7qNsvxg

No big deal BUT when my steak arrived all bloody when I ordered it well done ( I'm immune suppressed) that was it. Everything went downhill from there. They made me another meal,which took 20 minutes to make ( my son was done with his meal by then), but now the side dishes where cold on the new meal. The manager came to the table,I spoke to him about the situation but he was not listening.  I repeated that I'm immune suppressed and food not prepared properly can land me in the hospital. Oh did I mention they forgot my silverware twice! The final clincher was when the bill came. They charged me double... Once for the rare stk I sent back and then for the second stk that I actually ate. Get your act together Cracker Corner! It's not that hard to serve a meal that's HOT, cooked correctly and charge the appropriate amt on the customers check! After all this, it's 9:39 pm and we are just home after ""dinner""...which BTW was an awful experience.  The end result? We where hastily offered ONE free desert "" if we were still hungry"".

We came for breakfast and were told the wait was 1.5 hours. We put our name down around noon and I shopped till I was about to drop, but then they called our name. Awesome. 

We sit down and order with our waiter, Bob. Bob was great. Food was fair. Most was room temp., and nothing came out nice and hot and fresh. Kid's fries were disgusting and ice cold and not fresh and broken in half. Sent those nasties back. Bob was even appalled. Everything else was ok. 

Bought up half of the baby section of the store, paid the bill and went on our way. 

Several hours later, sent my hubs to pick up a to go order that consisted of meatloaf, a chicken salad and two kids meals and it took him longer for the to go order than it did that morning for us to eat breakfast. Epic fail. So not happy. 

Plus, their merch. prices seem higher than Arizona. They had nothing on sale because they just opened, but I don't remember nearly every single baby outfit being $25 and most of the adult outfits being $40+. I sill bought more than I should have, but I wasn't as happy with the food or prices as I remember being every other time we have went to a CB.",1yA117LUO9TJyeJxeKm8iA,3,0,3,Lvlj7UEr5rbfcoTrVvktaQ

We came here early on a Sunday (no wait) and were immediately seated. We sat for about 4-5 minutes when finally we were greeted. Not only did the waitress (Jennifer g) push for drink order, but also food order. It felt so rushed. My husband stumbled through the menu and ordered without really knowing what he wanted. We waited about ten minutes and the food came out very fast. We didn't see the server that entire time. When the food was dropped, Jennifer came back and gave us our check! She didn't check on how the food was, she didn't ask if we needed refills, just the check. We felt so pushed out, it was ridiculous. The food itself is ok. The portions are ridiculously large, but it really wasn't that great. The breakfast eat all tastes previously frozen. The one saving grace is the hash brown casserole, which is the only reason this review is two stars than one star.  After eating, we did a quick scan of the table, made sure the kids had everything, and left.  We paid with the cashier and walked to the car. At that point it had been maybe three minutes. We realized my son had forgotten his favorite hotwheels car and my husband went inside to retrieve it.  There was already a new couple at the table and he asked the hostess if the busboy had found it.  Nope, they had thrown it away.  I get it, my son shouldn't have left it, but the carelessness and lack of empathy from the staff was appalling.  The whole experience felt very ""get them in and get them out.""

It was a minimum 1 hour 20 minutes wait which is understandable since it just opened. They had rocking chairs available for customers in waiting to sit on or buy. Their store is nice, I like what they had in there and it's a good idea because it kills time.

Girlfriend and I both had the chicken dumpling with the aide of fries and okra. Sadly to say everything was bland. The corn bread was hard and dry...my daughter wasn't impressed my her shrimp and dumplings either and my 1 year old was hitting the dining table with her corn bread. Oh my.
