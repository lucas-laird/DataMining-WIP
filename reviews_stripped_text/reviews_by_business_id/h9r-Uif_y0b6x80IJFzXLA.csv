Bill came back for $30. $15 dollar Bloody Mary!We had to ask for olives, didn't come with limes or a salted rim. No garnishes and it was the house vodka. And I was worried about the casino ripping me off. $15 dollars for Bloody Mary mix and house vodka. It seems excessive. Won't be back.

I invited my son's girlfriend and her parents who also happened to be in Las Vegas to meet us for breakfast.  Should have gotten up and left after it took the wait staff 12-15 minutes to come to the table and offer us water.  Finally they took our order.   I was on the patio and went inside to look around and the place was less than a ¼ full.  After 45 minutes I asked about our order and they said the kitchen was backed up but it would be out shortly.  I have no idea what the problem was, but they finally got our food to us 1 hour and 10 minutes after we ordered.  The food was good, but the service was horrible.

The service is great, as we walked in we were greeted friendly by the staff who asked us bar or booth. We opted for bar and were immediately greeted by the bar tender, a woman named katie. As we are not from here, we decided to ask what she thought best, took her options, and were so far from being disappointed. I got an old fashion and a straight shot of their house made whiskey, while my wife got something called a bubble bath. We both were pleased with our drinks. 

As far as food goes, we got mozzarella sticks for an appetizer,  she got the irish nachos (I had to help her lol) and I got my old irish favorite ( bangers and mash). 

The food was superb, and wonderful delicous. This is not bar food. This is food in a bar. Along with great drinks and a wonderful atmosphere.",Vih6XR0KIYji_8WXWHn3SQ,2,1,5,wTaJs6xBHBh139rbHXcpYg

The salad was nice too, but I'd expect fries to be served also, but I guess I missed the side-dish paragraph on the menu.

1542371,2017-05-15,1,h9r-Uif_y0b6x80IJFzXLA,"We came in on a Saturday morning around 8:00a for breakfast.
I imagine that Saturday Vegas mornings on the strip are always a bit more low key...
This place was quiet (aside from the punk music playing on the speakers) and we were sat right as we walked in.

I opted for the Irish Breakfast, sausages, eggs, tomato, toast, mushrooms, and bacon.
The bacon was superb, cooked nice and crispy, super thick too.
The eggs were spot on too.
The sausage was delicious and I ate both pieces.
The tomato, was a bit under ripe and still had the hard green stem/core in/on it, which was annoying to cut around, but it was charred just a little, and not quite warm enough.
The toast came without butter, and none was on the table (or too salt and pepper come to think of it).

But we were hungry and it hit the spot.  It was actually really quite tasty and in addition to the free draught beer for checking in on Yelp (FTW!) the servers were nice and always checking on us.

The price was good too, maybe the best I paid for anything all week, at around $20 for breakfast and coffee I'd come here again.",uih53bykBGPNn3Lv09ofkA,4,3,4,QgGrPBaJ63b5jvc48oAHZg

So it was crowded but that's too be expected. We went to other Irish Pubs that wanted to charge money just to get into the bar! Well Rock and Reilly's welcomed is in no problem!  The best part was they had the same menu as usual besides the all you can drink wristband. The beer process were fair and you know I had to get the corned beef hash!  Even the food was tasty! I was plenty surprised at how much I enjoyed the place. The key code to get into the restrooms was a little weird though!,KPM2J4T2Jp2O0Lzqxi9QXA,0,0,4,e8D4QupkqC8fdI0D1h0nHQ

        The server (brunette) had no clue that her restaurant offered a free beer when you check in on Yelp. She also had no clue about a ""fries or salad"" option for $2.50 that is clearly on the menu. Maybe she's new to R&R idk. We ordered the fried broccolini to start and it literally is fried burnt. The broccoli heads were black and completely burnt crispy, the stems were really good and so was the flavored glaze. I had their ""nationally award winning"" Grill Cheese and Tomato Bisque soup. The sandwich was big and really good with plenty of cheese, the tomato bisque was in a serving size that seemed a bit less than a full cup even, I wanted a whole bowl with my award winning grill cheese. The soup was also good flavored but literally a thick beverage..... no hints of tomato pieces or any substance at all but that's just my preference ,  maybe thats how they want it served.  She had a veggie burger that looked like it would choke you as it was served so dry but she really liked it so there ya go. She also liked the pretzel for desert. Even though we literally were the only people dining inside their restaurant because their patio was where people were choosing to sit it seemed like I was looking out for the server quite often as if they were much busier.........
Their little side salads are really good too.",TO6JwHYg_qxaZCVQ5FJ7hg,1,0,2,pW59-CB9iruYMFqeIY5MRQ

I ordered the mac and cheese with chicken, and all I have to say is.... it was worth every penny, minute wasted. My friend ordered chicken Nachos, she did ask to please not add Onion but they still added onion to her plate. She didn't want to be that bitch that wastes food all because of onion so she pushed them aside we know things happen... but said her Nachos were ok, she will next time order something different. After we ate, we decided to play some Beer pong! How awesome is it to eat and play!!!!!!  We had so much fun it was so inexpensive but The only reason why i don't rate this place a 5 star is because they weren't crazy busy, but still felt so ignored.

We asked if they were still serving food. A very nice brunette waitress said we can seat ourselves and someone would bring us menus.   We sat for more than 10 minutes before I walked up to the bar and asked id we could get service.  The brunette waitress said she would bring us menus.  A male employee came over and dropped off menus and asked if we wanted water. We said yes.  We waited and he never returned with water. A different person took our order. Then another man walked up to our table after we ordered to confirm our order. I thought perhaps they were going to comp us something for the horrible service we received.  My husband said afterwards that they wanted to know what we ordered so they they knew which food to spit on.

2606912,2018-02-05,1,h9r-Uif_y0b6x80IJFzXLA,"We came here for the Super Bowl: did some research before hand and decided $100 a person for open bar and a guaranteed seat was a good deal. Spoke to many staff members before hand, including a manager, and determined you didn't need to purchase this package to sit and watch the game. We made a reservation (again, $100 a person) for three of us to get a wristband. Close to halfway through the game, my mom, who wasn't planning on ordering more than one drink, came to sit with us and hang out (again, we had confirmed this was ok). The waitress came by, and my mom asked to order a drink, but she said you must spend $75 if you didn't have a ""reservation"". Fine, no problem, she'll just sit and hang out. Then about 5 minutes after that, our waitress came back with her manager and told my mom she needed to leave because she wasn't going to spend the $75. No warning, no nothing, had clearly just gone and told on us to her manager. It was never communicated to us that spending this $75 was mandatory, more so just seemed like something that needed to be done if you were going to order something without having purchasing a wristband. *Not to mention, there were tons of open tables in this place, and the three of us with wristbands were sitting at a 4 person table, so her sitting with us was not losing this place any money* When we asked a manger about it, they kept saying ""the company makes us do it"" ( the company mind you, was not present and would have no idea she was sitting with us). Overall, there was just horrible communication and no common sense amongst the staff, and for people paying $300+, we should've been treated better. Basically, we should've had the 4 of us just show up and meet the $75 minimum per person, instead of having 3 of us paying $100. It would've come out to the same total price, and we could've all sat together instead of having my mom rudely kicked out. I get that it's Vegas and they want to make money, but this option was never suggested to us. They weren't willing to work with us at all, and honestly made our Super Bowl more unpleasant than it needed to be. Not to mention their TVs went out in the middle of the game so we couldn't even watch the whole thing. And they turned the sound off during the halftime show to conduct a raffle, so we missed a large portion of that as well. I'm typically not a complainer, and to be honest the food and drinks were good, I just feel like all of these issues could've been completely avoided.",3UfGEGiloxZZozccP7lr4Q,1,0,1,vpi7yr7NKU619pY789xGww

I was, of course, excited to try it! When the burger came out, I cut into it and immediately noticed a string of cheese coming off my knife. I showed my bf and he tried a bite (he's not vegan) and confirmed it was cheese. Our server (can't remember his name) was SO great and understanding. He went back to check with the chef about the ingredients. He told me that the chef said the vegan burger was a gardenburger patty made of tofu and rice and that there is no cheese in it. Unfortunately I didn't believe him and it DEFINITELY had cheese.  So I sent it back and just ended up getting a veggie wrap. Like I said, our server was wonderful and felt terrible and took 20% off the bill. However the chefs at this restaurant need to understand what vegan means vs. 
what vegetarian means. And do not market a VEGAN burger when it clearly isn't one! Very disappointed.",AxCSOXCXj_LwMjO9FlU00Q,0,0,1,6YONPSgsJw0X-f6E7w_KTg

We're seated at the bar and the bartender gives us menus and gets our drinks. The menu prices are outrageous. $9 for tater tots. $12 for mozzarella sticks. I ordered the $14.50 grilled cheese and soup. My friends ordered the 3 sliders for $16. The sliders are literally just Hawaiian rolls with meat in between. No lettuce, tomato, just a little bit of sauce. My grilled cheese had pickles in it, something I'd never seen, and it wasn't bad, but it was so simple. The sign outside the restaurant says that they have the best grilled cheeses! The soup even tasted like it was from a box. Almost forgot to mention that we waited 35 minutes for our food. We were the only people at the restaurant, no exaggeration. I could've gone back there and made 6 sliders and a grilled cheese a lot quicker.

Middle of the afternoon, it was nearly empty - but I get the sense this place is rocking later in the evening.  

But with it being that empty, service was painfully slow.  We didn't have silverware or napkins and couldn't get anyone's attention.   And the bathrooms require a code and trying to flag anyone down to get that information was not easy.  

Still, a couple of drinks and 2 big pretzels ($9 each - served with ale mustard and cheese sauce) provided enough sustenance to get back to the sightseeing.

The location is pretty good, you can definitely walk around and get the Las Vegas Strip nostalgic feel.
I definitely enjoyed walking around afterwards and people watching.  
This Pub has the best Irish Nacho's I've eaten. The Cheese was the best part, it had a delicious taste and savory feeling. I definitely would of been fine with just the cheese and toppings, but at last I love potatoes too much.  So I would definitely recommend the Irish Nachos they'll definitely satisfy the beast within, best part is It pairs well with beer.
I also like that you can park right near the location and pay $$, but you can get a refund if you bring your receipt. Definitely worth heading over and checking it out.  I definitely will be back for more food and drinks- hopefully with more friends so we can play some of the games, or watch the game on the screen and share some drinks.
