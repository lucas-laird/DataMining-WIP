46319,2017-04-17,0,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"After a great weekend in Vegas my boyfriend and I decided to head downtown to have lunch and gamble a bit before heading back home. I have been to the Golden Nugget, where this restaurant is located many times, but never ate here. Oh man, I was pleasantly surprised. I went in expecting typical Italian fare, a la Olive Garden, but I got much more. The calamari appetizer was amazing, tasted fresh and not too over fried. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, while my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Marsala. His came with an Italian salad, which was also pretty good for a salad. When our meals came we were amazed by the portion sizes. If I wasn't starving I probably could have saved half for another meal, the chicken piece was about the size of my face. Not even kidding. The boyfriends Chicken Marsala was about the same amount of chicken, just cut up and laid over a bed of mushroom risotto. Everything that I tasted here was amazing and the service was on point. I will for sure be back next time I come to town.",R_BKOYf9ZBykeDXoWw0gAQ,0,0,5,yuTWkAqXAK-0KTNI3hLV9Q

89496,2012-04-13,1,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"We came on a Friday night for dinner, and booked a table through Open Table. And we are also Landry Club member. So we would think that it would be a nice dinner. It turned out that the dinner was an upsetting experience because of a very bad server.

We ordered a Capricciosa Pizza and ONE caesar salad. When the salad came, we were given 2 half salads. I was already feeling weird about it. When we ordered, we did say A caesar salad. We didn't say ""two half caesar salads"". And we weren't asked if we would like to split it too. But it came out split. So I wasn't sure what was going on. I didn't even know that we would be charged more for comsuming the 2 half salads. We just thought that maybe they were nice enough to split it into 2 portions. We weren't asked at all so and the menu didn't even state any option of half salad of splitting salad. So we didn't have any clue that we should have asked about it before putting the salad into our mouths. Besides, the server was very not attentive to us while she was attentive to every other tables she served. So we were like ""what's wrong with her?""

At the end the check came, we were charged for 2 half salads instead of 1 full portion of caesar salad. 1 full portion of caesar salad costs $9.99 but 2 half salads cost $11.98. So of course we were upset about it! The server was being unfair to us to make the call of splitting the salad without even asking us first. I feel that she should be the one paying our meal because of how she treated us (see below).

We are really upset with the server. The server always attempted to take away our food while we were still working on it. When we were working on the pizza, when there was still half a pizza left on the pizza plate, the server attempted to take away our pizza and said ""you are all done?"" We said ""no, we are still working on it. What kind of manner was that?? She could have asked if we are still working on the pizza without any action done first. She did the same when we were working on our dessert. She was so off, way too off. I was nice enough to write $2 as tips for her at the end. She really didn't deserve any tip as that's not called service. She doesn't deserve any gratuity when she was trying to rush people out of the restaurant. But I did observe and she was nice to all other people. And I really had to come down to a conclusion that she might be a racist!
We got so upset. And I was very hungry and tired that night so I didn't have the energy to think what I could have done while we were still at the restaurant. So after taking a shower that night, my mind got clear and I was able to think. Then I realized how stupid I was as I should have brought it up to the manager, and I shouldn't have given her any tip (It's not about money, it's about teaching her a lesson, if she is going to have tip with such a horrible manner, she is going to continue doing that as she thinks she's entitled). So the other morning, we went to the restaurant and spoke with the manager about how unfair it was that we were charged for 2 half salads while we didn't ask for it. And we were upset at the server rushing us. The manager felt very sorry about it so she treated us lunch afterwards. We got a lasagna and a caesar salad again for lunch.

The food is worth 4 starts honestly. The pizza, the lasagna and the salad were worth 4 stars. The dessert Strawberry Cassatta was worth 3 stars, it was not bad tasting, just not surprising either. We were just so upset with the server so she made the whole experience 2 stars. The manager was worth 4 stars as she was nice, sincere, was very reasonable and understanding us. I just feel bad for them to have a bad apple being a server, who has the potential to ruin the reputation of the restaurant so badly.

We are giving 2 stars for this review because of the bad server we had for the dinner. 

The lunch that the manager treated us actually deserved 4 stars, we also had a different server for that lunch too. We accepted the apologies and will still try Grotto again in the future when we visit vegas, especially because we really like their pizza and lasagna. We will just have to make sure that we won't have that bad server ever again in the future when visiting Grotto, and probably ask for another server if we unluckily get another bad one in the future.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,2,G05eCaSygN_c3Tny_XwgWw

101852,2010-12-25,0,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"We went here accidentally because we didn't know where to eat since we tried to go to Lillie's Asian Cuisine but it was closed for lunch and we went to go to Market Street Cafe to try their famous oxtail soup but the oxtail soup was not available until 11 pm. So we decided to go to Grotto, boy we were glad we came here. 
We ordered: 
- fried calamari comes with their yummiest tomato sauce (i never like tomato sauce but this one is so delicious i ate it clean), the calamari was dry not oily like other restaurant.. very good.
- lobster bisque ... very good. the best lobster bisque beside the one i tried at the four seasons hotel san francisco. They gave a good chunk of lobster meat.. so delicious. Just don't order it to go because i liked it so much i ordered it to go and they didn't give the lobster meat at all.. so disappointed.
- chicken alfredo linguine.. good, the white chicken meat is good but it is not grilled like what i expected, i think it was sliced roasted chicken but the overall is good because it is not greasy not too much butter and i didn't feel bloated after that.

Their bread was good, served warm and so yummy, one of the best bread but you have to ask because they won't give out the bread unless you ask for it.

The only thing that was off: the food took a while to get out, we had to wait for each of the food to get out and the restaurant was not even crowded.",_3hGfxXkeYr9n2ngqCno6w,0,0,4,d4asyI2dlWL3S06xCSG82w

Italian is not a cuisine we usually have much luck with since pretty much everything has onion. We asked the waitress, a very lovely woman I cannot remember her name, what didn't have onion to narrow down the sizeable menu. She went to the kitchen to check with the chef whom came to our table to speak with us. Not surprisingly Chef Paul (I believe was his name. Many cocktails were had that night lol) informed us essentially all dishes were made with onion and since it's in the sauces there wasn't an option to make them without. BUT if there was anything she wanted even if it was off menu to let the waitress know and he would oblige. My mom ordered a Shrimp Scampi with Linguini and she could not stop praising the flavor! She was especially grateful for the understanding.

However, we had one waitress in particular who walked over to the table twenty minutes after we were sat, and instead of saying hello, said ""I hate people from Boston.""

Service was a little spotty at first, but got better as the meal progressed. The fresh bread and seasoned olive oil was excellent. I had the Pollo Francese, which was just slightly overdone, but still good. My wife had  the Shrimp Griglia, which she liked. Just enough garlic to require a stick of gum after, but not enough to taste the next morning!

The best deal of the night was a Rigatoni Bolognese special for $10. Two of our friends ordered that dish, and they both felt they got their money's worth. 

One disappointment is the inability to order a side salad with dinner. One of our party asked, and she was directed to the main salad menu, starting at $10. Missed opportunity, folks. You likely would have sold several salads at $5, but instead we kept asking for the free bread.

After spending the day at Hoover Dam and really needing some refreshments when we returned to the hotel we decided to just stay in and eat in house.  First of course we had to spend time at the bar and quaff a few (ok, way more) cold ones, enjoy the ambiance and a nice guy bar tender named Andy.    Andy even provided some bread with olive oil dip later on (I guess there's a name for it, but all I know is it hit the spot after much beer) when we decided to make a reservation and just eat there.  After an hour or so wait (and more beer) we sashayed (ok, stumbled) into the main room to enjoy some delicious Italian food.  Excellent shrimp cocktail followed by (by me) some spaghetti with meatballs and sausage, ( I wanted old school), were served by Arturo our waiter, in a friendly and efficient manner.  We even had some GREAT cheesecake and other deserts, which on top of the beer and food made me so happy later on that the wife remembered to pack the bottle of Tums. Andy the bartender even stopped by to say hello and say he enjoyed talking to us while we were getting bombed at the bar.  A great experience all the way around.

The pizza is a thin crust cooked in a wood fire oven, and is delicious, and the beer selection is decent. The service, however, is where we have a problem.

I found our server to be inattentive, scatterbrained, and borderline rude, all in one service. I've beed served by her before, and noticed some of these attributes previously, but this time, I'd had it. My wife and I ordered a beer and a glass of wine respectively. These took what felt like an eternity to bring to us. Once we got our food at the table, she flat out ignored us, failing to check up on us once. I'm sure the manager would be unhappy to know she lost 2 more beverage sales as a result. I know we weren't a high ticket table, but that doesn't mean you can give bad service. What was more annoying is we got to overhear how personable she could be while serving the two ladies at the adjacent table. When check time came, she dropped it and vanished like a vaudevillian magician in a puff of smoke before I could hand her my Landry's Select card. When I gave it to her, she acted as if it was a huge pain, and I should have told her sooner.  How could I? She was damn near avoiding interacting with us!

Now, I know there are two sides to every story. Usually when I read complaints about servers, I am open to the possibility that there is a reason the reviewer got bad service. Perhaps they were rude to the server, smelled bad, who knows. Let me tell you, I was raised to respect what a shitty job waiting tables is. I say please, thank you, and appreciate the grind. My wife is the same way. So I can honestly say that the attitude was totally unwarranted and from left field. As a result, I left an appropriate 15% tip and bailed. I will be sure to not be seated in her section again.",tLp-SQmouWHCjdftlm_cyw,3,0,3,HUw3EId7-CP3MEY6bCwN1A

Soup was simple and perfect, not too acidic and basil played nice side kick to it. Pizza had so much flavor, I rubbed my tongue many times just to taste everything in my mouth. Very satisfying.

First the waitress forgot our drinks. Then when she did bring our drinks, or should I say drink, she forgot my wife's wine. Fine, we told here to just make sure that it was not on the bill. 
We ordered a pasta plate, and a chicken margarita pizza.
Pasta, well, to be honest, was so, so, but not bad.
The pizza, oh, the pizza........ it was absolutely the worst thing I have eaten in a long time. For me to spit out my food in a restaurant, wow, something has to be horribly wrong. Well it was. The chicken tasted like it was 2 weeks old. No joke, no exaggeration, old chicken has to be one of the worst things you can put in your mouth. Now imagine a piece of pizza you had just bitten into being covered in it!!!!
We informed the waitress, who must be an out of work actress, because she said that she could not believe what we were telling her and that she would look into it with the chef.  
So we waited for some kind of response as to what may have gone wrong, after about 15 min of waiting, the manager comes over and tells us that he cannot belive that the chicken was like that and that the chef was looking into it. Then he just walked away. No joke, no apologies, no comping the meal, nothing, he just repeated the same thing to us that the waitress had told us 15 min earlier and walked away!!!
My wife and I were going to walk out, but, unfortunately for us we have ethics. Finally we were able to get the attention of our waitress and got our bill, paid for the food we had eaten and left. 
Please don't ever eat here, I don't want you to have to find out what old chicken, and I mean really old chicken taste like, the way that we had too.
Also, to be treated so cold by the manager, and a forgetful waitress is absolutely unacceptable. In today's economy businesses need to appreciate any and all customers who walk into their establishment.

The service was stellar -- even though we happened to show up while there was also a large party being served, the staff was very attentive to us as well as the other smaller tables. The food was excellent -- warm loaves of bread with garlic and basil infused olive oil for dipping are provided to every table, and we followed it up with perfectly tender calamari. Every person at my table had excellent reviews for our entrees, and understandably with a very large party ahead of us, the food was slightly delayed coming out, but honestly I've been to places like IHOP and waited far longer. Because of that little delay though, the manager provided dessert for free. 

Which comes to the highlight of the dinner: the strawberry cassata. If you come to this restaurant you cannot leave without trying this Italian wedding cake or you're simply wasting your time. So light and fluffy and moist, I can confidently say it was the best dessert I've ever had.

There was an occasion when she called over another waiter and they both stood there while we are trying eat. Quite uncomfortable. You have to know when to leave the table. Pasta sauce was WAY TOO SWEET. When I mentioned it to the waitress she just said it has to be that way because the recipe is set by the owner in Texas. All his restaurants have to do it the same way. No apology or understanding. I was going to order a bottle of red wine, but when I saw the prices I nearly choked. There was a wine I like that I can get (1500 miles away) in my home town for $11 at the local liquor store. In this restaurant it was gonna cost me $55. No way man.

We walked around and decided to eat at the Golden Nugget because that is what we were closest to. The Golden Nugget has a 9 different restaurants inside and Grotto happens to be among them. 
My boyfriend and I were sat immediately. Our waiter was very punctual. He got our drinks quickly. He gave us enough time to look over the menu. We received fresh bread with an olive oil blend, which I loved. 
My boyfriend ordered their 4th of July drink special. It was a margarita that was red, white, and blue. It was $7.99; there was quite a bit of alcohol in it, and the price wasn't bad. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the Meatzza and I ordered the cannelloni. The cannelloni looks somewhat like a pasta burrito. They use a homemade pasta shell that's flat like a tortilla but fluffier and airier, then the pasta shell is rolled with chicken and spinach in it with bechamel (white sauce) and marinara (red sauce) on top. The Meatzza is their signature pizza that is topped with pepperoni, homemade meatballs, Italian sausage, and pancetta. It was good, but I thought my cannelloni was better. :) 
Our server was probably one of the best servers we have had. He was on top of it and his accent made us feel like we were in Italy. We just wish we could remember his name so everyone on Yelp could ask for him if given the chance to eat here.",7Q5BhwEAeKXxsNc6W85vPQ,2,0,5,QrG_aHKDlxKwzTUNMR2zgA

1441188,2012-09-29,0,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"Grotto is an excellent Italian restaurant kinda tucked away deep inside the Golden Nugget. I've passed it so many times on my way in, out, to the pool, to the check-in counter, through the casino - wherever. But I had never stopped in before during my six years of downtown tripping. 

And I seriously regret that now. 

Came in on a Thursday evening by myself, having just wrapped up a conference. Seeing no one in line, I first asked the hostess for a menu so I could spot something I liked. She happily obliged. Everything looked good to me, so I went in and sat down at the bar area, which is large and wraps all around a huge brick oven. I was pretty much the only one there, since it was so early (like around 6 pm). 

A kind gentleman came out and provided a menu and a water. I looked it over and decided I was hungry enough to do an appetizer and a whole pizza. I asked if he had a favorite appetizer. He immediately pointed to the Three Cheese Ravioli, so I ordered it. I also ordered the Herb Chicken Pizza. 

But first, let's not forget that ravioli. It was amazing. I mean really good. And really filling, too. I could have (and should have) made a meal off that dish alone. It was deep fried, covered in some outstanding spices, and the cheese inside was very tasty. I'd order two next time, eat both, then go buy some new pants.

And I just recently started asking servers for recommendations prior to ordering. And so far, I've been impressed everywhere I've done this. So I think I'll continue that trend in the future. 

Now back to the meal. The Herb Chicken Pizza was not bad, just a little runny. I think it may have needed a couple more minutes in that authentic brick oven I sat across at the bar. Oh speaking of which, if you're going to sit at the bar, that's the best place to sit. I got to witness a myriad of interesting-looking (and attractive) pizzas coming out of that thing. 

Based on the parade of pizzas, I think I'd go with the pepperoni next time. I noticed a lot of those coming out and they looked pretty good. 

Customer service here is outstanding. I'm about as low-maintenance as they come, but I noticed my server constantly looking out for me. Kept the water glass full, cleaned the dirty dishes up quickly, and so on. 

And he took it one step further when I went to pay. I had a $50 food & beverage credit from the Golden Nugget and wanted to use it when I paid. But for some reason, it didn't open up when I checked into the hotel a couple days earlier. So my server got on the phone, called two different people, and in about five minutes got it all cleared up. I think that was above and beyond. 

And so was his tip!

So I really do regret not coming here earlier but plan to make it a regular stop on all future visits.

If you like Italian, I know you'll enjoy the food and atmosphere, too.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,2,1,5,AKOMezmaLhbW9PrxasKeQg

Located in the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street in DTLV, it is an upper-scale Italian restaurant.  I got the chicken parm, which was disproportionate with the pasta to chicken ratio...you'll be able to see in the attached picture.  There is legit one scoop of pasta and a chicken the size of my head.  It was still v good despite this.  Also got the calamari and lobster bisque for appetizers, also tasty. 

But now for the airing of grievances: 

I had to probably wait 20 minutes after the rest of my party's food came with no apology from the wait staff for my meal. The service all around sucked, if I'm being frank. Our water glasses were always empty.  The waitress forgot to bring out the lobster bisque soup, so we got it after dinner was served - isn't soup the appetizer (???!!!)  Took forever for our cocktails and not once did they check up on us.  It was a Friday night, so I would give them the benefit of the doubt if it was busy, but it wasn't...we were a party of 6 and ordered over $300 worth of food and beverages and got the worst service ever.

Our order was correct and delivered correctly to each party member. We had the Calamari appetizer which was tender, lightly breaded and lightly crispy. Not only delicious but plenty for our table. Lobster bisque and Tomato bisque very, very good. Ceasar salads were both completely consumed. Our table made a custom entree request for Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, not on the menu. This was received by the staff as ""Of course! No problem!"" and the dish was reported to be very tasty. Also ordered was the Mahi, Piscatore and Spaghetti and Meatballs.

Still wanting Italian, we took a quick walk down to The Golden Nugget and quickly got a seat at the bar at Grotto. The atmosphere was pretty cool at the bar since you got to watch them make their pizzas. I had the seared mozzarella appetizer which was delicious (especially the tomato sauce it was in.) The veal scaloppini in the main dish was very good as well. The highlight of the meal was the strawberry dessert. This was about two weeks ago and I can't remember the name of the dessert, but just get it. It was delicious. I tried to replicate it as soon as I got home and it wasn't close. Ask your server, they will know what it is. It's almost cake, cream, strawberries, and magic I think. The only complaint was that the service was a little slow.

They had found it online and were very much looking forward to eating at a restaurant with an aquarium.  Upon arrival, they were so disappointed to find that the restaurant had just a distant view of a very small aquarium in the pool area.  It was nothing like they had expected.  For our meal, we ordered 2 Grotto salads to start (very basic chopped lettuce & tomatoes with a vinaigrette), a margherita pizza (just ok), a bowl of soup (very bland), a chopped salad with chicken & the half rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes & sauteed spinach (the chicken was very dry and I only ended up eating a few bites of it).

The restaurant is right next to the beautiful pool and the awesome shark tank & water slide.  We were lucky enough to sit by the window and it felt like we were sitting on a patio on a perfect sunny day (which it was, but we were inside).

I decided on the Italian chopped salad and was very happy.  The salad was great and I couldn't believe I ate the entire mound of chopped delicious ingredients.  I did get the dressing on the side, so I'm not sure how much they would usually put on the salad. 

We brought the boys back for the end of happy hour so we could check out the pizzas on special for $6 (happy hour is from 2-6). They were a great size for the price, thin crackery crust, and delicious toppings.  The drink prices were not great on happy hour, but I've learned that is pretty consistent for The Golden Nugget.  Then again, it would make sense seeing as how it is a step up from the rest of the hotels on Fremont. 

The server for lunch was very nice, however the bartenders for happy hour seemed a little less than happy. I know it can get crazy in a small bar area with everyone wanting to order, but when your working for tips a small smile every now an again won't hurt. I promise your face won't crack!

She answered all my questions - and was very clear about how much things would cost. We reserved an area of the restaurant that is near the pool that is their Atrium. Although we had to ""buy out"" the space - it was worth the money. 

On the day of the dinner, the service was amazing! We had a pretty large party consisting of 40 people - the waiters were on top of refills and getting the food to everyone at the same time. My guests also really loved the food (I did too)!

We paid extra to have a wedding cake and did it through the Golden Nugget's bakery. It was so delicious! We ordered the carrot cake and honestly it is one of the best carrot cakes I have ever tried. 

The Sales Manager Jennifer was amazing! She even offered to meet me in person the day before so that if I had any more questions I could ask her in person and so that my husband and I can see what the Atrium looked like the day before. 

As a side note - they also allowed us to bring out own centerpieces so it could feel more like a real wedding reception! 

I really appreciated how accommodating the Grotto was to my needs for my special day! I highly recommend this place for a wedding dinner or large party because of the amazing service and delicious food.",eFobGYtDhl125eyMMsKvTQ,2,0,5,5r01kb7r0TjZkG7WwXtINA

2444446,2014-03-18,1,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"Even though I spent 5 nights at the Golden Nugget during my recent vacation to Vegas, I didn't get around to trying Grotto until my last day there. And in retrospect, that's a shame, because Grotto was definitely the best restaurant I tried at the Golden Nugget. Grotto has a bit of a Olive Garden feel to it, but with slightly better food. And since I am a fan of Olive Garden, consider that a compliment.

But unlike Olive Garden, they do cater to the Vegas casino crowd by being open early for breakfast. This was first meal of the day at Grotto ... stumbling back into the Golden Nugget after a marathon session of brews and Sigma Derby at The D. Looking for something sweet and decadent, I ordered the cheese blintzes. I received four delicious, ample-sized blintzes with a side of fruit compote. I was happy and headed to my room for three hours of sleep before checkout.

My flight out of town wasn't until late that night, so after check out, I hung around Golden Nugget. After getting some additional rest and nursing my hangover poolside, I decided I needed some carby comfort food. So I went for round two at Grotto and settled on their Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. It came with an ample portion of salad and bread - both good. The menu advertised homemade fettuccine, and the noodles were pretty darn good. The chicken was cooked nicely and tasty. The Alfredo sauce was a bit on the thin side for my taste, and could use a bit more cheese flavor, but it was still enjoyable. At $15, this was a pretty good deal for lunch from a casino.

The dining at Golden Nugget tends to shade towards pricy and upscale - what else would you expect from the parent company of Morton's? And the dining at DTLV tends to be either high-end or divey. Grotto is one of the few ""in-between"" options - they offer a reasonably-priced sit-down meal that is both tasty and a good value for your food dollar.. If you are looking something between the spectrum of fine dining and Fried Twinkies, Grotto is worth a try.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,2,1,4,B6sQfgJQ9gNHrAQCA0pNwg

Went here for a 'romantic' dinner during happy hour on a Tuesday. The bar tender was the best server we had on the whole trip. He recommended we sit in the bar to take advantage of half price pizzas and $2 off drinks! Thanks, man! It was a completely affordable delicious meal. Their pizzas are wood fired with top shelf ingredients. We also ordered the meatballs, which were garlicky and good, plus the ravioli alla vodka, which tasted fresh and well balanced. Overall, the service put it over the top and we were very happy we happened into the Grotto. 

When our party of 11 decided to go downtown for Christmas Day, my boyfriend and I suggested Grotto to the family for Christmas dinner. We were glad we did! Everyone was impressed! The service was amazing, again and the food was well prepared. Everything was on point. The appetizers were priced at $8-$15. Bruschetta was excellent. Fried ravioli was a touch overdone. My favorite dish I tried was the chicken francais. I ordered the chicken marsala accompanied by fresh fettuccine Alfredo, which was good, but not the best I've had. The ciabatta bread was soft and hot and the dipping oil was really well flavored. Desserts looked amazing, but I was stuffed. The favorite of the table was a ricotta cream and strawberry bombe, which was beautiful.

Water was not refilled for the entire meal. Four water glasses sat empty for literally an hour. Other empty glasses from wine and soft drinks were never picked up. Not even after the bill arrived. The empties just sat there.

Our server was loud and sorta cocky. Which actually can be an asset in some cases. But this guy couldn't pull it off...and, based on our experience with him, he had no justifiable reason to be so self-confident in his style.

Food, though slow to arrive, was pretty good on the whole.

Half of the table enjoyed salads and they were quite flavorful, particularly the mixed greens with beets, pears, and pomegranate dressing. Very nice.

The cannelloni was out of this world good. The portion was only two noodles. I could've eaten a thousand. Fantastic!

The least successful entree at the table was a pizza, which had a droopy, limp crust, sparse toppings and little cheese. If  you go--and that should be a BIG ""if"" in my estimation--take a pass on the menu's pizza section.

After such good food, I was ready to forgive the lackluster service. But that's when Mr. Cocky Server came back and took our final drink orders: a couple of wines, a coffee, and a refill of Coke.

We were quite surprised how busy the whole place was for a Sunday night,  Good for the hotels bottom line, but it was just too busy and a bit too noisy for our liking.

We were seated fairly quickly, (we'd made a reservation) and the hostess was pleasant and provided good service.

It took a bit of a wait for our waitress Carol to get around to us, but when she did, she provided good, friendly and courteous professional service.

The only negative we experienced is that my wife found her dish the Mahi, to be a bit off putting since we hadn't paid attention to the description on the menu.  We called over Neil the manager on duty and he explained the fish was wrapped in angel hair pasta.  (Who ever thought up that idea in our view has a screw loose!  It made the fish yucky to look at and taste). Neil kindly offered to make up a new order without the pasta and it came back perfect.  Much nicer to have a nice piece of fish cooked simply with sauce rather than some sort of pasta concoction wrapping it.  With the pasta it covered the quality of the fish, without it the fish was quite nice and very well done.

Neil, also offered us a comped dessert which we took him up on after we spent some time in the casino.  The tiramisu was yummy and Neil came by and greeted us again, which was quite nice.

Overall, I'd rate our whole experience a B+ on a grading scale.  Quite pleasant, with some minor room for improvements.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,0,0,4,u0f_yrrRdm-oLOuMGrT9uw

The service was fabulous although we only had one waitress and she handled it well.  

PROS:  The chopped salad was great and there was a huge plate of it, enough for 6 of us to share.

The Spaghetti Bolognese was good but just good, not great, not memorable. At $19.00 per plate it SHOULD have been better. 

The Chicken Piccata was also a good choice with lots of lemon and loaded with capers and served with a generous helping of angel hair pasta and asparagus.

A few in our party ordered the cannaloni appetizer ($9.00 each) and loved it.   

CONS:  The thin crust pizza fell apart under the weight of the large amount of cheese, sausage and peppers.  The crust tasted more like crackers than pizza dough.  The flavor of the pizza topping was very good, but hard to handle.

We shared all of these  dishes among 6 of the 14 so we ordered 4 extra meatballs along with the two that came with the Spaghetti Bolognese.  The meatballs were huge but we felt that $4.00 for each meatball was a little over the top. 
 
The dessert cart is very interesting to look at but the coconut cream pie (a huge slice) was almost all whipped cream.  I would have liked a little more coconut cream.   At $8.00 per slice it was hard to swallow.  LOL.

The restaurant itself is loaded with Italian atmosphere and very comfortable but noisy.  Some tables face the awesome aquarium at poolside so try to ask for a table there. 

Probably won't go back there again and that's too bad since we're locals and frequent the restaurants on the Strip and Fremont Street.",TGYVnlAY0R8WX4IagRiuRw,0,0,3,PiloEFgaXvh_WzninlqtVw

They were so good we ordered them again.  The cocktails during happy hour were far better than we thought they would be for a happy hour.  Grotto's didn't use cheap, nasty tasting well liquor for their drinks.  We sat there for several  hours enjoying the mussels, drinks and each other.  The wait staff was prompt, anticipated our needs and was very friendly.  We will definitely go there again.

The 4 stars was because of the smoke coming up from the slot banks where there were many people playing where it seemed everyone smoked.  If it were not for that, I would  easily give a 5 star.  Just note there are tables not next to slots banks...get one of those $8 pizzas a meal in and of itself.  Everything we saw on other tables looked fantastic.

Came here with a group of my co-workers to celebrate the MARCH BIRTHDAYS. 

The resteraunt is located right next to the hotel pool & they have an awsome view of the shark tank too. The decor make me think of how an italian resteraunt looked like back in the days. There were also cool looking blown glass chandeliers. The lighting was dim & the place was packed.

We had a party of 5 & the host seated us quickly followed by our server to greet us. I wish I remembered his name because he is what made this review a 5 star. He was very professional & informed us about the specials for the night. 

We started off with some cocktails that came out quickly & he gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.
We were given hot fluffy bread at the beginning and with some garlic infused olive oil.

TOMATO CAPRESE $12.99 - we ordered 2 and they split it up for us and also added one more mozzarella-tomato-basil & so each dish got 2 pieces which was nice but we couldn't even eat more than one because they were so big. 

LOBSTER BISQUE $9.99 - it was nice & delicious but definately cannot have one serving to myself

SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP $9.99 - can't really go wrong with this appetizer 

PENNE CON GAMBERI AL LIMONE $20.99 - this was the dish I ordered & I have to say that it was just okay. The pasta it self could have used more flavoring because it was a bit bland... the shrimps had a lot of flavor though.

PROSCIUTTO-WRAPPED CHILEAN SEABASS $29.99 - it was delicious... presentation was a little plain but it was gonna be eaten regardless. The seabass was cooked to a perfect medium temperature.

CIOPPINO $35.99 - this was a flavor packed dish. Lots of different seafood from clams to crab claws with the flavorful broth it comes in.

ITALIAN CHOPPED $17.99 - the dressing was tossed in & there was a bite of every ingredient of tomato.onion.feta.kalamata olives. Grilled chicken. The chicken was also juicy & not dried out.

CHICKEN PICATTA $19.99 - didn't get to try this one ahhahaha

COCONUT CREAM PIE $7.99 - OMG it was just filled with cream but there was just enough toasted coconuts on the outside to give a little texture & flavor along with the pie crust.

TIRAMISU $7.99 - you could taste a little bit of the alcohol which was great & it literally melted away the moment it touched your toungue which is exactly what I look for in a tiramisu! The decor presentation was cute too.

CREME BRULEE $7.99 - simple but the least of my favorites out of all the desserts but only because it just tasted like a really good normal creme brulee. The sugar crust on top was perfect & the creme inside was creamy soft perfection.

STRAWBERRY CASSATTA $7.99 - my first experience & the light angel cake on the inside was amazing with the cream & fresh strawberries with strawberry sauce... DROOL

CAPACCINO $4.50
BOTTLE OF ARGYLE PINOT NOIR $65

The fact that he lit up a candle for every single one of the desserts was a very awsome touch to the whole dinner. One sad thing was that they didn't offer anything little for dessert which would have just been a nice touch. 

ALL-IN-ALL service was great... ambience & decor was wonderful & fun... food was delcious... didn't really realize timing for everything because we came to dine & enjoy ourselves so you don't realize the timing on anything.

We ordered a bottle of Querceto.  The first bottle was corked and our server agreed.  We got a new bottle and this one was corked as well.

At this time the GM came over and presented a ""special bottle"" he had.  It was Match Chardonnay.  You could just tell by looking at the bottle it was nothing special.  

The dinner was OK.  Food was nothing special but our server was definitely trying.

We then got the check and the manager said he would just ""price match"" the Chardonnay to the $44 bottle of Querceto.  I thought this sounded suspicious as I didn't think the Match bottle was $44.  We then asked for a menu and sure enough ""Match Chardonnay"" isn't on their menu.  The GM then came over and said he would do their ""house Chardonnay"" price and on the new receipt it said ""Match Chardonnay"".

I work in F&B.  I know how menu items and button requests work.  The Match Chardonnay on the receipt said $33.  The unethical GM was trying to nickel and dime us when we had 2 bad bottles of wine.  Is this real life?  

We are foodies and have met several other foodies out and about and have shared our story at any chance we get.  As a general manager or ethical human being your job is to wow the guest and to turn around negative experiences - not to rip the guest off hoping they wouldn't catch what you're trying to do.

This same bottle of wine is offered at Pizza Rock at GVR for $36 or so and they have half off wine night and their wine isn't corked.

3293463,2011-08-23,0,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"During one of my last work trips in Las Vegas, I found myself stationed here at the Golden Nugget and feening for some food after an incredibly intense happy hour.  I learned of the Grotto by accident really - I was busy sipping glasses of wine and attempting to order bar food, only to learn that bar food was a delicious array of Italian fare.

Perhaps it was the alcohol doing the talking for me, because everything I had was inhaled in minutes.  The Montel Wrap, a parmesan crusted Chilean sea bass married with roma tomatoes and lettuce was better drunk food than the burger and fries I was initially fantasizing about.  Another winner was the lasagna and the margherita pizza was deceivingly tasty.  I managed to go back to my hotel room in a pseudo drunken food coma, a condition best experienced in Vegas.

I decided to come back during another night for dinner, this time sober and just as hungry.  Having witnessed the dining room for the first time, I realized it was easy to miss this place.  The Grotto doesn't stand out and the tacky decor wasn't going to win any awards either.  When examining a menu for a second time, it was clear Grotto's was a Italiana Americana restaurant, more than it was anything more authentic.

Service was good, almost too good for a downtown casino establishment.  They were courteous, professional, and prompt with everything.  I had a stellar recommendation in the very tasty ($9) lobster bisque, not too fishy and just a tad of creme.  Another solid dish was the linguine pescatore, but felt overpriced at $27 for a medium portion.  I also was able to try their herb crusted pork loin ($25), juicy and hearty, with a nice seared crust, had a nice flavor with it.  The yukon mashed potatoes were a nice touch but tasted like they were whipped with butter and sour cream.

Finally our table of hungry hippos decided it would be a good idea to order the sausage and peppers pizza.  The crust was a little charred, too much to a point where it was dry and mediocre.  I would give this another shot, especially since I've heard more former colleagues rave about this pizza than any other entree on their menu.

The Golden Nugget has a mini gem here with Grotto.  For downtown standards, this is a decent and semi-reasonably priced Italian option in an area where good food is hard to find.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,2,3,4,5g48F9hwvo86qxMkisjK1w

The wedding soup is absolutely my favorite and has chicken meatballs instead of beef, perfectly seasoned and easy to slice with your spoon. Light broth, super flavor, soooo Yummy!

I don't eat beef/pork/veal, so my menu choices are limited by my own preferences, so I haven't found an entree that I love yet. The lemon is a bit heavy in their lemon/butter sauce, but the rosa sauce is tasty.

The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the two meatballs on it were huge and very tasty and tender.  Perfectly done.

I'm spoiled sure. I eat well in Chicago, San Francisco, Miami, NY... and this barely compares with a decent Italian chain restaurant. Honestly, Carrabas is better. 

The price of this joint was ridic. I spent $44 bucks on some bland and mushy mussels, a plate of soggy calamari and a meh salad. I realize seafood might not have been the hot ticket, so I tried my friends dishes. More blah. Where did the flavor go? Ive been to some amazing Italian places, at prices from $ to $$$$. Price doesn't usually indicate quality, but here at this price I expected a lot more. Hell if it was half what I paid I would've been sorely disappointed.

Case in point, we ate at Brio in a mall on the south end of the strip before we flew out. Again it was a meal of seafood appetizers and salad. WITH a bottle of wine it was only $60 bones, and it was phenomenal! and a chain! Seriously, WTF.

I ate here last Wed, 26 Feb 14, for a late lunch & the food was superb, but my waitress was very inattentive to refilling my water glass & very offish towards me.  Then a male waiter took over for her but he didn't bother to ask me if I wanted water either & my glass was almost empty.  He also took a long time to bring my check.

I give 3 stars for the food & 1 for the service.  The restaurant was hardly busy since it was 2pm & the normal 11am-1pm lunch crowd was gone.  So I don't know why the wait for my food was so long & my water glass was never refilled.  I left too nice of a tip for the service I received.

Maybe another time the service will live up to the food!",eT6mHUQ9rmBjj73PgdgUfw,13,7,3,E7V5wZYPJ1PD3mQpnZTUPQ

First of all, our waitress was wonderful.  She helped us choose entrees, and suggested that we split a salad.  Hubby had a sea bass encrusted with a pasta-type coating.  He thought it was terrific.  I had a veal marsala, which was very good.  Our side dishes were also very well done.  

The desserts were the best!  When you're done eating, they wheel out a dessert cart.  Naturally, everything makes your mouth water.  We shared a cake layered with cream and strawberries.  Light and decadent!  

The atmosphere was okay -- we got to look out into the pool and fish tank area.  My only complaint would be the noise.  Like most restaurants in Vegas, the restaurant is open to a corridor with people constantly walking through.

We had a reservation for a party of 14, and they were able to accommodate us, our server Denise was chatty and friendly, she asked where we were all from, it was an even split between California and Arizona. She even remembered most of our names, and she told us she was 63, man she didn't look it at all! Life has been kind to her.

After glancing over the menu 1st thing that caught my eye, damn this place is pricy, for a bowl of spaghetti and sauce was 20 bucks, that stuff better be amazing!  Also on the table they brought out fresh sourdough bread and oil with spicy herbs, that was pretty tasty too, the bread was delish!

So after the sticker shock, I went with the Pollo Romano and small Caesar salda (additional 4.99 charge). The Caesar salad had crisp romaine lettuce, garlic croutons, a great tasting Caesar dressing and was blanketed in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It was a great tasting salad,

The Pollo Romano, on the menu had great potential, it Romano-crusted chicken scaloppini with artichokes & Roma tomatoes in a white wine sauce served with penne sugo rosa for $19.99, I guess I should have really pay attention to the scaloppini part of the chicken, man my chicken was small, almost to the point of not being there, it was 2   pieces about the size of a half dollar and as thin as a sheet of paper, super small, piled on top a heaping mound of spinach with 1 artichoke heart cut in half propped to make the chicken appear bigger and to the side of this was a huge mound of pasta with minimal sauce, so very disappointed in my dinner, did it taste good, yea the 2 bites of chicken was great in flavor, the white wine sauce was thin and sparse, the mound of spinach felt like it was never ending, and the pasta was cooked all the way but was very dry. I do not feel this meal was worth the price. Everyone was under wowed by their meal, but had a great time enjoying everyone's company.

Guests were able to choose from 2 salads, 3 entrees and 2 desserts - all of which were very tasty!  Upon first visiting Grotto, I was a little considered about privacy because they don't have a private dining room.  Our party was set up against the back wall of the restaurant and luckily it still felt like our own special event.

I'm so happy I went with this restaurant!  I basically planned my wedding using yelp reviews and if there's anyone needing a lovely setting for a large party, nice dinner out or decent happy hour, I strongly advise considering Grotto!",IfIqS0jRNVEWU2wXbiIVaw,1,0,5,HtXLaeg7wz1iOX2tb78YSQ

I am quite the snob when it comes to Italian food, but this place is a gem.
After walking around Fremont street for an hour looking for a place to eat, we stumbled upon this place and the exquisite aroma of the food is what drew us in. For a party of 5 on a Saturday night with no reservation we we're sat right away. 
What impresses me in any restaurant is a server who is passionate about what they serve and ours was just that. She was knowledgable about the wine and food pairings and recommended great dishes.

There are two sections of seating and one is ""inside"" the restaurant while there is an outer area that hugs the huge glass walls, where you can look into the pool and aquarium / slide! It was really nice to zone out and have a nice view.

We ordered a salad (big enough to share between 2 or even 3), bruschetta, mushroom caps, and almost couldn't eat it all as we scarfed down the warm bread that came to our table shortly before. 

Everything we ordered was to our liking and even with one member of our dining party being extremely rude and cranky (sorry!!) the wait staff was ever so gracious and patient.

First our iced tea orders were taken and we were brought some slices of standard Italian bread with a container of olive oil for dipping. 

I ordered the special of the day, a risotto with lump crab.  My wife ordered the Pollo Romano, a chicken breast--""Romano crusted chicken scaloppine"" and served with penne in a sugo rosa.  My wife's chicken was very good but there was more of a breading taste than romano to the chicken.  The penne was very bland.  A little salt helped that along.  My risotto was good and there was a fair amount of crab meat.

We shared a slice of mezza notte chocolate cake.  It's very rich and very good.  Lots of chocolate drizzled with chocolate.

Service was good.  Iced tea was refilled and the server took my Landry's card early and linked it to our order.  

While you can sit along the windows by the pool, I didn't push for that.  The one table remaining along the window had a large man with a tattooed back almost pressed against the window.  Needless to say, that wasn't a view of the pool I wanted to have.

None of us had starters but a basket of bread was brought to the table along with some olive oil. NOTHING special about the bread-it could have came from Smith's or Albertson's... 

I had the Cannelloni (17.99) which was stuffed with chicken and spinach, with béchamel and marinara sauce. The plate was served with 2 cannellonis which were delicious. My husband had the Filet alla Griglia (34.99), a center-cut filet with Italian roasted potatoes and asparagus topped witha rich Borolo demi-glace. He enjoyed every bite & said the asparagus was cooked perfectly!. One friend had the Fettuccine alla Campagnola(17.99) which had chicken, mushrooms, peas, mozzarella in a sugo rosa sauce.

Our other friend had the Rigatoni della Sansoni (18.99) which had a meat sauce and is normally topped with homemade meatballs but our friend asked if italian sausage could be substituted instead , which they did with no hesitation or extra charge.

Service: 2/5 Our waitress tried her best, but didn't keep the drinks and water filled on a very hot day.  For lunch they sat us across in a dining area across the walkway of the main dining room which was very warm because of the glass walls right by the pool.  The food came out timely but we had to find her on numerous occasions for drinks and to eventually close out the bill.

Food: 3/5 The calamari portion was large and very good,  Tasty and cooked perfectly.  My rigatoni was very good.  The sauce and the pasta were great and complimented each other well.  My friend ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo and she added shrimp to the dish.  The shrimp and the chicken were fine but the sauce and the pasta were average at best.  The sauce didn't have enough cheese and the pasta seemed liked something you could buy at the grocery store and unfortunately didn't meet our expectations.  The Cheesecake topped with strawberry sauce was excellent.  Big slice and was the perfect amount of creaminess for a cheesecake.

Value: 3/5 The lunch chicken fettuccine alfredo was $16 and adding shrimp was an additional $9.95.  If the sauce and pasta were better, I might be ok with this as they gave good portions of shrimp and chicken.  The Rigatoni at $18 was fine but I've had better for similar pricing.  With so many great Italian food options in Las Vegas, they're falling a little short in terms of what you pay for vs what you receive.  Tito's and Tonics were $10.50 a drink here.

Ambiance: 3/5 The Main dining room looked nice, but they sat all but two parties in the area across the way by the pool.  I'm sure it's a different ambiance in the dining room at night but I'm rating on sitting in the hotter area by the glass walls overlooking the pool.

Summary: I feel like this is one of those restaurants where their best performance comes out in the evening.  If I'm in the area for an evening and I'm feeling Italian food, I'm willing to see how the dinner experience is as compared to their average mid-afternoon lunch.

   They start you with bread and dipping oil. The bread was house made and had an amazing garlic aroma and flavor, perfectly warm and soft inside and that nice crisp crunch on the outside. The garlic oil complimented this wonderfully.
   My husband ordered a chicken Alfredo dish that was out of this world. The flavor and consistency of the sauce was spot on and the pasta and chicken were cooked perfectly. The dish was beautifully presented.
   I ordered a sausage marinara dish, which again flavor, presentation and food were spot on. By far the best Italian food we've had.  
   For desert I ordered the tiramisu and my husband ordered the cheesecake. Both were very good and had we not ordered the cheesecake we would have raved about the tiramisu, but we DID order the cheesecake and well we needed up being the tiramisu home and took our time delighting in this AHmazing cheesecake. The consistency was perfect and the best creamy texture and taste. We're big cheesecake fans and my husband is a cheesecake ""snob"" and we were both blown away with this one!
   The service was equally as great from hostess, waiter and the gal who kept filling up our waters. Smiling pleasant and went out of their way to make out night special! Well done grotto!",E7hFd3AHAdEZFK5FTcCroQ,1,0,5,tJ03VM0Uf8vKKNVLhv8hhg

The wife and I split a Caesar salad , one othe best I've had and the wife.agreed. Then we had the calamari app very good served with a red gravy ( marinara ) We then had a wood oven pizza that was delicious but this is we're the the only negative I have to report on. We order a proscutto pine nut and artichoke and got a  chicken goat cheese. You think You would notice right away but the red onion and shredded chicken impersonated proscutto and artichoke at first take.

Long story short the waitress knew it was the wrong pizza and asked if we wanted another pizza . We said no that this was fine. We thought  they would have comped the pizza on our bill which they did when we told the waitress she should do something abouther mistake. I know she asked us if we wanted another pizza and we said that this was fine . We were simply being accommodating and didnt want to wait for another pizza to cook . 

So caesar salad $ 9.99 , calamari $11.99 wrong pizza $17.99 total bill $ 99.59 oh yes there was four alcoholic beverages  involved. Why has Vegas decided that a martini should cost $15.00 bucks. I guess because we the insipid consumer will pay for it. I'm just saying we are collectively the problem with over priced booze concert tickets sporting events etc...

Summary, the food is delicious the service was good  and the booze over priced. They have happy hour mon- fri 4 to 7 with half priced pizza and $4 beers . Good time to go..",vUA28ls7bhklCAqWFT4cwg,2,0,4,rgsKBjXJbiXPaRHc3mY2hw
4297492,2017-02-28,1,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"Where do I begin? First and foremost, it was my wife's birthday so I had high expectations for dinner. I couldn't have been more disappointed in literally EVERY dish. We started with a couple appetizers (calamari and meatballs). Awful. Both dishes were obviously frozen prior and were served room temp. The calamari had a mushy breading and the squid itself was rubbery. All dishes were seemingly ordered from Cisco or Costco. The meatballs were  tragic. The sauce tasted canned and was very sweet. The meatball itself was flavorless and unseasoned. 

For our main courses, my wife ordered her favorite cut of steak, filet mignon medium rare. It arrived totally raw in the center and in fact was cold on the exterior indicating it was also, tragically, frozen. I ordered a 4oz New York steak ordered medium well and it arrived on a scalding plate but was cold in the center. Unfortunately, the heat lamp the dish sat under for some time wasn't able to heat the meat through!

In addition, we ordered a ravioli dish that was quite simply, another Costco purchase. Rubbery, flavorless and served with a dated presentation style. Peas as a garnish, no need to go further on that point. 

All in all, the service was not memorable but not bad. The staff clearly had no integrity in their craft which I found just plain sad.
We paid for dinner and didn't want to cause a scene complaining to staff. They were kind enough to take the appetizers and steak off our bill seeing that we didn't eat them. 

It was a total disappointment that took several after dinner cocktails to forget about the experience.

Everything from the water to the desserts was fantastic.  The water comes with a plate of lemon wedges and mint leaves.  How great is that?  I know its just water, but it really made it taste great.

I had a creamy pasta with regular and spinach noodles, prosciutto, peas, and lots of parmesan.  My sig other had meatballs with marinara and a caesar salad.  Those meatballs were somethin' else.  Crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside.  A great meal.

The best part of all was the desserts.  They brought out a tower on wheels that puts the term dessert cart to sham.  An unbelievable good looking chocolate cake, Italian wedding cake, four flavors of gelato, tiramisu,  spectacular strawberry cheesecake, and a few others.  I went with the pistachio gelato and I'm glad I did.  It was so delicious and a perfect pick for this gelato lover.  They even make it right there in the restaurant.

The Grotto is a decent, physically darker version of Olive Garden-type resto partially open to the casino floor.  The waitstaff was friendly and swift, but they did seem rushed as there always seemed to be a wait to get a table.  
The bread served before the meal is soft and doughy; comes with a chili-garlic olive oil for dipping.
The bruschetta was awesome - long buttery, crusty oblongs of bread lightly drizzled with balsamic, topped with a fresh garlicky tomato tapenade. The bf and I gobbled that shit up quick.
I ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce, very good with that comforting feel, and the bf had the chicken canneloni which he apparently loved (none left) and I thought was ok (one bite).

The Grotto is located inside of the Golden Nugget and is a little hidden. You have to actually go through the whole casino and walk towards the pool with the sharks in the large tank.

Service is wonderful, the food was alright and prices are a little higher then you would get a say Olive Garden and such. I was with a largish group, but that was no problem for them as they were able to get some tables together quickly. Joan, our waiter, was very attentive and could answer any question you could have about the menu including her awesome suggestion of the waffle fries for the kids in our group.

I ordered the homemade roasted chicken ravioli which came with soft polenta, mascarpone, roasted red pepper cream & herbed velouté. What half of that means? I have no clue, but it was not too shabby. Before my meal was brought out we were served some warm bread with oil. It was bread, it was good, no complaints there. As far as the raviolis... I was expecting multiple small ravioli's, but it is really just one big ravioli. The flavors went well together and created a nice warm meal on a cold Vegas day.

Location is nicely tucked next to the casino without the distraction, and next to the beautiful new pool and fish/shark tank area, and we lucked out by getting a table with a tank view.

Another plus were that they were very accommodating to my kids. You don't often get a kids menu and crayons at a place like this, and my five-year-old could stop watching the sharks. 

I had been told the veal dishes here were the highlight, and my veal dish didn't disappoint. Nice sauce, just the right tenderness and tasty. But it didn't quite taste like a $28 dish to me.

Decent wine selection, and the apricot iced tea needed no Splenda.

Desert (chocolate cake) we all share was good, though nothing special. Had about as good at several of the local cheap buffets.

Overall, might have been closer to three 1/2 stars if the option was available. Food was very good, but not worthy of a five-diamond mention and you lose a star for being overpriced.

The good:  This is one of those places that has been a ""must"" whenever we go to Las Vegas!  I absolutely love the spinach salad.  Since I am a creature of habit, once I find something I love I kinda get it again and again.  I've had the spinach salad consistently for years.  Yep, i love it that much!  The pasta dishes are excellent and the pizzas are delicious too!  Never made it to dessert so one day I'll have to try some.

What you might not know:  This place is part of the Landry's Select club and you can accumulate your visits to earn those $25 rewards.  Also in the Golden Nugget is the another Landry's restaurant, a steakhouse, Vic and Anthony's.  Delicious!

The review on most recent visit:  I would've given this restaurant five stars except for my most recent visit...

Let me start by saying that the wait staff is usually excellent, attentive and professional.  However, on our last visit in July, our salad was delivered to the wrong table by a man who appeared to be a waiter and we had to wait a while to have one remade and brought to our table.  Mind you, we were there at least fifteen minutes before the other couple.  Let's just say, we watched as the other couple enjoyed our salads and continued to wait.  Finally, our salads came... No apology from our waitress except oh, it was delivered to the wrong table and that was the second time he did it to her that night, fourth time overall.... Hmmm...ok, so she was having trouble with another employee...she acted like she was irritated by him and the victim of the situation.  The only ones who got any benefit that night was the couple who had our salad for free. Can't blame the other couple though, it was their first time there and they thought the salad came with their meal.  I think for our inconvenience, we should've been comped a salad too, or  at least been given dessert after our pastas for our inconvenience and having to be put between what seemed to be some sort of problem between two employees.  

I'm just glad that this wasn't my first time there or I would be missing out on some really good food, cause I would not go back.  This type of experience would be the type of incident that would keep first timers from returning.

If this type of incident was to keep occurring, I would seriously think about making it a ""must"" on future visits to Las Vegas.  Vacations are supposed to be fun and relaxing, not irritating and an inconvience where you're sitting around and waiting for your starter for over half an hour. 

So, minus one star for waiter/waitress discrepancy and another half cause lots of time was wasted and were not given an apology, but an irritated excuse.  Any other restaurant where something like this happens, patrons are valued and given something comped or at least an apology instead of excuse.

We were done well after the restaurant closed, and should've made an attempt to speak to a manager, but hey we were on vacation and so much precious time had already been wasted.",ZBrX2pk4s-0gKr20hLzISA,0,0,3,OPeu-PHbeHrwifD0dr0kag

I felt pretty damn classy drinking soup as I watched sharks swim around in the tank. The only qualm I have are the servings--or lack thereof. My friend ordered pasta (forgot which kind, it was greenish though) and her dish was considerably pricier than mine and the amount of pasta she got was laughable. Like I literally laughed when it was brought over because it was more appropriate for it to be served to an elf.

Now, mind you, my 4-star rating does not mean this is a 4-star restaurant, similar to the ones on the Strip. 

For the price, they give you a good amount of portions - definitely not trying to gyp you.  We shared the antipasto, stuffed mushrooms and the calamaris as appetizers.  All three were really good for what it's worth. 

I had the seafood pasta, which was very delicious.  I tried a couple slices of the pepperoni pizza, and I thought that was worth mentioning as well.  

I originally ordered the Aqua di Mare cocktail.  It was in the color of Windex, and it tasted like Windex to me (no offense).  I asked our server if I could change it, and he was very nice and was happy to change it for me.  They took the cocktail off the bill, and I was happy to make up in tips for that.  

I cannot give Grotto 5 stars because it was more on the lax-side as far as the clientele.

So it's all the more impressive to discover it offers many common dishes uncommonly well done. 

We got off to a good start with soft Italian bread with garlicked olive oil...Calimari Toto promises that you're getting all the octopus--authentically Italian--fresh but flavorful pieces of the tentacles and head, in a light egg batter that makes it hard to stop eating... meatballs come two near-baseballs to an order, a thin crust protecting the piping hot, almost pate-soft inside (which they claim is all flavorful beef chuck, though you'll suspect more tender veal). The Italian Chopped salad balances proscuitto, bacon, egg, with Gorgonzola and provolone cheeses with iceberg lettuce so deftly that the thin-sliced grilled chicken breast on top seems unncessary. 

Chicken and seafood are clearly the strengths here (though they also make their own fresh pastas)...particularly the Roasted Herb chicken, a half-bird rotisseried with rosemary over white oak and nothing less than tender, savory perfection. 

But the pizzas deserve equal attention, especially considering how few and far between are good pies found in the city. Grotto's hand-tossed rustic rounds, cooked in a wood burning stove in the middle of the dining room, taste just like you'd expect from a street café in Napoli...but maybe a bit better. Our margherita, hitting the table in a cloud of aroma, didn't have a chance of survival. 

The garlicky sweet marinara sauce that accompanies many dishes is the kind of recipe you could easily crave, fresh, simple yet deceptively complete. 

A small wine list offers a baker's dozen reds and ten whites by the glass, including their own robust chianti-esque Rock N Roll blend, totally acceptable.

Beware that huge dessert cart--it will call you, with the signature featherlight wedding cake, dense and deadly chocolate mezza notte, respectable tiramisu, and certainly not least of all, a solid New York cheesecake with strawberry cream, impressively authentic.

Lunch diners get a voyeuristic view of action at The Tank pool deck, and a limited selection of their most popular items, augmented by some creative panini, and an old school ""Nugget"" salad.

I think they have good deals on the pizzas during happy hour.",97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ,3,0,4,vAvX8PyuzpoGEN-gaJvp0g

Their bottles of wine are cheaper here compared to other Vegas restaurants. Cakebread was $84 instead of the usual $100. I didn't really compare prices on the rest of the bottles. 

I got the ravioli alla vodka, which was $16.99. For how much I got it seemed a bit high in price to me. However, my husband got a fettuccine dish that was huge and only cost a dollar more. So, I guess the value varies depending on your dish. Both dishes, however, we're delicious.

The appetizers choices of antipasti and calamari were both excellent. A careful fork full of baby purple onion and blue cheese from the antipasti platter was the killer combination, if you're a fan. The calamari came crisp and tasty. 

Entrees included a great Chicken Parmigiana; however, our server was confused with the Chicken Parmesan $10 monthly special we ordered. This was later corrected. Paglia e Fieno was expected to be lathered in a rich Parmesan cream sauce but ended up rather bland. Similarly, a less spicy version of Fettuccine Campagnola was served.

5321548,2015-05-24,2,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"Let me start this review off by bragging on the bread. Holy shizballs, the fresh baked bread with the basil and garlic infused olive oil was the bomb. I could have eaten that all day. I wish the other food was on this same level.

So, my first experience with the Grotto was ordering Chicken and Goat Cheese Pizza. The crust was just okay, but I loved the sauce and the goat cheese. The chicken unfortunately tasted boiled versus grilled so it gave a weird one note texture experience and almost blandness. I think I would have enjoyed the pizza as a vegetarian option better. Also, the price I paid for it made me shake my head. Vegas is overly expensive for no reason. 

On day two, I was really wanting brunch and their brunch options caught my eye. I HAD to have the Ossobuco Hash. It sounded way amazing. So I ordered and I think it confused the waiter that I wasn't drinking. Look, the prices I've ran into have turned me almost tea totaller. Plus, watching drunk douchebags over the past 24 hours have turned me off. 

So I order my food and I'm just people watching while trying to figure out if I can eat my food without choking on the fumes of cigarette smoke- because obviously it's 1995 vs 2015, and my food comes out, I look down and I'm immediately disappointed. I don't see any of the rich colors associated with Ossobuco. It just looks like shredded, boiled beef. Also, I was failing to see the hash part. But the biggest sin were the two petrified volley balls sitting on that plate masquerading as poached eggs. No cook with pride would serve that. No line runner worth their salt would approve that. No waiter paying close attention would let that mess make it to me. They were boiled eggs. For the amount of time I waited (and I'm an easy, easy going person to wait on) and knowing how many hands had to touch that plate, I was kinda livid. Well, more insulted. Not all of us are so drunk that everything looks awesome. I had to track down my waiter and tell him what was wrong and it's like he knew! I'm like WTF, if you knew the eggs weren't poached correctly, WHY would you serve them to me?! With no other moisture in the dish, it hinged on the runny yoke. 

So he takes the plate and I wait some more. Finally a woman brings it out and she's cordial enough but something about her gave an air of agitation. Well excuse me doll face for having a sense of culinary pride. I thanked her for my order and was happy to see things looked right. I broke the eggs and was very pleased as the yoke ran beautiful on my plate. I tucked into the meal and it was okay. There were missteps pertaining to layered flavoring and again, the key ingredients of Ossobuco. It definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good or great either. It was just okay.

Service was great, we had a nice view of the pool and tank, but I found the food at Maggiano's better and probably cheaper too! 

We had the prosciutto wrapped sea bass over veggies/potato - the veggies were really good. I think my husband had the mistake of of asking for his fish more well done than seared coz then the prosciutto was over done (and kinda tasted burned/fuel) and did no justice to the fish. I just had crispy risotto and meatballs. Both were good but nothing to write home about or something I couldn't make myself.

The bruschetta is a really nice appetizer, although it apparently was inconsistent from one time to the next, as my out of town relatives were disappointed that the bread seemed to be different from their previous visit. Nonetheless, it was quite tasty.  The Tiramisu dessert unfortunately really missed the mark...I've had much better and it didn't taste at all of coffee or any type of liquor, more like caramel or something.  So, that was the main downpoint.  Eggplant parmesan was okay, could have used a bit more seasoning as the eggplant flavor didn't come through in the dish itself, but hey, it was still good, a large portion (for me anyway), served hot and fresh..... and for the blend of atmosphere and very attentive service you get here, you could do worse than coming to The Grotto for dinner.  If I came back would try other things on the menu, maybe the pizza, as I'm sure there are some stand outs that are quite good.  Have fun!

A couple of friends and I were going out for lunch. I was early, so I took a stroll around the property and was blown away by how modern and clean everything was.

At first, I was apprehensive about the separated dining area. During peak hours, crossing traffic to get to the part near the pool must be similar to playing Frogger with a banquet tray. The weather was gorgeous and the pool is beautiful, so I understand why they seat this area first. As the first party there, for lunch, we got a central table near the window. 

October is pizza month. They are running a chef's special for $9.99. The special is a basic cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pizza. It was delicious and easily shared between two. So why in the world did we get bruschetta, chicken fettuccine alfredo, and lasagna? Both pastas also comes with an Italian salad. It was was overkill. Yet, it was also a death I am willing to experience again. I am not a huge fan of cream sauces, but I even took a few bites of the pasta. The lasagna was my favorite. It is a bit more saucy than I normally like, but the flavor was good. The pizza is a thin crust style that I was thankful for because I could not handle any more carbs.

5388774,2011-10-12,0,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,"Let me preface by saying the 3-stars came strictly from the food and the amazing table we had.

After the Lillie's Noodle House BS (see review), we were irritated, flabbergasted, and hungry. We weren't in the mood to head to the Strip, nor were we wanting to search Downtown for a place to eat. We happened upon the Grotto and snatched up a seat. We put our name in and were told it would be 20-30 minutes, not too bad. We all needed a drink and decided to head to the bard for drinks and maybe an appetizer.
We sit down and look over a dinner menu. The same blonde, short-haired, older lady kept sprinting by us. After a few times, she said she'd be right with us. After a few more times, she stops by our table to ask if we were waiting for a table in the restaurant, we said we were, and she said, ""Oh thank God, that's the best news I've heard all night"" and goes back to the Indy 500. She laps us multiple times before we flag her down to order. She took our order and began her foot race all over again. Within five minutes we had our alcohol but no water. She gave us the excuse, ""it's hard to get water around here"" and continued her sprints. I felt bad for her because it seemed she was the only one working as a bar server and she was running around frazzled and stressed, but come on, it's not that hard to get water. She ran by at least three more times with the same excuse. I paid the tab, gave her a pretty good tip, and it was time for dinner. We never ordered our appetizer.

My brother walked up to the hostess station and mentioned that it had been about twenty minutes. One of the girls said she could seat us now and then grabbed four menus and walked off in the direction of the table, leaving my brother in the middle to make the decision to get our attention or to follow Speedy Gonsalez. He followed her and made it to the table with just enough time for to thrown down the menus and mutter, ""Enjoy"". We eventually caught up.

Our table was against the glass overlooking the beautiful pool and shark tank, which was lit nicely for the evening. In need of a other drink and dinner, we checked the menu and decided what we wanted to eat. Silent Bob, our waiter, walked past the table multiple times, never acknowledging us. Finally, after the bus boy brought us water and set down the bread and olive oil (very good), our order was being taken. I think the waited maybe said four words to us. The pattern of passing our table continued until our drinks and appetizer (bruschetta) were ready. The bruschetta was amazing!

Dinner came out about twenty minutes later and was delicious. I can't recall what we ordered because I was so appalled by the whole evening. First, we're basically told that we're not wanted in Lillie's and then we're basically ignored at Grotto.

The food here was good, deserving of a full five star rating. Too bad service counts in my book, this restaurant barely deserves my generous three-star rating.",o_dPk6REa-SPz0RD4J04Zw,2,0,3,VuucXCyPw50_uvuvC_a8SA

We made a reservation and they were running a little behind, about 15 minutes.  They offered to take my cell # and call me when our table was ready.  It was ready right at about the 15 minute mark.  We received bread and water almost immediately after we were seated.  Kimmie, out waitress came over and introduced herself and took our drink orders.

I cannot say enough about Kimmie.  The restaurant was very busy and Kimmie was a dynamo in action, but she took the time to answer all our questions about the menu and keep our drinks full throughout our meal.

We started with the bruschetta and it was delicious.  My had the spinach, pear and bacon salad and the chicken piccata .  I had the tomato basil soup and the veal kickerello.  The soup was outstanding.  Creamy with a ton of tomato flavor.  The veal was tender with a touch of lemon served with fettucine alfredo.  The salad was good, my wife didn't care for the balsamic dressing, but Kimmie was happy to replace it with the house Italian.  The chicken piccata was very good as well.  It came with angel hair pasta and sauteed asparagus.  The asparagus was a little tough, but tasty.  I don't remember what is was called, but we had the angel food cake with strawberries.  It looks impressive and tasted out of this world.  I nice finish to a great meal.  

The tomato soup was so good we had to come back and try it again along with one of their pizzas for lunch.  We split a pizza and a meatball panini and both had a cup of the tomato basil soup.  The soup again was great.  The pizza was thin crust and crisp on the edges, but just slightly not as crisp as I would like in the middle.  The meatballs were tasty, but I would skip the panini next time as it was just OK.  Service again was outstanding.

Too bad we prefer to drink other types of booze. Our bartender was a sweetheart with a heavy hand. She was trying hard to get us drunk within the hour, bless her heart.

ROASTED HERB CHICKEN PIZZA ($13.99, $7 during happy hour):

The herb chicken was moist and juicy, but I didn't get much herbs or seasonings on it. Everything on this pizza worked with the goat cheese (basil, garlic, caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the chef also added sun-dried tomatoes, in addition to the roasted tomatoes that was listed on the menu. YUM!

CALAMARI TOTO ($11.99):

It's hard for me to turn down fried calamari or fried chicken, so heck yea - I ordered this! 

It's a bit overpriced, but I would still order it again. 
Our fried calamari arrived piping hot with both the tentacles and calamari rings. The zesty marinara dipping sauce made the dish even better.

We had a very large group for dinner on New Years Eve without a reservation. The restaurant seated all 10 of us in 15 minutes. 

The food was really good and I had to stop myself from eating my pasta and sausage before I got too full. The house bread was soft and the dipping oil perfect. We split 2 orders of artichoke dip and it was cheesy goodness that didn't last.

Many diners got the manicotti like pasta roll which looked like a smaller portion than other dishes, but no complaints.

They very efficiently split the checks and cashed us out in time. And they were very very busy.

Only negative is that my husbands dinner was last to arrive by more than 10 minutes. I guess the kitchen failed the checkpoint-twice.

Our flight got in a little before lunchtime so we made our way to Downtown soon after retrieving our rental car. Grotto is located inside the Golden Nugget Casino & Hotel. I'm very familiar with the Nugget having stayed there in the past but had never dined at Grotto. One of our classmates is a Vegas local and suggested dining there. It was definitely a good call. 

We ordered calamari for our table and I went with the grilled chicken panini minus the mozzarella. It also came with roma tomatoes and mayo. The sandwich was very good. The grilled chicken was tasty and not dry. The chicken was also cut into pieces and I was real happy with it. The waffle fries the panini came with were very good. I really liked them. Nicely seasoned and went well with the panini. Good sandwich. I would get again in the future. The plate came with a small bowl of ketchup for dipping the waffle fries. I liked that. 

Other entrees ordered at our table were the portabello panini, pizza and pasta bolognese. Everyone was very happy with their individual orders. The calamari was great. It came with marinara dipping sauce and lemon to squeeze accordingly. Great appetizer. 

Service was good. Water for everyone. A moscow mule. sodas... All brought to our table with a smile. Manager on duty was very personable and we enjoyed our meal at Grotto for sure. Definitely a place to check out when at or around the Nugget.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,2,1,4,BEoGLl4twaiGyIbcwHsDuA

My visit with a homie was due to a small wedding reception dinner at a nearby chapel.  Can you say elope?  Congrats to the love birds Moses and Bree!  Unfortunately, we missed the wedding reception by more than an hour, but made it for the dinner...you could say that we was behaving like we was really related to the bride and groom, lol.  So I played the role of that uncle that just comes through something on everything, and when everything is all ""ate"" and done, it's deuces! J/k... 

At first glance, I thought this was just your average casino diner filed with transient d-bags, bit not at all the case.  A look at the menu, and a brief Yelp review, quickly changed my mind.  The use of space is efficient and doors a good job with separating the restaurant from the casino floor.  A view of the pool and shark tank was a pleasant surprise as well.  

My buddy and I opted to split the chicken herb pizza since it was a small informal dinner with the bride and grooms closest associates.  There is also a full bar and local brewery beer selection.  That alone can make this man happy.  The pizza was astounding, anything with goat cheese is a major plus for me, bit the overall pizza was scrumptious nonetheless.

Although, our late arrival prevented me from peeping out everyone else's offers.  I love marveling over others' orders to plan my next attack, lol.  I did see some oversized meatballs and pasta specialties, enough to know there are some good stuff on the menu.  A return trip is in order the next time I'm downtown.

We were driving without a destination, with only the mutual purpose to find a restaurant somewhat near Cashman Field before Beau S. and went to the game. Remembering the wonderful smell wafting out of the Italian restaurant at the Golden Nugget two weeks prior, we ended up at Grotto.

At close to 5 PM yesterday (4/18/11) the place was empty. I don't know why but almost every time I go out to eat, the restaurants seem to be completely void of life. Our waitress took a bit to come take our order. Beau ordered an appetizer of fried ravioli after I noticed how small the $13 antipasti platter was that another table ordered. They were decent, but came with 8 pieces. I'm unsure of the exact price, but I know they were overpriced.

Beau ordered the chopped salad ($15) and I ordered the lobster bisque ($9) My soup was good but a bit small of a portion. Beau salad was more of a pulverized salad. The lettuce was chopped up into lady bug sized portions and he ended up eating the cheese out of it and leaving a bunch of salad still on the plate when we left. 

The waitress was neither good nor bad. I think she forgot to bring us the bread basket and more refills would have been nice. Honestly, for $38ish, I think we could have gotten better food somewhere else.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,1,2,0ozYmxIsdNEYkVZPUbY8rw

We saw a lot of sights, went to see the Million Dollar Piano concert featuring Elton John.......gambled, drank and ate at a bunch of restaurants.  By far the best food, drinks and service we received over the course of our time in Las Vegas was at The Grotto.

The Grotto is an Italian restaurant in the Golden Nugget Hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas, right in the heart of the Fremont Street Experience.  Before I go any further I want to recognize our server, Ricardo.  WOW!!  Ricardo provided perhaps the best service I have experienced at any restaurant in my 50 year lifetime.  Super friendly, super accommodating, knowledgeable and efficient.  A perfect gentleman, and helped make this night memorable for all in our party.

Drinks were ordered (with Ricardo's help/input), and they were all amazing!  Dinner was ordered (once again with Ricardo's helpful knowledge and suggestions/flexibility), absolutely no complaints about the food.  In fact, once the entrees came our table became quiet for the first time as everyone was eating, and trying each others selections.  Complete satisfaction!  

My sister in law apparently had told Ricardo that it was my birthday, so after the main course, here he comes with a piece of an amazing dessert which featured angel food cake and whipped cream (and much more).  We all tried it, and although no one was really very hungry, we ordered two more desserts; a piece of cheesecake and tiramisu for the table.  The cheesecake was the big winner of the three, by the way.

Overall, a huge shout out to The Grotto for providing an unforgettable evening.  Another huge shoutout to Ricardo.  I am positive that you should be recognized by your management for being such an outstanding server/employee.

A real surprise for a hotel restaurant!",qAuZ9Qi7iSqukH40iQdWXg,2,0,5,dGzY5RTX142YBy3Tj-DWaA

We went to a highly rated, celebrity chef owned/supported Italian restaurant just before visiting Grotto and man did Grotto restore my faith in the quality of Vegas food.

The pastas were perfectly cooked with delicious sauces. My pizza was soft, well appointed with toppings, and had awesome cheese. Our server almost seemed insulted when each of us said ""stop"" for our fresh grated Parmesan (I promise I had plenty on my pizza).

All the servers were wonderfully friendly and helpful. I do wish that they had done a bit better job cleaning the table (some splattered sauce specs were still visible), but it was not terrible considering we were at bar seating. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food and even though there was a wait we were accommodated in the bar area fairly quickly!

Definitely would return here if I needed to know I was getting a good meal in Vegas. Sadly there are just too many options to just pick one.",xSNkT7n5tKtl62WFNIekZw,1,0,5,DEyqonJnOTfRMKr30vw9DA

Bread basket was great too. Perfect bread - crispy crust and soft middle. If I came back, I'd order that again. My husband's order was messed up, so they brought him some lobster bisque to enjoy while he waited for his correct meal. Nice touch. Great service. Not too impressed with the lobster bisque, but he liked his steak and Parmesan panini. I'd come back here for sure.",f1b0ZlVwKnk7jdnLle8Zmw,0,0,5,enVjyL1krrGjWPi496DG-Q

It made for an even worse experience. My friend ordered a pasta dish that tastes like pure lemon zest. We ordered a side of Alfredo sauce to try and cover it up, it didn't work, she didn't eat.",g6jPypsKpuBuDS3IXaydEw,1,0,2,QCJeH3Bnm-tR1oYEEEqgoQ

I had a lightly breaded chicken with lemon and caper sauce, it was AMAZING!  My son's pizza was very inexpensive ($5?) and he loved it.  My other son's penne with red sauce was also inexpensive but a very small portion.  I ended up spooning my side (noodles) over to his dish; we were both full and happy.  The strawberry cake was also huge and to die for, delish, really great.  Service would be my only complaint.  Our server was REALLY quite, or he hated us, one or the other.  He would hardly acknowledge or speak to us, we were not sure if he was really shy or what but our food made up for everything.  I would say that I was not impressed that once we left the table he ran over to check the bill/tip, a bit cheap in my eyes, especially for such a nice place.  Make a reservation if you can, and go ready to eat.  Enjoy!!",GGPghxUw9iQLB9hi1h-dZg,0,1,5,X_r_ShPIq4sh-hljQibz4A
