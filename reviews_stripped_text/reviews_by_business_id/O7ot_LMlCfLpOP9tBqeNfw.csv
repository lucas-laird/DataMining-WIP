Atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why I often prefer Kabuki to other places in the area.  Comfy private booths, tables, sushi bar, and an outdoor patio.  Usually crowded from happy hour (great specials) to closing, but I've never had to wait more than 10-15 mins.  Extensive cocktail menu, decent wine selection and several flavored non-alcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade.  Edamame comes with all sushi orders.  Good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing, decent seaweed salad but not my fav.  Lots of apps, including fried eggplant and calamari.  Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls).  Extensive menu with lots of pictures, and lots of non-sushi items including teriyaki, noodle dishes, soups, seafood, etc.  Fresh fish, great service & atmosphere!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,4,Rr7DUgBcjzKGQ3KiONi-7A

This is the biggest let down in this town when it comes to a menu. The food is tasteless. Anyone who eats Japanese food would be totally discussed with this chefs idea of Japanese. Cucumber salad terrible. Tempera is totally tasteless. This chef hasn't a clue what Japanese food is or what's it's supposed to taste like. I am embarrassed that the public likes and more especially tourist are fooled into believing this is KABUKI. Everything we tried was completely tasteless and a terrible presentation. Service staff was inattentive, and to worried about selling specials. Did not listen to what we wanted only what he wanted to upswell.",gt0KuGhFZB-6wPEJ4x-1Ew,0,0,1,I7-dav--T24WUuxKv9JbmQ

I came back later that night with hubby and we gave it a shot.  All I can say is I'm glad that we didn't pay full price or I would have been pissed.  The ""happy hour"" sushi and rolls seemed old, like they were trying to get rid of them before they went bad, and EVERYTHING was loaded with green onions on the top.  I like onion, but not on top of my sushi.  Take my advice, if you want good sushi, find a hole in the wall joint, not this fancy looking spot just because of their stellar location.",vgHrJWuR3ZBBmWW9AN0oKw,0,0,2,3Yo9VhSR3f9iKARA1nTeNQ

177876,2010-10-18,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"My boyfriend, a friend and myself checked out Kabuki's happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was surprisingly... dead. I think there was one other table. It got a little bit more busy later but still surprisingly slow for a Friday, I thought.

Their saketinis are sooo yummy. First, I got the creamy peach and that was very tasty.. sweet but not too strong. My second drink was the Fuji Apple saketini and that was.. kind of strong and it didn't taste like Fuji apples.. my friend said they put apple puckers in there.. that was all I could taste pretty much. I tried my friend's mango chu-hi (a sochu drink) and it was good.. kind of weak, but she said there is mango puree in there. yum!

For appetizers:
-Spicy Tuna Salad ($4.95 HH) Spicy tuna on top of spring lettuce, shredded cucumber and radish sprouts. Good stuff, but I just don't like the ground up spicy tuna.. I like them in chunks!
-Sesame Chicken ($4.95 HH) 
-Salmon nigiri ($2.50 HH) 
-Vegad Roll ($5.95 HH)
-Agedashi Tofu ($3.95 HH) 

They still have reverse happy hour, I think starting at 9pm. It used to buy select items and regular price and get the second item (in the same category) for a $1 but I think they did away with this. 

Overall, their food and happy hour is good. I'd say regular price, they are kind of high. But that could be due to being located in a popular shopping center.. but who knows. Will be back :)",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,1,1,4,VU9SakCAsp1R0TtqpA19vA

I love kabuki in California and they never seem to have this problem. I've given this place multiple visits and chances to see if maybe it was just off days, but they just don't have their sushi together apparently. 

Work on that Alaskan roll sushi chefs! 
Maybe Los Angeles locations can help you have better quality sushi.

The table booths seem dirty. The walls are nasty looking. The little glass separators always have finger prints. The sunshade has sauces all over them. It's dusty in table lights. Not a very clean atmosphere.

291751,2011-02-13,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"So, hubby and I got stuck (literally) at Town Square last Halloween due to Town Scary (Halloween event on Sunday, October 31st).  You know, where kids walk past stores and trick-or-treat, etc.  There were ton of families milling about. Seriously, I've never seen so many people at Town Square before. We tried to leave at some point and realized that it would take us a good hour just to get out of the parking lot. At that point, we re-assessed plans to eat dinner at home and decided to eat at Town Square instead.  So we decided to check-out Kabuki because it was one of the restaurants at Town Square we hadn't tried.

Admittedly, I was a bit resistant to the idea of chain sushi restaurant at a big retail shopping center. So I didn't have the highest expectations. But -- big but -- I was pleasantly surprised! We sat at the sushi bar and had the following rolls:     

--Vegas roll
--Spider roll
--Baja roll
--Spicy tuna tempura roll

Two initial thoughts: the Vegas and Baja rolls were the bomb.  The Baja roll was not only different, but excellent.  It had jalapeños and pico de gallo on top. It was sooooo good! It was light, fresh, and flavorful. Same goes with the Vegas roll. I am a big fan of tempura sushi and cream cheese in rolls (which I know not everyone is a big fan of), so this was the best of both worlds.

I've subsequently visited during Happy Hour. The Happy Hour specials are off a smaller menu, but still nothing to sneeze at. I had some cucumber concoction and it was delicious.

So you can understand my desperation and excitement when we came across Kabuki today.  I mean, in comparison to Japanese restaurants in California (Northern and Southern), Kabuki is mediocre.   But...For me, today, it was like a thirsty man stranded in the desert for extended periods of time tasting his first drink of water in weeks.  

I ordered a veggie roll, slathered it with wasabi and had a foodgasm right there in front of all my co-workers.  I also ordered shoyu ramen, the noodles were overcooked and the broth was tasteless, but beggars can't be choosers....So this place gets 3 stars.

The dynamite roll there used to be my absolute favorite. I remember the price of a dynamite roll used to be no more than $5, now they raised the price to almost 9 bucks!! Totally not worth the price and when I ordered it the other day it seems as if they changed up the ingredient. I don't ever remember them putting crab mix on top. Less scallops, onions and mushrooms. Even the sauce was different.  The miso ramen lost all it's flavor. I ordered one of their newest items, the ebi takoyaki, and that was disgusting as well. I basically ordered $60 of food, took one bite of every thing and was done for.

I came in from out of town for New Year's to visit my sister and her boyfriend, who live in Henderson. They love Kabuki back from when they lived in So Cal. I wanted to treat them to a nice NYE meal, so we made reservations here, which were available on Open Table at 815, 830, and 845.

Our reservations were for 815 but we were running 15 min late so I called ahead. I was assured it was no problem, though was also advised that they had ""last call"" for both food and drink at 845, which seemed odd since their last res was for 845. 

Upon our arrival, the hostess looked a bit put out and reminded us of the 845 ""last call"", but also assured us that we were welcome to stay in the restaurant as long as we liked so as to not feel rushed. We were quickly able to give our drink order and our server came by about 5 minutes later. We had to very quickly decide what our entire order would consist of, including all sushi/rolls, etc. This turned out fine, but I didn't appreciate having to order everything up front.

Our server was polite, but it quickly became quite obvious that the restaurant staff were closing the restaurant down, to the degree that 15 minutes after having our food, our server was coming to get our soy sauce bottle ""out of the way"" - to which I objected as we were obviously still in the middle of dinner. He then dropped the bill off a very short time later. Having felt rushed from the moment we entered the restaurant, I asked to speak with the manager. She assured we could stay ""as long as we liked"", though didn't so much as offer any apology for our treatment - quite frankly, she was probably directing them to close as quickly as possible.

The 2-stars was because the food was quite good, otherwise it would've been one star. I don't understand for the life of me why a restaurant would advertise having reservations available on any night, let alone NY Eve, up until 845 when they're closing at 9pm - and won't offer any additional access to food or drink after 845. I haven't felt this unwelcome in a restaurant for years, if ever.

To top it all off the buser spilled a beverage on the table next to us and hit me. no additional napkins or apologizes were provided leaving me to sit here with whatever sticky drink that was. this was a very unexpected experience.,Tj_i_chdjyY9sJj155xv2g,0,0,2,QClKQPfo7DLkO3pmp77P9A

548844,2011-03-20,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Went to Kabuki last night on a date. My first time trying sushi.

Now let me state... I consider myself to be fairly open-minded about food, and willing to try new dishes. I'd always avoided sushi because 1) I was worried that I would be repulsed by the texture and 2) sushi is such a broad dish that it can be very intimidating to order. I learned new lessons last night.

I ordered the cha-siu Ramen. It was cold and windy outside, so noodles and broth sounded perfect. My date ordered the spicy tuna roll, a screaming orgasm with fresh wasabi, and the geisha roll. 

I have nothing to compare it to, obviously, but everything was delicious, particularly the screaming orgasm. It is an appropriately named dish. Everything tasted very fresh, and the flavors all complemented each other harmoniously. The ramen was really good as well... the pork was a touch overcooked, at least for me, but the broth was warm and spicy, with perfectly cooked noodles.

The service was spot on and the ambiance was inviting and comfortable. I look forward to trying new dishes next time.",HGINFgk9adbHHE6AfnhpwA,1,0,4,POotlFqYiwRHbCbGYF2ouA

Kabuki is what i find wrong with almost all ""mall style"" restaurants.  
All decor no substance.
We have been here a few time over the year and this was our last.  I was hoping it would get better since opening but i feel it is going south.

We sat at the sushi bar.  Drinks arrived with complimentary chilled edamame.  Not my favorite so we ordered Garlic edamame and baked mussels.  The edamame was oily and overly cooked. the baked mussels were bland at best.  We also had a spicy tuna roll and stopped there.  The tuna looked washed out, (super light pink in color).  It didn't really taste like anything??

Aside from the mediocre food is the sushi bar set up.  We sat near the center of the bar.  The sushi chefs put the menu items on the counter in front of them and the servers from the restaurant lean over the customers (ME) to pick up their order.  If I wanted to sit at the service bar I would have. I do not know why they can not have the waiters use the far end of the bar to pick up but i found it so annoying I almost stood up the last time to make a point. My wife and I felt in the way, so we promptly paid and left.

Spicy Tuna Roll - Pretty good.

Gyoza - Very good, all though a little small.

Shrimp cocktail - served in a cool neon lit Champagne glass, the presentation was cool, but the actual shrimp had to be frozen.   Pretty bad quality.  We didn't finish it, and we are all fat guy big eaters.

we ordered our foods and they were ok, pretty mediocre. the udon broth was very strong and the yakatori chicken was not very good. the spicy tuna roll was ok; it's clear this place is a chain.

the thing worth reviewing: they turned off the music, turned up the lights, and started putting chairs up on tables while we were still eating. we were not there much past closing, so it's not as if we were burdening the staff.

next time just tell us you can't seat us, because we would have gone somewhere else. actually, next time we will go somewhere else.",5c8jqxnUi5hdPNIJ3XsroA,0,0,2,C34QCP2AwDEPS83loSyshQ

I got one roll (Alaskan Roll) and it was terrible ( Thought about throwing it at someone) Sushi is one of my favorite kinds of food and this place ruined it for me, even though I'll probably get some sushi pretty soon. The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because the atmosphere is nice and I met one of the most amazing and beautiful girls here so It was definitely a great  experience  but they need to step there game up and at least have all you can eat sushi to make up for the quality of the food.

PROS: Location, happy hour, pricing, rewards program and ambiance. Another huge plus for me is the fact that they always have brown rice as an option. No matter where you live, it's easy to justify making a trip to Town Square. You can knock out your Sephora must-have purchases, explore the latest Apple technologies, grab a bite to eat with a friend and finish with your laser hair removal appointment, all in one trip. So after you stuff your face with savory sushi rolls, you can walk around and burn a few calories afterwards. #winning

CONS: Although they have a good happy hour, it's super convenient and not too expensive, I prefer ""I Love Sushi"" or ""Spicy Tuna"" in Henderson as far as taste and freshness. Also, they close at 10pm Sunday - Thursday and 10:30pm on Friday's & Saturday's, which might be a bummer for those who get late night sushi cravings. 

HELPFUL TIP(S): Sign up for the reward card if you plan on being a regular sushi goer here. They will send you a free $15 digital gift card for your birthday month and $25 each time you reach 500 points (i.e. spend $500 dollars).

 This location is close enough to the strip, so visitors can have great food for off the strip prices. The best place to park is in the back by H&m, since it's right across. BTW.. Its really a great H&M but go before kabuki because you will be too full to try on that cute pair of pants.

If you are coming with someone who doesn't like sushi, there are plenty of other options. The sukiyaki is a good alternative and filling or the chicken fingers.

So Kabuki is a place that's a little bit on the fancy side of Japanese dining. I would even go as far as to say that it might be a little Americanized and more focused on how westerners like their Japanese cuisine.

It's not a bad thing, I just wouldn't consider it authentic Japanese by my own standards. That, however, is up to you to judge.. am i right?

The food is great! It may not be on par with some of the more authentic Japanese places that I've been to but it is definitely worth trying. I honestly have not tried anything on the menu that wasn't sushi so this review might be a little useless for those of you looking to find information on their entrees and such.

However, if you're curious about their sushi then I can tell you that it is indeed something worth coming to Kabuki for.

They are pretty creative and they've got some rolls that I haven't seen offered at other sushi places such as their 2 in 1 sushi roll, the Rose roll which pretty much takes a spicy tuna roll and a shrimp tempura roll and mushes it together to form one amazingly delicious roll that happens to be my favorite :) I've also seen something called the Baja Roll where they take pico de gallo and put shredded pieces of crab in it and take that and top off a spicy krab roll with it. Damn was it good.

If you're not rollin' in dough, then I suggest coming here during happy hour or reverse happy hour because most of the specialty rolls are about half off and they have a lot of good drinks for cheap too.

For tourists, Kabuki is located inside of a mall called Town Square which is at the end of the strip. I assume that most tourists stop by this mall sometime during their trip anyway so if you're ever at Town Square craving Japanese food, Kabuki is the spot.",-u_PHSe7PYi4RnarqtVLGw,2,0,4,3-oZdoSw6_FdFqAB0Us7fA

AMBIANCE:
The place wasn't crowded at all and the only spots with other hungry people where the booths and sushi bar. My boyfriend and I took a booth as well. Really like that it wasn't crowded as it usually is.

FOOD:
I ordered their fried calamari & spicy tuna roll. The boyfriend ordered a Vegas roll and a gold rush? I forgot, correct me if I'm wrong on that last one. 
Fried calamari-Cooked just right, squid wasn't chewy or tough, but I would've wanted more lemon as I do like adding lemon juice to anything fried.The yellow tangy sauce was more to my liking than the sweet brown sauce but still good.
Spicy tuna roll-the sesame seeds balanced the taste for me but I couldn't really taste the tuna, I tasted a lot of the spiciness
Gold rush?-Personally I'm not a fan of fried sushi, but I gave it a try! This roll was oddly sweet, it wasn't to my liking however. Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. 
Vegas roll-Actually kinda had the same taste as the Gold rush?, but minus the sweet flavor

SERVICE:
The guy who served us was like a ninja! He'd be there asking us what we wanted to drink, next thing you know he's disappeared and five minutes later he'd be back with our drinks! Then he reappeared and took our orders. Service was quick only took about 10mins for all our orders to get to our table. yay! But once it came to refills and the check, our ninja server was nowhere to be found.

To sum it up this is a great place to eat and enjoy yourself. I recommend to come here during their happy hour if you want to save some cash and get some sushi.",JDPIGmTkpZrIQhdFqbo78Q,4,1,4,ujuTtx67oXIaMnq355hPYQ

The service was fantastic. Brandon was offered good suggestions, never rushed us, and was very attentive. He made sure we knew that happy hour was ending and gave us one last chance to order off the happy hour menu. 

There are three sections to Kabuki; the sushi bar, the sake room and the main dining room. We sat in the main dining room which is well appointed that provides a nice environment and ambiance.

I was disappointed in the rolls I purchased; they were rolled too loosely and fell apart! :( Too expensive for the quality you get. Happy hour is cool.

Oh yeah, and their soups...well the broth tastes as if it's been premade by some mix rather than by fresh meats. It's nothing better than top-ramen. 

Lastly, I must say, their wait staff mainly consists of the typical non-japanese asians for an Americanize Japanese restaurant....I believe there is 1 or 2 people that were of Japanese decent.

Why did I go to the one in Vegas? Well friends that live there wanted to have dinner with the BF and I and they picked Kabuki. I decided to give it try because when you least expect it, things can surprise you. Right? But unfortunately, this time it didn't happen. 

I'll give the place props for being the nicest (decor + ambiance) one I've been to. However, I'm still not a fan of the food. I was very disappointed with the sushi yet again. I could get way better and way cheaper at other places. However, I did love their Tokyo Mojito in Lychee flavor. That was pretty delicious. The calamari was decent but I enjoyed it better than the rolls.

The other thing I didn't get was their plates. I mean they really tried to make it all nice and super chic but their humongous heavy frosted glass plates (for a small roll on each) were not working. We were seated at a booth and we BARELY got everything to fit. Someone needed to work on their space management or make the tables bigger.

Back to the positive. One other thing that I liked is that it's located in a pretty shopping area. Much like Victoria Gardens and it was beautiful at night (minus the overhead airplanes landing and taking off). haha

Unless someone absolutely has/wants to go, I won't even think of going back. If I have to, I'll stick to the alcohol and their appetizers.",X5qBvQtKvdT0w36uhxP4vA,10,9,2,8TSEhQozKGmKNYVeaQAx-Q

2074014,2014-05-20,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Located across H&M and Yogurtland, this restaurant is a great pitstop while shopping at Town Square.  Nice ambiance and superb customer service.  Make sure to call ahead especially on weekends to avoid the long wait.

Can't really remember the last time I dined at this place before this one.  First thing I noticed was the newly upgraded menu for 2014.  One of the standouts was the 'ankimo' (steamed monkfish liver on ponzu sauce and topped with spicy radish).  Considering of never having eaten fish liver before, I had to give this item a try.  Surprisingly, the flavor wasn't as irony as chicken liver or foie that one would expect.  In fact, it had a faint fishy taste but enough to remind you're eating fish entrails.   Other items on the new menu that seemed enticing include soy tako ebitaki (soy paper wrapped and lightly fried octopus and shrimp, topped with bonito flakes), spicy tuna on crispy rice and takosu (sliced octopus marinated in Japanese vinaigrette).  The restaurant also offers an extensive gluten-free and vegetarian menu.

Overall, Kabuki is definitely one of the better restaurants in the area.  Best time to check this place out is during Happy Hour which runs Mondays thru Fridays 3PM-6PM for great deals on food and alcoholic beverages.  They even have Reverse Happy Hour Mondays thru Thursdays 9PM-close and Sundays 8PM-close to pregame with your buddies before heading to one of the bars around the area.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,0,0,3,z0DT-u453uTqSime1vtyIA

We were there at 11:30 am on a Friday, just before the lunch rush. Liked the atmosphere, the conversation, and of course the food. I actually ordered a cocktail, the mango cho-hi (dangerous); sweet and un-alcohol-y tasting, just like I like em. I chose only one appetizer; although looking at the menu I could have gone for many more. I will just have to make it out to an happy hour some day. I went with the shitake tofu, very tasty; tried the crab miso (tons of crab), and my main meal was the unagi don (unagi rice bowl with avocado slices) accompanied by a salad or miso soup. I chose the salad, of course, just having downed the big bowl of crab miso. I have to admit I found the avocado slices with my eel a bit odd at first but before the meal was over, liked the melding of the two flavors. The girls had much tinier appetites than myself; J chose the sake sangria along with niku kushiyaki and the mozzarella tempura (appetizers) and M went with the salmon teriyaki luncheon special.

No, sorry, dude- but I've been to plenty of vegan restaurants over the years and had amazing healthy flavorful vegan dishes. So not only will I not be trying something off your regular menu, I will now never be coming back. You are very offensive and unprofessional.




I recently had an early dinner here. 
I had heard various reviews of their vegan sushi options for a long time and decided I wanted to try it for myself. 
The usual sushi place I eat at close to home is a bit pricey and I just wanted to change up the flavors a bit. 
Kabuki is a trendy place, busy, buzzing with activity, and since it is in town Square - not as casual as my neighborhood joint. 
I did like the selection on their veggie sushi menu.I tried a few items like the tofu and crispy rice and some veggie sushi. While they were creative in the making, the flavors did not knock me off my seat. They were just so -so. So nothing I would crave specifically to drive here in order. 
The service was good, the waiter was friendly enough and he made sure we had refills on our drinks. The sushi chefs were not very entertaining, seemed a bit young and not masters at their skill quite yet.
That being said, if I happen to be in town square and I'm hungry I would possibly eat at kabuki again. But I certainly wouldn't drive out of my way to come eat here.",QcckMs29Z47tuSyWDCMUlA,5,5,1,zQ_c-QPjzUebb3-y7lwzMA

The menu is vast and offers numerous sushimi and sushi rolls -- including two full pages of specialty rolls (8 pieces). The service is great; very kind and swift. They bring you a free bowl of edameme, too! Winning... and they had $4 Japanese bar on draft, which was much better than your run of the mill Bud Light or Miller Lite.

OK, the good stuff: the sushi. We all got it. I opted for the scallop roll (6 pieces), and it was awesome. The scallops are huge! It was mixed with cream cheese and really hit the spot. The best part was the lava roll: salmon, cream cheese, spicy tuna, deep-fried jalapeño, sweet sambal sauce. One of THE BEST sushi rolls I ever had. The ""lava"" is actually in the middle of the rolls, so forget the soy sauce and douse them in the sambal sauce. The jalapenos add flavor, but the sweet sauce makes it so it's not spicy. Highly recommend.

It's bad etiquette and poor presentation. I don't fault the staff for that, as they're preparing to specifications and to the expectations of people who frequent from the strip - go big or go home.

The rolls weren't very flavorful and used the same two sauces repeatedly. Can I get some eel or ponzu sauce? The gyoza were oddly dry. I'll take the 'chase down your waitress' service in Chinatown to get good, authentic sushi. Leave the huge piles of rice that can't fit my mouth for the tourists.

I ordered the jidori chicken ramen, with a spicy tuna roll on the side. The ramen was very bland, I have had more flavor in a cup of noodles. I finally had to ask them to bring Sriracha chili sauce out. The tuna was decent but lacking in the flavor department aswell.

They were located right next to H&M and Yogurtland in the town square. I walked pass it a lot but never really tried it. Due to my friend's recommendation, I decided to came here on my day off.

Design: The chairs and tables are made of woods, the light is semi dark semi light.

Service: The host was very friendly, he said hi to me the second I walked in and took me to my seat. My waiter was so nice and patient too, he answered all my questions and provided a kid menu for my friend's girl. 

Appetizer: 
Garlic edamame: they fried the garlic a little bit crispy and put the salt on top of the edamame, you are able to enjoy the crunchy flavor.

Seaweed Salad: seaweed salad pretty much taste the same anywhere, they put some veggie leafs underneath the seaweed salad.

Mixed tempura: I definitely love the tempura here, it doesn't give you those over fried disgusting oily taste. They lightly coated with the flour and deep fried it, so you can still taste the flavor of veggie and shrimp pretty well.

Sushi:
Spider roll: very nice presentation, but not impressed by the taste. The roll has soft shell crabs and crab meat.

California roll: personally I'm not a big fan of California roll, because I think it's too plain and simple. However, the California roll here is different, the freshness of crab meat and the cream cheese match so well together. 

Other:
BBQ Beef ribs: the beef taste so tender, the sauce they use goes so well with the beef. I would order again if I come back.",R494UCWNG5FSg_yhndq1hw,1,1,4,q0YKNsPWJ5dHNoxa3gjD4g

Okay I know Vegas is known for their AYCE sushi hot spots, but when you come here be prepared to spend $$$ cause they don't offer that. With that being said their sushi is really good and really fresh. As far as sushi goes,  I ordered their spicy tuna and cucumber rolls. The spicy tuna was on point, not too much mayo, not too much spice,  and not too much rice. The cucumber roll was just how I like it. My friend ordered their King Crab roll and she raved about it so I'll try that next time! Despite the prices,  I didn't feel like I wasted money on the sushi since it's good quality. What I do feel like I wasted my money on was their chasu ramen. I know I know,  I have no idea what I was thinking either..... In my defense I was suffering from allergies and thought soup would help. Honestly,  I've bought 0.35 cent ramen from Walmart that tasted better than what I had, and this was almost $9!!!! The broth was so watery and had no richness to it like what you would expect from real ramen. It's possible that the  soup base came from a packet that anyone could have easily found at an Asian supermarket for like $2. The noodles were also overcooked and mushy.  So please use this as a warning and skip the ramen! Go to Monta, Ramen Sora, or Fukumimi if you've got a taste for some delicious rameny goodness.  I will say that as a sushi place they've got great quality, and I look forward to coming back and exploring more of that section of the menu,  but no more ramen for me!",4aJhAqSYn8a0NPyQqHf-ZQ,1,1,4,ufsKYvRI0fqvdpABSeyTvQ

Sushi was pretty good. You have many other options not just sushi. We got the Vegas roll, the lasagna and the tako. I really didn't like the tako that much but the other 2 rolls are really good. I loved the peach iced tea. Definitely should try out that one. 
The price is pretty decent not too expensive even tho it's located inside town square.
The service was on point when my server constantly would check up on me. Seeing if I'm ok or not! The place is pretty fancy, comes with a cute little lighted candles, would be romantic for a date. 
The only negative thing would be, the hot stone grill bbq thing. It was $24.95 for one order( keep in mind you gotta wait for 20-30 mins for the hot stone thing to be ready) and we thought it would be a big order but turn out it only like 10 pieces of meat in there. Has no flavor either. Which was a disappointment for me. If you love grill BBQ, might as well go to ayce kbbq instead of ordering this. Bc w/ 24.95 you could afford a whole new ayce.

Very interesting and tasty twist on the spicy scallop handroll (my favorite), nice little sesame vibe, no mayo, and a perfect level of spice (tingle on the lips without full on tears).  Salmon skin roll and albacore were both good, and the unagi was surprisingly awesome (right off the broiler too, none of that cold mushy stuff they give you sometimes).  Spicy tuna wasn't spicy enough but still good fish.  Sushi chefs were great - the yellowtail was the chef's personal favorite and while ordinarily not something I eat, this stuff was YUM.  Finished off with the tempura red bean ice cream - good but I think I like red bean mochi better.  But still a nice ending.  Lemon drop cocktail was good as well. Only surprise?  No sunomono on the menu, boooo.  But if I am ever in Vegas again (which I doubt as I am not a fan, just here on business), I'll definitely be back.

I dine here every time I'm in Vegas and have always been more than satisfied. This time around was just the opposite. I went during lunch with my parents and my sister and ordered off the lunch menu. The server must have been new because the service was substandard. My sister and I ordered the tonkatsu and said lunch portion. The server asked, ""with tempura"" I said no just tonkatsu. He asked the same thing to my sister. I understand upselling, but if I want tempura I would ask for it. My parents ordered the salmon and tempura lunch combo and said they would be sharing it. The real issue occured when the bill arrived and we were all charged dinner prices. Mind you this was one in the afternoon. When I brought this to the servers attention he said ""oh, you wanted lunch?"" He said he didn't know that and would take care of it. He returned with the bill but to my surprise only one of the meals had been adjusted to the lunch price. I again said we all ordered lunch he said he didn't know that and would have to talk to the manager. Why I ask would one person order lunch and the other two dinner when we are there during lunch.  When the bill finally returned they still had the dinner charges on the bill and just took out one tonkatsu. The server said don't worry it comes out to the same as three lunches. I asked why couldn't they just charge us for the lunches so I could see it itemized and not just assume it was correct. At this point I was fustrated and went up to speak with the manager, (and I use this term ""manager"" loosely)Tom Suciawan. It finally dawned on me why this simple customer service issue turned into a hot mess. Tom wouldn't know customer service if it bit him in the a--. When I went up to him he proceeded to give me attitude and said rudely""it's all been taken care of and you got dinner portions for the price of lunch"". He said he already spoke to the server and would speak to him again. I replied that I simply wanted to bring this to attention, but was frankly surprised with his lack of customer service himself. I can see where his staff could lack in this area as Tom would be the last person who should be training them. With so many places to eat in Vegas, what brings me back is great service.

2698452,2016-03-09,4,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Kabuki is a fairly decent sushi spot located in the west part of Town Square across from the H & M.   As far as taste and value are concerned, you can get your sushi craving satisfied without breaking the bank.  Most of the standard rolls such as spicy tuna, California, yellowtail, Philly roll, etc. are around $5.  The rolls were not bad for the price and they did not skimp on the filling inside the rice.  However, their B.S.C.R. (baked scallop California roll) sounded better than it actually tasted.

Like what some other Yelpers whose culinary opinions I respect have said, the service is what brings this place down a notch.  Having to ask two or three times for an extra fork and spoon should never be a diner's problem.   Finding our server was often times a real life ""where's Waldo"" challenge.  

Following dinner, a request for the check and a to-go box was handled at a snail's pace.  We received the check, but could not find our server, or any other for that matter, to pick up my credit card.   After finally being able to pay, a second reminder to our server was the 'hint-hint' she needed to hand us a to-go box.   We packed our extra food (non-sushi items) and headed out quickly.

In a town full of sushi spots, go elsewhere.  When you are in Town Square though, go here to enjoy some decent sushi.  Just be prepared to wait an extended period of time at all phases of your dining experience.

My server was really nice and attentive when I first sat down and then when my food came he dropped off. I've been sitting here for ten minutes waiting for a Togo box and my check. I understand he is busy with the demanding table across from me. So other than that great service. 

The food was great. The fried dumplings were really good. Served on top of their sauce with some lettuce stuff in the middle. They give you complimentary edamame. Which was nice. Then my fried California roll came (I don't remember the name of it). But it was really good. I was so stuffed I only ate half and brought the other half to my co-worker. I would come back!

I usually stick with the sashimi salad - a medley of salmon, tuna, white fish and whatever other raw goodies they have on hand that day - all in a bed of greens.  The other nice part about Kabuki: their frequent diner card. Every time you get 500 points, you get a gift certificate for $25.

2937612,2012-11-22,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"I LOVE KABUKI. I would go during happy hour, lunch or dinner. My husband and I go to here quite often, mostly for lunch or happy hour. I love Town Square - what a great location for a restaurant like this. They have a great lunch menu with reasonable prices for the quality of food you receive. One of my favorite parts? THEY ARE GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!!!

On the bottom of the menu they state that they offer gluten free soy sauce and brown rice. I like brown rice better than white and since I'm gluten free, this is a definite plus. This means their staff is somewhat knowledgeable about gluten allergies. finding that at a sushi restaurant. I normally get one of their nigiri and sushi specials at lunch, brown rice, no wasabi (I am not sure if it is GF and not worth the risk), with just a hit of gluten free soy sauce and maybe a little ginger. Delicious. Of course, I cannot get any of those fancy rolls that are fried and dripping in calories, but that's okay! The fish I can have is fresh, delicious, not stinky and totally fulfilling in every way. Wash it down with a sake and you're good to go!

My husband gets the teriyaki chicken and tempura lunch special every time we go. He loves the tempura because it isn't too greasy, just a right amount of crunch and perfectly cooked every time. The teriyaki chicken is his favorite because it isn't too sweet, isn't drowned in too much sauce and is once again, perfectly cooked. It comes with a bowl of miso soup and a bowl of rice, so by the end of the meal he is absolutely full, and to get a 6' 7"" man full in one sitting with one plate without making him want to vomit due to MSG overload? Good times.

Come during any hour, but a lot of people love happy hour at Kabuki. Great roll specials and appetizer specials, but I'm a big fan of the large hot sake for $3. After a long day, it's nice to wind down with a large sake and a spicy tuna roll. The prices are great, service is consistently good and I love the location and ambiance. All around, this place is delicious and perfect any time of the day.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,0,0,4,9cKsOudEAqnTGbvt2Z7B0g

So I've come here a couple times and so far I've had a really good experience. The first time I sat at the bar and we ordered a couple rolls and some drinks. My favorite roll was the baja. It's a little spicy but so yummy. It's a spicy crab roll with a tomato salsa on top. My go to is always avocado roll. It's just simple and good and makes me happy. I've also tried the AAA box roll. It had good ingredients but when picking it up it would fall completely apart. Not so much fun. We had a couple other rolls the first time I went but nothing that stuck out at me. I went a second time with a group of friends. We grab a table and ordered our favorites to share. My friend Paris and Sam do this cute weird thing where they eat their first and last piece together... AWWW!! But that is besides the point. Paris ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll and a lotus on fire. Both were amazing. She even ate the flower. I'm a huge fan of crunch so anything with tempura crumbs is a win. My friend Theresa ordered her favorite. She got the dragon roll. It came out and I was in such awe I forgot to take a picture. It looked just like a dragon!! It also tasted like chicken. Very good. The most talked about was the Kabuki roll. Sam ordered this and had it mostly to her self, however I did try one of the orange egg looking things.. It was weird. Not my thing. My baja roll for this trip came out last and I though it would be a good idea to just stuff my face. I however did not chew the roll all the way and almost died. I had to step outside and spit out the roll before I choked. The pieces I ate after that we chew thoroughly. Kabuki has been good to me so far (aside from almost dying).

Once we were seated, our waiter came over shortly after. He was pretty awesome and really helpful the entire time. We asked him a few questions about the menu and even some things that we didn't see on the menu that they normally offered in LA which was the crab miso soup! Come to find out he was also from California and knew exactly what we were talking about but also had to relay the bad news that they unfortunately didn't offer that on the menu in Vegas! Bummer but it was okay we found plenty of more great things on the Happy Hour menu. All in all this was a great visit with excellent customer service!

I've sat at the sushi bar and a dinner table during the 3 times I've gone and I have had excellent service by the servers, manager, and sushi chefs all 3 times. Each were constantly attentive to anything I needed and made sure my plates were cleared promptly. The manager each time approached my table, asked about my experience and if I needed anything.They were quick to address anything I needed. It definitely shows that they care about their clientele. I even joined their free membership program where you can add points for discounts and free meals because I enjoyed the quality of food and service so much.

The menu spans sushi, noodles, traditional Japanese as well as fusion-y appetizers, larger plates, and hot stone BBQ. My boyfriend and I ordered a sampling of most of those items. He's half-Japanese and a raw fish aficionado to boot and I'm, well, not exactly one haha, but we both enjoyed the dragon roll (has unagi drizzled in a yummy sauce and soft-shell crab). *BONUS POINTS FOR BROWN RICE SUBSTITUTION ON THE SUSHI ROLL.* Chicken karaage + another flavorful/mildly spicy sauce and BBQ pork belly hit the carnivorous spot, and the portion size was perfect for sharing between two. The Tokyo quesadilla (mozzarella in a wonton shell topped with pico de gallo) was the fusion-y surprise, and it was a nice palate cleanser between the meat and fish. My sizable goblet of sake sangria was awfully refreshing.

Our waitress, Jenny, was so warm and friendly while offering efficient and attentive service. When we inquired she even asked the kitchen where my boyfriend can procure unagi on his own here in Vegas (we moved from L.A. and he misses the extensive Japanese grocery options of Southern California).

Decor is sleek and music was not overly loud. It was a perfect break from the sound level of our other Friday night activities. They have ample seating space for everything from pairs to larger groups.

I can't remember the name of the sushi, but it had lobster in it, it was sooooooo good!!! That was the first time I had seen lobster in sushi and I thought it was amazing!! 

Its located in town square so you have plenty of shops restaurants and a theater to go to when you're done. A great date place I might say. 

The ramen was good too, but I dont rather lean towards Tonkatsu, but my boyfriend loved it. Great customer service as well. Looks like they employ students from the area.

Here's a list of my favorite HH items (1st price is regular menu price, 2nd price is HH Price.

Broiled Mussel on Half Shell $6.95/$5.95
Comes with Six Mussels and they are seriously delicious made with a kind of sesame mayo sauce. I can't get enough!

Fire Cracker normally $7.95/$5.95
Spicy Tuna mixed with chopped tomato, served with egg roll chips.  This is great for sharing. Also I don't think it's as hot as it sounds. I like spicy foods but my friend doesn't and she was definitely able to eat this without issue.
Sesame Chicken $7.95/$5.95

Lightly fried (tempura) chicken marinated in sesame and ginger. I originally ordered this for my friend as I wasn't sure if she would like the other dishes I chose... but this became one of my favorites after the first bite. 

Calamari Rings $8.95/$5.95
This calamari is rings only, lightly battered with tempura. 
Tis was ok, personally I didn't love the tempura on this dish. However my friend mentioned that the smaller pieces were better.. Some of the pieces were big and a little much for me. I'd get it again but not my 1st choice.

Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll $7.95/$5.95
Sicy Tuna, avocado and tempura crunch. This one is really good. I really like that it's spicy but not overpowering. 
Another favorite roll is the Sun Kissed Roll (but it's not on the HH Menu)

Also, if you like champagne, the plum champagne drink is pretty good. Light and refreshing. 

Hostess staff leaves a little something to be desired, but bar staff has been great both times. Very good about refills and making sure I have everything I need.

I'm not sure about the restaurant side, but at the bar they give out complimentary edamame. Because it's free I don't want to complain too much. It comes out cold, which is not my preference, but it also is generally a little soggy. It's definitely not terrible and both times I was there I ate a generous portion. Just doesn't excel as much as the rest of the items I've eaten.

Maybe I'm spoiled after living in SF for 10 years and having some great sushi. Or maybe this place just doesn't get it. One of the more important components of a roll is the rice. It has to be perfectly sticky & be consistent in the ""hold the roll"" department. Both locations failed miserably at the rice. It's the basic component if this meal! The rice was either brittle, dry & fell apart or it was cold, rubbery & BLEH! 
Once the rice thing fell apart, it was pretty much downhill from there with flavoring & consistency. However, service at both locations was good and pleasant, our Town Square experience with Ana was great!",sfQXLZGk6beiSuNZYb8iSQ,2,0,2,nlalL_KekqazqZfbRBbwEQ

After one bite of one of the rolls, my fiance immediately knew the sushi was no good.  I took a bite, and although it didn't taste good, I never waste sushi.  So I ate both rolls against my better judgement.  Let's just say, I had to call in sick to work the next day because of digestive problems.  I am not surprised at all that another Yelper had a similar experience!

Because of my bad experience at Kabuki, this avid sushi lover has to stay away from all things sushi related for a little while.",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,1,0,1,KpLNLNPcUluk3FFQK8ZZkQ

We arrived and to our surprise had no line ahead of us. The hostess ignored us for a while, even after I walked right up to the counter in front of her and verbalized that we would like a seat, not saying anything, she then walked away. A few moments later people started to arrive to the restaurant and she came right in and began immediately seating every group. I had to walk back up and verbalize that she should seat us, before she did so.

Once seated and already halfway through eating, we were brought out the wrong rolls upon ordering a second round of sushi. When I mentioned it to the waiter, rather than be sure we received what we wanted, he argued with me that what he brought is what I asked for and that's how it is always served. (Even though we had ordered the exact same roll at the start of our meal and got a completely different one...the right one). The waiter continued to argue with me and finally, after being told he could bring us something different and charge us for both, we sent him away, finished the food and left in a rather bad mood.

The happy hour is awesome, the menu used to be bigger but it's still cool. I love their fusion rolls. If you like Mexican food, try the Baja roll, you won't be disappointed.
The service has always been great both in Town Square and Tivoli. The staff is very attentive and educated on their menu. I've never had a bad experience here.

3923406,2013-10-10,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Kabuki just might be the restaurant that makes me quit trying new places because they happen to be in the area where I'm running errands (I've had terrible luck with this lately), but that's how a friend and I found ourselves there after doing some shopping in Town Square.

Service issues abound. When we walked in, the host was on the phone. So we waited. And waited. Finally, rather than get off the phone, he just handed us menus and told us to seat ourselves. Seriously? We were not sure we should actually just seat ourselves at a random table in the dining room, so we carried our menus like vagabonds and headed over to the sushi bar. 

The food wasn't necessarily terrible; just mediocre and stinking of a lack of execution and effort. The ""Niku Kushiyaki"" was tough and way too salty, nothing like the tender, well-marinated version you'd find in authentic Japanese restaurants - especially disappointing as it's $6 for a very small portion (2 small skewers). The ""Steamed Clam"" on the menu mentions sake, so I hoped for something like asari sakamushi. Don't make that mistake, as it's nothing close. Kabuki adds soy sauce and it just overpowers everything else.

My friend ordered two rolls; I forget Kabuki's names for them, but basically a dragon roll and a baked crab roll. The rolls were not made well and were sliced super thinly to boot, so nearly every piece disintegrated when we tried to pick them up. Also, the rolls took forever to arrive (around 20 mins after we finished appetizers, even though we ordered them at the same time). My sushi (saba, hamachi, sake) was actually passable, although maybe it's just because my expectations were lowered so much by all the lousy dishes that preceded it.

I admit I agonized a bit over giving a +1 because the sushi chef and busboy were very friendly (and the busboy is the only reason we ever got our drinks refilled, as our waitress just ignored us or forgot) - but I just can't do it. Again, it's not that anything was so terrible, but that nearly everything was bad or at best, mediocre. Even if you're in Town Square and need a sushi/Japanese fix, go somewhere else or manage your fix for another day.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,6,1,1,4Lerij57KqlzIPW0JW3jzA

We did the communal munch, ordering several dishes and picking at them with our chopsticks. Here's a breakdown of our eats:

* Sunkist Roll: Good flavor to start, but the onion garnish placed on top of the sushi overpowered the taste of the salmon.

* Spicy Tuna over Sticky Rice: Fairly decent. Spicy tuna was comparable to most places and the sticky rice it sat on was decent.

* Oyster Shot in Ponzu Sauce: Are you serious? When did you order this, babe? It was good, but the sauce was definitely a bit salty. Great tasting oyster though!

* Korean Barbecue Short Ribs/Teriyaki Chicken with rice: The Korean BBQ was tender and juicy. I wish I could say the same for the chicken; that was a bit overcooked, making the chicken strips a little on the dry side.

The house salad was overpowered with the flavor of ginger. Definitely not a fan of that.

One of my rolls was a crab roll, but instead of that imitation crab meat, (which I still love) it was fresh king crab meat and absolutely delicious and worth every penny.

I liked that they offered us complementary edamame before we ordered at the sushi bar and I like how attentive our sushi chef was.

Yes! It was complicated. I got my rolls with white rice instead of white so the waitress ended up taking it back and we had to wait another 10 minutes.

Then my salmon came slathered in teriyaki sauce and it looked like they added more when I clearly stated sauce on the side.

What made this more frustrating is that every time the waitress came she kept saying 'I told the kitchen, but they messed up'. 

My question is that you are the one taking the order and should be looking at the dish before you bring it out to your table. That is the correct way of handling things... not complaining to your table that it's not your fault. 

Please take responsibility for your part in servicing your table. I've worked in the food industry before and this is just unacceptable.

The Mediterranean Sea Bass is divine! Started with the sides served with the dish. I have never tasted such delightful corn kernels & asparagus, that makes my tastebuds dance in ecstasy!

Now here's where I go off the beaten path, which makes me hesitant to award 4stars. The Lotus on Fire roll was inconsistent...

Returned a week later for a light meal, which consisted of the Lotus on Fire roll. It lack the rich flavor it had the first time it touched my palate.

Ok, I agree with everyone, the quality of the sushi is not high grade, but it's not gawd-awful. It did it's job for Happy Hour and I think that would be the ONLY time that I'd come here. Although they limit as to what is on their HH menu, there is a pretty nice selection and I was pretty happy with what I had. I had about 4 or 5 (?) Lychee drinks (alcoholic beverages that I can't remember for the life of me what they call them) and about 2-3 spicy tunas @ $2.50 or $3 each,... Man, I should try to stay sober so I can write these reviews accurately! Wth...

I've had a fair share of sushi and everywhere I go it's good.. but this place was REALLY good. The place itself it very beautiful and ritzy looking.. you would expect the prices to be really expensive but they're not at all. It was the three of us and it cost 55 bucks for a miso soup, 3 rolls, scallop appetizer, a sashimi sampler, and some cokes. Not too shabby!

our appetizer, the Crispy Scallop Arare ($9) was soooo good! They were dice-sized pieces of scallop lightly battered and fried with rice crackers.. and the best part was the spicy mayo to dip in. and get this, the spicy mayo.. was actually spicy. thank you kabuki. 

the sashimi plate ($9 wow) was also a big hit at my table. my faves were the shrimp, tuna, and yellowtail. fresh!! 

the rolls we got were the Spider Roll ($10), the Shrimp Tempura Roll($8), and the Sunkissed roll ($10)... they were all good. not too much rice, not shady on the sashimi, no imitation crab. yayy. 

If you're unsure of what to get.. get the items that has a red icon next to them. Those items are ""Chef Recommended"". Most of our items had this symbol!

Kim, our waitress, was very kind and accommodating to our needs. I ordered the Dynamite Roll along with some Salmon nigiri off the happy hour menu which was very good. I really like the Dynamite Roll here and one order was satisfying enough.

We also ordered hot sake (for a first-timer, I did not like it LOL), and then cold white rice sake which had a sweeter taste. I would recommend the cold sake for anyone who isn't a huge fan of hard liquor. Taking the hot sake was like a shot for me... had to down it and made a disgusting squinty face haha. But it was off the happy hour menu so worth the try :) The presentation of the cold sake was cool. It was given in a bucket of ice to keep cool.

The sashimi salad was also a great dish. This is a hit or miss for me because most restaurants seem to lack sashimi pieces. Maybe because we came during a slower hour, but they were generous with the sashimi pieces.

Happy hour has quite a few items to choose from and the prices range from $4 rolls to $7 apps. I usually eat light here for happy hour and come mainly to enjoy their ki bombs.

Denise was our server. She was very nice, and full of smiles. She took our drink order and even made some chocolate milk for my son, which was greatly appreciated.

MMMmmmMMmmm... so good.  

For lunch, i ordered  the ""Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll""(refer to pic). The roll was...okay. Nothing special.

All of which were delicious.  Each dish offering a flavor that really lights up your taste buds.  It's in a great location near Yogurtland and AMC theatres at town square.  If you're a sushi  connoisseur like myself, you will certainly enjoy the selection of rolls and the ambiance.

The sushi is good. The prices are average.  The eel sauce is excellent though, I wish they would put it under every roll they offer. A big plus is how they always give you edamame with your meal.

4612258,2013-01-24,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Kabuki is great at being good all-around, and helps narrow the gap between the casual/westernized and traditional Japanese food. It won't be the absolute best restaurant, but it's solid, and pretty fail-safe. The large menu caters to many tastes - the reasonable prices and large servings make for great, casual lunch specials, while the full-blown sushi menu will satisfy fish junkies too. There'll always be something for any mood.  

Well, for any of my friends' moods, at least. I have culinary tunnel-vision at Kabuki, and will only order specials that include their teriyaki chicken (which is delicious, and amazing, and delicious again), so I can't vouch for anything else myself, but so far, my companions have always seemed happy with their many different orders. In particular, they swear by the freshness of the tuna and salmon, they like the rolls, and we appreciate how even the smallest side dish is pretty good on its own. 

The staff is friendly and attentive, and service is very fast considering how busy it gets. The restaurant has excellent ambiance; it's classy enough for a dinner date, but casual enough that you could just drop by mid-day for some teriyaki chicken. No, seriously, it's sweet and moist and uncomplicated and all the things you want it to be, so go get some and be filled (big portions!) with happiness.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,0,0,4,l122XB-T3hzY2BtpZrjnzw

This place doesn't necessarily have the best sushi or traditional Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas, but it's pretty consistent with decent, enjoyable meals, moderate prices, and friendly staff. Most of the menu consists of average, typical Japanese food; however, I must give 5 stars to their Ramen.... they have 3 different kinds: the soy, spicy miso, and the char-sui... and all I can say is WOW. That is officially my meal nearly every time I go because other places in Vegas where it's claimed to have the ""best"" ramen in town (Monta or Anime Ramen), I personally believe are highly overrated!! The ramen in Kabuki in particular is fantastic, and I would prefer it over Monta or Anime's any day. 

I like to switch up the appetizers so that there's variety on the table, plus I can try something new every time. Their grilled calamari is yum! I tried some of my friend's seafood salad and it is a generous portion of fresh seafood variety. 

The people who work here are VERY nice, but they don't have much serving experience. It is easily seen that they don't know how to multi-task, and they always seem so flustered even when the restaurant isn't very busy. It may take a while for water to be refilled and it is rare for them to check on you during your meal more than once... Perhaps a full, thorough staff training is in order! The positive attitudes and hospitable traits in the staff are definitely there; they just need some pointers in service :)",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,2,0,3,JVR0gUEZK8P_5IBlmKXEqQ

Located in a prime location --Towne Square, this is the perfect place to end a day of shopping. While no shopping was involved on this particular day, my husband and I thought we would venture into Towne Square and see if we could get a table at Kabuki's. We only had to wait 15 minutes (on a Friday night) and while waiting, enjoyed a few drinks in the bar area. 
To my delight, they had Hamachi Kama which is the cheek of the fish both tasty and grilled just right. We also  ordered a half dozen of the Hamahama oysters, gyoza, several pairs of ahi, salmon, ikura (salmon roe), ama ebi, and a quail egg shooter ( a a raw quail egg in ponzu sauce). Everything tasted very fresh. I normally don't order any rolls as I just enjoy nigiri or sashimi, however there was one roll that caught my eye: the Geisha roll. Unfortunately, I had no room to add to my tummy so that will have to wait for my next visit which will happen very soon. Service was great, food was wonderful and atmosphere was nice, not too bright and not too dark. 
I am giving 4 stars as I have still not found a better sushi restaurant than Shiro's in Seattle. While the fish was fresh here at Kabuki's, it still did not have the melt-in-your-mouth experience as Shiro's. However, Kabuki's is at the top of my list here in Vegas for sushi.

Maybe it just paired well with the cold weather outside, but I hope they make it a staple item in their menu. The hot tea was also decent.

Our friends wanted to meet for Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm) and I figured, why not? While everyone else ordered several small bottles of House Sake (hot) -- Sho Chiku Bai Extra Dry ($3.95; H/H $1.95) and Sapporo (pitcher: $17.95; H/H $9.50 and tower: $23.95; H/H $12.50) for sake bombs, two of us shared the Kabuki Signature Sake Sangria -- fresh fruits, sake, shochu, grapefruit and cranberry juices ($24.95; H/H $18.95) which yielded 5-6 large glasses. 

For food, Ruben and I had two orders of Salmon Nigiri - which apparently they just call ""sushi"" ($4.25; H/H $2.95), two orders of Rose Roll -- shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber, and avocado ($9.95; H/H $6.95), and a Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll -- spicy tuna, tempura crumb, avocado and smelt roe ($7.95; H/H $5.95). Everything was really tasty. The salmon was so good, fresh, as I love how thick it was cut. Of the two specialty rolls, I really enjoyed the Rose Roll. Great flavor, nice balance of texture, and a little kick of spice. Also, the rolls are huge so you're definitely getting the value!

Service was great and everyone was really nice. Our server was awesome about letting us know when it was last call for Happy Hour. Also, everything arrived promptly even with them being pretty busy.

The Happy Hour prices are nice. It was the perfect way to try an a la carte sushi restaurant without breaking the bank. The fish quality was a pleasant surprise that instantly garnered respect. Not sure if I would pay the regular prices on the specialty rolls though. The selection is limited on the Happy Hour menu and there were many other intriguing rolls -- that weren't deep-fried or filled with cream cheese (pass on both) -- that I may want to try in the future.

So, based on my wonderful experience, I'd love to revisit and take advantage of their Happy Hours (Reverse Happy Hour is Mon-Thurs 9pm-closing and Sun 8pm-closing with similar menus).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,2,4,_6U3_-egx1G3IFKziSXHtg

The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated right away.  I ordered a salmon teriyaki lunch combo and hubby got the miso ramen.  Bleh.  Bland.  From the salmon to the tempura, nothing stood out.  It was kind of...tasteless.  Hubby's ramen was super salty.  What we had did not inspire me to try their sushi or really anything else. 

 And service?  Lackluster.  Despite the emptiness of the restaurant, she wasn't around much and you had to really flag her down if you wanted something.

4974492,2009-07-23,7,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Okay, I admit, I was hesitant at first with the idea of hitting up Kabuki.  But since I've been making my rounds for happy hour, I was told that I have to check this place out!

Their happy hour is Monday through Friday, from 3 pm to 6 pm; includes discounted drinks and food.

Drinks are hard to miss on their menu because it dominates the first few pages.

I started off with:

* Tokyo Mojitos ""Made from Asian Vodka ""Shochu"" and Sake"" (HH $4.95 / $7.95 reg), the Berry flavor.  When I took a sip, oh my goodness, wow!  This was one damn good mojito!  I had the Husband and another friend try it, and they were sold immediately!  The Husband got the Grapefruit variety, while our friend got a Berry one too.  I also tried the Lychee one later on.  I'm not usually a fan of fresh grapefruit, but it reminded me more of grapefruit soda and I liked it too, better than the Lychee one.

* Draft beer (Kirin Ichiban) (HH $1.95 / reg $3.50) - The guys did get beer to start, but soon moved on to mojitos!

I had planned on trying one of their Chu-Hi ""Made from Asian Vodka 'Shochu' with Refreshing Fruit Flavor"" drinks, specifically the Blueberry flavor (HH $4.95 / reg $6.95), but got stuck on the mojitos!  Oh well, next time!

Foodwise: 
I had to ask first, do they use sriracha in their hot sauce?  (I'm not a fan of it in my sushi.)  And thank goodness, no!  I was all aboard!

* Spicy Tuna Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $4.75) - My staple, as long as I like the hot sauce and I like it here.  Yum.

* Lotus on Fire Roll ""Spicy Tuna, Lotus Root, and Jalapeno on top of California roll"" (HH $5.95 / reg $9.95) - This was beautifully presented with a deep-fried lotus root sitting on each piece, complete with a jalapeno slice.  There's also some spicy crunchy things on one side and more hot sauce on the other side.  It's a pretty tasty roll with a lot of heat, so good that we ordered another roll!

* Salmon Skin Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $3.95) - Served with six pieces, the bonito flakes add a nice smokey taste to it.  It was good.

* Aladdin Roll ""Spicy Albacore and Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura"" (HH $5.95 / reg $7.95) - Another tasty roll with a bit less heat and a nice subtle crunch from the masago.

* Rose Roll (HH $5.95 / reg $8.95) ""Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura, A-Grade Avocado and Spicy Tuna"" - We're all liking the spicy tuna, so how could this go wrong?

Overall, we were all pleasantly surprised with the drinks and food offered, even at the happy hour.  Service was good, our waitress Briana, was always checking up on us and making sure we had enough food and drink.  We'd definitely go back for more happy hour action now!

They also have a Red Mask Club so you can earn points when you dine.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,14,11,4,zBNGH7D3Ri2mPmfAGvNrKA

5042192,2014-04-23,2,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"After a long day of shopping at Townsquare, a friend and I wanted to stop for a bite to eat. It was right around 4pm so we thought it would be a perfect opportunity for a ""Linner"" or ""Dunch."" The obvious meanings of those words, for those not in the know, is the hybrid of lunch and dinner. I tell you, any excuse to eat! LOL whatever the case, we were hungry so it was time to eat. Sushi is my all time favorite meal so Kabuki was the best option for us!

Kabuki has to be one of the first restaurants when Townsquare first opened. That alone, tells me they are doing just fine. This joint is located across the street from HM and right next to Yogurtland. When you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the hostess stand. You'll then notice a very hip and modern sushi restaurant. Glass walls are painted with Kanji letters and other Japanese artwork. Lots of random posts and walls to create mini intimate dining areas. Just like any reputable sushi restaurant, there's a sushi bar for your convenience as well.  We were sat right behind the hostess station, flushed up against a shelving unit filled with various types of Sake. Our server, Angie, was super sweet. She left us alone for most of the time, but still checked up on us when we needed it. The hostess, however, was a little bit disengaged. She wasn't as personable as I hoped it to be. I know at the end there was a taller hostess that was super sweet. The one I'm talking about was a little shorter, I'd say about 5'5"". Still, that didn't ruin my time. For my meal, I decided to get the following:

-Hamachi/Yellowtail Nigiri for $4.75: the hamachi was super creamy and fresh. I loved that they gave a larger fish portion for a nigiri. 

-Salmon Roll for $4.50: Salmon and cucumber rolled in rice and nori seaweed. I normally get the nigiri, but this was a great value for the price. For the roll, you get 6 cut pieces instead of 2 with the nigiri. The salmon was creamier than the hamachi and super flavorful. 

-Salmon Kama(Collar) for $7.95: Whenever I visit sushi restaurants, I ALWAYS get a kama. This cut of fish is super flaky, super marbleized, grilled and flavorful and the salmon was no different. The ponzu dipping sauce brought a salty and tangy element, elevating it to new heights. Highly recommend this if you've never tried it. 

The waiting time for our meals was super quick and the food was delicious. Those are reasons alone to come back time and time again. Townsquare is a place I frequent a lot, so Kabuki, watch out! I'll be back again soon. For now, thanks for the great time :)",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,2,4,bOysS-TjWGWwbsX54UXfig

The staff greets new customers in Japanese once you enter; a lot of them talk to each other in Japanese, which I thought was really cool just because you're transported into this foreign world in the middle of the Town Square Mall! 

Aside from having a pretty nice happy hour, every time I've been to Kabuki and ordered something I don't usually get, it has been a letdown. I ordered from the Vegetarian Menu, Spicy Tofu on Crispy Rice & Vegetable Ramen. It was just okay, the taste of everything was pretty bland. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the food is pretty good, but the flavors are nonexistent. 

If you plan on eating here, just eat at happy hour!

5067112,2012-07-02,4,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"In reality, this review should either be FOUR STARS or ONE.

Let me explain....

Over the last decade, restaurants have developed a new method of food delivery to the table.  I call this person the ""Food Bringer"".  This is the person you've never seen before who shows up 15 minutes after you've ordered from your waiter/waitress and puts your food in front of you.

Good restaurants pull this stunt off seamlessly.  They have to!  When you send a complete stranger to a guests table with their food you had better have a system in place to ensure food arrives at the correct table and is placed in front of the correct person.

Bad restaurants don't properly train the ""Food Bringer"".   The ""Food Bringer"" wanders out with trays of expensive Oriental food and just tosses it on the first table that looks hungry.

This is what happened to us tonight... at this location.

Side Note:  Our waitress, JULIE, was phenomenal.  Management: give her a raise as she's one of the reasons you didn't get a ONE star rating.

The ""Food Bringer"" came out bearing heaping amounts of delicious entrees and placed them haphazardly in front of my family.  Being the hill folk we are, my clan was all over this bounty like a pack of wolves on a three-legged cat.

Julie came rushing over and informed the ""Food Bringer"" of his mistake and he proceeded to load the food back onto the trays, turn 180 degrees to his right, and deliver the food to it's rightful owner.... the people sitting RIGHT next to us.

I'm a little confused at this point.  What's going on?  We arrived first and this ""looked"" like our meal.  It wasn't.  A different ""Food Bringer"" showed up with our correct meal and we managed to help him locate each meal's rightful owner.

One plate in the middle of the table stood out... It was a Tempura Shrimp and Veggie plate that should have gone next door but remained on our table and was being devoured by hungry children.

One more note... my Autistic son managed to grab the croutons from the salad put briefly on our table just prior to it being moved next door.

So, the couple next to us received a meal that was not only missing their Tempura order, but was sans two croutons from a now compromised salad.

Let's move on.

The tables are too small.  Period.  We ordered three entrees to share between four people.  There was NOT enough room for our food.  Plates were hanging precariously over the sides.  Also, in a nice restaurant, the tables should be adjusted daily to make sure they don't ""wobble"" back and forth.  Maybe that's what the chop-sticks are for?

The food?  Pure Heaven!  That's why this SHOULD be a four star review.  Had it not been for small, wobbly tables and untrained ""Food Bringers"", that's exactly what this restaurant would have received.

If I went back, I would not take my children (even though they liked the food) and stick to a twosome.  That would leave ample room on the table for the... FOOD!  Second, I would CHECK the table to make sure it's square with the floor. 

Tighten the screws Kabuki.  Your restaurant is beautiful and the food is fantastic.  Fix these issues and I'll amend this review.",RNKwQjJ3cKRUnsaTjB7NrQ,4,0,2,ngShiBE7zcutDT0lFAJZbg

Its a place where you can bring a date, family or just chill at the bar.  The interior design kinda suits all that.  The bartenders are very friendly and you can tell there are a lot of the same people that come to the bar because they all seem to know each other.

5329648,2009-01-18,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Did not enjoy this place. I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.

Came here with a larger group of people. Food came relatively quickly and menu seemed extensive enough with some good, unique and tried-and-true Japanese/sushi restaurant options. Sushi was fresh-tasting, but nothing groundbreaking. I must say that I really enjoyed the oyster shooter and am craving it right now--this was the only dish were presentation lacked pretentiousness, yet taste was superb. Rolls and nigiri was also above average in taste and freshness...

So, since I seemed to like the food just fine, why only 2 stars? Well, for atmosphere, service and prices, to say exactly. Prices were over-inflated considering the food is not the best out there. I've had better at hole-in-a-wall sushi places! Service was rude and often made inappropriate comments over certain food orders (like my ""unique"" oyster shooter). Service was also slow and not helpful by any means. At the end of the day I was overcharged on my credit card bill and had to dispute the charges with my credit card, since managers/servers were not helpful.

Atmosphere was too trendy for my liking--I don't like to go to a sushi place and feel like I'm in a club, it is not my thing. I want to enjoy my food and eat in peace with relatively timely service. I didn't get peace here. Oh no. It's hard to get peace and quiet when techno music is booming all around and tables are so close together that you can hear everything that is being said by your neighboring diners despite the annoying and loud techno-trance! Decor is very loud as well, but not in a good sense. It's a hodge-podge of ridiculously looking booths and pictures that go better with a club environment than a sushi place. 

This place scored a ""0"" for ethnicity, since there was nothing ethnic, Japanese about it. Even the food, although good, was largely Americanized. There was no Ikura (large caviar) even offered! Seaweed salad was not good and I had to ask waiter twice for a miso soup for him to even know if they served it/what it was.

I would not recommend this place. I do like Town Square experience, but I would go to countless other restaurants there before I went to Kabuki again.",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,0,0,2,Og9ZnuoovtaxBa9qBOtJJw

5360598,2011-12-31,2,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"This has got to be the worst service we've had, well, since Seafood Harbor Palace on Spring Mountain. This service was so horrible, that I have been so inclined to write my review mid-dining! Seriously, it will take me about 5 - 10 minutes to review this place, the same length of time it took for the server to acknowledge us, then handle 3 other tables that were closing checks, then finally arrive back at our table to take our order. No apologies. That's the stickler...service anywhere should come with manners.

And that was what first alerted me to wanting to review this place. The hostess was the first person we encountered with the lack of mannerism that comes with service. I think it pains her to smile. The poor woman could not even muster up a grin, and a courteous welcome, or even an apology for the wait.

The scene went something like this:

We walk in to an abandoned front counter, wait 2 minutes. Grimace, that's what we'll call her, shows herself and acknowledges us with: ""How many?"" (no greeting, no smile). Then she walks away to sit a previous guest. She then returns and asks us again, ""Did you say for 4?"" (no thank you for the wait, and did I mention NO SMILE?) Then finally, Grimace sits us. Oh yeah, and with her less than 10-word vocabulary, she doesn't bother to realize that we required kids' menus. Weird.

In short, poor customer service here. We will not dine here again. The single star is for the food...it was okay, just okay. You will definitely find better Japanese cuisine elsewhere. People who don't belong in customer service should not be working in this kind of establishment. There are far more people on this earth willing to work on a busy, money-making New Year's Eve with a better attitude.

5390448,2012-08-01,1,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Was going to be at Town Square last night to see the new LCD Soundsystem documentary (one word review inside a review:  AMAZING), and I'm not a huge fan of the Town Square dining options.   Kabuki has disappointed me in the past with what seemed to be generic plates of food synonymous with chain restaurants.   This was the perfect time for me to possibly experience a 2 star meal so that I could further expand my rating distributions which lean towards 3-5 star reviews.  PERFECT.

We started by trying the Sake Sangria as we'd been recommended it by a friend who knows how much we like the Bachi Burger Sake Sangria.   It got brought out in a giant carafe with a lot of fruit mixed throughout.  So far so good.   Tastewise?  Not even close, Bachi Burger's version blows it out of the water.   It had a strong flavor within it that didn't sit well with it.  At first I thought it was possibly overpowered with sake but my dining companion suggested that they thought it was the lemon peel.   I'm going to lean towards that being the origin of the flavor because after polishing off this gigantic monstrosity of a carafe, neither of us had a buzz.   What a deal for $24!  Strike one, but on the plus side, the 2 star review was already writing itself!

Things took a turn when the food started arriving, surprisingly enough to me.   First up was the garlic and sea salt edamame.   A bit overpriced at $5 I thought but the amount they provided as well as the deliciousness of it made it worth it.  The edamame was perfectly cooked and the sea salt and garlic mixed throughout was extremely tasty.  They also brought out an extra bowl of regular edamame, which they said was on the house.   Appreciated, but a little weird to me considering we'd ordered this giant plate of the other edamame.   None of the regular ones got eaten unfortunately.    Next up was the Niku Kushiyaki appetizer, a skewer of beef with shishito peppers.  I thought the meat was a tad overcooked but the flavors were nice, particularly when combined with the shishito and whatever sauce was on the plate with them.   A good choice for $6.  Yellowtail Carpaccio is a standard order for me at a sushi restaurant and this one didn't impress, but wasn't necessarily bad either.  My companion ordered the king crab miso soup which I tried a bit of and greatly enjoyed.  The crab was plentiful throughout and I thought it had a nice flavor that melded nicely with the standard miso.  Lastly I had the Sushi Omakase Special which had an assortment of nigiri with a California Roll and a bowl of regular miso soup.   I was quite impressed with the majority of the nigiri.   Most of the fish tasted fresh and were prepared well, and the california roll was... well, a california roll, but a good version nonetheless.  The only two downsides to the plate were the Krab nigiri, which tasted like the cheap imitation it is, and the eel, which is usually my favorite bite on a plate of Omakase, but this one didn't taste as tender as I'm used to, which I think was a sign it might not be as fresh.   All the other bites were great though and I cleaned my plate.

So I'm a little indifferent on how I feel.  On the one hand, now I still only have a handful of 1 and 2 star reviews, but on the other hand, I had a really nice meal!   It'd be a 4 star review if the Sake Sangria wasn't so disappointing and also if I hadnt had the mediocre meals I've had here in the past.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,3,lZ5yESnvqrE6nyFq4EwvOg

Their menu is extensive with lunch combos toward the back. You also get an order of edamame to snack on before your meal. I had the omakase deluxe combo (5 nigiri and 6 pieces of spicy tuna roll for $13.95) and a Vegas roll (deep fried salmon, crab, cream cheese, and avocado for $10.95). My wife had the Kabuki deluxe (chicken teriyaki, bbq beef ribs, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and 3 pcs California roll for $13.95). This was plenty of food for both of us. I had no issues with the sushi and I especially liked the beef ribs, they had a nice barbecued flavor and were tender.

 How many of you are tired of the same old restaurants you've constantly visited and are ready for a change? Well you are in the right place, I just so happen to be writing a review on the popular restaurant Kabuki.  For those of you that don't know what Kabuki is, it is a Japanese restaurant that serves exquisite sushi and other Japanese cuisines. There are multiple Kabuki restaurants located all over the United States and there are two located right here in Las Vegas! I have had Kabuki many times, as it is my favorite sushi restaurant and I just recently decided to visit again, but this time as a reviewer. Today I am going to review Kabuki's menu, their locations, and their atmosphere. 
 To some Kabuki's menu may seem a little over whelming as there is a variety of options to choose from, but I see their menu as appealing to everyone. Kabuki is known for their delicious sushi, but that is not all they have to offer. Kabuki is not just a sushi dining experience they also offer Japanese cuisine to help provide for everyone's wants and needs. Kabuki's menu of food is very easy to read and even shows some pictures of their food and their beautiful sushi rolls. Kabuki's menu also lists the prices for their food of course, and they are reasonable. The average prices range from anywhere of six dollars to thirty just depending on what you get. Not only does Kabuki provide an assorted menu of tasty looking food, but they also have great quality of food to show for it. Kabuki's sushi rolls are unique from other sushi places in Las Vegas and are well thought out; they have flavors and textures that compliment one and another. My favorite roll there is their spicy tuna crunch roll, it's slightly larger than average sushi rolls and is warmed up to wear it just melts in your mouth. Its contents contain spicy tuna, sushi grade rice, seaweed, cucumber, siracha mayo, and the outside of the roll has a certain breading to it giving it just the perfect amount of crunch. 
 Kabuki offers many locations in the United States including Nevada, Arizona, California, and Texas. There are currently two locations located in Nevada, one in Las Vegas and in Summerlin. Both of the Locations in Nevada are great spots for a restaurant! These two locations are easy to get to and are located in popular outdoor shopping malls making it a great spot to hangout out and grab something to eat after a long day of shopping. Unfortunately I have not yet been to the Summerlin location inside of Tavoli Village shopping center, but I have been to Tavoli Village and I do know it's a beautiful clean mall. I have however been to the Las Vegas Kabuki restaurant location located at Town Square. Town Square is easy accessible by being right off of the 215 freeway and is a fun hip outdoor shopping mall. You might think Kabuki would be hard to reach since it is inside of a mall, but it is not. Kabuki is on a corner of the mall making it easily accessible to people already shopping around the mall and it is also easily accessible to people just stopping by to chow down on some delicious Japanese cuisine. 
 The last thing I would like to share about Kabuki is their atmosphere. Kabuki's atmosphere can be simply summed up as laid back, but sophisticated. The inside of the Japanese restaurant is very clean and pleasant to eat in. I always feel very relaxed whenever I visit Kabuki and I can thank their perfectly dimmed lighting for that, making it just light enough to see where you're going and what you are eating. I also love Kabuki's restaurant color scheme, it is black and red making it very sleek and appealing. Kabuki's seating is also pleasing to the eye and is very comfortable making your meal even more enjoyable. A bonus, their bathrooms are always clean! Kabuki's atmosphere really goes above and beyond due to their amazing staff, as they generally do set the mood. From the second you walk into Kabuki you are greeted with kindness from the hostess waiting to seat you and the servers really make it an easy pleasurable time. I am always treated with respect from the servers in Kabuki and they are very amiable, they genially seem like they care. The servers never make you wait an outstanding time and periodically check up on you to see how you're doing and how the meal is. Another thing I really love about their servers is that they are never hard to flag down and whenever I need something it seems there always right there to assist me. Both the servers and the atmosphere make Kabuki a fun happy place to be at and they always have me coming back for more!
 Overall, Kabuki Japanese Restaurant gets a ten out of ten from me. After reading this review I hope I encouraged you to get out there and try Kabuki or if you have already tried it, I hope this review made you want to go back. I strongly believe this restaurant has all of the qualities to make it a great restaurant including its variety of foods on its menu along with its quality of food.",_Fgv4KxLohJcYojoiSj2pw,1,0,5,1V8bBSq6gfoxJV25cEc5mg

We ordered the tempura, and shishido peppers to start.  The tempura was very tasty, and the peppers were enjoyable, and pretty mild...until I ate a super sneaky extra spicy one.  My mouth was on fire for about 15 minutes.  I won't be ordering those again.  We also got two rolls- the Las Vegas, and the lobster roll.  I'm not usually a fan of the Las Vegas roll, but theirs was pretty good.  I was looking forward to the lobster roll, but it didn't have much flavor, and it was really messy.  I had to pick it up off the plate with both hands, and it was still falling apart.  
The cocktails we had were just okay too.  Lychee sake mojito was just sweet, and meh.  The sangria was enjoyable.  It was kind of grapefruity, and slightly bitter, but it had a unique taste to it.
I'd like to come again for happy hour, and try a few more things.  For now, I'm kind of on the fence about this place.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,1,3,6Sqlp9IuWetikXmJuu5ZPA
5526803,2017-02-13,1,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Not all sushi is equal, and if you enjoy specialty rolls you'll really want to do your research when selecting a sushi restaurant. We came here because we had picked up a friend at the airport, and were looking for lunch somewhere off-strip. This location is in Town Square.

The service was good and the staff was pleasant. We tried the garlic edamame and several of their specialty rolls. The edamame was good - a bit different from versions elsewhere. There were large pieces of garlic and what seemed like maybe almond slivers or something - it was crunchy. It was a nice contrast without being overly garlic in flavor.

The specialty rolls were all very good, although they were unique and not exactly what I would expect from a Japanese restaurant:

The Lobster Roll: 5 pieces of a California roll covered in big chunks of lobster in a sauce. The serving of lobster was generous, but I found the lobster to be a little chewy. I also found that the presentation made it difficult to get equal amounts of lobster on every serving. It tasted good, but I probably would not order this roll again.

The Lasagna Roll: 8 pieces of what I recall being a California roll, covered in mounds of cheese... yes cheese. Sounds strange I know, but this was amazing! I would order this over and over. It was listed on their specialty menu, so I am not certain that this is a year round offering. But it was probably our favorite roll. It was warm and creamy.

The Dragon Roll: I loved the tempura jalapenos on this! My friend worried that this roll would be too spicy for him (I happen to love spicy), but it was perfectly balanced and not too hot at all. The spicy tuna caked on top of the roll, with the addition of a little cream cheese was just the right amount to cool off any spiciness. I would order this again.

The Lava Roll: I am on the fence with how I feel about this roll. It had a good flavor, but it had tons of mushrooms and onion strings under clumps of mozzarella cheese. Definitely not what you'd expect with sushi, and although it tasted good, I don't think I'd order it again... it was A LOT of onions.

I do think I'll come back here, both because it's conveniently located, and because the service and food were both good. But there wasn't one stand out item we tried that will make me rush to come right back.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,5,3,4,ZKLrye59LjMZusJ-siD0VQ

Vegas food has consistency problems. BUT, i like Kabuki because the food quality is always the same, and its pretty good. The service on the other hand has hiccuped more than thrice... tonight was no exception. 

NOTE TO HOSTESS: if you're getting slammed and are short staffed, say so. if there are 5-6 open tables and you're not seating anybody, it is not because there are two couples waiting to be seated that there is a 20 minute wait, its because you're in the weeds and you might not know what to do in this situation because this might be your first job.... and that's cool. Just lose the attitude and help find solutions rather than spend energy trying to assign blame. 

Happy hour specials rock. quality of food is surprisingly good, but i do echo other reviewers in that the roll menu is a bit thin.

Ordered a couple of the usual. Calamari, BSCR.. the Calamari here is better than one in cali. The BSCR here tho is not as good.

It wasn't at my desired spiciness level, but the waitress left a bottle of ground chili to bring it to my liking. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but definitely wished there was a piece of char siu in it, or some kind of meat.
3. Sunkissed roll. Spicy tuna roll with salmon and avocado on top. This was my favorite dish of the meal. I am a huge fan of sashimi and fresh fish. The spicy tuna was okay, but what made me happy and brought me joy was the huge piece of fresh and tasty raw salmon atop the roll. Certainly some of the freshest salmon I've tasted.

A lot of items were different than what we have ordered before.
We decided to both order a dish they make instead of getting any sushi.
All I can say is the dish me and my husband ordered we did not like.It was like a seafood mixture which was like fried or something. The combination and flavor was not what we enjoyed.(Photo below) Not sure what it was called.

If we go back I think we need to try the sushi instead of what you order off the menu because a lot of the photos I have seen the sushi looks much better than what we had.
We may try it again sometime and I will update our experience then.

It's essentially a spicy California roll topped with crab and salsa drizzled with yum-yum sauce. Sounds a little weird I know but it the most unique blend of cuisine-Japanese and southwest. 

Now as for general service, it's usually crap. It takes forever for anything, mainly the check. There were many a times when I felt tempted to walk out because it was ridiculous to even get the server's attention. I did not do such a thing but if left unattended as such could cause problems, and we all know that hurts the restaurant.

Now, the reason I put four stars is because the other day a friend and I went and had the BEST service. I believe the server's name was Robert, but forgive me I am mistaken because he made our night! Super attentive, funny, and on his A game. Kabuki, this is who you want you wait staff model.

I can't go without saying the servers like Travis, Tim, Drew, Diane, and. Angie (Ok all the staff) have made this place feel like home but without the mess of washing dishes LOL!!!. Our favorite is getting Hamachi and salmon sashimi thin sliced. Will NEVER get tired of this place.",oGAhlTeBCwKplXGANlfrJA,0,0,5,pgFAb-Fh39UZ7uijZYFTGQ

The food was out of this world! 
We ordered Dynamite roll, I can truly say I am addicted to it. 
The Lotus Roll was very good! 
The atmosphere was nice.
 I would go back ASAP loved the place",lIpafobEWQO0cFYKYeyAsg,5,6,5,YNcU_rV9VJiitjL73nVxVA
5878859,2010-05-08,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Overall Kabuki is a pretty good sushi restaurant located smack dab in the middle of town square. They have an interesting array of rolls and uniforms alike!

Personally I enjoy the atmosphere and the wait staff more then I do the food which is a rarity for me. (Did that come out right? Oh well.... ) Anyway, that is not to say the food sucks, it's actually pretty good but just well overpriced. Actually more of Town Square priced is the best way to put it. 

Check it out during happy hour as they run some pretty good specials.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,1,1,3,uPzWp7tpkQ4rRe5lX-7TDw

Service: 5/5
The hostess and waitress were super friendly and attentive.

Price: 4/5
Lunch specials were all reasonably priced, all $10 - $15.

Kabuki Deluxe: 3.5/5
The Kabuki Deluxe ($13.95) was a super generous portion, with a little bit of everything. The chicken and beef were dry. Everything else was just okay.

Sushi Moriawase: 3.5/5
The Sushi Moriawase ($13.95) looks deceivingly small, but I left full just the same. The fish was dry, but otherwise everything else was okay.

Soft shell crab: 3/5
Super cute presentation. A single soft shell crab on a bed of grilled onions (like half an onion). It wasn't very good though. Eating this cute little soft shell crab was like putting a spoonful of peanut butter in your mouth -- coats your entire mouth with a single flavor (aka onion) and leaves your mouth feeling dry. I've had better at AYCE. 

Also, our food didn't come out at the same time, which isn't that big of a deal, but isn't preferred, nam sayin'? 

Overall: 3.5/5
I don't know how they managed to coordinate the chicken, beef, raw fish, and fried crab to be dry that day I came, but consider me impressed. The rest of the food was okay, while the service and lunch special prices redeem this place. I don't think this place is bad, I just think it's better when I'm not paying full price.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,5,4,5vnOkC-CYzaP-b9FCorQ2Q

This is usually a place we end up at spur of the moment, either on our way to the movies or taking a break from shopping.

5910729,2013-11-11,0,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Kabuki has decent food. Nothing worth driving across the city for, but we were in the area after going to the movies and I'm a member of the Red Mask club and I had a $15 credit for my birthday so we had dinner here tonight. Nothing exceptional except the speed of the sushi chefs. We were seated at the sushi bar because we were told there was a wait for tables (even though there were several open in the same area as the sushi bar, I guess they were claimed already). It took an exceptionally long time for our server to come back after delivering our drinks so that my dinner partner could order off the menu instead of directly from the sushi chefs, in the meantime my two rolls were already sitting in front of me. It was nice that the sushi was ready so fast but I still waited for my dinner partner to get his food so they sat untouched for quite some time. The food was good, and I'd come here again, but the overall service was slow and seemed uncoordinated.  Eventually we finished all of our food and drink and had to flag down the waiter to ask for the check, even though he had just been by to run our neighbors' check. Seemed somewhat inexperienced but weren't in a hurry so we still left a decent tip. OK food if you're in the area but nothing special.",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,1,0,3,uLQ2FjRDq4VG1IjIkRszFw
5918693,2011-08-24,3,O7ot_LMlCfLpOP9tBqeNfw,"Great location!
Nice interior and exterior decorations.
Reverse Happy Hour.

That pretty much covers the major highlights of Kabuki Japanese restaurant. The food served is okay to good, price is average, service is prompt and pleasant.  And even for weekday lunches, the place is still pretty busy (the restaurant has roughly 50% of their tables occupied). The fact that it is located conveniently near the Rave Motion Pictures, a plethora of shopping and other restaurants and bars undoubtedly contributed to the ongoing success of this national restaurant outpost.

If you are in the vicinity of Town Square and in the mood for some Japanese food before resuming your hunt for that perfect little black dress or that movie to start, I would totally recommend Kabuki.  Especially from 3-6pm on Monday to Friday (their regular happy hour), or their lunch hour (11am to 4pm daily).

Kabuki is also a great place to grab a bite before spending the rest of the evening getting your beer goggles on.  The reverse HH from 9pm until close (Monday-Thursday) and 8pm until close on Sundays makes Kabuki a happy place to start the evening.

The B.B.Q. Beef Ribs (Kalbi) is excellent here. Even though the portion is not particularly generous, the flavor and how it is grilled perfectly makes up for that.
Many of the sauces that accompanies the appetizers and entrees are tasty and compliments the overall dish.  The only item I would avoid is the tempura, as it looks like it was overfried and on the greasy side.

Location:  5/5 Love it!  If you regularly hang out in the southern portion of Las Vegas, this will be a convenient location for you.  It is not too far from Mandalay Bay, so if you are visiting Las Vegas and on that end of the Strip, it will not be too far to travel via a cab.

Service:  4/5  Prompt service, friendly staff.

Ambiance:  4/5  The bar area looks nice, the rest of the restaurant has a coherent theme to the design and decor.

Price:  3/5  Average for non-AYCE Japanese restaurants.

Food:  3.5/5  Tasty, but otherwise average for Japanese restaurants.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,5,4,pa4RjZ9_TD9qja55MBskVg

I'm not the best cook but if I were to attempt to make sushi, it would taste like this and the result wouldn't be so good. It's tasted like they rushed in making the food that they forgot how to make it taste good. However, our Server, David did a great job in checking up on our table to see if we needed anything. Thank you David!.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,1,1,3,ye9J0aQRg1nGJtGLznZ-rw

Needless to say, I sent back the rolls, and asked for the cheque. I did not want to make a fuss so I paid for what we ate, minus the rolls and left. 

Will not be returning, as even without the hair incident, the place wasnt a standout.",N7IW50jr40YocM-Z55hvFQ,0,0,2,ZNyLqUIamCfIcRmZrGVVvw

We always get way to much food.  The beer prices and saki prices for happy hour are hard to beat.  I honestly can't remember what I ate here but I've never been disappointed with any of it.  They have some kind of spicy ahi cakes that you spread onto fried wonton skins that we get every time.  Good price, nice portions.

We ordered the dish that you need two or more to order and it was so much food me and my husband could hardly finish !!! If your hungry and want good Japanese food the a is the place to go! Also prices are reasonably low considering the quality of food you get and not to mention it's right off the strip!,mV7i_dKGegLi-LxQaZLMPw,2,2,5,YsvlB_Pnye8VOYDwT-jEcg
