80029,2017-06-25,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,As a local I've been to the house of blues many times over the years but this particular night had me wondering if I'll ever go back again. About two months ago my friends band was playing in the restaurant area. I go to see the band and meet up with a group of friends. My friends had got there before me and already had dinner and a few rounds of drinks. I get there and meet my friends and say let's sit closer to the stage so we can see the band better and was told you can't sit right in front as that is a designated restaurant area. We were told to either sit where we were (in the back) or watch the band from the bar area (which is even further back from where we were sitting). Now I'm not sure who made up these 'rules' but it wasn't even that busy and there were plenty of tables in the restaurant for people to dine at. We waited for half a set to see if the front got busier and it didn't so we took it upon ourselves to just go ahead and sit up close in front. Well that action must have really upset management because we were not waited on for the rest of the night despite already eating and drinking up to that point. It seemed that the wait staff was told not to help our table and I found that quite petty and unprofessional. Even without getting waited on we still continued to buy drinks but we had to go to the bar instead. Why would you have bands play here if you're going to stick the people that came to see them in the back? Not impressed by any means.,gYkA_uR2KUNEYeLxvq-XaQ,1,0,1,82CVwztUZH4sENbh8t0ovg

175824,2013-04-21,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"After being on the strip for the day, I wanted something comfortable and laid back for my last nights stay at the Mandalay Bay. I wanted a few drinks and to listen to some live music. The hostess just glared at us going in. She made no attempt to make eye contact. She was more concerned with texting on her cell phone. The restaurant wasn't that busy but looked fun as it was a full band with karaoke.  I asked for a table for a party of two and she just pointed and said seat yourself anywhere. We sat for about 30 minutes as waiters kept walking by. We yelled trying to get their attention. Finally, after yelling and clapping my hands at the waiter at another table who had walked past me 4 times in the 30 minutes he said he would take our order. He made sure we knew he was working past his scheduled time. I even commented that I would sit another table so I could get someone to wait on me. I watched this poor waiter serve half the restaurant while the rest of the wait staff had their own small areas that they seem to service well. After watching this for about 30 minutes, watching the manager not take care of his employees and redeploy them to take back the floor, I approached him and told him what was going on. It was obvious that he wasn't going to jump in and take his front end back.  He set a very bad example chatting on his cell phone several times while on the floor. Anyway, after two drinks I had enough. I was really disappointed and will probably never return. Hopefully the general manager will look at the development of his team and provide some coaching to his wait staff and host at the door.

My favorite band in the world, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers plays there every Labor Day weekend each year. Each year for the last 5 we have reserved a VIP table for the show. Each year it was an awesome experience. You could get a bottle or bar tab. It was a set price, no fuss no muss and the service was always incredible. That was until last year and their new VIP Host Natalie. It was such a bad experience unfortunately we will not be attending this year. It breaks my heart to miss the show but I will not give them a dime as long as she is in charge. We booked a $750 package which gave us a table for 4 with a few bottles or a cash value bar package and supposedly access to the Foundation Room afterwards. So first of all there was a ton of confusion when we got to the venue. She had no idea what was going on. It was a ridiculous display of ineptitude. Honestly if she was a manager in one of my stores I would not hesitate to fire her. Not only does she not know what's going on but she's arguing with and yelling at security and the staff in front of patrons. By the time we finally got to our table there was a lot of confusion about this so called ""bar tab"". We were assured by her we had a certain amount we could order from the bar. So we went on with our night and our waitress was fantastic and the show was amazing as always. Skip to the end of the night and the chaos and misery ensues. We were careful to make sure we did not exceed our allotted amount of food and drink throughout the night yet we are presented with a bill for over $200! I have been a Vegas local for over a decade and am well versed in how table service is supposed to work. This was not it. She sat there and argued with us and each time she ""did the math"" she came up with a different number. Eventually she decided to discount the bill, but all she took off was the gratuity for our waitress. Not wanting her to get screwed because her boss was an idiot we payed the extra money for her and gave her some extra in cash directly. By far the worst experience I've ever had at HOB or any venue in Vegas for that matter. We have missed lot's of good shows this year and will not get to see Roger Clyne in Vegas until she is gone. This show sees a lot of the same people year over year and I have urged all of my friends locally and out of state to not order any table service at the HOB until she is gone. Please bring back the guy and girl that used to do it because Natalie is an idiot and scamming loyal customers.",gzqYSc_ax4HHOsxe6uf9ZQ,2,0,1,_PZylVEsb5T0KKsvk8Pkjw

This dinner was the worst dinner I have ever had. They took 40 minutes to get our food out and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The amount of time it took them to get the food out was ridiculous considering of the quality of the food. My burger tasted like the angus burgers you can buy at Sams Club that are microwaveable and my fries were plain, soggy and some parts of them weren't even cooked and tasted like I was just biting into a potato.

Most of us had burgers, quesadillas, or similar fare. We were all happy with the food- it wasn't fantastic, but good enough to make me feel like I got a decent bang for my buck. The downside was the service- our server was very busy and didn't pay a lot of attention to us. 

The upside of the place was definitely the atmosphere. The ambiance differs from most Vegas restaurants and even the inside of the place looks just as cool as the outside.

My wife and daughters ordered flat bread pizza which was comparable to a flat bread pizza at BJs. I order a turkey burger which was full of flavor and surprisingly juicy. I also order a 16oz can of Oscar Blues Pale Ale.  Having the can was perfect because I was able to take it with me when I left. 

The highlight of the dinner was the live music. Tony (unknown last) was the artist's name.  He was great.

399949,2007-06-01,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"OK. This is a karaoke review. This is just  for the HOB Rock Star  ""karaoke"" night. Monday nights.

If you are a karaoke addict AND you happen to be in Vegas in the *quieter* part of the week (Monday), you gotta try this one! It's ""karaoke"" in the sense that you have a monitor that scrolls the lyrics for you to sing. But your accompaniment is *not* a CD soundtrack, it's a live punk rock band! (a guitar player, bass player, and a drummer-- and they're pretty good too). 

You stand on the 4 foot stage or the 8 foot stage (depending on if you're in the upstairs or downstairs room that night) with real spot lights, smoke and fog machines, and guys who really know what they're doing running the giant House of Blues sound panel to make you sound better than you ever thought possible. 

There's been a lively crowd despite the late hours each time I've gone.

Down side is a limited song selection and they can't do key changes up or down from the standard version of any song, but you should be able to find one or two songs in your range, then you can go ascend the stage and be a rock star singing on the very same spot where some pampered *millionaire* rock star sang the night before (or even the hour before) in the House of Blues!

It's definitely a different experience doing ""Copacabana"" with a punk rock drummer...but it works just fine! (in fact a little more spirited than usual) The night I did that I got a roomfull of real-estate conventioneers bouncing around the place in a conga line. Stuck around for a while to listen to the others. Everyone was sounding pretty good that night. Despite their intimidating punk appearance the band is really good at vocally backing singers who hit a patch of song that they have trouble carrying.",s3M9vUXbmzCGmSbW-HlzIQ,3,3,5,efVrWMefE1SS2CT2thnFCQ

598610,2011-12-01,1,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"The Crossroads at House of Blues is one of the better casual dining experiences on the Mandalay Property.  The overall experience rates as average to slightly better than average when compared to similar options in Vegas, but the good kind of average where you won't find yourself too disappointed by the experience...only wishing that it was a little better.  It's not ""on"" the Strip, but with fair prices and decent sized portions, it's not a bad place to grab a meal/snack and some drinks.

I have eaten at the House of Blues (Crossroads not the Foundation Room) twice, most recently in late 2010.  It's one of those places where the food is ok for the price and you don't have to worry about much going wrong - nothing excellent but nothing bad.  This is just my opinion, but as far as Resort on-property food options go, the House of Blues is a decent casual-affordable destination: not in the top tier but certainly not at the bottom.  I think the place is understaffed or lacks proper management, but if you can avoid going when the crowds are in, you will improve your experience exponentially.  

Items I have tried include: quesadilla, jambalaya, ribs, burger, kid's pizza, and assorted appetizers and sides.  Overall, the food is average: not great but not bad.  The burgers had nice toppings (could have been put together better) and good flavor.  The ribs were a bit interesting: I appreciated the Cajun attempt but some in my group didn't like it.  Aside from this minor or major taste distraction, the ribs were also a bit dry.  The jambalaya was bland and the pieces of meat ranged from good to rubbery.  The restaurant appears to suffer from a little lack of effort or quality control.  Despite these less than flattering comments, the basic menu items aren't bad and can easily be improved with a little BBQ sauce or hot sauce.  

Most people will visit because of the House of Blues ""thing"" but you'll also see your share of Mandalay guests who've never even heard of the franchise.  If you're coming with kids or seniors, I suggest you come during lunch or have an early dinner because it does get crowded during the weekends and during events.  I think it's too loud and dark for kids and most seniors, but the restaurant isn't exactly aiming for that demographic.  Both of my visits were during non-peak hours (less than 15 diners in the restaurant) and I found the service to be efficient.  Our server came by and got everything we needed, but it wasn't what you would call ""friendly"" service...YMMV.

 There are a lot of casual dining options, and despite not being perfect, the House of Blues does offer Mandalay guests a nice alternative to fine dining and fast food.  The experience ranges from ""hip night spot"" to ""dead during the day"" so plan your visit according to your expectations.  There are places with worse service and worse food, so for the category that it's competing in (casual resort property dining) - I think the House of Blues is ok as long as you stick with the basics like burgers and sandwiches.  It's a solid 3 stars when compared to others in the category, but can easily be improved upon with better management and improvements to the recipes/cooking.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,1,3,Pt6DJQRKaWJMpGXmwjhmSw

My wife and I recently attended the Anthrax show on January 22nd 2012.  The tickets were $29 50 each plus a $10.00 convenience from Ticketmaster for this general admission show.  

This was my first HOB show but I do know they have some seating and tables which we were hoping to arrive in time to get one since our old bones just can't withstand the brutality of the pit like we did in the old days.  Anyway, come to find out all of the surrounding tables were reserved only.  $200.00 for the table that included a bottle of Sky Vodka and only (4) metal heads per table.  Really...$200 table at a Anthrax show?  Ok, fine if you think that is worth it.  

Now here comes the main reason for my review.  The upper seating deck was available but closed off.  We were told that it would open soon when the floor got packed.  After the first act finished sure enough it opened up but there was a charge.  What???  $10.00 more per person to sit in the upper deck seating.  Come on HOB!  We already paid to be in the venue and hardly anybody went upstairs.  As if you weren't making enough money on the bar you had to stick it to me one more time.  My complaint is if your going to charge extra for seating then do it in the advertisement for the show.  I'll pay for it.  Don't call it general admission then charge extra to sit down in the venue.

In the end I guess I should be grateful I wasn't charged $5.00 for leaning on the wall.",EPUgGpMZPPeQ0EcYeQFQBw,0,0,1,VVWc8ZUuTyDSqxkpLHuQew

Reason for 3 star is it is hard to rate here for the concert a five star yet the minimal food menu they offer gets a ONE STAR. One star for offering bland food.  We were not thrilled with the menu and opted to get the lobster sandwich with fries for $20+ each. IT IS BIG BREAD with a dab of their BLAND lobster salad. Literally no flavor and merely all bread. WORST offering of food at a high price I have ever experienced!! Serve the best quality options or don't bother. 

It hurt to even show 3 stars on this review because if I am rating the FOOD, IT IS ONE STAR!

The venue it a bit intimate with its setup, that you can be up close. Its not really big, so crowd is together for it. Sound and lighting are both good. Drink Prices are usually average strip prices, $13 for a tall boy of Guinness extra stout isn't to bad in my book.

A venue should always have a clear line of sight to the stage. In this place, there are HUGE pillars that surround the main floor, so if you're on the other side, you're screwed. They also EXTREMELY oversell the place. When a concert is sold out, it's packed as tight as can be...yeah, you may think every general admission concert is like that right? Wrong. You have to take stairs down to actually get in the venue, and when it's full, there's people standing up the stairs. When the Joint at the Hard Rock has a sold out show, there's still plenty of room to get reasonably close to the stage, and still have room to breathe. I've never sat in the balcony, so I can't comment on that. But bottom line, if it's not sold out, ok, if it is, just stay home and don't bother.

The good was complete five star occasion, we had an appetizer which was the shrimp and chicken for lunch. The food was awesome: well prepared, solid portions, and really good price. The service was five stars, we had a waiter and even the manager dropped over to say hello.

1049571,2012-04-26,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"About 13 months ago I was excited to go across the country for my second Maryland Deathfest in Baltimore, MD. The line up was already stacked and it seemed like it could not get any better with bands like Impaled Nazarene, Inquisition, Doom, Cathedral, Cianide, Repugnant, and Goatsnake. I have to admit Goatsnake was a huge reason I decide to go again. Due to some issues they were unable to make the fest and I was bummed. Then the fest organizers announced that they would have a replacement band within a couple days. To every ones amazement they added Ghost. 

This made perfect sense seeing that the Death/Thrash Metal band Repugnant was preforming as well. A little side note, Ghost is Repugnant. If you doubt this, check out the Swedish Indie Rock band Subvision, also the same vocalist. With Repugnant playing during Sunday afternoon, it was only right for Ghost to close out MDF 9. They took the stage early Monday morning right after midnight absolutely killed it. 

Fast forward 13 months they added a Las Vegas date to their second U.S. tour since May last year. 

Traffic on the way to Mandalay Bay was crazy. After downing a few beers and some green in the parking garage we literally got their just in time for the show which started at 6:30 PM. The place was already packed and 24oz cans of beer were $12. Ghost's performance was amazing. They definitely put on a show with the whole band dressed in black cloaks and good ole Papa Emeritus in his satanic pope outfit. The set was only about 35 mins but they covered most songs from their debut album. It was pretty clear that everyone come out for the Ghost. The other two bands didn't receive the same reaction from the audience and were quite boring in my opinion. 

I hope they return with a headlining tour because 35 mins was just not enough. In Maryland they played everything to their name including a chilling cover of the Beatles's Here Comes the Sun.

We were up front right in front of the stage. This was my first time being there. I was about 15 to 20 minutes late since the concert started right at 6pm. The opening act was the ""2AM"" group. They were a bunch of young handsome men performing on stage, but I was too busy looking for my friend and her friend that she brought with her. We had a blast standing right in front of the stage to where we could reach out if the performers reached out. As I finally find my friend, the guy band was just finishing up. She said she was upset because I had my camera and didn't take any pics of the guys.. I was tooooo busy looking for her. Then we waited for a short period for the ""Wonder Girls"" to come out. At that time, I had to ask the security guard if it was ok to go down the stairs in front of him to be with my friend. He was kind enough to let me go. I took his pic later but it was tooo blurry!!!

I loved how they placed all the items individually on the plate so you could remove the items you didn't want like the bleu cheese. It was really appetizing and delicious. The chicken wings were great! Not to spicy but had just enough of a little kick. The problem with the chicken wings was the size. They served them whole and were not cut up individually into a breast, wing, and thigh. It was totally messy!

We chose Kansas City BBQ sauce for the wings, as it allowed only one choice of sauce for 8 wings.

But boy was the sauce thick, it was deceiving because the actual wings was quite small and very little meat.

At most venues, doors open about an hour before the scheduled start of the show.  I don't know about other acts, but they always do doors for Panther only 30 minutes before the scheduled start of the show, so doors aren't until 11:00 p.m., for Panther.  There is no reason to get there before 11:00 and no reason to line up.  We usually chill and get drinks at the casino bar across from the HOB and stroll right in when the line is gone.  Panther tends to go on a little late anyway.

- concert was only half full. Not crowded.
- got reserved seats at the balcony, or upstairs, whatever you want to call it.  If you like standing in the pit, then get General Admission tickets.
- I had the first seat, on the first row.  What does that mean? It means I was 4 feet away from 15 feet height speakers!  My ears survived!  And I could dance in the space and hold on to the railings.
- my first stay at Delano was a big plus! Highly recommend booking a room at Delano or Mandalay Bay...  you won't need to drive if you happen to get wasted.

1. The food - it is yummy Southern home cooking - from the waffles to the made-to-order omelet station to prime rib to huge already peeled shrimp. The coffee is good as well as the mimosas.  The bread pudding was to die for - and there were plenty of salads, sides and I really loved the Mac and Cheese.

2. The music - it is unbelievable - the energy, the love, the power. It inspires me and I didn't want it to end. The show is interactive and you just want to get up and dance.

3. The atmosphere - you can carry on a conversation and still enjoy the music. You do sit family style and meet some very nice people. Com'n it is like going to church - you really don't need your own table.

Now the glitches:
1. Seating - originally I was seated at a table designed for 2 which had 2 additional chairs added to make it seating for 4. Once the drinks were brought, I knew I would be eating off my lap. I did look around and saw some empty seating (this was 1:30 so everyone had been admitted) and they did move me. However, seating for 2 is seating for 2 - at $40 a person, who wants to eat holding their plate or off their lap.

2.Service - now this is not the servers' fault - everyone was moving - more help is needed. I had to have my friend go to the bar to get our refills and the plates stacked up at our table of 8. Again, I am not faulting the staff - HOB - you need to add a few more - even part-time.

3. The Wait - be prepared to wait with long lines. I loved the waffles but it was truly the longest wait I ever had for waffles. 

I would still go back - I did give it 4 stars - but be prepared for long lines and see about sitting on the main floor instead of the second level.",BE-GULNj8SAZmrK79da48Q,1,1,4,STkms7s_RALc2q0ZjaO7zA

It's $50 for a buffet brunch (with ""southern food"") and a 45 minute gospel show. The food is just ok - plentiful, but lacking in flavor and, well, soul. Most of what I sampled (including egg dishes, fried chicken, roasted pork and salad) was blah. The two standout dishes were cheese grits and - would you believe it? - a rice krispy treat, and I can make both of those at home! The price includes all-you-can-drink mimosas and bloody marys, but they're watered down.

As for the entertainment, that's the real reason I wanted to go here - I love gospel music. The performers are talented, but the acoustics in House of  Blues are TERRIBLE! We had to move from our table on the lower level to the balcony, just to be able to understand half of what they were singing. The music is way too loud and the singers are shouting, and yet you still can't hear them. The balcony was marginally better, but even then the quality just wasn't there.

I thought this place was just ok. We did not eat anything the whole day so by 5 o'clock we just wanted to eat something. That and $5 happy hour sounded good.  We shared their happy hour appitizers and I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Their appitizers tasted like appitizers you could find at Applebees, good but not spectacular. Their pulled pork sandwich was ok. The meat tasted good, but their sauce was too sweet for me. I like my sauce spicy.

My girlfriend and I consumed two pounds of wings without any help from our husbands. yikes! Yes, they were good. We initially had ordered 1 plate of wings and a spinach dip appetizer. The spinach dip was so bad. No one even took a second bite. Even though it would have only been $5 gone to waste we had to send it back because we were at a tiny little cocktail table and it was taking up too much space. I have to say, I have never seen a restaurant so cool about a patron sending something back. It was almost embarrassing how apologetic and attentive they were from that moment forward. They asked us what we wanted to replace is with. That's when the 2nd plate of wings came in. : / Three people came to check on us several times throughout the rest of our time there.

It's not a place that I would have chose, but this was a group situation.  We had a side room for our group of 12+ and the service was okay, not great.  Being in any side room, it's hard to flag down your waiter or waitress if you need something.  My main complaint is that I ordered the Yummy Chicken and it wasn't yummy.  :-(  It was really spicy and that wasn't in the menu description.  I probably should have ordered a burger or sandwich, but I wanted an entree for dinner.  i would have sent it back if I wasn't with a big group.  I just didn't want to make a big deal of it, so my man shared some of his food with me which was just okay.  I'm sad to see that it's Chef Aaron Sanchez running this restaurant because I like him on TV.

STEEL PANTHER:  Fun overall, but we didn't like the opening band that night at all.  The opener took way too long and I didn't know that Steel Panther's actual show would be so looooong.  Our group of friends at the show (maybe 10 of us?), only 4 of us made it to the end of the show.  I know, we're getting old (in our 30s)... but the show was kind of dragged out.  The venue was good, but the drinks were expensive.  I don't think I would want to see another show here.

The host got us a seat at the bar because we where short on time (Micheal Jackson One tickets). Eventually Jason was our bartender. I say eventually because he had to come from the other side of the bar when he noticed us failing epicly to get the attention of Jillian, the bartender working right in front of us avoiding eye contact at all cost. Jason was attentive and friendly. Everything Jillian was not. My wife tried to get her attention 5 times with no response. I assumed it was loud and my wife doesn't have a commanding voice. So I tried twice before she just walked away. My voice is very commanding.  She didn't speak to us until we where almost complete with our meal. I think the reason was because her name was on the ticket and she thought she was getting a tip... Haha not this guy. I tipped Jason in cash. 

The dinner ended with Jason talking to the manager to provide me with a 25% military discount on my meal. Overall a great experience. Jillian should probably find a different occupation if being friendly is not something she likes to do.

I have to share that this was an excellent customer experience.  I say this because every staff member from the gift shop, those directing the crowd to the box office were friendly with the right attitudes and helpful in every way.  

Regardless of where you are seated, you get a decent view and concert experience.  I was seated in the balcony on the far right side close to the wall.  Clever and conveniently, both sides of the ""basement"" concert area are flanked by cocktail bars.  I didn't have to walk all the way downstairs to order my drinks.
I was just a few feet away.  
   
Husband and I came here to listen to the smooth sounds of Santana (which by the way had phenomenal bass, guitar and drum performances). I had a customer service issue with Ticketmaster while being on hold forever.  It was so easy to call HOB and actually reach a human being rather than being subjected to another annoying automated call with prompts leading you to nowhere.  I was connected right away to Howard at the ticketing office.

Everything was lukewarm or ice cold, including a brand new tray of chicken for the chicken & waffles. He just put it down and I went straight to my table after grabbing some and it was cold! 

Biscuits & gravy, Mac n cheese, bacon & ribs were lukewarm as well. Salad was seasoned well but not fresh.

The bread pudding was warm but the sauce for it was pretty much empty. 

The omelet station was the winner (it was hot). You grab the ingredients and place them in a little cup & give it to the omelet guys. They were an awesome team (cleaning the station while the other adds the eggs to the pan) and had my omelet made in no time.

The gospel itself was fantastic! Their voices were beautiful & the lead (Patti) was very energetic and wonderful at keeping the crowds attention.

I give a 1 star for the overall quality of food, it was far too cold. I feel like the health department should stop by, my mother and I  did not feel safe eating the food and were worried we might get sick later (neither of us did). That's just not a feeling one should have after eating. The banquet department at the hotel might be able to give you some tips on how to keep food warm and refreshing the salad as it runs low instead of making a big plate of it and letting it sit & get soggy would help. Things running out (like the bread pudding sauce) is not acceptable. These are all things that should be taken care of, not something for people to put in reviews.

The coffee was lukewarm, we even noticed other tables sending coffee back. Making the coffee at time of show instead of 30 minutes or 1 hour prior to show time would fix this.

I give five stars for the gospel. Wonderful, uplifting and fun.

Stay away from Table Fourteen, there's a fan right above it, which turns already lukewarm food to ice cold in minutes. The tables could be spaced a little more apart. From table 14 & the table to its right it was too close, I had an inner seat and when I went to get more food I disturbed the guest next to me to get out (she had to stop eating and get up so I could pass).

I have no complaints about the bussers, there was always someone clearing the tables and no plates were stacked on our table at any one time.

My jambalaya portion was frankly insulting for the 18.99 I paid for it and not that great.  I have never ordered Jambalaya and not had some to take home, but I literally could have finished the portion in 3 minutes had I been really hungry, and it was no where near as good most other Jambalayas I have eaten.  When the manager came over to ask how everything was, big mistake, the honesty flew, he then tried to say that the menu was created by world renown chef Aaron Sanchez like that was going to magically make my portion bigger and the food taste better, I've met Aaron and if that Jambalaya is really how it should have tasted then I flat out dont think hes that great of a chef, but I doubt thats the case.  in the end our server did take the ribs off the ticket and our server was awesome and so was the band that was on stage.

The House of Blues is best known for being a concert hall, but you can get a bite to eat or down a few cold ones all the same.  I've seen Boogie Nights (a bitchin' 70's cover band) here and it was a blast.  The floor is spacious and can accomodate hundreds.  Opposite the stage is a bar and a couple of levels for people to hand out and watch if they don't want to be in the middle of the crowd.  However, some of the watching space, especially right in the middle in front of the bar, is for VIP seating.  Drinks are typical Vegas pricing.  You are inside the Mandalay Bay after all.

On a separate occasion I grabbed lunch at the restaurant.  It's in a portion totally apart from the concert hall.  Mix of booth and table seating.  I got a burger and beer.  Quality of food and service is good, but nothing extraordinary.  Set me back around 15 bucks, so you're not breaking the bank by any means.

There are 3 bars on the main floor and 2 bars on the second floor on opposing sides. The acoustics here are good. I like them more than at The Joint. The sound is always spot on. I've yet to go to a show here with bad sound. I enjoy the view from the top as much as being on the floor and it's not as loud lol.  There's a decent size floor area. I like how intimate it feels. 
Their drink prices are why they get the 4. They aren't that affordable especially if you're trying to drink spirits. They'll typically have tall boys that make you ask yourself what you're thinking spending so much for beer in a can but it's that or stand there drink free the entire night and no one wants that. 
The workers, like security, are always chill and pretty laid back but straight forward; never a bother unless you deserve it.

They let people enter in groups of 30-50, then would wait 5 minutes and let more in... i guess this was to help crowd control.

We asked for a coke that we never received and they would bring by small water pitchers that filled 2 glasses and then come back with another 20 minutes later so water was not always refilled. I also thought $10 for a bloody mary with the price of the ticket was a little much. Tables are also very close. Take one table out and then it would have been fantastic.

When we arrived to partake in pre-show adult beverages, we ran smack dab into what appeared to be a full TSA screening of guests.  There was plenty of uniformed security with metal detection wands to ensure nobody got shanked at the show.  Cool.  Just make it snappy and don't hold me up too long. 
             
Inside, there's a good sized main bar on the lower level, which does the trick.  Expect to pay a fair amount for your cocktails.  If you want apps, there isn't much to get excited about.  One of the offerings was a Caesar Salad, which I found odd and galactically uninviting.  Just bring a couple of portable snacks with you, providing they pass through the security shake-down.
  
We had seats in section 206, which is located on the second floor.  Most of the seats had a nice view, and once the band started playing there's was a fair amount of unregulated seat hopping by guests.  The venue itself is large enough to pack some people into, but small enough to feel somewhat intimate, depending upon your seating assignment.  

There was cocktail waitress service on the second floor, but they did a poor job (and seemed disinterested).  I ended up making a few runs downstairs to the main bar to pick up my drinks.  I was excited to find they serve several varieties of Tall Boys (which makes for fewer trips to the bar, nest pas?)  

The lead in band, which warmed up the crowd was a local Las Vegas band, ""Franky Perez and The Truth.""  If you're from Las Vegas, you'll probably know Franky.  He's one bad ass entertainer.  He really grabs your attention and puts on a show.  His band was actually better than the main event ""Super Group.""  I liked the HOB venue, and would easily consider going back for a show there.

1676498,2018-06-17,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"AVOID. This venue was not designed for the shows that HOB is presenting. First, you go through a weird security line and scanning in the middle of the casino. Next, you walk down a bunch (two floors) of stairs to get into HOB. After that, you walk into what is basically a bar/restaurant with a dance floor. There are multiple staircases, and I hate to think about what would happen if a fire broke out. I didn't see any mobility impaired options.
Important- don't EVER get GA tickets. Go VIP(ay), or not at all. HOB ropes off every single place to sit, many which are in awkward places for this setup (example- directly across from the long bar, which messes up walking traffic by limiting the space). At the front, there is even a dedicated ""upgrade to VIP"" standing desk (in place of a hostess desk). I would think that this setup would affect the ""maximum capacity"" limit, since so many GA people are jammed into less than 1/2 of the venue, but I guess the numbers (people per square foot) end up looking the same. But, it seems unsafe.
Last night, the Dan Band show was supposed to start at 7:30, but the opening act didn't even begin until around 8:30. Long wait. The stage was also too small for the Dan Band to do a lot of their act. Basically, there was no room for cool props at HOB, so there weren't any. Sad.

The stage and venue is quite small, but it's perfect! I can imagine seeing a big-name act (bigger than Steel Panther) and really enjoying the intimate vibe.

Be prepared unless you are receiving some sort of VIP treatment,  to wait in line for a bit before you roll in into joint.  The layers of employees you contact until you make entry are friendly enough.  If you can make it in early and can build a brief rapport with the bartenders you will be better off as things get busier the less they seem to care. Your going to pay for a buzz..help it along prior to making entry.  

Some of the bouncers take comfort in their positions only and have no idea about combining their girth with customer service.  On a street corner or in any other setting...a large dude that does not smile after salutations or small talk is a dick. Trust me... I know what being a large and sometimes FAT man is all about.

Did not pass go or collect 200 - went straight to the floor area right near the stage and pretty much had an awesome view of the stage for the whole show. Was told by the box office employee earlier that a line usually starts about an hour before doors open. Sure enough there were already 20 people in line when we showed up. Billy Idol had already done a few weeks of shows in residency so all the bugs were worked out and the show itself was flawless other than a faulty mic. Place can hold a few thousand and after all the added Dickheadmaster (or whoever) fees it's just a little under hundred. Other seating costs more. You do the number crunch.

Maybe it was also because being emo and scene wasn't that big during my high school years, but the venue wasn't full of high school teens who think the world revolves around them.

With not a whole lot of bar area seating we squeezed ourselves into a couple booths as close to the bar as possible.

Here I rock out with the wife in a totally cool concert hall and I still got enough for the booze. The last act I caught here was Satriani and dude was I blown away! Ok now the food is the usual fair but not the generic casino food you always see. Wings are hot served with slaw and bleu cheese. Pepperoni Pizza's are crisp. Smokehouse Burger with Bacon is my usual choice cause with the burgers they load the fries. They also put together a pretty good rib platter. Ceaser salad with Salmon was nicely put together. Gumbo was flavorful and filled with sausage and shredded chicken. So if your down for the type of food that goes great with loud live music and I say this cause there is always some band or act playing on the main stage then your in for a treat. The Bread Pudding is what the wife likes. Servers here are simply the most down to earth people you'll ever meet. Amongst the chaos of live music she was able to keep our order totally straight with a smile to die for. Party of six. I don't  mention names in my reviews but if you get the sweetest red hair lady you will agree. Since you read this far here the secret tip, the happy hour is the best time cause its half off all the appetizers.

On both occasions that my friends and I came for lunch, the service was horrible.  The first time was sitting in the bar area, which I've learned from working in restaurants that the service is generally much faster and better in the bar.  This was not the case.  Group of four and two meals came out, then twenty minutes later, the other two.  The bartender was cool about it, and told me to come back tomorrow, he would comp a beer when I returned.  Nice right.....  Yeah, don't trust a part time bartender...  Never happened, and I didn't feel the need to argue over a beer, just let it go. 

Don't get me wrong the food is really AMAZEBALLS!  Just the service took this place completely off of my list for next years conference, and judging by the reviews I'm guessing that I'm not the only one. I can get amazing food from many places in Las Vegas.  

So during the second ""redemption"" visit, the waitress, you could tell was new.  Which was fine, and frankly I felt she did ok, but again the service was very slow, and the food took way too long to hit the table.  We sat for about 45 minutes. P.S. I promise, our group did not complain or act rude.  We were just enjoying the last day together with each other. Also, if you look at most of my other reviews I'm probably a little too kind when it comes to ratings.

By the end of the meal, the ""Supervisor"" came over to ask how things were.  I filled him in on the slow service, and how I understood running a restaurant is hard work.  Also, told him about the promised beer, and the food lag time.  All he did was give a couple of excuses and talk about this Awesome night club that was connected to the House of Blues.  If the Douche really knew about the business he would have seen four empty drinks and tried to salvage the service, instead of talking about a Bombtastic night club.  He also stated that we would be receiving some tickets for the night club from our waitress, which never came.  

Two promises that the House of Blues committed too, and two failures.  Sorry that we had this experience.  I'm sure they are probably off our list for next year, which is really sad for me.

I haven't been to any House of Blues in quite a while, and this was definitely my first time at this one. The venue is pretty awesome.

1949075,2012-12-22,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"This was a great venue to view a live concert, especially since they still have reserved seating, something that has all but disappeared from smaller music venues.  I like the property, I like the staff, the acoustics were great and it was a pleasant experience.  I do have a caveat for those attending shows there however- particularly people who buy their tickets online at Live Nation or Ticketmaster with the intent of printing their tickets at home.

If you print your tickets online and are offered the ""Pass the Line"" option, don't buy it.  It's not necessary.  At the House of Blues home page, it clearly states that all a person has to do is present a receipt from the restaurant or gift shop in order to automatically receive priority entrance into the music hall.  This is true at all HOB locations in the USA, per their website.  Furthermore if like me you purchase assigned seating tickets, there really is no need for priority entrance.  Those who have General Admission/Standing Room Only tickets will have a priority, as they can get into the music hall faster and secure a better place to watch the show.

Since I did not visit the HOB website to purchase my ticket to a recent show at the Las Vegas HOB, I was not aware of this option until after the fact.  I went to Tickemaster/LiveNation and bought the ticket there. During the check out process, an icon for ""Pass the Line"" popped up with an offer.  Buy a Pass the Line voucher in advance online, and receive not just the priority entrance, but also $20 on the voucher good towards purchase in the restaurant or gift shop.  I took it because I already knew I would be eating dinner at HOB before the show.  The voucher did not provide anything at a discount or for free, and in fact it is restrictive because it has to be used the night of the performance.  It really isn't anything more than HOB finding a way to receive payment for a meal or gift shop purchase well in advance.  Good marketing, but not good value for the consumer.  I bit anyway- that was a mistake.  After the ticket and the $20 voucher were paid for, I received an email link to print my ticket.  Upon printing I discovered that the printout includes a coupon for $10 off a restaurant meal purchase(s) of $25 or more.  The verbiage does not state it is not for the date of the ticketed performance, or excludes that performance, nor does it state that it cannot be combined with any other offer.  It is blatantly an attempt to get concert goers to eat at the restaurant, period.

So I took my receipt for the prepaid voucher to the box office and was issued the voucher.  I also had the $10 off offer on the printout with me.  When I presented the voucher worth $20 in conjunction with the printed meal discount offer, I was told they could not be used together, that the discount was for a future date as in incentive for people to return to dine.   I disagreed and said there was no verbiage to that effect.  I spoke to the manager, and explained that not only was the verbiage not present, but also the $20 voucher I tendered as payment was not a freebie or a comp, I paid the $20 in advance.  In other words, I was not getting anything for free by using it.  The manager attempted to tell me that was the fee to get past the line and onto the VIP line, at which point I pointed out that there was nothing special, as I could have merely dined and obtained a receipt, and presented the receipt with my ticket as proof of dining.  The manager abruptly relented and stated he would honor both because he ""wants me to have a good time at the concert.""  I don 't necessarily believe that was his true motive, but it works for me.  

The moral of the story is that if you are  planning on dining at HOB prior to the show, just pay for your dinner when you get there.",4IP4FkeOIjhdI1Hr7aDwOg,1,0,4,2LZ7cj2ZDv77ZoYUMRi0cA

Our friends, Left Standing, were playing last night (7/7/11) and we decided to eat at the show and show some support. 

We arrived, waited for seats even though there were open tables right in front of the stage. When we were being seated, we politely asked if it would be possible to sit closer to the stage, as those tables were open. We were told there was no server for that section. I'm sorry, but a section consisting of 2 tables in a place like the HOB?!?!? I don't think so.  We took the table we were offered, in the back of the room, off to the side and basically on the gaming floor. 

Before we even ordered our drinks, there was another couple at the the table where there ""isn't a server"". Oh, and they got their food before we did!

Our server was great, let me get that out there. He was busy, and forgot out water, but he was good. He had good personality and corrected anything we needed. I ordered two sides, the veggies and mashed potatoes. The veggies were good, but in my opinion, not warm enough. 

The potatoes came out at the same time as Chris' meal and they were COLD. After a few bites the server came to check on us, when I mentioned the potatoes were cold, he immediately took them and brought me new ones. We didn't have to wait for refills, and he continued to check on us all night. 

I am not one to keep quiet, though. I asked to speak to the floor manager and question the policy regarding the seating. I explained the situation, very calmly, and made it very clear that I was in NO WAY complaining about the service.

As a result, we were offered better seating that was open, and they comp'd us some drinks and desserts. 
 
The section we moved to had a different server, and he was on top of it. He had a great personality and checked on us frequently. 

The menu, unfortunately, got much smaller than we remembered. When we first started coming to the HOB I remember it had a ""real"" menu - the plastic covered kind with multiple pages. Now they're down to a 1 page oversized piece of paper with food on one side and drinks on the other. If you are with a picky eater, don't bother. Or, if you won't want to pay out the ass for your meal, you're in the wrong place. 

The more we go here, the more we are disappointed in the establishment. We've had good service, in fact, past servers even came up to us and checked in. 

With this seating fiasco and the limited menu, the only times we will ever return is for Left Standing or another friend-band playing  - and we'll likely skip the food and drinks and just stand for the show.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,3,8hx4s8LjAzelNS4ONlMTpA

The food was, like most have said, just okay. It wasn't anywhere near special and the price was over the top to have a sad buffet. The food was just warm. It wasn't hot, the bacon wasn't crispy, the mac 'n cheese lacked any sort of distinct flavor, the drinks were watered down. I'm so disappointed.

BUT, I could have dealt with that, I went really for the music. I was raised in a Southern Baptist household (the forced religion thing led me to stop believing in anything, hence atheist) so the music, while yes, religious, is something that I have deeply fond memories of. The jubilation, the reverence, it all moves me. Or did, until I got here. 

What the heck? The songs weren't traditionally gospel. They were made up, I think. The woman singing talked more than she sang, and when she did sing her voice was scratchy and lacked something. The only song I recognized was Amazing Grace and that lasted far longer than it should have. I just wasn't impressed and I think my background in gospel singing is well established. I was hoping for something less showy, more reverent and got this really whacked out stage show that didn't have much to do with any gospel I've ever heard and it was just sad. I went hoping to be moved and instead left early. And, they seemed like they wanted to convert people. I understand that it's a 'gospel' show, but I came to hear singing, not preaching. It was almost offensive, I expected them to start passing the plate at any time. Did I mention I was SO disappointed? I was so disappointed.

Yeah.... here's why.....

 My wife and I stay in Vegas way too much. We love Mandalay Bay. 

Invariably, I check out who's playing the HOB downstairs, plunk down the money (generally a great deal) and go see a band of which I have a passing interest.

Drinks - the usual overpriced glass of wine. It's the Strip 
Ambiance - eclectic Seventies reflecting Sixties look with stuff on the walls, pictures of musicians and the odd autographed axe. Cute., Sort of a Soft Rcok Cafe. I'm partial to darker lighting - I am not disappointed at HOB

She said we'd be fine and that it usually takes 45 minutes so we got seated.

We asked our waitress about the Yelp deal that gives you a free appetizer with order of an entree and she said she'd have to check with her manager first because they might only accept printed coupons. C'mon hon, it's a deal that you get from checking in on Yelp with your mobile phone, if you expect people to print this out then I'm going to yell at you. So when she comes back she ends up saying that she thinks it's okay but another waiter is taking over our table so when we pay, we can just bring up the deal to him. I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer and BF got one of the sandwiches (I think chicken) with sweet potato fries upgrade. Then we waited and waited and waited. Our waiter had already refilled our water glasses twice and then as we continued to wait, I think he just started to avoid our table altogether. At maybe 7:10 I finally just stopped him and asked how much longer our food would be and he said he would check. He came back with our food and I asked for the check and had to ask about the Yelp deal all over again.

BF's order did not have sweet potato fries, no way did we have time to exchange it though. As irritated as I was, when we began to eat it was kind of like ""okay, well this is pretty yummy.."" That's pretty much the only thing saving them in this review because I'm still so irritated by the communication between workers and the service overall. Yes they were friendly but geez. The hostess knew we were in a rush but never bothered to let our servers know? And when you switch out servers you should be updating the server replacing you about anything regarding the table, don't tell the customer to re-explain something to the new server. I understand our situation was a little different because we were in a rush to begin with but if we were going to wait that long just to receive the food, I would've appreciated being told at the door that I should consider eating somewhere faster.

Brandon Flowers put on a great show (OF COURSE ;) ) my only complaint that from where we were sitting, it was really difficult to see him when he was in the center or on the right of the stage. We could only clearly see him when he was on the left. =/

Upon walking in, I immediately enjoyed the interior. There was a lot of interesting things to look upon, including a gargantuan fake tree. Also, a musician started playing acoustically, which was unexpected and made the experience more fun. 

When the food arrived, we were very pleasantly surprised with the portions because we weren't expecting so much for the money we were paying. We enjoyed the spinach dip with kettle chips and the shrimp with cornbread. The cornbread was SO good and the sauce they put on the plate was a big hit with all three of us. Definitely my favorite. The wings were just average. We ended up not even finishing all of the apps, with the exception of the shrimp dish.

Our server showed up right away to take our drink and appetizer orders, but it took ages for her to come back. Someone ordered Tequila and she said the ""bottle was locked up"". Strange. Only one appetizer came out, and the next one came out 30 minutes later. Not acceptable, but the restaurant did comp it. It was the cheese artichoke dip which came out luke-warm. Not worth it, even if it was comped. The person refilling fountain drinks was very prompt however.

She blamed the kitchen for the delay, but she still only talked to us twice in the hour and fifteen minutes we were sitting there.  Then she finally came back after we told her we were going to have to leave, and she informed us our ticket had been lost.   I wondered why she hadn't checked on it in the forty five minutes since we'd ordered, but whatever.   She said she'd get a manager over to us.  The manager said she'd get our food out in fifteen minutes or just give us our check.  Our check for two sodas and some cornbread.  I was fully expecting them to comp us the sodas or something, but nope.

2596184,2017-09-09,1,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"The House of Blues is an excellent venue for live music and performances. I recently visited it for Pole Show LA by Leigh Ann Reilly, talented pole dancer and owner of Bespun in Hollywood, CA. The show was fun, sexy, and hilarious. The show itself was a combination of Cirque de Soleil and burlesque shows. Professional pole dancers from all over the world including Russia, France, and U.K. joined American dancers to perform at House of Blues. 

The venue has three sections: general admission, bar, and balcony seating. General admission (cheapest seats) was an open area where you stand and can get up close and personal with the performers. Bar seating was on the ground floor level with the bar with parties of 4 around individual tables. Balcony seating is the most comfortable and comparable to regular show seats at a vegas show and thus the most expensive. The seating selections are all very different so depending on what kind of mood you are in for the night, choose accordingly.

House of Blues is located in Mandalay Bay and super easy to find once you enter the casino. You won't miss the big House of Blues signs. I highly recommend this venue for a show or just some drinks to start your night. You can hop right over to the Shoppes to do some shopping, LIGHT to dance the night away or The Foundation Room for a breathtaking view of the Las Vegas Strip!",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,7,3,5,Hj6AdEiwlHMcVJY213Vrug

Happy Hour Daily 2-5pm

I came in for Happy Hour before going to see Billy Idol.  I love that they have happy hour every day, even on nights they have concerts.  Happy hour is 2-5 but on the night I was there they extended it until 7.  I am not sure how often that happens.  Maybe because it was show night?  I started with a Mango Mai Tai and then had a Pineapple Mojito.  Both drinks were very similar.  I am not sure they weren't the same drink.  They were good though and did the trick so no complaints from me.  I ordered the Cajun Popcorn Shrimp and Pretzel off the HH menu.  Both were OK.  Typical bar food that did the trick.  This wouldn't be my first choice for HH in Mandalay Bay but its great if you are on a budget or pregaming before a show.

As a concert venue, HOB in Mandalay is pretty decent.  It's set up exactly the same as other HOB's, with the pit on the bottom floor surrounded by bar space, and seating upstairs.  I personally like the upstairs seating, because there is nothing worse than being a short person in a pit setting.  I've been here for a Nas show and to see Common and N.E.R.D. and both were outstanding - the artists really had the crowd dancing in the aisles and on the chairs.  Price wise, both concerts were reasonable too.

My only complaints for HOB :
1. It is a non-smoking venue (WHAT??!?!?!  This is freakin Vegas, everywhere should be smoking allowed) and there is no where to duck off too in between sets to get in a drag (unless you go all the way out to the casino floor or are brazen enough to ignore or subvert security and risk getting the boot)
2. the drinks!  friggin ridonculous!  i paid 18 dollars for a 'rita, including tip.  and it was nasty!

As a concert venue, it feels intimate. There really isn't a bad seat, of course, they aren't many actually seats. You stand here or you paid a lot of money for one of the few tables.

It was a Saturday night so the hour wait wasn't a problem, what was a problem was that the host wanted either a drivers license or credit card for the table pager. I wasn't comfortable giving either of those items to host at a restaurant for a pager; when I declined both hosts working got rude stating I could wait if I like but if I wasn't there when they called I would lose my table which is understandable. After about 45 minutes we checked in to see if there was an update about our table again the host was rude telling me they had 15 minutes and the exact time that they had to get us a table. When our table was ready they sat us right in front of the live band, which was so loud we couldn't even order or communicate with our server. We asked our server if we could move back slightly which she accommodated with no problem. Our server was amazing and I would enjoy her serving me anytime. 

Now lets talk about the food.... Lets start with the chicken I was served... First I'm not sure it was even chicken because the size of the leg and breast I got were so tiny.... When I cut into it and got passed the skin I'm pretty sure the chicken wasn't cooked... It may have been the poor lighting but the chicken just didn't look right.... My moms chicken wasn't much better than mine, but she was able to eat hers... The server offered to remake my chicken but I was already too turned off to try another attempt at it, so instead I ate a side of mashed potatoes. Everything else that came from the kitchen was ok and just ok.... Nothing stood out as amazing or spectacular...

Oh and if there is a band playing they also charge an entertainment fee... Which is a bit unreasonable since the band made it so you had to scream across the table.

The restaurant is loud and lively with the band, the random people dancing in between tables, and the merry diners getting sustenance to get them through a night in the casinos or clubs. 

I like that the have an extensive selection of entrees on the menu. Everything from salad to pasta to tacos, burgers, sandwiches and even meat and potato dishes. We shared a spinach dip appetizer for the table and it was on point. The entrees were very typical of the quality of chain restaurants, and everything was edible. Not exceedingly delicious or memorable, but edible.

It's certainly one of the most fun, fairly priced and easy restaurants to eat at in Mandalay Bay.",TNYM6vmcp1Nxibt7vsbx3g,9,7,4,D4YSmyN_d-USgofAX5EiqQ

Breakfast: I liked breakfast here, but the service was slow.
Take-out lunch: Walk up to the bar and ordered. The food took forever, but the bartenders were cool. 
Dine-in Lunch: This knocks the place down from 3-4 stars to 2 stars. I had cajun shrimp salad that was almost unedible. Whatever they used for the dressing, they put it on too heavy. For some reason it was really spicy. I like spicy, but this dressing was basically medium spicy followed with a taste of nasty. I'm sure it would have been much better if it was only lightly coated. The service was again, very slow.

Overall, the food is nothing special. It would be a much better option to walk over to Border Grille, Citizens, Fleur or even Lupo.",zXj4PlDxzh7cVl9wM7x2sA,0,0,2,0BoTZ7DbRhy1vNTjaJuE8g

The server was very prompt and friendly and brought coffee right away. However, we did wait about 25 minutes for our food.

The food was tasty, but my omelet had a wrong ingredient in it and I was brought toast with no jelly or butter. My husband said the corned beef hash was better at Red, White and Blue (also in MB hotel), and his poached eggs were not really poached at all (not runny but solid).

This venue was perfect for each of them because it's big enough that a lot of people can fit and really enjoy the music but small enough that there's not a bad view anywhere and you can really vibe with the artist.  General admission standing room tickets are usually cheapest and for us they're usually just fine.  You don't really have to arrive that early (no more than an hour) to get a great spot.  For Falling in Reverse, we arrived at the same time the doors opened and stood in about the third row.  For Social Distortion, we arrived about an hour and a half early and stood in the very front.
Security here is usually awesome and is able to stop any fights before the get out of hand.  The only problem that I have is that when the doors are supposed to open, people start going through the security line (pretty basic metal detector wave and quick purse check) only to stand in what appears to be another line for the actual doors to open.  This wouldn't at all be a problem except there's a large area but everyone stands in a single, respectful line.  Every time, security comes through and asks everyone to fill in the rest of the space.  This causes people from the back of the line to be able to move up in front of the people already waiting and someone always gets mad and picks a fight.  It doesn't make much sense considering everyone has to file through a relatively small entry way.  Just be prepared for this and move up as much as you can!
On most occasions, we grab dinner at the restaurant after and it's always a fun, upbeat experience.  I'm not sure the exact schedule but I believe they have live music Friday and Saturday nights at least.",dM2LAzJJ14OOMhH6-cYklA,1,0,4,DrUMKyhpQg4fltEWsez7-Q

2811898,2012-10-27,2,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CONCERT VENUE ONLY.

So far I have been to HOB twice this year. One was for Hoobastank and the other was for RZA, Wu Tang Clan founder.

First, let me get the negatives out of the way. That way you can end reading this on a more positve note.

NEGATIVES:

Security says you cant smoke and that you have to go back outside to do so. This is FALSE. The two times I was there people were smoking weed and regular cigarettes. Not once did I see ANY security or usher walking around telling people to put out their smokes. I for one don't smoke but I am not about to be a killjoy by ratting them out. I assumed even if I did, they probably wouldnt do a damn thing about it. 

The main floor that's right in front of the stage can get a little messy. What I mean by that is you got people drinking and spilling their beer not just on the floor, but also on other people as well. You will also see pretty much the same people that drink just throw their garbage on to the floor. Talk about litter bugs! Again I for one dont drink but if I did, I would hang out by the bar area to enjoy my suds until I was done. Then I would make my way to the main floor. There should be a rule that you cant drink on the main floor. 

The climate to this place fluctuates. Sometimes its rather warm and sometimes it can get pretty cold. Dont know how HOB has their system set up, but its definitely not consistent.

POSITIVES:

The stage has just the right amount of room and is elevated so you can see the performers pretty clear. Since its an intimate setting, you are pretty close to all those that are on stage. Most of my pictures I have taken looks like im pretty much right in front of them so when my friends see the pics, they get kinda jealous because it looks like im so very close to the stage.

The sound and lighting is awesome! When there are some deep bass lines in some songs, you can literally feel the bass pounding right through your body! 


So overall, I would say I had an ok experience both times here. Its just that those negatives were still there and it didnt matter who was performing.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,7,4,2,cpdsV-tHrt9VaDpc90aGJg

The carribean jerk chicken wings are a big hit! The wings themselves are huge since they are both wing and drumsticks. The seasoning on them is delicious and hits that great balance of spicy, savory, and sweet.
I got the beef street tacos and those were a major miss. They were tiny, dry and lacking any flavor.
The pulled pork sliders were somewhere between the other dishes as they were a bit dry and not as flavorful but were still satisfying.

The best thing about the whole thing was that the total came out to $25 for 4 dishes. A great value in my opinion that filled us up and was good.

The margherita pizza is delicious. Next door, they have a little club. It wasn't very busy that night (I highly doubt it's a happening place), but it's a great place to go if all you want to do is get your dance on.

The restaurant on the other hand is a hot ass mess. 1 star. Me and the fam went for lunch and we were pretty excited because the menu was created by Aaron Sanchez (foodnetwork chef). My mom ordered the fish of the day, my dad got the rib eye, cousin got te lobster Mac and cheese, bf got the Jamaican burger and I got the juicy lucy burger. First off, we waited forever for the food.. But I'll let that slide because there were 5 of us. Second, the food finally came out and my cousins lobster Mac and cheese was sans lobster. And lastly, my mom found a piece of plastic wrapper in her veggies. We called the manager over and told him about the lobster and the plastic. All he said was that  the kitchen was learning a new menu and that he'd send some new veggies and take care of it. Then the waiter gave us the wrong check and my mom never got her side of veggies. But at the end of the day, we got 50% off our bill. 

The rib eye was super tender and yummy. The juicy Lucy burger was tasty and a fattie and the bf love his burger. The fish of the day was swordfish, but it was a tiny ass serving, the size of a toddler's palm. The lobster Mac and cheese is also yummy, but make sure they don't forget the lobster. 

All in all, I definitely won't be returning to the crossroads restaurant. The food is ok/good but the service is THE WORST. The part that bothers me the most is that no one was apologetic about anything. But I'll probably go to the bar for a cheap beer.",_YIKfY4IWIX7dyNzKJoBiA,1,0,2,TI4BnsLnB6Ddrrx9K35Evg

2836652,2015-07-06,1,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"I booked a last minute trip to Vegas when I found a cheap plane ticket and realized my (second) favorite band, Steel Panther, was playing that weekend. As much as I love Steel Panther and not much can ruin one of their kick ass shows...I kinda hated this venue. 

The night started off rough when I was forced to remove my belt and check it for $3 (or I had the option to ""bring it back to my car""...because...yeah right. Everyone cabs in Vegas, and my hotel was a mile and a half away). My belt was studded but the studs were flat and definitely weren't going to hurt anywhere. And yet security didn't confiscate my bracelet with huge spikes, which, according to the sign I saw upon arriving, was prohibited. Dumb. 

The actual space inside has a lot of character, but if you like to be in the front row like me, the stage is awkwardly high, (a foot or so above eye level, and I'm 6'0""), which makes for an uncomfortable viewing experience. Drinks are also outrageously expensive -- even for Vegas. If you want to be tipsy for a show, don't bother trying to do it here. $11 for a shot of their cheapest rail whiskey (and it was an extra small shot glass, too) was just ridiculous. I get that it's a concert venue in Vegas so it's gonna be pricey...but I was shocked. 

Of course, Steel Panther always kicks ass. They have so much energy and are so freaking funny. It was my fifth time seeing them (I'd seen them in 3 other states and 4 other venues previously), and I was really sad to see their set cut short. They changed up their set and played all the songs I'd never heard live before, which was super cool, but then they cut their set short! I don't know if that was a House of Blues policy or something, but the show ended pretty early (around 12:30)...and there was no encore! First time I've seen them that they didn't return to do an encore and play Community Property and Party All Day. I was pretty bummed. I could've watched them play for hours more. Also Steel Panther shows always get wild and inappropriate and a little nude, but the House of Blues apparently has stricter limits on what they'll allow compared to other venues. 

If a band I love is playing in Vegas and they're only playing here, I suppose I'd return. But it's definitely not my first choice for a venue.",EwVOzPejkAkYyaxRBdm8Ow,3,1,2,tYbrVu-h-VYDe8w3RkDvzQ

I'm a server my self and the things he was doing was absolutely ridiculous! Took him longer than 10 mins to greet us ! Starving and having a short time frame to eat and get to a game we decided what we wanted to order before he had stopped to greet us.. Taking the drink order we had told him that we were actually ready to order food as well. Shortly after taking 3 out of 6 of our orders he tells my aunt "" Hold on one second"" , than walks away and grabs utensils for another one of his tables and drops it off a couple tables down. After doing that he returns and continues on taking our order. Who does that? Right in the middle of taking our order? Something that should NOT ever be done. My girlfriend and I weren't too hungry so we ordered a salad and asked for it to come out with everyone else's food. Around 7 mins later he comes and drops off the salad to us without everyone else's food of course. Knowing we were sharing he did not give us another plate or any silverware at all! Just simply dropped off the salad and walked away without saying a word. He wouldn't stop by to check on us at all still we had to stop him to ask for silverware..  The rest of the food took a long time to come out after the salad as well. After the food came out he drops it off and never seen again. With empty cups wanting refills again we had to stop him. Not remembering that I had a mango ice tea he poured regular tea in my cup and I told him it was mango. He leaves and returns with a little cup of syrup in his hand and just pours it into my iced tea. Yes I do know that the flavored iced teas are regular tea mixed with flavored syrup but is it professional for your server to just fill your flavored iced tea with a pitcher of regular than just pour syrup on top in front of you? I would never do that and I don't think any server would ever think of doing so. This is the worst service ever.

This is something the sound engineers need to keep in mind.  This is not a large arena of 20,000+ like where Santana used to perform.  When the first song started, we looked at each other and said it will be fine.  By the fourth song we were holding our ears and had to run out of there because it hurt.

Came here prior to a night of clubbing at Vanity.  The happy hour wasn't huge or anything , but what I did order was super tasty!

Ordered:

Spinach & Artichoke Dip-  Man this was a huge order of chips and dip.  Red chips and white chips ...oh my !!   I love this stuff... one of the best I have tasted.

Buffalo Wings-  $5.00 for a pound of wings... Score !!!  Don't forget the ranch, napkins, extra napkins, and a wedge of lemon to help cleanse your hands of the buffalo scent.  The power of citrus ...amazing !!

Blue Skittles Shot-  This was not on the happy hour, but it was recommended by my server.  It really did taste like a Skittle!  I wonder if there are other shots that taste like the rest of the rainbow?  
He let me keep the shot glass too!  Heck yeah !!

Instead of the standing room everywhere downstairs deal that I'm used to, these guys have added a few ""VIP"" areas where one could sit down and/or get bottle service.  Man, this VIP/bottle game has gotten toooo ubiquitous here in the City of Sin.  

So we were here to see Steel Panther on a Fri night.  Not too bad a line and I coughed up for the first round of drinks while the others found us a place from which to watch the show.  Just below us are totally unoccupied comfy couches guarded by a helpful gentleman who said that for $300 we could sit and get a bottle of hooch and mixers.  Nay say I, besides, we're drinking beer.  Roll up the sleeves, here come the negotiations...  Long story short (too late) we got down to $150 and it comes with a $100 bar tab.  Still we walked on the deal--two of our members were not drinking by that point.

Anyhow, decent show (though long on the banter and mucho sampled backgrounds) and a decent sound in the venue, but I have one more complaint.  While I was...um...making room for another beer I noticed that Fridays were $6 24oz Bud Lights.  Since I had been paying $11 for 24oz Coors Lt I decided to switch.  Ordered up 3 and was told that it would be $33.  I reminded the tarbender of the ad in the bathroom and he said that was the 12oz cans.

Not only do you get a table but the best part is if you are a couple of two you paid $150 but you get a food and drink credit of $150 and if you are a group of four he paid $300 and you get a food and drink credit of $300.

This last visit was for the Pennywise concert on March 16.  Checking in thru security was swift and they were all quite pleasant.  Once inside it was packed which is to be expected with a band like this with such a huge following for the past 25 years.  It was a great time!

The bartenders were efficient despite being slammed.  The one I dealt with took the time to greet me AND thank me after serving me and taking payment.  I know that's trivial but in atmospheres like this those types of qualities general get forgotten about.

One other thing I enjoy about HOB is the security (while ever present especially at this type of concert) are not over-bearing.  They realize that at this type of show it's going to get rowdy, there's going to be a mosh pit, there will be crowd surfing and people will be getting knocked down.  Goes with the territory and that's what I enjoy for this type of show.  Don't worry all of you more timid concert goers...there's plenty of seating upstairs or standing areas around the floor that are out of the mix.

This past experience receives 5 stars from me given the fact that I know going into it that the following will occur:  I will have beer spilled/sprayed on me, my shoes will get trashed, I will be sweaty and I will encounter a few dicks with attitudes...All goes with the territory.  If you want a peaceful experience, go see Celine Dion or something.  Otherwise come to HOB and get rowdy and support bands like this!

They have a $20 pass you can buy to enter the music venue first.  You buy one per person and you go. This pass is good for the store or the back bar.  This seemed like a great idea to my mom and I, as we were planning on drinking first anyway.  We went to the bar and got each of our $20 worth of drinks... and then they say that you can only use one $20 front of line credit per party.  So... what is the point of getting them?  Our bartender went to the ticket booth to make sure that we even needed to buy two of them... turns out we did need to buy one each, but we can't use them?

The reason that I still gave them the 4 stars is because we did have an amazing bartender, and the venue wasn't overcrowded.  I go to shows and concerts in Los Angeles.

She asked what I wanted and I told her I wanted something fruity but refreshing.  She asked one more question, and that was ""do you like ginger?""

House of Blues music venue is pretty small setup and  when you get seated  it appears you have a pretty good view of the stage.  We were in row 208 section C seats 4-9.  I was in seat 4 and could easily see the front of the stage.

The name of the concert is Santana for the world famous highly skilled musician Carlos Santana.  What we could see was his entire band and a salt and pepper male singing duo.  What we did not see was Carlos Santana, the person EVERYBODY came to see.  Yes he was there, yes he was playing, but he practically hid in the far left corner of the stage 99.9% of the show.  Hmmm, so maybe House of Blues should instruct Mr Santana that the crowd paying $125 per ticket and more(price of our seats) are there to SEE him, not just hear him.  If I just wanted to listen to him I would have watched Youtube.  There was a camera man shooting live for the television screens but even that didn't focus on Carlos.  What I am typing might sound like bitter grapes, but trust me nobody on the left side of the stage was happy, most people were just as bored as me, yawning and not even looking at the stage or televisions.

Well maybe if we had purchased different seats the concert would be better-wrong! We left early and I checked the view from the center and right viewing areas and Mr Santana was very difficult to see from those vantages as well.  Mr Santana was virtually hiding from his fans way in the back left corner of the stage.  Santana's sets were also way too long.  Interesting upbeat music quickly devolved into boring noise as single songs turned into ten minute long ordeals.  Dude mix it up and keep your audience attentive not imprisoned.  I have seen almost every show in Vegas and the only show worse than this was the Legends of Music Tribute show at the Stratosphere which cost $20 and came with a free buffet !

I would highly recommend NOT seeing Santana unless you are a die hard fan willing to pay a lot of money to only hear him play.",qZ3sJPn5NqSVFMLYGAJH_A,14,2,1,ax2A7q-XWRdIFMgSxXmwow

I'm from California and used to go to all sorts of concerts in different locations but this one is by far my new favorite location. This was my first time getting to see Walk off The Earth, and wasn't expecting to be blown away by their showmanship. having seen some / if not all or their videos on YouTube . I knew they were good but wasn't expecting the show to be amazing. Seriously I had so much fun it was the best show I seen in a long while. 
Picking my tickets up at will call around 6:15 pm it was super quick and easy, there was literally no line  and  security was just as fast. 
When I actually got into the venue I was shocked to see that the house was practically full. 
Doors opened at 6 pm and the opening act ( the Darenots)   started at 7 pm.  They Played several songs including a reggae song. Being from Toronto Canada they expressed how excited they were to be on tour and in Las Vegas. In between their performance and Walk Off The Earth I decided to buy a drink at the bar. Sitting almost in front of the bar it wasn't that hard to make my way there and considering it was between sets the bar wasn't completely slammed. So getting my drink was quick. I got a Pabst beer on tap with a few orange slices for $10 the price was fair and the beer was cold just the way I like it. 
 At 8 pm When Walk Off The Earth took the stage I was genuinely excited & taken back by how the crowd erupted with cheers. Having found a place to sit I was sitting off to the right of the stage i had an amazing birds eye view. In short this concert was the best one I been to in a long time. Walk Off The Earth has a way of getting the crowd hyped and keep the energy going. They have a unique way of using unorthodox objects to create beats. I found their take on major hits such as Ed Sheeran Shape of You  to be amazing, and almost laughable on how they pulled off the beats.

As if my $350.00 wasn't enough for the two Santana tickets you feel the need to steal from concert goers  by charging 5.00 for one run of the mill bottle of water. This water did not taste like fresh gear drops from the cherubs in heaven but I feel that's what I paid for. I totally understand drought desert conditions but this is stepping over the line. You drain the canals in the Venetian and drain the water features in front of Treasure Island and the Mirage--that's when I will be willing to see water shortage sucks and we must pay more. 

I will not stand for this aggression, house of blues administration. 

I can understand the risks involved with serving booze to a crowd that's known for über-indulging in the intoxicating substances, which is why I could assume you charge $11.00 for a small whiskey & 7. Everyone needs a drink of water, I don't fear the liability involved with this necessary business approach. 

Oh yeah, the venue itself is awesome. Folky, quirky, bluesy--great seats are to be found just about anywhere. I would warn you that section 208 is quite steep and high above the actual stage in case you need a different perspective.

As for the quality and showmanship of Carlos Santana--his guitar delaying ability remains top notch. His ability to whoo a crowd is suspect. He doesn't move a whole lot around the stage and dont expect much singing from him. Did I feel like I was on the bargain end of seeing one of my guitar heros in person? Not really.

I know this will sound silly and like I'm exaggerating, but I truly felt like none of them had ever organized/worked a concert before.  It was absolute chaos.  I go to concerts all the time and this was by far the worst experience I've had with a venue and their ability to fairly and effectively manage the crowd.  Lots of people were waiting all day long before the show started and hours later, closer to showtime, the whole line was moved around about 8 or 9 times.  One guy would tell us we were all in the wrong place and needed to line up by the escalators, then someone else would lead us to a different spot in the casino, then back in front of the venue again, and it went on and on and on.  This whole time the line was getting messed up and people were running around like crazy trying to make sure they didn't get screwed out of their spot.  Once they finally decided where to put us, half the people were facing in one direction and half in the other direction.  The staff couldn't even decide where the front of the line was!  It was so ridiculous none of us could believe it.  

They continued to be completely unorganized and when we were finally let into the venue, they destroyed the line again by holding back the right side & letting tons of people from the left go in...and then did the same to the other side.  Do these people not understand the point of lining up??  It's not just for fun, it's because we all spent many hours trying to ensure a great spot.  Telling us ""every spot is a good spot"" is irrelevant and makes it clear that you don't understand at ALL.  

Oh I forgot to mention the best part.  To even get into this line that would be let in first, they force you to spend $20 in their store or restaurant to get a pass in.  So if you're a huge fan of whoever is playing, just know that the 'Pass The Line' people will be let in before you unless you shell out an additional $20.  Way to pray on the fans, make a quick buck, and then treat us like crap, HOB.  Not amused at all.

I hope Brandon never plays here again, because he's the only musician I'd go through this for again.  I almost gave them 2 stars because the bartender was nice when I asked for water, but they really don't deserve it.",_seDuTbNHvRq9P4cFRmf-A,1,0,1,taWkpg5C70Toehyc0aNuAw
3411700,2013-10-05,2,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"Now that I have been to both the music venue as well as their restaurant and other conference/""back party room"" (for the ""May The 4th Be With You CMYE), I feel as if I have a pretty good grasp on this place... As least enough to write a solid review.

I have to commend this place. Most people associate more gimmicky restaurants like this with poor food and service. NOT HERE! You will be amazed with how on point both are. My guest and I were seated promptly, even though they were semi-busy. Our waitress was there with two glasses of water as she greeted us. I thought that was very smart, because as a former server, 99% of people are gonna want water anyway... Saves you an extra trip.

So she gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and decide what we wanted, and made sure the food came out quickly. She checked on us regularly and chatted for a little bit too. Pretty much the perfect server experience!

The night I was there (a Friday), they have karaoke with a live band. Oh. My. Lawd. It was so fun! I didn't sing, but I wanted to! It looked like a blast. Just watching the people get up and sing was fun. You know how most bars that host karaoke, you kinda zone out, it's not really that cool...... This was the complete opposite! Good times.

I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was very, very good. Super creamy,not too cheesy, light, crispy bread crumbs, with sizable chunks of lobster, all served piping hot. I have a slight lactose/heartburn thing. It is fairly mild, but if I have too much dairy (specifically frozen yogurt. It's the worst) or too much oil, I can get all bubbly in the gullet area. I ate half of the meal then, and the rest later on. No problems at all! That's proof there was a good balance of ingredients. It was pretty expensive ($20), but with all the lobster they loaded it with, I wasn't too surprised.

Moving on to the music venue. I came here to see the band Meshuggah, with Animals As Leaders for the opening band. I have been to many a music venue in my heyday, and let me tell you... House of Blues' venue is one of the really good ones. It's pretty much close to perfection. The way that they built it is that no matter where you are located, you can see the band. It's intimate enough that you feel connected to the performance, but large enough to hold plenty of people. They have two smaller bars and one large one. The large bar is in the back, and had about 3 or 4 bartenders working it at the time, so you never had to wait for a drink. If you did, it was MAYBE two minutes, max. They even had cocktail waitresses, for those hardcore fans who don't want to miss anything by going to the bar!

The drinks are pricey, the they almost always are at these places. The cheapest place I have ever been to for venue drinks was Station 4 in Minneapolis, where you could get a PBR tall boy for around $4. That's as good as it gets. I think my beer at HOB was a full cup o' beer for $7 or $8. I firmly advocate a little pre-game action prior, then anticipate to buy a couple at the show. Everyone wins!! The few times I have ordered a mixed drink here, it has been a little weak, especially for the price you pay for it. I guess that would have to be my only ""whine"" moment about HOB.

This place has it all: good food, great venue, awesome service, and cool decor. It's pretty much a ""must do"" in Vegas if you are gonna be at Mandalay Bay.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,6,3,4,G_kXJy_SCcnVQCDknkdNYA

The tickets were cheap and because we were locals (with local ID) we got the service charge waived and some sort of VIP drink pass which gave us discounted well drinks, house wine and domestic beers. The box office staff were friendly and quite helpful. 

On the day of the show there was no line to get in, the bouncers were pleasant (that's kinda rare in Vegas...maybe because I am a girl). There were a bunch of people standing to the side smoking (since I last came here they made everyone go out into the casino to smoke...kinda weird).

We roll up to the bar and they had big boy cans of beer. We wanted PBR but they were out so we opted for Miller Lite. With our cool discount band we got 2 for $12. That isn't horrible by Vegas standards Sam, the bartender, was awesome and sweet. Totally made us feel at home (well as best as he could considering the music was loud and the crowd was rowdy).

Husband and I went to the HOB on a Saturday night. My tickets says that the doors will open at 8 pm and that I must pick up my tickets between 7 and 7:30 pm.  Lucky, my husband works for MGM International, so parking at the Mandalay is free for us. Because of the tragedy that occurred in October, the Mandalay parking lot was empty. And because of this, there was a little sadness in my heart. At this point, I need a little something to cheer me up a bit.

My husband and I made our way to HOB. Now, I've been to this HOB for dining, but never to their concert venue. I thought the events team did a really good job with the outdoor setup.  We clearly understood where we needed to go to pick up our tickets. The lady helping us, it was clear that this is just a job for her :|  

After picking up our tickets, my husband decided that we should go in right away since they were letting people in.  The ""bouncer"" asked for my ID, which shocked me, because I don't go to ""clubs"" and I'm old so I'm not used to being carded where as my husband wasn't carded and he looks way younger than I do.

We got to the event person that scanned our tickets and then made our way to security. We followed all the rules, take everything out of your pockets, we were quickly scanned, and my purse was checked.  Because we got there early enough, we got through the preliminary stuff rather quickly. And once again, the event people were professional.

Because this was our first time to the concert venue, when we got into the small lobby area, we didn't know where to go. Once we quickly observed our surroundings, we headed downstairs. 

As one would expect, when we got into the club, it was dark with bright lights coming from the stage and dim lights around the bar. Because it's been such a long time that I've been to a venue like this, I thought it was small.  And more importantly, where's the seats!? :D And with the few pub tables available, why is it barricaded off!? I see, standing room ""only"" show unless you pay the upgrade. Upgrade was $50 person or $100 bar tab for a table. $100 bar tab for a table isn't bad when you have a bunch of people, but it was just my husband and I. Thanks, but no thanks, we'll stand.

I did go to the bathroom and found it clean. They even have a lady in there with a line of lipsticks, hair sprays, perfumes and paper towels. Classy.

It is a nightclub, so I did expect areas of sticky floors and a bit of sticky counters.  My husband ordered a Stella Artois. I believe the big bottle was $12. My husband also ordered fries, which was actually really good and not too bad at $5.

While waiting for our fries, a DJ and his hype man were on stage. Shortly thereafter, they moved their equipment so that the first band could play. The first band, Garage Band, was alright. In the middle of their set, we finished our fries and made our way down towards the front of the stage and found our place against the stairs.

Once the band was done, the DJ came back out along with his ""MC"" and we partied like it was 1990. And this DJ was a real DJ; he mixed, cut and scratched and played music from the late 80s and early 90s. My husband actually live streamed it on FB and his friends were getting a kick out of it. And to think, it was only 8:30 pm! 

The cover band came out, we enjoyed the first 5 songs, the club was getting packed, just a sea of people dancing and having a good time.

My husband wanted to meet the DJ. Turns out the MC is from HI and his wife is the events manager at HOB, also from HI. So, of course, super cool people.

Good venue with big name acts like Santana and Marilyn Manson performing here. Great people. A little pricey, but all-in-all, a really good time.  Wait, you got people from HI working for you and a drink called ""the 9th island""!? Bumping this up to 4-stars.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,2,1,4,2EBim-8FnPr5PaMXcBsANw

But the gospel band that played, did a lot of preaching. More than I've experienced in Glide Church (my favorite gospel venue in San Francisco.) 

The band was fine, but the set was very short!! One of the singers seemed to spend an awful lot of time introducing his family, his friends, any married people in the audience, any birthday people in the audience, and basically jabbering instead of cranking out the good gospel music.

The food was plentiful, as any buffet is, but nothing stood out, and a few things just didn't taste good. The carving station had ham...or ham. The salad bar didn't have anything beyond standard salad stuff. The deserts were ok. The shrimp were fine. The biscuits and gravy were fine. The chicken was yummy. And everything else was utterly forgettable.

Also, maybe drink prices went up, but I got a diet Coke, a bloody mary and a club soda, and it was $12.50.

First - took us an hour and a half to get our food. Not just us - but no one in the place was getting served.  No explanation - just ""it's coming"".  No apology. 

Then - when the food did come - our apps were served at the same time as our meals. We weren't the only ones - I noticed quite a few tables complaining about the same issues. 

A couple of our apps were forgotten completely (but of course were on the bill) and only half the dinners were served at once. The others came out sporadically - including mine that was a half hour after the first person was served. 

Three of us ordered ribs. They are not fall off the bone. Don't get them or if you do - ask for a steak knife. 

Worse - there was a ""red fish special"" for $29.00. It comes out on a huge plate with two pieces of fish the size of your thumb. I wish I was kidding. And it was the only thing on the plate (except the lemon slice which just added insult to injury). 

I had the waiter come over and he actually laughed at it when he looked at it knowing that our concern was legit. He showed it to another waiter who too shook his head in disbelief that this came out of the kitchen. 

They wanted to take it to the manager so he could see it himself. His response was ""that's the way it is"".  They did offer to replace the dish however we were already 2 hours in at this point.

I was on a business trip and staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and the very first night I was there, the head of my region decided to treat everyone to a meal at the House of Blues.

No small feat considering we were a group of over 30.

I wasn't feeling too adventurous so i just ordered a burger, but the burger was cooked very well and the options of what you could add to the burgers were very extensive. My entire group was happy with the food, but if the waitresses says the dish is on the small side, please take her on her word. The Cobb salad was humungous and I will give a second-hand review of ""delicious"".

I had such a good experience the first night that when another, smaller group of co-workers asked me if I wanted to go, I immediately said yes. I went with a group of 4 and got their House of Blue salad and a side order of Sweet potatoes fries (because I just couldn't say no). I was just as pleased the second time around with the food and the service. The best part of the second night was the fact that they had several TV's and it was easy to see game 4 of the NBA Finals.

I think the consensus was that open handed strikes were okay -- ladies, you have been warned.  The female bartenders were tatty and gritty, but amazingly attentive.  With each round the drinks got stronger.  Wine pours pushed the brim of the glass and Cuba Libres became transparent from the very high rum to Coke ratio.  Making the arrangement even more generous, it was happy hour when we went.  So our several drinks came out to very little money when all was said and done.

This one isn't the first one I've been to, although, I do think that this is probably my favorite one so far. The food is really great here. I love their caesar dressing, and the chocolate cake is to die for. 
The drinks are moderately priced, just like the food. HOB is just a great place to come and relax on a lazy Vegas night or to come and jam out with some of music's biggest names to date. 
It is usually packed, so it is a good idea to have someone arrive about 30 minutes early to get your name on the list.

Pouting was so so.  Both of us got the eggplant sandwich which was decent but gave us horrible stomach pains within two hours...or maybe it was the poutin which we both ate.  Waitress was friendly but slow and not frequent to check on us even though we were seated right next to the kitchen.  She even put the wrong appetizer in for us at first.

Although that's why the buffets are popular because at the Mandalay Bay Hotel The Buffet is $17.99 and includes a beverage. So it wasn't the greatest chicken sandwich in the world but the service was good. Also I really like that they allow substitutions for the fries and I got a huge quantity of quality veggies. They weren't your standard carrots and peas, but rather red peppers, asparagus and crisp green beans. 

I got my sandwich to go as I was on my way to the airport and just discovered that I had $24 on my MLife card that would expire within the year.

3924801,2012-10-14,2,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"This review is for the concert venue (I have never had any experience with the gift shop/restaurant*). 

I have been to over ONE HUNDRED shows here, the first being Blue October in 2006 (hey, there was nothing else on a weekday night) and the last being one of the thirty Steel Panther sets I have seen here. Seems masochistic if I really believe this venue is two stars right? Well, one does not have a choice if a show is booked here or at another better venue.  

This venue seems to be a magnet for douches. I cannot put it any other way. It's probably the location, because it is not particularly the shows; sets of Steel Panther at Ovation @ Green Valley Ranch go on without a hitch. A Joe Rogan/Deathsquad set goes on without a hitch at the now defunct Playboy Comedy Club at Palms, but here at House of Blues .... ahem ... crowd is comprised of 40% deebags. It could be argued that it is not the venue's fault, but perhaps it is. 

I have never been hit with a cup full of beer at The Pearl; seems to be something that would only happen at HOB because of several factors:
- security is not respected; 
- security -- generally speaking, is not competent, hence why they are not respected; and
- bartenders, some of them at least, are inherently rude pricks therefore agitating the poor cheap beer consumer and filling them with unpleasantness (and cheap nasty libation) which later would inspire them to throw a half-filled cup of the shit towards an innocent group of concert-goers due to the clear lowering of standards of decent etiquette. 

Ten or more times I have walked up to the bar and asked for a cup of ice water. Ten or more times I have scored the HOB employee lottery and gotten a cool bartender that realizes it is exactly fifteen or so seconds of their time. They give me the cup and I give them a couple of Washingtons as compensation. 

Why is it that the one time there is a EDM festival outside (at the beach or the arena or who knows [I did not attend], and the aftershow is in the HOB, a deebag bartender, who years earlier as a regular concert-goer probably was the perpetrator of a thrown beer or two at the same venue, announces to my girlfriend that he would not give her water that was from the Las Vegas Valley Water District. Uh, okay. 

Truly nonsensical, especially considering they use that SAME water for drinks, but perhaps they were mandated with selling more over*priced bottles of water by supervisors/management because they were expecting a bunch of thirsty, candykids to be in there that night. Cool; eight dollars or whatever the hell it is for a bottle of Dasani water, which is just tap water from another city, and no tip for the dude behind the bar.

Those other reviews pointing to the gross oversell of the GENERAL ADMISSION/FLOOR areas of HOB-Vegas have it pretty dead on. I have been to, I don't know, ten-twelve different HOB venues and none oversells the GA sections of their concert halls like this HOB does. None have such an impressively poor climate control system either where it seems like it is 120 degrees F during some sets (Common during NBA All-Star Weekend comes to mind).    

This venue will never be a Pearl, or a Book & Stage, but it could be as decently solid as HOBs in other states (Dallas, TX comes to mind, or even Chicago, IL [which is by no means perfect]). There are significant problems that are organic to this particular HOB venue and it is quite sad because a lot of decent shows are booked here. You've been warned. - E

There was a Gospel group that came in as the performance that afternoon. The total cost was about $40, which sounded expensive at first, but in the end it wasn't a bad deal at all for what I got.

The line itself was a bit of a long wait. Once we got in, the smell of pancakes and syrup filled the room. There was a nice waitress handing out mimosas to the guests, and then we basically just seated ourselves on the bottom level.

The room itself is wide, dark and has a traditional layout. It's a boxed style layout that is traditional with a balcony up stairs that surrounds the whole room. Then you have the main floor and then it drops below floor level. It's about medium sized that you'll get a good view anywhere.

Once we found our seats, we went hunting and gathering for food. There was a omelet line, which only produced 3 omelets at a time. It's about a 15-20 minute wait, but well worth it. The chef was very talkative and engaged with the patrons.

After that I picked up some HUGE perfectly cooked apple wood bacon. By the end of the performance, it was all gone. Also picked up freshly made mini waffles, and sausage.

I am fairly picky about my OJ that it can't be from concentrate. My friends made sure the waitress brought back fresh orange juice. I was very satisfied with it.

Service wise.. well they never came back to refill my drink. I'm assuming they stop service when the performance is on. There was a lady out there giving people new glasses of mimosas.

Performance of the gospel group? Absolutely amazing. High energy that got everyone off their feet, and participating with the audience was fun. Everyone was twirling around their cloth napkins in the air.",SwyHccVzUDVH_Je4XBuSYA,1,0,4,GdASN1OJb8fj1sq8xMy2wg

This is a review for the venue not the restaurant.

This is one of my favorite concert venues in Las Vegas. I have seen too many shows to count starting from when I was in high school over 10 years ago. The thing I love about it here is you are able to see the stage from pretty much anywhere and most shows are general admission. It's a small venue which makes it easier to see bands up close. I used to get up in the crowd when I was younger. Ok, I'm not that old now but I enjoy hanging out near one of the side bars drinking a tall boy and watching my favorite bands at the same level. 

The beers are overpriced but really not that bad. They have a wide selection of tall boys and even offer a $5 dollar shot of anything when you purchase one of the tall boys. Mich Ult with shot of Jameson. Yes please! Recently they started serving snack like food in the venue which is nice if you plan on staying a while and drinking. I actually haven't tried any of it since I love going to the Burger Bar before or after shows. 

Whenever I hear that one of the many bands I enjoy is playing at HOB, I get really super excited. The only gripe is that the tickets are managed by Ticketmaster which charges ridiculous fees but that's just something we all have to deal with.",lg5f5JPxo6AjHz-EvW1hVQ,0,0,5,9IB_jJunL6KAZ02nb29OLA

We arrived about 7:45 to find a line forming near one end of the Mandalay Casino by the restrooms.  There was one person checking ID's and giving out wrist bands and moving the line to a second person.  This person was advancing the line as security was checking bags and persons before packing everyone against the wall of the casino.  By this point folks were annoyed as everyone could see how unorganized this process was.  Finally at 8:30 we were moved into the venue like cattle and people didnt know where to go at this point.  There was an elevator that went up, or you could walk downstairs only to take some back stairs back up.  It was confusing because I asked an employee and she gave major attitude as if we should have known the layout of this place.  Also, the elevator only could take about 10 ppl at a time.  Anyway, found my seat and thought this may get better.  The DJ (J-Nice) playing was great, but his set was way to long for a concert to begin.  Lil Kim finally came out and she was good.  Then it was another wait probably a hours or more before R. Kelly came out.  R. Kelly performance was good also.  One of the major problems with this venue is the view of the stage.

When we got here, there was a wait as the place was packed, but was told it would only be 10-15 minutes. We were seated promptly within our wait time, but was too far away from the stage to see who was playing that night. I'm not familiar with the type of music they play here, so I didn't recognize any of the songs, but did enjoy listening to it while we ate.

Our waiter came shortly after we were seated to take our drink order before heading to other tables to check up on them. Since it was a busy night, it took quite awhile for our drinks to come out and for our waiter to come back and take our dinner order. I ordered the House of Blues salad with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The salad was made of fresh greens, red and yellow tomatoes, spicy pecans and feta cheese and topped with a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad tasted fresh and had a good flavor to it. They did add way too much vinaigrette for my liking to my salad. Next time I'll ask for it to be put on the side. The pecans and feta was a pleasant addition to the salad which I normally wouldn't have added. This cost $10. The mashed potatoes were delicious!! Potatoes were of a perfect consistency and had just the right amount of butter, garlic and salt and pepper. Cost $5.

My date got the Pulled Pork sandwich, which came with house made coleslaw and he added a side of fries as well. The Sandwich was full of flavor. There was just the perfect amount of BBQ sauce on the pulled pork. The meat was also done well without it being dry. Cost $14. My date isn't a fan of coleslaw, so he didn't end up eating it. The fries were crispy, but plain. They needed to add more salt and possibly some pepper as well. He ate them, but said he has had better at a fast food place. Cost $5.

Our waiter came by only once while we were eating our dinner. Did try and catch his attention on several occasions, but he was on a constant go between all the tables he was attending to. Finally got our check and it was another 10-15 before he came back with our card. 

Would suggest maybe hiring more help during weekends, holidays and busy times of the year. The food and music was great, but service was slow.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,15,15,4,AmoHChCZHeJYBNl2sYtPMA

It came out well done and a few of the jalapeños were unbearably hot, and he loves spicy food. The sweet potato fries were cold and some actually tasted raw so I'm sure they were frozen fries that didn't cook all the way.

If I have any real issue with this concert venue it is that I am a little bored of it.  Seems that about half or more of the bands I want to see in Vegas are playing here.

The VIP areas are a little annoying, but this is Vegas.  Maybe I've just lived here too long to be outraged by this, but they really aren't in the way of anyone of average height.  The VIP boxes are lower than the bar area so those of us in the back still get a nice view from any of the three bars.

The floor area is of decent size but can be a bit too crowded for some of the more popular shows.  All in all unless you plan yourself behind a pillar the view is good from just about anywhere.

Sound is no better or worse that most places I've been, though I can remember a show some years back where a band blew at least one of the venue speakers mid-set which was obnoxious.",QXk9phQ0wgGuSqla-CHlqQ,1,1,4,xdCDTtI0LwKD69BHAQk8pA

Love the decor of this place, very detailed to create that gothic rock vibe.  Service here is EXCELLENT.  The staff is extremely friendly, relaxed and very attentive.

For the snack, we ordered fried catfish bites with sweet potato fries.  It was delicious!  The catfish didn't have any muddy taste and the aioli tarter sauce they served complemented the catfish well.  Presentation was creative too.  Also, my midori margarita wasn't mixed with enough liquor, but our server offered to mix us another drink or gladly remixed it for us.

For the brunch, it was alright.  I ordered a corned beef hash skillet, but I guess to show they used quality corned beef and potatoes, they didn't chop them up to little pieces but served big chunks of beef and potatoes.  I guess it's just different preferences.  My bf and friend ordered make your own omelette, but I didn't see them rave about it.  However, presentation was good and food was a lot and the our server was friendly and attentive (kept making sure my cup of coffee was filled).  We also ordered some garlic fries which were pretty good.

No where on the menu or stated by our server that they automatically ding you for Gratuity and Entertainment tax.  Our bill was $156 and by the time they added on there extras our bill was $209.  Now wait a minute we had a table of 3 not 8 and the band playing was a local blues band not a big production name.  When I asked our waiter why we had to pay an extra $53 dollars he said I don't know but we have to give tip money to the bar and cook.  THE BAR DID A CRAPPY JOB OF MAKING ANY DRINK!  Charged me $11 for a vodka fruit punch that was water down and taste like grapfruit...which I did not ask for.  The one star was for the waiter who was on our table like an ant to food.

The chicken itself tasted like worn out shoe leather. I followed this by one of Chef Sanchez's signature dishes - a half rack of ribs. One bite into it and I was sorely disappointed. The ribs must have been steamed or boiled. It too was flavorless. To cover this up, it was slathered with a sauce that tasted like ketchup with hints of cayenne.

But a venue inside that is so small does not really need to have to sound turned up to 11.  It gets to a point where you can't really even hear the music clearly.  And though it is supposed to be a non-smoking venue, there is a lot of smoking that goes on.  At least at some of the shows I've been to.  I am not speaking of tobacco smoke either.

The first thing you should know about my most recent trip (and what will be my last) is that someone got stabbed in the crowd.  This is the fault of the venue.  Security is a joke.  When entering I watched multiple go inside after the metal detector wand had beeped.  The overcrowding in the General Admission area certainly didn't help the matter.

Due to the stabbing, security (and later police) roped off an area of about 15 square feet due to it being a crime scene.  This of course didn't help any of the crowding concerns.  The blood puddle was left untouched which is important for the crime scene, and we should be able to continue the show right?  Nope, after 2 or 3 more songs the concert was ended early.

The ticket prices are ridiculous at this venue ($60 after fees for general admission).  It's even worse knowing that the concert still had at least 30 more minutes.  Not only did I feel unsafe because of this venue, but they also essentially stole $20-$30 from me.

EDIT: One employee has contacted me through yelp regarding this review and apologized for my bad experience.  I appreciate it.  I have also sent some letters to some managers and directors as well.  I will try to update further if anything happens.  All that said, the review will remain at 1 star as that was my experience of the venue.  It would take a lot to get me to return and re-evaluate my rating.  I would not re-evaluate without actually returning.

EDIT2: House of Blues has responded to my letter and has sent me a gift card to compensate for my bad experience.  I'm very happy that they responded to my complaints.  Hopefully soon I'll have an updated review and a much better experience to share.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,6,1,1,tIMVTV_kPGzK9CoP_AI0lA

Basically, both the food and drinks were pretty awful. My mom ordered a Mai Tai and I ordered the BBQ Pineapple Mojito. First off, I love mojitos and I especially love pineapple. Unfortunately, my drink was so bad that I couldn't drink it and had to send it back. It was watered down, didn't taste like pineapple, didn't taste like any sort of mojito I've ever had (mint floating in it but didn't taste like mint), and had a funky flavor that was unappealing. The waitress was very nice, apologized, and offered to get me a different drink. I politely declined, since I had tasted the Mai Tai and it was just okay. I had a feeling the rest of the cocktails weren't going to hit the spot. The only good thing was that my mom liked her drink because it was very strong. 

Additionally, my mom was hungry, so she decided to order the Grilled Vegetable flatbread - this had basil pesto, goat cheese, mozzarella cheese, roasted artichoke hearts, broccolini, roasted red onion and micro basil leaves. There was something wrong with this. I took a bite and could not take another. It had an off flavor and I couldn't tell what it was. Maybe the bread? Maybe the pesto? One of the veggies? It was bitter and sour and ... possibly fermented? Not sure. However, since we already sent my drink back, my mom didn't want to send the food back and she continued to eat it but without any gusto or enthusiasm. 

Overall, the place was extremely crowded, the waitstaff was understaffed, the food/drinks were awful, and I don't think I'll be back. If you are in the area, try another place.",XJYFjbH-oTmu2dATTqyauQ,3,2,2,Ey_KkPPo7lm4lMb2SpFSkg

I've been to this restaurant twice now for our usual holiday meeting. We take up the bigger conference room in the back of the restaurant since there are quite a few of us. And both times, my coworkers and I have had an amazing experience. 

Their service is on point here. Our waiters have been super patient with serving a big group like ours. Some of my coworkers are a bit demanding, but the staff was always there to get whatever they asked for. The food always came out within a reasonable time. The portions of food are ridiculous, a bit pricey, but worth it. 

The food here is good. I don't remember what I ordered the first time we were here, but this time I ordered the meatball sliders. The meatball was rich in flavor and the marinara sauce wasn't too tart. The bread still had some crunch from toasting it, which I like. I also ordered the House of Blues salad which I thought was just blah. The lettuce was a little wilted and could have used more dressing. I know my coworkers enjoyed their food since everyone was raving about how good everything was. I did eat a few sweet potato fries from someone's plate. It could have been cooked a little, as they were soft when I but into them.

The bar was the slowest I've seen in years. I gave up after 10 min but luckily a server came by and I ordered from her. The location is impossible to see the entire stage.

First off - this House of Blues is a little different. It's built into the Mandalay Bay casino, so it can be a little disconcerting. Even more odd - the House of Blues preserves the House of Blues theme - in the middle of the gaudy casino floor. So it looks a little off.

All that changes when you get inside. Inside it's your typical House of Blues. Restaurant out front and concert theater in the back. 

We were fortunate enough to be in the ""secret"" James Brown private room that overlooks the stage at the back. We had our own cocktail waitress who brought us drinks all night and we also sampled the menu. 

Of the food that we had I remember the Chipotle Chicken w/ Hominy - Delicious! I recommend ordering this highly. It was so good that you'll want to lick the plate - seriously! 

After the show we rode the elevator all the way to the very top of the casino to go to the afterparty in the Foundation Room. Bottle service was had - very prompt and attentive service indeed. The Foundation room is split into two parts - public and private. The public area has an outdoors area where you can actually go out and look at the strip.

My only complaint is that the middle aged white dudes in there couldn't dance worth a crap and made some very questionable decisions. Additionally, one of them thought it would be a good idea to ""dance up"" on a gogo dancer and got removed from the premises.

I've been here quite a few times since I've lived here for concerts. I've actually been to this venue more than any other in town for concerts. 
The last concert I was here for was just this past Friday (Keane with Ingrid Michealson and FRAN HEALY from TRAVIS). The most recent time before this weekend was in October, so I can't really rate on that experience. I've never actually gone to a concert for the almost sole purpose of seeing an opening act (if you couldn't tell, I was there for Fran from Travis). The tickets for this venue usually cheaper than other places on the strip (these were $28 for GA...however, I paid over $15.00 in taxes and fees for each ticket). I've never encountered a completely sold out show, and the will call window is super easy and doesn't typically require an additional fee.
The box office staff at HOB are great. Very friendly and very helpful, this was no exception. The ticket and front security are also efficient and pleasant. They don't seem to get too upset when you are waiting to get into a show. 
The only staff that aren't always good is the inside security. Often times they get a bit assertive about phones and cameras when their really is no need. However, I can see this as a good thing when people really are out of control...which I've seen a couple of times. As for a concert venue, I really think its odd that they have bathroom attendants. I am at a  standing room only concert where I paid $30 for a ticket...I don't really need a bathroom attendant...I guess its charm. The drinks are priced pretty typically for the strip. I had a 24oz Miller Light for around $8. 
Usually the sound and lights are good. This past concert was not good. The first two acts everything seemed to go okay. But when Keane finally started (after what seemed an eternity) the sound was off, and it never really got clear into  the show. My biggest problems where that a) the staff didn't let us know there was technical issues, despite us being able to see they where having problems. b) they didn't get their stuff figured out  to make the sound better, leaving me (maybe I was the only one) with an incomplete feeling from the show. They finished their set, but I couldn't say I 100% enjoyed the show, despite being a fan. 
If I could I'd give a 3.5 because I've seen some amazing shows here. However, its going to be a 3.0 until I can get back to see they still have their act together.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,2,1,3,ueb8u4q1CO-vqYM0jkA-cQ

Here's the dealio with HOB: For a long time they genuinely were a venue that did absolutely nothing to cater to locals. They jacked up prices and made concert goers pay outrageous random fees. Which, by the way, you will STILL have to pay if you purchase any tickets for this venue on Ticketmaster. A ticket that starts at a base of $25 will end up costing you $37 by the time you finally purchase (no joke here).

So, as a local, I do have the ability to purchase tickets directly at the box office and if YOU are a local, I suggest you do the same. I recently went to see Jimmy Eat World here and purchased my ticket on site. SHOW THEM YOUR LOCAL ID before they punch in the purchase! They will waive the fees AND you will receive a pass that gets you a percentage off of drinks in the venue on the night of the show. YAY! 

The night I went to see JEW, it was an all ages crowd, which is always a little annoying, but I digress. I do think HOB is a nice venue and it is versatile. I have seen many shows here: Ghostland Observatory, Less Thank Jake, Reel Big Fish, and also, Adam Carolla doing stand up. 

The JEW show I think was over-sold. There was just WAY too many people crammed in the venue. HOB has a special vibe, it has a good bar staff and an intimate feel - and you should not have to be crammed up against someone like you're at freaking Warped Tour when you go there.

I really think they should streamline their process of getting in as well. Do I REALLY need to be asked 3 times to show my ticket? Especially when I already get in the venue and have two paper bracelets on my arm? Digging my ticket out of my purse once I've walked down the stairs is just a hassle, and is unnecessary.

Anyway, every concert venue in Vegas over-prices their tickets in my opinion. They know they can get away with it because so many people from out of town come to see shows here, but at least HOB is now offering the locals discount.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,3,-5XF1rWBSvgbdXyH6l7WhQ
4465482,2014-05-12,1,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"House of Blues Gospel Brunch @Mandalay Bay: thank you for ruining both my appetite and my Mothers Day.  My husband purchased tickets for us to attend the first seating of the Gospel Brunch on May 11. We arrived on time at 9:00 only to stand in line for 20 minutes just to get in the door. We were not seated until 9:30, at which point the venue was clearly overcrowded and overbooked with lines of people, tables that were too close together and wait staff that were nowhere to be found.

I decided to sit down to try and wait for the food lines to die down with no avail.  I was one of the last people in line in the traditional food area. Imagine my disgust as  I and a number of people in line discovered that the plates stacked on the table to self serve ourselves buffet-style were actually a stack of used filthy disgusting dishes with old food on them. Every other plate had stuck on food, wet slime and garbage on it. Not sure how such a gross error can be made with a huge catering event...I have been on many cruise ships with 20 times the amount of people served and have never experienced anything like this in a dining establishment in my life. 

I proceeded to take some pictures of the filthy dishes and went to find a manager.  As they looked for the person in charge a couple of bartenders were actually laughing when I told them what happened. I'm not sure what part of a potential outbreak of foodbourne illness is funny. I'm sure the Nevada Department of Health will agree  with me when I call them first thing Monday morning.

One of the busboys was very kind and actually came up stairs to the ticket office and appeared to be genuinely sorry about the whole thing. The on site manager was nice enough but didn't seem too concerned that many other people eating from that buffet line were eating off of dirty plates. What was supposed to be a lovely Mothers Day turned into a nauseating experience. Our money is slated to be refunded  to our credit card but honestly I was so sick to my stomach that I couldn't eat till much later in the day and didn't care about the money at that point.

Obviously he can't stand for 3 hours, so I inquired about seating and explained we will not be partying that night (obviously) and asked if we could bypass the VIP upgrade ($200) to get chairs since he can't stand.  Informed her that we are not jerks trying to ""get something for nothing"",  that whenever their house needs the floor filled that I, as Community School Ambassador to Clark County School District, distribute tickets to teachers. Rudeness of the ""manager"" was beyond anything I've experienced before.

4655454,2016-08-28,5,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"Life and yelping it can be amusing. For example, take my experience with House of Blues (abbreviated HOB). Up to August 2016, I never set foot in one. That changed a couple of weeks past when I saw the Go-Gos in the Boston HOB. So, naturally I reviewed it. Then Yelper Debbie. N has free tix for anybody that wants to see Bee Gees Gold. Because I am a Bee Gees fan, I was like, ""Oh hell yeah!"" Thanks to Debbie. N, a few days later I would be in the Las Vegas HOB. The most amusing thing is that for the first time ever, I would be writing back to back reviews on a chain. 

  HOB is a chain of music venues. It was established at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1992. Two years later, this one opened in February, 1994. This was the Las Vegas version of the music venue in Boston. Both HOBs have the similar setup with the general admission standing only floor, three bars along the U-shaped perimeter, and two balconies. Regardless there were also differences between the two that they weren't cookie cutter. 

  Although life can be amusing, waiting in line at a HOB doesn't fall into this category. There is a need for a sign pointing to the line. We had to ask the restaurant hostess where it is. Then there is another line that seems to be for hotel guests. It seemed that they were nearer the door to get in first. Our line got through the security checkpoint first. Then there is another delay by the door. Then the security dude says that there is no line and everyone goes downstairs. Fortunately aggression was nonexistent. 

   The tix stated the doors open at 7. What time does the show start? Apparently 2 hours later. There was a warm up band that played for around a half hour and the rest was time anticipating the show. 

   The 2 hours wait, in my opinion is a money maker for the HOB to maximize $. The same for using standing room only that gives the perception of overselling tickets. 

   HOB was alive! Music fans of all ages from the Millennial couple to the silver haired grandma's were dancing & clapping away. HOB is upbeat and as far as mood goes it is the anti-blues. 

  On the general admission level, we hung out in the back corner. With the exception of a bench and small restaurant it was standing only. Normally every viewpoint would be intimate if it weren't for the 4 columns. One of them created a blind spot. The venue was packed creating my spot to be the prime real estate with elbow room. My HOB attitude is to enjoy the scene instead of fighting for the ultimate viewpoint. 

   The sound and lighting effects were spot on. The noise level was perfect. The sound was crisp giving the fans a detailed soundscape of the Bee Gees Gold harmonies. The strobe lights complimented the moods that the band tried to convey. 

   The HOB experience ends after the show with the sight of the pit littered with beer cups. Speaking of beer, there is the concern of people throwing beer off the balconies. 

   I never say never about returning to HOB. If that happens I will look into the means to get a table in the small restaurant overlooking the stage. The extra money on dinner and maybe a few cocktails would be worth it to sit down and enjoy live music in an intimate venue.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,18,13,3,jpycQZ7suJZckgtQriiVcw

We were in section 204, last row and we could see everything perfectly. I didn't have to squint or guess who was where. The acoustics in there are awesome!

The long: Went and watched a concert in the venue. One thing that was great and I would advise anyone to do is see if there is the option to pay extra and skip the line especially if you want to get up close. Not only do you get that bonus, but you can then take that money and have it applied to your tab in the restaurant. The venue was almost perfect for the show. The only thing I wish they would have done was have an option for seating in every show. I had a knee surgery and had to stand on the floor in the crowd on that stitched up post surgical knee. I even showed them my giant full leg knee brace and asked if there was a way I could pay extra for a seat and was told no. So needless to say I was in a lot of pain through the show. Once out of the concert we jumped into the restaurant which was pretty full but luckily I thought to make reservations ahead of time. We were seated and waited a good amount of time before I finally flagged down a server for ordering. Apparently the server who was working my area had gone home for the night and they had mistakenly put me in a ""closed"" section. There was a live cover band finishing up in stage who had their volume WAY too loud. Even ordering required screaming at the top of my lungs. Food took a long time to get out and when it finally did it was lukewarm at best. The flavors were all there it just look bad and the temp issue. All in all I wouldn't go back for food (maybe use my skip the line on booze) but would for a concert.

Not all restaurants in Mandalay Bay & Luxor had that restriction, but in a time crunch on our group's first night, and looking for convenience as well as a fun experience, we decided to try HOB anyway. The available options were good, but several of my people complained that they had wanted something from the full menu. I also fielded complaints that our table was too close to the stage & therefore chatting while dining was impossible. I guess you can't please everyone.

Apparently we were able to order anything from the bar, although I chose the Hound Dog Mule from the drink menu. At $17, I expected a larger than typical beverage; however, after I received my small cocktail & re-read the menu, I realized that my drink came in copper HOB cup that I could keep. As a graphic designer, I felt misled by the asterisk & it's 8pt italicized disclaimer; it seemed like HOB was trying to hide that the cocktail alone was $12. This is truly a shame, because how many Vegas souvenirs can you get for $5?! Why isn't House of Blues making a bigger deal about this fun extra? I think they're missing out on big upsells, while I still feel misled by the cocktail menu. And, yeah, this also contributed to my less-than-5-star rating.

They had s decent happy hour going, $5 well drinks and $3 beers.

Came by about 30 minutes before the end of happy hour after a couple of hours gambling in the casino - happy I did as it's much cheaper to spend $3 on beers than lose $100 for a ""free"" one out in the casino ;)   There is a great selection of beers in bottles and the bartender is VERY generous with the pours of liquor.  

The bar was filled with ""cougars"" who kept hitting on my friend - very funny.  Clientele seemed to be a bit older than I usually see in bars I frequent, around 40-60 years old was the average age.",zgDADFTL6rSi6ELUMJPuxw,1,0,4,q868joUi_-BEk_ohb6nwfQ

Happy to find a somewhat affordable place in Mandalay Bay.  We really didn't want to spend $30+pp on a gut busting meal after a long day of travel and being a little before 10pm and wanting a decent veggie option it was tough to find something that fit the bill.

The breakdown:
*Ambiance: cool decor, good music: 4 stars
*Staff: pleasant, helpful: 4 stars
*Food: 
  ---Fiancé got Fried Chicken with potatoes and veggies, said it was flavorful/tender but greasy $17.99: 3 stars,       ---I'm a vegetarian so I got the child's mac and cheese plus a side of veggies, that mac was yummy! $6.99+$3.99 (not bad for a Mandalay restaurant and just the right amount): 4 stars

All in all, we were happy to have found it and if we find ourselves in a similar predicament again we may go- otherwise we'll hop across the strip to the In-n-Out.",VQ4QOFiZ13E4iZhprZfAYw,0,0,4,D7FfwjC4Red-WYo8wJqxeQ

I'm not much of a fan of standing around in the packed general admission area getting shoved around and stepped on.  HOB is pretty small though, so even if you get a GA ticket, its not that bad.  Their drink prices are reasonable too considering it is a concert venue on the strip.

There is a private bar on the orchestra level and the stage can be scene from any position so it's not a huge hassle to get a refill while the show is going on.  I really like the fact that the security are so strict about people sneaking up to the second level if they don't have tickets for seat up there.  That way it never gets that crowded, even for a sold out show. 

Another thing worth noting is the volume level never seems to be too loud or too soft, but just right.  Unlike shows I've scene elsewhere, I have never left a show here feeling like I'd lost 90% of my hearing for a week or so after.

The atmosphere is a bit chain-y, but it's pretty, and the bathroom is really big!
Anyway, everybody liked their entree, and our server was so nice, dealing with our rowdy group. The band was a 90s rock group specializing in girl power songs like No Doubt and Alanis, and I loved it. The sound is great, too.
After too many drinks, some poor girl decided to dance-attack my dad on the dance floor. She seemed lost from her friends. She wasn't wearing underwear....and I can't quite explain the scene when she tried doing back bends in her mini skirt, on my DAD. My mom watched in pure shock as the whole group completely lost it. Not sure if I've ever laughed that hard in my life. What happens in Vegas, goes on Yelp.

He looked at me with a bewildered look and said ""what do you mean?  What packages"". That really was aggravating. He works at the HOB and I'm pretty sure he hears the term packages quite often. He seemed to be playing dumb but knew exactly what I was talking about. I went on to tell him ""the Billy Idol packages.

I read the HOB website that states packages could be added on the day of the event"". Then Jason says ""oh those packages.""  He went on to say that people attending the Billy Idol concerts usually don't buy the packages so they aren't usually offered. He stated ""now for Santana, the packages are offered because people want them"". I said, well I'm only asking because the website said I could add it at checkout and I wasn't given the option. I get it.  If packages aren't offered or no longer available, not a problem. It's the way the message was delivered. His customer service skills were sub par and condescending.

The seating chart looks like everything is the same level and of course they don't tell you when you buy the tickets.  I bought mine in person and both times I ended up by the damn sound booth. My bad. All the seating is close. Not much elbow room. Banquet table seating and you're not facing the stage. Need to turn your chair around to see stage.  Get there early to eat so you can turn your chair around to see show or eat with plate in your lap. After all this place is meant for standup concerts. The saving grace was that both times there was a two person high top table that our server allowed us to sit in.  That puts you up high enough to see over the sound booth. Fortunately my mom is a nimble 90 year old so I was able to get her up in the barstool.   Our server was very attentive removing plates and getting drink orders. Also this is ""new gospel"" so don't expect the ""old school"" back in the day or choir type show.  It also depends on the group. This recent trip was a more modern group.  Lead female singer was more traditional and very animated.  2015 visit was a different group with a lead male singer and a bit more traditional.   There is a lot of ""fluff"" during the show.  Meet and greet.  Birthday, anniversary, wedding and special occasion interaction.  They really only sing tops 8 songs.",AmwIIooGA9lbcXafML5xzQ,0,0,3,ClvQfE7qbkqJpde5YkighQ

i don't understand this place, i don't understand the menu, i don't understand the service, i don't understand why there isn't a daily special on sundays.

i always had the idea before i ever frequented it that the house of blues would be on par with hard rock cafe.  so naive.  it's not that the hard rock cafe is awful, it's that hob is a culinary trainwreck.  gordon ramsey would have a fit.

i think hob food can best be described as ""down home southern cookin'"" or something to that effect.  mac 'n cheese, jambalaya, rice and beans are all on the menu.  the menu is really extensive, and hob dabbles in a bit of everything apparently, but nothing on the menu looked good to me while i was here, and believe me that is saying something because i was STARVING and everything looks good to me when i'm starving.  i finally settled on the mixed field greens and a side of fries.  ""unremarkable"" is my verdict!  i had a few bites of my friend's mac 'n cheese...FAIL.  but that was to be expected, since emmy's spaghetti shack in san francisco has spoiled me for good in the mac 'n cheese department.",qdssYyyQfBJPjIUMEGTykQ,1,0,3,lUmTOXrph_Z2nwO_V0Mv_g

House of Blues Latin nights, Thursdays @Mandalay Bay, no goood :( ENOUGH SAID. lol.

All I can really say is that me and my girlfriend were really hyped to check out this night since there are not a whole lot of Latin nights in Las Vegas, and it sounded even better that it was at Mandalay Bay. I thought it was funny that on this particular night, as me and my girl were on our way over to HOB, we listened to the Dj say on the radio say ""This place is poppin tonight!! Whoop whoop!"" YET when we arrived around at 12:30am,10 minutes before we heard the Dj's announcement, there was a total of 8 people on the dance floor :/ I would say the DJ over exaggerated a bit. 

This was a very disappointing Latin night and what sucks is that this place has SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE GREAT. Great location, plenty of room to sit, a decent sized dance floor, music is perfect, BUT for some reason- NO CROWD!! I dont get it.",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,2,1,k-ralEJ5QSajUgLI4FkUqw

5278385,2015-02-23,4,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"What's one of the best things about living in Las Vegas, you ask? Living in a city where top notch bands regularly make pit-stops to perform, of course! I probably go to House of Blues to see a concert at least once every other month. Just this month I've seen headliners In Flames and Cannibal Corpse at HoB. 

PRICE: One benefit of being a metalhead is that shows are relatively cheap compared to mainstream performers. The average concert ticket ranges from $20 - $60. In Flames, for instance, was $33 per person. 
PRO TIP: If you buy your tickets at the HoB Box Office at least one day before the concert (and you're a local), you get a discount! The discounted prices are ALWAYS cheaper than buying online through sites like Ticketmaster.com

THE VENUE: Overall visibility isn't the greatest. Four stupid beams/support structures get in the way of your view of the stage. Finding a good spot to watch the concert can be difficult, especially for people like me who tend to hangout towards the back of the crowds. Besides the impaired view, HoB has the BEST lighting/stage effects for a concert venue. Acoustics are awesome too. Room wise, I think HoB is the perfect size. I'm always on the General or Standing floor, and that's fine by me. There's 3 (maybe 4) floors. Alls I know is you can't see squat from the highest/top floor. I was forced to watch a Marilyn Manson concert from the top floor once. I could've used some binoculars!  

RULES OF ENGAGEMENT: Mosh pits are tolerated, crowd surfing less so. Vaping is allowed indoors, smoking is not (it depends on if you get caught, though). The standing area immediately in front of the stage gets packed and messy. When pits break out, drinks go flying everywhere. Some a** holes in the VIP area or 2nd floor may throw their drinks out in the crowd. 

PROS: Clean bathrooms, cool stage effects, good acoustics, locals discount.
CONS: Limited visibility and sky high drink prices

RETURN VISIT?
As long as the metal concerts keep coming, I'll pay to see them!!

Well...my thoughts were that that chef should follow the damn recipe that was created!!!!  Service was disappointing  - they just didn't really seem to care.  Once I complained....they stopped bringing refills.  They had a live band on stage - music was way too loud in the restaurant - not the place to go if you want to have any sort of conversation.

A few of us recently came here last Friday for the Scissor Sisters show. We came in late and the only spots left were near the side bar.

HoB does have TV screens to alleviate the obstructed view, but it doesn't help because they recorded it from a far distance.

The band was EXCELLENT!  Understandably the greatest collection of LZ emulators in the world.  But I looked online and found that they let the venue run the sound and lights, and that explains how badly the sound was mixed.  The lighting was fine, but the sound mixer clearly had not been trained on this kind of music...
Zep is known for screaming vocals, awesome guitar, dynamic drums, and a serious baseline.  The mixer seemed to think this was a blues band, needing to boost the vocals massively while muting the base.  Or they had the channels swapped, which is what it felt like - the bass should have been amped up and the vocals should have been relaxed a bit...  When he screamed, which he had to do all the time (duh), it actually hurt my ears!  No, not like the normal live band thing, it really hurt!  In the awesome encore Stairway to Heaven, I watched the bass playing the critical parts which I literally could not hear!  Not quite what I think the songwriters had in mind...

We made the mistake of getting a side of biscuits and gravy to share; they were too pricey ($8) and weren't very good. The gravy tasted like it was made with pepperoni.

We also ordered mimosas which, again, were probably over priced (but it's Vegas, so whatever). Overall, the breakfast hit the spot and the service was good.

There really isn't a bad spot in the house especially with the bar located elevated from the floor. It makes it super easy to have a prime lookout spot over the fans watching on the floor.  Will call is right in front of the venue which makes it super convenient as well. 

The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is the exorbitant price of drinks when you are there. I know this is how they make their money and I fully expect Strip casinos to be charging more anyway. It just seems that it's even higher than the norm. With that being said, I will not be deterred from coming back. Just consider pregaming a bit if you don't want to break the piggy bank!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,9,8,4,mI1OTdf0IbUHi_iaX1cA4A

In all depends on what you are looking for when you go to a concert, but if you like to mosh, then head to the floor in front of the stage.  If you like dining and drinking while you watch the concert, then the first floor at the bar or the reserved tables surrounding the sound system is best.  If you prefer to sit like in a theater, then head to the balcony.  You can also upgrade and get private seating, for a price!  The sound is incredible, the stage is large, the lighting is superb, and its probably the best venue when seeing a concert!  I've seen many concerts here.

It was a unique venue that allowed us to personalize our wedding and add extra details that made it unique and special to us and our guests. There is a stage on one end of the space and a bar on the other. We performed a few songs on the stage and our guests enjoyed the open bar, southern-style food and groovy atmosphere. The wedding coordinator for the HOB, Amber, was a dream to work with. She and she staff were very professional and they helped make our Big Day stress-free.

5465145,2011-06-28,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"My first time going to the HOB Gospel Brunch, and I actually thought this experience was really great.  My advice: get there when the doors open, rush to your table, and go straight for the buffet.  Dump your plate of food on the table and get your dessert from the dessert station.  I say that because (1) the buffet line gets looooong, and (2) I noticed the dessert table right away and thought I would get something later after I ate... but they never refilled the Key Lime Pie and some of the other goodies that were there.

The food: 
Lots of cajun classics, from jambalaya to biscuits and grits. There was also a carving station with a mound of chilled peel-and-eat shrimp.

As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see they had a vegetarian pasta... and it was delicious.  It had a bunch of veggies in it (like brocolli, califlower, tomatoes), and pesto, with melted cheese on top.  That's pretty much all I ate from the main buffet line, besides some breakfast potatoes. The french toast sticks were horrendous...obviously some food service garbage that was freezer-burned.

They also had beautiful fresh fruit, pastries, and mini bundt cakes.  The bundt cakes were chocolate, vanilla, or blueberry  (and I might have seen a lemon or pineapple one on the bottom) and I loved them.

The music: 
I am not a particularly religious person and I knew absolutely nothing about gospel music. Going into it  I thought it was going to be more neutral... more inspirational than religous.  However, it was quite religious. There were tons Amens and Hallelujahs, and Jesus was thanked many times, which is fine - they were doing their thing and I respect that. They even did the classic hymn, ""Amazing Grace,"" and it was beautiful.

The singers and band overall were outstanding, and they sang for at least an hour.  

It was about $40/person which I think is an excellent deal for quality food and entertainment. I would definitely go to the Gospel Brunch again, perhaps at another House of Blues to see how they do it in another city.

F.Y.I. - the noise level was about a 9/10, you couldn't hear the person next to you over the music while you were eating.",thi-jmMx-himXfCw_EuDSw,3,0,4,1GPBiqWYotVIYF5n0eeP-w

But I did order some mixed drink thinking I would like it-- big surprise, I didn't-- and our server swapped it out for a bottle of Bass for me. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it.

Although I'm from Orange County, I'd never eaten at HOB before, and since I was feeling like some cajun/Southern food, it sounded pretty good.

I had a big plate of jambalaya and it was great, but it was HUGE-- there was way too much to possibly eat in one sitting. One full sausage, two chicken legs, a half dozen shrimp, with more chunks of all of the above mixed in. I loved it, but my goodness!

For an appetizer, we also shared the catfish fritters which would have been nothing without the spicy dipping sauce that came with it! The sweet potato fries were the best I'd ever had-- finally a place that doesn't slather them with maple syrup and/or brown sugar. They were crispy and crunchy and delicious.

My boyfriend cleared his pulled pork sandwich off his plate.

We were there for his birthday but didn't really ask whether they did anything for that, so I'm not sure. Overall though, we enjoyed the meal and look forward to trying the HOB in Anaheim. Maybe their service is a little better.",C2LrqqSUDPKZW1AlRcqnuQ,1,2,4,lbwoNK9lLmkveriz_T2hAw

AMAZING.  We woke up rather late and were starving.  One of my friends said ""I'm feeling a big fat juicy burger with mushrooms and avocado and sweet potato fries"" and the next minute four drooling women were on a major mission.  We walked into The Café in The Hotel and saw maybe two burgers on the menu, with overly fancy fixings for $18.  FAIL!  

On our way to get a quick Starbucks, me and another gal checked the menu for House of Blues as we passed by and low and behold- burgers and sweet potato fries for about $12!!!  

Our waiter, Angel, was super sweet and did an awesome job of taking care of us!  

I'm adding this place to the short list for best sweet potato fries, ever!  Sweet, slightly salted, crispy, and delicious and Angel recommended the spicy tarter sauce to go with (SO GOOD).

That meant standing for a good hour and a half before the show started, which was not fun, but the bar was nice enough and the drinks were good. We had dinner before the show in the restaurant, and had a pretty decent jambalaya. It was a little on the mild side for my taste, but otherwise OK. Our server was fantastic.

There was only one bar opened upstairs and the line was super long with only one bartender working. We got a total of five beers and it came out to $80.00 which in my opinion is way too expensive but we had waited in line for so long already that a beer was much needed.

If so, welcome to the world of House of Blues. 

Santana was back at the house of Blues and I have wanted to see him forever so as a Christmas gift I received 2 VIP ticket packages somewhere around $250 a piece tickets that had been advertised to include, Early access to the music hall with advanced seating, a bottle of champagne or wine, chocolate covered strawberries, and a few other things outside of the venue that dont matter here. 

With doors opening at 7:30 we figured we would go to the venue around 7:15 and with the VIP badge we would walk right in. That was in fact the complete opposite. The General admission line to the left of us was simply pooring right into the music hall while we waited in a rope made coral. The hostess told us that they are short handed tonight so there will be a little wait to be seated.. I Can understand a place being short handed so guess that is no big deal right? If this was a 5 minute wait that would be no big deal but we then stood outside while all the others people walked right in for over 15 minutes, Once the lady opened up the rope she got on the radio and let them know table 26 was coming down and she let us know the usher would meet us at the bottom of the stairs and escort us to our table. At the bottom of the stairs we were greeted by a woman that said... Oh you are VIP? go ahead and wait right here and points into the middle of a group of people so we then waited there getting in and out of peoples way for the next 10 minutes. Until an usher finally came to get us to take us to the table. 

Once we got to our table or maybe we should call it our position in the sardine box we waited forerver for the server to come take our order. We ordered the bottle of wine which she did end up bringing to the table pretty quick but said, "" I need to go drop off this other bottle and then Ill be right back to open it up for you"" 25 minutes later she returned to ask how we are doing and that is when I think she realized I was not happy and discovered we had just sat there with an unopened bottle of wine.

The show itself was amazing and Santana is a musical Monster but this establishment is not as Intimate as people say it is, unless you are talking about the fact that you sit so close to the guy next to you that you can smell his breath. My one recomendation would be not to pay for the crazy priced VIP packages, instead, choose to site in the balcony seating, it was comfy movie theater like seats and the view would have been amazing. I may give this place another try for a general admission rock concert or something but definitely not for a seated show like this one.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,3,1,2,WVD4roWq7pYvcub2zU7BZA
5506830,2010-07-26,1,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"I'm pretty much reviewing this just based on the atmosphere....which is really REALLY cool in my opinion. The downstairs is really open, with a bar, a large dance floor, and stage for concerts. The band playing that night was pretty good, and it was fun to kick back on the balcony above it and bop around to the music. I was there for an event, so we had free wine and beer for a bit (although I was only able to take advantage of one free glass of wine, BOOO) and although I didn't personally try any of the food, the guys I was there with scarfed a bunch of spicy-smelling chicken wings and fries. 
The crowd is pretty good, too. Even though it's in Mandalay Bay, right on the strip, it didn't seem to attract your typical bro-man Vegas crowd, at least not the night I was there (which was Saturday).

5520648,2010-08-31,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"House of Blues has tons of shows.  Some of the bands that play here have been on the radio, some of them just have a large underground following.  There are 21+, and all ages shows.  From metal to gospel, there's almost always something worth seeing.  
It can get very crowded here, and mosh pits are not unusual.  Avoid the HOB if you're claustrophobic.  Smoking has been banned inside the show room.  This is great for non-smokers, and not-so-great for smokers.  If you go upstairs for a cigarette during intermission, you're sure to lose your spot for the next band.
Unfortunately the shows here aren't the cheapest.  Tickets can range from $15 to $100+ depending on who's playing, and you can count on paying about 25% more in ticketmaster, and ""house"" fees.  
Security has been an issue in the past.  I've seen people get kicked out for things they absolutely weren't doing (and people NOT getting kicked out for being complete pigs).  I've had shows cancelled after I bought tickets, and have not had my money returned.  Also, I have no idea what determines if a show should be all-ages, or not, but whatever the formula is, it has appeared to be wrong on several occasions (imagine trying to enjoy LMFAO with about 200 ""provocatively"" dressed 13 year olds).
I've seen dozens of my favorite bands here, so I can't complain TOO much.   House of Blues is a bit expensive, pretentious, and unpredictable, but it's still not a bad venue by Vegas standards.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,3,3,3,mrq0BhYF0Z3reVBytaBZKA

We'd usually get there early and camp out on the rocks next to the gift shop entrance so as to have place to sit and wait instead of standing in the line (which would sometimes go all the way to the tattoo shop), because we'd have to stand once we got inside, as well.
The concert venue is nice, though the beer is expensive... though beer is always expensive in Vegas, and at concert venues, so I suppose that comes with the territory. The bands we saw play always sounded great, and the security personnel were professional and friendly. They weren't there to hassle you, just there to make sure everyone started out and remained okay during their time there.
I wore a kilt to several of the concerts and did get a few odd looks from the people running the metal-detector lines, but I'm used to it so that's not a big detractor.
Overall, I'd gladly see more concerts here, though Santana has a capacity to run long from time to time so if he's nearing the end of a stint or going on tour in the near future (and thus abdicating his spot for a few weeks), be ready to wait longer in line as they get everyone out and the place cleaned up for the next act. Or, if you're there to see Santana, be prepared to order an extra drink when he runs long. It's all good.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,0,0,4,J_mp-k9zizibdec8uJTfZw

We've been here twice (both times to see Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers perform) and I will say that the venue itself is awesome!  Very cool vibe - open and spacious, although it still gives you the feeling of being small.  The decor and lighting makes you feel as though you are transported to a different city.  For us - we prefer standing room for concerts - so you can move in closer and the setting is more intimate. It almost seems as you are at a private concert with just you and the band.  The crowd really gets into it - and the bands feel the energy!  Although our friends have told us that HOB Las Vegas can get shoulder to shoulder crowded for events, both times we've been there it has been perfect.  

The bar area is elevated, with stairs or a ramp leading you down to the floor area.  Even being 5 ft 2 I never felt like I had to struggle to see over the person in front of me.  The sound quality is also awesome!

The only complaint I have, with that of any concert venue, is the bar and beer selection.  Although it was super easy to get a beer (no lines) the prices were pretty ridiculous.  $26 for two Coronas (okay - so they WERE king cans of Corona) but still - a little insane.  But again that's expected when you're out to see a concert.

A definite plus is that being a Vegas venue - the band was able to play past midnight (almost 3 and a half hours), unlike a lot of places where they are cut off early!  House of Blues in Vegas is one of our favorite concert venues!",CK6w4REQliKRmBtJ-YArOA,1,1,4,CD7S4SDVhngClRhECebsSA

The venue is easy to find from Mandalay Bay's parking garage. Just go into the casino, proceed past the Light Nightclub and enter the casino floor. Turn your head left and TA-DA! Huge lights saying ""House of Blues."" So let's get to the main part of the review.

Venue: The venue is actually quite small in terms of stages. It has an upper floor with seating for other shows besides for concerts, but I'm rating it strictly as a concert venue. The floor is surrounded by a bar area, so drinks are easily accessible at any time. As far as concerts go, I prefer smaller venues to bigger ones because they seem more intimate. Being able to feel ""close"" to the band as they perform no matter where you are is pretty neat. That means you won't miss a beat! (Haha, music joke) They put up guards at the front of the stage during concerts, as do most places and they actually make a really good place to lean on between sets if you are lucky enough to be in the front and don't plan on moving anytime soon. It is also nicely decorated. I love the chandelier that they have, in the middle of the place, the tinted glass windows and the whole vibe the place gives off. It makes a great rock band venue. 

Service: The people that work here, from the times I've been there are nice and personable. I mean, come on, it's hard not to be when you get to see free shows, right? Right. In any case, booze is always easily accessible. The cool part is that during concerts, if you are one of those lucky people against the guard rail right in front of the stage, a waitress comes around between the guard rail and stage to take drink orders so you don't have to move. BONUS! I didn't get anything to drink though, because drink prices in venues scare me. To rich for my blood. The actual people in charge of watching the event let you have a little fun, but do the appropriate thing when bad stuff goes down. They also help crowd surfers. 

This is a great place to go see a concert, especially if you are a rock fan. The mood, atmosphere and small venue make it easy to mosh, drink, and/or enjoy yourself. If you know somebody coming to Vegas and feel like going to the show, hopefully you get lucky and get the House of Blues. :)",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,0,0,4,fjTF0tMB5kFMiGGec8a93A

I was so  impressed on how fast they responded to the situation at hand.  They were very apologetic,professional,accommodating and they went above and beyond to turn a bad situation into and AMAZING memory.  I have told numerous friends,family and clients about my incredible  experience and how the House of Blues rocks.  What could have been disaster, has now made me a bigger fan and I can't wait to go back. The Venue is AWESOME , very intimate,and the service was outstanding.

5642863,2014-09-25,0,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for a conference and we had a private event here one evening.

The food was pretty good.  Sliders were tasty (pulled pork and meatball were the best...angus was just ""meh""), the shrimp and grits were delicious, as was the jambalaya. 

Bartenders were great, drinks were good and the music selection had everyone dancing.  The place has a cool look and vibe.

So why only two stars?  This HOB suffers from the same issue as the one in Chicago.  The music is deafening!  I was standing beside someone trying to have a conversation (after all, this was a social event in connection with a conference) and as we were shouting at each other to be heard, they actually turned the music up!  We just looked at each other and laughed because even though we were three inches from each other, there's no way we could continue the conversation.

Thankfully, one of the big cheeses from the conference was able to get them to turn it down a notch about 10 minutes later but by the time I left, my ears were ringing and my voice was hoarse from shouting.  

If there's a live band, I guess that's one thing but just cranking it up so loud that everyone has to stand there with no interaction because it's physically too loud to converse, that's not terribly fun in my book.  I guess this must be a corporate decision since the loud music seems to be consistent but I don't think I'd choose to go to another HOB in the future because I actually like to interact with the people I go out with.  Except maybe in Houston, because that location was okay.

Side note: If you search for the word ""loud"" in the reviews, you get 26 hits.  Most of them complain about it being too loud.",wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,2,0,2,VRHB1Kmf7sj0hNUJDi5PTA

The service was poor and the food took forever to come out even on a night when the place was only half full. The noise level was obscene.

The venue seemed nice, and we thought we had decent seats since we were in the 3rd row back (section 200 row C) however upon sitting down found that the incline and the safety bars obstructed our view to a degree that we almost never could see anything on stage without the bars in the way. Not sure why they dont have clear glass railings? Ticketmaster didnt mention obstructed view so you may want to see if there is a seat map showing if there are obstructions, definitely would have paid more $$$ for a seat that I could see!

Disappointing sound quality, speakers were not always clear.

Last night was the first time we have been there in a couple months, and were severely disappointed.

To start the night off poorly, the hostess placed us, essentially, on the casino floor in the farthest table from the stage. We asked if we could have one of the empty tables closer to the stage, being told ""no, there is no server for that section."" Before our drink order was taken, there were people seated at those empty tables.

Then, looking at the menu, we were even more disappointed and aggravated. We expect to pay more than normal restaurant prices to eat at House of Blues. However, $3.99 for an ice cream scoop of luke warm/cold mashed potatoes and the same price for an equal amount of snap peas is asinine. 

Their entire menu has drastically gone up in price and down in selection. None of the good items are available anymore.

The only reason two stars got marked, after talking to one of the floor managers, she apologized at the illogical reason we were not permitted to sit at quality tables, moved us to a better section and comp'd us some drinks and dessert. Our servers were also pretty on top of things.

The second time I was like meh.  It was just totally bland but edible the second time.  Husband got the biscuits and gravy the first time and some sort of chorizo and egg dish the second time with a pancake.

5745875,2012-11-11,2,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,"Ahhh the good ol' HOB. Man..I remember when this was THE concert spot ..the ultimate place to see your favorite performer and also the ultime spot for a performer to play.

I can start my review off memories , some blurry because of the alcohol , contact high or simply because I was in a musical orgasm; However it would not be fair for the readers

The place is small. Lets face it. You will end up tasting the sweat of the person right next to you .I can tell you the night before going to a HOB concert I pray to the Gods that the people around me decided to take a shower before the event.

On the flip side..small means close..close means better vibe..better vibe means awesome show! So if you are ok with all that.. it is still a very cool venue specially if you choose to sit on the balcony where there are movie theater kinda seats .

Sound is outdated. Sadly to report they seem to not want to upgrade the speakers nor their (speakers)location. Usually they have to retune , or the sound is simply not that good. The place have a lot of wood which is great for sound..but when you have the same speakers that ""the wonders"" from ""that thing you do"" had..then you are pretty much done.

They are selling food now.Hot dogs pizza , etc. And the price is actually pretty damn good for being inside the venue that is inside a casino. It amazingly tastes pretty good as well(for concert food of course). Food tends to go fast and wait time might be a little long but I think its pretty awesome to have the availability .

Drinks are just ok. Sometimes you get that water downed vodka and cran, but they will NEVER forget to charge you more than 12 dollars for it. Seriously HOB? I mean you are selling 5 dollars pizza but a 12 dollars Barbie sized cocktail? On the flip side..they sell tall boys and that's what I stick with

This place is where its at right now due lack of investment and love from its owners . Music artists don't want to play where they know their concert is not gonna be up to par. People don't want to go to weak concerts and then the whole chain reaction starts.Trust me ;the concept is awesome and I love the feel of a private venue, without the crazy expensive ticket price and with a cool ambiance. Im sure if HOB decides to take care of their spot , all this could change.

There are a couple of bars and steps down to the floor, sound is great and you cannot fail to get a good view from anywhere. I ordered  a Heineken and a Chardonnay for wifee. The Heineken came in a can which was enormous , almost a keg and the wine came in a tiny plastic 'glass'. I was happy, wifee not so much!

their waffle and pancake station was great. the mini-waffles are my all-time favorite of the meal. mmm, pair it up with fried chicken and it's a match made in heaven. especially if the chicken is all you can eat AND positioned strategically between the cheesy grits and old bay boiled shrimp! those were the real stars of the brunch in regards to savory food. they also have meat carving stations (this time it was smoked turkey and marinated flank steak), a dessert station, build-your-own bloody marys, unlimited bellinis and mimosas/beer (sorry, didn't partake).

entertainment was fun and touching. st. paul's children choir performed and their voices carried strong. coupled with the energy and audience participation, this event turned out very well.",fQuLe-KuojSco4DRbcFpGw,2,2,4,Cdkk3yFGKNEdO1aW75Rabw

I'd love to be able to give the restaurant 3 1/2 stars, but the service and management was so exceptional that I'm bumping it up to 4.  

We were two couples, and it turned out that we all decided to order the same thing, the Turkey Burger.  One of our friends is allergic to tomatoes, and told the waitress that they absolutely had to be left off.  We waited quite a while for our food to be delivered, and even though we'd gotten to the restaurant with time to spare before the concert, we were getting nervous.  When the food was delivered, you guessed it, the tomatoes were sitting on his burger, and it needed to be sent back.  The waitress was completely apologetic and stated that she absolutely told that to the kitchen.  We believed her, and it didn't take too much time for his food to come back, this time prepared correctly.

We all agreed that it was the best turkey burger any of us had ever eaten; no gamy taste whatsoever, and it had stuff mixed into the meat.  It was a little bit spicy - a good thing!  It kicked up the blandness of the usual turkey burger, without the kitchen having to oversalt it to give it some taste.  The fries that came with it were crisp and delicious, and there was a little dish of sweet and spicy pickles, something I'd never tasted before, and really loved.

What happened next was totally unexpected:  the manager came over, unbidden, and apologized for the mix-up.  He invited us to come back after the performance and enjoy dessert on the house.  And then the charge for the Mistake Burger was removed from the bill!  And that's in addition to the discount from the certificate we had.

The performance was a whole 'nother matter.  After being searched and branded, er, banded, we went upstairs where we were ushered to comfortable seats.  No standing room for us, with our free tickets!  A DJ on the stage was playing some Trance-type music.  I normally like this stuff, but I was waiting for ""Brazilian"" to start.  8:30, 9:00, 9:30, nothing except that DJ and a lot of heavy bass.  Nobody downstairs seemed to be moving to it, and I, who normally can't sit still when rhythm is happening, was getting completely bored.  The girl next to me said the show was going to start at 10, even though our tickets said 8:30.  When 10 pm came and went, and nothing changed on the stage, we all decided that dessert would be much more interesting.

We returned to the restaurant, where our same waitress cheerfully served us delicious Key Lime pie, coffee and tea, and no bill save for the tip we left her, and we left sated and happy.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,2,4,6b__PXQyg4NJaLZD55BlVQ

House of Blues is conveniently located inside of the Mandalay Bay Casino floor, the exterior or HOB is very beautiful, decorated with a musical theme since they do have a concert area, aside from a restaurant and some designs made out of bottle caps. Very nicely done.

You need to be seated by their hostesses, when you walk into HOB you will enter their gift shop section first before being introduced to they restaurant area. Which had a nice dark and interesting atmosphere,  with a huge false tree structure covered with lamps. There were glass colored windows and a bar inside. Their bathroom was also filled with art paintings, the women's stall made out of an old classic truck bed metal (reminds me of my childhood in Hawaii) it was very creative.

For appetizers we started off with steak tacos, it was very tasty and at the same time healthy. For our main course I ordered Shrimp and Grit which was perfect, the grit melted in my mouth, it came with jumbo shrimp and the sauce that came with it was very delicious and went along with the grit perfectly. My husband had Mac and cheese with lobster which was good also, we were expecting a whole lobster, but this dish came with the lobster pieces that came inside the macaroni in cheese, it was still delicious. The kids had chicken tenders with fries, the grandparents said the ""this is really good chicken!"" So, I'll believe that. Our server was cute and informative, and so were every employee there, everyone looked young and good looking, must be, a must to work here. I have brothers and a step dad that bartend/ed and served here. Hehe

We didn't have room for desert as to we were all surprisingly full, the portions looked little but don't let it fool you. I'm 8 months pregnant and was very full, my husband told me I waddle, well after this dinner, I waddled more.

This place is great for dates, family dinners and date with friends; Especially if you're a local, if you want to hit the town, if you kind of want to go into the strip, but not really?

I'll focus on the venue and not get distracted by the major girl fight that occurred... which was quickly ushered off the stage (go bouncers, go!).  PS - the bouncer right in front is huge.  Don't you dare think of climbing on stage.  

The main floor appeared mostly packed, so we chose a spot right behind the railing by the upper bar.  View was good - a bit confused by the VIP (maybe?) area behind the sound booth where a few people were hanging out.  Sound quality was a bit muffled, but maybe I just had a hard time understanding the lyrics and the banter onstage.  Still, it wasn't the most superb.

I spotted two bars, one close behind where I stood... there was plenty of room for purchasers at the bar and the crowd watching the show from the higher level; the second bar was on the left side of the room.  Both bars were extremely overpriced considering the liquor prices in Vegas, so I opted out.

a late night concert in Vegas easily.

When we arrived the lady asked if we would be dining and I said yes.  We also need a table for 4 as friends would be joining.  When we sat down the waitress came over and gave us menus.  I said we would be waiting for our friends to arrive before ordering.  About 15 minutes later our friends arrived.  

The waitress asked if we were ready to order.  No not yet they literally just sat down.  A little bit later a woman who I presume was the manager came over and told us if we didn't order we had to move.  Ok first of all the rest of our table had just arrived a few minutes before.  I explained to her we were going to order but just not yet.  She was extremely rude and said again if you don't eat you have to move.  I explained AGAIN we are going to eat quit rushing us!  Wow!  We were mortified!  She said they needed it for reservations.  There was- at any given time 3-5 available tables.  At no time were they all full.  Busy but never full.  

Any how we ordered food and it was subpar.  My friends gumbo looked more like dog food and was not even edible.  During that time our daughters were performing on stage.

Then a different waiter came over and said it was shift change and he had our check.  Well a) we specifically asked for separate checks and b) I still planned on ordering for my kid so was not ready to close out my bill!  He was very nice and I definitely do not blame him for the mixup.  

Anyhow we were leaving soon and someone put a ""reserved"" tag on the table.  Again with the rushing!  Sad to say that unless my daughter has another event there I will not be back.
