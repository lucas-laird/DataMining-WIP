As my party of five walked in the doors I smelled a very strong, awful perfumy smell coming from the bathrooms which are right by the entrance. They do this to try to cover up a sewage smell coming from the restrooms but instead now smells like sewage and bathroom perfume mixed together. We decide to stay but try to get a seat in the back of the restaurant to avoid the smell. They had just opened so it was not busy at all but the two waitresses totally ignored us as we waited to be seated. I walk towards the back of the restaurant to get the waitresses attention when she starts just yelling and pointing ""you no sit yourself, you go back there and wait."" She yelled making the other two tables of people look up. So very rude. We left and will never come back.

The dried tofu and spinach were really bland and lacked all flavor.   When questioned if it was a popular dish, they said yes and when he asked for feedback I said it was not too good, he said he could of made it more tasty...?!?!?!?!  I was confused.

Having lived in Shanghai, I'm incredibly picky with my xiao long bao (steamed juicy buns). China MaMa's juicy buns are, without a doubt, the best in Las Vegas. The skin is delicate and not overly doughy like many other restaurants and the perfect amount of soup inside each bun is flavorful. The owner told us that they grind their own meat rather than purchasing pre-ground meat in order to ensure that only fresh, relatively high-quality meat is used in the buns; you can definitely tell the difference. 

Other things to try are the Yuxiang Eggplant (which is listed on the typo-filled menu as Eggplant in Garlic Sauce), the Tianjin Buns, and the Scallion pancake. The folks at the table next to ours ordered what's listed on the menu as ""Hand Pulled."" It's a roti-like bread that looked oily but tasty.

In addition to homestyle Chinese food, China MaMa offers BoBa (which I have yet to try) and the cleanest bathroom of any Chinese restaurant I've been to in Vegas.

I think I just ordered the wrong dishes....I had salt and pepper shrimp.  It came with some nasty thick coating of batter, no shell or head.  

The second dish we ordered was the tofu and shrimp balls.  I was more curious and intrigued about the tofu and shrimp balls because I love tofu and shrimp and because it was sooooo expensive ($16.90).  I wanted to find out why it was so pricey and was it worth the price. It was quite interesting and not what I expected, obviously home made which is a plus.  It was nice and crispy on the outside but a strange texture on the inside: mushy and flavorless.  Not sure I would order it again.  It seemed labor intensive, but not worth $17.

The third dish we ordered was the napa cabbage with shrimp paste. It was pretty tasty and the only reason why I give this place a two star rather than a one star rating.

I ordered the mini wonton soup, and the green scallion pancakes. The broth on the soup was light, but flavorful, and the wontons were VERY tasty. I might be mistaken, but they put either shredded cloud ear mushroom, or seaweed in the soup, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was not overly kelpy, as Japanese seaweed is really overpowering to me.

The scallion pancakes were the BEST i've had in Las Vegas, and the best i've had in years. I used to order this in LA, at this one hole-in-the-wall place and China Mama's totally brought me back to those days. Slightly chewy, lightly crispy, the flavor was a perfect, delicate green onion flavor that i'd forgotten i'd been missing for SO LONG.

The food here are consisted of mainly northern China dim-sums. They have many small dishes of marinated food on the menu. These are great as appetizers. One of my favorite is spicy pig leg. 

They also have noodles, and homemade dumplings. Their shredded chicken cold noodle is pretty good. Their pork dumpling is also my favorite.

So, this is a great place to taste some interesting food you normally won't find elsewhere. The place is nicely decorated and clean. The prices are reasonable, mostly around $5-$6.

674060,2011-06-05,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Wanted a light lunch, and went in to try the xiao long bao today, about 2 PM.  There were five other tables w/customers already there.  (By the time I left, two other parties came in, for a total of 8, including me.)  Had ordered, and the xlb came out a few minutes later.  They were tasty, with a wee zing of ginger, and had a nice broth within.  After I finished my meal, I was ready to pay, and that's where the problem for me began.

After eating, I was thinking one of two things:  the check comes to me, or I go to the register.  After waiting a few (10?) minutes, I decided to go to the register.  The owner (?) saw me, and said to have a seat, that he would bring me the check.  So, I did and read the local LV magazine I brought in with me.  Another 10 minutes pass, and I've finished the magazine, sitting there drinking tea.

During that time, the waitress saw me doing nothing, other than sitting, with my elbow on the table and chin in my hand.  The owner, who had been going back and forth from the register, was helping the table in front of me.  He finally noticed/remembered that I was sitting there, waiting for my check the SECOND TIME he came around to help the same table.  Finally got the check, left money and I couldn't get out of there fast enough.

A couple of things, before you think I'm too harsh.  As a child, I used to work with/for my father in a pub, and then in a restaurant he managed.  I understand what it is to be part of the staff of a restaurant.  And, for the last 22 years, I've been doing nothing but customer service, so I'm familiar with the concept.

Look, I don't expect wait staff to be jumping for joy, trumpets playing upon my arrival.  Basic customer service, and I'm happy.  Go above that, and I remember.  Go below, I can forgive but I never forget.  I would come back here only if someone else was paying.  On my own dime, not at all.",hHhSmytOPwOfbsIPQrbtzg,2,0,1,2765ZYdkJTRsa-3XY-II3g

We ordered 5 items- chicken and corn soup, crispy beef, szechuan lamb and vegetables in a clay pot, combination chow mein, and tea smoked duck.  The soup was normal.  Everything else was really good.  Based on the waitresses recommendation, we got wide noodles which tasted like rice noodles.  It was really really delicious.  The lamb in a clay pot had noodles in it which surprised me.  The spice was good, but there was a kick there that had something I didn't like.  I did not like the crispy beef.  My friend loved it because she says it tastes like candy.  It did, but I'm not a sweet fan.  I really really loved the tea.  It tasted really good. I even asked the waiter for the name of the tea.  It's Jasmine Green Tea.  It's absolutely amazing.  

The service was okay.  We kind of waited for a minute or two before getting seated.  They checked up on us several times while we were deciding what to order.  Our food took a long time or maybe I was just really really hungry. After our food arrived, they didn't really check up on us/ refill our waters.  The waitress did ladle our soups for us.

If nothing on your menu is special, why should I feel compelled to come back here!? Please, it's not like you work for the DMV - you can at least PRETEND to like your job. A little honesty always wins points, but try to sell your product, too! Minus a a star.

779572,2013-09-07,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Let me start off by saying that I use to frequent this place when it first opened a couple of years ago. I love Xiao Long Bao's and beef noodle soup, and this place has all of that and more. Service was always decent and food tasted great. However, the most recent visit has left me not wanting to come back EVER.

My family and I came for lunch one afternoon and it was semi-busy. We stood at the front and while the waiters saw us, they were a bit busy to greet us, no big deal. After a few minutes, one of the waiters asked us in Mandarin ""How many people?"" My family is Cantonese Chinese, my parents can speak Mandarin, but I know very little Mandarin. I told him the number of people in our party with my fingers and he said something in Mandarin that I didn't understand and unfortunately my mom wasn't paying attention so she didn't hear him, but he pointed his arm out to an empty table in the corner gesturing for us to be seated. Assuming he wanted us to take a seat, we all sat down at the table in the corner. Then the waiter came to set up the plates and utensils. But when he saw us sitting down, he stopped and gave us a dirty look and said in perfect English, ""Uh, can you at least let me set the table first???"" How disrespectful and unprofessional is that? First of all, it's rude for you to assume that every Asian-looking person speaks Mandarin and second of all, you were the one who gestured for us to sit. And lastly, there are much more polite ways of asking a customer to get up while you set up a table. Regardless of if you were having a bad day or not, that's not how you treat a customer. In most of the Chinese restaurants I've been to, it's normal for waiters to start setting your table after you've been seated, I don't know why he had such a problem with us sitting down. 

At that point, I should've walked out, but I was thinking the food would be the saving grace. We ordered beef noodle soup, Xiao Long Bao's, Shanghai-style rice cake, a tofu dish, and a cold meat appetizer dish, only the Xiao Long Bao's and tofu dish met my expectations. The beef noodle soup lacked flavor or spice, the Shanghai-style rice cake was more onions than rice cake, and the meat appetizer was too oily, really disappointing from the previous meals I've had here. The only positive thing from my lunch was our waitress, she was actually polite and attentive.

Then our waitress started using various tactics to get us out even though the restaurant wasn't supposed to close until 10pm. First she gave us takeaway boxes even though we had just begun our dinner and we didn't ask for takeaway boxes. Then 5 minutes later, she asked us to settle the bill.   Then a few minutes later, she started to rudely and loudly clear our plates while we were still eating. Since my friend's 9-month baby was asleep, we asked the waitress to clear the plates less noisily, at which point she told us that they want to close up the restaurant by 9:30pm.  When I explained to her that she should have told us before we sat down and ordered our dinner, she started scolding us.

I DID NOT LIKE the soup/shanghai dumplings. They were too meat-y or something! not enough soup and not enough of flavor that makes you crave more. The texture felt too rough or something, kind of like a meatball -which is not what I'm looking for when eating at a Chinese restaurant! 

I DID LOVE the beef noodle soup and the string beans! Two of my staples when I eat Chinese food and they did it just right. It wasn't too salty or saucy and the dishes were extremely authentic. I also tried these beef rolls for the first time and just thinking about them makes my mouth water!

Driving around China Town with an empty stomach and time to kill is like playing with house money, only spicier.  I rolled a YO-leven tonight when I stopped in for dinner at China Mama, Cha ching!.  I
I walked in, got some friendly hellos, sat in a comfy booth, and was served some delicious, piping hot jasmine tea.  So far so good.


Following some yelpers suggestions, I went with the scallion pancake, and the black bean noodles.  There are prints of Koi fish all over the walls by the way.....in case you were wondering what type of fish print was going to be on the walls.  

The Food:

Green Onion Pancake - It's a thin, fried pancake with chopped green onion.  It reminded me of the Korean seafood pancake (Haemul Pajon) but without the seafood.  I thought it was a lot better when I dipped it in chili paste, so be sure to ask for some, it's not on the table. 

Black Bean Noodle - The lo mein noodles were nice in texture with enough bite to not be mush in your mouth.  They were topped with the black bean sauce, which has whole black beans in it, cucumbers and scallions made for a nice dish once it was mixed around. I found the black beans to be a little sweet, almost like an adzuki bean.  It was a new flavor for me, and not really my type of party.  

The menu is huge and authentic, the service was very good, and to top it all off, I got a pretty solid fortune in my fortune cookie.  It read, ""Hey, Steve, I'm proud of you, love cookie...""

When I finally got my food, which she just handed to me, she then said, ""Do you need...?"" and just continued with that employee. During that time she told me he was new and obviously the priority. I could care a less. I asked her what was she asking me earlier and that she didn't finish. She said oh  do you need forks or spoons then got right back to the employee. I was pissed. I then said isn't your customer a priority and thanking them rather than just handing them a bag and ignoring them. She didn't say anything. I said I hope you train your employees right an not the way you are treating customers. The new employee thanked me. I feel sorry for him. Later when I ate the food, I got bad stomach pains. I tried not to assume it was the food. However, I tried it again the next day, and the same thing happened shortly afterwards. I tossed the disgusting stuff out after that.

After reading some of the less than 4 stars reviews, all I can say is ""you don't know Chinese food and  you don't know squat bc you're...(something regarding your race...lol).  

I for one have been living in Las Vegas for 7 years and have been trying to find something comparable to what I grew up eating, and this is the PLACE!  My dad is a chef and we owned a few restaurants in Taiwan, so I know real food when I tas te it!  THIS IS IT.... if you are looking for something authentic and delicious!

We started off with some layered pancakes, which came out soft and crunchy...contradicting isn't it...(lol)?  It was nicely crisp on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside,.  Unlike most Chinese pancakes I've had, it's not flat but it looks like it's swirl layers with no green onions ( I suggest dipping it LIGHTLY in soy sauce).  The hot tea was jasmine, which was the perfect flavor and scent!  The entrees we ordered was 2 X rice & fried pork chops, beef stew noodle soup and pork/pickle noodle soup.  It has been forever since I've had rice & fried pork chop and it's was delish!  Pork chop was cooked well and tender to chew, lightly battered so you are not eating battered.  It wasn't greasy and chewy!  Abundant rice, with side of soy egg, Chinese sausage and sweet Chinese pickle.  The beef stew noodle soup came with spinach and I suggest order the thick wide noodles (as they are homemade).  The soup base is perfectly flavored, not too salty and you can taste the delicate spices that makes the broth so drinkable delicious!  Finally, the pork/pickle noodle soup, my brother ordered the thin noodles, which is good but I would suggest going with the thick wide noodles.  The broth was clear and light; you can taste the salty and the slight sweetness from the pickle but it's well balance.  The pork is sliced thin and again, cooked perfectly and the pickle is still crunchy being in the broth.

The beef rolls were also one of the other few high points in an underwhelming  dining experience. They were also seasoned with 5 spice and cilantro but the beef inside was brushed with a sweet sauce that worked well with the grilled wrap.
The rest of the dishes we tried were basically the same vanilla Chinese I find here in a lot of the Vegas local scene. Stick to China Town staples like Joyful House, Diamond China etc.",UXgJuH1aOINWD96WrawSAA,0,0,2,GpV2ygyZcWDws0gW1NByvg

Beef noodle soup - I am from socal, and so I'm a tough judge when it comes to decent chinese food, but the beef noodle soup here was really top notch.  We requested the thick noodle, which was nice and chewy, and didn't get soggy at all in the soup.  The noodles were REALLY wide, like pappardalle-esque.  There was also a good amount of spinach in the soup, which was nice, and the beef chunks were well-seasoned and not overly fatty.   A++++. 

Soup dumplings - These were probably the best made dumplings in terms of sturdiness, that I've had in a long time.  They have a good amount of soup inside, and they skin is just firm enough that it doesn't just fall apart the moment that you pick it up.  The only gripe I have about them is that they meat inside wasn't super yummy - it was ok, but the pork they used was kind of dry and clumpy.  I think it was minced pork, as a previous reviewer said.  B+

Foo Chi Fay Pien (cold spicy meat dish) - This was probably our least favorite.  The seasoning wasn't the usual kind that you see with this dish, and it was really just oily with no depth of flavor to it.  Plus, they didn't have the peppercorns in there, which is one of my favorite parts about this dish.  C-

Crispy beef - This was what the waitress recommended that we order, and while it was tasty, I probably wouldn't get it again.  I think this is the dish that put China Mama on the map as far as the american magazines go (there's a picture of it up in the front).  It's pretty much really thin pieces of beef stir fried to a crisp with lots and lots of spicy red peppers.  The dish itself is not so much spicy as it is sweet (a little too sweet for me).  The beef bits were really crunchy and delicious though, so if you're in a sweet and sour type mood with some added crunch, this may be the dish for you.  B+

Cold seaweed salad - This was seasoned perfectly, and really really delicious.  Not too oiliy and not too salty, and a really nice refreshing pick me up for all the other heavy dishes.

There were also some other interesting items on the menu which we didn't order, like the beef roll, and the red bean pancake dessert, which I definitely want to try.  While prices were a bit higher than I had hoped, I think it's worth it if you're looking for some authentic chinese food.  Overall, I'd say you can't go wrong as long as you get some of that beef soup noodle.  Just stay away from the cold meat dishes!",7VhXchEryix_jrWv3ziRZg,0,0,4,-Fy3cRS-cs_2b-oIvGc7fw

Don't be fooled by the exterior of the restaurant, the outside looks a little rough but the inside is very nice, clean, looks new and nicely decorated. The space is pretty big, good for small and large parties. Staff were very nice, food came out pretty quick, only waited quite a while for the check when they got a little busy and only a few people working. 

The changed the menu too, a lot of the same items but prettier, more pictures and nicer looking. We were seated quickly, water and tea are brought out immediately, I got the cold soy milk which tasted very good, not too sweet!

We got the juicy dumpling which we thought were soup dumplings, but there was not much soup in the dumplings, which is fair since the dumplings are described as ""juicy dumplings"" not ""soup"" dumplings. Got the Mama's special fried pork buns, these were delicious! Dough is soft and fluffy, good pork and onion stuffing, crispy fried on the bottom, a little oily but delicious anyway! 

We also tried the giant bone marrow soup, this was so good! Huge portion, big enough for up to 5 people, large bone in the middle to pic the meat off of. Soup tasted very sweet and savory, healthy but not bland. Definitely recommend trying the soup.

The pork stuffed pockets were good but a little bland, I prefer the beef rolls. Spicy wontons were good but not spicy, came in a very small bowl but contain a bunch of little wontons (very cute), topped with fried garlic and chili oil, not spicy but very good. 

I plan on coming back and trying their entrees, saw eggplant with garlic and pork belly with leeks on the menu, looked really good, will try next time!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,4,iosq9xZT9FeMn6VDx3AK-A

My girl warned me, but I proceeded to order it anyway. Yuck. The sesame noodles were pretty good too. The service is spotty at best. It's hard to get someone's attention to get refills on water and tea and our vegetable dish came out at the end of our meal, after we were already done with all of our main dishes. I think it would have been better if they timed the dishes a little better than that. Also, the temperature inside the restaurant is kept unnaturally cold, so I was little put off by that.

2081058,2015-09-21,2,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"A coworker and I came here for dinner right after work one Friday night. The restaurant itself wasn't even busy, but the parking lot was super full. The surrounding businesses seem to be very popular on Friday night. Chada Thai, a boba shop and a karaoke/sushi bar all neighbor China Mama, and we almost couldn't find a spot to park so be advised. 

We walked in to a semi-empty dining room and were seated right away. We started with the pan fried pork buns that come 6 to an order, and 6 soup dumplings. The pan fried dumplings were really tasty. They came with some type of vinegar sauce which I didn't care for. Instead I mixed soy sauce with the spicy chinese chili sauce that was on the table to make my own sauce that was really good. The soup dumplings were pork as well, and were very juicy and flavorful.

After we ordered and ate our appetizers, it took some time for the server to come and take our dinner orders. They had not even brought us any water, just Jasmine tea. I have to say the service could have been better, but luckily we were not in a hurry. For our entrees we ordered the crispy beef and orange chicken to share. The waitress asked if he wanted rice with our meals and we said yes. I later found out they charge 50 cents for a small cup of rice. Not a big deal, I just assumed the rice came with the meal, but it doesn't. Anyway the crispy beef was delicious. It has to be one of my new favorite dishes and I can't wait to eat it again. It's crispy, it's beefy, and it's a lil bit spicy. It comes with soft shredded carrots and is tossed in a delicious sauce. The orange chicken was tasty, but nothing special. We had plenty of leftovers to take home as the entree portions are huge. I will definitely be coming back here to have more of that delicious crispy beef.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,2,4,IOOt_tdmO-eTWy6ZRRyZBA
2090206,2014-07-13,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"On my last visit to Las Vegas, I treated my parents to early dinner at China Mama's, based specifically on the reviews on this site. I am always a sucker for great reviews, and certainly appreciate the candor of peoples reviews.

I have to say that after having visited China Mama's, I now have found my 'go to' Chinese restaurant everytime I visit Las Vegas. Having been to some of the best Chinese restaurants in San Francisco and NYC, I wouldn't say I am an expert on Chinese cuisine, but will say that I've tasted some wonderful dishes from coast to coast, and what China Mama offers, is almost up there with the finest of the aforementioned cities. 

As a rule of thumb, whenever I visit a restaurant for the first time, I always chose the 'safe' dishes-- In other words, what you would consider to be the main/staple dishes of the restaurants cuisine. This time around, at China Mama's, I decided to order myself the Shrimp Chow Men with the thick home-made noodles and Sweet & Sour Chicken. My parents ordered themselves the Combination Chow Men with the regular noodles and some Won Ton Soup. 

I'm assuming the Won Ton soup is already made in a pot they keep warmed up throughout the day, because no later than 10 minutes after we ordered the waitress brought it in a large serving bowl, with small bowls for everyone at our table. I'm not really a fan of Won Ton Soup, but the waitress encouraged me to try it out. I am glad she did. Add some of their home made hot sauce and you have got a super delicious mixture. I wasn't really trying to eat much of it due to it being 110 degrees out, but I have to say, it was extremely tasteful and the flavoring just perfect. As far as the actual Won Tons, at least to me, I didn't find much taste to them. But the flavorful soup more than made up for that.

My parents and I were thoroughly impressed at the serving size of our dishes, once the chow meins and sweet and sour chicken came out. Being our first time at this place, we all piggy-backed off each others plates to savor everything we all had ordered. It was far too much food, though. Despite there being three of us, we pretty much had at least 1/3rd of each dish as left overs. Which was great as we got to-go boxes and were able to enjoy the rest back at our strip hotel.

Having thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, I will certainly be back to China Mama's my next trip to Vegas and plan on going deeper into their menu to explore other dishes. Good looking out fellow Yelpers!",Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,2,1,4,DkHEmGmau6jK0yh2urENZQ

Xiaolongbao is a small variant of ""guantang bao,"" or Shanghai-style soup-filled dumpling, made with unleavened dough and filled with broth and pork. 
=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

Wait a second..... Las Vegas has a massive off-Strip ""Chinatown"" stuffed to the gills with not only (super-cheap) Chinese restaurants a-plenty, but also Cambodian, Vietnamese, Thai and others? Who knew?!

This past Memorial Day weekend 2015, friends and I were driving through Las Vegas on our way to Zion National Park in Utah, and needed to stop for lunch. Yelp made it easy to look for ""$$""/ ""****"" (translation: cheap and well-reviewed) lunch spots off the beaten path. 

Of the five options we narrowed down, China Mama won out. LA foodies are something of an expert on xiaolongbao, as we're blessed to have several restaurants specializing in that delicacy within a reasonable drive in any direction. So we were excited to try Vegas' counterpart to our beloved soup dumpling houses. 

We walked in at around 2:30 pm on a Friday afternoon, and while we were seated quickly, the service was way too slow for our taste (considering our by-then-ravenous hunger). It was obvious that the server was servicing the entire dining room, so had her hands full. 

Here's what we ordered, along with the ""verdict"" on each:

- The ""Mouth-Watering"" chicken: Ironically, we felt it was anything but. This was the only dish we left half-unfinished on our table. Imagine a cold chicken carcass with its rubbery skin still on, hacked to pieces with a hatchet and served with an oily peppery sauce. Yeah.... not so yummy. 
- Xiaolongbao: Delicious, with delicate wrappers that still stayed intact when bitten. Though I was a little surprised they weren't served with shredded ginger, as is traditional. 
- Fried tofu with shredded pork: We liked the deep-fried chunks of tofu (served mouth-scaldingly hot), but were a little perplexed by the sauce served on the side, which resembled beef stew without the beef (peas and all). There was none of the advertised ""shredded pork"" in the dish, though the waitress dubiously insisted the pork had been ""blended into"" the sauce. 
- Crispy gyoza potstickers: The satisfying crust on these pan-fried gyoza paired perfectly with the juicy, hot, savory filling. This dish was a winner. 
- Shrimp and scallion dumplings: This was the least satisfying of the dumplings we ordered. The skins were unexpectedly tough, and the filling lacked flavor.
- Pork Bao: One of our favorite dishes. The typically starchy bao casings were surprisingly tender and moist here. 

All told, we felt that both the food and the service were uneven. The consensus was that China Mama deserved no more than a three star rating. 

I don't know if I'd go out of my way to return the next time I'm driving through Vegas. But if I lived there, it would definitely be included on the restaurant rotation.",MhPYMbNlFPuF-91xkLN04w,2,2,3,KV_IrA8h6IomtwkOsyF45w

My husband and I ordered the Lamb & Assorted Vegetables w/Szechwan Hot Sauce In Pot (yep, to go), combination fried rice, Cold Mixed Crystal Noodle, Shredded Carrot & Cucumber, and mouth-watering chicken (that was all the information on the menu but it sounded interesting).  For the lamb and cold noodle, can you tell I'm just copying and pasting from the online menu?  I'm not typing all that crap out.

We ended up getting the combination fried rice, mouth-watering chicken, and two of the lamb dish. No cold crystal noodles.  But it's all good because the lamb is about $10 more.  

The lamb dish and combo fried rice were so good!  The mouth-watering chicken comes cold, which I'm good with.  But it has a lot of tiny bones, which makes for annoying eating.  And it made my tongue feel funny so I may be allergic to it.  :) Note to self... avoid vague dishes.  

Our food took a while and China Mama apparently aggravated our driver a little bit.  But China Mama's defense, the mayor showed up.  However, that was after we placed our order so I don't think the mayor was the problem.

He wanted The Hush puppy- ehh me not so much. Don't get me wrong it's tasty, but I'm not a big lover of just fried fish. So I put faith in my yelpers and while searching for good Chinese I decided on China Mama. As we enter we are ushered to our seats and given menus- 2 different ones @ that. Our waitress who didn't crack a smile came back to take our order what seemed like to be an eternity. I let the husband order the meat entree: Orange Chicken & Beef Broccoli, and I got us the fried rice w/ pineapple, shrimp & sausage. Yummy, everything was tasty and came out fast. It was one of the best orange chickens I've had: crispy, hint of orange zest amazing, the rice was genius & delicious. I wanted to get the beef roll but honey was hating on me. Honestly after that meal I wouldn't be able too anyhow. We now have a great Chinese spot- will be great with a group of friends.

2509397,2011-01-28,1,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"My favorite Chinese place in the U.S. No joke. 

I love spicy foods, and this place fulfills my cravings every time. Sure, out of the 3-4 we order, I get the 2 same dishes all of the time, but you know why? Cause it's frickin' delicious.

Those two are Mapo Tofu (spicy sichuan style tofu with ground pork) and Shui Zhu Yu (boiled fish in chili sauce). They are really the treasures of China Mama.

The mapo tofu is by far the best mapo tofu I've had in Vegas. It's very spicy and I dunno how they do it, but they get the combination of spices right every single time. It makes your lips tingle but you just can't stop. I had a friend visit me once, and he's very much into spicy foods too, so I took him here for lunch. He also thought the mapo tofu was really good! So if you have friends that like spicy stuff, you know where to go.

The Shui Zhu Yu is another staple at China Mama. All of the chilis may intimidate some people, but I tell you it's worth it. Just pick up a piece of juicy, white (covered in red chili) fish, put it on your bowl of rice, and just watch as the rice soaks up the chili and the steam that comes from it. If that's not culinary beauty, I don't know what is. The veggies underneath all of the fish is actually one of the best parts about the dish, cause it just acts as a sponge to all of the delicious chili oil. YUM.

Other good dishes: Da Zui Bing (pork-filled split buns), their fried vegetables are pretty good, too. Kou Shui Ji (mouthwatering chicken) is not bad, though very bony. The San Bei Ji (three cup chicken with basil, oyster sauce?, something else...) is also amazing, if you like basil try this. The sauce is a bit heavy, but nothing I'm going to complain about.

The service isn't the best but really, the food makes up for it. It's not horrible service, especially if you speak Chinese (I think a lot of the servers are more comfortable with Chinese, but they seem to be hiring newer people as well that are more fluent in English). Plus, I don't expect amazing service from this sort of restaurant, so it's not really a problem for me.

So GO and find yourself a second mom that makes you great Sichuan food at China Mama!!!",fMTT_T57XXk0GbT_frG7ug,1,0,5,X0L1tZ3ljp7Rl3gBFAAuxg

I found the service to be very friendly and characteristic of a family run restaurant.  Coming here with my spouse and child, we figured trying a few of the smaller appetizer plates that have been well received to be a good plan, to try a 'tasting' menu of the more popular dishes.  We ordered the beef roll, the pork soup dumplings, the scallion pancake, and, hoping to match cold sesame noodles common back east, the noodles in sesame sauce. 

All items were good, but the beef roll was the star of the show - unctuous, flavorful and savory, with a wonderful hoisin sauce/sesame oil aroma.  All other items were very good, but I was a bit disappointed in the sesame noodles, as they were a bit mild and served warm (although eating them the next day cold rectified that).

I highly recommend China Mama - friendly service, good food more reminscent of american coastal chinese cuisine (probably closer to San Francisco style as opposed to NY, but good nonetheless).",Oixv0VgElz8pxQFp2lkdJg,0,0,4,dQdFTcYoFguJjl_7GYBhzg

The place is not that authentic. We ordered a variety of dishes and most of them missed the mark. Let's review:

-Gan bian si ji dou (string beans): This was not that authentic. It wasn't shriveled enough, and they didn't have any shrimp on it. The beans should have fried a little bit more. Flavor was decent although more salt than anything.

-Spicy wontons: Decent. They give you a lot of wontons in a small bowl. I thought the sauce was good.

-Lettuce wrap: My dad was so devastated by this dish. It looked like they used frozen vegetables (carrots, peas, etc) in the meat. My dad was extremely unhappy that this dish was botched.

-Spicy tendon: I usually finish this dish very happily but this one was so bad. The tendon was way too thick and hard to chew. The sauce was good though. It was such a shame.

-Xiao long bao (juicy pork dumplings): No soup, no flavor, what is this

-Sheng jian bao (pan fried pork buns): Where do I begin? The dough was incredibly wrong. These looked like the white fluffy buns you find in cha shao bao (pork buns). The bread was really soggy and the bottom was not fried enough. Meat was mediocre. I was so sad because this is one of my favorite dishes. My dad speculated that they just bought some buns from the frozen aisle and served it to us.

But there are some low points: First, know going in that the menu is very confusing (in Chinese and English with lots and lots of options).  So prepare to be patient when figuring out the menu because the staff is not much help and spoke very limited English.

With that in mind, China Mama is the best chinese food I've found in Vegas.  We followed the exact recommendations of the reviewer and ordered steamed pork dumplings and crispy beef.  Wonderful.  The dumplings were tender and stuffed with a nice mix of pork and green onion.  The crispy beef was wonderfully seasoned, but a little greasy.

We also went out on our own with a standard Kung Pao Chicken and a very interesting fried rice with pineapple, shrimp and sausage.  The best.  The best fried rice I've ever had.

3030193,2011-01-31,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Last night 23 of us went to dinner at China Mama's, most of us for the first time.  We loved it!  While there were a few who got meals that weren't up to par (including me) the general opinion was that this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Vegas area.  This review is from the 8 of us who occupied one table - we shared all of the dishes ordered:

AS we were being seated the waiter passed a few dishes of very cold Spanish peanuts to munch on.  They were REALLY addictive.

PROS:  We all agreed that the potstickers were the best anywhere.  Perfect amount of dough in the wrappers, good filling and there were 10 in each order. Doctored up the soy dipping sauce with vinegar and shredded ginger for great finish.  5 stars for this one.

Because so many of the previous posters touted the scallion (green onion) pancakes we decided to order 3 of them.  WOW.  Awesome is the only word to describe them.  Not greasy, and fresh tasting.

Orange Chicken in Sizzlling Plate was excellent!   Not coated heavily with a lot of gunk, and the taste was soooo delicious.  This was a favorite.
Same for the Sesame Chicken.

Stir Fried Crispy Beef was just plain fabulous.  We ALL agree this was as close to perfect beef as you can get.  The waiter informed us later that this is their number one seller.  I can see why. This one is a keeper and will order it again.

The Cashew Chicken was also a winner.Although a little heavy on the garlic the sauce was excellent.   We like it that way apparently.

When I lived in Detroit, my favorite soup was Pork and Pickled Radish in Broth.   I haven't seen this soup in 23 years so this was a real treat and it was loaded with noodles, maybe more than I wanted but the soup itself was very, very tasty with lots of pork strips.  No one at our table had ever heard of this soup and loved it.

CONS:  My original order was Beef Hot Pot in Garlic Sauce.  Wow, this was so bad I couldn't eat it.  Had to send it back.  The beef chunks were all fat and gristle.  Very rubbery.   They took it back agreeing that it was below par.  Ordered  the Stir Fried Beef instead.  Glad I did!   

The Pork Chow Mein had a different taste than most we've had and an unusual orange color.  Not a favorite.  

Shrimp Fried Rice uses all white rice and very little seasoning.  Very few shrimp in  this order.

Won Ton Soup, just okay.  Not much flavor but still good.  I would recommend other soups.

The bowls of dry noodles passed around the table upon seating  (I guess we were supposed to dip them in the plum sauce)  were very stale.   No matter, we wanted FOOD.  

All in all we agreed that the food here is excellent and no one can like EVERYTHING on the menu.  We all would go back again for sure since we're locals.  By the way,  the service all 23 of our party received was exceptionally good.",TGYVnlAY0R8WX4IagRiuRw,2,1,5,DcSaSChJIM4_Eun2eQ-ryA
3061507,2009-10-19,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Not bad!  The famous Xiao Lung Bao is worth its reputation, or at least it was when I went.  The filling was good, the burst of hot broth inside makes for a cool novelty, and the fresh ginger on the side makes it even better.  I also ate the pan-friend Shanghai dumplings, which had a nice green onion flavor along with the cripsy-fried dough taste.  They didn't blow my mind, but they were fine.  I wouldn't drive across town for them.  I ate the spicy pig ear appetizer, which offers something fairly unusual for a nice price of less than $5.  It's a heaping dish of cold slices of stir-friend pig ear, which has a crunch reminiscent of tripe, drenched in chili oil and (I think) sesame oil.  It was fun to eat pig ear, but the flavor was a little boring.  I think a better quality of chili oil could make the difference.  Last and least, I ate the salt-and-pepper squid, which came deep-fried in fluffy tempura-like batter.  It had salt all right, but I'm not sure if there was any pepper.  It also had some fried garlic and green onion.  It was kind of boring too, but at least the squid was nice and tender and not hard to chew.  Everything was fine here and the staff was nice, so there's nothing really bad to say about it.  It just didn't rock me.  I saw some people getting huge dishes of Kung-Pao chicken and other whitey treats, so I know that they give you your money's worth.  If you go here, I'd recommend that you bring a friend and get a few smaller dishes (dumplings, etc) instead of full-on entrees.  Also try to make sure you don't get too many dishes that rely on green onion for flavor, because the China Mama seems pretty crazy about green onion and you don't want to end up having a private green onion festival at your table.",nyyOcAt3-y4GiqAsalyY0w,0,0,3,Me_q3az8a6fDipxkMNjPVA

I ordered some salt and pepper shrimp thinking they would be about 12-13 bucks. But they came out to about 20 dollars. They were fairly good shrimp, but surely not worth the inflated price. Overall I can see that this place is slightly better quality then the run of the mill chinese joint.

3077161,2011-02-02,2,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Vegas has never been shy about being a glamorous pretender.  Many may recall the billboard ad for Lavo (Mediterranean restaurant managed by the same company as Tao) with a barely dressed woman and the unforgivably atrocious Asian-punned tag-line: ""If you liked our dumplings, you'll love our meatballs"".  

With this in mind, it's amazing that unassuming joints like China Mama exists less than a mile away from Lavo and Tao.  Drive up to the gritty strip mall at the corner of Jones & Spring Mountain and you may wonder if that TV show ""Dirty Dining"" has paid a visit to any of the restaurants here.  There's no sequined mini skirts and guest-list clipboards.  There's just really authentic Chinese food served by Chinese people who speak marginal English.  Take that same amount of effort you'd have put into getting past the velvet rope at Tao to muster an order to the China Mama waiters.  I'll bet you the latter will be nicer to you.

For a middle-of-the-mill palette, order the Steamed Juicy Pork Buns from the Pastry section (the mislabeling charms a former ESL student like myself who has definitely tried literal translations, and failed); they're actually dumplings made with perfect dough and a divine gingery broth that spills onto your tongue after that love-at-first-bite encounter.  For an exotic palette, try the jellyfish with house sauce.  I always add a starter of seafood tofu soup and braised bamboo shoots, they're healthy options that ease my guilt of eating greasy Chinese.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,3,3,5,-nm1nmCA7ff274010ypHGA
3082721,2014-09-02,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Las Vegas is known for the many restaurants owned by famous chefs such as Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay but my most recent trip to Las Vegas and California was about discovering Taiwanese food. We had driven past China Mama and I remember thinking that it was a bit of a hokey name and that I probably wouldn't try it based on that. To my surprise, a few days later my sister said that she was going to take me to China Mama for Dandan Noodles. 
China Mama is in what is considered Chinatown and is a typical Chinese restaurant. There are mainly rectangular tables for 4 and a few round tables to seat larger groups.  The decor is simple. As you walk in the wall at the entrance is full of plaques with reviews and awards won. There are a few chairs at the entrance for a very small waiting area but we were there on a week day for lunch and were seated immediately with no wait time. You can peek into the kitchen as you make your way to the tables and there is some food housed in the refrigerated glass case just outside the kitchen area. 
China Mama's menu consists of noodles, rice, pastry and a la carte dishes. Noodles were a selection of chow mein, noodles with soup and some not so common items such as Dandan noodles and cold noodles with shredded chicken. The pastry section does not exactly contain what North Americans will call pastry. There is a selection of bread (Chinese style) stuffed with vegetables and or meat; familiar dumplings (boiled or pan fried and won tons and Chinese style pancake. Pancake is dough pan fried. The sweet variety has a layer of bean paste in the middle.
The rice dishes are pretty familiar fried rice with different meat and vegetables and the a la carte menu seemed fairly standard aside from offering frog legs. I have to confess I didn't take a thorough look through that section. We ordered Dandan Noodles, Crispy layered pancake, Mama's special pan-fried chive buns, and pork stuffed pocket bread. 
The crispy layered pancake arrived and I'm not sure what we expected but it was a surprise, it was strands of dough placed in a circle and then pan fried till crispy. Our waiter must have known we didn't know what to do with it so took the time to explain that this dish would be ordered instead of rice to eat with other more savoury dishes. As dessert, the pancake would be sprinkled with sugar. He brought us some sugar so that we could try it as a dessert as well as a savoury. The bread is pretty plain but was excellent dipped in some hot chilli oil or as he suggested sprinkled with sugar. It reminded me a little of East Indian paratha but crispier. It was good dipped in the extra sauce from the Dandan noodles (sans sugar of course).
The Dandan noodles arrived in a huge bowl and the waitress came and mixed it all up for us. There was more than enough for two or three people especially when you are ordering other dishes as well. The pork stuffed pockets are a definite must try if you go. Minced pork with Chinese parsley and seasoning stir-fried and then put into pockets of bread which are then pan fried so that the bread is crisp on the outside. It is the same dough as the layered pancake. The chive buns are a little greasy on the outside but look like steamed buns filled with chives and scrambled eggs and then pan fried to crisp up the bottoms of the buns. The photo shows the dish as it first arrived and then there is another photo of the individual bun. The filling of the chive buns were a little on the bland side but we decided that it would go well with the leftover BBQ Roast duck we had at home and they did. The Dandan noodles were al dente with a thick flavourful sauce. There was more than sufficient sauce for the noodles; in fact we were able to boil up some noodles at home to add to our leftover dandan noodles and sauce for a full meal the next day. I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.

3237233,2013-01-28,2,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"I've been craving a Taiwanese beef roll since getting back from LA. So natch I hop on Yelp and start my search for the best beef roll in Vegas. This is the first place ill be trying for that quest. We ordered lots of dishes so its easier to laundry list each. 

Beef Roll - After eating a disappointing version in LA (101 Noodle Express) I swore Id find a better one and China Mama didn't disappoint. Lightly crispy and slightly oily pastry dough wrapped around super thin slices of braised beef (tastes like the same beef that's in the beef noodle soup, this is a good thing), cilantro and a sweet and savory sauce thats slightly akin to hoisin. These few ingredients work together to create a deliciously satisfying spindle of flavor.  

Juicy Pork Dumplings - AKA Xiao Long Bao, XLB or soup dumplings.. these bite size dumplings are filled with a mixture of ground pork and are brought out in a large steamer. These were pretty good, really porky/soupy and worth ordering but I just wished that they had fresh ginger in their dipping sauce as opposed to ground ginger which was seen floating on top of the sauce. Just be gentle when scooping these up from the steamer as one wrong move with your chopstick will puncture the delicate skin. Trust me, seeing the soup gush out of the bottom of a dumpling and onto the table is a very sad thing.

Pork Boiled Dumplings - These are exactly what you'd expect.. big chubby wontons filled with ground pork sealed and boiled. The juicy pork and the toothsomeness of the wonton made these addictive. It was easier to eat these out of a small bowl with a few drops of black vinegar and chili oil. A must try! 

Beef Noodle Soup -  I had no idea that soup bowls here are crazy huge, like you can share between 4 people huge. This isn't quality over quantity either, thick house made noodles treading in a beefy well flavored stock. The depth of flavor was obvious with a hint of spice. If you prefer more heat they can definitely bring you chili oil to enhance your beef noodle experience. Be warned these noodles are slurpy and you will get the collagen rich stock all over your clothes if you're not careful. 

Service was attentive though on our visit (Sunday around noon) they were pretty busy with large groups so the kitchen was a little back up. On the way out one of the servers suggested if we love the beef roll to get the pork pockets next time. I cant wait to try a pork pocket!

So I came back here. Here's a deal. If you want salty duck leg, you might as well get the salty duck noodle, because the prices is about the same, and you get the same thing but with noodles too.

The restaurant as a whole is a nice place and the staff was very friendly with my family. When I opened the menu, I saw the prices of the items on the menu. Personally, I think the prices of the items on the menu are a little high. My family ordered vegetable chow mien, vegetable fried rice, braised tofu (I think), crispy beef, and sweet and sour fish fillet. When the chow mien, fried rice, and braised tofu came out, I personally thought that we could have gotten a little more food or the prices could be a little less, but I like large amounts of food in front of me. I did enjoy the fried rice and chow mien though, I thought they were cooked really well. These two would justify a higher rating in this review, but the crispy beef and sweet & sour fish fillet brought the rating down. The crispy beef was good and so was the sweet & sour fish fillet, but they put too much sauce in both and it was too sweet. In the crispy beef, about half was beef and half was carrots, which was a turn off, and then it was paired with too much sauce that was sweet. The sweet and sour fish fillet had even more sauce than the crispy beef did and it was too sweet. When you got to the fish after wiping all that sauce inside of your mouth, the fish was delicious, but I couldn't get past the large amount of sauce and the sweetness of it. I don't believe you can ask for sauce on the side for the crispy beef, but the sweet and sour fish, you most definitely should. 

This isn't a bad Chinese place to eat at, just don't order something sweet and sour unless you put the sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you put yourself. The prices may be a little high, but the food does taste good. In the end, the decision is in your hands.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,2,0,3,MwqCj5qTOuSAAzOSVcTGgw

It has a more upscale approach, and the prices match that, with most meals above $10.  I ordered the pork steamed buns and the xiao bao.  The pork buns were not very good.  Tasted more like a dumpling in an average steamed bun.  The xiao bao was exceptional.  The soup and dumpling were cooked to perfection and the liquid just explodes when you bite into it.  Though the soup was extremely hot in the dumpling so I'm not quite sure of the best way to eat this dish.  The food took quite a while to come out considering it was just a couple of dishes, but I guess it shows the quality that goes into the meal.

I had just finished playing in a soccer tournament, and was starving.  We decided to go to China Mama, because we saw it when we were eating across the street at Wendy's Noodle Cafe a couple nights before.  We were the only non-Asian folks in the place, which is always an excellent sign.

The waitress was very sweet, and asked us if it was our first time.  I said yes, and let her know we were both vegetarians.  She recommended the scallion pancake and crispy tofu.  We got both, along with an order of vegetable spring rolls and the vegetable chow mein with wide noodles (other options included thin noodles, glass noodles, and ""cat ear shaped"" noodles...interesting).

The vegetable chow mein was absolutely amazing.  The noodles were freshly made, in house.  The sauce was light, and the veggies were perfectly cooked.  I dare say it was the best I've ever had.

The scallion pancake was also a big winner.  I devoured my share in about .5 seconds.  Will definitely get it again.

The vegetable springs rolls were okay, nothing special.  My old man loved the crispy tofu, but I wasn't into the texture of the soft tofu with a crispy-fried coating.  The sauce it came with was great though.

I will absolutely be back at China Mama every time I'm in Vegas from now on.  Highly recommend, especially for vegetarians - there were many authentic Chinese options, and the staff is eager to help if you have questions.

They also have a long list of fruit and vegetable (yes, vegetable) slushies and drinks of that nature.  I tried the fresh strawberry frappe, and it was very yummy.

Since I last visited, China Mama received a nice interior renovation. There's now an open view of the kitchen behind a glass pane and the walls were given a fresh coat of paint. 

However, the food has stayed, more or less, the same and the service was poor as one might expect.

The food is overpriced for what you get, but until Mama Lu's Dumpling House opens a Las Vegas franchise, you're kind of stuck with the China Mama's brand of lackluster food, service, and prices that leaves much to be desired.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,0,3,p1DnsifzzYD2v6SCRwSs9g

4050565,2008-12-29,5,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"I was in the break room at work flipping through the Las Vegas Weekly when I stumble upon an article about China Mama.  Not even half way through the article my mouth was overfilled w/ drool just thinking about those juicy steamed dumplings.  Then I got emo because I was reminiscing the times with my ex since she introduce this dish to me.

Any who, the next day I went to check out China Mama for some xiao long bao, shanghai soup dumplings.  My scallions pancakes, and this chili rice cake dish (darn! wrong one) i order came out first.  The pancakes brought back a lot of good memories because my ex use to make this for me for brekky.  It was good but the chili rice dish i order was a different story.  It was really bland with lots of chili oil, unwanted peppers and the likes.  I guess the other rice cake dish is what I had before.

Then my 2 orders of dumpling came. yayYy.. I asked for a bowl and some chili paste because none of the table were preset with it.  Mixed the chili paste, vinegar (black), and a little bit of soy sauce in the bowl for my dipping sauce. Just enough to submerge a piece of heaven.

Inside these dumplings are juice (soup), so be careful not to break them when picking them up.  Use a soup spoon to assist the eating process because they're hot!  Most people take a small bite at the bottom to let the juice out and drink it.  Then finish the rest of the dumplings in 2-3 bites.  

I, however; use my chopstick and puncture the dumpling from the top to 1) let out some of the heat, and 2) make and an entry for the sauce as I drown it into my dipping bowl.  This usually cools it down enough for me to take it whole because well... that's how i roll.

I must warned you this method could be awfully painful if not done right, but prepare yourself for some totally serious awesomeness!!

My first bite and I'd instantly amend to all those lies my ex told me.  It was just as good as i tried it the first time with her.  She lives in cali btw, and only there was I able to find them.  Sure we have the frozen kind at our local asian market, but it's not the same.  To me it's not anyways.

The next day i came back for dinner with a friend. Order 3 xiao long bao, scallions pancake, and this time shanghai style rice cake.  

Again the rice cakes and pancakes came out first.  The rice cakes were exactly the one i've been searching for too, but it wasn't as good as the other one i had before. No big deal, add more chili paste and we're good to go. I think it was missing more soy or whatever they put in it..  Think ""chow fun noodles"" with rice cakes instead of noodles. 

Next time I'll only come for the dumplings because I have been stuff before they even arrived. Also, i know it's not healthy, but i don't let food go to waste.

I'm such a fatty ;(

Overall the joint was fairly clean.  Service is good, better the 2nd time because we were the only one there. With so many items I have yet to try, I'll def come back with a Chinese friend to be more adventurous if not for those sweet  lil' dumplings.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,5,4,4,lCG73k1mQkhmUc0WdV2Dmg

I took the Weekly's advice and ordered the ""juicy pork dumplings:"" outstanding! (after the owner showed me how to eat them correctly - there is a process), and the stuffed pork ""sandwich."" Sooo good. I observed table next door ordered crispy ""sticky bread"" baguettes which when delivered, server cut into pieces with scissors. Didn't see it on the menus, though. 

Back for a second time and had the spicy wonton - it was about a 2.75-star spicy, so don't fear, and extremely tasty. Friend had something with the wide noodles - except it wasn't ""noodles"" - it was NOODLE! (BTW, he asked for the thin noodle and server said, ""No, you get wide noodle."") That whole dish was one long noodle! It freaked him out a little (he murmured something about it looking like an intestine), but it was really good - homemade noodle. This second time I went back I asked about where the second menu was, server just waved finger at me and said, ""No, one menu today."" Not sure what that's about. Perhaps its only on weekends that you receive two menus. I will be going back despite the limited-English/gently forceful servers. The food is REALLY REALLY good.
They don't have take out menus. Humph.

Visit #3: Took my gramma here for a weekend lunch, and she too kept remarking throughout the meal how great the food was. This time we received 2 menus each and we were able to choose our noodle without resistance from the staff.

4487493,2014-07-03,12,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Four-and-a-Half Shiny Stars for China Mama Restaurant!  I'm super picky about my Chinese food because many of the restaurants cater to the Western palate.  China Mama is as authentic as it gets!  The restaurant is located off the main Las Vegas strip in a small strip mall.  The restaurant offers Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese food.

My table mates were very safe with their food offerings, but I threw in a couple of my favorites.  To start, we had the Mongolian Beef.  I didn't order this, but I'm glad that someone did.  The dish was created with very tender and flavorful beef sauteed with white onions, green onions, and a hint of garlic.  The flavor was outstanding, and I think this was the best Mongolian Beef that I've ever had!   Grade:  A!

The second dish was the restaurant favorite, Xiao Long Bao (XLB).  The XLB came out 8 to a serving and was served piping hot.  Each dumpling has a bit of juice in it and it had very strong flavors of ginger.  Delicious and fun to eat.  Grade:  B

The third dish was basil chicken.  Served in a little pot with a gel flame to heat the dish, the chicken was cooked with a soy glaze and heavy hints of basil.  I again didn't order this, but glad that someone did.  The flavors were bold and strong.  Grade:  A-

The fourth dish was stir fried green beans.  Typical string beans sauteed with green onions, garlic, and dried shrimp.  It was delicious!   They added additional flavors in this dish that made it taste more savory than the typical way it is presented in other restaurants.  Grade:  B+

The fifth dish was the spicy fish hot pot.  This dish can be ordered as non-hot or as bit arsh hot that you can stand it.  We ordered the dish as spicy.  The fish was generous, delicious and hearty.  There was cabbage (napa cabbage) below the fish.  The soup was presented in a soup-oil broth complete with spicy red peppers!  One thing that I missed about this dish was that it didn't have the typical szchuan peppercorns that numb the tongue.   The dish was spicy, but it didn't have the depth that it normally has with the peppercorns.  Grade:  B+

Service was great!  There was two main waitresses that worked the 20+ tables.  The younger of the two (daughter?) was very pleasant and allowed me to practice my Chop Suey Chinglish (I tried to speak Taiwanese / Mandarin / Cantonese all at once).  She understood me 100% and I had a good laugh!  The older waitress was a bit more serious!

This is a great place ot take family and/or friends.  They have an extensive menu of items (7+ pages of dishes!).

4620998,2009-08-24,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"We've had China Mama on our list for a few months and finally made it over there last week.  Ordered the Steamed Juicy Pork Buns and Dry Fried Beef Noodles.  (That's 2 dishes if you are counting).

Some dumplings arrived and I thought to myself that these do not look like the XLB I was expecting.  However, they were delicious and we enjoyed them.

Next arrived the Dry Fried Beef Noodles.  Do not order this.  The ""dry fried"" refers to the Beef, NOT to the noodles.  Not flavourful and half the beef was dry-fried fat, not meat.  (Do you not SEE that you are serving a chunk of fat?)

Next, a different waitperson stops at the table with another dish.  (wtf? 3 dishes?).  I told her we only ordered 2 dishes and that they had made a mistake.  A few minutes later, the manager (older, matriarchal lady) comes to the table to explain that they had served the first set of dumplings in error and that the second plate of dumplings was the correct order.  I told her we had enough food, but if they were going to waste, we would eat them.  She countered by assuring me that it was not too much food (for 2 people) and she set the dumplings down.  (This is a cultural thing, I think, and I didn't take it as her being pushy)

The XLB were, by this time, luke-warm and, while edible, they were not anything I'd go out of my way for.  The first set of dumplings (the Shanghai pan-fried dumplings) were excellent and flavourful and they are the reason I gave CM 2 stars.

When the check arrived, I was shocked to see the Manager had CHARGED us for both sets of dumplings - the ones we ordered and the ones we had not.  Outrageous.  I'm kicking myself for paying the full amount as I would usually set the matter straight, but I guess I was a little shocked by the ballsyness of this place.

My favorite dish is ""Sliced fish fillet in hot chili sauce"". A perfect balance between the umami from the fish and the chili oil sauce. It is definitely one of the best I had. They are not cheap with the fish in the dish, by the time i finish the meal, there are enough fish for another 2 person at least.

Second dish is "" Sliced pork tripe w hot spicy sauce"", even though it's not quite the same with how i usually had it. It is still a pretty good dish.  The last dish is ""Beef stew noodle soup"", a very large portion. I could only eat 1/4 of them, it's definitely worth the money. 

For dessert, we have the the homemade sesame ball. Even though this is not quite the normal dessert i will have for dinner. But since it's homemade, i have to try it out. There is plenty of red bean inside, and i love red bean.

We went this past Sunday night. The restaurant itself was nice enough, and there were few other tables dining there besides ours.  
We were immediately put off by the 3 menus they handed us. 3 menus? Red flag right there.  We should've known better right then, but we were already there, so we decided to give it a shot.
We ordered the soup dumplings, beef roll, hot n sour soup, hot n spicy chicken, shrimp fried rice and mapo tofu. 
The best thing we had was the shrimp fried rice.  I actually enjoyed it.  The mapo tofu was ok.  My fiancé liked the beef roll, and we both found the dumplings to be very rich, from the melted pork fat, and pretty flavorful.  Not the best we've had, but not the worst either.  The hot and sour soup tasted so watered down!  Maybe if it had another few hours to reduce it might have tasted better. The spicy chicken dish, which was recommended by our waitress, was straight up nasty! Unedible.  It was little bits of breaded chicken that were fried and tossed with a mound of red chilis.  Oddly though, the chicken itself was not spicy.  My fiancé and I literally tried one piece each and did not touch it after that! It tasted like cardboard and I am not exageratting!  Needless to say, we had a ton of leftovers that we did not take home with us!

4946513,2009-12-26,5,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"Christmas Day, the young man was craving some cong you bing (scallion pancakes) and I had read about China Mama on here. I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!

We headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.

They don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.

The XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.

Potstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!

Sheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. 

And how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.

Definitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!

Cong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.

I saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.

Definitely some really above average Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted! This will stay on my list of places to return to whenever we're in town!

For our party of three, this is what we got:

* P23 Steamed Juicy Pork Bun (8) aka Xiao Lung Bao ($7.25) - The famous XLBs!  At first I thought they seemed a bit expensive, but once I got a look at these buggers I realized they were big ones!  The waiter brings a soy sauce dish with sliced ginger and we poured a bit of the black vinegar to mix with the ginger.  We attempted to pick up each dumpling without breaking them, but it proved fruitless.  Every single one broke as their skin stuck to the paper lining.  No hot juicy goodness inside at all, but rather all over the plate instead!  They were indeed meaty, but that's all they were, just meaty.  I wouldn't say they had a whole lot of taste, and the skins were dried out on top.  I've had better XLBs elsewhere, so they weren't a big winner for me.  
 
* P29 Beef Roll ($6.99) - We had to order this because it was mentioned in the Las Vegas Weekly review and sounded interesting enough.  It's definitely unique and something we've never seen or tasted before, and probably the favorite dish of the night.  It's rolled into a big pinwheel, and pretty good.

* H50 Chicken with Pickle Chili Sauce ($13.95) - The allure of 'pickle' was what prompted us to order this dish.  But there was no pickling in sight.  Just a spicy chicken dish with large pieces of red bell peppers.  Good, but not what we were expecting.

* H98 Eggplant & Basil Prep. in Hot Pot ($8.95) - Looking for some vegetables, we chose this one.  It came in a pot with a flame going on underneath.  Pretty tasty, but not spectacular.

* H108 Stir Fried Shredded Potato ($7.95) - Similar to a dish we've ordered at Yun Nan Garden, but this one lacked some much needed seasoning.

Service was good - tea was brought over promptly along with two menus.  The staff speaks English and asked if we needed water.  

Leftovers of the chicken and eggplant tasted even better the next day!

Overall, I came with high expectations of the XLBs, and it fell short.  The Beef Roll was the big surprise hit though.  The other dishes were good or average, but nothing to have me craving more.

Beef rolls - nice portions and good flavors. I loved the sweet hoisin sauce in it. The green onion pancake wrap could have been crispier and flakier. It didn't add much flavor but the filling was good. 

Combo fried rice. - a solid friend rice dish sings to my heart. And this one was pretty good. Add some chili oil and you have yourself a fantastic dish. 

Dan Dan noodles - not what I expected at all. It was just plain noodles in a bowl of chili oil. Wtf?  Where's the meat,  where's the cucumber,  where's the thick spicy peanut sauce?  Really sad excuse of a dish because it's literally boiled noodles in chili oil.

It was kinda hard to figure out some of the vague descriptions...it sounds like something that I'm looking for, but was still very unsure. Not that there are many descriptive Chinese menus, but this was definitely one of the worse ones. 

I just rolled with the first thing I saw on the Yelp highlights about some sort of crispy beef. 

It was okay, very starchy. Some crispy slivers I'm not quite sure if it was just a crisp, with no beef in it at all. It was highlighted in red which I thought was spicy, it wasn't at all. It would have been better if its less sweet and spicy to balance it. 

It said it was $9.95 on the menu. Charged $11.95.

With the language barriers I've been hearing occur here, I just was satisfied to be full of pancake, pain and rolled on out than dispute things. 

Later I read that they add on rice, so we each had a bowl of rice so I figured that was the case for the extra. Further reading says its 50 cents a serving bowl. In that case they charged us for 4 bowls.

Technically located on Jones, but just steps from Spring Mountain, China Mama had long been on my 'must visit' list thanks, in part, to strong reviews from several palates I trust.  Every bit an unassuming space, a veritable 'hut' in the lot adjacent Chada Thai, it was on entry that friends were located at a nearby table and with the extensive menu quickly perused under the watchful eye of a server who seemed intent on making sure there was never a moment of pause throughout our 70-minute stay an order was placed - the seven item onslaught soon to begin as the table filled quickly with far too much food for any three people to eat.

Beginning with items from the oft-raved ""pastry"" section before progressing to selections delineated by the origin of their protein, the meal began with Mama's signature Beef Roll and with the pan-kissed noodles stuffed thick with supple beef and light scallions both flavors and textures popped, a similar compliment due to the unctuous  pancake - the poignant flavor profile bolstered by a side of thick hoisin-like sauce that paired beautifully both here and with plate of intensely smoky bone-in duck.

Delving next into a steamer of XLB that was a bit light in soup despite excellent sapor from a ball of briny pork it was onward to walnut shrimp that our meal progressed and although occasionally overwhelmed by mayonnaise this version was perhaps the most impressive of the afternoon, a large portion of crisp and sweet crustaceans more than justifying the $18.95 menu price that proved on par with those at Blossom for best I've tasted in Las Vegas to date.

More than sated at this point it was almost comical just how large Mama's Special Pan Fried Pork Buns turned out to be, and although some were regrettably packed up as leftovers due to a frank lack of capacity the crispy exterior yielding a pocket of seared pork amidst rich aromatics still enticed me enough to eat three, a steamer of red bean buns intended as 'dessert' picked at simultaneously with subtle sweetness proving an excellent juxtaposition to the brine of the pork while the creamy filling was forgivingly light at the end of a rather substantial meal.

No different than many of the eateries surrounding Spring Mountain in terms of scene and service but excelling with regard to the food China Mama is every bit worthy the high praise it has received from persons both local and distant.  Admittedly a bit more expensive than Cathay House or Chang's but far superior to the former and without the dim-sum service issues of the later a large-group exploration of a more extensive swath of the menu seems pertinent.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,wqF8Gz8txEMDJUeM0WVGsw

Nope... Waiting for a table for Dim Sum. A friend suggests I try out this new place that serves pretty authentic Shanghai dumplings and cuisine. I Yelp/Google China Mama and off we go.

A friend and I promptly arrive around 12:15pm. Its in the same plaza as Cafe Moda and Karaoke Q Studio. We walk through the door to find the place kind of empty. The place easily fits 100+ patrons, but today there were about 20 or so people. Kind of disappointing for a prime time lunch hour, but then again encouraging because there were many Asian people there.

We get seated and immediately get served tea. They give us two menus. One for the appetizers and one for more of a regular course entrees. We look over the menu and finally decide on four dishes:

Steamed Juicy Pork Bun - Xiao long bao ($7.25). Yum! I love this dish. There is definitely a certain way to eat this. Usually I put it in my soup spoon and break it open with my chopsticks. The broth/juices come oozing out and then I take a big bite. This dish comes with 8 pieces. I would definitely order this dish again.

Green Onion Pancake ($4.75). I've always been a big fan of green onions so this would naturally be right up my alley. This dish is also pretty darn good. The pancake is not overly oily but it does leave a slick film on your fingers. Very tasty! I would also definitely order this dish again.

Pan Fried Shrimp & Green Nira Pillow ($7.25). The waiter recommended this dish. It was good... Not excellent but good nevertheless. Inside had leeks, chopped up shrimp, and some eggs. I think I'd rather try another dish the next time around.

Dry Style Beef Noodle ($6.99). It was a hot day so we opted for the dry style instead of the soup. This was another decent dish. I'd definitely try it with the soup next time.

Overall, our bill for the four dishes came out to be $28 for the two of us. Not to bad. I really liked the waiter. He was very helpful in explaining the dishes. I also liked the way he first spoke to us in Mandarin, and then kept speaking to us in Cantonese when he found out we couldn't speak Mandarin. He had a great attitude and that definitely made the whole dining experience better. I would definitely eat here again!

I do, however, appreciate good xiao long bao (soup dumplings) but not a lot of places in Vegas can do it right.  China Mama's xiao long bao was perfect!  The soup inside the dumplings was hot but not enough to the point you burn your mouth.

We also got pork chop rice which was really good.  It's like salt and pepper pork without the bones.  The salted pork stir fried with garlic leaves was ok - not quite the way I like my pork cooked...it was quite salty like Spam.  The pan fried pork buns tasted like the xiao long bao except it bun form.  Their jasmine tea was excellent and not watered down like in some other Chinese restaurants.

The service was ok...it's a Chinese thing.  Don't expect superb service, it's not going to happen!  They did attempt to speak to us in Chinese but the only words I remember nowadays are curse words.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,4,4,Mdbcqp06nukpPOJ_iPFIYw

We walked in and they didn't seem too busy, we got seated right away, and they brought over the hot tea and menus, so far, good. But then they struggled to get back to the table for our order. 

My husband had already made up our choices, I usually make suggestions and he orders for us. Tonight, I just let him select. 

Our beef roll came out first, it was like moo sho pork, pancake rolled with cilatro and scallops, thinly sliced beef and a smidge of hoisen, but they brought us aome exta, they were good.

The spicy wontons were a bit mushy sitting in the oily spice, smelled good but taste was ordinary.

We also got the noddle chow fun, fat noddles of course, it was also good, but our next three dushes were just so blah, crispy beef, sticky sweet thinnly beef and sliced carrots, not sure it was good, I didn't care for it, kung pao chicken had gritty peanuts, and the mabu tofu was very weak. 

Well, at 130am, it all came back up! I had the worst tummy ache, a little fever and chills, and the nausea and well.... I'll leave it at that!

It's located in a very busy plaza in Chinatown. There's a boba place, foot massage, and karaoke all in that plaza. The entrance/door is quite unassuming.. not the most pleasant looking entrance... not a good sign. We arrived at around 8pm on a Friday and there were only 3-4 tables filled. Also not a good sign.

We ordered their hand pulled wide noodles with beef, kung pao chicken, and chicken fried rice. Portions were huge! Family-style is the best way to eat here.

I was pretty spoiled by having my Chinese friends taking me to the best places in Toronto and doing all the ordering...hence avoiding any kind of communication difficulty. We ended up ordering the juicy pork buns, green onion pancake, hot & sour soup (miscommunication on this one--the bf ordered a small for himself because he was the only one who wanted soup, but they brought out a giant bowl enough for 5-6 people. Oh well), fried rice cake with spicy chilis, crispy stir fried beef, boiled shrimp dumplings and an orange sizzling chicken. Yeah, we ordered waaaay too much for the 4 of us. We have a habit of doing that. Guess I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow! Anyway, the dumplings were pretty good--ive definitely had better, but these did the job. The pancake was yummy and I like the shrimp dumplings. The fried rice cake dish was different than we've had before---the rice cakes were more tubular as opposed to the flatter oval bias cut type I'm used to. It was pretty tasty, but nothing I'm going to crave. The sizzling chicken was a bit too fatty for my taste, but everyone else loved it. I didn't have the beef dish either (which the waitress had recommended), but my parents really enjoyed it. Aside from the soup size miscommunication we didn't have any problems and the waitress was really good about refilling the waters...which is usually not the case at Chinese places for some reason. The service was very good and they were more than happy to package up the leftovers for us. Would definitely come back again when I need my green onion pancake and soup dumplings fix!

First of all, there were only a few families there other than us, so there should be no problems with getting our food cooked, right? Wrong! They forgot about our fried sesame balls and we were almost done eating when we decided it was enough. We called a waiter down and asked him about it. Before we could even explain though he just hurriedly said yeah yeah we got it cooking, and rushed over to help new just entering customers. Did he even know what we were talking about??? Then, we actually saw the male waiter talking to another waiter about us probably and how
they forgot one of our menu items. We were basically done eating already, so we decided to just leave and ask for the check without the sesame balls. But the waiter just said wait! It's coming it's coming we just have to make it by hand so it takes a while. YEAH RIGHT! I can almost guarantee you that they don't mix the flour and then make them right in the kitchen. More like they forgot our order! If it was busy, it might have been more tolerable. However, there was hardly any people in there and now I know why. Finally, at the very end we were all pretty fed up with them already, but they made us pay on an iPad. That's not the bad part. It's the fact that they stood over our shoulder and and looked at how many tips we left them. The iPad forces you to pay at least 15% tips to them. AT LEAST! If you don't they dont let you proceed to the paying section. Overall, I think the food was average they had pretty good noodles though.",tP4Hs41PxGJB5A-MRqb4Dw,1,1,2,vKmUGnaSgYYIgxnTY69bIg

Haven't been able to get into any Yelp events lately, not sure if that is part due to the regime change, so didn't really feel the need to upkeep my status.  However, U can't help myself as a foodie but to share the wealth of knowledge and pay forward any tips that I possibly can to any other fellow foodie.

I know that I have seen this place before and often frequent 168, Cravin Cajun as well as Wendy's Noodle Cafe.  I stopped by Yi Mei Champion once before for the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, bit they was out.  So here is my chance on redemption.  My good buddy Karel and his wife told me to come through, not knowing that I booked marked this place months ago.  What better time than the fall to quench my cold weather hunger than with some good old comfort soup.  

Mom duxe is Taiwanese and prepared this for me on occasion and wanted to test out to see if China Mama was as good as my mama. And the verdict is....not bad at all, of course never as good as mama's, but that'sa bias comparison whichever way you cut it.  It sure comes close, yet there are distinct differences.

The soup broth is clean and not greasy, not too mention loaded with spinach and other green leafy veggies.  Some Chinese broccoli or bok choy might be a good addition as well, but know sometimes it can add bitterness.  I opted for the wide noodles and boy was I thankful.  I can see some people struggle with slurping them down if they are not versed with the sticks, bit still worth the experience...kinda like won ton min.  The beef looks like flank and good tenderness, not too form yet not falling apart.  A decent portion for $9.72 after taxes too.

Ambience is coming and we'll decorated, a union between traditional and modern styles without trying too hard or over doing it.  I sat in the far northeast corner and the AC was cranking.  So maybe choose a more moderate tempered location of you visit. 

Staff seemed rushed and rude at first, but there are only 2 ladies doing all the floor work.  They later have me a warmer greeting after cashing it the party of 30 in the room.  

Overall, a winner in my book and just what the doctor ordered.  Good looks fam bam for the recommendation!  I may come back to try out other dishes since its close to HQ.  Otherwise, till next grind!",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,0,4,TURzrk6rvd-euylpgVzsKQ

Table-for-1 Factor:  They got busy for lunch which might not be great for 1, but we did see someone eating by himself...  Still, not sure it will feel entirely comfy for your typical Yelpers...",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,2,1,4,WH_9Sq6t1oL7PNWzmjwONQ

The mamasans who own and run the restaurant are really cute, I got really good service and the food was really yummy.  I ordered the beef chow mien, soup dumplings (xlb), and the layered pancake which is one of my all time favorite appetizers.  They make it really crispy and light, not too oily.  It's delicious and I'd probably come back just for that.  The beef chow mien was also a treat, mostly because of the homemade noodles with a really good firm texture.  The xlb is definitely worth ordering and I think is the best in Vegas.  They give you a lot of food too, I wasn't able to finish because everything was so good!",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,2,2,4,eeKSd-YthQ518lNRhoS-sg

Service is TOOOO bad. We ordered two items and waited for 40 min. I went to the counter to check and saw dishes were already there waiting for service, no one just have time to bring them to your table. Water is served after 20 min and you have to remind them! When wanna check, no one responded, just like no one cares about you and you should just sit there by yourselves.",O3vKv0CyyjsAJ4Ji3OReMg,1,0,1,cPxrbY4PUVxTPsxm-32iLQ

Server seemed to completely forget about us. Entire staff came into dining room during dinner service to literally build a table - with a drill, work gloves, etc. Chef at one point came out of kitchen carrying a giant bowl of rice from which he was eating. He wandered around chewing and barking orders at staffers. Staffers kept dropping boxes -- of dishes? -- etc. in the dining room. Confusing and distracting. Dumplings were good though.

We ordered the combination spicy meat appetizer and lets just say I personally will not be ordering that again.  The texture, the name of the appetizer and the taste was not at all appealing.  For the meal portion we ordered the hot & spicy chicken it was very good, however you will have to order rice or noodles with the chicken otherwise it comes alone.  We also ordered the combination lo mein with the extra wide noodles.  This was really good we ordered a side of hot sauce and that added a bit more of a kick to the whole plate.  
The service was okay, we did run out of water and never was refilled or asked us if we needed refills at anytime we were there.",C1EiNDxcj94DAKbEjpbLng,1,0,3,iTLFj7q7tEqudcDaD4XJfA

Our friends never ate here before and we told them such good things about the food. We ordered combination chow mein, chicken chow mein, mabo tofu, sesame chicken, beef broccoli, and twice cooked pork. The last three dishes were awesome! However, the noodles tasted a little sour and the tofu tasted like pepper overload! If that wasn't bad enough.. Service was worst! We were the only table and waited forever to get seated, get water and tea, everything!

5837896,2017-03-16,2,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"After a return visit to China Mama more than five years since my last review, I was pleased to see that the restaurant's interior had been recently updated and the furniture re-upholstered.  And, without requesting that dishes come in sequential order, at least the soup came out first.

Shanghai Wonton Soup with a few thin noodles was good with empty open cooked wontons that slid off a tablespoon.  Steamed Juicy Pork Buns were as great as ever, releasing vinegary hot liquid into the mouth and throat with each initial bite.  And a seemingly endless vat of Assorted Seafood & Tofu in a Clay Pot served in a ceramic dish that never appeared to lose heat was very pleasant to eat, consisting of large shrimps, small scallops, hunks of well-cooked fish, and a few peas and carrots in a hot and tasty, floury broth.

Service was good but more efficient than friendly.

I still find this to be one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, and will be back much sooner the next time I dine here.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,4,4,r5ndevDdQlzmoGQO2kQsXw

5883948,2010-06-11,0,6Z6IyosSMciZtwk8hRLRag,"This is regular lunch spot for me. 
It's hard to find home-made style noodles in Vegas and China Mama has it. Whether it's thick noodle or cat's ear, they have 4 kinds of noodle variety to choose from.

The staple is the beef stew noodle soup (6.99) & their beef roll ($6.99)
Actually any of their noodle dishes are really good. I have tried the Dry Style Beef Stew Noodle, Combination Noodle Soup, Noodle with Sesame Sauce (they are all really decent) 

And some of their appetizers like Pigs Ear or Beef Tripe/Tendon are worth a try too.

The service is excellent, very friendly and speaks good English, LOL and the place is very clean.

The prices are not bad, we ordered 6 dishes and it was only $40, and we got plenty of left-overs too!

I gave this 4 stars because sometimes the service could be faster. When you are on a short lunch break, every minute counts.

** Update, try the Twice Cooked Pork & Spicy Won Tons. They are soooo good!~",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,3,0,4,AMzXkx3rtrMIYDEHg6B1rA

Have now been here a couple of times because it's convenient, and I kept thinking I'll like it better, however, I don't think I'll be returning. Tonight (Friday) but the restaurant was maybe only 1/4 full. Despite that, they were unable to provide us menus for about 15 minutes citing they were all being used. When we did get menus, we had to flag someone down to take our order (although it was so empty in there). Food came in a reasonable time frame but was just very subpar. The crispy pancake was good but my Sichuan style twice cooked pork was awful. It was swimming in almost a soup of grease, and though was advertised as spicy wasn't at all. After eating it was only us and one other table still there however took forever to get our bill. I also found a hair stuck on the outside of one of our dishes and the booths we were sitting in are greased stained and just in desperate need of some cleaning.

All my favorites hadn't changed and the tastes were consistent. Beef roll is always a must and I like a lot of their buns. Their menu is extensive, so it's hard to narrow it down during the ordering process. I like a lot of their veggie options, so I usually order at least one.
