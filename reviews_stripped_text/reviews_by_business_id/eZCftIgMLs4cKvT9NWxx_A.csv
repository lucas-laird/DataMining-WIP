Ordered a veggie thin crust pizza and pepperoni pizza. Lots of toppings and made well done. 

Was done in about 15-25 min and there is seating when waiting for order. 

Staff was polite, however no one greeted us upon arrival. The Tablet has a list of people who ordered and check in. Unfortunately, the tablet didn't work. 

Condiments & napkins were given.
Parking is available as it's located in a shopping center.",zwKLl0R9twRbZyU-i52Wbg,0,0,5,0v2WCNSouqxQJkkdE2LPVw

1889702,2016-02-01,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,Just ordered delivery. The toppings were skimpy and the crust was greasy!!! Will not order from here again.,rwsz4-xScU0KwwRArsHZhQ,1,1,2,Bm7kGvh9AlJgXSfz96WoUg
2124066,2015-04-01,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,Awful customer service.. I guess their business is doing fine without your money.. as after you place your order on line.. they call you back and tell you they can't deliver there..however the next day they can....I talked to the delivery person .. he said they always deliver here... I call the manager and she said no.. I am handicapped and really needed to have food delivered.. what a joke... I will never order here again. I will go local for sure..   pretty sad..,AXR0o3lNLdNK_jzjKK_s4g,0,0,1,7kyMmwamVcczWvIGqM5c_Q
2164571,2018-03-02,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,I have been waiting 45 mins but still do not get my pizza. And when I ask them the employee said they are making it even though I ordered it from 40 mins ago. The pizza is good but the service is so bad.,ALHG5uo3gkLzLjhIUDjv7g,0,0,1,i9z43Htyek29HXD-HpMFoQ
2230829,2015-01-31,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,"Pizza still tastes the same but the customer service is horrible. If I'm out and about I never go to this location (ONLY when I order in) because its the only one that I think delivers to my location. I have had issues with my order and they do nothing to rectify the problem. As stated before their customer service is a mess. Can't even call management, they never return calls.",BMANLYpA_Wj2xLSGvcW3Rw,0,0,2,e0jvaMR0urhnviZ7xiUk9w
2435495,2016-08-06,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,"The only reason I gave one star was because the food is good only if u order extra sauce for the pasta dish. I had ordered there for delivery for some time, but the one time I walked in I told them I would never come back. They never washed their hands and they never clean up. I work around food myself and I would never do what they do #needgloves. Corporate needs to train management. Im surprised I'm not to sick from delivery",IZeKIHX8B49f-1-f2TtDHw,0,0,1,ldAO6qdm2WJqnbd28RAJ6A
2677483,2016-05-13,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,"I see a few negative reviews on here about this location, but I disagree.  I order delivery from this location about once a week for the past 4 months.  I choose dominoes because their menu fits my budget.  They have never yet got my order wrong!  That's pretty impressive for any pizza place if you ask me.  The delivery guys are always very friendly and professional as well.  They all have also been very gracious when I leave a tip.  Consistently great service!",BoGRzQErfGomjBnsMP7g_w,1,0,5,q5j_G21WZBvGxOcilx38Ew
4013808,2012-03-17,1,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,"Ok, maybe I'll just keeping a tally here.

Ordered the usual, 2 topping med pizza with meat and a bacon/jalapeno cheesy bread.  I got the 2 topping with meat and a CHEESE stuffed cheesy bread, instead, again.

If I had better pizza delivery places to choose from...I would.  But for now, I'm stuck with them and they're stuck with me.  I think they are conspiring against me.

So, now I sit and wait 45 minutes for the correct cheesy bread to be delivered.  I hope they don't put any extra ""ingredients"" in there!

Until next time, happy eating!",WkIB83EfRZX6kNJk2eHVcw,0,0,2,WESjpWeuK-Uj_sG8qF_F4A
4031653,2017-07-26,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,Great pizza. Mushrooms actually looked like mushrooms. Unlike other domino's that serve a pizza with miniature mushrooms.,UJUxbKZLNBNdqPNSgIJs0g,0,0,4,EBwlf3gdCAjRx8R-Il84XA
4270091,2016-12-16,0,eZCftIgMLs4cKvT9NWxx_A,Pizza is delicious. Cuz it has cheese. Dominos makes pizza.  So...  it's delicious.  I've been to better places but all pizza is delicious.  You can't go wrong here. Tip your drivers generously. They don't get paid much and you can handle and extra fiver.,Du0iztSdUMpxARXV98K34A,0,0,4,fUj5XlheG6mqvvkosyBq2g

The staff (nite shift) was really helpful and he let us in once his delivery person came back, as he said the place is not safe so he didnt let us in as he was alone during that time. we were able to get two large pizzas and bread sticks in no time and finally were able to eat the dinner. Dominos you saved the day.:)",t5dfwPEdTd64lyKf-ivw-g,0,0,4,Jl0j8rtiqCNifxG8ubFQlA

We don't get delivery because it takes too long 
Customer service can be much better 
The one other reason I will never go back is when I ordered last week walked in and waited . The young guy making the pizza came to take my order without washing his hands wiped his hands on his pants and then was ready to help me.  
When I said no thank you he went right back to making pizza no hand washing. 
Not good.",Nx08hoMzSbhYSoeCLhksmQ,1,0,1,qcuoJ0G2jFTAusTD8M7CXw
