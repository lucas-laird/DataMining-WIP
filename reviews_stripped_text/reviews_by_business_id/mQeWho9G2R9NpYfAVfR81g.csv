The staff is extremely friendly and always quick on refills. 

My guess is as I try more menu items ill be able to find things just as good as the club. Definitely not a bad place to visit after your round!",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,0,0,3,MeEclLD8KPRQUed-B545rA

Look no further than the Rat Pack Bar and Grill at the Las Vegas National Golf Course. We came here on a Sunday morning after confirming they serve breakfast until noon. The golf course was quite busy but the restaurant was not with only a few golfers chatting at a nearby table. The service was prompt and very friendly. We ordered a Bloody Mary and mimosa to start and the breakfast burrito and Dean Martin's breakfast. The food is standard for breakfast but the prices are very cheap. The French toast was eggy and fluffy and perfect for my sensitive stomach. The Bloody Mary seemed to have a lot of horseradish but I loved it. You can sit inside or outside and they were playing football on one of the TVs. There's also a rustic bar you can sit at and a section that outlines the history of the course. Even if you don't plan on golfing I suggest checking this place out. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,2,2,4,piSZFJmTcupnHNQMW9YJ7g

We went around 4 in the afternoon and were the only people in the joint for about 10 minutes.  Then golfers came in to get drinks for the course and some came in to cool off inside with drinks and food! Our bartender/server was Donna. She alone is worth a stop!,k-E4s7OlRJAxiJJdaTBgmQ,1,1,4,IHXS5JQmDt1VPtYKzmfoLg

The Rat Pack Bar & Grill is unique in that it serves as the home to the Las Vegas Golf Hall of Fame exhibit.
Happy hour 4-close.",k1FxBPNVosnWJHttRNdvPQ,2,1,5,EDeeBKB4Mepf27V4wk1phA
