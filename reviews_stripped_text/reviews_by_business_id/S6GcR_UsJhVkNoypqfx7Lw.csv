105729,2011-12-13,3,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"This place is a little weird.  You get your food from a long ala cart counter.  Meats are about $4.75 per 1/4lb, small sides are $5 and large sides are $8.  My friend and I both had the brisket, it was a little fattier than other places.  We also had the baked beans, dirty rice and greens.  These were pretty good.  The Lynyrd Lager is nothing special, tastes like beer.

With the food and a total of 3 beers the bill came to $63.75.  I didn't really feel like I got my money's worth.

They've got a pretty big stage which would probably be cool with some live music.  They also have several big flat screens configured to display one big picture.  Even with my poor eye sight I had no trouble watching the game.

Probably won't come back here unless my redneck cousins show up in town.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,3,2,3,O25PWvwQhShCeYza0qgyXg
112738,2013-02-28,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,I didnt know what to expect with all the mixed reviews. We were pleasantly surprised. They accommodated 10 people easily. Although they didn't have a kids menu they were more than happy to split the orders up and there is plenty for everyone. They food is absolutely delicious and the service was great. The decor is rough but its exactly what youd expect from a southern themed resteraunt.  I would defiantly go back!,J2pqWZCkI3_M-hiGRly-NA,1,1,4,_6wDI-HV1MLe3j_WvDinbw
273770,2012-02-20,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"Because i think the place has potential Ill start with the positive. They have Blue Bell ice cream!! anyone whos from Texas but lives on the west coast knows what Im saying when i say i was extremely happy to get a bowl! Ok, thats the good... 

Now the bad... The ordering system is a total joke, they have no idea what is going on from the servers to the serving line. They give you 1 card per table that you take to the line, each person orders food, they add it to the card then you bring it back to the table and the server totals it up and brings you the bill. Sounds easy right? Wrong, it would help if anyone at the serving line spoke english, everone is confused, you cant do seperate checks, they are so confused and frustrated that it seems to give them attitude at the line. The management really needs to get a grip here and do something to help this rediculousness.

The BBQ itsself is just OK, ita a TX style dry rub which is cool but unfortunately it just didnt taste that good. Oh and someone needs to teach the guys at the serving line how to cut meat, with the grain??c'mon. The jalapeno sausage was weak, no jalapenos in mine, the corn on the cob that i had for a side was dripping w butter on one side and dry as leather on the other. 

Like i mentioned earlier the ice cream was great, however the bread pudding i had with it was just ok. It wasnt bad, but wasnt great by any means. And then my beer glass smelled like bleach.",H2vxn0os1SORP03wx6IIWQ,2,0,2,CkbcnQfRkiptRezjjG_WFA
442572,2012-01-21,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"Honestly we ate here last weekend because we were staying at Excalibur and it was the least busy restaurant. I kind of like the whole rocker vibe to it, but there is nothing noteworthy about the place. The novelty of the name/band affiliation does not make a restaurant.  The food was typical bbq that I could get anywhere, served cafeteria style..yawn. and as for the prices, give me a break! Even for Vegas it was overpriced and underwhelming. I had 1/2 a chicken, 2 sides and my partner had a pork chop and 2 sides which came to over $40!! I know its on the Strip but its not like this is a fancy restaurant.. 

As for seeing any actual members of the band, not sure if they actually stop by but I did see Vinnie Paul the drummer for Pantera there.  That is about as rock n' roll as it gets.",WQIPStSBdlOy4YfqOIawcA,1,1,2,s2N3DGiuFH9ncx2hFC35UA
523852,2012-03-24,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"I've been going to Las Vegas for about 20 years now and L.S. BBQ is simply the WORST MEAL I've ever, EVER had. Avoid this place TOTALLY!

Why?

1. The BBQ pork sandwich: The pork taste pretty good but it comes between two sloppy pieces of white bread. I dare ANYBODY to be able to pick up this sandwich and eat it without making a huge mess. What a joke....pulled pork bbq soaks right into the bread and it falls apart.

2. Service: Simply put THERE ISN""T ANY SERVICE! You sit down, you have to go get your own sandwich, you return to your table, you eat it without anybody EVER asking ""how's everything"" or ""is there anything I can get you"". Everybody that works there is about 20 years old, ditzy and has obviously never worked in another restaurant in their life.

3. The receptionist: Equally ditzy and doesn't understand english. I asked if during happy hour if we get a side dish with out sandwich she answered ""yes, of course"". Then we are seated and told to go get our sandwich and for $5 that's all you get.

4. You go to the LS BBQ you kinda expect to hear LS music. NO,NO, NO. A basketball game was on the tube and played so loudly you couldn't possibly carry on a conversation with the person right accross the table from you. Geez, if I wanted to watch basketball I'd have gone to a sports bar.

Please, do yourself and everybody a favor and avoid L.S. BBQ. It's truly AWFUL!",xg6IX013gQdwnrc1M9X5JQ,2,0,1,cvzFkhYXs_d4USLG5olcCA

We went in and sat at a table between the stage and main bar. 15 minutes went by,as did 2 ""waitresses"" numerous times, without even glancing our way. Wait---is this a bar? And peiople are sitting waiting to order $7 beers? WTF??? Finally flagged one down, and she said there was no service there, we had to go to the bar. We could get service at the outlying tables.  huh? so we moved. The new waitress was prompt, friendly enough, but screwed up our billing  and then said we would get charged twice if she tried to fix it. Why didn't she just say she didn't know what she was doing?

712472,2012-04-22,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"We ate last week arriving about 9:40 PM.  The hostesses were very helpful telling us about the restaurant and that they would stop serving food at 10 but a live band would be starting so in we went.  Reading some of the reviews I can see some why some people had a problem.  I wasn't sure how it worked so I asked to confirm it was similar to how we do in Texas BBQ joints (which is what the food here is based on and the recipes they use for the meat is Kreuz).  Here you go to the cafeteria line, get a tray and a ticket, order meat by the pound and sides and dessert.  The meat is wrapped in paper (as they do at Kreuz in Lockhart, TX).  You then get your white bread (just like in Lockhart), pickles, butter, etc.  There was a girl at the start of the line to answer questions and explain the process.  The small sides were $4 and that is quite a bit for a side and meat is $4.95 per 1/4 pound.  There are also combos you can order instead.  There were 5 of us and the girl tried to put us on the same ticket and I said no we wanted 3 tickets and we were told no problem.  

The food was awesome! I had ham and pulled pork.  For sides we shared so I got to try the mac n cheese, greens (collard I think), macaroni salad and BBQ beans.  All of it was delicious.  My cousin had the jalapeno sausage and loved it.  Another cousin said the brisket was good.  Everyone I spoke to in the line spoke English so there was not problem there.  I also had a piece of pecan pie, it was OK.  

A couple of minutes after sitting down our waitress came for the drink order.  Our waitress followed up so many times and the bus boys were on top of everything as well.  The place is pretty new so maybe there were some kinks to work out but we had absolutely no problems.  

The bank played what I would call classic rock including Sweet Home Alabama.  They were really good, very talented.  We stayed for two sets.  As the night wore on the waitresses did some dancing on the bars.  

Overall, a great night with great food and music.  The prices are reasonable.  I will for sure go back.  In our group were 3 Texans (1 current and 2 former), 1 non Texan and me who goes there frequently and we all thought it was great.",7qJETSYoZ1cp0Cs0MAnZsA,0,0,5,YgDpwxYvLwjsG_lAVq7DSA

It's great if you're on a bit of a budget and want to eat somewhere with a kind of fun atmosphere. I had a scoop of Blue Bell for dessert (hello, yummmmmmm).

1837230,2012-09-17,1,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"I don't even think this place is worthy of a single star. My husband and I were unfortunately staying at the Excalibur and wanted a low key dinner within the hotel. Maybe my hopes were a little too high because I was so excited about BBQ, but I was expecting a lot more. First, we went down to the restaurant and had to wait for over 30 minutes because they had a big wedding party and couldn't seem to accommodate both. When we finally sat down, we noticed that our waitress was always serving the big party of over 20 people. Awesome. It took forever to get our drinks, she didn't ask us if we wanted an app or anything. We basically had to do her job for her. It took a bit for our drinks because they were brought to another table at first. The manager then came over and ended up being our waitress. I wish I had looked at the menu prior to coming here. Aside from apps, nothing appealed to me. No pulled chicken or pork and the menu was really small. 

We ordered fried pickles for an app, and while they came rather quickly, they were not good. They were soggy and not crispy at all. My husband ordered the brisket with mashed potatoes and baked beans. The brisket was actually good. The outside flavor was great  but he had wished he ordered the lean as there was quit a bit of fat. The mashed potatoes were starchy and awful. They were cold when they arrived. The baked beans were spicy than anticipated but were not that good. I ordered the pulled pork sliders (an app) as my meal with a side of mac & cheese. The pork was extremely dry, I had to add a ton of BBQ sauce to even choke it down. The mac & cheese was mediocre, not much flavor but certainly not the worst we ever had.

It took forever for us to get our check. When we got it, they over charged us by $25. Then it took forever for them to run our credit card. We watched as the manager tried to close out our order only to let the waitress with the 20+ person party cut in front of her and use the computer to close out a stack of bills. It was extremely frustrating. Our table was practically on top of the big parties table, and they were an extremely annoying bunch. We think the food completely sucked for the price and we would never go back there again, even if we were given a gift card or a free meal. Plus, some of the waitresses shorts were a little too short for it to be sanitary. I love Toby Keith's & even Hooters on occasion and by no means have problem with half naked women serving my food. But when my bathing suit covers more bottom than your jean shorts and your handling my food, ew... it just completely grosses me out.

Save yourself the frustration and avoid this place!",4aENsAINjFeJc_cbjWEVrw,0,0,1,D8Z5jv-fL2VNM7WbHSImIA

  we just went here because we heard they had a decent happy hour and we were already inside the Excalibur. I didn't expect to find a 5 star.  Many of you may disagree with this rating, but I had no complaints whatsoever:

Pros:
* Texas Nachos were bomb!  Topped with pulled pork and who knows what else!  Amazing!

* Service (at the bar) was on-point!  Everything was basically $5.00 during their happy hour.  

* I ordered a Jack & Coke and got a Jack & Coke for the $5.00 special, not a generic version of the whiskey with Coke.

Cons:

* the only thing I can think of is that you have to venture into the casino to get here...that means fighting traffic (foot and car) and finding a parking!

Overall: I was very impressed.  Who says that the strip doesn't have a decent happy hour!  Definitely a pleasant surprise!

3698056,2012-08-12,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"Ok, I'm mostly reviewing for the service and entertainment they offer. I rarely ever enter the Excalibur hotel. Shame on me for not even knowing that this place existed! It was funny. Our cool and hipster in laws came down to visit, and since they're avid lovers of karaoke, we ended up losing them in the casino and finding them in this place.

The place is HUGE! They have a bar, a stage, karaoke, DJ, host, and fun karaoke entertainers in crazy outfits. We came for the karaoke. They have a wide selection! From Elvis hits to Britney Spears. Up on stage, they also have fun little props for you to use to up the entertainment for all the brave singers. There's no cover, and they also offer free shots if you grab them from the nice promoters who pass them out. The bartenders also get  little jiggy throughout the evening as well as offering free shots to those who are brave enough to dance on stage when they do fun dance numbers for the audience to participate in.

We got this big souvenier goblet with orange slush which cost $14 and that already includes a shot (plus your free shot of 151). Shots of Patron is $12. I didn't try their BBQ since we already ate, but I am curious to try it out. We did have an order of cheese fries which I didn't think was that great. It's focused more on presentation than anything. /the fries are cut into HUGE cubed slices and was very starchy and not crispy like usual cheese fries are. It also had the cheese on the side. 

This is definitely a great find, and surely a fun place to hang out at for college students that are on vacation. The servers were also very friendly and attentive. Not pushy at all if you don't order food, and just drinks. 

Can't wait to go back and party, eat, drink it up, and surely karaoke it up!!!!!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,2,0,5,J1_HFLVk2_BqnhVJSAiPtQ
3734235,2012-02-03,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"""Sweet Home Alabama"" this place is no Curt's BBQ, Oklahoma Joe's, or Jack's Smoke Stack. The BBQ is better than Famous Daves or Tony Roma and gets a 9 for the tender fall off the bone spare ribs. Hands down the spare ribs were the most tender spare ribs I have ever had in my life. So why only 3 stars you might be asking.

I ordered a slab of rib for $47 (must have come from the golden pig) and true to Texas BBQ the meat had a good hickory flavor, but not to over powering, just the right touch however; lacked that I can eat the meat without any sauce seasoning. The house BBQ sauce here is great, a mixture between Sweet Babe Rays; Open Pit, and Mauls. The meat was a little bland and required some additional seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to make the meat right. $4.75 for a 1/4lb does not apply to the spare ribs. The Spare ribs are $4.75 a pound with no sides included. Save up to go here because you will break the piggy bank.

I also, tried the pulled pork sandwich which was very good. The draw back was the thin 2 pieces of white bread that the pulled pork was served upon. Maybe they did not get the memo that this is a restaurant and presentation is a must to stay in business. I thought my younger brother made the sandwich. No sides of pickles, slaw, or anything. Just pulled pork on 2 thin pieces of white bread for $5 ouch.

This place gets 3 stars because the food is slightly above average however; the prices are ridiculous. Another Las Vegas BBQ place that has potential however; destined to fail and fall by the waste side because the prices are to high and place remains empty most of the time while paying ridiculous lease rates to the casino. What a waste, I would eat here in a pinch however; I would never bring a party of 2 or more here to eat, drink, and socialize because the place is to expensive. Granted that spare rib allowed 5 people to have 2 bones each however; filler, filler, filler I had to do some crafty things to fill everyone up. The staff is great, even the young girls with the trap stamps and skimpy clothes, but the place was empty in Las Vegas at 5:30 pm on the Thursday before Superbowl Sunday. The 3 sports bars that I passed up at other casinos to get to this place were busier than heck and I thought that I might encounter the same at Lynyrd Skynyrd, not.",vDs0gOSw71J29sQHjzrs9A,1,0,3,YormxgT1oaIuiKraRw6KyA

Naming a restaurant after a band who lost three members in an airplane crash at the height of their success might have been a bad omen, but I am sorry to see them close down because their BBQ was quite good. 

I sampled one of their Pitmaster Combos on my last trip at the castle that included two succulent pork ribs, two very large portions of ham, and a moist hunk of quarter chicken. 

And unlike other BBQ joints that grill their meat, slather it with a pungent sauce, and then grill it some more, this place let the meat speak for itself. They simply seasoned it with a bit of salt and black pepper, finished it with a dry rub of cayenne pepper, grilled it until it caramelized and sweetened, and served it at that perfect point where the meat is ready to delectably fall apart. And if you wanted BBQ sauce to go with it, they offered a trio of tangy sauces to suit every palate.

Another downside to this place closing down is the loss of neat cocktail spot in this area. Their drink menu was quite off the beaten path with fun shots like the Death to Miss Piggy (bacon-washed Souther Comfort Fiery Pepper) and the Jack and Pickle Back (Jack Daniel's and pickle brine), and cocktails like the Double Wide Baconator (more bacon Infused SoCo Fiery Pepper, some Lillet Rouge, maraschino cherries and Angostura bitters), and my favorite, the Honey Badger (Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, some apple cider, Whiskey Barrel bitters, DiSaronno, lemon and a touch of cinnamon.).

It is cafeteria style so if you're hungry that's a good thing because you eat right away. My only dilemma was deciding which side...I went with Mac and cheese and it was awesome. Topping bar...all you care to have pickles, tomatoes, jalapeños, onions, etc. The $9.99 price was posted at the entrance but not on the menu so I had to ask for it, otherwise the menu was very pricey.",6JehEvdoCvZPJ_XIxnzIIw,0,0,5,YFEepsk1bh7CZ0MYE9VSrA
5079055,2012-02-27,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"Once we got to our hotel I was determined to check this place out. The layout is cool and the vibe seemed fun and fresh. We passed it up a few times and then we were offered two for one drink specials. I asked the girl handing out the coupon if they were still serving food and she said yes. I asked can we enter at the this door, (there were two entrances) she said no problem. Once we got in we had no idea where to sit. We were hungry so we grabbed a table hoping this would get a waitress for us. After about 15 minutes we had no service. We decided to go up to the food counter - buffet style and order ourselves. Since we had never been there we just ASSumed this is how it works. The people in the food area were SOOOO friendly and helpful. They even gave us a deal because it was closing time. So I asked them how it worked. The said take this ticket to your table or the bar and someone will ring you up, more than likely your waitress. We ate and still had not seen a waitress, no waters, no opportunity to order a drink, nothing. Finally after an hour and 30 minutes of no service my husband approached the bar to pay. We had a food comp so he was going to use that. The bartender had no idea how to ring it up so she called a manager. Once the manager arrived my husband explained how we had no service. Apparently we were directed through the wrong door so no one ever knew we were there. He said well the girl said to go in that way, the managers response ""No I dont think so, she was probably on break"" She hands out drink tickets on break? IDK!  All and all the place is far to overpriced for the food or drinks. I believe its knew and maybe that explains the lack of service and untrained staff. I think someone needs to come through and retrain everyone. The idea of the place is great but the lack of follow through is poor which makes it just another joint that you only go to if you have too.",LHT4AADPgWT0BM4tZKCz2Q,0,0,2,1A4uHx2L3YAGRZnfnshz8w
5397889,2011-12-18,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"I'm from the south originally (Skynyrd's hometown actually) so I have high expectations for BBQ places. This place is worth checking out but it's not among the best BBQ I've ever had. 

You order your food here cafeteria style. The meats are about $4.75 for a 1/4lb (I'd get a 1/2 lb instead, especially if you are going to share), small sides are $5 and large sides are $8.The small sides are plenty for one person but again to share you might want the large ones. I had the beef brisket which was a little fatty but pretty good. The mac and cheese was very good and I also enjoyed the BBQ beans, though they had a sweeter flavor than they do at most places. 

As for the drinks, you can't go wrong with the Honey Badger (cider with Jack Daniels Honey). This place may not be quite the BBQ you'd get in the south but worth a try on the Strip.",j7Ew20Kh33lFEaUXW1rGNw,3,2,3,HoxSfTXRh2yQWBdSvkQ_Vw

5694405,2011-12-30,0,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"I am a fan and waited for this place to open. Had a rare night out as a parent and jumped to go..I was so disgusted with everything! Skynard lager tated like a bud light, cafeteria style with cold horrible meat. Ribs were cold and brisket had to be changed it was not edible. You eat out of paper and a cold tray and the bill was over $45. The way you order the meat is like I am at a deli. Fast food for gourmet prices!! Manager took 10% off but I felt that my one night out was a waste..Carl's jr was better then that food. Worst was they played pop music and not even any southern rock. No points for food, no points for ambiance, no points for anything!!! I even wrote some critiques on the Facebook page and they removed it...not even an email back stating they were sorry for my bad experience....really!!!!",XBjk98sYZa_0lGLzAGIuJw,1,0,1,2xfeCBgZZ3GaKcJ1zKZRIg

5755262,2012-01-04,2,S6GcR_UsJhVkNoypqfx7Lw,"When I recently discovered via the internet that the Excaliber Hotel and Casino in Vegas had recently opened ""Lynerd Skynyrd BBQ & Beer"" I knew I had to check this place out. We were planning to go to Vegas for New Year's so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to stop by. I read their website which mentioned that a ""member of the band might even stop by at any time"". Having been a Skynyrd fan since their  (Pronounced 'Lh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd) days, I was looking forward to see what this new BBQ joint had to offer. 
First of all, this place has little to do with the actual band, other than the fact of the name. There is little evidence of Lynerd Skynyrd 's prescence in the joint, other than a painting on the wall. They also do not even play Skynyrd's music. The place is owned by drivethis entertainment consortium, which also manages rhumbar, Tacos and Tequila, and American Burger Works. It other words, it is owned by a corporation, and has little to do with the actual band. 
Not only was this discouraging to this Skynerd fan, but the place is unorganized and the staff seems perplexed as to what customer service is all about. When we entered the place, there was no hostress to sit us or greet us. We wondered over to the ""chow line"" ourselves since we saw other people standing there ordering food. When we made it through the line, the cashier asked us if we had a ticket and we told her no, that no one had given us one. We sat down at a empty table (again no waiter or waitress at this point). I went to the bar to order beers since the waitress never approached us.  The Corona's were $7 each. I asked the bartender if a band was playing later in the evening since they had a stage, but she couldn't give me an answer. 
While we were eating, I noticed the staff chit chatting with each other as other customers were as confused as we were. I noticed some customers leave in anger and or confusion. I summoned the manager over and spoke to him about our experiences. I mentioned to him that his staff seemed unaware that hte customers were confused, or they just didn't care. He listened to what I had to say and he asked me to jot down some things so he could remember them later. He seemed interested in what we had to offer as far as constructive criticism and he even paid our tab which was nice of him. That's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. So if you're in Vegas and want a Lynerd Skynyrd experience for ol' times sake, download it on your I tunes, because you won't find it here, nor Southern hospitality. To their credit, the turnip greens were not bad, and the sweet potatoes were decilious. But the barbecue needs work.",J18ol0RI1TuyqGKFZJfh3w,2,1,2,Rii9O-QpIoNSencRIPPR9A
