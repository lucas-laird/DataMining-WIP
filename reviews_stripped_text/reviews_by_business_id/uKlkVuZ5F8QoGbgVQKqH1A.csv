303418,2012-08-06,1,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"After my husband's birthday party at KISS Mini-Golf was said and done, a handful of us decided we weren't quite ready to head home.  While hanging out in the parking lot discussing our options, we noticed the sign for Firkin.  Having my handy Yelp knowledge, I knew this place just opened and that they had over 40 beers on tap.  I was easily able to sell my friends on the idea of hanging out there for the rest of the (late) night.

The space inside of Firkin is quite large with plenty of seating for dinner, as well as a large bar and a lounge area with couches and pool tables.  Everything is new and shiny and there are plenty of TV's to catch a game.  The employees were super friendly and very knowledgeable despite only have been open for a few weeks.  Everyone in our group really enjoyed the atmosphere here.

They offer specials almost every night of the week, and for this particular night (Friday) they had $3 well drinks and house wine.  Sadly, I didn't get to take advantage of these offers having had too much to drink at the party beforehand.  My friends, however, decided on getting one of the many draft beers available and they were able to sample a couple to see what they liked before putting in their orders.  I'm not sure if it's standard procedure to get samples or if they were being nice to us since we wandered in at one in the morning; either way, my friends were grateful.

Firkin offers a full menu but I didn't have a chance to check it out to see the items or pricing.  They also have a limited late night menu from which I ordered the onion rings, one of the few vegetarian choices I saw.  The onion rings were good but a bit too greasy for me.  For the late night menu, think typical pub fare like fish and chips and lots of appetizers.

My friends and I were all glad that we made the walk over the parking lot to give Firkin a try.  It was nice to sit down and hang out by the bar to eat and drink and then move the party on over to the lounge area.  Things are a little slow there right now since they are new, in a parking lot with a ton of dead retail space, and their location has a blocked view from Hard Rock.  If tourists were smart, they would come over to Firkin to pregame with cheap drinks before heading over to Hard Rock for the clubs or gambling.

I definitely recommend for the good atmosphere, huge beer selection, and great drink specials.  

In the same parking lot as KISS Mini-Golf, across Harmen from the Hard Rock.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,7,5,4,dc8tl48XIK7cFmExfOcyrg
336466,2012-12-10,0,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"My wife and I were driving southbound on Paradise after visiting the strip. We saw this British Pub and decided to go in for a late lunch on a Sunday, so there were a few people in the bar/restaurant drinking beer, eating food, and watching the late games.

We were helped right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. We were provided with our menus and decided to just drink water. The waitress was friendly, but kind of quirky. She was an outstanding water water-re filler (one of the best ever actually)

I ordered the curry chicken and my wife ordered a blue-cheese hamburger. The waitress returned a few minutes later and informed me they were out of the chicken curry. I chose the Chicken Marsala instead.

We waited about 20 minutes when our food arrived. We observed the wait staff and it seemed the waitstaff were a bit disorganized in that we had a couple different waitresses helping us and we noticed some other patrons seemingly being ignored for an extended period of time after their arrival.

The food was really good actually, considering it's a ""British Pub."" We did notice a weird thing at the bar behind us. One of the bartenders was making a mixed beverage in front of a patron. She asked the patron if he wanted to taste the drink. He said he did and she allowed him to sip some of the beverage from the straw. She then removed the straw from the drink, discarded it, replaced the straw, then served the drink to another patron on the other side of the bar. We thought this was kind of unprofessional and potentially unsanitary.

Anyway, we thought this place was not bad and has a lot of room to be successful in that they can be a sports bar with all the nice HDTVs, all the space, and the play on words with the ""Firkin'"" name.",4CDQnnCtSxk-c8hDPZtOmA,1,0,3,FuxGwGvjkKfTPsuDrK44-Q
364507,2012-09-26,0,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"As a local who loves a good beer and a nice establishment - especially places that are smoke-free - this new bar and pub is wonderful.  For anyone who works at/near UNLV, the University district has been waiting for a place like this.  I have been to the Firkin twice in the past 5 days.  Here are my thoughts.  First things first, the beer.  They have a great selection of draft beers for a wide range of tastes.  Tuesdays are 2 for 1 pints, which is a great special!!  All day long!!!   They have a bar for self-tap beer, although I haven't seen anyone use it.  The food has been very good so far too.  The wings are awesome and come in about 15 different flavors.  The Red Thai and Bourbon wings are my Favorite!!  The Suicide is near-death - eat with caution!  Potato skins and Irish Nachos are great.  But the killer dish here is the Bread Pudding!   Yes, I said Bread Pudding!  You must try the Bread Pudding with a scoop of ice cream!!  

The Firkin has daily specials which can make your experience better if you save money.  Thursdays and Sundays they have football specials with great deals on beer and food.  Tuesdays are 2-for-1 pints all day long.  

There are 2 pools tables, a shuffleboard table, and darts - for those of you looking to play games while socializing.  Lots of televisions near the bar for great sports viewing.  Honestly, this place has everything. 
 
All in all, this place is a great addition to the campus neighborhood.  I hope business is good for them and they can stay open for a long time.",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,7,4,4,GGt4S4HpJbjXM1Gl7hd2Kw
434410,2012-12-08,1,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"Went here because of the Groupon and because I heard an ad on the radio decided I wanted to try it.  As a chef and a beer lover, I rather enjoy trying these British pubs.  The first thing we saw when we walked in was a member of the staff taking an irish car bomb with some customers.  Afterwards, my friend and I waited at least 30 minutes at a table for a drink before we decided to sit at the bar.  The waiter came over and blamed the long wait on the bartenders.  Once there, the bartenders were nice, however they were a bit uneasy which makes them seem unfriendly.  The Manager stood at the end of the bar the whole night, which I didn't really see him do anything.  He could have touched tables or something.

The ambiance was ok.  It isn't exactly an authentic pub but there are TVs and layout is decent.  It is a modern american twist on a British pub which I would honestly have preferred for them to pick one or the other because the attempt comes off as very tacky.

We ate the Irish nachos, which were pretty good.  It is actually just cheese fries but it was a creative name.  It is a shame that the service was poor, I would have liked to try some more of their food.

You would need to pass on your table to someone who can take care of it at least until you're free. We were kept waiting and didn't make it on time to our next destination.

1000619,2012-12-04,0,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"An hour into our visit to this faux British sports bar, and my boyfriend and my impression of this place was just as empty as our tabletop.  We came with high hopes to find a nice place to revisit for a beer and dinner but left with a pocket full of saved tip cash, a salty tongue and zero intentions of returning.

Without exaggerating, we literally sat at our bar booth for an hour before the rude waitress took our food order.  20-30 minutes later, food arrived to our table that we didn't even order.  Keeping track, we're nearly an hour and a half into sitting at this poor representation of a pub and we still haven't tasted any food.  The reason for our commitment to this place was a pre-purchased Groupon.  Alas, my feeble attempt to use tactics as learned by Extreme Couponing had totally backfired.

Apparently to the waitress we weren't deserving of an apology, instead the food runner apologetically returned with our correct order 10 minutes later while the moron waitress dodged our glances.

At this point I'm starving but not even my Blue Moon could help me win the battle with my terribly over-salted tuna melt.  Ok fine, in their defense, the french fries were good and the bartender was friendly but the meal was already ruined.

My advice would be to go for the french fries... but get them to-go... and from The Hard Rock next door, you're sure to find similar tacky decor browsing the Motley Crue display without having to endure horrible service.",L5qaTqV4Q4AzMsy6YjrNOA,0,0,1,VVM3fE9dYyzcIm3EZPOErw
1020949,2013-01-05,2,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"Came here twice in a month. First visit I had the fish n chips which was perfectly cooked and battered. The fried outside wasn't too greasy, was light and crunchy. The cod on the inside was nice and thick to offer enough bite to the fish so you don't feel like you're actually eating a fish stick. The peach cobbler takes a little time to bake as they make everything from scratch using fresh peaches. When asked how fresh is it, our waiter said ""it's so fresh we don't milk the cow for the ice cream and we don't grow the peaches"", and gave a big smile. I really like places where the servers give a bit of humor. 

The 2nd visit I had a groupon and the boyfriend and I got 3 entrees for 2 of us. We had bangers and mash which was so good I am never going back to Hofbrauhaus for sausage. Another entree was the Jameson grilled salmon, man that was good! The salmon is fresh, not frozen as it was still juicy and moist on the inside and wasn't even overcooked or dry on the outside. The Jameson sauce has a sweet onion taste to it, but it's not overly sweet or sugary, it's just enough to enhance the flavor of the salmon. The chicken pot pie had a super flaky and crispy crust with wonderfully cooked chicken inside. I was expecting hard chicken cubes like I normally get from overcooked chicken pot pies, but this one was really impressive as the chicken was in large enough chunks to taste like chicken and they were moist. 

With a wide array of beers and gourmet food at an affordable price, especially from a college student, I want to be back to check out the beer specials.

At one point, the music cut out and a few people cheered. We were there for almost 2 hours and I think 2 good songs played which were some good ol' Damian Marley tunes.
I loved the choice of 42 beers on tap and you cant beat the $1 PBR on draft either. Although I'm not a big fan of PBR, I am however a broke college student looking for a cheap buzz haha. I got the half tuna melt sandwich with sweet potato fries which was delicious and my boyfriend got the fish and chips which he said tasted like it was made earlier and just thrown back in the fryer to reheat.
The server was very attentive and nice.

1568434,2013-01-16,0,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,Went in on a groupon deal that I had acquired. I had been craving fish & chips for some time so even though I looked through their menu (not entirely just British) I ordered up the 2 piece. Have to say that the fish was greatly cooked - nice & flaky & clean tasting. Sometimes some places their fish just doesn't taste clean. Large size pieces - waitress had said they were 4 oz. filets (w/o batter) but man they had to of been more like 10 or 12 starting off before the fryer because they were large even after been cooked. Only complaint is that the inside crust that was against the fish was soggy. It didn't make the outside soggy but the inside so it wasn't completely crispy & flaky all the way through - like they forgot to pat the fish dry before frying. For that reason I ended up removing all the batter from the fish & eating just the fish (probably best for the health too.) Came with french fries - meh - just your average bar fries - nothing special that you'd want to write home about. They've got quite a few different beers - thank goodness they have Strongbow on tap. I could sit there all night just drinking that although after our food plates were move the waitress never came back to see if we need more drinks. I'd go back again. Will have to try Crown & Anchor again to see if Firkin has beaten them out as Crown & Anchor had the best fish & chips hands down in town.,uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,3,W4kl_2RRQm-nbBmSomcIcA

We got used to confused blonde merely setting things down and then us rearranging who got what. The garlic fries were good but everything else was okay. Fish and chip portions were small, the fish was smaller than the chicken tenders.  As far as a pub, its just a bar covered in tvs, that serves some British beers.

Take your well earned dollars and put 'em to use elsewhere (1)

The only thing that made Firkin at least bearable was the knowledge that we paid for our meal mostly with a Groupon deal. Other than that, our experience here was poor.

We came here Monday night during a football game and they had jacked up the volume to ear drum splitting levels. The hubs and I were literally texting across the table because we couldn't hear each other even though we were shouting at the top of our lungs. 

We'd come primarily to taste their English pub food and not to imbibe. However I'm thinking the food probably would have tasted better if you were f&*king trashed to hell.

We ordered the Apple Cobbler, Chicken Pot Pie, Tomato Soup, and the Baby Spinach salad. Of the four dishes, the only ones which was vaguely edible was the salad and the soup. 

I ordered the baby spinach salad with bacon, tomato, pine nuts and dried cranberries with balsamic dressing ($8.95). The pine nuts were raw. The tomato was mealy. The bacon was served in ungainly large chunks while the dressing was completely generic. But at least this was the most edible thing we ordered.

The tomato soup ($4.95) paled in comparison to good ol' Campbell's soup. It tasted like warmed over ketchup with very little complexity and no basil flavouring to speak of. But again - at least edible.

What wasn't edible was the two items that required pie crust. Undercooked, it was doughy and completely unappetizing in both the chicken pot pie and the apple cobbler. The chicken pot pie's crust was simply not cooked and soggy. Add the gloppy pie filling consisting of macerated chicken pieces, carrots and celery, it made for an unappealing dish.

In the apple cobbler, where the pie crust served as a base, the chef had obviously neglected to pre-bake the crust underneath the pie to actual cook the pastry. Throw in the fact that the crumble topping was not even browned, it was an all around fail.

Perhaps  the only redeeming quality of the place was that the servers were pleasant and they tried to do their best despite the loud noise and the obvious kitchen issues.

Thankfully, we had a Groupon to use at this culinary wasteland and therefore did not pay full price for the items we were served. I pity others who have. For the slow kitchen and poor quality food, this place rates a 2-star and only because our service was okay. Would not recommend.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,3,2,Hr0xLi7VMIPK6CpiKbS_gg

And it was just cheese, green onions, bacon, and sour cream.  Who puts bacon on nachos?  They were more like haphazard potato skins. The Irish nachos I crave from Callahan's have refried beans, jalapenos, salsa, etc.  I also had a blue cheese and steak salad which was so so.

On the plus side, the server/bartender had a great accent and adeptly managed the entire restaurant on his own.  And they had Innis & Gunn Irish Whiskey Cask on tap, which was super yummy!  Their beer list isn't all that impressive to me, but ask... they have some gems hidden back there.

I've been here a few times for co-workers going away parties. So I'd say the majority of my experiences here have been for beer n' app's. Not too shabby, they do make a pretty mean onion raaang. So when I saw that they were doing a Groupon I jumped at the opportunity.

On a quiet, no plans, just back from vacation, not really feel like hanging out with anyone kind of night my wife and I decided to redeem the Groupon and grab some grub here. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in and UFC was playing on every TV and blasting over the sound system. It was kind of weird that this was a Saturday night and outside the bar they weren't advertising that they were showing the fight and they had food specials listed Mon-Fri, but nothing on this Saturday night. Huh? 

So I went with the chicken strips, which sounded like they were made in similar fashion as the fish n' chips. Whoa, these were world class bad strips. Over cooked, stringy, and a batter that just tasted poor. The waitress was fantastic and took these back and offered to bring me something else. I went with a plain ol' cheeseburger, which was real good. Nothing special, just a good bar burger. My wife went with the parmesan grilled cheese. Here's the problem, they ran out of parmesan bread, so it was a plain grilled cheese. The part I don't understand is that when you run out of an item, why do you just assume that somone won't know that the item isn't as described and serve it anyways? Como que what? It was a decent grilled cheese, every 6yo in the world would have been satisfied. The bread pudding was very good and I would recommend that. 

So overall it was a pretty poor dining experience. I would still come here if someone was having a party of sorts, the beer is great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to break bread in this establishment.

And, well, I'm glad I did.

I came here with a group of 6 people to meet before we headed on down to see the Evil Dead musical. We were greeted by 2 different hostesses which was an immediate thumbs up in my book.

Our server was super silly which made the evening fun, he recommended all sorts of different beers and specials which was really helpful. Pabst for a buck if that tickles anyones fancy.

The interior is really awesome and still clean because it's new so that's a plus and there are tv's and pool tables.

Onto the food. I had the Turkey melt which is really fresh tasting turkey with avocado, cheese, and mango chutney grilled panini style with garlic fries. It is... SO, so delicious, I highly recommend it. Pretty much everyone at the table wish they had ordered it too. My boyfriend got the tuna melt which he thought was great as well. Other food items ordered were the grilled cheese, the meatloaf, fish and chips, and a burger. Everyone loved their meals, but apparently the burger was voted as ""meh"".

Overall it's got great food, the atmosphere was nice (except the night we were there one half of the place got super clubby and annoying, not that I don't mind a little dubstep but seriously, it just didnt jive with the rest of the place), service was cool, and the booze specials made it that much better.

I normally don't drop names of other establishments in my reviews, but when it comes to beer I take things seriously. That being said, I have mixed feelings about Firkin.  There are definitely a few things I would improve.  Overall though this place is an awesome addition to the Vegas bar scene and I look forward to future visits!  Let's begin, shall we?

Beer first!  With a name like 'Firkin' you would think they would have cask ale (google it!).  Unfortunately, there was no cask ale, although I was told by the bartender and a woman that appeared to be a manger that they were working on getting cask ale.  I am hopeful that Firkin will join the ranks of Todd English Pub and Public House as establishments that serve cask ale (and hopefully they serve it properly).  

The beer selections are mostly English ales, a few of them being the mediocre Newcastles and Guinnesses of the UK.  The selection of fine US craft beer suffers at the expense of the bar's theme, I suppose.  They did have Firestone Walker Union Jack, Double Jack, and Dogfish Head 60.  I enjoyed an Innis and Gunn Rum Cask ale.  They also have 10 rotating seasonal self serve taps that make things kind of fun!  Watch out though because their beers range from $6-8 a piece, although they do have deals on Newcastles.  Overall, the beer selection is great for Vegas bars, but disappointing compared to the likes of Aces and Ales or Khoury's Fine Wine and Spirits.  I am fine with this considering the crappy beer served in most Vegas pubs, like the Hofbrauhaus across the street.

On to what I really loved, the food!  I ordered the house French Dip ($11.95).  Not a bad price for a tourist place.  The roast beef was really juicy, the onions grilled perfectly, and with the touch of horse radish on a baguette bun, this was an amazingly delicious french dip!  I tried a bite of my friend's curry, and although a little sweet for my taste it was full of flavor and quite delicious.  Their perfect french fries were lightly battered, yet still light and fluffy.  Very good food at an affordable price makes me a returning customer!

The atmosphere is nice and social; no slot machines which is a plus in my book.  Lots of TV's.  The staff was very friendly, although somewhat lacking in beer knowledge.  I expect that the staff will be educated as the place evolves.  The promised addition of cask ale is exciting.  I would like to see them hire a Cicerone who also knows about cask beer (www.ukbrewing.com FAQ!).",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,7,2,4,0W4fpQoQCLzioMSyv4vweA

The food was OKAY, I ordered the fish and cips (niblets) and Pizza. The fish and cips are delicious and as for the pizza; had to request that they brown the crust due to my friend's order being too doughy.

She suggested the slider which was on special that night. My friend said to bring 1. When it finally came out, it looked like it was a 2 day old burger cooked on a trash can. I know that sliders aren't exactly an attractive meal, but even the waitress agreed when we complained. She had the manager come to the table. We were expecting an apology and simply offering a suggestion for the disappointing food. Instead, we got a rude, bad attituded person. His statement was ""What do you expect, it cost a dollar."" We are locals that frequent restaurants in the area several times a week. Since we have watched the entire transformation of this location from failing businesses, we were excited to try this out. We can definitely overlook the small stuff with a new business...but when the manager has a poor attitude and incapable of solving a simple situation, it leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. 
All 3 of us drive the very large (25+ passenger) limos in this town. We are always asked about a good place to eat. Everyone loves a great local pub atmosphere with good food. Unfortunately, we are very opinionated and will make sure that everyone we know hears about our experience.

Both times I was with excellent company who weren't shy to share their nachos, wings, fries, etc.  So far I've had the Fish and Chips, it's alright and the two pieces of fish is huge.  The wings are good but a pinch less in flavor compared to Wing King and not as cheap as Wing King either.  My favorite item there though is their french dip.

The inside is really nice and clean, well-decorated, and somewhat in keeping with the British theme. It feels more like a restaurant than a bar, which is exactly what I was looking for. We need a place to hang out that has a good beer menu, decent food, no smoke, sports on tv, and allows kids! Thank you, Firkin, for filling that void in this city.

I was with a big group and we sampled lots of different items:
chicken fried steak (4 stars)
pizza (2.5 stars - just your standard bar pizza)
fish and chips (3 stars)
chicken pot pie (3 stars)
french dip (4 stars)
bread pudding (delish - a million stars!!!!)

Seriously, the bread pudding was awesome. It has a good texture and flavor, then they added craisins, and it was covered with this Jack Daniel butterscotch sauce, which was amazing. I would have eaten that sauce with a spoon.

The beer list was pretty good - over 30 on tap, with a special emphasis on British/Irish selections, and many more in bottles.

We had the 1 year old with us, who loves walking around and checking things out, and everybody was super nice to her. Our waiter was awesome, quick with our refills, gave good recommendations, and was very friendly. In addition, the food came out quickly, but not too quickly (considering the pot pie). 

Prices were reasonable, overall, but not a bargain.

The space might be too big, considering there were several tables sitting down while we were in there, but it still felt empty. Also, there was only one person sitting at the bar, so maybe it gets rowdier late at night?",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,2,2,4,JqALYUaPLsiocM2Z9KqHdw

I admit, I had this bookmarked a couple of months ago and ended up dropping it off my list due to just the average reviews.  But when a meal is basically going to be free, it really doesn't hurt to try. 

We came in on a Friday night and this place was surprisingly not busy.  Considering it's fairly close to the strip and near the Hard Rock, I expected more people.  We were seated right away and even though the service was good, our waiter must have been a newbie because there was a lot that he didn't know and had to ask for assistance.  I didn't have an issue with this so I will leave service with just good.  

As for their food, all I can really say is it's just a pub with pub type food.  Nothing really on the menu caught my eye, but the prices weren't bad so I'm not complaining. Besides, the meal was pre-paid via Terri's Groupon.  Still Lenting, I had their Seamus' Crispy Fish Sandwich and a bowl of Clam Chowder.  The chowder didn't wow me.  It tasted like your basic Campbell's Soup chowder.  As for their fish sandwich, it's basically one piece of a battered fried fish put inside a bun.  I was starving so I ended up eating the whole thing. It's not bad, especially for the price.  I just don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.   

If you're coming to Firkin On Paradise, keep in mind that this is a pub first, restaurant second.  In other words, come here to hang out and get your drink on.  By the way, I still would consider Steiner's food over Firkin on Paradise.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,7,8,3,eO7gJ9g9n41NfzRhndEYBg

I believe the reason why it was so dead is that it's a non smoking bar and I guess that sucks the fun out of the drinking if your a smoker. Any who my friend and I had 3 drinks and 2 sandwiches totaling $49.60 and I'm not too certain it was worth it. 

Overall it was still a cool joint with a neat concept. The bartenders were friendly, quick to service and the beer and cocktails we good. The music ranged from STP to Soundgarden to Cypress Hill, which I thought was a good selection for this type of bar, but they just need some more people coming through the doors for this joint to get kicking.

Went here after a Styx concert with a girlfriend of mine. We went around 11pm on a Saturday night and was glad it wasn't loud or crowded (I guess it's just bar people hanging around this time). We ordered two appetizers and shared the Firkin burger. In the past, bar food have always been mediocre which made me think that I shouldn't even bother eating at bars or pubs. However, lately, I've been seeing a trend where bars are definitely upgrading their food quality. The appetizers we got were the sweet potato fries and Irish nachos. Both were pretty good actually, which made me think that it's okay to order one of their entrees. They ran out of fish and chips so I opted for their burger... And I'm actually glad I did. I've never been impressed by burgers since every burger joint tastes the same to me (yeah, sorry) but Firkin's burger was perfection! The meat was cooked and seasoned right and was very juicy. I don't even remember what else went in the burger but everything tasted so good. One thing I do remember is that there was a hint of sweetness in the sauce? I also chose the garlic fries as a side. It smelled and tasted so garlic-y and I didn't find out why until I was halfway done and noticed real minced garlic pieces on the bottom. I don't know about you, but this impressed me since they didn't just used garlic flavoring and sprinkled it on top of the fries but they actually cooked it with garlic to give its flavor. Even without a Groupon deal, I wouldn't mind going back here.",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,1,1,4,oj_gZfb5Jn_uuTlxcYHQcw

4451562,2012-11-15,4,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"Yikes, yikes, yikes. Without my Groupon I would have left here a very, very unhappy camper. Luckily, my friend and I were dining on a Groupon I purchased so I just left disappointed and will never be back.

This ""English"" pub has really no Brit to it, besides the interior and the look of the place, which feels more like it is too big for its own britches. With Americana rock n roll playing overhead and volleyball and basketball playing on the TVs I was having a WTF moment the whole time we dined. Add to that the as always menu you will find anywhere for a ""British"" establishment in Las Vegas. A majority of the menu is Americana grub food, not British. 

Okay, so what about the food? I was highly disappointed in both my choices. I got the clam chowder - hardly a chowder, mostly white congealed broth with clams in it. When it arrived at the table it had a sheen on it, like it had been sitting around all day in a big colander in the back. I had to pepper the hell out of it to get flavor. Next - the ""pub dip"" - whatever it is called - it sucks. It is a ciabatta type roll with meandering wads of meat pushed into it served with au jus and a horrid tasting horseradish. I don't know what was wrong with the horseradish, but I'm glad I got it on the side. Why serve this sandwich on a ciabatta roll I must ask, why?! A dip should have nice, squishy, soft bread to soak up the au jus! I was severely disappointed with my meal.

My friend has the fish and chips, and the ""chips"" were fries. Yes, in case you're wondering, ""chips"" are typically much fatter than the ones they serve at Firkin. She said though that the fish was good, but the batter was a bit heavy.

And lastly - my friend ordered a cider drink and received a Boddington's. Of course, I didn't notice this until she offered the half-drunk drink to me because she said she didn't like it. As I took a big swig, expecting cider, I was awash with the taste of British beer... because I have had Boddington's before. And indeed - there on our receipt it even said one pint of Boddington's. Since the transgression had happened to so long ago, and all I really wanted to do was leave this establishment, which had hardly any patrons in it - we relented and paid our bill.

4974415,2013-02-04,1,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"Checking out Firkin On Paradise, we were swayed away from their regular menu because of their Tuesday offering: AYCE Chicken Wings at $12.95 per person!  (It's usually $9.95/lb.)  And when you take advantage of their AYCE wings, you can also get $1 PRBs! 

The Husband and I tried a few flavors - Bourbon Chipotle, Parmesan Garlic, Cajun, Southern Fried, Pineapple Curry, and Buffalo.  Sadly, we weren't blown away by any of the flavors and most were along the sweet end.  I wish the Parmesan garlic had more of a garlicky taste.  It was all served with their Firkin Dip, which pretty much tasted like Ranch dressing.  The wings were served super hot and there was a generous amount of meat on them, so that's definitely a plus.  Because it's made to order, it's probably best to put your next order in once the first order comes out.  That way you aren't waiting as long in between each round.  We probably wouldn't do the AYCE chicken wings again though.

On another visit, we both finally ordered off their regular menu.

* The Butler ""An 8 oz USDA Flatiron Steak served with asparagus and with whipped potatoes."" ($13.95) - The steak was rather under-seasoned, which was apparent by all the Worcheshire sauce I was dumping on it.  The whipped potatoes could have used more butter, perhaps I just expected more butter?

* Traditional Fish N Chips ""Crispy Alaskan Cod hand-battered with our Exclusive Pub-made Beer Batter.  Served with Fries, Tangy Tartar Sauce and a Grilled Lemon."" One Piece $10.95 or Two Pieces $13.95 - The Husband went for the two pieces and what a great choice it was.  It was some really good fish and chips!  And we were also able to substitute the fries with garlic fries, which were also super yummy.  I probably enjoyed more of his meal than my own!

Overall, the food was alright, with the exception of the fish n chips (which is probably what we'd go back for).  Service was fine - it seemed like they worked as a team since many hands touched our table.  (The waiter/waitress took our beverage and food order, the busboys brought out the food, etc.)  We chose to sit at the tables by the bar instead of a booth so we could watch the TVs.

They have a unique beer card, similar to what we seen at a wine bar.  Basically you pay for a card of a certain denomination, but you can sample a little bit of each beer they have on tap.  You can take a little or a lot and it just deducts from your card.  Useful when you just want to sample a bit of everything.  It's self-service and along the back.  They do have happy hour specials along with a decent drink menu with prices listed.

Bonus that they have darts, pool and shuffleboard!",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,4,1,4,yCjJlBSsVTp1xh04TcJ_oA

Spacious and friendly, this makes a good food and drink alternative for anyone frequenting the Hard Rock Hotel across the street.  The salmon I ate was delicious and inexpensive.  The real reason to recommend this place is the eager staff who make this a pleasant stop.  The bartender, Britney, is such a cutie!

We went in on Halloween, and on that Wednesday they were offering $1 PBRs and a sweet AYCE wings deal that my husband happily devoured. Alas, I think it may have just been a Halloween deal. Regardless, the wings came in an impressive array of sauces and looked big and meaty. If you like hot, my husband's tears are a testament that their Suicide fits the bill.

The venue is spacious with pool tables in the back and TVs for game watching. Our service was friendly, even if my husband grumbled once that he wanted his wings faster!

I ordered the BLT & A (avocado) with a salad. I appreciate that the salad is available for no additional charge, and it is a full on bowl worth of greens. The BLT & A was what you would expect of a solid bar BLT. Lots of bacon, thick wheat bread with the added bonus of big hunks of avocado. It was a simple, respectable BLT with just a touch of fanciness. 

The beer selection is worth a visit too. It's not all $1 PBR, but when it is, I am not complaining!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,20,4,T8g-0oFcihVk5SYUp4xtBw

Located in a rather nondescript strip mall off the main drag, it met all the expectations one might have of any Americanized British sports pub, with union jacks galore, pool tables, TVs playing all manner of sports, and waitresses in tight t-shirts. The menu similarly follows suit, with British-y things like Cottage Pie mixed in amongst the usual burgers, sandwiches, etc. I went for their tuna melt and garlic fries, and my friends ordered a mac n cheese and cottage pie. My tuna melt was perfectly good and satisfying, all crispy on the outside with lots of tuna goodness on the inside (plus jalapenos--I always get that as an extra). The fries were also good, nicely fried with fresh garlic, wow. My friend's mac n cheese looked absolutely decadent, and the cottage pie was so cute with its little white tufts of mashed potatoes on top. Overall a fine time at Firkin; it's a friendly relaxed place and they have a Yelp check in deal--10% off your bill from 11-3.",oSN3M4_WKdlTsnpgqPDiBg,6,6,4,HtlFGQgd6Uqy5yiEuyEORg
5373049,2012-10-15,0,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"First experience left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I had sat for 15 minutes in a booth before I was even approached. I saw employees standing around the bar, one server working a few booths, and the bartender picked up a few here and there. I was not in a hurry since my friend was joining me. I eventually got a beer and continued to wait. 30 minutes, 45 minutes, my friend had arrived and no one had approached to see if he wanted anything. At this point, I went to the bar, cashed out, and we walked across the street to another gastropub.

Today, I went back to give it another try. Yet again, off to a shaky start. 10 minutes without being acknowledged. 15 minutes, the bartender came by. I got a beer and it took some time for her to come around to take our food order. Once we got that in, it got better. The food specials are dirt cheap. Service is still a little spotty. I understand that bars are different than restaurants. I just wish that the staff could be a little more observant to their surroundings. It is not like they are rude, they are all downright pleasant, just unfocused. 

The Firkin burger is a great deal. Especially when they do the $7 pairing with any domestic pint. $.50 wings, puts the chains to shame. These steroid birds are meaty, juicy, and not breaded. Sadly, the fish and chips are unremarkable. The breading on the filets and nuggets are too thick. It was crispy, but when you coat anything in a thick shell, it is bound to have a crunch. Firkin's has some essences of a pub, but it tends to lean more towards a family eatery. The mix menu allows for options. This could be a good thing for those who wants pasta and pizzas, but leaves me wanting more of the traditional UK fare.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,3,zGFQdy0LVFqwRjupxii1mg

5376225,2012-11-14,0,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"Go for the beer. It's pretty typical tasting bar food, so unless that's what your looking for, I say skip it.
We went on a Sunday, which this time of year is usually busy times for bars with everyone getting their football on. But we pulled up, it looked pretty empty, just a handful of people at the bar cheering on their team of choice. A few more groups showed up during the time we were there but it never got busy.
The service was okay, our waitress was patient with our first timer questions. But once the time came for her shift to end she couldn't help bugging us while still eating if we'd like dessert and if we'd mind paying the bill. Then we were pretty much ignored by the next shift, I assumed if we wanted something we now had to go up to the bar.
I got some wings, they were good sized and cooked perfect but the sauce was lacking. If you get wings ask for extra sauce. I sampled the Jameson glazed which was sweet, but with hardly any sauce the wings seemed bland. The Sweet chili was my other sauce, not spicy at all but had a nice Asian taste. My hubby tried to order a French Dip but they didn't have any, so he went with a Firkin Burger and garlic fries. The burger was pretty much a dry frozen burger fancied up with toppings. The garlic fries were tasty but I wasn't impressed. Our friends ordered Onion Rings which I got to try, they were big thick batter dipped rings, a tad greasy but still pretty good. 
The Beer Wall is a pretty good deal if you're looking to sample different beer. They usually have 10 to choose from, that you can pour yourself. If your a local and plan on drinking a lot or coming back, they have a Beer Wall special.
Overall the place was over priced and not all that special, there are more and more bars that have a bevy of brews to chose from.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,1,0,3,JocmqnJ2pPKpOPovUcNabA
5390423,2013-02-26,1,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"Visited Firkin several weeks ago before a Thomas and Mack event for some pre-show drinking and dining.  There was some sort of construction/remodeling happening within so they opened late that day, but we only had to wait a few minutes before being let in.

What a great looking place.  Loved the decor throughout, particularly the wood flooring and the magnificent looking bar.  Maybe this is what all bars look like at 3pm and no customers (not a situation I'm used to), but no, seriously, they can't look this good.  Then again it's only been open for a few months, so don't blame me if you visit there in 2023 based on this review and find the walls and floors covered in various dried body fluids.  Plus they use some Banksy artwork on the menu, and you can't go wrong with Banksy in my book

I immediately started with a black and tan because I tend to forget about its existence wherever its not listed, so I always get excited when I see it on a menu and it pokes my memory as to how delicious they are.  This was further confirmed by this Firkin visit.

As for food I shared an order of onion rings with friends, and they were delicious.  Very heavily battered which is the way I like it.  I got one that didn't even have a damn onion in it and I still scarfed it down with reckless abandon.  I will say I almost am never disappointed in onion rings unless they're small and over-fried from say like burger king.  

I also tried the Firkin Burger based on what I thought were several positive reviews here on Yelp.  Now scouring through them I don't see as many as I thought were there.  Anyway, this was a pretty big disappointment for me.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by my neighborhood Bachi Burger which probably makes up 80% of all of my burger dining experiences nowadays, but I thought it wasn't very well seasoned and just tasted average in general.  The fries that accompanied it (because what I really need in my life are more fries) were tasty.

To finish off our pre-eventing, we did a round of Jameson shots (nothing says Ballet like Jameson shots!   Okay so I was going to see the WWE).   Had a quick chat with the bartender who brought us said shots.   From the waitress to the bartender everyone was friendly and the service was fast and efficient. 

Overall I'd say a 3 for the food, but the service and atmosphere make it an easy 4 overall.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,3,4,VXfiVoLkP2TjvdiIdr8AGQ

I am SO glad it was close needless to say! The staff was amazing. The decor was warm, comforting, and inviting. The food and beer selection was what sold us completely.  My husband found a beer that he used to drink but it is not available in our current area. I ordered the mac and cheese with ham. Oh wow. It was so very good. It was not like regular mac and cheese. The cheese sauce was different - but a good different! The husband ordered the chicken pot pie and that was amazing. I took a few bites and it was perfect.

We ordered ""Homemade Tomato Soup"", ""Traditional Fish 'n' Chips"", and ""Mama's Meatloaf."" They were wonderful. The soup was great. Meatloaf is one of my favorite food. The meatloaf here is the best I've ever had. Fish n Chips are also very good. Fish was cooked to perfection, tender. The batter has great flavor. 

They had pretty good beer selections as well.

First time we went there it was just two of us. The service was TERRIBLE. Not just in an oh-well-this-is-just-a-bar kinda way, but clumsy, forgetful, impatient and kinda rude. The food was average and the wait time was unacceptable.
Fast forward and we were in the neighborhood again, this time with some friends. Walk in the front door with a party of 5 and are immediately told there is a $5 charge per person because they are showing some fight on television. It didn't matter that we were just there for a bite to eat, they are charging ticket prices for a boxing match. At least one other party walked away when we did, meaning that for the want of $35 for a stupid fight, they probably lost $150 - $200 in actual food and beverage sales.

This Place felt more of a hipster wanna be brit place. A fabricated idea to satisfy tourists and others that cant make it to the german spot right across or don't want to go inside the hard rock hotel because its too packed or too expensive. Don't get me wrong..looks great but it is just missing ""IT""

There are enough TV's and most of them were on American sports..including nascar.. I was like..uhhh...yeah..thats not right.lol.Place was busy enough but lots of spots to seat. It is kinda too big.

The food was OK.. only remarkable thing was the French fries..Super crispy and very well cooked inside, but other than that everything was just OK. The burger meat was good.A little on the dry side but not bad  . I give it an ok because the French fries came and saved the day again.I ordered a pound of wings..which sounds a lot right? Well there were only 9 wings. We also ordered the Irish nachos..which is circular
cuts of french fries with melted cheese on top on a little tiny plate. Super disappointed on that. Don't expect guac, salsa, nothing..I mean why the heck even call them nachos????.The only impressive thing about the menu was the lack of good food.

Beer selection is pretty decent but the size / price relation is a little off.  Also some beers were only bottled and not even the rare ones. Prices were accesible 

Service... we had to hunt for our server a couple of times. 15 minutes to get our check, refills were slow , however when she was there she was very personable . Not sure if they are understaffed or what .

So in conclusion if you want the vegas version of a brit pub where everything feels fabricated and fake, then you will enjoy it,Dont get me wrong; It is a nice spot that can def deliver some good times but if you are in the search for good euro food ,service,ambiance  and an awesome variety of beer , then Ill recommend to look around for another place.

5959533,2012-11-15,2,uKlkVuZ5F8QoGbgVQKqH1A,"My friends and I are regulars at McMullan's for trivia but we were in the mood to try something new. We heard about the new trivia at Firkin that is on Tuesdays at 7 and were excited to give it a try. They start a little earlier than McMullan's, which is a plus, since it's a work night. 

We arrived around 6pm to get a seat and drinks before trivia started. They have happy hour specials that go until 7 as well as other beer specials that run throughout trivia, which is great. I only ordered an iced tea, and I have to say it was terrible. It was very watered down and didn't taste very good at atll. I'll stick with water or beer next time. Our server was attentive and friendly. One complaint on the drinks was that despite the bar not being overly crowded, about an hour in they began serving beers in plastic cups instead of glasses to everyone. I suspect they either don't have enough staff to handle a trivia crowd and turn around on washing dishes or they need to invest in more glasses. 

We enjoyed trivia, although McMullan's still has my heart. They miscalculated our scores, but when we brought this to their attention they rectified the situation quickly. The food was just ok. I ordered a basic BLT-A sandwich and devoured it quickly as I was starving. It was good, but really nothing special. My fella ordered the pineapple curry wings and these were the star of the show. I really enjoyed the flavor and look forward to returning just for these. I purchased the Groupon that is available solely to try these wings again.
