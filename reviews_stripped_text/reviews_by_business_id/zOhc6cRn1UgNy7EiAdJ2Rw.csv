I told them immediately and they told me to line up at the cashier. After lining up, they told me there's nothing they could do for me. What a waste of time. They are not organized at all. If your kids love chucky cheese, go to a different one even if it's a little far away. The kids here have no manners.

The only complaint is even though you use your play pass card instead of tokens, they still give you paper tickets rather than storing your tickets on your card. And I think it's ridiculous to charge $1 for a wrist band to hold your card. But overall this is great location.


Ok so I wrote my review a little too soon. I went to the front counter to purchase the kids suvoneir cups that they had on display. Their was a couple in front of me at the register, while I'm waiting a lady and her son walks up and stands behind the couple. Once the couple completes their order I walk up and ask the price of the cups the cashier tells me $3.49 then tells me she will wait on me after she waits on the lady who walked up after me!! Excuse me you clearly saw me in the line first, so not wanting to make a scene I waited in total disbelief of how I was just treated. To top it all off I pay for the cups and then I'm told they don't have anymore of them so I ask for a refund after being offered a different cup the cashier tells me to wait while she goes to get her manager, she comes back with a big huge clear bag full of the cups I wanted...smh I kept my composer for the sake of my kids but we will not be coming back here!",OpevAnvx6iYjU_D8NZlyPA,0,0,1,cOh9MBcdbkdIc0YG0_oI8A

The wings are pretty good and they have a small clean salad bar that is acceptable. This place is maintained very well and the bathrooms are pretty clean. The arcade games need some up to date games and the carnival games are such ...carnival games. You spend $20 for tokens and you get tickets so you can redeem items that are worth 10 cents. Wow! Capitalism at its best. This is a kids paradise and with the exception of the jacked up prices, you can be assured that the little ones will have a great time in here. All the employees in here are very helpful and so patient with the children. Good job guys! I also appreciate the fact that they stamp the kids with the same number as the adults that brought them there. Although it is not a perfect system it is a very helpful precaution in keeping the kids safe. What a great idea! Good clean fun with some extra help from the staff.

Nothing was organized NOTHING!!!! my party host was the worst and did the worst job ever!!! She did the cake extremely late and I had a pi√±ata which they never even did by the time the cake was cut the party was over and people were already leaving!! They placed utensils on my table for the party and during the singing of happy birthday the next table beside me decide to come over interrupt ask the hostess if she can take my forks the hostess which her nickname was (nae) short for ojenae  (possible spelling error) and the hostess said yes letting her stop everything to take forks for her table which led to an argument between our tables ruining the entire party I calmed down my family for the kids so we tried singing again and again they interrupt to make comments to me and I had to ignore and the hostess is just sitting there dumbfounded letting the situation go if I had not stopped it who knows what she could have let progress!!! Then when it was over I pulled my hostess to the side asked her why did she allow them to interrupt my party she relied Cuz their forks are on your table, I said where Is mine she replies it's on another parties table I had no room.  I told her that I had 4 adult tables beside the kids table so she had the room. And if I would have interrupted the other party it would have been another fight at the party which I didn't want! Then the list I have that was sent via email explains everything that is supposed to happen at the party and none of it was fulfilled. I am so angered and embarrassed it's unbelievable! Then my mother asks the salad bar lady for 2 forks and she was disrespected when the manager was told she exclaimed she has a history of attitudes we have sent her home several times she has even disrespected us... now my question is if your employer does not have the customer service skills that are required for the job then why are you still allowing it to happen???

We came here on Memorial Day with the kids (4 and 6) for some pizza and fun.  The pizza is similar to Little Caesers, and is perfectly fine for kids, but the fun wasn't as easy to swallow. 

There were at least 6 machines that did not work, yet had no out-of-order sign posted.  While this place isn't the most expensive source of entertainment for kids in the valley, nobody should be tossing their money away due to a lazy staff.

The bathrooms were messy, and the place had an overall dirty feeling to it.  When it came time to cash in the kids' tickets, we waited at the ticket counter for a good ten minutes before being helped.  Do you realize that they have prizes listed for 150,000 tickets?  Can you imagine having 150,000 tickets in a drawer somewhere in your house?  Ridiculous!!

For the money you'll waste here, you're better off doing something outside with the kids, ordering (or cooking) pizza, and then taking them to the toystore; it will be cheaper, healthier, and less mousey.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,0,1,2,2DKltvGFRE2aGp5jJLSKtg

Kinda generic if you ask me. You'll be better off going to The Mini Grand Prix, Pump It Up, Bounce U, or The Discovery Museum for a far better experience.

1769569,2013-04-14,0,zOhc6cRn1UgNy7EiAdJ2Rw,"This review is specific to this location.  We have been to many Chuck E's in the Vegas location, with our usual being in Henderson.  This was our first time here, and maybe because it was a Saturday night it was insane.  This place was packed, tons and tons of kids.  Several games did not work or stole our tokens, but we were very happy with the different selection of games that we have not seen at the other Chuck E's.  Also, there seemed to be a divide of toddler appropriate games on one side and games more skill orienated on the the other side.  When we were able to locate a worker to tell them that a certain machine ate our token, they would give us a few extra (maybe because they secretly knew we would lose many tokens in machines that night).  The tricky part of the token stealing machines is that they would take your token once and let you play, then when you decide I want to play again, it would steal that token.  We did not stand in line for the prizes because there were just too many people.  The soda machine was out of ice, but the all you can eat salad bar was usually always freshly stocked and there was usually someone there to give you a new plate (which used to be required by law, but I have noticed the sign about the health department requirement has been removed from all the Chuck E salad bars I have been too).  As for the gate check guy, he had just left when we arrived to leave and we had to wait about 2 minutes but he was very apologetic.  There was a fight in the parking lot from some individuals who had just left a child's birthday party.  It was rather scary in that some of the individuals in the argument were in cars and there are obviously small children running in the parking lot.  

I would probably try this location again, but will not do it on a Saturday night.",0gXtDaDscQPs8tp-gckMiA,4,0,3,IbXrlgaBOUbuVHL53OB2gg

It was supposed to be from 6-8, but the table wasn't set up till 6:15, the token cards weren't passed out till 6:30, and the food came sporadically over the course of an hour. I'm not trying to be harsh, as I know the establishment was busy, but I feel like setting the table up and loading token cards are things that could've been done in advance - having known the party was booked for several weeks! The real icing on the birthday cake was when our party host used his hands to pack up the leftover pizza! When I asked him about it, rather than admitting his mistake, his response was, ""I just washed my hands. They're clean."" How unprofessional! The manager ended up comping my friend a pizza to go since he touched the other half, but even that man did that half-heartedly with no eye contact. And then wouldn't you know that as we left and our 4-year-old daughter cashed out her tokens, my husband asked if she could just get a 50 token item with her 48 credits as she couldn't decide - and the answer was NO! What?! I was completely disgusted with their lack of professionalism, I don't care how young those kids are in there! Your first job is all about a learning curve, so I hope that someone took something away from the displeasing time we communicated that night. Disappointing experience especially since I've been to this location several times before and they've never quite missed the mark like so many of them did on this visit.

I like the fact that it has quarter games and it's never too crowded. I always get a coupon to get the credits/tokens and have a blast. This place has a much better selection than the other location so I always come here. 

I like playing skee-ball, basketball, deal or no deal, the shark whacking game, bee trap and a few others. I think this is an excellent buy for the skee-ball and deal or no deal because those games are now 75 cents each at Circus Circus! 

The machines almost always work which is a plus. Whenever there is a problem I can always find someone to help me. I haven't seen an out of order sign which is a huge plus. Unfortunately the machines don't calculate the points correctly (especially on the skee-ball) so you can never hit the bonus. I'm never too close to that score anyway but if I was I wouldn't be too happy. I've never had an issue with cleanliness or customer service. I'm not there long enough to use the restrooms so I can't comment on that. But I do love this place and will definitely come back!",7Xbgbb6-zHxeRrUYqyMSdQ,0,0,4,PyCStxM-2q0T1AqeIXmaxw

3819290,2015-07-14,2,zOhc6cRn1UgNy7EiAdJ2Rw,"Perhaps my expectations where that of my younger days at Showbiz Pizza.  What a great time was had by all back then....ahhh the memories of the Rock-a-Fire Explosion band rocking the house while we ate pretty good pizza and played lots of games.  .  

Fast forward to last week and here is what you have....A staff who could care less, machines that don't work and/or out of tickets (the whole reason kids want to play them to collect tickets), a food quality that borders airline level of taste, and all of that equals 2 unhappy birthday kids and one very under impressed impressed uncle.  Wow is all I can say at how simply BAD this place is.  It was actually my birthday last week and since my niece and nephew have birthdays ""close enough"" we decided to celebrate all the birthdays while they were in town visiting.  

The first lady we encountered at the front door stamped our hands to keep us all together (this is about the only impressive thing here other than I saw kids under 5 running out the front door with no one checking their stamp so don't let that false sense of security put your mind at ease).  We then stood in line for nearly 20 mins to give them our money (hello first rule of business...) while I watched several other employees approach the cash registers but then walk away...ONE PERSON working the registers and a line out the door (well done chuck).  What appeared to be the manager was at the front counter but was too busy talking on her walkie talkie to care that the line was so long or to bother to assist in getting everyone in and paid so the line of anxious kids could go play.  I would have walked out after seeing this for a few minutes but thought...""the kids are going to have fun right?"".  Me, the cool Uncle, not only ordered the largest token pack with the pizzas but then ordered another $50 in tokens to ensure the kids would have a great time.  This ended up being a huge mistake.  Out of 6 ski ball machines (which the uncle likes to play), only 1 worked fully.  Missing balls, ticket giver broken, just simply out of order with no sign saying so...and so begins the experience.  I must have put 15 tokens into ski ball machines to realize that they were broken except one (well done chuck).  Lots of machines there are all about winning tickets.  The kids started to focus on those...guess what...out of tickets (well done chuck).  After what seemed like a very long time (was only because the games were not giving the kids the stimulus they needed...hard to when they are broken or malfunctioning) the pizzas came.  I don't want to whine about overpriced pizza at an overpriced arcade, but wow was that bad.  Overcooked, not consistent, nuff said.  After we ate a couple pieces and realized that it was not very good we went back to play in hopes the ticket fairy had filled up the machines again.....ummmm not so much.  

We had not even begun to crack into the $50 token pile yet and we were done with Chuck.  I found ONE machine that was actually giving out tickets and then proceeded to dump all $50 worth of tokens into it just be done.  And thats when the next bit of fun happened.  

We approached the redemption counter behind a line of people (once again, ONE person working it).  We patiently waited our turn for the your lady who was working there (do you know hard it is to keep kids still and calm when its about prize redemption) just then another employee walked up and said ""Can I help you sir"" only it wasn't to me...it was to a guy who had just walked to to the counter.  The lady in front of me said ""excuse me but we have been waiting in line"" to which this young guy in a very rude tone said ""Mamn, you need to come over here"" with a look of disgust on his face.  I am not a violent guy but I wanted to throw that kid out of the front door when I heard him talk that way to a customer.  We finally got our $2 worth of prizes (well the best that $80 of tokens would get) and started to head out the door. 

This was a Wednesday night 7/9/15 at 5:20pm when we arrived (early on not a weekend) so what happened to these places??  My niece and nephew said...""its ok uncle, lets just not go there again"" to which I said ""I could not agree more"" and finished the night off with some DQ ice cream which was the highlight of the evening.  

There are many others things we could have done on their birthdays (and mine) that would have cost much less and been much more fun.  Staff who don't care, machines that are not working, and bad food....what else can I say (you fail chuck). 

PS:  The Chuck E show is not even the band anymore....he's a freakin DJ now (how vegas) and even THAT was not working properly on this night.",MPdjtcD0AGoSxMiPwa7ikg,2,0,1,xTQ5P1LbkWDoydx6YhIFfQ

3996198,2013-11-18,1,zOhc6cRn1UgNy7EiAdJ2Rw,"I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese at 7381 Lake Mead, Las Vegas NV. I just had my son's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese and it was so disorganized. I hope that my guests did not realize it. 

The party hostess was friendly at first, she got our orders for the kids pizza and adult pizzas. She said, okay i have that you are having 14 kids. I looked at her with a startled expression and said, no I am having 20 kids. She looked at the plates on the table and was like ""oh I guess I could of looked at all those plates"". I was like, what have I got myself into. There were clearly 20 plates on the table, but she didn't have the correct information. 

I never saw the party hostess around until the manager saw me getting my own pitchers and I asked for more plates. I had to fill up my own pitchers after they were empty. The tables weren't cleaned off to the very end. I was surprised the cake was ready for the ""Big Chuck E Cheese"" show. The other ""party host / hostess"" seemed more attentive to their guests vs. my party hostess. I am not sure if she just didn't care or if she was overwhelmed with the 20 + kids we had. I have had my kid's birthday parties at other facilities (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone etc) and those experiences were wonderful.  The other party host at (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone, etc) were always around or if they needed to go on break there was always someone else around. Another thing was the ""ticket blaster"", she never explained the ticket blaster, that my son FINALLY went in. She said, oh did he already do the ticket blaster and I was like no I was waiting for you. She said, oh that (and she pointed) party host is doing the ticket blaster. By that time, I just gave up on the party host. I took my son to the other hostess who was wonderful. i always give a $50.00 tip to my party hostess/host but she received a $10.00. I don't even think she deserved that. 

The only thing she seemed to be on top of was handing me the bill.

4014340,2012-10-22,1,zOhc6cRn1UgNy7EiAdJ2Rw,"Ok, so this place isn't really for adults (unless you frequent the one with the Initial D simulation car..yeah!) but I know most of you have had to go to one for a birthday party or been dragged here by your kids!  I know I have!  I really don't like going to Chuck's all that often, the place is always packed!  Plus there's a big rat running around and scaring the bejeebus out of all the kids!  Ha Ha!

I have no clue why everyone loves bringing their kids here for a birthday party.  Do you not love your kid that much?  You like scarring them for life with life-size animated rodents?  My parents took me here when I was a kid and I swear it's the reason I'm scared of clowns to this day.  That and the fact I watched the entire mini-series of 'It' on TV probably didn't help either.  Poor John Ritter!  I would have stuck with Three's Company.

But it turns out now that I'm a parental figure I did the same damn thing to my kid.  ""It's your birthday soon!  Do you wanna have it at Chuck E. Cheese?  Yay!""  I figured out it was because I was too lazy to do an entire party myself!  No wonder!  They take care of the kids, fill them up with carbs and endless refined sugar, bribe them with tokens and tickets, freak them out with a robotic singing rodent band that goes on endless loop, and freak them out even more by making them follow a big rat that tosses out free tickets and sings 'Happy Birthday'.  Top that off by giving parents the option of having beer or wine from tap, and an endless salad bar!  Crazy!  The entire family is screwed into braindead entertainment!  Which leaves Chuck running his rat-A$$ all the way to the bank.  Genius, I tell you, genius.  In the words of famous orator Adam Levine, ""I wake up feeling satisfied but guilty as Hell.""  I am a bad, bad dad.  I don't know why I put my child through this debacle.

Could it be because of the many, many coupons Chuck E. Cheese offers to lure you into their rat trap?  Could it be because of the temptation of having someone else handle your kids for a few precious hours so you can catch a break?  But how is it really a break if you're not allowed to leave the premises without your kid in tow?  I'm looking at you, the guy that stamps our hands at the entrance!  It's like kiddie branding cattle!   

Don't get me started on the food and the prizes!  Their new and 'improved' pizza is marginally edible, and their wings are so-so.  I mean, I can make a better pizza using a DiGiorno box and a toaster oven.  The birthday cake, which is as dry as the Kalahari desert.  And yet, I am enamored by the endless supply of Mello Yello you allow me to throw down my gullet.  Damn my love for Mello Yello!  And of course, there is the all-you-can-eat salad bar.  Which to my chagrin, is fairly stocked with decent fresh fixings.  

Prizes for tickets?!  Is it just me or is this the biggest scam EVER?!  I can go to the 99 Cent Store and get most of these prizes that Chuck offers for pennies!  It's ridiculous!  10 tickets for a Tootsie Roll!  100 tickets for crap my kid will never play with again after we leave!  1000 tickets for a stuffed animal I can get from crane machine for $1 at my local Denny's!  I can't even begin to tell you how many extra tokens you have to buy to get 1000 tickets!  Why oh why did I traumatize my child for life?

Yet, at the end of the day when I see kids (including mine) run up to their parents to hug them and say, ""Thanks for the bestest birtday party ever!"" For a brief moment, we are superheroes in a world of kiddie chaos.  I see how Chuck keeps luring them in.  His evil master plan!  A child's love!  For all the noise, the lacking food, and the excess dollars spent...I fear I will be back here again sometime soon.  Just not too soon I hope!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,2,3,pUUJ3zbJnTdjyVDAQ_kCUg

We went during their buffet hour which offered hard and dry pizza not even pepperoni or cheese was available but I decided to wait 30 minutes for it. My son and I played lots of games which he enjoyed but then since I was pregnant I had to use the restroom. I tried to hold it as much as I can because I was scared to see what I saw on their previous review in regards to their dirty toilets and was afraid I'd regret eating there but the baby was pressing on my bladder and I tried to affirm with myself again that maybe it was just that day but when I came in the bathroom was the dirtiest bathroom I ever walked in and every stall had shit in and on it. I all of a sudden cringed at my decision and started wondering if their kitchen was just as bad. I mean I saw an employee just leave their bathroom and I knew she had to seen it but obviously she didn't care. I'm not using it so I politely told one of the other employees of the situation and she immediately went to try to rectify the situation but when I went in their after she claimed she cleaned it all she did was flush the toilets but their was still poop on the seats.

Games all work, kids have fun, prices are cheap. My only complaint is that they have one cashier working and the line is out the door. So anytime you want to buy tickets or food you gotta wait in that long line.  Sometimes I was stuck in line for 15 mins.",B7ygjO6fbs5IhW2ykL_MQQ,0,0,3,tHRQP0ntDfOjQhNLA5aJRg

However, I must take into consideration the filthy bathrooms and arcade games that aren't working. The staff were all as nice as they could be, but the game area was unbelievable. One game was open with it's mechanical guts all exposed for some kid to trip over and hurt them-self. 

We went recently (our annual visit) to attend a friends' kid's Birthday party. Jaxon was their party host for the 2nd year in a row (they specifically asked for him) and he pulled out all the stops to ensure this little 6 year old had a blast. Jaxon must be Jim Carey's missing love child because he not only looks like him but is totally animated and hilarious like him. He could be a comedian in his own right.

 I just wish the company would take some time to clean this place up since we no longer have the Peter Piper Pizza alternative option.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,5,2,3,XJNH95xNLm21MdI73vn8sw

She was also the hardest worker in there. I watched her clean and bus tables, sing happy bday to the kids, unjam a ticket machine for my daughter and work behind the counter taking care of every customers needs with efficiency and a smile on her face.  And she made sure to let us know we should go to her if there were any desires or concerns.  We will definitely be returning as long as she is here.  Thanks Megan and thanks Chuck E.

There was an incident I was not there for and my sister-in-law reported it to Reyna.  Another child (looks to be 4 years of age) kept licking my 5-year-old daughter's arms and called her a name children should not use.  My daughter told my sister-in-law who then told me.  I talked to Reyna and she had already talked to the child's grandmother who apologized about her grandchild's actions and harsh word.  I probably would have made the situation worse if I had witnessed it first hand.  Thanks to Reyna, that did not happen.  My little girl didn't take what the kid said too lightly, mainly because that was the first time she's ever been called that. (She said he called her a ""bidge."")  But thanks to Reyna's quick train of thought my baby was able to enjoy the rest of her stay at Chuck E. Cheese's.

Instead he's been out none. I just watch two little kids cry because they think Chuck E doesn't like them because he only came out for the party. And now the manager was going to ""see"" if Chuck E could come out for the other kids. Wow this place has gone down hill so bad! Wifi isn't working, game prices are up, no Chuck E. Every half hour like he's supposed to. Now no more tokens just little cards that the kids keep losing track of. Pizza buffet is a joke. Can't keep it restocked.

I can overlook the chaos of hosting many families and the staffs' struggle to keep up with it - messy bathroom, broken ticket redemption machines, no ice, scary salad bar.

I can't overlook their failure to keep what should be their primary mission - to offer a safe environment for our children.  When entering we received the numbered hand stamp however when it was time to leave no one was at the entrance to make sure we left in the same group we came in as.  

My four year old was able to leave through the roped off area without any question from their staff as I followed him out, because no one was there!  When we turned around and brought this to the attention of the overwhelmed staff, they told me they were watching the monitor mounted above the door.  Yet, they couldn't explain how we were able to walk on through without confirmation.  

Never again.",W36hPAvKxSm03Rpvo8eQJg,1,0,1,manL9_WCmt9VsBTE2B7Dmw

I wish it was a little less packed. Its almost too packed. I might try the one near the Grand Canyon Plaza and 215. Our kids always have a great time and I love that they serve Gluten Free Food (the reason for my 4 star rating). That is VERY thoughtful of them. It would be nice if they also had organic options but I may be pushing it.,N8JIVlrbIV2-FkTetAkbnw,0,0,4,LEkngF0JCqKpe-f46MNOpQ

Anytime I needed anything especially adding kids to my party, she was quick to respond. The party went smoothly and Alyssa did a great job at controlling the kids and getting them to participate. This location was clean and to be honest, we come here a lot and it's always a good time. Unlike their other location in Spring Valley where a lot of the machines are broken. The party was done in about an hour and a half and moved very quickly but not to the point that we felt rushed. With kids, it makes sense to keep things moving or else they would probably get bored. Price was not bad. Everyone had a great time, especially the birthday girl.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,10,11,4,vipfNRRC-PrHu7FjQ1cBIg
