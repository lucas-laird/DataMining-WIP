I believe that this is a small family owned business, wife was our waitress and husband is the sushi chef. Not real busy so we were seated right away by the hostess/busboy, wasn't bad seating but wish they would have given us the option. No biggie though. The ambiance is very casual and welcoming, never felt uncomfortable. Once seated, she (the wife) was really nice when greeting us, and we received waters almost instantly. The menu is organized and easy to read, and the alcohol menu is conveniently on the table at each seat. We decided to go with the garlic edamame for an appetizer, which was good but nothing fancy. The gf ordered the sexy girl roll, which she enjoyed and looked great. I went with the AYCE with a Asahi beer and was not disappointed. I pretty much ordered every type of roll and everything was delicious, came out in a timely manner, and looked wonderful. The price was more than appropriate for what we ordered, and everyone was real nice to us as we left.

When I eat sushi, I usually just eat nigiri, so the fish has to be fresh! The fish was mushy and meh. Seaweed salad tasted old and fishy not light and fresh with a hint of ocean flavor. The hot items like Teri chicken and chicken Katsu were blah. Teri chicken tasted like a rubber piece of chicken grilled on a George Foreman grill with a clumpy version of a teriyaki sauce. Veggie tempura was hard carrots, white potatoes and a single green bean. No onions, zucchini, sweet potato...the good stuff. The best thing was the pork gyoza and even that wasn't the greatest. Service was ok but there was only us and another family there. Overall it was just a bad experience.

There were probably 7 or eight tables full with customers.  The d√©cor is a zero.  Looks like they just moved into a four wall spot and just put a sushi bar and some tables in there.  The ceiling looks unfinished as they didn't put a drop down ceiling at all which I think would help the look of the place. Definitely don't be expecting an ambiance.  

We ordered edemame, ebi, spicy California roll and chicken fried rice.  Everything was really good.  The fried rice had slivers of almond in it which was different but really tasty.  I'm not sure if I have ever had almonds in my fried rice but it was a unique touch. I might just come back for that alone!  

The service was an ""eh"". An older woman was our server and seemed to be the only one working the tables and she didn't seem all that friendly or maybe she just didn't know English very well.

1280439,2014-06-18,1,-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA,"We are always down to try a new sushi place. We dropped in here on a weekday for a late lunch. We were one of 2 tables in the place.

From the beginning, it was a lackluster experience. Table for four, including 2 kids. We were seated and not given any menus for over 5 minutes. Any mother knows with little ones, service must be efficient as kids do not tolerate long waiting times. The waitress dropped off the menus and ran off. She came back and wanted our food order. When we told her we were still thinking, she immediately ran off without even giving me a breath to tell her our drink order.  She brought our drinks but forgot one. We gave her our food order and sat. We ordered a veggie tempura appetizer. That came to the table. It was a big platter of tempura but accompanied by the most tasteless dipping sauce. Plus, they only serve it with the tiniest amount considering the dish it was paired with. I also ordered a cucumber salad but never received it so I cannot comment on what it tasted like.  Next we ordered 2 chicken ramen noodles for the entrees. Those arrived and were huge. The broth had no flavor and the chicken was cold. It had clearly just been sliced up and thrown in. It too had no flavor. I thought it would be grilled or marinated or something. Definitely not worth the $9 price, even Top Ramen tastes better. My kids had a veggie noodle dish. I give her credit for getting that out to us quickly, but she did not give them any utensils.

Bottom line, horrible service with nothing to excuse it e.g being busy or understaffed. And blah food.

My Girlfriend and I walked into this ""city"" establishment after I got a haircut from Sportclips, so I'm feeling fresh to say the least. Walked in, and I immediately had that thought everyone has when they walk Into a used car dealership, damn... I have just made a huge mistake... but there's no turning back now... Upon entering, were attacked by a little old Asian woman as if she was leading a Banzai charge in 1942. We were hurried to a far corner table when we were two of four people in the place. The woman promptly put menus on the table and took our drink order and disappeared for only what I can imagine was an immediate intense need to destroy the restroom with a Hiroshima sized deuce because she did not reappear for approximately 10 minutes with miso soup, no drinks. I ate the ""city"" soup, it was ok. At this point the other two patrons of ""City"" sushi departed with a look on their faces as if to say ""I'm definitely going to regret this in about an hour..."" after 15 minutes of only consuming soup and no drink, I made an executive decision to hunt down our ""City"" server so I could inquire about our drinks, and when I found her hiding behind the Japanese partition wall, I declared ""I'm thirsty, may I have two waters please?"" which she replied ""oh yes very gooood."" The hunt being concluded, she brought us water and took our order. The decor in ""City"" sushi is nuts... one wall is gold painted with foam caulking streaming down the wall with paintings screwed directly to the walls without a frame. The sushi was honestly one toe step above sams club sushi, which I gave 1 1/2 stars. I left with a single thought, ""I'm going to regret that decision in about an hour.""",NdEXpAMBQYeWAahAJYaQZw,0,0,1,WEfJEZcTBVu_shhqtJZ_Tg

1466713,2013-11-11,0,-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA,"This review is for their ramen, which is the only thing I tried. I was craving some ramen and still a little hungover from the night before, so I had pretty low standards for food at that point. I ordered some chicken ramen to go. The place was pretty dead when I went to go pick it up, but it still took about 30 minutes to make. The lady that I spoke with was really nice so that's the only reason they get 2 stars. 

Anyway I got home and started eating it. Absolutely horrible. I tasted the broth first and it was slimy and had an off flavor. It had the consistency of a canned chicken noodle soup broth. So I moved on to the noodles hoping I could just make my own broth and at least save the noodles. Nope. The noodles were so overcooked that it was basically just mush once it hit my mouth. I literally just took one bite and threw it away. It was even worse because I bought two of the ramens for me and my boyfriend and we both ended up throwing them out. So that was a waste of $20. Honestly if you want some ramen and they're the only thing nearby you're better off going to Smith's and buying some 30 cent Top Ramen.

I don't dislike this place but its not my fav either. The decor and atmosphere, it sucks.

We did AYCE and had about 12 rolls between all of us. The waitress, she was so sweet and even after we all couldn't breathe she was still trying to stuff us with more food. Lol. The only thing that stood out to me was the TNT roll and the jalape√±o popper thingy jigs the chef surprised us with. Oh we tried the Japanese Lasagna, which is usually one of my favorites but theirs just tasted...off. No big deal though.

1551898,2013-10-12,0,-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA,"Red Ginseng is very well worth the money you pay for. The quality is very good and the service is outstanding. I highly recommend the Golden Philadelphia roll (the typical Philadelphia roll but it gets lightly fried). Among the other notable dishes I've had include the Popcorn Lobster and Spider Roll.  The salmon roll was also very yummy. Be sure to save some room for dessert, the green tea moochi is a great finishing touch to the end of the meal. The presentation is always very appealing and it really makes the food and experience. 
The appetizers are good. I had the vegetable tempura which is freshly fried and had just enough batter- not too much or too little.
The service is outstanding. It is a very organized ordering system, you get the menu and a ordering sheet. Order what you want and it comes very quickly. You can tell that it is a family run establishment by the pride they have serving you. It can get a little hectic when they do get busy, but it is definitely worth a bit of wait for the food.  I personally like sitting at the bar area of the restaurant because the chef will talk to you and make recommendations based on what you order. Remember, it is AYCE, so maybe a little time to relax between dishes will work to your favor. 
I am originally from Northern New Jersey, right across the river from Manhattan. I can honestly say that Red Ginseng beats most, if not all, the sushi places I've been too. The quality and the service you get here beats many places that you might pay double or triple for on or around the Strip and other cities.

Best sushi experience in my life and I've been to about hundred sushi places so far. The reason I like this place is for their special all you can eat sushi. I only had lunch special, they also offer dinner. This special includes everything on the menu including appetizers as much as you want, all kinds of sushi, rolls, special rolls and so on, plus one mochi ice cream. The best part is that it's not actually a buffet but everything is made to order. So the food is very fresh and really good quality. I didn't have anything that wasn't good. The first time I was there with my husband and we were ordering little by little because we didn't know how much we can eat and there you aren't supposed to leave anything. The second time I brought my mom and ordered everything at once knowing exactly how much we would eat so there was no waiting for food at all. Not many people know about this place so they have a lot of tables available. The price for the all you can eat lunch is $22.00 which is very reasonable for what you are getting, it's what two rolls will cost anywhere else anyway. Other reviews mentioned that the service is ""Asia friendly"" and that's true, however the quality of food outweighed it. The second time the service was better.

2586539,2013-09-23,1,-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA,"I really am a fan of this little sushi place! The first time I walked in you can hear the lively music. There was a few people there. It is a bit small, but it does have plenty of tables and a bar area you can sit at. I believe that this is a family owned restaurant. The husband and son are the sushi chefs and the lady is his wife. I like family owned places.

The lady there is very sweet and she tries her very best to be fast and efficient with seating you and getting your orders out to you. My boyfriend and I ordered the all you can eat, $21.95. There were plenty of sushi rolls you can pick from, you can't do half orders, so it might be good for a group of people! 

The appetizers were good! Shrimp tempura and chicken katsu, came out freshly fried. The soup did its job for me. It wasn't plain, but it wasn't filled with flavor. It was just okay.

The rolls were quite delicious. We loved the different shrimp tempura based rolls, so yummy! It didn't take long for them to make, but it wasn't fast either. It took a little bit of time. They were also elegantly done. Not just slapped together. They looked like art when they were served to us. I like that touch. We don't get the sashimi.. which is weird, why get sushi when you don't eat it raw right? Oh well. So I cannot really rate how those were. As for the rolls, they were delicious and came with around 8-9 pieces, good amount in my opinion. 

After about 4 huge rolls and appetizers, we were stuffed. There wasn't any dessert on the menu, so I asked if ice cream or mochi came with the all you can eat! The lady said yes it does.. it doesn't hurt to ask, right?! So we had the green tea ice cream. It wasn't a lot but it was just the right amount of sweet to satisfy my sweet tooth. 

There are plenty of other things on the menu besides sushi, so we will be back for something else on the menu!

The quality is in the decent-to-average range. The service is lacking but decent. The prices are a bit higher than should be for this establishment but not too far out of the range considering it's location and lack of any other decent sushi close by. There is a standard selection of sushi.

I have gone here because it's so close to my house, not necessarily because it's my top choice.  

Las Vegas seems to be the market for Screaming O sauce. I've tried to order it every single time I have come in. The first few times they made something kind of close or I mixed it myself. Then I think I must have received  a new sushi chef one night because it was perfect! I tried coming back a few times hoping to get him again and I've haven't seen him since. 

I went there tonight, made sure to order my Screaming O sauce before I even put in my order, it was ignored. Asked for it again. The new chef was stopped by the lady in charge and was told to tell me I couldn't have it without ordering a whole order. Fine, I said I would pay for a side of it. Answer was no, had to order all of it... Couldn't just get the sauce. Whatever, asked for the key ingredients and mixed it myself.

I walked in with my girlfriend around noon to have some AYCE goodness. 21.95 is a bit high, but a few dollars isn't too big of a deal. But my experience wouldn't bring me back. There were 2 or 3 other people in the restaurant, and while we were eating, a few groups came in, sat down and left without eating. I have no idea why.

We started off with miso soup. My girlfriend was fond of it, as for me it tasted a bit runny and a little on the downside of flavor, but it was the right temperature and it was just ok. The sushi was fair and like i said, the crunch roll was tasty and had to be the best roll that lunch. They do not have half orders, I prefer half orders because if there were to be a roll i did not like, there would be a small portion to finish, and also half orders get you to try all of the different kinds of sushi they have to offer. So this place is better for groups.

Service was definitely fast, the lady who served us was nice and friendly but she seemed rushed in a way that you would see as if you were late to class. I don't like seeing someone in a hurry or having that panicking look.

First off, the busser sat us at a table and threw down dinner settings that were messily scattered next to the table next to it. The server took forever to take our order and when we told her we wanted to order AYCE, she gave us a piece of paper to mark what we wanted. This took another 5 minutes for her to come back even after she acknowledged that we were ready to order.

The fish for the sushi was actually decent but the rice was hard and stale. They didn't even put the wasabi in the nigiri like they normally do. The chicken skewers looked like they grilled up chicken breast and shoved them on to the skewers; not to mention they were extremely dry and flavorless. 

By the end of dinner we noticed we were never brought several items we ordered. We were also charged $8 for a pot of tea, where normally we would be charged for a cup of tea with unlimited refills.

The bottom line is: DO NOT COME HERE!

I started with appetizers - 
softshell crab - good batter. It was served with tempura sauce which I didn't prefer over ponzu so I just ate it plain.
seaweed salad- standard and fine
stuffed jalapeno- this was good actually, nice crispness and good flavor
monkey brain - this seemed interesting since it said crispy banana with crab and masago. I was expecting a banana chip, but it was a battered slice of banana. I did not like this texture. 
fire cracker- I normally enjoy this crispy rice with spicy tuna, but what they did here was make a rice ball coat it in panko and fried it up a bit. It never got crispy and was just oily and mushy inside. The texture was so off putting I couldn't eat that rice and hid it in a napkin. They need to toast the rice crisp in a oven to achieve that delicious crisp. 

Portions were big on appetizers so its a sharing thing. Each thing had 4 pcs when I was expecting 2. 

Nigiri - 
The cuts were actually nicely done, the fish to rice ratio was good. Unfortunately, the sumeshi was very wet, mushy and was not seasoned. I would have not served that. I sat on most items so that the water would evaporate a little. 
Garlic tuna, albacore and yellowtail were all very fresh. The super white tuna was OK. Scallop with masago was good. 

I got one roll, it was a no rice roll and unfortunately was served the wrong thing the soy paper version vs the one covered in cucumber and radish. It was alright, but I know the crispy cukes would have made it better.

I got a salmon skin hand roll and it came with a gob of crab mix! I was a bit upset at this, I just picked it out and threw it in a napkin. Who puts crab on salmon skin?! 

Service was friendly and nice, but it was inconsistent. There were times she was no where to be found to ask for more drink so I sat empty a few times. You order with a paper menu and I found my pen was gone after the first round.

Next up: Garlic tuna: fish was oddly chewy, room temperature, not a lot of flavor. Made me wonder if I'd be getting food poisoning later.

Philadelphia roll: also bland. So much so that we asked for the rest of our order to go, so that we could simply stop eating without being rude or complaining.

5503186,2015-01-04,0,-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA,What makes this a 5 star all-you-can-eat sushi joint is the serving size of meat to rice is so perfectly abnormal to the carb overload of the competition. Quality is delectably fresh tasting. New sushi favorite!,u0rMrAa9kOj6c1WZ5hcpPw,0,0,5,w53ZiXVZCrtucrbNOJEdGg
5552519,2014-07-26,0,-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA,"My mom and I actually found this place accidentally while looking for another sushi restaurant. We figured it was really close to the house, so why not give it a try. We were greeted and we sat at the bar. The lady that sat us ( I think was the owner) was a bit pushy at first but very attentive. We ordered the tiger , pink roll and samurai . All were great and you can notice that he takes great pride in what he does. The sushi tasted very fresh. My mother ordered the ramen soup . It was good and all the vegetables tasted fresh. The restaurant itself was clean and well kept ( they've been at this location lil over a year) . The temperature was 110f today so when we walked in, it was cool and shaded. I will definitely be back. Next time I will try the Korean BBQ.",HnR8d6zgD8xowPlVrzR-TA,0,1,5,IyH9vrK2InyL6a1HrHN2MQ

We had the special of a miso soup, salad, and four rolls for $12.99 which we thought wasn't bad. The sushi was good couldn't finish my food. Service was good they didn't take long and were polite. I have noticed that a lot of sushi places are doing the same special so I'd rather try a new place then go back.",7APieIlWknavsNb7WqPz3w,1,1,2,awlyg3_OPsWFskmDdxBDPg

Thoroughly disappointed w the lackluster bland nigris, heavy handed sauce saturated rolls and the awkward fake friendly service! Think other reviews pointed out their flaws already so I don't even wanna elaborate. Wish they were decent but looks like I'll continue to look for a good sushi  lunch place.",U98mZaQAsHXym6FyhGCZdA,0,0,2,MibyLkZDlrpSKzgoIK6bUw
