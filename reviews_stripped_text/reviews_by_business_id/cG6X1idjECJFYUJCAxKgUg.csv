1023902,2018-02-12,0,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"I decided to try this salon because I got a really good deal on groupon for a Valentine's Day special which was supposed to consist of a mani/pedi, 10 minute massage and a eye and lip  mask for 2 people. My husband and I showed up at our appointment time at 2 and they were busy so they didn't have 2 tech's available at the same time so I went first had my pedi while my husband waited, which frustrated me because we should have received services at the same time since it was a V-day special for 2. The nail technician who did pedi asked me what kind of pedi I wanted,  I told her whatever comes with the V-day package..She had no idea what I was talking about so after confirming with the front desk and the owner, she came back and finished my pedi which was not that great, plus the fact that I should have received the 10 minute massage which only lasted about 2 minutes. Next was the manicure which was mediocre
It's been less than 24 hours and paint is already chipping. The groupon stated a lip AND eye mask but I only could pick one (although it's not what the groupon stated) I chose the eye mask, by this time I was just ready to go but had to wait on my husband to finish his services. 
I always like to give new businesses a try so I understand it can be hit or miss. The ladies were very nice and respectable and the decor is so chic, but not  sure if I'll try Nab again after my experience. It was supposed to be a day of relaxation and pampering, unfortunately, that's not how it turned out.",3_F6OU-41FWGf1FIX02r_A,4,0,1,nWJSbrjIDWuYPNa4L-HoKQ

This is not Deja Vu where you are trying to bleed your customer dry.  We are customers who came to have a relaxing time and not want to worry we're going to end up with some crazy bill.  The technicians are amazing but those women who walk around trying to sell the VIP packages need to stay in the Champagne room.

Trying to hard to look upscale. Anyway about the service-was just basic, nothing that impressed me. Was not crazy about the chairs-kind of uncomfortable. No massage :( I showed my nail tech a picture of what I wanted, well definitely did not get the picture. It was bad!! At that point I was already there for 2 hours just wanted to leave already. I think it is really rude to have snacks and beverages out as if they are for the clients. But come to find out it is only for the VIP. I thought that was weird. Makes you feel that you are unimportant. All other salons offer to all there guests. I also did not like they charge you a fee if you pay with credit card. They charge a percentage, wtf! My gel polish was coming up after a week. Will definitely not be going back, waste of money and time.

1977912,2018-04-22,1,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"I find it really amusing how once I posted this review it was flagged by the owner herself of Nab nail bar to say that it was fake I was not paid by anyone to share this review. This is my personal experience at the salon and since you would like to call my review fake I will upload the receipts and scheduled appointment text message that I received from this business! I was not going to include the rest of this information but I guess I can go ahead and do that now that I'm more pissed off than ever, the day after I got my nails done which was Saturday, April 21 I called the salon again to express my disappointment with my nail service and was told by a girl at the front desk that this business was not in the business of giving people their money back when they were not satisfied with the services. I had also never received a receipt for my purchase so I asked if she could send me over a receipt, she then expressed to me that on the receipt I had received a full set of Valentino nails when in fact I had received the full set of young nails. She disclosed to me that I was up charged for the Valentino, when I had in fact gotten young Nail products used for my services. So she said she would see if her boss would refund me for that charge, and then she offered me a replacement full set to compensate for the $88 that I spent on a terrible nail job. At first I was completely OK with that I said why not let me just go back and get a full set as if not to be at a further disposition about my disappointment, The girl then proceeded to tell me she would have someone call me back the same day. But to my dismay nobody ever reached out to me yesterday Saturday, April 21 At this point I hadn't even mentioned that I was quoted one price and charged a totally different price upon check out, I waited a whole day for them to return my phone call, when I never received my call back, I instead after I got off work today on Sunday, April 22 I had to recall the salon expressed to them once more my disappointment and by this point a whole nail had popped off of my ring finger I haven't even made it 48 hours yet since I left the salon from going there on Friday night the 20th at 8 PM to not even making it to noon Sunday, April 22nd Without losing a Nail that I almost paid $100 for pissed me off more than ever, So I took it upon myself to drive straight from work over to the salon and approach the manager at the front desk to whom I took that fingernail and set it down on the counter and said to him ""it hasn't even been 48 hours and I missing a nail, after expressing to you how I felt about my disappointment with the nail services. You didn't do anything to build rapport with me as a paying customer"" to which his response was reporter?? As if he didn't understand what I was saying. But I guess that is not terminology well understood by people that are not in the business of customer service but instead in the business of taking people's money, for poor service. Once again I was offered a replacement nail service, but at this point of not being called back to have the first one scheduled, and my whole nail popping off. It was like the straw that broke the camels back! I no longer wanted any more services from this salon instead I requested that I wanted my money back. I was told ""I can't do that"" so I said ""find me somebody who can"" he then told me that the manager wasn't available to service me and that he would call the manager once he spoke to her he would have her or himself give me a call back. So I am still currently waiting on that call back to see what exactly it is they're going to do to take care of my situation. I am at a point now where I am so upset about not receiving my money back I have half a mind to make contact with my uncle who is a well established attorney, and go as far is filing a civil suit against this salon. Just so they can understand that people work very hard for their money and are not in the business of giving it away.",8zhZ_rvS78ki1mUVuowhuw,3,1,3,ZneycEcznhUxEpJdNcEU2A
1981147,2018-03-21,1,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"After posting my review on Yelp, I privately emailed the owner and the only response I got was ""this is a fake review""!!!   Here's my email: 
Feb 7


Hello Asia,

I just read your reply to me on Yelp.  Yes, of course I was referring to the correct location as it shows location address as well as photos.  

We were there last night, called ahead, said we could come in at 9:30pm no problem  We showed up at 9:30 and other than one other patron there, we were the only ones so we obviously were seated right away, yet didn't get out until almost 11:30pm. (And the lady that was there before us was there over 2 hrs for whatever she was sitting at the nail bar having done, and she definitely did not look happy).  

The only reason (other than to give people a heads up on what to expect) I commented on Yelp is because I genuinely felt sorry for the owners if they don't know what's going on in their establishment.  I would hate to invest a lot of money and time on location and set up, only to fail when it comes to customer service satisfaction.  And I can tell you thet if last night was indicative of how this business is ran, it will not be there long because there will be no returning customers.  We here in Summerlin don't have a lot of places to choose from for late evening nail salons and I thought having this place at that location/late hours was genius.

Anyway, all around not good experience for us, so we don't plan on returning.  

Take care,
Sherry",NC_6TR-OcIojo2QTNTBF9w,5,1,1,vEdjVChMJODXpDOWPSOyIQ

2152933,2018-02-11,1,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,I purchased Spa Man/Pedi on Groupon.  The lady answered the phone treated me like a second class citizen as soon as she found out I have Groupon.  I told her that I work on weekdays and I can only go on weekends.  She rudely replied it's in the terms and conditions the appointment is only Monday thru Friday.  I went back to read the terms and it only said for ASAP services and not the one I purchased.   I called back three times and no answer.  Treat your customers right and you wouldn't have to use Groupon to attract them.  The luxurious experience starts with the phone call and your attractive pricing is only good when the appointment is accommodating!  Make sure your mission statement aligns with your business practice!  I'm not a customer and yet you've managed to get a 1 star.,WS6rf7wguYd79YYWWF_vdQ,4,0,1,3rPdp6ZoW1i1MJxu9osNAw

When we got there, they said they overbooked and asked us to wait. After waiting for an hour and about to leave, they took us back to settle in for a pedicure. My friend was seen right away but I waited another half hour for service. 

Fast forward to getting our full sets...
My nail technician decided to not use tips and instead use the acrylic powder and stickers to create my nails. This would have been fine if it did not take 3 hours to complete. She didn't file down my nails and left them thick and bulky. The shape I requested (almond) was far from what was created. By the time she was finished it was 11:30 pm and I just needed to leave. 

My nails looked so terrible I had to get them redone. At the end of the week, I went to a local nail salon in my state. My new nail technician saw my nails and felt so bad for me, she gave me a new full set, free of charge, only charging for for the removal of my original set done by Nab Nails.

3291174,2018-07-02,0,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"Went with my cousin for a late mani-pedi on Sunday when our usual nail salon is closed. Drove 30 min across town because we needed our nails down before the week started. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.

1) My nail technician didn't know what the heck she was doing. She didn't want to clip my toe nails how I wanted it done, because she said that it looked better how she did it.

2) She asked me if there was any way that I could move my feet so that the nail polish didn't run of my toe nails. So, I had to point my toes downward while she was painting my toes, which was so uncomfortable due to leg day at the gym the day prior. She didn't groom my toe nails that great either. AND the nail polish still ran, so you can see where she messed up on my toes.

3) She took FOREVER transferring her materials to the station she was going to do my mani at.. and she was SO UNPROFESSIONAL. She answered her phone on 4 separate occasions, talking to her boyfriend and her grandma WHILE doing my mani.

4) She also didn't groom my fingers properly either. She didn't have me wash my hands before applying the gel nail polish, so the shavings from filing my nails were STILL on my nails. She didn't file my nails properly either. I told her that I needed them short because I use my hands to work on patients all day, so I can't be scratching them with nails. I had to file my own damn nails when I got home because they were SO sharp. She didn't push my cuticles back or take off the dry skin. The gel nail polish was so clumpy that she had to put three coats because she didn't know how to spread the polish evenly.

5) She left a good amount of gel nail polish on my knuckle (I have no idea how it got there). I asked her if she could take it off before I left, so she tried to take off dried gel nail polish on my skin with a nail filer. IT HURT SO BAD. It was like she was filing my skin. What person thinks that's okay? I immediately told her to stop because it hurt. AND she responded OH, that hurts?..

WORST NAIL EXPERIENCE EVER. They are ridiculously priced. You pay for the convenience of having them open late, NOT for the amazing service. Needless to say, I am not returning here.",qA3iekuHcDZ87Auf2FkTmg,0,0,1,yrGwFjQ5wEWjwxBgG-dV-A
3449697,2018-04-29,0,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"NAB Nail Bar is like a glitzy mermaid's secret lagoon boasting opulent fixtures and aquamarine dreams. The colors are vibrant, summoning the nostalgia of Lisa Frank sand art. The tall tufted white chairs call out to you saying, ""it's pampering time, beezies!"" as the pretend ocean waves on the wall gently draw you in.

Bottom line -- the interior is beautiful. However, the service I received could have been a little better. Just practice good judgment when reading the one star reviews, I didn't let them deter me from trying out this place.

My nail technician was Rosie. She was friendly and had just the right amount of conversation. She did my pedicure okay, but my manicure was kind of disappointing. She had to redo my pinky twice, but I still ended up with bubbles. While she was clipping my nails, she would sometimes accidentally catch some of my skin. 

It took forever to check out since they were training a new girl at the front desk and there were some impatient customers starting to gather. 

While waiting, I accidentally scraped my thumb, but the person who fixed it just painted over it, leaving noticeable ridges. At this point in time, I was just ready to go home so I let it be. Later that night, thumb becomes a casualty and chips.

I still tipped since my groupon allowed me a discount and the atmosphere was great, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to drive across town for regular price.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,4,2,3,8-_rtZpn-0ZISAPAqZDTPQ

3727325,2018-05-22,0,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"I had initially seen this place advertised on Groupon and decided to try it out with a $32 Groupon good for 1 pedicure and 1 manicure. I showed up at noon to see if anyone could get me in and the girl at the front has me make an appointment to come back at 1pm. I went and grabbed some lunch, came back, and my nail tech wasn't at the salon yet. It was about 12:50pm. The salon itself is very beautiful, the decor is stunning, the pedicure booths are beautiful, and the overall aesthetic is very pretty. I was very hopeful that this salon would be great until I started to go through their nail polish colors and was definitely unimpressed. I typically like to do regular polish on my toes and they only had a small turn table of a few colors and then a shelf with a few more. I'm used to the giant wall of colors at regular nail salons so I was disappointed with the selection. They all looked old and separated so I went through almost all of the colors just to find one that looked half decent. They do have a very wide selection of gel so that made things a little bit better! I decided to upgrade my manicure to gel and picked out a color of gel for my finger nails. The girl at the front desk started my pedicure by filling up the bowl and having me sit and soak until my nail tech (Connie Lee) arrived. She was about 25 minutes late, so I passed the time on my phone. As soon as she arrived (1:30pm) she was apologetic and very nice so that made it a little better. The pedicure was absolutely lack luster. It felt very rushed and there was really nothing involved other than painting my toes. No hot towel, no scrub, no massage, nothing. I feel like everything was so rushed because my nail tech was late and she then needed to make up for lost time so in turn, I lost out on a good quality experience. My manicure was the same. I soaked my hands in cold water, she was very quick to trim my cuticles and paint my nails and send me on my way. Overall, the quality of the service was not good. When it came time to check out, I assumed I would owe about $10 for the gel upgrade. Mind you, the Groupon I bought was $32 for both a pedicure and manicure. My total came to $24 extra..... very confused how upgrading to gel polish could cost $24. It seems like the Groupon I bought was basically useless. So I ended up spending $56 plus a $10 tip so nearly $70 on very rushed, lack luster nail experience. For $70, you could go to any other salon and have the full experience of the hot towels, scrub, hot nail soak, massage, lotion, etc. so I would recommend to skip this place and go somewhere else! I was very confused how this place could have such bad reviews but be so beautiful, but the service quality is just not good, even if the salon is very pretty.",XcYOTqbY3Yr678gwWaHTJw,1,0,1,9AhQrnkH5LlF7Xw8TbhZOA
3823179,2018-06-14,1,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"Took my wife here to get her nails done and while we were at it I decided to try the ""mans mani-pedi"". The welcoming was alright and the receptionist was not really informative of the services they had to offer. Although, we did search a Groupon deal which they awarded in person without having to purchase it on the app. 

The place was very glamorous and has a shabby chic feel to it. The high back chairs and molding definitely makes you feel like royalty. It was spacious and they had a lot of techs, so the wait time was not long at all. They even offer a faster service by using two techs per person. One works with the feet while the other works on the hands. The techs that worked on us were good especially Nina (she worked on my wife and knew what she was doing). I don't know the name of my tech because she wasn't wearing a badge and didn't really create conversation or let alone introduced herself. It was a quiet service, but we Enjoyed the extra massage on the hands and feet. 

I also like the extra accommodations they provide, like the refreshments (coffee, tea or water) your pick.  They bring it right to you as you're getting work done. 

The place is big and full of products and amenities. A lot of salon chairs and nail bar tables including other special treatment rooms such as facials, vascular circulation therapies, cosmetic tattoos, micro blading and eye lash extensions. 

When I was awarded Groupon prices for my services, we were told that it would only be an extra $10 for upgrades on the type of nail gel my wife wanted. I stayed quiet about it because I was dumbfounded and questioned myself about it, but when I buy $32 x 2 persons worth of deals and upgrade with $10 for gels, I was charged $99 instead. The kicker was that I was told to use an ATM machine so that if I pay in cash, I wasn't going to pay taxes and did not get a receipt for it. Questionable, but I didn't say anything or speak up about it before I left. So I guess it's my mistake if there was a misunderstanding between it all. 

I also wanted to mention we overheard several employees complaining about their salaries for the amount of work they do in front of us. It was pretty awkward.

Everything... and when i say everything is beautiful in here, I'm not lying. I love how they really put a lot of effort into designing this place. From the floors to the celling to even the details of putting their logo on the towels. 

I came in for a mani & pedicure, found this place on Groupon. 

First i got my pedicure and i was impressed. The chairs are really girly but hey pedicure are normally for girls (I'm just a guy that takes care of my feet lol) i did like how all the tools needed for my pedicure was in a sealed bag. It felt safe! 

Next was my mani cure and it was done right at my seat. I didn't have to move to somewhere else, it was right we're i was sitting at.

I really think the pedicure chair was very nice but it didn't have any massage for it so you just sat there while you get a pedicure. My pedicure was normal and nothing special. The lady painting my nails was a bit older so she took her time painting because I think her eyesight wasn't as great as it could be. After my pedicure we moved to another table area to do my nails and they were a bit high to sit at. My nails looked fine but it took a while. I'm glad the lady took her time but I would say my experience was average. This nail salon is very beautiful but I definitely think it has room for improvements and can grow.

4648948,2018-04-24,4,cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg,"So after writing my more than fair review of NAB bar - after the *very real experience* I had there a little over a month ago, for my birthday, I have been harrassed by the owner Asia. Calling my review fake and leaving a horrible comment on my review. You can actually see I did check in there when I was there and posted pictures of my time -- and even complimented the layout of the salon in the review. And yes, there were some definitely real hiccups -- the place was new, and sometimes need to be given a second chance. I even posted a picture of the nail technician who made my toe bleed and scratched up my feet. But in my review didn't call out anyone specifically for doing a bad job, but now because of Asia's harrasment I feel it's important to point out.

Sadly, NAB & it's owner blew any chance of getting a return visit, considering the owner never met me and has put me in the middle of some stupid, immature feud she and some other salon have going on (a salon I've never even been to, at that.) 

The only reason I had even gone to NAB was because my good friend paid for me to try a new place for my birthday. If you look through my check-ins I go to an amazing Salon by me that after 4 years very loyal too, Bellissima. Always friendly, and they'd do anything for their customers. 


Instead of Asia trying to apologize to a new customer, plus an elite member of Yelp, and trying to fix a bad experience, she attacked my review and my credibility which was very false on her part. And ruined any chance of me giving her place a second chance. Very sad. She could've offered a nice apology at the very least. It's even worse when you consider that all it would've taken was some effort on the part of ownership. The pictures, along with my verified check-in proved that I was there, period. Instead, she's seriously alienated many potential customers (or repeats like myself) from EVER wanting to step foot inside -- regardless of how beautiful everything may look. All that glimmers is NOT gold.


My husband and I even tried to reach out Asia, which is what she should have done being an owner. Despite being a month old as of this update, that message has gone unreturned.",E7wn_-kRX5FjTeK1yzQw0A,29,9,1,-oehfBHtY-_0CfdKJ5mXyg

The owner has failed to return my calls and messages. I figured I might save someone from a future injury if they read this review. The salon is very beautiful, the lady that did my pedi did a good job. But the lady that did my sisters manicure cut 2 of her fingers!

But the actual nail service sucked, I even gave them a second chance to re-do my nails. I made an appointment, I came early they paired me with someone who has only been doing nails for 2 years. I brought my own nail polish and she had nerve to blame the nail polish that I just bought the day of service, for the reason why my nails were bumpy, even though it was her actual clear coat she put on me. I took the nail polish off the second I got home and still gave her a tip. After taking my nail polish off my actual acrylic overlay was all uneven & had 3 chips in 3 separate nails like she didnt even bother completing the overlay! I went in 2 days later, they gave me another nail tech and she filled in the cracks however the nail color she put on me with glitter smudged the second I left, all they did both times were spray my nails, to dry them. I took that nail polish off the second I got home as well. I'm writing this review now, because I have 3 chips again, I havent even been anywhere or washed dishes yet! I'm on medical leave for a car accident I was in. I informed them I wanted an overlay when I made the appt and it seems like maybe no one knows how to do that here, but maybe just gel and dips.

Unfortunately this place was not that for me. It looks amazing when you walk in. Anddddddd...... that's all the good things I have to say. 

When you arrive , you're greeted by a very loud and obnoxious ""manager"".  He was just very unprofessional. ""Hey girl"" 
-sir you don't know me. 

Or girls who don't really have customer service skills and are very not welcoming. 

Then, you are texted right away to let you know that a gel polish is $58 dollars and the next nail tech will assist you. 

The nail tech was in a rush, and did not want to do both my hands and feet. Not only that, the nail tech next to her was trying too hard to convince me to get something I do not want. (Dip nail polish) 

Then, the manager is having personal conversations with staff as if there are no customers. I get it, it's a nail salon. But, can we pretend like your guest came to relax and have a peaceful mini-pedi ?? Not really interested in the drama at your salon or the party you plan to throw for your birthday. 

On to the next..... 

The chairs are soooo uncomfortable. I asked my nail tech does it at least move because I am short and was very uncomfortable.  My nail tech replied ""my boss said these chairs are like Red bottoms only for looks and very expensive"" 


Not really sure how that even answered my question but to sum it all up... 

This place is impersonal, uncomfortable and overpriced. 

Advice? 

Get a new manager. Or train the one you have. Get better chairs so we can sit comfortably. Maybe then we wouldn't mind paying 60 dollars to get our regular nails painted.

This last Friday when I went during my pedicure I felt a stabbing shooting pain as the girl was cleaning the side of my nail on my big toe. I didn't see any blood and it wasn't really bothering me when I left. Saturday my toe was sore but nothing to bad, by Sunday my toe was red and swollen and I could hardly walk the pain was so bad.

All I was wanting was a refund nothing else but they have extremely horrible customer service and I will not be going back.",I8O2AGCFKT7i8_tg0ryRGQ,0,0,1,2weB5l6clr-0t1pUXuieSw

I went back the next day to get my polish fixed. An hour left a nail broke. I went back in later for a fix. Then next day 4 more of my nails had broken off & the one that had been fixed popped completely off. I had 1 full day of a good manicure. All of my nails have broken at this point it has not even been 1 full week. I am extremely disappointed. It is one of the more expensive shops, full of cheep products.",QkXP46jR0dZKVnsQcAyNiQ,1,0,1,r41Faz1K9QHljsPRrh-MFg
