I was going to get a soda but I could have gotten a six pack for the same price.  Will eat some where else next time.",ge2x8oYJ32Bf4hsSlqm00A,0,0,2,M5YL5tMm-OqflaCeQ3DoQg

First of all Chicago dogs are served on poppy seed buns  not sesame seed buns!!!!
My companion ordered a PLAIN Chicago dog and they wanted to charge a dollar more for a pickle spear, no relish, no tomato, nothing else but a pickle on it. Its not a Chicago dog if its plain!!!. Its just a hot dog masquerading on that pathetic sesame seed bun.
 The $8.99 Italian beef is incredibly small, and I'm not sure what kind of beef is actually used, but not positive its a Vienna product.  Tables dirty, 1 worker there, incredibly understaffed for prime hours at the airport. Not to mention  I stood there for 3 minutes while my beef got cold under the ledge out of my sight ready. The one employee had 8 people in line . Dear Al, step it up,  your squandering a fantastic opportunity to serve quality Chicago food, and seriously, a $1.05 for a pickle spear when I just spent 20 bucks?  I shall be taking my Chicago food cravings to the Chicago Dog house or to Sonio's cafe  instead from now on.  I'm not complaining about prices because I know its the airport, but you used to do better.",sTvGjPr6y38R2sI-WT6NGg,0,0,2,dVEH32mjV30As_Apf1df1A

This place leech off of poor tourists. Cheaper and better to eat at Starbucks.   I'm not kidding,jT3rBPj_brtzmv0jXfGOsw,0,0,1,i2gvbBURMKLDIhkQRn_TQQ

The toppings fell all over the floor when I took my first bite but the hot dog was great.",6cn1rYcmdHGncDQGUO_bYg,1,0,3,N54BfJpKa_GTElyXcHqfQQ

Being from Detroit, I like a good Coney Dog and often go out of my way for a good Chicago style dog.  Order the Polish Sausage and one Chicago style dog along with a bottled soda.  Polish Dog was not really good, had a n over-processed taste to it typical of generic offerings, that would be a 2.  Chicago dog was really good, missing the celery salt but everything else was pretty much on target.  The young man staffing the station was extremely polite, provided excellent service, and took his time to in helping some of the foreign traveler's who were having difficulty expressing what they wanted.  Was actually really impressed with him for a dingy little location like this.  Other reviews are spot on in the cleanliness or lack thereof  of the small seating area; take your chances.  But then if youa re eating open food stuff at an internaltional airport like McCarrena and allowing your food to contact ANY surface, I think you are pretty much taking your chances anyway.  Polish Dog=2, Seating/Cleanliness =2, Chicago Dog =3, Service =4.",2omu7CFA8MyfHDgBE56C-g,2,3,3,A86tzysnf1F1EdDnqPOoKg
