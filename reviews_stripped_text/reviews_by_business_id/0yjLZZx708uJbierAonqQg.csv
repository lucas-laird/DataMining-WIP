143783,2016-04-29,0,0yjLZZx708uJbierAonqQg,Church's Chicken is one of the unfamiliar franchise name I wouldn't have known or heard of in SF. But Las Vegas has abundance of fast food franchises I m just gettin to be familiar with or enjoy. Church's Chicken is quite similar to what Popeye's has to offer in menu n flavor wise! But I think Church's Chicken is a little less greasier n healthier!,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,0,4,JJkroSrPlwIWv-upK8r2Aw

My wife and I do fried chicken maybe once a month and she asked me to try churchs. 

This happened on 02/25/10

This location is small. You can see everything happening in the kitchen. I arrived about 8:30 and went to order.
The kid working the register was sweating quite a lot. He also had bad larynghitis (could hardly talk) which happens when you are sick and your throat swells and presses on your vocal chords, it happens to me every winter.

So I order. He has problems hearing me and I am not a quiet person. He can't hear me. Guess his head cold has his ears congested. 

After that I watch him go back into the kitchen (you can see everything) and right next to the chicken... AHH-CHOO! and he sneezes into his HAND and then wipes his NOSE in his shirt...!

I called the manager over and demanded my money back right away.
She asked in Spanish to herself ""oh, porque?"" (""oh, why?"") and I answered ""porque? Because your employee is sick and just sneezed and wiped his nose on his shirt! It's disgusting is why!""

she answered with ""well he's no touching the food..."" 

I swear to God this really happened.
Absolutely horrifying.
I am calling the head office of this company this week and maybe even the Clark county health department.",vP3YR6GeKAV6-54a-hEFUg,0,0,1,AjkRXdrZiB61oQIrAJLlvA

2084396,2015-01-04,2,0yjLZZx708uJbierAonqQg,"I love me some Church's chicken! I prefer Church's over KFC and Popeye's. The biscuits here are amazing. They have a sweet glaze brushed over the tops of them. Best biscuits ever. Now for the star of the show, the chicken. You can choose spicy or regular flavored chicken. I always get spicy, because it's not very spicy. They always have a special going on and right now it's 2 pieces of chicken and 2 small sides for $2.99. 

I was really hungry, so I ordered a combo with 3 pieces of chicken, a side (coleslaw), and a drink and it was just under $7. I waited about 5 minutes and my food came out. Everything was good. The chicken was crispy and hot. The slaw is mayo based and has a nice tang. I also like the jalapeño poppers and Mac and cheese. They have other offerings like chicken sandwiches and I think fried shrimp, but I haven't tried those items. 

The downside is that this particular location is very small, and gets cramped quickly. When you walk through the front door, the counter is right there just a few feet away. Most of the time they are busy so it gets very cramped when more than 5 people are waiting in line to order or waiting to pick up their food. This location also has a drive thru, but it is also small and cramped so beware. It is very hard to get in and out of this parking lot.

I swear, I did not hear his voice at all until he announced the total price. 

Although we got the order pretty quickly, NOT ONLY did they not ask us if we wanted the chicken original or spicy, they also didn't ask if we wanted condiments, napkins, or even a fork for the coleslaw! They might as well should've left out the top and straw for my drink too! It took us at least 15 minutes to get it.

When in Chinatown, grab Asian food right? Ummmm....how's about some Church's?....as in Church's Fried Chicken?!?!? Yup, why not???

Having only recently discovered Church's, We stopped by this location to see if it was just as good as our last visit at another location. Got a 2 piece original meal with 2 sides and a drink for $5.99...Not bad for a chicken chain! You would have definitely spent double the amount at a soul food joint.

We had two different people help us, and they were both very courteous and helpful regardless of how slammed they were at the moment inside the restaurant AND drive thru! Church's always has a wait for fried chicken, and it was a 15 minute wait this time. I've never seen it this busy at Popeye's, Jolibee, or even at  Colonel Sanders' place! Always crispy, hot, and juicy, their chicken doesn't disappoint and neither do the biscuits...can't get softer, fluffy biscuits anywhere else...sides are okay but its all about the chicken, biscuits, and sweet tea here! 

Next time you're in Chinatown and not feelin' Chinesey, Japanesey, Vietnamesey, or any other type of Asian persuasion, Go get yourself some fried chicken goodness from Church's!

the triple C threat.

Church's chicken is the closest I'll get to being religious and this will be the only church i will voluntarily go to even tho all i do here is sin and pig out. I honestly think you could blind fold a food critic, feed them Church's chicken, and they might think it was cooked by Jose Andres. They might also think I'm being a little dramatic. 

Keep an eye out for their posters to see what special deals they have going on! Last time I was here I got two sides, a biscuit, and two pieces of chicken for $4.44 I believe? DANK.

Oh, and their biscuits will probably make you drool enough to cure the California drought.

The line may be long and move kinda slowly but that's because right when you order, they will give you your food before helping the next customer in line. 

Even if you don't come here, I'd advise rolling down your window as you drive passed it and inhale the deep fried fumes.

The service varies from good to just okay (due to the wait time being markedly long sometimes).  There are some menu items that are always sure to please such as:  honey biscuits, okra, corn nuggets and the original fried chicken.  There have been several new side items added to the menu over the past few years that does help keep this franchise afloat.  Remodel and hire more people so it isn't run with a minimal crew (which adds to longer wait times) and I would frequent the place more often.",Cfwvos6oFlDquGiI2Qy1gQ,0,0,3,akmgFFTBFn7gumQpU1iP4Q
4947713,2017-05-18,0,0yjLZZx708uJbierAonqQg,Surprised how good it was. It's amazing how they can take a piece of chicken the size of a pencil...coat it ..deep fry it and make it look very big. Nice magic trick. The okra was a little too salty...but good. The service was attentive and fast. It is extremely rare that I ever eat fast food...maybe once a year...but gf informed me about the fried okra..which I find better than any french fries. The rest room could have used more maintenance.,9kcmuaqb8Xy1Ovf9BFtpVg,0,0,4,X6m3MeHckefXe6YXho6q1g

If you like fried chicken give this location a try. It is way above the others.
The only downside is that some of the staff don't understand my English accent at all.",ri4oxtV3zZNTSONRUbJ3NA,3,1,4,12aoSLkwnPqV4HL52dFVdg
5219563,2017-01-29,0,0yjLZZx708uJbierAonqQg,"Fried chicken is decent. A bit dry but good flavor. Mashed potatoes are really good. Coleslaw sucks. Biscuits are the bomb!!! They put a light glaze over them which adds a perfect sweetness to the soft warm center. 

We arrived around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and the dining room was already closed so we went through the drive through. There were three cars ahead of us and we waited for about 20 minutes. Twenty minutes in the drive through is a long time. Finally got our food, which was still nice and hot so we were okay. 

The ""more for $4.44"" deal is a good price. Two pieces of chicken with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a biscuit for less than $5 with tax. No drink though.",XQOWYd0VM9gDEepzzcRNEg,0,0,3,vcVgylAjGDHxVbfpQSQAnw
5283911,2017-05-01,1,0yjLZZx708uJbierAonqQg,"We came here before we headed over to Golf mart. I've been craving some Spicy fried chicken for a while and even though it was a Monday I still wanted some. Couldn't wait for The Tuesday special. Hardly any line because we were
So early. We ordered a spicy 3 piece combo which comes with a side and soda and biscuit. My hubby and I always share. They gave us a Wing, drumstick and a breast. We also got red beans and
Rice. The drumstick I are was good but it was so small. Must have been a small chicken. The red beans and rice is always good. They have that recipe down pat. The breast was too dry for me. You would think being so early In the Morning - about 11am - everything would be crispy And succulent. Don't get me wrong - I'll still eat at Popeyes but maybe try a different location.",Ix8If5BiasW4egULRkeOig,0,0,3,2ok0w_ElKQFNkj0LU062pg

5409601,2015-10-17,0,0yjLZZx708uJbierAonqQg,Location for me was good as I got china town frequently. I picked up at 10 piece mixed meal with half spicy and half original. I love the spicy chicken here. The chicken is usually about the same as other churches but this one seemed to have just a bit more heat in the spicy chicken. The inside as clean and the service was friendly. I'll more then likely be back,VKr0ll3NOeXyshHMc3tihg,0,0,4,roVi40Zby_YLryImzDmcNw

There were four tables and three of them were filthy, thats never a good sign.

The cashier walked to the back after explaining to me, he had to talk to his manager. She came up front with a pleasant demeanor and explained as long as I didn't mind waiting 30 minutes, that they would be able to complete my order.

My order was cooked fresh and they pushed it out fast. All the while, they servicied other customers and had their orders ready in a timely manner.

They were polite and courteous and very helpful. They did suggest that if I have a big order for the future that I can call it in ahead of time. But none the less, they serviced my needs and provided great excellent service.

The chicken was hot and fresh and everyone at my job was a happy camper. And as I happily munched away on fried okra while waiting for my chicken, I was a happy camper myself.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,5,4,rc4ZWWqOmDruzZtJABtU-A
