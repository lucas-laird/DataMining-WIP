They make their orders from scratch so be prepared for a 5-10 minute wait. But dang it's worth it! Instead of wrapping the thing in just aluminum foil, they first wrap it in paper, which absorbs the steam, keeping the tortilla from getting soggy. The tortilla is key. I think they make it themselves. I could have eaten two it was so good. 

So I went back this morning and got the bacon breakfast burrito. It was not quite as good as last nights, but tasty just the same. And big!

Food should always taste this good. For real.",Ja1C86c0Q-Dv7Eb8lTCn3w,0,0,5,-yapiwWr7pVj0JyQUgvQVQ

Then finally got my order and got home. Slowly eating the food and I noticed there was hardly any steak.. Half shrimp/half steak fries ""crispy"" felt like the cook scraped the leftover carne asada from the grill from a different order and tossed it in my order calling it steak shrimp fries.... wow..

To be honest, I don't remember exactly what I had, but it was probably a taco/tostada or similar. The food was good, plenty of it but it did seem heavily spicy (duh, it's Mexican food) and WAY too many onions as a filler in the meat combo.

I ended up removing lots of onions and there was still lots of food. I was meeting friends at a movie out on Boulder Hiway and all the way through the movie, I tasted the food that I had here and meant to ask my friends if my breath was bad, but didn't get around to it.

It was good but I won't make a special effort to go back, only because there are so many Mexican places similar to it.",0Qg75JqVqdKlLMggvuHrmw,1,0,3,-OGU67Xaq8tHrAFnJC7p5A

1050354,2014-09-14,2,wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA,"The taco quest continues. 

This is the second Rivas location  located at DI and Pecos/McCleod (the other is at Sahara and Sloan). This spot is the former home of Cafe Verdi and Paul's BBQ. Hopefully Rivas will break the trend and be here for a long, long time. 

The place is very clean. Univision/Telemundo is on full blast for your viewing pleasure and they have a nice flat screen TV menu boards. I visited specifically for the tacos. I love 'em, I need 'em and they have them. Never been Rivas but had read mostly positive reviews so this would be a good of a place as any to get my fix. 

Anyway, taco prices are $2.85 per, which seems a little steep. I asked the very pleasant counter lady if they were 'street size' and she said yes. Though I didn't say anything, I was a bit concerned since that would be a small portion for a big price. She also  went on to mention that they have a special on chicken tacos - buy two, get four or by four, get eight. Cool! I opted for eight. I also ordered a chips and salsa, She asked if I'd like cheese with that and I gladly accepted. Paid, put some money in the tip jar and headed over to the salsa bar which is about three feet away from the register.

The salsa bar is extremely simple. Red, green and some carrot, pepper and onion mix. Took a little of each. Food prep was quick and I was out the door in about five minutes. 

Got home and opened the bags. First container was the chips and pico de gallo with cheese. 

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G

So much flavor and just the right amount of cheese so it wasn't overwhelming. Great portion and more than enough for 2 - 3 people, maybe even 4. If you ever visit this place, the chips are a must have.  

Tried some chips with the green salsa. Great flavor and might the best I've ever had (I'm not exaggerating). Tried the red and was not as impressed. It might have been one of the worst I've ever had (again, not exaggerating). Everybody has different tastes with salsa though so I don't put much weight behind this. Still, I could drink the green straight out of cup all day long if I had to.          

Next was the taco box (1 of 2 boxes). Whoa boy! The container was stuffed full of tacos. Seriously, these are jumbo street tacos. In fact, they aren't small tacos by any stretch. These would qualify as 'full size' restaurant portions. The tacos were stuffed not just with chicken, but guacamole, cheese and pico de gallo. Price was no longer an issue as these things are huge! Rest assured, you will get your moneys worth. You're probably wondering how they tasted? They were magnificent, thank you very much. The chicken was fresh and hot, the guac had a nice kick and there was a perfect amount of tasty pico de gallo to top everything off. Cheese is something I don't see that often on the tacos I normally eat, so it was a nice change of pace. The flour tortillas held up perfectly. 

Great place with amazing food and value. Next trip will be for the al pastor. 

Again, the taco deal is worth its weight and gold and I would strongly suggest the chips, salsa and cheese along with copious amounts of green salsa. 

Hit the tip jar and enjoy!",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,3,1,5,qpE7O-4ib4oB5CCpsBX24Q

1588310,2017-06-05,8,wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA,"I'm familiar with Rivas from their other locations across the Valley, but recently have been frequenting this one out of convenience. Menu is extensive, prices are low, portions are large, and service is fast and polite. I always seem to get the same cashier, he's a sweetheart. 

GOOD: Get the fajitas. I prefer the steak, chicken and shrimp are also available. The burritos are also pretty solid, but be sure to check what ingredients they include and add on what you want (ie cheese, sour cream). Their asada and carnitas meats are probably my favorites, but the shrimp is nicely seasoned too. Quesadillas are awesome. 

OKAY: The sopes and salads are not my favorites, more of a one and done choice for me. I'm also not really into their tortas, which all come with thousand island dressing. I gravitate more toward their traditional dishes rather than their Americanized ones. Their guac is a $2.25 add-on fee and is more of a sauce rather than chunky like I prefer.

TIPS: Website says you can order through Eat24, but that isn't set up through their Yelp page (womp womp). Chicken tacos are BOGO. Free WiFi available (pw ""rivas123"").

EDIT: Dropping a star. The past three times I've ordered online here, I arrive and no one knows anything about my order. They eventually make it fast but then get sloppy, giving me puddles of grease and minimal cheese. Not super thrilled.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,16,3,VlsHGSvwTpW9zEERZTUBSg

Although the place was a bit crowded, the food today was dissapointing. The chiles rellenos were cheesy but burnt and dry since they came with no sauce. The beans were greasy and the rice tasted a day old. I have no complaints about the horchata; it tasted homemade. The worse part? paying 75 cents per debit card transaction.

3968473,2017-05-24,5,wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA,"Rivas has been bookmarked for two years.  After a program at the nearby Winchester Cultural Center, I stopped here for dinner.  I ordered the #7 combo--sopes with rice and refried beans with choice of meat for the sopes.  I ordered carnitas.

You place your order at the register and the person gives you a cup for your drink.  Then have a seat and they'll call out your order when it's ready.  While waiting, make a trip to the small salsa bar.  I only got their lovely, spicy green sauce.

In a short time, a man called out sopes and my tray was set on the counter by the register.  After retrieving it, my dinner consisted of two sopes.  The meal was in a styrofoam plate with compartments for the sopes, rice, and refried beans.

The carnitas very flavored quite nicely and the sopes had just the right amount of refried beans and sour cream to make a great alternative to tacos or a burrito.  The rice and refried beans were standard.  The green salsa had a good kick to it.

While I was there, 90% of their business was take out.  I really liked the no frills place and I'm in the area again, this will be a stop for a quick meal with great taste!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,8,4,uu_4GHwZ4sD2AgBSlqbs7A
4106876,2015-05-11,4,wjf1uZNr6E4LQ0nUNHX5AA,"I usually head straight to Thai Food To Go when I'm in the neighborhood for a haircut, but I decided to give this place a shot today.

This is Rivas Mexican Grill's second location, and it's on the opposite side of a nondescript plaza where Ninja Teriyaki & Sushi 2 Go has made a home. It wasn't crowded at all today during ""peak"" lunch hours, and parking spots were plentiful.

They run a constant 2-for-1 special on the chicken tacos ($2.85). The tacos are actually made with 6-inch tortillas, not the ubiquitous 4-inch variety, and pizza math suggests that you're getting something twice as big. I would say that the meat portion is not actually twice as much as you'd get at other places, but it's still nice. Instead of onions and cilantro, however, they top their tacos with pico de gallo, guacamole, and small pieces of jalapeño. I did enjoy the flavors overall, and I especially liked that they browned and seasoned the chicken cubes, but it's definitely different from the more traditional street tacos that you might find at a place like Taco y Taco.

In retrospect, the sope ($2.85) was not a great choice. I should have realized this when I browsed their web site's menu (which actually has photos of everything). The sope is sorta like a thick tostada in that it has a crunchy base, only this one is an especially thick ""disk"" prepared from masa (corn dough). The steak was pretty tasty too. Unfortunately, it really reminds me of a fully Americanized taco because of the shredded cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, and sour cream. Using the lime and salsas (avocado-based or red) might help to salvage this, but I'll just stay away next time.

My favorite part of the meal was the carnitas torta ($4.75). The pork is cooked until crispy and the bread has a bit of a crunch that surrounds a soft interior. The avocado gives it a nice creaminess, the sauce is tasty, and I was definitely on my lime and salsa game at this point. Finally, the lettuce and tomato are fresh and really balanced out the richness of the other components.

I definitely plan to return to Rivas when it's convenient. They're open 24/7, and they have plenty of other menu items to try: nachos (with any meat), burritos (regular, breakfast, or wet), quesadillas, and combo plates are also available here, as are chiles rellenos, chicken wings and fingers, and a few traditional drinks.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,5,4,9hRoDZWFg4vHPRuKJQJrag

That said, we walked in to a very clean restaurant. We ordered tacos al pastor and pollo as well. They had a small selection of fresh sauces for self serve, The limes and sauces were ice cold, and looked great.

It took about 5 minutes or more for our food to arrive. They do not skimp on the fillings. The meat and pico de gallo was overflowing from our tacos. The tortillas were fresh, hardy and held together perfectly. The meat was steaming! Talk about right off of the grill. And the pico was nice and cold. 

There was a faint smell of cigarette smoke when we walked in, but it like I said it was really faint. It did not deter us. I have to admit that when we walked in, there was no one at the register, and no one in the lobby. We debated on whether or not to leave. I am so glad that we stayed.

Today was completely different. I had to repeat my order several times when I called, as the woman taking it was not paying attention. When I arrived, I paid with a $20 (total was $9.72) & tried to give her the change but as she was (again) not paying attention, she gave me 28 cents, closed her drawer, then went back to talking to the employee & customer next to her. (Apparently the burrito he ordered was made incorrectly). Meanwhile I had to tell the woman I'd given her a $20 & wanted the rest of my money. She looked blank then surprised, finally opened her drawer, looked at the money confusedly, & gave me a $10. I added their green sauce to my Carne Asada Fries & headed home. Today's order is BEYOND terrible. There is absolutely ZERO seasoning on the meat & frankly, it tastes like dry pot roast. The green sauce is usually delicious with just the right amount of heat. This tastes like water. I am BEYOND disappointed. I was really looking forward to this for dinner but right now I wish I hadn't wasted my money. 

***UPDATE***
I gave it another shot. I wanted things to be the way they used to be but sadly they're not. Today I called to place an order & was immediately put on hold where I sat several minutes listening to whom ever answered the phone laugh raucously, along with others in the background. Eventually I ordered my food & was on my way. When I picked up the bag I immediately thought, ""this feels really light"". I opened the container to see the previous, generous portion of Carne Asada Fries had majorly shrunk. I used to get 2 meals from an order; this one is no where near the size they used to be. The taste was much better today; the meat wasn't nearly as dry as my last order & the green sauce had some kick, but I'm no longer impressed. I don't know what happened but the food quality & order size have dropped TREMENDOUSLY. Smh. Time for us to part ways Riva's.",3FX0OVKzIMNXUOjF6NCkoA,0,0,1,D4ktSnN0nPap95w_AMSnkg
