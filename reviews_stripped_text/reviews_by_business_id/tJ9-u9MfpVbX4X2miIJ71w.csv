It came with filet mignon, scallops, lobster, and vegetables. It was amazing! It's a bit expensive, but you get an a lot of excellent mix of high-quality beef and seafood. 

Chef Luong is very friendly and entertaining. He creates an awesome dining experience coupled with the delicious food he makes. The restaurant atmosphere is inviting and it shows that they thought about every piece of the design and its place.

I highly recommend checking it out. You won't be disappointed!

Hokkaido Teppanyaki Steakhouse is a pretty long drive for us to go to dinner... but I do not care! I love this place. I love the customer service and the food is fantastic too! The waiters and staff are always checking to see if you need anything or to refill your drink. If you haven't been before it's a must try! Hokkaido Teppanyaki Steakhouse is a Japanese restaurant where they cook  your food in front of you. For dinner they start you off with a salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. I had the filet mignon and shrimp combo. They also give you steamed rice ( unless you request fried rice) and grilled vegetables. I also have the new 2013 Entertainment book, which had a coupon for up to $25 off our bill. So it was an awesome dinner for a reasonable price! However, I would go here regardless of if I had a coupon or not!

The Teppanyaki area was very busy, and it looked delicious.  Since we wanted sushi, we sat at a table. There was only one person at the sushi bar.  The table had overhead lights, but really needed candles on table to see the menu.  We had to use the light from our phones. We ordered a mixed tempura appetizer. In the dim light we started to eat it and my husband said ""this is greasy"". When we were almost finished we saw a puddle of oil on the bottom of the plate! We told the waiter and he offered us another. We declined. We ordered three orders of nigiri sushi, a caterpillar roll and an order of salmon sashimi. The pieces of fish were really small. Even the rice was small. The roll was small too. But the worst was the sashimi. It came on a bed of ice in a margarita glass. There were supposed to be 4 slices, but there were small bits.  Our bill came to over $50.  If you are looking for decent sushi, don't go here.  I won't criticize the teppanyaki, as it looked good and the chef was doing a good job.

Our server was enjoyable during the preparation. He made jokes, juggled knives, and tossed shrimp into patron's mouths that willingly took on the challenge.

All of the food was tasty. I ordered the filet and lobster, which came with fried rice, two shrimp, and miso soup. Everything was prepared as expected. The meal was enjoyable.

Two downsides: First, the water softener they use does a self-cleaning of the line once a day. Apparently, the wait staff doesn't know when that will happen on a daily basis - strange. So, it happened prior to our meal. My water was cloudy and my iced tea tasted like salty dishwater. The waitress acted like this was no big deal. Secondly, the meal overall is rather pricey for what you get. Honestly, I could go to a Brazilian steakhouse and have five times the amount of choice meats in an amazing atmosphere for the same price.

Noticed two other chefs cooking and did not put on any show - one, flat out looked tired and didn't want to be there.  Either make them all animated or none. 
Waiter was very nice and friendly and always kept our glasses full - water and diet soda.
Soup and salad were good.  Got the filet mignon and chicken combo.  Very small amount of filet.  Veggies were just okay - lots of onions vs. some sprouts and zucchini.  Not a good ratio.  Ordered fried rice - was good.  I've had better.  Prices are expected.",xVfK4hxPqr57SRleHT1U5w,2,0,2,icOasSFtYLberzJCPvmUlg

GOOD
Food
Food quality and presentation for both sushi and teppanyaki was really nice.  Steak cooked perfectly.  Fried rice was awesome.  Mexican roll nice sized portion and fresh.  Very tasty Lobster and Scallops.

Atmosphere
Very nice atmosphere.

Clean
Staff was cleaning tables and grills at all times.

Bus Service
Water and drinks kept full.  Empty plates removed promptly. 

-----

NEEDS WORK
Waiter/Host
Was not familiar with the menu gave bad information.  Was ""slow"" in that he seemed like he just walked out of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

Portions
Ordered the steak and scallops and only got 4 medium sized scallops and a unusually small portion of steak.  For the price it was really off.

Upcharge
Hidden $3 bucks to upcharge to fried rice for teppanyaki.  Really?  This is customary and should be included or disclosed at the very minimum

1. If you have alot of PATIENCE and don't mind waiting 15 minutes to order and another 20 minutes for a chef to start cooking.
2. If you are on a DIET and want to spend a lot of money on a small portion of good tasting food.
3. If you don't really mind if you get drink refills, and don't mind sitting for 10 minutes with your mouth on fire.
4. If you want to pay for fried rice that you did not realize was an extra $3.80 because ""it comes with eggs and some vegetables""
5. If you don't mind paying 20% gratuity for a party over 8, but are told that it is only an automatic 18% for large parties.

My husband spent 12 years in the restaurant business and always comes to the defense of a server because he is empathetic of the challenges of the position, AND this was the rare occasion that he asked to speak to management. He was very disappointed with his portion of the filet mignon and scallops. The filet was smaller than half of your palm and he received a measly 3 scallops. The worst thing was the amount of vegetables which normally are used to fill up the plate but could have been placed in the same sized small bowl that we received our $4 fried rice in. We were sharing the filet and scallops and added a rice thinking that was an additional portion, but a small bowl was the only portion we received....except for the spoonful of rice that was left over and placed on my husband's plate which was barely accompanied by a child sized portion of vegetables. I'm sorry but when you are paying $35 for a meal....you expect your plate to be at least half full. I told my husband to say something but since it was my birthday he didn't want to make a scene. He did however ask to speak to the waitress when we were charged for food we didn't order. We informed her of the error and she at first tried to argue with us, and then said she would just take it off and ""take it out of her pay"". She returned with a new bill but instead of taking off 3 extra fried rice, she took off 2. We again said that we only ordered one and she said again ""she would just pay for it"". While waiting for our 2 corrected bill, we discovered that we not only paid 20% instead of 18% gratuity, but when she made the adjustment to the bill the gratuity never changed. At this point we asked the bus boy to speak to management, and to our dismay who comes out....the waitress. We asked the waitress to speak to management and she said she WAS the manager! She asked what the problem was and my husband began to tell her about the portion sizes and not even receiving the jasmine rice that was supposed to come with our $35 meal and then how the gratuity was never adjusted at which point she cut him off and said she would give it back to us (because at this point he just went ahead and paid). She continued to cut him off and kept smiling at him in which he said it doesn't seem like you even care. Her response ""I'm keeping a smile so I don't upset you"" At this point we were so disgusted we left.

The owner has very talented chefs who were very entertaining but needs to improve:
-drink service
-portion sizes
-more servers
-better management

Teppanyaki Entree for 2: New York Steak & Shrimp, side salad, fried rice & vegetables $28.99 - This meal was prepared table-side with an intimate hibachi show for my fiancé and ME. Starting off with a knife act, dramatic flames, onion volcano, onion choo choo train (so cute!), egg crack trick, fried rice heart (sweet), and a few other entertaining chef skills. Our shy chef was pretty quiet the entire show and didn't talk too much, but he warmed up to us and by the end of the night we were laughing about the scene from Beverly Hills Ninja when Chris Farley was a Hibachi Chef in the movie. So good! And too funny!

Now, let's talk about the teppanyaki! 
* The Egg Fried Rice was really tasty! We asked for extra garlic and I loved the crispy bits of garlic and crunchy rice texture from the grill. Flavor rating: 4/5
* The New York steak was cooked exactly how we requested it (rare) - it had nice flavor but it's not extraordinary. Just a solid steak if you're in the mood. Flavor rating: 3/5 
* The Vegetables: squash, mushrooms, and bean sprouts added nice texture to the meal. Flavor rating: 3/5 
* The Shrimp was so good! It's cooked in a creamy sauce with amazing flavor and it's super succulent! I would order all shrimp if I can next time! Flavor rating: 5/5

We also ordered some appetizers and a sushi roll from the sushi menu:
* Miso Soup - it was mediocre. I've had better miso soup in my day. Flavor rating: 2/5
* Baked Mussels $5.50 - the mussels were not saucy and too dry for my liking. Flavor rating: 2/5
* Soft Shell Crab $7.50 - the crab was breaded perfectly with a light panko breading and fried just right, extremely flavorful and crispy. Flavor rating: 5/5
* Sweet Heart Roll $11.99 - shrimp tempura, cucumber, spicy crab, eel, avocado. An extremely simple roll, but it's tasty. Flavor rating: 3/5

Now .. oh man... now is just a complete different story. I don't know if they got new owners or new staff or whatever it is? But man do you guys need to hire on some people to help run the business better. Walked in and there were two whole grills full already being cooked for while the whole front was full of guests waiting. We came in and saw a family of 6 already waiting who knows how long? But as I got there another family of 5 came in 15 mins after me than another 4 people on top of that. We all waited up front  for about 20 mins before anyone came out to greet us and seat us. 



My lady doesn't like the whole show thing cuz she' hates being in the spot and shrimp thrown at her and all but loves the Teppan food . We sat down and waited as two servers and the owner walking by us over and over and over again. So I started to try and get eye contact with one and they kept ignoring us. To a point were I was about to get up and leave. Finally after 13 mins of sitting there with no service our server came up and apologized and took our order.we were at a table across from the grill not the actual teppan grill table .Ordered one sushi roll and a teppan plate of filet and shrimp with double orders of fried rice. First off the sushi bar had NO ONE there at all. The sushi chef was looking up at the TV watching the basketball game the whole time. Cool he had no orders that's not a problem. But once we had our order places I couldn't help but to notice the sushi chef watching tv and still not making our roll. Finally after 10 mins I see him making it.. 10 mins pass and he's still not done? We waited and waited and we saw our teppan guy started cooking our order. I over heard him saying it was for us so I knew. He cooked our whole plate in literally 6 mins. So we got our plate and still no sushi yet !? As we start to eat our fried rice came out a few mins after our plate was done and I knew that our rice was not cooked on the teppan grill and was cooked in the kitchen in a wok. You can tell the nasty greasy soggy difference in between it. I was so pissed off! How can you half ass an order and only cook the meats and veggies on gone grill and have the kitchen cook the fires rice? How sad is that? The fried rice was the nastiest fried rice I've ever had in my life! I took 2 bites and it was soggy bland and just gross! Both my lady and I hated it! Half way through our meal 20 mins later finally our sushi comes out. And damn ... disappointed again.. we got a deep fried phile roll and we always do any and everywhere and you can't go wrong with it pretty much. This one was probably the worst sushi roll I've had in my life. The rice was so full of vinegar and also soggy !! The roll was super small and barley had any salmon in it. It was full of cream cheese and soggy salty rice! We than told the server about the rice cuz we hate to complain and we're the last to try and bully people into getting free food. But I just had to. I'm not gonna pay for some nasty food I didn't even eat . I told our server about the rice and after coming back right away with no arguments nothing at all he said they took the rice off our bill cuz they knew we knew the rice was cooked inside the kitchen. Anyways we still paid a 60 dollar  tab for a small piece of filet and some veggies and 5 shrimp and a soggy sushi phile roll. Never coming back again. This was all going on while there was the place packing up and people waiting and waiting for food and service while only two chefs were there and two servers running Around like chickens with their heads cut off. Stay away from this place ! If you want real service and real food and want to have a nice Japanese teppanyaki experience gonto every other place here in Vegas but this one.

It is a newer restaurant, very clean with a more modern decor. The service was excellent. The waitress never let our glasses get empty.

Of course we went on an off night and it was a little slower but I was really surprised that they would have the chef come out and cook every time customer's came in instead of herding people and making them wait to fill up the teppan table.
Even if there was just a couple, they would get seated and the chef would come out soon after drinks were provided and orders were taken!

The Teppan Chef prepared the food cooked to perfection. We both had the filet and shrimp and they truly were cooked properly.

The only small issue I had was that everything was sauced so it did make for a very salty dinner but next time I can ask for no sauce during cooking so that I can use the dipping ones instead. Even the fried rice had too much soy sauce in it but otherwise the meal was great.

I especially liked that we had the buy one get one free from Entertainment Books website so it made dinner all the more worthwhile.

You can tell the rookies by how they just slap the utensils around aimlessly without purpose. But our chef did well, including building the classic onion volcano and the wall of fire.

My wife had the chicken. I had the scallops and calamari. They were both surprisingly yummy, mainly due to the sauces that came with the plates. Portion sizes were reasonable (I remember always leaving hungry after Benihanas). My wife and I were entertained by the cheesiness of it all. I just wished there were new tricks and new jokes to go with the updated food.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,1,1,4,OUPxVth4k5nooPQ_JHwdRA

Started off with a nice cold sake (always the best way to start teppanyaki)
Then a really nice spice to the edamame... good and hot!!! Ooooooo Yeah!
Salad was crisp and fresh and a good ginger dressing. Miso soup was good quality.
Entree: Shrimp was very good. Lobster was even better!!!!
Super tender, juicy, seasoned with butter and garlic, and their dipping sauce has a little extra touch of flavor which was a nice treat.

We wanted to show her the Japanese flair cooking of singing twirling spatulas and flying eggs and of course the onion volcano.  
Unfortunately I think we got the DISHWASHER as our CHEF at our table.  All the other tables were filled with oooohs and ahhhhs of the chef's tricks, but our lame ""cook"" did NONE of the traditional fun.  He basically cooked the food in normal fashion like I would at home.  Why pay the extra money for this?  
He didn't make enough rice to even fill the bowls, he sliced and cooked the steaks one at a time and his ""special flavoring"" was a TABLESPOON of GARLIC per small steak.   Luckily I saw this before he got to mine and asked him to hold the garlic.  Who wants to hide the flavor of a good filet mignon with a huge dollop of garlic? 
His onion volcano was a pitiful 2 layers of onion rings. and he left the vegetables for last and cooked them so little time, they were firm and practically RAW on the plate. Cold raw cabbage in the mix? blech!
I gave 3 stars, because despite the pitiful skills, the soup, rice and steak did have good flavor.  the vegetables were fresh and would have been good if properly cooked.  If you get a good chef, i'm sure this would be an excellent restaurant.  we were just unlucky.

I don't eat a lot but even for me the portion size is so tiny and not worth the 30+ dollars they charge plus you have to pay extra for the fried rice which is so stupid and you only get a little barely a full cup.",on7cSFFuQTTPMxhp-szt6Q,0,0,3,OPzwVy_FaNBfv4CbiqW6Ew

Our group of 6 (2 kids 4 Adults) wanted tepanyaki and we thought it would be good entertainment for the kids while the adults drank...ha! 
No way we were driving to the strip for tepanyaki...so glad we didn't.  Who knew this great place was in the neighborhood and at really reasonable prices for portions and quality.

I would definitely suggest the steak entree.  The combos were good but just seemed like more bang for your buck with the single entree  orders.  (See menu pics)

The chef was great (see pic) sorry didn't remember his name...too much sake. He was entertaining the kids and actually carrying on a conversation with us.  Fried rice was bomb..everybody was happy with seasoning and sauces with the whole meal. There was two other tables with kids...so definitely family friendly.

The service was great and staffing was perfect.  =) There's a bar in the dining area but very small...its not the type you'd wanna hang out at and eat dinner by....just saying.

BAD
The lighting in the restaurant was fine when we walked in cause the two other tables were in full service (745pm).  As they cleared the different tables and grills...they shut off the lights and ambiance gets very gloomy and too dark.  Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Ambiance killer.

I definitely would dine here again with family or friends.  Prices are good and so is the service. 

OH! I almost forgot the cotton candy was a hit! ...i usually stay away from that type of sweet stuff but it was good =) and the kids loved it!",D5Cmz4luMLa0WD4LjYgpKQ,2,2,4,Edg3DDQODrHSe8rkFu1WKg

You can sit at the sushi bar or the big tables for teppanyaki. We opted for the entertainment, so we sat at the big table. The staff was very attentive, maybe too much.. There was a man and woman waiting on us in tandem and they clearly didn't communicate. No biggie.. Our chef was super entertaining! All the same old tricks we've seen at other places, but still fun..catching things in his hat, volcano smoke out of the onion, etc.. I oered scallops and filet. I asked for my filet to be rare plus, it was more like medium :-( why is everyone afraid to leave the meat a tad bloody? Other than that, everything was pretty decent. Sushi I fresh and delish.

It all looked like fried rice to me and I always wondered how the food got properly divided when you have multiple parties at your table.

After watching a teppanyaki competition on the Food Network, I realized there was a bit more to just cooking on a propane-heated flat surface grill.

First off, it helped that the Husband and I had the teppanyaki chef all to ourselves.  Sure, it's not likely you'll get that experience, but it definitely contributes to a good or bad evening.  Chefs with a good personality will give a good show and everyone will have a good time.

I chose the Chicken and Scallop Combination Dinner ($24.95), while the Husband chose the New York Steak and Chicken Combination Dinner ($26.95).  They both came with miso soup, ginger salad, steam rice, shrimp and seasoned vegetables.  

The waitress was a smart one - she offered edamame to start when she got our beverage orders.  And suggested the fried rice option when we put our food orders in.  We declined and she offered one order so we could share it.  For $2.95 more, we upgraded one of our steamed rices to a fried rice.

When it came down to it, our chef was entertaining and engaging.  He did a few tricks that we didn't see during the competition, and that had us a bit surprised.  He was friendly and personable, and it did make for an enjoyable eating experience.

Food-wise, we were both pretty full surprisingly.  Was it worth the $50?  Not really.  (It helped that we had a BOGO free entree with the Entertainment card.)  It was definitely something to experience at least once.

Not only do they have teppanyaki tables, but regular tables and a small sushi bar.  Most diners were enjoying the teppanyaki experience here though.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,14,10,4,sBnkwipfGh-DjVJythyJoQ

First, let me say that the staff is usually pleasant.  Last night the waiter was pushy in getting is to place our order.  I know that the other people at the table were seated first, and already eating their salads, but if you are in a rush to start cooking for the table, seat us elsewhere.  We ordered a Philly roll, which was ""adequate"".  As my husband said, it looked like a roll you could buy in a food store.
We both ordered fried noodles instead of rice.  Each was an additional $4.95.  Are you serious?  Basically it's thin noodles with garlic and sauce.  Most of the Japanese stead houses charge extra, but that's ridiculous.  And I noticed that when the chef was making the fried rice ($2.95 extra, I think) for the other guests the amount of vegetables, etc. that were added had decreased from the last time we were there.
My husband had the filet and scallops and I had the scallops.  First word that comes to mind is ""greasy"".  Everything was too oily and over-seasoned.  My husband felt that the steak was not the quality that it used to be.  The scallops had a good taste, but were greasy.  
The chef seemed to be going through the motions (beating heart of rice, onion volcano).  Maybe we're just so used to the show, but nothing special there.
I also ordered a glass of plum wine.  The cost was $6.95.  Wouldn't complain, but the glass was less than 1/2 full -- not an ""honest"" pour.
There are several places in the valley that are of higher quality and at a better price.

Wait staff was friendly and well mannered.  It wasn't super busy around 7pm when we arrived, but it most reached a full house by 8pm.

Our teppanyaki chef Matt was very entertaining; he's got lots of cheesy food jokes but seemed to really enjoy what he was doing, which made the experience that much better! The food was great.  We had steak, shrimp, chicken, scallop, veggies as well as the fried rice.  Everything was up to par and satisfying.

We also ordered the Chef Special Hokkaido Scallop Sushi roll.  The reason why we ordered it was because it's a sushi roll with banana in it, which is an ingredient we've never seen in sushi before...the end result was W.O.W!  Its a chunk of sweet banana on top of a tender scallop, both wrapped with soy-paper, and the whole thing was flash fried, then topped with surimi and some yummy orange color aioli.  The representation of the dish was pleasing to the eye, and the taste reminds me of tempura fried banana, almost dessert like! The combination was almost surreal, leave me wanting more!

For dessert we ordered Lychee Creme Brulee.  It was also ordered out of curiosity.  We didn't think Lychee would pair well with creamy eggy things...guess we were wrong!  The Lychee flavor was definitely a big part of the creme brulee.  In a way, it lightened the heaviness of the dessert.  On the bottom of we also found chunks of lychee, which was an added bonus to the dish!

Wonder how you'd feel going to a Japanese owned Chinese restaurant or an Italian owned French restaurant, anyways.....  

The service was okay, nothing to YELP about.  I think the prices are definitely high, ordered the combo meal, NY steak and Shrimp, got what seems like a 4oz. piece of steak and two shrimps for something like $24 that included a tiny salad with some veggies and a bowl of fried rice, totally not worth the price when there was hardly any flavoring in the food besides a little butter and soy sauce.  

They first serve the fried rice and veggies, probably wanted you to fill up on rice and veggies before they serve the meat and seafood.  Asked why the steak was so small compared to others that did not order the combo but just steak alone. Was told the combo steak is smaller because it was a combo meal.  Do not get this since the combo meal is more expensive to compensate for more food but that was not the case.

Our average per person including 3 kids was about $25 each for food excluding tips for the cook and wait staff.  Was still hungry when we left.

It's your typical hibachi style restaurant with typical menu items, and a few desserts. The tables seat 8, I went with just my mom and we sat next to a really nice family visiting from California. The ambience encourages you to interact with your table mates and there is a TV, but it's off in the distance and is not a distraction.

The missing star is only because it's a bit pricy and the portions aren't very large. They also never served me my rice that was supposed to come with my meal. 

Random advice: the restaurant is small and the hibachi tables are close together, which means it's HOT in there. Not so much so that I was uncomfortable, but it's definitely not your typical AC on full blast Vegas restaurant.

Our teppanyaki chef really tried hard but somehow just fell short. His skills operating his cooking utensils and doing any type of ""tricks"" that you normally associate with his position were lacking. He also had way too many one liners and seemed to try too hard cracking jokes rather than focusing on a teppanyaki chef's cooking & entertainment skills that are done with his hands & utensils.
All in all the food was good but not out of this world. My wife had the scallops dinner and it was made very well, definitely recommended. I had the steak dinner and it was done quite good as well but no big surprises either way. Where they fell short is the fact that the veggies were sorely lacking in quantity and I've never had cabbage instead of sprouts... and it's not for me.

So, filet and chicken were delicious, the land n sea is mouth watering. Sashimi was fresh and the presentation in a glass was very impressive. Daughter loved her steak so we all were very satisfied 

Well done",h0CvRLRx8grsteP6qYTdnw,0,0,5,7yutiyzMlcCcr1h2LBX97g

Teppanyaki is a style of Japanese cuisine in which food is cooked directly in front of guests on a hot iron plate. We arrived at 5:00 PM at opening time. With two tired children, I hoped this would be an option perfect for a family meal time. Jason, our Teppanyaki Chef, was our answer to a delicious dinner and entertainment. He had is sense of humor as one tool, a smile and his array of teppanyaki utensils. The children were immediately engaged by knife skills, the dynamic preparation of vegetables, scallops, lobster tail, shrimp, steak for grilling, and a refined act of food presentation.  In addition, we selected yakisoba (fried noodles) and rice. The entire experience was enjoyable from cooking, plating and eating.

From the moment we arrived, the attention to service was considerate and efficient. Throughout the evening, the staff kept drinks full, plates cleared from the table, and children's hashi in hand. Overall, we felt a positive atmosphere.

I observed another family at an adjacent table, the chef ensured food allergies were observed. He was polite and carefully prepared the Foods with consideration of gluten free soy sauce and seafood like shrimp.

Wish list:
Use of organic ingredients including rice, meats, and soy sauce.

Check to see if there's a changing table in restroom.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,3,1,4,YXZGlBwCYBR4QLXTSmL2MA

They are very accommodating to people with shellfish allergies because they made my chicken and rice first before everyone else's. 

We come here about 3 times a year since it opened. Highly recommend it!",ZuWAof5l6yKeft-F1QCWSQ,0,0,5,OG7Pmkk-ZLYrQNIBtsVBmg

Kept us laughing as he cooked for us. Of coarse the birthday surprise to my friend was another highlight with what they brought out. I would recommend this place for a special occasion.,pY-tdjqZxUivS5JJNJdsCw,0,0,5,Q_o6OvXNu3GQm96ovrL-cg

Also, they charge an extra $2.95 for fried rice instead of steamed rice.  $1.00 might be reasonable.  Service was okay, waitress was not very friendly.  Scallops were cooked well.  Teppanyaki cook not as entertaining as those I have seen in the past.  If you have a 2/1, then it is a pretty good deal.",XqxfND6MnnWCy-4Y3Hf7wg,0,0,3,Su97s3l5WxQVgsojoyukdQ

I was by myself on work travel so I sat at the sushi bar.  I quickly ordered 3 rolls and the chef said, ""I hope you're hungry"".  I then asked him if 3 was too many and he recommended I start with two.  He was right.  Their rolls were much larger than the Orlando, Fl rolls that I am used to.  In Orlando, rolls are usually 8-10 pieces.  His rolls were probably 12-15 pieces each.  They were fresh and delicious.  I ordered the 007 and the Salmon Lemon.  Both were very good.  What I liked the most was that they weren't your typical rolls, they were ones I hadn't had before.  If you're in Summerlin, give this place a try!",uQ5ggtEZIu5bzQDN6Lexew,1,0,4,HVPoyf176NT6FweRMGm9hQ

He never picked up the dishes from the salad and miso soup. We actually had to stack them out of the way. He forgot a side of rice, and I tried to flag him down and ended up getting the female server who came and took care of us. He eventually returned and apologized, but disappeared again so I ended up flagging down the female server once again for our check. I can't stand paying top dollar for food and getting mediocre service. We wont be back.",Dz9kA_XAUCLBmNYNIcPXuw,0,0,2,KAf-wmifmAvKqZseKC8Wcw
