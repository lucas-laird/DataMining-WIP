I can't express enough how AMAZING the customer service is!!!!!",aXdfgHxpqNCm8MoCYzHG2w,0,0,5,xwoojdFIwSwnMw9xc-VvTA

I'd never heard of this place before, but received an alert on my phone that this establishment had just been added to Postmates and it had a discounted delivery fee.  Boom!  Everything sounded divine on the menu.  I haven't had a good pizza for a minute and wasn't expecting anything great on a busy Friday night, but wow.  This pizza not only looks bomb, it arrived warm and the taste is out of this world!  The only weird thing was a note attached to my box.  I had zero clue they did their own delivery seeing as I found them for the first time on Postmates, so I will most certainly be calling it in for next time.  Come on...hoping these pics do these pizzas justice because this is phenomenal!",Kto_EVYkya-RcHsLkuXQyw,0,0,5,vH10VU3Z6w4uT-D4DF4dqg

1729389,2018-01-26,11,wacOylZWqy_w1lG68i39mw,"After hearing and reading so much praise for Red Moon, I was finally able to check it out when working in the area, only to find that they've been sold and replaced by Pizzalicious, with new ownership and management as well as an expanded menu increasing the sandwich and pasta options. Having never been before, I don't know how the current product compares to the previous ownership and rave reviews. However, I am a fan of Pizzalicious's other location and my food here was fairly good.

White Pie was super garlicky and tasty, but did not have the seasoned crust that Pizzalicious is known for. Staff also seemed somewhat unfamiliar with a white pie and kept asking whether I wanted to add on additional toppings. Note that a tasty garlic sauce (similar to an alfredo?) is used instead of the more traditional olive oil. Again, unable to speak on how this compares to RM's previous product.

Also ordered hot wings, which were served 6 to an order and all flats, accurate spice level. Parking lot is small but there are several tables inside and the staff seem to be working hard to maintain quality product. Not sure if it's as good as it used to be (I can't see myself driving across town like previous reviews state), but it's definitely tasty.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,18,4,xQl41uAGBN-6L9yWhU39FA

I came across this place and boy were we happily surprised!! Both pizza (we got the margarita pizza) and salad (Caesar) were ahhhmazing. Grub hub delivered it speedily and the pizza was HOT when we received it & the salad was crisp!! We will definitely will be ordering from this place again. So glad to have found this place. So glad we didn't just go with the normal pizza places. We definitely recommend you try.",h_B9l2w1BCDsNLv90yJ4gw,0,0,5,Ja7EhhmWKoxChgZVVI7kDA
2988441,2018-02-05,2,wacOylZWqy_w1lG68i39mw,I loved this place so much! They make your pizza fresh in front of you! It's got great flavor and the crust is perfect. It's new sleek and clean inside with plenty of seating! They also had great homemade ranch to compliment our pizza. Pricing is very affordable and they have great specials too! I saw the owner give a customer some change to help finish her order of pizza for her kids and thought it was very sweet. Come support this small business and get some great pizza too!,pcA1OAR30sMQFgl_7YWOpQ,8,6,5,zpm6mmZFzhwzS60tRrtwsA

1 Zita
1 Lasagna 
1 Chicken Parm
2 Orders of this Mayo Chicken Stuff
Truth be told the Lasagna was INCREDIBLE. I plan on returning just for that alone.

I want to try their other Italian dishes...",WQjwX2ln6fFgl3HgaiOuHg,0,0,4,m_ixbhLR9OUqEQsBOYlkRA

They have a great variety of items at AFFORDABLE prices . Budget friendly.
They have plenty of specials to choose from .
My grandson had a small pizza , I had meatball sandwich and my daughter had chili dogs . Everyone was happy.
The food is really good but to be 100% honest , no matter how good the food is - if I don't get friendly service ? I won't come back to a place . This place has friendly and attentive service so I will DEFINATELY return .",ats8qvpIrTawAhgXmDUg8w,0,0,4,ajQXlTcaojaUeCsGox34Sg

We contacted the restaurant and they hung up on me. I then contacted GrubHub. The lady there was very helpful, she tried contacting Pizzalicious. They refused to fix the problem, replace the missing food, or issue a refund. Thankfully, GrubHub gave us a credit. But that doesn't compensate for the lack of care shown by this restaurant. It is disappointing at the least, that they refused to acknowledge their mistake and make it right. We order out frequently,  and this restaurant has been crossed off our list. Poor customer service is inexcusable!",xHg5aDNA793ibFHBl36OlA,0,0,1,LcahVCwxr7D7hjm-mElHdQ

4802250,2018-02-05,0,wacOylZWqy_w1lG68i39mw,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there is no way that this establishment deserves anything but a mediocre rating. Before I begin, I will put forth a disclaimer and say that I did not eat their pizza. If you are looking for pizza, do not read this review.  If, however, you were foolish enough to order subs, you will be extremely disappointed. The bread reminded me of leftover we made too much bread from Walmart. The Italian sub contained very little meat and cheese. Unbelievable.  Finally, as a last poke in the eye I insult, they actually used the cheap kind of roast beef that you can get for $.79. What a disgusting disgrace. So, I am not saying anything negative about the people there. They were nice. What I am saying is that this piece of crap establishment does not know how to make subs. On top of it all, it is in a really bad neighborhood. I don't have a problem with that. As I travel around, I encounter many fine eating establishments in really dicey areas. To compensate for the neighborhood, however, they need to have some quality food. This establishment does not accomplish that. I do not recommend this restaurant at all, but I give it two stars instead of one because I did not eat the pizza and because the people were OK people. Sort of. The subs suck.",V-xw7aKpV9lXEP27omOLRw,0,0,2,dxuLCuaIPDdx5rxRzPoQTQ

5816035,2018-06-01,0,wacOylZWqy_w1lG68i39mw,"Absolutely horrible. Ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was burnt to a crisp. The owner said he thought my pizza was supposed to be ""well done."" I've never heard of a well done pizza. He gave me a free dessert for the mistake which I appreciate, but only to realize I was charged for a large when I ordered a medium anyway. The new pizza he made me was mediocre. I've had better at Little Cesar's. The pizza shop smelled like sewer which I didn't understand. The employees eyes were bright red and glossy, and although I'm aware of the new legal meds we can purchase - don't think they should be making pizzas under the influence. The shop itself is located in a very sketchy place which I honestly didn't care much about until I went inside. It's supposedly a new pizza shop but if it continues like this, I don't think they will last.",QL-tjDrZWo5ph-GTm7OdxA,0,0,1,ggLG0uQ2eGutRcRLkv1cew
