There are three important aspects to this establishment: atmosphere, service, and taste.

The atmosphere was very quaint, and even as someone who generally doesn't care about the look of the place I'm eating at, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. 
The service was very timely (especially considering there was only one person making drinks). My only qualm was the cashier couldn't figure out how to print a receipt, but in no way did that detract from my overall experience here. 
The taste was something else. I ordered a caramel milk tea with boba, and I wholeheartedly expected some overly sweet creation as I had in the past from other tea bars. Instead, the flavor was balanced. It wasn't overly sweet nor was it overly bitter. The boba was so fresh that it was still hot, and the texture was uniform and slightly chewy. 

In the end, this place was a treat for me because I usually have to settle for sub-par boba that is near my home. I surely plan on returning next time I'm near this part of town.",gpL6tCUwk72mpHDV4n9YBw,0,0,5,vaBhFa5PeAgN4Zy9DwPFww

We were greeted accordingly and immediately given menus. My boyfriend loves cats so he loved their little theme going on.

We had an almond coffee milk tea with boba, regular size. Their regular size is pretty large so we shared a drink. It adds only $.99 on to your charge to get a regular size so id recommend getting it, to make the most of your visit. The drink itself was pretty good. I tasted more coffee than the teeniest hint of almond though. The boba was nice and squishy. 

We ordered a wintermelon milk tea afterwards, only small sized with boba just to try it out. This drink is my boyfriends usual at other places, and he thought this one was great too! It had a really strong wintermelon flavor and a bit milkier than other places but in a good way. It was a little sweet though even for my sweet tooth.

The service was wonderful though. We were offered any adjustments if we wanted and were asked more than once if things were good. Since this place is new, I say it has a lot of potential. Keep it up ~",KLJ7SypKNaB1G3xhLjh2Dw,1,1,4,_6qK7D70yBw679Skvj5FUQ

Tea Space is open late & this quaint little place has the friendliest workers. You walk in to a cute well-decorated place. They saw us struggling with choosing from their extensive menu and they were kind enough to give us their milk tea to try out. It was so good that my fiancé ordered himself a large. I wanted something fruity though so I decided on mango black tea with lychee pieces. We also ordered takoyaki cause.. why not.

They brought two super tall glasses of our drinks and takoyaki served on a little pan. So cute! The milk tea is not too sweet and we didn't adjust the sweetness so that's a good thing. It's creamy and the boba is chewy, but not too mushy. I loved my mango black tea too. It's bright, not bitter, very fruity and refreshing.

We ordered four drinks which included an almond milk tea (L $4.65), mango lychee smoothie (L $5.24), and two Hokkaido smoothies (S $4.25, L $5.24). 

The Hokkaido smoothie was described to taste like the childhood favorite White Rabbit candy. But when I mixed my drink and took a sip...the White Rabbit flavor I knew and loved couldn't be distinguished. To me it tasted more like a burnt caramel. It still tasted good but was disappointed that it wasn't the flavor as advertised from the cashier. (3/5)

The mango lychee on the menu is said to only come in a smoothie form but when it was ready to be picked up it was clearly an iced tea. When ordering it was clear that a smoothie was the only option for this flavor combo so I was confused when this was the product served. The drink itself wasn't bad but again, the expected product was not delivered. (2/5) 

The almond milk tea was good. It wasn't too sweet and went well with the honey boba. (3/5)

The drinks, however, is a disaster. Since it was my first time here, I asked for recommendations. The guy pointed to the wall of their ""top 10"" items. 

I asked about the winter melon fresh milk tea of which he tells me is delicious. He also suggested that I add sea salt latte on top: which sounded great! For toppings: I opt for the honey boba. 

The drink itself was milky and had no tea flavor at all whatsoever. Since they were willing to make adjustments, I asked for extra tea, which I was then told that there was no tea in my WINTERMELON MILK TEA. That was a little misleading, calling your drink a milk tea when it doesn't have tea at all. They told me it was ""caffeine free"" -- which I then asked if I could change my drink. 

Instead they recommended a wintermelon green tea sea salt latte - which again sounded great! Once the drink was remade, the boba was hot and it melted all the ice. 

What I ABSOLUTELY HATED about this place was that the ice was tiny shaved ice. Every sip I took had ice chunks in my mouth which then diluted the drink itself. The green tea was a disappointment, with no tea flavor at all.. When asked how my drink was: I responded with ""it's ok...."" feeling bad to have them remake another. The worst part is: I ordered a regular size = 32oz. The drink cost $7.98 (with tip)... $8 is quite expensive for a drink I didn't enjoy.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,0,0,3,quK0MndokQmFbQCX5UOGQQ

Cope by specifying less sweetness for your order and you should be good to go. Service is great, which is an anomaly for places that are adjacent to Spring Mountain Road.

Decor is cute with a cat theme, menu is pretty large, and the sizes are good for the price. For first time visitors, staff tend to recommend the house teas, which seem to be extra-sweet due to being made with half and half or cream? Unclear, but too sweet for me. They're great about adjusting or remaking drinks to fit your preference- the wintermelon beverages are refreshing in this ungodly summer heat.

Don't let the outside of the shop or area it's located in deter or discourage you from entering!!! The shop itself is a little smaller but it is cute and gives off a cozy vibe. My only complaint is that it gets a little crammed by the door since there's not much space in there. 

I'm an avid Strawberry Green Tea drinker but I'm always hesitant on trying it since it's either a hit or miss with the flavor. Some shops tend to make it taste very perfume-like but this was not the case here! This place also has THE BEST tapioca balls I've ever had!!!!

Their boba is warm, chewy, and perfectly sweet. 

The only tricksy thing about them is that a ""Teaspace small size"" is typically everyone else's regular; and a ""Teaspace regular size"" is typically everyone else's large.

1. Customer service is fantastic, Alan/Alvin (sorry if you're reading this, lol), he was friendly and let us sample the house milk tea, he ran down the menu for us and described all the popular drinks. 

2. Milk tea, the house milk tea is good, it does taste fresh (not that powder stuff), also tried the hakaido milk tea, better than others I've tried. 

3. Ambience, dim lit seating and real relaxed spa feeling. (Girlfriend did not like the cat paintings tho, needs more dogs lol) 

Cons:
1. Honey boba, the texture is a bit slimy (kinda over cooked?) there's only a hint of a honey taste. Hopefully it'll be better next time I visit. 

2. Signage above shop. Hopefully that is not the final sign, it does not give it a good first impression.

Good amount of parking space in the front. They also have air conditioning. Kind of a small space with small tables, they also play music that isn't too loud. I don't think big groups would be good because of the small table  like maybe 4-5 max will fit comfortably together unless you don't mind being kind of separate ..

Food/drink: I got the wintermelon fresh milk tea. I personally love wintermelon tea and was intrigued about a milk tea version because I have never seen that before! I can say that it didn't disappoint. Tastes like wintermelon tea .. With milk LOL. My friends got the Hokkaido milk tea and the honey green milk tea. I tried both their drinks. The Hokkaido milk tea is compared to have flavors of white rabbit candy in it. The honey green milk tea tastes like any other kind. I liked both their drinks.

Customer service: The employees here are very nice and polite. But that can also be because I came at a time where there was no one here(it was dead). Don't be afraid to ask for samples or ask about any of the drinks! I got a sample of the house milk tea, it was not too sweet; it had a brown sugar taste to it. Not the best house milk tea I've had so I passed on it, but you can try it, just ask for a sample. 
My 2 friends and I took awhile to order and they were very patient and answered any questions we had about the drinks. 

Right now they have a promotion of getting free rainbow jelly when you check in so don't forget! They also can adjust your drink if you think it's too sweet or not sweet enough! :)

First off, I love the name of this new boba spot. I know that isn't super relevant, but I thought you ought to know.

Apparently they have only been open for ten days. The parking is much more convenient than other similar spots on Spring Mountain -cough- Tea Station -cough-. I got the House Milk tea with boba because when I try a place for the first time, I want to try what they think makes them noteworthy. Although, after looking over the menu a little more the most unique flavor they sell is probably Kumquat. I'll get that next time!

When I walked in a young man greeted me enthusiastically. I really appreciated that! He seemed genuinely excited to have my business, and that alone convinced me to order the regular size tea instead of small. Customer service is everything nowadays, and this place seems to have it! 

The best part about my drink was that the boba was hot! It sounds weird but the first drink I had consisted of ice cold drink with hot boba. It was AWESOME. Obviously, the boba cooled as it sat in my iced drink but if there is any test of freshness I think that would be it. It didn't make the ice melt any faster either, it was just fun because I hadn't experience that before in a boba tea. The drink tasted stronger than some other places where I have tried milk tea, but I liked it more for that. They crushed the ice in front of me using a blender which felt unique. It's a small place, but they do have seating if you want to chill out for a while. 

All in all, it ended up being five dollars and some change which was fair for the amount of tea in the regular. I didn't even end up finishing it! The cups aren't super cute or sealed with plastic like at other places, but I didn't mind that.

The House Green (Jasmine) Milk Tea was on the ""top ten"" menu and also came highly recommended on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. I took a sip and it didn't taste good so I thought maybe adding more sweetener would do the trick. Another sip after the adjustment and it wasn't any better, but I felt bad for being bothersome so I just took it (I also wasn't sure how to fix it beyond just having it remade). I think there was actually too much milk in the tea, because it tasted almost like water. Not a strong tea flavor, but not a creamy consistency either. The boba was good though; honey flavored with the right amount of chew. 

My boyfriend got a mango green tea, and his was better than mine. However, this one had a bitter aftertaste. I am a fan of strong tea, but this tasted like it had steeped for a too long.

2573915,2016-05-23,0,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"Located right on the intersection of Spring Mountain and Decatur, this new boba tea ""cafe"" just opened and I highly recommend it. They have somewhat late hours during their soft opening, until 11pm roughly, which is fantastic.

They have a good selection of drinks made in various ways with green or black tea and lots of different kinds of toppings. Their boba was hot and fresh, even in my iced drink, which by the way was GIGANTIC. I think the ""regular"" size here is around 32 oz, but for the same price that many places charge for a 24oz. One interesting point I would like to note is that whatever flavor/ingredients they use to make their drinks did not ""dilute"" or fade a few hours later when my friend had a chance to taste their drink, which can sometimes happen to other places' drinks that are otherwise fine.

The honey boba has a palpable sweet taste to it, which I love. I got the Okinawa (brown sugar) milk tea with boba, and my friend got the Honey black milk tea. The Okinawa tea had a very strong flavor, which I liked a lot. I tried some of the honey black milk tea, and personally prefer honey black milk tea to have a stronger flavor whenever I get it myself, but it was still delicious.

If I could change anything (which maybe I could have, I didn't ask, so ... who knows!) it would be that I'd prefer a little more boba to be included with the regular size as standard. I think next time I come I will order extra boba, as I think other places tend to put a tiny bit more by default. Also, the boba was fresh and chewy, but I think I prefer my boba to be just a little softer/squishier (not soggy necessarily but yeah).

Both employees working at the front on 10:30pm Saturday were extremely polite, and made me feel very at home - the cashier answered any questions I had without hesitation. I think this place will very soon be one of the best boba spots in Vegas once they get settled in fully, even when compared with the slew of other boba places nearby in Chinatown.",-5M7Gg90-iZtQny0h2OGmQ,2,1,4,Tc8goZBH_RVK8sRbmd4D6Q

We use to come here at least once a week since my husband loves the bigger cups, hokkaido milk tea with extra sea salt cream and honey boba. Also, the owner and 3 other men who helped us always treated us well; welcoming and accommodated our adjustments on our drinks. (I personally don't love the drinks here, but that's another story. I find them all basic) 

Actually, all boba shops make it their pride to adjust drinks to your liking. Not sure who hired these women (Joyce), but forget adjustments, they give you the stink eye and a hard time.

We asked if they had Crystal boba today and Joyce says ""No we never did."" (Even though they served it to us a couple times in the past.) We kindly asked if they took it off the menu? Joyce repeated herself, ""No, we don't have it. We never had it""...she says it a few more times in a rude manner. Makes you want to roll your eyes after the second time. LOL! Arguing is ill-advised and it makes you look like a real jerk.

I've noticed that whenever the women employees are working, we ALWAYS have a negative experience. The drinks always come out tasting wrong and tonight was the LAST TIME we will ever come back. Joyce, was training another girl on the register and was on some sort of bull shit high horse. She was flat out rude and refused to adjust our drinks to our liking. She went out of her way to make a simple adjustment request into an argument. Why did it have to become awkward and embarrasing!!!???

Our drinks came out and my husband requested his sea salt cream topped off like they always do for him. It's just 2 tablespoons more of sea salt cream and we were happy to pay any extra topping costs. Every time we come here the men accomodates, including the owner. Trust me, It's not a wild request! 

...This is where it gets fun...

Joyce says, ""No we don't do that."" :/
We go back and forth about this for a few minutes. It was extremely awkward. 

L O L

Que? We come here ALL OF THE TIME & every single time we come here, we order the SAME EXACT DRINK and they ALWAYS, ALWAYS do it for us. However, when high horse Joyce lady is here, they don't do anything apparently. She is an expert at rolling her eyes and walking away though. Yeah, we saw that too, Joyce. 

""We don't do that"" is the motto here. 

Welp, if you don't do anything here, then we will happily go to the 10 other great boba shops in the same neighborhood. 

You are cheap, lack customer service and common sense. I'm beyond frustrated we had to deal with this and we asked for a refund.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,35,23,1,gSD6fht6ejUw2uRCQYvWUQ

I went ahead and looked at their menu that they hand out while the cashier was taking care of another customer. I'm a big oolong milk tea drinker, so I was definitely going to get that. They have 2 options of whether you want regular milk tea or fresh milk tea, in which I'm guessing that the tea and milk for that specific menu option is made fresh on the spot. But either or I chose the fresh milk tea.

As I waited for my drink you can see they have a few art collections on their wall... In which they have a lot of cat pictures. I'm not a cat person but the pictures are pretty cool and a few were pretty cute in the way it was drawn. 

Getting my drink, the young man that made my drink offered if I wanted to sweeten my drink if I'm not too satisfied with the sweetness. In their milk tea you can see the separation of tea and milk first hand, which is pretty cool to me that they do that. Taking my first sip I can definitely taste the nice blend of tea and milk. The milk itself wasn't too sweet whatsoever, which I really do appreciate because I do want to taste the tea itself too. They don't mask the flavor of the tea with the sweetness of the milk perfectly. The lychee jelly I got in it tasted pretty fresh and paired well with my drink.

Overall 2 thumbs up and 5 stars all around for my new favorite boba/tea spot.",Y4B4x6CNJf89_zk7dXp57w,0,1,5,RjqPPF8BTOuX35daaJRTtA

This is the husband's favorite boba place in Vegas, while mine is Chewy Boba, although this place is a very close second for me.  I ordered the Okinawa Coffee + Sea Salt Latte + Rose Boba, while the husband ordered House Milk Tea + Grass Jelly + Pudding.  The cashier was quick to say that they currently only offer rose boba as oppose to honey boba, I guess people have been complaining about that? I liked the rose boba, although I've never tried the honey boba, so can't really make a fair comparison.  The drinks were both good, as a lot of reviewers have stated, the drink size here is abnormally big, the regular size is probably extra large elsewhere.  I thought the sea salt latte was a little overpowering, as opposed to the sea salt coffee at Chewy Boba, which was the perfect amount of saltiness.

The cashier girl put in ""less boba less, less grass jelly"" when I asked for HALF and HALF. I ended up paying a full dollar for such little toppings. The boba was good, chewy but not the best. The grass jelly was broken into tiny little pieces; it's like they gave me leftover, smashed up jelly. Then I asked for the sea salted creme or whatever and I honestly couldn't taste the little saltiness of it and wasted $.99 for nothing. It didn't make a difference. The white gourd was just really sweet. My regular size drink came up to $6.11 It was big, but I didn't really enjoy it.

I came again with a friend and this time I got a Hokkaido smoothie and he got a mango slush. The Hokkaido was just right and the boba was perfect. You could tell that they also added real fruit into the mango slush because it was more of a smoothie consistency and the sweetness was just right.

The house milk tea taste like no other. In always down to try new milk teas but this one is definitely way different than all the other I've tried. I really enjoyed the my order and looking forward to trying the hot pot with a side of milk tea. 

Highly recommend this joint, cool cat theme, bubble teas and hot pot!",Vd24R1OnKzw8WjHLrrDTtw,2,2,4,Pb__mdsE7-SteHQckCy6sw

There is few disappointments but I'll say the owner took very seriously not only he was so patient to hear me out he also complimented me with coupons if my next visit ! I have to give him two thumbs up for being professional and understanding!!!! Then I went back using my coupon order what I always ordered House boba tea and popcorn chicken and they corrected the mistakes and made it sooooo delicious I was happy that they listened and really improved!!!!

But it was a happy surprise discovering this place. With a cat theme and all your boba spot essentials (hipster feel, board games, very aesthetic), it's not a bad place to have your post-meal tea time or to hang around and talk.

Looking at their menu, it's more than your typical milks tea fare. Along with the usual expansive drink menu and some smaller appetizers, they have a full hotpot menu. It can be a little confusing however because the place sports two menus, both with the entire drink list, but one has the hotpot menu on the back and the other has other foods. Ordering felt really awkward as well because the server was pretty bashful.

What I was not expecting were the sizes of the drinks. The large was bigger than my friends head. I had their matcha fresh milk tea with rose boba because they had run out of their other boba. The tea seemed to be steeped too long because the tea tasted very bitter. But because my company said their drinks and the takoyaki they ordered had been good, I think I'll come back and give it one more shot.",YMF7w4fuW9bocGukfuJ8RA,0,0,3,vBUFws9OIAKHOyZ6kIKKCw

This place is legit.. I can't rave enough about it. For those who are fans of half and half in the SGV or Rowland area, their drinks are close to half and half's in taste minus the gigantic cups...which I dislike anyways

I got the mango green tea with sea salt latte. The tea is fragrant and flavorful and their mango flavoring is really good. Not artificial tasting at all! Ratio of latte foam to tea was amazing... creamy enough without being overly milky!

Boba was on the softer side if you like that...

Will definitely make this a must stop in Vegas!",MyOH75RSsjvpWKQ3N37C8Q,1,2,5,958N9bQYlcCpZ3s6gndEyA
3522527,2016-09-03,5,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"Woohoo! I'm glad they have another awesome boba place in the Vegas area. This place would probably be in one of my top picks (along with Brew tea and Half and Half). I love boba and it was nice to find a good place because I have tried a bunch of other places which were either decent or straight up horrible. This place definitely reminds me of Half and Half because of their menu design and drink selections. 

So far I have tried the lavender milk tea, iced milk with caramel, honey green tea, and strawberry milk tea. All of these drinks were pretty good and I love how the regular size is super huge, but it makes sense since you are pretty much paying $6 bucks for a drink. You can definitely taste the tea in the drinks. My biggest pet peeve is when my drink straight up tastes diluted. I'd expect to at least taste some hint of the tea.  The boba quality has definitely gotten better compared to the first time I got here. I'd say it ranks up there along with Brew Tea. 

Also, the staff is super nice so if you aren't satisfied with your drink they will gladly remake it until you are happy. I do have to admit that I had to have my drinks remade at times, but they turn out pretty good. I am tempted to try the Hokkaido or Okinawa milk tea, but those are my go to drinks at Brew Tea and I probably have high expectations because of that. 

I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. If worse comes to worse, Kung Fu is literally right across the street lol. Their design is also awesome! It has that hipster cafe kinda vibe to it. The best part is they have cat pictures and other cool artwork (super heroes, Alice in Wonderland, etc).

3780995,2017-09-14,1,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"Tea Space is the place to go if you want a huge cup of boba near Chinatown. Their normal size is like the size of a large anywhere else and they have an even bigger size if you prefer for $1 extra. I've only been here twice and they were very different experiences. My first visit was a weekday afternoon and I ordered the #1, the large House Milk Tea with Boba and Pudding (~$6). This visit was great, our group hung out for hours playing a card game they had lying around called Flip City. My drink was great, lasted a long time because I got a large, though next time I might as for it less sweet. There was a steady stream of customers but the place wasn't packed and the atmosphere was chill.

On my second visit, I came on a Saturday night and witnessed the popularity of this place firsthand. Every table was taken, the line was to the door, and people were loudly playing card games. Alright, so I decided to just get something to take home. This time I ordered another thing on the top 10, a large Okinawa Coffee + Sea Salt Latte (~$6.50) and asked for it less sweet. The lady at the register was nice and she asked me to try it and make sure it was okay. The drink was ridiculously sweet and I asked her if they could make it even less sweet. Someone took it to the back but I saw them just add plain water into the drink and mix it up... (water? why not just add more of the coffee?) Sure enough, when I was asked to try it again it tasted like watered down coffee. I gave up. I waited long enough in line and the place was so packed that I didn't want to stay there any longer. Really disappointing as the drinks are fairly expensive compared to other boba shops.

Final Thoughts: I've noticed a lot of uncanny similarities between this place and a chain of boba places in LA called Half and Half. From their paper menu design, to their top ten layout and large boba cups, its all eerily similar and I'm curious if they're affiliated. I had one good experience and one bad experience thus far. I like their location but I'll definitely avoid busy days and times here.

Once you enter Tea Space, it has this dark and inviting atmosphere with a lot of Cat decor. However it's spacious and creative use of space with bench seating against the wall and repurposed tables with metal chairs.

Some of the few drinks I enjoy is....
1. Wintermelon Green Tea- Balanced flavor of sweet and refreshing flavor.
2. Passion Fruit Black Tea- Fruity tea that is balanced and refreshing great with Lychee Jelly.
3. Hokkaido Milk Tea- (Taste like White Rabbit Candy)

The toppings are delicious especially their boba; Sweet, Chewy and Consistent texture throughout. Lychee Jelly is flavorful and sweet but I'm biased with Lychee, one of my favs. 

Every member of the staff is very friendly and helpful especially in deciding what drink(s) you want.

The slush was taste pretty good, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, though you have the option to adjust the drink. The dumpling soup was ok.

The menu is pretty vast and there are a lot of options, so I really appreciated that they had a board of the top 10 customer choices to consider.
The gent behind the counter helped answer some questions I had about the menu and we ordered a coffee milk tea and lavender milk tea, both with boba.
It wasn't until I asked about sweetness and whether it could be modified that the server mentioned anything. It's also not clear in the café so just be aware that if you don't want a super sweet drink, that you can opt for less sugar.
The drinks themselves were good! The coffee milk tea was perfect and the lavender one was subtle but you could taste the flavour along with the tea too.

Their extensive menu includes snacks such as dumplings and even hot pot in addition to coffee,tea, and yogurt!

If you're the type who can't decide, look no further than their easily visible Top 10 menu behind the counter. It looks like the rankings have changed a bit from previous photos. At the top of the list was the Okinawa coffee with sea salt latte, which was the one I ended up trying. For $0.99 more, you can get a 32 oz. ""regular"" size, which felt like I was drinking a Big Gulp. It was a little on the sweeter side and if I were to order it again, I would get 3/4 sweetness. Other popular drinks on the list include wintermelon, Hokkaido milk tea, and ice milk.

We thought the cat theme was super cute, but actually came for the boba. They had a decent variety of boba options. I ordered a fresh milk tea with boba and a chicken curry snack. Additional orders at our table included a mango juice, oolong milk tea, and a green tea as well as a popcorn shrimp dish that in total only cost around $40 dollars. 

The reasonable prices for their drinks and the drink sizes really shocked us. Three of us ordered small drinks and my husband decided on the regular. The small drinks had to be at least 16-20 oz and the regular was huge and was probably around 32 oz in size. I did not order the 32 oz drink, but asked if I could grip the container and could barely get my hands around it. Basically come prepared to drink lots of tea if you visit this joint.

We ordered the following:
01.  Mango Green Tea - $3.66 - 3 Stars
- Green Tea was bitter and dark, Mango syrup was a bit too sweet. It was just okay.

02.  House Milk Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars
- Smooth milk tea w/ Honey Boba.  I'm not a fan of Honey Bobas at all but the kids loved it.

03.  Okinawa Milk Tea - $3.66 - 4 Stars
- Smooth and Creamy but we've had better in Cali. The portion of sweetness and tea was perfect. Do recommend always ordering ""Okinawa Mik"" if it is offered.

04.  Passion Fruit Black Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 3 Stars
- Good Passion Fruit flavor, not too bitter or sweet.

05.  Oolong Milk Tea w/ Boba  - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars
- Oolong tea is a better option if you're not into the dark or bitter teas. Tastes lighter and are smooth with Milk Teas. 

LOCATION - In a tiny shopping plaza, tiny internal space. Depending on where you are on the street you have to make a U-turn to see it. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE - Not the FRIENDLIEST or the FASTEST, but I'm used to Cali Tea Houses where the volumes of people are much higher.  We waited 20 minutes for our 5 drinks. Prices are decent for the cup size you get. It's the same price for the regular or large so why not just get the larger one right. The definitely can improve on the speed of getting the tea orders. 

GOOD THINGS - They have a Stamp Card for frequent buyers so you can get free drinks. Pick one up if you are from Vegas.  

VERDICT - Good teas for Vegas but we have so many amazing one in Cali that Cali Tea Houses are still my FAVE ones.  But when I'm in Vegas next, I'll stop by to get my stamp card punched.",t_ZPq_AJB0MQs4b-EX56Mg,2,1,4,2pSULhBbxclAHJ5DBVVQ2w
4006018,2016-05-20,7,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"Another new addition to the Vegas boba scene. Recently opened, Tea Space is sort of similar to Half and Half. The product they use is from Half and Half and the workers are ex-Half and Half boba shop workers. They claim to serve more tea-based drinks compare to other boba shops around. 

Location is a little tricky. It's located on the north of Church's Chicken, and is next to L.A. insurance. Small plaza but is quiet so not hard to find a parking space. I was greeted with a warm welcome by two friendly staffs. Cashier was super friendly and knowledgeable, and was able to recommend few drinks for me based on what I was craving. 

Drinks I have tried:

Wintermelon green tea. Also known as white gourd and can be made into a milk tea with a choice of green/black tea. Wintermelon here taste similar to the Lollicup version, but without the weird sugary aftertaste. I personally prefer Kung Fu Tea's version because the tea and whitegourd juice is well-balanced. 4/5 

House milk green tea. Also known as jasmine milk tea. This is probably my most favorite drink here. Creaminess was on point and tea has a strong herbal taste which I enjoyed. It's not too milky so even though it is a milk tea, it was still a refreshing drink. 5/5

Green tea with sea salt. Sea salt foam is becoming the next big thing in boba scene. I believe there are only 2-3 boba shops in Vegas that offers sea salt cream and based on trying other places, sea salt here is probably the worst rendition I have had. It has this unpleasant buttery taste to it. Consistency is rather runny so unlike other sea salt cream I have had where the cream drizzle down, it will just mix with the drink with few shakes. Bad batch? They just opened so I'm sure they still have some kinks to work out. 2/5

Iced milk drink with brown sugar and hot honey boba. I expected the same quality as Half and Half where the drink itself has a crystal and icy texture. That was not the case. It was basically a milk slush that melted into a regular milk, and honey syrup from boba in addition to brown sugar was too much sweetness for me to handle. Very similar to wow milk from KFT, which is a milk based drink with no tea, and has boba marinated in red sugar. It is a decaf drink so good for late night boba craving. 3/5

Chocolate milk tea with black tea base. Black tea is strong and with the request of less sweetness, chocolate flavor was weak. If you like chocolate, I prefer their other drink called iced chocolate which is like a chocolate slush. If you do decide to stick with their chocolate milk tea, I would suggest getting chocolate milk tea with just regular sweetness and with green tea for more chocolate flavor. 3/5

Strawberry milk tea with green tea base. Surprisingly green tea was weak with a strong artificial strawberry syrup taste. Not too creamy which was nice but I would ask for less sweetness on this particular drink. 3/5

They marinate boba in honey. Sweet and more on the softer side. Sadly not as good as the boba from Half and Half. I wish it was warmer and had more chew like Half and Half. 

Friendly staff, ample seating, decent drinks and stamp card. They have everything you can possibly ask for in a boba shop.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,16,11,4,ukbIm4mymU9S3zzfdqm1Nw

As soon we walked in, the nice lady offered us menu. 

We tried oolong milk tea, Jasmine milk tea, mango slush, and lychee iced tea. Price wise it's slightly higher than other tea places. The reason for that is their tea is superb and fresh quality. If you enjoy higher quality tea drinks then this is the place for you. Also, their boba was perfectly cooked. 

It's a cute place to hangout. I didn't see any free wifi. They have stamp card but I'm out of town so I didn't take one.",rYGi5DJ_54qeoWkkqB21jA,0,3,4,Vpla2Z87sXmgjhqIdRAN7g

4048579,2016-05-31,5,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"There's been a lot of talk about Tea Space aka the newest boba joint to hit the town. People have been comparing this place to Half and Half Tea House (for those who frequent the SoCal 626 area or are from there) and I can see why. 

Like Half and Half, Tea Space includes honey boba for almost all their drinks. They offer pretty much the same types of drinks on their menu and even have very similar aesthetics as the SoCal joint. 

I went with the iced milk with egg pudding, caramel, and honey boba. It was SUUUUPER SWEET but I'm not complaining, I prefer sweet drinks anyway. (However, you can always ask for less sweet.) Also, they give you a decent amount of caramel so make sure to mix your drink well or it'll taste as if you're just drinking cold milk. The honey boba was chewy and hot which made for a nice contrast against the drink. But the egg pudding was definitely the winner for me! It had a good consistency and the pudding + iced milk combo felt like a matchmade in heaven in my mouth. Definitely recommend adding egg pudding to your drink whether you order the milk tea or the iced milk. SO BOMB. 

My only thing is with the cups. Yeah, the size portions ARE HUGE but the cups aren't the most convenient with drinks that require a lot of mixing since they're capped off with a plastic tops and the straw can only do so much. Maybe if they're plastic sealed? Otherwise, definitely will be back to try their other drinks! ^______^",uS2rQ9oyAJ1nOMbL0YL2lg,4,5,4,_iw7kDaKD6rNwCf3Do00dw

I guess I'm letting the cat out of the bag with this one.  They sure love cats at Tea Space.  It's obvious that the owner loves cats.  First of all, check out his car.  His license plate says ""I Love Cat"".  Second, Tea Space is located on Spring Mountain and DeCATur.  See the coincidence.  And if that isn't enough, then check out the décor.  Cat's everywhere!!  You cat miss it.  You'll meet Jazz the King Cat at the front counter.  He's a cat statue dressed like a king chillin' like a villain.  He's obviously the Alpha Cat.  Then there's the posters on the wall.  You'll find Harry Potter the Cat, Thor the Cat, Catman, and my favorite, Cat-Tain America.  I didn't get the names of the owner or employees.  But I have to admit, they are a couple of cool cats. 

As for their menu, it's pretty simple and basic.  They serve fresh teas, milk teas, iced coffees, milk smoothies, yogurt drinks, ice soy milk drinks, and slush drinks.  Yes, the menu has a lot of ""cat""egories.  Toppings include honey boba, egg pudding lychee, jellies, green & red bean, taro, honey, and sea salt.  I had the coffee milk tea with boba.  It was delish and hit the spot.  We also had a free sneak peek of their grass jelly with sea salt.  Four words...You cat deny it.  Sorry, cat help it.  I can't catain myself.  It was good and mixed well with my coffee milk tea. Take my advice and ask for the grass jelly.  It would be a ""cat""astrophe if you didn't.  As for me, I had a huge serving of boba and can barely move.  I'm almost ""cat""atonic.  Time for a cat nap, so I'll end it my review now.  My final thoughts....iced milk tea with boba on a hot summer day in Las Vegas equals purrfection.

4106999,2016-05-23,7,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"I'm so happy that we finally have good boba near the intersection of Spring Mountain and Decatur.

(Call the police. That's definitely shots fired.)

Tea Space is a new addition to the burgeoning Las Vegas bubble tea scene, and I managed to find the time to try it despite stuffing myself on a late dinner at one of the many great nearby restaurants. I actually missed them the first time because the name on their sign didn't stand out, but they're in that tiny strip mall on Decatur next to the foot spa.

The cashier presented a paper booklet menu to me when I first entered. They don't have a menu board (yet). I saw options for house green milk tea and fresh green milk tea and inquired about the difference. The former uses creamer, whereas the latter has actual milk. I leapt at the opportunity for real dairy and got the 32 oz ""regular"" size ($0.99 on top of the $3.66 tea price) and the honey boba ($0.50). I thought it was 24 oz at first, but i checked the bottom of the plastic cup. It's actually 8 oz larger than what most places call a ""large."" The more the merrier, right?

They prepared my order in a reasonable amount of time and told me to let them know if I needed any adjustments. If they indeed hold to this policy, that's pretty awesome. I'd forgotten to ask for a sugar or ice adjustment, but it tasted fine as it was, and I wasn't planning to linger.

The green tea and milk flavors were both easily distinguished, and the honey boba was indeed as hot as they warned me. They feel a little softer than other popular local shops' pearls (perhaps due to temperature), but they have the bite that you can and must expect. These pearls kinda remind me of No. 1 Boba Tea's, except that here they do have honey flavor and don't get overcooked. 

I didn't linger inside for long, but the seating area feels surprisingly roomy and is fairly inviting even if it's a little dark. The register and the window table made the ordering line a bit physically uncomfortable. They have a buy 10 get $3.66 off card, so pricing is very comparable to other places.

I'll be back to Tea Space soon to try more of their menu, and hopefully I'll remember to make adjustments. I've gotta try the sea salt cream (although one reviewer found it distasteful), the coffee, and some of the other tea flavors. This initial 4* rating is due for an upgrade if the adjustments are worthwhile and the quality stays consistent.

[QUICK UPDATE 6/8/16: Boba quality control tightened up. Tonight, it was very al dente, which I like. As for the longan fresh milk tea, I probably wouldn't have guessed longan for a while in a blind taste test. I guess they use canned or rehydrated diced pieces of the fruit, and perhaps the milk and honey (from the honey boba) obscured the flavor a bit.]",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,12,4,DNHM7V4L0n463bN1SGAEGA

This place was fantastic for a quick boba break after a big lunch. Like their name implies, this is a space to come in, relax, and drink (milk) tea. All of our beverages were made fresh and used natural ingredients, not flavored powder some other chain boba shops would use.

My Longan Milk Tea was great. When it was first brought out, you could see the different layers of foam, tea, and kelly. After a bit of mixing, the drink was ready to be consumed. I could actually taste the tea in my drink, so a big thumbs up to Tea Space for knowing how to do boba well. My friends' drinks were all fantastic as well. Beware, sweet means sweet, so don't be afraid to lower the sugar content if you'd like.

I also found it amusing how their stamp card offers $3.66 off a drink, instead of outwright receiving a free beverage. While most drinks are that price, be sure to bring loose change cause that tax can be unpredictable!

My favorites are their green teas and oolong teas. Peach mango oolong tea is delicious and not too sweet. Their dumplings are surprisingly good as well.

Heads up they also sell hot pot and brick toast. In case you may wonder, brick toast and honey toast are two different things. Brick honey toast is just the slice of bread versus the whole loaf of bread in a honey toast. Seats here are sparse ( still more seats than Kung fu tea thank goodness!) 

It gets a bit busier at night and there's hardly parking out in the lot so be aware as I've been here at 10 and they've run out of boba before...horrific I know! Also make sure to get a punch card.

I ordered the tasty grass drink which is ice blended milk with brown sugar, honey boba and grass jelly. I ordered it with half sugar but it was still very sweet will go less next time. The problem with the ice blended drinks is that all the sugar is on the bottom. You need to mix it and usually you just shake your boba upside down and let the syrupy goodness flow all over. However, this cup came with a lid and wasn't sealed so it was a bit hard to get the drink to taste evenly throughout. I was stirring with my straw. The boba was nice and chewy and the grass jelly was great. It's denser than most places which I like so you get huge chunks of it.

The winter melon smoothie is great for those who want the winter melon flavor without the caffeine. Personal preference, I like winter melon tea or milk teas, so I'll have to try those next time! The longan fresh milk had real bits of longan and it was not that sweet of a drink.  The Hokkaido smoothie tasted good, but it had a Hokkaido taste I was not familiar with.

I had been staring at their food menu for quite some time and decides to try it out with my boyfriend. We were not disappointed!

I'm a huge fan of takoyaki and this takoyaki is definitely high on my list of good takoyaki. The spicy dumpling soup was fantastic, too. The broth was really good with the chili oil, and the dumplings had a nice crunch from the veggies they had inside with the meat. My all time favorite thing though was the popcorn chicken rice. We had to ask them for it a second time because the first guy we ordered from never put our order in, but it was well worth the wait. We ordered it spicy and the chicken was delicious. The coating they had on it did not take away from the actual meat; I hate it when there's more breading than actual meat but they made this the right way! The rice had some meat and a little bit of sauce that had soaked into it and it was fantastic. They also had some corn, collard greens and cooked cabbage on the plate. I don't usually go for veggies, but whatever sauce they cooked the cabbage in made devour the whole thing. The drinks really hit the spot and came in these really nice looking containers. Our drinks stayed pretty cold, even as we were waiting on the popcorn chicken rice. 
The decor is pretty chic and the atmosphere is super chill. They also have artwork for purchase lined up on the walls which I really enjoyed.

We got an order of their popcorn chicken in medium spicy. I decided to go with their lychee black tea while my husband got their almond milk tea. I ordered my tea half sweet with less ice since I don't like my teas too sweet. The waiter warned me that since it's half sweet, it also means that it's half flavor. If I don't like how light it is, they can always add to it. 

But honestly, I don't think it would help for me to add sweetness to it because it'll just be a lychee drink. My drink tasted really watered down and had barely any tea flavor. It was quite disappointing. My husband's almond milk tea drink also tasted watered down. 

The popcorn chicken however was pretty good. A medium spicy may be a bit too spicy for people who can't eat too much spice. The pieces were pretty big too .. but my first bite was a piece of fat haha!

There was no one in there when I arrived so you can determine if that's a good or bad thing. 

The layout in there is pretty similar to Kung fu tea. You see the counter as soon as you walk in and to the left are some bench seats, chairs, and tables. The decor is pretty simple with a few pieces of art on the wall. 

I decided to go with the Hokkaido milk tea (3.66) with egg pudding (.50) and sea salt latte (.99) and they charge another .99 for it to be a ""regular"" size which is gigantic compared to other places. I would consider it an XL size. 

It pretty good, not too sweet but not watered down, and was made fairly quickly. I didn't get any boba this time so I can't provide any input on that. Maybe next time!

I ordered a small iced wintermelon green tea less sweetened, and a friend had the regular iced lavender green milk tea with boba. The wintermelon green tea was great, very refreshing. I'd say the lavender milk tea was a bit weak, a little too much milk and not enough of a lavender flavor. But on the plus side, the drink portions are plenty. If you are familiar with KFT, a small size here at Tea Space would be the same as a medium at Kung Fu, and a regular a large. Although having a large-sized regular is a good deal, the regular sized lavender milk tea wasn't cold enough because the ice would remain at the top of such a tall cup..
They have a stamp card for a free drink after ten. The staff is very friendly and service is good.

I also like how they have some board games for you and your friends to play with, making it a fun place to hang out at or even just study in. They also have a stamp card rewards system (buy 10 drinks, get $3.66 off your next one - basically a free regular size drink).

They currently have a seasonal rose boba as opposed to honey boba. Don't fret, they offer to let you try it prior to committing. When we tried it by itself, it tasted just like regular boba, just much less sweet. We still ended up ordering the boba.

The only thing I would recommend is, if you usually lessen the sweetness level, don't lessen it as much as you usually do. We got our drinks at 50% sweetness, but I felt like since the boba was not a sweet honey boba, the drink was actually not sweet enough for me.

We got their Hokkaido and Okinawa milk teas with boba and pudding. I actually like the Okinawa more than their Hokkaido. I felt like it had more flavor, but both are still really good. Their boba was really fresh, so it was soft and chewy - I actually prefer it a bit more firm, but that just means that it was fresh!

Overall, really great drinks, but a bit on the more expensive side? Our total for 2 larger sized drinks (32oz each I believe?) and a smaller size was $18, rounding out each drink to about $6.

I ordered the Okinawa coffee and Hokkaido milk tea with honey boba and taros (real taro chunks). They use Vietnamese coffee for their coffee products, so it's on the strong side. Good pick if you are a heavy caffeine consumer.
And the Hokkaido milk tea is to die for, definitely the best in town. It's smooth, creamy and rich on the flavor even I ordered it with no sugar. If you are a fan of Japanese milk candy, Hokkaido milk tea is a must try and will bring you to the sweet milky heaven.

It's hard to come across the perfect boba consistency and for ME personally they have the best. The size to price ratio is really awesome and I always get double boba. You can order ahead and come in and pick it up and they have great, friendly service. It's conveniently near my job and is open late. So many new boba shops keep popping out of no where but nothing else compares to their quality of work. They just opened and every time I go my drink is always perfectly made and delicious! Yay tea space, don't ever change!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,5,4,5,L2J9b6jFH0g7rlk4jGA8Zw

But it was very burn-your-irises-out-bright when I finally made my slight detour home after attending a funeral service for a chef that worked at Aria.

I was looking for a boba milk tea place on the east side, but nothing was close by or on the way home, and I finally decided to give Tea Space a try. The Wintermelon Fresh Milk Tea ????? caught my eye in one of the pictures, even though it was apparently a wrong order :p 

Anyway, Immediately upon entering, but way before my eyes could adjust to the indoor lighting of Tea Space, I could hear a friendly greeting from the cashier (Dora) and offering me one of their folded paper menu. I took a quick glance to check seating availability, and was mildly surprise that pretty much every table in this cozy space was occupied. I guess almost all the cars parked in the small parking lot belongs to someone working at or patronizing Tea Space. So I will not be doing any studying here. So plan B it is.

I ended up ordering, as you probably already guessed, their Wintermelon Fresh Milk Tea with Egg Pudding ($0.50 charge) and also upgraded to a ""regular"". For an extra $0.99 it was totally worth it to upgrade to their ""regular"", which is actually a ""large"" 32-oz portion everywhere else. The drink was prepared and ready in a matter of moments. It literally took me longer to snap a picture of my order, applied some quick edits to make it Instagram ready than it took them to make my drink. That is Jimmy Johns fast!

Dora told me that customers can customize their drink's sweetness level, which I thought was slightly on the sweet side for me, but it was no big deal. I actually finished it, except for a few stray egg pudding, before I completed my drive home. There was hardly any ice left too, so they are definitely not selling ice here (or not any more, since addressing the displeasure voiced in past reviews).

I am trying to cut back on sugary boba drinks, was doing a good job of it too, but yes I would be back to eventually fill up yet another stamp card.

My only question is, why are they closed so early?

4 stars. Friendly. Fast. Lots of cat art (which I did not get to personally admire today).",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,37,36,4,hCC7aEzBmysoynUf7UfsZg

Superb customer service.

Adorable kitty decor.

We will be back to try more! :)",cHr4S_PSpAWpLi8CWtLzrA,1,0,5,beIv96iNSmC69MMHimjE7w
5995144,2017-07-28,0,01VPJkcU0m8WzlA7dCEpVQ,"This is an decent tea spot if you already know what you're getting. For me, my favorite to get is the brown sugar milk tea with boba and egg pudding. And when I want something to snack, the popcorn chicken will satisfy the cravings. 

Now the reason why I gave this a three is because I'm not much of a fan of actual tea in my drink. I get it, they're trying to be authentic but I'm not used tot the overpowering after taste especially when it's coming from black tea. That's just my preference though. Also, I understand they make there taro milk tea out of real taro which is cool but I'm also not a fan of small little chunks in my drink. I wish they had an option to remove them completely. 

The popcorn chicken is just how I remembered it from the first time I ate them in Los Angeles. Now, the drawback is that they didn't have sweet and sour sauce. I've never really enjoyed such an appetizer without the latter so that was but interesting. Nonetheless, it was still really good. They offer ketchup if you're interested. 

This place could use a little more improvement but I come in once in a while because it's the closest decent boba I can get to on a short timeframe!",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,2,2,3,IwkACZQCtE1YpsoZuLLIVA
