404489,2017-12-27,0,zaxK3ea92mvEBRy-jttngg,"Overpriced junk, really.  We started with the house-made potato chips, advertised as ""with creole seasoning and smoked salt.""  There was zero sign of creole anything.  There was a hint of salt, nothing more.  For $6.99, this tiny basket of chips was embarrassing.  The chips themselves were okay, but wow they were overpriced and lacking ambition.  

I ordered a Brisket Melt, but modified it to be a brisket/smoked turkey melt.  I have to say, the *taste* of both the brisket and turkey were okay (nothing special, but decent), but they were both extremely dry.  Like, choke-on-your-dinner and do-not-attempt-without-water-nearby dry.  I am not sure if they just overcooked the bejeezus out of it or if it had been sitting out on the carving table for eons, but there was no sign of moisture in either meat.  For a BBQ place, that's a sin.  Then there's the ""melt"" portion...  Typically, ""melt"" indicates there's going to be some warm gooey cheese.  They got the cheese part mostly right (it was an unusually small square of the yellow stuff) but it appeared to be decent cheddar at least.  But it was slapped right on top, no ""melt"" anywhere to be found.  Two meals in a row in LV (separate places) where they apparently can't figure out how to melt cheese...  Very disappointing.  

Overall, my meal was pretty disgusting, because of how dry it was.  The entire thing (appetizer, entree, and cocktail) was WAY overpriced for the value.  I ate little of my entree.  This seems like the kind of place with the attitude, ""Well, they're only coming here once, we may as well get the most out of them.""  Very unfortunate.  

To their credit, the manager did cruise by and ask how everything was, to which I replied with most of the above...  He simply apologized.  He did take a little bit off of our bill to try to make up for it which was nice...  But I really wanted a mind-blowing BBQ experience, not an apology.

Great location. The décor is attractive and the environment spacious. Many of the tables are long, probably requiring smaller parties to share, but it was later in the evening and we got our own table.

As we'd arrived in Vegas that evening, we had booked for 10:30 - which was still an hour and a half before the restaurant closed. We were among the last parties, but the restaurant was still 1/2 full when we arrived and folks arrived after us.

Despite that, they were already out of ribs when we arrived. For a BBQ restaurant not to have ribs was a big disappointment - at least one of us, perhaps both, were planning to get this. 

We ended up having wings as an appetizer - they were ok but a bit more spicy than we wanted. (We normally enjoy 1-2 stars) They definitely had that attractive fall-off-the-bone quality. Our entrees were pulled pork and BBQ chicken. The pulled pork was quite good, but I didn't love the chicken. 

Contrary to at least some reviews here, the service was great - prompt, attentive, helpful, friendly. No issues there. 

Overall I would probably go back to try the ribs, my wife thinks nothing here was stand-out enough to return. However, I wouldn't go after 9pm, given the lack of choice later in the night.",gbswghwtXaqBcsjJ8lvB-Q,2,0,3,y41cvelbQCu8ycbtXITEsQ

This place is on the Promenade on the way to the High Roller.  It's a fake honkey tonk with cheap wooden tables and chairs.  They do live music around 9:00 pm which may be a plus for some folks, isn't for me.

When I go to a BBQ joint, it's about the 'Q!

This was a swing, and a bunt, but not quite a miss.  My lovely better half got the rib plate, and I got a combo(brisket and ribs), comes with two sides and a very moist and tasty cornbread....muffin I guess you would call it....I call it a cornbread disc.  The plates are about $25.00 which is not out of line at all.  My sides were beans and coleslaw.

The ribs were exceptional!  Memphis style dry rub(bit of coffee in there?), probably brined, but smokey, porky goodness.  On just the ribs, they are 5 stars...however....the brisket was a joke.  It's sliced by machine....no discernible bark, but yep, the smoke ring is there.  You know those roast beef cryo packs in the meat section where they keep corporate ""deli meats""? Bologna, ham, salami......??? Imagine smoked meat in one of those pre-pack cardboard hanging sections, and that is what this meat looked, smelled and tasted like....the brisket was a two star bordering on one star experience.

That said, gonna get to it:

Ambiance/Cleanliness-like I said, fake honkey tonk.....clean enough, if you like live music, that would be a plus for you.....3 stars

Service-It was good, but when our server asked how the food was, I went off on the brisket, and she froze up like a deer in the headlights.  Little training might be in order, probably would have opted for the chicken given an option to send that brisket back....3 stars

Food-wrote it up above, except to say that the sides were excellent.  There's meat in the beans and it benefits greatly from it, and the coleslaw was quite tasty as well.  Sauce was good, swear that there is some horseradish in there, I make a better sauce at home, though.....3 stars.

Cons:
I ordered the ""trash ribs"" and the name is accurate. They should be thrown away. They failed multiple basic rules of BBQ: get good meat, season it right, smoke it long enough, and have a tasty BBQ sauce. They couldn't hit any of these. You can tell the meat is poor quality, there was no seasoning on it, they didn't cook it long enough as it was tough, and they covered it in a sauce that was bland. I've never had a bland BBQ sauce until now. 

Pros:
The sides ROCK! I scraped the bowl of grits clean and could have eaten that alone for my meal. The Mac and cheese was very tasty and has a crunchy crumb top which complements the dish. The cornbread is addictive too. I want to try all the sides and I might just do that if I come back.

We got them as an app to split and I could have eaten them as an entree.  Fried pickles were good too.  The Mac n cheese for a side is great and they have baked crusted ruffles on top.  I got the brisket and it was some of the best brisket I've had.  Lastly hands down they have the best cornbread ever.  I could have eaten a dozen of them.  The only negative I have is the surfeit of food you get for portions.  We had so much left over we gave it to two homeless people on our walk and still felt stuffed.  If you plan to go drinking after definitely restrain yourself or eat earlier to have time to walk off on the strip.

We always stay close by and have been watching and waiting for this to open since we love BBQ. Alas what a disappointment. It's a nice clean space and at times they have live music. The servers are friendly and seem knowledgeable about the menu. Too bad the food didn't live up to the description.  My husband loves ribs so of course that was his choice.  The plates come with two sides so he chose slaw and baked beans. While you get a healthy portion of ribs, the sides are pretty darn small and they are the cheapest part of the meal. The slaw and beans were ok, the ribs he said and I tasted and agreed, were dry and tough.  I had fried catfish which came out looking amazing.  The fish was cooked properly but it was greasy when I cut into it. I ordered collard greens and cheese grits for my sides. I got a tiny portion of greens with bacon with no flavor and the grits were congealed on the plate. Two stars is probably generous",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,0,0,2,0eYguVqJv7La1LX3OfgQQA

My wife and daughter have been trying to cut back on meals while we were on vacation so they ordered a burger and fries. I was not so worried and ordered the fried chicken dinner. Courtney warned us it would take about 18 minutes to cook but i would rather wait and get fresh hot food. Happy I did. It is a half chicken (4 or 5 pieces) deep fried with a great batter. It have a little spice to it but great texture and flavor. 
I gave my wife one of the wings and my daughter a drumstick and it turned out with the burger they shared to be a full meal for us all. 
Really cool, it looks like they have live music every night (not sure call ahead but I think so). The guy when we were there had a guitar and was a mix of country/rock and took requests.

The barmaid a young blonde woman made the worst drink I have every had in my 59 years. I sent it back it was undrinkable it left a horrible taste in my mouth, and I can usually tolerate badly mixed drinks. With one hand on her hip she sarcastically asked me what did it need? I had no idea what to tell her other than learn how to mix a drink, but I did not want to be rude so I just told her it had a bad after taste and asked for a corona. She did not give back the difference in cost of the drink and was visible mad that I sent the drink back and told the other barmaid what happened. We wanted to stay and enjoy the music but with her nasty attitude we did not feel comfortable and left to go to another establishment with friendlier staff.  My advice if you are going to be a bartender you need to learn how to mix a drink and to take criticism. I could have been rude but was not and was stiffed the cost of 14 dollar drink for an 8 dollar beer because she was upset..Holy cow get over your attitude and learn to be a barmaid!",FwxwVAS_pKA-UZ5zQdSHQA,0,0,1,w9p5Wh-zFNfUg9vJzuk80g

Unfortunately my salad arrived as a plate of lettuce with avocado and dressing.  Someone in the kitchen had obviously forgotten to dress the salad.  I did receive the brisket however which was delicious.

Our server did not return in time so I ate the salad and advised her when she did return which was when the rest of us were nearly finished eating.

She said that she advised the ""salad guy"" of the error.  We were charged the full amount for the salad, and a manager did not visit our table.

3002282,2017-11-01,0,zaxK3ea92mvEBRy-jttngg,"Virgil's Real Barbecue is a newer BBQ restaurant located at the LINQ promenade in Las Vegas.    The decor is nice.  Wood paneling, hardwood tables, old school type fixtures.  They have a cool beer fridge upstairs adorned in a barrage of stickers from different breweries.  

We were staying at the LINQ hotel and relaxing at the pool and deciding what to have for lunch. 
 I noticed Virgil's has an entrance attached to the pool area and we were hungry so we decided to check it out.  There was a sign stating you could wear your swim suit in the main restaurant.  (Always be wary of places that let you wear your bathing suit in the restaurant.) We took the stairs down into the main restaurant and were seated at a table.  Our waitress was friendly and came back to check on us often.  The food kind of sucked though as described next.

I ordered the surf and turf, which gives you the choice of a meat (I went with brisket), and a skewer with 4 shrimp.  For my sides, I went with the cheesy grits and the mac and cheese.  My wife went with the pulled chicken dinner and for her sides she ordered the baked beans and also the mac and cheese.

The grits: over salty.  Didn't even resemble grits.  No texture.  Maybe overcooked?  I am by no means a grits expert, but they were damn salty.  Skip the grits. 

The mac n cheese.  Plasticy texture.  More gluey than creamy.  Could use a creamier base.  The flavor was sort of bland, could have used sharper cheese.  Pass on the mac.

The shrimp were of high quality, butterflied and good but were drenched in their overpowering BBQ sauce.  The delicate flavor of the shrimp was muted by the BBQ sauce. Would have been much better sans sauce.

The BBQ sauce.  They had one type of BBQ sauce at the table which is kind of unusual for a BBQ joint.  The one sauce they had came in what looked like a factory produced jar, labeled ""Virgil's authentic BBQ sauce"".  Looks like you could find it at the grocery store.  It was overly sweet and tangy.  A little too intense in the sweetness range for me.

Brisket was alright. Portion size was average. Served on a thick slice of white bread.  A little salty but it was pretty good.

The dinner plate had a stack of fresh onions topped with a pickle.  The pickle was limp and warm.  Looks like it had been vaporized by a heat lamp.

My wife's dinner, the pulled chicken.  A large portion of pulled chicken, slathered in BBQ sauce, over a piece of white bread.  She wasn't a fan of her pulled chicken.  I tried some.  It was a little dry and bland.  It had a grainy sort of texture to it.  We barely ate any of it.  Don't order the pulled chicken.

She said her side of baked beans was the best part of her meal.  She was also not happy about her mac and cheese.

Overall, the venue is nice and clean.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was overpriced and sub-average.  If you are in Las Vegas and looking for BBQ food, I suggest you go else where.",ptELJaRmNK8ej8YwL7Bdjw,0,0,2,UoKajfNPOw1ktFxG8M7y0g

Food gets 4+ stars. 
Definitely come here for the food. I mean it. The food is really good.
The Memphis ribs are to die for. The Collard greens, and Mac n cheese are awesome. The beans and cole slaw are also good, but come in (4oz?) ramekins and were not even full. Kind of a joke when they give generous portions on the plate of the first mentioned sides. 
The wings on Sunday were plump, juicy, and beautiful. The wings today were small and dried out. I sent them back and they replaced them with wings as they should be. Shame on you Virgil's for even sending out old BBQ. 
Service needs work. On both occasions it took over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. It then took another 5+ just to get beverages. Refills were either non-existent (Sunday), or when the glass was empty. You are serving tea in pint glasses. The tea is room temp and the glass is full of ice. 4 sips and its gonna be empty. Refilling the same glass is not gonna cut it if you are not going to pack it with ice again. Warm Iced tea sucks. No lemon wedges? Bigger glasses for tea, or better server awareness for refills is needed. When they would ask for a refill they would not scan the whole table for other empty glasses. This is multitasking 101. Server on both occasions was not around when you needed them. Surprising, since the service at Carmine's is so good. Neither server asked if we wanted dessert. I wanted it, but did not feel like waiting another 30 minutes to get out of there. We got hot towels on Sunday, and none today. 
I checked in using open table on both occasions. Sunday I got the credit for, today, I got an email that my reservation was cancelled? 
Came with a 3 year old both times, had to ask for a kid's menu after being seated both times. 
I hope management reads these reviews. Work needs to be done for the sake of better more efficient service. 
If you are looking for great BBQ, definitely try Virgil's. You may have to be more than patient with the service, but that can be corrected with proper training. We shall return.",lhPuskGXTRSjCwKOOOYeoA,0,0,3,IQPOCL4nLlb2h9YT0SEwDA

We visited vegas for NYE 2018 and between the crowds, street blockages, and empty stomachs the night escalated quickly to become a stressful situation. Lines were everywhere, even for the little kiosks and food trucks. 

By the end we decided to hit the linq of the strip and see what we could find, and fortunately we found virgil's. Living in Texas for a couple of years, you learn a thin or two about BBQ and smoking. 

We started with the fried sweet pickles. I must say I wasn't thrilled as they were a little too sweet for my taste and in some of them the taste of nutmeg and cinnamon was a little overwhelming. Also, was disappointed that no ranch was served with them.  These were quickly fixed. Our server was so friendly and diligent, she brought us ranch right away even when even she was so busy, we were impressed. Even the male host (maybe manager) was quick to act when it wasn't his job. I can't say the same thing for tall blond female hostess. She was so unfriendly and pressed, bless her heart,ignoring us deliberately and turning faces. If she was the only person I'd had to deal with, virgil's would've been a total Fiasco.

On to the entrees...THE FOOD WAS GREAT! we ordered two combos, both with brisket. The cook and smoke was impressive, it wasn't fatty but not dry either. The home made bbq sauce was sweet with some heat, and the toast didn't become soggy.  The chicken entrees were equally good, with the bbq chicken being my favorite. It was perfectly smoked, crispy skin, and deep flavor profiles. The sides were mac and cheese and potato salad. I f I had to choose one, I would go with the Mac and Cheese. The potato salad was good, but it wasnt stellar, tasted store bought.",YStOmcePtUCInzYqzDl1eA,0,0,4,TC4qVPdnvP46hzg-TzPmnw

We ordered the pick two combo which came with corn bread and two sides. The first combo had pulled pork and the pork ribs with mashed potatoes and gravy and beans.

The mashed potatoes weren't tasty at all the beans were too sweet. 

For the second combo, we had the tritip and the pork ribs. We also had mac & cheese for the side.  The tritip was juicy and tender but of course the pork ribs were not.

As we were walking through we decided to eat at Virgils because it smelled amazing and my son loves BBQ. We went inside and was greeted by our host (forgot her name) who got us seated quickly since it was pretty dead inside. As we were sitting near the server station we over heard a server asking a question to David (got his name from the hostess) and the way he replied back to this girl baffled me. The way he answered her was just unnecessary and very condescending! The girl looked like she wanted to tear up and cry and I commend her for just bitting her tongue and walking away. As for David here's some advice for you.. just because you're a manager doesn't make you better or give you the right to speak to your employees in the way you did. Learn some manners and treat them with respect because without them you wouldn't be able to run your establishment!

OUR SERVER (Didi) WAS INCREDIBLE.  It was our first time there and she was so pleasant and helpful.  She checked on us regularly and we even enjoyed a couple short conversations with her.  She called us by our first names and what impressed me more about her was her drive and passion for Virgil's.

Overall, Virgil's is terrific.

The service started really courteous, warm welcome, to a busy spot, the host (I guess was the manager) very polite inviting us in and letting us know the specials of the evening and assigning a server to our table. The server was more a rebuttal kind of person, to me its a more memorized pitch for customers. He rattled all the menu items and finally, after about 10 mins stopped. Whew

There are good beers on tap, good selection mostly international - we ordered Stella Artois and it was served really chilled - which is great. For dinner we has the pulled BBQ Chicken and my associate ordered the spare ribs. The quality is massive, one helping is good for two people, unless you are really big eater. The pulled chicken was OK - no really smoked BBQ flavor more a flat top grilled meat. It was not bad, but I expected more. My associate was disappointed with his meal as he kept comparing it their other outlets and his hometown - Austin TX.

Friday evening, my family and I were thoroughly enjoying the Promenade when the delicious smell is smoked ribs wafted through the air. The smell was so thick and tantalizing, we had to stop in. 
We were seated immediately near a window, my preference, upon entry. Our waitress came over in a timely manner, albeit very rushed. She skipped the pleasantries altogether and got right to business taking our orders. Since Vegas is not known for ribs, we decided to share two menu items, what a great decision that turned out to be. We ordered the slab rib dinner and the multi meat nachos(pulled chicken, pulled pork, cubed brisket). Once our plates arrived we were darn near salivating they looked beautiful, excellent presentation -- that's when all Hell broke loose. 
The slab was 4 bones, we inquired with the waitress thinking a simple mistake had been made. Apparently, a slab is by the pound for their establishment - I've lived long enough to know that if you offer me a slab of ribs at $25, I expect more than four bones or you have some explaining to do. The waitress brought another bone out to meet our satisfaction, turns out that would be to my chagrin later. 
As we bit into the first bite, our mouths suffered complete and utter devastation! This, per the pound, 4-5 bone slab was all fat, like gristly, greasy, seasoned fat! We needed a search light to find any meat. Alright, major disappointment, but we still have the nachos, we gleefully take a chip, again devastating results, the sauce they use(the ribs arrive sans any sauce) is a mix of ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, all unmarried to each other - leaving the weirdest after taste in your mouth. We shrug it off, who really buys ribs in Vegas heat anyway, we are Vegas vets who made a rookie mistake, chalk it up to a learned lesson and move on. 
Only if it had ended there, 2 hours later, we found ourselves making a Usain Bolt like sprint to any available restroom. We were all trapped, due to obvious reasons for at least 15 mins, we finally make it back to our hotel room, where we are forced to stay for the remainder of the evening and part of the next morning. So, do what you feel best, but this is what happened to me. I wish them well and I hope they work the kinks out. This place has great potential.",Cn3pKcYrMX3rOp01eG3WJw,2,0,2,yVNepHLmSWzxcz34eyNG5Q

They serve up the entire chicken wing not just the drumette or wingette, or tip.  Very impressive.  That's how it should be dammit.  The wings were full of flavor and smoked to perfection.

Maybe it was my fault for ordering the crab cakes from a BBQ place, but it was the only menu option besides a salad that wasn't going to be too heavy, considering I just had to try the Mac n cheese & cornbread.  The only salad that looked remotely appealing to me was the same exact salad I had had for lunch, hence my order of the crab cakes, with Mac n cheese, collards greens, & corn bread.  However, there was only ONE crab cake, but it was a decent size. It wasn't dry as I had expected it to be, but that's about all I can say about it. It lacked flavor and texture.  The Mac n cheese was yuck: undercooked pasta and somewhat dry, tangy kind of cheesy. The collard greens were mostly rib and again, undercooked, lacking flavor. The cornbread was more of a mini puck size quiche-looking flat muffin; it was moist but again flavorless. My entire meal was disappointingly a waste of a money, as well those of the others in my group.  Fast food anywhere would've been more satisfying, unfortunately.

My biggest complaint about this place: my utensils were not clean - GROSS!  It wasn't until I unwrapped the 4th place serving that I found a clean fork & knife, and then cleaned it thoroughly with a lemon anyway.

Service was fine. seated on the patio, it was great for people watching but the music was like being in a night club (ridiculously loud), yet the weirdest not complimentary mix of different genres of music.

I asked our waitress what does she recommend so she said the chicken fried steak. I was torn between that and the brisket melt. Oh, if you have hard time making a decision items marked ""Virgil's favorites"" are items that are most popular. 

We ordered the nacho's for an appetizer which was so good! Then i ordered the chicken fried steak which is breaded with saltine crackers , corn flakes and something else i can't remember. I had it with mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. The serving sizes are huge and she lived up to her recommendation! Everything was soooo good! It was also happy hour when we went and i had a spike strawberry lemonade. I would highly recommend this place and the chicken fried steak.

It was decently busy, however we were seated within 5 minutes of getting to the hostess stand. That is about the only plus of the evening, unfortunately. The gentleman that waited on us, he seemed to be quite frazzled. A busy night waiting tables can do that to you, I understand I've been there. But, his inattention and lack of service was a major disappointment in our experience. After our initial drink request, it took him another 15 minutes to come back and take our actual food order.  It took another 10 plus minutes for him to come back and tell us that the hush puppy machine had broken. Which is unfortunate, however there is more than one way to make a hush puppy. Once we finally did get our order, our order was lukewarm at best. I ordered the Carolina BBQ, which wasn't traditional as Carolina BBQ is vinegar based. And neither was the Cole slaw, so if you're going to advertise something as Carolina based make sure it is accurate to the region. 
And my wife ordered a salad, and it's hard to mess up a salad. Virgil's can though, as the lettuce was brown and the salad was warm as if it had been under a heat lamp and took 45 minutes to get. 
And the ambience, was horrible. They had a singer who made every song she sung sound like Four Non Blondes, what's going on. It was hard to make Paradise City sound like that, however she accomplished it much to our dismay. 

We definitely won't be going back, and won't recommend Virgil's to any of our friends visiting Vegas.",GZIjnqSq-w1f2lEsq2ut9Q,0,0,1,t3oCOylZWjvOu67sg_jKNA

Second day in Vegas for a late lunch, my party and I walked in, the hostess asked if we'd like a seating outside or inside. The outside has misters so you're not completely sweltering, and there's AC going inside. We choose to sit inside and looked over the menu. We had a slight idea of what to order because we had researched the menu online before arriving. The prices were what you'd expect a BBQ place would be, i.e. a choose two combo is 25-ish dollars, which comes with two sides and a corn bread. 
Our waiter walked us through what Virgil's is about, being smoked/BBQ'd right in restaurant, etc. Our party asked her suggestions, and were given popular choices and their favorite. We also had a few questions about differences between two similar items and their helped that way. We ordered and we did not have to wait long. Considered we came in as a late lunch about 2-3 PM, there wasn't many people there. Our platter came altogether the two choices, two sides and cornbread. All amazing!! Our waiter reminded us that there's additional BBQ sauce, and ask if we needed anything else. They were very helpful, not so much on the conversing side but they're working, I understand that. 
Was given a refill on my drink, as I was just finishing my first round. 
The ambiance was calm but considering the time of day... we did not run into any problems during our visit to Virgil's Real Barbecue restaurant.

Well, our group of 6 started with probably a bit too much to drink - with a large (very large) jug of a cocktail. I think we ended up getting the punch, but to be honest, I dont even remember. I do remember us trying to get a different drink but it being like almost $100 since we decided we didn't want the type of alcohol it originally was showing and wanted something a little more classy, but ended up with the punch.

(Nearly) Everything went wrong.  Granted that the restaurant is new, it still didn't explain the horrendous lack of service from the wait staff to management.  

Half of our party was dissatisfied with the food ordered.  For one, it took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive with not one explanation or check in from our waitress.  The Cobb salad was drenched in a very strong vinaigrette dressing that overpowered the plentiful ingredients.  The burger came dry with no accompanying sauce.  After repeated requests for some dressing we finally got a plate of mayo, ranch, and Caesar dressings.   But after 10 minutes, of course the burger had gone cold and tasteless.   The pulled chicken sandwich was unmemorable.   

The waitress was unsympathetic and only commented that the manager was aware, yet the manager never came to check in and have a better understanding of what was unsatisfactory.  Instead if anyone was helpful it was actually the sweet hostess who attempted to offer apologies.

The ribs were big and beefy, the chicken had a rub that was ridiculously delicious, and the pulled pork and beef brisket were some of the best I've ever had.

The potato salad was mustard based (personal taste preference again) but the potatoes were unpeeled and very hard. The coleslaw was blended into pieces smaller than a grain of rice. The mac n cheese was very inconsistent texturally, some pieces were hard and crunchy while others were mush. It was also luke warm when brought to us. I did not like the flavor of that either. The cheesy grits were also not cooked properly. The only thing i actually liked was the meat. It seemed like all of the side dishes were just leftovers that had been heated up in the microwave. 

Also, our server was not friendly, rushed away as soon as one of us stopped talking for a millisecond so we could not ask any questions, and wouldn't come closer to me when i was ordering so i had to shout my order across a long table over all of the music playing. I was not a good experience for me at all but some may contribute to personal preference, but i did not find this to be real bbq.",Pn5X2zHi7gULox5LeJ4FYQ,0,0,3,0EPhYN6W_O_b7LL-vgRltg

We had the large platter that seemed to include all the meats on the menu.  Everything was superb.  Tasty and moist.  I have eaten BBQ all around the USA and this was the finest that I have had.
The server was very polite and helpful.  We didn't wait for anything, she was there already.
We didn't stuff ourselves, saving room for desert.  Glad that we did, desert was every bit as good as the food.  
I highly recommend Virgils for folks living and visiting in Las Vegas, NV.   It is located off of the strip, near the Linq.  Plenty of wonderful shops in the area, in addition to the High Roller.
The man a the next table ordered a Bloody Mary, that looks like it could be a meal on it's own.  I will have one next time.  I also saw a side of onion rings that looked terrific.  I will try them in the future.

Ordered the BBQ nachos, which were advertised as ""Carolina pulled pork, pulled chicken and texas beef brisket; all in a mild BBQ sauce covered with jalapenos, cheddar and jack cheeses,"" and it was a disaster.

1. Pulled chicken was completely absent from the dish
2. There were literally 2 pieces of brisket in the entire order
3. The sticky, cloyingly sweet BBQ sauce completely overpowered the flavor of the pork. 

Everybody knows that good BBQ doesn't need sauce, and they threw so much on here that it was impossible to discern any smoke flavor in the pork. I'm sure it was there, somewhere, under all that diabetes.

The best thing about these nachos? The house-pickled jalapenos, which had more bite and more spice than the stuff you get out of a jar. 

But when the best thing about an order of nachos is the jalapenos, that's pretty sad.

(I won't even get into the awful cover band that mashed up the Beatles with Tupac Shakur.)

Take the extra $10 that you'd get charged for bad BBQ at this tourist trap and get an Uber to Rollin' Smoke instead.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,2,kf_WCHbkpZM2N61AD24bsQ

On a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was packed but we got seated immediately.  Our server, John, was nice, but that's about it.  We ordered the BBQ chicken platter and ribs combo and a BBQ salad.  I was actually craving for fried chicken and John was sweet enough to get permission from the kitchen to substitute the BBQ chicken with fried chicken with no extra charge.  I was really (and I mean REALLY) excited to enjoy our meal BUT was utterly disappointed when I took a bite of the salty (YUCK!) chicken.  John came back to check on us and I informed him that the chicken was REALLY salty to the point that I drank a whole glass of my water and asked for a refill.  John's response was, ""I'll let the kitchen know but we brine our chicken overnight -- so it is what it is.""   Ummm... I've had a lot of fried chicken that's brine but hellooo.... I still would like to taste the chicken and not eat salt for lunch. (Note:  the size of the chicken is tiny... so maybe they need to take that into consideration when they brine the chicken overnight.  Just saying....)  :-(    

The ribs were on the salty side too -- and nothing to rave about.  Thank goodness, they didn't add salt to our salad.  Sadly -- I'm still drinking water to quench my thirst as I type this review.

While I appreciated there was both indoor and outdoor seating along with nice staff...the food was terribly lacking. 
First, I came in here because a chalk board post noted it was happy hour. Sadly the staff could barely list what was on happy hour and noted the HH menus no longer existed...ooook. I ordered the Virgil's beer since it was one of the few on HH. It was so-so. Tasted mostly like Coors light. I should have stopped there since there was no food on happy hour but I was starving and ordered a pulled pork sandwich. 

What came out was a soggy sammy and semi-cold fries. The flavor of the BBQ was alright but there was hardly any slaw on the sandwhich and was hard to eat considering the soggy mess. I would be hesitant to order again. Their larger platters of BBQ looked slightly better but alas being as I was by myself it did not constitute ordering that much food.

Tri tip was good.  Pork ribs with dry rub were good but really salty.  They also have a version smothered in BBQ sauce.  Highly recommend the mac 'n cheese. Collard greens were so so.  About $60 per person if you get a drink and the two meat combo. Note that this meal is probably enough for two normal people to share. 

Appended review 4/23/18
Went back to Virgil's this past Vegas trip. This time I liked it better. Instead of ribs and meat slices I had the tri-tip melt. Very good. Very decent portion for the price.  Waiter was very courteous and prompt.  They also had live music which was a nice touch though a bit loud if you're trying to have dinner conversation. The location is also great, right in between the Linq (where I stayed) and the Flamingo.  Lastly, this time I bought a discount card from Tix4Less which took 20% off the bill. How can you go wrong?

From reading the previous reviews they must have upped their service because it was pretty good.  But having only three tables to wait on could have contributed to this.  So I ordered a Brisket Melt and the wife ordered a combo with ribs and pulled pork, we also ordered the trainwreck fries.  

Trainwreck Fries made their way out first and were pretty good.  We kind of wished they put the ranch on the side instead of mixing it in.  So the main dishes come out and although I should have asked but the Brisket Melt has onions on it when the menu has no mention of it at all.  So after picking out the onions the next thing I noticed was the lack of the ""melt"" part, there was cheese in there but it looked like the thinnest slices of cheddar in the world.  Basically my sandwich was a brisket onion sandwich....thumbs down.  The wife's combo plate wasn't that much better.  The ribs and pulled pork had so much fat in it that there was barely any meat.  Maybe it was an off day or something but the food was just terrible.  Before getting here we jokingly said ""Lets go to Haute Doggery...lol!"" but jokes on us cause it probably would have been better.

This new restaurant located at the Linq is owned by the same people who own Carmine's.",8L5IMDJX-oolsVHpXXlVbQ,3,4,4,cw-Z2UyQ82rdzEuTGarGlg

I had the Memphis Ribs with mac & cheese and beans. I would have that meal again in a heartbeat. Awesome!  My wife had the chicken wings and the fried pickles - she really enjoyed both. The wings were a little hotter than she expected - but tasted great!

The greeter was pleasant and our server was attentive and upbeat. 

A caution that the portion sizes are huge. Great food - just felt bad I couldn't finish it all. 

A definite reco!",VJqAZzTl5TNGg3vXtqJ_YA,0,0,4,eSOMJlzrSYiYygu2Q2Goww
