420639,2017-04-08,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"***DO NOT COME HERE. IT'S NOT SANITARY***

I hate writing bad reviews but this one was a must. Found this place on Yelp and wanted a change from the food on the Strip. First of all, parking was terrible. It's in a little strip mall with limited parking as all the competing storefronts were vying for the same spots. When we walked up to the restaurant, we weren't sure if it was even opened because the storefront was so dark. Upon entering, it didn't look too busy and we were quickly seated in the booth. 

Let me start of with I love izakayas. I've been to many in New York City and always had wonderful experiences. Japanese tapas-styled restaurants that let you try a little bit of everything and provides for a casual and comfortable dining experience, what more can you want? Having said that, I really wanted to like this place due to all the glowing reviews it had.

The menu was very vast as expected with a regular menu and a board with the specials for the day. I came with my family so we for our appetizers, we ordered a rainbow roll, a salmon avocado (Alaskan) roll, sashimi platter (3 kinds of fish), takoyaki, and beef tataki to be split amongst the four of us. For entrees, we got the shoyu ramen, kake udon, and yakisoba, and poke salad. 

The octopus in the takoyaki was a little cold but nonetheless it wasn't bad. The batter was nice and light and the sauce and dried bonito shavings were good. None of the fish for the sushi and the sashimi seemed fresh at all. The beef tataki was forgettable. Now onto the entrees, the portion sizes seemed a little smaller than I'm used to but that's fine because we did have a lot of appetizers to fill our bellys. The broth was ok but wasn't super rich with flavor. A little on the bland side. But right as my mom started eating her kake udon, she but into something crunchy in the spinach. She split it out to see what it was and it was a aphid in her spinach! She didn't want to make a scene so she just pushed it away and stopped eating it. But one of the employees came and wanted to see what was going on. We told them what happened and showed them the bug and they just stood there staring back at us. Then the waiter brought over another waiter to examine and they both stood there as if they were unsure of what they are looking at and walked away. Even if you aren't sure, good customer service is to try to correct your mistake. Not that we wanted it but to offer to make my mom a new one or take it off our bill would be the right thing to do! It's the thought that counts instead of standing there gawking at us and not doing anything. It just ruined the meal. Even with the terrible service, we still decided to give the 15% standard tip, which I believe they definitely did not deserve. I know how hard it is for waiters to earn money but still their behavior was unacceptable. 

Food was less than great here but still it didn't warrant a one star rating until my mom found that bug in her food. If there was better customer service to fix the situation than that would have helped but the service here is inexcusable. They need to clean their vegetables better. If my mom found this, I wonder how many other things they have done that were unsanitary that went unnoticed. AGAIN I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE. I don't understand how it got such a high rating.",by-tJ56fIfWjTJFivDxkAg,1,0,1,nJuCRn6euj_rxtvhZT22SQ

472347,2014-12-31,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Just found my new favorite Japanese restaurant!

In Vegas there's so many  so called Japanese restaurants and their main attraction is sushi, not Izakaya Go. There's so much selection, that I'll definitely be going back and back again to try them all! 

Salmon and Tuna Sashimi: One word. FRESH! Presentation is on point too.

Kara Age: fried chicken here is delicious! Cooked perfectly.

White fish tempura: Japanese friend of mine recommended it to me. If I was by myself I would have never ordered it. So good, the fish is so light and fluffy. My favorite so far.

Beef carpaccio: it is slightly cooked, not entirely raw. This too is delicious, the slight crunch gives it so much texture that you have to have more.

Enoki with butter: another dish that was recommended to me by my friend. And am glad I tried it. I've never had enoki before, it does have the mushroom consistency we all know, but it is a bit chewier than I expected. The richness of the butter and the chewiness of the enoki go hand in hand.

Yaki Soba: by the time the dish came I was so full from all the rest! The noodles were cooked great, and has nice flavors.

Black sesame mochi: I've never had black sesame flavored mochi before and had to try. It was delicious! It was sweet with little sesame seeds inside. I loved it.

Presentation: all the foods are pretty to look at. The beef carpaccio looked like a work of art! The chef makes sure it looks good, as well as taste good.

Service: service is excellent. If one of my waitresses was busy with someone, another waitress made sure we were ok. Drinks were constantly refilled, and our waitress' sometimes stayed and chit chatted. 

Chef: I spoke with the owner and he said their chef has 10 years experience in Kyoto! This food here is as authentic as they come!",-zrwxAG8MEv5ZoouxM_PAQ,1,1,5,pJVcKmbFzwN7Lg0wG4rteA

531188,2015-02-13,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"More times than I can count, I have refrained from writing a review about a new restaurant.  I have friends in the food industry & know just how much hard work the owners, managers, and staff put in, not to mention the huge financial investment.  But after reading John Curtas's multiple articles singing the praises of Izakaya Go, I don't feel bad about writing a bad review.  After all, Eating Las Vegas has, by orders of magnitude, a lot more juice in this town than one little old Yelper.  So, in an attempt to add an eensy weensy bit of balance ...

I had such high hopes after reading how great this place was on Eating LV.  I love Japanese food, and I-Go had some very interesting menu items you don't see elsewhere.  After I put in my initial order for crispy pork belly and uni dumplings, the server asked if I had been to the restaurant before because I knew what the best items were.  Oh boy, this should be good!  Except it wasn't.  The uni dumplings didn't taste like uni, or much like anything really.  You could see little specks of uni mixed in with a lot of white flavorless filler in the dumplings.  I tried adding a little soy sauce, then some spicy mustard, hoping to get a flavor boost, but nada.  The crispy pork belly was just not good, not awful, but nothing I would ever order again.  It also suffered from ""seasoning glop,"" that is, the kitchen seemed to like adding a big glop of salt & pepper on most of the dishes right before sending them out.  I'd prefer that the seasoning be cooked in instead of glopped on top.  Then I got the ""house specialty,"" kara age (fried boneless chicken thighs).  Even though it was the house specialty, I've had far better kara age elsewhere (Yonaka and Izakaya Cocokala spring to mind), plus there was that annoying glop of salt & pepper again.  Now my favorite, unagi.  I love freshwater eel, and not that many places serve it as a main course, usually just as sushi.  The serving of eel was a very thin fillet, and the delicate sweetness of the eel was spoiled by - you guessed it - a big glop of salt & pepper.  The only really good part of the meal was dessert, a $2.50 bowl of pretty good vanilla ice cream with two decent-sized scoops.

I don't know why there was such a big difference in my experience at Izakaya Go and John Curtas's multiple visits.  All I can guess is that maybe the head chef prepared everything when EatingLV dined whereas my meal was prepared by some staffers who don't quite yet have the hang of it (the place hasn't been open long).  Who knows?  Anyway, there are several Izakayas in Las Vegas, with new ones seeming to pop up all the time.  I won't be returning to Izakaya Go.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,4,0,2,Y2iuUXDDX_P2tHGRpenOzw

The food here is DELICIOUS and their seafood is FRESH. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Their service is superb. She recommended a sake drink, my friend and I couldn't be happier on agreeing w her. I really like their uni pasta. They are not cheap on their uni. You see the uni everywhere in the pasta. We also ordered some sort of fish sashimi and it wasn't bad ! I hate the fishy smell, but it sure didn't have any fishy smell.

Smaller venue compares to some others, but it gives you almost better service in a way because it's easier to manage.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  The robata items are flavorful.  The menus are very extensive... it's a bit overwhelming at times because they literally give you like 4 or 5 menus with daily specials, special seafood, menus after menus.  Most of the things I have there are good.  The only thing I am sad that they've taken off the menu was the white fish tempura.  I think it'a halibut they used and wrapped in shiso leaves with the light tempura batter... too bad it's no longer the menu.  Their ikamaru (grilled whole squid) is not my favorite item from there.  Seemed like they poached the squid first then grilled it..or something, the texture isn't as bouncy as it should be.. or maybe just frozen squid and thawed out.. something isn't that right.  But other items are all very solid.  I wouldn't go for sushi burrito there either... 

Even with a few minor things I don't particularly like there, still my go to izakaya place and easy access in the complex.  Highly recommend this place.  The chicken wings, the chilean sea bass, the beef, hokkaido scallops are my favorite skewers there.  

They do have one big tatami table for larger group party.",bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,0,0,5,pJnxYxKUPxUFayo_lytCFw

What wasn't didn't taste great were the uni dumplings (a weird paste filling), and pretty much all the yakitori.  All the yakitori needed salt, and all needed a bit more char.   The menu is huge, so maybe we ordered the wrong things, I'd like to think if we gave it another shot, it might be better.

They are basically a neo American Japanese fusion place local influences of Mexican and Korean cuisine as well. It is quite well thought out and they have an amazing bar and selection of sake. My main complain is the portion size here is ridiculously small!! It is ""tapas"" style jap dishes almost and number of dishes such as their grilled fish does not even come with anything else like a bowl of rice or soup.

1057575,2017-02-15,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"I thought I was making reservations for a different restaurant and completely stumbled on Izakaya Go (IG). The cooked dishes were a tasty surprise. While I will avoid the sushi and sashimi in the future, I will definitely add this place to my rotation.

HOT DISHES
Gindara (black cod)
Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar)
Spinach with garlic
Asparagus with bacon
Agedashi Tofu
Onigiri (with bonito flakes)

Cold Dishes
Halibut sashimi
Tuna sashimi
Mochi

I can't say how authentic the asparagus and spinach are, but I can say that they are seasoned well, greasy (in the best way), and delicious. The hamachi Kama was the standout dish of the meal. So often I've ordered this dish from other establishemnts and found the fish collar is overcooked, not properly crisped, or the piece of fish is naturally thin and lacking in enough fat or flavor. The collar here was thick and cooked very well. it's such a simple and comforting dish that I cannot help but base my impression largely on my experience with this piece of fish. I am always seeking a good piece of fish treated well.

We raved about our hot dishes, but the table was silent when we ate the sashimi. The tuna pieces were cut way too thick and there was chewy/difficult gristle in each piece that made for an unappetizing bite. Since the raw fish was only a small portion of our meal, it did not sully our experience. 

In total, I had ZERO expectations when we walked in the door. And I left pleased with the service and each of the cooked dishes. I really like this place--its vibe, the hot dishes, and the location. While I hit some bumps in my meal, there is so much more on the menu I want to try.

I was actually drawn to this spot because of their sea urchin pasta dish, and wow, it was bomb. Creamy with a hint of the uni in each bite and a hint of saltiness from the shiso leaves and white sauce. The Alfredo pasta was on point. Can't wait to come back the next time we're in Vegas. Lastly, staff was super courteous and friendly. Home run stop to eat at.",nCSncixYE5-OMdsAKydMzw,0,0,5,uXVJutfVTP1iRz5rRLTXBw

First off the staff at this location are incredible and provide excellent customer service. 

Now on to what you really came to read about and that's the food. Izakaya Go is REAL Japanese food not AYCE sushi ran by non-Japanese workers. I recommend going during Happy Hour (10-close) not only are drink prices great but you can try a wide assortment of their normal menu items for a fraction of the cost.

First we walked in and saw only Japanese people in the restaurant. We are the only non Japanese in the place. After seeing that we initially thought this must be a great Japanese restaurant. We sat down and saw grilled squid on the table right next to us and they said it is really good especially when it's a bit burned. Lo and behold we ordered that and mentioned to be a bit burned. Came out and it's so delicious! We got the Omakase as well and its also delicious. However we ordered the uni pasta and we were surprised as it was not the same as the one we saw in the pictures. The pasta is so creamy and yes delicious so if you are on a diet this dish is not the choice. We just want to try it and taste what an uni pasta taste like.... it's  delicious. Try it.

In fact, everything here is quite decently priced, especially for the great quality of the food.

We started off with drinks--my friend ordered a glass of draft Sapporo, and I ordered a two-shot chuhai cocktail...and mine was only $6!!

Next we decided to try an appetizer we've never had before, and the first of those on the list was the Yamasen. The server asked us if we were sure we wanted it, and at first we were a little insulted because we thought it was just because we are white.

Turns out that yamasen is...unique. If you've never had it before, it's basically shreds of yam and nori in this cold, salty, thick, mucous-y liquid. I don't know the technical terms, but if that doesn't sound appealing to you, do NOT order it. I could only have a few bites, but my friend liked it so she drank the rest.

My friend ordered the spicy shoyu ramen, and I ordered the miso ramen with less spice. All of their ramen options offer custom spice levels, so that's a bonus for both those who like it extra hot, and those who do not! The miso broth was rich and tasty, the egg was cooked the way I like, but I wish the noodles were thicker. Overall, a great bowl of ramen. My friend loved hers, too.

Two words : Japanese Tapas!
I absolutely love small plates because you get to try many different things on the menu without being fully committed to a full, big dish! 

Pretty reasonable prices for items. Some dishes, I'll admit, are pretty pricey, buuuut that's what Happy Hour is for!

Dishes are cooked right, seasoned right, and freshness is there!

*Crispy Pork Belly
*Kimchi Pork Belly with Poached Egg
*Truffle Buttered Corn
*Truffle Edamame
*Chicken Potstickers

*Shio Ramen (Half Order is the perfect size for me!)
*Miso Eggplant
*Yakisoba
*Curry Soba
*Asparagus Bacon Skewer
*Grilled Zucchini Skewer
*Pork Belly Skewer

*Spiked Calpico
*Ikezo - Jelly Sparkling Sake
*Kikusui Junmai Ginjo - Cold Sake (best one I've had so far!) - $20
*Orion
*Strawberry Nigori - Creamy Sake

1661930,2015-01-04,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Izakaya Go was a huge let down.  I went for lunch the opening week and got the salmon teriyaki lunch.  It came with your standard miso soup, salad, rice, soft tofu, and creamy potato side dish.  The food itself was good and what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant, but the long wait killed it... not on it's own.  The long wait to order, to get tea, for the food to come out, and then needing to ask for a spoon for the miso soup.  I understand this was opening week and some kinks were probably being worked out so I decided I should come back during dinner to see the full tapas menu and give it another shot. 

That day and the next they were doing 50% off the bill so the next day at dinner I recruited a friend to check out the tapas menu with me.  It was more of the same regarding service, despite having more than one server interact with us throughout the experience. This happened the previous day.  The other funny thing was the same primary server who tended to us at dinner was also the one who was taking care of me at lunch the previous day.  I understand when it's stupid busy and a lot of people are coming through, you can't remember everyone, but she didn't recognize me from the previous day even though she invited me back to check out this particular menu, and the place was never packed the both times I happened to be in.

The dinner menu is large and easy to get lost in, we got the chicken yakisoba which was great, the halibut roll, a couple other dishes that weren't memorable, my friend wanted the bacon asparagus dish, which had a hair in it.  We let the server know just so they could make the kitchen aware.  They apologized and offered us ice cream.  Overall the decor is very traditional and I can tell a lot of thought and care went into it.  The staff is friendly and I feel like they're trying but there has to be some disconnect between the front and back of the house.  The food was good but was coming out very slowly and sporadically, I think that's related to the previous statement. Oh and they have been picking the weirdest Pandora channels for music, it was mostly some super slow r&b and a couple Pandora ads. Some people might find it petty for me to mention it, but I noticed it and kind of found it entertaining.   I'm not sure if or when I'll try this place again because I feel like I got burned back to back, especially with the other reviews being so enthusiastic about this place.  Maybe I had bad luck both times?  I'll give it some time before taking another shot here, there are so many options explore in Chinatown alone, and all around Vegas.",hDzgJUST9jdBrtnUK5085w,2,2,2,l4ZWV4eARhT9RP7PMDFQ7Q

After you eat the sashimi they deep fry the remains of the fish, which makes for an excellent crunchy snack. Perfect for drinking black and tan (made from Asahi Black and Kirin or Sapporo)!

1729384,2015-01-08,8,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"I've got izakaya fever and the only cure is... more Japanese tapas! Heads up that the lunch menu is more casual fusion fare (sushi burritos, for example) while the dinner menu is mostly traditional dishes, with a great board of specials- handily posted over each table for your drooling convenience.

As staples, I'd order the UNI CHAWAN MUSHI ($7)- delicate egg custard dish with uni and mushrooms, served in the cutest French china pot, which was second only to a phenomenal MUSHROOM PORRIDGE with egg (back page of menu by the rice bowls)- it's saucy and carby and comforting and flavorful all at once.  Not to mention packed with mushrooms.  
Other favorite dishes include the CRISPY TUNA CRACKER, which manages to be both spicy and crispy without being too spicy or too crispy. The TEMPURA WHITE FISH ($6) is divine- I'd order several for the table, the flavorful, flakey fish goes fast. If it's on the specials menu, I'd consider the TUNA BELLY STEAK ($12) a must-order; the dipping sauce and perfectly-cooked interior make for an orgasmic bite.

I did not originally plan on ordering sushi here, but was easily persuaded to try their sashimi specials- and the freshness of their fish rivals the top-ranked places in town. I also really enjoyed some of their simpler rolls, like the salmon and avocado- that section of the menu isn't too large and consists mostly of classic combinations.

Heads up that orders may take a while if there are several large groups- it's a small place with a small kitchen. I would like to suggest that they NOT use the first table inside the door for groups, as squeezing my butt past someone's face is NOT my idea of a good start to my meal- nor one I would want to experience.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,7,4,qPF3CURIK6VOf2fhW4hl_w

Finally we got seated. It probably took a server about 5/7 minutes before she asked what we would like to drink. 

The food did not take long to serve but the quality was a disgrace. I felt like I was eating salt. Like someone though it would be funny to pour salt into each sushi roll. 

Finally when I was ready to leave after being seated so long with my food being complete I forgot the server had not yet given me the check and almost got up and left.

The food, prices, and service were fantastic! They have an extensive menu, prices are good (compared to the Strip and Hawaii prices), and the entire staff is friendly. We got to say hi to the chef and thank him for the best meal we had in Vegas. 

Every thing we tried was delicious and fresh.  Squid legs in garlic butter, Poke ""nachos"", sashimi, salmon and ikura roll, grilled chicken livers, gizzards, and hearts.

We ended up getting pretty much the same items as before. Food was really good, don't get me wrong.

A relaxed atmosphere, common Japanlike  mood, kind servers and the taste are nothing to be desired. 

Today, we ate Karaage dinner plate, marinated miso salmon bowl, salmon handroll and cold sake.  Karaage, my first priority here is worth to be recommended.  The rest are good, too.

If you go there first time, be sure to get Japan fried rice. The taste is better with miso soup.

Actually, most served food here are great and through severs here, you can feel how kind Asian (esp. Japanese and Korean) are. 

If you go there with 3 or more, you can make a reserve seat by calling and always many people love  Izakya Go like me.

My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday around 1 am for a late dinner. It wasn't busy at all and there was only one server. 

We ordered: 

CRISPY PORK BELLY: honestly my favorite dish. It was crispy and chewy. I liked the salt that was sprinkled on it. It brought out the savory taste! 
CHICKEN KARAGE: Felt undercooked and needed to be more crispy. 
UNI POTSTICKERS: hmm I really wondered what I put in my mouth. I think there was only a smidge of uni at the top and the rest was weird mushy stuff. 
HALIBUT AND ABALONE: okay seriously for $15 I expected a lot more. The halibut was seriously the size of my two fingers and the abalone was very tiny also. They just serve it with a side of ponzu.
GO WINGS: were drenched in some salty teriyaki sauce. The breading was hard and I didn't like it at all. 
UNI CHAWAN MUSHI: very savory! I love the seafood that was in there and how it's served to you in a small cute cup.
BEEF TATAKI: very small portion. Only five small pieces. I did like the sauce and topping they pot with it. The meat was tender and chewy!
SPICY MISO RAMEN: the noodles were very undercooked and came out warm. The broth was light and just okay. 

The owner Go was nice enough to let us try his small clam dish.

2160347,2016-09-11,2,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"WAY overrated.  I guess when a restaurant puts out a ""Review us on Yelp"" sign, you can expect the reviews to be skewed in the positive direction.

I think the mistake I made was forgetting that the word ""Sushi"" is not in this restaurant's name but the first category it is listed under on Yelp IS ""Sushi Bars""

I had both Sushi and Izakaya.  First off, first place I've been in all my travels and hundreds of sushi bars that they actually don't have a Nigiri menu (only roll menu).  This should have been the first red flag.  Second red flag is they had a bar area like a sushi bar but no one was standing behind it making sushi. 

The sushi was LAME.  Edible, but the pieces of fish were small, quality of fish was average, rice was mediocre and construction and presentation also mediocre.

The Izakaya was good but I've not eaten many places so I'm no expert.  Had mushrooms, pork belly and tuna belly.  Pork belly was so so, the other two were good.  

Service was uneven.  I guess if you live in the area and like Izakaya, this is not a bad choice, but overall this place is unremarkable and the Sushi was very lackluster.  4 stars for Izakaya, 2 stars for sushi = 3 star average.",z5YKMFtISMlMMPoBy4s9Fw,1,0,3,BngUAsS-Uw9SeylCGc-KtA
2172159,2016-06-26,9,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"In search of an Izakaya Resaurant in Las Vegas, *Izakaya Go* popped up and so I thought I'd check this place out. This is located in Chinatown in a shopping center that's not as busy as the other parts of town. The server who helped us that evening was very nice. The food was pretty tasty and everything I ordered was good, as well as the other orders I sampled at our table. 

My order: 
~Pumpkin Croquettes: MmM!
~Crispy Pork Belly with a side of white rice: delightful :)
~Goma-ae: Boiled Spinach in sesame dressing: great side

The only reason I deducted a star was the weird order of the food coming out. First and foremost my food came out first which was cool, but then no other orders were coming out for a really long time. The orders were coming out at random timing with really long gaps.. so basically we all could not eat at the same time. By the time the ramen came out everybody was done eating except for that last person. That was super sad and strange, I don't understand the back up and it was really awkward to watch the last person eat while we were all done.. it's like the last order was forgotten and never placed to begin with. 

Overall, a decent spot, with a great variety.. however just beware of the interesting service. (:",HyAAsCY79JtNBjjU7pn_dQ,15,13,3,7G38VFq4jTogg04T0Gef0Q
2178524,2015-03-25,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"The Skinny: the street food is great especially the takoyaki but fried items are just okay(3.5) the service was fast and efficient (4), value: very generous serving sizes for the price (3.5 bump up to 4 stars) 

I was coming off a late night shift and hungry as hell. The hubs said why don't we try this izakaya in Chinatown. I am all in. 

So we head to Izakaya Go which is tucked away in a small plaza behind a Starbucks.  Parking and is free but has a 80 minutes maximum in front of the restaurant.  Seeing how it was late and there was not much going on there,  this didn't bother us too much. 

We were promptly seated and orders taken. Service is solid with complimentary hot green tea. (FYI -  iced green tea is never free... Don't ask me why but it is a Japanese thing). 

Like most izakayas, the menu consists of many small dishes that go well with alcohol. Surprisingly,  there aren't any kushiyaki or yakitori on the menu. I also found it funny that they offered ramen and soba

First visit: takoyaki,  yakisoba,  tonkatsu dinner, buta kakuni. 

The takoyaki was on the mark. This is the closest I've had to the takoyaki you get in Osaka's Dotombori district.  The batter is fluffy on the side,  crispy on the outside. Served with shaved Bonito flakes, mayo and takoyaki sauce,  it is totally delish and a great value for the price. 

Yakisoba was another favorite.  The stir-fried noodles had a nice chew to it while the slightly charred (in a good way!)meat and vegetables gives a mild smokey flavor. 

The stewed pork belly (buta kakuni) was a generous portion without too much fat. Marinated in a sweet soy base and served with a bit of mustard,  the meat was moist and delicious.

The tonkatsu dinner was a good value. Only thing is the tonkatsu crust is a bit too thick and heavy. Overall it was okay but nothing we need to order again. 

Round 2: stir fried mushrooms,  sautéed spinach, miso glazed eggplant, California roll, crispy pork belly, karaage. 

Stir fried mushrooms were great. Loved the buttery flavor with a nice sear. 

California roll was pretty standard stuff. Okay but nothing to write home about. 

Crispy pork belly texturally was too hard and a bit too salty. The karaage had similar problems plus was served with an aioli which was too heavy. Pass. 

Miso eggplant was very sweet and could almost be categorized as candied eggplant. Pass. 

Sautéed spinach was okay but really nothing special and a small portion to boot. 

Given the food overall,  there were some hits and misses. But given the good items are so good,  it is enough to have me coming back for more. (3.5 bump up to 4 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,1,4,lFdLaUQVLjwg2n4MBhGMsA

The noodles were plentiful but a little too soggy. I wish it wasn't cooked so long. The opposite was true for the bean sprouts, which were a little too crunchy for my taste. 

My friends and I came here for an early dinner, 6pm on a Saturday night. There was no crowd when we got there but it got busy after a while. Once the place filled up, it was hard to get service. The food also came out very slowly, one at a time. Probably 10-15 minutes in between each person's orders. Typically, this wouldn't bother me, but it's a little awkward when only one person has their food and everyone else is waiting for theirs.

The ika had a good flavor of light citrus and butter, but had a crunchy uncooked texture rather than the tender texture like the ika butter at kyaras tapas. I wasn't a fan of the texture since it was a little more difficult to chew and digest. The ramen burger wasn't very much impressive either. It just tasted like soggy ramen smothered in pulled pork and onions. The sauce was too strong on it, and the ramen buns had a very unappetizing texture and plain flavor. Service was mediocre, our waitress was nice but when our food came out, our chef looked very annoyed or uninterested and spoke very quietly and monotoned like he just wanted to leave and go sleep in the corner.

Over-all, for a fine dining establishment, I didn't feel the fine dine experience at all and left a little dissatisfied. I probably wouldn't come back, but i suppose it's worth a try if you haven't ever been yet.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,1,2,3,i7C3YJOVNqyD3Jg8G18oNw

Usually there's some innovation with Izakaya...some new flavour profile etc. The menu was very basic...the most basic sushi options and the typical deep fried stuff.

Service (from the owner) was great the first time we came in for lunch! We shared tempura, salmon and chicken lunch combinations, and while nothing wowed us, the service and promising looking dinner menu made us want to come back right away to check out dinner. Our first time in for dinner we were eating light and just came in for a few items at the bar...nothing was bad, but nothing would bring us back. We were the only ones in the restaurant and service was inconsistent as they had just opened and were still preparing for the evening shift. Our server (and the small staff in general) was in the back of the house the vast majority of the time, but the specials board as well as a few menu items sounded too good for us not to return. On our third visit the service was horrible. Our server was new, had not been trained properly, and she didn't know anything about Japanese food or the products being used. We ordered several items and once again, we were not impressed by a single one. Not only that, a few dishes were rather bad. 

Items that let us down:
Spicy Tuna Bowl
Uni dumplings
Crispy Pork Belly
Hamachi kama
Battera
Tuna Belly Steak
Chawan Mushi
Tororo Udon with grated mountain yam 


Lunch certainly saved this from a 1 star review in my opinion...but I would not have gone out of my way to eat lunch here aside from the bad dinner experiences. I've heard that they have improved recently, but I will have to hear that for a while from some trusted sources before I want to venture back.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,14,10,2,hQmkKeMBK5lLCky-lHpKEg

The vibe is very chill and inviting. Tonight there was reggae music which made the experience so much better. It reminded me of eating or hanging out at local bars along the beach in Hawaii and Guam. 

It's a small venue with a window view into the kitchen. So if you want to see your food being made, sit at the bar. Although, it through me off that the guy cooking and plating the food didn't wear gloves but rather wipe off on a side towel everytime he touched food. 

Service is great! The owner Go speaks English and Japanese, so I found it a bit entertaining to hear someone at the bar showoff their Japanese skills by speaking the language . Although Go means 5 in Japanese, it can mean other things too. Here I am thinking it's the 5th restaurant of its kind...like Thai Noodle house 1 2 3 4 and 5...

The food was amazing and will be back to try more. They also carry Junmai Sake which is one of the best Sake out there.

First of all, the atmosphere of the place was exactly what I'm used to see in my hometown. With all the decorations and spot lights surrounding the entire restaurant, the first thing that popped in to my mind was this is what an real Izakaya should look like. While I was impressed of the décor, my next question was, will this place have the right quality food that matches the place. Oh yeah they did and honestly it exceeded my expectation. Sashimi (raw fish with no rice) no doubt was as fresh as it gets, fried chicken (karaage) and kimuchi tofu went so well with beer. Moved on to drinking sake, grilled black cod, king crab legs, sea urchin dumpling, and tuna belly steak was so yummy, I couldn't stop drinking..... I closed it out with their Shio ramen. Their chashu was tender and flavorful and the soup had a nice kick spice in it, and liked it for the fact that it was chicken broth instead of pork.

The only reason why I hesitate to give a full 5-stars is the service left something to be desired. I asked my server what he would recommend to accompany the Uni dish, which he could hardly create an answer for. He just directed me to the specials board, which worked out fine. But I was hoping for a little more guidance on the very extensive menu. Maybe a starchy dish to complement the egg custard? 

The other note on service was about 7-8 minutes after I had placed my order, I was looking around the restaurant (dining solo tonight) to soak in the authentic and homey decor. My server must have thought I was being impatient as he then warned me that the specific dishes I ordered do take a while to cook. I was not concerned about the time, but you think this warning would be better suited as I'm placing the order not 8 minutes after.

I have introduced so many of my friends to this restaurant and most of them love it too! Since they are open so late, I always come here during their Happy Hour times which is 10pm-close (2am or 3am depending on the day). I always either order their half ramen shoyu or half curry udon with chicken. They are so delicious!! They also have another menu for skewers and I never miss the opportunity to order some beef tongue, it comes with a lemon to pour on your beef tongue and it's so good and chewy. Their California poki half roll is very delicious too, I occasionally order this when I'm craving some sushi.

When I'm not ordering from the Happy Hour menu, I either buy the tori udon or one of their combination dinner plates. The combinations are so fulfilling because it comes with so many dishes! My favorite side dish from the dinner plates is the cold tofu they provide. 

The workers are super friendly and helpful but sometimes it takes a very long time for them to notice me calling for them and getting the check takes some time too.

2641303,2015-03-17,6,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"On our first GO, we were a little let down by their menu selection. Did we come too early in their grand opening? Did they not expand their menu yet? Maybe the classic ""it's not you, it's me"" situation, but we just weren't really feeling it! Nothing looked truly original or even exciting, except for an item or two.

We felt that the small tapas style plates were leaning closer towards the pricey range. However, we did find a glimmer of satisfaction in 2 of the dishes we sampled. Here's what we ended up with:

Spicy tuna cracker $6.75 / From the appetizer section. Alright, so you heard me, this isn't original and I can definitely get a great spicy tuna cracker down the street (Gyu-Kaku, Jinya Ramen Bar) but it's still a pretty darn tasty execution of a classic, cult favorite dish. Beautifully presented; fried crispy rice, topped with spicy tuna, avocado, a dot of sriracha, and drizzled with a creamy spicy mayo sauce. Nice proportions  and we enjoyed the delicate, subtle spice. Flavor rating: 5/5

Asparagus bacon $4.95 / From their stir-fried section. It came out in a bowl, super limp and soggy, with about 2 inches of oil at the bottom. We felt that it was also way too salty for its own good, so we ordered an extra side of rice to eat it with. Granted, bacon is supposed to be salty - it was overkill. And what's up with that pool of oil? Flavor rating: 2/5

Uni chawan mushi $6.25 / From the steamed dishes section. This, to us, is an exotic find; we haven't seen it at most restaurants. Also, we can't compare this dish to anywhere else as it's our first time trying it, yet we thought it was exceptionally bland (I apologize in advance if this dish is supposed to be flavored in that manner.) As gorgeous as it was, with the elegant presentation, it wasn't our favorite dish of the evening. The uni flavor was terribly muted and that is a shame. Flavor rating: 2/5

Fresh halibut roll $10.95 / From the sushi rolls section. California roll topped with fluke sashimi, yuzu juice, and natural salt. Extremely simple, however, the fish was very fresh, naturally sweet, and we loved the brightness that the yuzu offered. The surprising sprinkles of salt set off our taste-buds in a explosive direction and we really enjoyed that. Flavor rating: 4/5

We would be curious to return (eventually) to taste their other specials such as the ""uni dumplings"" or try other popular dishes that our Yelper buddies rave about.

You may find them on a better night than we did - but for the variety seeker, the Izakaya connoisseur, this spot might be a NO-GO.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,9,8,3,E-7wXi7gieL93GlrDAd90w

My sister suggested that we try out the place so I went with her. First off, the ambiance was very casual and this place has some points for some of its aesthetic decorations. Service was very prompt and great. We were quickly asked if my sister and I have been served and brought out waters. 

They have a Happy Hour menu starting at 10pm- closing. I wasn't really in the mood to try much this night so this may be a disadvantage in the review for everything else. But after experiencing many other ramen places, I would not go here for ramen if that's what you're looking for. 

Their Shoyu ramen is made with egg noodle and come with bamboo as the topping and a half cooked egg. As in my photo, you could tell that it was lacking variety. The broth was very flat and one dimensional. 

I forgot what the dessert was called, but it was made with green tea pancake sandwich with red beans and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If you like green tea unsweetened than you'll enjoy the green tea bitter after taste. I took a scoop of the red beans and vanilla ice cream with the green tea pancake and you get an un-orchestrated concoction of taste. The vanilla ice cream over powered everything. 

On a side note I was told to try their tuna dishes and poke salad, so I may come back next time with a bigger appetite to try other things on the menu.

Suppen jeg fik til hovedret var desværre ikke noget særligt, og den er den eneste grund til at stedet ikke får fire stjerner, for alt andet var bare perfekt, stemningen dejlig casual og positiv og priserne nogle, man kun kan klappe af.

3087710,2017-08-26,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"We've been meaning to try Izakaya Go but usually just end up at Ichiza. I took my parents here when they were in town and it was a pleasant experience. It's a very small restaurant and we waited about 10-15 min for a table on a Friday night. We started off with mugi shochu (a Japanese alcohol made from barley.) I can't find anywhere in town that sells it except a few restaurants so I always try to take advantage. Ask for it on the rocks it's very mild but similar to vodka or sake.

We ordered a bunch of little plates to share:

Okonomiyaki: seafood pancake. It's usually a lot thinner than it was served here but everyone agreed the texture was perfect. It was spongy and had a great ratio of batter to filling. A little heavy on the sauce but still good. A good portion size too for sharing.

Karaage: standard fried chicken but served with mayonnaise, interestingly. The seasoning was a lot heavier than I've ever had it but it was great. 

Kimchi tofu: one of the highlights. The flavor was amazing. It was served in a bed of broth with tempura crunchies inside. The mix of textures and the sour kimchi was perfection.

Shoga yaki: I've never had this before but loved it. It's stir fried pork with ginger. If I wasn't very hungry I would have just ordered this with a side of rice.

Tsukemono: I love tsukemono (Japanese pickled vegetables) And the waiter was impressed we actually ordered it. It's a great palate cleanser and very refreshing.

Hamachi Kama: Always a must have at izakayas. It's yellow tail collar. Mix in the daikon with the soy broth. You can pick at the collar for a long time and still get some good meat.

Yakisoba: Probably wouldn't order this again. Very similar to the shoga yaki with the vegetables used and felt a little heavy at this point in the meal. 

Crunch roll: standard crunch roll. Small order though so it wasn't too filling. 

Overall I liked Izakaya Go. Their menu isn't as adventurous as Ichiza but it has all the right stuff. I could definitely come back for some shochu and skewers. The night we went they were out of a lot of the skewers we wanted to try so we skipped that. It's also very close to the Strip compared to the rest of Chinatown so I'd recommend for tourists staying at the Wynn or somewhere nearby.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3,1,4,x4lDuAQQODQ5Qyla15Svvw

Takoyaki - a ball shape dough cooked in a special pan stuffed with a perfect piece of octopus, this place by far serves the best one I've ever had in Vegas. 5 stars

Grilled Tuna Belly (from the special's board) top quality fish grilled to perfection and lightly seasoned so the natural taste of the tuna stands out and with a not so over powering Ponzu Sauce was pretty good just unfortunately ours was a bit raw on the side almost made it felt like we were eating a seared fish but we still ate it all because it was still tasty. 4.3 stars

 Uni Chawan Mushi is their egg custard with veggies topped with sea urchin was just amazing. Very gentle and subtle to the palate with the combination chosen. Better word for it... comfort food like a Japanese version of chicken noodle soup for the soul 5 stars

Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage might not be for everyone. But if you're like me who loves that part of the chicken then this is a must order! If you have eaten this before then you'll know what the texture is all about but it's battered and deep fried so it's masked and once you eat it... it's so weird in a good way. By far my favorite thing to order every time I go here 5 stars

Deep Fried Octopus it's octopus and it's deep fried... need I say more? The mayo dipping sauce was a bit too much for me I prefer it with just the lemon and seasoning in tbh 4.4 stars

Karage Chicken at the time when I ordered it, I felt it was a bit heavy on the salty side. I had to squeeze 2 lemons to balance out that sharp salty taste from my tongue. Maybe I just had a bad batch thay night.  I'll order it again to see if it changes 3.4 stars

Still have more foods to review... will post when I get the time .. lol

Don't forget to say hi to Go, he's amazing and I believe owns the place. His soothing choice of music to play reggae in his restaurant has me coming back for more because it's just so laid back, perfect lighting,  good vibes, alcohol, no tv so you can actually conversate with people you're with there and you can't go wrong with his prices.

**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #12**

I have literally been WAITING to try this place out and I FINALLY got the chance this year & it was great!!  It was just like Hondaya in Tustin, CA which I have been really wishing would come to vegas so I didn't have to keep choosing that place every time I go back home. 

Service was an INTERESTING start.... not too friendly... but once I started to order things got different. All the staff were smiling & coming by to check up on us. They all greeted us bye very loud & genuinely.

Atmosphere is just how I would have imagined it. Wood furniture w/ cushions & has that whole Japanese late-night bar hangout place. Plus they are open late so it's my go-to after a hard day's work!!! 

Now since they are a tapas style.... this is what I ordered.

DEEP FRIED SOFT SHELL SHRIMP $6.50
GRILLED MOCHI W/ COD ROE CHEESE $5.95
SAUTEED BUTTER MUSHROOMS $4.95

HALIBUT CARPACCIO W/ UNI $14.95
SEA URCHIN PASTA $- lots of UNI flavor yummm
TRUFFLED BUTTER CORN ON HOT PAN $4.95- definitely pass on this one cuz it has NO TRUFFLE taste at all

3241971,2016-08-16,22,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Ramen soup addiction cannot be countered by anything else. Okay well I haven't given any sushi a chance here. I don't even know how extensive their sushi menu is since my eyeballs search directly for the ramen noodles; aside from their skewer apps since it's on a separate piece of paper.

Shiyo and Miso ramen are checked off my list. Next up Shoyu and Tonkatsu. The waitress mentioned they have Tonkatsu ramen now ooooooh :×D. I was able to order with the hot oil on the side. It's a killer spicy level and didn't need much to cause nose dripping... No not in my bowl thilly wabbits.

I save the egg for last. Not sure why I do it but always eaten after all my noodles are gone. Please don't watch me too closely when I eat ramen. Uuuuh you'll find me sifting through what's left of the broth trying to get every last bit of noodle. Warning: it might annoy you. 

On their skewer appetizer list, we've stuck to the greens: okra, asparagus, zucchini. For a chubby treat we tried bacon wrapped okra. Seven seconds off our lives for each bacon strip? I dunno, then there goes almost half a minute. I think swallowing chewed gum is worse.

So cute in this place. The center of the seating area has a large table for traditional Japanese dining... I think... Cuz guests removed their shoes. But then again I might've seen them sitting properly as if on a bench. It's a cool addition to a dining experience here. This particular table area in the center is like the centerpiece to the rest of the restaurant.

Haven't tried sake yet - surprising myself with that since I used to go sake tasting in the OC quite a bit. So they've got an assortment of bottles displayed on the corner wall and behind the bar. The beers are Kirin and Asahi.

We've been served by the same two people each visit. Just want to acknowledge their hard work. Service is good considering how busy. Keep up the friendliness and smiles. You're doing a fine job.

Looking forward to the next dining splurge. I almost went again tonight. However I didn't want to bore my appetite even though I kept thinking of their ramen noodle soup.

The current Yelp rating speaks for itself. Diners love it - always full house every time I've dropped in. Yaaaay full bellies!!! Stay happyyyyy!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,33,35,4,sguY2ejrmnMmd8QsY5-qiw

We got a bunch of stuff to share:
- Tonkatsu & shio ramens (come spicy so if you don't like spicy request mild. These were ok, your basic ramen soup. Nothing special)
- Yaki soba (way too sweet, wasn't a fan)
- Poke hand roll (basic, pretty good)
- Tuna Tartare Yukke (surprisingly pretty spicy, great flavors w/ imitation crab meat underneath and chunks of avocado, raw egg on top)
- Pork belly yakitoro (very basic. Grilled pork on a skewer w/ a lime. No special seasonings)
- Bream sashimi (not on HH menu, but best thing we ordered. Very fresh, then they take the bones and deep fry for you and bring back. You also have the option of making it into a miso fish bone soup)

I wouldn't say it's the freshest but i didn't feel the quality was a miss.   I just felt that the sushi slices were thinner than most places.  But at least the portion of the food was a decent size so you are getting a bigger bang for your buck.  You also can make reservation so you can avoid the wait.  This place does get packed so come early or you will have to wait.   The servers were nice and attentive.  They came back a couple of times to refill our tea and glass.

But they have more than just your typical Japanese bar food. They have full on entrees and other foods you can go for, but that's not what the purpose of my visit was. 

Depending on what you get, it can start to add up. I think our bill between two people was around $90 hahaha but we also got some of the more expensive stuff on the menu though. 

We got a bunch of stuff off the yakitori menu.....like one of each at least if not two. They were all pretty good, nothing too special to note, just really get what you like. This is where the price starts to add up, it gets pretty expensive when each skewer is around $2-$3 and they're not filling on their own. 

We also got the delicacy sashimi plate which consisted of sea squirt ovary, wasabi herring roe, and salmon kidney. We were told to eat it in that order. All I can say is the experience was interesting and I'd do it again. It's one of those things you should try at least once in your life. 

You can usually tell how good a place is by their karaage. Theirs was decent at best, I didn't really expect much but most places offer ketchup with it and instead they offered mayonnaise. Just note that Japanese ketchup and mayonnaise are totally different in flavor from American ones. 

Overall it was a good place. I'll definitely look forward to the next time I go and try other stuff off their menu.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,1,1,4,GfmkCfUfBJZsWqTQPOdNoQ

I ordered the Tonkatsu dinner plate which came with a bunch of things like: tofu, 2 pieces of gyoza, rice, miso soup, potato salad, salad, and obviously the tonkatsu lol. The tonkatsu was really crispy and flavorful and it left me wanting more! The gyoza tasted different compared to other ones I have tried, but it was tasty for only having vegetables inside of it. One of my friends didn't like it because of a weird tangy taste. My least favorite component of the meal was the tofu because it just tasted like a bland, firm block lol.

There is also a check in deal for free ice cream so I definitely took advantage of that and got a scoop of green tea ice cream. It was a nice finishing touch a delicious meal (who doesn't love free dessert?!).

Overall, you guys should check this place out if you have a group of people looking for a lively place to have dinner. I only paid about $15-16 for a bunch of food which left me full afterwards.

The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters, sushi burritos and traditional dishes. All the food we ordered were exquisite. I have to say the Ramen burger was different and something we never had before and was very delicious. It had a fried egg and a large piece of pork cooked to tender with large portion of seasoned fries that taste like sweet potato goodness. A standout for me was the fresh octopus ball.  It came in six and they had a nice flavor and as you chew it had different textures. The Poki ""Burrito"" was fresh as well. The portion is bigger then a typical sushi rolls, and instead of tortilla a sheet of nori seaweed with rice help contained all the ingredients. Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab served with ponzu sauce was fresh and crispy with a light batter and so was the fried baby octopus. You also get  a cup of complementary green tea in the end.

The seafood were fresh and flown in from Japan. They have a wide selection of sake. However, they did not carry Kurosawa which is one of our favorite but did get an equivalent kind called Kikusui Junmai Ginjo.
The servers were welcoming and attentive. 
The only thing I would advise is the music, they were playing Reggae when we were there. I would suggest to make it authentic is to play Japanese music.
I would recommend this place and would definitely return and try something new.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,1,2,5,iKpq9ErneHWAcWB6aYizMA

We walked in and it was very cramped with the tables close together and very little wiggle room. It's a tight but very pleasant atmosphere. The first thing they do is give you a LOT of menus, I think we had 3-4 on our table for both of us. It's really confusing at first, but once you sort through what each menu is for, then you can start to make decisions. 

We started with the Octopus Carpaccio and it was absolutely amazing (see picture). It is pricey, but worth the experience. It was thinly sliced and not chewy at all. Whatever they do to it makes it well worth the price. For our main course, we had the ramen and it was wonderful as well. Lasty, we had some Eel yakitori which was heavenly (see picture). 

Another thing worth mentioning is the Green Tea. I don't know what they do to make it taste so good, but it's the best Green Tea I have ever had (and I usually don't like Green Tea).

Lastly, don't be in a rush here. When you order something, keep in mind that they are making it from scratch and you may have to wait a bit. When we ordered the Eel, it took about 15 minutes to get it (at it wasn't very busy).

Izakaya Go has me smiling once more.

Every restaurant scene in any respectable city has to have a good selection of tapas joints (among other things of course). I am especially fond of the ""small plate"" joints as I tend to be a light eater, yet I love trying many items at once. Japanese tapas has always been on the top of my restaurant list because, well let's admit it, the Japanese just do food better than anyone.

We stopped in late night for a small snack before heading home. Of course as always, I ended up eating way more than I should have. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed my Udon, the highlight of the evening was certainly the Ramen Burger. Using pork belly instead of ground beef was a simple stroke of genius, and the sauce was absolutely amazing. This just might be might favorite dish in all of Vegas.

Service was great (I think the owner was our server), but the place was a little slow. Which was too bad, I think more people need to hear about this place, I think it has a good chance of taking the place of that old favorite down the street that recently fell off its perch.

I definately recommend giving Izakaya Go a go.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,5,8,5,0vq1174btxJ0f8MFVi6RPg

ATMOSPHERE:

Tucked away in the former Koraku Ramen Spot, Izakaya Go is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with in the Izakaya arena. We stopped in for a quick bite and perusing the menu, it is an interesting spread with your usual lunch combination specials, as well as a section for Curry, their take on Asian fusion burgers and burritos, and an entire page of noodles.
Clean inside, and no distracting TVs, but the counter full of congratulatory flowers kinda gave me the heebie-jeebies thinking I was in a funeral parlor...YIKES! Thank goodness that's temporary! The owner, Chef Go approached our table during our meal to see how our lunch was...always a plus to know that the Chef/Owner is actually in the restaurant cooking.


BITES/BEVERAGES:

I went with the Tonkatsu Lunch Combination($9.95) and we also decided to split a *Poki Burrito ($9.25) *should be spelled Poke, and is pronounced Po-keh, NOT Po-key, FYI...Hot tea is complimentary, just ask for a pot...Out of curiosity, I asked to see the dinner menu, and my eyes immediately zoomed in on the Uni Chawanmushi($6.25) which sounded pretty slammin' , so our waitress was nice enough to check with the kitchen if they could fire one up for us, and sure enough, they were able to! The lunch combinations served here have got to be the biggest ones I've seen! House salad, miso soup, tofu, takuan, and potato salad are included with your entree on one massive tray! My Tonkatsu was cooked to perfection, crisp, juicy, and not greasy at all. Poki Burrito(Think Jogasaki) was good but there was something HELLA SPICY in there! I grabbed a bite of Wifey's Enoki Mushroom and Shrimp Tempura from her Tempura Combo($9.95) tons better than that disastrous tempura at that Michelin starred chef's place... Oh man, the Chawanmushi? Money! loaded with mushrooms, shrimp, and uni, I would definitely devour this again!

CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Same plaza as KUMA Snow Cream on Valley View and Spring Mountain...

Remember, the lunch menu is totally different from the dinner selections  . The more traditional Izakaya items and Japanese dishes, and seafood specialities are on their dinner menu. However, if it's not busy at lunch and something on the dinner menu tempts you, just ask...they might just make it for you!

MASSIVE portions, great prices...you won't leave hungry here. Trust me....

Still have yet to explore dinner here...it's kind of a mix of Kyara, Soho, and Ichiza...
Speaking of Ichiza, This may be a better option after Ichiza's constant run-ins with SNHD.  ALOHA!!!

There was no wait when we came around 11pm, but we took the last table.

Ordered:
x Spicy Tuna Roll - we usually don't order rolls, but lately we've been ordering spicy tuna rolls everywhere we go. This one was a little loose and lightly wrapped, but still flavorful and delicious. Helped that it was on the happy hour menu :)
x Spicy Tuna Over Crispy Rice - I LOVEEEE crispy rice, but this one tasted more like fried. Super sticky rice in the middle. Still good, but won't order this again.
x Sea Urchin Dumplings - It tastes exactly how you would imagine it. Eating warm uni was a little strange for me, but the boyfie thoroughly enjoyed it. 
x Truffle Corn - SOOOOO GOOOD. There's actual pieces of truffle hidden around the corn. MUST order.
x Whole Grilled Squid - I love grilled squid and this one did not disappoint. 
x Albacore Handrolls - Probably my least favorite of the night. The albacore wasn't fresh and there was just SOOOO much rice. Usually hand rolls come with cucumbers or sauce or SOMETHING, but this one was just fish, rice, and seaweed. Meh. Maybe I'll get the spicy tuna next time.

The food is good and it's a pretty fun environment. Coming here for happy hour makes everything 100x better. Beers were only $3 and our check for all of that was only $50!!! We left stuffed too :) Usually when I eat Japanese tapas the check is ALWAYS over $100. So happy about this place. Even better because it's only 5 minutes away from where I stay.

I tried a ramen burger from L&L once back when I took a trip to Hawaii. I was so traumatized. It was so greasy.

Plot twist! It's pork. I wanna say pork belly. But it it was just so tender and ripped apart so easily in every bite. 

The consistency of the ramen bun was perfect. Crispy on the outside for a nice crunch and then a perfect (not soggy) noodle on the inside.

Izakaya?"" What I love about this place is Go. He's the owner and he works hard as a server and an owner. I respect these types of places a lot and it's part of the reason why I keep coming. Obviously the food is great.

I get a lot of food here for $15 during happy hour. The quote ""can I get veggie dumplings, two avocado rolls, and two pumpkin croquettes?"" is etched into my brain since I've been saying it all month. This place is soooo good and is constantly good aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

Service is great. Every server I have gotten is extremely polite and treats you like a guest in their home. Go's hair is heavenly too. His hair is so beautiful and it's the real reason why I keep coming. Yeah, that's right. Forget about the food and the service, just come over, pay for dinner during happy hour and admire Go's luscious hair (Im kidding, dummy. Although, Go's hair is pretty gosh dang amazing).

My bill that comes after my inspirational quote I said earlier that mentions 2 avocado rolls, 2 pumpkin croquettes, and veggie dumplings comes out to be $20 (with tip) during happy hour. Pretty cheap considering I leave dying from eating so much. Sure, I can easily stop eating or ordering so much so I can avoid those post I-almost-vomited-from-eating-so-much burps; but the food is so good when it's fresh.

I have tried other dishes in the past besides my usual. I only remember having the curry with cheese. It had acceptable taste and was a huge portion. Izakaya Go is an izakaya restaurant, so it's not like them having an okay curry really affects them. Them only having okay tasting non-Izakaya foods matters as much as okay tasting chicken fingers at Cheesecake Factory.

Tips: Don't you dare disrespect the servers or I'll cut you. Order izakaya dishes, its their best ones considering it's an izakaya restaurant. Come here after work or during late hours for happy hour (DUH. ITS AN IZAKAYA RESTAURANT, DOOF).

Pros: Nice staff, the owner is a server himself and is a leader rather than a boss, great food, amazing prices during happy hour, Go's hair (so dreamy).

Cons: Uuuuuuuuuuh?????????? their curry, a dish that isn't specialized here, is only okay???!!! ugh!! If I could rate 0 stars I would!!!!! grr only okay!!!!!!!!!

4 stars for food

I'm no stranger to this restaurant. The best tip I can give you is to come on Monday's when they get their fresh shipment of fish in. 

This place gets busy so I usually come right when they open. Otherwise, expect to wait - but it's very well worth it. 

Izakaya go has a large menu, so if you're indecisive, ask your server for some suggestions. Also, the chef usually gives you complimentary dishes. Yesterday we got conch, and mantis crab - very different but very tasty. 

Here's what I ordered:

Corn butter: delicious but I wish they melted some cheese on top 
Dried Mullet Roe w/ Miso cream cheese: salty but goes well with beer
Oyster shooter: great but if they added a quail egg, it would've been perfect 
Baracuda sashimi - amazing and when you're done, they can deep fry the head for you. 
Porkbelly skewers, chicken skewers and the beef tongue was my favorite. All delicious and perfectly grilled. 
Potherb mustard yuzu salad with shrimp and avocado - dressed nicely and the shrimp is raw 
Ramen Burger with Fries - MY FAVORITE ITEM. Instead of using a regular beef patty, it's chashu pork. 

Service is excellent however when it gets busy, just please be patient. They're doing their best and I can definitely see that.",9ZXaiRPUbjBscTY5F2Kf_A,3,0,4,TAA2ohJoUV_E5a5B5DAm7w

3857983,2016-11-27,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Went to this restaurant on a road trip back from colorado with my gf and my bro. We were all pretty hungry as we had been driving all day in an effort to get back to LA ASAP. My bro and I split an order of the albacore sushi and the spicy tuna rolls. I ordered baby octopus as we all finished eating since I was still a little hungry. He ordered a poke sushi burrito. My gf ordered the shoyu ramen. We also ordered a few beers.

What I enjoyed about the restaurant:
-Awesome fresh tasting sushi at a pretty reasonable price. The amount of food and the quality are both definitely worth what we paid. 
-My gf enjoyed the meat in her ramen and we both enjoyed the texture of her noodles.
-The beef ponzu was seriously on point. The texture of the beef and the umami flavor of the ponzu sauce was pleasant while also not being too salty. It came with two dumplings, rice, and two edamame-looking peppers, and a light salad with a pretty flavorful dressing (again, not too overbearing flavor wise).

What is left to be desired:
-The service is definitely wanting. Other customers at one point felt kind of dissatisfied with how long their food was taking. I ordered a small order of baby octopus while still in the middle of our meal and it took over twenty minutes after I ordered that dish until it finally came out. It's a relatively small restaurant; sorry, but I view that as poor service.
-The broth of my gf's ramen did not taste particularly appealing. It had a slight fishy taste even though the ramen she ordered came with pork- I find this a little strange. She also ordered the ramen extra spicey; this ramen was not even remotely spicey. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and left satisfied and full. It definitely hit the spot. There are SEVERAL amazing restaurants in Vegas however, so it may be a while before I come back to this restaurant. Considering the value for my money, I don't see why I wouldn't- just not anytime soon.",rMNZnVIUMcL3tzoHnyZiig,0,0,4,_G1jnP06mr1X7rDbi-FoCA

Their spicy tuna is one of the best I've ever had, and that's our favorite roll in general but some other places manage not to make it anywhere near as good as Izakaya does. I've tried all of the ramens and like every single one of them too. The owner has been at the restaurant every single time we've been there. I respect that SO much from a business standpoint, AND he is really cool! There was a party the last time we went and the people had gotten a little rowdy, and not only were the servers and the owner totally accommodating and cool with it, they joined in on the fun all while maintaining the rest of the restaurant successfully and professionally. That balance is hard to do and again, I really respect it! It makes for such a positive atmosphere from many different angles. Overall even with that, the restaurant isn't crazy loud, it's totally reasonable where you can talk easily to one another and still enjoy the buzz of a busy restaurant.

When the waitress brought over a stack of menus almost 10 inches high, I had my doubts. How could they possibly do a good job on so many different items. Pictures looked good so our party of three ordered grilled, raw, and from the kitchen items to try. Fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Raw items were fresh and briny. We also ordered the uni pasta, creamy with a hint of sweetness and sea. Overall everything was very good with maybe one or two out of 10 dishes we ordered were 'only' good. Service was also friendly and prompt. We never felt rushed even know there was already a long line on a Monday night at 7:00 PM. We will go back again before heading back to New York for sure.

Salmon skin salad
Battera
Unagi bowl
Hamachi kama
Takoyaki
Agedashi tofu
Chicken KaraAge
Chawan Mushi
Ten zaru soba
Tororo Udon
Mushroom Zosui
Tuna Belly Steak

A standout was the octopus ball.   There were six and they had good flavor and different textures.  The agedashi tofu was good.  The broth was very flavorful. The mushroom porridge was OK but we hadn't yet gotten sharing bowls so we each had some in our small soy sauce saucer.  The udon was also OK.  The mushroom porridge was my favorite dish.

Major fails:  tuna belly steak - overcooked and very dry.  The tempura was not good.  It had not been cooked enough and the batter had an unfinished taste.  The soba noodles were not good and had little flavor.  I was very disappointed in the chawan mushi.

I don't understand why they charge $2.50 for iced green tea but hot green tea is free.  The place is very small.  Maximum capacity sign said 70 and that would be pushing it.  The noise level was high.

I went for their Happy Hour (10pm-close) and their prices are very reasonable and their portions are are generous. I would say Izakaya Go will be one of my top choices for whenever I go to Chinatown now. 

I got the curry with braised pork belly and I thought the portions were going to be smaller due to happy hour prices, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. The curry arrived in a big plate, half rice and half curry with a small pork belly on top. The meat to rice ratio was 1:2 so I had a lot of rice left over, but that wasn't a problem for me. I ordered 2 pork belly skewers and I ate that with my rice and the curry is so delicious. The skewers were actually very tasty as well. We tried the mango and lychee cocktail and it was pretty strong in my opinion. Next time I go I want to try their hot pot or ramen. 

The service was very nice. We didn't wait too long to be seated and we ordered right away when we sat down. The food arrived in the usual amount of time it takes to make.",dHepuuDntTHFDFg4ld9vHg,2,2,5,GyWVrNTmquFuao6tkuA3YQ
4006063,2015-06-27,4,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Izakaya Go is undoubtedly my most favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas. I come here all the time after a draining day of work to unwind and enjoy all the delightful tapas. It's almost to the point where you can find me either working, sleeping at home or eating at Izakaya Go. After +20 visits here, I felt that I should list some of my favorites for those that never visited, or for people who are looking for something new to try here. 

Since I come here late at night, I like to order from their Happy Hour Special (10PM to close every night!). California Poke Roll is my favorite out of all. Half-size but for $3.50, portion is generous and it is delicious. 

Fishes they use are uber fresh. If you follow them on Instagram or Facebook, you will know that this place gets fresh fish from all parts of the world. For that reason, I recommend their sushi and sashimi. My personal favorites are salmon sashimi, fresh halibut roll, salmon avocado roll and Philadelphia roll. 

Curry is surprisingly good here too. Just like Zen Curry, you can add toppings to it and also adjust the spice level. I would say that curry here is better than Zen curry. Generous portion, reasonable price (cheaper) and delish! 

If you are starving and can't decide what to eat, go to the back of the menu for their combination plates. You choose your main dish and it comes with small dishes on the side, rice, miso soup and salad. My personal favorites are their karaage and tempura. My friends enjoy their katsu and salmon (specifically the salt flavored). 

In addition, their special menu has all the good stuff! Baked mussel is my current favorite right now. Must order! Their uni pasta is another good dish-creamy and rich uni flavor. I also enjoy their pork kimchi with jidori egg. Pork cooked with kimchi and poached egg on top. Kimchi adds a little kick to it and this alone with a side of rice is enough for me sometimes. 

Support your local business! Top-notch food, attentive/friendly service and a restaurant that makes you feel at home. What's not to love about that? ????????????????",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,6,5,5,nEyyQPcXOyyKEt98VB4H3g

I've gone through the yelp photos many times so I new exactly what I wanted.

I came Thursday night at 12:30am. It was EMPTY. I was so happy. We were greeted promptly and basically had the entire staff to ourselves. The seating is cute with butt cushions that I really liked lol

I recently cut out meat as much as possible so I had a pretty vegetarian friendly meal with a friend.

We got French fries, oysters, cucumber roll, crispy rice, agedashi tofu, mushroom porridge, and the uni custard.

I have to say our meal was delicious. We just wanted something light but left ridiculously full. Everything came out prompt, hot, the presentation was nice, and everything was cooked well. I enjoyed all of the above listed items. My one criticism is the dishes all seemed to be missing one little element that could make the food even better. 


Maybe some fish eggs to top the uni custard? Maybe something crunchy to top the mushroom porridge? Maybe a house made aioli for the fries?

Although small in size, the oysters were probably my favorite dish. They were fresh and seasoned so well with lemon and ponzu. 

I also really loved the uni custard. The texture was almost like silken tofu but it tasted so good! There was some shrimp in there and some other goodies. 

I really Enjoyed my self as did my friend. We both left super full from for a total of $40. I can't wait to come back to get some more of the delicious oysters, super comforting mushroom porridge, and that special uni custard.

Maybe it's because we had the place to ourselves, maybe it was because our servers only waited on us, or maybe we just got lucky. I hope to try the sushi burritos and ramen burger soon.

The free hot tea was nice.

I hope they add more desserts to their menu.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,3,4,6teNzgLBotUsHSvEyMP0WA

4047759,2016-12-24,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"This was a toss up between 3.5 and 4 stars. When we first got there, they didn't look all that busy, but they only had space at the bar. Because it was just two of us, that was fine. It took them a while to greet us, even though several people walked right by us, but that was fine.

We ordered a few types of yakitori, a chawanmushi, beef ponzu, and shrimp yaki udon. I will say that everything was good on flavor, 4.5 to 5 stars for taste. My only gripe was the yakitori with plum, which was clearly bottled plum paste that I use at home and on the hiyayako (tofu) they definitely used ginger paste instead of fresh grated ginger. 

The reason why I was torn between 3.5 and 4 stars is because of the service. It was slow and the order the food came out in was so random. We got one of the yakitori then our main dishes then another yakitori. About 3/4 through the meal, we got our final yakitori. After we finished our meals, I inquired about the chawanmushi. It finally came out, 45 minutes after ordering, and wayyy after we had finished our meals. It was definitely delicious, but it was kind of sad to eat it at the end of the meal. We asked if we could get the free ice cream for checking in on Yelp. The waitress asked if we wanted green tea or vanilla. I ordered vanilla since my bf doesn't like green tea, but they brought us green tea anyway. I love green tea ice cream, so it was fine, but I felt bad for the bf. At least twice, two different people brought us things we didn't order and we had to tell them that wasn't ours. 

Overall, it was a good meal at a reasonable price, but I think there are better izakaya type restaurants in the valley. When we left they were super busy and had a huge line.",JX664wf6R8G-VfA4NhrePA,0,0,4,g6U4gtC0x-ylJNlFo5DQZQ

4061513,2017-07-18,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Visited on a busy Friday evening around 9:30 PM with my foodie niece and her grandma.  Japanese tapas sounds like a win win for us.  Let's go..!

Service: 3/5  We stopped in without a reservation and the place was packed.  We were seated withing 20 minutes, not bad at all as the restaurants total capacity is only 70.  The waiters were very friendly and were extremely busy.   We sampled a lot of dishes and they got the orders correct and to us as soon as it was ready.  The food was brought out timely but it was hard for them to keep the drinks fresh on a hot Friday evening.  

Food: 4/5 We had a blast trying sampling a lot of food.  Here are our highlights from this visit.
Yellowtail Carpaccio: $8.95 Kicked off the evening perfectly.  Fresh and tasty to get you ready.
Ramen Burger w/ fries: For $9.95 this was a very heavy entree with fries.  Very well put together and tasty.  I will most likely order this again if I don't hit up the Udon
Tempura Udon: Great broth and noodles and a good serving for $8.95
Sea Urchin Dumping: $8.00 gets you 3 very filling Sea Urchin dumplings.  I was a little worried that this might not turn out well. The risk was worth it, very tasty and highly recommended!
Sashimi Bowl: $11.95 very nice sampling that my picky niece was happy with.
Chicken fatty heart: $2.50 to try and was good, different texture but still tasted like chicken. 

Value: 5/5 We took the route of ordering tapas and entrees and everything was very reasonably price for the quantity and the quality of food.  The tapas/a la carte route gives a lot of options to try numerous dishes and keep the evening relatively cheap, love it!

Ambiance: 4/5 The Japanese decor and vibe made me feel like I was in Tokyo when I visited a couple of years ago.  Even down to the cramped seating as real estate is limited in Japan and many of the restaurants we visited we setup like Izakaya.  I saw as many as 6 people seated in the booths and smaller tables that seated 4.  I hope you feel comfortable with who you're dining with. =)

This is my current favorite place in vegas to get that Tokyo dining experience I enjoyed so much when I visited Japan.  Good food, great selection of dishes to try and all for a reasonable price.  It gets crowded quickly so you have to be strategic with planning a visit and be ready to sit down for awhile.  Nothing some sake and beer can't handle to help pass the time with your close friends as you sit together close af.  Enjoy..!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,3,2,4,Oghxlj8c1RnOK4xT3IehSA

Decor: Small, quaint Japanese restaurant near Kuma Snow Cream and Starbucks. The place was nicely decorated and had a decent amount of seating. They even had a seating area in the middle where you could take off your shoes and sit on the floor to eat (with cushions of course).

Service: We were seated almost immediately after entering the door. Our server was very nice and always checked up on us, refilling our drinks, asking if the food was okay, giving us extra napkins, etc. I think he was the owner, too. I never had a problem with anything.

Food:
My mom got the Grilled Saba dinner plate and she said that it was very delicious ($10.95). Overall, the food was excellent and so worth your money.
I ordered the ramen burger ($8.75) and it was heaven on earth. The pork was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth, the grilled egg was a nice touch of flavor, and the grilled onions were perfect. Although a bit messy to eat (I had to use a fork and knife because my mouth was too small for me to just bite it), it was all worth it. Everything was perfect and I'm still salivating over it as I'm writing this review.

I'm so happy I finally got to try this place out. I can't wait until I get to return! I'm dying to try their sashimi!",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,3,2,5,6cp4OU6m0dsrX1pI5NSZ4g

We got seated at the big table. We shared it with 3 other ppl, but my bf and I were on the other end so it wasn't too awkward.

So for the both of us, we ordered:
1 lamb chop
1 tiger shrimp
4 pork bellies
4 beef tongues
Takoyaki
Pork gyoza
Ramen burger and fries 
Half miso ramen with spicy on the side

LOL. I let my eyes order bc I was clearly full before finishing all this food.

The skewers were all wonderful! Priced between 2.50-4.95. For some reason, my first round of pork belly tasted better than my second, but it was still fatty & delicious! The beef tongue was my favorite, but it's always my favorite to order. I could've skipped the shrimp, and the lamb chop was very tender and juicy!

The takoyaki was amazing :) it came with their takoyaki sauce and I'm going to guess mayonnaise? But altogether probably one of the best I've had!

Their gyoza was good too! I've been on a gyoza kick lately so it really fulfilled my appetite. It came with 6, and if I wasn't with my bf, I would've eaten all 6 of them to myself. 

The ramen burger is prolly a 3/5. It's messy, too soggy, not as flavored as I'd like. If I were to come back, I probably wouldn't get it again. The fries were good tho!

And the ramen itself was good. I had the spicy on the side, but I ended up adding it in after. It was good! Loved the actual noodles themselves. It came with the same toppings as with a regular ramen, just a smaller portion obviously. So I still had egg, pork, seaweed and bamboo which I highly appreciated for it only being 5 dollars. 

All of that food for only 60 bucks!!  All in all, I'd be back bc I love Japanese tapas and their happy hour :) just skip the ramen burger.",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,0,0,4,madC_bgWhEMGE5lStWgGUA

4184760,2017-07-17,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Food-wise, this is a fantastic izakaya. The menu is full of interesting things I have never tried before, from the shark cartilage and yam to the uni chawanmushi. Yes, they were out of many things even on a Monday (which is when everyone here seems to recommend coming for maximum freshness/availability), but there were so many things to chose as back-ups that there was really no disappointment at all (except maybe missing out on the uni dumplings - we'll be back for that!). Be ready to make substitutions!

The drink menu and presentation was somewhat lacking for an izakaya. They have a decent sake selection with many unique sweet options, but no shochu and a rather lackluster beer/wine selection. I think based on other reviews and info online they may have a decent Japanese whisky selection, but it's not well presented/curated on the menu, so unless you're sitting at the bar, I guess you have to ask for more detail. 

Minus another star for atmosphere and parking situation. I know, it's Vegas, whatever, but the staff didn't need to encourage the creepy misogynistic bachelor party going on at the table next to us by taking shots with them and obliging their requests to show them their tattoos, etc. There are plenty of more appropriate places for that stuff in this town. And then parking: despite the location in a rather ugly strip mall with what looks like it should be plentiful parking, we had to drive around the lot a few times to find a space, even on a weekday. When we finally got a space, we saw that all the spaces were marked as ""80 minute"" parking. Seriously? In a strip mall?!

4185056,2018-01-07,2,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Izakaya Go is a relatively small Japanese joint designed for a drinking crowd. With a variety of food types and sizes, just about everyone from the extremely hungry to those just wanting a beer and some sides can find what they need.

That being said, with such an extensive menu, everything is about average when it comes to quality and flavor, which should be expected given the size of the restaurant. Just from a structural point of view, a menu this size in complexity would struggle with a crowd that they serve. Don't get me wrong, I was reasonably happy with the food we received but wasn't blown away enough to signify a higher rating. 

The drink menu is also quite extensive, so everyone you are with should be able to find something for them. 

Granted, this place is quite busy and I expect that reservations should be made if you're hoping to get in without an extended wait. The staff is definitely friendly, although could be a bit short-handed sometimes with the few people covering the whole restaurant. 

Bottom line, Izakaya Go is a good choice for those with groups of people with varying food desires or a group wanting to try a variety of Japanese style foods.

Not so sure if they are kept alive, but it didn't seem like it since they did not have a fish tank on display to show the activeness of fish. Another kind, the server explained it to be a tougher texture so we ended up ordering a regular 5 kinds sashimi. The halibut was really fresh, and so were the rest. The tuna could have better color but when I tasted, it was still very tasty and soft. We also got blue fin tuna carpaccio with cruncy garlic, yummy!!! It was really red and almost melted in my mouth. Tako wasabi was a generous portion. Shitake mushroom and tiger shrimp skewers were worth every penny, but Kyara definitely has better ton-toro skewers.

What I ate: 

Steamed clams in garlic soup/sauce- 5 star. SOOOOOOO GOOD. I don't even like clams very much and LOVED this dish. The clams were cooked to perfection, and the garlic soupy broth just makes this dish stellar. I think I could eat 5 bowls of this. 

Yakisoba - 5 star.  I've had so many different Yakisoba's in Japan. This one was very good. Unlike most places, it had a ton of veggies, and a couple pieces of really yummy pork. MAKE SURE YOU GET IT WITH PORK, not chicken or beef. 

Fried octopus- 5 star. Everyone at the table loved this dish. It's crispy and delicious. 

Chicken porridge (chicken zosui)- 3  star. This was good, but I have had better before. The broth could have been a bit more flavorful. 

Spicy miso ramen- 3 star.  It was good, not extraordinary. The spice level if average, and the miso flavor is a bit weak. But hey, this ain't no ramen place. 

Halibut carpaccio with uni on top- 3 star. I thought this was an OK. Some other people liked it so, it could be a personal preference. 

Salted chicken wings- 3 star.  The chicken was a bit hard on the inside, slightly over cooked. I loved the outside flavoring. Make sure to sprinkle some SICHIMI (Japanese red pepper) on it, and it will be a game changer. 

Miso salmon sashimi- 2 star.  I wasn't particularly fond of the flavor of the miso. 
Spicy tuna on crispy rice- 1 star. I personally did not like the flavor of the spicy tuna at all. 

Service- 5 stars.  I'd come back here to try more items, as the menu is extensive. The service was on point, and it's a nice place to come with a small group of people (up to 4).

Sashimi of the night (25, 35, 45$ options) To eat between two people as a tapas plate (don't expect this to be that filling) the 25$ was perfect. 
Karaage: skip it. Over fried, over burnt, no flavor. It was closer to KFC chicken then your traditional Japanese style karaage. 1/5
Takoyaki: The tako wasn't the best quality, but it was good. 4/5
Okonomiyaki: There aren't very many places you can order this at. It's like takoyaki batter, but pancake style and with different seafood/vegetables in it. I preferred to okonomiyaki to the takoyaki. It was also a way bigger portion for the price.

It was crispy, full of flavor, and tender. 

Karaage Fried Chicken 4/5 
Crispy, very flavorful but there was a lot of fatty parts. The dipping sauce was very good.",NFodPTpbWK7dSymxaBiUXg,0,0,5,Q3PiN-p7ZZ3r9iyjYB6Akw

The main reason why I wanted to give this place a one star was because the main dish I ordered was not worth its price. I had gotten an order of takoyaki (which was very delicious) and an order of the chicken karage dinner plate. For me it was not necessarily bad but it was not as good as I thought it would be. As for the quantity, I had only gotten 4 pieces of the chicken karage. I was disappointed that I had paid $12 (not including tax) for this. Even though it comes with a side salad, one scoop of potato salad, a small tofu side dish, rice and miso soup; it was not worth the price for me. I feel that if it came with 8-10 pieces of the chicken karage then I would be ok with this. For me the three items that hit it for me were the miso soup, the rice, and the takoyaki which is sad to say. (I have a picture that I took of the dinner plate but for some reason I cannot upload since I am using the app on my phone. Will update soon)

Probably will not be going back there.",IKhjVzxLBMKt4csOs1wo5w,0,0,2,pDXX9AOIal64zUPbEOO9GA

I'm a southern Californian who is a self-proclaimed foodie. I refuse to eat bad food.  I'd rather starve.

This is the place I'd go back to EVERY TIME I go to Vegas, FOR SURE.  

We went to this place around 3 AM.  It's really odd, but I honestly thought a lot more places would be open on a Saturday morning at 3 AM in Vegas, but I was wrong.  This place closed it down at 4 AM so we barely made it.  

What I love love love about this place:

1.  Freshest sashimi I've ever had.  In an inland state????  How is that possible?  Ok, I've never had sashimi in Taiwan when we went last time and I've never been to Japan.  I stand to change my mind when I actually do that.

2.  The best ""Happy Hour"" menu I've ever seen in any place.  Period.  And for whatever reason, at 3 AM, Happy Hour was still going on.  Fine by me and my big mouth!

3.  Exceptional service.  I felt we were very well taken care of even though this place was PACKED.

I can't wait to go back to this place.  Seriously.  I don't go to Vegas very often, but I for sure will be coming here the next time we stop by.",NLCaCHNVMmQPakXpWIF_sQ,3,2,5,4ZMHVzhjweQ7VWf22QuYlA

So upon ordering, since the place is new, the server wasnt really knowledgeable of the menu .. 
dont get me wrong, SHE WAS SUPER NICE.  

So our food took SOOOO LONG. we got 4 dishes and waited 40 minutes for everything to get delivered, in addition to that, one of the order was wrong..  (they had 6 tables) & the only good thing was that she frequently checked on us. Although when it was time for the check, we had to ask like 3 times for her to bring it.  

Dont order the sashimi bowl. Im suspecting that was what made our stomachs hurt. We love japanese cuisine and we could tell by the first bite that the fish were not fresh at all.. this place need some work.

It didn't really taste fresh & i couldn't finish the whole thing. I had a bite of the tuna belly steak and that was pretty good! 

If you check in, you can redeem a free scoop of ice cream! You have two options: vanilla and green tea. I had the green tea and it was good! Service was also pretty good.

Firefly Squid- YUM! tiny itty bitty baby squid served raw with a miso sauce.. To die for.. So amazingly fresh!
Poke bowl had high quality tuna, Ramen Burger was savory, the pork cooked to tender perfection.  Seriously considered ordering extra noodle ""buns"" to take home with me to snack on later.

First off, Go is amazing! He's always playing some Rastafarian music and yet, it feels really authentic in there. Go is seriously one of those owners you just have to appreciate. He works hard as an owner and as a server, etc. I've been here so many times, its ridiculous why I haven't checked in every time on here. At one point I made it to go here every week. Hell, sometimes when I leave and they greet you ""goodbye"" I yell back ""I'll see you guys tomorrow!"" And to no surprise, I do come in again the next couple days. HAH! I've told many many people about this place and every single one who has tried Izakaya has loved it!  

I have too many pictures from this place that I can't post everything just yet. As a tip though, study that menu! There is so much on there that its hard to choose. 

So as far as the staff goes, they all work really hard. I love how they all interact and check up on you constantly. They do get busy from time to time to where its hard to get their attention, but it's really not too bad. Also, the ambiance is quite lovely. I love the feeling I get in there. It's so calm and everyone's in their own zone.

My friends have been raving about this place, so I finally tried it with them and I gotta be honest and say that my experience was mediocre. The food was alright, but the customer service would probably be 2 out of 5 stars. So, for my first time, only 3 stars at best.

The happy hour for food and drinks are pretty generous - lots of variety for it just being a happy hour menu. We got the half ramen, curry rice w/ added chicken cutlet, pork dumplings, California roll, and the seasoned french fries. The half ramen, for the happy hour price of $5, was awesome. I'd come back and get this again. The curry rice + chicken cutlet was decent - they got the flavor right, which IMO is most important, but the serving size is tiny (even with the HH prices, there's an additional cost to add the chicken so I expected a bit more). Everything else we ordered was okay, no complaints.

The customer service needs some work. It was a Friday night, and unexpectedly not as busy relative to other places in Chinatown, yet our server took 15 mins to take our waters, then 20 mins for our actual orders. She also ended up messing up our orders (giving us someone else's order so we had to wait more to get our actual order), and giving me back a different credit card back... not a good first impression.

The salmon was wild and fatty (not the orange farmed stuff).  The aji was perfect.  The yellowtail left me licking my lips to capture all of the buttery fatness.  The unagi was more tender than usual, which lent to more emphasis on the flavor, rather than texture (and the flavor was exceptional).

Sashimi aside, the sunomono, especially the ume and the kyuuri were full of pop.

The kalbi ribs were ok.  Probably a little too much char.

The yakitori were all above average, especially the chicken liver and the pork cheek.

What a cool name!  When we arrived, the initial response was ""I feel like we're back in Torrance.""  I didn't know what to think or say, but once we all sat down and started with the beers, I knew it was going to be a nice evening!

Located off of the strip, this drinking spot looks like it attracts more locals than ""others.""  This is fine with me since a $4 beer off the strip tastes better than a $12 beer on the strip - especially when you're buying!

Izakaya Go isn't a huge place, but it's not a hole-in-the-wall by any means.  Decorated nicely.  Music was a bit weird but after the third pitcher, the music started sounding all the same.

Food was better-than-good.  We had a few beginner sushi eaters with us and the Uni Shumai was a hit or miss.  Spicy Tuna Rolls, Yakitori, Kim Chee, Tako Yaki, Noodles .. I think we ordered plenty for all to share.  Beer kept coming and the conversation kept flowing.  For a while, you almost forgot that we were in Vegas.  Consensus agreed.

After watching a show, we got hungry, well I wasnt hungry but he was and so I suggest that we should go to Izakaya and grab something light. This place had the best review and it was the closest.

I really liked how small this place was. Thats because if its too bug, it gets too loud and I cant even hear myself talking. That bothers me a lot. Like Hondaya in LA, I have to scream to talk to friends and I can barely hear what theyre saying so, who enjoys that right?

Their menu was very extensive like many other Izakayas. I know yakitori/skewers are people's favorite but we skipped all that and just ordered a few dishes that caught our attention. When I go to Izakaya, I always start with Takowasa. I dont know why but thats just my thing. I love raw food and so Takowasa is just raw octopus smothered in light wasabi. Its very good and you cant never go wrong with this!

Then we started ordering other dishes and one of them was Uni Chawanmushi. Its a very delicate egg dish. Its steamed egg eith some shitake mushroom tooped with uni. It was really soft and flavor was wonderful. Though I dont eat Shitake mushroom, its flavor wasnt too strong so I was able to eat them fine. But I let boyfriend eat the mushroom itself, haha.

Second dish we ordered was what, Zaru Soba? Haha, I love soba and I thought it was a better choice than Uni Pasta or other noodle dishes they had on the menu. It was a small portion but enough to share with the boyfriend. We ended up asking for another dipping sauce so it was easier for us to eat it on our own dipping bowl.

Boyfriend ordered the House Fried Rice. It was very good. It's one of those fried rice you cant really dislike. Just egg and scallion - - thats all you needed to have that great flavor. I really enjoyed it but I can make this home better, hehe.

I think thats all I had that night. We were pretty full from eating them because before the show, we pigged out at a buffet like crazy! It was good food with good ambiance. Price was just right and service was pretty good in general except when they brought out zaru soba, they gave us an empty dipping bowl. I told them it was empty and they couldnt believe it as if I was lying. Why would I lie about that?! 

All in all, food was great and I would probably frequent this place if I lived here. Will come again with friends next time I visit Vegas!",_VD870pQZJPqcGd07vxMsg,10,10,4,8YnaskbjX_73QUo_GrKPcQ

But this time, he relented and boy am I glad he did. We went on a Wed. night, about 5PM and parking was an issue. The only spots that were open were the 30 min. ones, so we picked one right in front where we could keep an eye on it in case security was checking for violations. 

Foodwise, everything was great. Hachi does have a leg up on the chicken skins, because Hachi's is like a chip.. a big fried crispy chicken-y thing of beauty, about the size of a wonton wrapper. Izakaya Go's was.. different, grilled on a stick. The other item was the chicken karaage. The husband liked the IG's version because of the batter (really crispy). I like Hachi's better because while I did like the crispy batter, it was quite salty. 

The standout for me was the clams in garlic/butter broth. I drank the broth. Straight up. It was that good. Either the manager or the owner of the place saw me and said he was glad I liked it.

5198831,2014-12-23,13,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Izakaya Go (Pronounced ""Is-A-ka-ya"") is located in the same plaza right next to Krung Siam in Chinatown. I was lucky enough to have dinner here on Grand opening night even though it was packed and busy. The first thing you notice once you step inside is how well decorated the restaurant is. It just feels very welcoming and comfortable. The menu (sitting on the wall on strips of wood written in Japanese) brings a nostalgic feeling in me as I lived in Japan for almost 3 years.

Once seated on our table. We proceeded to order a vast variety of appetizers and entrees. Izakaya Go specializes in small dishes called tapas similar to what Ichiza offers. We started off with the Miso soup and Edamame (the staple starters in Japanese meals) the Miso soup tasted great and was authentic and the Edamame was a good snack. Then came the Kara Age ""KAH-rah-AH-geh"" which is a Japanese style fried chicken. It is traditionally marinated in soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. I would highly recommend the Kara Age here as it was a perfect balance between flavor, texture and richness.

We ordered the Crunch roll, California roll, Spicy tuna roll, Spicy tuna crackers, Tempura Platter, and Chicken Yakisoba. Everyone loved every dish that came out of the kitchen. The Chicken Yakisoba was one of the best versions of Yakisoba I've ever had. The quality of food is what I would expect as the head chef here has over 20 years experience as a chef from Kyoto Japan.

Located just off Spring Mountain Road, cattycorner to Kuma Snow Cream, it was as part of a group of seven that a baker's dozen plates were ordered amidst the cozy confines of Izakaya Go and although palates I trust have recently offered the freshly opened space high commendations, our experience would prove to be just short of a disaster - the sort of meal that left one wondering how anyone could find such a place palatable, let alone worthy of praise.

Admittedly jam-packed, each seat in the house filled at the time of a 7:30 arrival, it was with advanced reservations that the group squeezed into a makeshift table best appointed for six, and with Izzy and Katie playing a bit too loudly from behind the bar a large menu was surveyed as water and hot tea were filled freely - the restaurant fresh out of green, but offering matcha or black over ice at $2.50 per glass.

Optimizing orders so as to cover a large swath of Izakaya Go's offerings it would not be long before first plates arrive and with creamy balls of fried octopus beneath bonito setting an extremely high bar it was unfortunate that no other plate would even come close to the quality of those tender fried orbs - least of all the grilled collar of tuna that was essentially charred dry leaving one to wonder whether the kitchen possessed any skill or integrity at all.

Essentially ruining a unagi bowl by burying the eel under too sweet a sauce over dried out rice one could say that the crispy salmon skin atop greens mixed with more bonito was the star of round two and with two small bowls of miso soup no better or worse than any other the box-sushi battera was additionally quite good, the savory smack of mackerel finding balance in vinegar and shiso, both.

Admittedly impressed by lightly fried agedashi tofu in more of the miso broth, but less so by fried chicken that was nearly as much batter as bird, it was onward to par-for-the-course egg custard that the meal progressed and with the previously forgotten tuna belly arriving with texture similar to the collar at the meal's beginning a single bite was more than enough for most - nearly half of the $12 order remaining on the table at meal's end.

Rounding out the evening in three bowls, the soba literally flavorless even when dipped in dressing while tempura served alongside was fairly competent and entirely full of grease, it was only at the meals end that both the mushroom porridge and hot udon topped with sticky yam would approach the level of the Takoyaki, but at this point bored with belabored service and annoyed by so much mediocrity all one really wanted to do was 'go.'

Perhaps suffering from high praise begetting a full house, maybe besmirched by a grill burning too hot, or - and I hope not - possibly deeming our table expendable as we were the only Caucasians in house the only real positive of dinner at Izakaya Go was the friends involved and $30/pp price - nothing save for the Takoyaki better than can be found elsewhere on Spring Mountain without the pop music, sub-par service, or overall lack of quality control.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,2,HC0AMnVcWX9dBShdRxkCnQ

Environment: The restaurant itself is located almost in a hidden location in the back of a plaza near the main Chinatown center. It can be a little hard to find, and the restaurant itself is not too big. However inside they make use of their small allotment of space and have booths, tables, sushi bar seating, as well as a large middle area which could be used for big parties. Additionally, the decorations and lighting make the restaurant fun and cozy.

Food: Their menu is very expensive and ranges from sushi and sashimi to kushiyaki. We could try carpaccio, skewers, oysters, rolls, and much more. The sashimi was very fresh and the oysters were delicious. Additionally, we tried chicken heart skewers which were surprisingly good as well.

Service: Service was good as well, with our server being sure to stop by periodically throughout our meal to check up on us and ask if we would like to place anymore orders (which we usually did).

Overall Izakaya Go is comparable to my favorite Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, Ichiza, and I see myself coming back to dine here again.",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,5,DqnoI3yDRjOf4km09G1Wfg

This is located in Chinatown. We got seated right away and I noticed one of the Japanese diners who runs a Japanese restaurant in town.

Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab:
Served with ponzu sauce. The batter was light. 4/5

Gindara:
Grilled miso black cod. Light, mildly sweet, smokey fish that simply melts in your mouth. If you like simplistic dishes, this is for you. 5/5

Beef Tataki:
Tender slices of beef sashimi served with ponzu sauce, salad and roasted garlic on top. 5/5

Sashimi Salad:
Spring mix with hamachi, tuna, salmon, whitefish and shrimp with ponzu garlic dressing and spicy mayo. Perfectly dressed. Protein to greens ratio was just right. 4/5

Salmon Skin Salad:
Greens, salmon skin, bonito flakes and yuzu dressing. They were generous with the salmon skin. The salmon skin looked super crispy but it was not quite the case. 4/5

Sea Urchin Dumpling:
Out of the dishes we've tried, this one was the most disappointing. Steamed wonton with what seems to be egg inside with a bit of uni on top. The flavor and texture were weird. 1/5

Sea Urchin Sashimi on Wooden Tray:
From Santa Barbara, CA, this tray of beauty and perfection is served with nori, wasabi and special soy sauce. Very fresh and buttery texture. 5/5

Uni Pasta:
You may have had the same dish from a Japanese trattoria a few blocks away.  I think this version is better. Pasta in very creamy sauce, uni floating on top and nori shreds. 5/5

Ikamaru:
Grilled squid served with Japanese mayo. Slightly chewy. 3.5/5

Grilled Tuna Belly Steak:
It's nice to have a casual restaurant that serves this. I love this stuff. Flakey, tender and smokey fish that you dip in ponzu. 4.5/5

The prices aren't bad. Apps and entrees anywhere around $4-15. The service was very good. I think everything we've had so far have been delicious except for the uni dumpling.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,11,5,4,uhW4FtZeIf1bUYi5A3wxSQ

It was a good recommendation since we were able to get there around 12:00 am.  The place was pretty busy considering how late it was.  I was surprised to find a happy hour menu.  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  There was three of us and we only spent 50.00.

We got s special hamburger steak Japanese style.  It was beef and pork patty it was thick about an inch and very juicy.  It looked like a loco moco but the gravy was different it tasted like they put Worcester sauce in it not the brown gravy that you get in Hawaii. It was not served with rice just carrots and potatoes.  This is yummy yum yum!

The spicy tuna rolls were yummy yum it didn't look like tuna color more like salmon but it was delicious. We also got the poke California rolls.  Then we also got the curry with pork tonkatsu, this was yummy.  

We got the fried tofu and it was not as crispy as I had before but the taste was sweet and savory.  They put a lot of seaweed shavings and it was what made it delicious.  

We got the pork ramen with miso soup.  It was not too spicy as requests.  The noodles were pretty chewy.  The soup had a taste of sake or something like that.  I didn't like it as much since I don't like alcohol. 

The service was pretty good and they turn the lights for if you are celebrating a birthday.  They play a happy birthday song.  Reminded me of days when we w.rook our kids to Farrell ice cream.",IVTJIQEWwgZZBZjVtguJDQ,1,2,5,uoSstgFDKjM6gtOnW_s4dA

What I have ordered:

Ramen Burger - Instagrammable as fuck...better than most ""Ramen Burgers"" i've had and they have slabs of pork belly in the middle instead of a burger patty like most places.

Gindara - One of my favorites with that fatty, buttery, sweet flavor of the Alaskan Cod. Fire.

Okonomiyaki - not the best i've had like the now dead Gottsui in LA (RIP) but respectable enough to get it every single time i'm there....

Omakase Delicacies - 3 small tastings of 3 different delicacies for the adventurous mothafuckas...all i can say is that two are ok but the shark cartilage...fuck that...

Miso Marinated Salmon Bowl - another item we basically get every damn time...fire

Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab - not a fan of soft shell crab because of the texture of basically feeling like you chewing on your nails...

Spicy Fried Rice w/ Jidori Chicken - it's a given, if you fuck up fried rice you def should not have a restaurant...again another item we order almost every time....

Tuna Belly Steak - Good fat portion however lacking flavor and would rather eat most seafood raw....

Skewers - Great selection and flavor

Curry Rice & Beef Steak - Not the best curry in town but the best steak that is paired with curry for sure...especially for the price for happy hour...

Karaage - I grew up on this style of fried chicken...not the best but good enough to satisfy my craving for it...

Dango - Dessert mochi balls that are fire...

Yuzu Cheesecake - subtle yuzu flavor...

I know there is a lot more items we have ordered just can't remember them all...

Our fat asses ordered a slew of plates: albacore roll (all his), crunchy roll, rice porridge, chicken teriyaki combo, and a ramen burger. I'm not sure I've ever had such flavorful chicken teri in my life, but this was a bomb in my mouth. The sauce in the ramen burger tied in how flavorful the meat was--which was a pleasant surprise considering my expectations of the thing were low. 

My only problem was one of our servers. He had a lack of energy when taking our orders and asking questions that it dented my experience. Never a fan of lazy service.

We ordered the Horse Mackerel $19.50. It's essentially sashimi. They slice the fish into site size pieces and use the bones and head to dress up the plate. When you are done with the dish they deep fry the bones and you can eat them. Very nice and crunchy. 
Omakase Nigiri $65. We were serves 12 pieces in total. Everything seem to be freshly caught that afternoon (even though it wasn't)
Tuna Belly (Toro) was flown in from Turkey (600lbs tuna). Super buttery.

Thankfully a friend and my other half who ordered the sets let me indulge; missing small slices of ham and a bit more salt but it sent me to the Asian market to get some Kewpie mayo to make one of my favorites :) We will continue to search out our 3rd Japanese place since we've been here the last two have gone out of business, perhaps they should have had higher all be it reasonable prices like this place and they would still be round; but we wouldn't object to coming back at some point.",H5Asta4LpiKmRhSjWaogIg,1,0,2,qmh-oz1P23LgbsacAxzSKQ

Such a tiny restaurant and they do get very busy. I ordered their popular dish of Uni pasta which had so many pieces of uni in it. 

Also ordered the Tuna belly steak for happy hour which was a lot with a side of rice. My girlfriend ordered the Slamon dinner combo which came with so many side dishes for only $11. 

Everything was great and the staff took great care of their customers. Will come back for my late night cravings since they close really late Til 3am on weekends.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,4,0,5,PeENd_PhretT48KOlu4Bpg

And I've actually ordered that much is because the owner and waitress actually pushed me to try new stuff.  When the food is so consistent that you do not want to ""experiment"", we have all been to those restaurants.  This isn't one of those.  

Actually, one little caution, ramen is ok, there are specialty shops in town if you are into ramen.  Then again, I don't have to tell you not to go to an izakaya and order ramen.  That's like going to a Pho place and order rice.  Go with their specialties, izakaya, grilled, fried little dishes.",fcWwf97oGGDvZj_OrpAfKA,2,2,5,jw4xzpBKg_YjD_Yj24Y9Ug

5645120,2015-11-21,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"First review on my Yelp since my other account isn't usable anymore. So I thought to make my first one on a restaurant that I consider my favorite as of right now. 

I have been dining at this restaurant for about 3 months now and I come at least once or twice every week with my best friend. The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm at home and the staff is very friendly. What makes me happy is that some of the staff remembers our faces and makes us feel so welcome whenever we come in. 

As far as food goes it takes a while to look at all the menus they give you, but a handful of items are my favorite out of any Japanese restaurant in town. 
Pork cheek with scallion: $6.25 and the dish I get the most. You get several of slices of meat for such a low price! Fatty, crunchy on the outside, and the lean parts are just as tasty. 
Beef tongue skewer: $2.75. my favorite out of the skewer list they give you. Very juicy and they pack the meat onto one skewer. 
Enoki butter: $4.95. Enoki mushrooms drowned in warm butter. They give you a lot for less than $5 and goes hand in hand with the items I listed above!
Salmon/yellowtail sashimi: both less than $6 and they give you 5 pieces for each fish. Fresh fish and decent sizes. 

Service, food, atmosphere, everything about this place is amazing and that's why it is my favorite restaurant in Vegas so far! Also, if you check in on Facebook you get a free scoop of ice cream! I still have yet to try a lot of things on the menu but I highly recommend everything above!",F349NTO-f_Xgg0CHnwKzBQ,2,2,5,0fkqkceOk5N6scSlO6tmbw

5679421,2015-07-16,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"WOW! Talk about food-gasms! Tucked away in the far left corner of chinatown, this restaurant is a hidden gem among the many asian establishments on Spring Mountain Road. It seems like they have everything here in terms of Japanese cuisine! What initially attracted me to this restaurant is that their menu is very unique. I can promise you that you won't find many of the dishes here at other establishments. Prices are affordable and realistically reflect the quality/quantity of food that you are getting. I love the authentic atmosphere of the restaurant. It feels almost like you just walked into a restaurant in Japan! The entire staff are very courteous and polite which only adds to the restaurant's ambience. I must have seen the waiters/chefs bow their heads seven or eight times to other guests throughout my entire meal. I also love how they have a large dining area in the center of the restaurant where there are no chairs available and guests dine by kneeling on cushions laid on the floor (just like in Japan!). My brother and I were feeling adventurous tonight so these are what we ordered:
1. Sea urchin dumpling: Fish cake with some sea urchin on top, wrapped into a dumpling; steamed. Creamy. Tastes great with their signature soy sauce. My only complaint with this dish, of course, is: it could use more sea urchin.
2. Chutoro: Simply fresh & delicious. A bit fatty but much leaner than otoro. 
3. Ocean trout sashimi: Reminds me of salmon, tastes like salmon...but it is not salmon. 
4. Ankimo Ponzu (steamed monkfish liver with ponzu sauce): Light, creamy, a bit salty. Not as earthy as you'd expect from your regular liver. 
5. Beef Tataki (beef sashimi with ponzu sauce): This dish was a bit disappointing because we were expecting raw beef but instead we got over-seared meat. Still good, but could be better. Make sure you let your server know that you're expecting sashimi style.
6. Tako Wasa (raw octopus marinated with wasabi): This dish surprised me! The spiciness of the wasabi really enhanced the flavor of the octopus. It is not as slimy as I expected (which is only a good thing). 
7. Sea urchin sashimi on wooden tray: Don't let the picture fool you, there's not THAT much sea urchin because the sea urchin are thinly sliced. It is definitely the go-to dish if you need a little sea urchin fix. Sweet & creamy in flavor.
8. Vanilla ice cream: We got it for free by checking in to Facebook.  Definitely the best vanilla ice cream that I've ever had. No joke. Rich & creamy, reminds me of Haagen Dazs ice cream, except much... much better.",o1wrzpEmzlfAcAwFWdl4dA,3,4,5,eSBCxzbOsFpUPHdKMTyJeg

Everything seem like it was going great until my moms order came out and mines seemed to have a major lag... Not to sure why when I had a sashimi bowl which is faster to make then a combination plate. My mom was almost done with her dinner... Still no sashimi bowl. The owner seen I looked distressed and came to our table. I told him that I was upset about my food not coming out.... He apologized... And about 10 mins later my bowl and our tempura came out. Food was great. Only thing that upset me was the timing of my food coming out late. The owner Go was nice to send over takoyaki... Which I thought was very sweet of him. He came over to check on us and we ended up talking up about all things Japan. The takoyaki here taste just like takoyaki in Osaka. I will be back! Arigato Go! It was nice to meet you! I'll be back.

5796095,2015-10-11,1,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"After seeing many delicious pictures and hearing great things about this place from my friends, a group of us decided to try it. When we entered, we were immediately greeted by one of the staff members and quickly gave us a table. I love the decor and the atmosphere of this place, a traditional feel as you might say. The restaurant is a little small so it packs up pretty quickly as well. 

What we ordered : 
My group of friends and I always have to order a hot sake after a long day. So we ordered the house hot sake. It was stronger than usual, but that's always good! Haha. Ended up ordering two large ones. We always say that hot sake is a warm hug to your body. 

Spicy tuna crunch was really, really, really good. I'm a sucker for crispy rice with tuna. The spicy sauce on it enhanced the flavor a lot more. The tuna and crispy rice ratio, very good. 

The chicken karaage with mayo sauce was pretty good. Boneless and crisp to perfection. Very good  with the mayo sauce and squeezed lemon on the chicken. 

The oysters were full of flavor. The sauce they put on the oysters completely blended well together. Only thing I didn't like about it was the oysters were a little too small for the price we paid for. 

Ahi poke rice bowl was ordered by one of my friends. The rice bowl was a decent size. It could definitely fill you up. A good amount of poke in the bowl as well. The poke was completely fresh. Definitely melts in your mouth. Also comes with a side of tasty miso soup! 

Super go crunch burrito was AMAZING. Consisted of imitation crab, shrimp tempura, and a few greens with avocado wrapped in seaweed goodness.  The portion of this is no larger than a chipotle burrito, but bigger than Taco Bell burrito as the waitress described it which was true lol. 

Ramen burger was good too. Wanted to try it because there are barely any places that serve ramen burgers. Another reason why I wanted to try this place out. It was VERY filling due to the ramen noodles on top of it. The meat was very juicy and tender, full of flavor. To top it all off, the over easy egg with it. Just the yolk dripping down the burger.. Yolkgasm for real! The ramen noodles also had some sort of flavor to it too. So delicious. It also comes with a side of seasoned fries. 

My overall experience with this restaurant? Definitely one of my favorite spots. A lot of variety and choices to choose from their menu. The service was vey good. They were very patient and helpful with our food order since there were so many to choose from! Will DEFINITELY come back to this place to try a lot more!

But seriously, the quality and execution of the dinner items I tried overall was superior to that other established Izakaya restaurant down the street.  The price point is also more consumer friendly.

The lunch menu was okay. But I didn't get to try the ramen noodles, which from the pictures look like they too are on point. 

The Ramen Burger that I ordered was a bit of a mess to eat, but I managed to keep my hands clean by donning a pair of latex gloves. However, the big pieces of raw green onions should be grilled or left out entirely. The fried egg with the runny yolk center enhanced the burger. The seasoned fries was pretty good, but I normally skip the fries (I try to save those calories for other stuff like matcha cheesecake or Thai Iced Tea).

The Poki ""Burrito"" was decent. The portion is bigger then your typical sushi rolls, and instead of tortilla a sheet of nori seaweed with rice help contained all the ingredients in an easy & no mess format ideal for on the go consumption.

Their GO Curry menu is good too. I ordered it with Pork Cutlet, and the curry was good but with maybe just a 1 on the spiciness scale.  I have not asked, if there is an option to make it spicier for those that are into the burning mouth game.

For dinner, we ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Plate, which I thought was a great value and was delicious. My fav Asian friend gave her thumbs up approval.  In spite of initial hesitation, she also enjoyed the Grilled Miso Marinated Alaskan Black Cod. 

The Chicken Kara-Age was decent, as well as the Geso (Baby Octopus) Tempura. But the star of the evening was the Uni Chawan Mushi. Seriously good.

Service was good, especially considering that they have just barely opened.  But I have not been there yet when the restaurant was packed and the servers are truly tested.

5950563,2016-03-05,0,dxeu5YQIzw0jOp1cSVkimg,"Coming from Denver, this place is definitely more unique. This has more of an ambiance much like what you would get in Japan: hole in the wall, hard to find, but damn oh so good.
We had my friend with us who never ventured past a California roll. He was willing to try something way outside the box and this place delivered with full stomachs and happy faces.
As soon as you walk in you know and feel like this is the real deal. The loud conversations from other patrons will right away tell you that what they are eating and drinking has a positive impact in their mouths and they are enjoying each and every bite. This place is small so if you have a large group, be ready to wait. Smaller groups tend to he seated quicker. 
I will try to remember all that we ordered: garlic lemon gizzards, pork belly, tuna belly, cow tongue, spider roll, dragon roll, Unagi roll, sashimi 5fish plate, and Uni. My favorite was the Uni but the rest comes in a close 2nd. Everything we ordered was made to perfection and there was nothing we could complain about. This restaurant made my friend a sushi fan and more than ever willing to try more exotic dishes.  
Next time We are back here we will definitely come back. But we will be ordering  different things on the menu. Only to explore other items that we anticipate will only gratify our pallets.",d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg,4,3,5,98tEVKA9FmBFeilM96styQ

The soft shell shrimps and soft shell crabs were delicious. The blue crab salad was also tasty. I don't recommend the chicken items we had the chicken karaage and chicken yakatori they were both over cooked and dry.",kXns988xCxJJvc_P-w5bNg,0,0,4,6SVbYUyej6iACB5fKsXogA

It's a simple dish, but they prepared and cooked everything perfectly. We also got the ten zaru soba. The tempura was extraordinary! It was so crispy and even when dipped in the sauce had a perfect crunch when eaten! They were very accommodating and helped us get extra tororo (grated yam) for the ten zaru soba. Great service as well. Never had to ask for a refill or call them to get their attention. Excellent!

Service: the lady forgot my order couple times. They didn't come around the tables that much. 
Food: Yakitori was really bad. I have never been to a yakitori place as bad as this place. The meat quality was bad and the taste was awful. The miso soup was meh. All of other food we ordered were meh.
People who gave this place 3 stars or more should go out and try REAL Japanese food.

Let me start by saying you can can get just about anything Japanese that your heart desires. With everything from spicy ramen to octopus carpaccio and everything else in between, the menu is very extensive and never dissapoints! Our go to is pretty much everything off the grill. The okra, mushrooms, scallops wrapped in bacon, pork cheek, beef tongue and korubuta sausage are just a few of our favorites and are always cooked to perfection. 

Another plus, they are open late! However, they do get pretty busy, no matter the time of the day... so call in advance and make a reservation and head on in.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,0,2,5,bN6Lk7RgSj_twkVb9Jbgyw
