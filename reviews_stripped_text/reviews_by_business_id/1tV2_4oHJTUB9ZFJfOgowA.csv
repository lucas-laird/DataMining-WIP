674664,2014-07-02,0,1tV2_4oHJTUB9ZFJfOgowA,"This place was in the food court at our hotel in the MGM. One of the many places we had in the food court. How can you go wrong with chicken tenders? I ordered the 3 strip plate which came with a side. It usually comes with fries but I decided to swap those out with the mac and cheese. It added to the price, but I wasn't really feeling fries at the time.

The tenders were pretty good. Better than a lot of the ones I've had out there. The chicken was fresh, moist and tender. Where most get it wrong is in the breading. Some can be too hard and dense. The breading on these were great, not too soft or too hard, just right. Which makes chewing easier. The seasoning was good too, I hate when chicken tenders are too salty, but these were also in good proportion. The mac and cheese I got was good as a side and fulfilled my craving, just wish the portion was bigger for it.

Overall, a good choice for a quick bit to eat if you are nearby in the hotel.",MMXwhTMpy9W7rvpltcZglg,0,1,4,j41ObAiZgduN7FYaLVsoAg

Every time I came to Las Vegas I eat at this awesome place I love their tenders the taste the flavor. Also the service well this time I went I got a rude cashier by the name of Alexandra or something like that, but when I got my food serve a friendly lady she as awesome I ask for different sauces and with a big smile she provided to me and also had a great attitude I think she had an awesome name too...Osiris...
I just wanted to write this because is a great fast food place to go to in Las Vegas",KAn71HvIwSyZvkHIlqxnnw,0,0,5,ZF1m8UeNNjcy-ySI3bbppg

Well, this place takes the cake on that one. The WORST chicken tenders I ever had in my life. Thought it was just me, had a few others in my group taste them and we all agreed - no flavor at all. It was just batter and chicken. And some parts of the batter was so thick, that I thought I was biting into chicken but nope - batter. Fries were cooked too long and also flavorless. They're skinny/shoestring fries and should not have cooked as long as they did. Even the sauce that came with it couldn't save it. Save your money, the food here sucks. Unless you crave bland food I would definitely pass this place. Go to Nathans instead.",DgSl_9YlZ1pI3dG_VAeodw,0,0,1,JHyJXzzMT8hKNqcKgJKe7A

1215683,2018-06-22,0,1tV2_4oHJTUB9ZFJfOgowA,"Honestly, this is probably the best Chicken Tenders I've ever had... they're so fresh and tasty. They're fried perfectly and have a crunchy but soft batter - if that makes sense! 
They're located inside the MGM Grand Food Court. It closes at midnight so you can't utilize this spot for late night drunk munchies (bummer!) Price is expensive, but so is everywhere else in Vegas...
TIP: There are coupons on every single tray in the foodcourt, pick them up and save money here. I believe it's a 50% off and a discounted milkshake.",146udnwO4772RFXD1i5ruQ,0,0,4,T2Qjg5R-GGMzPm0t9BFWVg
1459843,2017-09-11,1,1tV2_4oHJTUB9ZFJfOgowA,"I was in need of a quick meal after a long day and there as aass a food court inside MGM where I was staying.  

I'm not sure this place is a franchise since I have never seen this name before.  The cashier who took order was nice.  But the food took over 10min when they had no customer before me lol. How? I don't know.  

Their chicken was soft, and nicely cooked, just what you expect from chicken tenders.  Surprisingly their fries were really good as well.  My co-worker ordered sweet potato fries and those were delicious too.  The dipping sauce they use  is a must! 

Is the price expensive as people say?  Hmm yes and no.  I mean I live in Hawaii so I didn't really find it that bad, and my 9 dollar 3 pieces chicken tenders and fries did fill me up.  I think maybe if the price includes a drink then would be perfect.  4 dollars for a bottle of water is way too much.",mVA4IeYyVKPUWRrN5oplMA,3,3,4,SaLNyZs-gczaS1IkvpPbhA

For $13 I got over salted tenders with the batter that just falls off the meat and the chicken meat is slimy and not to mention how disgusting it is to be served ranch that's house made at room temperature from the counter in solo brand sauce containers... I would have argued that my 5 piece was really a 4 piece and that I was shorted but I considered myself lucky because we could barely finish 1 tender let alone finish 5... long line and a job to get back to prevented me from asking for a refund.. oh well, never again. HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND
I will go completely out of my way to blue ribbon friend chicken at the grand bazaar shops or even leave and get Raising canes just to never have to eat this again...",d-r2DiqbY3cR-GI2F13vAw,0,0,1,JdvE7k1KCdVlC3pCTpgfdA

Well, it was a bit of a disappointment.  The chicken was way overdone and dried out. The sauce was not special and tangy enough for my tastes and the fries were pitiful and soggy.

The coleslaw is sweet and a tad bit overdressed but it's fast food so you can't complain too much. The toast is a classic choice, however, it desperately needs butter and garlic.

I had never seen this place before, but chicken sounded good. I ordered a five piece chicken tenders with fries for $9.95 and a cup of water to share with my boyfriend. 
They give you a pager after they ring you up to come back for your food. It didn't take too long, and when I was called, they were very nice and gave me an extra side of sauce when asked.
The chicken tenders were really good. The chicken wasn't dry, like I expect most chicken tenders to be, and their original sauce is good - although... I don't know what it's ingredients are. Lol.",soXCrtlQ3_z_kBC7OrT-_Q,0,0,4,7l-GcsX7yQPSSdV97zFSjg

A random stranger always walked up to the counter with me wondering about the time it was taking. So, I'm speaking for this guy too...let's call him Bob.
