The gentleman (possibly the owner?) taking the orders was very nice and helpful. Upon asking, he told me that everything was cooked to order as I saw the cook behind him putting each of my super burrito's components on the grill. Their condiment bar had a couple types of hot sauce so I got the pink one made with habanero peppers. 

When I got home and we dug in, we immediately realized how bland everything tasted. In a burrito that had the works: rice, beans, sour cream, pico, steak, chicken, and shrimp, it all melded together as one bland mouthful. This is unfortunately not what I was looking for when I wanted fast Mexican food. I was craving my greasy fix and got what tasted like a health-mex burrito. I figured that the salsa might help, but even that was so watered down, that I couldn't get any flavor from it, and only the spice. I really wanted to like this place because of the customer service and what looked like a fantastic menu, but they really need to fix their seasonings in the food and hot sauce to be more vigorous.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,0,2,l5o021iCTCzdKji9JLAYQw
2798904,2011-05-03,1,YIbsxjyP2jNzoH9RlxaSYA,"The first thing I noticed when I got my tacos was the quality of the meat. It wasn't that fatty, nasty looking crap found at other taquerias. It was lean, quality beef and pork (not perfect, but just enough fat). Other places need to take note... you can't get away with serving that nasty crap and expect people to come back.

I got the three taco special  for $5. That's a bargain, considering it also comes with rice and beans. In typical street taco fashion, each one is served with onions and cilantro atop doubled up tortillas. They could have used more onions and cilantro, but at least there was a good amount of meat on each. Both the carne asada and the adobada could have used more seasoning, but the quality of the meat made up for it.

This little taqueria has only been open for about 6 months. They're located in the same strip mall as Smith's on Tropicana and Hualapai and are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

3.5 Stars (kick it up a notch with the seasoning)",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,6,4,EA2jS_Z9SpIBKYSlnodqOA

The thing Eddie is most proud of is that he ONLY uses ANGUS BEEF. He showed me the bright red color of the meat and how he trims the fat every morning as he's prepping the various cuts for the day.

His carne asada burrito is really good! It's seasoned well so I don't know why others complain that the food here is bland. I was there tonight and saw that they're running a special - $1 tacos. I ended up cutting the burrito in half. It was enough for two meals. Not bad for $5.45 incl tax. 

It's located between Subway and a Chinese place, across from Smiths. I used to go to Roberto's just down the street, but not anymore.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,5,4,4,5wrNSxk7ZHoNym6RNBikPg

This is just what I expect out of a small Mexican diner. good cheap food, you will like it",XkseFApLFVHJXTeMj00W2w,5,4,4,9uJUP9keAfm_ZXzCJQ6uig
4016833,2011-08-11,0,YIbsxjyP2jNzoH9RlxaSYA,"Meh. I've definitely had better. 

We sampled the chicken adobado, quesdailla, and beef burrito. Everything lacked flavor, zing, and goodness. 

Nothing was bad...just bland. Salsas, and sour cream were watered down. Literally. The sour cream was like fluid milk. 

Tortillas were fresh and yummy. Guacamole was good. It'll do in a pinch but nothing to rave about. Definitely didn't have that zesty Latin flavor I was hoping for.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,0,0,2,TmODRqWt11o3OhH-Mur-mg

Everything is always fresh and has great, authentic flavor. Have had the adobada, asada, chorizo, chicken and shrimp. All were tender, moist and delicious. The sopes are great and burritos are a great value. Will continue to come here in the future!",yWHhNCtTULI5CwkowHT27g,3,3,5,-GRi_V7bnvc0chZgXuMxbA

But yea it was VERY bland and lacked flavor.  What a disappointment.. Why work so hard to make everything fresh and to order and not have any flavor in mexican food.  I ordered their wet burrito and btw their sauce was as thin as water and that too was soooo disappointing. 

I will say that this place can EASILY improve and if you, I'd go back but otherwise I'll take my business up the street to Lindo Michocan (however you spell it)",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,2,OnjKEy4nUb8Z3yC2Dy5T6g
