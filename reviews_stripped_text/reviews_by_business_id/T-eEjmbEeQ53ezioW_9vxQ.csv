The service was great! I swear when ever I took a sip of my drink it was instantly refilled! And our waiter and the host  was super friendly!

The food was amazing! Me and my boyfriend started with the meatballs, which were the best I ever had! and we had the steakhouse dinner, which was also the best steak I ever had! The mashed potatoes were excellent. I really wished I had room for desert, but I guess that will have to wait till next time.

The bread had bacon baked into it YUM who doesn't love bacon. The lobster clam chowder was delish and had literally chunks of lobster. The filet mignon was flavorful and tender it came with mashed potatoes that were pretty darn good and asparagus. Although I was stuffed I made room for dessert bc creme brûlée is one of my favorites.

I had the ahi tuna, cooked rare, but it would have been better seared.  My husband had the filet and hs said it was very good.  The mac and cheese was good too, but under seasoned.  Overall, we paid too much for what we got.

I did eat here on a Mystere Dinner Package, so maybe the chefs have the package patron plates on an assembly line..?

Also, the hostess failed to mention that I needed vouchers for the dinner package. So after we'd been seated, the waiter says we can't order until I (waited 15 minutes in line to) pick up the tickets from the Mystere booth. Meanwhile, my date is sitting by herself with no mediocre appetizer to nibble on. The hostess should've known better.

The food was decent, but I've had much better in more downscale joints. Good thing Mystere made up for the unspectacular taste The Steakhouse left in my mouth.",4sEle6Me9KKWXdxuP2idrQ,2,0,3,uyTxHGpD91K8cdsxlk05hg

Located in the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. The facility was nice and the service was decent - my glass of water never saw half full . I ordered the surf and turf  (lobster tail and filet mignon). Now I'm from Dallas so I've had my fair share of amazing steaks (Nick and Sams $35/oz Wagyu from the Kobe prefecture in Japan) and this my friend wasn't one of them. First off I asked for medium rare and it was definitely charred to a medium. Second...did they just completely miss the seasoning? Typically you don't need any but cmon...keep it simple with some salt and pepper at least. The lobster tail wasn't bad, however, I did drown it in lemon and butter so who knows really...hehe.

630262,2009-02-11,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant, so I'll give a brief summary of my opinions.  I consider myself a food snob (ok, food lover and pretty darn good chef as well with culinary training and experience), but when in Vegas, honestly - full service dining is expensive.  What you get for what you pay is a bit out of whack compared to home.  So here goes...

In summary, we were a party of 5, with a 9pm reservation on a Saturday night.
GREAT:  Service - from all employees we encountered.  Timeliness was excellent - seated immediately, food came to us fast. The potato/bacon/cheese dinner rolls - OMG these are amazing, and I'm about to search the internet for the recipe!  Oh, and ours arrived in a linen lined bread basket, so I guess the paper-bag trend is over.
GOOD:  Food overall.  Besides the dinner rolls, nothing was a stand out (as in ""I must must must eat here again!), but nothing was horrible or unacceptable whatsoever.  The prices were typical for a steak house in an upper-end strip hotel.  I got what I expected here.  My steak was cooked to perfection - if it hadn't have been, then I would've felt it a waste of money!
BAD:  Nothing!  Not a single member of our party had anything bad to say!
Can't comment: On the wines or desserts.  Didn't have either.

In summary, we enjoyed our experience at this restaurant and the service made it worth the price.  Sure, there's better food out there, but nothing we had was low quality.  I'd eat there again, however Vegas has so much to offer, that next time I will try somewhere else.",KjeugVpdtMg1Po4wLJYNIQ,0,0,4,UYZVXM_7y5J8-4CAEjsKUQ

I usually review places that I love right away, so that just tells you this was a forgettable experience. We had a large party of about 10 people so we had to get two tables together, which the staff here did accommodate our needs very quickly. However, that was probably the best part of my dining experience here. 

A very abrupt, rude waiter took our order. The food literally took one hour to get to us. By the time it got to us, we were debating on whether leave, wait for the food or butter our napkins and eat THEM instead. I ordered the petite fillet with asparagus and mac n'cheese. For me, the steak was ok but I have had much better at Craft Steak. The mac n' cheese was pretty good, but not fantastic. Definitely NOT memorable. 

They took forever to bring the bill to us when we were finished. It was about $65 - $85 per couple. I wouldn't have paid Black Angus prices for this place. I gave this place two stars, one for the friendly hostess who accommodated us right away, and one for the fresh, crisp asparagus and the mac n' cheese.

981273,2014-03-25,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"We came here because we had found reviews online stating that Phil's had vegan options. 

Upon arrival, there was already a weird vibe from the hostess. We were awkwardly seated and greeted by our server. 

We asked about the vegan options and he proceeded to tell us the steak and fish specials....  

There was one clearly marked vegan item so we both ordered that and a salad without the Parmesan cheese. We asked for everything to be prepared vegan. 

When our salad arrived the balsamic dressed appeared very creamy and white - so we asked the manager to assure us that this was vegan. He called back to the kitchen but did not get an answer so he told us it was boiled with sugar which have it the consistency. 

We still don't know if he was making that up. 

So, onto the meal. 

We both ordered the vegan chicken Marsala. It came with mushrooms, couscous, and sautéed Mediterranean veggies. It was good! The chicken was Gardein and we each had two ""breasts"". The sauce was delicious and the veggies were properly cooked. 

All in all, the dinner was okay-good but the service lacked. I was glad they had a vegan option but not very happy how undereducated their staff was. 

Long story short - we won't be returning due to the customer service. 

Also, while we were there the table next to us was complaining about how their steak was mis-cooked twice. They had their meal comped and left without eating.

I sent it back and the next time it was rare... really rare, so rare only 1/18"" of the surface was cooked. The entire steak was cold and ... rare.

1308797,2008-06-16,1,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"We ate here the last night of our Vegas trip. It's yer basic steakhouse...reminded me of Ruth's Chris....ala carte style which some people complain about but I don't see what the big deal is. 

Started off with their loaded baked potato bread. Not sure of the complaint from another Yelper about it arriving in a paper bag. But I thought it was cute. It was a loaded potato bread with melted cheese and tiny bits of bacon throughout the bread and a sour cream chive butter. I thought it was awesome. I'm a ""baked potato with everything on it"" kind of girl, so I lovveeddd the bread.

My choice was the 8 oz Filet Mignon. I never had it ""butterflied"" before, so I said yes once the waiter explained to me. Not like it could hurt it right? I choice a loaded baked potato as my side and also got a peppercorn sauce for my steak. I was surprised that the ""garnish"" was a whole roasted bulb of garlic. Scorreeee!!! Roasted garlic is the bomb! Why hasn't anyone else served roasted garlic with a steak?? Very nice touch!!! My filet was perfectly cooked and was sooo tender, the sauce was tasty, the baked potato was huge and the garlic added a wonderful extra touch and flavor!

Also had the Kobe Beef kabob which was served on this huge metal knife skewer thing which the staff removed for us. There was yummy onions and mushrooms and an accompanying gravy sauce that they poured over the beef and the mashed potatoes. That was the first time I tasted Kobe beef and man, it just melted in my mouth. Amazing piece of beef!! Also had the broccolini as a side dish which was a huge portion.

We couldn't pass up dessert so we ordered the Coco Puffs with Creme Brulee Ice Cream because I saw a nearby table order it and the presentation seemed cool. LOL! The coco puffs arrived still hot, but they were in the paper bag (just like the bread). Then they poured the coco powder in the bag and shook it all up to coat the puffs and then poured them on the side of the crme brulee ice cream. The coco puffs were like little cake/donut balls. I thought it was a very tasty and cute dessert. The ice cream also had chocolate ball things in it that was a cool touch.

Excellent service and tasty food. I'd definitely come back for dinner on the next trip to Vegas!

For an appetizer, the boy and I both got the lobster and corn chowder. I will definitely give them this one and say that it was very good.  The pieces of lobster were delicious, and the consistency was perfect. The main courses is where it goes down hill. The salmon that I got was extremely bland and gooey. After a few bites I felt a little nauseated. The horseradish hollandaise sauce tasted like watery mayonnaise with absolutely no kick, the asparagus I had on the side was wilted, thin, and burnt. The boy had the 8oz filet mignon which had a weird tin-like flavor about it. I ordered a glass of reisling (the only one on their menu which was surprising) which was tasty, but the server brought it out in a metal container and literally just dumped it into my glass causing it to splash up a bit and create a lot of air bubbles. I don't know how you're supposed to treat wine, I am not much of a wine person, but I don't think dumping it is the right way to go! Now for the reason I am giving it 2 stars and not 1: The creme brule. It may be extremely tiny, but it was wonderful! So creamy and sweet, the sugar on top heated and solidified to perfection.

Our server tried to serve us a $100 bottle of wine and I opted to pick a $40 one instead. So nice of our server to reccommend such a cheap wine.....holy crap.
We asked what his reccommendations were for an appetizer, so we ordered the calamari and bruschetta. Oddly, the bruschetta toppings were separated, olives on one toasted bread, tomatoes on another, and mushrooms on another. It would've tasted a lot better if they were mixed all together. The bottom of the crusts were burned black. A little charcoal to help progress cancer..yum yum. The ceasar salad was a ceasar salad, nothing extraordinary. The calamari was soggy and salty.

Just when I was about to give up on this place and rate it a 2 star, our steaks came out. The NY Steak and Rib Eye came out perfectly seasoned and cooked. The steaks did not need the specials sauces and they were big enough to share one steak between two people. We were pretty full with the appetizers, one salad, and 2 steaks.

I started with the Icebox of the Sea (hold the oysters, thanks).  Beautiful presentation and the crab, lobster and shrimp were each excellent in their own right. I'm a huge fan of cold shellfish and let me tell you these were top quality and perfectly prepared.  DH had the Mixed Field Greens salad which included super large tomatoes that were surprisingly sweet and tasty for their size (you know how sometimes the large tomatoes commercially sold often taste blah and watery?  not these!).

For the entree, DH had the Tortellini Carbonara which he had two things to say about... 1) it tasted very very VERY good and 2) highly recommend to anyone who enjoys this kind of pasta.  The prosciutto was not some wimpy, thin, shaved stuff, no siree... this prosciutto was nice, chunky and full of flavor.  The parmesan cream sauce was full bodied with excellent texture (none of that congealed crud so many places serve up). DH also enjoyed a side of Creamed White and Yellow corn which he said was terrific (he finished the entire thing!).  My entree was the Surf and Turf which is something I order QUITE often in steak houses.  Let me tell you, Phil's was among the very best I have ever had.  The lobster was cooked to perfection with a buttery herb blend that added a wonderful balance.  The filet was cooked perfectly to my liking. This baby truly was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful.

I didn't have any of the bacon bread but DH absolutely LOVED it.  I may have to sample a bite or two next time we go back.

We didn't have any dessert but several of them sounded wonderful (especially the creme brulee, the cheesecake and the tiramisu).

The service was absolutely spot on.  Our assistant waiter certainly did not miss a beat.  My water never got below 75% full... and I drink a lot of water!  Whoever was tending bar knew what he/she was doing as the drinks were plenty stiff (without compromising taste) and not full of cheap mixer.   Our waiter knew the menu and flawlessly answered every question I had about preparation and substitutions.

Next was the Lobster Chowder.  Delicious flavor with huge pieces of lobster in it. Soon after was the salmon with a Dijon sauce, accompanied by asparagus and boiled potatoes.  The asparagus wasn't cooked very well but the salmon was perfect.  The potatoes were a bit salty but ok.  For the cherry on top came the creme brûlée dessert! Absolutely my favorite part of the meal.

We had 5pm reservations and were seated promptly.  We were in a pretty much empty (but quiet and peaceful) section, with the crowd growing as we ate.  Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing, also a bit soft spoken.

Cocktails were yummy and strong.  Husband and I each started with the lobster corn chowder, which was pretty good.  We also got bacon cheddar bread which was awesome, especially with the herbed butter.  I had the menu salmon dish which was cooked well and had a delicious mustard cream sauce.  I substituted garlic mashed potatoes on the side ($3 up charge) which were also great.  Husband had the filet mignon special which included scallops and crab with bearnaise sauce, which he thoroughly enjoyed.

2082796,2009-09-14,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"Ate here on 9/10/09. This was my second time eating here in about 2 years and this last visit we had some mishap's.......SEE REVIEW BELOW. The Steak House is alright. Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless. As far as the prices go, I think it ranks average in terms of other high end/fancy steak houses. I love Ruth's Chris Steak House and this place may be a bit more expensive, but not by much. 

We Ordered: 
Lobster & Corn Chowder - very fishy tasting, but my husband liked it 
Caesar Salad - OK, nothing special 
T-Bone Steak - Good 
Fillet Mignon (8-oz) - Good, once cooked properly......SEE REVIEW BELOW 
Added Oscar Style to the Filet (Crab Meat & Bearnaise Sauce) - sauce was good, but the crab meat was fishy and had a lot of pieces of shell in it 
Garlic Whipped Potatoes - very garlicky and very good 
Mac-n-Cheese - not much flavor and very gritty sauce 

Experience: 
First, we had 3-4 different people as waiter's & server's. Kind of confusing with that many different people for one table. 

Second, the downside is NO Rib-Eye Steak! Well there is for $80, which is a 40-ounce......but me and my husband eat different steaks. How can an expensive steak house not have a rib eye steak for one? 

Third, my filet was undercooked. I ordered it medium-well and it came a little over medium-rare. My husband's t-bone was cooked perfect. 

Fourth (THE BIG PROBLEM), not one of our multiple waiter's came over to our table after our food was brought to us to see how everything was or if we needed anything. 10 minutes went by and still no one in sight! Odd! Finally our first server (who refills water and brings the bread & butter) came by and my husband asked to have our main waiter come to our table. 5 minutes go by and he totally ignores us. Finally my husband yelled across the room at the guy who sets the tables to come over. We told him my steak was not cooked medium-well. He apologized and took it to the kitchen. Not long after, our other 2 waiter's came out to apologize. My husband was about done eating before they had taken my steak back to recook it. It took an additional 15 minutes to bring my steak back out and they forgot the bearnaise sauce with it, but still had the crab meat on top. 

Fifth, It took forever to get the bill, forever for them to pick-up the bill and forever for them to bring back the bil.  I think from start to end, we were at the restaurant for over 2 hours!!!!!

It was very disappointing to go to a nice and expensive steak house and have that type of service. Who wants to eat by themselves while their spouse has already eaten and is now watching you eat? I will not be back here again. There are many other steak houses in Vegas to eat at and that our better!",VFJ27SYOGKUHjnZzWLDp2Q,1,0,2,CGov_S7B-OIW49LFMaV_AA

My dad was the only person who got the Stuffed Chicken which was really good and moist.  The Garlic Scampi was slightly over cooked but flavor was great.

We were not sure where exactly we should eat since we really didn't do much research before hand on the restaurants in that hotel. So after going back and forth between the couple of restaurants that we did see we decided to eat at The Steak House. What a bad decision! First of all the décor was not the typical ""Las Vegas"" style. 

When we received our stale bread (in a paper bag), we thought about leaving, but we were afraid that we would miss the show if we switched restaurants. The French onion soup was average and my steak and lobster were both over cooked. How they could even put that type of quality food on the table is beyond me. I was outraged that they expected us to pay $48 for chewy lobster and well (I mean well done) filet mignon. I tried to make the best of it and not make a big deal (I didn't want to upset my boyfriend) but finally I couldn't take it and told him how horrible it was. I thought he was going to flip out when he tried the food. We complained to the manager about how atrocious my meal was and they said they could only take off $23 (I guess because I tried to choke down most of my lobster). So, if you see this place run as far and fast as you can. Don't waste your good money (average meal for two is over $100) on there ""food"".

The restaurant is simple, clean. You walk in and there is a bar up front, always a good thing if you have to wait for a table or are early and want a cocktail to quench your thirst. The wait staff is friendly. Then came the food. Everything went downhill from there. First off, i wanted to have oysters. Not only did they not have a selection of oysters, they had NO OYSTERS. A steakhouse without Oysters? Sacrilege!!! For appetizers, i settled for the roasted Artichoke. Roasted? Since when do you roast with boiling water? Although they did give 2 good size artichokes, they must have put them in water first thing that morning, and my reservation was at 8:30 at night. It was mushy and pale green. For the main course, I ordered the Surf and Turf- the steak lacked flavor. It's like they pulled it out of the meat section of Safeway and tossed it right on the grill- no salt and pepper. It was almost like eating a wingtip shoe from Florsheim. As for the lobster, i could have played racquetball with it- it was that rubbery. the side of asparagus was suffering from Erectile dysfunction. The Mac n cheese on point, so does that mean the cook worked at TGI Fridays before coming here? I have to give a plus to the wait staff, as they tried to make up for the 1.99 buffet food with a birthday dessert- about the best thing on the menu. 
Being this is Vegas, you would expect to see these guys compete, some of the biggest, baddest restaurants in the world reside here. Then again, maybe seeing 2 other people in the restaurant explains it.",4skBa8p4p7QvpHWwbKxaCg,0,0,2,rZsUDYyByPaJcPC-4ay-vQ

Seriously, it was the best tasting, extremely juicy, piece of pork that I've ever had.  Maybe my cook happened to bring his A-game that evening, but it was *huge* and incredible.

They offered to make a new steak, but we had already waited approx. 25 + minutes for our meal and it was going take another 25 mins to cook, and we were starving so he just ate it.

Let me explain the horrific experience I had here a few days ago... My friends reserved a table as we were getting ready for our evening get together. We were excited to eat a multi course meal in Vegas because we expected the food to be great with at least decent service... our appetizers took more than an HOUR to arrive... I would understand that if it was a complex dish, however we only ordered soup and salads... and we asked multiple waiters when our next dish would come out.. and they both said once they clear our table they can bring out the next course.. it only took them half an hour to realize we were done and another 15 min to finally clear our table. The restaurant only had 5 tables occupied and didn't seem to notice the only table with asians... we asked for our 2nd course multiple times before receiving it... not only because it took so long, but because people who came an hour before us ordered the exact same thing and they finished their main meal before we even got ours... the waiter and waitress weren't even polite or apologetic about it... the addressed others ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" but when we attempt to wave them down... ""it's coming"" or ""like I said, it's coming""... and then they would speed past us... the only thing they would do was occasionally refill our water and half of the amount they pours splashed around... and when we said thank you... we would get a respond like ""mhmm"" or have them say you're welcome in a passive aggressive way. The first time we asked for the manager, he doesn't even stop at our table. As he walks past our table he says ""it's coming""... At this point we are furious, but in fear of tampering with our main dish and dessert we hold our tongues. Before the main dish arrived the couple in the table had to leave and gave us cash for their share. While they were gone we asked them to box up their share since they were leaving. Before we got our food, me and a friend took their seats to be closer to everyone else... for some reason they remember that the people that were gone sat at our seat and put the boxes in front of us and put our dishes on the far side of the table where we sat. We informed them that those were our dishes and they told us they put orders down by the place we were seated. So I had to walk to my plate and replace the warm and heavy plate in front of where I was now sitting... I was angry and had asked them, ""can you please move my friend's plate, because she has a bad arm?"" The waiter looked at me and said, "" you want me to move that?"" I said yes and he rolled his eyes and got the plate for her... since we realized the pattern that each of Our courses took an hour... we asked them to serve the dessert right away because we were already running late... he nodded yes and walked away. You could tell our meat was just thrown onto the plate, disregarding any request we made... for example...  2 of my friends ordered medium rare and they got a combination of rare and medium well slices on their plate... And my friend who is like a sister to me asked for well done and she got nearly rare slices of prime rib... Because we were late to our other plans she tried to eat it... I wish she hadn't because she got sick and threw up later that night... after finishing we asked the waiter for our dessert we asked for before hand and I will never forget the words he said, "" Look... like I've been telling you, we serve after your dishes are cleared"" My friend was outraged, but calmly mentioned how we requested for it out as soon as possible and it didn't happen... and he went back to the kitchen and returned again... another hour later with our food... then we demanded the manager that previously walked past us and only two of us got to express their thoughts... before he told us ""there's nothing we could do."" The only Cajun looking person pulled aside the manager and had agreed to reduce the price of our meal to a certain price... we were content with the news until we received the bill 30min later with $100 more than what was agreed upon by the waiter who was very rude to us but scared at this point... my friend said that was not the price the manager agreed on... and insisted that it was (as if he was in that conversation). Then she said ""let's go to your manager... right now"". He said ""but-"" as she stormed off to find him. After sometimes she came back angry and said let's go... she paid our bill and told us to pay her back later... and we didn't question her because we all wanted to leave so desperately... 

We went to Vegas for a company trip where about 100 of us come to meet each other from all over California. I am the event coordinator for the company but I do not see us coming back solely because of how we were treated...",7roPasW1W-7uAMkwRXXHUA,5,1,1,Oxkjr9HE4ymlMcmlHd6-mA

For starter, I chose the iceberg wedge topped with thick bacon pieces, diced tomato, egg, and drizzled with blue cheese dressing. No fancy field greens or candied walnuts here! A traditional plain good old steak house salad!!! Entree; 6 oz filet with whipped mash potatoes and asparagus. Is this menu from the 80's? Probably, but it's ok because the food was GOOD!!! Restaurants have gone too far. They often try too hard to impress with exotic ingredients or out of the box presentation. Whatever happened to food being good for what it is? FLAVOR, EXECUTION, SERVICE, that's all it takes! I digress. The filet was perfectly cooked to a MedRare. Flavorful without being overwhelming, allowing the steaks natural juices and essence to come through in each bite.  Potato mash was good. Potatoes were whipped with butter and garlic coming on each taste. Asparagus was also cooked perfectly through to the center while maintaining a crispness on the outside.

The Service:  Came in at 10:15.  Was not told the restaurant closed at 11.  Hostess was a fat Russian woman with too much makeup.  I smiled and asked if they did anything special for birthdays.  Instead of, ""I'm sorry, unfortunately we don't but we do wish you a very happy birthday,"" we got a ""No.  Best we can do is a put a candle in your dessert.""  Jeez, that sounds swell.  So we're seated.  A Mexican with a thick accent comes up to us, tells us his name, he's our waiter and his partner is....So we're good so far.  He's offered us bottled water and I ordered soda on top of that.  So we get ""the look.""  You ever go into a restaurant, not order alcohol and get ""the look?""  It's not a nice look and it's also a good way of letting you know your service is going down hill because your tab isn't going to be as large so his tip won't be as large just because you didn't order $50 worth of alcohol.  The one good thing he did do was advise us to order appetizers because the steak would take a long time.

The Food:  The complimentary foccacia type rolls were ok.  A little stale but the herbed butter helped a bit.  We ordered one lettuce wedge that offered pancetta and avacado slices.  Interestingly enough, they brought out two and we were charged for two.  We waited 25 minutes for a 42 ounce ribeye for two with bernaise on the side, a side of creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes.  The steak was very good.  As in very, very good.  Cooked exactly how we like (which isn't easy since we both like it well done but not burnt) and the sauce that it was simmering in was delish.  The bernaise wasn't that good.  It actually didn't taste like bernaise at all.  The creamed spinach was crap.  Like they took a package of frozen spinach and heated it on the stove with some salt and pepper and threw in some milk to make it look creamed.  The mashed potatoes were a little odd.  Really smooth and dense, almost didn't feel like mashed.  They tasted ok but just a really odd texture and maybe a little too much garlic.

Bottom line:  Does anyone really think it's ok to pay $12 for bottled water?  Really?  Really?  Considering that it's Vegas and NOBODY drinks Vegas tap water....The food really isn't worth the price.  It's in bad taste to offer fine dining with the prices to go along with it and only offer  mediocre food and even less than mediocre service.  The Steak House's only saving grace is that the steak was cooked the way we like it.  But $80 for a steak that we liked and $70 on everything else that we didn't like doesn't make us want to go back anytime soon.",Liavg01xIuUtIFBRaxIsaA,1,0,2,0SDBQTjVl6DJvoyiUEmQcQ

They had many options for dinner, whether it was different steak cuts, chicken, pasta, and salads. They also give you bread and butter for starters. We ordered:

-Petite Filet with a Baked Potato, $32.95
-Caprese Salad, $11.95
-Filet Mignon with a Baked Potato, $46.95
-FYI - No substitutions!

The petite filet and baked potato was the perfect amount of food before going out. We both ordered our filet medium-rare.

Started with the Bacon and Cheese Bread, which is a clear win when coupled with the herb butter.  For a couple of apps, we ordered the Shrimp Cocktail and Ahi Tuna.  4 large but not impressive shrimp and a sauce made up the cocktail. The Ahi was pepper crusted to an extreme level, and the tuna was lacking in flavour.  I added a wedge salad, which was a bit different that usual.  It seemed to have a sparse amount of blue cheese, and chopped egg white, with a very salty dressing.

For the main, I ordered the English Cut Prime Rib, with garlic mashed, spinach and a Yorkshire pudding.  There was a onion gravy that tasted more like a mix than anything scratch made.  Unfortunately, there was no gravy on the Yorkshire pudding, rendering it a chewy, hollow biscuit.

The prime rib was reasonably well done, but lacking in flavour.  Some of the salt from the salad could have been diverted!

3416957,2006-07-26,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"I like Treasure Island for its atmosphere and location more than anything. It's not known for its great buffets or variety of restaurants like Wynn, Venetian, or the other huge powerhouse hotels on the strip. I made reservations for The Steak House because the SW Steak House @ the Wynn was fully booked.

The restaurant's atmosphere is very common of its restaurant peers. Morton, Ruth Chris -esque type. Their menu is pretty straight forward. Geared toward American cuisine of Seafood and Steak.

The most notable items on the menu is...

Ice Box of Seafood (Crab Legs, Oysters, Shrimp, etc) - $50
Its variety of Dry Age and Prime cut meat
Variety of additions (Glazes $8-14/each, Sauces $2/each, Side dishes $5-8/each)

For my order, I went with appetizer, soup, and entree.

Appetizer - Fanny Bay Oysters $12/half-dozen
These are medium sized oysters from Washington area. They were quite fresh and slightly sweet. Offered with sliced lemon, cocktail sauce, horseradish, and apple vinaigrette. My only complaint is that when they shucked the oysters...I found bits of the shell mixed in with the oysters while I was eating them.

Soup - Lobster Bisque $10
A little bit different than I usually find in most restaurants. A bit chunky with bits of lobster mixed in, light amounts of sherry, and a more creamy texture.

Entree - 24oz Bone In Prime Cut Ribeye $38
I order my meat RARE, so to some people that might be a bit scary. The taste of the meat changes a lot between rare to medium, etc. I prefer a chewier but very sweet taste of the meat. Rare is pink with a cold purple/pink center. Most places like Outback, Claim Jumper, Lone Star, etc tend to overcook their meats slightly due to serving hundreds of steaks a day or to be safe. Steak house did a great job of preparing and cooking my steak to the T. For the price, its a 8.5/10, just because I think they could have given me a better cut without some strands of tendon, etc in my meat.

One thing I wish I had added to my menu was a few side dishes and maybe their bernaise sauce, but with all that food I was stuffed more than 75% the way through.

Service
The service was responsive and accomodating. We didn't wait long to be seated since I had reservations for 17 but only 9 of us came in the end. Our server's name was Brandon and he tended to our needs and concerns very nicely. A few of my friends shared their dishes and he took care of it to have the sous chefs split and plate everything seperately.

Overall, the restaurant lives up to an above average steak restaurant that you can usually find in most large cities. It keeps trend of business-casual with a nice cut/fresh of ingredients. The only thing that pulls away from it is the quality of food in other restaurants on the strip. Possibly for the same price, a larger menu, and a better cut of meat can be found?

3661031,2017-06-26,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"My wife and I ate here as part of a package for the Mystere show. 
The decor is actually quite beautiful and comfortable, without distracting from the main attraction, the food. 

We arrived early and sat at the bar, where the bartenders were friendly and prompt. We actually tried to go back to the bar after the show, but the bar was full by then.

As part of the package, we offered selections for 1 appetizer, 1 main entree and one dessert each from a specific menu for the package.
 
Appetizer- Grade: A
I had the Lobster corn chowder, it was creamy and flavorful. Personally, I would have liked an element of spice in it, but I understand that not everyone would enjoy that. I emptied the bowl. My wife had the Caesar Salad. She orders these everywhere, but Phil's stood out for its flavorful dressing and she said she enjoyed the whole leafs of Romaine that she could cut herself. I would not have enjoyed the whole leaf salad myself. She did not eat the piece of anchovy on top. I tried a bite and the salad was cold and had a great acidity and zest. As others have posted, they also served a bread that had bacon and cheese. The first one I ate when it was still hot, so it was very good. I ate a second piece after it had cooled and it was not as good, so eat the bread when it's hot. 

Entree- Grade: B
I ordered the Halibut with Shrimp. The Halibut was crusted with breadcrumbs. While not, my first choice for cooking this type of fish, it was very good. But the crust made the halibut eat more like a fish stick. The shrimp were in a creamy sauce that was very tasty. And the beetroot risotto on the bottom was very flavorful. If you don't like the taste of beets don't order this. But the risotto paired nicely with both the halibut and the shrimp. My wife ordered the 6 oz fillet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. She said the fillet was not as tender as she would have liked, but had very good flavor. Overall, she said she said it was very good, but neither great, nor bad.

Dessert- Grade A
After a very good meal, I was pleasantly surprised by the Cappuccino Creme Brulee. If you've never had creme brulee (a cold pudding/custard creme with burnt sugar on top), do yourself a favor and introduce it into your life NOW! For established lovers of this dessert, when you find a good one, it is especially nice. At Phil's, I would describe it like a very good coffee flavored candy, in creme Brulee form. A great way to end any meal. I will also finish by saying that the service was stellar, as we never went more than a few minutes between courses and our glasses never reached half empty.

Overall, I would recommend anyone looking to book tickets to the Mystere show to consider the dinner + show tickets package. I felt that I got my money's worth for a very good meal and an entertaining show. Or if you want to select from the full menu, you could eat at Phil's before the show on your own as it's right around the corner from the box office less than 1 min walk.",adFen4amvoDNMYhKKJ0QkQ,0,0,4,0CgKKVMYpGDzV8JGmdLEoA

My significant other and I started off at the bar on happy hour and I got the margarita and we ordered a flatbread pizza with Alfredo sauce and clams--it was DELICIOUS. I would go back just for that. After we were able to go in earlier than our reservation which was awesome. I ordered the steakhouse experience and he got the ahi tuna. We started out with lobster and corn chowder that is one of the best that I've had. I didn't try the ahi but the risotto with his meal was also some of the best I've ever tried. My steak with lobster and bernaise sauce was to die for. I highly recommend anyone give this place a try.,St77y5_9XYhX4XI2Fll4Ew,0,0,5,P-sE9I7E1fE3KcScdiwPoA

Lobster Louie Salad: 5 stars, perfect textures and symbiotic flavors 
Macaroni and Cheese: 5 stars, very creamy, gooey, and crispy on top! you could tell this was homemade.
Horseradish-Hollandaise Salmon: 5 stars, could not have been cooked better. The sauce was also exquisite.
Med-Rare Ribeye Steak: 5 stars, maybe the best steak I have ever taken a bite out of. Truly cooked to a beautiful medium rare, with enough gristle on top and juices in the middle to make me say, Wow!!!! The color was on, the texture was perfection, and all it had on it was salt it appeared.
Baked potato: 5 stars....for something so simple, it was really good. Baked perfectly and was a great compliment to my meal.


I only wish I could have been hungry enough to try the desserts....with food that amazing, i could only imagine how decadent the desserts!

Also, the wine I had was also good!

We had a nice Pinot Grigio with the food, but did not have room for dessert.

Typical steakhouse menu: The meat was anywhere between $32-$50 depending on your cut of choice, everything was a la carte with side dishes in the $8-$15 range.  Good thing boss man was taking care of the bill...

My 8 oz. filet came out with a whole bulb of roasted garlic - OH YEAH.  Automatic star just for that tasty garnish.  My filet was more of a medium than a medium rare as I ordered, but I was too exhausted and hungry after a 10 hour day of standing and trying to sell to complain about it.

4060915,2015-04-06,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"Came here as part of the Mystere Dinner Show package, which was a table d'hôte menu.

We made reservations ahead of time and our hostess sat us with minimal wait. The waiting staff were great and made sure our food came out fast so we could make our show on time. Even though we ordered off a prix fixe menu, they made us feel like we were like any other customers.

We both ordered the Viognier-semillon, which tasted old for a white wine.. Almost to the point of tasting like vinegar. 

I opted for the lobster corn chowder, which was phenomenal, while she went with the Cesar salad. The salad was a rather sad blend of whole romaine hearts and subpar dressings. I would have preferred to see a plate of chopped bright green romaine with real parmesan shavings in comparison to what we were served.

Our entrees were top notch. Her filet mignon was delightful and the accompanying mashed potatoes and asparagus were done right.
My halibut risotto was very tender and the creamy garlic sauce was delectable. The two shrimp that came on the plate were only half shelled, so tended to be a bit messy as they were covered in sauce.

Our desserts were delicious. We ordered one of each, cappuccino creme brûlée and the chocolate crossing bread pudding. Both were equally enjoyable, but she preferred the creme brûlée. I ordered a coffee (which was not on our table d'hôte menu, +$4.00) and our waiter even offered to put it in a to-go cup so we could arrive on time for Mystere. 

We caught a glimpse of the regular menu and were very pleased with our package deal as this could have easily been a $150+ meal. Do remember to tip appropriately even though you're on a prix fixe / complimentary meal ticket.

Overall, we throughly enjoyed ourselves here and would recommend this option over the others for the Mystere package date night.",C233dctrboV9_x9m_Nf5LQ,1,0,4,7bpNwROcsFDz45Q0FGTyaQ

The bartenders were pretty nice and chatty with their patrons.  And actually very attentive.  

Clam chowder was tasty but serving was really small for the price.  Yes I expected more.  I had it with wine recommended by the bartender.  I already forgot what it was but it sure complimented the soup.  15 min later I was ready to move to another location because I was still hungry.  I leaned over and asked if they have burger and fries.  The poor bartender tried to hide his surprise and laughter but hey I was still hungry.  I ended up ordering french fries minus the burger since they don't serve it there.  Yes, yes; it was a steakhouse, what did I expect, right?  

Going back, I had french fries and a glass of beer.  Being such a lightweight, halfway thru finishing my beer I could hardly feel my face.  And thus ended my first night in Vegas.  Alone but full, with a numb face to boot.",tDAnoZ_XBZPVVP-JiWer0A,0,0,3,8d9zlqOBUf7Fi79Qv08f8g

We came here for dinner after the Mystere show. I wasn't impressed with the food, honestly. I ordered seared ahi appetizer, and was brought a small plate with literally 4 bites of ahi, and a ridiculous amount of sauce. (I would loved to have some ahi with my sauce.) it was something like $20. I'm used to paying less for much more/better quality here in so cal. I then ordered a wedge salad. It was a decent size, lots of tomatoes, bacon, and bleu cheese crumbles, and about a gallon of bleu cheese salad dressing. It was absurd. At that point I was over ordering any real food, because if you can't make a dish as simple as a wedge salad, I'm not confident in your abilities to cook an over priced piece of meat better than I can. I regret not going across the street to Ruth's Chris. 

Ok, so the water story. I appreciate that they kept me so hydrated. Its Vegas, so cocktails throughout the day is just what you do. I was seriously parched and immediately drank my glass of ""tap"" water. (Sorry, wasn't going to be that pretentious and order a pellegrino.) It's like the servers and busses were watching me, because the second I put my still almost full water glass down, they came back right away to refill it. And aggressively at that. They never once spilled, but the entire table was cracking up and surprised  that we weren't given a shower with each refill, which was literally after every sip. Anyway, I guess you had to be there.

The decor is your normal dimly-lit, slightly stuffy steakhouse. The decor is not a hip, trendy place. We were able to get a table without a reservation around 7pm.

Their corn chowder with lobster soup is excellent! There is alot of lobster in the soup. They are definitely generous. The bread they serve is a warm white bread with bits of bacon and potatoes in it.

I got the short ribs, which actually comes with two sides - grilled asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. I was disappointed in the short ribs - the sauce for it was just tooooo sweet. Pair that with the sweet mashed potatoes and you're talking a very sugary entree. I also tried the filet mignion and thought it was average. The broccolini side was delicious and garlicky - I would recommend that for the veggie side. 

Their desserts are all mini-sized and perfert portion to top off a big meal. The creme brulee was excellent! There were little vanilla bean specks on the bottom. I scraped that thing clean!

Salad, was excellent I had the house special. It was unique and had a very refreshing taste. My wife's soup French onion was equally good. The house bread is unique to describe it briefly it was a rustic bacon bread. I liked it a lot but be prepared to slather a lot of butter. The main course was the problem. Both of us order steaks I had a t-bone and my wife had a dry aged steak. Looked good smelled good but taste was lacking. Big time. Although this is not important my steak was cooked to a medium well and I ordered a medium rare. I was not alone another couple had the same issue came medium well wanted medium-rare. When I  got the steak after it was corrected I found it to be just lacking. I base a steak on whether I need to put something on it or not and I was looking for A1 or some sort of steak sauce. Sadly I had a way better tasting steak at Outback. I was expecting a equal if not 100 times better then outback. I took the left overs home because I hate waste and it was not bad or awful just lacking. My wife said you do a better cast iron steak at home then here. That is my reason for 2 stars. I would like to given the restaurant more but I can't justify a higher rating than that for $59+ steak. I will say the bake potato was huge and off the hook good. But I can not rate it on a potato.

We both ordered petit filet mignons and shared a potato dish the waiter had said was similar to potatoes au gratin (but was not).  I ordered bearnaise sauce, on the side.  The plates took a 1/2 hour to prepare!  They were garnished with garlic, to use if you like for your meat.  I've had better filet mignon (Ruth's Chris!) and better bearnaise sauce (The Cut) and the ""potatoes au gratin"" were very salty and tough (Fleming's has a delicious one).  The dessert was yummy, chocolate beignet donuts (very souffle-like) with creme brulee ice cream.  We were so full we didn't finish it!

4856200,2010-09-13,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"I made reservations for Phil's Italian Steak House because I was staying at T.I. and I figured for the price that they were advertising, how bad can it be? 

BAD!

Never eat at a restaurant that is empty on a Saturday night, and I guess same applies, never eat at a restaurant that hasn't been reviewed on Yelp. Prior to making reservations to Phil's I checked on Yelp to see what they were all about, and no reviews. Hmm.. interesting...

My boyfriend and I decided to do their tasting menu. 3 for $30. They also had other combinations that were 3 for $35 and 3 for $45. I had the onion soup, lobster risotto and 5oz filet mignon. The onion soup seems like something you can't really mess up, but I guess you can. The cheese on top was way too thick so instead of getting a nice cheesey crust, it was thick and gooey in all the wrong way. The lobster risotto was forgettable. My filet was probably the best thing I got, but if you didn't tell me it was filet I would have just thought it was sirloin. Got my steak cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. However I wasn't a fan of the seasoning. Too much salt and not enough pepper. And grilled steak?? Pan seared is where it's at! 

My boyfriend got the lobster and corn bisque, sautéed mushrooms and the 10oz kobe burger. He's not much of a foodie so I thought there was no way not pleasing him, but his food was horrible. The bisque was decent, but the mushrooms were so over salted that they were almost inedible. His kobe burger which he asked to be cook medium was cooked well burnt! Cant' believe that they would actually serve something like that. 

Think twice before going to Phil's. I thought I was scoring on a sweet deal at a steak house but instead I paid $60+tax and tip to eat food that I could have gotten at Denny's. Corrections, Denny's is way better than this and 1/3 the cost!",B9lDn4yYQrazBbAeb4Zn5w,2,0,1,epB9nETxSEudGONsyFUajw

They start the meal with bread in a bag, and 2 forms of butter(margarine, sad face) one regular, the other is sour cream and chive.  The bread had onion and bacon in it, and was quite tasty.   The starter was either salad or soup, and so I choose French Onion soup. 

There were choices to make and for my protein, I opted for the 6oz center cut fillet cooked med rare, and it was delicious, served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I ate EVERY bite. 

Dessert was absolutely to die fore, it was cappuccino creme brulee... some people don't get creme brulee right they did! The top was perfect and had that right break and the inside was delicious and creamy, all in all an absolutely delicious meal.

Don't want to worry if you're too dressed up or too dressed down? Check out Phil's Italian Steak House inside the Treasure Island Hotel.

Helpful Tips: 
Make sure to make reservations before you head out, this place isn't huge and can fill up fast. 

Don't worry about how you're dressed.....dress for where you're going afterwards and you'll be just fine. There was a nice mix of jeans and skanky dresses going on. 

Be sure to order a side with your entree. Steaks come with nothing else but butter...even though they're $50+

Don't let the prices scare you, the food is worth it. I promise. 

If you like mouthwatering, melt-in-your-mouth steak order the filet. 

Skip the Italian food....you're in a steak house! 

Order dessert! But skip the gelato....it was too icey and crunchy. 

I absolutely loved this place. We had a great night out with friends thanks to the great staff, great food and great surroundings here.

5406489,2017-10-02,0,T-eEjmbEeQ53ezioW_9vxQ,"It's hard to find bad food in Vegas, but Phil's figured it out. First off, the pricing is in line with a typical nice restaurant in Vegas, like $65 for a steak, $10 for sides, etc, however the service and food is not on par at all.

When I read the reviews about burnt steaks I thought that happens occasionally, but sure enough, my medium steak was more like well done. Not burnt, just not pick at all. We had said that we would split the steak, which usually means that they bring a second plate, but in this case they felt it appropriate to filet it in half, which is probably the reason for it being over cooked. For this extra labor they charged me an extra $5. Makes sense if we hadn't ordered anything else, or if they doubled up on the sides, but everything is a la carte and we had ordered plenty of other food. The unfortunate thing is even when they brought out the new steak, it had virtually no flavor and since they don't leave salt and pepper on the table, likely because everything else they make is over seasoned, I had to ask for both just to make it edible.

My daughters spaghetti was terrible and she didn't eat it, mothers pork chop, took one bite and said she wouldn't eat it, and the apple/bacon chutney was absolutely disgusting. The wedge salad which we ordered with ranch, apparently was an indication to not put blue cheese, or any cheese on it. While I appreciate the idea of bacon bread rolls for the table, they were basically bad wheat rolls with nothing at all that tasted like bacon, and the garlic butter was flavorless as well.

So while the food was bad, the service was a perfect match. Slow, inconsistent, and no social awareness of the table full of mostly uneaten food. For this incredible dining experience we got to spend over $200.

While this place is absolutely horrible, I would strongly recommend that you venture off the strip to downtown and go to Andiamo Steakhouse at The D. We had a similar meal last night and it was all incredible for about the same price.

Shrimp in an added Shrimp Cocktail appetizer were big and meaty but not perfectly deveined.  Very good French Onion Soup arrived in a small cast iron crock with a nice chewy mix of Swiss and Gruyere Cheese and very tasty hot broth swiftly breaking down an easily yielding crouton.  As a solid alternative, Lobster Corn Chowder had a nice mix of vegetables to go with the bits of lobster and creamy soup.  Complimentary lengths of Baked Potato Bread with Bacon tasted somewhat like a Baked Potato with large bacon chips, and was somewhat addicting.  Before entrees arrived, I downed three knobby segments of this unusual bread product myself, alternately lubricating them with regular butter and Chive Butter.    

For my main, I enjoyed a buttery, perfectly medium rare 8 oz. Filet which went well with a great drinkable, made-fresh-daily Bearnaise Sauce and real yummy Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  Grilled Asparagus on the plate was also nicely prepared.

For dessert I liked both Black Forest Bread Pudding with Bing Cherries and a sweet Berry Sauce, and glassy Cappuccino Creme Brulee which appropriately tasted more like Cappuccino than pure coffee.  

Service was good on the whole, but there were a couple of service errors.  Our waiter forgot to keep the shrimps out of the Cocktail Sauce, and peppers out of the Lobster Corn Chowder as requested to please Diane's sensitive palate.  But these were but temporary setbacks.  I willingly licked the robust Cocktail Sauce off a shrimp before presenting it to Diane, and our server quickly returned with a replacement pepper-less bowl of Chowder for her.

The ambiance here is classy, with banquettes and linen-covered tables in front, and a few cushy booths in the back.  The dining room was full on a Friday night, and occasionally rather loud.
