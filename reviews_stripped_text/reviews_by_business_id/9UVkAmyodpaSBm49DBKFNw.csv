After going there several times this last time they messed up on the order, however I did not catch them messing up. So we called when  I got home and we realized. They totally blew us off and called me a liar. Yikes! That is brutal to have given your business for several months and to get treated like this. There are other places to go like this. We will not be back again for any reason. This was completely unacceptable. Oh yeah, if you keep your ""stamp card"" and have 9 out of 10 stamped they will not allow you to get the free burrito until your ""next visit"" even if you are buying 4 burritos. It is just so very evident that they are greedy and do not value even their loyal customers.",PSkrl4Od4PkTOJDQLakEmw,0,0,1,tF2YM5YnyxvYNhva4ydL4w

1208958,2016-08-04,10,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"UNSANITARY PROCEDURES & BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. If this place wanted to compete with the other sushi burrito spots in town, they need to step it up asap. A big fan of the concept, I was excited to see this place open on my side of town... but was quickly let down, as the people working here need to be trained better and up their customer service game. Falling in line, all I knew is I wanted something with the traditional sushi crab mix -- so I ordered the SHRIMP LOVER burrito. The girl working started to set up my order... Let my story begin.

- STEP 1: Rice on seaweed. So far, so good!
- STEP 2: Adding the shrimp & shrimp tempura... and as this was happening, I was already starting to get grossed out as she kept dropping ingredients onto the metal surface and proceeding to pick it up and put it into my burrito. This happens twice and I'm biting my tongue.
- STEP 3: The crab mix. But wait... she proceeds to say, ""We are out of crab mix, do you want spicy tuna?"" Um. I don't like spicy tuna. I came here for crab mix. I ask her if they are able to make more, she blandly says no. I say out loud, ""If I knew there wasn't any crab, I would have ordered something else."" She stares at me blankly. I say, ""You should announce this before people order something, especially if it's a main ingredient in what they are ordering."" She continues to stare at me blankly. No apology, no remorse, no offer to amend the situation. 

If I was a shitty person, I would have up and left -- right then and there. For a new establishment, this is not how you make a first impression. 

I ask to get the crab stick as a substitute (you know, the imitation crab that you can buy at the store that looks like a string cheese). She adds one stick and starts to ask me what vegetables I want. I ask her if I can get more crab added and she goes, ""I already put one."" I say, ""Yeah, I'm asking if you can put more."" She picks up two pieces of crab, drops one onto the metal surface, and puts it back into the ingredients container it came from. DISGUSTING?! Ingredients dropped around shouldn't be put into the customer's food let alone back into the container, contaminating all the other ingredients. Mind you, this same thing happens to my boyfriend's order twice as well. Gross. 

I prayed that our meal would at least be delicious... but no. We both agreed it seriously lacked flavor, it wasn't packed with ingredients so it wasn't really in the burrito shape, and it definitely was not worth the price. No comparison to the other sushi burrito spots, and it's been a while since I've been this disappointed. Do yourself a favor and just take the extra drive to SOHO SUSHI-BURRITO on Sahara. I know I will.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,15,4,1,aUwbBBjVH59SEqumehxAPw

Staff was friendly and helpful. Lines can get long but moves quickly. Pay at the cashier after you put your food together.

I do like all their sauce choices and how you get two proteins before an up-charge. I usually get a poke bowl, half tofu-half romaine lettuce, with ahi, and add a ton of stuff (think crunchy! Tortilla strips, cucumbers, radishes-gotta compliment the texture of the fish with some solid crunch). There is nothing bland about the flavors unless you aren't requesting flavors. They have sauces. Sauce yo shit up! They'll let you taste the sauces first so there's no excuse .

I chose my own toppings for my bowl because i could be a little picky.  The tuna did not look fresh as it stuck to the paper napkin in the container nor did it taste fresh.  The shrimp is not cooked fresh and split in half and then ripped into pieces.  The crab is fried and the eel was fatty, previously cooked with tons of sauce on it...no bueno for a fresh or healthy option.  The sauces are either mayo based or soy sauce based.  So either saturated fats or a mouth of salt.  I asked for very little wasabi aoli and she put so much on it was like  a fish salad without tasting the fish.  Maybe that is how they get around the ""lack of freshness"".

I should add that they will not take an order over the phone only online through a site called chow now. The problem is not all of the toppings and proteins are listed as options online that they have in the store. When picking sauces, it will only allow you to select one. If you would like two proteins it will only allow you to select one. There is a comment section if you would like a special request but it limits the characters used by telling you ""too long"" after you've already filled the whole thing out. If you call the store they will not take the order even if you are having trouble getting what you would like through the app. This could be easily fixed by allowing more characters in the comment section or by adding the things that aren't listed and allowing the user to choose more than one option in the sauce and protein categories.",E0Mh33Yj68liHwxTyD4uzQ,1,1,3,MtaU8Cd5Eby5T1iiwtxc_A

I made my first visit two day ago (09/27/16), when I suggested this soon to be a Vegas gem to my co-workers.

We arrived before the lunch rush....keep this in mind should you pay a visit during the 1st of the witching hours.  After 1200 for lunch there is a significant increase in the operational tempo.

One day 1, I ordered up a bowl with rice and seaweed seasoning to boot.  I added two scoops of ahi tuna and some soft shell crab.  Add Masago...you will not be sorry.  I selected everything to be mixed sans the soft crab with the house poke sauce.  I added avocado, red onions, jalapeños, and sea weed.  

OUTSTANDING!  For the price, your going to get the equivalent of several sushi rolls!  My initial assessment, was that I needed another bowl or perhaps something else to take the hunger itch off.  Don't fret.....give it a moment and you will feel content.  

Today, I returned with the GF and ordered up three scoops of ahi, and kept everything the same.  Again...it was another solid experience.  As I type, it's a little after 9:00 PM.  I may have snacked a little bit, but as a whole I am content.

The tuna was good. Soft and tasted fresh enough. I was given a very generous portion for the price. The two things turned me off a little was some of the rice was not soft and the sauce which was called ""something something sweet sauce"" was actually a bit spicy.

1942075,2016-08-10,6,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"Not my preferred poke bowl spot in town, but it's the lone option currently available to northsiders. Menu offers DIY bowls and burritos, but I found that the fish wasn't quite as fresh as other places and they were a bit more stingy with toppings/portions than other places with a comparable price point.

I usually build my own bowl, and here the large is $11.50 for three scoops. Glad they offer greens and brown rice as base options. The girl who helped me carefully made sure the protein scoop was perfectly level and even knocked some out before putting it in the bowl, which seemed unnecessary. I like how this spot has several sauce options, but I really didn't care for the wasabi yuzu, which overpowered everything it touched (as did the red onion I added), and the rice wasn't that great- a little dry? Note that options like avocado, masago, and crab are extra. 

The bowl I created was good, but my guy was less impressed with his. Service was fairly friendly and helpful, but I do wish that the toppings section toward the end of the line was labelled- I would have added on seaweed salad had I noticed it.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,15,3,tVUmFgMMwIg6kCid1kG8Xg

Food was yummy! I think the fish could have been cut a little better,  some pieces were stringy, but taste quality and freshness were on point. Place seemed clean but it is a new restaurant so of course it's clean. 

And here is the petty part, maybe I just wasn't in the mood but..    
 I was at the restaurant around 3:45 and there weren't many other customers. The girl in front said, ""I want everything on it"" & the worker still asked if she wanted certain toppings..... uhhh she said everything on it, and with me she just seemed soooooo inconvenienced that I was ordering food, my goodness.... the guys working were super nice and the red head with the matte magenta nails working cashier was splendid, but this dark haired brunette just couldn't be bothered.

The tempura is obviously not freshly made but freshly from the freezer. He then asked if I wanted lettuce then retracted the question by saying to himself, ""WAIT. Does it even come with lettuce?"" He then looked at at little book that is literally on the assembly line then said, ""Oh yeah. It does."" Then with the same fingers he used to flip through then scroll down on that book, he then touched food back on the line then put it on my burrito. I just thought of this. F**K ME. He then drowned my burrito in sauces. 

I got a few sides like the crunchies, avocado and seaweed salad/greens. My goodness. I am not asking for a handful but it was literally a pinch of crunchies. By this time, I was irritated. The over ripe, mushy avocado slices put on my burrito were the small ends of the avocado and only 2 pieces. Like WHY? WHY do you offer such add on's if they're barely even there???

Upon checking out, I noticed they were expanding to my side of town. The girl at the register kept insisting it's not going to be on my side of town (closer to Henderson) but hers. Why would there be two locations of the same restaurant in the same area? I mean, you're not Starbucks, honey. 

She came to her senses then realized it really is going to be in on my side of town. SMH. I won't be visiting this location or the new any time ever. I couldn't wait to get out of Sweet Poke. You got my money but you are not getting a two, three, four and definitely not a 5 star review.

The seating arrangement is a lot better than some other poke/ sushi burrito establishments which is always nice. The quality is pretty good especially considering you're paying a modest price for what you get.

I got the citrus salmon bowl which is excellent. The presentation is pretty nice as well. I only wish the charge for extra protein was a little lower, $2.50 for some extra fish is quite expensive. When the large bowl is already $11.50, which is already $2.50 more expensive than the regular, you're charging practically for a whole bigger bowl when in actuality you're only getting one more scoop of fish.

2768681,2017-04-25,0,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"I've been meaning to write a review on this place.

There was an instance where I ordered 5 rolls. The guy at the register said ""did you order enough?"" I think he was being sarcastic but I didn't appreciate that comment. He made me feel bad for ordering a lot and probably holding up the line. I paid $50+ for that and felt bad for ordering 5 (to share with my family)! 

Another instance, I used their online ordering service, for the sole reason that the food would be ready when it was time to pick it up. When I got there, instead of a bowl, they made a roll. I had to wait in line and get my order made.

Again, I use their online ordering service (on 3-26), so that the food would be ready by the time it said it would be ready by (45 minutes after ordering time.)  I don't know if any of you order via their website, but it has a section where you could put a different ""pick up by"" name. I had my fiance pick it up so I put his name.  When he gets there, 1 hour 15 minutes later, they couldn't find it under his name and told him that I probably ordered for a different location, skipped him/disregarded his issue and went on helping the next person in line. He calls me up, I tell him to try my name, he tells me they aren't even acknowledging his presence, had to get someone's attention to tell them to look up my name. They found my name, BUT the food was not even made.

During that time, I called to ask what was going on. I spoke with John ""Directives manager"" who was very rude and had an attitude over the phone. He told me ""we were busy and I already gave a coupon for a BOGO. So what is the issue?"" I asked for the owner's name, but he was hesitant to tell me. Then he tells me he's the manager and asks why do I need to know their names. Sassy much? If he didn't speak with attitude, I think the conversation would have been tolerable and I would have understood that it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes to make 2 bowls-that came with directions!  The cherry on top was... When I got my bowl they forgot my avocado! 

Dear Freddy & Eric,
Please include customer service as a priority in your business. I've had 3/5 bad experiences here! Once was enough, but I still gave this company the benefit of the doubt. Please look into your online ordering service, Chownow, and why it doesn't show ""pick up by name"" and uses the person who ordered it. That way there won't be any confusion for customers/staff members. Otherwise, remove that section online where it asks that. Have your staff acknowledge waiting guests and greet them as they come to the line. Little things like that go a long way.

Thank you.",kVJmrH2qvABTx52bM2iU3w,0,0,1,W8MpQMWpjQGU_m_ZY1Q8YQ

Me and my son come here once a week for dinner however last night he had a family event so I went this afternoon to keep up with our weekly tradition and as my boel was being made I was told that I could no longer have any sauce on my rice and also the scoops of protein were much smaller than they have been in the previous few months that we've been going and when I asked if there was a reason why they were building the bowl so small and so different I  was told that they had a meeting this morning and had to watch portions, also their bowls have gotten smaller. I understand watching portions as I own my own business as well, however I don't understand cutting back so much so that it is any actual visual difference where two pieces of avocado were given instead of 4 or 5, the scoops are much smaller and the sauce is actually regulated to only be on the protein mixture and nothing on the rice creating a very dry bowl. I hope that this is a temporary setback and not going to be the normal for this place as I know I was pretty upset with my order this afternoon and will try one more time however if it doesn't change we will be finding a new poké place.",Wk__-57W-WApaXtsq1CIvA,0,0,3,fqQvJ5z2bwDidHTfe9kJzA

Simply put, these rolls were AMAZING. They were bursting with flavour, and were filled to the brim with sushi goodness. The Yum Yum sauce on mine added a touch of sweet that went great with the spicy crab.

2852405,2016-07-27,3,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"Just Meh. Not the worst sushi burrito you'll get but not something you'd rave about for days till you came back (like other places in the LV, *ahem* Soho)

The restaurant is small and the dining area can seat around 24 or so. The dining area was clean though I never saw anyone come through and wipe down tables. 

Ordering was relatively simple but other customers seemed confused by the protein and topping concepts (since the toppings are protein?). I didn't understand why my burrito crafter was asking me what I wanted on my burrito when I ordered the ""Diego"".  Service was a little slow. 

The food prep area seemed clean and organized. 

The servers were not rude but they must have been tired or annoyed at the previous customers since I never saw one of the 3 ladies crack a smile at all. My crafter didn't seem too familiar with their offerings. Have you tried the taro chips yourself?

The Diego was rolled well by hand (despite some of the other reviews praising Soho's rolling machine) and my burrito held together just fine. I did think the rice was a bit dry (C'mon! Good rice is what MAKES sushi great!). My yellowtail and spicy tuna was fresh and flavorful. 

They keep the wasabi and ginger behind the counter so you have to ask for it. The wasabi had the consistency of playdough so I think they must make it from powder. 

I did appreciate the combo options they have (Soho doesn't have as many). 

You can expect to drop $10-12 on food here, about average for this kind of offering. 

Overall a fair experience. I would come back since it's the only option on the north side for this kind of offering. That is unless Soho opened a location in Centennial. ;)",KuVh3gvIUojjZUfABiDnYg,7,1,3,sdgbw93LKERSzNl45yb2jA

1. Pick a bowl or a burrito.
2. Pick your toppings OR a pre-made combo (It can get complicated here since you can customize any of the pre-made ones, too.)

If the price tag looks steep at $10 for a small, it's definitely a LOT of food once you pile on as many toppings as you want. Even with a big appetite that day, I couldn't finish my bowl at all and gave up. 

Avoid ice cream mochi here. It's commercially bought and completely unpalatable. The green tea tastes like you're eating perfume.

Typically, I show up in about 15 minutes and it is already ready...or they get on it and get it to me within minutes. And on two occasions, they have made the bowl incorrectly on the first try, so they make it again and give me both bowls anyways!

She was rude, condescending, and feigned ignorance when an employee reminded her she had previously been discouraged from such behaviors. 
If you want specificity in the food you eat, make it yourself. Otherwise, respect those working, and the 5 people waiting behind you. At the very least, recognize you're unhappy and find a healthy outlet to channel your sense of frustration or need for control.

3630627,2017-07-28,0,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"I can see why people rave about this place, but I don't think I'll be returning. I am a poké FANATIC, I make my own, island style, at home when I feel up to it and it's probably because I am accustomed to how it should be that I don't like Sweet Poké. 

After Trader Joe's moved I figured it would be a great time to try a new poke place. I love finding great new spots, but I came in with no hopes since I didn't look it up beforehand. I came in the afternoon around 2 pm on a Wednesday, looked around and loved the decor and the cool message from the owner. There were already people sitting down eating their lunches.

I then perused the menu, decided on an 808 Bowl, and relayed my order to a bored looking younger girl with brown/blond hair. I saw that it said you can get a half and half for the carb portion so I asked for taro chips but she told me it wasn't an option anymore. Ok cool, so I went with just the white rice. She asked if I wanted furikake, then proceeded to walk me through the line. After me were two girls completely new to the idea of poké. It was then that I realized what I didn't like about it: I did not like that they had turned the idea of poké to a Subway-sandwich style food line with a stop and explanation at each portion of the meal.

Because I either order it and accept what is given to me (like as in a restaurant), or get it by the pound pre-made with a number of options for styles, I dislike the breaking down and explanation of ingredients. It felt unauthentic and inefficient. The girl put a wopping dollop of sesame shoyu sauce on the tuna that disguised the taste of the tuna completely. I actually panicked and asked her what it was. She was not friendly whatsoever, just gave me a look that said ""It's the sesame shoyu sauce, DUH"". I did not expect so much sauce. There are many options to include in the order, and I generally go with whatever the set comes with so I got it with everything it came with. At the end, I paid and sat down to try my bowl. 

It was good--not great--but with the three greens, and all the other things I think a bento style bowl would have made it better so I could compartmentalize my meal (rice and poké seperate from veggies) rather than go digging underneath and around for stuff. The vast options for customization is definitely more to other people's taste, but not mine. I loved that the veggies tasted fresh, the fish showed no signs of water damage, and it was a beautiful plate, but did not satisfy my poké needs. They also allow you to earn points towards a free meal with an app. Overall, a no go for me, but I wish them luck.

If I get a poke bowl I'm anticipating I can get my food in a scoop on a fork.  Not the case ... the soft shell crab and the shrimp tempura comes in whole pieces... idk why this bothers me but it does ... cut up your food !! Same with the cilantro .. big ass leaves of cilantro on the bowl ... 
their yum yum sauce is not that great ... I can't place it but it doesn't taste like a traditional yum yum ... 
when they do warm up the shrimp tempura they managed to burn it 2 out of 2 times ... like literally the end piece is black and burned .. I tossed those pieces both times ... 
they did not warm up the soft shell crab .. even tho it's tempura coated .. thought that was odd .. 
idk this place just doesn't do it for me. I'd rather trek over to lake mead and rainbow for Poké then go to the place 11 minutes from my house ..
Also the last time I ordered here was out of Poké desperation b.c my usual spot was out of salmon ... I ordered Uber eats where you literally check box by box what you want on your  order .. they forgot the furikake ... it's a bunch of little things that add up that will prevent me from coming back here in the future",oknzpMgHOnbijayveG-PKQ,0,0,1,XivgJO-tgjwPuD0gXPSGdg

The person in charge Yun I think his name is kept belittling his employee Marilyn while she was helping us.

We really wanted to leave immediately when he started to be rude and yell at her in front of the customers but she kept her composer and kept assisting us.  We felt embarrassed for her and he made the atmosphere thick. And to top it off he excused his behavior by saying, ""Sorry,she's in training."" 

If I was in training and someone talked down to me and yelled at me in front of customers I would have quit on the spot. And when I asked what his name was the young man behind the counter said his name was Yun and he is the financial owner of the business. Really?? And he is representing his business like this?

Okay rant over. I just want to give praise to Marilyn for helping us and handling herself correctly in that unfortunate situation. She had a positive attitude and produced a very tasty product. 

But I think we will stick to the other location for our tasty burritos because the atmosphere is more upbeat and fun there.

4006712,2016-07-22,6,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"While everyone else is busy catching Pokemon, I am busy finding the best place to get poke in town. Poke burrito concoction is becoming a big thing with the recent opening of Soho Sushi Bowlrrito, Pokeman, To See Roll and Sweet Poke. 

With so many sushi burrito places opening up, the biggest question is...what makes each shops different from each other? Is it the quality? quantity? price? service? sauce? From the looks of it, seems that they all have similar toppings with similar protein choices at similar price ranges. On my visit to Sweet Poke, I constantly found myself comparing this place to my favorite place, Pokeman. 

Price was $1-2 cheaper. Same great quality fish but I actually got more. I ordered their regular burrito and they generously packed 4 scoops of salmon in my burrito. With other toppings included, they packed so much that they couldn't even roll my fat burrito. They did, but seaweed was split in half with rice and toppings spilling out from all over the place. This much food and I paid around $9 with tax. What a deal. My burrito turned out to be one ginormous but delicious burrito that I am drooling over as I write this review thinking about it. 

Bowl seemed to be a bit disappointing. We got a large and regular bowl. Difference was that large comes with 4 scoops of rice while regular comes with 3. It felt like they were about the same portions which was a bit odd. Paid more, yet portion was exactly the same. I did like how it came in a microwave safe bowl that can be reused at home. Great for packing your lunch to school or work. 

I will be back here. Great quality, great price and friendly service. I'm a fan.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,11,7,4,IMYyRPX-iXETn0PmhVDtrg
4014970,2017-05-16,0,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"My fave poke place is still another joint, but this one is located on my side of town so that is a plus!

Sweet Poke is not much different from all the other sushi burrito/bowl type casual eateries that have opened up all over the valley in the last year.  All offer choices of fish protein, wrapped or in a bowl, with rice or with salad greens.  The theme is HEALTHY!  Because I guess...well, poke should be healthy. 

 Their menu has a lot of options for a signature burrito or bowl, make sure you read well so you know what you're getting.  This time around we orders 1 burrito and 1 bowl.

Wifey got basically a create your own sushi burrito ($9.50) - 2 scoops of protein, base, sauce & toppings.  She got a nori seaweed wrap, white rice base with salmon & crab, topped with avocado, tamago, & sweet poke house sauce.

I got the Aloha bowl ($9.50) - ahi tuna, crab, cucumber, green lettuce, tamago & sesame shoyu sauce.  The really great thing about Sweet Poke is that most of their sauces & toppings don't cost you any extra money.  So I made my bowl GIGANTOR by adding toppings of seaweed salad, furikake, cilantro, mixed greens, edamame & shredded nori!  Much more value to my liking.  

Taste?  Honestly just OK for us.  Perhaps we should have tried additional sauces to compliment our burrito & bowl?  Wifey said her burrito was a bit lacking on the flavor side, with too much rice to fish ratio.  She said the fish was good though, not 'fishy' tasting at all.  My bowl was good, the ratio of rice to fish was a bit of a culprit though.  The bowl had a generous layer of rice - while I love rice being that I'm from Hawaii, there just wasn't enough protein to go around.  I liked the fact that I had all the additional veggies in my bowl, but after eating all that along with my ahi & crab mix, I still had a good portion of rice leftover.  Next time maybe I'll ask for more sauce as well.  I liked how at Sweet Poke they mix the sauce with your fish though.  It would be easy enough to ask for samples of other sauces on the side.  

Pricing is on the average with most other poke places, but Sweet Poke comes in at a bit lower price of $9.50 for majority of their burritos/bowls.  You can also combo up for an additional $3 - combos come with soda and your choice of edamame, veggie chips, seaweed salad, or miso soup.   

Service was fast & efficient, although we did notice they catered more to repeat customers than 1st timers like us which was OK.  We'd come back for some poke again though if the craving hit and we were on our usual side of town.  Pretty good Sweet Poke!

4054629,2017-03-23,7,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"BYO poke bowls and sushi burritos are all over the place.  Let's be real here.  You're not going to find high quality poke at any of these sushi burrito spots. What's a sushi burrito?  A sushi burrito is basically a larger hand-roll with a just a lot more in it. When I go to these places, I rarely pick from their menu and usually opt to build my own.  I had them create a sushi burrito with no rice, just seaweed, salmon, imitation crab, some crunch for texture, and their chipotle menu.  Since most sushi burritos are small, I also had them add 4 scoops of their cooked salmon on the side.  My meal wasn't bad at all and compared to the rest of the sushi burrito spots in town, I think this one is the least expensive.  If you're a fan Yum Yum Rolls, then you may love a place like Sweet Poke.  The protein options is abundant and you get to choose how large you want your meal to be. Overall, the food is okay and perfect if you're looking for a quick snack.  

TIP:  My BYO sushi burrito and 4 scoops of cooked salmon was less than $13.  This was about $7 cheaper than what I'm used to paying at the other sushi burrito restaurants in town.

4060125,2016-07-27,2,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"So after going to many different ""create your own poke bowl"" places I am putting my review back up after the owner messaged me to delete my review. I should've just left it on here because may be others could've relate.. 

When I ate here it just opened and there was barely any reviews. I walked in was greeted by the ladies working. I wanted to be in and out quick since I had plans with my family so I ordered one of the dishes on the menu instead of making own. I was watching the girl make my bowl and she messed up about 2 times like the ingredients that are in front of her was hard to understand. But I know she is still learning... I notice though that I had more rice than poke! What's up with that. The pricing wasn't right to me at the time cause how much poke I got. It was less than the ahi bowl I get at poke express and poke express gives you a load of ahi. 

Taste review, definitely can taste the difference from this place to others, the time I went I probably didn't get the fresh end of the ahi. Mine tasted like it was out for awhile and chewy. Not the good chewy more like left over, refrigerated ahi. Supposedly the owner said he gets ""fresh poke unlike other places that uses frozen""  

Like I said in my first review I don't plan on coming back with the amount of poke and price. I can find other places.

However, when I was fantasizing about such restaurant opening close to my house, I imagined it to be magical and Sweet Poke is just not...
To be fair, the fish and other add-ons were fresh. I ordered a bowl with Tuna, crab, masago, brown rice, spinach, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, carrot, seaweed salad, cilantro, and mistakenly HOT pepper. I also got sweet poke house sauce and yum yum sauce on the side. The bowl was delicious! I wasn't crazy about the sauces though preferred the Sweet Poke House Sauce over Yum Yum. It appears as most of their sauces have a mayo-e base and consistency and I am not a fan of mayo.
The ordering process was a bit confusing to me. I ordered the Ahi Lover and was asked to build my own bowl in the process. The Ahi Lover bowl has Tuna and Spicy Tuna in it, I only got one type and when I mentioned the ingredients that are listed for the bowl I requested, I was ignored and asked to continue listing what I wanted. My bowl came out to be $13 before tip while I ordered regular size. Now, I did add a scoop of crab while going along the line of ingredients, I assume that has to cost more but at no point was I told that there will be an extra charge. The menu does not list the cost of additional protein either.

Also they surprisingly don't use sushi vinegar and sugar in their rice.  It's just rice. The texture and flavor are not there,not like you would expect.   So there is an opportunity for improvement.   They are a little confused still but it's so new that can be expected.   I ordered several burritos but still with them being out of so much I still have not tried them IMO.

I did suggest it and they were receptive. Very friendly staff. Restaurant was clean. My husband absolutely loves this place. Their sushi tastes fresh.

The portions are generous, fish are freshly cut, decent prices and the flavors are delicious. I've probably been here along with my girlfriend about every other day. Hell, I feel like all of my money goes into the place. It's funny because one day we craved poke and were about to drive across town until we found this on Our side. definitely one of the biggest surprises and gems, a must try.

It's best to look how to order and what your would like before stepping in line. These guys are fast :) 

Parking: lots. Part of a strip mall. 

Inside: clean, good light, lots of table, AC cool.

Food: Pepsi products  (i prefer coke products). Food taste good. Would be better if they had a different type of mayo sauce in addition to mayo chipotle. Lots of selections. I like this type of ordering. Pick bowl or wrap,  pick starch, pick size, regular = 2 small scoops of protien, Large is 3 scoops, choose your sauce and then she will toss the sauce and protien and put mixture on your starch. Then pick greens, and other assorted toppings (this is included in the price). 

Service: good, fast, sometimes hard to hear talking through the high glass (much more sanitary thank you!) 4 people taking/making orders and one cashier made for getting in and out very fast. 

I had large bowl, half rice, 2 ahi, 1 salmon, chipotle mayo (not my favorite but that was the only ""mayo"" I saw on the list.)

I quickly made the executive decision we would take it to go as I wasn't sure I could handle the smell while eating.

The ordering process took longer than I would have liked but I think this might be due to dumb customers infront of us, I felt like yelling shut up asking questions and just fuckin order, but maybe with time the staff will get better at pushing these customers along the process. 

The options are endless but basically you can get a bowl or a big ass sushi roll ( burrito). I got the bowl and the gf went with the burrito. On my bowl was rice, ahi tuna, spicy tuna , those little orange egg things , onion,  yum yum sauce, and eil sauce. 

It was amazing,  the fish taste so fresh and delicious. I see myself being a regular. I think next time I might add some more to my bowl but I was completely happy with my order.

But for there to be hecka people an get so little service is beyond me. It was the first time I had ever been there and there was no  direction on anything. Lucky my coworker told me the process of how it worked.

Customer service was lacking, which was really odd because there was hecka employees in there. So my burrito is done being made and the guy that is suppose to wrap it like goes in the back and comes all the way around to the front to pick up a tray and then goes back into the back, (all the while my burrito is still sitting there unwrapped) then the same guy comes back to wrap my burrito, luckily he changed gloves to do so otherwise I would have had a huge fit! So finally my burrito is wrapped my sauce is next to it, cool. Then the lady in front of me that was paying for her food was like oh can I get some Chipotle sauce and the cashier proceeds to take the one that was next to my burrito, which was meant for me. Me not saying anything, I was like okay I'll just have to get another one. So just as I go to pay the guy that was checking people out goes to the back and like doesn't come back. So at this point I'm like what that heck is happening am I invisible does my order not matter right now......so I wait like what feels like forever for someone to ring me up, all the while there is like hella employees in the front that could have rung me up or at least been like tell someone ""hey can someone come and ring her up.' oh and mind you it wasn't busy, there were more employees in that place than there were people. Then finally someone comes from the back a totally different dude to ring me up. I'm like cool I can get out of here. Then he gon have the nerve to be like oh would you like to leave a tip!!!!!!!! UMMM hell naw I shall pass! I have been waiting for like 5 plus minutes just to be rung up! my food been ready, if it were hot it would have been cold by now. Then he proceeds to tell me about there rewards program. I kid you not he says, ""so you can sign up with our rewards program by using this receipt."" so I ask for him to elaborate and dude just looks at me and I'm like okay I'm done, never mind let me take my burrito and get up out of here.

I decided on a regular bowl with white rice. The regular is a huge portion, but they have a large as well if you are super hungry. It's great that they offer brown or white rice. After that it's all you! Select your protein. I ordered raw salmon, ahi tuna and spicy tuna. Next, you choose a sauce or sauces as many as you like. I had the chipotle mayo and I wanted the house sweet poke sauce (they were out) so I ended up with yum yum sauce instead. Then toppings! They have a ton! I loved that they give you avocado free on your bowl. I had that with cucumber, mango pieces, and red onion. Now, they do charge extra for mango salsa so I improvised. 
Sweet Poke has great raw fish. The amount of fish to rice could be slightly better, but overall it was very satisfying. The sauces I ended up with were excellent, but their chipotle mayo needs a little kick.

First off I feel like the price is very reasonable here.  2 scoops of protein for less than 10 dollars!  Also, I love that they give you more options than other places for the base.  The options include white, brown rice, salad (spring mix, romaine, spinach or kale), tofu or a combination of the above.  I picked spinach salad with tofu.  They also offer a variety of sauces and I went with the popular chipotle mayo and eel sauce.  A nice balance of spicy and sweet.

Their salmon and tuna were very fresh.  I didn't get any chewy pieces or fishy tasting pieces in my bowl.  On top of your two scoops, they also offer a complimentary scoop of spicy or regular crab meat, or spicy tuna.  I went with the spicy tuna and that was delicious as well.  I also love that avocado comes free!  Usually they charge extra for that.  I topped my bowl with tons of veggies including seaweed salad, corn, peppers, radish, edamame etc.

Everything was delicious and will definitely come here again.  I recommend you creating your own bowl rather than picking a bowl off their menu because you can tailor it just to how you like it.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,4,3,5,YK-fKico01PVIBxmPR2mcg

5051365,2016-08-30,2,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"I was super excited to find a poke bowl / sushi burrito spot pop up in the neighborhood. 

I stop in on their 4th day being open and make my own bowl. I got a  2 scoop bowl with yellowtail to go. On this first impression it was awful. The rice was hot. I had to put it in the fridge because the fish was then warm and I can't eat it that way. It tasted fine but of course having hot rice changed the fish as the side touching the rice turned a bit white and cooked lightly. Some of my greens wilted.  The fish scoops was miniscule. The cubes don't fit perfectly into the scoop so you'll have gaps and the girl I saw level the scoop so my ""large"" bowl had a total of 8 little pieces which is uber stingy. I got the salsa for $1 extra which they convinced me was so bomb but was not worth the up charge . $12 and was sorely disappointed by portion and attention to detail. 

I started to see friends go there recently and saw their bowls looked more generous so I decided to try again. This time around aside from my 2 scoops of fish (I got yellowtail and tuna), I was offered a scoop of another protein either spicy tuna, surimi crab or lobster mix which is included in the bowl price. I was not offered that during my first visit, they forgot somehow which is amazing as you see the bowl in front of you and I'm the only customer being helped or this is a new thing they added into their bowls. This makes the protein ratio a bit better. The fish seem decent quality this time around and the rice was room temperature instead of hot. I also noticed a few things that cost extra at others, can come in your bowl like avocado, masago, etc. BUT they aren't generous in portions here- it's pretty precise in topppings.

I like how the spicy tuna is considered a topping so you can get two scoops of fish + spicy tuna and still be a regular bowl. If there is a line it moves very fast.

I ordered a spicy ahi tuna roll and another one with salmon (forgot the name). But while they were making my spicy ahi roll they tell me that they ran out already and asked if I just wanted regular ahi but with spicy crab mix. I didn't mind but I wished they told me beforehand so I could've picked something else.

Then they were making my salmon roll. I noticed the girl working there was a little confused on what goes into which burrito because she was making my rolls simultaneously. In the end they both tasted the same.

Pick a base (white rice, brown rice, salad, or tofu). Pick your protein (salmon, tuna, soft-shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, etc.). Pick your sauce (wasabi aioli, yuzu, shoyu, ginger, yum yum sauce, eel sauce, etc.). Pick other toppings (green onions, masago, tamago, mango, mango salsa, cilantro, cucumber, furikake, strawberry, edamame, wakame, avocado, spinach, lettuce, etc.)

My favorite custom combination would be tofu, salmon, spicy tuna, soft-shell crab, shoyu, mango, cilantro, green onions, furikake and masago. Depending on my mood, I add more stuff to my combo. You can reuse the bowls for meal prepping.

They have bottled beverages (melon soda, green tea, jasmine green tea, milk tea) and fountain drinks. There's a cooler by the fridge with pre-packaged poke and desserts such as macarons, cheesecake and cake rolls.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,6,4,Z3ZKCUN7d9lzksYE1NQcEQ

We each built our own bowl, mine with white rice, salmon, crab, seaweed salad, cucumber, avocado, corn and mixed greens. I'd take advantage of their toppings; they're unlimited after all! Next time I'll add mango and tempura crunch. Hubby put mango in his, and it complimented the poké so well!

The sauces are made in-house too which adds to the whole freshness element. I asked for the Sweet Poké House Sauce, but there was nothing sweet about it. It was pretty spicy, which I was warned about. I assumed the name meant it would be somewhat sweet. Rule of thumb: Never assume! Lol, I'll stick to the Yum Yum sauce in the future.

5399085,2016-08-19,1,9UVkAmyodpaSBm49DBKFNw,"I've tried this place twice, to give it a second chance before writing this review. I was so excited to see the Centennial area get a place that serves poke and sushi burritos. I'll admit both of my kids liked their burritos, albeit one only tried a burrito with surimi crab and cucumbers inside. I went alone my first visit, and ordered a make your own bowl. I got yellowtail, salmon, soft shell crab, spicy tuna, and surimi with cucumbers. I had to pay extra since the rules for ""make your on"" don't allow for spicy tuna and surimi in the same bowl. The sauce I chose was the chipotle mayo. The employee making my bowl was friendly, asking if I'd been there before. I advised him I hadn't. He ran through a short explanation of the menu. I chose to make my own bowl since I really didn't see a combination I liked. I chose the yellowtail and salmon first. He asked for the sauce choice, then mixed the sauce and fish with masago before placing it on the rice. I added the other ingredients and proceed to pay the $12.44 for my bowl. Ouch. I order all kinds of bowls from soho sushi burrito and have never paid that much. As for the taste, bleh, the fish was mushy and slimy. The pieces weren't completely chopped well and some of the salmon pieces came out like a string, with connective tissue. The spicy tuna was inedible. It was more like a mushy paste. The soft shell crab was hard and stale. It tasted like it had been fried days before. At the time, the place was still new and had only one other customer in the dining area when I visited. I rationalized that the lack of freshness was attributed to the fact that they didn't cycle through enough food to prepare it fresh. A few weeks had passed and after a visit to the eyebrow threading salon in the same strip mall, my kids convinced me to try it again. This time it was packed. We waited behind a small group of teenage boys that were ordering and apparently knew the young blonde employee making the burritos. My oldest ordered a dragon burrito, the youngest ordered a burrito with surimi and cucumbers (she's the picky one). The same young blonde started my order by just scooping the salmon on the rice. I asked if she could mix it with the sauce, but she didn't hear me as she was still flirting with the teens in front of us. I watched as she picked up the squirt bottle and covered the fish and rice with the mayo. Oh well. I ordered the surimi and tempura shrimp to go with the salmon. At the checkout we were enticed to order a combo which came with either chips or edamame and a soda. We chose the edamame. The bill came to around $45. I asked what the cucumber surimi roll costed and he it was $8.99. I said ""really you don't have a kids burrito?"" He was nice and said ""oh okay since there are only 2 ingredients I'll take $3 off. Sweet, only $42. My kids were eating their burritos by the time I got my soda and came back to the table. They both said theirs were good. I took one bite of my rice with some salmon and the rice was hard. I took another bite from a different section of the bowl and still it was hard. I took my bowl back up to the checkout and asked the cashier if I could switch out the rice, as it was either undercooked or had dried out in the warmer. He was very polite and apologized. He went to the line where the rice warmer was, and took some out and placed it in a bowl. He went to the back and after a few short minutes came back to me and stated, you're right, the rice was undercooked. He offered to make me a burrito instead since they had to cook more rice to make the bowls with. I agreed that would be fine. He scooped my toppings onto a burrito wrapper, rolled it up and handed it back with an apology. The burrito was petty good.the tempura shrimp tasted fresh and the salmon wasn't stringy like before. I still would drive all the way to Sahara to get a soho sushi burrito before I'd visit this place ever again. The prices are better and their employees are always professional and courteous. If you do decide to try this place, I recommend ordering a burrito!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,2,2,3,4jrLkTUoudtLsFEwzyrr8g

The toppings were all full and fresh looking and the staff was great getting the lunch crowd through the line.
