We got there and it was seat yourself. No biggie. We sat down and a lady brought 3 menus (there were 4 of us). They took our drink order. When they came back with the drinks we tried to order our appetizer but we were told that the waitress would be with us shortly. Then a male arrived at the table so we placed our appetizer order. Then another female came to take our order. It took at least 45 minutes between sitting down and ordering. Our food then took another 45 minutes to be prepared. Our appetizer tasted like the frozen ones from Costco and was a mess. My husbands pot roast sandwich lacked flavor, my mother in law had to ask for extra condiments to give her frisco burger flavor. My daughters bacon was burnt while her eggs were under cooked. Finally my burger was just so so. I only ate half and gave the other half to my husband since he refused to eat his food. 

We ended up taking the food home to the animals.",E43dSKeHycj6MnM-ksqh2w,0,0,2,wWjcRFOex6odAAj_LCC9Dg

1003608,2017-01-23,0,qhbUNmiGKmw343Fj7qlEsQ,"If your are looking for a breakfast place that is somewhat plain, but easily accessible with good food, this is a place to go. When searching I expected a place with ""Harvest"" in its name to trend toward health food and grains.  But this is a good solid place.  

My wife had the Harvest Omelet which had mushrooms, peppers, onions, tomatoes and spinach.  No meat but they have meat omelets as well. She really enjoyed it.  I had the Bacon or Sausage Skillet with the sausage option.  In addition to the main ingredients there were two over easy (my choice) eggs on top.  Being gluten intolerant all I missed was the toast, no biggie.  

The servings were generous and neither of us could finish our meals, although I did cherry-pick the sausage pieces our of my remnant portion making it unsuitable for a take-away box. Their menu which is posted on line is extensive and should have something for everybody who wants a hearty breakfast. 

The service was prompt and courteous.  When we arrived (late again) it was seat yourself so we had no trouble getting in.  They had filled up pretty well by the time we left, but it doesn't seem to be a place that typically has long waiting lines - something we really appreciate as my wife has knee issues.

The staff was extremely efficient and very accommodating towards my daughters love of bacon, substituting ALL the sides that came with the French toast to ONLY BACON with no issues :)
I ordered the country steak and over medium eggs, the most perfectly cooked eggs I think I may have ever had in a breakfast establishment, my steak was juicy & crisp, the sausage gravy could of used a little more seasoning.

Located on Craig and Decatur, next to a discount mall. It's a small restaurant, which is in a decent location. it was early morning that we went, and Sunday for that matter. There was 8 of us, and we were able to get a good seating. It did fill up really fast, which shows that, they are a very recognized place. But knowing that they had guess coming in big crowd, it did show that they had little room to accommodate the guess. In other words, the place was small for the popularity they have. 

The staff, were nice and very helpful. But when they got busy, it seems like the wait time for service tend to spread out more and it seem like they were under staff. It was kind of hard to get refills, or get attention. I think I finished my food, before I got a refill on my drink. But they did what they can do, in which, I'll give them credit for doing what they can. 

The food, on the other hand, was great. I had the steak and eggs, which was cooked very well and presented very well I basically inhaled it. We also had the chicken quesadilla for appetizer, which was full of chicken. The wife loved it, but I wasn't fond of the sour cream being in a packet. But the quesadilla was good, I'll give them that. 

Not fond of the fact that they only had one of those bathroom, just for one person at a time. Mainly end up having to stay in line, just to use a bathroom. Other then that, the place can be better, but the food was great. 

I would probably recommend this place for the food. Probably go there when its not so busy and that you don't plan to use the bathroom while you're their. Other then that, its an A-OK kind of review. Maybe next time, it will be better.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,0,3,iwsqJUA4LKzeLYLOqNCu9w

Decor: 
None! This place need a major face lift. I walk into this place and immediately feel dirty. Dingy, stagnant and dark come to mind. The carpet looks so dirty, the chairs are awful. Esthetically this place looks like they got started with ideas and then checked their bank account and got an allowance to the 99 cent store. This place really needs a major overhaul and TLC. 

Food:
I had the pot roast sandwich and fries. I also ordered a full chef salad to go with avocado. 

The salad was blah. It had maybe half a boiled egg, less than an ounce of turkey and ham combined. The avocado side I got was just literally one slice cut in half to appear bigger and brown,Wth?! Tomatoes where so soggy it was disgusting. 




 The positive side 

Fries are so good! Crispy, perfectly seasoned, ranch dressing is great. The pot roast sandwich was good needed a little bit more salt but that's easily fixed.

So I decided the have the dinner chicken fried steak since his looked so good. The gravy they serve at night is completely different from the one they served in the morning. It had a more yellow color to it, not white with pepper.  The wife had fried chicken this time, it's was good not outstanding.

There seemed to be only 1 waiter and he was helpful. I wasn't too keen on the lack of decor and ambience of the place. It kinda looks like this space use to be an office and it's just weird all together.

In general I wouldn't really come again because I know I can get better breakfast elsewhere with better service and a more inviting atmosphere.

Do not expect nouvelle cuisine, it is geared for an older crowd.

Speaking of older crowd, it is like dining at a retirement home. I am old and I was the youngest. If you want to bring someone older out to dinner this is where you take them. My burger came out to $10 so it is not cheap, but wait a minute, USE THE COUPON and you are good! 

The decor is very nice in there, I was very surprised. I did not check out the bathroom because that is my new check that I am adding to my reviews, a clean bathroom = clean kitchen. The service was a little slow, the place was packed with two servers and a busser and they were all friendly.

5441078,2013-02-06,0,qhbUNmiGKmw343Fj7qlEsQ,"Ordered the Veggie Burger for take out, and it was really nothing to brag about, the whole presentation was pretty boring. I figured something called the 'Harvest Cafe' who brags about 'fresh ingredients',  would know a thing or two about making a 'vegetarian' burger, but I was wrong. First off, the menu says that it comes with sprouts (which was what I was really looking forward to), but it just ended up coming with iceberg lettuce (which I can't stand Iceberg). Also, the patty was really thin and dry ( I could have just thrown a Morning Star patty in the microwave and got the same results) and the bread was really thick for such a little patty. Even the avocado was dry, if that makes sense. Nothing else on the burger (tomatoes, onions) made it any more flavorful. I would suggest that if you are going to serve a vegetarian burger at your restaurant that you at least try and include the vegetables you promised on your menu, and maybe try to have a little more imagination. But the disappointment sadly doesn't end there. My husband ordered the Harvest Burger, and says that it was also pretty boring, and so were the fries, which were a little too firm. He said he would rather have went to 5 guys or even Denny's. I guess when you open up a restaurant on a street that has dozens of places that serve 'diner food', especially burgers, you get a lot of picky people. 

Anyhow, this place just didn't stick out for us. It's really nothing special. However, I might give it another shot for breakfast some time.",ErtKNkBDDXXynapuaZ4x7A,0,0,2,9Oo3oWX964x_ksx2zi4E4A
