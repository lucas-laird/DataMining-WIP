We went to NYC last month and this is the best pizza I have had in years! Got a pepperoni pizza  and a pitcher of goose island IPA and I can't wait to be back in town to to get this pizza again. Added the garlic and oregano per the owners recommendation. He was so right!,WIPEWwLi17U-Zc-bb_Midg,1,1,5,ErQSloItfYkw1xOdDS4tXw

The garlic knots and the pizza we ordered were both excellent.  Both are among the best in town and make the inconvenience of the downtown location more palatable.  The proprietor also threw in an order of wings at no charge so we could try them.  Very cool of him - didn't love these, though.  I might have, but they were really overcooked and it made them taste strange.  I was intrigued with the interesting seasoning they use on them.

The design of the restaurant could use work.  They've been open for a decent period of time now, but it still looks like a work in progress with these weird display pieces serving as a de facto temporary wall blocking off part of the room.  Kind of hard to describe.  There is virtually no ambiance or decor to the room.  

They also use paper plates.  I strongly dislike having my food served on a paper plate in a restaurant.  I'm not looking for fine china - just go to the dollar store and buy fifty cheap plates and wash them.  That will work perfectly.   

The aforementioned proprietor was very pleasant and repeatedly checked on our satisfaction.       Pizza Lotto is a good choice for pizza lovers looking for a casual experience.  I hope they are successful.",7jFoW90fQ4zR_3Dkz2W4nw,1,0,4,qe6sDSaugMYy3oh4iuyKNQ

2350984,2017-11-15,0,gtVPsVK83JkeyrN1C1ozeQ,"This place used to be our favorite spot downtown for pizza. But my god have they gone downhill!  The second to last time we went in, we got a Margherita pizza..  It had fresh mozzarella, fresh basil.. and dried Italian seasoning. A little off putting to say the least, but somewhat excusable. The guy behind the counter said that it was a new cook.. So we wrote it off as that. The LAST time we got a Margherita.. It was undercooked, which forced us to finish cooking it in the oven. Fast forward to tonight. Ordered a Margherita, and a Sicilian to take home..  The Margherita had ZERO fresh basil on it, this is a problem considering Margherita's always have basil.. Oh, but there was a generous portion of DRIED Italian seasoning..  So if this was from the ""new cook"" you're doing it wrong. The Sicilian was so over cooked, the crust was like cardboard, a steak knife struggled to get through it! The crust was way over salted, I felt like I had been licking a salt lick after eating a piece. 

To be fair and honest, she refunded our money over the phone, and didn't require us to bring the pizza's back downtown. That's the ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars, and not 1. 

This was incredibly disappointing considering we've been there more than a dozen times, and have ALWAYS loved the pizza. I guess it's Evil Pie for us from now on. Unless this ""new cook"" gets some serious training, and we're proven that it's back to the way it used to be..  We won't be back.",1oV4mY3GnNOZmGq8IYYL1w,0,0,2,HeCakrDUSuugOSvbG1-zfg

However,  if you know that making a great pizza is an art, where every element, from properly fermented dough to the right oven and cooking temperature, to the freshest ingredients, is what it's all about, then  this place can be crossed off your list.

I wouldn't say it's completely inedible, it's just forgettable....as Woody Allen said: ""sex is like pizza, even when it's bad, it's good"".

Pizza Lotto was the oasis in the desert. I saw there was a deal for a slice of pizza and a craft beer (probably Oscar Blues type beer, I think I had a couple that night...) I had to rub my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. During the two days of the festival, there were plenty of people taking advantage of the pizza.

I had some bites of a white pie that was also delicious.

We sat down at a table to look over the menu and when we were ready, we headed to the counter to place our order. Our drinks were quickly delivered to our table and then, a basket of the most amazing Garlic Rolls (NOT KNOTS!! As they say on the menu) were brought to the table. The rolls were dripping with XVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil), grated Parmesan and Romano cheese and fresh herbs. Our Calzone and Stromboli soon followed as well as a Funghi Bianco drizzled in truffle oil. We ordered a variety of Stromboli's, all 3 that were on the menu to be exact. Chicken Parmigiana, Sausage and peppers, and Italiana were the three they offered and boy were they delicious. The Meatball Calzone was by far the best I have ever had! Mama Della, wherever you are, God bless you! The Funghi Bianca would even make Chris at Pizza Bianca Proud. The only bummer was that we came in before they had their beer and wine license, therefore, no booze. We were told that they should have beer and wine within the next week or so. Oh Yeah!

I could have ordered and paid online and they would have had to make it... I'm on Vacation right now and work in the Industry and if someone wants a drink a half hour before we close you better believe i am making that drink with a big old cheesy smile on my face because thats what we do and how we keep our customers happy!!

I was so relieved!

I tried the cheese pizza and the beer.  It was ok, nothing too special, just reminded me of New York. 

It must have been better than I thought, because I found myself there the very next day.  Worker was nice and recommended the white pizza.  That was really good!  There was also somebody playing cool live music in the restaurant.

My to my pleasure, when you go to the website you're greeted with an online ""slot machine"" wherein you can win various items from the restaurant. I lucked out and won a free slice.

The next day my husband and I decided to cash in the free slice and purchase one, too, as a snack while we were walking around town. We got a slice of classic cheese with marinara and a slice of the white pie with ricotta. Both slices were traditional New York style. Both slices were very much enjoyed.

The service, however, is what I mainly wanted to review. We were greeted by one of the owners, Max. He was very down to earth, super friendly, and we very much enjoyed chit-chatting with him as we ate our pizza slices. My husband wanted to be sure to return and support the business, due largely in part to Max's great personality, alone!

I had a slice of four cheese and my boyfriend had the pepperoni. Both were perfectly cooked with a crunchy but fluffy crust and the perfect amount of cheese. They had a guy playing live guitar which we really enjoyed listening to. Ricardo checked on us often and supplied plenty of napkins. He took our trash when we were done and I was a very happy camper. Their prices are very reasonable and a steal on National Pizza Day (whole pizzas half off)! We'll be back tonight to take a whole one to go!
