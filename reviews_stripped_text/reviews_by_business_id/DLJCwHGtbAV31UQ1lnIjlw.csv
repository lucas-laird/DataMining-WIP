The food is 3.5 star. Most of their dishes come with home made pasta. Their meats and cheeses are said to be aged and cured in house- which were delicious. Their desserts need some work. We ordered the tiramisu, which lacked the rum, so it was dry, a banana split that was made with gelato and the canolis. The cream in the canolis had too much citrus, it was overwhelming. 

The bar has several different types of wine, but they don't know how to make an old fashion. When I described it, they literally threw an orange slice and a cherry into a big glass of bourbon. 

The reason for the 4 star was because of Pasquale.  He makes this restaurant. His service is so personalized and so genuine. Although it wasn't busy, he made us feel like the only table in the restaurant. We will come back because of him.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,1,2,4,JiUjb7q1tw0mS9fVA5WWBw

58349,2017-10-30,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I'd visited this neighborhood establishment a few years ago to have drinks and had a good time. Fast forward my husband and I decided to have dinner/music at Siena a couple of weeks ago. Prior to going for dinner, I'd read a review that a customer experienced poor service that she felt was due to her party not ordering cocktails with dinner. I thought nothing of this review until we experienced the same. Upon our arrival to Siena (about 7:45pm/Saturday night) we were greeted by the bus boy immediately. Unfortunately the waitress arrived much later. We noticed she would disappear for long periods on this seemingly un-busy evening. After we ordered dinner (no cocktails) we became famished. It took over 50 minutes for our Shrimp dishes to prepare. We prepared to walkout however the food arrived at that very moment. Our plan was to have dinner then take in some cocktails/music at the bar afterwards. Despite the poor service we stuck with the plan and had martinis at the bar. The atmosphere (new d√©cor) and the music were a nice touch but not enough to alleviate the poor dining experience.
We won't be back. I should add that my husband NEVER complains. On this occasion he actually directed me to take the time to share our experience with others. Choose another Italian restaurant.",1gIG8Nkk4Tp22oFFsoz6uw,2,1,1,CwlTuyXqEVEB5-_w4fgqaA
62622,2013-02-10,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"For 25 years since I've lived in Las Vegas I always went to Siena Deli on Trop & Eastern for the ""Best Fresh Hot Italian Sausage"" and finally I get the chance to get over to the fancy new location on West Sahara to get out fix.  The Siena deli is now by far much more organized, lavished and beautiful.  However, their sausage is now a whopping $7 bucks a pound (it use to be $4-5 per pound)........but no biggie, everything has gone up.  I was so excited to taste it, so I get home, my hubby makes his sauce opens up the bag to add the sausage and first thing I notice is the sausage has no color (hot is usually red from the pepper and spice) and just by the look we can tell it is not the same quality and not to our surprise the flavor is not the same either.  The new product is mediocre, boring, and basically tasteless....total bummer and a big disappointment.  If you step it up & spice it up, we may be back but for 7 bucks a pound it better be made with kurobuta pork.  Too bad, it is so sad to see that another good ole Vegas establishment gone bad.

100402,2011-01-31,2,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"This review is for the Trattoria half of this business. I am a long time customer of the Siena Deli that was at Tropicana and Eastern. I used to eat lunch there whenever I was within 5 miles when I used to have my mobile computer repair business in Las Vegas. After I moved to Colorado I always ended my road trips to Vegas with a stop to get lunch and to purchase some sausage or other Italian meats to put in a cooler to take home with me. So when I heard that Siena closed my old favorite Deli and opened a Trattoria/Deli I couldn't wait to give it a try. Needless to say by my 3 stars that my first trip to the new place wasn't a good one, if it wasn't for the food I would have given them 1 or 2 stars and maybe my Italian anger is still too strong to write a fair review but here's what happened. 

My wife had received an anniversary coupon from their email club so when we were back home on a business trip celebrating our anniversary we drove all the way up the west end of Sahara. My wife ordered the Ravioli Burro E Salvia (Cheese Raviolis on Marinara with a butter sage reduction) and I ordered the Sausage pinwheel with a side of Broccoli Rape, I always knew this as Robbies, Broccoli Rabe or Rapini. My wife loved her Raviolis and I really enjoyed the Sausage. But when I asked the waiter if they had Broccoli Rabe thinking that it might be out of season and he said yes, I was excited as it's hard to find in Denver and I love Robbies. When my meal was delivered on my plate was Broccoletti or Broccotini, I told my waiter that this was not what I ordered but he insisted that what was on my plate was ""Rapini"". Then to try and convince me he called over another waiter and he also argued with me saying that the Broccoletti was Broccoli Rabe or Rapini. Now, I've been eating Broccoli Rabe my entire life and know the difference between the two and getting into an argument with 2 NON-Italian waiters over what I ordered made me very angry on a night I was trying to celebrate my anniversary. I told him to tell the chef that what he served me was not Broccoli Rabe. When I finished my Sausage the waiter returned saying that the chef apologizes and offered us a dessert compliments of the house. This started to make me feel better. He took away my plate with the Broccoletti that I didn't eat and brought us our dessert.....Spumoni. On their dessert menu they described the Spumoni as chocolate, pistachio and strawberry gelato with whipped cream. What he brought was only chocolate and pistachio gelato, no whipped cream but it was very good anyway. I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth and was thankful for the free dessert. Then I got the bill. They charged me $2.00 for the Broccoletti that I did not order or eat! I waited for the manager to come to the table but I guess an unhappy customer wasn't worth his time. 

When I go to an ""Italian Authentic Trattoria and Deli"" I don't want to order something ""Italian"" from their menu and then told by two Spanish speaking waiters that I don't know what I ordered. I predict that Sienna will go out of business if they don't hire better waiters that know about Italian foods and what is on their menu. Arguing with Italian customers in an Italian restaurant over Italian food is just plain stupid. If I wasn't with my wife I might have reacted a bit differently and the manager wouldn't have had a choice but to intervene.",ZQyOz3H-dZ88qg1jEKSjLw,7,1,3,Oge1MKZY-LYYvF5YVpdSNA

198782,2014-10-29,1,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"We visited Siena in the past on two occasions and thought it would be a great location to celebrate a birthday - made a reservation in advance just in case since there are 7 of us all-together.  The table was waiting for us on arrival so that was great to not have to wait. 

While waiting for everyone to arrive, we decided to order a bottle of wine and some appetizers.  Did not realize that all the advertisements for Happy Hour only apply to the Bar area - not to the main dining room.  Either way, we ordered the charcuterie board and some fried calamari and a bottle of wine. The bread service came with a small amount of sliced bread and a large amount of 'lavosh' and a small ramekin of olive tapenade.  Not enough bread, especially with the meat and cheese platter we ordered.  Had to ask for more as well as some oil and vinegar - this would normally be brought out with the meat platter automatically.  Not the case.

Once the rest of our party arrived, we proceeded to order some salads and main courses.  The burratta appetizer/salad had a good size portion with a few small sliced heirloom tomatoes and olives.  The other salads were nothing to write home about - the Caesar had a large amount of croutons and very little dressing as well as Ruchetta which was a very small portion (although we did order the small) and again, little dressing.  Our dinners came out just as we took our last bites of salad.  

One guest had the Linguine Vongole - this was the absolute worst ""linguine and clams"" I have ever experienced.  There was no seasoning/herbs present in the broth and all of the clams that were on top for garnish, had NO clams inside!  No amount of salt and pepper could save this dish.  The Cavatelli con Salsiccia looked extremely dry with very little tomato sauce.  We tried rescuing it with some leftover sauce from the calamari.  It actually looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for the rest of the dishes. The other dishes (Rigatoni, Gnocci, Penne Vodka, Ravioli, Lasagna) were all just OK.  The server did come back and ask how everything was so I can say the service was good; however it was not worth sending the dishes back as we were not confident in anything being better.

Being that it was a birthday, I had asked if they could bring out a cannoli with a candle - no problem receiving this however it was the worst cannoli we have ever had.  We could not determine what was in the filling (there was a distinct alcohol taste that we could not figure out).  We asked the server what the filling was made with and were told ""ricotta and cream"".  NO WAY!  My guess, amaretto of some sort.

Overall, what we thought was going to be a great family dinner turned out to be just a sub-par dinner with good company. I can say for sure that we will NOT return.  Clue to a bad dinner:  when you walk out from a $300 meal and need to hit the closest In-and-Out drive thru!!!",g4mQguxC5KJ1iJTxgmD-lQ,4,2,1,OkiUg7WU1jJ7xlX5asQPYA
220014,2016-03-25,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I recently moved to Las Vegas and had a truly delightful experience at Siena Italian restaurant yesterday, one which I am still contemplating. For some time now I have had a deep feeling of sorrow of times past when one could go to a restaurant and have a REAL meal and enjoy a feeling of authenticity with both the food and with who is serving you. An authentic Italian meal where the meats are processed on the premise, the pastas and breads are made fresh and the server, a true Italian gentleman, explained the meals and offered to change whatever I may not like. 

I loved everything. The food was real food, prepared like it has always been done for generations. The atmosphere reminded me of my childhood when my family would go to a nice restaurant. It was a privilege to dine out and we would dressed up, always on our best behavior. I remember then the linen table clothes and the servers attention to detail. The fresh dinner rolls and so on. This place has the same ambiance. 

This place, it is not just a restaurant, but a place out of time to give you the gift of memories, whether the atmosphere triggers it or the food itself...this place made me feel at home for the first time since I moved here. It made wish that I was Italian for just a bit.:) I had remarked to my husband that I couldn't remember the last time that a meal made me this happy, where you moan with delight...certainly the Torta Lunga did that for both us! 

This is the place to bring your friends and family too. I am also delighted to read that they also have bands that play on certain days in both the mid morning and evening.

After our lovely dinner we browsed the deli area and felt so blessed to have this deli/ restaurant down the street from where we live. 

Thanks to Pasquale for a wonderful experience. Deborah",TmryBgIy1L6Bopd563Izdg,0,1,5,WAN_zS4fy66XIVB8wvRSUA

They have it all; a fresh deli case filled with pancetta, mortadella, homemade Italian sausage, olive bar and cheeses to a freezer filled with home-made pasta and a hot entree bar. They offer dry goods that range from jars and cans of imported tomatoes, sauce, bruschetta, peppers and outstanding dry pasta. And they have home-made gelato in your typical Italian flavors... highlighted by the spumoni and pistachio! And don't forget about the bread case... from chibiatta to round, yummy loaves of goodness crispy on the outside and soft inside! A little imported olive oil and you're done! 

You can eat in the casual deli... or  the restaurant which is comfortable and unassuming. We came back for the restaurant and were not disappointed. Everything our party ordered was fresh and authentic.  We stared with a different and delicious Ruchetta salad containing arugula tossed with figs and dry ricotta, Champagne vinagrette & figs glace. The cream sauce of the fettachini alfredo was outstanding.  Try the Cavatelli con Salsiccia, a rustic dish filled with a spicy sausage ragout, fresh herbs, tomato sauce & Pecorino Cheese.

418396,2013-02-20,3,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"Do NOT believe the hype. I have been here four times.  Each time something worse happens. I'm not sure who is to blame for the poorly behaved and badly trained wait staff, but one thing I can say for sure, after the fourth visit, is that the poor service and way below average food quality are definitely consistent!

My last (and final) visit to this restaurant included:  frozen, reheated crab cakes, that were disgusting; an 11.00 spinach salad that consisted exactly of spinach, six raw walnuts, and 5 pieces of artichoke hearts;  and then there was the entree.  The entree was our final knife in the gut and pocket book.  We ordered the lobster and steak special.  We specifically asked the waiter for a filet cut of steak.  He served us a small piece of grisly meat that my giant, sharp, steak knife, literally could not cut through!  When we told him it was not filet, he was condescending and rude and acted like we didn't know what we were talking about!  Grrr!  

We were highly insulted that they would pass this horrible quality and poorly made menu items off as authentic Italian cuisine. If that is authentic Italian cuisine, no one would ever lay claim to it!

The manager half heartedly apologized, although she seemed more worried about upsetting the condescending waiter than she was concerned about our horrible experience, and she removed the uneaten special from our bill.  

I have not ever wrote a bad restaurant review, however, they should not be able to get away with this in a city filled with amazing restaurant options.   I hope that they can address their issues and be an asset to our community in the future.",r9ZXiFR5EnnJUbf_5gBVpw,10,2,1,tZ7k8yiMVIy_ChcvCWYE_g

All of the Yelp reviewers criticizing this establishment are spot on...
Server? Rude. Very rude. I also had to keep reminding the person to bring me things I requested earlier. I finally gave up. 
Food? Not great. My entree had over cooked pasta. My dining companion's lasagne had cold meatballs in it. My cookies looked and tasted old. I bit into one and it literally crumbled into pieces. I ended up ""trying"" them all, but eating only one. 
Entertainment? A bit loud, but the band was tight and the drummer was amazing.

Todd, the guy who tends bar is funny, very spirited, but above all makes fantastic cocktails. And, seriously...could the staff be anymore good looking?! John Carlo, the owner, he must be there nightly because every time I've been in he's there, but not in a ""boss"" checking up on his staff kind of way, but being a part of what is going on.

We ordered the vegan healthy pasta. I must say the pasta was absolutely fabulous,, we had asked for extra vegetables. The restaurants charged $3 extra per plate for the extra veges. I would have thought it would have been prudent for the waiter to let us know of the extra charge but this was not the case.. Also, since they had to open a brand new pasta box for the whole wheat penne, they asked if we want to take the remaining pasta home at a charge of $3.. We ended up paying about $20 per pasta plate.. Granted the pasta was really well done, I am not sure if $20 per pasta plate for a neighborhood restaurant is worth it..

The service was good.. Our waiter was extremely friendly..

We stood waiting for attention at the counter for about 5-10 minutes before being acknowledged, but we got our order in, got some drinks paid and sat down to wait for the food, which came pretty quickly.
The caesar was great. Our sandwich ( the Siena chicken cutlet) was bland but big. The Cavatelli with Ragout was just as flavorless but considering it was the signature pasta dish according to their posted menu, it was terrible. The Italian dude that served us was cool though and took care of our table. Groovy Italian music videos gave the dining space some ambiance. 
Prices have gone up since they posted their menu online. 

They seem like nice people and there were some potentially good choices in the deli cases, and we had high hopes after the glowing reviews, especially after getting into the caesar salad, but the experience took a nose-dive with the main dishes. $40 after a tip and a couple sodas for crummy food.  We probably won't make it back to try the pizza. Sorry boys.

For main course I ordered the special of the day which was seared ahi tuna. It was charred and totally cooked thru. It was more like a tough steak than a piece of fish. I sent it back and ordered the salmon instead. The salmon was burned as well and so salty it was inedible.

981237,2012-01-30,1,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"This place makes me sad.  For so many reasons.  I so wanted it to be good.  I'd so enjoyed the food over the years at Siena's (now closed) location near UNLV.  Walk in, it's pretty, it's dark, obviously what someone's been dreaming of for years.  The menu is pretty large, but it's one of those menus where you look at it, and there's nothing that jumps out at you.  OK, maybe that's just my taste...  

A salad was so drenched in dressing I felt sorry for the spinach (and it should've been called a 'walnut salad' not a spinach salad since it was chock-full of walnuts, but not much spinach...weird...)  A pizza was solid (it's always been one of their strengths,) and pretty good value...easily big enough for 2 people (or 1 person's dinner AND lunch the next day.)  

I took a peek into the deli next door and it was the familiar Siena fare, although it seemed pricier than the original location (like I never remember paying $7.99 a pound for their hot sausage.)

Finally, our waiter just kinda seemed to be wandering around aimlessly a lot of the time.  As I've mentioned before, I hate places where runners and bus staff have to pick up the slack all the time for less-than-competent waitstaff, and that was definitely the case here, at least with our waiter.

My husband and I stopped in for an early dinner last night. Happy hour was in full swing in the bar, but we chose to sit in the restaurant. They have half-price bottles of wine on Tuesdays, so that was a bonus! We split a bottle of Sangiovese, which was also offered by the glass. And then we perused the menu, which offered the old classics along with a few modern twists.

Although we weren't too hungry, we couldn't pass up an appetizer of four meats brought over directly from the deli next door. We chose mortadella (fancy bologna), prosciutto (fancy ham), sopressata (fancy salami), and bresaola (fancy chipped beef). My husband is crazy about mortadella, and he said this one was great. I'm not a big fan of mortadella (although I did try a slice), but I really liked the other three meats, especially the bresaola. The meats were served on a long platter with a few olives as garnish. They also offer an assortment of cheeses this way; too bad they don't have a mix-and-match meat and cheese platter as an option. (I guess you could create one yourself, but I didn't see anything offering less than four choices, and four meats and four cheeses would have been a lot for just us two.)

For our entrees, I had the ravioli burro e salvia, which is cheese ravioli served on marinara and topped with a brown butter sage sauce. I liked this a lot, although I could have done without the marinara; the butter sauce was fine on its own. My husband got one of the daily specials: riblets with a side of pasta. An Italian restaurant is the last place I would expect to find riblets, but these certainly fit in with the Mediterranean-themed menu. They were lightly seasoned and grilled over the wood fire, and the pasta was nicely dressed with parm. Sides and salads were extra, and we had neither, although we didn't really need them because we both ended up taking home leftovers.

Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food would make any true Italian proud. I can't wait to go back to the deli to pick up some bresaola (and some mortadella for the spouse), or maybe stop in for happy hour to try half-price apps and drinks.

Our server made me feel very confident about what I had ordered because his eyes rolled up and he said that it's amazing and that he would actually have that for lunch himself that day as well.

The deli & bakery side has glass cases of breads, cakes, cookies etc. I originally wanted a sausage sandwich (the sausage is made fresh at the restaurant) but they were out for the day so we ordered a meatball and Sicilian sandwich. Both were good and affordable. The meatball sandwich was cheesy and the sauce had a good taste. I don't know how many meatballs are supposed to come on it but they weren't shy with them at all. The Sicilian sandwich had a lot of flavor for not looking like much. There was either an Italian dressing or maybe oil and vinegar on it but whatever it was I liked it. The bread on the sandwiches was good but I picked out a loaf of bread from the bakery and it wasn't as soft and fresh tasting as I hoped for.

Now we're both biased so I suppose our expectations were super high, nonetheless I ordered a mortadella (imported) sandwich and although it wasn't exactly what I was hoping it did satisfy my Italian deli sandwich craving.  

They do not have po'boys or godmothers or any of that but if you know what's in any of those Italian sandwiches I'm positive they can hook it up.

You know you have a VERY good friend when they share snacks like this with YOU!  Especially when these beautiful tasty morsels are no where to be found within 2,500 miles.  My girlfriend from Naples LOVES these treats...but she is so loving and giving that she shared the only one in her possession, (which her most wonderful husband hauled all the way back from California) with me. We sat there and split it, did not speak as we licked our fingers until every crumb was gone.  We just stared at our empty plates with despair.  Knowing we would never be able to eat this again for months, maybe years to come.  We started planning a trip to Italy, which can't come soon enough!

I don't usually get a sweet unless I can share it.  If I have to choose between dessert and a glass of wine when it comes to calories, wine usually wins.  But this treat is not too sweet, it's just simply amazing.

Fast forward to this morning...Siena, half restaurant, half bakery/deli, in Summerlin.
We arrive mid morning to find the case empty!  OMG, shouldn't have stayed out so late last night, we missed it!!!  Why couldn't we get here earlier?!  So many reasons, too many to count...at any rate sadness turns into happiness as soon as I explain my despair to Fabio.  He tells me wait 30 minutes, he will bake more!
Really?!?! Of course we will wait.  I'd wait all day for this amazing creation. 

Walking around their take out gourmet food section could easily take half an hour!  Salami, cheese, prosciutto sampling cut to perfection.  The couple at the table next to us, from Milan, happily sharing their pistachio mortadella and piping hot baguette with us!Exactly 30 minutes later...voila!
Fabio returns with lattes,  cappuccino's and 4 piping hot sfogliatella's!!!  6 more made to bake at home to go! All magically appeared and disappeared all within one hour of being in this authentic Italian bakery/deli. 
I have to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming.  This pastry was done to perfection!  Not sweet, cream filled, flaky, hot, crispy and ooohh soooo gooood with the strong Italian espresso.  Just what we needed.

If only I could only learn to make these little wonders at home.  I ask Fabio to explain...his hands fly up in the air!  Much too difficult!",HUQ5bf1lS6uJ2NbXi_z36w,8,7,5,xf1-Dhewnw8YjrHFLdDBsA

Half of the building is an upscale restaurant and half is a grocery/deli you can dine in- immediately turn to your right upon entering to to to this section. The other half is basically for upscale dinner-quality dates.

The bakery-deli-grocery has everything you could possibly need from fresh pastas to calamari salad to real canned peeled San Marzano tomatoes for kitchen adventures and more marinated artichokes, olives, and peppers than you can shake a stick at.

Order at the back counter for takeout or dine-in: the first sandwich listed on the ""hot"" page is what you want to get. It's a chicken cutlet with spinach, fresh cheese, and God only knows what else, and it's frickin' amazing.
Runner up is the Sicilian sandwich, the first listed on the ""cold"" page, with ham, Genoa, and mortadella with mozzarella- get it with everything on it. Fresh crunchy veggies, complementary spices and oil, and the freshest and most flavorful meats and cheeses I've yet encountered.  Both sandwiches are made with the freshest, most delightful french roll bread. Oh, and they're frickin' huge. Like half of a single sandwich is an entire meal, huge.

If that's not enough for you, there are two cases of desserts and the service is phenomenal- be sure to get the guy with the thick black-framed glasses, he's delightful!

They all had a great time.  She said the staff was so great.  The checks were all split up as needed with no problems, they never had to ask for refills and the ambiance was beautiful.  She said everyone loved their orders with one exception.  The vodka sauce, calamari, other seafood dishes were amazing, but the the lasagna was the only dish that wasn't loved.

He got a little busy (not full bar busy) and it was forever for my husband to get a 2nd glass of wine, I tried and my glass was empty for 20 minutes we finally asked for the check...3 times, then had to wait and wait and wait. A couple sat for a half hour waiting to cash out, he held their card, and they had no choice but to wait. I had to ask how long we had to wait before we walked out with out paying, it was that bad. 
Tonight we went in for dessert and ordered a full tiramisu. It was made with whipped cream. Not just whipped cream on top, all throughout the cake. Being Italian you know better. It was greasy whipped cream, meaning not fresh homemade whip cream, but the stuff you pipe out of a bag made with hydrogenated oil.

place looked good. We got a chopped salad that was excellent and Lasagna which was super good and The Healthy Choice which was whole wheat angel hair pasta, with fresh tomatoes and sun dried in a marinara sauce that was also good, once it was replaced as they first brought out whole grain spaghetti and I was told they were out of the whole grain angel hair pasta so replaced it with whole grain spaghetti and I said no way I ordered angel hair pasta that is my favorite and after talking to the manager they replaced it with regular angel hair pasta which was ok.

1. Bakery and deli on one side with small Italian grocery store.  This place came highly recommended by a friend especially the frutti di mare.  They are known for Italian desserts.  
2. I loved the bread basket, as I usually do, with the tapenade it is like crack in spread form!!
3. Bruschetta was a little soggy from the tomatoes.  The bread could have been a bit more toasty
4. I had the best best white zin here - Bel Arbor from California.  Usually I don't get anything out of a glass of wine but this one definitely had a taste of grapefruit, and I finally finished a glass of wine.  
5. Entree didn't have the best presentation but the piccata sauce was delicious nicely tangy.  
6. Desserts are Italian favorites!  I got the sampler 

Service
1. Server was great!!!  
2. Front desk and bakery was less friendly.  
3. I felt like it was harsh, maybe this is Italian style 

Ambiance
1. Ambiance in other photos mainly showed the deli but the sit down restaurant is more sleek and modern
2. See photos

He left the pitcher and within a couple minutes he came and took it saying his manager would not allow this. 

The food comes and just prior to making room on the table for the plates he coughs into his hand and then moves my silverware. I asked if he was out of his mind and gave me a blank look. I asked him to wash his hands prior to placing the plates and to secure me new utensils.

2558852,2007-02-23,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"Another awesome review for Siena.  I've been going there for years, and in those years I have never had a disappointing experience.  The character of the place, first of all, is fantastic.  The deli counter is lively and bustling, the market area, although small, is crammed full of interesting goodies that beg to be taken home and placed in your pantry, and the dining area with the red and white tablecloths all lend the place a homey feel - if your home happens to be Italy or even Little Italy.  The breads up front always tempt me with their fresh, crusty look and the cheese selection is dynamite, outta sight.

Their lasagna is absolutely heavenly, their Sicilian pizza wins over everything else in town that tries to come close, and the garlic knots will make you unkissable for days but you won't even care because they're that tasty.  Their deli salads are all superb, apparently even the calamari salad. (I am not touching that with a ten foot pole though.)   The most amazing, splendiferous thing about Siena?  They are awesome, honest, just-plain-good people.  One day I lost my wallet there and spent hours panicking.  I called Siena and they hadn't seen it until later in the day someone was sweeping by the register and my wallet had been kicked under the cabinet that holds it.  They found my business card inside and called me at work.  My wallet was returned to me, all eight measly dollars, ATM cards, and identification accounted for.

2640846,2014-09-26,5,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I visited Siena on Tuesday with a bridal shower party of 16. The private room we were given was beautiful, but that was the end to the perks of the restaurant. The bread service had pita chips and bread with an olive tapenade. It comes in ramekins that hold 1 tablespoon of tapenade, and given to share among 4 people. So, we were pretty much all able to have 1 slice of bread with tapenade on it. Wonderful!

We split an aragula salad which was actually very tasty. It had figs and some tasty cheese, but a tad too much dressing. That was the best part of my meal. My mother-in-law next to me ordered the penne (I think) and the pasta looked homemade. I suppose that's the one up-side of this place. Several of the pasta dishes looked like it was homemade pasta, but me, wanting to be healthy, opted for something low-carb. When it came to ordering, I opted for the salmon with a side of asparagus (4 stalks). My friend next to me ordered the same thing, and we were both incredibly disappointed. The salmon looks like it was butterflied in half so that we each got about 3 oz. of salmon that was incredibly thin. Mine was over-cooked to say the least, but hers was burned. The whole outside was black and charred... Unfortunately, the salmon which came highly praised by the waiter (whom I only saw one time when he took my order), was so small that I ended up starving and eating a bunch of bread just to fill up. So much for low carb. 

Since our party was so large, there was an automatic 20% gratuity attached onto it, which would be fine, if I ever got a refill on my water glass. I was so thirsty, I almost drank my friend's water. Sorry, but I will never be back. I think most of the people at my table shared this sentiment. My total for half a of a salad, very poorly cooked, thin salmon, and 4 stalks of asparagus with 20% gratuity was $36. I think I could have purchased a weeks worth of wild salmon and cooked it better myself.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,8,3,2,-j29D0iuYR5_cRjH5PU5bw

  We were there this last Friday night for a birthday party and were fortunate enough to sample a number of dishes we hadn't ordered on previous visits. First and foremost on our last visit was the gnocchi with basil pesto. The gnocchi is far lighter than at most restaurants and the basil pesto was perfect. The pizza was also exellent! Thin, crisp crust made with double zero flour and charred to perfection. The antipasto platter is a great starter for any meal. Our meal ended with my favorite dessert, tiramisu and port! 

  Chef Giancarlo spent a great deal of time with us and made sure we all had a great time and an excellent meal. He even broke into his private stash of Lemoncello and had an after dinner drink with us. There aren't many places where the owner/ chef spend the time with the patrons that Chef Giancarlo does at Siena. If you like great Italian food and an all around cool spot, Siena is it!

My step son gave us a gift card for Christmas and I finally decided to use it. Here it goes;
 
I was weakly greeted upon entering. 
I told them I had never been there before blah blah. I called my husband to see what he wanted. I was going to get the meatball Parmesan but, when j asked if it was good the girl said "" if you like meat and cheese yes"". Obviously, if I was inquiring about it duh. Anyway, I changed my order to the Sicilian (which my husband ordered while I was on the phone getting his order in front of the girl worker). I asked for no ham. We discussed it for a minute or so. I took a look around prices seem high. I ordered a coffee it was very good. They use  Lavazza Italian coffee. ( so. ?). 

The kid rings up my order. I sit and wait for my food about ten more minutes and I'm thinking "" God, this is taking long"". I ask ""is my foot ready""? Oh it was ready when you paid for it . I'm starving n I'm sitting here waiting. Really? Then, I look in the bag and I have one sandwich not two. Wtf? To be honest I would have rather gone to subway.

1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was ""that's how its served here"" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. 
When I asked her why the Merlot she said ""Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it"" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.

2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.

3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.

The presentation of my lasagna was nice -- sitting in a little sauce pan -- but the sauce was a little bland and there wasn't much meat in the lasagna. 

They don't have a kids menu but they suggested a slice of pizza from their deli instead of a regular sized pizza. We thought it was a good idea since he doesn't eat much, but after seeing the quality of the ""pizza"" they brought out we regretted the decision. First of all, they forgot the order and we had to remind them. It finally arrived well after the wife and I got our meals. What they brought out was a square pizza that looked like it was made that morning or earlier. They just tossed some cheese on top and reheated it. The quality of it was awful.

We did flag down a manager and voiced our concerns. She was nice enough and apologized, even taking the pizza off the check. They offered to comp dessert but we declined.

The restaurant was packed with plenty of older Summerlin folk. That's neither a compliment nor a condemnation, just an observation. It may be popular with some people, but not with us.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,3,2,L00k6_qEzB7O-LW4BC2tKw

I had been wanting to try this place and was surprised to find out they have a deli and restaurant! From the front of the building, the deli is on the right and the restaurant is on the left. 

I ordered a ""Sicilian Sandwich"" priced at $6.99 and a ""Meatball Parmigiana Sandwich"" also priced at $6.99 for hubby since he was lost looking at the bread loaves they had for sale. The girl behind the counter gave me a receipt and said I needed to pay the girl at the front. Heading towards the front I noticed some yummy looking desserts and decided to get a slice of ""Pecan Cheesecake"" priced at $4 per slice. Hubby picked out a focaccia loaf that cost $1.90 and we were set. 

The Sicilian sandwich was really good! It didn't look like there was much to it, but it packed a lot of flavor. Half way through our sandwiches, hubby and I decided to switch and the meatball sandwich was cheesy, delicious and something I would order again, but I liked mine better. I had the pecan cheesecake later for dessert and it was much better than other places around put out. The focaccia loaf however wasn't fresh. To be fair, we did come in just after 8 pm, so the bread was maybe baked earlier in the day, but they should mark the baked goods down after a certain point.

Everything is fresh, homemade (oh, that bread!), sausages, pizza, the sandwiches, hot or cold,  are amazing, and the desserts are incredible.  They even have a wide variety of olives.  They have a deli side and a more upscale dining experience in their restaurant located next to the deli.  We love eating our sandwiches on the their covered porch.  Very relaxing and inviting.

There was one piece of Reggiano in the case. A corner cut that had been passed over by everyone else. The lady would not cut me another piece. The cashier acted like she was deaf. The sausage I bought was rotten and I had to throw it away and go out again to another store.

This is a great place that my wife and I go to for fresh deli sandwiches. 

The service is always quick and pleasant every time I venture in here. All of the meats and cheeses are fresh making the selection of sandwich variations endless and very good.

The pasta salad and the cucumber are our favorite sides and a great refreshing add on during the hot summer months.

Siena's is a nice restaurant with a deli attached to the side. I was really surprised by the selection of food at the deli. There was also gelato and lots of cold foods but I played it safe and went with the Sicilian. Cashier was was very friendly and the service was fast. 

I would probably give this sub a 4/5. It was a delicious sub but I've had better. The bread was really good and it wasn't messy like other subs that I've had that are just prone to falling apart. 

I just really love that there's a freaking deli attached to this restaurant! I was expecting the sandwich to be pricey but it wasn't bad ($7.50 including tax).

I'm giving it an ok rating because I didn't experience the best tasting food at the time.  I got an Italian sandwich.  The bread was a bit big, and the bread was a bit stale like it should be with that type of bread, but it cut the roof of my mouth.  The sandwich wasn't anything great in particular.  The stuffed calamari didn't really smell right, and it was cold when I ate it.  I took it to school, but there wasn't a microwave around so I had to eat it like that.  Not sure if it was supposed to be like that anyways.  The food is an ok price.  The worker was very friendly, but when I asked what was good, the only response was that ""it's all good.""

3813510,2018-06-01,8,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"Lately I've been visiting local Italian restaurants and Siena was previously on my bookmarked but I haven't got the chance to try this place out. Until my most recent visit with my family, because it was my parents 36th wedding anniversary. They wanted something new to try out oppose to the norm and being Filipino my parents are biased to Asian cuisine. However, we decided to try this place out and was pleasantly surprised how delicious the food is. I do appreciate how spacious the restaurant is with 3 separate sections with the bar/lounge to the left once you enter. There is a main dinning room in the middle that had an intimate and modern appeal with a cool looking see-through wine room. Then to the far right side is the quick deli and market with imported Italian food.

Based on our dinner and service. My family and I were impress with the awesome service. Order was taken in a timely manner and came out according to our preference with appetizers to the main courses. The bruschetta was a favorite of ours, especially the fresh diced tomatoes and sauce even the texture of the bread was consistent without being too soggy or crispy. Calamari was breaded just right! So far appetizers were on point. All of our dishes was made just right with Frutti De Mari prepared to our expectations. This was the favorite among the dishes we had including my lasagna order. Layered with equal amounts of meat and cheese and was cooked well without being overcooked and runny. Onto to the desserts, the family got 3 different items: Lemon Ricatta Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Cannoli. The Cannoli was a hit with our party because it was fresh and had a balanced sweetness an airy crisp texture. Will need to come back! Overall we had wonderful time for my parents Anniversary. Special shoutout to the staff, ""Grazie Mille!"" :)

3858124,2013-05-11,2,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"So me and the wife went there on a Friday night for dinner. It was kind of late and the place was empty except for the bar area.

So we got seated the waiter came over took out drink order, got the drinks asked about the soups and was told that the soup we ordered had no meat on it got the soup and what do you know it had pork in it asked the waiter and his response was I didn't know there was any meat in there. Ok I know it happens once in a while so he took back the soup and got a different soup which had no meat in it.

On the main entree since it was late we decided to share the steak dish. The waiter takes our order not asking how we want it cooked. Steak comes out looks good and that was about it. Had the first piece which was chewy as gum. Then  took the knife to the second piece and the rest of it was so rare that it was purple inside. Called the waiter over and notified him about this tells us ok I will put it back on the grill to cook a little more. Wow! What put it back on the grill! After we touched it. We were both appalled at this so we asked for the manager.

Manager comes over tell her what the waiter was going to do and just side tracked and said oh we can get you a new dish. No I'm sorry, no the waiter said that by mistake! Nothing. Don't want to know what goes on in that kitchen!

By that time I was already turned off told her just give us the damn check!

One star in for the soup and salad we had otherwise no stars for this place!

I was tasty, but it was basically a marinara sandwich. They start with paper thin slices of eggplant & bread it on both sides more than tripling it's thickness. A few slices of that & a negligible amount of cheese & they call it am eggplant parm sandwich.

3920960,2018-04-01,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"The first time I went to Siena it was absolutely amazing. So much so that we talked about the food many times between December and this visit. I came in to town to visit family and this place was number 1 on my to visit list. We dined in on a Thursday evening. It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. The best thing I had that evening was the appetizer of different cured meats and cheeses. It is $24 so a bit expensive, but we shared it among 4 people. You can tell everything is fresh cut and it was just delicious. The other appetizer we shared were the mussels. In December, the mussels were amazing, buttery, and no fishy taste at all. This time not so much. We couldn't even finish them they were so fishy. It was a disappointment for sure. For our entrees I got the linguini with clams. Again, very disappointed. The clams were full of sand and the sauce had absolutely no taste. What a bummer. I was really looking forward to this meal and it just didn't deliver. I am hoping it was an off night for them. I will be back again and hopefully have a similar experience to my December visit. If you do go, splurge for the cured meat platter.

3931727,2016-08-31,1,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I was recently given this restaurant by a local in the Summerlin area as a must try for Italian. They have an Italian market and bakery attached to the restaurant and make their own bread and deserts.

I opted for an early dinner (Happy Hour time frame). I sat in the bar area and ordered a full meal. The bar was very large and there were about 16 people in the bar area enjoying their happy hour cocktails (40% off) and appetizer specials.

The Spicy fried calamari was a bit over fried. To me, it seemed as if it was frozen and fried out of the box. There was NO spice at all and the marinara that was served with it also had no spice. This dish could definitely use some work. 

The Italian Antipasto was exactly as expected. Fresh cured meats, cheese's, etc. 

The chicken marsala was very light and well prepared. The mashed potatoes were not too desirable but decent. I think a nice risotto would be a better accompaniment than the ""american"" mashed potato. 

The lasagna, my specialty being Italian, was a good portion but a dish full of sheets of pasta. Nice pasta but way too many layers with almost nothing in-between the sheets of pasta. I touch of fresh sliced basil across the top would have given a fresh pop to the dish. 

I will come back and try another dish or two but I will not do the lasagna or calamari again. 

Cannoli made fresh. Comes with chocolate chips. Didn't seem to have an option. I prefer options like almonds instead of chocolate chips. But, that is just me. The shell was done to perfection and the ricotta chocolate chip center was creamed just right. You must like chocolate and appreciate a perfectly cooked cannoli shell for this desert. It is a must try if you are a cannoli person.

The service was wonderful. Kind, polite, attentive and very helpful.

If you are looking for a good happy hour with a crowd in their early 60's on up this is your spot. Everyone at the bar seemed to be locals and enjoying each others company.",vZ-MSIB-HMO3YGNwiJak9A,1,0,3,8XLQEaqCf9FJy-Rq5_pl5w

I bought some boxes of frozen stuffed shells made in house and a container of their house made marinara sauce.  The result when I baked the shells was very good.  I took a look at the other frozen pastas they have, and while the price seems higher than supermarkets. I think the quality is higher.

Service was just OK.  Even though it was an hour before closing and no one else was in the store, I had to wait to ask a question until the two young guys on duty finished the conversation they were having.

4059051,2017-08-09,38,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"We were out in Summerlin for biz, and we happened to stop by Siena in a strip mall.  Its on Sahara near Fort Apache.

I started off w/ a small ruchetta salad w/ arugula & figs ($6).  For my main, I had an ortolana pizza w/ eggplant & asparagus ($14).  Siena offers a lot of sandwiches, salads, pastas and pizzas.  In addition, they have a deli adjacent to the restaurant.

First of all, the salad was very good.  You don't often see figs in a salad, and the sweetness contrasted well against the peppery taste of the arugula:  4 Stars.  On the other hand, the pizza was just OK.  The toppings were tasty, but the crust lacked any character.  In addition, the toppings weren't evenly distributed, and there wasn't enough to cover each slice:  3 Stars. 

Our waiter Tracy was very good.  He was friendly, attentive and on top of things.  Any special requests were filled quickly:  4 Stars.

Likewise, the ambiance is nice.  There is a large bar area to your left as you enter.  The main dining room is straight ahead, and the deli is to the right.  A nice feature in the dining room is a large wine display separating it from the deli:  4 Stars.

If you find yourself in the area, bag the rec for Nacho Daddy across the small side street.  Siena has very good food at reasonable prices, and the service & ambiance to match.  Plus 7% cash back w/ Yelp checkin and your credit card linked to your account.",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,50,46,4,p_24pP902Mohb3NYc_MntA
4103817,2010-01-12,1,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I was reluctant to give 5 stars to this wonderful deli... not because they didn't deserve it, but because I didn't want my first two reviews to be a 1 star and a 5 star. It looks like I am one extreme or the other -- but I was so impressed with this authentic Italian deli that 5 stars it is. Here's my story:
I was hopping from one yard sale to the next with a friend when she wanted to take me to lunch. She asked if I had ever been to Sienna Deli, and I said that I never even heard of it. It was decided that I had to try their Italian Combo sandwich.
Not quite a restaurant, this is more of an Italian Market than anything else. The deli counters are stocked full of meats and cheeses and more varieties of olives than I knew existed. There are rows of shelves stocked with grocery items -- presumably all imported directly from Italy. Sienna also features a dining area inside and an additional outside patio for diners.
We ordered our sandwiches at the counter (Italian Combos) and were given a number card to take to our table. The food is delivered by a waiter; thus it is not fast food in my opinion. The sandwich was warm from the oven with flavorful fresh bread that was toasted to a crisp crunch! Generously layered with ham, salami and cheeses I consider this to be truly authentic cooking. On the table were olive oil, balsamic vinegar (my favorite) and assorted condiments to suit anyone's taste.
The food was great... excellent even! I would recommend stopping in for lunch when you are in the neighborhood, as you will not be disappointed.
As for the shelves stocked with Italian groceries, that is another story. I find it difficult to pay $3.79 for a can of tomatoes, especially when the exact same item is available at the 99 cent only store. Though the grocery prices were close to four times the available price I decided I was reviewing the food, thus the five star rating. My final thought is this: If you are planning on sitting out on the patio for lunch you might want to reconsider. It looks like it has been a long time since the tables and chairs were hosed down. Eat inside.",Jql0kDX77dWUZcRzGjPXLg,4,2,5,KCd3vQWKWqkdXG7swCoqaQ

4172839,2018-05-14,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"As I'm reading all these reviews - one thing stands out. We are ALL COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SERVICE. I'm sure a manager or owner reads these (maybe they don't and that's the problem) but do something in regards to training your wait staff! I was so excited to try this place for Mother's Day, my husband surprised me with reservations. As we were seated at the booth in the far back next to the kitchen, the waiter, I didn't catch his name (he was a shorter Italian looking gentleman) came over And took our drink orders. My husband ordered a Coke light ice and I ordered a Coke with lemon. Not that complicated. Somehow our drinks came out with ice from the bottom to the top of the glass, and a lemon. First strike. We then ordered our food which came out in a reasonable amount of time considering it was a holiday. I had lasagna and my husband had the fettuccine Alfredo which was made with fresh pasta and I believe pancetta and it was delicious. We were enjoying our meal, and all of a sudden something on the other side of the wall apparently slipped off and splattered on my shoe. One of the waitresses apologized I believe it was in all of tapenade that spilled. No sign of my waiter at all. We finished our meal and I then asked to see a dessert menu, and I was excited to see they had sfigatella on the menu. The waiter wasn't sure if they had any left, went over to the deli side to check, left dessert menus on our table. I found that strange. They were all out unfortunately, so I ordered a small dish of hazelnut gelato. He came back over with a different flavor of gelato, not what I ordered. And a trio dessert plate which he left on our table. We didn't order it. At this point my husband and I looked at each other and were wondering what the heck was going on, because there was a dessert sitting at our table not ordered. And my husband joke to that perhaps this was a Mother's Day offering. The waiter then came back over with my hazelnut gelato, took the other one that I didn't order and also took the trio away without apologizing or saying a word. Very odd indeed. I'm so frustrated because I wanted so badly to love this place, it is less than five minutes from my house in the lakes. The whole experience was beyond strange, and that even spoke to the table sitting next to me, and they were complaining that the waiters forgot to put in part of their food order. I have to say the Hispanic woman that was taking care of refilling our drinks was absolutely wonderful, looking back I should've tipped her directly. I really am frustrated, and I do wish that the owners or managers way to train their staff to be more efficient and communicative. I'm on sure if I'll return at this point. We are enjoying our food yes. Was the service Bizzarre? Absolutely. I believe my husband still has the receipt from the restaurant, and if he does, I may be calling the restaurant today because the whole situation was just very odd. We left feeling confused. The food can be fantastic, but if the service is lacking, we most likely won't be returning. And I'm sure for every person that complains about the service publicly, there's 10 or 15 that don't, and simply will not visit your establishment again. Please do something about this.",85v1KB9pdxXGRGofblaMSA,1,0,3,8uIH6kxhZFd_ejPvKZHDxg
4178832,2013-10-08,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"We hadn't been back to Siena Trattoria for more than a year because last time we were there we weren't really impressed. Today was our 5 year anniversary and we decided to give it another shot. 

First thing I noticed upon entering was that they had undergone a nice remodel! Everything looked fresh and clean with modern cool colors. We chose to sit in the bar area as Happy Hour was going on and we wanted to take advantage of the special pricing. However, it was eerily quiet, as there was no ambient music playing and it was very easy to hear everyone's conversations as the tables are very close together. 

We found a table easily and were greeted quickly by Todd, who was very knowledgeable about the menu and happy hour offerings. We ordered some wine (a pinot noir and nero d'avola which were both delicious and about $6 each on the happy hour) and some appetizers right away. We were quickly and efficiently served water, a bread basket (which comes with a very nice olive tapenade for dipping) and our wine. Our food arrived quickly as well. My boyfriend ordered the beef carpaccio and cannelloni. I had the eggplant parmesan. I am a vegetarian and the happy hour menu was slightly lacking in vegetarian options so I also ordered  a pesto penne primavera from the regular menu. Everything was delicious but the eggplant was simply OUTSTANDING. The best I've ever had. it was thinly sliced and lightly battered and topped with mozzarella and just the right amount of marinara. Being a vegetarian, I've had a lot of eggplant but this was simply the best. The BF really enjoyed his dishes as well and my pasta was quite good also. I think they may have overhauled the menu as well during the remodel as it was way better than I remember from last year. 

The service was excellent, we were offered more wine, our waters refilled and dishes cleared in a timely manner. Everyone was friendly and knowledgable. Our food and wine were incredibly tasty. I docked one star for lack of ambience (no music at all! Not even for background) and I think they are kind of over priced in general but the happy hour pricing makes up for that. I wish we would have had room for dessert, they looked amazing! But we were so full we just settled for espresso which was delightful!

4341621,2015-01-19,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"Review of the Deli portion of the location.

I've been frequenting this deli as time goes by. As an East Coast transplant, this place really makes me homesick, by nourishing that part of me which misses all the little Italian delis and bakeries I would find back home. From the assorted bread, to the fresh pasta, the snacks and the hard to find antipasti. The prices are definitely high - you're in a desert oasis and they've imported most stuff from ITALY. So, I splurge here because it's worth it. And if we go often enough maybe the prices will go down. 

My absolute must-haves: biscuits (aka biscotti), pasta (dried, best prices!), cheese (marscapone best price anywhere!), torrone, pizza (literally the best in Summerlin). They even carry great cooking tools like paellas (the pan used for making paella), pasta machines, ravioli cutters, etc. 

When I came upon this place I nearly fainted. I wish the deli would triple in size! My hopes for the future: create a wine section, maybe some on tap, have a bigger pastry selection. All-in-all, love this place and it feels like a hidden gem.",peLy4yGo_3A5OzCZiYMoJA,5,2,5,C85b6NEtzjrUYkImXO_cqA

4355125,2017-02-16,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"After living in Las Vegas for a little over four years, and hearing remarkable things about Siena, I took some out-of-town guests there for dinner last night and had a less than desirable experience. I'm not a typical restaurant complainer, but with a restaurant as well known and regarded as this one, I simply expected better.

Let me start out by saying the food (for the most part) was delicious. I will say that they offer a ""create your own"" cheese plate. The portions of cheese were embarrassingly small. We actually laughed when it came to the table, because I've heard that Siena is known for their cheeses.

Now for the not so good:

First of all, we visited on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was not crowded. Our waiter had to have been new. He mumbled and we could barely understand anything he said. He seemed as though he would have rather been anywhere but there. He took our drink order and about 10 minutes later, returned to let us know the bar was out of one of the flavored vodkas required for the specialty martini featured on their drink menu. We clarified our drink order, and then it took another FIFTEEN minutes to receive our cocktails. We watched them sitting on the bar for most of that fifteen minutes. We had to ask for additional bread several times before receiving it. The service was definitely lacking, and I want to think that this was just a bad night, however, this was our first impression, and will likely be our last here. I was surprised that in a restaurant of this caliber that there was no visible management presence. We never had anyone stop to ask how the evening was going, nor was there anyone visible for us to bring our concerns to.

I hope that the team at Siena can learn from this review in an effort to delight their guests in the future.",Kpgc6qNkjpEfgQ9-zYWQsg,3,1,2,ZMFMz1_yGnsf-EKFrmpLUQ

I used to come here for their great ricotta. Thought it was Polly-O. They have huge gallons of it you can buy. I just picked up a small deli container. Bring it home - its not Polly-O (wat?!?) flavorless, runny and nowhere as good as the ricotta I got from them at their eastside location. Not sure what's up with that, but from now on I'm getting my (Poly-O) ricotta from the Roma deli on Spring Mtn. Also picked up a, $8 ball of mozzarella. No flavor. What's up with the cheese situation here, Siena. Italian and their cheese are supposed to be top notch, no excuses. At least make your own mozzarella in-house. Come on.  

I have ordered their grilled eggplant sammie before (again, from their eastside location) and it was great. Will report back at some point if its still quality on this side of town.

I don't know what else was in this dip but I couldn't stop eating it. I asked for seconds and on a side note the following week I made a special trip to their deli next door and bought more of it! 
I also had some minestrone soup while I was waiting for my entree. The soup was delicious with the fresh grated cheese on top of it. We also had the bruschetta to share. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. I tried their special which was a seafood pasta in a cream sauce. It was good but I really just wanted more bread and dip! 
We ended the meal with their dessert sampler which are regular sized desserts. When we asked the waiter what the choices were he said basically it is whatever they have left over. Our dessert platter came with canolis, cheese cake, tiramisu, and a chocolate mousse. They were so good! 

The restaurant and the deli have a nice ambience. The service was awesome! The waiter is the one who told me that they sell the dip in their deli so he was up there in my book.  I want to go back sooner than later and try more of their menu!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,2,4,mpq9wl4R7ai7NEpgv3gytw

4573750,2017-12-10,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I really enjoyed dinner at Siena. Haven't been in a couple years - but before the name change, I recall coming to Bartoloni's and liking that, too. Siena has a welcoming environment, not too loud, but still lively. The service, I thought, was excellent. Our server was Italian, and I found him to be helpful and gracious, possessing a gentle but wry sense of humor.

The app for the table was a big winner - and a surprise. When you order Calamari, in general, it seems like you're simply trying to please everyone at once - and usually at the expense of something great. Yay to Siena for dispelling that prejudice of mine. The dish was tasty, not greasy, and man, there was an ample amount for several nibblers. I also liked the tomato based sauce - which was a tad spicy.

My glass of white wine was refreshing. The second glass was even better (and seemed a bit larger, lol). It was recommended to me by our server - after I shared my tastes with him. Bullseye. Delish.

The entree was a special: Black Ink Pasta (Sciue Sciue) with shrimp and scallops. Though the red sauce also had some bite to it - it was very different from say, an arrabiata. (And yes, different from the dipping sauce from our appetizer). The Sciue Sciue was hearty, flavorful and I really liked it. Might be nit picking, but i wish there were just a tad more of the accompanying seafood. But, still a good dish that I'd definitely recommend.

I look forward to coming back sometime soon. And someday, coming by their retail store to pick up some pastas, sauces, and more.",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,0,1,4,oQN7eNOYJRHq-nxnP467tw

I've been here twice - and I had two totally different experiences, but this place (for the most part) is very well-run, so I'll give it four stars.

The first time I came here was a few Thursdays ago. There was a live band of a bunch of older guys and they were horrifically loud. I actually left the bar and went into the dining room to get away from the awful off-key singing and loud playing. My pasta that night was also a little undercooked, which I was definitely upset about... but the owner came out, apologized and gave a completely new pasta within minutes. 

Once I got my food fixed, I then realized Sienna has some of the best Italian food Vegas has to offer!! (FYI, they also have a deli... I took some cold cuts home with me... YUM!)

If you want my advice, come here on a Wednesday... I came last week and there is a guy singing to karaoke tracks but he is actually a very nice man and a very good singer, and he's not too loud unlike that Thursday night band. Also, it's not too crowded on a Wednesday. That's a plus. He asked me if I had a request which I thought was incredibly nice of him. I'm so sorry I can't remember his name, but I assure you he's a very nice kid.

So yeah, definitely come here on a Wednesday. They also have live music on Friday and Saturday nights, but I haven't tried out the other acts yet. I might give it a shot because their food, I assure you, is excellent.",_LEWW_dxGKz2UhbrNeagAg,0,1,4,FVyQAfwsB1XvRmqUwEsmGw

The server  gave us the dirtiest and most disgusted look like what we asked for was just plain wrong. Look, food was decent and thats what gave this restaurant 2 stars.

The food for happy hour was actually pretty good. I loved the calamari and the lamb chops. The lamb chops weren't gamey at all and both portion sizes were great.   Definitely the best out of the dishes we tried. The bruschetta was delicious, crab cakes were ok. A little over fried and not enough crab flavor.   The shrimp scampi needed some more garlic in my opinion but the shrimps were big and juicy.   Their cheese pizza is also not bad as well. The sauce is a little on the sweeter side though.

They had to slice up the steak, which is a bad sign right away on a piece of meat.  You wonder if it was too tough or in this case since it had some kind of smell, I wondered if the meat was bad.   I took half of it home and when I reheated it, it had a really really strong meat smell.  They also topped it with some kind of cheese, (cheese on steak? )  but anyways, I just thought it was to mask the smell.

5131187,2017-05-23,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I have been here a couple of times before during lunch time. I always got the pasta with a creamy garlic sauce and lobster, scallop, and shrimp. I usually get it substituted with angel hair pasta. I also really love the caprese salad. It was my absolute favorite Italian place with the amazing service and food. I raved about it to my husband because I usually came with a friend.
We decided to come in last night for my husband's birthday dinner. He had high hopes for this place because of my description. I came in and I was so disappointed because it was supposed to be special for my husband's birthday.
We were greeted by a friendly young man who graciously led us to a booth and made joke with us. He was incredibly helpful with explaining the special menu. He was the best person on staff tonight. I wish I got his name.
The server, William greeted us by asking us if we wanted to start off with waters. No smile. I told him iced water would be fine for me. My husband asked if there was sparkling water so the server said 'okay' and rushed off. He came back with a large bottle of Pelligrino and began to pour in the glass in front of me. I apologized and said the sparkling water was just for my husband. He looked at me as if I was being an inconvenience to him and told the busser 'can you get water for the lady?' And the both of them rushed off. It is fine that there was a misunderstanding but I didn't appreciate how he acted like I was a big inconvenience.
When he came to take our order, we ordered the bruchetta and marinara mussels for our appetizer. My husband ordered the rib eye and I had my usual pasta.
We had finished up our appetizers and 3 people walked by our table multiple times each, not bothering to pick up our plates after we stacked them. We were the only ones on the restaurant side. This usually wouldn't bother me but William's unkind attitude had me in a bit of a sour mood. 
Will brought out our entrees and left. He was not being friendly at all. He put me under the impression that I was being a bother to him when I did not try to cause an issue. He asked us if we wanted dessert and unfortuantely we were too full. I had thanked him and said we were full but the check would be great but he walked away in the middle of talking.
It really made me annoyed because I have always spoke positively about this place but last night's experience was not good.",ojMIkHP9M07O9SWOSggsRQ,1,0,3,M095wDqaTCQ8VmD58xu47g
5131774,2011-08-02,1,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I have been to Siena twice since they opened in the Lakes. I didn't know much about them and had no idea they had a location anywhere else in Las Vegas. So, I went with a frame of reference based on Italian restaurants and deli's I have eaten at back home in Texas. I took my fiance there for a nice Sunday lunch and at first I was bit intimidated by the atmosphere because it seemed a bit pretentious but once our waiter arrived, he put us at ease. They had different specials and they all sounded so tasty. We ended up getting 2 appetizers-The Burrata and the Buongustaio. I also got an entree -Penne alla Vodka- Prosciutto Sauteed with Vodka in a Creamy Tomato Sauce. I was stuffed beyond belief. My second visit to Siena was again on a Sunday but this time I went into the deli to order a sandwich. Well I ended up ordering The Sicilian Sub and Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella platter doused with olive oil. OMG! This is the food of the God's! Comfort food, but on a higher scale. I wish I could make this food at home but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't turn out the same. That is why I will defer to the experts at Siena. This classic Sicilian cuisine with a relaxed atmosphere and they treat you like you are sitting around the family table. Totally worth the money!",D0xvR8t3SWzVfs7oZQOKxg,2,1,5,o6y-tky0qvD6Us7ZtTnz8A
5134950,2011-10-25,0,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"This is the type of find that YELP was invented for.  The type of place you can't wait to review once you get back from your vacation.  The type of Italian restaurant that's worth a 20 or so minute drive off the strip to enjoy the next time I'm in town.  Yes, it's WORTH that inconvenience, providing you already have a car.

I grew up Italian and so it's one of the few foods I'm an expert on.  When you know a cuisine and visit a Italian restaurant, you can -- if you desire -- order the deal breaker dishes.  The men from the boys dishes, if you will.  When they hit the table, you'll know if you've found a gem.  I didn't mean to do this with Siena.  It just sorta happened by accident.  

My partner ordered a sun dried tomato angel hair pasta because she is vegetarian.  Believe it or not, there are two deal breakers there.  One, can Siena serve a vegetarian dish that a meat eater will not only sample but possibly order in the future.  Answer:  yes.  It was delicious without being over buttered, cheesed, or whatever.  Clean but crisp flavors, and yet with warmer undertones like a perfect cologne.  Two, angel hair pasta isn't worth ordering because most restaurants overcook it into a baseball of stringy goo.   Or they cook it okay, but it continues cooking on the dishes and dies before you finish it.  Nope.  Siena nailed this dish.

I ordered a chicken marsala.  Now this dish is relatively easy to prepare.  Even bad marsala is still good marsala.   But excellent marsala leaves the chicken terribly juicy and tasty, and this dish didn't disappoint.  The men from the boys situation was --

-- the side dish.  Firstly, Siena allowed me to substitute my mashed potatoes for pesto gnocchi.  I had to pay two additional dollars but it still only came out to something like $18.  On the strip this same meal would have been $28 and no substitutions thank you.  Secondly, Gnocchi comes two ways:  frozen factory (garbage) or handmade on the premises (heaven).  It's super easy to tell the difference, and this gnocchi was homemade.  You won't make this dish right at home, and so Siena gives you the chance to visit Italian heaven.  Do it.  If you have two couples, order as an appetizer to split.  With a salad.

But testing this restaurant wasn't over yet.  My partner ordered ricotta cheesecake.  Another item that's usually not worth ordering these days.  For anyone who doesn't know this:  the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is lame and unacceptable.  Siena's cheesecake was not only the real McCoy, but had almondine and liqueur touches which closed the deal.

Siena is the best Italian food Restaurant I've had so far in Vegas.  It should replace the Onda in the Mirage.  It's not as classy and innovative as Olive's in Bellagio, but Siena simply serves better Italian food while not being too classic and boring... for a third of the price.  (You read that right.)  My favorite strip Italian (so far) is Rao's in Caesars, but Rao's has a hit or miss menu.  And they stopped serving real gnocchi a year or so ago to maximize profits.  Corporate, corporate, corporate.

(In my first draft of this review, I neglected to mention how solid the service was from Justin.  A week has passed since he served us and I still remember his name.  That doesn't happen often for me.)

But since I'm a born critic, I've got to say something bad about Siena.  Okay --

1.  The location blows unless you're a local.   I'm talking about the location being off strip, not the building itself.  But speaking of which --

2. -- the interior is nice (reminds me of a HOUSTONS), but the exterior is bland suburban stripmall tan stucco YUCCO.  The good news there is that the remainder of suburban Vegas is identically wretched and so they don't stand out in that way.  However --

3.  -- the restaurant's name and logo are too long and hard to remember.  THIS CAN KILL A PLACE.  How can you recommend something if you can't remember what it's called.  SIENA is nice and neat.  They should even consider SIENA ON SAHARA, which tells strip visitors WHERE it is and infers there will be more locations.  If you want advice on how to make the sign better, hire the guy who did FIREFLY next door.  Siena's exterior look and signage screamed 'local mistake' and yet the interior and food scream ""You'll be back.""

Give it a try, Yelpers.  And Siena owners -- open a second location as close to the strip as possible.  Inside a property if you can manage it.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,4,1,5,jkmF5hUiUn3J7MVIGsBVKw

Started off with the Formaggiere ($12.75): Carboncino, Pecorino Pepato, Fontina, and Fontinella cheeses. They were all pretty good, and the portions were fair since we had about 3-4 pieces of each.

Also tried the Gnocchi al Pesto ($13.75): Homemade Potato & Ricotta Dumpling in Pesto. This was pretty good! A little more starchy than I've had, but the pesto sauce was fantastic.  This was the highlight of meal for me.

Lasagna ($13.75): Meat Sauce, Ricotta, Parmesan, & Mozzarella Cheese. This was good overall, but the inside was a little cooler than the rest.  The hot parts weren't very mentionable either...I'd skip this one personally.  

Overall, I don't think you can go WRONG...it's just difficult when I compare it to my other favorites in Vegas.

We paid at the counter, and took our numbered placard to the outdoor seating area. Within 10 minutes, our food was whisked to our table by the waiter. One bite of my toasted, cheesey, melty, vegetarian sandwich and I was hooked. You could taste how fresh the ingredients were.

5199359,2010-07-04,5,DLJCwHGtbAV31UQ1lnIjlw,"I am an Asian addict. I rarely eat anything that does not come from that lovely continent. I mean it is the largest and most populated, so odds are they're going to have some winning cuisines--and they do. But, yesterday, I managed to take myself to Siena, an Italian restaurant.

The interior, while not trendsetting, is nice and clean. They are in the middle of a big remodel as they are adding a patio and some other features, like a deli, which I think will be nice as my understanding is they are going for a more caf√© feel for that section. Cafes are a welcome addition to my hood.

The service got the job done but without finesse or flair. Honestly, I think he decided we were not a valuable table when we started out by just ordering water. I was a server once, and I know when a table goes for the tap you start thinking they're cheapos, but, it's just not right. I noticed that he told another table the specials, but not us. We clearly weren't ""special"" material. He didn't refill our water glasses once. Still, the service was not terrible; it just wasn't remarkable.

As for the food, it was good, but not a good value. I was honestly a little excited to see a salad with apples on the menu. I am a sucker for fruit and greens, but when the salad arrived, it had 4 thin slices on the corner of the plate. That is really more of a garnish and perhaps not worthy of a line item mention on a menu. If they upped the apple quotient, I think this could be a really craveable salad, as the cheese, walnuts and vinaigrette were done well. We also ordered the Healthy Choice pasta: organic & whole-wheat angel hair roasted tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and fresh basil. I loved the bountiful, fresh slices of garlic. If I had made this dish at home, I'd be giving myself a big hug. However, I paid $14.75 for it, and the portion was a little small. I am not ready to dole out hugs for that. 

To end on a positive note: The breadbasket and olive tapenade were delicious. The bread came out hot and fresh, and it has become quite a challenge to find a hot breadbasket in this town. Those loafs alone are earning Siena 3 stars, but I probably won't return until the caf√© is finished. In the meantime, catch me in Chinatown.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,4,3,h8KmTinQttEGpXxiiMTjvQ

I almost feel I should leave this review in two parts.....one for a take-out experience and one later for a dine-in.

Today is the Take-Out.

So, on the suggestion of the Awesome Princess Crystal Dawn.....the conversation went kinda like this :
Damon : I'm hungry.
Crystal : Well, I have a cure for that?
Damon : Oh really?
Crystal : Yes, really, Siena.
Damon :  Who's that?
Crystal :  It's an AWESOME Italian Deli.

....and history was made.  I clocked out for my lunch break eager to feed on something from anywhere new.   Walking into Siena is like walking into charm.  You are automatically surrounded by deli that could easily be a movie set.  I took a number.  Ordered the days special Fettuccine and Red Sauce with Chicken and Eggplant.   Oh, and  3 canolli.  The wait was a little long, but who cares, there was just so much to take in.  The hanging sausage, the cheeses, the baked goods tempting me at the front case.   Anything and everything you could possibly want and thought you could only find in NYC.

I walk out the door lunch in hand.   As I'm driving back to work I realize I can't wait to partake of one of the canolli.   Now my roommate constantly touts the beauty of the canollli, but let me tell you, I've had a few,Vegas canolli aren't a beauty....at least until now.  All 3 found their way into my mouth before I parked my car.  Ummmm...WOW.  Why eat anything else EVER!!!  Why move on to the (what felt like 5lbs. of pasta) Fettuccine I had actually intended to be my lunch.   But I did it, and it was worth it. ( I can't believe I ate the WHOLE thing. )  Now my friends, I need a nap. Next time I'll stay and take more time.  Try that beautiful Sicilian pizza they had.

After the bread service with olives, we got 4 different cheeses (Fontina, Fontinella, Locatelli and Pecorino), gnocchi al pesto and lasagna. I wanted carboncino but they were out. We ordered the Pecorino with truffles but was given pecorino pepato instead. I knew there was nothing that tasted like truffles on that cheese plate we got.

Gnocchi al Pesto:
I love gnocchi and pesto so it was an easy decision to get this. Huge serving and lots of sauce. We were using bread to get rid of the excess pesto. The gnocchi was tasty and soft and the sauce was quite good. I don't know of any other places in Vegas that has gnocchi in pesto. 4/5

Lasagna:
Their version brings back great childhood memories when we'd go to this small restaurant that serves good lasagna after going to a funeral or the airport. Tasty. The outside was hot but the middle wasn't. 3.5/5

More about that later.  2 of us ordered chix parm over angel hair pasta.  Very good. The birthday girl ordered the recommended salmon, grilled over spinach. Great.  I ordered a pizza, good and a small caesar salad.  All and all the food was very good. The service was excellent.  Now let me finish my cake story.  Our waiter served the cake and we all sang, we had a very nice time, that is until the waiter brought us yne bill.  He said that there was a service charge for the cake service.  Not a problem I thought until I noticed the amount.  $20.00 service charge.  $10.00 would have been fine but $20.00 is excessive, no rediculous.  When I asked the manager she seemed puzzled, she said she would check with the manager and just went about her business.  Not a great way to run a business, what due think?

From the varieties of formaggio (cheese) Olives from different regions of Italy oh not to mention the Italian gelato and pastries. I can go on and on. You must see for yourself. Gina then proceeded to sit us at the bar area for Happy hour and let me tell you this is not just a happy hr. It was a feast!! The best Italian feast. Gian Carlo the owner was so gracious to proudly serve us 2 great pasta dishes that were out of this world. Along with the fried calamari which was so tender. The lamb chops were sensational every bite was heaven. The variety of cheeses along with figs and fig jam. They do great meat and cheese boards. Great musical entertainment after 830 in bar area. Get there at around seven to enjoy the great experience. Gian Carlo and Gina are great hosts and you will never experience this gastronomic adventure if you Dont get there and try it for yourself.

The 4 of us ordered from the lunch specials and received the complimentary bread and olive tapenade. The server was very friendly and super attentive, yet again we were the only ones there for the first 30 minutes. I ordered the ciabatta steak sandwich lunch special which came with fried fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were quite tasty, a mix of purple, red, golden and sweet potatoes. The sandwich however, left a lot to be desired. The description was a thinly sliced steak sandwich. What I received was a skirt steak with absolutely no flavor and way too thick to just take a bite of. My first bite extracted the whole slice of meat from the bread so I resorted to cutting the steak piece by piece and eating the bread separately. I wouldn't have minded having to do this if the sandwich had more flavor but it was just blah and boring. The sandwich itself was very large and I was only able to finish one half of it. My friends had the cold cut sandwich, the vegetarian sandwich and the pear salad. They all enjoyed their dishes without complaint. For dessert we all ordered the gelato. It redeemed the meal for me! I had the spumoni flavor and it was creamy and fresh. If I ever return I would definitely order one of the pasta dishes next time.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,4,3,3,A8kWQVgT2Yk94ge0jENKHw

We have passed by many times, but never really noticed this place.  So walking in, we were surprised by the deli.  The display cases full of sweets and other treats including wonderful sausages and fresh made pastas. 

They also serve cooked items, for a take home meal.  And of course there are loaded shelves with various grocery items.  After a lingering walk through, we made into an almost empty restaurant.  I think we may have been the second table.  It was early evening but I was still a bit concern with no dinner crowd.

Our server came right away and we made a couple of appetizer selections.  I tried the polenta sauteed porcini.  Loaded with mushrooms and assorted seafood on top of grilled polenta.   It was very savory good. They had just cooked off some homemade sausages and brought us a ""wheel"" gratis.  I love sausage, so this was a wonderful addition to the meal.

For my entree I got the ""zuppa reale"" which is a bouillabaisse with seafood, in fish broth and chopped tomatoes.   It was a bit spicy and very good especially with the assortment of breads to soak up the broth.  

The server and the assistants were quick on service, kept our tea glasses full and promptly removed our empty plates.  We admit that it was really good meal, and we do want to return soon.  

One of the menu items that might entice us to come again, is the high protein meal, called Misto Carne Alla Griglia, marinated grilled homemade sausages, pork ribs, chicken and steak.  When we are low ""carbing"", this would make a great meal!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,0,5,hUFJpDGG2CbasiOXEgA6Ow

I always get the Sicilian Sandwich and it's on the mark, I can't understand how this simple sandwich is so good but I could never get my sandwiches to taste that good. The bread is fresh and the meat well is from the deli so its awesome.
   My only complaint would be not having a soda fountain in the deli/lunch area but they do have bottled soda and water
   I'm a huge cannoli fan so when I can get one to try I do, they have three sizes sm. med, large so went for the Med not knowing the size difference. I should have went for the large cause the med seemed small. They have a lot of deserts to try and I look forward to trying more.

I usually order a chopped salad to start. Get the smaller size or share the larger size because there is plenty. The meats and cheese they use in the salad come from their own deli next door. The salad is always fresh and tasty. A creature of habit, I usually order the linguini vongole for my entree. And it never disappoints. Lots of clams still in the shell and the linguini is excellent. My wife has tried a wider variety of things on the menu: rissoto, sausage and peppers, lasagna, and spaghetti bolognese. She has been pleased with all.

We started with what they call their ""buongustaio"". It's essentially a meat tray with a few small chunks of cheese, several olives (like 4 or 5) and a small dollop of roasted red peppers. I admit to enjoying the dish more than my wife did but I love prosciutto and theirs was well sliced (critical) and very tasty. It's a lot for two people to eat as an appetizer so we saved half to take home. For dinner my wife had a chicken Caesar salad which she really liked. She enjoyed the taste and the portion size (adequate but not huge). I had lasagna (being 100% Italian and all) and really enjoyed it. The portion size was good, the sauce delicious and the consistency just right. Sometimes lasagna can fall apart or be like it's made in a mold but not the lasagna served at Siena Trattoria. It was great. The service was excellent throughout. I'm sure we won't be waiting this long again between visits.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,0,4,EKKl4ztA-gBlC0aH4kYZig

Very good sauces with the stuffed ravioli.  Excellent customer service and very friendly owner.",1kbHR5IroDiZD0npir8OLw,0,0,5,ywCAz2ZLPp6VuMjKI4Q-lw

Calamari was tender But I wish the batter was lighter and the marinara that it came with was no so heavy with tomatoes. Gnocchi was a disaster, it was soo mushy... I could only eat 1/3 of it. I'm not a person who sends back stuff. I decided not to finish it, just won't be back for another helping.",I0bI_DAQ4h-9WPrVWdwolg,0,0,1,SJ3-7wQGRoYsMJj02kUEmg

Loved the decor and the cute deli/market next door.  There were 6 of us and we were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  We started off with calamari and bread and tapanade.  I was told the bread is baked fresh daily onsite and I was not disappointed.  The tapandade was muah muah good.  I could not get enough of both!  I thought to myself if the bread and tapandade were that good enough to make me do my happy dance in my seat then the food must be amazing.  I was not disappointed!  Everything we ordered was delicious.  Especially the housemade sausage that came with Hubby's meal.

The staff was all very attentive and we never had to ask for anything.  Water and drinks were always filled.  Even the owners came by to ask how we were doing.  This place is a class act.  Highly recommended!",Mn_j5WAE6hLDuiVq4EWoZg,1,0,5,wsRSTCZc4PdJ9jlTJHK87Q

If that is how a dissatisfied customer is handled, id hate to see how your kitchen works. MARC T: 20 min late doesnt justify ICE COLD PIZZA. I ordered on NYE and picked up at 530..NO ONE was in your establishment. Figured you would get that NYE is a LATE NIGHT event and people dont show up till later. You might want to work on not only your customer service skills, but your maturity. I chose Siena because i had eaten there before and enjoyed it. Telling me ""next time go get Chinese food"" is insulting and extremely unprofessional and im curious as to how your bosses will react when notified...",Dff_MlN-_VZjm-AP_oFWhQ,5,0,1,b1hi1o1auWud0Yd5_4VJHA
