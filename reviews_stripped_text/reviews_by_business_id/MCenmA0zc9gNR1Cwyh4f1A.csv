I feel like the salad bar is the same bland salad bar everytime. I liked the  chunks of chicken breast that was set aside for salads, we should always have that. Maybe cubed ham or turkey as well. I was thinking bacon strips during lunch for BLTs would be cool too. Also fillings to make yummy lettuce wraps with butter leaf lettuce or romaine. 
Thank you!",utFxE4b_kN_AIoFrUs-BAg,1,1,3,k4-00K4DpTXgzv2XYX1uwA

The food is flavorless unless you like salt, and the soups are the same every day. I just prey it gets better.",0n7g-1irSV-uGDSa7lyZYg,4,0,1,W24X-o6puRb4LrbB13t-Jw

I like how there is money to pay a guard outside the EDR.!Maybe with all the money you save by no-one leaving with food you can improve the quality. I love that we're going green by getting rid of coffee cups. now we all have to lug around a cup. Will I get stopped by the guard to see whats in there? Will people be smuggling out food in their own cups? Who knows. I do know that I have brought my own lunch from home all this week and have been feeling so much better for it. If only there were more microwaves for all the other health concise people out there. I usually spend about half my break waiting line to heat up my food.
   One more point. I saw a big cockroach crawling by the booths we sit at. hanging out . I wonder where the rest are hiding.",3dvgSE8hZTYbc505aLUXQg,2,1,1,YrHEbPKadOwZDMZ5_PZzig

Fries and onion rings where soggy and cold. These are 2 items that should be under a heat lamp and not a steam table. Burger was pretty good today. Fresh off the grill would be awesome. Maybe in future the hot dogs could be grilled.

Chicken was like chewing on an old rubber boot.

Same food over and over 7 days of chicken. Only thing that changes is the sauce they put on top. Being friends with a member of the kitchen staff is the only way to get the left over sushi or some eggs made for you. The kitchen is way under staffed. We have a hot dog griller but never have hotdogs for it. Maybe one day we will have a real staff and real food.",P2ORM62qSQdLJQxgao-78w,2,0,2,QU1xP4YqkiEQw5TP2cOE-w
4325130,2018-03-16,0,MCenmA0zc9gNR1Cwyh4f1A,"Oh man where do I begin first off as it is stated in the Teamsters union contract employees shall be fed a meal similar in quality to what is fed to guests that is so far from the truth it is sad it is truly disgusting quality, pre-frozen premade in bags everything is just heated up and served I don't want to hear about being short staffed hire more employees otherwise the Teamsters union might have something to say about it and The Culinary Union, The other reviewer nailed it right on the head they only give out good meals during the EOS employee survey season . The food is so bad sometimes I would feel bad giving it to a dog or a homeless person on the street. Everything is sodium drenched and is so bad for you and you can only eat a salad every day before it gets so tiring.
There's only one microwave and you get a line so long sometimes it's not even worth waiting for when you're only allowed a certain amount of time for your lunch period. And on top of that you can't even walk out with an ice cream cone ( the only thing worth anything down there on most days )because they have a prison like elementary school style guard watching everyone because apparently we are all children. So sad this place is in need of dire help.",_28qCHeSkUr0FuVXtJj_Eg,3,0,1,cbnJ1LYi7BVLTm7i96mc5w
4379241,2017-10-14,0,MCenmA0zc9gNR1Cwyh4f1A,"I happen to eat 2 meals per day at the? EDR, 5 days a week, I really appreciate the efforts that are being made in regards to delivering the best quality possible to CP employees. However, the fact that the best selections are only being served around peak times (11am - 12:30pm) and only on weekdays is a bit of an unfair thing. People working in swing/graveyard shifts feel like they're eating leftovers. Breakfast options should change a bit, it's been the same redundant things since I joined the company about a year ago. Weekends' selections should be as important as weekdays and not only rely on the fact that if executive offices employees aren't there then you shouldn't serve good options. I'd also like to add that the majority of people aren't fans of the chicken recipe that's being served 3/4 days out of the week. The white fish tastes like nothing, and some people do not eat pork.
Thank you so much for taking your time in order to read this review.

Edit: Now that I understand the process a little bit better, I must admit that my review was a bit unfair towards your team's efforts. My apologies for that.",-IwYNeOsYRygXZfDgzOyew,0,1,3,P5G9eYq1rqCT-A7XykL_2Q

Personally I just snag a couple of raw broccoli bunches and assume that it cancels out the Mac n cheese and fries. Staff and chef are good folks and they'll try out your ideas if you pitch em on yelp. Also if you're a breakfast person, the omelettes are  and keep an eye out for sprinkle donuts in the pastry section.",pca1Ars1XigKiMNjjFTk0w,0,0,5,3-8osL6Asd3fu_bBNcq0Mg

Hot steamed vegetables without oil, sweet potatoes,  hummus, pico de galo, are all personal favorites. 

I would love to see brown rice, egg whites, Greek yogurt (unsweetened), and boneless baked chicken.",byIRMb6GwdSjeDHnrzgyWQ,1,2,4,0kIqjFqCSDKfy4e9voob4A
