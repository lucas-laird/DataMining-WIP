Only option is Omakase and it's pricey, but in our opinion well worth every dollar spent!

Service was excellent and the Chef explained everything (from where the fish came from, why he chose it and why he paired/plated it as he did) during our dining experience. However the Chef's explanations in no way took away from us being able to have an intimate dining experience.

Even without the food this place deserves 5 stars because Chef Eric educates you on the omakase, how it's prepared, where the fish is from, why to use your fingers to eat nigiri, and so much more. It was very educating and made the whole dinner an experience to remember. 
You must call ahead for reservations, he does not take reservations after 2pm that day since he has to prepare the meal.

It's a private setting where you end up chatting with the Chef about his craft, the type of fish, why this or that particular fish, how it tastes in the fall vs. spring vs. summer...etc. You immerse yourself in a  master class of sushi while enjoying sake and making friends.

It looked like your typical strip mall sushi BOGO restaurant.  My son, who was with me, laughed and said that I must have been suckered when I got my recommendation for the restaurant.  When I told the hostess that I was there for the Omakase, she showed us out of the restaurant to the store next door.  It was a very non-descript storefront.  When we entered, Chef Eric was waiting for us specifically and he really took us on a fantastic culinary journey.  Now remember, this shares a parking lot with a Chuck E. Cheese and a Denny's, so don't be surprised. I have had some amazing Omakase before, including at Sushi Nakazawa (whose owner/chef was the apprentice of Sushi Master Yiro Ono) in NYC.  Chef Eric's Omakase has certainly reached the heights of Sushi Nakazawa.  I don't typically write reviews, but when I saw some negative reviews, I felt the need to give my opinion.  I will definitely be going back when I am in Las Vegas.",bWZt2-O8NhoZLaDbsRYkYQ,0,0,5,ePda5HQfqYfpvTuIY7PqbA

791917,2016-09-16,2,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"I literally made this account just to leave this review. I've used Yelp before, but have never commented. This review is a bit late, but I think it's still worth mentioning. This happened February 2016.

I was looking around trying to find a place to have dinner for Valentine's Day. Given my girlfriend's love of fresh seafood, I wanted to give Kame a chance. There weren't too many reviews on Yelp then, but all of them were raving. Easy choice, right? They offered two times, either at 6pm or 8pm. I opted at 8pm since we had plans before dinner. A few weeks go by, and two days before the 14th, they call me and double check the reservation at 8PM. I thank them and say we'll definitely be there. Come the 14th, I called in the morning to triple check and they confirmed it yet again. So with three confirmations, I went a little beyond what was necessary to make sure we had seats, but I felt at ease. 

We showed up right at 8PM and walked into the AYCE side of the restaurant since we've never been there before, but they showed us to the other door to Kame. When we entered, we saw that every seat was taken. They had mentioned that there was an earlier seating at 6pm, so we figured it's not a big deal if those people are finishing up their meal. We let the server know that we had a reservation, but he looked a bit confused. He left to talk to the hostess and came back with the bad news: they had given our seats to a couple that walked in. On Valentine's Day. 

They apologized, something about the hostess not seeing the reservation list, and asked us to sit down at the tables by the entrance. I was upset, but I'm not the type to make or scene or yell. Those people also paid a lot of money to eat here, so it wouldn't be right to demand they give up their seats for us. We were told the people eating would finish within 15 minutes. They offered drinks and appetizers, but for the price tag $160, we didn't feel like getting full on the appetizers from the AYCE sushi side of the restaurant. We would have sat down on that side if we wanted that food. 8:30pm rolls by, and no one has left their seats. We ask when we will be seated, and the server says very shortly. It's now 9pm and we're still at the tables, still waiting, both of us starving and understandably upset at the situation. 

It was pretty clear that at this point, we weren't going to be seated anytime soon. At 9:10pm, all the seats still taken, we got up and headed for the door, incredibly disappointed. The server ran over to us and apologized profusely and asked us not to leave but we were hungry and tired of waiting. We left, drove across the city, and managed to get a table to SoHo by 10:30pm, somewhat salvaging our Valentine's date. About half hour into that meal, I got a call from the server from Kame, apologizing again. He had talked to the chef and they wanted to offer us 50% off if we came back another day. I told him I would let him know, but I never made that call. 

It was incredibly gracious for them to offer that discount, but both of us were just over wanting to eat there, rightfully so. As other reviews have said, the food is incredibly and it's probably one of the best, if not the best, omakase you can find in Vegas. It's a shame that after so much effort, 3 phone calls, a long drive and even longer wait, we never got a chance to find out ourselves. I wouldn't want this review to scare anyone away from trying Kame. In fact, I still recommend it. But my experience wasn't exactly what the previous reviews hyped it up to be. Hopefully yours can.",mFX7Dv2xwCrBmiT7bXuFKA,7,1,1,04XbO6-Am82XqgFBErWrag

I probably shouldn't have mentioned my allergies to you since it was minor but I was able to try everything from the Omakase side that my mom had. Again the service was great along with the attention to detail. 

The reason for the the two star reviews is because it was just an ok meal to me for a high price. When I first spoke to you I mentioned I do not mind paying for quality. I've been to great cheap sushi places to extremely expensive ones like Jiro. But again for me the value wasn't there, more so my meal since you created sashimi dishes for the same price which I said you didn't have to when we arrived.

I am in the minority here so maybe not receiving the full meal the way it was supposed to be served affected my review. Maybe one day Ill be back to fully experience this.",H1fcbC-WKsbiEo8BBVkHwA,3,2,2,Ef0jDcAQD4EmeA312ZCU_Q

Kame Omakase was the most amazing omakase tasting experience I have ever had! It was initially a 21-course omakase that turned into 24-course with complimentary beer! 

It took around 3 hours to deeply savor the experience. It was immersive and multi-sensory! Chef Eric explained each dish, the ingredients and the locations where they were sourced from around the world. The dishes were diverse and international (Alaska, Australia, Chile, Maine, Japan and other places). 

The dishes were high-quality, superb and topnotch! Chef Eric hand-picked the ingredients based on what were in season, fresh and even live. He ensured that very high quality standards were met. I can sense his Jiro-like passion throughout the dining experience!

Aside from the high quality taste, I was impressed by the presentation of each dish. It was prepared and handcrafted thoughtfully to provide the ultimate omakase experience: heavenly, immersive and zenful!

1264272,2016-09-23,8,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"Unless you're super rich, eating at Kame Omakase is a bucket list item. The price of dinner was more than my car payment, but it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that is definitely worth it.

My husband and I were celebrating our 20th anniversary, so we took the plunge. Because the date fell midweek and we took the early seating (6 p.m.), we were lucky enough to be the only diners in the restaurant. This was a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. Chef Eric explained each dish as he prepared it, and we certainly felt special getting such personal service. 

The meal started with seven small dishes, followed by a sushi course (13 pieces, each personally prepared and explained), then five more dishes and a serving of mochi for dessert. Surprisingly, the only things I didn't like were the baby abalone (too chewy) and the Wagyu beef (too fatty for my taste), which were two of the items that most intrigued me. But everything else was fantastic! My favorites were the monkfish liver (""foie gras of the sea""), the raw scallops (love the flying fish roe and that hint of yuzu), the Hawaiian sea perch, and the Scottish sea trout. My husband loved the Spanish bluefin tuna; the goldeneye snapper; and the hairy crab innards, which tasted like a richer version of a regular crab's tamale.

We split a bottle of Riesling, which was reasonably priced at $35. And our attentive waitress kept our water glasses filled throughout the meal, which was important so we could cleanse our palates between plates.

Twenty-six dishes is a lot to handle, and we started petering out toward the end of the two-hour event. But we refused to let this meal go to waste, so there is a Styrofoam box in our fridge with a pricey crab claw and two pieces of mochi inside!

This is not a meal for the faint of heart (or light of wallet), but if you're an adventurous diner in search of something special, Kame Omakase is worth every penny.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,11,5,5,TM50NB9oOEC9_BcYYMlYmA

Omakase means ""I'll leave it up to you"". It's up to Chef Eric to provide the best and freshest fish selections, and he had consistently done so without fail. This experience was no different. I was amazed that not one of his provided dishes was duplicated from last year. It was like a brand new art gallery, every new dish filled us with amazement and wonder. Chef Eric does an amazing job at explaining what things are, where they're from, processes to both catch and serve the seafood, and would do well in reminding us in what order to eat our meal (usually right to left) for maximum flavor effect.

For many people out there, a $160+ per person meal sounds crazy. But understand that it's a 2-3 hour experience. It's a show, both educational and entertaining.

My mom already made reservations to come back. You make a reservation ahead of time, Chef Eric okays it, then you pick your price range from 120 to 150 I believe. I went all out because I don't like to feel like I missed anything. Your entire meal is carefully planned by Eric the moment he knows you're coming. 

The place is next to Yummy Sushi (currently there is no sign). And you get seated at the sushi bar where you can watch the action/drool at what's coming. I normally hate sitting at the sushi bar because of my social awkwardness but listening to Eric share his knowledge about fish and everything down to sensory tasting of foods made it very easy and a great experience. Literally, everything was WOW good. There's so much detail behind everything that is put in front of you. And another cool thing about this menu is that you won't leave hungry either.

First off I would like to thank Eric for properly handling the initial issue we had with reservations. 

As for the Omakase, I will have to say it is DEFINITELY by far the best I have had in the entire United States. I have had the best chefs omakase from Bev. Hills to NYC. Of course they were all great! However, the food here at Kame supersedes everyone I've had. 

Each course is very well thought out and planned. Very unique and one of a kind. Eric the chef is amazing! He explains each dish and creation, why he did it and what is unique about it. 

Please refer to the photos and this is a MUST visit when you are traveling to Vegas. 

For the tourists it's about a $25 Uber ride, however his omakase price per person at $160 is way more reasonable and better than even Nobu. Take my word for it, Nobu is great but none of the dishes there on their omakase compares to Kame.",yDNag0iudD6xYnKFFUuuKA,3,1,5,GT43KAM0FVUdRgKMPw1Ehw

From start to finish, I loved everything. Chef Eric must knew we loved uni because he topped and combined it on so many courses. It was like I was in uni heaven! There are so many courses so just peep the photos.

For every course of the meal, the chef explains where each fish or each cut is from.

2496953,2016-09-15,10,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"""I am easily satisfied with the very best""
- Winston Churchill 

Since it opened late last year, Kame has been my favorite spot for Omakase in Las Vegas. There are a few other really quality omakase spots in Vegas, but IMHO Kame is the best. While the setting at Kame is not as sophisticated as some of the other choices, even leaving a little to be desired, the food shines through--consistently surpassing expectations.

What sets Kame Omakase apart is their use of live items and the vast variety of exceptional, high quality ingredients. In regards to the later, there aren't many places in town where you may have the occasion to taste 3 different types of uni...there are even fewer that might offer it in a nigiri course, and use uni as an ingredient to harmoniously compliment and elevate a few other courses...perhaps even highlighting a live uni option again in another dish. Chef Eric prides himself in the live items he offers. On my most recent visit we were treated to at least 8 different live items, including Lobster, oyster, softshell crab, scallop, baby abalone, and ama ebi. On other visits some live items I've experienced have included uni, sea snail, conch, sea cucumber, octopus, clam, and multiple varieties of live crab and live lobster. Chef Eric doesn't merely provide his guests with high quality items; he combines flavors, textures and plating to create some extraordinary dishes...literally a few items were some of the most beautiful bites I've experienced this year.
 
Kame currently offers two seating's, 6pm & 8:30pm, and one Omakase option: $165. Each experience is similar, but the menu always changes. Chef explained that he changes the menu based on more than what is available, always seeking out the freshest and best items he can get, he only get items that he believes will be truly special. I encourage you to ask questions while seated at the intimate bar as Chef is helpful to educate and passionately speaks about the products and techniques he uses. 

Keeping with the true omakase experience, I've had as few as 10 courses and as many as 16, depending on the portion size and price of the ingredients used, but regardless I've always been satisfied in many different ways. On my most recent visit we had the opportunity to experience the following:

* Kumamoto oyster with Kobe beef & Shaguku oyster with uni and caviar
* Live softshell crab with bonito and ponzu sauce
* Alaskan king crab with ponzu and house made ankimo (monkfish) Liver
* Grilled Chillian seabass with king oyster mushroom
* Live lobster sashimi with uni, sesame oil, black truffle salt, gold flake, caviar, and mountain peach
* Spanish Bluefin tuna / ama ebi / baby abolony with tobiko / and yuzu miso aoyagi  (Japanese maple) / 3 year fermented soy sauce
* Lobster head kaminabe miso soup with fried shrimp head and manila clam
* Live scallop with fatty tuna
* Nigiri course consisting of Amberjack with uni and Ocean trout roe / Japanese Snapper / Kanpachi (Amberjack) / Giant clam / New Zealand king salmon / Spanish mackerel  / Sayori (Needle Fish) from Hokkaido
* Sashimi course consisting of Fatty tuna cheek with fresh wasabi / Tuna toro with black truffle sea salt and uni
* Australian wagyu ribeye sautéed on hot stone with julienned vegetables 
* Brown rice seaweed salad with fatty tuna, uni, and sea trout roe
* Japanese Wagyu miyazaki with black truffle sea salt
* Dessert

Kame Omakase is not for every fan of ""sushi."" There is always a great nigiri course in their omakases, but if you mostly want nigiri omakase you would be better served at other spots in town...or you could go next door to Yummy Grill. Kame is also a little exploratory for many people's taste on a few dishes...fans of sushi rolls may want to take baby steps before delving into an omakase tasting of this kind. And while a few items could be seen as rather adventurous, my love and I recently dined at Kame Omakase with  two friends that didn't enjoy a couple of the more unique textures and flavors that live seafood items can offer, yet they still loved it immensely because of how wonderfully pleasing and enjoyable the other items were. Simply put, If you would enjoy Kame Omakase, I doubt that there is anything in Vegas remotely similar that you would like more.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,20,16,5,bP1Zz0inUHvYp66yv-dKMw

My boyfriend and I have dined here 4 times now within the last 6 months.. and we don't even live in Vegas! I feel like I've totally been buying plane tickets from Hawai'i to Vegas just to eat here.. sounds crazy but this is the best dining experience I've EVER had. And if you take the $165 leap, you'll understand why! 

First things first, make reservations and don't be alarmed when they take your CC info. This omakase-style restaurant seats only 8 people at a time, so their seats are valuable! 

Chef Eric goes ABOVE AND BEYOND so that your meal is not just a meal, but a euphoric and magical experience (me sounding like a fatass) Anyway, each time we've went the dishes were similar BUT everything is seasonal, he orders and serves nigiri sushi based on what is freshest of the season! How amazing is he?? He has so much pride and is still so humble; he puts forth so much effort into his work, and it really shines through. I am not a huge fish lover, but EVERY SINGLE piece here melts in your mouth! I've not once had a fishy tasting piece of nigiri or even a small plate/ appetizer that I've been dissatisfied with. 

$165 May sound like a lot of money pp, BUT let me tell you-- I am from Hawai'i (where we have good Japanese ethnic food and sushi) and have paid $250 pp for omakase that honestly tastes like garbage next to kame. Sorry.. not sorry!! There is no comparison. This is a reasonably priced, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING food experience you will never forget. If you're a gambler think of it this way, win some money and it's on the house right?? 

From the freshly grated wasabi to the fatty otoro tuna and the sizzling wagyu ooh and the lobster uni pasta (oh my god my mouth is salivating) this is the best meal I've had in my life. Kame is a must when in Vegas. Thank you Eric-san for implementing your ideas and passion into this restaurant, you've changed my dining experience life for good!

We will see you soon!

Chef Eric indulged us in a way only he seems to know...the best.

It's long but can't omit these delicious list of the night, so here you go:
- Kumanoto Oyster with Toro & Fanny Bay with Uni & Truffle
- Chilean Sea Bass with Oyster Mushroom
- Jelly Fish Sashimi with Blue Carb Yuzu rice puff & flying fish egg
- Live Octopus with Yuzu miso sauce, dried miso flake with river salt
- Hairy Crab, Baby Abalone, dried mullet egg & young peach
- Lobster Sashimi with gold flake, fatty tuna osetra caviar, ocean trout egg, mountain peach, shiso leaf with San Diego Uni
- Organic Iberico Acorn Fed pork
- Otoro Spanish Tuna
- Kamashita Toro
- Manila Clam Shimigi mushroom with Lobster skin ball
- Toro trio
- Blue fin tuna
- Cockle clam
- Giant Clam
- Hirame from Jeju Island
- Japanese Snapper
- Amber Jack
- Golden Eye Snapper
- Scottish Ocean Trout
- Hawaii Big Eye Tuna
- Blue Fin Tuna back loin
- Wild Spanish Mackerel
- Mantize Lobster

- Anago with sea salt and sesame
- Kama toro
- Uni Duo of Live San Diego Sea Urchin & Hokaido Uni with quail egg over brown rice risotto of crab tomalley
- Lobster head with sea urchin blanc butter sauce
- Macha and Kinakok Sochi

The most esquisite Omakase I had in 2016...not because the number of dishes we were offered, but the quality ingredients, components, and character of dishes...vibrant and exciting in such an artful form.  Chef Eric took his time to prepare some dishes, ever present in the moment of the evening, but equally mindful of us anxious Omakase lovers who await one bite after another...and let me tell you, he didn't skip a beat...artfully bringing forth the delicate conceptions of his mind for us to enjoy.

Often I don't know who's sitting next to me but I know for sure we've got something to talk about in common...food...pure, yet complex food by Chef Eric...I have no doubt that I will have other experiences at Kame throughout the year, but for sure we'll make a point to make a reservation at the end of 2017.

All of the reviews echo the same regards - Kame and Chef Eric deliver a sensational omakase experience.

Many parts are traditional but many parts are not because the dining draws from Eric's inspirations through his journey traveling to Japan and all over the country to craft the best omakase to his guests.

If you are not a fan of live seafood do not come here.   If you do not like hearing details of your food you will not be a fan.  To me it's Sushi/Japanese cuisine porn to my ears-  keep it coming (sp)!!  Literally.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,4,4,5,h9JqRzI4bxQ8GELCAZy3mg

Bottomline, this place was great.  

This place is for the more experienced and at the risk of sounding slightly snobbish, dare I say serious sushi foodie.  You won't find any mayonnaise sauce drenched spicy crunchy roll conconctions here.

The place has no signage of it's own and was difficult to find if not for it's sister restaurant immediately next door that says Yummy Sushi.  This is the walk in place where you can find your usual spicy tuna rolls and such.  

They served 17 courses plus dessert and the entire service is about 2 to 2.5hrs so plan accordingly.  

The chef was interactive and was very knowledgeable with regards to the food served.  This added a lot to the experience and made it enjoyable.  

The line up was thoughtfully put together as well as each dish.  I appreciate the attention to detail given.
Everything was delicious.

My favorites were the lobster dishes and the Jeju Island Hirame.  

This definitely tanks among my favorite places I've ever eaten at.

3199504,2015-12-14,11,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"MIND & TUMMY BLOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Right when I thought I had tried the BEST omakase.... I was proven WRONG... we visited back to YUMMY GRILL & SUSHI one late night & noticed there was a whole in the wall that wasn't there before... we thought maybe they expanded... but how would the guest get in when there is a kitchen in the way... ERIC the owner popped out & we asked & he walked us across to take a view! The OMAKASE SIDE!! 

*THEY ONLY TAKE RESERVATIONS* 
the Chef truly wants to focus on the guests... therefore he hasn't advertised but is going into solely relying on WORD of Mouth... I don't think this will be a problem at all... his VISION for the place is to be DIFFERENT from all your typical omakase... also being a KOREAN CHEF he is also trying to strive beyond the label of only being able to get the best from traditional Japanese chefs. 

This is the FIRST OMAKASE place that I have been to that serves LIVE items... living ocean creatures! No FARMED stuff.

AMAZEBALLS & you leave freaken FULL as HELL!! words couldn't describe the joy I felt. But people... be forwarned... do NOT be on a time limit. This OMAKASE is the SHOW so this can be an all inclusive date night stuff *hint* gentlemen... for right now there will be a lot of trials until things are set but the MINIMUM price is $120 / person... but well worth it. 

Here goes...
MONK FISH LIVER CUCUMBER SALAD - I will have to say this was probably my least favorite out of everything but still good. My dad LOVEs this stuff but I just haven't learned a palate for such a thing.

3 DIFFERENT OYSTERS - small to large Shigoku.Kumamoto.Fanny Bay w/ uni all very delicious but Fanny Bay was probably my favorite cuz of the uni

GRILLED KING OYSTERS SHROOMS  - thin slices of mushrooms w/ nori slices & dried fish strips (forgot what it's called)

CHILEAN SEA BASS - when people say CHILEAN SEA BASS I know what it tastes like & literally DETEST it when I end up eating just sea bass... but this was the REAL deal... 1 point I may suggest is to cook to a MEDIUM temperature as it was a little dry... but still good

LIVE LOBSTER SASHIMI - live lobster tail w/ goldens balls all over

COOKED LOBSTER CLAW MEAT - served in a butter beurre blanc sauce so YUMMY! 

LIVE JAPANESE SEA CONCH - the cruncy chewy goodness!! Ahhhhh dip in some sea salt & seasame oil absolutely amazeballs! 

LIVE SCALLOP SASHIMI - so fresh & love the center part that you would only experience w/ the whole live thing.

LIVE HAIRY CRAB - they take the body meat & mix it w/ rice to make an amazing combination to eat w/ the TENDER leg meat that you dip in butter.

TORRO TATARE - ummmm this thing just MELTS in yo mouth. Served w/ some kind of root which I forgot the name & flying fish eggs.

SASHIMI PLATE - left to right Medai.Thready Fin Snapper.Orange clam.Grunt & Ikura.Itoyori Snapper w/ Truffle Oil. Truffle oil w/ sashimi... who does that!?!?!

UNI & IKURA - served w/ rice & flying fish egg.

OCEAN TROUT SUSHI  - looks like a dark colored salmon & I HATE salmon... but tastes NOTHING like the fishy creature! Its surprising & confusing

JO-TORRO SUSHI - yea... didn't even know I swallowed or ate it cuz it just melted away... like butter...

SEARED WAGYU BEEF SUSHI - .....WOW..... slightly seared & you don't even need to chew... just melts away w/ minimal effort. From Australia.

ANAGO SUSHI - sea water eel... ummm... typically don't like this... & was a bit disappointed when I found out it was the last item... but boi did he just slap me in the face & finished off proving me WRONG! It just MELTS & so juicy w/ a hint of sweetness like dessert. 

Of course we also finished off w/ some green tea ice cream but I do hope that they create an AMAZING beautiful dessert to compliment everything soon.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,18,10,5,9sG6EbyugYdTOEJiEgUfZQ

3517704,2017-07-04,4,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"Chef Eric is doing some special stuff in this small space adjacent to his a la carte sushi restaurant Yummy Grill. There are 8 spots at the omakase counter so if you want to experience it you better plan ahead and get reservations. I dined with friends and once seated we were treated to over a dozen courses of creative dishes made from impeccable seasonal ingredients over the course of 3 hours. 

Unlike places like Kabuto where the atmosphere has an almost sacred feel to it where silence is preferred, Kame is more lively with Chef Eric and his sous engaging with our party and genuinely having fun as they prepared our meal. Also, unlike the more traditional Kabuto fare, the dishes at Kame are creative and modern where multiple ingredients are used for each dish to create unbelievable flavor profiles, like Maine lobster combined with uni, caviar, black truffle sea salt, toro, and yamamoto berry. Eaten individually or together, each bite was pure bliss.

Other standout dishes included king crab with torched uni butter; live uni over brown rice and hairy crab; and lobster claw with uni butter. The more minimal preparations -- the sushi -- were stellar, too. Each delicately crafted and formed or brushed with soy sauce to maximize the umami factor of each.

They may not get the press that top-tier dining destinations do, but the experience here is one of the best in the city.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,11,11,5,yR5Thq5SRI44fjTg7I4pCg
3542021,2016-05-29,3,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"Hubby asked where I would like to have dinner before I go back to work since my maternity leave is coming to an end.  Without hesitation, I said, ""Kame.""  There are 2 seating, one at 6 and one at 8pm, M-Th.  We chose the 8pm on Thursday.

Chef Eric and team created over 20 different items for us to enjoy and EVERY SINGLE ITEM was of the freshest quality, flavorful, and we could truly taste the essence of the item.  There are other omakase places out there where you are given many items, but not all are great.  You may like a few items that were offered.  Nopee, not here at Kame.  Every single item was unique and delicious.  

There were items that I have tasted before (i.e., raw lobster with uni, truffle caviar and gold flakes, lobster miso soup, hairy crab rice with uni, roe, fatty tuna, melt in your mouth fatty tuna, three different types and style of oysters, scallop sashimi, etc), others that I have not tasted before (i.e., black throat sea perch nigiri, mullet fish roe, and more items that I can't remember the name of), right down to the unique and edible garnishments (mountain peach, cherry blossoms, fresh seaweed, fresh pickled ginger).  We finished the epic omakase with a scoop of delicious hojicha ice cream.

We learned a lot during this omakase, from Chef Eric.  Differences between the Santa Barbara and Japan uni, etc.  Chef Eric only gets shipment of the fish from the region that produces the best tasting of its kind, and will not settle for anything less than premium quality.  Quite honestly, though our omakase was $160pp (there is also the $120pp), the quality and quantity of our meal is worth way more than that price.  

Like the Joel Robuchon of the French cuisine, Jose Andres of the Spain cuisine, Chef Eric is the ONE representing Japanese cuisine.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, passionate, he is one of a kind.  His omakase is the ultimate omakase, and we will always return.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,4,5,5,EqdnF1PmeiJHJS-lBRaFKA
3600374,2016-01-02,15,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"I've Omakase'd about 95% of the time I have sat in front of Chef Eric and each visit was just as great as the last one. He is definitely in his element with his newest venture, KAME. It's been a longtime coming, and your chance is finally here!

Located literally next door to Yummy Grill on W Lake Mead, the only way to gain access through these doors is BY RESERVATION ONLY,(two seating times, 6pm and 8pm) and do it well in advance...the dining room area seems to fit about 20 people, but prime seating is up at the bar IMHO, and to the four furthest seats on the left where you can be up close and personal with Eric as he creates culinary works of art using the best fish and live seafood possible receiving top quality ingredients as much as three times a week.
He has the same purveyors as the two highly touted edomae sushi spots in Chinatown and won't settle for less than exceptional. On our visit, he mentioned that he had sent back a shipment of the highly prized Akamutsu (Black Throat Sea Perch) because he felt that the quality was not good enough to serve his guests. 

KAME's omakase experience starts at $120 per person, and is worth every penny. If you're serious about your sushi or enjoy great food while getting educated along the way, this should be on your ""to do"" list. Not only is the interaction between Eric and his guests very  contagious, but you leave very full , somewhat knowledgeable on things like the sake varieties served in the restaurant, the origin and  place of a certain fish that you had in one of your tasting, and even how he prepared it. For Eric, he wants to ensure that you leave here already wanting to come back and isn't your typical ""turn and burn"" sushi chef.
He has done his research extensively throughout Japan  , also having dined at sports like Urusawa and Jiro, taking the positive aspects of his dining experiences, and adding his own creative spin on the omakase experience.

Know Before You Go:

Make reservations well in advance... be sure to have a date and time confirmed 

The smaller your party is, the better your experience with Eric will be 

Be sure to indicate any dietary restrictions /food allergies when planning to dine here 

Courses will be created at Eric's discretion using the best ingredients and live seafood he has at the moment. ..Some courses may be similar to what other diners have had,  and some may be entirely different
(See photos-no diner has had the same exact thing )

3877288,2018-03-07,16,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"Kame Omakase is quite possibly the best kept secret outside of Japan. I was shocked at how good the quality was and how close the tastes and flavors were to that of the food we had at Tsukiji market. The small chef's table bar is unassuming and next door to the more casual Yummy Grill & Sushi. At $165, it's pricey, but on par with a fancy dinner that you might find on The Strip. 

The menu changes based on what is available from the market, but we were lucky to try some delicious rarities. Dinner started off with a small appetizer sampler of a kumamoto oyster topped with uni and caviar, fried ice fish, torched sea bass with pickled Japanese beets, followed by Japanese egg custard topped with foie gras. I was already mesmerized and to think that was only the first course! Everything was balanced, delicious, and so much restraint when it came to different flavors. After that, everything was a blur, but I actually took dinner notes:

Second course: hairy crab (sashimi and cooked) with pickled Japanese squash with a side of miso butter. THAT miso butter is to die for.

Third course: The famous signature Maine lobster sashimi topped with uni, gold-flaked tapioca, roe, toro, Sevruga caviar, finished with fresh wasabi, kelp as a palate cleanser, fresh abalone, finished with mountain peach. This dish more or less stays consistent, and talk about extravagance of the lobster topped with even more luxuriousness. 

Fourth course: Clam miso soup with lobster dumpling. A nice interlude before the barrage of nigiri.

Fifth course (13 pieces of delicious nigiri):
a) Halibut with ponzu and lime juice
b) Baby yellowtail
c) Winter yellowtail (fattier version of the above)
d) Red snapper with ponzu sauce
e) Sea perch with sea salt (really enjoyed the crunch of the salt)
f) Ocean trout (Scotland)
g) Scallops and uni (Hokkaido) 
h) Live giant clam
i) Bluefin tuna (Spain)
j) Otoro (this is what we've all been waiting for, melt-in-your-mouth goodness)
k) Kama toro (Okay, this was the showstopper, how could you follow up the otoro with this piece of magnificence?? Possibly the best piece of fish I've ever consumed)
l) Spanish mackerel with sesame seeds (hard to follow the fatty tuna, but the crushed sesame seeds was a nice touch)
m) Live uni (Japan); this was the sweetest uni I've ever tried

Sixth course: Chef Eric busts out the slab of delectable grade A5 wagyu from Kagoshima rated 10/12 on marbling. These were carefully torched and served on a hot stone. This was the otoro version of beef, literally melted in your mouth. Served with coarse salt and wasabi.

Seventh course: Lobster claw with green tea soba and uni sauce. Quite possibly my favorite dish. The uni sauce was unreal. Like, lick-the-plate-clean good.

Eighth course: Mong fish liver. Probably my least favorite dish, but still interesting.

Ninth course: Dessert finished the 2+ hour meal with a roasted green tea ice cream, simple, yet so much depth of flavor. 

I couldn't be more happy with the way dinner turned out. The intimate setting meant getting to know some of the other diners and the food surpassed my wildest expectations.

Sixteen lucky diners, (two seatings of 8 people) per day is the maximum. Chef has a passion for the best and most sought after ingredients for his presentations. He explains the rationale of each dish. I was exposed to a PHD in the art of seafood selection.

When making my reservation, I never thought of the date being Easter Monday after spring break and when people might not be going out because of the vacation period and the Easter eating.

Nevertheless, Chef Eric gave me a wonderful lesson in making sushi, where the different parts of the meal were sourced, and proceeded to put on a great show with the artistry he used in creating the different sashimi, nigiri sushi items, and some other dishes.

Chef Eric first made some wasabi and then showed me the two different soy sauces that were served.  The Japanese soy was so much better.  Then a series of pieces of sashimi were prepared.  The bluefin tuna from Spain was almost like eating a piece of steak.  Excellent!

In between, he made some sea bream sashimi.  After I was finished with the sashimi, he had the fish taken to the kitchen for deep frying and then brought back to eat the tail and bones up to the head.  It was very good and the soy based sauce served with it was tasty for dipping the pieces as I broke them off.  The same thing would happen later when I had some needle fish sashimi and the bones were again deep fried.  being a smaller fish, the fried bones were more tender.

After this, there was a series of pieces of nigiri sushi put on my wooden plate.  He put a small piece of wasabi under the fish and brushed soy on the sushi.  I can't remember all the things but they just kept coming.

Because I was there by myself, I didn't get the live lobster.  That's a dish meant for two or more people and would be too much with everything else I ate.

Two and a half hours later, I had learned a lot about sushi and I had enjoyed the finest sushi I've ever eaten.  Service was exemplary.  My iced tea was always refilled before it got to just under half full.  

I think some of the micro flowers and greens aren't necessary but they are important to Chef Eric as he is very much an artist with his food and the enjoyment of the food comes from its appearance as well as the taste.

I need to go back with some friends so I can share and try more things.  This is a great experience!!!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,29,27,5,3IV_S3Lb3gkCDkV2JTa2bg

Don't get me wrong it was not a bad meal by any means, but it wasn't worth the price ($165 per person without tax/tip) and I feel it doesn't match up near the meal I had at Kabuto.

5094984,2016-03-29,24,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"Vegas' penultimate sushi eatery, but...
 
Incredibly fresh, globally sourced ingredients treated with great respect.  Further, omakase at Kame provides the best educational sushi experience with the chef explaining sourcing, flavor profiles and why an ingredient was selected in an unpretentious environment.  Sounds good?

After being fortunate to enjoy sushi at Saito, Yoshitake, and Sukibayashi Jiro, Tokyo's Michelin three stared sushi eateries two problems arise:

- the progression of courses, especially the sushi, isn't as refined as it could be.  Courses either build or contrast one another to create the most intriguing symphony, telling a story.  This is critical with sushi that is usually served in VERY rapid succession (at Jiro,  you are expected to eat 15 pieces of sushi in 15-20 minutes)

-  more emphasis is placed on presentation than is necessary.  Gold leaf, edible flowers, green and orange tobiko, osetra caviar, looks great but has an effect on flavor and timing.

That said, treat dishes individually.  Dishes are impressive and well tailored to the American palate.  

The best example is the lobster sashimi.  Raw tail meat from a recently dispatched lobster is topped with Hokkaido uni, nasturtiums, tobiko, and osetra caviar.  Beautiful to look at, each bite a wonderfully rich seafood medley.  One thing, kabosu, light soy, and the tamale would have showcased the lobster beter, bringing its oceanic sweetness to the forefront..

Same can be said for a delicious Hokkaido hairy crab.  Succulent, firm, sweet leg meat served with a umame charges miso butter.  Very good but would taste worlds more amazing if the crab innards was the dipping sauce (perhaps too challenging for most).

Finally abalone sashimi.  Atop shiso and topped with caviar.  The saltiness of the caviar taste great with the sweet abalone but the piece touching the shiso picks up the distinct herbaceous flavor.  Konbu would have been more traditional.

Ultimately, expect to eat a ton of excellent uni (featured atop sushi and as a garnish) and fish eggs (tobiko, ikura, and osetra caviar as they decorate many dishes).  Excellent!

Sushi is well made.  Rice is gently seasoned and perfectly compacted so grains are not broken.  Very good seafood to rice balance.  Put it this way, no fish will be hanging out of your mouth as you eat.

Unorthodox approach to sushi but very pleasing.  That said, this rating is based on said criteria not against Japan's best.

Very well chosen sake list with fair pricing.

Reservations required.  Two settings nightly.  Omakase only (let them know allergies at the time of reservations). $150pp.

One final thing, begin rant:  turn off your phone and DO NOT put it on the sushi bar.  It is extremely disrespectful to the chef and rude to fellow diners.  The chef is sharing his art, fellow diners don't need their meal held up because someone needs to take a pic of the food.  Try it in Japan and see how fast you get thrown out.  End Rant.

Outstanding in almost every respect.  A worthy adventure.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,33,27,5,zM63H7MfakWVl7LRVLepQw

5529691,2018-02-27,62,9P23-V64kYz3trn9ecaJJA,"When it comes to sushi in Las Vegas, Chef Eric Youngsup Kim is the undisputed ""King of the North"" and makes a very compelling case as ruler to all.  His passion for Japanese cuisine, which he passes on to everyone he meets, is a large part of what makes this omakase a can't miss experience and worthy trek.  Yes, at $165 per person, it is considerably more than most off the strip, but you'll absolutely know where that money went.  

While no two evenings are really ever the same, one consistent item of this multicourse dinner is Chef's legendary ""Lobster Sashimi"".  Just the high quality raw lobster tail meat with some wasabi would do me fine, but it's then topped with an array of seafood ""bling"" that may include caviar, toro, uni and whatever else fresh that day, then presented beautifully on ice.  No other sushi chef in LV does it like this and it hits me in the feels every time like it's my first time.  
   
I love tuna and the last two visits included incredible pieces of ""Kama Toro"", which is different than o-toro or chu-toro (also part of the nigiri portion of the meal), originating from the gill area, but still oishiiiii as all hell.  The full cut resembles exquisitely marbled tenderloin that I would have bolted out of the door with never to be heard from again had it been possible.  Served as nigiri, it is oily, fatty, and tender with great texture and flavor that I am dying to have again as soon as possible.  It would be around $20 per piece on the Strip and we received two pieces each that I did my best to savor.  This was also when a strange, yet pleasant, sensation that can only be caused by sushi, occurred in my mouth, brain and crotch area simultaneously.

Another standout offering is the certified A5 Wagyu from Kagoshima Prefecture (level 10 out of 12 marbling) served on a hot rock plate.  It may actually be too fatty or rich for some like my wife, but that just means more of this amazing beefaliciousness for me.  Too rich for you?   DM me and I will drop everything I am doing and be right over.  Shit...is....magical!

All of my gushing and I didn't even get to the hairy crab, the lobster claws with matcha noodles and uni cream or the chawanmushi with crab topped with foie gras and caviar.  But all of this and more is what makes what Chef Eric is doing a level up from other sushi restaurants. 

Kame takes reservations for 6pm or 8:30pm and the latter time per David V/Suki K is definitely better so the experience doesn't feel rushed.  The last dinner clocked in at over 3 freakin hours!

We were 3 seafood lovers and one who was...not at all.  And so it's a testament to Chef Eric and his team that ALL of us ate EVERYTHING put in front of us.  On the night that we arrived we were the only diners, so it was a nice treat to sit at the bar to watch Chef Eric and his team prepare everything for what felt like a private affair.   

In total, we had 20 items.  I enjoyed every single morsel.  We had everything ranging from Chilean Sea Bass to Hokkaido Hairy Crab to Kama Toro and Otoro to Waygu beef, Lobster and Uni.  I learned that Kama Toro is an extremely rare cut of tuna - it's a cut of marbled tuna taken from the cheek.  Even if restaurants WANTED to purchase that section it's not always available.  What was really neat is that Chef Eric brought out the full slab of tuna cheek (that had just arrived earlier that day if I recall) so we can see what the full piece looked like and understand what we were eating.  These little touches made the meal that much more enjoyable.

Every preparation was delicious and flavourful.  I especially liked the subtle variations in sauces and seasonings placed on the nigiri.  I'm not usually a fan of mackerel and yet I devoured my piece of spanish mackerel topped with roasted sesame.   At the end of the meal, we were presented with a pineapple sorbet and a bowl of lemon water to rinse our fingers with.  An awesome dining experience overall!  Can't wait to take other friends.

If there was one thing that bothered my friends (but not me as much), it's that for such an experience, the TV playing basketball was a little distracting.  It was facing the guests and so I imagine it was preferred by some?  Not sure.

Please note, they have very strict reservation and cancellation policies.  $100 cancellation fee within 48 hours, no substitutions whatsoever.  They take your credit card when you make your reservations so make sure you are going!!",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,4,2,5,s-Kj7J6htjO4nNSMX32eVQ

Very expensive for what you will be eating here but your dining also comes with an experience  you will crave for, over and over again. 

We had live shrimp and couple of other things like lobster and hairy crab (were also live as the chef claimed, i did not see it moving). Very good and fresh. My favorite was the toro. Everything was great and I just wish we were given 2pcs of each instead of just 1pc, a lot of things that were served were new to us and having it to taste for the first time... one bite was not enough to remember it.",ftttLxXB10LtHJ7v0j2hDA,0,0,4,sa3eThlw_UdcCh2nCqR2kA
