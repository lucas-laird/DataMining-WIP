3371078,2015-08-30,0,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,Just wanted to give a huge shoutout to the employee named Ron who works at this establishment. Every time I have ever come in to get pizza he always greets my boyfriend and I with such a warm welcome. He is the reason why we come to this Dominos every time to get our pizza because of the excellent customer service that he provides. He is an outstanding employee and deserves a lot of praise for what he does. Thank you so much for being so kind and caring you have earned our business for life without a doubt,1xx23TeJANXnExyxTs7AoQ,0,0,5,XXsWWzqjCsWfGIoSLoi6rQ
3383622,2016-11-14,0,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,"Update... After one year of not coming to this location, today 11/13/2016 I decided to give them another try and I placed an order and wow what a mistake that was! First things first when I go to pay for my order 30 telling me I can't use my gift card because I never registered to use a gift card with that location but you don't have to register a gift card nor do you have to register with a certain location.. I finally convinced them to swipe the damn card and lo and behold it worked so the guy at the register hands me my food 1 large pizza with pepperoni and double feta cheese and the Order of parmesan bites the large order. My pizza had no feta cheese, horribly undercooked and the parmesan bites or burnt and hard as a rock. It's been a year since I went to this location and as of today I can finally say without a shadow of a doubt never again. I'd like to apologize for my spelling and punctuation as I'm in the car and using voice to text and as we all know voice to text is very inaccurate and I'm so angry I'm not even going to proofread it",SmoxFjJ9QE3v38nm0dC1RQ,0,0,1,u9V0D6EyAK6-YBgqigVraw

I'm glad I ordered extra cheese because if I didn't, there may not have been any cheese on it at all. Plus the crust is too chewy. I'm not sure if the dough comes in frozen or not, but it's definitely not made in store, just like all of the other chains. Dominos pizza overall is nasty. But this particular one made the pizza as best they are able to. What does one expect for a 14"" pizza for $7.99?",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,0,0,3,iDf1W-WQeo3HAwW6TQtd1w

He told me it must have bren a flat batch and he forgot to put the seasoning on.  Nothing he could do about it,  yet he's the manager.

Driver was very polite.   I did leave feedback on their website and much to the credit to the manager, Miranda, she called me right away and offered a credit for next time. Doesn't help for tonight.

Staff was friendly. Store was clean. Pizza was hot and delicious. Summerlin Dominos is a safe bet when ordering  pizza and I would definitely recommend.

Only 4 stars because this location can skimp on the cheese and that's just not cool.",kl_yCsj4ESbUphmpCfVvRA,11,7,4,-hbfzUOnIrpg-Jqv9DashQ
4971513,2013-03-18,0,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,It never ceases to amaze me just how UN-impressed I am when I order a pizza from Domino's.  I guess you get what you pay for.  There's a reason this Domino's is consistently ranked in the bottom tier of their franchise stores.,Y6otbk7H7mDMbXBVKL9yeA,1,0,3,btMhRqGI2xbVEoAQQAwG8w
5365347,2014-04-14,0,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,Order delivery a few times a month. The pizza and wings are always hot and tasty (hunger is the best ingredient).  Delivery drivers are usually quick & friendly. They have made mistakes & forgot sauces that were paid for to accompany items I have ordered on more than one occasion. I finally decided to call and complain after the 4th (possibly 5th) time and the manager was very responsive and handled the situation to my satisfaction. We haven't had any issues since.,4wllBAI5xR2wF_oSDz4_dw,1,0,4,ulAJaEI2KIi7zIeIYDamBA
5516603,2012-10-26,3,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,"OK, it was kinda fun to watch the little man on my computer screen ""take"" my order and fake-make my pizza and send it off for delivery in real-time. It was a little startling to hear him address me after the delivery to tell me he hoped I enjoyed the food!  Geekiness aside, the food was made and delivered in under 30 minutes. The driver was friendly and the food was good. I don't know if they're all the same but this one has a variety of sub sandwiches, various chicken wings, miniature parmesan cheese bites (sort of like mini soft pretzels with parmesan), and , of course, pizza. They also have pasta meals.  If you're in a hurry for a quick fix, this place will do.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,3,2,4,_1AiGml1YbJzqNZQMN57QQ
5530645,2016-06-10,1,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised today when we ordered 2 deep dish pizzas.  They were actually really good.  Several years ago, they were advertising how they needed to improve their recipe. When they did, we were still not impressed.  Over the years though they must have been tweaking the recipe because they were both great.  One was pepperoni and black olives and the other was just extra cheese.

The order was called in and Glen took our order, he we very friendly, easy to understand (another pet peeve of mine is when the person on the phone talks so fast you can't even understand their name or the business name).  Glen took our order and answered all my questions.  I didn't feel like he was just trying to rush through the order to get to the next caller.  

When we arrived 15 minutes later to pick up the order, it was piping hot and ready to go.  It must have just come out of the oven!!  Good job Dominos on this establishment and the improved flavor.",gJbjgo4zWyoTfjiCvzsFRw,3,2,4,Qt9I1LuobRXK908BofLuQw
5538816,2014-12-05,1,eNrBPQA92s7ckh2FOWi8Eg,"This Domino's is on the border between four and five stars. Very good service, I often order delivery a few days in a row every now and then (who doesn't love Pizza?). I usually get the ""two medium two topping pizza"" deal along with an order of lava cake and it always comes to a total of $19.97 with the delivery fee (My delivery always comes in less than 30 mins since I live nearby). Their crust is the utmost delicious crust out of all the pizza companies. Domino's pizza will always be the #1 pizza for me. 

So why the four, and not five stars? The reason being that, sometimes there are days that I get a pizza with a crust that doesn't have much flavor (A few times I get one that tastes pretty plain and bland) or days where my lava cake doesn't have any powdered sugar that it usually always comes along with (which makes it taste more plain to me). Not only that, but, I once also got my pizza with one of the toppings missing (I'm not one to really complain so I just sucked it up). 

However, when it comes down to it, we're all human and we make mistakes from time to time. It's not like any of those mishaps were major or anything, but they were manageable (for me at least).",pqv3nCFbcQLTqTB6yzGE8g,4,1,4,GwKPQrA8_tlnkHCX2e6gWw
