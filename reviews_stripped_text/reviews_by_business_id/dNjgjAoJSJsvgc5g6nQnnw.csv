This is what you call a prime example of a GREAT Roberto's. I understand that many of the Roberto's have different owners, but this location sets the best example.

I love that the price is reasonable for the taste! Carne asada burrito always comes out cooked well with just enough guacamole to inspire your taste buds.

I think having horchata available is a MUST in any Mexican restaurant. The service for a Spanish-speaking employee is amazing! They always understand how I want my order. I do not have to say anything in Spanish. 

Always remember that they are willing to customize the food, although the generic menu is great as it is!

Carne asada [plate, burrito, nachos, fries, or taco]
Shrimp burrito
Chicken taco
Bean burrito [chimichanga style or wet] - add spice

4146970,2014-04-29,0,dNjgjAoJSJsvgc5g6nQnnw,"I love Roberto's and have for a long time.  I have my favorites from here and those are what I usually order.  They are the chicken tacos (2 or 3 at $0.99 each on Wednesdays) and an order of three rolled beef tacos with guacamole.  I also occasionally get the chicken burrito meal ($3.99 on Mondays).  I used to order the carne asada burrito (my dads favorite) but I don't care for the amount of onion in it and I always forget to aske them to leave it off.  Other highlights at Roberto's include the asada fries.  Think of them as nachos with fries instead of chips.  They are loaded with cheese, beans and carne asada.  I only ordered them once and that was enough for awhile.  They are insanely good but also monsterously big.  It was too much even for a big eater like me.  The same can be said about the chimichunga which I do at times order in a combo with rice and beans.  The beans are good but I can do without them.  The rice, on the other hand, is great and sometimes I just order a side of it because it is so good.  

While the food quality at various Roberto's shops is pretty standard and equal to one another each location varies in its appearance and cleanliness.  This Roberto's which I go to most frequently is one of the cleanest I've seen.  I love coming in.  The only questionable area is the cold bar with the salsas, cucumber, radishes, green onions, limes and pickled jalapenos and carrots.  Despite the splatters of salsa soiling the stainless steel I still like to get some of the carrots, cucumber and radishes.

4358033,2011-06-30,0,dNjgjAoJSJsvgc5g6nQnnw,"Ok I'm posting it here because it happened to be the closest one (and the one I just ate at) and I'm sick and tired of all this Roberto's is the sh*t sh*t!!! As you can see I'm not a fan at all. 
First off let's talk about what they do right: the staff at every location I've been to is very friendly and professional. They are courteous and quick and I've always had them get my order right. The locations are invariably clean as well. Kudos for that. 
The problem for me is the food. I am a damn good cook - I make damn good food - and I'm from Texas. All of my grandparents were from Mexico and since I've been eating this food all my life I feel like I'm pretty well qualified to comment on this. Mexican food done right is the best food in the world. Done wrong - well if you haven't seen the episode of South Park where the dead celebrities are haunting Ike (Kyle's little brother) and Billy Mays's undead spirit is hawking Chipotle-Away because it can get the blood stains shooting from your ass at high velocity out of your underwear from the burrito you ate earlier - well let's just hope you don't ever experience the Mexican Screaming Shits. It's not pretty. It's actually pretty damn ugly. And it smells bad. Nuff said.
The food here is mediocre at best and I have found it's rarely at its best. I've tried a number of different items and each one is always greasy and covered in cheese. Now anyone who knows me knows my opinion on toppings, condiments and fillers. When they are the star of the meal, it's a sign of mediocre (at best) food. So why is everything on this menu loaded with it? Hmm...not a good omen but we'll see.
I ordered a breakfast burrito here (sans cheese) and was less than impressed. Granted the sausage was ok - not great, not horrible, just kinda...meh. The burrito was hot and made to order, which is good. However, it was wrapped in a tortilla that felt like it had been slathered with lard and heated. How do you serve a greasy tortilla? REALLY??
Now I've eaten at Roberto's several times since I moved here - my friends have always said it's great drunk food and the first few times I went I was a bit drunk so I guess I must not have noticed. The last bunch of times I've gone though I've been sober and every time I just like it less and less. I just cannot ignore that the only thing I usually taste is the cheese (which is not good at all since I'm lactose intolerant) and I'm just really not a big fan of things tasting cheesy. I had the burrito without it and - guess what - it was mediocre. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just...meh. Nothing about it shone. I couldn't even taste the pico de gallo which it was supposed to have. Hell I can buy a better burrito at Carl's Jr!
Thank you - but no. I don't think I'll be going back to Roberto's anymore unless I'm just desperate and can't find a Del Taco. It's really a shame, too. Oh Roberto's you had so much promise. Too bad you couldn't deliver.",glYwn0bUfowzSEujf4Tmcg,3,1,1,EXK5aseK0IbZ1QC23dLYvA

Basically I paid for onions and green peppers with a hint of meat in all three items.

5467330,2016-09-29,0,dNjgjAoJSJsvgc5g6nQnnw,"Roberto's is a Las Vegas favorite. Ask anyone from Vegas and they will tell you that they love Roberto's. This is likely why they have so many locations. Roberto's is the perfect cheap late night indulgence. The portions are absolutely huge and the food its self is to die for, at least if  you like casual Mexican fare. Its not the nicest or even cleanest looking place but once you have eaten the food you don't care. This place is so popular that its hard for them to keep up with the wear and tear that comes with being the neighborhoods favorite. 

They have an awesome little salsa bar that includes things like pickled carrots, radish, cucumbers, whole peppers, and a variety of house salsas that sit next to plastic bags and cups because they know you want to take a lot of it home with you. They are ok with that, this is not a place where the restrained come to dine. This establishment is where everyone goes after they leave the bar early in the morning to get some greasy food before passing out. Its where the college kids go to get two days worth of food for cheap. Put simply- Roberto's is a Las Vegas institution and taco tradition as beloved as the city it's self.",AM4829Fe_uSt1iXetnKHLA,1,2,5,QNLw_BMQgMoMFNzolcIKcw
5586758,2011-07-26,1,dNjgjAoJSJsvgc5g6nQnnw,"Two words: Chile relleno. 

Three more words: With the seeds?! 

The order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. 

It has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.

However, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. 

Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.

Checked Yelp and the locals seem to love the place so I gave it a try. Big mistake! Ordered 2 Carne asada tacos--nice size but zero flavor on the meat. Not even salt or pepper. The onion cilantro mix is ridiculous as the onions are chopped way too big and there there is barely any cilantro seen. The menu says it comes with guacamole but this is just a green liquid that resembles a green salsa without the jalapeño kick. The 2nd taco dripped about 1 teaspoon of grease onto my plate which caused my tortilla to break as well. Also ordered a Horchata and I don't taste any cinnamon!  Oh and what taqueria charges extra for chips?! Sorry locals, but this place is horrible!",u6B4C9VzTtJ93PoEpUGj_Q,1,0,1,02DpdL5PGDWj0FEAfOWCDA

5939147,2013-05-05,22,dNjgjAoJSJsvgc5g6nQnnw,"Before I take a hike from Yelp, I really want to give credit to the hard working employees at this location. I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better. 

I've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos. 

9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.

9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!! 

The guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!  

Actually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,12,12,5,rAbp4Gcj1sSvJD1h9Gmkvg
