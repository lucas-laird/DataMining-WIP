I read some other reviews about how they use artificial ingredients, but there is nothing artificial about the food here. They even started making their own marmalade which was amazing. I've had several dishes here and all have been amazing and on point. I've brought other people to this location and we have all come back for more. The blue crab benedict was a hit at the table, the custard pancakes were great, and the Huevos rancheros hit the spot...I think my friend even licked the plate clean.

Reason for the two star instead of one was due to the food actually having decent flavor, but not enough to bring me back. 

The restaurant is really small. Extremely casual considering it's in the Delano. 

My server informed me that he would be going on break. He said another server (gave a name) would be taking care of us. That server never came by to introduce themselves or check on the table. We tried to flag down three different employees and each of them said, ""that's not my station"". I finally had to flag down a manager to close out my bill.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,1,0,2,znAjTi6Pd9JiDGXZ2MrsgQ

215544,2016-07-13,0,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"Food was excellent. Had the chicken & waffles and while the waffle was soft and warm it was nothing special. The chicken breast breading/seasoning was better than I've had at most places. It was a boneless breast but still had really good flavor, juiciness to it. Surprisingly the bacon thrown in under the chicken was the best part. Not usually a big bacon guy but it had low fat content and not so salty flavor. Thick cut and crunchy without being crispy. I also got the sweet tots because I'm a sucker for tots and anything sweet potato. Nothing you couldn't get at a red robin or some bring but still very good. Had a fresh green juice and it was pleasantly not hat awful. Don't know if I'm being overly picky but I was in a rush to get out at the end of my meal and it took a good 7 minutes to get anyone to notice I wanted a check. They had JUST seated a table of 15 so I get it but it was just frustrating. Overall paid $40 and got good food. Perhaps a bit expensive but it was a solid serving for both the entree and and side dish.

I'm only speaking for the breakfast burrito which included egg whites, peppers, spinach, avocado, asparagus and a wheat tortilla. Apparently a fruit bowl should only consist of melons and 2 pieces of pineapple. What was most annoying is the fact that our waiter didn't ask if we'd like refills, and also having to get up to ask another host to give us the check. We asked our waiter once he looked away and kept working. We asked him again, and he started conversing with another host while we had to wait. Finally when my sister was fed up and got up to ask management, he overheard the conversation she was having and then finally said ok, he will take care of it.

Food arrived in a timely manner and was very delicious and fresh tasting. Presentation on each dish was appealing as well. The raspberries were especially flavorful, and the manager told us they came from a small farm in California. Kids ordered pancakes and French toast which were both very fluffy and loaded with fresh fruit. Portion sizes were very generous but we still managed to eat everything because of how delicious it all was. Our service was top-notch!! We loved how caring and attentive our waiter, Kawin, was.

Mocha latte had good flavor, but luke warm. Crab benedict that I saw people said was ""amazing"" had a strong odor. It came out not quite ""hot"" just like a little above luke warm. 

My niece and nephew didnt like the bacon. Which I don't eat so I can't be thw judge. The ""roasted heirloom potatoes"" were barely roasted and seasoned which I love potatoes, I couldn't eat that. It also wasn't very warm either.

I want to know if its a thing here that food isn't hot? Ive been to a hippie type restaurant where that's been known you dont get hot food, but warn me!!!

No, they told me that the charge is mentioned on the menu (really?) and that they would be happy to remove it from my bill (don't waste my time for 50 cents).  So instead of writing about how much I enjoyed the Blue Crab Benedict (a lot), I'm writing about how they sneaked-in a 50 cent charge for water without telling me first.

Della's has a semi-captured customer base.  Not really, but if you want to grab a quick bite to eat while staying at the Delano, that is also extremely convenient, this is where you will end up.  

I ordered a simple meal of oatmeal, coffee and water.  Easy enough.  The oatmeal was overcooked, lacking the ""bite"" of steel-cut oatmeal (which is the reason most of us order steel-cut oatmeal).  Asked for water, twice and did not receive.  Asked for a coffee refill, twice.  Cup was refilled after the second request.  This happens when a place is busy; however, I was one of five diners.

So, while initial reaction was to rate two stars, but will give the benefit of the doubt and assume it was just an off day for the server and kitchen.  Will give Della's another try and update review.",U2cNYvPy5EHkBsp-GIsXaQ,0,0,3,8QAxUZyUcALw-RMnxfFChg

Our party of four ordered two Cubano sandwiches, a beef panini and a club sandwich. There was very little meat in the Cubano sandwiches, the panini was cold, the cheese not even melted. I sent it back asking that they put it back into the press for a little longer. When it was brought back it was obvious that they microwaved it resulting in rubbery bread. 

The server never asked how our meal was. They charged $21 to $23 for each of the sandwiches and fifty cents each for water.

Pork benedict with a biscuit and gravy for me, chicken and waffles for the girlfriend. The pork benedict was excellent, just the way eggs benny should be made. Highly recommended for any benedict fan! The biscuits and gravy were okay. The gravy was perfect, but there wasn't enough to make up for the overpowering dryness of the biscuit. Left the last few bites because I had no more gravy, and I sure as he'll wasn't gonna put that sawdust in my mouth without assistance. I'd say I'd drink the water to help, but they charge you for it.

1264814,2015-07-14,7,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"We ended up eating breakfast twice at Della's Kitchen & WHAT a find this turned out to be!!!

Not wanting to waste 1 hour commuting to Bouchon for breakfast, we elected to stroll around our hotel complex & see what looked interesting.  By lucky happenstance, we passed by Della's

They are open only for breakfast & lunch but serve both menus the whole time they're open.

1st morning, we had the custard pancakes w/ vanilla butter - so soft & custardy ( as the name implied ).  This was the hit of the table & in fact, Sis, who is not a sweet person, chose them as her day 2 breakfast and THAT is saying something!

Also chose the Belgian waffle w/ lavender butter - strong lavender but not soapy - another winner!

Mr had the veggie frittata & he was loving the eggs mixed w/ quinoa.  Provided a unique texture & flavor layer.....and let's just say they make ALL their own sauces.  Ketchup, homemade strawberry jam & hot sauce to boot.  We tried them all during our 2 visits & not only could you tell they were homemade but they were scrumptious!

Day 2 Mr & I were dying to try their Truffled Pappardelle w/ mushrooms, asparagus & peas.  The ingredients were so simple but the flavor so incredible

Before Day 2 breakfast was brought out, we were treated to homemade cornbread w/ the homemade jam - it was slightly sweet & lots of corn flavor - could have had about 12 more of these ( each )

Then we were offered a roung of their freshly pressed juices - we had a kale, celery, apple mix & an orange, pineapple & ginger mix.  Both were outstanding

After we made complete piggies of ourselves, & are waiting on the check, out comes complimentary homemade granola bars w/ dark chocolate, dried fruits, quinoa & oats. Our waiter says: ""We like to show off"".  It was the perfect little bite and fab ending to a lovely 2 meals.......this is a destination spot for sure!

Can't believe they aren't happy enough with the money they took the night before to be more reasonable; unless I clean up tonight and probably even if I do, I'll be at Denny's tomorrow for the same meal, similar quality at a third the price.",UgvO0JdfDva-fO2KkYZoKw,0,0,3,YwEUVKnj9_oi_0NFQXieCA

The food took forever to arrive.  The server disappeared never to return.  Whenever we needed ANYTHING (refills, check, check pick up, etc), I had to go find someone.  There were at least 6 staff members running around on a Sunday with a restaurant at best 1/3rd filled.  PAINFULLY slow.

We started with:

Pumpkin White Hot Chocolate with Kahlua (yes for breakfast - cuz Vegas)

We decided to split:

Blue Crab Eggs Benedict
White Chocolate Raspberry French Toast (I LOVE white chocolate and raspberry ANYTHING - so we had to order some sweet to go with our savory)!

We placed our drink order with a male server, less than 2 mins after that, a female server came over to take our drink order (weird).

We ended up with the female server - she was very nice and attentive (we were the 2nd table to be sat in the open restaurant... What looked like a business party of maybe 8 arrived after us... so the restaurant was pretty empty considering its in the city that never sleeps).

Anyway, a food runner brought our Eggs Benedict out with pancakes... Ummmmm we didn't order pancakes (and I know I didn't make a mistake when ordering) - he was a bit confused, apologized and said he'd let our waitress know.

She immediately came by, apologized again and said our French Toast would be out shortly... the Benedict was SOOOOOO good (HUGE FRESH CHUNKS of Blue Crab, sautéed veggies, excellent hollandaise sauce, atop a dense buttery brioche), I kinda forgot about the French Toast... but when we finally finished, the French Toast arrived... and it was a disappointment - 3 or 4 raspberries (they were fresh, which was great) and a sprinkle of white chocolate shavings... regular syrup, regular butter... I just expected more.

Anyway - the White Hot Chocolate and Blue Crab Eggs Benedict were a hit... I'll dream about them!!!!",GbNQMoMiYGYfGNwMH2OV1w,4,4,4,LWNA-Jf_uQNMY7dnxn4GTw

We tried the bloody Mary's and asked for it spicy. The garnish was a cheese stuffed jalapeño, wrapped in bacon. YUMMMM. And it was a huge drink. I switched to a glass of champagne after, but to me it tasted like prosecco so I wasn't too happy about that. 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and finished every last bit. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles. I had a bite and it was also really good. I've only had two chicken and waffles so far that I've liked, and this was the third.

Breakfast is done right here Delas Kitchen! Everything is made farm to table from the  Nevada area which influences the flavors and freshness. It also makes me feel a sense of humbleness because I'm contributing to the community lol ( my conscious needs this white lie for the gluttony) 

The portion sizes are huge, so don't be like me, share your meal if you don't plan on taking it home. After all, breakfast isn't very good after a few hours, no matter how fresh your meal is. Here's what we had:

Sweet Potato tater tots- These tots me dejaron con ganas caballero! I can't stop thinking about how perfectly executed  this dish was. The taters were crispy on the outside, and al dente on the inside with just the right amount of shredded potato texture. The flavor was sweet but not just of the legume. They were soooooo good! They were also served with a creamy sauce that had a little bit of spice to it. 

BLUE CRAB BENEDICT- So I decided to go big in Vegas, and I don't usually do seafood with breakfast unless it's smoked salmon or maybe shrimp, but this!!! The sauce was creamy, hearty and not overwhelming at all. It started off rich and sweet then had a tart flavor towards the end. The crab was most certainly present. Eggs were poached perfectly too! 

I also sampled my girlfriends dishes ( Belgian Waffles and the Omelet). Both were amazing and came with a side of this specialty carrot cake preserve. Andrea G. said quote ""It's like Thanksgiving in your mouth"" lol. 

The best part of this whole breakfast, a random gentleman walking by offered to pay for our meal and slapped $100 on the table and said "" Here's some good Karma for you"" you've got to love Vegas!!!

I got the Delano Breakfast, which offers eggs, toast, bacon or sausage and choice of potatoes or fruit. 

Scrambled eggs: Perfectly done so that they were smooth but not runny and not charred.
Maple pepper bacon: Really good and crisp. The pepper overshadows the flavor of the meat, though.
Hash browns: These were awesome because they tasted so fresh. They weren't greasy like most hash browns, so I'm assuming this place cooks them in healthy oils, not vegetable oil or butter.
Wheat toast: One big piece which was well toasted, I guess. It's hard to fuck up toast.
Cold-pressed juice: Kale, pineapple, cucumber, celery, ginger and lemon. Money!

This place also charged 50 cents for distilled water. It tastes great and if their distillation process ends up being environmentally friendly then 50 cents is a small price to pay. I see people on here who critique the price.

We kept it light for breakfast with 1 order of lemon yogurt with in house made granola w/ dried fruit and 1 order of steel cut oats.

Lemon yogurt was to die for, but it's a really small portion. The granola was very good as well .. they gave more granola vs. yogurt which in my opinion seemed a little backwards.

Steel cut oats was extremely basic - seemed like oats from the can with some brown sugar and milk on the side. Nothing fancy at all.

The ""toast"" was huge! Good tasting bread .. just a little over cooked as it was a little hard to bite into.

Their coffee tasted delicious but definitely not worth $5.50 per cup, I was afraid to even ask for a refill with the chances of it being another $5.50.

SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Main reason for docking stars on this review. Hostess and waitress seemed like neither one of them wanted to be there. However, food came out quickly; assuming it was because of our easy put together order.

This place is open on one side and provides decent people watching. I'd say take your hangover to Raffles. Della's is more about providing fresh, quality ingredients with enough of a touch of butter, cheese or sauce to keep the meal feeling pretty healthy, but not too much so. 

SERVICE and ENVIRONMENT = 5 Stars
- Roomy booths
- Attentive, accommodating but not overbearing service

I rated this five stars because I was so pleased with my breakfast this morning. Justin the manager stopped by and was very interested in hearing our feedback.

MEAL CHOICES = 5 Stars
1. Omelette with mushrooms, provolone, smoked bacon was made soft - exactly the way I like it. There were no overcooked or hard edges. Mushrooms were perfectly cooked, and the balance of the flavors was wonderful. Loved the bite of broccolini and the roasted tomato on the side. The dish was not shy on the amount of cheese, and was worth every bite. 

2. Carne Asada Huevos Rancheros - Flavorful, nice texture, generous portion and included salsa and tomatillo sauces. Lovely presentation. Could easily feed two.

3. Hasbrowns - One order done crisp, and one order done as usual. Both portions were delicious. 

4. Fig and ? bread - Surely this was homemade. It had a bit of sweetness that reminded me of sourdough. The real whipped butter was just the perfect topping.

5. Beet juice - Yum. Beet was the dominant flavor, but was more of an aftertaste. I first tasted the pineapple and strawberry. This sweet juice blend is beet colored and smells like beet, so only order this if you are a beet fan. I loved it!

6. Coffee - Nicely roasted, and not too strong. 

My only comment would be to bring out twice the amount of catsup that was provided. 

Other than that, Justin was kind enough to provide some of the fresh ground coffee to go! Completely unexpected, but very appreciated. What a treat and what a way to end a wonderful meal!",qHc12FFWCCAfJuNTTc3YDQ,5,2,5,OloIu_F0p577B-1x8NiAsA

Mind you this isn't any sort of buffet or anything, so I expected a decent-sized portion.  Boy was I wrong.  First thing that happened when my table sat down was an attempt to sell us high priced alcoholic drinks....again during breakfast time.  

I order a Chicken and Waffles dish, expecting some nice portions.  Instead, what I got was two minuscule pieces of chicken and a waffle.  It's really disappointing.  Waffles have the highest profit margin...the least they can do is to include one more piece of chicken.  

Did I mention their hot coffee is $5.50!!??!!!  WTF. An extra side of bacon is $5.    Also, the waitress attempted to charge our table a drink we didn't order.

If I have to walk to Starbucks after the meal and get coffee to wash out the taste in my mouth that's indication something missed the mark. I went ahead with the the mojave sunrise and somehow the pairing of the ginger and lemon with the the carrot juice just didn't seem to jive well for me. The ginger overpowered the drink and the lemon had me feeling like I was not turning life into lemonade as it had a very sour taste to it.

For the main course I set my sites on the Portuguese sausage and pastrami hash. While at least cooked well, for me the taste was just missing marks across the board. The Portuguese sausage itself was very gristley in texture and a little more on the chewy side than what I've had other places. The pastrami was very crispy and seemed over cooked to me which in turn removed a lot of the potential flavor I'm sure it had. I did enjoy my scrambled eggs, but c'mon you can't scramble up preparing scrambled eggs.

I won't really get into the service side from our waitress as she presented herself very pushy and made us feel rushed for one even when it was 6:30 and you barely just opened. Ok maybe I did get into describing it, but I felt it was necessary. 

Overall I'd say not quite a wonderful representation of a nice Vegas breakfast experience. To each it's own, but it would take a jackpot at this point to have me back in the kitchen anytime soon!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,0,1,2,QGBzpJddHjnje6P-8PAicA

Our waitress was friendly and came by a few times to see if we needed anything but it took over twenty minutes to get our bill after they had already taken our empty plates away.

2402877,2016-05-03,0,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"Better than just okay, but not sure if I would go back. The space is pretty nice for being in a hallway between the Delano and Mandalay. It has a lovely, calming color palette, with lots of wood. 

We shared the Delano breakfast ($19): two eggs any style (over medium), choice of meat, toast, fruit cup or potatoes. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the whole wheat toast was really delicious (it was a slice off an artisan loaf, I'm guessing. It had a really nice crunchy crust). Whipped butter and jam served on the side. The waiter neglected to ask what kind of sausage we wanted, so instead of the house made chicken apple, we got pork. It had good flavor, but was more on the fatty side for sausage. The fruit cup was a uneventful mix of unripe cantaloupe, honeydew, and some puny pieces of pineapple. Oh, and there was one small piece of broccolini. I'm all about veggies for breakfast so it would've been nice to have 2-3 pieces. 

The real disappointment was the doughssants, or whatever they're calling them there. I'm just going to say Cronuts. They were pretty dry and tasteless. One entire donut was basically hollow. I wasn't sure if they were a day old or overcooked, but for $7, I don't think so. Thankfully they took it off the bill after I brought it to my waiters attention. 

I guess my real problem with Della's is that they're just as expensive as Bouchon but are really lacking on so many levels. Maybe just order some eggs and toast.",f2c0zHEZf64GPxAcjP6pzw,4,1,4,T2_514pOXFWPXjehwR8ffQ

One of the co-managers sat us at the table and he was super nice. I love the open concept of the restaurant. Friend and I shared entrees just because it's too hard to pick just one. Loved the crab benedict. There were some nice chunks of lump crab meat mixed into the hollandaise, which was also abundant. Poached eggs were perfection over spinach and really tasty tomatoes. They were sweet and tangy and were little flavor bombs. I feel like it was worth the $24. The other entree was the special, short rib nachos (yes nachos for breakfast). There was a good amount of bite-sized pieces of short rib that were super tender and flavorful. Really delicious. Good thing we shared both because I could not have eaten the whole dish of crab benedict, nor my friend the short rib nachos. This is why tasting menus exist I guess. A little of everything is the way to go. Other friends had the chicken and waffles, which looked pretty decent, and the quinoa cereal looked very healthy. Our food took a while to come out, so they gave us complimentary cronuts, what!

Nice ambiance and authentic to the farm-to-table movement. 

Service was great, no issues whatsoever! 

Had the grilled chicken sandwich at the recommendation of the server. I was not disappointed! The bread seemed like and Asiago topped bun with a great chipotle mayo. Greens were green and not soggy - thanks for sparing me the iceburg lettuce! Good sized chicken breast that was moist and carried a good char flavor from the grill. 

Served with a side of choice between fries, kale slaw (kale much less than slaw), or fruit cup. 

Overall, a nice experience with an outrageous price of over $35 when paired with coffee. Price point is a little more than I can justify - but maybe I would feel differently if I had won lots of money at the tables :)

Food & Drinks:
They've got the normal drinks like orange juice & coffee, but they also have specialty juices. They're blends like the Sweet Beet that combine beet, pineapple, strawberry, apple & ginger together! I'm a coffee drinker myself, especially in Vegas, so although a cup costs me $5.25, there IS a bright side: free refills & you can even get a nice tall cup to go!

Of the foods I've tried, I enjoyed the Carne Asada Huevos Rancheros the best! Coming at about $18, it seems like typical expensive Vegas pricing, but there is a good portion of food to follow. My bf & I aren't the buffet type of people (not worth it for us), but splitting this Huevos Rancheros dish was just enough for us both to eat without being bloated full. The restaurant even automatically split the order when we told our waitress we were sharing!

Service:
Speaking of our waitress, the wait staff at Della's are pretty friendly in my experience. Although, my bf & I have noticed that service is a tad slow. I'm not sure if it has to do with the layout of the restaurant space itself or the fact that it's a packed Vegas restaurant, but even to get water or put our order in, we waited quite some time.

The Della's breakfast was just ok, wasn't that tasty and the egg and steak, well the steak was ordered medium, but she received a very well done piece of steak. It was so hard to cut and chew. 

We talked to the manager, Peter, he was very nice about the situation and thought their knife was full so he gave my friend a different knife to cut, and that too couldn't cut the meat. If both knives could not cut the meat, it's telling you something...the meat is over cooked. Peter was nice enough to give us a discount, but wish it was complimentary for the way the food was made.

It would be foolish to say it's healthy, but the food is certainly fresh, the portions are large and the prices are high, but fair for the strip. I would never pay $18 for an omelette this unmemorable and bland, except after a night of excessive drinking at the club.

This is a sit-down restaurant, but those too lazy (or hungover) to eat on premise can order food to-go and enjoy it in the privacy of your suite. They are only open for breakfast and lunch and have serve basic brunch items and sandwiches. The omelettes are HUGE and definitely shareable. I like that you can choose your filling (up to 3) and that they have a plentiful selection of veggies, meats and cheeses. The hash browns are very average, but sure do hit the spot the morning after.

Though it's not a place I would seek out from across the strip Della's is a safe choice for those staying at Delano and Mandalay Bay.",TNYM6vmcp1Nxibt7vsbx3g,7,7,3,tq8zd4igr1si0sNbDp3z_A

2997968,2014-10-09,0,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"I ended up at Della's Kitchen with Michael U. after a disappointing attempt at brunch elsewhere. It's a cute 'farm-to-table' style restaurant open to the walkway from Mandalay Bay to the new The Delano. I certainly think this was a win in the breakfast in Vegas department. 

You may wish to refer to Michael U's review for all the facts and details on the restaurant as well as pics. What follows is my opinion. We ordered quite a few items and split them all. Coffee, the pecan roll ($6), the biscuits ($5), the custard pancake, chicken and waffles, cinnamon raisin french toast, and the croque madame. The saddest dish was the croque madame. Suffering from not really being assembled properly,the bread became a burden and the mornay was lost on just Ok ham. 

The biscuits were very good. 3 mini salty, flaky, buttery. They had cheese, scallions, and bacon, but were not described as such in the menu. Despite their tasty flake, I still felt they needed butter and was happy they served whipped butter with our pastries. 

The pecan roll was stellar. I knew it would be amazing as soon as we cut into it. Tons or pecans, flaky, buttery, gooey. it had great texture and flavor. 

The pancake was good. Nothing to write home about, but it was done well! It would have been better had they served anything but the syrup they gave us. Hell, even warm up the fake syrup and it would have helped. But seriously, if they want to be farm to table. Step it up and get the real maple syrup. 

The french toast was better. I didn't notice any raisins and that was really a plus for me. That and the caramelized bananas with pecans that topped the custard soaked bread slices made this really tasty. Again, it would have been improved had the syrup been upgraded. 

The chicken and waffles were forgettable. Each ingredient was good on it's own and worked together, but nothing shined save the good bacon. 

There a quite a few other menu items I'd like to try as the menu looked good all around.

I found the service to be very acceptable and enjoyed the good coffee. I wished the water glasses were larger and thought the dishes were adorable. Overall, this was a win for breakfast with SO many just blah or super expensive places for breakfast, Della's was good and hearty and I recommend it.",0dHBPR0U2pKU5r2DTCbPuQ,2,1,4,1petos53L6noLjVEekgHZw

It seems to be an on going thing that the staff here is not as professional as they should be. My experience seems to be identical as many other reviewers. For starters I ended up coming here by default in a way because this place is located inside of the DELANO and I received a food and beverage credit. Before checking out I didn't find anything else that was open for per say breakfast so I decided on this place. My partner got us seated first and I came afterwards. Once I sat down we were once again greeted by our server who's name I won't put on blast but he seemed to be having an ""off"" day. I couldn't really decide on what to order right away and I felt somewhat rushed to place my order because the restaurant closed at 2PM. Keep in mind it was only around 1:15PM so what was the rush for? Anyways we ordered one of the special sandwiches that they were offering, something similar to a philly cheesesteak that ran us about $19. Was it worth it? Absolutely not... I wasn't impressed at the very least but I was hungry and my partner already complained about that awful chicken Panini they have on the menu which also cost around $18 I believe. My thing is, if you are going to charge these out of the ball park prices for these mediocre ass dishes at least make them delicious! Once we complained to the manager about the experience he did his due diligence and tried to rectify the situation, however I still was left with a bad taste in my mouth.. No pun intended..

The two girls at the host desk was rude and ""ghetto"" in terms of the way they were communicating with customers.  To be clear, they were ok with me, but just observing the way they interacted with other customers was embarrassing.  In addition to their communication style, it was hilarious to see how they were describing their customers on their sign in sheets.  They did this so they would know who to look for and call out in a sea of waiting people.  But if you are going to utilize that tactic, at least use it.  When they were calling my name, they were looking at another individual that did not look anything like me or wore any clothing that resembled what I was wearing, freaking hilarious.

1. Portuguese Sausage and Pastrami Hash - so damn good your eye balls will roll backwards.  I wouldn't mind just laying in a bed of this and eating it all day.

2. Della's Breakfast - bacon strips were soggy and soft, causing it to be a little chewy, but tasty.

3. French Toast - I liked it a lot here because the bread in the middle is not soggy like some places, but fluffy.  Although I have to say that what I received does not resemble the photos.  No pecan raisins, no caramelized banana and no coconut butter.

4. Club Sandwich - panini bread wasn't as hard as appears, so that's good. Turkey was a little dry, but good sandwich overall, the avocado was a nice addition to offset the slight dryness from the turkey

5.  Water - they charge 50 cents per person for water.  Umm, why?  Why would you do something like this?  Just...not...smart.  Gave some BS about how it is not tap water and that it was filtered, blah blah blah.  Spare me the explanation.  I'd rather you upsell and charge me the extra 50 cents on another item and tell me water is free.  When I dine in Vegas, I don't look at dollar signs.  I'm looking at principles and how well I am being served.  Don't turn me off like this and nickel and dime the customers.  Once again......just...not...smart.",EvdMsbv1ydlRpdk_iDLacw,2,0,4,F2ufooVJOkvg0zFqUDguEw

We came for brunch and it wasn't good. We were seated quickly but sat for about 20 minutes before I flagged down a waitress and begged her for coffee and water. Our waitress came over a little bit afterwards to tell us she'll help us soon and disappeared. When she emerged we ordered but she wandered away again so another waitress helped us most of the time when I would beg her for help. The restaurant wasn't full so I think we just got the wrong waitress. I hope our waitress shared her tip with the other waitress because she was our only help. 

As for the food it took forever. We were hoping that meant the food was amazing. My husband liked it but I ate the toast and about 2 bites before I was over it. I didn't like the sausage. The egg whites were good but they didn't have hot sauce for me to spice up the health food. I had to order something that was under their ""healthy"" designation of 700 calories.

For whatever reason, I ordered waffles both days. Day 1 I had the ""Churro"" waffle that was lightly dusted in cinnamon and sugar with a dollop of a heavenly espresso marscapone cream topping.  Day 2, I went with the Chicken and Waffle. Although I'm growing a bit tired of the whole C&W scene, this one really hit the spot. The chicken was perfectly juicy and the seasoned breading played well against the sweet waffle. They even slip a couple slices of bacon on there.

Service was decent, as was the coffee.  No wait either day to get a table, even at prime breakfast time. Situation might be different in a busier time of year. Saw Pete Rose eating there both days, so that was pretty cool for this Reds fan.",v8Mu5611FoG-nbOkqg0K4g,2,2,4,BWvgo-9HpinA6S8Ba7cE9w

   I ordered the Delano burger and tried a piece of the chipotle chicken sandwich. My burger was cooked as ordered and I had it with a salad on the side. The dressing for the salad was very acidy so I am glad I asked for it on the side along with the bacon jam, since I don't eat bacon. The blue cheese was a great addition to the burger and I am sure that the bacon jam would have been a great compliment to the blue cheese and burger as the person who tried it said it was delicious and had a great contrast between the crispy bacon and the sweetness of the jam.  The chipotle chicken sandwich was served with a side of coleslaw that I thought was a bit too sweet for my taste, but to each their own. The chipotle sandwich was full or flavor as well.

Decided to grab an early breakfast here during our stay at The Delano. Since we were part of the 8am crowd, we luckily did not have to wait for a table. After being seated and greeted by a number of super friendly workers, we examined our menus and decided what to order. My fiancé went for the Chicken & Waffles and I had a craving for their healthy version of a Breakfast Burrito. Obviously, we both started off with some coffee and it was pretty good. Almost could've been too bitter for me since I've been taking my coffee black these days, but it wasn't so I was pleased and caffeinated.

We quickly got our meals and we were both so excited because it looked delicious and the presentation was on point. I had a bite of the Chicken & Waffles which was really yummy. Chicken was nice and fried (just the way I like it sans bones) and the waffle was light and fluffy, but still had some weight to it to absorb the syrup. My burrito was SO GOOD. A whole wheat wrap filled with scrambled egg whites, asparagus, roasted peppers and cheddar cheese (I added this in extra because I  cheese). Unfortunately, the avocado was outside the burrito (I'm guessing for presentation purposes), but that didn't stop me from eating it! My burrito also came with hash browns and homemade ketchup. Hash browns were great - crispy and thick. The ketchup was just okay in my opinion, but that could also be because I'm used to the sugar-filled, processed Heinz ketchup lol. To go with my meal, our waitress also brought me their hot sauce made in-house. Now this was BOMB. Spicy and delicious, yummmm!

We left with full and happy stomachs, although a little lighter in our pockets (since this is vegas and inside a hotel, the food wasn't cheap, but the prices were not so extravagant that it wasn't worth it to splurge a little bit).

A must try if you're staying in the Mandalay Bay hotels!

PS: Going early is key because this place is only open for breakfast/lunch/brunch, so there will be a wait if you go during peak hours.",5FPDpe7KTSt5lrG3JZuynw,1,0,5,Er3lwcZQlkUyPCIlACIckw

The reason this review is being posted is based on the very bad attitude I just encountered at the front desk by the seating host. 
Mind you I've eaten at this restaurant so many times and have never encountered anything like this so it took me by surprise. I walked up at 9:30 to a restaurant that was not packed as a matter of fact it was pretty empty and asked to have myself and my mom seated.... The women at the front desk plainly looked dead in my face and said no we are not seating anyone for about 45 minutes but you can go to raffles cafe in mandalay bay. 
I looked at her confused and asked is it because you guys are busy or is there a wait? I don't understand. Then she reiterated the same thing again... No we are not seating anyone for about 45 minutes so you can go to Mandalay bay. Again I asked is there a wait? Are you guys busy cause for that's the case I'll wait. Are you closing early today? She looked at me and said no we are not busy, we are not closing early and rolled her eyes as she again reiterated the same response as before. 
Wow.... Honestly I love this place and it will be very very hard to walk by it every morning on my many many trips to Vegas every year as I always only stay at Delano but after that ugly show of extremely bad customer service I won't be able to go back there again.

3722150,2018-02-22,0,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"Abridged Version: the food is pretty good, the service is absolutely terrible. 

I ate breakfast at Della's each morning of my recent 3-night stay at the Delano. My room rate included a breakfast credit, otherwise I would not have returned after the first day.

Food I Ate: Chicken and Waffles, Croissant Sandwich, Sugar Bun Roll, and the Cup of Fruit side

Overall, I enjoyed all of the items I ordered, with the exception of the fruit cup. It was just lame, a couple sad pieces of cantaloupe and honeydew for $8. For $16, the Fresh Fruit Bowl looked 10x better. My favorite was probably the Chicken and Waffles.

Service Issues:
1. It took more than 30min to get two pastries, a cup of fruit, and a side salad. We ordered ready made items because we were in a bit of a hurry but they took longer than a lot of made to order items around us.
2. One of my friends ordered hot tea. First they brought out iced tea and implied she ordered incorrectly. Finally, they brought hot tea and she asked for milk. No milk came. When our food came, we asked for a side of milk again. The waiter said, ""a glass of milk? sure"" and walked away before we could correct him. At this point, she was willing to take it. Again, no milk. It was only on the 4th attempt, after we had nearly finished our meal, that we were able to get someone to bring milk. 
3. As other reviews stated, water costs $0.75/person. I don't care if they charge for water, but then it should be bottled water. This minuscule amount is just tacky when you're paying $100 for breakfast. The water comes in a carafe that looks like it hasn't been washed in years. On days 2 and 3, we weren't offered water at all. 
4. One day we were seated at a dirty table with no settings. I appreciate they were trying to seat us quickly, but I would've been happy to wait until they cleaned the table.",yEnudMSD5zaqItsdQby4cw,0,0,2,eBn1vMQtRtdYt9Ovi2znPQ

The primary reason for my 2 star rating is the service- they moved really fast when taking our order (perhaps because we were with kids and they wanted us out quickly?) but I sat with an empty drink for almost 15 minutes, despite trying to flag down multiple servers, and gave up on a 3rd drink because they never came back. When I finally flagged down someone to pay my check, he asked for my room number and then accused me of telling g him the wrong room number (which I didn't).

3962063,2017-12-25,1,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"Spent the night at Delano and decided to use our meal credits here in the morning for breakfast on Christmas. We were basically seated right away

I got the Dutch apple French toast (Granello Bakery cinnamon raisin brioche, bourbon custard, cinnamon-spiced apple compote, house-made granola, vanilla crème anglaise). This was really good!! It wasn't the best French toast I've ever had, but it was full of flavor. The cinnamon-spiced apple compote was absolutely delicious--not too sweet but just sweet enough to have the cinnamon-y, apple-y, autumnal flavor. I thought the granola was a nice touch too!! I've never seen granola put on French toast...and they make it in-house!! The brioche seemed to have different types of raisins in it, and the apples on top of the dish were cooked well and has a nice texture and flavor to them. I believe they rotate the type of French toast according to seasonal produce

We also got the Blue crab benedict (artisan brie, spinach, roasted tomato, blue crab mornay on toasted brioche) and the country style Portuguese hash (Portuguese sausage, red onion, red bliss potatoes, charred brussels sprouts, two farm eggs). I tried some of the benedict, and OH MY CRAB, it was absolutely delicious!! I usually don't like eggs benedict because I REALLY don't like hollandaise sauce, and I think it usually overpowers everything, but I really liked how they used brie instead!! The crab was nice and flavorful, and the eggs were good too. The cheese didn't have a prominent flavor over the rest of the dish. Smother it all over with some of the salsa they make in-house, and...*drools* AHHH!! My brother wasn't super impressed with the hash

I order a breakfast burrito wherever I see it, but I decided against it since I saw that they don't add potatoes to theirs. NO POTATOES IN A BREAKFAST BURRITO???????

They bring you still water, but if you ask, they'll give you sparkling in the same type of carafe. I thought their sparkling water kinda tasted like...the ocean at first. Really salty...

Bottom line: Delicious food!! Kinda pricy, but you can taste the quality. Try the crab benedict!! If you're a fan of seafood, you're sure to be impressed. It's a different take on the dish. Pretty good spot for breakfast/brunch located in the hotel!!

We ordered the Blue Crab Egg Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles. I've had a lot of egg benedict after all, it is my favorite kind of egg. I honestly would not consider this as egg benedict, more poached actually. I barely had some crab on my plate. Considering it is in the name and the price, I thought I'd get more crab.

Breakfast always starts with a cup of coffee and we took interest in the Ethiopian brew.  Very light and aromatic which was perfect for a Vegas morning.  My coffee never went below half and it was monitored intensely by the friendly servers.  

In addition to the coffee we tried the juice.  They have a few flavors but the favorite choice was the carrot, pineapple, and ginger!  Very fresh and good for you...

The berries we started with were organic from a farm in California that the Chef personally visited to handpick his ingredients.  It is topped with a home made vanilla bean spec cream and goes perfectly with cold blackberry blueberry strawberry combo.  

I ordered the Portuguese Hash with eggs over easy.  The hash was home
made with their spicy sausage and the it was not greasy like your typical hash.   The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hashbrowns were crispy on the outside and hot on the inside.  The chicken sausage and spicy sausage were cooked to perfection and includes all grass fed beef ingredients that the staff makes on site.  Did I mention they grow all their own vegetables in a greenhouse in the back parking lot???  There's a reason why the staff arrives at 0500 an hour and a half before it opens.

The ketchup was home made, a very smooth texture, and you can taste the freshness of the tomatoes.  Somebody mentioned a hot sauce issue in a previous review...don't listen to them.  As soon as the food arrived a bottle of home made hot sauce arrived with our food.  To prove it all I have pictures!  I'll stop writing because the pictures are worth a thousand words and they'll speak for themselves...and yes the water is 50 cents but it is the cleanest tasting water because they have a filtration system that makes it taste amazing!

We also ordered the burrata and prosciutto appetizer. It comes with only 3 pieces of bread. When I first saw it I thought the portion was too small for 2 people. I was wrong. It was just perfect! Cut the 3rd bread in half and share it.

This place gets pretty busy for breakfast/brunch. We came at 11:10 and the hostess said it would be a 20 minute wait. We ended up waiting double that (40mins). But I would say that it was worth the wait.",DEa615IKMclHk5UbsUK3tQ,2,1,4,E0Jy6Ao_XnjNFfij40GgYg

The waffle was light and fluffy and the side of bacon was cooked to perfection.  I also had a mimosa, which instead of coming with orange juice, they delivered a glass of champagne and three choices of freshly squeezed juices.

They have a good selection of cold press juices, which is a plus. Delicious.
I had the grilled chicken panini and I would advise anyone to choose otherwise. The panini is dry and the chicken has seen better days. Very wasteful of $18 for a sandwich.

We split the blue crab benedict, vanilla custard pancake (off menu currently), the chicken and waffle, with a side of grits. My favorite dish had to be the blue crab benedict--lots of crab and lots of flavor. It was delicious, I wish we had more. The chicken and waffle came in a close second.

I don't usually eat at any hotel lobby places, I almost walked by but changed my mind at the last second and went in.  Ate breakfast at Della's twice during the 5 days.  Experience #1 was 06.15.2015 ~ 9am. Ordered the simple 2 egg breakfast with their homemade chicken apple sausage patties, eggs over easy and sourdough. Had the mimosa flight and coffee.  From the greeting to the thank you and goodbye, everything was stellar. I give them a 100 out of 100. Hearty servings, delicious coffee with a big cup to go, homemade bread and I loved the chicken apple sausage.  It was like I was staying at a Ranch BNB, and someone you call ""Auntie"" was in the kitchen. Cost $40 for breakfast for one person. It's all pricey in Vegas, so food for $18, mimosa for $12, coffee for $5.25 is in line with elsewhere.

Experience #2:  06.16.2015 ~ 11 am, was not as perfect.  Service was slower, not as pleasant, not as formal, not as personable. For this day they get a 87 out of 100.  Had the Huevos Rancheros for 2, mimosas for 2 and coffee for 2.  It was good, just a bit spicy for a typical palette, although I personally liked it (if you can't take but the lightest spice - take a pass on it). Plate presentation was a bit unattractive. Cost for food was $18 per plate, mimosas $12 each, coffee $5.25 each.  Again in line with the like elsewhere.

I will not stay anywhere but The Delano if I have a choice on the next trip, and will definitely eat morning meals here again if given the chance. I am glad I did give them a try.

5092580,2016-01-08,3,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"Let me very clear... We didn't pay for our meals here and if we had, I would have been displeased.

I know that hotel restaurants and bars are somewhat expensive because you're paying for convenience and the hotel accoutrements, but dang!  $72 for a breakfast for three people that didn't include alcohol is a bit much.  Here's what we had:
 *  SPICED PUMPKIN PANCAKES - fresh bananas, toasted pecans, cinnamon butter; *  FRENCH TOAST * Granello's white chocolate & raspberry brioche, toasted hazelnuts; *   DELANO BREAKFAST *** two farm eggs, choice of maple pepper bacon, country-style pork sausage,house-made chicken-apple sausage, Portuguese sausage or country bone-in ham steak, Granello's country toast, choice of caramelized onion hash or roasted heirloom potatoes, cup of fruit, sliced tomato.

My daughter Muff had the French toast and maple pepper bacon.  It was okay.  My sister Luch had the Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes, coffee and maple pepper bacon.  It was okay.  I had the Delano Breakfast with two farm eggs (cheddar cheese added), maple pepper bacon, Granello's country toast, caramelized onion hash and coffee.  It was okay.  That was my issue with our entire meal...  Everything was just okay.

Breakfast is one of the cheapest meals to prepare.  Eggs, bacon, flour, nuts, butter, spices, potatoes, onions, cheese, bread and coffee.  I think that covers it.  Total supply cost = $6.  In the right hands, those same ingredients can be superlative, exquisite even.  Not here...everything was just okay.  Aldi's (The lower cost food chain) has a better pepper bacon.  I bit into the caramelized onion hash and didn't taste any onions.  That prompted me to dig through the entire pile of hash browns and there were no onions to be had.  Okey dokey! (When I mentioned it our server, she said that the onions were very fine and throughout the potatoes.  I think that I just got the wrong order and asked for some caramelized onions.)  The homemade jam served with my breakfast was so good that you could have spread it on dirty show leather.

Again, nothing glaringly wrong with the breakfast, but for $72 of lower cost food items, you expect more.",hnVXeRIxCf6CQc1wcRx3tg,4,0,3,rfv7TIoZ7XonJuWghb0miw
5146923,2018-03-31,0,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"Look, I get it, it's Vegas and things are pricey. I certainly have the means to pay and don't mind if I feel like I'm getting value for my money. 
But, this was quite possibly the worst breakfast for my money I've ever had. Seriously could have gone to Denny's and been happier. I ordered the basic, eggs, toast sausage and hash browns. I requested my eggs to be medium. Our server for some reason had a hard time with that concept even after I explained to her how I liked them done. Coffee was served and we asked for water as well. As I read more on their menu I noticed they support some type of organization that provides clean water to areas that don't have it. I fully support missions of this cause. But, to charge me .75 a glass when you're already gouging me for an $6 for a cup of coffee seemed a bit extreme. 
So, now comes the food. For my $20 basic breakfast I got eggs that were so runny, if I hadn't seen that the whites were somewhat solid I'd have never known the had even been cooked. The sausage was disgusting. Don't even know how to describe the taste. For my daughters same meal her meat choice was bacon. It was served basically raw. Toast was so hard I wish I'd had my power saw to even cut it. And lastly the hash browns were cold. My wife did enjoy the chicken and waffle which is why I did manage to give a star. 
Our service was lackluster with only one check of our table to refill our coffee. We were never asked if everything came out the way we wanted it. Even if they had, by this time I was too aggravated to be kind and I didn't want to say something I might regret. All told, the cost was $85 for the three of us! 

So, tomorrow we'll eat at Denny's for less than half the cost and I'm sure I'll enjoy it more. And with the money I'll save I'll make a nice donation to an organization that provides clean water.

I was hoping this could balance out the sweetness of the French Toast but couldn't finish the sausage because of it was not enjoyable to eat.

Located in the recently rebranded ""The Delano"" at Mandalay Bay, a 9:00am breakfast at Della's Kitchen proved to be just-the-thing after attempted brunch at Ri Ra went belly up, the ""historic farmhouse meets urban kitchen"" serving up a two-course, six item feast amidst soaring ceilings as passers-by looked on.  Formerly known as THEcafe, with upgraded décor befitting any number of farm-to-table spots in the current culinary landscape, it was quickly upon checking-in at the podium that we were seated at a large 4-top and, although servers proved a bit overzealous to take orders while coffee and water refills languished, it would require a whole lot of nit-picking to find any fault in the cuisine.  Beginning first with a triplet of tiny biscuits that wowed with complex flavors amidst softly separating layers it was onward to sweeter things that we soon progressed and, although the fluffy pancake was itself quite pleasant, it was the spiraled pecan pastry that stole the spotlight - a veritable deep-dish pecan pie beset on all sides by the  buttery cinnamon roll.  So far impressed it was fast-on-the-heels of appetizers that our entrees arrived and although artificial 'pancake syrup' slightly marred the experience one would be hard pressed to pick a winner amongst the three, the savory open-faced ham sandwich adrift in creamy Mornay atop toasty bread while the custard-soft French Toast and supple waffle beneath a crispy brined breast were each reference standard, the later amongst the best found in Las Vegas to date.

Commanding a pricetag commiserate to its location, and open with the full menu offered as early as 6:30am, Della's Kitchen is a welcome addition to the local breakfast scene and the sort of place I can see only getting better with time.  Already cooking at a high level with ingredients including a lot of local produce, organic meats, plus breads from Granello Bakery I find it rather disappointing that syrup was not pure and that service is not yet up to snuff, but with a few small tweaks this is a place that could finally represent not only a good breakfast to those confined to the south end of The Strip, but one worth traveling to.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,1,3,3ZPR2r2hgYtH4JLeoFpA1A

When a diner can leave one person completely satisfied at $10, the question becomes how much more worth are ingredients that are maybe 1.7x as good, but the price is 3x. 

Maybe if everything is perfect when the price is 3x, then okay. But if one thing falls down....
 
Lovely setting in passage between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, and would have been super but for the ambient music. It's not Della's fault, that music fills the passageway. But with no walls, turn it down, please.

I had delicious coffee, water in a slightly tinted glass, and an enormous stack of pumpkin pancakes. She had the poached eggs, fruit, toast, and sausage. All as good as it could be, but for the sausage that was tasty but rubbery. Maybe it came from a beast raised in the Amazon rubber forest, or something

Tips: 

1. Booths are better than tables.
2. One of you should get the pancakes; it's too much for one person to finish.
3. Bathroom are in the passageway across from the restaurant, and to the right. Guys' was well-appointed, women's reportedly dark.",MLYoK0Q5xTdBYPmmS2bMKQ,0,0,3,1PQJyIc-uFH69ZzK5HNkZg

First impression was nice! The guy who greeted us was probably the manager, and very friendly... Causal, yet upscale vibe here too. 
The restaurant was fairly busy, but we only had to wait a few minutes as they setup a table for us. We were sat at a 2-top near the rail, where hotel & casino guests of all kinds loudly passed by. Not that we expected a quiet fine dining experience or anything, but this will make your stay a bit unpredictable. i.e. Possible drunk people screaming as they walk by, etc. I personally recommend waiting for an interior booth - I'm sure this will ultimately be a much better experience, both for comfort & noise levels. 
The food definitely looked amazing when it came out, nice presentation - but I feel like I've had better french toast at the Hash House for example and tastier huevos rancheros at a more authentic Mexican establishment (no surprise there). 
I like that their house water is served cold with no ice from a carafe, but they should probably leave the pitcher on the table if they're not going to be on top of refilling their small glasses. The waitress & busboy just both seemed as if their section was massive, and they couldn't handle it. I'm not sure if this was the case, or perhaps they were short staffed? Or maybe their service just isn't up to par; Besides the missing refills, our plates were never bussed. My napkin was sitting on my empty plate for a solid 10 minutes. This is a big fail in my opinion, because the layout of the cafe is very open, so there's great visibility. A good server or busser would have seen this much sooner, and removed the dirty dishes...

Not only does it offer a wide variety menu but they also serve fresh pressed juices. My favorite! I had the beet juice which was very smooth and good quality. They also have different bread and biscuit baskets for a starter which I thought was different and a great idea for breakfast. My favorite thing about this restaurant is that it's big and has many tables so you never feel rushed! In Vegas I'm used to long waits and feeling rushed by servers so this experience was refreshing. I can't wait to go back! 

P.s. This is the perfect place to sit back and relax if you need to burn time before heading to the airport.",-kRQLEDxrEBVNXImyAt_ug,0,0,4,qGyX56UfwpcUcQApSAeGEg

5919208,2018-01-28,9,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"I dunno, but I really liked Della's Kitchen even if it's a few dollars overpriced.  In fact, I went all 3 days recently while attending a convention at Delano/Mandalay Bay.  Since it's the only bonafide reasonable dining experience at the Delano Hotel (I don't count 3940 Coffee & Tea nor the ultra-nice 64th floor ""Rivea""), it would be very nice if they would expand their hours and didn't close at 2pm or be ONLY Monday-Friday.  What about the hungry weekend warriors in Vegas?

I tried a number of things during my recent trip:
====================================
1.  Fried Chicken & Waffles [$23, 4.5 stars] -- buttermilk-battered fried organic & free-range chicken breast, bacon, waffles -- topped with 100% delectable maple syrup with 100% satisfaction.

2.  Chia Seed Pudding [$16, 4.5 stars] -- don't get excited as I did peeps, it's not really pudding, but for what it is, it's very good.  Chia seeds mixed into plain yogurt, housemade granola, berries and pomegranate seeds.  Nice and light for breaky.

3.  Fresh Fruit Bowl [$17, 5.0 stars] -- a large mixed bowl of amazing fruit: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew.  Perfect.

All in all, I found the food very good:
============================
My dining partners/co-workers loved the burger and Croissant Breakfast Sandwich (scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar), while only the Breakfast Burrito didn't make the cut due to the spinach being too watery and making the whole thing soggy (scrambled egg whites, mushrooms, asparagus, roasted peppers, spinach, and avocado).",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,21,19,4,Ma3dJANgxKL7IlhrXsye6A

Very tasty lunch and beautiful surroundings.  I had the Ahi Pole appetizer and hubby had the Club Sandwich.  I have a tiny appetite so the Ahi was perfect for me.  Super fresh and delicious. The salad alongside it was amazing. Super light  sesame dressing!

Hubby really enjoyed the Club although a little untraditional on untoasted foccacia.  

For dessert...had the seasonal Apple Cobbler for two.  Oh wow....comes with cinnamon ice cream and cookies.  One of the best desserts ever and only $10 for this fantastic dessert...are you kidding me?

Definitely a ""do again"" place!",je7jNOQaoOeauvgIQWQrvw,0,2,4,O7nXUsu0rI56gLiZg0NH_A

Not how I like to eat my omelettes. The roasted potatoes weren't toasted at all, more like boiled and soft. Service was horrible and the food wasn't much better!

This is definitely a guilt free breakfast choice.  The hell with the Carb count.  Toss the count up to at least it had CARBLESS Blue Crabs in it!  You can walk the strip or hit the treadmill, who cares!  EAT IT, ENJOY IT! The fresh lump blue crab meat seriously came from a fat Crab.  The meat was lightly season and the dish was well proportioned.  An abundant amount of crabs.  I'm not sure if it was a biscuit or what on the bottom but hey, I ate it up. So light and yummy as well.  The hollandaise sauce was so creamy and spiced just right.  The subtle hints of roasted tomato, asparagus and spinach blended really well together!  The other flavors were indescribable so can't tell you! Nothing about me can be easy or get over so I didn't get the over easy egg.  I don't like over easy, so I opted for a well done poached egg instead! It was truly fabulous.  Oh, the restaurant itself.  Really nice, clean and inside the Delano Hotel attached to the Mandalay!",eHMb-rUCT9h4rGx1iz4TQw,0,1,5,VrBjLyP9sS_nUoDwWR6X_Q
5961917,2016-09-27,0,8SWZLawwzqwzbXpGQS7gBw,"We were staying at Mandalay Bay and we were hungry. Good food options are limited at this part of The Strip and we thought Della's Kitchen looked good for brunch. At first there were 5 of us and we were seated at a large table. Within 10 minutes, our group expanded by 3. It was great that Della's Kitchen was able to accommodate all of us.

That said, the service was really inefficient. We told the server that we were in a rush (had to get to the guestlist line at Daylight by a certain time) and he was still very slow throughout the meal. The kitchen also did not help our cause. We ordered before another table and we saw them get served before us.

I had the Blue Crab Benedict. It was alright but the sauce drowned out the delicate flavor of the crab. The server put in the wrong order for one of my friends and the way he handled the situation showed a lack of common sense. We were in a huge rush and told him this a couple of times at this point. He told my friend to put the wrong order of pancakes in the middle of the table (why?) and he walked away. We were so confused and my friend started eating the pancakes since we had no time. When the server came back, he said he put in the correct order of pulled pork benedict. My friend indicated it was ok and that given the time constraints, he was just going to eat whatever he had available at that point.

We had asked for the bill the second our food was delivered and the server took forever with that process. We ended up having to ask our one friend who wasn't going to Daylight to cover for all of us because we had to go. Also, the server still charged my friend for the wrong order of pancakes. Who charges when they are the ones who made the mistake? My friend pointed it out to him and he reluctantly agreed to take it off.

If you want decent service or want to eat anytime soon, don't go to Della's Kitchen.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,1,2,2,RTRwRyhfHMwVZy6SEN2ALA
