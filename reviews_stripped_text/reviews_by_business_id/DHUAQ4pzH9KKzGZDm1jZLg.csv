After figuring out what we wanted, I started ordering. First, they didn't have the Easter ones.... Why advertise if you don't have them. Second, he was being short and rude with me. 
We pulled up to the window and he gave me my total and then gave me the donuts. I had also asked for a drink, which he did not give me nor charge me for. Then he walked away from the window and started talking to what I'm assuming was his coworker. I was irritated so I just left. 
When we got home I was so excited to eat these donuts! Too bad he completely messed up the order. I asked for 2 custard filled, he gave me 1 whipped creme filled. I asked for 3 sprinkles donuts, he gave me 3 chocolate glazed. Thank god the rest that I asked for were original glazed because I'm sure he would've messes those up too! 
If you're going to work in customer service, 1. Make sure you pay attention when people ask for something. And 2. BE NICE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. 
I don't think I would've been as mad if he at least got me my custard doughnuts.

975037,2013-03-14,0,DHUAQ4pzH9KKzGZDm1jZLg,"So the BF decided to take my daughter and I for some fresh Krispy Kreme donuts after our St Patrick's Day 5k run last Saturday.  I know - totally defeating the purpose of a 5k run but what the heck.  Noone can believe I have never been there prior to now.  As I am not a donut girl, I was more in the mood for a bagel but decided to roll with it for this time as there was this special donut I was to be introduced to- says my BF.  Hmm.  I'm so intrigued.

As we walk in, there is a family ahead of us and immediately the lady behind the counter offers us a sample.  To me a sample is a BITE Krispy Kreme!  A BITE!  No I was handed this warm, soft, sweet, right out of the oven goodness.....mind you it was not a bite it was a whole glazed donut!  Wow what the heck now??  Eat it and leave?  No....do the right thing....order what you came here for. LOL  By now the 300+ calories I just lost by running just added that back and then some....and then out of pure nice obligation I ordered a cinnamon roll.  Tear. Guilt.  Pleasure.  As we devoured (I didnt eat the whole thing btw) the 2nd round of donuts I must say that I was quite impressed with this melt in your mouth breakfast (I guess thats what you call it). haha

The people working were very nice and helpful. How could you not be nice and sweet when you put smile on people's faces every day.  The place was clean other than the floors were super sticky....I guess that goes with the sticky sweet donuts or its just their ploy to keep you stuck there. 

While I am not a sweets girl and would much prefer a bagel, I would have to say it was the best dern donut I ever had!  There you go!  We wont be making this a 5k race tradition...just sayin.",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,2,4,fVCkSpWqxlGT8JGItSJvKw
1182820,2010-08-06,1,DHUAQ4pzH9KKzGZDm1jZLg,"There come times in everyone's life when you simply must have a doughnut.  While I normally try to eat healthy foods, sweet pastries are one of my weaknesses. I may be able to suppress the desire for months at a time, but sooner or later I cave in to the temptation.

Among my very occasional guilty pleasures, I count the original glazed, and chocolate-iced glazed doughnuts from Krispy Kreme.  Served fresh and warm, they are so soft that your fingers sink into the doughy pastry as you pull off a bite, and the sticky sugar-glaze melts in your mouth.

It's probably not possible to make a truly healthy doughnut, but Krispy Kreme has at least taken steps to make they're delicious doughnuts less unhealthy, and they've done this without compromising the taste.  Namely, Krispy Kreme has reduced the amount of trans fat in all their doughnuts to half a gram or less, which (per U.S. FDA guidelines) allows them to advertise the doughnuts as having 0 grams of trans fat.  However, bear in mind that if you have two or three doughnuts in one sitting, you're probably consuming at least a gram of trans fat, and you should know that's not healthy!  

If I rated Krispy Kreme on taste alone, I would give it five stars.  But I'm going to treat doughnut shops the same way I treat a fast-food burger joint.  Because both types of establishments have limitations on the quality of their atmosphere, service, and nutritional content, my highest rating is four stars.  So that's what my favorite doughnut shop gets.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,4,s0vLPnP72_i2DYTHDw7whg

I would have given it four stars but I just went back a day later and received horrible service. A two star at that.

The first visit was wonderful. The young gentlemen explained all the favors, pricing and let us even sample a couple options. It was my first visit to a Krispy Kreme (I know, crazy!) and he was really awesome and even gave my friend, daughter and I Krispy Kreme hats. That was really the cherry on top. When I got home I saw he gave me a free donut. Score!

The donuts were delicious and sugar inducing coma status for sure.

The next days go back and it took 10 minutes for any employees to even help us. I guess drive thru comes first. By the time they helped me there was a line with three others behind me. 

Next the lady was rude and u had to keep explaining which ones I wanted. She kept picking wrong ones even though I said the name correctly. 

Lastly when I went to check out she said it came to six bucks. I gave er my debit card and she charged my 60 bucks! She didn't even tell me she made a mistake and instead just stood their dumb founded and then went to the manager. They took forever to reverse it and then said the money would be back in my account in 7 to 10 days. Um wtf. I just don't get how someone makes that type of mistake.

Who the hell eats donuts with no napkins.  Second, the price in Vegas is like $2 more for a dozen than in Winston-Salem.  So I question whether or not that's an excise fee because the ingredients have to travel further?   I would imagine that the prices should be the same everywhere, but I guess not.  In any case, that did throw me off a little.

The line was 8-10 people long when I got there and it took about 25 minutes to be served. This was not too bad, like I said I was expecting a wait, however with only 1 staff member at the till when I first got there, which turned into 2, it seemed that for an anticipated busy day, there would be more staff available because after I arrived, the line only got longer.
Despite that, the ladies serving were lovely, smiling, asked about our day and did not let the busy day affect their rapport with the customers. I was served by the lovely Cymphony (can we take a second and appreciate the prettiest name ever!) and she got my raspberry filled glazed donut and hot cappuccino.
What I also liked about the serving process is that there is one area to choose your donuts and another to get your drinks and pay, so it's never too claustrophobic. 
The products are great! The small coffee is actually quite large (I'm British so it may just be the sizing I'm not used to) and therefore good value and the donut? Wow! I went here at 9am so just wanted to have a bite and save the rest for later but it all went! Just the right amount of glaze, the donut was soft and the best bit? The jam inside was very generous. It was full of jam and tasted amazing!

I AM EXTREMELY disappointed in Dunkin Donuts this morning. They are reported to be opened until 8 p.m.  I tried calling last night at 6:30 til 8 p.m. and again at 5 a.m. this morning. No one ever answered the phone.  At 5:20 a.m. I walked into the store and confirmed that I had the correct phone # and the employee confirmed that I did. I told him no one has been answering the phone since 6:30 last night.  I looked at the display and they barely had 1/4 of it filled.  I told him I needed a large order 25 dzn donuts (I didn't even care what kind they had available) and 25 boxes of coffee, I'd be willing to do it in smaller batches and come back throughout the morning.  He checked with the other employee and all they could do was 4 dzn and 3 boxes of coffee (even though there were 6 boxes on the shelf)  While he assembled my order, I called the next nearest location and they too couldn't fulfill my order and could only do 4 dzn and 3 boxes of coffee and she told me she too didn't even have enough because they just opened.  So instead I called Krispy Kremes and they said no problem at all, it would just take a little time to brew the coffee but that was the only issue.  I arrived in 30 minutes and other than waiting for coffee to brew they were able to fill my entire order with no problem at all, AND had no issues with the person behind me getting 4 dzn donuts .  Their displays were full and you could tell they were ready to do business unlike the empty displays at Dunkin Donuts.  I spent $500 this morning at Krispy Kremes. Dunkin Donuts is definitely not ready to play in the big leagues like the other companies.

This is the closest Krispy Kreme for us, so naturally, it has been our go to location when the mood for melt in your mouth glazed donuts strike. I have no complaints on the products, they're great especially when the lights are on and they're fresh and piping hot! They have several varieties: cake donuts, crullers, donut holes, specialty and seasonal donuts like the pumpkin spiced and of course the ever popular glazed. So good that you can never eat just one and should come with warning labels as they are very addicting!    

This particular location is very lacking when it comes to customer service though, I've had one too many undesirable experiences here. As a matter of fact, I can't recall a time when everything was just smooth sailing and didn't come across a hiccup. There's always something!

When we got there close to 10 am it wasn't busy at all with a few tables occupied and only one person ahead in line which was a relief as this place often gets crowded. As we were waiting I noticed the pumpkin spiced donut container was empty and no cake donuts on display. Before I could wonder further, the girl asked us if we were ready to order and gave us 4 samples. I told her we wanted a dozen of the pumpkin spice, even before I could finish she rudely interrupts and said they were out! I was caught off guard and repeated what she said and muttered how could you be out it's barely 10, she just shrugged with no explanation. I told her to give us a minute to pick something else, I asked if they had cake donuts and she gives me this look like I'm stupid and says ""Ummm, yeah!"" and I responded with ""Ummm how would I know they're not on display"" lol. Some guy had walked in behind us so I told him he could go ahead as we were still deciding. He declined and said he needed time as well. This girl then had the nerve to tell me and my family ""if you don't want to buy anything it's okay you can go"". So insulting! Like she was insinuating we just went there to get samples. In which I replied ""I was set on getting pumpkin spiced donuts it's not my fault you guys are out and now need a minute"". I would've made a bigger deal of it had my kids and mom not been there plus it was early and I haven't even had my coffee yet JEEEEZ! Even my son commented on how rude she was and said ""Give them ZERO stars on YELP mom! Hahahaha.

Ended up getting a dozen of assorted donuts but I was sad because I really wanted my pumpkin spice, until I remembered Mavericks carries Krispy Kreme, lo and behold they had them there and all was well again LOL.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,10,5,2,816KowlcLQK0N_hMfvpMXg

They never follow through the hot light hours they posted by the door and drive-thru (which is 5am-11am and 5pm to 10pm). Been coming back here on those hours and hot light always off. It's a waste of time and trip. Now we're stuck but to buy what they have on the shelves.

When the lady forgot my water and I politely reminded her, she scoffed at me and walked away from the window. On top of that, I asked for napkins and she practically threw them at me.

We just picked up some hot, fresh-off-the-line doughnuts at Krispy Kreme in Chinatown - dessert for the keiki!  What made it more special this time around was that they had some of their tasty treats decorated in the spirit of the holiday, Halloween!  BOO!  As always, we bought a dozen so the kids can devour them over the weekend with a few of their friends coming over tomorrow - makes for a perfect snack!

I don't know how many of you may know this, but the Krispy Kreme on Spring Mountain is also one of their doughnut factories (not all KK locations are tied to their factories here in LV).  When you see their HOT neon LIGHT on, it means that their Original Glazed doughnuts are hot off the belts!  We try to make it there around the time they have their HOT LIGHT on!  They offer a freshly made, warm, melt-in-your-mouth Original Glazed straight off the belt...FREE!  Well, it's free if you are purchasing something.  What a treat, right?!?  So far, we've known them to make fresh ones right around 11am and 5pm; I could be wrong though (about the time).

So, for anyone interested in going in to a Krispy Kreme to see, or taste, what all the hype is about, visit when the HOT LIGHT in ON!  You will be able to sample one of the most tempting, sumptuous treats your mouth has ever experienced!  I know all you Hawaii people looking to get their Krispy Kreme fix on will be there!!!  Don't forget to bring your dozens back home to your family!",xozBOvi6cWO_p1OdteF9zw,2,0,5,aMjR3I202sJfpPvc_cp5uQ

We started joking about the mistakes- the blobs that weren't properly shaped, the dough that didn't brown on both sides, etc.  One of the employees saw us and came out to join us. He was so funny, and very knowledgeable about his work. He said it takes 41 minutes to make a doughnut, and described some of the process. It's great to know your food is being made by such an enthusiastic and positive person! He made our day.

One of the ladies actually said she knew someone was going to ask her so she came prepared and handed me and my co-worker a FREE dozen doughnuts coupon! Score. Time for some melt in my mouth original glazed doughnuts! 

When I walked in, I was quickly greeted by a lady who asked if she could help me. I noticed my coupon given to me a few days prior was expired. I explained to her one of the managers came into my work and gave it to me recently. The lady said not a problem and honored my coupon. Yaay! I order a dozen original glazed doughnuts and a small vanilla iced coffee. The coffee was delicious! And I took the doughnuts to work for my co-workers because if I took them home I would eat them all haha and I'm trying to watch my weight! But the staff and I loved them. They were a huge hit! But I wasn't surprised. They are melt in your mouth delicious! 

Pros: this location has a drive thru, their hours (opens at 5:30 am), the staff was quick and friendly, free samples!, the reasonable prices, and the window used to watch the doughnuts come off the conveyor belt. 

Cons: small shop, would've liked this location to be a bit cleaner

I will never buy donuts anywhere else besides this place. Gotta have the known glaze donuts every time I come here. Not much of a chocolate or sprinkles fan, but my son sure loves all those different toppings on e'm.

I like going to this location when the light is on that the donuts are hot. They will give you one of the free glazed hot donuts if you ask for your sample!! 

Of course when you buy them hot and go out to the car your always tempted to have another!!

So gooey,light and soft & hot they are the best!! 

I don't understand why there are not more of these around town in more convenient locations. I am not always on spring mountain or wanting to go into a casino to get donuts. And I have bought in the convenient stores but just not the same! 

I am a fan of these! Nice to bring home a dozen or 2 and I freeze them pop them in the micro for a few seconds and it is like they were made fresh! 

There was only one time I remember going in this location that there was a rude girl working ever since I have not seen her. It didn't stop me from going in because of her. 
These donuts are a treat and it is not like I am having to deal with her on a daily basis if she still works there. 

I do however like a few others they make like the raspberry filled yummy!
