Had the chicken, very dissapointed, no flavor, just grease and flour taste.  Also had the red beans and rice.  Liked a lot.  One of the best teas around and they serve for the table cornbread that is made like pancakes.  Awsome!

Went another time by myself since I was in the area and remembered the good red beans and rice.  Not as good the second time around.  Tea and cornbread still awsome.  Staff was nice, good service as was time before.  And place was still very clean.

Might go back and try the breakfast, but don't know yet if I'll be back for dinner.  But would still recommend if someone were to ask for a soul food place to try.",ueCkYms5-gsobEPzfh_IwA,0,0,3,WrFY4NNaZdV92t3fJ4BWsQ

All of the food was very good; fried chicken (crispy, hot & not too greasy), catfish in cornmeal batter, red beans & rice, mac 'n cheese, greens and fried okra. Service was pleasant and quick. The servers were very friendly and helpful. We would recommend this to anyone who likes soul food. We lived in Savannah for ten years and this beats the overrated Paula Deen. Can't wait to go back for their gumbo.",-x2s15YAlhS1LBXiGjgk9A,0,0,5,44R0UQx4R9OMmTV35qrdCQ

Whenever I'm in LA I have to hit up Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. That's my gold standard. M&M is the closest thing I've found to Roscoe's. 

I ordered wings and a waffle and my brother ordered chitterlings with dirty rice and collard greens. Both of us were happy with our food. (As an appetizer they bring out fresh corn cakes.)

Service was good, too. 

Kinda dive-y and old, but it adds to the experience.",u7FLaIoCOAE7MsZ2uh-Sfg,0,0,4,uqhN6TuoCnheJQrQ75wCDA

I mean they have Kool-Aid on the menu for god's sake! All of the drinks are served in cool Mason jars. How awesome is that?!  The fried chicken is a must-get. Try dipping it in honey for an extra special treat. I drove 15 minutes out of my way to come here and I'd do it all over again.",965QDYAn8jXQ9Wj7whuHsA,1,0,4,LUI29QtCBoNY_w9SVrwJZQ
2463071,2012-02-23,0,mijapPlo4pea6Bl8faEjyQ,"I enjoyed coming to this place. Second time I've been here and let me just say it's gotta be the best fried chicken one can get. Made fresh to order so it is piping hot. Traditional soul food side items. My favorites are the fried okra and red beans and rice. One dollar up charge for white meat. Three piece with three sides and free cornbread pancakes is 14 bucks. 

Sodas with free refills are $1.50 and they even serve cool aid. Waiters and waitresses are very friendly and attentive. Look for a BOGO coupon in the Las Vegas coupon book!

We well definitely be back again!",l3-iufAUr46hmFiEanW88Q,1,0,5,YP_ZYCZVP8hGWxgR9fm6bw
4801276,2013-04-05,0,mijapPlo4pea6Bl8faEjyQ,"Well to start the correct address is 3923 Charleston and they told us they have been there 9 years. This is a gem of Southern cooking in Las Vegas. I had breakfast of 3 fried chicken wings & eggs. Served with fab home fries and the best biscuit I have ever had outside a home.
Prices were very reasonable and the service was terrific. They also serve ""sweet tea"".  You have to try this place you will be hooked.",YXkFZyUJjky19gg5qPFOww,0,0,5,1i1d50zKNlvmcEANRAotRg

I friend of mine and I went in for lunch and we both ordered the fried chicken.  It was hot, well seasoned, and delicious.  You know how at some places the chicken is either really dry or has been sitting around so the skin falls off when you eat it?  Not here, it was made fresh to order.

Side dishes were mixed.  I had the red beans and rice (delicious) and the macaroni and cheese which was bland.",bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,2,0,4,ZxLZketDotKGervlADus5w
