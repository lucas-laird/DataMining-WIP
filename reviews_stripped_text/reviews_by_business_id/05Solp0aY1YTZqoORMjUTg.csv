The beans are the worse sorry to say but they had no flavor and they just didn't appear fresh .  Also I ordered an horchata assuming it was the traditional Salvadorian kind, but it was the Mexican white rice version and it tasted like it was store bought mix . The platanos con frijoles :( not good. It's the beans, they ruin the whole thing. I only ate the bean pupusas but my family had a few different kind and they didn't like it either for the same reason.  The food needs more flavor even the cortido.",J2pvQRBExBaXEe3gfLylnQ,0,0,2,pGDo7rg40lnhaxHI4kJ0Rg

I had the cheese pupusa with zucchini and oh boy!! So yummy and they're large! Both my hubby and I had one each. We basically had breakfast for 2 and spent under $5.00! Now that's a win!!",L7mHvgViTUAK1SFOLndKUw,0,0,4,EunOJNHEyIMgu3k4hjs-Bg

The el salvadoranien  food was authentic and tasty. We didn't try anything else. We got many pupusas tamales and the breakfast plate. It was yummy and all about 20 bucks.",Pg-sMoiilKCVPs41vf5V_Q,1,0,5,ILi_TKGNYgowUWJuu2DKwg

When we asked why since they weren't bottled water they stated it was because of the lemons in the water. It took them four times to try and add up the total and we're still complaining about refunding our three dollars for the tap water they charged. The way out, our server as well as the others were real rude by saying ""well if you don't like our Salvadorian food go eat somewhere else where they give you free water"" (they said it in Spanish). Save your money and headaches and DO NOT COME HERE!",rJSVEZkitmgEt0rPQEuzWQ,4,0,1,8Aptfb3CcGbgGhGhzxUmaw

We had to wait a little bit but it was worth it, clearly the wait was for it being made fresh. So delicious, we will definitely be returning customers.",8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q,0,1,5,D8Yjl5SAeDz1Ki2msRNAjQ
