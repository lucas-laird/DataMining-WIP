First thing you notice is that it's pretty darn clean for a BBQ joint and it was packed for a week day.  That's always a good sign.

Cutting it short. Everything from service to quality of meats, and banchan was TOP GRADE and  flavorful.  Most places don't even give you bean soup anymore or really stingy w/ the banchan.  

The waiter made it clear that he was cooking the meat for us and all we had to do was enjoy and that we did!  And a shave ice dessert to end it all.

We will most definitely be coming back here on our next trip to Vegas!  Thanks TOMMY for an amazing meal and service!",EiSdTjwv9RwFyhC08nMcgQ,1,0,5,943rG1PVLgfXi7au1CHUeg

2 people combo (size S) is good enough for 2 people. But when it comes to size L which is for 3-4 people, the portion is very little! It's almost same size as size S. It was very frustrating because the price was almost twice. We had to order 2 more a lar carte menu cuz we were still hungry! And the server tried to make a joke like we were very hungry. Wt*.

We had a party of 8 and were sat in a nice exclusive back room. Our servers name was David. I highly recommend that you request him if he is available. He never let our drinks get empty and was very helpful throughout the entire night. A big plus was the music selection. It brought a great vibe to the room. The food was prepared by David and cooked by him to absolute perfection. We decided on 2 small beef pairings and 2 small pork pairings and for 8 people it was more than enough food. We finished off the dinner with shrimp that was absolutely amazing. I've been to several all you can eat K BBQ joints. This is the first non-AYCE K BBQ place I've been to and I would most certainly come back. One of the perks of this place is being able to make a reservation which is very rare at restaurants in China Town. I will definitely be coming back in the near future!

No problem with the wait - we arrived close to midnight and they close at 1:00. Ordered beef combo for 4 and spicy beef soup. We got banchan and japchae first. I started serving the japchae and our waitress goes ""You didn't order that!"" in an accusing scolding voice. (Like we grabbed it took it from someone?!) then she just shook her head and walked away. Meat arrived and was great but didn't get rice. When I asked, she asked how many. I asked for 5 because there were 5 of us. She brought 3 and said that's all they had. (??). They never asked once if we needed anything. Apparently, from other reviews, we were supposed to get dessert. We never did. Last straw - I asked for the bill, and she was just so rude, the way she tossed it in our table. Even my husband was mad at that point (and he NEVER gets mad). Told me not to leave any tip. I've never done this, but I left only 10% with a note saying ""worst service."" I'm 100% Korean, visiting, and will be in vegas often with a child here in college.

488398,2017-09-22,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"First time eating at Magal, and I must say I was very unimpressed all the way round. 

Food was average and the service was below average. 
I'm used to having to wait for long periods for a good kbbq, but this place was not worth the long wait. 

First off, there was 9 of us in our party and they informed us they could not seat us all together or we would have to wait about 2 hours. So we split our group and waited about 30-40 mins. Upon seating I noticed there was a long table, which was empty and could've easily sat our entire party. Maybe 30 mins into our meal a large party of 6 or 7 walks in and is seated at this table maybe 10-15 mins after (they also don't take reservations, or that's what they told us when we called in advanced). Strike 1.

Service seemed very chaotic and unorganized, especially our server in particular. It took quite awhile once we were seated to even get water and asking for refills was another waiting game in itself. Once getting our food, our server was dropping things left and right. Dropping food/dishes all over the table to tipping over our water and getting it into our side dishes. Strike 2. 

Strike 3 was the food itself. I had really high hopes for this place, especially for the amount you're paying since it's a la carte! I did not find the meats to be the quality meats they claim to be and the seasoning/marinade to be nonexistent. The meats lacked flavor.

Doubt I will be going back.",FXqZ66RyoTZ6O4gMFl9pNg,1,0,2,W9S0Km2tka4jzcUWaNNISA

820418,2016-06-17,2,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Before I get started with my review let me say that it is unfair to compare any Korean restaurant in Vegas to the L.A. standard. I see this done on a regular basis, and it is quite frustrating. 5 star restaurants are knocked down to 4 or 3 stars, and the resultant review is skewed. Restaurants in yelp reviews are to be judged relative to the market in which they exist. In this case, the market is Las Vegas. Let us keep this in mind guys and gals. Just as it is ridiculous to evaluate a burger spot in South Korea on the same scale as a burger spot in the United States, it is ridiculous to make the same comparisons between a Korean restaurant in Vegas' small Korean community to a Korean restaurant in L.A. with its massive Korean population that is about 10 times larger. Of course, the L.A. equivalent will be better due to the increased demand and competition. This is common sense, and is not something that needs be taken into account for the rating. If you really want to make some comparison to L.A., express it in a written comment, not the rating. 

For The Review:

Magal is ahead of its time in the Vegas KBBQ scene, and it heightens expectations of what  Korean BBQ should be. There is no point in comparing this establishment with an AYCE Korean BBQ. They are simply on different levels in terms of food quality, service, and atmosphere. Magal takes it to the next level in these regards. The food quality is in the elite level. All of the meat is fresh and never frozen. The seasoning is just right as well. None of that overly salty or bland garbage that they eventually serve at the AYCE KBBQ spots around Vegas. 

For example, how many KBBQ places do you know that provide mouthwash in the restroom for their patrons to freshen up with after dinner? Perhaps an even better question is: how many public restrooms have you been in smell better than your own room does? Magal's restroom does. They burn scented candles in the restroom, and provide Crest mouthwash and mini cups to pour it in. Ladies & Gents, this is the definition of next level shit right here. 

One will only experience excellence when dining at Magal. Alex's dedication to constant improvement and customer satisfaction sets this eatery apart from its competitors. We first arrive at the establishment, and he hears my friend joke that I was a picky eater, so he personally cooks our entire meal to ensure that we have nothing but the best experience. Further, the establishment provides innovative features such as service call buttons on all of its tabletops to provide that next level service to their patrons. The outstandingly bright and friendly staff of Magal outshines the competition on a multitude of levels, setting a new standard for customer service to serve as a proper role model for other Korean BBQs to sheepishly follow. Magal brings a tried and tested experience directly from Korea to the Las Vegas streets of China Town. Eating at Magal is taking part in the revolution unfurling in the Korean dining industry right here in Vegas. Don't be left behind.",0huYaIV2xkZztipzLBydcg,5,4,5,cKNTbmYkDWrxkffdRO8LVQ

1187876,2017-07-30,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"I haven't been to many Korean BBQ places in the US, so I don't have a backlog of American style KBBQ to fall back on, but I've been to quite a few BBQ places in South Korea and with that in mind, this place was GOOD.

That said, this is not a US style place.  If you're expecting an American experience, don't look here.  There will be raw egg cooking at your table and the server will be handling your food and cooking it.  Neither of these things are unusual in Korea, where the server often cooks for you, and raw food shows up in lots of different forms to be cooked at your table.  You'll probably also have to ask for things (more to drink, more sauce, etc.), it won't necessarily be replenished without asking.  There's even a button on your table to get prompt service, which is just like all the restaurants I've been to in SK.  Don't hesitate to push it (it's not rude) and ask for what you need instead of waiting for someone to notice, because you might be forgotten.

The samgyupsal (pork belly) is incredible.  We also got the beef combo and everything in it was *outstanding*.  I looove doenjang chigae (fermented soybean paste soup) and it was amazing.  The banchan was all to die for except that the kimchi was a bit young for my taste (I like it old and ripe!), but that would be my only complaint.  They even had the green onion salad with gochujang that I haven't had since I was in Korea.  The Cass beer and soju were both delicious as well.

Overall, if you're looking for a very authentic experience without a lot of concern for American sensibilities (we were the only white people there), check this place out.  If you're going to be weirded out by hot tea in plastic cups and raw egg cooking at your table, this place isn't for you!

But do go and try it out.  My god, it was incredible.  I haven't had Korean food this authentic since actually being in Korea.  It was just so, so good.  I can't say enough good things about it.",zWm1Tu6aj6cssqeGv5e0Jw,3,1,5,D75y5IZubYBLOsiYSKX0iA

Also normally when we come the waiter/waitress is pushy about them cooking the meat for you but we just told them right away when we came that we wanted to cook the meat and they were totally cool with it and just came over to change our grill out like most Korean BBQ places here in Vegas. 
For sure will keep coming back but I might call ahead of time to check that they have the volcano rice since I was looking forward to that.

I really don't need to say more than this but here are some details for you ""reading""-type Yelpers. 

Ended up going here THREE times during the latest Vegas trip.  Tried the beef combo, lunch specials and the volcano fried rice. Why? 
- Food was good. 
- Excellent portions with tons of side dishes. 
- They'll replace the sides if you ask. 
- Service was on point. From the greeting to cooking the meats and fried rice at the table. 
- Prices were reasonable.  
- Ample parking space.
- TVs everywhere. 
- Kid friendly. Yes, I was in Vegas w/ a 3 year old.

Just to be a bit objective and prepare those who are K-BBQ virgins, here are some distractions. 
- This is not AYCE. 
- There will be times when the music will be blasting fast, K-pop music. 
- ALL servers will appear like they're serving ALL the tables communicating on their walkies and ""streamlining"" the service. 
- Just because they're speeding around doesn't mean you have to.  Sit down and enjoy the food. 

Last bit of advise:
- Drink the tea (hot or cold)
- Get the shaved ice dessert.",1TTD3SfAesKP6twPKiuc2Q,0,0,5,xfYg4YvjVHni-lJ3XlMALQ
1438122,2016-08-22,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"I remember watching this location being built for the longest time ... then saw it sitting there empty with the lights on for even longer... i was like wtcrap are they ever gonna open? then they did :3 Recently, there has been a decent amount of places opening offering higher quality a la carte style kbbq (Hobak & Goong) in the city and this was the last of the few places that opened. 

Came here for dinner on a Sunday evening and the place was almost filled before 7pm. Yeah my bad it was on a weekend oops Lol Luckily there was a table open and we were sat at our table in like 10 minutes. 

They offer a few combos as well as other a la carte items you can order as well. 

Pork combo (Small $47.99 Large $79.99) which includes pork skirt meat, tenderized pork belly, special pork neck, marinated pork collar OR spicy marinated pork skirt meat, assorted grilled (prawns, mushroom, and pineapple), boneless short rib sushi, and soybean paste soup with beef brisket

Beef combo (Small $54.99 Large $89.99) which includes beef skirt meat, paper thin sliced prime brisket end-point, prime boneless short rib OR prime beef rib-eye, marinated prime short rib, assorted grilled (prawns, mushroom, and pineapple), boneless short rib sushi, and soybean paste soup with beef brisket

Skirt meat combo (Small $54.99 Large $89.99) which includes beef skirt meat, pork skirt meat, spicy marinated pork skirt meat, assorted grilled (prawns, mushroom, pineapple), boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup with beef brisket

As we were only a group of two, we opt'ed for the small beef combo. Service was pretty good. Side dishes were presented as soon as we sat down. They were refilled also as soon as they disappeared, and same for the water. Lots of banchan. Kimchi, two types of salad, pancake, marinated celery, a cold soup with i think acorn jelly, corn salad and egg in the grill ring (more on this later). 

First came the boneless short rib sushi. Presented on top of formed sushi rice balls, the server takes a torch to cook the top of the meat. After they put a light sweet sauce over it. Purely entertainment value Lol. The sauce was much lighter than i expected. Though the meat was tender, it would be expected when its sliced so thin i hope 

Brisket and rib-eye were cooked on a flat plate whereas the marinated short rib and beef skirt meat was cooked on a rack. Brisket and rib-eye were both unmarinated and were on the chewier side. Despite eating them before it was overcooked. The marinated short rib and beef skirt meat were pretty tender and not too heavy on the marinade. Would prefer slightly lighter flavor though. The ""grill"" itself was made of probably a cast iron with a ring outside for a prepared mixture of chopped kimchi and egg, and corn salad. It took quite a while for the egg to be done but once it was done, it went overcooked fast ! Entertainment value? yeah. looks nice to have a ring but i think i rather prefer it in the normal earthenware like the soup. Think i would have preferred if they had mozarella cheese in the ring like this chicken galbi i had in seoul vs the egg. XD hmmmm i miss that T_T 

I wanted to order the volcano fried rice they had but it requires a minimum of 2 orders and we were only 2 people so no way we would have been able to finish it. Maybe another time :3 

They have us two bite sized cheesecakes as a ""Dessert"" at the end. Hmm... Lol 

As mentioned in the beginning, this was the last of the few new places that opened. I had previously tried the others and i prefer the other 2 over this place. Besides it being a la carte, i couldn't really tell the higher quality for the price in comparison to other restaurants. If anything, quality was similar to some AYCE's =3 

Ventilation is quite bad despite it being a newly built building and i dont think their AC was working as they had a swamp cooler right next to us...

They close at 3am and open at 11am, 7 days a week. In case anyones curious. I don't see it on the yelp site yet.

This is a different experience from the normal KBBQ around town.

We ordered the small bbq combo. Quite pricey, but if you cut it in half, it's about the same price as AYCE, almost. The price includes service, I'm assuming. That's the catch, instead of you cooking, they cook for you. They're extremely attentitive, so you don't have to worry about over/undercooked.

At first glance, the grill has some corn and some soupy like liquid something on the side. That soup is actually egg, which gets cooked while they're cooking the meat. The side grill is a cooling rack.

The meat is different in quality compared to other KBBQ places. I wasn't sure what was being served/cooked, so I can't really tell you what tastes like what. Overall, the meat tastes amazing. It's tender and they cook it to medium rare. The main difference, to me, is the marinate. There's something about it that makes it taste... great and different.

If you are here expecting ayce, go back to the strip and go to a buffet.  Quality does reign supreme here and quantity comes at a close second.  

Immediately when you sit, you get the Korean soju house creamed corn, and an egg dish that cooks as you eat.  I did the gogi combo and I was a bit hesitant that this little tea sandwich contraption was going to fill me up but I am seriously about to give birth to an 8lb baby because I am so full.

 If you make it to the end, get ready to have a server make the fried rice with egg dish.  Not too sure what it is? I'm not going to explain so you can order it and fall into the line of regretting of eating too much.  

This place is good and the quality of the meat really shows.

The food was delectable. I usually judge a Korean restaurant based off of their side dishes and they have phenomenal kimchi. We ordered the beef combo which was definitely enough to feed two. My favorite meat was the kalbi. It was marinated to perfection and melts in your mouth. The combo came with soy bean paste soup, which I normally hate because of the unpleasant smell, but their soup made me have a change of heart. I love they change the grill after every meat so it doesn't build up with char.

1772190,2017-08-02,5,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Giving 2 stars to Magal really pains me. I've been to Magal three times now. If I had rated this place based on my first two visits, I would've given this place 5 stars hands down. But alas, third time is not the charm. The service was just too awful.

My boyfriend and I went on Monday night, and the place was pretty packed. (But I've also gone on Saturday night with no issues with service.) We were seated within a reasonable time frame. Banchan and tea were brought to our table relatively quickly. The waitress took our order.......and that was where it all went downhill. The employees typically cook your meat for you, but our waitress ended up being so awful that we ended up cooking the food for ourselves.

We had to ask for banchan refills twice. And water twice. And we even had to ask for rice--from the bus boy (who was super fast about it). Every time the waitress came over to flip over our meat, we had to ask for things. She would say ok, and then forget all about it. The other two times I was here, the waiter asked us if we wanted rice right away when the first meat dish was cooked. She totally forgot about it. C'mon, we're Asians. We need our rice.

She torched the beef sushi like she had a grudge against it--so it was really overcooked. For the other meat dishes, she kept insisting that our meat was ready, but it wasn't. I typically eat medium rare to rare meat, but her idea of ""ready"" was way too raw for me. She even laughed that the grill wasn't getting hot enough--and that the previous people at our table couldn't even eat the egg moat because it never cooked.  That's not cool. If the table isn't functioning properly, don't seat someone there. Fix the issue, then use the table.

Towards the end of the meal, we took things into our own hands and cooked the rest of the food by ourselves. Our waitress had the balls to cut up the pieces of pineapple we had cooking on the grill--after we had cooked everything else by ourselves. Honestly, I don't even remember her ever asking if we were doing okay.

I have no complaints about the food. The quality of their meat is great. (I want to say the wonky grill on the third visit contributed to the overcooked brisket, but that's a mechanical issue--not the food.) To be honest, I've only gotten the beef combo here because it's that good. Banchan is great as well.

I'm hesitant to come back to Magal because this last visit was just so awful. I typically don't call out the employee if I had a negative experience -- but I spoke to a friend who also experienced poor service here, and we seem to have gotten the same employee. So if you get an older, middle-aged Korean lady with glasses, I suggest running the other way.

1776288,2017-10-24,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Every time I make it to Vegas, this is the place I go to for Korean BBQ.  It is fairly priced, but not cheap.  Meat is of high quality, so the price is appropriate. Average beef dish is in the high $20s to $30s.  Their combo meat deal (beef or pork) for two people is well worth it; $99 for two people.  It is actually a very good deal to get the combo, which comes with all of the most popular cuts of meat (and a token shrimp). 

The service is always attentive and the wait during peak times might be up to 45 minutes.  I try to go during off-peak hours and there usually is no wait.  Servers grill the meat for you and they know what they are doing; meat comes out just right, but if you prefer it cooked more then you should state your preference.

 Btw, their herbal drink that comes complementary with the meal is so refreshing! There is no need to order a drink if you can have that awesome tea.",Fz-G69gvVHMHY-qN_IvnAQ,1,0,5,r9NMfOVa7YGsoVHd3VcwHA

It also had seared short rib sushi which they torch in front of you. I felt that the short rib sushi looked cooler than it tasted. The combo was more than enough food for us two without walking out feeling bloated. Could be enough for 3 people. We didn't even finish the last meat or the prawns towards the end. The meats tasted good (def better than meats at ayce KBBQ) but it was too fatty. Especially the brisket and kalbi. Probably the best thing in the beef combo was the boneless short ribs because it wasn't as fatty. The meat quality and cuts are better & actually worth the price at Hobak & Goong. They'll cook and cut the meats for you , dinner was still about 1.5 to 2 hours long. I'll probably try other a la carte items like the volcano fried rice or lunch specials next time.

I understand if its busy, but when you have hungry guests in the queue looking at empty tables, they're obviously going to get frustrated which was what was happening with a lot of people waiting around me. I was in a party of 2 and still waited close to an hour with empty tables. The hostess was super young and didn't have the voice or presence to call parties to their ready tables or tell them they needed to wait longer. After finally getting seated, the table was already pre-set with side dishes which was great. The biggest complaint I have from my experience was the smoke - the ventilation was super weak and the way the air conditioning was set up made the smoke from the grill blow directly in my face.

First time here and had a great experience. My family (5 of us) ordered the large beef combo and small pork combo and that was a ton of food! We also wanted to get the seafood pancake and volcano fried rice but our waitress told us that she will hold off on the fried rice in case we got too full, which was nice of her. But they forgot about our seafood pancake, we never got it but that was fine since everyone was stuffed. 

Love the sides, they have different sides than most places. The tofu tasted really good, the salad had a delicious dressing, all veggies were so fresh. The kimchi was really good too, not to vinegary much better than other places. The meats were delicious, so tender and juicy. Each combo came with a soup and it was really good, I was stuffed but couldn't stop eating the soup. The dessert was really interesting, like shaved ice but very fine and snow-like, with the red bean on top which was really good.

I really liked our server, the efficiently cooked our meat without rushing us or being around too much. At other places they throw all our meats on the grill and moved so quick I felt pressured to eat quickly and get out, other places crowd you and were over attentive which can make the meal very annoying. Our server was perfect, he was around so we could ask for more sides, re-filled our drinks in a timely manner, and cooked our meat perfectly. 

The con is the vent! The vent was huge but was so high up it did nothing, I sat in the middle and got ALL of the smoke in my face! Left the place smelling pretty delicious lol.

After we have ordered our food and when the meat arrived, the waitress told us not to touch the meat being cooked since she has to do it. But because the high chair has to be located in the walkway, we had to keep moving our baby away to make room for her. 

To avoid this continuous back and forth movement of the high chair, I placed my son on my lap. Then, the next thing happened: hot boiling soup bowl placed right in front of my son and I. And the guy just walks away as if it is alright to place something boiling in reach of a baby. Of course we quickly moved the bowl as far as we can from my son. 

Next up was the blow torch to sear the meat. The plate that was used to sear the meat was placed in front of my son and I. The waitress blasts away with the flame toward my son and I. I told her immediately to stop and to do it some place else because the torch show wasn't worth getting a severe burn on either of us. 

Finally, the metal oil container that was located inside the ventilator caused the last issue. The container was located right above myself and it suddenly dropped to our plates. Luckily nothing was inside the container and no one got hurt. But if that metal container was full of whatever it was supposed to contain, some of us could have been seriously injured. 

I asked for the manager on site to address these issues and the guy who placed the hot bowl in front of us comes and says he is the manager. The guy told us 20% discount has been applied for the ""inconvenience"" that happened during our visit, as if money takes care of everything.

I really enjoyed the brisket and the marinade on the galbi was on point! To top it off, our waitress Dabin was so nice and attentive!

The lights around the area kinda bothered me but I guess it made up for a good Instagram shot.

I went with the beef combo with pork belly. All the meats tasted great and I had no complaints. I kinda did expect the beef brisket to not be hard frozen when they served it to us since we're paying a higher price. The beef sushi was only okay. The bachan was kinda non existent. Only kimchi, pickled celery, and some salad with bland corn dressing. 

I had one huge disappointment.... They're corn isnt cheese corn!!! It was corn with cream or mayonnaise. 

The soup they give with their meal was delicious and spicy! I really enjoyed that after my meal. 

Also, 

I'll maybe return if they change their speakers. The music sounds horrid with the speakers they're using. Felt like my ears were bleeding eating next to one.",w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg,4,4,3,D2oujDlabpfIOchOug0k0g

They offer this cold Korean soup as a side which is a first for me at Korean restaurants and it was yummy. Weird that it's cold but yummy. They also offer this taro tea as well. The grill is super small which is annoying. The salad is not the typical salad u get at Korean bbq places. Didn't like it.

We ordered the beef combo, cold buckwheat noodle, and the volcanic fried rice between the two of us (it is a lot of food but we wanted to try them all). When you go to a Korean restaurant, first thing I do is try all of the side dishes (usually side dishes come out first). From that, you can tell whether the food is going to be good. I really liked their ""mook"" soup, korean gelatin in cold broth. It sounds weird but it is very good. All of the side dishes tasted good and I had high expectations. 

The beef combo came with several different kinds of specialty meat, meat nigiri (which they torch up in front of you), shrimp and vegetables. Every single meat was good quality and delicious, despite the fact that I had to eat everything well done . The cold buckwheat noodle was very good as well, it was a bit sweeter than I'd like it to be. The volcanic fried rice is a must try, it's very entertaining to watch how they prepare it. 

Lastly, service was amazing, they came by right on time to cook everything perfect and nothing was burnt.

However, that was probably the only thing we were served that was not completely demolished. The meat and complimentary sides are delicious alone the cheese overpowered the taste of the meats but was just right with the grilled mushrooms. All of the different flavors to go with the delicious tender meat is indescribable.

My boyfriend and I chose the small beef combo. I did not expect having THAT much banchan!!! The portions were generous too.  I loved that we had both cold soup & hot soup. OH! And the barley tea!!!! Such a big deal for me because I haven't had that since I was a little girl when my mom used to make it so it was like going down memory lane each sip 

The only thing I would change is the pace of the servers cooking the food. I think it should be slowed down a few notches just so my belly can digest the food before the next round... but that minor detail was lack of communication on my part. Also, some of the meats could have more flavor to differentiate a little more from each other. 

Other than that, the service here was great from the time we walked in the door, with warm greetings, our cups kept full, tending to our grill, and left with full tummies! (David is a great server! )

I'd have to say, it was a great cheat night. Although it still does not take the #1 spot in my favorite Korean BBQ spots in Vegas, it has stolen #2's spot from *ahemGOONGahem*. (Which booted that to #3) lol

Hubs and I ordered the beef dinner for 2. So much fooooood. We literally had to get the last two beef choices cooked and packed to go. I think it was all the Japchae we had along with our banchan. The beef sushi was a cool experience. Pretty good too, with an A1 flavor sauce base. I loved all the meats I was able to have before becoming full. The egg/kimchi moat is such a clever idea.

2870706,2018-04-09,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Magal BBQ is a great Korean BBQ restaurant especially if you want to take a break from cooking the KBBQ themselves. They are a franchise that originated from Korea. This place is not AYCE, but their combos for two are usually enough to fill us up. You can order a la carte as well. 

The grill has corn around the edge, along with some egg mixture that eventually cooks as your meat is being cooked on the grill. It tastes good, but I assume it's often forgotten. The quality of meat is better than your average AYCE place. 

Service this time around was great. It wasn't too busy around the evening time, and our server was cooking the meat and checking up on us in a very timely manner. The meat wasn't over cooked and we weren't forgotten!",1iBkIyXBHhUd_4TAzXr--Q,0,0,5,fb7DqJkw5oLN_FbwKOVfkQ

Going in, it smelled great and we were excited to try a new Korean BBQ place. But --things went downhill FAST. We were sat quickly since it wasn't crowded. We were almost immediately ready to order. The waitress took our order (a meat combo, volcano rice, and the table side seared short rib) The waitress told us NOT to order the volcano rice because she can only do it at the end of our meal?! (Made no sense) she was obviously lazy and didn't want to prepare it. Whatever. We obliged since we were hungry. 

If I overheard my employee down selling tables, I'd be enraged. 

Upon sitting down, the grill had side bowls of a a mayonnaisey corn salad and unidentifiable sauce. We later found out it was egg. It didn't look or seem like eggs because it never cooked! It was a soupy raw egg mess. I'm not a fan of salmonella, so we didn't even touch it. 

She put our first beef dish on the grill and unenthusiastically pushed it around. She wouldn't let us flip the meat so it would evenly cook. She announced that the first course was ready to eat. It wasn't. It wasn't rare, it was gray and raw. 

Repeat x2 with the rest of our meal. The waitress even turned off our grill before we were done! They weren't even close to closing time! So rude. 

We made it though, picking at what looked tolerable, 
and left asap... so we can go home and eat good food!

The food was loaded with MSG too. I left itchy and sneezing. I had maybe 5 bites of food. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. They even serve their HOT tea in plastic highball soda cups! Gross. 

We were also never offered the included dessert, which was fine by us. It probably would've been melted ice cream or worse. 

Never again. So disgusted. There are too many great Korean BBQs to waste time going here.",UUVbV8XmTzNksBOPaiO3pA,9,1,1,fjD01S19Xx3NHlWMsBx2SA

The sesame oil plus salt combo is gold. This is my favorite sauce combo for korean BBQ meats.

Prime and short rib were good.

I thought the beef sushi was weird. Teriyaki sauce was on it.

The side dishes were a bit lacking. I didn't see too much besides kimchi that I liked. I really wanted potatoes or the fish cake!

3 pieces of boneless short rib
2 grilled prawns 
2 pieces of pineapple and a few pieces of mushroom
4 pieces of boneless short rib sushi
soybean paste soup with beef brisket
skirtmeat 
brisket
2 smores at the end of the meal

Besides from Hobak, I don't think I've ever had non AYCE kbbq. I'm from LA where AYCE kbbq joints are all over town but Magal is definitely a new favorite of mine. The quality and service is there, and you can leave without 1) smelling like you've been soaking in smoke and 2) content. The boneless short rib was definitely my favorite, it sort of just melted in my mouth! I passed on the prawns and soybean paste soup because I was too full but I did enjoy everything else. The short rib sushi is blow torched in front of you, which is pretty cool.

I wasn't too fond of the egg on the outside of the grill. Don't let it overcook, I felt like ours was and it wasn't very good. I think I would have preferred to order steamed egg in its own bowl separately. Side dishes were good, they tasted fresh AND, the kimchi wasn't super fermented which is how I like it! I enjoyed the refreshing soup they gave each person at the beginning as well. Its a chilled soup, and is a bit sour. However, I didn't like the almond like gelatin at the bottom of the soup. 

At AYCE places, you cook your own meat so it was really weird to be having someone else cook our meat and cut it for us. But I like how they start off with brisket and then put on a new grill for the rest of the meat. I didn't like that the grill had holes so our garlic kept falling through the holes. If you want garlic, put it on with the brisket in the beginning! 

I didn't try the smores at the end but my friends said that they would have preferred graham crackers instead of the rice crackers (?) that they offered.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,1,4,i0byS4culErkb2yeqgiocw

*This is not an ayce kbbq joint

Came here during Thanksgiving weekend with the fam, and initially when we got there, it didn't look very busy. There were several empty tables, but it still took us about 15 minutes to get seated. Shortly after we got seated, however, the entire restaurant was filled, and it was a madhouse in there. 

We got the beef combo which included brisket, rib eye, and prime rib, and we also received some kind of beef sushi where they sear it in front of us. I thought it was wagyu or kobe beef, but it wasn't. The food was alright, but for some reason, the quality of the meat seems to be better at the Magal in LA. I think I've just been spoiled with really good Korean BBQ in LA that I automatically assume anything KBBQ is just better in LA. 

Our server was really rude initially, probably due to my family's demanding requests for more banchan, but she definitely mellowed out throughout the course of the night. We were growing impatient due to our banchan barely getting re-filled, but she apologized saying that the kitchen was short staffed tonight and that they're really backed up. She also mentioned that she couldn't fry the rice at the end, because again, they were short on staff members, and it would just back up the service even more. Understandable but what a bummer, because I was looking forward to the fried rice.

Parents came to Vegas for 4th of July and they said they wanted to try this place out because they saw it in the Korean newspaper in LA/OC. 

I had no issues getting a reservation for four on July 4th weekend. My parents were feeling extra saucy and we ordered a ton of food. We ordered the beef combo, Haemul Pajeon (sea food pancake), mool naeng myun (cold noodles), and bibim naeng myun (spicy cold noodles). 

Honestly, everything here was on point. The banchan was bomb, the beef quality was amazing (check the marbling on the beef), and the noodles were pretty good. My mom was saying that they used some sort of black sesame dressing on their salads which makes it amazingly healthy. My parents said this is probably the best Korean bbq place they have had and this is after going to all the KBBQ spots in LA/OC such as Gen, All That BBQ, Byul Daepo, Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, Mo Ran Gak, Cham Sut Gol, Shik Do Rak, Quarters, etc for years/decades. If there is a Korean BBQ spot in OC/LA, my family has been there and we have probably terrorized them with our fat asses. My parents were so impressed with the location, they were considering coming back again on the same weekend to try different dishes. 

The only draw back to this place is that it is not AYCE and things can be very pricey. In addition, their doenjang jjigae (soybean stew) was meh and pretty salty. I would like to also warn everybody that it does get noisy in here. They greet and de-greet everyone very loudly. There might be a few negatives here, but the food is pretty damn good.

When it comes to Korean BBQ I typically check for 3 things: 

-how good is their brisket
-do they have good brisket sauce aka ponzu sauce 
-is it all you can eat 

Magal has 2 of the 3. Unfortunately you won't find an all you can eat service here. Typically if you don't, you usually find that the meat quality is a lot better. So don't let that stop you from coming here. 

My girlfriend and I ended up getting the Small Beef Combo, which comes with an assortment of meats. I was a bit hesitant getting this because I felt like these combo plates don't fill me up. Man, was I wrong! The Beef Combo had just enough meat that it made my girlfriend and I pretty full. The meat quality was amazing! Every time I took a bite out of the meat after dipping in on their amazing house ponzu sauce was incredible! I only wished there was more brisket on the plate just because I can eat Korean brisket all day! Perhaps it would be great if we can sub out one of the meats out for more brisket? 

The environment there is great! It's nice and clean with plenty of room for you and your friends. They also have a party room in the back where you can have huge parties to enjoy some great quality food. 

The service there is amazing! Friendly staff who takes their time cooking for you and even sparking up a conversation or two. One of the serves Young is one of their best! I was surprised when he still remembered my girlfriend and I when we stopped by the second time. He made us feel welcome and very helpful when we needed assistance or any questions we may have. Even though I feel we don't need to, the servers there will stop by and cook your food for you. You can choose if you want to or not but I feel like with them cooking, they'll always 1) make sure your food is cooked properly and 2) always checking in to make sure you guys are alright. Imo, ask for Young when you come by. Man deserves a raise! 

Overall, I had an amazing experience here! I said I would definitely come back and I already did. And I will be visiting again. This place easily became my favorite Kbbq spot here in Vegas!",e26A9THXFqQnnmc90BvMAw,5,0,5,5tAvAunIbTeJ207Hn8GcpA

I've only ordered the combos during my two visits, but you can also order a-la-carte. Both times, I went with one other person, and finishing the combos was a struggle since they give you so much food! 

I also really enjoy the unique grill, with its outer egg/corn rim and side rack for cooked food. I haven't seen similar grills in other Korean barbecue places. 

Service is friendly, and the waiters/waitresses do the cooking for you, so will check on you regularly. The complimentary cold tea is refreshing, and on my second visit, they were giving free small bowls of shaved ice at the end of the meal too. Banchan dishes aren't too numerous, but they taste great and suffice considering the bountiful offering of meat, and come with the standard unlimited refills.

It's reasonably priced if you want better quality meat than the AYCE places. We got the beef combo for two people ($60) - YUMMMM.

You get a good amount of sides - including soup and the standard banchan. 

The servers cook the meat for you, which I usually am not the biggest fan of because sometimes it can be awkward. Our server though was so quick and efficient, it didn't feel weird at all.

I dip everything in their sauce! 

As for the service, it's always a 50/50. Usually they're just doing their job. No complaints but nothing special to be all happy about either! The servers just walk around and flip your meat and cook it all for you, then move on to their next table and do the same. So don't expect a conversation with the server lol. They're just doing their job. But if you go around lunch time, they're not extremely busy so they usually take their time and talk to us then. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite KBBQ places! It definitely is pricey so don't expect to spend under 40 bucks for a full meal unless you get an extremely small portion of something at lunch!

Service was a bit on the slow side since they only had like 3 poor staff serving everyone in the restaurant.  Our server was busy flipping meat for 3 tables in a row, which I felt was a bit stretched even if you're trying to save on labor.

Meat cuts are fresh and delish; next time I'd skip everything and just get marinated skirt meat, as that's what they're known for.  Everything else is really good too, but I just like the skirt cut so much I regret getting the combo.  Side dishes are authentic too, as well as the soju.

We recently decided we want to try as many restaurants in Chinatown as possible (something you'd think I would have made a goal long ago!) and after a gym session on an errand-filled day this past weekend we stopped in at Magal.

The first thing I told my BF when we decided to go was that I usually had KBBQ w/my Korean friends back in LA and that I speak and read exactly zero Korean, so I hoped that if we had any questions someone would be able to help us - and they totally were. I actually found it funny that I had made that comment to him once we got there and realized how helpful and friendly the server and host were. 

We both ordered the beef combo as it seemed like the best value and simplest for us having been there for the first time (it was my BF's first time having KBBQ at all). The variety that came with the selection was perfect! We asked our server a lot of questions (Mickie) and she was so helpful and polite the entire time. When we were selecting drinks, I knew I had tried some Korean alcohols in the past but I couldn't remember what was what. Our server saw me Googling names from the menu and started explaining to me what everything was. Then she told us to come with her and walked us to where the drinks were and explained everything. It really felt just like being at a restaurant with a friend who's helping you decide and try whatever you want. Then of course I was asking about every little dish, some of which I've had before, but some I haven't, and she patiently explained all of those as well!

We ended up spending (I think) around two hours here and having a really great time. We even discussed coming back the next weekend because we really enjoyed the food and our time here. It was explained to use that Magal means pork skirt, which we didn't have in our combination, so we are definitely going to try that next time!",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,1,0,5,tcx629UT0hFBNNeVE-wuUQ

As for the chicken, it was really good, but it just took an eternity to cook. We didn't start eating it until maybe OVER 30 mins after it was on the grill. Not the restaurants fault. The side dishes were lacking and there wasn't much variety. They were also MEH.

This is a good place to come in a group.  There were five of us and we were seated at table with a little grill in the middle.  

The meal starts with a combination of appetizers and items to be used with grilling--although not clear to me the differences between the two.  The salad and kimchi were good--the kimchi was thankfully not too hot.

There was also an odd sweet soup--although we were not sure if it was a sauce or soup (although our server clarified that it was soup).  I did not care for that.  

We ordered the beef combo, where you get five different meats along with prawns.  The meats were excellent.  Thankfully our server was there to cook the meat.
--The first course was brisket, cut thinly.  Although a little fatty, it was tasty.
--Second was a ribeye.  It could have have been seasoned better, but was cooked really well.  This was served with mushrooms--also good, but lacking seasoning.
--Third was prime rib sushi which the server cooked using a little torch.  This was superb, I could have eaten ten of those.
--Fourth was a skirt steak.  This had a wonderful marinade and was really good.  This was served with grilled pineapple which did not make sense.
--The final  beef dish was short ribs.  They were heavenly.
--It ended with prawns that again had no seasoning, but were still good.

To finish, the server brought out marshmallows, chocolate, and little rice cakes for S'mores.  This was a great finish and a lot of fun to make.

Their alcohol menu is limited and the tea they brought out was odd. It was barley-flavored and started hot, then was served cold later.

All during the meal the servers yelled out odd things.  I was not sure if it meantbsomething was on fire or more food was needed.

(Speaking of brimming: Magal servers wear coolster fedora short-brims; Hobak is hatless).

Our server, Troy, was sensational: did all the prep work, all the cooking, was engaging, and  clearly committed to my group enjoying themselves.

Frankly, Troy should be running the restaurant, because the people who actually ARE running the restaurant have their heads up their asses (which may be why they are the only ones NOT wearing coolster fedora short-brims).

Here's why: 
Magal does not have a wine list, so I brought a bottle of 2010 Bordeaux to go with the beef and the pork. 
When I asked to have it opened, Troy informs me that corkage will be $25. It's corporate policy he says. And on top of that, they don't have proper wine glasses so we'll have to drink out of water glasses!
WTF!

I ask to see the manager. 
He slinks in, and I tell him two things:
1 - charging for corkage when the restaurant has no wine of their own is nothing short of stupid and punitive.
2 - Magal's main competition, Hobak, just up the street, encourages patrons to bring wine and charges zero corkage. 
The manager listens. Says nothing. Then slinks away leaving a noticeable trail of slime as he goes.

Here's lesson #1 of any business: 
It's easier to keep a customer, than to make a new customer. 
That means when a buyer is participating in a business transaction, the seller should make sure the buyer leaves the transaction with a positive feeling. 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM COME BACK TO BUY AGAIN!!!!

The corporate braintrust of Magal must have missed that course at business school.

So which restaurant will still be in business in the next 12-24 months? Hobak or Magal?

My prediction is there will soon be a pile of used coolster fedora short-brims in the dumpster in the parking lot.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,10,4,3,Av9TNqBwXWV2RXCQ6ujB8A

Honestly, I feel like my experience could have been a lot better here. Unfortunately, the restaurant was on the busier end (5pm) so our server ended up burning a lot of our meat/ over cooking it because he forgot to check on it. Which is fine when we're meant to grill our own food- but our server told us we should trust him to cook it. We did-- I regretted it.

I'm Korean so I've eaten all kind of KBBQ. At the price we were paying-- I was definitely expecting more. Portion sizes were on the smaller end, which is fine. I understand we're not at AYCE. But 3 slabs of over cooked pork belly for $26? Not too stoked about that. 

In terms of the quality of the meat though-- it was pretty good! I've been spoiled since I just got back from Seoul and LA. Compared to those places, LV Magal was still acceptable. Again- just wish the server cooked the meat better!

Haha-- actually, there is a Magal in LA and my experience there was bomb. They really have a handle on the grilling and the meat quality is better Better service, better quality food. So interesting how two restaurants of the same chain can be pretty different.


In LA- Quarters is also really good! And if you're looking for a premium all you can eat experience check out Mr. BBQ in Fullerton. Those are my favorites.

Back to the meats here though-- my favorite meats here were definitely the beef short rib (not marinated) and the beef skirt meat.

1. You can handle a little spice on your food
2. You appreciate Korean food
3. You're looking to leave FULLL (even though it's not AYCE)

Now on to my review:
I waited until my second time around to write this review just to make sure my taste buds didn't fool me. This second time around, Im still OBSESSED.

This is by FAR the best kbbq place I've had in a while (and I grew up in LA, so you know I've been to quite a few KBBQ places growing up). 

Let's do a recap:
-they give you complimentary berry tea. This heotkkae berry tea is SOOOO refreshing. It's also great for recovering from hangovers (hint hint )
-we start off strong with kimchi egg and mayo corn
-the banchan makes a STRONG-ASS entrance. The homemade kimchi fucking slays. There's also a delicious black sesame salad and spicy bean sprouts  salad. They actually give you enough fiber to power through your meat-filled journey without regretting tomorrow on the toilet. You even get soondoboo (I'm definitely not spelling that correctly but whatever) to soothe your stomach
-not much to say about the meat, except that's it's DELICIOUS. Great cuts and lots of umami. They also cook your meat for you, unlike other KBBQ places, so the pieces get seared beautifully 
-lastly, they throw in a complimentary red bean shaved ice to finish your meal with the right amount of sweetness. The ice definitely helps with the summer heat too

TL;DR if u were looking at the Las Vegas buffets, your money is better spent here. High quality food all around.",FgpPNKtmZFZ7H9Ym0eCk8Q,4,2,5,9H1-995au2DdIU9sOGllmQ

We ordered a beef combo for 5 of us and we thought it wouldn't be enough. There was too much food. The quality of the whole meal was just great. The galbi and skirt steak were the best two meats they had. We ordered the seafood pancake as well. The pancake was a bit more ""broken"" then the ones I'm use to.

I have tried Magal multiple times in LA. They are known for their quality of meat and their prompt service. However, that was not the case in this location. Food quality was amazing and that is what the two stars are for. Their service was horrible. I don't even expect the server to cook my food for me, I can do it myself if she chooses not to. But whenever we would flip or cut our meats, the server got mad at us. She literally told us not to touch the meats and that she will do it. What a way of intimidating the customer. We are paying for the food and we don't want it to burn. She ended up burning some part of chadol, which was the first part of the beef combo. Then, I decided to flip the ggotsal, then got yelled again. I told her to not bother cooking for our table, which she took it as do not come back to our table. We had to chase down another server to get a refill on our drinks. 

Way to go for a quality KBBQ, but I will cook for myself again next time I go there, just because driving to LA costs me more than cooking my own meat.",WTTlaXK_2g17grShzdsczw,3,0,2,q72x-0y1cHJLD-i96bB-_w
4108240,2017-01-19,7,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Anticipating the typical ridiculously long wait at another Korean BBQ hotspot on Spring Mountain, my group settled on going here instead expecting a good experience without as long a wait. We got what we wanted.

Ma Gal BBQ is one of the newer KBBQ joints in Las Vegas. They are located on their own, spacious parking lot across Spring Mountain from Chinatown Plaza, and they are easy enough to spot while driving by that I knew exactly where to go due to my occasional travel along this road. Note that there isn't an all you can eat option, which means that they're able to afford to serve higher-quality meat.

We had a group of 6, and I arrived to find one friend already seated and the servers seemingly patient to accommodate the rest of our party. I'm glad we're not a group of NFL linebackers or whatnot because they gave us a booth that would normally sit 4. I also constantly found myself unnerved by the unusually low table. Failing to find purchase for resting my elbows, I ended up using the narrow ledge on the divider for one elbow so that I could put myself at some ease. I know people praise the decor a lot, but the ergonomics leave something to be desired.

After we got a sufficient number of our party seated (one guy was running late), we got started with the food. They had already laid out the banchan and most of the condiments, and they cooked the meat fairly attentively, loading raw meat, turning half-cooked meat, rotating the grill plates, cutting pieces, and unloading finished product as necessary. We did pull some meats ourselves early, so it wasn't quite to the extent of having a cook standing there the entire time, but it was very helpful.

We enjoyed the following:

Bamboo Cold Noodles ($9.99) - we had these soups split into two portions for sharing, but we still got hefty portions of a somewhat sweet treat of green noodles that were very difficult to separate and lift. But once you got a mouthful, you couldn't help but keep slurping (or trying to slurp) those soft strings of goodness. I didn't even mind the lack of meat in this particular dish.

Pork Combo ($51.99 small size): pork skirt, knife-tenderized pork belly, special pork neck, marinated pork collar (chosen over spicy marinated skirt), prawns, boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup w/ beef brisket. Pork belly stood out the most, followed by the pork collar 

Beef Combo ($98.99 large size): beef skirt, prime beef brisket, prime beef boneless short rib sushi (chosen over prime beef rib eye), marinated prime short rib, prawns, boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup w/ beef brisket. We started with the beef brisket, which was tender and tasty but not the most spectacular piece that I've had in the local KBBQ scene. That observation turned into a pattern with just about everything else - great but not stellar. The short rib ""sushi"" was solid but not especially something to write home about. The marinated meats in general stood out more for me than the rest.

In terms of the items found in both combos, I will say that the tofu and brisket soup was pretty addictive, and the shrimp was grilled head-on and were enjoyable (including the head pieces), but those aren't the reason you usually go to these kinds of restaurants. Also, there are egg and cheese corn available in wells specially built into the grills, and both were enjoyable bites.

Complimentary S'mores Dessert: at the very end of the meal, they brought out stacks of two rice crackers, each with a small chunk of Hershey's chocolate, and skewers with hefty marshmallows on them. They uncovered the fire and instructed us to roast those suckers, and I will admit that my technique could've benefitted from a handheld torch or something. I did get some browning, but I had to pull it away lest the marshmallow fall off the skewer.

That reminds me: I really liked their variant of the ubiquitous metal chopsticks. These have flat sides, unlike the perfectly round implements that I've had to use everywhere else. The struggle to keep the chopsticks still between bites was real, but not here. You can have peace of mind setting them down for once. Also contained in metal: steamed white rice, which is complimentary upon request. They don't offer rice paper, but I never really had KBBQ with that stuff anyway.

It's indeed not the best Korean BBQ in town, and it's not really cheaper than its competitors (I'm actually still a bit hungry), but Magal is still a worthwhile option if you want some solid full-service non-AYCE BBQ at peak dinner hours, especially with minimal wait time. Or if you actually want to watch TV on the TVs, such as the Thunder vs. Warriors game that was on tonight.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,16,9,4,oVV06GGd7Ml3NuZbNbm3Qg
4199779,2016-12-05,1,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Not for me.

Ma Gal is a little different than the Korean BBQ places that I'm used to, not in a bad way but it's just not how I would prefer to eat Korean BBQ.

It has a modern approach - their plates are ala carte or they have combos. I went with my boyfriend late on a Friday night, it was my first time there and his second time. Because it's a different concept, I wish our server would have explained everything to us because it seemed like we didn't need to cook our food? They were going to take care of that for us?

We ordered the beef combo (beef brisket, we chose prime short ribs (vs. prime rib eye), marinated short rib, grilled prawns, grilled mushrooms, grilled pineapples, boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup). It was enough meat for two people. 

I can tell they're really trying with their service but on more than one occasion, our server wouldn't really check up on us and our meat would burn. Now if it was established that we cook it ourselves, then I would have just taken care of cooking my own food and this could have easily been prevented. But it seemed as though the servers were there to talk us through the best way to eat it (like telling us to have the grilled pineapple with the marinated short rib, etc). I was not a fan of the short rib sushi, it comes out raw and then the server sears it with a blowtorch and drizzles on a sauce. The beef was practically drowned in what tasted like A1/steak sauce that you could hardly taste the quality of the beef. 

The differences that I noticed were that:
- Not your usual banchan, we received some scallion pancake, kim chi, salad with a black sesame dressing, sliced green onions/scallions, egg, corn, pickled vegetable
- No rice paper available, everything's encouraged to eat with a side of rice
- Grill set up is different, egg is cooked on the grill and there's a cooling rack for your cooked meats

Overall, it's a cool environment, very modern and hip. I noticed on their menu that they even have the option to add melty cheese to your food. I felt that I didn't enjoy it enough to justify their prices. Maybe I'm just a little more traditional and prefer to cook my own korean bbq and eat it with rice paper, no need for all the bells and whistles.",dh_2BNnKPlvp3OW3TLTDNQ,2,2,3,KlHH87u-K9HEWr1DuvZbxg

You can order specific meats and Korean food and they each have their own prices for them. The prices are a bit high if you want to experience it, but they have a good quality meat. 

If you want to share with a group they do offer two combos: Skirt Meat Combo and Pork Combo.  My friend and I ordered the Pork Combo. They cook the meat for you, and they'll bring out the meat at a time, sort of like a course meal. The various porks were so delicious!

Our waiter was very nice and recommended to eat the meat with ssamjang. Ssamjang is a common dipping sauce for meat. I'm always wary of anything that's red and Korean, because it's a high chance it'll be spicy; especially for me since I'm weak to spiciness.  I tried out the sauce with my meat, and it was really good! It surprised me since it wasn't spicy to me. I read online that ssamjang can also be made on the sweeter side, so maybe that's why I was able to enjoy the flavor~

They offer a good size selection of side dishes like salad, fish, kimchi, and Korean Vegetable pancake(Jeon). Around the rim there are two section to cook corn and half of the grill rim cooks egg.

The restaurant has a nice modern feel to it where you can have a nice time with good company and delicious food~ I really liked how they had metal chopsticks and the long metal spoons. I always enjoy Korean utensils, especially metal chopsticks since I feel like I have a better grip on my food~

Magal is a nice place for good quality food, even though the prices are a bit expensive, you can make a plan with a group a friends or so where you can probably split the cost if you are willing~ I want to go back to try out their cheese dip~",SiXUv1oE6uTAbbHXOaXy4Q,0,0,4,uFHccP_Gn_0OujnU1R83Bw

They serve much more food for around the same price, and I even liked the meat here just a tad better. Also I liked how they served not just water but some type of cold tea that supposedly very good for you liver! (for free too ;) )The sides that came with the set were not my favorite tho...I did not like the bean sprouts (it had no flavor) and the cold soup was a weird taste. The kimchi here is delish (but if you like more fermented kimchi you might not like this one) The pork was juicy and very flavorful, and the meat was tender and delicious. At hobak i was not full at the end of the meal and we ordered the Large for four people, (their menu says 4-5 people) but here at magal we ordered the one small pork and one small beef combo and had FIVE people instead of four and I could not finish at all!  


Now the service was amazing. Definitely a thousand times better than anywhere else. A big shoutout to JAY and KAT. Jay was very cool and kept up with our interesting conversations. Never had a server who was actually interested in conversing with us about different things. Also even though he was chatting we could see that he was still completely on top of everything. He was constantly paying attention and doing his job (talk about multitasker!) Kat was also another one of our servers and although we did not converse with her as much she was still friendly and when my friend asked for more kimchi she definitely brought him more!

Price: Expensive. The ""large"" beef combo for ""3-4 people"" was $95 and severely lacking in quantity. You WILL leave hungry-- I guarantee it. With tax and tip, our total came out to $120+ for 4 people without any drinks. For that price we got two handfuls of brisket, a plate of marinated ribs, 4 pieces of shrimp, 4 pieces of steak sashimi, and bulgogi.

Food: Mediocre. This place strives to be like Kang Hodong Baekjeong in Los Angeles except it's not. The meat was tough, the salad smelled bad, and the sauces were lacking.

Service: Awful. This is where it goes downhill. From the second the hostess heard we didn't have a reservation and her bad attitude to unfilled cups of water, missing food, slow refills, burnt meat because she wasn't attentive to the grill it went from bad to worse as the meal went on. We found ourselves making multiple requests for the same thing and getting dirty looks when we flipped the meat on the grill even though the server was not doing it for us. 

Overall, not recommended. Skip.",dJtFy2jc1R5cSBab4BLORQ,5,1,2,0S3JoL3Rfh90sMRSFSZacA

Luckily, my coworker's wife recommended that we try Magal BBQ, a Korean BBQ spot about a mile off the strip. So Wednesday night we walk in, starving after a day on our feet, and we were seated immediately. (party of 8) 

Honestly, this place impressed the pants off me! I have had my fair share of delicious KBBQ and this place is right up there at the top of greatness. We ordered two large towers and a few pitchers of beer, and our two servers were so friendly and accommodating! They even split the meat up and divided it after cooking so that each half of the table could try both beef and pork! 

The quality of the meat, service and atmosphere was above par and it was such a relief to be away from the hordes of people that were swarming the strip.

Ordered the Magal combo (I cant believe my son and I finished everything! We didn't finish the squid because by that point we were beyond stuffed but it would've been very good with rice, wish it would've came earlier and not in the end) Meat quality was on point, loved the authentic side dishes (very Korean, not your average basic side dishes you'll find in a basic Korean restaurant), although the soup was not to my standards, my son devoured it and our waiter was kind enough to give us another order of it when my son asked if he can have more :) Through out our meal, our waiter was attentive with cooking our meats. When we were done, our waiter also gave us a complimentary Korean ice dessert, ""Pat-Bingsoo"", which I don't remember seeing in the menu let alone the menu having a dessert section, so that was very thoughtful of him :)",pgKaOWxqBfix9E19DgX9Cw,0,0,5,NYii58akFoRSwMmqB0x0Rg

We were promptly seated and although a bit apprehensive about the lack of customers, we ordered their large combos of both beef and pork.  Also added a melted cheese side that they melt on a small cast iron skillet on the table.

Being 6 of us, we opted for 2 grilling stations.

Maybe because they weren't any other customers around but the service was phenomenal with the server bouncing between the 2 grills and evenly dividing and mostly cooking the meats for us.

The meat quality was better than traditional K-BBQ joints and the variety of cuts, marinades and seasonings were pretty good.

One of the dishes was a meat sushi that they cook by torching at the table.  It was fun to watch and tasted great.

The melted cheese to fondue select cuts was interesting with the ladies enjoying it more than the guys.

The meal was very very filling but we had to taste the mool-naeng-myun.  They were nice enough to split up 1 order for us.  Very refreshing.

Oh yeah ... the last thing grilled was some shrimp that was peeled but not cleaned well.  This was the only disappointment.

Finally, they brought out marshmallows on a metal skewer for each of us to roast over the grill.  We made k-s'mores with Korean ""cracker"" and chocolate.  It should be noted they cook their ""cracker"" there.  Fun and Tasted Great!

All in all a nice surprise with a great meal.

4607618,2016-08-21,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"My husband and I chose to come here for lunch. I admit I was hesitant before we even walked in since I had looked at the menu and had seen the prices before hand but my husband thought they looked good and they were close. Let me also note that we were 1 of 3 tables dining and they were not very busy. 

We were greeted and sat immediately which was nice. They got drinks going right away as well. Since we had never been to this restaurant I wanted some time to look over the options but felt rushed by the server so we ended up getting the skirt meat combo which came with a variety of beef and pork. We also ordered chadol. They brought out some cold jelly soup and two salads which were ok. One salad tastes like kimchi with lettuce and the other had a slight peanut flavor.  We pulled out chopsticks and spoon out as they were setting up our grill and the server mildly scolded us for setting them down on our napkins (they are suppose to be placed on the parchment they come in) so that was a little off putting since I've never been anywhere that did that I didn't know. 

The chadol was placed on the grill first and the server would come back and serve it to us. Chadol is one of my faves and theirs is good. They did a grill change before the next meat which was a beef skirt strips. I was confused as the first meat they cooked and served us but the second one no one came back so I finally turned it and served us. The third meat which was pork was placed by the server who told us she'd be serving us. With that said the pork burned and I mean it was burned I started to move it and the server snatched the tongs from me like she was upset I tried to move it but realized she had not come back soon enough. She didn't even apologize. She brought back a few pieces of pork to try again but no where near what would have been included in our combo. So I felt like I really didn't get what I paid for

The last thing and it's probably silly but the server explained the menu to my husband and not to me. What I mean is she stood on his side of the booth and leaned in and explained it to him. With the fan on I could hardly here what she was saying nor did she make eye contact with me like she was talking to both of us. It seemed odd and then my husband had to explain what she said. 

Pros: quick seating, chadol was good and beef was tender. Husband enjoy what little of the pork we got. 

Cons: not clear on the etiquette(utensils and cooking), took way to long to attend to food, seriously over priced for the service given. 

Over all it would not be my first pick for Korean bbq. What we did eat was good but there are better places in the area for Korean bqq that are worth the money.",XOCXW96-T0_ekYt22z_4VQ,0,0,3,DEdMYzR0prJeJaL74xvMJw

After the nearby Lost Games Escape Room event, I wanted to finally check out Mapo Galmaegi bka Magal. My girlfriend likes their Mul Naengmyeon especially with the great lunch deal they offer. I was totally down for some cold soup action, but the Galbi Tang was just calling my name and I always find it hard to resist.

I went with the spicy version, which I guess on the menu is actually the Galbi Yukgaejang. In any case, it was absolutely delicious. The beef bones are gigantic, but the staff did an excellent job of cutting the meat from the bone before serving the bowl to me. It was one of the best galbi soups I've ever had (and at this point, it's almost an obsession of mine). There was barely a drop spared.

The girlfriend said her naengmyeon wasn't as good as her previous visit, but it tasted great to me. The banchan spread was also on point with good variety and quality.

This place is also the first place I known that give soup as part of the appetizers. All the appetizers are really well made even though it's free. 

The house salad is perfect to have with the meal. No matter how delicious a grilled food, i always need some kind of vegetables to balance my diet. But their house salad is so good that I might even order that as a takeout for future lunch diet. 

The way the grill setup is very unique. There is a well on the left half side for an omelette. And right half side is reserved for the cooked meat. The server grill all the food from start to the end. Two or three server take turn making sure my meat is not burn. I don't have to touch the grill tongs once!

This was looking like a Korean bbq in thanksgiving dinner proportions.

The meat was all choice or prime and Sunny Park did most of the work flipping and shuffling food around the in table grill even taking the meat off the rib bones. All of the sides and sauces were so freakin' tasty and my personal favorite was the iced acorn soup.

In terms of the food, the galbi was probably some of the most tender that I've had at a Korean spot in Vegas or L.A. The flavors were on point as well. Now if you enjoy soju then I recommend getting the pork skin and intestine as it pairs quite well together. 

Overall, the meat quality was top notch and the portion size was more than appropriate for the price point. If you're more attuned to the finer things in life and quality is as important for you as it is for me then you'll have an excellent experience here. 

However, if you're thing is pigging out on cheap cuts then you'll probably want to hit up a $ establishment to better suit your needs. On that note, it's important to set expectations and understand that what you're paying for is a higher quality and more authentic Korean BBQ experience similar to what you would receive in Korea. So it's incorrect to judge the establishments merits using the similar criteria to an all you can eat spot because they're paying premiums for their meat while some of these other spots serve you week old cuts acquired on discount in some back alleyway.

In terms of the service, the servers were very attentive. We never had to touch the tongs or the uncooked meat ourselves. The servers are trained to cook the whole meal to perfection for you to maintain the integrity of the meat and so that you can focus on simply enjoying your meal. Now one of my pet peeves is having to actively search for a server to refill a food or drink item and I can honestly say this was not an issue here. Even servers that weren't directly helping us would come by and refill our drinks or side dishes if they happened to walk by and see them half full.

*****Food: The food was all around amazing. I definitely loved the Kimchi side dish, it had the right flavor, wasn't overly sour or spicy. We ordered the Large Combo and it was seriously enough food to go around. The combo consisted or many quality meats, my favorites being the short ribs, beef skirt and beef brisket. The meat was nicely cooked to your liking and is tender and punching with flavor with every bite! It makes my mouth watery talking about it again!

*****Service: The service here was excellent. Young, our server, was very knowledgable, sociable, and had the charisma to really keep the energy going in our party.

4864704,2016-06-09,0,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. I mean the vibe is good music is booming and why cook your meat yourself when you have someone doing it for you. It's the best ever. Only paid a little over 100 for 4 people and the meat was simply delicious. I recommend the beef combo guys SIMPLY PHENOMENAL! The service you get here you won't get at any ayce KBBQ place. Everyone should definitely check it out.

First of all, don't wear anything fancy, because little bits of grease will splatter on your clothes from the sizzling meat. Also, the meat isn't super tender, and they just give you chopsticks and a spoon. The food was ok. Nothing I would ever crave again. It was a place that they actually cooked the food for you. The sides are unlimited and very tasty. The drink menu is very limited. Friendly atmosphere",UgYG3TgJocOM-HZ2-VE6zg,0,0,3,I4v6Ql7kRDUeVNEG_c59uA

Pros: Someone is always cooking for you. They're always changing their grills. The meat quality is higher than the other restaurants. There's cheesecake at the end of the meal.

BUT there were so many different dishes here. As the dishes were brought out, we had no idea what they were. There was some sort of cold soup that had ice in it. I didn't care for their salad or their bean sprout mix either. Kim chee was the only regular side dish. The only thing I really liked was some sort of fried pancake thing and the corn that is on the side of the grill. Again, the lady would come and cook and you know she should tell us what we were eating, but she didn't. I don't know how everyone is, but I like to know what I'm eating so if I like it, I can order it next time.

I just wasn't impressed by this place. It's pricier also. I don't think this will ever be my first choice in Kbbq.",jKrYE0ls8o2zCFYHubihsw,0,0,3,D1VrL5RDL-weGclBjEPv-A

Any way, we were given so much food. Like a lot of KBBQ places, they give you all the banchan(side dishes) you want. The thing about this place is that the waitress helps you BBQ the food. I'm not sure if it is customary for all KBBQs in the states to cook the food for you but I'm used to just being given the meat myself and having to cook it myself.

It came with short ribs, pork belly, ribeye and squid. Pretty amazing price for that much food. Everything was juicy but I think I'd be fine without the squid.",SNsGwqisRVFQ4N8EQID1Ag,0,0,5,50sXHnxZfeZ7mxp5qUCWKA

5067480,2017-12-24,1,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Decent and very nice staffed Korean BBQ place where they cook and cut the meat for you. The sides were pretty standard Korean side dishes except the mash potatoes was a surprising pumpkin mash. Very nice. 

We got the beef package for 4 people because there was 4 of us and we couldn't finish it lol. But it was pretty good. However, their smoke ventilation doesn't do that great of a job. At other kbbq places I've been to, they have adjustable ones that go right up the meat so you're not bothered by the smoke. It was pretty bad. My poor cousin was directly in the smoke's path like standing behind the grill when

 someone is bbqing on the beach. The package includes pineapple and mushrooms which was very exciting. I could eat grilled pineapple all day.

The disappointing part was the scrambled egg and corn. Other places I've been to had corn cheese but this place was just regular corn. Scrambled eggs was whatever. 

Despite their busy-ness, the wait was only like 20 minutes on a Saturday at 7pm. 

Overall, a pretty standard staff cooks your meat place, but I wouldn't really recommend unless you wanna die from smoke inhalation.

""What's a hagfish?  Heck, we gotta get one of those, and how do they make a chicken foot boneless?   We have to try it""  continues my Asian poker bud.

""Oh come on guys"" whines Midwest poker bud.

Magal, the newest, authentic KBBQ chain to enter the Vegas food scene by way of Korea through China, and Southeast Asia.  Authentic flavors, yes.  Expansive menu with more than just KBBQ, yes.  Distracting environment.   Loud K-Pop music videos showing on the monitors, servers dressed in tropical uniforms and straw hats, and an over the top branded decor reminiscent of Josie and the Pussycats.  The food however, is solid.

Tip:  ala carte beef and pork plates are large (one per person if planning to share).  Combo's offer the greatest variety at the best value.  All include veg for grilling and soup.

About the beef, like most KBBQ joints, PRIME equals good quality and NOT USDA Prime grade.  That said, the ""PRIME"" beef is plenty tender with good marbling.  Typical sweetened soy marinade.  Tasty.  Skirt, and shortrib cuts top the list.  The weak point, the thin sliced brisket end point.  Shaved from frozen into rolls and cooked as a roll, there's just not enough in the bite to release flavor.

Pork is their forte.  Belly, neck, sweet soy marinated pork collar and spicy marinated ""skirt"" (have no clue what this cut is) all have lots of internal fat that cooks up sweet and crisp.  Pork skin and entrails are on the menu as well.  We passed.

Gas cook tops.  Grills are changed as needed.  Hoods are good but not great so expect  eu de KBBQ when you leave.

Service is good.  They will offer to cook for you.  Unless you want all your proteins cooked well done, insist on cooking for yourself.  If they refuse to relinquish cooking, just reach in and pull your meats from the grill when you want.

Yummy food and cuts of meat

Cons:

It's like a club. WAY too loud and you have to yell at your dinner mates.
They need better ventilation. Smoke is CONSTANTLY in your face. It's horrible and you smell awful when you leave for hours. 
Meh customer service. The person who cooked for us did not tell us what the meats were. We had to ask every time. She seemed very busy and frantic.

5103713,2016-11-09,4,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"When it comes to Korean BBQ, I can honestly say that I've experienced many BBQ restaurants across the country as well as overseas.  A lot of people I know prefer quantity and go with AYCE, and to that I say, ""to each their own.""  Personally, I prefer quality and stumbled into Magal BBQ during a recent business trip.

Located off of the strip, Magal BBQ offers different cuts of beef presented on a multi-tiered platter.  The almost ""pre-fixed"" style menu gives you a chance to try different cuts of meat, while still having the option to order your favorite meat.

Quality of the meats is great.  I am a big fan of KHD, and Magal BBQ goes above and beyond to separate themselves from a crowd favorite.  The beef sushi was a nice touch, and is included with the dinner.  The complimentary Korean shaved ice dessert was a very nice touch.  

Service was good.  In spite of the fact they were short handed the night I visited, our server was very attentive to our needs, made sure our water glasses were always full, and kept an eye out as our beer bottles started emptying lol.  The giant screen TV adds a nice touch, as well as the music playing aloud.  The interior decor is modern, the staff is friendly, and the overall vibe is nice.

Parking lot is big and free.  It is also about a $7 Uber from the Mirage.  Folks here speak English, can accommodate large parties.  Highly recommend Magal BBQ.

I realize that every place has a different style to it as far as Kbbq is concerned but I never had it in the way it was presented tonight there were definitely some similar things that were consumed tonight but they definitely put a twist to it. If you like like spicy kimchi flavor you'll love it here. I think they aim to please a demographic that likes spicy food.

Just like some of the new spots to eat Kbbq in town it's all about the packages now. For 2 people my wife and I had the beef combo. Brisket, flank,short ribs and some shrimp and we also ordered the volcano egg fried rice. We were so full that the rice was breakfast for the next day which was pretty yummy but spicy.

What surprised me the most was the grill it had compartments where the sever put this corn mixture and the steamed egg mixture that cooked while you grilled and it stayed warm the whole time. I really prefer the traditional way of steamed egg to be honest which would probably be my only thing I will say that wasn't that great. Other than that the service was great from start to finish.

Here's why :

It's not AYCE ! 
Yes , that's a good thing .

AYCE = all you can eat .    And to be honest all you can eat Korean BBQ places in China town has gone down hill in the last few years .

This place was fresh and clean . Good service , clean restaurant , food is on another level .  
Quality cuts of beef served properly .  Very impressive . 

Service is fast and attentive . The staff changes the grill faces out after every selection of meat is cooked so you always have a clean grilling surface . 

The price is roughly the same as all you can eat places and you get more than you can handle with the meat combo platters that are offered .

We ordered a combo platter for 4 and paid roughly 26 dollars a person and there was still meat over . 
Definitely bang for your buck .

5349223,2016-06-30,6,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"My friends and I have been waiting for Magal to open for, what seemed to be, forever. Magal is actually has several other locations outside of Nevada. They have locations in California and, I believe, a location in New York as well. The only thing is that I feel as though they opened so late that they're at a disadvantage.

My friends and I came to have dinner about two days after their grand opening. We decided to go with two small combos. The size difference between the small combo and the large combo doesn't make sense when you calculate the price of it. You get more with two small combos when it comes down to it. We got a small beef combo and a small pork combo. 

For the beef combo, it comes with brisket, boneless short rib/rib eye, marinated rib eye, boneless short rib sushi, prawns, and soybean soup. For the pork combo, it comes with pork belly, pork neck, pork collar/spicy pork skirt meat, prawns, rib eye sushi, and soybean soup. 

Everything was decently good. I didn't care too much for the rib eye sushi because it's just for entertainment. They torch the raw thin slice of rib eye while it's on top of some sushi rice. So some of the rice gets torched as well and then at the end, they pour some sauce over it for you to eat. It was more like ""Oh that's really cool!"" and when you eat it, it's like ""Oh okay...""

Everything else was pretty alright. The meat quality is really good. Also, what I did love was that our server was constantly there, cooking for us -- they were also constantly changing the grills almost every time we switched meats. The grill itself has a ring around it. Two areas had a corn salad, there was egg that was cooking on like half of the ring, and then there was an area where you can put cooked meats. I didn't like the egg portion though because if you didn't eat it at the right time, it was overcooked. Overcooked egg is meh. I think I would've preferred if they put mozzarella cheese where the egg is and that would've been better. 

As for the banchan, they didn't have much to offer besides the fish cake and kimchi. The variety was puny. 

At the end of the meal, I really wanted to order the volcano fried rice. It looked really interesting but if you order it, you have to order a minimum of 2 ... so we ordered two. They cooked it all in front of you at your grill. It was entertaining to watch. The flavor? Eh. Nothing to write home about. 

Oh, here's the real winner of the night, a dead bug dropped onto my head. I felt something drop on my head and I was just so confused so when I put my hand there to grab whatever it was ... it turned out to be a dead beetle. Great ending! I did tell management and they were kind enough to take off the fried rice from our bill for compensating us. But it was odd -- the manager even said that they cleaned the hoods in the morning so he wasn't even sure where it came from. Plus, it's a new establishment, there shouldn't be dead bugs anywhere!!! Anyways..

Overall, I think Magal opened really late -- there have already been two new KBBQ joints that opened before them: Hobak and Goong. I have tried Hobak and I like Hobak better as a whole than Magal. Magal, to me, doesn't hold much of a difference than many other KBBQ joints aside from the server changing grills every time. For the meat quality, I can go somewhere else. For a server to cook for me, I can also go somewhere else. In the end, there's nothing at Magal that would make me go back ...",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,9,4,3,RPTgqXyRbPZGVM5_Bh72FA

While taking an Uber around Vegas, we sparked up a conversation with our South Korean driver. One thing led to another, and we asked him for his recommendation for the best KBBQ joint in Vegas. He said MAGAL.

He expressed how hard it is to find authentic BBQ in America, but how this place does it really well (and at a super reasonable price). We were sold.

We walked in to a clean environment with friendly staff. We chose the MAGAL combo and the food appeared almost instantly. Seriously freaky fast.

At this particular KBBQ restaurant, they cook the food for you. All you have to do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the delicious food. After the first few dishes, we knew we would be coming back ASAP.

And the portions are perfect. We ordered a combo for two and were fighting to finish every delicious KBBQ bite. I'd be very surprised if you left this place hungry.

This place's food is amazing, the staff are friendly, environment is clean & modern, &... I am struggling to find anything negative about this place. 

I just hope this chain grows & grows so one will pop up closer to my hometown soon.",VPBM0_W3nfHeJOuiV_Hp7A,2,0,5,cO8fRDTZhwe4mbfK58mevg

Need t work on better Aircondition installation. There is no seats or bar area for waiting customers. Since this restaurant has over 500 branches worldwide, it must be hard to maintain the quality of food or services.  We ordered the beef combo and they are just okay.  The food has so much sugar in it, the taste of all the dishes are sugary and could not taste the true beef flavor. I hope all the food could be less sugary. Other than that, torch baking Wagyu beef sushi was a great performance for the customers.  Friendly staffs and food presentation deserve five stars but the food taste could get two stars. I could get better taste of BBQ in some other places easily, so I would give three stars. Hopefully, the taste of beef or pork would improve over the years.",MzScNX3oh2ur2iq46JM6IA,0,0,3,MNHjwl3rwpfX2GR8KGOEGg

Place was happening tonight with a minimal wait.
Went with the beef combo for 2. Always when I go I always think is this going to be enough but rolled out stuffed. I've tried all 3 combos and they all are great so do t worry if you have troubles choosing!

I didn't get the name of the server but he was awesome. He said he had a bit of a cold and said he was sorry which is a change from some servers not carrying and hacking right in front of you.

Decor is nice feels like an underground hang out. Dark with bright lights around your table so you can see what you're doing. One neat feature they have is a little red button that when push sends a server over to assist with whatever you need instead of trying to attempt to hail down the next person.

He cooked everything for us, but he didn't refill our waters, which is understandable we came at a busy time and he had other tables, so I just drank my fiancé's water instead.

5630285,2017-01-04,3,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"Hubby and I stopped in one cold Saturday evening (after having driven past it the night before) and were seated after a short wait (we wanted a booth, not stools - we old/lazy, no more core strength!)

We were given a primo spot in the midst of all the fun and excitement of a trendy KBBQ place.

We ended up ordering the Beef Combo and then sat back to snack on the banchan they provided and distract ourselves until the main event happened.

I loved most of their banchan.  The salad with the creamy dressing was a little odd and I didn't much care for the flavor. The acorn jelly soup was my fave and I ended up eating mine and hubby's.  We weren't offered refills and I'm not usually shy about asking but I guess I just wanted to take measure of how this place operated and then got distracted by other stuff.

Also, I recommend their special tea (what you get when seated).  When asked, our server said they do not sell it. Bummer!

The food comes in a little tower and our server basically cooked everything for us.  The combo also came with a sushi thing drizzled with a gochujang-like sauce which was a-ok.  The meats were all definitely top-notch quality.  I wasn't too big on the marinated short rib flavor but the tenderness helped a lot.

Up until this point, service was on-point (with the exception of not offering refills on stuff).  Our guy was super attentive and accommodating. The tea refills were perfect temperature and he made sure our meat was cooked to our liking. 

Then...he went on break and we got a girl who didn't seem as invested in her work, being that she spent most of her time walking around being freezing cold (I'd noticed her odd posture earlier in the evening, before she started helping us).  I asked for a refill of the tea and basically gulped down a small mouthful of scalding liquid which had to have just been boiling a few seconds before.  Thank goodness our meal was almost at an end because my taste buds were toast.  

At this time, we asked for our check from the manager but he quickly told us there was dessert.  This was a pleasant surprise since I didn't see that being included on the menu.  So we got s'mores on Korean rice crackers.  Pretty delicious, if I should say so.

All in all, we enjoyed our meal at Magal. (Found out there's one in LA, too.  Cool!)",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,2,3,4,osj9weNYDsMO_7sUfG_FxQ

The details:

- Inside is super nice: clean and well decorated. The workers are vey welcoming: as soon as someone comes in, the whole staff says ""Hello! Welcome!"" in Korean. It's pretty dope. It remind me of 85C workers with their ""FRESH BREAD!"" Haha 
- The food was so good. I went with my sister and we got the (1) Hot stone bibimbap $9.99 and (2) spicy cold noodles $7.99. How do you go wrong with that? Everything was fresh, nicely seasoned, and totally authentic. Idk how else to describe it.  The spicy noodles though do not have a lot of meet at all. I also recommend you taste testing the vinegar and mustard that comes with it. Mustard has wasabi in it and I put too much. Omg. 

Another thing I was impressed about was the side dishes. Kim chi and pickled radish was on point: nice sour pickling that you can feel in the back of your throat once you eat it. Not unpleasant at all. 

The salad had a cool peanut dressing. NOTE: IT HAS PEANUT FOR THOSE WITH ALLEGIES. And they have pancakes as side dishes!! Omg those are my fave.

They seemed a bit preoccupied because they weren't ready which was okay with us as we were talking and catching up.  One of the things that turned me off about it was that they tried to get us started but kept walking away and we ended up with burnt and raw egg bubbling onto the table.

We ordered the beef combo for 2 and it actually turned out to be a lot of food for 2 people.  I truly believe that 4 of us could have had it and been perfectly content.  I didn't realize that the last meat we would get was squid though and I thought that was kind of weird.  I mean I like squid but I ordered the beef combo.  Also, the ""sushi"" they serve was just not good.  Flavorless and covered in what tasted like watered down A1.  Not good.

The quality of the meats and marinades are what keeps this rating at a 3 and not a 2.  There were only 2 instances in which we got gristle and fat so for the price we were paying, it was well worth it.  The banchan were ok.  They weren't the best salads I've ever had and were a little lackluster but they were plentiful and not bad tasting.

I will gripe about them cooking the meats for us.  I usually like to go to AYCE because I don't want to be forced to eat something in a particular order but I understand this version and coming here I knew what I was getting myself into.  The problem I had was they were understaffed and didn't come around often enough. And when we would try to do it ourselves, someone would come by and kind of rudely take over.

This place was ideally good, the few times we came here. My family enjoyed the food and everything was good, expect maybe the steamed egg- I really don't care for kimchi mixed in, and I Opted for regular egg, it cooked strange and dried out fast, almost like when  you leave eggs on the stove and forget to turn the burners off- I've never seen any Korean bbq spots have this issue and it was quite disappointing.
But my one star sadly has nothing to do with the egg experience 
my bad experience is my most recent visit 
We were looking to dine with our extended family and it brought our party to a whooping 7- 
4 adults and 3 little ones-
As I came in to check in and grab a table for 7- I was surprisingly encountered with a comment oh I told you we no have table for 7. I was thrown back because I did not inquire as I just walked in.
second how do you not have a table for 7?
The hostess prompted me to follow her as she helped tables and showed me two tables telling me this is all they had 
I was little confused on why she was trying to break up our party? We came together to eat together and have a delightful dinner
I told her no that would not work, and as I tried to ask for the empty private rooms that had table to accommodate our party. she just turned away without warning in the middle of our conversation and started to talk to a table who was eating. 
Mind you they didn't ask her for help! She thought it would be fitting to ignore me mid sentence while I was talking to her (in the middle of the aisle)
Oh man that was the icing on the cake! After she finished she tried to talk to me again- about splitting up my party- already fed up and upset on what just happened- I looked at her and said' oh are you done? Now you want to talk to me- 
I gladly reminded her how rude and wrong  on what she did!  I told her you know what I am done, 
I don't want to eat here anymore or talk to you.
we will gladly take our business else where 
and we did- we packed up and headed to Hobak- the food and service is way better!
Based on what just happened- I don't plan on coming back to this rude and inconsiderate establishment, who doesn't care about a party sitting together. 
Good luck with that Magal, it was nice knowing you! You might wanna train your staff to be a bit more friendly to non-Korean customers!",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,4,0,2,_E6TRFH3_Vt5cVUpBb8-5w

Took babe here for the beef plate. It's definitely enough for two people. You get rice and a bunch of sides, including egg, seaweed salad, regular salad, kimchi, and much much more!

The meats were the star of the show! So flavorful, no need to add anything to them. They were tender and tasty. The employees actually help you cook your food. 

Babe really enjoyed the beef sushi. This place is very good! On the pricier side but definitely worth it.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,5,3,5,eEqrvrazqWVmFZSRJXKMZg
5928785,2017-03-21,1,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"This is my favorite kbbq place in Vegas. I came in for my birthday dinner which was also the first time I tried this place out. We came in at around 6 pm and the place was not too packed with plenty of parking. We were seated promptly and were offered menu right away. I really wanted to try the volcano rice but it said on the menu that it requires at least 2 orders for them to make it. It's probably way too much food on top of the beef combo for the two of us but we added it anyways. 

The first item that came was the beef sushi and the lady used a torch to sear it at our table. After the sushi she started grilling all kinds of top quality meat and everything tasted great. My favorite was the prime beef boneless short rib and I've been constantly craving it since. After we were done with our meats she took down the grill and started making the volcano fried rice. It had a nice presentation and did look like a volcano. One thing we'd hope to change would be to have them make the fried rice before we started grilling the meat so we can have rice with our meat. 

I liked everything about this place. The restaurant looks extremely clean and the server was very attentive and managed to stay away while we were eating and would appear again right when we were finished to grill the next set of meat. Her timing was perfect. They offered ice barley tea instead of water which was very refreshing. 

Overall I had a great experience and will most definitely be coming back to try out more of their items.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,1,0,5,8RXhg_fNmI0mNlFQa1-8qw

This isn't all you can eat but the orders were plentiful, quality was good and prices decent.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,18,4,OjhA5FG23s7iAeR8PIyv6Q
5961910,2017-12-13,1,aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,"I organized a Vegas weekend trip for 20+ people and wanted to find a good spot for a group dinner. I quickly found that restaurants on the Strip that take reservations are expensive and want to hold our credit card. Thinking outside of the box, I suggested Magal BBQ to the group and it was a huge hit.

We were set up in the back group room, which accommodates up to 24 in six tables of 4. One experienced server was dedicated to our room and she did a fantastic job accommodating all of our needs. We decided to simplify our payment by having each table of 4 order and pay amongst themselves. My table of 4 ordered the large Magal combo which came with many types of beef, pork, veggies, and even squid at the end. We also got a couple of bottles of soju to share. Three big guys and I had plenty of food to go around. 

Our server was super pleasant and was very aware of the dietary (no beef) restriction of one of the diners at an adjacent table. She cooked the one cut of beef in their order first, then switched grill-tops and tongs thereafter to ensure that nothing else touched beef. It was very thoughtful of her.

She also offered us dessert (yummy shaved ice) if a few of us checked-in on Yelp, which we didn't hesitate to do. Since our group had quite a few December birthdays to celebrate as well, we also brought our own cake. Unlike some other places, Magal was happy to let us bring our own and helped make sure everyone had plates and utensils to enjoy the cake. 

My table of 4 rounded up our tip and the total of this great meal was $40 per person.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,2,0,5,_8tAxy-GHXObM_lcMxJZ8Q
