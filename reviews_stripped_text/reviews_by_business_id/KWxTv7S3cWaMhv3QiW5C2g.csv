9708,2016-08-23,0,KWxTv7S3cWaMhv3QiW5C2g,Supervisor was very inconsiderate!!!! Treating his employees like trash and ignoring them anytime they needed help with something or were disturbing what he was doing. One employee was trying to get help voiding an item for a customer and not once did he go help. Employee tried getting his attention multiple times and he just kept ignoring her. Supervisor went to the kitchen and never came back. Would really consider replacing this supervisor with someone more helpful.,ER7dl7bbWHigdbY-KoQN3A,0,0,1,cAYcDzGxmSerD8LrUqHrbg

They could run this place with two good employees but instead, 5 employees and 2 managers walk around paying little attention to customer's needs. Just get something to eat at Starbucks.",uoPjIWb7Od1lZYpLhd2z3w,0,0,1,6UJfnIqI5BR3v2eD-j_odw

Clear your own table before you sit down!!!! I don't care that the high price is caused by the 'cost of their rent'. Absolute extortion. Avoid at all costs. Staff didn't really care either. In fact, when I complained about the costs she said, 'yeah, I get that everyday'!",87ozGtG_U_UGN2Hg9X8Slw,1,0,1,FaWwsb7oJn9rs_X-b8XhaA

This is outrageous that the label of this item says: Salmon wrap when it actually contains porc! The service is also very poor, you don't know where to go to pay and the lady doesn't even indicate you to go to the cashier once you order.
I'm extremely frustrated right now as I took out my order and I'm now seating on a 5h flight with no food! You guys really suck!",GvwlMVem0Ckkv6nLGdwVBQ,0,0,1,PoQNRgFE8a6iph46t9cH2A
1849707,2015-11-09,1,KWxTv7S3cWaMhv3QiW5C2g,"I was trying to find a healthier option in this wing of the airport and in doing so, spent $10 on the worst wrap I've ever had. Barely warm tortilla with a nearly freezing internal temperature. On top of that, it was eight dollars for a Negra Modelo. 

This takes airport food to a new low for me and I fly often. I almost wish I would have gone for one of the alternatives - Burger King or Carl's Jr...",a3jNyJP_pRz7DzRbGTC2Zg,0,0,1,0eu7LE1MKloz498njSGOMw
1989166,2015-06-28,0,KWxTv7S3cWaMhv3QiW5C2g,For airport food this was really good. Lots of choices from sandwiches & wraps to salads and desserts. Pretty reasonable prices. A healthier option to burgers and fries.  Service was awesome very sweet and friendly staff.,ZlctbyVCCUfDrwbnw-LOgA,0,0,4,pMwhKIv3iptuJ72xH47OFQ

All the ingredients were fresh and you could tell just by the aroma (minus the feta which doesn't inherently smell all that great).",IlGYj_XAMG3v75rfmtBs_Q,0,0,4,CCmMeTKnd1WPmEMhLPadVA
3667560,2017-02-08,0,KWxTv7S3cWaMhv3QiW5C2g,"Located in gate E, terminal 3. La Tapenade is a decently healthy choice. However, the salads and sandwiches are prepackaged (in addition to a few Asian noodle bowls, lol random). I ordered the Greek salad the price is steep at $11 but it's fresh and guilt-free. The lady at the counter looked at me a little funny when I asked if they have hummus since medditerian food usually equals hummus. They do not, which is a bit of a bummer. The sandwiches don't look particularly appetizing,  but I wasn't able to try for myself.",UT6V5Bb4P4DkrNRTPEmtfw,0,0,3,r7faQPPM-XK5zouJJy13tA

For $10 I got two pieces of day old bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato, and basil.  The workers don't speak English so it is very difficult to order.  Everything is overpriced.  They don't deserve to call themselves a restaurant when they take advantage of tourists who don't know any better.",qfmSde33Kf5CcggkKaHRBg,0,0,1,ttMcWFGmf6eR0kl2jzfpZw
4403478,2017-07-23,0,KWxTv7S3cWaMhv3QiW5C2g,I can't believe that I paid $13 for a 'cuban' sandwich. They literally put sliced fat instead of pork roast in my sandwich with a slice of ham (thus allowing me three edible bites of sandwich). Fortunately the bread was delicious and fresh. Sadly I have to board and can't go to complain.,t0ADUqUMeyrBoHA7MO8Y5w,0,0,1,EthAcjzOe_R31bgG_2S11w

The lime chicken sandwich that my wife ordered was also less than stellar.  The service was slow, and they already had run out of several sandwiches on the menu, even though we ordered around 1pm.",JUQLhEJG-VvbdyxzFBkdTw,0,0,1,4JfYVJZaNwJVtVd1uO5D6w

I did not have any money because I lost my wallet and this place gave me food and a drink and fully took care of me. Tanesha was the nicest person and I can not thank her enough for her kindness. Thank you so much and anytime I come to Las Vegas in the future I will be sure to stop here. I appreciate you!,NjObowWZ-y_VkPKYoS2w-g,0,0,5,iJBq5u291KjkWULhbmmgtA

Food was good and they have a nice selection. I went with one of their grilled mozz and chicken sandwich and it wasn't too bad. 

I agree with the other reviewer that service is on the slow side and they didn't seem to know who was first in line since they helped someone who cut in front of me and even watched him do it LOL. 

All in all I had a good and healthier-side sandwich so it worked out. 

A-OK pretty much sums it up here.",-E4Smvof6DdBHCnZNyxNMw,1,0,3,rWD9LiTDHe6fjwRhZY3apg

5913631,2016-03-11,2,KWxTv7S3cWaMhv3QiW5C2g,"This is a great option for those flying from Terminal 3 or departing on United or Hawaiian Airlines who check in at Terminal 3 and ride the tram to D. La Tapenade is located right next to Carls Jr by gate E3. 

La Tapenade has everything from salads, wraps, panini's, flat breads and gourmet desserts. The two employees working were very friendly and helpful. I chose the caprese sandwich which came with a small side of bow tie pasta. The bread was super fresh as was the slices of buffalo mozzarella. There was only one small slice of tomato on each side however. 

If your looking for something somewhat healthy or even a custard tart or chocolate mousse while in terminal 3 this is the place. Prices are average for the airport.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,3,3,4,e5-8Ao6qVv12tuFfwrtC7A
