The place is clean. And the service is good. 
But the issues I have with this location is that they do not offer a restroom at all. 

Most subways I been to offer a restroom.
The issue I had was the lettuce for the last two times I been there looked a little brown.",wiIDeJV0DOWVlKrKgG1NQg,1,0,2,uHbBwaizhtu92lVUBqMaww

I don't understand, if you don't want to work at subway, go find somewhere else to work.",-5gvyv0JkkGZTJaQ3GDhCw,1,0,1,8A1nT6e4h5IcAD-JL33OMA

Don't know his name but the tall black dude made the best Subway sandwich I've ever had. Ingredients were SUPER fresh at this location and he put them together so well! He was also really kind and personable!,FNT65-MXWQIAuh7vzuwKWQ,1,1,5,GGvTqEUfWXkSf-hZAvGyXw

Sandwich turned out fine since Subway's consistency is something you can always count on.  But I also ordered a large coffee. Watched her pour it and noticed the liquid was obviously clear, making me suspect there's less coffee and more water.  Took a sip right away before paying and let her know it wasn't brewed right.  She immediately replied, so you don't want coffee then?"" I said, ""No, I do want coffee. But this must've been brewed without a fresh bag."" She replied, ""That's the way it is. So you don't want coffee."" Clearly not interested in dealing with the 1 customer in the building and even less interested in properly brewing a real pot of Seattle's Best, she took my cup back and charged only for my sandwich.  I always prefer Subway for breakfast over the greasier fast food spots, but I won't prefer it at this location again.",s81YWGDJpgdIfsC3rOtiyQ,3,0,1,_89L_vjeha3rnWm5wjfxrQ
