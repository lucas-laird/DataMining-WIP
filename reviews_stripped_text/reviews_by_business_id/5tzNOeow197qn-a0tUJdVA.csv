Our total order included the Mahi Mahi tacos, pulled pork sandwich, Sonoran Hot Dog, normal french fries and sweet potato fries.  Everything was eaten...quickly!

Reviews:
Mahi Mahi - very flavorful and good proportion of fillings in the flour tortilla, the negative was that the serving of Mahi was really small.  The spices were good.
Pulled Pork - ridiculous good was the unanimous review.  The BBQ sauce on the pork was sweet but not overpowering.  The bun itself was delicious and the crispy onions on top added great texture.
Sonoran Hot Dog - really good.  We laughed out loud that a Kosher hot dog was wrapped in bacon but he said it tasted great.  The cheese, crispy onions and sauce flavors all combinded nicely.  The bun was tasty and strong enough to hold all of these messy ingredients without falling apart.
Sweet Potato Fries - they were not crispy, there were just the right size and cooked through for the cut and season correctly.  One of the tasters that is strictly a crispy-sweet-potato-fry kind of person said that she really like the texture and flavor.
French Fries - great!  It was a treat to have something deep fried and salty for my lunch rather than the normal leftovers I'm used to.  

Since lunch time, we've all decided that we will try it again next week and have recruited a couple more co-workers to join us.   

One thing exciting is that all of the burgers can be substitued with a Vegan Boca burger.  It is great to see more eating facilities, stationary or not that are offering choices for persons that do not consume animal products.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,0,0,4,AhyBWa1G2zuHXszRieGHSg

The tandoori chicken sandwich was delightful. The chicken was juicy and well-marinated and the chutny was pungent yet sweet. The bun was grilled and was somehow old-fashioned in appearance. 

I also ordered a BBQ cheddar & bacon cheeseburger for my husband. The burger was damn tasty and the bacon was crispy and generous. We shared an order of sweet potato fries, but in hindsight we should have purchased two orders because they were so yummy. I couldn't figure out the flavors, but it seems like the fries may have a light batter or coating on them that make them different from other sweet potato fries.

This is the sort of food that makes you raise your eyebrows in surprise after the first bite, then say ""mmmm"" after your second bite. After your fourth or fifth bite, you may look around and wonder who ate all of your food. 

Not only was the food awesome, the service was FAST. There were at least three people in front of me, and I was prepared to wait thirty minutes. I waited 5 minutes and I almost fell over from the shock. I made a comment about this to the chef and he responded, ""well, this isn't our first rodeo.""

A few minutes later, I began pondering this: WHY DON'T MORE PLACES MAKE CALAMARI TACOS? The thing was so amazing. With Cojita cheese as well, a cheese that's rare in Mexican food around these parts.

1986829,2011-09-07,11,5tzNOeow197qn-a0tUJdVA,"Curbside Cafe recently took out a restraining order against me because I was stalking them all over town.  Any time I came across their food truck, I started applauding loudly and repeatedly telling them that I love them.  

What inspired this level of obsessiveness?  Spice and seasoning in a food truck.  Hot damn, it's good.  

Their Mahi Mahi tacos are brilliant--pan fried fish that's still flaky and coated in rich seasoning.  Here's the best compliment I can give those tacos: I don't like fish and I usually won't touch fish unless it's deep fried, but I order the Mahi Mahi tacos almost every time I hit up this truck.  First, because the fish tastes great in the seasoning they cook it in.  Second, because the salsa blanca that they use as a topping is fired-up and sweat-inducing spicy.  It's just a great taco with wonderful flavors on top of crisp cabbage and a fresh flour tortilla.   

And the only thing that steers me away from the tacos is their burgers.  I love a good burger, but the big question is always will the kitchen over cook the ground beef patty.  And that's where Curbside Cafe completely earned me as their official stalker--serving me a perfectly-cooked, medium-rare patty.  I order the Baja burger repeatedly and they pump out my burger order to go with a patty topped in fried jalapenos, their excellent salsa blanca and fresh pico.  So good that I'd put Curbside Cafe on the list of top burgers in Vegas. 

They're also serving up some excellent sweet potato fries.  While I know sweet potatoes have been the rage for a few years now, Curbside Cafe adds a little something extra to the mix.  I'm pretty sure I tasted bown sugar and salt on my order.  Whatever it is, I'm sold.

I just love them soooooo much.  I have an entire wall of my room devoted to Curbside Cafe and I'm pretty sure that if I just keep coming back to the truck, they'll realize they love me.  And one day they might lift that restraining order.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,7,6,5,sREJ3kOrgqXjRHkxq5wsCw

2688772,2015-12-09,2,5tzNOeow197qn-a0tUJdVA,"What a disappointment.  Curbside Cafe was one of three vendors (two food and one coffee truck) at the recent Vegas Valley Comic Book Festival.  My wife and I love food trucks, the food looked and smelled great, so we went up to order.  Here's what happened:

The Service.  There was a man (presumably the owner or manager) taking orders beside the truck, then passing them inside to the cook.  He was all attitude, and it wasn't a good one.  I started to ask about the hot dogs and he mumbled some sort of snarky answer that I literally couldn't understand.  It put me off enough that I went from wondering if I could get a dog to not caring to hear what his problem was.  I heard other customers ask about hot dogs as well while I waited for my order, and eventually heard him state clearly that he ""wasn't allowed to serve hotdogs.""  It wasn't clear why.  I'm not a restaurant or food truck owner/operator, but it seems that if you're not serving a significant portion of your menu, you might want to put up a sign so that customers don't keep asking you for things you're not serving.  So burgers it would be.  After we ordered, we sat nearby and I had the chance to watch him interact with other customers.  Totally horrible attitude with absolutely everyone, coming across as if the folks interested in buying something from his truck were an inconvenience at best, and frankly, he seemed annoyed that anyone wanted to order anything.

The Food.  As mentioned, my wife and I had burgers (The Baja and the Bacon Chedder), and my son had chicken tenders...something I didn't see on the menu.  Maybe it was because they weren't allowed to serve hot dogs, but I don't really know.  My son loves tenders though, so this was a great substitute for him.  Both burgers were tasty but the tenders were very overcooked.  My son didn't even eat half of them.  I tired them but didn't like them at all either.  The meals came with fries, but it looked like the cook made one order then attempted to split them between our burgers and tenders:  about enough fries that I'd consider them something more akin to what should have been a free sample.  This was probably a good thing since they were below average.  Other than being hot, they were almost flavorless.

The Price.  The food, even the burgers, were way overpriced for what we got.  Again, the burgers were tasty: frankly better than average.  The chicken was horrible and as mentioned, the fries were sample-sized.  I get the impression the proprietor had either jacked the prices up, assuming he had a captive audience, or we just happened to hit his worst business day ever.  The most we should have paid for what we got was half of what we were charged.

The only reason Curbside gets a two-star review from me is the burgers were truly tasty.  Otherwise this would be a one-star review.  Sadly, it was a bad enough experience I probably won't give Curbside another visit.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,2,2,qHmjKf4Wteca5qY3ebCAZw

They're just the perfect combination of spicy and rich thanks to that sauce.  If there's anything the owner of this truck knows it is fish so don't hesitate to get any of his tacos even if calamari strikes you as odd.  You won't be disappointed.  

The last time I ate from their truck was at Vegas Streats and luckily for me it was quick, although I definitely wouldn't mind seeing his truck get more business, it's just his truck usually isn't where people would go for them.

Restaurant quality burger at the price of fast food place that comes from a truck, you can't get any better than that. Well worth your money because Curbside Cafe is the same price as its fellow competitors, but the burgers here are bigger. Fries are only additional $1. Try this truck out! You will not be let down.

i cannot believe how good their burgers are. Seriously. First of all, they are beautiful. So pretty, you almost don't want to eat it. Their classic cheeseburger is topped with cheddar, fried onion straws, romaine lettuce, and a fresh tomato. The buns are a yellowy brioche, and taste freshly baked. 

Their fries were good too. The service was super friendly and fast. I hope i run into this truck again. This is, so far, my favorite burger in Vegas- and that's saying a lot with all the great burgers we have in this city!",6TSQGF2-pSITBb9aXVCNAA,0,0,5,AUuVHPkay6SCgfYQygHXmw
3993289,2012-02-04,2,5tzNOeow197qn-a0tUJdVA,"I had the misfortune of trying this food truck at the South Point Food Turck Fest. It had the shortest line, and I now know why. Curbside Cafe completely loses the concept of a food truck: inexpensive food, quickly. 

They charge $7 - $9 for their burgers and fries are $1 - $2 more depending if you get sweet potato fries or not. That isn't bad, if you were in a restaurant or fast food chain. Instead, consider you're standing out in the cold, no waiter service, doesn't include a drink, and there is a diesel genny humming loudly in the background, then it becomes pricey. Their gimmick, their excuse, to charge so much is that they use angus beef and you get a fresh baked rolls for the burgers. 

Okay, I can kind of see that, but what is their excuse for charging $4 for a hot dog? A plain hot dog on a bun, no truffle oil, no artisanal mustard, no bacon, tomatoes, nothing....just a fried hot dog. Looking into the truck you can see they get their supplies from Costco, aren't their hot dogs like a buck and quarter?!

So onto my order: a sonoran hot dog, or their interpretation of it. It took at least 10 minutes for my order to be finished. I was flabbergasted. Watching them work, they take care of each customer in the order they come in. So if someone ordered a hamburger, they will wait for that burger to finish before moving onto the next order. So a sonoran hot dog, something that should have been inexpensive and quick turned into an expensive and slow meal. When I actually got my order, it was drowning in sauce with not that much pico de gallo. The pepper jack cheese was mildly spicey and the onion strings were ice cold. 

Can I get a refund of my money and wasted time please?",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,2,1,1,kiyhSODNrahi60k7bRYPTQ

Honestly, the only reason why we decided to grab dinner from Curbside Cafe rather than any of the other food trucks was because there was no line for Curbside Cafe. With that in mind, I didn't really have high expectations for my burger. I decided to get the bacon cheddar burger, which comes with sweet barbecue sauce in it and a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were good but nothing special but the burger was delicious and I'm not usually a big fan of burgers. The Angus beef was cooked perfectly and the onion strings in the burger gave it a nice finish.

However, I am usually in a foul mood when I am leaving the courthouse or it is too early for lunch.  I got stuck in court the other day.  Boo!  But that meant I was downtown at 12 and perfectly positioned to try Curbside Cafe. Yay!

I ordered 4 Shrimp tacos and 2 mahi mahi tacos (not all for me, I swear!).  The blackened spices were perfect, not too bitter, which can be a problem with blackened anything.  Shrimp was smaller but juicy.  Same for the mahi mahi.  It was on the small side but full of flavor and totally felt like I got my money's worth.  The best part was the crisp cabbage and dressing drizzled over the taco.  Price was very reasonable as well.  Can't wait to try some of their burgers.

I wasn't expecting much from a random food truck, but after reading the menu, this place wasn't messing around. It had some legit food; not just some standard run-of-the-mill snack bar food. They had a wide range of wraps, tacos, hot dogs, salads and custom burgers (ranging from Hawaiian burgers, turkey to boca). Prices weren't bad either. For $5, I walked out with two generously sized blackened mahi mahi tacos, which were awesome. I should have added some sweet potato fries for an extra $1, but I guess that'll be for another time.

The only downside is walking through the scalding heat to reach this place. There's no AC around, so your best bet is to arrive by car and eat carside with the AC blaring. For the most part, the truck seems to be stationed mainly across the street from UNLV at the car wash lot. Occasionally, there is a special occasion that needs to be catered to, but I see the truck here fairly often. I check up on their Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Las-Vegas-NV/Curbside-Cafe/129298443760458) to get a good update on schedules and locations.

If you see this place, definitely stop by to try it. Sure, there isn't as much buzz around this truck as there is with the Slider Truck or Fuku Burger, but the food is definitely up there to keep coming back to.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,2,2,4,tBwJlVJcTyMMYfT7P2Hfbw

I am really enjoying the NEW #streetfood trend taking place here in #Vegas....I guess after KogiBBQ in LA blew up last year restauranteurs are starting to think mobile foodtruck are a real alternative to traditional sit down restaurants.

Valentine's/Haterade Day has nothing on Snow Ono!

Anyway, this is about Curbside Cafe. I tried their Blackened Mahi Mahi taco and their Calamari taco. It's only $5 for both. What a great deal! They are ridiculously delicious and a great size. In fact, the mahi mahi is dangerously close to not fitting inside that double tortilla. Yum, yum, and YUM!

Usually with food trucks, I wait until I try more items before I give a five. I don't see a point with Curbside. It saves me from having to update my review after I try more items.

The fried jalapenos, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, everything came together like mosh pit a a KISS concert and fires flare out of the stage. It rocked my world, it was awesome. The fries were a nice plus as well. $1 for what can be considered a Small at McD.
