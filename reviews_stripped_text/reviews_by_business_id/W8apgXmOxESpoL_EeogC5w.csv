70420,2015-07-08,1,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Family and I went to Las Vegas to take the kids to M&M's store and watch a show. We've been to Las Vegas many times and getting tired of the expensive but not worth your money food at the hotels so I searched on yelp for ramen restaurants, there I found fukumimi ramen restaurant.

We love eating ramen and for us that lived in Japan for two years, we had so many experience on eating different kinds of ramen. 

The restaurant is tiny but clean and organize. We were greeted right away when we got inside. The servers are very attentive and prompt. They got our order right away and didn't have to wait long to get what we ordered. 

My husband ordered the Kara miso, I ordered the tan tan men, we also ordered the chicken karage and classic ramen for our kids, and lastly my mom orders their chashu rice. We enjoyed the very tasteful broth of ramen, and our kids loved their food. 

We often eat ramen in the Bay Area but last night was the first time I've heard my husband said ""this is the best ramen I've ever had in a long time"" and for that, I thank you fukumimi for serving delicious ramen. 

We will definitely coming back if we are in Las Vegas.",9CwY5HXlm9yRoeUfy-DBjA,0,0,5,RrgUhPWtGpJj_9lPa4dk2w

207098,2013-02-01,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Sorry Monta, I've found a new lover and its name is Fukumimi. 

The best tonkotsu ramen I've tried so far in Vegas is made at this modest establishment, located in a mostly-dead strip mall. The broth is marvelously rich and flavorful. The noodles are perfectly cooked, not too firm nor soggy and absorb the noodle base's flavor. The egg is amazingly seasoned and I've never had a yolk that was so buttery and rich. The chashu is a bit thicker than at Monta's, cooked to the perfect level of tenderness. You can appreciate the meat and its slow-cooked flavor in your mouth instead of just instantly falling apart as soon as you bite into it. At times I sort of wish they served menma instead of bean sprouts but its by no means a detractor to the ramen. 

The spicy ramen isn't necessarily ""spicy"" - I think the heat is there to mainly enhance the soup base and it doesn't mask the other flavors in the soup. 

I easily get full on a bowl of ramen (or any entree) so I don't usually get side dishes/appetizers when I eat out. Fukumimi, though, does offer a stamp card and offers free karaage after four ramen visits (and served to you on your fifth), so I ended up trying that. It was definitely not what I was expecting, the fried chicken was deliciously seasoned, the dark meat tender and juicy and the grey salt provided on the side gave the dish more punch. Wasn't a big fan of the dressing on the greens that came with the chicken, but my boyfriend really liked it, so there you go.

You'll need to ask for additional condiments if you like to add seasonings to your dish, since they're not provided on the tables. Interestingly at Monta I often reach for their condiments and use most of them in my ramen, but here I don't find myself missing them - for me, the ramen is that good as it is. Decor is minimal and clean. Sort of wish it was a bit more warm rather than plain plywood but whatever, we're here for food not lodging. Service is a-ok, no complaints there.

Long: ""Not as good as Monta Ramen, better than Sora"" -- is the best I can say of this place. Monta Ramen, IMO, is one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Being not as good, is a great compliment from me. 
The waitress was prompt, but we got our ramen before our Karaage--which is a bit odd, and made me think if she didn't get out order out right. Service was quick, but it also wasn't very busy that day.
I ordered Tonkatsu ramen with a side of Karaage to split. Ramen noodles were good; side-toppings were average (can't do much with them otherwise); the broth was good--but just not as rich as Monta ramen's. While also you only get a single slice of Chashu pork (unless you order extra, or go for a more expensive bowl of ramen). Karaage was to be expected (and served with a simple salad); chicken thighs fried and served hot. They came with a side of salad. But, there wasn't much flavor to the karaage. I couldn't taste much other than chicken, breading, and salt--while good, just kinda lacking in the ginger and soy sauce aspect of karaage.

We also had the spicy tonkatsu, and that's a nice change of pace from the normal soups.  Not exceedingly spicy, but just enough for a tingle and a slight sweat.  Excellent stuff!

Definitely going back to try the tan tan men next time.  But this is going to be my go to ramen place for now, even though it's a slight drive and in a bit of a ghetto area...",2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A,3,2,5,Y4Y8R0SM1aUbSw63XWO-9w

The kimchi side was uniquely delicious. There is a hint of sweetness, great texture and the spiciness is just right.

The real treat was the karaage. This is quite possibly some of the best karaage I've ever had. The very best was years ago, and my memory may be lying. There is a loyalty system where you get a free karaage side every 4 bowls of ramen ordered. A fantastic deal. I can't imagine ever eating here and not having the karaage.

My 4 year old loved their curry. It had a great taste and wasn't too spicy.

As for the appetizers I would say the gyoza (pork dumplings) and karaage (fried chicken) are my personal favorite. Depending on the traffic the appetizers may be served alongside your main meal.

For those wondering about portions. The bowls are pretty moderate in size and not too small, but if you absolutely need more filling they do offer extra noodles if asked for a buck (you can also ask for more noodles after if you eat them all, and they'll hand you a bowl of 'em to plop right in).

This would have made it more flavorful.

The honey garlic chicken was just ok, nothing really special. I would recommend they cook the chicken to well done then cooking with deep fried batter. And not to just use plan mayo, but to flavor their mayo blended with sweet and spicy chili sauce. I've had this prepared before and it was again more flavorful.

But I know soulful, textured, thoughtful food. And Fukumimi Ramen is serving that in droves. 

SERVICE: Like any restaurant, the experience starts with a greeting. The staff there is wonderful. They are warm, informative, helpful, and even on a busy night, they are willing to make yours a pleasurable experience.  There are not enough places in town that care about how their customers are treated. I like to give my business to those who do.

FOOD: I have never had anything like their broth. It's rich and complex. At my first bite, my taste buds were prepped for a thin, savory broth. But upon tasting what Fukimimi Ramen calls a broth, I had to stop and pause. I actually put my chopsticks and spoon down to reflect. When was the last time a taste of broth gave you pause? Since I had the Fukumimi Ramen I can only speak about its pleasures. Add the noodles, the green onion, the extra pork belly, and the egg to that rich broth and you have a dish to drive all the way to Eastern and Trop to try.  The Fukumimi and the karaage are spectacular.  The karaage is a salty, tender, perfectly fried piece of chicken.  But all of its crunchy pleasures could not take away from that ramen dish.  And three cheers for their portion sizes. It was a joy not to be swimming in ridiculous amounts of uneaten food after my meal.

THE REVELATION: The egg. I don't know if theirs is completely unique, but it was certainly unique to me. It is officially my favorite egg. I unsuccessfully tried to coax a secret out of the chef. All I know is this: I could eat that soy sauce flavored egg every day of my life. Every day. They are magic. I need to find out if there is a dish that is focused on eggs there. The eggs are that serious for me.

TIPS: They have a frequent visitor card that entitles you to a karaage (I believe) after a few visits. Also, they have  small space, so you might want to pop in at an off time to ensure you get the experience during a quiet time. They get some traffic in the evenings.  Don't let the neighborhood keep you away. It's in a working class area that is located next to a busy street (Trop)--no need to pull up and be concerned.  

They've been open for a little over a week, and I've been back three times. I know people are excited about getting the gyoza going, but there is so much to love there that foodies will never miss it.  

I plan to add this to my place to my regular rotation. Their location next to a Baskin and Robbins may become an issue this summer, but luckily I leave so satisfied that ice cream isn't even a consideration.  At least not on a chilly November night.

They deserve every one of those five stars. This place is outstanding.  Even if they never give me the secret of the egg.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,12,10,5,p7LMj2AjuCS9iw3senqjwA

Hubby ordered TanTan Men.  He scoffed it down, and raved about it.  I had the Fukumimi ramen.  Really liked it, but could have cared less for the 3 large sheets of nori.  It already had seaweed oil, but I suppose it is a personal preference.  The chashu was delicious.  The bean sprouts could be cooked less, I like mine just blanched... my only real complaint.  

Our table (by the entrance) was wobbly, and so was my chair.  Figured there was a slope on the concrete floor.  Hubby broke a ohashi to correct the wobbliness, so table now no longer wobbles, just on slight angle with the floor So if you happen to sit by the window table, and notice the slant, that's my hubby's 'workmanship':)   

Yuki, our server, presented us with a 'stamp' card... eat 4 bowls=choice of free karaage or gyoza.   Novel idea. Per Yuki's recommendation, we will definitely to try the karaage.  She claims that it's better than KFC.   Will definitely return.  Be warned though, restaurant is narrow, and with limited seating, like Monta.

The restaurant itself isn't too large, it literally looks like a storefront imported directly from the heart of Tokyo, which made the ambiance a part of the experience. When a small place is crowded, that's how you know it's good. 

Me and my friend both ordered Ramen with a side dish, I got chicken ramen with kimchi on the side, he got porkbelly ramen with dumplings, they have specific names I just don't recall them haha. Anyways, the service was very quick for being so busy, we got all of our orders including the ramen in what must've been no longer than 5 minutes. 

The ramen came in this giant and traditional looking bowl, steaming at the top. First of all, the noodles were something else. They were the perfect consistency, not falling apart to the touch, but not hard enough to choke on. I could tell they were homemade, which is a big plus for me. The broth was bursting with flavor, and of course the chicken, egg and bean sprouts all made the meal feel authentic and delicious. The dumplings were perfectly seared on one side, and soft on the other with well seasoned meat inside. The kimchi was no push over either, spicy and zingy without being over powering.

And overall the prices were very good. I would definitely recommend this place, not even to anyone who likes ramen specifically, but to anyone who likes good food with fast service and a great ambiance.",29uiHJtIAK3o6leDkTU-2Q,1,1,5,VWOPji1Yc_vuX-38ktRnxQ

My friend and I would come to Fukumimi regularly and get the tonkotsu with thick noodles. But one day they got our order wrong and gave us thin noodles instead of thick. We were really craving for our thick-noodled meal, so we asked if it would be possible to get the right noodles. What happens next is we both get a haphazardly made soup; yes, it came with the thick noodles we requested, but the pork was crumbled and the toppings messily placed. We didn't think anything of it, but later that night and following day, we both had a bad case of diarrhea, stomach aches, and one of us even threw up a few times. 

We are sad to have had this experience because they made very tasty and flavorful ramen, but we think that it's more than just a coincidence that we both got sick after asking for them to correct our order.

Karamiso ramen (5stars)- fragrant rich broth. I had them put the spicy paste on the side so I could stir in the spice to my liking. It comes with thick noodle but you can get thin if you prefer. I myself prefer the chewy thick noodles. 

Gyoza (5stars) - comes with 6 pieces and these are pan fried. I believe the meat inside the dumplings were pork. Anyways quite delicious. 

Tip make sure to get a stamp card. For every 4 bowls of ramen you buy you get a free appetizer of your choosing. These add up quick!",c55ONBsSZBfaUN5Uhy-qGw,1,0,5,ISAGAZj85eWi0DYugun6sQ
1309584,2012-12-04,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"During the cold winter of Nevada, I like a nice bowl of ramen to keep warm, but driving all the way to Chinatown is such a hassle. When I heard of a new ramen place opening closer to Henderson, I had to try it. Sadly, though, it just didn't hit the spot.

I came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy, I'd say half filled. There are probably around 20 or so seats, so not a terribly large place but it is cozy. They were quick to seat us, but they were a bit slow to take our order. We started with the Karaage then I ordered the Tan Tan Men and my boyfriend had their Tonkotsu Salt Ramen. The wait for the food wasn't too long, and we were sitting at the bar so it was fun watching them prepare the food.

Karaage - I thought this was the best part of the meal. It was lightly breaded and nicely fried without being too oily. The chicken was still moist and very flavorful. It came with some salt on the side in case you wanted that extra sodium. There was also a little side salad with a tasty dressing, my guess is ginger miso. 

Tan Tan Men - I was pretty disappointed with this. The initial bite was good, but as I continued to eat it, I liked it less and less. The broth was too creamy and thick, and when I'm at a ramen place, I love to drink the soup. But this is not a soup to just sip on with the noodles, it's more of a thin gravy. Also, the flavor just seemed off, similar that musty flavor of bamboo shoots? I just wasn't a fan of it.

Tonkotsu Salt Ramen - It comes with black garlic oil, but I think it could have used a little more. The broth was decent, it had a fairly well developed flavor. I just didn't like that it was so fatty. I know Tonkotsu has lots of pork fat in it, but this one just seemed to have a thick layer of oil on top of the soup. I could just feel it coating my intestines. Another thing is that they're a little stingy with the meat, there was only one piece of char siu. I will say that I liked the egg though. It was perfectly runny, but it was only room temperature at best. 

Overall, the ramen was decent, but I would not get the Tan Tan Men. I'm not jumping out of my seat to come here again, but if I really have to have my ramen fix and am not willing to drive out to Chinatown, this place will do.",-LEJFq5RC0rQAG831uYRKg,1,1,3,Tz5NfA22mZ8a07JEK4dP6w

Giving me an excuse to check it out, I went down there last night. I had the Tantan Men and my girlfriend had the Miso Ramen. 

The Tantan Men was good: a decent blend of savory and spice. My only negative critique might be that the broth was actually almost a bit too rich. The pork broth thickened with chili oil and beef fat made a very sturdy base that I was not expecting. It was a good meal, but be prepared for something richer than other ramen varieties if you order it. 

As stated, my girlfriend had the Miso ramen, and she was very complimentary of the meal. She enjoyed the flavor of the broth and noodles, as well as the corn and soft-boiled egg.

The portions are great in my opinion. Not much experience with ramen shops but their food is enough to fill me up completely. Prices are cheap. Flavor is wonderful. The meat in the ramen just falls apart which is great so you can break it up and have some meat in every bite!

 I ordered the miso ramen. The broth was thick and packed with intense flavors, the noodles were soft and chewy, the slices of pork also soft as butter. It all was gone in a matter of minutes. Left me wondering if it had actually been real, but the empty bowl, the bill on the table and my hunger gone, confirmed it all. I had just had a bowl of awesomeness. 
 The place is small but very inviting, the simplicity of the design a very common Japanese characteristic gives it the feel of authenticity, as well as the majority of customers at that time. Koreans? Japanese? I don't know..all I know is that this Mexican was enjoying his noodles like everyone else in the building. For one brief  tasty moment in time, we were all speaking the same ramen language. slurp! slurp! slurp! 
There are also other items on the menu that I had never had before like tantanmen which is what I will try next time I visit, or karaage, or curry.... I can't wait to head east!

The chicken karage is just as delicious, and I honestly do not know how they are able to fry the chicken so delicately and keep it ultra-juicy.  Waitstaff is always awesome and pleasant.

I actually host my first UYE (pre UNLV game) on 2/20/13 here and sooooo glad I did! 

We had a party of 9 or 10 and the service was fast and the young lady was super sweet!

I started off by ordering the table several orders of edamame and kimchi. 
The edamame was piping hot and salted.
I'm really glad I ordered both because for some reason this is my new fav kimchi! I must go back and buy a whole bunch! 

VEGETARIANS BEWARE! They do not have any veggie options. :) 
I'm not strict so I chose to get the Tori Ramen (chicken broth) with no egg and no chicken. WOW! It was really good! The broth was perfect not too oily and not too salty. I really liked the noodles how they were thin and a little firm. I ordered add seaweed to mine but I think she/they forgot to add it oh well :)
They are famous for their pork based broth but I strictly do not eat pork so that was totally out. 

All and all it was a super great spot and a super great UYE of sweet new Yelp friends. I def need to take hubby here before it starts turning very hot and non soup yummy weather :)

1438063,2012-11-29,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"New ramen place in town located on the NE corner of Tropicana and Eastern, next to the Baskin Robbins. Seem like a typical ramen-ya. 

Typical japanese greeting upon entrance, seated quickly. Came to the restaurant on a Wednesday evening around 530ish. There was maybe 2 other parties there aside from us. If my memory serves me correctly, this used to be a different japanese restaurant that was based on sushi before. 

The restaurant is a brightly lit restaurant with a row of bar seats facing the kitchen, and a row of tables with chairs on one side and a long extending wood bench on the opposite side. 

Service, the waitress was nice to get our waters. But seemed to like hover around waiting for us to order (which was a little weird). 

They had two soup broths (mainly pork [tonkotsu]) but they had a chicken [tori] option. The tonkotsu based ramen's consisted on a salt, soy, miso, spicy, and their special Fukumimi ramen. Each their own style. I believe they all use the same type of ramen noodles (thin straight noodles, very similar to the ones at Monta). Prices are fairly average ranging from $7.50 for the salt and soy tonkotsu, $8.20 for the miso or spicy option, or $9.50 for their special fukumimi ramen that i believe has extra meat. The chicken ramen is similar to the salt tonkotsu ramen except its a ""creamy rich chicken soup base"" and also had the garlic oil. There is options for extra toppings at additional cost. Didnt see an option for extra noodles though. They also had two other ramens, one was tantan men and the other was tomato ramen (cold). uhh if i remember correctly, tantan men is not a ramen, also in fact, its a dry noodle. Very interesting. 

My friend and I had ordered salt (me) and soy (her). Another party had seated next to us. Apparently the waitress got confused on the orders and asked our table what we had gotten and see if it matched the order she had (but found out was the other table). When the food had come, she went to their table and asked them before figuring out it was for our table. Uh.. Lol.. i thought she had that figured out? guess not.

Now for the food. Soup base was ok. Can't figure out if i like it or not. Initially when the ramen had came, i had tried both soup bases from mine and my friends. one salt base, one soy based.. One was saltier than the other but me and my friend had opposing opinions. Both our ramens had one slice of pork, 1/2 a soft boiled egg, some pickled ginger, onions, and bean sprouts.. The thing that was different was mine had this black garlic oil vs hers had a piece of nori. 

Honestly, i couldnt taste the ""original fragrant garlic oil"" it mentions. yah i see it but i dont think its as fragrant as it may seem to be. Another thing we had noticed was all the tables, except the bar, did not have any seasoning items. Not even the basic ones you see like chili pepper or chili oil.. or sesame seeds.. Was kind of surprised. 

The pork was more lean in comparison to what you get at Monta. Wished they had left the pickled ginger as a side u can put yourself instead of it being in the bowl already. 

The place isnt bad. Price is average. Good for students at UNLV. Nearby ramen place, dont have to drive to chinatown.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,4,b4wJbo7an1SzayBTwAZXbA

FOOD
I ordered the Kara-miso Ramen (Spicy Miso) with thick noodles. By its appearance, the broth looks spicy but it was not as spicy as I thought it would be. Compared to other ramen places in Las Vegas the broth is actually spicy, other places just put a ton of spicy powder to make it ""spicy"". The ramen I ordered came with pork belly chashu, seasoned eggs, green onion, and sprouts PLUS corn (Kara-miso came with corn, what a bonus and it's delicious).

They have one of the best ramen in Vegas. They have one of the best karaage. They have one of the best cold noodle.

What's lacking is the finishing touch in the noodles - namely, the softness of the noodle.

If you are crazy about ramen, you might know that there are more than six grades of softness / hardness of noodles when you order ramen in Japan: soft, regular, hard, barikata, harigane and konaotoshi.

It gets harder as you get to the end of the list - in Japanese, barikata means ""very hard"", ""harigane"" means steel wire, ""konaotoshi"" means ""just drop the powder"". As ridiculous as it sounds, those resolution in texture preference is for real in highly matured culture like Japanese cuisine. It's almost like the endless arms race of megapixels in digital cameras. And as you can clearly see, the grade is completely skewed toward hard noodles. Yes, it's true that hardcore ramen aficionados have the tendency to enjoy harder noodles.

But at Fukumimi, even ordering ""very hard"" specifically, brings disappointingly soft noodles.

I really hope they will address that particular issue, then I'll bump to five stars.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,5,2,4,dYUIoTZ_qqzGILo-Oh27TA

I ordered ahead, adding an egg and green onion.  It was ready when I got there to pick it up, and it was packaged with consideration and regard knowing a little time & travel pass before consuming.  The broth and the other ingredients (spicy pork, bok choy, ramen noodles, egg, and green onion) were in two separate containers.

Back at the office, I combined the broth with the ingredients, stirred gently, and enjoyed the savoriness of this dish.  The broth is a juxtaposition of slight creaminess and a hint of spiciness as the spicy pork slowly & chili oil slowly become fused.  Like a good wine, it actually became better as I tasted, mixed, and tasted again.  A generous serving of green onion and perfectly cooked ramen noodles topped off a remarkable broth.

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant clean and simple yet modern. I opted for the tonkotsu miso with extra side of chashu. Jaime went with their Tan tan ramen. My ramen was okay, the pieces of chashu were extremely fatty and falling apart. The broth was very salty without much flavor. I finished my bowl as I felt it was okay, not return worthy, but not gag worthy either. Jaime left practically entire bowl untouched. We also had a side of chicken kaarage of which I could not eat more than one small piece. The meat was just so fatty and poor quality while also drenched in grease.

The couple next to us with whom we struck up a conversation were not pleased with their food either, and left their bowls practically untouched. Maybe it was just a bad morning?

Now I know that 101 ways to make ramen doesn't qualify me as the noodle connoisseur, but compared to others noodle houses I've tried, hands down, Fukumimi rocks!  

Location: End corner of strip mall on Eastern/Tropicana ..plenty of parking spaces. A big plus for those of us whose home base is here in Henderson.  
 
Service/Atmosphere - A - The restaurant staff enthusiastically greeted us in Japanese as we stepped inside.  It was almost a full house when we arrived during the dinner hour, but we were seated right away. The hostess also did double duty as our server.  Friendly and pretty efficient considering how busy the place was. The small dining area was simple interior, single seating at the high top top counter facing the kitchen and tables of two lined back against the wall set close together. So close that nosy me got to see and question the party next to me on what dish she ordered that looked so good, which was the Fukumimi ramen.
 
Food:  A+  - Prices: fair most under $10

We ordered the Fukumimi Ramen, Karaage & Curry/rice bowl. 

Both Karaage & Curry bowl were very good, for the low price hard not to pass up either.

The Fukumimi - THE BEST!! This order is pretty large portion. The bowl width is average size, but deep in depth. It looked like a gourmet bowl of ramen, a pretty visual presentation. Seaweed lined half of the bowl filled with hot and steamy broth.  The tonkotsu (pork) broth ; perfect! It was packed with flavor, had a brown milky color, rich and creamy.  The thin noodles were delish and cooked to the right texture. Toppings: slices pork belly, tender, 1/2 of soft boiled egg, sprouts added some crunch and the scallions boosted the flavor even more. I want to say it's garlic infused oil, black in color that was drizzled on top as well.  This was such a delicious hearty meal.

This place is most definatley yummy for your tummy!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,10,10,5,RsgxdFkdaIqJZq4qcrY7qg

Food.. I had one of their ramens.. it was a bit too salty for me so I didnt end up finishing it. Honestly, I've had better for around the same price but with a bigger bowl, meaning more food. 



All in all, the experience was okay. But It's definitely not a restaurant that I would ever go back to.

1828753,2013-02-26,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Finally a Ramen place on the east side!! I'm really excited since this place is so close to where I live!

Ok before anything else I just want to say that there is an old lady server that works here, and I think she hates me. I've been here twice and was treated with the same discourteous attitude. I tipped her $5 each time in hopes of a smile but to no avail...

Now that I got that off my chest it's down to business.

Fukumimi is known for their Tan Tan Men, (a spicy, very rich ramen) and their flaky karaage (fried battered chicken tenders that is a perfect match to your warm bowl of ramen). 

Lets start of with the noodles. Just like Monta Ramen House, they serve their ramen with firm noodles, I personally prefer Sapporo style noodles since it's more chewy, but there's nothing wrong with Fukumimi's straighter and firmer noodles.

The base of the Tan Tan men is hot and tasty. I had no problem slurping down their savory and slightly spicy ramen until I reached 3/4 of the bowl, at that point I was overwhelmed by its richness. Now I'm the kind of person who gets the XL bowls and order side dishes all over the table, yes that's me, but on this occasion, it was just a bowl of ramen and a side of karaage, but with just that I was already feeling heavy.

It's a well known fact that you can't have a bowl of hot ramen (in america) without chasu pork (those thinly sliced marinated braised pork bellies that melts in your mouth as you sip your steaming bowl of ramen).  Also adding a Tamago  (24 hour marinated hard boiled egg) with every ramen bowl wouldn't hurt.

Summary:

Noodles: Firm noodles
Ramen Base (Tan Tan Men):  Mild, Tasty, and Heavy
Chasu pork: Thicker cut than usual, and not melt -in-your-mouth like Monta's
Karaage: Chicken is tender, and Batter is nice and flaky. 
Soboro Bowl: Bland, and not satisfying
Service: Just Ok",VkUNno5rJqPExJVpD2olcA,3,0,3,vLu9fXDsy-VKU8aMMIZ3ug

1893037,2014-04-26,4,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"I fell in love with ramen when I lived in the Bay area last year, and so far of our slim pickings, Sora is the place I prefer. I found myself on the other side of town, and finally managed to fit in a trip to Fukumini, which is the third most-often-recommended place for ramen in Vegas (the second being Monta).

Despite the strip mall exterior, inside was small and cozy with bench seating and bar seating. I dined solo and was helped immediately. Staff was attentive. There is signage up advertising their limited-time summer special of cold noodles, as well as a new flavor of chicken: honey garlic, which sounded amazing but I was dining alone.

Ordered the tan tan men, for change of pace. Received a gigantic bowl of broth, bok choy, noodles, and sausage- the sausage was actually reminiscent of chorizo, full of fat and flavor and that distinctive orange tinge to the broth. The broth itself was super rich, and seems like it may have contained dairy. Noodles were chewy and thick, the way I like them. My only adjustment to this order in the future would be to add more bok choy- the three leaves in my dish simply were not enough to balance out the richness and fat in the sausage and broth.
Overall flavor profile was complex, with spice from the sausage, and again, very rich.

Later, this richness caused some stomach problems for me- consider yourself warned.
It's a tasty dish, with friendly service, but I'll probably stick with one of their more regular ramen dishes next- and try that chicken.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,4,3,AwACjs2Jq728wsH3iWPLIA

Walked in to see a small, intimate restaurant with a couple of tables. We ate during off-peak hour but I can imagine it gets crowded quickly. My 3 friends and I were seated right away and started with chicken karaage and agedashi tofu as appetizers. Both were really good! The chicken was super juicy and crisp. Although we couldn't tell if it was the red light from the store sign reflecting off the meat or if it was slightly undercooked- we just ate it because it was tasty. 

I ordered the Tan Tan, which did not fulfill my ramen craving. It was a little too creamy for me, with a peanut aftertaste. I normally love all noodles+broth, but this broth didn't hit the spot. My boyfriend really liked it though so we ended up switching our bowls. He ordered the Fukumimi which in my opinion was a lot better. The broth was lighter and I enjoyed it more.

2206276,2012-12-04,4,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"The Skinny: props for using proper Tonkotsu ramen noodles however the flavour of the broth just ain't up the snuff. Their karaage on the other hand is a good portion size and pretty tasty (3) Service: they messed up our order but it turned out okay because we were too full anyway (2) overall: the tonkotsu ramen broth is still subpar but at least decent, toppings are okay and reasonably priced. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was in the neighbourhood and having pregnancy-like cravings for ramen, I'd give this place another shot.(3)

Found out about this place and headed over for nice big bowl of Japanese lovin'.

We ordered a tonkotsu miso ramen ($8.20), fukumimi ramen($9.50), karaage ($3.90) and a curry bowl ($3.90). 

Here is my analysis of the ramen:

The Broth: meh - not enough porky fatty goodness in the broth - on the oink scale, this would rank about a 6/10 scale - detectable but definitely not enough.

The Noodles - kudos for the actual legit tonkotsu noodles (the straight, white noodles). Mildly overdone (I prefer a little more firmness) but definitely gets some marks for this.

Miscellaneous: Chashu - it's okay - not your melt-in-your mouth goodness but decent enough. Egg - good amount of runniness - perfectly cooked. Toppings amount - decent amount given the price.

The karaage was pretty good - nice crispness without too much coating and well seasoned. Very good portion size for the price too. Overall, I think I enjoyed the karaage better than the ramen actually.

We never received our curry bowl (the server forgot to put the order in) but that was okay because we were fairly stuffed after finishing our ramen and karaage. 

To me, what differentiates the true great from a decent ramen place is the broth -- and Fukumimi Ramen definitely wasn't ""lickin' the bowl clean"" kinda good for me. It lacked the soulful perfection from a great ramen joint. That being said, it's okay enough to fill the belly and the karaage was pretty good. For that, it gets a 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,9,5,3,x9-F8hVMzMoYbn1Ini1cOQ

2. This is like a combination of the good stuff from both sora and monta, they have garlic oil as their special spice (sora doesn't have garlic, monta doesn't have thinner miso soup)

3. For people who live near Henderson or the southeast, it is definitely a go to place for them. 

4. I think services are just the same as monta or sora or any other places. it all depends on the mood of the waitresses that day.

2255956,2013-02-15,4,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"In the race to monopolize on the booming ramen fad in Vegas, Fukumimi has created a splash in the ramen-ya scene. 

The quick and dirty: get the Fukumimi Ramen (shio-based). Your taste buds will thank you. 

The long and delectably disgustingly delicious: 
My friend's first reaction to seeing the The Fukumimi Ramen: ""Wtf is that black stuff floating in there?!""
My response: ""It's black garlic oil, noob!"" 
So if any of you guys are hesitant about the layer of questionable black oily liquid floating in your broth, know that it's good for your tummy, your heart, and your soul.

But seriously, I loved the black garlic oil that they put in the broth- only adds more depth to this deceptively simple-tasting broth. It's not as hearty as some tonkotsu broths I've tried in the past, but it still packs a punch taste-wise. Best part of this broth is that it's not overly salty like some other ramen places...*cough* Monta *cough*

The only noodles available here are the thinner egg style noodles that regularly come with tonkotsu ramen. Even though I prefer thick noodles (Ramen Sora!!) the noodles here were perfectly al dente, not soggy at all.

The egg is always perfectly done with the yolk still half runny. Chashu is a bit well done compared to what I prefer. I love when that delicious pork belly melts in your mouth!

Soboro bowl: seasoned minced meat, egg, rice, and green onions. Very simple dish. I felt like this dish was just okay, not really memorable or something I would crave. I'd have liked a bit more of sauce/juice/gravy from the minced meat so it wouldn't be so dry.

Karaage: deep fried chicken. While very juicy and fresh, I felt it was a bit under-seasoned. 

If you intend to come here regularly, make sure you get a stamp card from your server. For every four bowls of ramen, you get a free appetizer: gyoza or karaage.

Overall, great service and a clean restaurant. I'll definitely be coming back for more ramen and to try their other bowls.",EHssES-7rmOl6yFNwXVWiw,7,5,5,WrV_oTRMqnrmGVRYQhqruQ
2261983,2012-11-11,4,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"So another Japanese Ramen-Ya has graced this city and this time, it ain't in Chinatown! (in mini-mall Tokyo)  No this one is on East side by UNLV, where most of the students hang out. In any case, it just opened and once in a while, it's good to break away from the usual haunts (I still love you the best, Monta, but I wanna see what the others have to offer). Monogamy has no place in the F&B world when it comes to this glutton.

Fukumimi means 'Lucky Ear', and when I arrived at an off peak time period, the place was crawling with Japanese people (first good sign).  And the interior had a cheery and warm environment (aka, it actually looked like someone put some thought into it's design...I appreciate that)....good sign #2

I love it when the weather gets cold here, it's the perfect time for a piping hot bowl full of Ramen.  And on a particularly cold day like Saturday, I was running from my car to get into the steam filled restaurant to warm up!

Inside, it's a bright atmosphere with that new restaurant feel (kinda like a new car...didn't want to use the smell reference...)  I was seated at the counter, where I could see all the action.  The owner was working the line, (the Ramen component) while another gentleman worked the fryer, both working furiously to dish out orders.

I parked my seat down a bar stool, hoping to get warm when I realized it was much colder at the counter; they had air vents blowing cold air to counteract all the steam emanating from the open kitchen (I was freezing by the time I left...must remember that I can eat here in the Summer...and not sit at the counter!!!)

So Fukumimi's specialty is Tonkotsu Ramen, a pork bone broth that make the broth thick with a milky consistency that is very filling.  It's accompanied with slices of Pork Belly, Boiled Egg, Bean Sprouts, Corn and Scallions...and Noodles of course....

There are other things on the menu, Chicken Ramen, a cold Tomato Ramen and Tan Tan Men (a spicy Sichuan dish);  as well, there are various Rice Bowls that looked pretty good too.

On the Appetizer list: the Chicken Karage was recommended,  (and at $3.99 for six pieces, it's a bargain) and it came out piping hot.  I loved the crispness of fried skin, followed by a moist bite of juicy chicken flesh that sears the roof of your mouth, as steam billows through the tears-heaven...  Thoroughly enjoyable and worth coming for-a must get item!

And when the boiling, hot cauldron of noodle soup arrived in front of my icicle hanging nose,    I enveloped my face into it's hot breath, inhaling the fatty oils feeding my fifth sense.  I ordered the Miso Tonkotsu, a blend I find most palatable.

My first visual: long, thick slices of Pork Belly cut in the most unusual way to which, I have not seen before in Ramen (not that I'm complaining, I ordered extra Chasu Pork and I practically got the whole bowl full of it - score!!!)

As for the Broth, (the most important component of Ramen in my humble opinion) it was smooth, lighter than I thought, it didn't have that unctuous, almost greasy quality that I anticipate/hope for, then somewhat regret after eating like buyer's remorse.  In this case, I could finish the soup sans regret.

Now with another Ramen Restaurant in the Vegas fold, it's getting very interesting; people will decide their favorites, alliances will be formed, friends will become enemies, families will be torn blah blah blah....  I'm just glad that there's more choices, I already have my favorite list, but that's for another post!

2267335,2012-11-15,2,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Beware of the shape of their bowls!

Hahaha. At least, I think it was the shape of their bowls. At first glance, it seems like any normal bowl of ramen, but as you stop to take a picture, the top of the soup cools down so fast that it becomes this thick goey texture. A quick stir of the broth and it will be gone, only to be back within a few minutes. Not exactly sure what it is... But something tells me it might be oil or some cartilage from the pork bones?

I had the Tonkotsu Ramen (soy), and the flavor of the broth was decent. I wasn't too big of a fan of their noodles (I prefer monta's thicker noodles). My broth came with a slice of pork belly (chashu), half of a seasoned egg, green onions, bean sprouts, and a piece of seaweed.  The pork belly was a really big slice, and had a good proportion of meat and fat.  I would have preferred a whole egg, but since it was included free with the soup, there isn't any complaints there. Everything else was pretty standard. If you wanted any extra toppings (which I did not get), they are available for an EXTRA charge. I say extra in all caps because in my opinion, some of them are a bit pricey.

I went with a friend who ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen (salt) as well as the karaage.  Her broth tasted a bit off, and there were black lines visible throughout. I'm not sure what kind of 'salt' they used, but I guess it was a type of black salt?(Update: I've been told the 'black lines' were from black garlic oil). Looked pretty odd to me. Oh, and her soup also had the thick gooey texture at the top if you let it sit for too long.  As for the karaage, they were pretty standard. Nice and juicy like they should be!

I would definitely be back to try more items on their menu, and I'll update my review then. For now, I give it 3 stars due to the weird thickening of the top of the soup. It wasn't really too appetizing to have to look in your bowl and see a solid layer on the top. =X",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,1,1,3,1Y-WjuROvBq-pVYt7Wp46A

But now I know he appreciates the taste and flavor of ramen soup!

Lets start with the atmosphere, this place is just so cozy! We came here during a rainy day, and of course...I was in need of a ramen fix. Soup always sounds good on a rainy day. It's very limited seating, but you never feel clustered or overpacked when you come here. 

I ordered the fukumimi ramen which consisted of extra pork that was so soft once my teeth got a hold of the meat, seaweed (which I loved), an egg and the ramen noodles. May I add how flavorful the soup was? I felt like I was back in Tokyo! My boyfriend had the spicy miso ramen, which only had one pork meat (I ended up giving him a few of my pork meats, since I had a lot), an egg and the ramen noodles, but also had a spice on top. I got to try his, and if you're down for spicy- this will be good for your taste buds!

I also was hoping to find a good spot for my girlfriend and I to check out.

The ramen itself was satisfying but not amazing. The ground meat on top was served cold. I'm not sure if this is standard but it was a turnoff. But, after mixing into the hot ramen, it was ok. I also ordered it spicy and I could barely taste a hint of spice. The flavor of the broth was nice and buttery though so it was good but not great. 

The service was a little shaky from the start but what really left a bad taste in my mouth was when the server straight up asked if I needed ones for change. And gave them to me anyways and waited for a tip. This killed it for me because one, it wasn't the greatest ramen I've had and two, I really really can't stand when a server EXPECTS a tip. They really didn't do anything other than take my order to the cook. Literally. I know that sometimes servers get stiffed but that's part of the job. To take that out on an innocent CUSTOMER is worse than being stiffed, in my opinion. 

There are a plethora of other ramen shops so I'd rather not deal with the servers again. 

I would not recommend to my friends for the shaky service and the average ramen.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,0,0,2,y5k_mhaxLgO_cpbux1ON_g

It was ok.... the noodles were good but I felt like it wasn't enough. The meat was too chewy for my taste and I felt there was just too much broth to make your bowl look huge.

Fukumimi Ramen isn't that hard to find. It's not that far from the university, airport, strip, and a lot of business areas. It's located in a center on the NE corner of Tropicana and Eastern and just stands out with its funky Fukumimi Ramen sign and red banners in the window. It is however small inside and apparently people don't know how to park outside but there are a lot of parking.

I'm no ramen expert and haven't been to many ""authentic"" Japanese ramen places but Fukumimi Ramen has to be one of the better new ramen places to try.

I'm not here to tell you that Fukumimi is better or worse than the next ramen spot.  I'm here to tell you that I had quite a pleasant experience here, and I would recommend you to come check it out.

A lot of people recommend the tan tan men ramen, but spicy soups are not my style.  I went for the tonkotsu with soy I believe.  There is no menu online for me to confirm the exact name, but I got the soy based one as opposed to miso or salt or a spicier variation.  Chashu, green onion, and corn.  That is all I need.  I didn't feel like it was overly salty like some have mentioned.  I recommend the soy broth if you don't want to be so mainstream, delicious and simple, and more natural it seemed, as opposed to other flavorings.

The karaage is also a perfect appetizer.  It's like getting raisin canes from Japan!! (joke, although I am very fond of the Canes chain).

This restaurant will be successful.  The staff are very sweet and accommodating as well.

The place is kinda small but it never gets so packed to the point where you'd have to wait to be seated or served. Usually when you walk in, or the times I've gone anyway, we're immediately acknowledged by the server and immediately seated. Drinks usually come within the first 5 mins (or less) and our orders taken right away. I like how they don't shout the orders across the room like some ramen places do. I personally feel like thats a little tacky especially if it startles someone. 

Im all about that Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen with extra egg and thick noodles. They serve a generous portion with an almost full bowl of soup. It comes with mushrooms, bambu, green onions, bean sprouts, meat, and everything else you can add on for an extra cost. My favorite thing about this place is how perfectly they cook their half boiled egg and the fact that their soup is not overly salty. If you're not a pork kind of person they also have other selections like the Spicy Miso which is what my bf gets. 

Their chashu bowl is also delicious if you're not interested in eating ramen. Their karaage is cooked to perfection every time but I'm more impressed with the little salad that it comes with. I can eat for days! Im not sure what kind of sauce they have on it but its delicious. Maybe thats something you can order if you're on some kind of healthy streak. 

Love this place! Worth a try especially now that its getting really cold. Also, thank you for the stamp card! We've gotten multiple things for free for how often we come here.",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,2,1,5,cM4kPvensCXjKdookS3cig

They wouldn't let me add tofu since I don't eat meat in my soup so I ended up ordering the agadashi tofu which is where the two stars come into play. It was pretty solid. Also, the noodles were cooked quite well... there was a slight bite to them and not mushy.

I ordered the Tan Tan Men, being a fan of the version at Shuseki.  I have to say, this version was totally different and unexpected!  It had a sort of curry peanut soup base to it, along with chashu and bok choy.  The soup based had a fairly strong peanut flavor to it, and was pretty well balanced.  It wasn't spicy, which might have been a nice touch (I am not sure if it can be ordered spicy or not!).  The chashu was spot on.

The chicken was nice, crispy and extremely juicy on the inside. We both agreed that it was one of the most deliciously juicy chicken we've ever had. Our ramen were both delicious and fresh! The spiciness wasn't enough to get you panting and dripping sweat but it was enough to help clear both our sinuses! The noodles were fresh and had the amazing texture of freshness to it- not too firm but not too chewy and the egg in each of our soups were cooked to perfection! The broth of each soup was rich in flavor and mine had an extremely delicious creaminess to it- you can tell they cooked my broth for awhile to get the soup the way it was!

All of our food came out extremely quickly and the serving size was just right- enough to make you full but enough for you to be hungry for your next meal. Each bowl of ramen was about $7.95 to 8.95 which isn't bad at all for wonderful service and delicious food.

We ordered the fukumimi miso and I had the Kera spicy ramen. It was really good. Grandma ordered the chicken bowl which by the way is super tiny (good thing she has a small appetite). We also order the Japanese style friend chicken and honey garlic chicken.

Starting off with the spicy ramen, the proportion size was good, not too much and not too little. I really liked the taste of the soup but I wasn't a fan of the thick noodles. I enjoyed the boiled egg and the bean sprouts as well. They do include a thin meat in there (I think it's roast pork) that really went well with the soup.

On the other hand, the Japanese fried chicken was super salty! It looked really good but all I could taste was salt.

THE MEAT: I would prefer to eat here at night and without a hangover.  When we went in the afternoon, the sun was beating down the side of the restaurant and we were sweating like pigs (if pigs did sweat).  We had the chicken karaage (not very crispy, but light and very tender), gyoza (wasn't too impressed with the filing), saboro bowl (savory sweet ground meat), chasu bowl (not bad), the tonkatsu salt and tonkatsu miso ramen.  

Normally I would complain about under-seasoning and pour soy sauce over everything, but this tonkatsu salt and miso broths were extremely salty.  The miso was definitely more flavorful than the salt version, and carried a spicy kick.  I didn't care too much for the ginger pieces and bean sprouts in the bowl, but the other elements were perfect - soft noodle strands, an almost cooked egg, thin melt-in-your-mouth chasu, scallions.  I wouldn't mind going back here especially since service is awesome, but for Hakata/Tonkatsu addicts, I'd still bet on Monta (their broth has stronger pork/egg flavors, bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms, Mmm).

I'M STILL DIGESTING... the fact that ramen broth chills to an almost gelatin form in the fridge.  Is there a gelatin component to this dish or is that pure lard?  I'm not so sure I really want to know.

2724924,2016-01-20,6,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Great ramen in Vegas is actually hard to come by but Fukumimi produces a very good product.  I've tried almost everything on their menu without any disappointment.  Their two chicken karaage options, gyoza, and agedashi tofu are the appetizers I would recommend.  All come fairly quickly when ordered, cooked perfectly, and taste great.  I've tried their extra fragrant garlic oil ramen soup, their tantanmen, and various additional types of ramen that they offer here.  All offer that 'just what the doctor ordered' feeling once you taste that first sip.

The star of the shop is none other than their Fukumimi Ramen, a pork-based ramen with thin noodles, seaweed, boiled egg, and an ample amount of pork chashu.  Other additions come with a small charge but may be worth it if you like such items as added corn, extra egg, extra chashu, or bamboo sprouts.  The broth is rich and salty but not over-the-top.  It's definitely soothing to the soul on a cold night but contagiously good that I would even eat it on a hot summer's day.  

I have even ordered to-go for work for myself and all my work colleagues.   The noodles come separately with the pork belly on top and a separate styrofoam container contains the hot broth ready to be poured onto the noodles.  The soup remains just as delicious as ever.  

Service is usually fast, despite the somewhat small and packed establishment.  There's usually an available table in minutes which you cannot say true for places like either Monta location.   Definitely order the Fukumimi if you hadn't had the chance to.  Being a stickler for good ramen, and having had some of the best that California and New York have to offer, I think Las Vegas's Fukumimi ramen can hang with the best of them.

Broth was very flavorful while being relatively light, not thin but not super creamy. We had a fukumimi (pork base, extra chashu, shio I think) and a tori (chicken based). I liked how you could really taste the different flavors in the different  broths. I really enjoyed the broths! Noodles were good and the honey garlic chicken was nice, tender dark meat and it was good too. But, It was the ramen that was the star.
 
Why not 5 stars? Two things-  one, this is minor but although the fatty bits of chashu were delish, the lean bits were a bit... Tough and blah.

Two - I want to be able to drink the soup if it's really yummy... It was, so, We did, and we were super thirsty the rest of the night despite drinking water during and after dinner ( though in Vegas I guess being thirsty is easy to fix....)

Tonkotsu Ramen (Miso) $8.20: Small Portion, it came with corn, green onion, bean sprouts, egg and pork.  It was definitely very tasty.  I really liked it.

Kimchi Tofu ($4):  Now this was very yummy.  It's cold tofu, kimchi, onion, seaweed in an awesome sauce.  Ordering this dish was a nice introduction to this restaurant so I will definitely go back again.

2803674,2016-08-12,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"I came here with high expectation because of Yelp and I gotta say, it was quite disappointing. The service was good. The server women were extremely nice and quick. 

Then came the food. I ordered the Kogashi Ramen ($8.20) which supposedly has good amount of garlic flavor or whatever because of my love for Monta's Kuro Ramen aka black garlic. The bowl was smaller than Monta's, good presentation. The flavor was nothing garlicky or full of aroma like I expected. It was good broth, very peppery, but not good enough. I didn't like the noodles. The SUPER weird thing that I HATED was the addition bean sprout, though it was my fault for not fully read the description. The broth flavor was completely overwhelmed by the bean sprout for me. Extremely tender and flavorful Chashu but the pieces were wayyyyyy to small, almost seemed like they disappeared into the noodles.

My friend got a Fukumimi Ramen ($9.50) and it was the most disappointing bowl of noodles. She got it because it said ""extra Chashu"" but turned out, she got way less meat than I did. Extra means more than 3 but she got exactly 3 pieces. Maybe they were way too small in size that they weren't significant enough. The broth was okay, nothing notable. To be honest she disliked it. I didn't think it was worth it for the price or the way they described it on the menu. We didn't want to compare this place to Monta, but even the people who were sitting behind us mentioned about Monta in their conversation so...

We also got Karaage Chicken which is Japanese fried chicken. It was supposed to be an appetizer but we got it AT THE END of the meal. I was annoyed. But I thought it was okay, but a little over-salted. They used dark meat that's very tender. Very good coating. The thing is, they had like a pile of overdressed salad with very liquidy dressing so it soaked the fried chicken pieces. The chickens were soggy after a while. I don't think the addition of salad was necessary because why???

Overall we just didn't enjoy the restaurant as much as how I anticipated it. I get why they have the stamp system or the ""eat 4 ramens get a free appetizer"" to attract customers but it just didn't work for me. Everything was missing a notch of goodness to get to that level. Monta is still in the lead by a huge margin. This place is still improving but I won't be around to see the improvements.",pIekRRbcZvQbwYobu7f6sA,1,0,3,FGZ0f7qfoK2oXLe5v1G0HA

It would've made it easier if they took reservations, but given how popular they are, it makes sense that they don't need reservations. Our wait was about 15 minutes long and the waiters were very efficient at turning the tables around. I was even thinking that next time I might do take away because they were efficiently packing ramen to go, carefully packing the noodles and broth separately as to not mess up their masterpiece.

Once seated, the waitress took our drink orders, then lunch orders. They were quick, kind, and to the point. We ordered a chicken kaarage for the table, which I only took a bite of because I was saving room for the ramen. It was hot and tasty, but the batter was a little slimy in texture--interesting observation, I know! I ordered the Tori Ramen, which is made with chicken broth and has chicken chashu. I was starving and it was delicious! I did think it was a little too salty for my liking, and next time I'd likely add the spice bomb to give it more of a kick, but all in all, it was very good! I didn't even leave a drop--that's how hungry I was. The rest of the table ordered different types of ramen with different added toppings--everyone reall enjoyed their food but also thought it was on the salty side.

The food tasted good, customer service was great, and it was pretty cheap--$7.50 for the chicken ramen! Restaurant and restroom were also very clean. Will definitely be back--and can't forget to bring the stamp card! 4 ramen stamps = 1 free appetizer, and I'm looking forward to trying the gyoza next time!

The tan tan men was too creamy. Like, grainy creamy. The interaction of miso with the liquid broth was not there. In fact, I barely ate any of mine because of it. Soooo why give this place four stars?

Their Fukumimi ramen was awesome. It had an amazing flavor that I will most certainly order in the future. I'm having a hard time describing it, just, whatever, just go. Kaarage is good too, but I'd personally stick to the ramen.

2851828,2013-12-24,12,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"A welcome addition to the ramen scene on the east side of town.  Located in an inconspicuous strip mall at the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, this is a true neighborhood ramen joint where one is always greeted enthusiastically at the door and local Japanese residents can always be spotted as regulars.  The decor is minimalist but modern and service is prompt and non-overbearing.  

Appetizers that stand out are the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the gyoza (pork/chicken pot stickers).  The chicken is served fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior with a hint of ginger accentuated with a squeeze of fresh lemon whereas the gyoza have a nice char and the dough skin and filling are light enough to leave room for the main course.  

After consuming 15+ bowls of ramen on multiple lunch break visits from work, the key words describing the soups here are consistency and balance.  Whereas I've had a few instances at Ramen Sora and Monta where the soups were either too salty or too bitter (black garlic oil was literally blackened garlic),  the broths here all have a creamy rich depth of flavor and are not overly cloying in the mouth so the resistance to reaching for additional spoonfuls of broth once the noodles are finished is quite low.  Noodles come in thick and thin varieties with decent texture although lacking any true inherent flavor only found at the top joints.  

The standout broth for me is one of the relative newcomers on the menu: the kogashi (or burnt miso) ramen.  I've waxed poetic before on the Mallard reaction in chemistry  applied to food in a previous review(nerd alert!) but here again is yet another example of the magical powers of applying heat to rearrange amino acids and simple sugars to create a new unique flavor.  By charring miso paste, not only is there an intense aroma given off by the broth upon arriving at your table, but the flavor profile retains the savory note of the fermented soybeans we all know and love in miso but also has additional complex notes with an almost caramelized sweetness and a hint of bitterness that is pleasing on the tongue.  The crispy fried onions topping the noodles further enhance the umami tsunami.   I wish I could comment on the tan-tan men (spicy Szechuan style broth), but alas my first experience was on a full stomach from a previous meal so I must defer one to read other fellow yelper's raves on this other unique offering.

For the most part, the choices here are safe and reliably consistent, much like dating the girl next door, but if you're in the mood for something a little more adventuresome and unpredictable, the krazy kogashi ramen or the spicy and fiery tan tan men are worthy ""fuku-mi-mi"" one night stands (had to do it,  the name of the joint is just begging for a little humorous acknowledgment!)  

P.S.  Don't forget to partake in their generous punch-card system where one is entitled to a free order of gyoza or karaage with every fourth bowl of ramen purchased!",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,22,20,4,cqy7OJThdn_rpK74jxVeMw

They have all the toppings in all of the soups so you don't have to pay $1.00 for everything you want like at some of the other ramen shops but the bowl of ramen (one size) is a bit smaller compared to others and only comes with one piece of meat. 

The Karaage (fried chicken) were the perfect little crispy and meaty chicken bites. They have a little seasoning you can sprinkle over them if you want (you probably do want to!), and it comes with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. 

The Gyoza were ok. I would've preferred them to be a little crispier (more burnt!).

Fukumimi is an oasis in our (up until recently) ramen desert. It is traditional while still offering enough options to keep those that need variety happy. The staff is friendly and attentive and always willing to make recommendations.

The tonkotsu ramen is my goto dish.  The pork is the perfectly cooked  with just enough fat to enhance the flavor without ruining the consistency. The noodles are cooked to perfection. The flavors in the broth are pleasing with out being overpowering.

The portions are fine for a normal lunch or dinner. When i am super hungry I will usually ask for an additional order of noodles as soon as my ramen arrives. The second helping will arrive about half way thru the first.  Pro tip:  Try to save your broth for the second helping.

The atmosphere is your typical Japanese ramen or izakaya joint (everything is wood and there is sushi bar seating).  

Overall their service is friendly and their prices are affordable. They even have a stamp card, but four ramen bowls and get a free appetizer!!

I don't know if anyone else has ever thought of this but I felt like the cooks and the rest of the small staff had a great working relationship. I just felt that because I sat in the bar rather than the tables. 

  I had the spidy miso ramen. The noddles tasted good! Wish it had more. The chilli taste was not so hot, but good cause I just came out of work and it was the first day of the new year where it was pretty hot outside, so I was not looking forward to start sweating, but also I do not want something without spice.

The place is small but pretty nice. We ordered honey chicken and chicken rice bowl for my partner. I didn't eat the rice but the honey chicken Karaage is delicious. Tender in the inside, a bit crunchy outside.  The sauce is a bit tangy and has a good taste. 
Now the main menu: noodle is pretty decent. Al dente - just how I like it. It has a good flavor but I taste better somewhere else. The broth is spicy and has a very strong smell. Do I mind? Nope cause it's delicious. The egg is okay. Nothing to writes home about. Now, the chasu!  That's a different story. I got extra and I am not sure how much they put without the extra. But man...it was plentiful in my bowl and soooooo good. It's the kind that melt in your mouth. Very tender and delicious. Will I come back? Definitely. Recommended? Definitely.

It's not a very big place.  I'd say it seats about 20-30 people.  One thing to note is that though the hours of operation are listed as they're open until 11pm, they take their last order at 10:30.  We arrived at about 10:15pm and the waitress turned the open sign off promptly at 10:30.  

We ordered the karaage and the gyoza first.  Karaage is Japanese fried chicken.  Gyoza is a dumpling/potsticker.  Both were really good.  I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked.  The potstickers come with a special gyoza sauce which was a yummy combo.  For the ramen we ordered the fukumimi ramen, they're specialty.  There are about ten other ramen dishes to choose from.  The fukumimi ramen comes with pork belly in it.  Sooo good.  My boyfriend and I split a bowl of that.  In total our bill came to $22 plus tip.

They put pork in almost all of their Ramen, I ordered the Spicy Ramen and asked the pork to be placed on the side and I gave it to a friend (I'm not a pork guy).  The Ramen soup was flavorful and it wasn't too spicy and salty.  The noodle was pretty good as well, it wasn't too chewy but I was hoping it would snap in my mouth as i chew and the feeling of a traditional Chinese hand pulled noodle.

BROTH: It was good, but not the best. It sort of lacked a richness and complexity that I'm accustomed to. 4/5

PRESENTATION: Beautiful. 5/5

The servers were pretty, attentive, polite, and knowledgeable. I'm not sure if they were Japanese though, but they both did have accents. I don't care about that anyway. They're everything you look for in servers.

Looks just like a Shinsengumi in terms of the layout and that's a good thing. Well, the Shinsengumi by my house, at least.

3198729,2012-11-29,3,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"I believe in Las Vegas, this ramen place is as good as it gets (especially since Kai Gen Ro is no more). I had the 

Fukumimi Ramen: the broth is milky, not as milky as Ippudo in NY, but still really milk of bone milky, not cream milky. The noodles are very similar to a thin egg noodle I used to get from a company called Quon Yick, but although they are similar these noodles are definitely very tasty and cooked perfectly. They are not overcooked and the color is slightly translucent but still opaque enough that you can tell they are done with care. Seaweed is the normal nori that you would find in large sheets cut up into squares. Their chashu is pork belly slow-braised and sliced thin, seasoned well and not overly salty. 

You can get kaedama (another mouthful of noodles) for $1. It's not on the menu, but you can request it. It comes in a little rice bowl and is less than the amount at Monta, but Monta charges $2 for their kaedama.

I also tried their

Curry Rice Bowl: their rice bowls come in small or large. The curry was okay, but I'm not as big a fan of Japanese curry as I am of Thai or Indian curry. The ginger was somewhat special to me because I noticed they took the time to include pickled turnip which was also red. It's interesting because normally the red pickled ginger is only ginger, so it was a nice little surprise. 

Their front of house staff mainly speaks Japanese, but understood enough English to take my order. The interior is mainly decorated in wood, very simple yet chic. It speaks and says, we're here for you to eat and enjoy a moment of zen. I enjoyed my moment. It's also more spacious and they don't try to turn and burn, like at some other places... eh hem. 

They cleared away dishes discreetly and added water appropriately. Their service was apparent, but not brash. I also forgot my sunglasses and they chased after me to return them. From start to finish, I enjoyed my meal very much.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,11,8,5,gRO4A2EsaV2ZE-UK8xJGiw

I shouldn't be that surprised since I know that people will wait for good ramen all the time everywhere, but as funny as this may sound, my time seems more precious to me while I'm on vacation and I sure don't want to spend it waiting for a bowl of noodles.  Fortunately due to the diligence of a couple of Yelp friends, they've trail blazed their way to Fukumimi's, a modest unassuming place East of the strip where you can get a good bowl of ramen without a crazy line to get in like the one we encountered at Monta's...

Two of our favs for apps happen to be Agedashi Tofu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#uH7PEnc0RPMmmJ4mSKvzJA and Karaage http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ;  both of these were nicely done.  The tofu was silky soft with a gentle crispy cover, slightly mitigated by the sweet mirin.  The presentation was superb as each block was topped with negi on one, hairlike strands of nori on the other, and bookended by a single baby bok choy.  The chicken was nice and juicy with a seasoned crust, accompanied by a citrusy green salad on the side to cut through some of the saltiness...

We both got Tonkotsu Ramen, the one that favored salt has flavored garlic oil http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#HFqyXLlE-6uJ134LGBgxzg, and one that favored soy has a single sheet of nori http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#0oIEfHKL4HBSBS4pUC5WOQ.  Both come with chasiu, half a seasoned soft egg, sprouts, and more chopped negi.  Not the richest kottari pork broth that I have found, but despite it's thinner consistency it was still a tasty soup that  managed to really hit the spot without inducing an impending after lunch drowsiness.  The egg was beyond runny but still on the soft side.  The chasiu with its familiar outer  ring was sliced thin, slightly collapsing when tugged at by chopsticks...

Service was cheerful and polite, in that Japanese schoolgirl way, but short of obnoxiously annoying like you feel when being patronized. The best thing about everything was the casual speakeasy feeling about being able to sit down immediately when you walk in and getting service right away without any hovering or rush.  Parking is a non-issue in the very expansive mall that Fukumimi resides in.  A very refreshing experience for something as mundane as a bowl of ramen while on vacation...",LP59kBNEHmASJZWynra29g,8,7,5,eUYblKvKoa0NGT8_X9KZGA

I got the ramen with the same name as the restaurant. I liked it. Lots of pork. Filling and tasty. They covered the inside of the bowl in seaweed. The noodles weren't too soft. Good ramen.

Will got the one with the ground pork. The pork was sweet seasoned and it was a good contrast. The broth was creamy and savory. It had a little spice. He added the marinated egg and it had plenty of flavor too. The thick noodles had a great texture too.

Fukumimi is a nice option if you're on this part of town, butI'm still partial to the China Town and the south durango/rainbow ramen joints.  The prices here are very reasonable, but the broth and noodles didn't leave me craving more.  They specialize in tonkatsu which is my favorite so my hopes were high coming in.  I had the spicy ramen and added extra spicy paste and corn.  They sell sapporo and miller for alcohol so selection is bleak, but both are under $3.  The ramen broth was a much redder variety and was saltier than I typically like.  The noodles were fine and the chasu wasn't memorable.  And the ramen only came with 1 piece which was disappointing.  The price is the best attraction of Fukumimi.  They have some nice appetizer options for under $4 that are pretty big considering, so that's definite plus.

I hear this area used to be the place but people have started to move out so it's all on its lonesome now. There are a handful of tables down a long row.  The place is decorated pretty nicely with colors that remind me of other ramen shops.

Tan Tan Men: Not exactly what I expected when the bowl came because I am used to the Chinese version.  I expected it to be thicker and with less soup/sauce but the noodles never slurped up the soup that I had expected.  The taste was not as strong as I would have liked either.  The peanut flavor is pretty light.  The ground meat was sweeter than expected but at least it was hot and decent meal.

Small Curry Chicken Rice: Ordered this as a supplement to all of our ramen soups.  The curry flavor was not extremely spice-y.  It was also pretty light in terms of curry flavor.  Little pieces of chicken within the curry and also included were pickled radishes.  I actually enjoyed this more than my tan tan men but overall it was around a 3.5 star level.

Ramen is pretty big in Vegas and there are tons are other places I have found on Yelp.  This place is decent but it was a let down.

I was just a single party of one at the bar around 6:30pm.  They took my stamp card and redeemed my free appetizer.  My green tea came promptly and I got gyoza after 10 minutes.  The wait for my ramen took about a half hour, they served a table of 4 people that came in after me, and they screwed up my order because I originally wanted a Classic ramen, but on bill was Kogashi ramen. After I brought that to waitresses attention, they could not change ticket because that was what they said I was served so I was annoyed because it cost a dollar more than I wanted to spend  and they refused to correct even though it was not my mistake.  I was so tired, just wanted to go home so let bill slide to just get out of there after an hour.  Ramen was alright, not as flavorful as previous visits so had to add condiments and the gyoza didn't have any taste just texture even though it looked like tiny meat in there, had to use chili and gyoza sauce.

Just like at Sora, I always have the usual, the Fukumimi. It comes with all the nessescary essentials: pork, miso broth, thin noodles, nori, green onion, egg... But as an added bounus, you get their yummy black garlic oil poured on top.

I have tried the Tan Tan Men as well. I really, really think that you should order it, at least once. It's not everyone's cup of tea (right Khatherine T.? Heh heh), but when I tried it, I have to say it was a nice change of pace.

The minced pork is almost sweet, with the broth being quite even and mellow. There almost seems to be slight nutty flavor to it. It's nice to break away from the usual once in a while.

One of the awesome things about Fukumimi is their rewards card! It only takes 4 stamps to earn either a free karage chicken or gyoza on your next trip! So it really doesn't take a million trips over there to earn it, unlike some places where you have to buy 10 or 15 of something to earn some small reward.

There's not much room inside, so it can get crowded fast. Most of the time, it's not, so don't worry. They should look into serving a bigger selection of adult libations. You can only order a few beers and (I think) sake. There's such a high profit margin to be made an alcohol, I don't see the harm in trying it out.

I have to say, it's a great deal. 

The noodles were good, a little too firm than I would like them. However, I also prefer thick wavy noodles, and they only had thin ones. 

The broth was okay, nothing special. I thought it was a little bland. 

Now if their pork was as soft as Monta, I would have been sold, but it was. They felt dry, and the main reason why I love Monta is because of their super soft melt in your mouth tender.

So far I would have to say I like it a bit better than Monta, but not by much. I grew up in Japan and ramen there has never made me nauseous or throw up until I've came here and tried Monta's. 

The service is typical, with a greeting at the door and a waitress came and seated myself and a friend. There weren't that many people there, actually only one party of two on the other side of the restaurant, when we went in. Thought they seemed to be a bit confused with which table ordered what at first, but that was sorted out quickly. 

It was a cute place, with the kitchen being maybe a third of the restaurant which is a open bar style, with a bar seating area right in front of it. There were tables and a bench seating area to the right upon entering. The bench seats also double up as storage, my friend pointed out that they look like they moved and so I got curious and got up and wanted to see if they could. =] 

So we got the Tonkotsu ramen (pork based broth), my friend got the salt and I got the soy, both priced at about $7.50 which wasn't too bad. The salt included garlic oil, one piece of chashu, green onion, egg, bean sprouts, and ginger. The soy included, nori, one piece of chasu, egg, bean sprouts, and green onions. I personally felt mine was saltier than the salt one, but my friend had a different opinion. (We'll have to try it again some time and determine which is saltier)

The soup base wasn't too bad I've still had better, it wasn't very strong, the noodles they used were the really thin ones, but were cooked pretty well, as they weren't too soft or too hard. I don't usually eat pork but I took a bite out of the chashu and gave it to my friend as I knew it would have made me sick. 

There were other items such as miso and spicy, along with their Fukumimi ramen, which seemed to include extra meat and corn. You can add other items to your ramen, such as corn, extra meat, egg, etc at a small extra cost. They have the extra noodle option but it's not on the menu. 

It's a good place close to UNLV, so you don't have to travel deep into china town for ramen, or for those of us living on the east side it's a bit closer. =]",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,1,1,4,RtCzj8OrGnIm3YP6DdhmBA

Tonkotsu Ramen broth is the house original pork flavored soup base, rich and smooth. They are topped with  chashu pork belly, seasoned egg cooked medium, green onion and fresh bean sprouts.

The house also offers chicken ramen. Each bowl is topped with seasoned egg? Green onion and bean sprouts. There are only two selections in this category. The Tori Ramen is flavored with a salt based sauce, topped with chicken cha shu and garlic oil. Then there is the Classic Ramen bowl in which the broth is flavored with soy sauce, topped with pork belly cha shu. They go for $7.50.

We like supplementing our meals with:
Karaage chicken $3.90  (two thumbs)
Honey Garlic Chicken $4.90 (two thumbs) 
Gyoza $4.90 stuffed with pork and chicken
Agedashi $3.90

It's a little hidden and from the outside it looks a bit run down as the windows are covered and you can't see inside.

My usual order is the Tonkatsu Ramen (miso). I like the thicker noodles and buttery broth. My husband orders the Spicy Tonkatsu, which he enjoys, but then he is always taking some of my broth because he says he likes it better. 

It's not the most amazing ramen I've had in my life, but so far it's the best I've had in Vegas. The bowls are smaller and there's not as much meat as other ramen places I've been to, but the quality and price is good. It always hits the spot when I'm craving ramen.

Also tender. I highly recommend their tonkatso miso ramen as I love that nice thick broth. It was filled with corn, green onions, and medium boiled egg. 

The noodles have a nice chew to it. Not too soggy and not too under cooked either. The broth was full of flavor. The pork had that nice consistency of chewiness, and the ramen all together was full of flavor. 

I also recommend the fried gyoza as a side, and their homemade kimchee. Not up for ramen. I highly RECOMMEND the Chasu bowl (pork and white rice, with ginger). It's so delish and it too is full of flavor. It has a very subtle sweetness to it which I love and is also very tender and nicely marinated. I think if the ramen doesn't win me over from Monta, I'd say their Chasu bowl does. 

The vibe also brings out that nice grassroots local Japanese feel with the small establishment, wooden seats, and specials hand written and posted on the walls. The location is very off from what most typical Japanese restaurants are, and is a bit out of the way for me, but if you're in that side of town or have that nice gap between classes from UNLV it would be a nice place for lunch.

Fukumimi has by far the best I've had yet. The only critique is maybe adding a lil more meat to the bowl? Other than that, it was delicious!

I also got the spicy paste which didn't really add any heat to the broth but there was Sriracha available so I doctored it up. 

The 2 unsung hero's however were the house salad, the sesame ginger house dressing was delicious, although it was just greens and dressing I could have eaten a pound of it!

Try out the appetizers such as their Agedashi tofu, gyoza and honey garlic chicken! It very much compliments your entire meal

Overall, the price was a bit steep for for what you get. The portion size was smaller than most Ramen spots I been to but I was still satisfied with my meal. It still filled me up.

Fukumini is located down the street from the airport and UNLV is an otherwise unassuming strip mall. It is very easy to miss, especially in the dark which is when me and some friends went. For a group of 4 on a Tuesday night, we probably waited only 10-15 minutes. Not terrible. The space is on the smaller side so I would not really recommend coming with a large group. 

I ordered the Tan Tan Men which comes with thick noodles. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked great! Still had a nice chew to them. My favorite. My friends also recommend the Fukumini Ramen, which sounded like a shio/salt based broth. It's their most popular bowl I believe! They also have several rice bowls and appetizers to accompany your meal.

3854215,2017-10-24,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"I came here when they first opened and the issues that have plagued their broth since their initial launch has yet to be addressed when I came for dinner a couple nights ago. The spicy miso ramen is flavorless and the chashu is similarly tough and bland. The broth is the foundation to build upon for any ramen but it ultimately just ends up tasting like lukewarm water with spices floating on top instead of imparting any flavor. The chashu pork paradoxically needs a ton of salt to even have any taste. The noodles are nothing worth mentioning and the portions are meager.

Our server placed our bowls at the edge of the table and I had to scoot it to the center myself. They were attentive with pouring water but it made no sense to me why they didn't place our bowls front and center of us.

Really, Fukumimi needs to revisit the fundamentals of building up a solid broth in which to build upon. They would have much to gain to learn from Monta or Jinya who have much richer, flavorful and dense broths with tender, salty pieces of chashu and larger potions.

Until then, Fukumimi isn't worth a single visit.",XjyTxD6wAINeTsclXB6LeQ,0,0,1,3kEK5RsNiW2F4AB1SWkSMg

Since we are on the east side the patrons eating are more diverse, unlike the eateries on Spring Mtn., which tend to attrack mainly Asians.

I have ordered the tonkatsu ramen both times and I like it! I particularly like the corn. I prefer Fukumimi much more than Monta, but that's just my opinion. My friend ordered the Tantan and it really reminds us of Filipino karekare (peanut butter stew) a little different, but very similar. She enjoyed it and gave me a bite which was delish from what I remember. Last visit I also had the chicken karaage, this was good too and not too greasy.

3876865,2014-02-20,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Been meaning to try this place out for a little while now. So after hitting the gym on a Wednesday night, decided ramen was what the tummy craved. 

Came in about 730ish and the place is tiny. 8 tables and 6 bar seats. It was about half full, was greeted briefly at the door and took a seat. The server offered drinks and then have enough time and space to look over the menu. Most of it sounded line ramen from any of the other ramen place in town.

I asked for a suggestion and asked if I like spicy. I do, do I was recommended the karo-miso spicy ramen. Also ordered the Soboro bowl. Both items came out really quick. The bowl was rice with ground meat with onions and scallions. It was tasty. Savory with a touch of sweet.

I like spicy food a lot, and many times restaurants that say their food is spicy, it doesn't hit the spot, however this ramen has a good kick. It isn't Hannah or anything, but enough that extra spice isn't necessary. The broth is rich and flavorful, not too salty. The noodle itself has a nice bite to it. Was once told that good ramen should have a elastic spring when you bite it. Which these definitely do.

Lastly the prices are decent. Definitely will return. For the location it is in and the size out would be misleading to judge by looks. People were coming and going the last 20+ minutes I've been here.",vrfu5g0dEJA1ogMP9wicyQ,1,0,5,7sbYy1qd8-rFWiTMG7C-Kg

3896541,2018-01-01,0,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"My family and I were visiting Las Vegas and wanted to try a couple of the local ramen hotspots.  Of course, we'd eaten at a few of the big Strip joints too.  But wandering off the Strip and eating some non-touristy food had some real appeal.  We'd already had a great meal at Jinya but had been turned away from Monta.  (This is important: they'd told us that the wait for a party of five was almost 90 minutes.)  So we pulled up Fukumimi on Yelp and headed off to what we hoped would be another wonderful meal.

Unfortunately, we never got to eat.  When we arrived, there were only a handful of people waiting for tables, so we were optimistic.  We signed in and were told that there were just four groups in front of us.  ""So how long for a party of five?"" I'd asked.  ""About 20 minutes,"" I was told.  It's a small place, but everyone seemed to be eating already, so we weren't too concerned about the wait.  Then, after a few minutes, I actually got a glimpse of the waiting list.  There were indeed just four groups ahead of ours.  Two were singles.  One was a group of three.  But the last was a group of nine.  I immediately began to wonder: ""Huh?  How are they going to seat us with a group of nine ahead of us?  The entire place will have to empty out before they can clear up five seats?""

20 minutes passed.  Then 30.  The two singles were seated, then the party of three.  Around the 40 minute mark, a table of four cleared out and an offer was made to the group of nine (only four of which had been waiting inside the restaurant): ""Can we seat four of your group now?  We'll seat the rest when tables open up?""

That's not terrible--and I'm not being critical of it.  The group was there before us and deserved to be seated in accordance.  Still, it was now apparent that (even though we'd been told we'd be seated in 20 minutes and had been waiting for almost 45--see Monta reference above) we still had a 20-30 minute wait ahead of us.

Then two things happened in quick succession: after a few of his family members headed to the table of four, the father-figure of that party purposefully blocked my way from securing on open chair for my 72-year-old mother-in-law.  She'd been standing for 45 minutes and I wanted her to have a seat.  He held off so one of his teenage family members could grab the seat herself.  (I know, I know: it's hard for restaurant staff to referee this kind of thing. Still, my blood was starting to boil and, like it or not, that is inherently part of my Fukumimi experience.)

Then: there'd been a party of five guys sitting at the bar.  They'd already had their food when we first arrived.  Now, two of them got up and left.  I mentioned to my family: ""If the other three leave soon, maybe we can just sit at the bar.""

Then, two other guys wandered in the front door.  They asked how long the wait was.  Immediately the hostess offered up, ""I have two seats open at the bar.""

I'm sorry but . . . if you've had one party waiting for twice as long as you've promised . . . and you've already negotiated a staggered seating arrangement with another party . . . you should at least offer us the opportunity to take seats at the bar.  It's not hard to say, ""Sorry you've been waiting so long.  If the rest of that group at the bar leaves, do you want those seats?""

As it is, I crossed our group off the waiting list and went to get our dinner elsewhere.  If a restaurant can't manage it's own waiting list, I'm not sure I want to know how it handles food orders.

And for the record: three members of my group were family members visiting from Japan.  We'd already decided that the aromas coming out of the kitchen--while good--weren't nearly as appetizing as what we'd experienced at Jinya and Monta.

And the sight of blackened potstickers and dry kuraage chicken coming out of the kitchen should have told us to leave sooner anyway . . . .",FFQ6sjDRR-7LL_Oudzwbvw,0,0,1,as5pe_GmTPNQt0xVTVqkog

I expected much more!

I will say that the waitress was OK, however she did not check back with the table to make sure all ""food"" is OK, she did not ask at anytime if we needed anything else to include drinks!

The food I ordered was A Bowl of rice topped with sweet ground pork!
It was very dry, the pork was very little ""like they say, where is the Beef"" and the sauce was not enough to last with the total overload of rice!

I have been in many countries around the world, and actually when it comes to the ambiance ""the feeling of wanting to dine-in became less than desirable"", I felt uncomfortable!  The tables & chairs ""so cheap and cheap looking"", and minimal room!

They have truly much work to do to make this a 3,4,5 star business!  It can be done with some TLC!

I wish I lived closer to it so I can enjoy an $8 bowl of Ramen every day. The restaurant is located on Tropicana and Eastern in the Tropicana East Shopping Center. There is ample parking, but the restaurant is small. It can fit probably 30 people with bar seating. We came there on a Wednesday night around 6:30 PM. It was slightly packed, but we beat the rush. When we were done eating there were at least 11 people waiting by the door to get seated or pick up their to go food. 

FOOD: The ramen here is so good! Not only are the noodle delicious, the soup is tasty, but not salty. There's also a spicy paste that gives caliente lovers the kick they've been searching for in their Ramen dishes. You can order the spicy paste on the side or have the Chef add it in. We had the following dishes: 

1. Karaage Chicken ($3.90): the chicken came out fresh and crispy. It's the best I've had in Las Vegas! THIS IS A MUST TRY!!! 
2. Honey Garlic Chicken ($4.90): Gosh this Honey Garlic Chicken is what I dream about on a Friday night. It's so gooood. Whatever they cook this sauce in is bomb. 
3. Tonkotsu Ramen Salt ($7.50): The soup was tasty and not overly salty. You won't walk out swollen and dehydrated for all the sodium you consumed like most ramen places. This bowl comes with thin noodles. 
4. Fukumimi Ramen ($8.20) This is the ramen I had and it's my FAVORITE! I would come back to eat it again all day errrr day. :-) It's a big bowl with a lot of pork belly chashu so I recommend sharing this. The chasu pork is so soft and fatty. You'll never experience chashu pork like this ever again unless you're at Fukumimi. 
5. Curry Rice Regular Size ($6.50): This was my least favorite dish, but it was good. The curry is well seasoned on top of rice. I think there was too much rice and the curry lacked chicken. 

PRICE: You can dine here for under $10 and leave satisfied. The value for this place is awesome and I would recommend anyone dining on a budget to come here. 

SERVICE: Service was sub-par because they were understaffed. The girl who was taking care of us forgot to bring us water for 10 minutes. She also took care of other people's orders that came in after us. These people were sitting at the bar so I think they were in her view more. That was a little annoying, but I'll let it slide because the food was THAT good. 

Overall, I loved this place and I recommend anyone who loves Ramen to come try it. 5-star's for the food and value, 3-star for service and overall experience is a 4 star. 

Happy Dining,

3955227,2012-12-05,3,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Ok, this place served the best bowl of ramen that I've ever eaten. I admit that I was skeptical at first when my friend told me about this place. I've had their signature Fukumimi ramen and their Tan Tan Men. 

I prefer the Fukumimi ramen. In my opinion a good tonkotsu should have flavorful broth but not to the point where you feeling like you're drinking liquefied lard. This bowl fits the bill. The noodles are the straight kind, the kind that I like.

If you like a good spicy bowl of noodles then definitely you should try the Tan Tan Men. The broth was a bit too thick and creamy for me, but it was still good. The broth was begging to have extra noodles added! It was spicy but not overly spicy where you can't taste anything.

I also had their karaage. It was very juicy and tender. One of the best I've had.

Their service was really quick and friendly.

This place definitely is the best ramen shop in the Vegas area. Monta used to be my go-to place, but now it is here!",zFo--zdHXg6KJ1RYd8r1BA,9,9,5,CmzTCaheIxBVbMCh7xuYjQ

SERVICE
Attentive and quick. Water was filled the entire time and short wait time! 2 thumbs up.

FOOD
I got their Kogashi Ramen. It's one of their Tonkotsu soup base option and is topped with fragrant garlic oil/fried onion. Broth was all black like squid ink and oh em gee...I loved it. Broth was extremely hot (just the way I like it in the cold weather), super flavorful and I loved their thin noodle. Chashu was next level...so tender. One slice of chashu kept me wanting more. They got everything on point. 

I also got their Soboro Bowl. Soboro wasn't flaky/dry like other places. The sweet sauce from soboro went perfectly with their white rice. I got their mini size but it was still a good portion.

Their tonkotsu is flavorful and assari/light. I don't know why Monta is so popular, Fukumimi is much better in my opinion.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,9,6,4,w2lQigihUDK-WQlAue0grw

The waitress brought a princess cup and spoon for my niece! It was over the top for me in service. After the second time I know they do it for all the kids but really a sweet touch. Bringing toddlers to a restaurant makes me feel bad but they seem to welcome the idea. 

They have the best chicken kaarage in town IMO which they serve with a too small side salad with amazing ginger dressing.



Their curry isn't the best, but still good. The chashu bowl was also good, but not the best.

The flavors of all of the dishes aren't super salty. Everything is very light. 

Even after having my entire bowl of the house fukumimi ramen (which I always get) and karaage I felt satisfied but not overly stuffed. 

The prices are reasonable. Everything is under $10 dollars.

The fukumimi house ramen $9.50 comes with all the fixings (seaweed, 3 slices of pork, oil) so that's what I get and add corn. 

For the good prices, awesome service, and cleanliness I give them all five stars


Most recent visit today I noticed their addition of a few more appetizers and ramen to their updated menus! They use agedashi tofu in soy broth! I believe it was $3.90 The chicken karaage is $3.90 and the gyoza are $4.90 which they let you mix your own ratio of gyoza sauce and chili oil.

4054710,2013-02-22,9,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"My first real ramen experience was at Ramen Sora and I surely wasn't disappointed. My check in to Ramen Sora resulted to a ton of advice coming from other Yelp peeps from Las Vegas to SoCal. Either I have lots of love coming from my Yelp homies or they knew I was a newbie to this phenomenon called Ramen.  One common advice, if I like Ramen Sora, I will love Fukumimi. I knew that this visit was coming soon and when Elizabeth B set up the UYE, I could not resist.  

Somewhat armed with knowledge, one thing that I knew coming in was the noodle type that each place proposes.  The Tantan Men was highly suggested, but there was too much in it that I was not allowed to eat until after Easter. So, kept this place bookmarked just for their Tantan Men. I opted for Fukumimi's Tonkotsu Miso Ramen minus the meat, added 2 extra eggs, and 3 extra seaweeds. When it comes to taste, I admit the broth was perfect and creamy.  You also know it's creamy when you cannot see anything deep inside your bowl. So good that I didn't finish my bowl.  As a special touch I added the Karaage to my order, which is basically small fried chicken pieces.  But there's nothing basic about their Karaage. The Karaage is a tastier and super tender boneless chicken that's also lightly breaded.  This complimented the ramen to perfection.  

As for who's got it better than them? Well, depends on the person. I prefer the taste of Fukumimi, but the noodles of Ramen Sora. In other words, I'm torn but do not mind taste testing both and having a personal challenge for the rest of my life.

Couple of UYE call outs.  First time to hang out at a UYE with Elizabeth B, Ian A, Shirley B, and Joe L.  It's been a pleasure and great minds do think alike.  Another UYE with Terri R, Alicia R, Francisco A, and Chad S in a week's time.  This is becoming habit, this is becoming family. Thanks Elizabeth B. for setting this up. You're the best!!

PS: Ate ""Food for You"" aka Shirley B taught me a chopstick trick when eating ramen. That is to keep the chopsticks intact and use it like a fork and twirl the noodles together.

Food: My first meal there was tonkotsu ramen. I just don't have the tongue for it. My wife, who's Japanese, loves it. However their tori (chicken) ramen is just perfect for me. My tip is to order it with extra chicken.

Their appetizers are fantastic and presented well. Their new agedashi tofu dish is probably my favorite in the valley and the gyoza is exactly how you expected it. However their karaage can be a bit on the greasy side.

I'm not a ramen aficionado by any means. I've only ever had true ramen once at Monta and once at the Bacchanal Buffet (which I believe does it the Monta way). However, this is a spot I would love to go to not only because it's a much shorter drive from Hendersonvilletown (Northeast corner of Trop and Eastern, by the way), but also because it's really darn good.

I split the kara age (fried chicken) appetizer ($3.90) with my friends and ordered the basic tonkotsu (salt) ($7.50). The kara age had such good flavor even without condiments, and the salt, lemon, and salad are all nice complements. The tonkotsu ramen was fantastic. The noodles were soft, the meat was tender, the broth was rich and not overly salty whatsoever, and the half egg seems like it underwent some sort of magical transformation to make it seem almost not so eggy in flavor. The whole bowl was a great way to make yourself sweat again in these colder months.

My only regrets are that I didn't really mix well and thus ended up with a decent helping  of julienne ginger at the end, which is kinda strong for me in actual chewing (vs. merely flavoring), and that I didn't know that one of my non-present friends gets free appetizers each time because it's just four stamps (read: four people). We all got individual stamp cards for some reason. Then again, maybe my friend is super special or something, and I'm sure I'll go here at least 3 more times in the next few months.

I normally do not give 5 stars after a 1st visit but Fukumimi Ramen deserves it!!!
Everything we ate was so flavorful and just plain yummy.....

The inside is new and clean with a modern casual decor.... I think it should be bigger cause once people try their food I imagine it'll be packed pretty often....

We ordered the small chicken curry over white rice and one taste of that yummy curry and we knew we were eating at a ""I WILL BE BACK"" type of restaurant....

The Chicken Karaage was so damn good!!! The breading was perfection and it was seasoned just right - accompanied by a small side of mixed greens with a yummy salad dressing - all this needed was a side of Fried Rice (which they don't have) and I would've been a happy camper!!! 
Both small orders only cost $3.90 each - well worth the price if you ask me!!!

On to our Ramen - I had the ""Fukumimi Ramen"" which had the creamy pork based broth. On top of the soup was pork belly,bean sprouts,seasoned egg,and sea weed. The noodles were perfect - not too soft - more firm - This Ramen was delicious!!!!

The BF had the ""Tantan Men Ramen"" which is a Szechuan style spicy soup with a chicken/pork based creamy broth that reminded us of a curry. In the Ramen was seasoned ground meat,bok choy and red chile oil. I tried the broth and it wasn't a taste that I would ever imagine at a Ramen place - it was so freakin yummy!!!!
 
There are add-ins to your Ramen for a minimal fee that you can get like corn ect...

You also get a stamp card where if you buy 4 ramens on your next visit you get either free gyoza or free chicken karaage. I'm not losing that stamp card...LOL

Now on 2 past occasions we tried to eat at Monta which is supposed to be like the Holy Grail in Vegas for Ramen but on each occasion it was too packed and we gave up but I honestly can't imagine any other Ramen places tasting better than what I ate tonight.....   
So, I guess everyone should try Fukumimi Ramen before it becomes like a Monta :(",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,21,22,5,tbkbPY375xvGq8ZStTqJOw

All their beverages come in a can so if your expecting refills you will be paying by the drink. After getting the menu I asked the server which I told her that this was my first time here to get have some assistance on what they would recommend. My server suggested I try the Kara-Miso Ramen,  which if you don't like any spice then don't get this one. It wasn't Atomic Hot but it had a little bite to it the meat that came with was rather thin so it dissolved into the bowl, I did like that it came with half a egg and corn, if your using corn to see if your regular I would ask for extra to ensure you actually see it if it's for that purpose. 

The Kaarage (Japanese Style Fried Chicken) appetizer, I can't really call It an appetizer if it comes after your ramen it gets renamed a side dish to the ramen. 

OWNER OF FUKUMIMI, below is the definition of an appetizer. (I googled it so it's gotta be right)

ap·pe·tiz·er
apt?zr/
noun
a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal or the main course of a meal to stimulate one's appetite.
synonyms: starter, first course, hors d'oeuvre, antipasto, amuse-gueule, amuse-bouche
""tonight's featured appetizer is a dish of grilled oysters and roasted mushrooms.

Ok so the Kaarage (Japanese Style Fried Chicken) let's just say Fried Chicken is best left to those who know what Fried Chicken is supposed to be like, whether it's a style or not it wasn't my cup of tea, I see other reviews the people go ga-ga over it no we're not talking Lady GA-GA, to me it had a grizzled taste to it and if I have to work harder than normal to eat my food in expending calories that should be done on a tread mill or getting chased down the street by a pack of Pit Bull puppies...",CLuD87erZsfqbFpmFICNLg,0,0,4,JkxZVKgsRi07PwpIIJDZew
4154558,2013-01-12,1,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"For Vegas, this is my new favorite ramen joint. 

The best ramen I've ever had was in Queen's Square, Yokohama, Minato-ke, Japan. So now, all other ramen joints get compared to this experience.

Fukumimi manages to make a excellent tonkotsu (pork) broth that is the best broth in town. I always get the spicy version here, which to me isnt spicy at all, but adds good flavor. (On an asian scale of spice, its like a 2/10).

The charsui (braised tender pork belly), is hit or miss. Sometimes its really tender, and sometimes its not. Monta has better charsui, and it is consistently good..

But overall I like Fukumimi more.

Pros:
Great broth
Great flavor
Affordable Price

Cons:
Inconsistency on the char sui

Orders some things to share:

Gyoza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#OXqKLZIdDF0zP5AdcNFENg  Nice flavored filling a little on the smaller side but its pretty good.

Karrage ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#EZbMXlry4Ef4DiW1Y_yLZQ  Typical in most Japanese restaurants and something that I definitely enjoy eating.  It came out hot and tasty.

Honey Garlic Chicken ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#8QLZ0rXxVN1Fk-IVPt-7qw  This I was not sure what to expect but I was presently surprised at how tasty it was.  The garlic flavor was very light almost non existent but thats coming from a person that luvs a lot of garlic so to me it was light.  Perfect amount of sweetness from the honey.  This was really good!

Kara miso ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#zcJ8OaJXqiO6b-CJbjYAVg  This was what the waitress recommended when I asked which she preferred between this and the Tantanmen. When it first arrived I was a bit shocked with what looked to be a good amount of red chili powder.  I like spicy but there is a limit to how much I can handle it and was a bit worried.  I mixed it all in and took my first sip and I was hooked.  A nice miso flavor with a perfect amount of heat.  It wasn't salty at all.  You cant see the ajitama but it had a medium yolk which I luv with a light flavor.  The chashu was fatty and flavorful.  This was a great bowl of ramen!

Eyes ~ Oh that looks spicy!
Nose ~ Smells Yummers.
Ear ~ Everyone happy slurping ramen..

This unassuming little ramen shop sits just outside the busy Strip life where you can relax and enjoy a nice bowl of piping hot tonkotsu ramen topped with their tender and flavorful pork belly chasu and perfectly seasoned nitamago--ask for extra noodles when you find yourself wanting more, trust me you will. Our staple favorites range from the spicy delicious kara-miso ramen to the hearty tantan men ramen. Fukumimi also carries several complementing side dishes such as their juicy and tender chicken karaage as well as the savory agedashi tofu which can only be best described as 'umami'! So if you crave a quick and hearty meal, take a detour off The Strip and make the drive to Fukumimi--you won't be dissappointed.",J4LGq7xYlHDfbfHbwbyK8Q,1,1,5,gHOCdwKYFhCIicGI56YNnw

I've only been to one other Ramen place beside Fukumimi and I liked Fukumimi better, so this is where we like to go. So when my stepfather, the judo sensei/shinto priest who lived in Japan for over 20 years visited and asked where we should go for Ramen, I just hoped Fukumimi would live up to his standard.

We were a party of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table on a busy Saturday night. It's a little tough to wait in such a crowded front area, but luckily the turnover is really fast, and really, once we sat down to eat it was totally worth it. For an appetizer, we ordered gyoza and the Kimchi. The gyoza were wrapped paper thin, crispy on one side, and piping hot. Delicious. The Kimchi was perfectly spicy and a good portion. 

Almost everyone in our party had something different: the Miso Tonkatsu was creamy and had a light sweetness imparted by the addition of corn, the Salt (Soy) Tonkatsu was a salty, full-bodied soup given added depth with seaweed and green onions, the Spicy Tonkatsu was medium-spicy yet still almost creamy in it's richness, and the large size (sweet) pork bowl with rice and green onions hit the spot for a heartier eater. Oh, and PERFECT eggs and tender pork belly in each bowl, my favorite part. The proteins in these Ramens just melt in your mouth. 

My stepdad said this is as good as any highly regarded Ramen shop in every city he lived in in Japan. He just kept saying ""This is SO good!"" over and over. He and my mom are in town one more week and he's jonesing for more Fukumimi one of these nights after he plays judo. So thanks for making me look good when I recommended we visit - regardless, this will always be this girl's Ramen joint.

The verdict:
We ordered the miso ramen and the tonkatsu ramen. Overall, it was just ok. It was decent ramen in a bowl, but I just didn't think it was THE BEST ramen ever that I needed to go back to a billion times over.  Broth was flavorful enough, but it was just lacking some sort of umph! I can't put my finger on what exactly was missing though.   We had actually ordered extra noodles just because we knew it wasn't going to be enough noodles and I'm always a hungry hippo. For me it's about the quantity and quality.  It is a little bit on the pricey side, but if your in a rush, around this area and don't want to wait this will be a decent ramen place for you to try.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,2,2,3,bgcNkz00Yh9mpaUyg7LpwA

Also, this particular server definitely had an attitude. I am not sure if it was because i was by myself and i only ordered one portion, but she did not bring any condiments or offer me any refill for my drink. When I was leaving, she just stared at me, no thanks no bye.

I've eaten at countless ramen places including Japan, Korea, Asia, EU and handful of other states in US.

Bowl itself was small but deep. I immediately noticed that ingredients and noodles were drowned in soup when I got my ramen bowl. As I was working on my bowl, I felt disappointment that all noodles were gone with about 7 mouthful. Dont get me wrong, soup base is pretty good 4/5.

For price of average $8ish I felt that it wasn't enough to make me feel full or satisfied, Im a skinny guy. Ratio between ingredients and soup was 1:2.5. I found myself fishing for solids and spent twice longer trying to get myself full by drinking the soup. Extra ingredients were little pricey to add. 

I would have loved it if the ratio was about 1:1.25. Little more generous portion of noodles and ingredients. I actually think that this business will do better if these things improve in the future.

The noodles here are the thin kind and I'm a big fan of Sora's thick noodles, but as long as the noodles are cooked perfectly it's all good in the neighborhood. Their broth was delicious. It was rich and flavorful. I never finish ""drinking"" the soup of any noodle bowl (ramen, udon, pho, etc.) but for the first time I finally reached the bottom.

ON A SIDE NOTE: I feel like Monta is overrated since it has dominated the ramen scene in Vegas for a long time now. People forget that there are alternatives and other ""executions"" of ramen, and that die-hard Monta lovers become stagnant in their taste profile (there, I said it). Maybe I'm just feeling this way because the last three times I've been there (within a span of 2 years), my broth was always freaking salty! Even their mini bowls were also salty.

4401386,2017-01-04,1,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Definitely THE ramen place of town! Hands down my favorite. The broth here is not too salty, but also not too flavorless.

Downside - located on the East side near UNLV, so a bit of the drive for anyone not in that area. Also the venue is quite small so expect to wait if you're going around dinner time (especially on a weekend). Generally speaking, the waits aren't too long. I think the most I ever had to wait was 20~25 minutes but we were a party of 6 in such a teeny place.

Do note this place does include a bar so you have the option to sit there if no tables are available. :)

Onto the food... Well, I've tried just about every ramen plate on this menu that is not labelled spicy and I like each and every one. I personally prefer thin noodles over the thick ones, so you may notice some bias in my favorite dishes (hint: they're all thin noodles). Luckily one of the menus on the table should list out what is thin and what is thick.

My favorite dishes in order:
1. Kogashi - the menu describes this as a fragrant flavored ramen and that is 100% true. Drinking the broth side by side with the other flavors, this ramen broth has a strong flavor which I personally prefer. It is topped with fragrant garlic oil and fried onion. My favorite. If you like garlic-y and onion-y flavors, I bet you this is your favorite too (but trust me, it isn't overpowering and still delish)
2. Tonkotsu - I prefer the soy over the salt one (though the salt one is good too). This is simply but very delicious. Again, I like Fukumimi because unlike other ramen places, the broth is not TOO salty, but at the same time, it still has enough flavor to enjoy!
3. Fukumimi Ramen - they say this is their most popular dish (maybe because it's the name of their restaurant?) Either way, I do like this! 

This place has a stamp card for loyal guests and you are rewarded with free karaage which is Japanese fried chicken (with lemon juice) and it is also very delicious!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,5,4,5,j77VdzQVkUbzfaNNKZqkaA

The waitress was very nice and the rest of the staff also seemed very friendly. However, I was less than impressed with the food. 

Gyoza: So many people raved about these dumplings in the reviews, I thought it was a must try thing. In my personal opinion, the gyoza was less appetizing than the frozen pot stickers I can purchase from Costco.

Mini Chashiu Bowl: I do not think the meat that topped the rice could even be called meat...let alone pork. The rice also tasted a bit over cooked (soggy). 

Ramen: The broth is good, but nothing worth travelling to. The noodles were mediocre and the only really great thing to rave about in this bowl was the soft boiled egg, and i think it's harder to mess up an egg than it is to make it delicious!

Food:
Kara-age (Japanese Fried Chicken): 5/5
Very delicious, it comes with a side of mixed greens with house dressing and grey salt. It actually didn't even need the grey salt because the Karaage was already lightly salted but it was a nice compliment to gourmet salts.   

Fukumimi Miso Ramen: 4/5
LOVED the broth, it was very smooth and flavorful without the super saltiness of Monta (although I still love Monta). If you know me or have read my reviews you know I LIKE IT SPICY. So I drown my soup with sesame oil and Japanese chilli power Togarashi. Their Tamago (egg) was delicious! I just wished they soaked it in the marinade a bit longer, it looked very light but still delicious. The soft boil was perfect and yolky. Their Cashu pork was equally delicious and soft, I just wish they gave you more than just 1 slice but not too much, I felt if I order the extra (3+slices) it would've been too over the top. 

Service: 4/5
It was surprisingly empty when I went around 5pm on a Saturday, but the staff was still very nice and attentive and up beat even if they were slow. Our waitress was very nice and explain our questions very well. Except my table didn't get any straws for our waters and my friend said other tables were given straws. So I have this dislike of drinking water in restaurants from the rim of a cup where multiple people have had their mouths there too. lol

I was intrigued by the Tan Tan Men (I prefer Tan Tan Women...groan, I know). Since starting this Ramen quest of mine, I've started to experiment at home with making my own version of Tan Tan (Wo)Men. I was curious how Fukumini's meat compared to Sora's and mine. The flavor profiles of all 3 are very similar with tasting the likeness of Toban Djan (Chili Bean Sauce), sweetness from Mirin and hints of garlic. I think my recipe is pretty close.
Service was excellent and on point. We arrived just before the dinner rush and were seated right away. There was a bit of anxiety on our part during the first few minutes of walking in as the aromas permeating  were quite unpleasant and offensive. But the poopy odor soon dissipated and were replaced by more pleasant cooking bouquets.
We started with an order of GYOZA which was the best I've had. It was well seasoned and something better than any of the dumplings I've had in Chinatown.
The TAN TAN MEN was delicious! Flavorful rich broth that wasn't too salty and thick noodles that had a nice chew to them. My bowl was the envy of everyone at my table who ordered other varieties such as the Classic Ramen in a chicken based broth and the Tonkatsu Soy Ramen. Fortunately for my MIL, they offered a low sodium version of each broth to save her from sporting kankles. My wife who is a picky eater, which is why I suggested the Classic Ramen, wanted to switch with my bowl of Tan Tan Men after tasting it. Being the picky eater, she gives me her Chashu so I thought it would be a win/win situation. We will probably be back sooner than later so she can get her Tan Tan Women.  The Chashu was very tender. My daughter didn't enjoy her Tonkatsu Soy Ramen as much because she said it wasn't as well seasoned, but getting her nana's accidental order of extra Chashu made up for it.
I think Fukumini will be a regular spot for us to hit up on cold nights since it's on our side of town and similar to Ramen Sora. Oishii desu!",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,22,22,4,Fb9fvoL3sPWLN98Ni0ggew

Time sure does fly looking back at my review for 2013. The food hasn't changed, and is just as great as the first time I stepped into this place. What DID change was the amount of consumers! Their door was partially open and come to find out it was because a bunch of people were squeezed in the enterance waiting to be seated due to the cold weather (yes, it actually gets cold in Vegas). I don't recommend coming with a big group unless you arrive early.

I'm actually glad I had to wait 30 minutes for a table and it's actually the only reason I'm bumping up this review to a 5th star. During the whole time, I got to witness the two awesome waitresses kill it on the ramen floor! Not once did I see them take a break during the rush which was really impressive. The cooks were also on top of everything, making sure the food was coming out at a stead-fast pace. Great teamwork, guys!... and ladies;)

Had to try something new which happened to be Kogashi Ramen for the chilly afternoon. The only way I can describe it is by the char taste it had? It wasn't bad, just different. My date had the Tonkotsu which by far is my favorite right next to Fukumimi itself. Karaage this time around was perfect! I already made my choice to have the Spicy Miso and Honey Garlic Chicken for my next visit since there's only a hundred photos of it uploaded.

Ambience is very clean and on the average side for noise level, so there's no reason for you not to stop by for some great ramen.

I have been here several times with my BF and we always order the same thing because it's so damn good! I order the Soy Ramen which is a thinner soup base compared to the Miso Ramen. It can be a little salty but nothing too overwhelming. It comes with noodles, a boiled egg, a thin slice of soft char siu pork, a piece of seaweed, and bean sprouts (which I ask for on the side). As for the taste, it is very savory, fresh, and original.

As for my BF, he orders the Tantanmen which is a chile base ramen. I have ""tried"" it but never really eaten it. He loves it, but from what I have tried, it is a little spicy from the chile, and has a very herby and earthy kind of taste (I think they use sriracha for flavoring). It comes with bok-choy, noodles, a scoop of ground beef, and some other vegetable. You'll definitely want to get a side of rice with this one.

Sodas are served in a can, I don't think there are free refills. Items can also be made to-go.

Restaurant is located on Eastern in an older plaza and is right next to a Baskin Robins (which tastes great after eating here, since it can be a little salty).

4571689,2012-12-02,7,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"Before today, I didn't get it.
My idea of ramen was of the six cent variety.
When I went to Japan this year, I knew to avoid Ramen because it was pork-based, and I never went to Monta or Sora because I was told the point of ramen is pork broth.
As everyone would guess, my inability to try a tasty Japanese dish is rather difficult.  I just assumed it was noodles and broth with lots of sodium.  However, upon learning Fukumimi had chicken ramen, I knew I could finally taste what the excitement is all about.
After proctoring the LSAT today, I worked up quite an appetite and headed over to Fukumimi.  I ordered the chicken ramen and not long after, the chef brought out to me a steaming bowl.
The bowl was a huge amount, with broth, noodles, chicken ""chasiu"", bean sprouts, negi (green onions), and a half egg.  This chicken broth would make a Jewish grandmother's toes curl!  It was sooooo flavorful.  I have had my chicken soup training (my aunt told me it would make me marriageable) but mine does not have this richness.
The broth itself is a star, but with the noodles, sliced chicken, green onions, sprouts, and the soy-soft boiled egg, it is truly a great balanced meal.  The noodles were the perfect texture, and I added some shichimi to add some spice to the bowl.
I saved the egg for the end, and it was perfectly cooked.  I love eggs like this!  This was truly OISHI!  The chef told me he is from Kyoto, so we talked about Kyoto and I showed him a few pictures from when I visited this May.
Chicken ramen with tax is only $8.11.  If you are like me and prefer that pigs fly rather than sizzle, this is the only spot in town to indulge in ramen.  The restaurant itself is quaint and clean, the staff is very friendly, and the food is yum (though my options are limited!) - they gave me a stamp card so for every 4 bowls of ramen I buy, I get a free kara-age (or you pork eaters get a free gyoza).
Now that I had it ""as is"" I can add corn and seaweed to it when I am a tad hungrier :)",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,12,11,5,nf62LYqGZmwzLEv4HFV9Xg

Had stomach cramp that afternoon and continuous diarrhea all morning the next day. Not a pleasant experience. Not coming back because i don't think their ramen is that great either. Also halfway through the meal a delivery guy came in with boxes of produce and just walked straight through the middle of the restaurant to the back.

My one and only visit was on a Saturday morning...and I was there right when they opened the doors. Parking is great and at that time of morning there was no line...although the place did fill up fast. 

I sat at the counter and had a great view of the kitchen which can be a double edged sword. While the kitchen was clean and the staff worked well together, things started to sour for me when I saw a box of Sysco produce come out of the back. I know Sysco supplies a lot of the businesses in the valley but this just turned me off. After watching the kitchen for a bit my bowl of ""spicy"" fukumimi ramen finally arrived. 

For a dish that was supposed to be spicy I reached for the spices a lot. And the charsiu....was ok, but not as good as other places I've had around town. The broth was good, but yet I've had better. Long story short for the East side....this is passable. But it's not all that. 

Let's be blunt. Ramen Sora smokes this place. And while Monta is a bit of a drive for me and Fukumimi will do in a pinch when I can't get to Monta...the fact is Monta kicks their derriere all over the place and still stands supreme as the best bowl of ramen I've had yet. 

I will go back and try Tetsuro's Tan Tan Men recommendation but for now...it's good...but not great. I'm giving Fukumimi a 3 Star reality check.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,4,1,3,8MHmLzIeF4x6erRzsVPfnQ

Their honey ginger chicken appetizer is so good! And it's free after your 4th purchase (or there's also other appetizers.)
The spicy tonkatsu definitely had a kick. Regular tonkatsu is a good go to. It did seem a little creamier and less pork-tasting than I'm used to though. 
I like the thick noodles that they use, haven't tried the thin. They don't give you that much, though. Their onsen egg is good, but you can tell its prepared and not cooked fresh. The toppings are a little underwhelming too. I don't remember there being the usual green onions or bamboo shoots that most ramen places put in. 
I think I would've left still hungry if it wasn't for the appetizer.

I heard ALL the buzz about the major players and decided I finally needed to give them all a whirl for my own Battle Ramen.

Fukumimi was my second stop of the three. My fiancé (who is a HUGE fan of ramen!) and I came for dinner and had amazing timing - no wait and we got a table next to the window. I ordered the Tantan Men (Szechwan style spicy W soup of pork and chicken, with sesame sauce and red chili oil, topped with seasoned ground meat and bok choy) and Ruben ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. We also ordered a side of Curry Rice (small) and Gyoza.

Our verdicts? Meh. Everything was good, but not as good as other ramens we enjoyed in town. I like the Tantan Men's unique flavor and depth, but I didn't love it over other Tonkotsu and Miso broths I've had. It was also the first time I couldn't finish my bowl. Ruben preferred the noodles and broth of other ramen shops. He also didn't think it was spicy enough (the guy has a stomach of steel). The curry was good; reminded me of the Japanese curry I ate back home (Hawaii). The gyoza was tasty too and I loved their dipping sauce.

For both of us, this is our last choice compared to Monta and Sora. We also determined that it was definitely a preference, not the quality or taste of the individual ramen shops. Even both of us like different ramen. What we could agree on was that we didn't like the noodles here (I like the thicker, wavy noodles with more bite).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,2,3,WyTdFh2dzZzwH8GStFM7xg

I've been to plenty of other Ramen places on the west side and California, and I can tell you Fukumimi is one of the best so have ever been to for the price. A party of two will struggle to get a bill over $30 here. This is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm watching my wallet.

They have appetizers that range from $2 to $5 (that's really the most expensive, $5...). They make their on Kimchi and I love the Kimchi tofu, which is only $4. I also love their house salad, which is nothing more than greens with their house ginger dressing. My wife has to get it every time, as it is a simple and delicious salad for only $2.

They also have rice bowls, which are their only other entree options besides the Ramen bowls. We've had a few of them before and they are good, though they don't blow me away. The curry bowl is my favorite, though I have had better Japanese curry. None of the bowls will probably disappoint you, but I would stick to the Ramen.

The Ramen ranges in price from $7 to $9, which are pretty decent prices given the portion size. They have all the typical tonkotsu Ramens as well as chicken Ramen. They also have Tantan Men, which is a spicy peanutty broth with ground pork. Not every Ramen spot had this dish, but it is well worth trying if the description above sounds good to you. The Tantan Men is my favorite and seems to be very popular here. They also offer quite a few extras like extra meat, noodles or veggies (see the menu, I took a pic).

Oh, and they have $2 dollar Miller lights! And that's not just a happy hour special that's all the time. Most bars in town don't sell domestic beer that cheap. Though don't get me wrong, this isn't really a drinking spot. They only have a few beers and nothing stinger. Though it is a bargain price for a beer at a restaurant.

Not much in the way of dessert here. Though there is a Baskin Robins next door.

Where else can you go, get two beers, a salad, an appetizer and two entries for $26. That was our last bill here, and we were stuffed with delicious food. If you want  to eat well on the cheap, this place is a gem.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,5,cjntI5fHPb_UnN99HnbAOA

Taste: the broth was okay. Wasn't anything special. I had the tonkotsu ramen (salt). It was okay, didn't have a whole of flavor. My girlfriend has the tonkotsu ramen (spicy), she thought it was pretty spicy. I had a taste and I didn't think it was that spicy or had that much flavor. 

Service: the staff were very friendly. Nothing to complain about.

Overall: I would say if you are in the area and want some ramen without having to drive far, then come here. If you want the best (in my opinion) go to Monta in Chinatown or Henderson.",5fgdsVzfzLQPEhWRoWTOdg,1,0,3,FH2kbG2mu3d-vlavraHl2g

When I came across this place serving tan tan mein noodles I went bizarre about wanting to try some. I came during lunch time on a weekday and it was pretty packed so I took that as a great sign. The place is on the smaller side but it made me feel at home in Japan even with the modern design. I sat on a tiny two person table towards the wall. When the nice pretty asian lady came to take my order it was a big dissapointment from the start. I was in the middle of ordering and the table next to me began speaking to her in her native tongue and she straight up left me with the words in my mouth to get them sodas. Kind of rude I would say! I asked for an order of gioza and they told me they did not have any! WHAT? Why have it on the menu if you do not serve it, let alone carry it? You can not eat ramen and not accompany it with gioza! So I ordered tan tan mein noodles with much anticipation. When my bowl arrived, the bowl looked liked they had poured milk in it. The noodles were creamy?!?! Real tan tan mein noodles are composed of a spicy broth not a spicy milky broth like if it was curry. I understand there are many versions on how to make tan tan mein but this one was wayyyyy too creamy The ground pork was alright but it did not have great consistency, it was a bit like sand in my opinion.

I would give this place more of a 3.5 to be honest as I wasn't exactly a fan of the broth I had. Something felt like it was missing.

I had the spicy tonkstsu ramen and maybe the spicy was overkill to the point I could not appreciate the broth itself or what I was eating. It's not that it was too spicy, just it masked all the other flavors of my ramen. Could be causing why I'm not giving the 5.

Noodles - definitely fresh and perfectly chewy so that's good! Next time I'll be back to try the thin noodles as the thick ones are a bit overwhelming as well.

Either way it does warrant another visit to verify but I do believe in first impressions.

If I'm feeling hungrier than usual, I always get the Fukumimi Ramen. It comes with bean sprouts, 3 pieces of seaweed, extra pieces of chashu, green onions, half an egg, and thin noodles. Price point wise, I think you get more for your money at this place than other shops. There's usually always a wait for this if you go around 7p so get there at 6 if I don't want to wait, but it does go by fairly fast. Try the gyoza and the agedashi tofu. They also have the best stamp system I've seen. 4 bowls of ramen and bam! You get a free appetizer. Pretty simple to achieve... I just never remember to bring my stamp card or I lose it.

Pros: Unlike Monta, the wait is maybe 5 minutes as opposed to 45.
- Prices are very very reasonable, you can be full and happy for less than $10
- Seriously delicious toppings, and most of their ramen comes with them already added, so you don't need to look like a confused white person quite as much.

Cons: Something about the thinner, firmer noodles compared to Monta just wasnt as enjoyable.
- Almost a little too salty broth

Ramen is one of our favorite dishes and we are always up for trying new places. We thought that maybe we would be able to find a new ramen spot. When we first looked at the menu we were surprised by the low prices, the lowest we've seen. Especially with it coming with corn and chashu?! We thought that was awesome. I ordered the Tonkatsu, miso ramen with nori (which our server didn't refer to as nori and seemed a bit confused until she realized it was seaweed). 

After a short wait, and being served I realized why the prices were so low. The bowls are really small and they actually don't have much food in them at all. After my first sip of the broth, I was sadly let down. There was almost no flavor. In my entire bowl I maybe had about 10 kernels of corn and 1 piece of chashu. I wish I had known. I would've asked for extra and paid for the extra. My bf ordered the Kara-miso, spicy miso ramen and he was so disappointed. The broth tasted like hot sauce. He ordered the chashu bowl as well and was honestly more excited about that.

After finishing our food, we awkwardly waited for about 15 minutes for someone to come back and bring us our check. The new server even took the couple's order next to us, ignored me, took care of two other tables before she acknowledged me and brought us our check. 

There is honestly nothing special here. The ramen tastes instant and I really hope the ramen in Japan has something better to offer than this place. We left feeling very unsatisfied.",rqKCE0ASDODEd3IHlRI-OA,6,0,2,8XNJ39l__on6lWjVVMRzXQ

ZERO SPICINESS

I'm really unhappy with my meal here. 

First I ordered the tan tan men. The menu said that it was spicy. It was NOT, so I asked for spicy sauce. The waitress gave me some chilli flakes that had zero spice. Then I ordered chilli PASTE. The paste wasn't spicy either! It was pretty much gochujang and just made my soup sweeter. :/

I literally finished the noodles in under 5 minutes!! I got a few small bites out of the bowl and then I was done. I was so shocked! 

I ordered another bowl because I wasn't even full yet.(I don't even eat that much btw)

Then I got the ""spicy"" miso. It was not spicy either....!! The egg and the pork were good, the broth sucked! So I hurried and ate it and got out of there. 

I spent $20 to get full and I'm a small girl with a small appetite.

Reviews from Judd L, Nelson Q and Lisa R were making my pavlovian response take over and we went there on Sunday afternoon about 1:30 pm on a New Year weekend. Would have been perfect if the tour bus of people weren't there occupying the whole place....

1.  Ambiance - Small, perhaps it can seat about 35 people using all seats and  counter area.  Clean, small waiting place, open kitchen

2. Bathroom - You know how I am about asian restaurants (usually chinese) with good food and terribly awful bathrooms. Well this place is elegant.... Gotta have nice toilet ambiance to really relax....

3.  Service - I really like going to a noodle place and not everyone is yelling Irashaimasu so loud that I feel like I am at Disneyland.  The staff is very nice, efficient, pleasant, well mannered, attentive, japanese speaking.

4.  Food 

Karaage - Oh this is a delicate and tender morsel of chicken.  Steaming hot, incredibly tasty.  It does not get better than this.

Edamame - Traditional with your basic salt and not all the fancy stuff like other places. This is just right to whet your appetite.

Chicken Bowl - If you are not liking or feeling like slurping, then this is it. I would probably have ordered the Chicken Curry Rice Bowl, as this one looked tasty but a bit sparse.  The wifey ordered it and we were all just getting over colds, so really did not share.

Fukumimi Ramen - A bit of pork belly, tonkotsu, egg, seaweed, very tasty and very nice broth. The broth was not over powering and was very simple but tasty.

TanTan Ramen - Interesting. Not too spicy, a more complex broth and a bit over powering. I prefered the delicate and light broth of the Fukumimi Ramen.

Miso Ramen - Tonkotsu with the miso sause.  My daughter liked it and she is quit the critic, so this must have been good.

The ramen here is interesting in that it is tonkotsu based yet have options of different flavors such as miso, shio, etc, but not plain tonkotsu.  They also have tan tan men but it was sold out so I went for spicy tonkotsu and my daughter tried tonkotsu miso along with a side of karaage.  

Tonkotsu spicy was fantastic.   You can definitely taste the rich tonkotsu base but the spicy miso with which it is flavored with added a thick kotteri flavor full of umami.   Excellently executed.   Tonkotsu miso was closer to tonkotsu than a miso ramen in my opinion and it was very good, probably better than monta.   As this is more of a tonkotsu place, it should not be compared to Sora.   Chicken karaage was perfectly done with a slice if lemon, flavored salt into which you can dip the chicken and a small salad.  

My only complaint is that I didn't get to taste the tan tan men and that it's on the East side far away from my house.  I would rate their tonkotsu higher than that of montas as I have noticed some inconsistencies in monta recently.

It also has the pleasant drops of garlic oil on top too.  Midway through his ramen, he bit into a hard chunk of noodles.  It appeared that some of the noodles were stuck together and never got cooked through.  We showed the waitress the clumped up noodles and she took his ramen away.  She asked if he would like another one and got that order in immediately.  She apologized profusely and checked often to make sure the second round was fine.  It was and the Husband ate it all up.

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Miso flavored ($8.20).  Along with the standard pork belly, green onions, seasoned egg, and bean sprouts, mine came with corn too.  No garlic oil unfortunately.  My soup was creamy and full-bodied and very rich.  Quite tasty in my opinion.  I was pleased with my soup choice.  I also liked their soft boiled egg, the seasoning part of it made it even tastier.

Other unique choices on their menu include: the Tantan Men which is a Szechuan style spicy soup with ground meat and bok choy; and the Tomato Ramen which is a cold ramen with sesame sauce and vinegar.  There are also rice bowls available should ramen not be on your craving.

However, last night I had the worst service from the server on the right (If anyone knows her name, lmk). I brought a few of my friends over here who have never ate at this restaurant before.

First of all, she switched my friends' orders. It could have been an easy fix, but she told my friend that she HAD TO EAT the Tantan men that my friend didn't order. The server loudly said to her co-worker ""I'm not paying for that!"" If that server handled the situation in a non-escalating manner, she would have gotten a big tip from us - party of 10 (and use some of that tip money to ""pay for the ramen"").  On top that, this particular server was slamming objects around. She did not refill our waters or check up on us.

My friend ordered the Chicken Karaage and it was delicious. The drizzled mayo on top looked overwhelming but it wasn't surprisingly. Though, I felt that the chicken was undercooked due to it's chewy texture instead of firm. The batter helped with a crunch and overall we enjoyed it.

We also got a Chasu bowl, I have never tried one before but I found it tasteful. 

Every time I try a Japanese restaurant I have to try their Agedashi Tofu. My favorite dashi sauce is at Ichiza in Chinatown but Fukumimi's Agedashi is coming up at number two. Two really good sized deep fried tofu pieces and their dashi sauce was not salty at all like some other places. FIVEEEEE STARS!! 

As for the ramen, I got the Kogashi and my friends all got the Tonkatsu (Miso). 

I was very pleased with the Kogashi. I don't even know how to describe it. It was perfectly salted and the broth was very good. The noodles were thin and that's how I like it although I didn't know there were bean sprouts, not fond, but I ate them anyways.

We are pretty much creatures of habit and always get the same thing when we come. The chicken karage appetizer is so good! Perfectly crispy and a good sized portion - usually about 6-7 pieces. As for ramen, I get the classic Fukumimi ramen. Nothing crazy - thin noodle, green onions, pork belly, seaweed, and soft boiled egg. THE EGG.

In town for a conference and stopped by thanks to Yelpers' reviews. So glad we did!

BEST. KIMCHI. EVER. Ordered a plate of it as an appetizer and ate half of it like that, then ate the rest with the ramen.

Edamame is great. I know edamame seems like it's all created equal, but their soybeans are plump and wonderful. They use a great flaky salt on them, too.

Spicy ramen was amazing. Pork was incredibly tender, and the broth was flavorful and complex! It's good with kimchi in it, too, if you're into that. I am.

The chicken ramen is great. More basic than the spicy ramen, so if you're looking for a flavor experience, go for the spicy. It's not super spicy (at least to me).

They do shio, miso and tonkatsu, tantan men broth. They offer chicken broth based ramen for those who aren't down with the pork base. There are cold noodles salads, rice bowls and some appetizers as well. 

I haven't had tantan men ramen in ages, but I used to be in love with it when I was a kid. It's a bit Chinese influenced ramen, with a chile sesame soup with ground meat, scallion, bok choy. If you like dan dan noodles, you probably would enjoy this. Fukumimi has a solid tantan-men with a good broth and nicely chewy noodles. 

Mini chasu bowl was also good and for a ""mini"" it was a sizeable portion. The only thing is I thought it was going to be sliced chasu like what is in the ramen, which I think I prefer. Instead, it is shredded up pieces that seems to be mixed with a bit of soy. 

I also tried a bite of my cousins karaage. It wasn't bad, but could have been a tad more crispy even though I enjoyed the flavor and texture overall.

The service was decent enough, my drink was refilled a few times throughout the meal.

Noodles - hardly seasoned but chewy.  Check.
Chashu - tender porky goodness.  Check.

Ramen that showcases it all - very flavorful ""Fukumimi"" (tonkotsu topped with everything).  Check.

The broth is so intense, you can't see the noodles through its mustard yellow liquid.  Tender baby bok choi breaks the one dimensional texture.  Thanks you Godzilla X for bringing this elixir to my attention. 

PC Tip:  While manners dictate you should drink all the ramen broth,  those with a weak constitution or first time connoisseurs should make an exception for very rich and spicy tantan men.   Just sayin.

The Karaage is my kind of fried chicken. Lightly breaded, lightly fried, nice and moist. However, maybe it was the batch we got but it seemed under seasoned. Nothing some chili flakes (they didn't have togarashi) and sriracha can't fix but I wonder if the breading was supposed to have more spice? They gave us a frequent diner card that'll get us a free app every few bowls. Without a doubt, karaage will be my choice.

Just saying, whoever designed this menu needs a lesson in menu-writing. And I don't mean graphics! It's totally confusing! There are so many options: Fukumimi Ramen, Tan Tan Men, Shoyu, Shio, Miso, Tonkotsu, blah blah blah. I can totally appreciate options, but there isn't enough description to figure out which one to order. A well-written menu doesn't make you scratch your head; it's supposed to inspire you to eat, well, everything.

With my menu rant over with, I'm back to talking about how much I love the food. After a few questions to the waitress (who was super nice might I add), I finally decided on the Fukumimi Ramen with the Miso broth (you have a choice).  I think the Fukumimi bowl is like your ""deluxe"" bowl at Sora: half an egg, a couple slices of pork, a few nori, menma, green onion. Then of course you can add any extras you desire.

Broth was rich and flavorful without being too salty. They add black garlic oil at the end which adds even more depth. Noodles aren't as thick as I like but still nice and chewy. I swear, with all these ramen places opening, there are so many different types of charsiu in Vegas now. Their pork is less tender than most places and more chewy. It was also cut really thick. I'm all for delicious pork but because it didn't just melt in your mouth it was a little more difficult to eat.

Fukumimi runs a little east for me. UNLV is as far east as I usually go so I probably won't be here as much as I like. If I'm in the area though, I'm for sure going to try to stop by.

With my affinity for small mom and pop businesses this was totally a place for me and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint one bit!
When I walked it, it had a very welcoming environment. You're greeted as you walk in the door and are told to pick a seat of your liking. A menu is presented, one with few choices but those few choices are there because that is what they specialize in and what you will love even if at first you think you won't. I chose the Japanese fried chicken to start. The seasoning was perfect! Simple seasoning of salt, white pepper, floured then deep fried. Super juicy and tender served along a mixed greens salad with a Japanese vinaigrette. Very tasty! The ramen that I selected was the Tonkatsu Ramen (salt). I am a big fan of this type of ramen so when I ordered it I had very high expectations. The presentation of the ramen was beautiful. The stock was dark and full of flavorful collagen, the pork was cooked to perfection the point of it falling apart in the broth and the half egg on top had a perfectly creamy yolk that any egg lover would die for. The ramen noodles were al dente as well. The base of the ramen was extremely flavorful. You could tasted the love and time that it took to make this delicious dish.

FOOD:
- karaage - good! Not too bready, served piping hot with a small salad and you dip it into their salt/pepper mix. We dipped it into the chili powder and that made it even yummier!
- Fukumimi ramen - this was pretty good! Rich broth, but not too salty. Generous portions of noodles (on the thinner side, kinda soba-ish)
- Tantan men (with an egg added) - rich, thick and creamy broth. The ground pork was sweet and savory at the same time and the noodles were more eggy and curly.

SERVICE:
Can't complain! Seated right away, food came out hot and quick. Friendly smiles all around. 

VENUE:

We ordered the agadashi tofu, karaage, and the honey garlic chicken as appetizers.
The agadashi tofu was standard. Nothing particularly about it made it special. I wish that there was daikon radish included. Daikon radish probably made me like the dish more.
The karaage truly was delicious. It came out very hot. It was crispy and the meat inside was extremely juicy and flavorful. I don't know how it is marinated but whatever it is, somehow the karaage is very special.
The honey garlic chicken lacked of garlic flavor and it was more towards the sweet side. It made me think of barbecue sauce. The sauce would have tasted better on rice.
As for ramen, I had a regular tonkatsu miso ramen. I took out the bean sprouts. I believe that bean sprouts add an unnecessary crunch to ramen. The chasiu was very tender and melted in my mouth. The ends were seasoned with pepper which I found interesting. Soft boiled eggs are my favorite part of ramen and unfortunately here the egg was simply over cooked in my opinion. The broth was very hearty and satisfying though.

Never forget to try all their ramen, even the spicy one! I always go for the classic ramen but from time to time I pick the Miso Ramen and don't forget the gyoza! Their karaage is a bonus, the flavor was just right.

The ramen - at first glance, the bowl is smaller than your normal bowl which means less broth. The broth itself was probably the best quality of this meal. Next would noodles, no complaints. These are decent noodles. The cha shiu could be juicer with more fat to lean meat proportion and the soft boiled egg is prepared cut in half, which you already know it does not have an oozing yolk.

The chicken was too salty and the fried batter was too thick. The mayo sauce on top makes it too heavy and even greasier. I would not get this again.

1. No greeting. Very slow service

2. We ordered honey chicken because it looked really good in picture. But when we took a bite, the chicken was raw. So we complained. It sounded like they hear a lot of complaints like this. So without even looking at the chicken, they said it is dark meat, so it will be little bit red. 
I have servesafe manager certification and I work in the kitchen. I know the difference between darkmeat being red and chicken being raw. However their response was ""even though we cook again, it will be red. Do you still want it?"" So of course we told them NO. And asked them to bring us menu to order new dish

3. They did not bring us a menu after the chicken incident. So we had to walk up to the counter to get a menu.

4. I have never been to any ramen place that does not serve ramen in 15 minute when I literally ordered just one ramen.

5. I normally don't care about the service. Since what I want from the restaurants is good food. However, their below average service pissed me off. No greeting. No saying thank you or enjoy or here is your bill.

6. They got 0 tip from us. Only thing they served that was good was a can of coke.

I seriously dont know why this place has good review. If you know how to enjoy ramen, go run away from this place. There are plenty good options out there. This one is not even worth to give a shot for change. Please believe me.",fp-mzt-_ImnSjxNdBbTmrw,0,1,1,A0GdWuNi8N0k2zW0kT0y2w

      - Area - Being on the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, the neighborhood is not as great.
      - Decor - However, the inside looks newly renovated and completely different from the outside surroundings.
      - Saltiness - I like the salt level at this place. It's not too salty like some of the other ramen places around town.
      - Pork Belly - Their pork belly is just delicious. It's probably about as good as the one from Ramen Sora.
      - Flavors - The flavors are salt (shio), soy (shoyu), miso, and spicy. I particularly like shio for its simple, yet elegant flavor. The broth for miso and spicy are a little too thick for me.
**Ordered**
      - $9.50 Fukumimi Ramen - Their version of the deluxe ramen. It has pork belly, egg, seaweed and sprouts.
      - $3.90 Karaage - Lacking in flavor, but you can't pretty cheap for what you get.
**Recommendations**
      - I'd recommend this place for a nice authentic ramen restaurant.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,5,3,4,gJKFYd9XDD7GMtPV7AU0zw
5367387,2018-03-23,1,W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,"This is our go-to ramen place. It's always pretty packed but the wait is worth it. The food is consistent so we always know we're in for a good meal. 

Today we ordered -
Tonkotsu Ramen (miso) - the broth is pork based. The flavors are well developed and ridiculously delicious. This one comes with the thicker noodles, which I prefer, chashu, egg, and corn. I always order this or the spicy miso.
Original ramen - this one has a chicken based broth and you can taste the difference. It's a little lighter than the pork based broth but just as flavorful. This one comes with the thinner noodles, chashu, egg, and bean sprouts. My kiddo always orders this one. 
Honey-Garlic chicken - oh man, this is a must order. We get it every time. It's the karaage chicken coated in a sweet and savory sauce then drizzled with some kind of mayo-looking sauce and topped with sesame seeds. It's crispy on the outside and always juicy on the inside. 
Chashu bowl - this was our first time ordering a bowl. It comes with shredded pork that has a slightly sweet sauce on it, strips of scramby eggs, pickled ginger, green onions, and seaweed all over white rice. The pork was really good and everything mixed together made for a perfect bite. 

The service is always great here. Staff is friendly and helpful. They always offer my kiddo the chopstick trainers, which is a thoughtful touch. Food comes out fast and is always fresh and piping hot. I know there are tons of ramen places in town but this one is, hands down, my favorite.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,2,1,5,ov2slaNLqEboAr_D-Dc3Jg

The karaage chicken is boneless and not the chicken wings like other places try to pass off as karaage. The chicken is lightly coated, crispy on the outside, while the meat is juicy and tender. Paired with the mixed greens tossed in a miso dressing, it was perfect.

I had ordered the tan tan men; a spicy broth mixed with ground chicken and pork. This preparation comes from Chinese influence and incorporates bok choy in it. I thought that it was the perfect balance of richness, a touch of sweetness, and saltiness. I finished mine in no time and started to eat my friend's salt miso when she couldn't finish it. Yet again, I liked the balance in the broth. The color was opaque and it tasted as if bones and meat had been simmering in it for hours. 

The best part was that I still felt full around dinner time. Usually Japanese food leaves me hungry a few hours later. Fukumimi is definitely stick to your ribs kind of food.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,6,5,G3FNkgJ3ZNzQp7KNHZ12Lw

Their ramen options come with two ramen noodle types, thick and thin, which might confuse some people, like it did me, at first. The place is pretty small and is always very busy when Im there. The service can be hit or miss, but overall is quick and friendly. The ramen usually comes out pretty fast as well. 

I always go for traditional tonkotsu miso ramen, but I never find the broth flavor quite satisfying. tonkotsu should have a deep, rich, salty broth, but their broth always seems a bit thin and lacking on the flavor. That said, it will totally satisfy your ramen craving and seem to be very popular. As others have said the noodles are hit and miss, sometimes overcooked sometimes undercooked. I also find it kind of strange that they sell soda in can instead of having a fountain. Overall a pretty decent place if you are craving ramen.",A_dC3FJOqvlsDEiDyMrzlA,1,1,3,N_Q2KyPD2WqvegCwN4rF7Q

This challenge of eating at all the ramen spots in vegas is hard. We decided to order the Fukumimi and Kogashi ramen with curry rice on the side. The Fuku has thin noodles and extra pork in it. WIN! my Kogashi was more garlic infused and had the same toppings as the Fuku. I added chili oil in mine and it was the cherry on top. It was a good amount of ramen to broth.

Our curry rice was a perfect side to balance out the strong flavor of ramen. Our bill came out to $23 and my millennial budget-limited heart soared. I'll take it!

I drank like 4 cups of water and every time I put it down their servers were right there with the water pitcher. Service was on point and quick. We had no wait for a party of 2. They have a small restaurant so be sure to plan out or call in advance if you have a group of 5 or more.

I said to myself, ""this place must be good,"" considering my lady isn't a big ramen eater due to her carb conflicts.  

So we come in on a Sunday after a long night of partying with good friends...once inside, you can immediately smell the fresh handmade ramen being drained from boiling pots...good sign.

The service is fast friendly and accommodating...another good sign. The crowd, diverse and was a good mixture of sophisticated, casual, multi aged and ethnic heads that I would like to think have a respect for some Japanese ramen other than meals out the instant dinner section at your local grocery store.

I checked out the menu and could see myself ordering numerous dishes...so if in doubt, go with the flagship dish, which was the Fukumimi ramen.  Let's throw in some karaage chicken as well...HiYah!

As the bowl came out, it was aesthetically appealing to say the least.  A pair of nori paper sheets lined the far side of the bowl, the ramen was nicely bunched and the broth was drizzled with some additives that made the dish look mouth watering.  

5-7 minutes later...

The bowl was demolished and the verdict is...not bad.  I would say its more on the modern variations of ramen versus the authentic versions Monta offers.  The broth is good and not overwhelming with too much or too little flavoring.  The Chashu is similar to red charsiu roast pork versus the fatty version Monta offers.  I personally like the fatty version, but I can see others settling for the healthier choice. 

I still remember Tenkaippen back in Waikiki, Hawaii, which I worked for a day, and it reminded me began to think of all the ramen places back home, including Goma-Tei that I would say is the closest resemblance that I could compare to Fukumimi.  I would rather Monta, now that I know to add more hot water to their broth since it is a little salty for my taste.  Worth a shot, enjoy.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,2,4,2zVMkTts4NTOQUFhN_6S2A

Knowledge is power!  Ultimately, I prefer the Sora Sapporo style noodles, but the broth at Fukumimi is better--let's fuse those!  Domo arigato to Tetsuro for schooling me.

When we finally found Fukumimi, we were a little skeptical because it didn't look like much from the outside.  It was located in a nondescript seemingly vacant strip mall.  The exterior of the restaurant boasted no more than their restaurant name and a lit ""OPEN""  sign, betraying what we were to soon find out their cozy, modern inside.  The decor was spartan chic in a way that only Japanese can be.

As expected, the menu was fairly limited.  Unlike other places, they offer only rice bowls...no fried rice (I do enjoy Japanese-style fried rice).  Up until this point, the aroma of the restaurant did a lot to convince me that the ramen may be legit.  But I still needed more...so I ordered the purist's favorite tonkotsu ramen.  Hubby went with the Fukumimi special which from what I can gather is just a supersized version of their regular tonkotsu ramen.  We also ordered the recommended karaage as well as a small chicken bowl.

Chicken bowl - comforting, pretty decent, well-flavored
Karaage - BEST I've ever had.  Moist, lightly battered and tender...served with a mini salad and some special salt / lemon wedge
Ramen - The broth was excellent.  Rich without being overwhelming and definitely well-seasoned and flavored.  The garlic oil was a great addition and the egg (of which I ordered extra) was perfectly cooked in that the yolk was jelly-like instead of yellow and chalky.

Service was nice, very friendly...though I don't know why but the ramen chefs seemed to be talking about me, somewhat disconcerting until I got distracted by the food.

I was really waffling over which ramen place to visit on my last trip to vegas because there are just so many that look good! I'm glad I decided on Fukumimi.... hidden in a creepy strip mall next to a closed down discount super market, Fukumimi is definitely nondescript. I was nervous walking in, but it's cute on the inside. My friend and I split their gyoza and I had their spicy ramen with corn. The gyoza were some of the best I've had.... not your typical frozen crappy gyoza you find at many Japanese restaurant... but really crispy flavorful dumplings, worth the money. The real star of the restaurant, however, is the ramen. My spicy ramen had a good heat level....a delicious gooey egg... sweet corn.... chewy noodles.... it was one of the best ramen bowls I have ever had. I ate almost the entire bowl (I seriously almost made myself sick...but so good!). The prices are reasonable and the food is top notch.

My friend had a full stamp card so we got the free chicken karaage, which was pretty much the same as last time, but crispier. I definitely liked how tender the chicken was and the contrast between that and the crispy exterior. However, the batter is already very salty and they still provide dipping salt! I dipped it anyways because i can't control myself around salt ugh.

This time around, I got the tonkotsu salt, which was actually to my liking! At only 7.90 I got a huge slice of tender  chashu, half an egg, some beansprout, and a little bit of green onion. The noodles were tender but not too soft and the broth is not bland (like I mentioned in my last review) but not too salty either! It was light and the slightly smaller-than-normal portion is perfect to make me satisfied.

Service is still the same. The tables and chairs could definitely use some sprucing up. They're all scratched up!

Went yesterday 1-24-16 around 8PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located on Eastern and Tropicana next to Baskin Robbins.  It's kind of a small space....there's room for maybe 20 people.  It was quite crowded. 
. 
For just over $25.00 we got some ramen, two appetizers, two drinks, a salad, a chicken curry, and some tasty corn and rice for my boy.  I was wondering why it was so cheap but then I saw a sign on the wall that said ""Free appetizer with purchase of ramen"".  
.
I got the tonkotsu ramen (soy) and it was a very generous portion.  The broth was flavorful and just the right temperature.  It had a nice big slice of pork, a perfectly soft boiled egg, a sheet of nori, and bean sprouts.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  Next time I think I'll try it spicy! I wanted to add some spice but there are no condiments on the table and I wasn't quite sure what to ask for to make it spicy.  *White girl problems*.  Sriracha?? I dunno. 
. 
Chicken Karaage- Delicious dark meat chicken lightly floured and fried to perfection.  Juicy, flavorful, crunchy, delicious! 
. 
Husband had the chicken curry and was practically licking the bowl after he inhaled it.  I got one bite of it and it was heavenly.  The chicken is mixed into the curry which I've never had before but it was really good.  Their rice is just about the best I've ever had...perfectly cooked, sticky, and aromatic. 
. 
This is really close to my house and I have a feeling they'll be seeing a lot more of me.  My only complaint would be that there is absolutely *no* place to wait inside the restaurant.  The foyer is microscopic.   Also while we were there a young man turned in an application/resume and all the staff members gathered around and laughed at it before they trashed it.  Kinda unprofessional but none of my business.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,13,13,4,tVr1BvtbwrrBNKBiqLffnQ

When youre on the West side, there are greats such as Monta, Sora, and Jinya. I've tried them all so I tried Fukumimi to explore east Vegas ramen. 

It was wednesday night and the place is full. Sign-in sheet available and only two chairs inside for waiting. Theres a counter section that seats about 6-8, and moveable tables for maybe another 20-30. The place is the size of any Monta so I wouldnt recommend huge groups here. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Salt ($7.50) and when it came out, the presentation was great. Nice bowl, nice looking broth, and smelled yummy. But looking down into the bowl, I felt it was a little plain. But nonetheless, I dig in and it hit the spot. 

Again like my reviews for other ramen, I love the thin, straight noodles. However, the noodles in my bowl were clunky and all stuck together. This ruined it for me. It made me assume that they get their noodles from a refridgerated package and they attempt to boil it to loosen it up.

1st visit: mediocre. my order of tonkotsu ramen was suspicious with its weird broth buildup on the top. tonkotsu ramen (salt) $7.50.

2nd visit: hated the tan tan men. $8.95

3rd visit: had tonkotsu ramen (soy) $7.50 and this visit was probably the best of the 3. I actually really liked the noodles this time and the broth was normal compared to my first visit.

Overall, it's very far from my home but I definitely wouldn't be dropping by unless we were in the area and really wanted ramen.

Still worth a try for anyone thinking about it, though. Service is good and the establishment is small & cozy so it's kind of hard for them to ignore you.

I walked in the door at 6:30pm and the place was packed. Maybe 12 people huddled inside waiting for tables. You walk to the counter and put your name on a list, circling yes or no for counter or table. Being a single, I opted for counter and still that took about 20 minutes to get a seat. I almost walked away to my second choice when I first opened the door, glad I decided to wait. 

I had the standard Tokonsu Miso Ramen. Includes a slice of pork belly (recommend adding another), egg, corn. I found the broth to be very good, not salty like Ramen Sora. A nice balance of flavor between the corn and a few light chili flakes didn't make it overly sweet or overly spicy. For me it was perfect, I could taste the chili but it didn't make me walk away as I've been known to do with spicy foods. 

I liked it better than Ramen Sora, and better than Monta (who I really like). The building is small, maybe table room for 16 and counter space for 6.

We decided not to eat there because it was a little busy and we didn't want to be squished up to another party because the restaurant is small.

It was less than a 10 minute drive from the restaurant back to my house, so that was surprising. It also took almost half an hour for us to get our order. 
The food was okay. The curry didn't have anything noticeably special about it. There were no vegetables and the chicken mentioned in the description was also missing. I was glad I got the karaage to go with it. But I was a little disappointed in the karaage. It was a little on the dry side.

What's good though is it's located (hidden) by UNLV next to Baskin Robbins. It's actually pretty good if you don't wanna drive all the way to Spring Mountain or Eastern to eat somewhere else. Their service was friendly and seating was plentiful. They have all different types of broth like miso, spicy miso, soy, etc. The bowls are about $8-$9 and it comes with pork, egg, and mushrooms. You have to add everything else for a tiny cost. We ate on a rainy day so the atmosphere made it perfect for ramen. I enjoyed my time. Just not something that's amazing.

So yes they are added to my safe to eat Japanese food list in Vegas BUT with all of the new ramen-yas that have popped up over the past year I would be hard pressed to come back here after our first and only experience here... 

I know this is a harsh statement but I have good reasoning! So hear me out my faithful followers. Trust me I wanted to love this place...

Me and the gf came here late one night. We were the only patrons I the joint. 
I ordered karaage and Kim chee for starters, a bowl or shoyu ramen and the gf  got miso ramen. 

The karaage was on point! I put my seal of approval on it as being legit Japanese. 
The same can be said for the Kim chee. For those who eat Kim chee on the regular can tell the difference between the Korean and Japanese subtle of Kim chee so kudos for that!

All was fine until the ramen. 
First off it took 15+ minutes for us to get it after we finished the karaage (keep in mind we are the only people in the place) 
Girlfriends bowl comes out first and is a proper bowl of miso ramen. She is nice enough give me a taste while i wait. Noodles maintained a little firmness, the broth a little sweet but still rich and flavorful. All that was missing was a little pat of butter (eh don't knock it until you try it!) So I figure the same nomness can be expected in my bowl... Nope! I got soggy skinny tan tan mein noodles in my shoyu ramen. The error many have gone unnoticed by the unassuming gaigin (white person) whose only comparison is top ramen. But to a Japanese person this was a blatantly obvious  screw job.  It was like they gave me noodles from another order or screwed up my order and said he'll never know.. So sad to say I had a sad bowl of ramen. I think that they knew they screwed up because we were not checked on by the waitress till we were both almost done with our bowls. By that point the noodles would be soggy anyways. No point in crying over soggy noodles right? (Ancient Chinese Proverb) I quickly paid the check and bounced... 

Maybe it was a fluke but it should not have been done and for that I have to say I will not be back...",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,2,1,2,1efhTJ0YwOvWYGhfD-3Otg

Also come early to beat the dinner rush, unless you are not in a rush.  The food here is pretty good. I ordered the Fukumimi Ramen, with all of its extras on my first visit, and the soup was flavorful and very delicious. I did not care for the thin ramen noodle that was served, but that is a personal preference.

The Chicken Karaage was good, but we might have been too polite and let it sit on the plate too long, because it was a little greasy by the time I ate my first piece.

Service is friendly, efficient, even when the restaurant is at full capacity.

A great ramen spot on the east side of town.

Ambiance: 4/5  Cozy little spot that is well lit and clean, with view of portion of the kitchen.  It has no fancy decor, but ramen is fast food and who has time to get distracted by anything except that steamy hot bowl of noodles and brothy goodness once it is placed on your table.

Service:  4/5  No compliant.

Food:  4/5  Wonderful flavor, portion is not huge, but enough to satiate most appetites. 

Price:  4/5  Competitive.

Parking:  4.5/5  Plenty when I went in the evening, even when the restaurant is packed.

I like tonkotsu ramen a lot and this place does not disappoint. Their broth is always hot with egg cook to perfection. I also love their karaage chicken which is lightly crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. It also comes with some greens to help you ease the greasiness and cleanse the palate. 

Our most recent visit was last Saturday at around 2pm. We waited for about 10 minute or so for a table because we usually don't like to take the bar seat. Ramen was nice and hot like how it usually is but this time the karaage has a pink color to it. Karaage was very hot however the inside was slightly pink and we didn't think much about it and finished the entire thing. Later on that night my sister and I both had diarrhea. Mine stopped after one night but hers lasted about 1 day. 

I still like the ramen and karaage at this place but I'm not sure if it's worth it for the chance of getting diarrhea again.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,1,0,3,yMaRcP2KtYg0CauA9wuLaQ

The weather is getting cooler and as I ready my scarves and sweaters, I also look forward to trying new noodle soup places. My OG Ryan B and I decided to embark on a foodie adventure this evening by trying Fukumimi Ramen. It was my OG's first foray into the world of ramen, so we were both excited about this new spot. 

We opted to start with the karaage appetizer and I ordered the spicy ramen with added corn. My OG chose the Tori Ramen. Our food came out quite quickly. The chicken was hot and fresh. Definitely a pleasant surprise. I definitely recommend this as a starter. It had great flavor and was very juicy. The ramen was awesome too. Nice flavor and well-developed broth. The corn added a nice crunch and I always enjoy sprouts. The more of those the better. 

I still prefer Ramen Sora, but I have to say that I did enjoy it a bit more than Monta. I'm so glad to get this checked off my bookmark list and happy that I got to enjoy it with good company. Service was standard and efficient.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,6,4,Q9w5CjtWuXUbRoNlcI8qSw

I ordered it unaware of the spicy part and couldn't finish it because of this, but it was delicious regardless. I like all the dressings put into it, such as shredded seaweed, ginger?, Half egg, etc. Also got the Karaage Chicken which was always a favorite of mine back in Cali. When I went to the tea places that offered this snack...its priced well here for an appetizer, but isn't the exact appetizer I was used to. It doesn't have the white pepper topping and no long wood sticks to eat it with! But does come with lemon slice to add. Bigger than just popcorn chicken, and the order I got was sorta chewy, thus not sure what part of the chicken they used to deep fry! I'd still get it again. I am on my second take out trip here, and trying the Tomato Cold Noodle, in hopes that it is just as delicious as the spicy version.

We arrived past 1 pm and it was pretty busy. People were waiting outside. It's also a very small place. There is the bar and maybe like 10 tables or even less. We would check up inside pretty often, but the hostess was no help at all. It kinda seemed like she didn't know how to seat. I only say that because, we had told her our party would be okay to split. So we sat at two different tables. Then we got moved to sit altogether, and then she asked us to move tables again. Which was kind of annoying because as a hostess, you should have a sense of where to seat people and what would work best. 

The wait for the food was not too bad. & It was pretty good, but I don't think it's anything special. I've had better ramen at other restaurant, with a bigger quantity and the same prices. My friends who even go the spicy ones didn't think it was even that spicy. They just kept adding more chili oil, powder, and paste.
