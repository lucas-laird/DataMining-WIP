I should expect it, coming in on Sunday night NFL. Full cock fest of straight men, what I didn't expect is when the group of guys kept point & laughing  at me and my man. The bartender was laughing & high fiving with them!!!' You obviously don't care about your guests our your life. As a bartender, you pay your bills with your tips yeah? Why take fucking sides? I was going to tip you FAT, as I work in the industry myself. Instead your lucky I gave you $4, my boy had to calm me down the whole time and it was a horrible horrible experience.

We were greeted by the bartender, who told us we could seat ourselves anywhere we liked. We did so, at a table clearly visible to the bar. We sat there for over ten minutes, watching the staff walk around, chat and socialize...and we weren't acknowledged again. No menus, no ""I'll be right over""...just a few glances in our general direction but no effort to provide any sort of service. No one said a word as we got up and walked out.  Drove over to Hash House A Go Go,  and were acknowledged by four or five different staff as we waited for our order.

Only two of my friends ordered food and the other three of us only had about two drinks each. Two of my friends were waiting so long to put their drink order in that they gave up and just ordered at the bar and brought their drink back. Also right before happy hour ended we put two drink orders in and the server responded with ""okay I'll put your order in but it probably won't be happy hour anymore"" my other friend stated we still had like 5 minutes and she replied ""well I guess I'll run"". With a very unpleasant attitude! Of course when it came time to bring us our tabs she was very pleasant in that moment. We all payed separately so we each tipped accordingly keeping the service we received in mind. She probably got a fifteen dollar tip total for the whole table which I think  is pretty good for the service we received especially since it was just a table of 5. Well after paying we headed for the pool tables almost immediately after she approached us. She actually had the nerve to ask us what she did wrong and why we didn't tip her more! She told us she was really upset that we tipped her so low.. I was so shocked it was ridiculous and unprofessional It really made me wish I hadn't left a tip which was just a courtesy really. In the end we felt uncomfortable because all the bartenders and servers were staring at us  so we ended up leaving and most of us agree that we won't be returning to that location.",xK6grS5fuYTcwnLLKPw3TA,0,0,1,LFMOJtnqvLUlkpynu9AArQ

It kind of dark inside but had a nice ambiance. Although quite busy, there were several tables still available. There are pool tables which weren't in use either. 

First off, our waitress said we would have to buy the beer and bites members card in order to get HH prices. PT's never made us buy that, nor did my friend say she needed when going to Sierra Gold previously. Weird. Anyway, that card is $5 but you get $10 to use immediately and you build points on it for whenever you visit and eat there. What also sucks is that their HH is for drinks and thin crust pizza's ONLY. No appetizers. Bummer!

Ordered a couple drinks. I tried one of their specialty drinks call grand smash which was grand marnier, lemongrass syrup, sierra mist and mint. It was pretty delicious!  Also, got bucket of chicken wings, garlic fries and their Gilroy thin crust pizza. The gilroy was awesome!! It had white sauce, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, pepperoni, sausage and tomatoes! SOOOOO good. 

The bathrooms were very very clean! And while washing my hands, I noticed there were tv's in the mirrors!! Cool! lol. Our waitress was very friendly and when my bf asked what beers were on tap.. she pretty much went down the whole list and would have continued if my bf didn't say he got the point. HAHAHA.

Overall, its a little far for me to go to HH often.. but I will return if I'm ever near one again. Its a lot nicer than PT's that's for sure!",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,0,0,4,cCRZLcqnRd4ye8r_QNIcVQ

Mostly the night bartenders are great, but the bartender that works during the day, is HORRIBLE. Only two patrons in the place at noon, and she was rarely at the bar....was hanging out in the kitchen most of the time. And it would take easily, 10 minutes to get another drink from her.

We sat in our favorite seat and the place wasn't too busy. I've seen it busier. The waitress that we had we had once before and she was so terrible but my Mom decided we should give her a second chance. BIG MISTAKE!!! Colleen is by far the worse server we have ever had. She wouldn't look at us she kept telling us to wait before we could have her take our order (20 minutes we waited to place an order) . When she did bring our order she slammed the plate down, while looking in the other direction. We tried to make small talk and she would walk away. She obviously doesn't enjoy her job and made it more than clear we were not a priority to her. When we finished our meal we were discussing if we would get dessert when she shoved the bill holder in my arm and stated, ""you weren't getting dessert were you?"" as she walked away without waiting for our response. We should have never left her a tip but we left her less than 10%. Sad for her we tip between 20-25%. Honestly, if I walk in and she is the only waitress I will leave immediately. She is so bad for your business and you should really think about giving her less hours to be near customers or maybe she should work in the back where she has no contact with people!

Anyways, the pizza was good. In fact it was half price when I went, not sure why since it was so late. They have an ok selection of beers on tap, but all in all the prices are pretty good and theres enough variety to make it worth going to. Everyone I was with enjoyed it.

When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised with how spacious and nice it was. Definitely was not expecting it. There was plenty of table seating and TVs located through out and not only at the bar. It was also pretty cool to see TVs in the bathroom mirrors so you can continue to catch the game and not miss any action!

For the party we had a couple areas reserved for our group and our own waitress as well. The poor waitress was trying to keep up with all our food and drink orders, but overall I think she did a pretty good job despite there being 20-30 of us and only 1 of her. For food we ordered a bunch of appetizers and set it up buffet style for our group to munch on during the party. There were boneless wings (where they apparently serve the sauce on the side?), sliders, fries, and various pizzas. I thought the food was pretty decent for bar food and being able to order them in buckets makes it pretty easy to order in large portions. 

Sierra Gold seems like a pretty chill place to grab a beer and watch sports and it was much less crowded than other sports bars I've been to around town. If only it weren't so far away I would be returning soon to catch some games!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,4,qmsdhMX51PtTX3IDQ2sPwQ

My friends and I arrived at 9:30 am Sunday expecting to fight for a television.  Since we had specific needs- the Cowboys game on 1 television, and the Eagles game on the other, we were unsure if it was going to be possible. 

We set up in a booth that was surrounded by 4 televisions. As soon as the server came over to greet us, I immediately asked if she could accommodate our viewing needs.  Done! In five minutes, we had our games on, and our food ordered.

If you are a proud member of their BEER & BITES club (free to sign up), food is half off before 10:00 am. As a result, I was able to get my Sunday started with a pretty decent breakfast. Scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast for $3.99- YAY!  Oh, and their pizzas are half-off during happy hour- if you are into paper thin crust pizza. I tried the pizza, and thought it was just OK. However, if you drink enough beer- I am sure you will enjoy it.

The atmosphere was laid back, with a private room to watch football if you want to reserve it. They have a few pool tables and a Golden Tee arcade game if you are not into watching football. 

The service was good initially, but tapered off once we ordered our food. It was almost like it was unheard of to order lunch after eating breakfast 3 hours earlier. Prices are good, food is edible, and the vibe is comfortable.

Was told we did not need a reservation and the woman who I spoke to over the phone recommended the private lounge area so that we could close the curtain to block off the noise and crowds. I thought that was a wonderful suggestion. We confirmed the time my group would be there. This was about 3 weeks out from the date we would arrive.

When our group arrived, the host and other staff had our room ready for us, with water and cups, napkins and silverware/cutlery arranged around the seating area. The private area is nice and cozy-lots of leather oversized chairs mixed with soft ottoman/seats and regular tables in between. We arranged the furniture to accommodate our needs but were sure to return it back to how we found it when we arrived. There is a big fire place at the back of the room as well.

Our drink and food orders were taken right away, and the host was very attentive. Our food was delicious and better than average bar food. Aside from our (HALF PRICED DURING HAPPY HOUR! drinks), we ordered and shared: chicken quesadilla, nachos, fried mozzarella, BBQ Pork potato skins, and artichoke dip. 

We had the room reserved for 2 hours and were actually sad when our time was up. We could have kept playing Cards Against Humanity and talking for much longer than that. We were given our checks, and again the host had no problem with the large group of us each having a check and each having a different method of payment.

Thankfully, I live in Vegas now and this is quite a frequent occurrence. Sierra Gold is our go-to for breakfast and a few drinks after a long night at work.

The bartenders are great. Friendly, attentive and they make me smile in the morning before a 6:00AM flight. What makes me smile even more? Gluten Free Crispin cider ON TAP. Only $7 for a large pint to start the day? Yes please! Forget the calories, give me the cider, which, by the way, tastes amazing on tap. Let's get to the food, because other than gambling away my funds, that's what we come here to do.

Specials: 1/2 off breakfast from 6:00AM-10:00AM with players card. I would still pay full price for the breakfast though, but moving on.

Pizza: I haven't eaten the pizza, but friends and my fiance have, and it was pretty good for Vegas pizza. Yes, we are pizza snobs coming from a city that prides their pizza as the best pie in the country. Go to Gino's East and you'll understand...or Pizzeria Uno...maybe even Lou Malnati's. I digress. Get the pizza at Sierra Gold topped with meats and veggies and you'll be good to go.

Breakfast. Oh the omelets. I had to go here twice in a row one week because I found my happy omelet with bacon, guacamole and pepper jack cheese. Perfect amount of cheese, not like the Omelet House that makes my arteries scream for lean proteins. Perfect amount of guacamole and crispy, crispy bacon. I have a pet peeve about restaurant bacon. Crispy or go home. Sierra Gold did it just right.  My fiance get's the Miner's Breakfast which is sausage, peppers, breakfast potatoes, ham, onions, bacon and more, topped with delicious eggs and cheddar cheese. My fiance does not like scrambled eggs but eats these scrambled eggs in a heartbeat. The sourdough bread looks incredible. Big thick slices, toasted perfectly. You can also get wheat, rye and white. Excellent choices. One issue with the breakfast? The breakfast potatoes are nothing to write home to Mom about. They're fine, just nothing as good as the omelet. They need some seasoning, maybe the seasoning they put on their twister fries?

Go to Sierra Gold if you're in the area. Specials in the morning for breakfast, 1/2 off food and drinks at night too after 12:00AM, oh, and a happy hour in the middle of the day as well. That makes the draft domestic beer 25 ounce large glasses $2.25. Yeah. Worth it on all accounts, and hey, it is pristinely clean and TV'S IN THE MIRRORS IN THE BATHROOM. Hey, it's all about the small things my friends.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,1,0,4,z_ql2QSO1MjPoSXXSEZ73w

As I was on my lunch so I didn't have a lot of time, so I thought to myself I'd just order a small side of chicken tenders......but when I ""inconvenienced"" this waitress by asking for a small order she said that the smallest she could do was the lunch portion, which I didn't want to pay another 10 for.

The first thing you will notice about Sierra Gold is that the place is huge. There is a massive bar along with several dining tables and high tops to accommodate a party of any size. Plenty of TVs around the walls and even in the bathroom mirrors make it a great place to catch the game. 

SG gets extra points for the fact that you can reserve out a little spot for a small party all to yourselves. I came in with a group of around 25 people and it was great to have our own area sectioned off with appetizers and assigned servers.

They run specials on the food, usually super early in the morning at 6 am. The food however, tastes a little under par; I've always really liked the variety of wings they have but most of the other menu items for some reason don't quite carry the flavor of other establishments. If I was going to primarily eat food, then I'd rather choose other establishments around town.

The most recent visit was on this past Friday, during Happy Hour (which is always the happiest hour of a Friday!). I was happy to find out happy hour does not end until 7 pm at Sierra Gold (some places end too early!). To my understanding, in order to receive the half-priced drinks & appetizers, you must be a ""Beers & Bites"" card holder (which is free to enroll and provides other positive benefits too!). We ordered two rounds of drinks, one of which included their ""Prickly Pear"" beverage; the ingredients listed all sounded good enough to quench our thirst, but the end result was a little too ""thick"" for our liking and while the mixture was good, the consistency did not quench anything. We also ordered their popcorn chicken with twister fries (which are always fun!) and a thin pizza (which I believe was the only half-priced appetizer offered). So in conclusion (1) I believe they need to revisit their ""Prickly Pear"" recipe, and (2) they need to consider adding more half-priced appetizers to their happy hour menu, oh and (3) is it necessary to charge $0.50 for an extra sauce (for the popcorn chicken?).

5) my television EXPLODED (meaning it truly caught on fire) when the Duke-Texas game in march madness was about to start, so after cooling it off, I went to Sierra Gold to watch the game and the bartender asked, ""Are you that weird girl who studied during the superbowl last month?""

The menu is good - I like the wraps, the parmesan risotto side dish, the ahi tuna sandwich, and the shrimp/calamari appetizer, but there are lots of choices.  The pear salad is pretty good except the pears are canned ...but service is generally good and it is very cozy to watch games, and not too smoky.  Open 24 hrs and happy hour is half off pizzas, I think 9pm-12am.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,6,2,5,u25y1EweOph3lSVbvgDtJw
4674184,2018-05-28,0,84DjKzaR26vphu9fNI9nKg,Services and food the first time was amazing! But sadly my husband and I came back a second time and it was Horrible. I will never go spent my money here again! Took 20 minutes after I requested to get my check and it was wrong. To start our visit here we waited 10 minutes just to order our breakfast and drinks. When we asked why the check was incorrect the bartender proceeded to get an attitude with me and my husband. I will never be back to this Sierra Gold again.,G-hpu3xfA__rOJJ_FWawHw,0,0,1,BWO8WFBEDl8Lf8nMBlIqqw

That's a sign usually, but I can only imagine that there aren't more people because its smack in the middle of the day.  Maybe I'll venture here for dinner some night soon, if I can tear myself away from Hot Rods down the street.

I can't really complain about my visits, as the food has always been good and the servers are friendly.  The menu is very extensive, so take a minute to read it through.  I recommend the chicken parmesan sandwich or the chicken salad sandwich - both of which are very good.  The sliders aren't bad either and the chicken rice soup they offer is tasty.

I like the fact the place centers around the bar and has plenty of TVs to watch while you eat.  Makes getting away from the office for lunch that much more appealing.

But don't show up here with $10 and expect to eat though...my last lunch of soup, sandwich and soda was $20 with tip.  UGH.",hiakjDddWXWh5BCDv9I4ZA,1,1,4,zLb8lbC3NflSSYF3-Y6jTw

Seriously the last time I came in here I met up with my bf who went right after work. I was ignored ... not for 10, not 15, hell not even 20 but for 30 freakin minutes. My guess was b/c I dont have a pair ... well the pair the waitresses are looking for to get big ""tips"" from. 
The sadest part, the manager looked me in the eye, 2x. and never even asked what I'd like to order. you can find the manager but finding the oldest lady there who happens to be the most clothed (she's the one not wearing the vest and shiny beaded belt but rather a buttoned down khaki shirt and slacks. 
I told my bf who loves this place, to count me out - he now sees it the light and started going bk to Rum Runner and Apache Joe's.

Tonight we visited this place to finish off the birthday extranvaganza.  Our server was Rachel.  She was super sweet and made our experience tonight, a good one!  It was awesome that she had our best interest in mind.  For instance, I ordered a vodka soda with a lime.  She said that for $0.50 more, you can get Belvedere vodka instead of the well brand.  

We also got the italian sausage pizza for $16.99 (half off after midnight).  There was a lot sausage on the pizza, and the crust was thin and crunchy.  Always a fan.  Topped with ranch and I've got a great meal.  

To end my birthday extranvaganza, Rachel bought our whole table Washington Apple shots.  Every place I've been this weekend has given me a nice birthday surprise, and Sierra Gold was no different.  Thanks for a wonderful end to my birthday extranvaganza!!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,1,4,an7wQCQ6jV9gRoTctqW4Zw

The interior is well lit for a bar - not too dark; not too bright. The service was excellent considering there were a ton of people there celebrating my friend's birthday. The drinks were accurately mixed, and the bar food is better than most. There's tons of seating. Huge downside: super smokey, but I guess I should expect it. I may also be putting it on more of a pedestal than I should since it was my first night out alone since having a baby, LOL.

My review is based off a few visits and all have been negative. 2 stars for the food, which was ok, but the service SUCKS! I've sat at the bar with my fiance on a date night and we were ignored by the female bartender to the point where another bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ask if we would like another round. It was so ridiculous! The bar wasn't even busy and this bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ignore us and stay at the other end if the bar. We each had 2 drinks and decided that the crappy service wasn't worth our business and left! We won't be back!

If you are a bartender that works at Sierra Gold and wonder why you have ever gotten a bad tip: it's because you gave horrible service! Acknowledge all your customers - it's your job to represent Sierra Gold and make sure people feel welcome. If you are not smart enough to figure out that this is how you make money in tips and don't care then just quit because you are hurting the business that you work for!",hNjqSzCeqIVdOeVCvJ7gJA,2,0,2,J8ttP72fyyMyKz3DEampXQ

Most locals think it's far, but actually not a bad drive at all.  The customer service was great.  We sat at the bar and played some games.  Our money got stuck and the bar tender quickly called a repair guy who came and opened the machine and gave us our money and we continued playing.   Now on to the food.... can I say sooooooo delicious! The portions were big well at least to me so I didn't finish it all and I was sharing with my husband.  The drinks were made to perfection and the other locals at the bar were very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday and they bought him a Yeager and redbull.  He is not a big drinker, but he enjoyed the drink. All around 5 stars for customer service, location, and the other customers.  We went on my husband's birthday which was Feb. 22 and I must say we will be returning.
