24 hrs starbucks inside which is awesome. (free wifi?)
internet charge is expensive... $13+ each day depending on how much you use
The food wasnt great & it was pricey. 
the room was fine beds are great & comfy, but had stains all over the carpet.
the spa was nice i got a massage & a pedicure. The massage the lady was nice, but her touch was too gentle for me. (free drinks & snacks)
the pool is small, but usually there isn't a lot of ppl so its nice to take a dip & tan.

My brother, nephew and his wife called their hotels to do the same and they had to wait til late afternoon to check in.  So i asked westin if it would be a problem if they waited and rested in my room and again no problem.  They are so accommodating, they even asked if i wanted extra room Keyes for them and told me that parking if free for them as well.  The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable.  Soft towels and a beautiful view of the High Roller from the Linq. When they saw my room everyone wanted to move to my hotel also because of the location.  Walk across the street to Ballys and you can go on the monorail to any part of the strip, no need to uber or lyft.  Also while everywhere was super crowded the Westin was quiet and peaceful.  Ask my friends and family ended up at the Westin towards the end of the night to gamble as well a it wasn't over crowd and rowdy.  They also give you $5 slot play or $10 for the tables when you sign up for their play card. No complaints here.

Not only did they allow us to check in early but they also let us stay late. The service was spectacular. Their small casino had all the essentials like blackjack, craps and of course, wheel of fortune. The tables were all $5 and $10 tables even on a Saturday night. The lounge was quick and the servers were friendly. The cocktail waitresses were quick to refill drinks while gambling. The room was comfortable and clean but I could hear the neighbors moving around. The restaurant, Suede, has a buffet breakfast that was great. There was even a 24 hour Starbucks in the lobby.

of course they had to ""talk"" to their employee
other CONS:
several times we left the room late and the room was not cleaned or linens changed and they left the door hanger on there saying we chose to skip it... 
um duh why would i do that. i'm not there to do your job. 
the hotel itself is way far from the strip... you can walk a distance in the back to get to MGM, the pool is small...
when they had a happy hour for free, there were a lot of families with their kids running around (how is this happy hour for adults?)
or nasty guys just piling on the plate (i didn't know that the hotel is serving a free buffet) and leaving nothing for others.... 
seriously lame people
the people who work there need to shape up or ship out... i don't work in this industry and i already know why there aren't custormers at the bar or at the pool to order.  they would be great working at funeral homes with their lack of smile, greeting andpersonality",Ysgtu1olgNPFLXYS0yl9hg,1,0,2,HofHnWjdi1FCEoUxRlihTA

I used to love it because compared to the rubbish hotels in Vegas, this was a bit of an escape. Sanity. Calm. No big casino. No clubs etc. I love all that...but not in the hotel. The walk to the strip was short and you know, the beds were fantastic.

Now though, it's just completely been eclipsed. The Wynn, Cosmopolitan and all the other newer hotels just dazzle and shine and the poor old Westin is, as someone else said, like putting lipstick on a pig. 

The areas around it remain sketchy and undeveloped, the views are RUBBISH, the spa isn't great, the service is just ok, the TV (per the pics) is from the 80's I think... I come away thinking that I'm in the cheap seats and that's unfortunately not the truth either... at $180 + a stupid resort fee, it's a bit of a con.

Both of us work in the industry of hospitality and  nightlife and was very pleased with how well we were taken care of here. Not a bad walk to the strip by any means. Depending on which end of the strip we were heading we either cut through Ballys or the Flamingo to avoid the heat. The room is spacious with a huge King size Heavenly bed. There is even a small casino in the lobby with one craps table that has $3 Craps and Black Jack between 6-8pm daily. We had a margarita pizza to-go late night from their restaurant 'Suede'.

Other than the constant whining about the ""service charge"" , the main complaints here is the EXACT REASON why the Causarina is so great. 

You're right, IT'S NOT ON THE STRIP, it's about half a block south. So you don't have to deal with traffic, 200 people waits for the valet or taxi, and hordes of sunburned rednecks in tank tops and shorts carrying around tub sized margaritas.  You can actually park your own car in a structure that isn't half a mile away.  And yet the strip is RIGHT there if you desire to see it, a 5 minute walk . 

the casino is small, quiet , and manageable. You can play if you want, or walk through the uncrowded place to your room in about 30 seconds.

And yes, the pool is small - see the earlier posts about rednecks, and with the pool, include 'roided guidos and silicone pumped bimbos as the other Vegas nightmares you won't be seeing at the tiny , relaxing, manageable pool. 

And after a night on the town, you can come back to your quiet, comfortable Westin Bed. 

If you are looking for a crap ""theme"", a mile long walk to your hotel room, and hordes of Vegas jagoffs, don't stay here.",lwtBBD2VKoXfbKmVQK2Q_Q,2,1,4,xiGu2qHz2dMiDOosFIdAGw

This time he discovers that he's left a critical part off the air co causing the air not to flow. Then it works wonderfully. Other issues...floor not swept or vaccuumed any day we were there.

The next day the hotel kindly agreed to move us, but tried to move us to a room with a bathroom so smelly I thought there must be a problem with the drains on that floor.

Finally we got into a proper room, and the films are nearly fourteen dollars! Needless to say we didn't bother.

It being Las Vegas, pretty much everything was booked up. Luckily I came across The Westin Las Vegas Hotel, Casino + Spa which had enough rooms for me and 3 other work partners in addition to having a conference room available to my business needs all at a reasonable price.

The hotel is way more mellow than being in the thick of the true ""essence"" of Sin City, which for my personality was perfect. Yet, it is still super close to the strip and all the other main attractions. Check in was easy + they had enough people checking in guests pending on the line size of arrivals. Honestly, it's been a long while since I've experience such great customer service from every single staff member at a location, let alone hotel...in Las Vegas. 

Big THANK YOU to Renee, the Convention Services Manager, who handles the booking of the conference rooms was absolutely AMAZING. She was quick to respond and with kindness, understanding, and proper level of professionalism.

Also, Big THANK YOU to Albert A., who was a great help when the printer ink in the lobby (which has 2 computers for guest use with free WiFi), and kindly printed me 4 copies of a document I needed asap. In addition to outstanding customer service, he was simply put a nice person who appreciated the guests and their needs.

Many thanks to ALL the staff, which are many more of whom I wish to recognize for doing a great job, and as a producer, made my life much easier and stress free.

Biggest problem - very misleading pricing with hidden fees. The worst part is that they will deliberately try to deceive you. I was sent a confirmation that said, word for word, ""Estimated total: $196.24....USD 190.00 deposit is due on Wed, Feb 8, 2017 and will be charged to the credit card provided.""

When I was getting ready to check out that day I noticed my wallet and all my cash was gone from the same dresser that maid was standing over. Reported to the front desk who notified security and filled out a report. 

Security shift supervisor Terry was a really good guy. Investigated the swipe history of the door lock as well as housekeeping staff for that night. The 2 maids on staff that shift did not match the description of the woman that was in our room at 6:30AM. Turns out the door wasn't working properly and didn't close all the way. The woman didn't work for the Westin and he confirmed that we had been robbed. 

Here is the suspicious part. The woman had the same uniform as the other housekeepers which my Fiancée got a good look at and gave a perfect description of the woman (They refused to review video surveilence). Second, our room was on the 12th floor toward the end of the hallway. She knew exactly where to go. If she wasn't a current employee she most certainly knew our door didn't work properly so she worked there before or a current employee was in on it. 

I got a call from the director of security and an email from the GM threatening to sue me for this review saying there was nothing wrong with thier door and saying I ""Declared war against the property by posting this review before giving them a chance to investigate (I gave them a week with no call)'. They have opted to deny any responsibilibilty or the fact they have a security issue, instead victimizing me further and questioning the validity of the incident saying that there was no proof it happened other than mine and my fiancee's statements. So unprofessional.",EWLG0SEChLXALX6W2zgFaA,29,0,1,cdDQgmcOLwE01fzdr5qYcw

I contacted management, filled out a report, and they relocated me to another room.  Management said they had a third party inspection team on the way to the hotel to investigate.  I went to urgent care where the diagnosis was, ""lesions induced by bed bug bites"".  I returned to my original room to grab my phone charger and the room had been completely vacuumed and cleaned with beds made up.  I called management to learn the result of the inspection and they said the team had not arrived - so they had cleaned the room and all the evidence prior to inspection!

The desk agent was completely unsmiley, barely knocked through the standard info usually given about the hotel upon check-in. I had to go back later to get a new room key. The rest of the agents were chipper, but not all in your face fakey. 

A LOT of airline employees there - they had an airline check-in desk and there was constantly airline uniforms walking the halls and elevators. 

The gaming area was mostly an afterthought. Mostly just  there to say ""Hey, look! We have a casino, too."" Suede, their restaurant, and the Starbucks was tucked behind the casino area of the lobby - which was NOT non-smoking, btw. 

The room was a standard Westin room. Nothing ultra-fancy, nothing worn out. The White Tea toiletries and the dual showerhead, nice linens on the bed, hair dryer, coffee, iron and board in the room. We had a slow drain in the tub, called and someone was up promptly to snake the drain. An extra bathrobe? Right away. Two more towels and a washcloth, and some extra lotion for the dry desert air? Knocking at the door in minutes. 

The pool is lackluster - basically a concrete pit on the roof of Starbucks. Disappointed that people could smoke there, but it IS outside, and it IS Vegas, so could I complain? Not really. The pool has a little bar in the back right near the bathrooms, but I was there a while before I even noticed it. 

The spa... was surprisingly great. Guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nice subdued, large, inviting, and thorough facilities and amenities. Polished and genuinely pleasant service (I am so sick of bourgeois girls thinking they're fancy because they work at a spa). Locker & key, slippers & robe, steam room, sauna, nice large showers. It was so great - I'm so glad I decided to splurge and book myself a treatment. I called to schedule before I checked in. They gave me the ""early bird"" discount; 20% off my service

The location is about 5-10 min walk off the strip. Really, not a big deal since once you're on the strip you're walking so much anyway. There's always cabs out front too, just in case it's too hot or you're too lazy. The only real drawback of the location is walking past a sketchy empty lot, a seedy looking bar (WELCOME CONSTRUCTION WORKERS $2 JAG SHOTS) and hollowed out shell of a now-closed casino undergoing renovation. Gives the area an unsavory feel. I found it easier to cut through Bally's and head out their side entrance before crossing over to the Westin side, since it felt safer.

The biggest Pros of this hotel were definetly the beds and the shower.  OMG, sinking into that nice, HEAVENLY bed, after a night out...the best ever!  The shower with the double showerheads...very nice.  Location, I thought, is also good, although it's off the strip.  But the places I was interested in going were all really close, and especially if you're planning on driving around, you can drive around the back of the strip and cut your travel time down by at least half! sitting on the strip during traffic times...not so fun.  So the location worked out well for me.  I LOVED their line of shower soaps and lotions that the Westin uses...a green tea line (im sure they call it something that's a little more catchy tho haha) and it's my favorite of all the hotel soaps and shampoos i've experienced yet.

As for the cons.  First off, the room was pretty tiny...and checking in, we didnt get a very nice receptionist lady.  Maybe it's because we dont look like we're old enough to be respectable? Iono.  Also, while, i liked that the lobby was really small, and you didnt have to walk a mile through a casino to get to the elevators as other hotels might make you do...this place is packed with a lot more business-y and professional people, and if you're walking around in your 'vegas-only' attire...you get a lotta weird stares and creepers.  *shudder*  The pool was just alright too...SUPER tiny...good thing we werent in the mood to hang out by the pool, cuz i dont think we would've fit!!  Other than that, my only other complaint is the seemingly lack of service they provide...most hotels i know will provide you with toiletries if you happen to forget them...and it's not like i was asking for a suitcase full! All i wanted was a simple toiletry item, but they had us go to to the gift shop to buy it at like a 500% markup.

524509,2015-07-21,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I recently planned a trip to stay at this hotel in July and made my reservation some time in June for two adjoining rooms.  I just wanted to relay my disappointment with the Westin hotel location at 160 E. Flamingo in Las Vegas, NV. 

  I came to check-in on Friday, July 17, 2015 at 5pm to find out that the hotel had no rooms available due to some event and ""technical issues."" My group got sent to stay at the Rio for one complimentary night only and were  told to come back to the Westin hotel the following day to check-in on Saturday.  If we decided to not check-in the next day at the Westin, we would have to make our own accommodations and forfeit what we already paid.

  I was not even given a courtesy call regarding the ""fully committed"" hotel with no rooms available in order to come in earlier to pick up my voucher and check-in at another hotel.  I would have been fine with a courtesy call so my group would have made the proper arrangements since we had a show at 7pm and we would not have any other problems.  We ended up being late to our show because we drove to the Rio Hotel to finish checking in.

 The following morning, I called the Westin hotel at 9:30 am regarding my situation and was told I would have my reservation of two rooms with 2 queen beds ready in two hours.  I went to check-in at 11:45 am and was told that I had two options: check-in with the only rooms available at the time that were adjacent to each other was on the 14th floor with king beds in each room or check-in to one room and wait until the next available room with a double bed became available but we were not guaranteed to be near each other.  We decided to check-in with the two rooms with the king beds because it was the only choice that would not waste any more of our vacation time just to check-in to our room.  The hotel waived our resort fees and had roll-away beds sent to our rooms because we originally booked a double bed.

  I met other parties with the same reservation dilemma of not getting their room on Friday which they also reserved a head of time.  Many parties said their resort fees waived, were given taxi fares, and meal vouchers.  However, my group was not compensated like other groups. When we tried to speak with the front desk clerk named Albert regarding drink vouchers since others were given meal vouchers for the inconveniences we incurred, we were met with nothing but an argumentative clerk who lacked customer service skills.  He had the audacity to tell us that we wanted the king beds and that my group already had the resort fees, roll-away bed fees, and upgraded room fees waived.   We did not ask to have our rooms upgraded, they were the only rooms available that was offered to my group that was close to our reservation.  Our original reservation was for two beds in each room and Westin was trying to charge us roll-away bed fees.  Albert stated he spoke with his ""higher up managers"" and we were basically told that we have been compensated fairly and that we were ""abusing the system.""

 Upon checkout, Westin tried to charge me one room's resort fee when I was promised I was not going to be charged.  I had to tell the clerk three times that my fees have been waived.

I am truly disappointed with the services received at the Westin due to the lack of customer service regarding customer courtesy, interaction, and satisfaction.  Westin did not offer the same compensations like taxi and meal vouchers to our group. I regret saying that this establishment lacks customer service especially when speaking with front desk clerks like Albert.",sS6HBGIusaN1xda6j-DOjw,3,1,1,7dJQilT-NachFqwEeAMirw

My boyfriend and I are not super big partiers but figured an affordable vacation to Vegas to see some shows and have fun was in order. We got to the hotel and it wasn't too far off of the strip which was great. Our room was decent. But we had the strangest thing happen, and were not happy with how it was handled. We picked up some things to drink on the way to the hotel. There's a key to lock your fridge, which we had a bottle of vodka in and some beers and we didn't lock it. We came back to the room on our second day there, after only having two or three drinks out of the bottle, we opened up the fridge to find that it was almost empty. This was after our room had been cleaned. It wasn't like this was expensive alcohol but we decided to let the front desk know. You would think they would want to know if someone that works for them may be drinking on the job or taking anything in general. After we let them know the next time we opened the fridge on the next day (also after housekeeping had come) we noticed the vodka all of a sudden had doubled. We let them know it had been tampered with again and then they sent up a security person to our room. Now, I can understand that 99.9% of the time people probably drink it and forget and complain because it's Vegas...and that happens. But that was not the case, I was that .1%. The response we got from the security guy is that we had drank the alcohol and we just forgot, and he said that multiple times. I did NOT appreciate that. It may be silly but that's telling me I'm a liar. We were not asking for anything free, and I am still un-amused by that response. They offered us a free breakfast after we first had mentioned it to them which was lovely...until we got back later in the day and they had messed with it again.  Had we even the littlest doubt that we may have drank it we would not have been complaining. Maybe you have a housekeeper that likes to drink on the job...ever think about that? Won't be back.

I'm sure they add this so that it looks like the Westin is a cheaper place to stay, so make sure you add this into consideration of the listed daily rate when you check @ Priceline, or other online search engines. I picked it because it appeared to be more reasonably priced for it's location. After the add on service fee, the price was pretty much the same as hotels closer to the strip.

The price for this extra fee isn't anywhere until you checkout. It was mentioned on my booking info, but no actual price or mention of it at check in. It should have been explained then, as apparently there is also a free happy hour, but no one at check in bothered to mention that either, nor did I find that info anywhere in the room. 

This is pretty funny, the first night we stayed the hot water wasn't working in our room, neither the shower or the faucet. When I called down to ask about it, I kid you not the person who answered literally said it was the first time he had ever heard someone complain about the lack of hot water. I can only assume it was his first day on the job, as he then suggested having an engineer come to the room to see what was the issue (maybe he thought we didn't know which way to turn the faucet??). 

Other than that, the room was ok, nothing special, no view except for the parking lot across the road. 

It's off the strip, so you should also know there may be a wait to get a taxi anywhere.

If I could give zero, or negative stars, I would. At this hotel you are treated like a nuisance from check-in to check-out.

Let me back up and say I'm an SPG loyal and I've really enjoyed staying at Westin's and other SPG properties business and personal travel. This hotel, and particularly the front desk and the ""service express"" employees, are a stain on the SPG and Westin brands. Never again. SPG should be ashamed of itself. 

As a business traveler there are two things I rely heavily on when I travel,: a decent internet connection (so I can work), and a decent night's sleep (so I can work). This Westin is suitable for neither, and the experience I had with their ""service express"" line is the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Rude, patronizing, impatient and entirely uninterested and unwilling to help. It would be an amazing case study, a la the Comcast debacle, if it wasn't so infuriating and shocking (given it's SPG which typically goes above and beyond). 

A word about the ""free"" internet. It doesn't work at all. Good luck getting connected, and if you do, good luck not getting kicked-off the server. Connecting on any device (laptop, phone, tablet) requires a phone call to service express to get connected to an outsourced tech support service. This happened EVERY SINGLE TIME, and is 10-15 minute process. Should successfully navigate that process you'll find the connection laughably slow and you'll likely loose connectivity sooner rather than later. I've never had this problem before and it completely shut down my ability to work. A co-worker and I attempted to meet in the restaurant and our inability to connect via the lobby or guestroom networks was embarrassing and completely ruined our productivity. There is no option to pay for a higher-speed connection. 

Other cons: The walls are thin and non-biz travelers are loud; nothing to be done here except put in earplugs and pray you hear the alarm. Everything feels used and abused; I've never seen a Westin with such frayed towels, worn carpet and title, chipped furniture, doors and walls. The lobby, bar, restaurant, Starbucks all reek of second-hand smoke due to the casino that swallows everything. Not an aroma I appreciate first thing in the morning, while I'm dining, or anytime really. 

Pros: The service in the restaurant is great. Perhaps the only positive of staying at this property, and not enough to make me return.",ae_x3FlM9fivR4HeFTWrJQ,2,1,1,9gKN2yEdWWX-lsZJ46hd9g

The placed appeared to be small (at least the first floor appeared to be) but we did spot a few tables (about a half dozen?) and decided to go back later. This casino inside Westin, (Max Casino, is incredibly small but got crowded as the time went by. We initially were just watching. But minutes later, we shockingly heard an employee (wearing Max Casino's uniform), a male in his 40s, literally was just ""trash talking"" super loud with his friends from somewhere in the streets, about his past jail time and how he went about in his time both past and present. This is only about a few feet away from the table It's way too disgusting and alarming let alone unprofessional. That said, he really did look like a criminal and acted like he just got fired and didn't care a thing. We have been to many casinos & hotels and seen many players, dealer and pit bosses but have never heard nor witnessed a criminal-minded individual such as this. Not matter how good of a hotel you are, if you can't separate yourself from such a bad rep then it's always going to scary customers/players away.",39E_O_pLjkJdsDB2B0VXaw,1,0,1,-Lyk6QU5MXNNOqnRBbNRzg

Otherwise we were looking to spend $200+/night along The Strip. Yes this place is off The Strip but it was a welcome respite from the craziness of Vegas. 

You would figure this place needs to accomodate travelers look for the Vegas experience which this hotel does not cater to. The casino is small and my friends wanted to play craps which they do not open up until 5 PM. Most of the tables were closed because there are literally no people around. I think I saw more people sitting in the hotel Starbucks than on the casino floor. 

A really quick story about my check-in experience, after grabbing the card key and trying to figure out which way the key goes in. I soon realize the key does not work but I figure maybe it's the end user so I ask the floor maid to show me how to open the door. Luckily I took Spanish in high school otherwise there would have been a communication gap. She told me the key I had was likely broken and we literally together spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. I think it had to do with the door lock. 

I get a new room and joke that it better work this time around, throwing the idea that I would really like a suite did not seem to amuse the front desk receptionist. However, I did ask them if I could get a room with a view of The Strip. This view turned out to be of the small hotel pool where it was predominately senior individuals enjoying a splash in the pool or hottub, 

The room was relatively clean except the comforter for one of the beds had stains on them. I always take off the comforter and never sleep or lie on them anyway but I expected better.     

Be prepared to either take a taxi to get around The Strip or you can walk in the hot mid-day sun running over to Bally's for the air-conditioning. Stay at your risk but spend a little more and find someplace along The Strip.

634703,2012-11-27,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I stayed here when in Vegas for work. When I told people the hotel's location, they all were like ZOMG IF YOU DON'T STAY DIRECTLY ON THE STRIP EVERYTHING WILL BE SO HORRIBLE AND BAD.

Not true. First, the location is great: such a short walk to the Strip that you are, essentially, staying on the Strip. I also really appreciated staying in a smaller, more intimate hotel. No long lines to check it or long waits for room service. Best of all, zero wait for a taxi, even in the evening!

The hotel and its rooms are a bit older and worn out, but the things that count--the beds, the bathroom amenities, cleanliness the service--are all up to Starwood standards. 

One weird thing: when I checked in late at night, I was put in a room above some sort of heater that was rattling so much that the entire room was vibrating. The bed was shaking, the water glasses were clinking--it was intolerable. I called the front desk and before I could even finish a sentence, they asked, ""Do you want a new room?"" Two minutes later a valet was at the door with a new key, and the new room was fine. So, clearly a terrifying VIBRATING ROOM (insert Vegas joke here) is a big problem, but they fixed it instantly, at least. 

Other pluses:
Starbucks in the lobby was convenient. The concierge was helpful in recommending and getting us tickets to a good show. They let me move my check-out time to 2pm. Room service breakfast was yummy.

Other minuses:
I regretting ordering what turned out to be a $15 cocktail at the bar, but I should have expected that. The lobby gambling felt a bit out of place (it otherwise is like a regular business hotel), and I think people were smoking--but, eh, Vegas. 

Don't take someone here for a swanky bachelor party or your wedding night, but do stay here if you want a quiet, convenient, clean place to sleep with excellent guest services. I'd stay here again, definitely!",ehsI3WVrh1CJvkspoyg8cA,3,0,3,4mQAB_uSYy-ROrGbKiVwsw

I have a police report and fraud reports from my bank from the attempted purchases on my credit card.  Do not stay in this dumpster.

Even if I didn't get violated, I would have never stayed here again.  Besides the hidden fees for things such as ""complimentary water"", they don't clean anything up!  Pizza boxes from Friday night left in the lobbies until Sunday evening.  What a dump for $120/night.

650132,2010-10-29,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I booked this hotel through priceline's name-your-price service, having requested a 4-star hotel near the strip. I would definitely not rate this hotel as 4-star, but it's still a more-than-decent hotel for the price. It's only two blocks from the Strip, and Bally's is literally right across the street, where you can find some decent informal restaurants, or you can walk through to Paris for some nicer dining choices. If you're heading for the Strip, you do have to walk by a vacant lot populated by several homeless people, and it looks a little shady at night.

The room itself was clean, but dated. Most Westins I've been in have switched over to flat screen TVs in their rooms, but ours still had a big ol' tube TV sitting on the dresser. It was surprising how outdated that one detail made the room feel. 

I'm happy to report that the Westin Heavenly Bed, Heavenly Towels, and dual shower heads were all present, so my sleeping and showering experiences were more than adequate, and that's really what you're looking for in an inexpensive room off-strip, right? If you're in Vegas you should really just be using the room for showering, sleeping, and sleep-related activities.

The casino area of the hotel is relatively small, and during the Saturday afternoon while we were waiting for our room to be ready, only the slots and two blackjack tables were in operation. But if you're looking to kill some time with some $5 blackjack, I suppose that's okay. All the table games were in full swing by the evening.

There's a sign in front of this hotel that says something like ""Western Action 24-7,"" which I guess is the theme they're going for, but it's sort of a half-assed theme in that their staff was dressed in cowboy attire, but that's about as far as the Western Action went. Nothing else about the hotel was particularly ""Western,"" not that I'm complaining, but if you're going to create a sign about your Western activities, it should be more than making your people dress up like cowboys.

Check-in time is listed as 4pm, but we were not able to get into our room until 4:30. This after first attempting to check in around noon, and then being told to come back in an hour, every hour, until we finally got our keys, which was kind of annoying.

I do have to complain about the bill I received for the ""resort fee"" especially since the pool was drained and unavailable the entire time were were there, but overall this was a comfortable hotel near the strip. A little less nice than other Westins I've stayed in, but still a decent place to act as your base of operations while in Vegas.",hADRA9LnPBdwbrYP_pWpVA,0,0,3,hMbrkVue8qn8by2NTiWXog

Didn't think too much of it.
I was sooooooooooo wrong.
I didn't know what was next to the wall.  I came to find out after midnight.  It was either some construction site, or delivery place.
From 12AM to 5AM, I kept hearing trucks backing into that building (beep beep beep), and then loud sound made by metals banging on ground or something.  Like either metal construction material being dropped, or containers being delivered.  I wasn't able to sleep both nights I was there.
It was pure hell.
I made a complaint the second night (first night... i thought it was a fluke... and honestly, second night was WAAAAAAY worse).  All they offered was to reverse one of the amenities charges.  They actually blamed me for not telling them the first night.
I was like, are you *$&%^& kidding me?  I don't believe anyone would have to pay to stay there and you have the audacity to tell me that it's my fault for giving you the benefit of a doubt after the first night?

I confirmed with the reception on what was included in the bill because a lot of the review I read on yelp stated there were a lot of hidden traps. I noticed there were a lot of information that had been varied according to the source you get the information from. 

For example: 

1) Swimming pool was stated to be under construction on the website. I didn't pack my swimming suit thus and I found out it was otherwise! People were still able to hang out by the pool!! Aside from the pool not very appealing. 

2) From the hibiscus Spa site, they stated that hotel guests need to pay to use locker room. The charge is $25. I was confused about that because I thought the resort charge Westin mandatory charged already included the usage? I was told by reception the usage is free. 

3) WORST OF ALL... We were so thirsty when we went back to the hotel at night. Sister and I saw two bottles of water on the counter next to the tv. I was lying down to test the Westin comfort bed while my sister opened one of the water bottle... I went to the bathroom and found there were two bottles of water. Just that they were not as fancy as the ones lying outside. I though Westin must be really nice and gave us two extra bottles. Then something came to my mind and I rushed outside to check on the water bottles... (check my pic) It was then I realized it was yet another trap!! It cost my sister $8 for a bottle of water that comes from Italy and hopefully a lesson she would remember for a long time. 

Compare to 10 years ago, the interior of the hotel improved a lot: no more strong statics on hotel lobby door knobs, more appealing lobby area. The bed was also very comfortable and breakfast buffet was excellent. The air conditioning in my room has no problem. However, the walls were still thin, the room corridors were also very dirty. I dislike the bath tub because the one in my room has a lot of scratches at the bottom. I probably would not choose to stay here again. If you would like the stay here, you can buy drink and snacks from the gas station store which is next to the hotel.",nLuNaKK2mXrqBM2M9ikXMg,0,0,3,_26OmZ7O3WMiWkD4tLgBBQ

Booked the Westin with Expedia & I had a GREAT experience here.

It's close enough to the hot spots of Vegas & it actually has a casino, pool, spa, & restaurant. 

 If you're going to go to Vegas to sit in your hotel room all day, spend a little more $ & stay somewhere else.

We received zero apology and it was clear the staff we spoke to had no real idea why this had happened.  

The couple who came with us settled their $600+ bill at the desk upon checkout and then had two random large amounts taken from their account also.  They received the same lack lustre, no idea explanation as us.  

I am aware some hotels 'hold' a certain amount but the hotel staff did not seem to think this was the case as the amounts taken were random and far, far above what they potentially could have held and could not explain why this had happened.  They didn't seem remotely surprised.  

Luckily both our parties had enough money to deal with being out of pocket for nearly a week.  Us, around $2000 - more than double the hotel bill we had already paid.  

I sincerely doubt we are the only people this happened to.  Personally I think this is quite a lucrative scam on the hotels part - the interest they must earn holding large amounts of hundreds of guests money in their own accounts 'by mistake' for days at a time must be pretty decent...

Like the others have said, yet for some reason I ignored, this place is a scam.

Here is the scam - Priceline catagorizes this hotel as 4 stars. For comparison, Luxor is 3 1/2. 

I placed a bid for a 4 star hotel for $90 a night on weekends. Thought how could I go wrong? Priceline gave us The Westin as our winning bid. We got there and although the hotel ""rate"" was $90, they added all these fees, such as $15 per night ""recreation fee"" and $1.50 ""Visa Fee"", etc.

Good god!!!!! Apparently all a hotel has to do to scam priceline is to list a low rate and then they will be lower than other hotels. Then just add all these ""fees"" and that bumps up their revenue. Scam!!!!

As for the hotel - it sucks. My sister did not have hot water and upon checkin we had a very rude guy. Plus about 3-4 normal city blocks away from strip (not one - don't be fooled) and you have to walk past garbage to get to the action.

Horrible!

Platnium Dunes right across streets, that place had only a partial staff when I was there but not all the hidden charges.

About the Westin:  The beds are very comfortable.  There was a little bit of pet friendly dust in the room which aggravated my girlfriend's allergies but didn't bother me.  The Westin charges more for incidentals than other hotels do.  (internet access is $18.95)

A lot of reviewers complain about the $15 ""resort fee"".  This is a mandatory fee that all Las Vegas hotels charge by law.  Priceline rudely buries this in the fine print but that is not the hotel's fault.  The best a hotel can do here is to be honest and up front about it.  Westin was not.  When I asked about the resort fee during check-in the front desk agent insisted that the fee was already included in my quoted price and promised no surprises.  The next morning there was a bill under the door for $15 plus tax.  Not much money of course.  Just enough to be annoying.  Instead of simply dealing with the mistake, the morning manager shoved a copy of the fine print in front of my face and insisted on reminding me that waiving the fee was a ""courtesy"".  No it isn't.  Courtesy is getting it right on check-in, or at least taking care of your mistakes and apologizing without reminding me how courteous you are.

We stayed at Trump the following night where they were courteous and honest about all fees and there were no surprises.  We paid less there for a much better room and the incidentals were reasonable.

1131795,2011-07-22,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"The Westin is a good option if you want to get away from the mega hotels and ringing casinos on the strip. The hotel is about a quarter mile from the strip, so if you have the itch to be in the middle of the Vegas action then it's a short walk away. The other benefit of staying at this location is that you do not have to walk the gauntlet of poker machines, table games and old ladies puffing on their cigarettes to make it to the check in desk. Both of those are great, but what you are paying for is the room. 

The casino is owned by a separate company rather than Westin. Most of the games are slots and electronic poker. There are a handful of table games.  It's a non smoking hotel, but a smoking casino...which makes for a smoking hotel. 

Check in was easy and friendly. The front desk agent was very helpful and informative. A nice start to our stay. Rooms are lacking quite a bit compared to their competition, and our room just smelled like Chinese take out. The double rooms are fairly tight and do not offer much room to move around. The tube TV is out dated, the furniture is stained along with the carpet and wallpaper is peeling.  The bathrooms are average sized and offer all the amenities you would expect from a Westin. However, the water pressure for the shower is miserable, and their Heavenly Shower with a double head on it is pointless. I prefer a shower that works properly before they start attaching the bells and whistles on it. The Heavenly Beds are comfortable and the AC works great. Finally, the housekeeping is a joke. The only service they provide is making the bed. Forget about organizing the room or the bathroom. 

The non resort Westin charges a resort fee for things you never or rarely use...like incoming faxes.  It's like an apartment charging you pet rent.  It makes no sense.  They also state that your $11 daily fee gets you ""free"" water.  I can't quite figure that one out.  

A 24 hour Starbucks is in the lobby, so if you're hitting the slots and on a roll at 4am and need to keep going, you can grab your coffee.  The restaurant is 24 hours as well.

I called again and the lady assured me it must be in my closet (I checked, and of course it wasnt) so she said she'd ""look for it."" 10 minutes later someone from the hotel staff brought up my laundry. However after he walked away I realized the pants I needed and a few other items were still missing. It took another 2 calls to the lobby to finally get it sorted out and my remaining clothes delivered. 

Overall, the stay wasn't horrible, but I just didn't get a ""welcome"" feeling from the staff during my entire stay.

- the hotel is not themed and is more of a business style hotel. this does not make any sense at all because when you are in Vegas, you expect very lavish themes such as Caesars palace, venetian MGM etc.
- this hotel takes away the feeling of being in Vegas because nobody gambles or plays here.
- the gambling area is a joke
- their swimming pool does not even compare with any of the other hotels, and is similar to one that you would expect to find at a cheap motel.
- they charge you something crazy to use their crappy internet connect which is really two dinosaur computers with ancient monitors
- crappy ""Zenith"" branded tvs

Seems nice ... has all of the amenities one wants in a Vegas hotel ... and best of all it's only a block off the strip.

But you're a discerning shopper and do a little more research and you find that the Westin isn't  all that much cheaper than some big name options actually on the Strip. And while pleasant, if you're going to spend the money in Vegas, don't you want the pizzazz that goes with it?

The Westin suffers from being the neither fish nor fowl of the Las Vegas hotels. My company sent me here for a week long convention and it was perfectly pleasant and well run. The single (real) restaurant that the Westin boasts (Savona Bistro) has excellent food at above average prices (note: not off-strip prices). The casino itself is minuscule by Vegas standards but has a homey feel when a table gets roaring.

Would I stay here if I were paying my way through Vegas? Sadly no. I've been to Vegas many times, both on the cheap and spending money like a high roller. If I want to do Vegas the cheap way I go to the Palace Station or similar hotel and if I want to blow my kid's college fund (f the little beggars!) I stay at the Luxor or MGM Grand.

Some reading this might want a happy medium and in that case, the Westin may just fit the bill. Depends what you want out of your Vegas hotel.

If you're going to spend your day in the sun, you can probably do better at the strip casinos who have massive pools. The Westin's was like an oversized bath tub and was dirty with a nice oil slick on top to boot. Its casino was also small and rarely buzzing, but they do keep minimums at the black jack tables low which means you lose your money much slower here. They were also playing really mellow music; it felt like sitting in a coffee house than a casino. 

Finally I must mention the ants in our room. Tiny red ants first spotted in the bathroom then in the carpeting in the room. Basically the longer we stayed in the room the more ant havens we found.

Apparently most of the hotel/rooms were just renovated earlier this year, so all previous reviews that complained of distress or construction, this is now been cleared up!  I am practical and appreciate functionality in the places I stay, but I also like it to feel nice, clean, and some luxurious touches too. This hotel hit on about every note.

We stayed in a ""deluxe/king"" room. $199 for Saturday night (Vegas prices always fluctuate heavily depending on events tho)
 
The furniture was nice, the mattress was comfortable, the bedding was white, fresh, and soft. Everything was clean. The coffee maker had good Starbucks coffee pods (the large ones) with large cups, lids and all the trimmings. The bathroom had everything important, and more. Refrigerator and safe in the room.  Bluetooth docking station for music.

Staff was always friendly. Our reservation clerk took the time to see if early check-in and late checkout were possible for us before blurting out whether they could accommodate or not, and yes-they were able to accommodate in this case. I understand sometimes they can't but caring enough to even look into the matter is appreciated!  

The pool and jacuzzi are 24 hours! Need I say more on that??

There was only one restaurant that services breakfast, lunch, dinner and room service but the food I considered very good and the atmosphere was nice so we didn't mind eating there multiple times. After all it's Vegas... we aren't locked up in our hotel or hurting for other dining options anyway.  

Located just off the strip it is an absolutely perfect option for anyone who does not want to spend $300+ a night but still be close to the strip and have all the conveniences.  Super easy parking too.

Starbucks in the house!

If I had to pick any negatives at all it might be that the Wi-Fi kinda sucked and you could hear some hallway/neighbor noise- but almost all hotels have one or both of those issues so if you're trying to find a room under 200 bucks a night just off the Las Vegas strip that has anything more perfect than this...

The pool area is decent; the pool itself is TINY and the drinks are EXPENSIVE. The gym is okay for a hotel gym. The bed was wonderful, but the walls were thin. 

Overall, I would have given this hotel 3 stars as an A-OK if it weren't for the ridiculous events surrounding our check-in and check-out.

I thought, this has got to be too good to be true, so I clarified: ""So you're saying this $15 fee is included already in our $90 per night charge?"" YES. ""And this includes the parking, breakfast, etc?"" YES.

Come check out, we were charged $15/day as well as $40 for our one stop at the breakfast buffet. We let them know this was an error.

It's great that I don't have to have a constant headache from second hand smoke, as I get sometimes at other hotels.  This hotel is also quieter since it's not a ""party hotel"". Although the hotel has outdoor parking rather than the huge structures that the more popular hotels have, it's hotter to go outside BUT you don't have to walk forever to get to your car.

The odd things about this hotel is that one sign in the lobby says the hotel is smoke-free, but then the bar has ash trays and matches.  SO you can smoke in the bar in the hotel.  I know it is a symptom of being from California, but I don't think that I'm spoiled for asking for clean air.  The odd thing was that when we turned on our cold water for too long in our room's sink (and I'm not talking that long - just long enough to wash your face), the pipes start to make an annoying loud noise. You have to turn the water off, then back on to get rid of the noise.

They do have Wifi here, although on the 16th floor where my room was, it did not work.  It seems like the top floors have some issues with it.  I don't mind it too much, but if my husband was with me, he'd be annoyed since my Verizon service seemed to not function on the 16th floor as well.

+ Room was clean, beds were VERY comfortable, and linens were clean.
+ Maid service was prompt.

- The Suede restaurant is kinda overpriced. The eggs benedict in the buffet were overcooked. Meh. BUT this hotel is a block away from Ellis Island, which is my new favorite cheap eats restaurant EVER. Review coming soon.

The staff from the desks at check-in all through the bar and into the casion were EXTREMELY friendly. Good family atmosphere. 

Some of the down sides, its easily a 5 minute walk to the strip even with long legs and a fast pace. The casio is very small and the tables close by midnight or 1am if it isn't busy. Its pricy if you try to book a room from their website.... and I mean WAY overpriced. I pricelined this room for $75. That was deffinantly a good deal. I would pay up to $84 dollars becasue they charge you and automatic 16 bucks at check in which brings the grand total to about $100.. which is reasonable. 

pros:
great rooms
AMAZING BED
great service

Negatives:
Fairly far from the strip
Overpriced unless you priceline it
not very many people in casino

1658070,2011-05-05,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"The Westin was my first choice hotel for my annual Vegas trip after staying there last year. I found a deal through Southwest for R/T airfare and two nights (Th & F) at the hotel for $300. Pretty awesome!

I checked in 2 hours early with no problem. Last year they offered me a free SPG members card and i brought it with me this trip (gives you some priority when trying to check in early as well as accumulates points for spa and room service usage). The hotel still imposes at $10 hotel tax fee, but again, you're also able to use the pool, gym and spa for free.

The best part about staying here HAS to be it's smoke-free policy. After walking through casinos and foot traffic that constantly has cigarette smoke wafting in my face it's a treat to stay in a place free of it. I've stayed in smoke-free rooms at hotels on the strip but smoke from the smoking rooms and casinos inside is still heavy in the halls.

Room service is still a necessary indulgence i partake in and it's not cheap anywhere you go. The Westin charges several fees for room service and i paid $23 total (tip excluded) for a $15 breakfast. There's so few things in life as blissful as breakfast delivered to me in bed so even though the tab always makes me gasp a little, i never complain. I anticipate it so it's not a surprise.

The hotel now offers an airport check in computer. Free use to check into flights and print boarding passes only is definitely a nicety. They also had a free happy hour mixer thing at the bar around 6 pm. Free beer and wine and munchies!

The only complaint was some noticeable noise in adjoining rooms. I don't think that will ever resolve in ANY hotel, especially in Vegas were people will be up and around every hour of the day.

The Westin is one of the cleaner hotels near the strip. The beds are heavenly. I've never had a problem with kids running in the halls or creepy people lurking in the casino. The walk to the strip is just a block (it's on the backside of the Flamingo). I've seen complaints about the walk to the strip being dicey but there's a ton of foot and vehicular traffic along the way and i felt safe.

I think a lot of people want the hype of staying in a classic Vegas hotel for the novelty. After several years of dealing with cigarette smoke, unruly kids, questionable bedding, dirty carpets, and constant loud noise the Westin is the perfect place for a relaxing and afforable place to stay.",s3cZ383gp7fZR8gb83IcFA,0,0,4,12PpGRYja_LT2O5MS6kg2g

So I booked my room through Hotwire, room should have been paid for. I provided my credit card for incidentals and ended up getting charged an additional 175 + 303 on two separate charges. Consequently, since I didn't have that $ in my account at the time as I wasn't expecting to get charged anything, I was charged about 2 or 3 (maybe even more) overdraft fees as I had been using that card all weekend not expecting to receive any charges. So I call Westin to have this corrected and the dude that picked up the phone couldn't find me anywhere? So he tells me to call Hotwire and get the Westin confirmation #. Call Hotwire, wait on hold for about 30 minutes and get Westin confirmation #. Call Westin back, someone else answers and transfer me to accounting. Person in accounting was very helpful, but turns out I didn't need Westin confirmation # she pulled up my info no problem! So 30 minutes wasted on the phone with Hotwire. Lady in accounting says she sees the error and $ will not post to my account and they should fall off in a couple of days. In the mean time, my bank account is gonna be stuck in the negative and I can't use any of my $ until they fall off? Not to mention I'm going to have to call my bank now and get all those overdraft fees reversed.

I've used hotwire so many times and this is the first time I've ever run into this problem! Since this happened I've read other reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor of people experiencing the same problem. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. Not to mention there needs to be some customer service training on handling these types of situation. When you make a $478 mistake like that customer definitely needs to feel like they are being taken care of! Whoever that dude was that answered the phone and told me to call Hotwire ... left a horrible impression on me and really makes Westin look bad.

If you are booking directly with them and don't expect to experience these problems ... it is a very nice, quiet hotel. Has a small casino in the lobby as well as Starbucks, bar, and restaurant. Customer service I experienced prior to this situation was great. The errors came from the lady that checked me in and charged my card instead of taking payment from Hotwire and from the dude who totally did not take care of me and did not know how to handle the situation.",hh9wMtY9P5R9Q_V6oy8D9w,3,0,1,VtN8c0UUeDDfbZol09L0Qw

First, even though the facility appeared to have undergone a bit of a face lift...well it just didn't lift quite high enough for me. The rooms...even if you decided to put in a flat screen television (which they did) does not mean that it makes the room better. The carpet is worn over and the air did not work very well. Frankly it was a sauna, no matter how many times we tried to turn it down. The beds were okay. I just couldn't get past how worn the room seemed. In addition, very small. There was not a lot of wiggle room with two full size beds...oh that's right, the size of the bed. I am five foot five inches. When I spanned my arms across the bed my hands dangled over. Weird. I am happy I did not have to share.

On the plus side they do have a 24 hour Starbucks on site AND they have a coffee maker IN THE ROOM! This locate is geared towards business travelers. There is a 24 hour gym (which is quite nice actually, considering that I had just come from a place where their gym closed down at 7 pm....I know it is Vegas and I should be out drinking and causing general chaos at 7 pm not trying to work out). The WiFi was spotty, so much so that I wound up turning on my own hot-spot rather than deal with it.

As stated before this is not for the Vegas experience. It is located a few blocks from the strip and as someone mentioned before I don't believe that I would walk by myself at night from the strip back to the hotel. In fact, I didn't and I was with someone. We grabbed a cab rather then debate whether or not we may be uncomfortable.

So in a nutshell if I were a business traveler and wanted nothing else other than business amenities, then I would probably check this place out, maybe.

Oh...and stop saying you have a casino on location...just because you splattered a few machines on your lobby floor (okay maybe more than just a few) does not (in my head of course) qualify as a casino.

Yes, they were very busy; in my opinion that is just bad business for a hotel. The service was however outstanding and they were very apologetic and gave us a $25 dining comp...whoopy. I do not recommend the hotel restaurant. The rooms were very unmemorable, but we are in Vegas and never really in the room anyway. As many other Yelpers said, the bed was very comfortable. The plus about this place is that it is a very small hotel, so you don't have to walk a mile to find the exit like in many of the large Las Vegas hotels. 

If you are looking for glamorous lights flashing, music pumping, casino bells ringing, Las Vegas stereotypical kind of hotel, this is not it. This is not a bad choice however if you want something more low key, relaxing and easy access to get to the strip, meetings etc.

We arrived in the middle of the afternoon and we spent the rest of the day on the Strip - so we really only spent our time at the hotel to sleep and shower. 

Upon check-in, the front desk clerk was very kind and helpful. Our room was in good condition and met our basic needs. Our room didn't have a great view however, that is fine as we didn't spend much time in our room.

We didn't go to any of the bars or restaurants in the hotel nor did we use any of the amenities (spa, pool, gym, etc.) but I will say that the casino portion of the hotel was really small - therefore, I suggest going somewhere else for gambling.

Nope. 

(to clarify, I stayed here recently on a business trip, so I didn't get to choose where I stayed) 

PROS:
-room was clean and had a nice view (the High Roller as well as the Palazzo and Wynn) 
-the a/c was nice and cold, albeit noisy 
-it had nice toiletries and also some essential oils type stuff to use before bed. 
-bed was comfy as was the comforter
- there is complimentary water in the front lobby, although with temperatures in the 100s you kind of need that. 
- easy uber and Lyft pickup/drop off right in the front of the hotel 

CONS:
- I arrived pretty early on my first day, around 11 a.m., and my room wasn't ready. I wasn't super surprised about this but I did put in a request for an early check in, they said that they were sold out both days and that would text me when my room was ready. Check in was officially at 4 p.m. and they texted me around 3 p.m.
- because of this, I had to change from a more informal outfit to a business casual outfit for my conference, so I did this in their downstairs bathroom. I accidentally left my sweatshirt there and that was the last time I saw it. I contacted security but had to call them 3 times before they even called me back, only to tell me that they could not find my sweatshirt. (obviously, wasn't their fault that they couldn't find it, but the fact that I had to contact them three separate times is ridiculous) 
- they have a teeny tiny casino with about 20 to 30 slot machines if that. I signed up for their slot club right before I left because you got $5 in free play. I tried two different machines, wasted $5 on each of them, and never got my $5 free credit. I asked the cashier and they insisted that I already used the $5: I did not. As an FYI, they're also getting rid of the casino, which would explain why half the machines were dead and non-functioning.
- the fridge has a key, which I could see being useful if it was also a minibar, but it is not. Therefore every time I wanted to get water out of the fridge I had to open it with the key.
- floor in my room is uneven, which is rather strange - ie, if you put a marble down on the floor, it would definitely roll.
- check-in is not efficient, the first time I checked in there was only one regular front desk person and two Starwood Premiere (whatever it's called) front desk people. Eventually the Elite front desk people started helping the other people. When I had to check-in the second time, it still took about 10 minutes.
- you can hear your neighbors, as I write this it sounds like the person next door is blow-drying their hair. Luckily I had mostly quiet neighbors.

For someone who is used to staying at better-located hotels like Bally's and Paris on the Strip, this hotel was very disappointing to me. Our group rate was $120 per night and I feel like for that rate you could stay somewhere with a better location at least. I was especially disappointed considering it's a Westin and Westin/Starwood Hotels are usually pretty good. There's also a $24.99/day resort fee, which is laughable - they have a pool here and that's about it. Guessing that also pays for the wifi and the two free bottles of water in the room (which get replaced daily, I will say that is nice).

Overall - just a ""meh"" hotel.",rr5zzVWVu0u-P5P1rHIV-Q,7,1,2,LRok53MXhjsXFrrbHEy7fw

It took 45 minutes of being on the phone with them to figure out what a charge was on my card apparently they were supposed to charge $50 a night in incidentals they only charged me for one night so the $15.76 was to cover the amenity fee for the second day. Hard to get ahold of managers, literally they simply are not there I was connected to a manger's phone and after ten minutes it just went to voice mail. I had to call back multiple time to get a manager. The rooms have popcorn ceilings and my room had a shower for a handicapped person which might be nice if you are in a wheel chair but if not then you literally have to hold the hoes in one hand and hold it up they could have put in another shower head for non handicapped people.",yo46edqhingI59MoXgyPdg,1,0,1,DGGDRgDWluHIuFaVwrAuBA

1793184,2013-07-07,3,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"On the way back to our hotel after dinner and saw a sign that said $3 dollar craps(only during certain hours, not the whole day) which is extremely hard to find on or near the strip. The westin isn't exactly on las vegas blvd so it might be a little hard to find but it's across the street from bally's and next to bill's gambling hall which is now being renovated. We decided to stop by and play. The casino is pretty small but I was okay with the size because it wasn't so busy. If you wanted to play bj, craps, or roulette you can just walk in and play w/o waiting which is pretty cool. A lot of people associate the westin as just a hotel and not a casino so maybe that's why it wasn't so busy. 
Anyways, the reason I give it two stars is because I had a problem with the crap's dealer in particular a woman. She was extremely unethical and misleading. She would try to look for newbies and take advantage of them. She would help them play and at the same time tell them to put a couple dollars down thinking it's a bet that you made but what she was really doing was making bets for herself. For example, if the button was on 8 she would say give me 4 dollars to put on hard 8, but what she did was put 2 dollars on hard 8 for you and she would put 2 dollars on hard 8 for her. When the button is off she would say give me 4 dollars to put on yo (11) she would put $2 dollars for you and put $2 for herself. She was doing this throughout the whole night to this couple. I play craps a lot so I know how to bet she tried to do the same to me but I caught her and moved away so she can stop hustling me and stealing my money to make bets for herself.  She is a pretty attractive lady, she had an accent so I think she is from Europe or something. Watch out for her. She is very sneaky. You may think she is being nice and trying to help you make bets but really she is just making bets for herself. I played crap's at almost every major casino on the strip as well as the old strip and never has any dealer been this unethical and stealing money from people. I feel bad for the couple she took advantage of and all of the other customers she took advantage of. Hopefully, the pitt boss finds out what she is doing and has her stop. Out of the 4-5 dealers at the crap's table she was the only one asking money from people to place bets for herself/dealers.",frTEUYZYzBFTa8tconW3IQ,3,1,2,pOvlJS8T8HRD5ObpaQcSGw

1810743,2011-11-22,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"This hotel could be a lot better, but it's decent. 

There seems to be one truism with Vegas hotels - if it's inexpensive, it probably isn't renovated - and the surest way to tell is by looking at the TV. The Casuarina room we were given on a recent trip to Las Vegas was stocked with a relic Zenith CRT, which tells you pretty much how things went. 

The carpet in rooms is torn up near the door in some places, very obviously so. Not small tears, but big rips in the floor that look like huge gashes from much neglect. In our room, there was poorly-erased graffiti which looked like it was the product of either a drunk/stoned adult or an unsupervised child, maybe even both. The surrealist semi-erased poetic musings provided for an interesting couple showers. Either way the markings were visible all over the tile in the bathroom shower, wall and parts of the bathroom exterior.

There's also a resort fee which is standard fare, but no free WiFi/internet accompanying it. 

A few of my friends also booked rooms and I checked theirs out - same kind of general neglect.

The Casuarina has a casino, but honestly why would you go there when there are so many more lively options a block away? Basically this place is a hotel one block off the strip - the proverbial bed and a shower you need, but go elsewhere for amenities - and obviously they know it. Probably the best thing about this place is that it has a real Starbucks on the ground floor with chairs and some working space.

There was only one blackjack table open, and a second was in the process of opening.  Would have preferred to use the bet on roulette, but the table was closed.  So we waited for the second blackjack dealer to open, and then we approached the table.

1901926,2017-06-12,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Great hotel!  Quiet, yet convenient to the Strip!

I ran across a sale on rates for the Westin on hotels.com, which worked out well.  It enabled me to book them for a work trip to Vegas - normally they would be out of budget.

Check in was quick and efficient.  The gentleman who checked me in was kind and friendly.  I was offered a complimentary room upgrade and wound up with a room with an excellent view of the High Roller - the giant ferris wheel on the Strip. 

My room was quiet and clean.  The bed was super comfortable.  I also loved the the little extra touches here and there.  I was thrilled to find body wash in the bathroom.  So many hotels just do plain bar soap, so it was nice to find a toiletry I actually prefer.  I also thought the lavender balm on the night stand was a nice touch as well.  Very relaxing, especially when adjusting to West Coast time from East Coast time.

I ordered dessert from room service on my first night there.  I couldn't resist when I saw Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding listing on the menu (which apparently must be a local thing, as I spotted it on the menu of a local restaurant as well on this trip). I had it in my room in less than 20 minutes.  The gentleman who delivered it was very nice.  The serving was HUGE!  Rather than served in a dish or bowl, as bread pudding usually is, this came in two giant slices - like cake.  It was delicious!  I'm not ashamed to admit that I ate it all, even if it was so big it was probably meant to share.  

The hotel has the same amenities as most downtown Las Vegas hotels - bar, restaurant, spa, slots & table games, a gift shop, etc.  Certainly not to the same extent as the other resorts because the hotel was considerable smaller than others I've stayed in.  I found it to be a nice break from the craziness that can be found on the strip though!  An excellent choice if you aren't a first-timer and you've already experienced the Strip.

Additional pluses:
-The Strip is within easy walking distance.
-Parking at the hotel is free!  While I wasn't there during a terribly busy time, it seemed relatively easy to locate a parking space in the adjacent parking lot or garage, no matter the time of day.
-The WiFi was very reliable

I'd actually probably rate this hotel at a 4.5 if Yelp would allow it.  What prevented my 5-star rating?
-I found the elevators to be a little rough.  You have to insert your room key, then press your floor.  My key would not work in two of the six elevators.  That was a little annoying.  I also noticed that several of the elevators had graffiti in them.  Nothing too major or offensive, but you just don't expect to see that in a high end hotel like the Westin.  

-I wasn't impressed with the Starbucks in the lobby. One morning I went down and ordered a coffee frappucino made with almond milk.  It tasted terrible and wasn't fully blended.  Not sure if the coffee they used was burned or if the almond milk was out of date.  I don't blame the hotel for this, but if you are going to have Starbucks on site they should be consistent with other Starbucks and aim for high standards as they are catering to Westin guests.

-Lastly - I was asked at check-in approximately what time I would be leaving on the day of check out.  I noted it would probably be early as it was a work trip.  When plans changed I called the guest services line to request a later check out of 11 a.m.  I was told check out was in fact 11 a.m. and that I would be fine to leave at that time.  I noted on the phone that when I checked in I was asked to provide a check out time and that I was concerned that a note was made for house keeping.  I was told they would make a note of the change, but low and behold the morning of check out, I had housekeeping knock and attempt to enter my room while I was still there.  

None of the three items noted above would prevent me from booking at the Westin again though.  It was an overall wonderful experience and I will definitely keep them in mind for my future Vegas trips!",F5FjOYlaVqHMpo0Caoz6MA,0,0,4,CLtJW4ZEJvaMc7E6mAq72A

Wer eine Sightseeing Tour in Las Vegas und Umgebung beabsichtigt, 
ist im 4-Sterne ""Westin Las Vegas Hotel"" mit seinem Casino & Spa, bestens aufgehoben. 
Hier im Westin Hotel, stimmt alles, was wir uns als Gäste von einem perfekten Urlaubshotel wünschen.

Wir waren Ende September 2015, während einer Rundreise für 5 Nächte im ""Westin Las Vegas Hotel"" mit dem Ziel, uns die Sehenswürdigkeiten von Las Vegas anzuschauen und Ausflüge in die Umgebung zu unternehmen. 

Besser geht nicht und wir haben dieses Hotel während unseres Aufenthaltes, mit vielen anderen Hotels in Las Vegas verglichen.

Da ist zum einem die ideale Lage, direkt in der Mitte vom Strip in einer Seitenstraße, genau gegenüber dem derzeit höchsten Riesenrad der Welt, dem High Roller im Vergnügungskomplex ""The LINQ"". 

Vom Hoteleingang her, sind es u. a. nur wenige Meter bis zum berühmten ""Bally's Hotel & Casino"", welches am weltberühmten ""Las Vegas Strip"" liegt, also genau mittendrin im Geschehen. Auch die Haltestellen der ""BIG Bus Doppeldeckerbusse"", für eine ""Hop-on Hop-off-Tour"" durch das Las Vegas liegen ebenso, wie das Las Vegas ""Monorail, nur wenige Schritte vom Hotel entfernt.

Dennoch liegt das ""Westin Las Vegas Hotel"" sehr ruhig und hat für Gäste die mit dem Auto anreisen, direkt hinter dem Hotel sehr viele (und auch kostenlose) Parkplätze. 

Das Hotel ist mit seinen ca. 820 Gästezimmern und Suiten für Las Vegas nicht allzu groß, aber auch nicht zu klein. 

Aus unserer Sicht, einfach genau richtig, um  zum einen den Gästen noch etwas zu bieten, wie z. B. das hauseigene Casino, ohne das es durch seine Größe, unpersönlich und unübersichtlich wird. 

Nicht nur das gesamte Hotel Ambiente, sorgte bei uns für eine angenehme Wohlfühlatmosphäre, sondern auch der perfekte, aufmerksame, kompetente und freundliche Service der Rezeptionsmitarbeiter (und hier besonders Mr. Gregori Jones). Das betrifft auch, die sehr gute Fachkundige Betreuung durch die Concierge Mitarbeiter.

Besonders hervorheben möchten wir auch die Möglichkeit, dass man sich tagsüber am Außenpool in der ersten Etage erfrischen kann. 
Hier haben wir immer einen Liegeplatz, ob im Schatten oder auf der Sonnenliege, vorgefunden. 
Ps. Richard von der Poolbar, spricht übrigens auch perfekt Deutsch. 

Sehr schön ist auch das Fitnessstudio ""WestinWORKOUT"" welches rund um die Uhr geöffnet ist und frisches Obst, Mineralwasser, Handtücher und Zeitschriften anbietet.
Ein Highlight für uns, war auch die ""Nightly Happy Hour"" am Pool, womit sich das Hotel seinen Gästen gegenüber bedanken möchte. Hier gab es ab 18:00 Uhr, für eine Stunde kostenlose Snacks, Bier und Wein zu genießen, die in den Servicegebühren des Hotels inbegriffen sind. Sehr nette Aufmerksamkeit, um auch andere Gäste kennenlernen bzw., 
um einfach nur Kraft für die langen Nächte in Las Vegas zu sammeln.   

Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, dass wir mit dem Hotel-Personal (besonders Mrs. Hamilton, welche unsere Vorabwünsche, weitestgehend berücksichtigt hatte), Zimmer, Hotelatmosphäre/Sauberkeit, kostenlosen WLAN und seiner besonderen Lage für Sightseeing ""SEHR ZUFRIEDEN"" waren und würden jeder Zeit wieder ins ""Westin Las Vegas Hotel"" gehen.

Einmal Westin, immer Westin, weil wir noch nie schlechte Erfahrungen, bei dieser Hotelmarke der Starwood Hotels, gesammelt haben.

Für uns einfach nur ""famos"" und the perfect place to vacation !!!",9i1QzLfpMrXVUl73ZxI9WQ,2,0,5,cja-2vBoTqg4ozpJl0pBVA

I had never paid a resort fee before and did not know what that was.  I later found out that no other chess player at the tournament was charged a resort fee.  When I brought this to the attention of the hotel, they said I made my room reservation wrong and that is why I had to pay the resort fee.  I noted I had made the reservation through the Westgate 1-800 number and had asked for the chess rate.  They never explained how that could have been the wrong way.  They never told me exactly what they thought I should have done to avoid this problem.  I was told that I did not get the chess rate.  In order to try to get back some of this money I felt was stolen from me, I had to not eat or gamble at the place I was staying.  While the food prices are high at the Westgate, it would have been easier to eat there between rounds of chess rather than have to go to another casino to eat.  I also like to gamble some if I have a lot of time between rounds, but was forced to leave the casino to do that also.  I will never be able to eat or gamble at this casino again.  Since the chess tournament is there every year lately, that will be a problem.

The Westin met the mark for what we needed for a 1-night stay (no, not a 1-night stand) in Vegas. 

$110 gets you a top floor room, 2 comfy Queen beds, check-in @ 12pm, clean hotel (very little smoke), friendly staff, free and efficient valet, 24-hour Starbucks in the lobby, good toiletries and the lowest ""resort fee"" I've seen ($12). 

If you're really picky, here are some points that you may want to consider (though to be honest, it didn't affect our stay that much, being how short it was): 
* Pool is mini 
* Strip is 2 blocks down 
* No fancy view 
* No fancy club attached 
* No iPod dock in the room 
* Daily charge for wireless 
* No masseuse on 24-hour call.......

The gentleman that processed our transaction was fantastic, he upgraded our room, sent housekeeping to de-feather it (I'm allergic), and was super helpful. The bellman was very nice. The room was beautiful, clean, the bed was comfy, I was very happy with everything, My one and only gripe was that the fridge was solely a mini bar., in the sweltering heat cold drinks would have been tops.

The overall feel is ""updated 10 years ago and needs it again.""  The whole place is overly beige and quite boring, which depending on your attitude, can be a refreshing change from the over-the-top-ness of other Strip hotels.

The rooms are quite big with comfortable Westin beds and handsome modern sleek furniture. 

Staff were efficient and friendly in minimal interactions, but the maids offering a heartfelt ""hello"" and the desk staff offering a ""aww, there' right down there, honey"" when a tired me said ""i can't find the elevators!"" both made my day a little better.

- no free Wifi (seriously, it's 2012, why do high end hotels still nickle and dime us for wifi when we get it free at Motel 6)

But I've been in plenty of Sheratons and Westins to know this place falls way short. 

Located right behind the Flamingo casino so it's not far on the strip, make sure to tell the cab driver at the Vegas airport to go to the ""Westin Casuarina"". 

We booked into a deluxe room on what appeared to be a Starwood Preferred Guest floor. I'm not sure the Starwood rooms are supposed better or worse than the regular rooms. But this is what I found. 

Bathrooms no vent. The TV is really old, not-HD, not really flat-screen, rather small size, no DVD player, and it doesn't have the channel/movie selection that other hotels in the chain do. 

Temperature change worked fine. Starbucks coffee grounds for the machine. Sheets clean. iHome on the nightstand. No weird stains on carpet. We could see a view of the pool. If you're thinking of a pool party, this is not a good place to do it.

Overall it was that crummy TV that really put a damper on our visit. First the controller stopped working, call to front desk #1. They got us a new controller. That helped for while. Then the buttons on the actual TV and controller again stopped working, to the point where we couldn't turn it on or off. Call to front desk #2. 

They came in the following day to try to fix it. When we got back from dinner and a couple of bars we tried at it again. TV and controller worked but then it started having issues with channel changes, both on the TV and by the controller. 

By check-out I just noted to them that the damn old thing should probably just be thrown away. They said they'd check it out and apologized sincerely.

Now, I didn't come to Vegas to lounge and watch TV, but it would've been nice to have it on and catch up on some brain-numbing TV or news when getting ready to head out in the morning, etc. I also wanted to note that staff was nothing but courteous and responsive to the ability they were able.

First off...they put us on the floor where the pets were (we reserved 3 rooms) we didn't realize it until we heard a bunch of dogs barking...not only that a bunch of us got bed bug bites all over our back.  (sickening) then we ordered room service, they messed up on that order and then it took about a whole hour to receive my refund which they didn't even do correctly and refunded back the whole bill when they were suppose to just refund 1 item (idiots! but that's good for me) to top it all off, my friends booked 2 separate couple massages only 1 couple massage happened because they woman that booked the appointment thought it was only for one couple well in fact we clearly said on the phone.  It was a disaster!!  They only compensation was a free massage (only to be used at the Westin Las Vegas)

this place is pathetic!  Maybe others have had a more pleasant stay but ours was a nightmare.

Might I lastly add, I learned that this a privately owned Westin which probably explains that sorry ass service.",hrbhaZ3LVI_QMXvRMgSP2Q,5,3,1,HBtOlO6Kt-YD6YUfpr9iVA

I took a star away because the service was very slow at check in and at the bar. I called earlier to see if I can check in earlier, they told me I can wait around to check in. When I arrived a few minutes before check in time of 4pm, they told me I wouldn't be able to get a room until 5:30pm and that those who arrived earlier were getting their rooms first. They got my number down and told me they would page me. Once they paged me the line was so long and not moving. I ended up cutting the line but others were directed toward the back of the hour long line. I found that to be ridiculous. Now that I think about it, I should take off two stars for that, there was no reason out rooms couldn't be available by check in time. That's never happened to me at any other hotel.

If you're looking for some action at the tables, they do have cheap craps and blackjack after 4 pm.  Not a large gambling floor, but not a bad spot to kill some time and not worrying about losing a ton of money with the relatively low minimum bets.

Room: The room was modern and sleek, all the furnishings were in great condition and the room was very very clean. They include lavender oil to help you sleep better....nice touch! The hallways were quiet as well so it's a great option for someone looking to get away from the noise.

Pool: Pool area was nice, and not too crowded. It is open all night which is wonderful.

The Casino that used to be here is closed. They decided to do away with the casino and build dining options for guests. That area is currently walled off completely except for the front desk to check in.

The first floor lobby is not a lobby, it is a really cheap-looking casino. The hotel probably posted 2000 signs that say ""No Smoking,"" but it reeks of smoke. 

When I called to order breakfast, they neglected my order b/c they couldn't figure out my room number (doesn't the phone service do that automatically, that's why they know your last name?!) I called an hour later to ask where my food was, and the manager had to fix this simple problem. 

The chicken entree I ordered was terrible. Teaches me for being lazy and wanting to stay in my room for the internet. Chicken was dry and tasteless, fries were way, way, way too salty, there was too much salad dressing and it was too rich. 

Apparently Starwood members are supposed to get free drink service every night, but when I checked in, they specifically told me it was not a complimentary service. 

I received an urgent FedEx package the morning after I checked in, and no one bothered to inform me. No slip under my door, no phone call. Again I had to track it down myself.

Of course, there were also a few good things about this place. The guy who hails cabs is super nice and friendly, and so is the guy who brings up room service.

(Read my review of the Summerfield Suites in Chatsworth for THAT story.) All in all, it was a small, comfortable, relatively clean hotel with a nice workout room, and is also pet-friendly. Definitely a good priceline.com Name Your Own Price deal.

...But was it really four stars the way it's being billed? Umm, probably not. Their pool is literally the size of a deck of cards, and the spa has a capacity of 9. Maybe this would be ok in San Diego, but VEGAS?! Aside from gambling, what *else * can you do in 110 degree heat other than visit the pool? Not very well done, Westin. I appreciate that they tried to gussy it up with a live DJ and a few lovehandled cocktail waitresses (nice attempt, Starwood), but when you can only have about 30 people anywhere around the pool at a given time, it's hardly worth it. If you have a car, go sneak into the Wynn, like we did.

I was also EXTRAORDINARILY happy hat it's a non-smoking hotel. I didn't have to wake up each day smelling like death. Yay!

One last thing -- don't let the Westin people pull their $10/day ""hotel services"" scam on you. If you book through Priceline, THAT is the negotiated total. So when you're ready to check out and you see that the staff have surreptitiously slipped a billing notice of $10/day for ""hotel services,"" march your Vegas-sunkissed ass downstairs and (nicely) demand to be told the meaning of the letter, and then sweetly but firmly refuse to pay it. Because it's bullshit. And price gouging.  They just hope you're too drunk and/or hung-over to notice. They'll probably tell you ""ok we'll waive it, but JUST THIS ONCE,"" and you say ok, and then remind yourself not to stay there again.

This time around, my group of girls decided on the Westin. It was not on the strip, but close enough to walk to it. Remember, if you are in heels, this does not count and you will end up calling taxis to get to the strip (as we did). 

As for the hotel:

It smelled beautiful when we walked in. They had floral arrangements everywhere which instantly made me like the place. The decor is absolutely beautiful.The rooms were clean and modern, ours had a KILLER view of the strip. Our check in was smooth and everyone was very accommodating. 

The staff was incredibly sweet and met our every need. From the doorman to the housekeeper, everyone was simply amazing! I cannot stress how comfortable we all felt at Westin! 

The hotel had a free happy hour and snack reception for the guest (amazing!). The hotel had happy hour casino hours which was fun. The casino is tiny compared to the rest of the casinos on the strip, but then again who cares, Westin is primarily a hotel. Overall, the experience was great. The hotel was overall peaceful and calm (not the regular insane Vegas ambiance). I personally loved the Westin! Peace and calmness in crazy Vegas! Five stars!

I'd also recommend some better airconditioning in the casino area, the air was so thick of smoke, my eyes became irritated immediately upon entering. 

It's also a very short walk to the strip. It's behind Bally's so if it's a hot day, enter Bally's and you can go straight to Paris and Planet Hollywood from there!

convenience store just a 1.5 minute walk from the front doors, yes, yes, very convenient! Plus if you decide you want the huge flashy casino, drunk frat boys, and smokey atmosphere, the strip is right up the block!

Some of the other Yelper's complaints on here seem unwarranted to me. I have stayed at this hotel 5 or 6 times on various floors and have never had any problems. I don't see many signs of wear and tear at all. The rooms are decorated very modern (no hideous flowered bedspreads here!), the hallways are painted and carpeted in calming, nuetral tones.

The $15 a day fee is not uncommon for many reputable hotels to charge. You should always ask about additional taxes and fees when booking a hotel room to get an actual price that you'll be paying. If you don't, that's your bad!

I hate stale cigarette smoke. (Just YUCK.) 

I hate seeing flocks of scantily clad, barely 18 yo young women desperately prowling bars and lobbies in search of men willing to pay them for mediocre, over-acted sex. 

I hate cab lines. (See: lines) 

I hate paying too much money for mediocre food. 

I hate casino buffets. (There is nothing - literally NOTHING - to love about casino buffets. There are casino buffets in hell.)

I like Cirque Du Soleil. 

I like the desert. 

I like Red Rocks - it's stunningly gorgeous.

There is simply no substitute for the big resorts/hotels in the middle of the strip.  You should only stay here if you fully understand that this is a hotel with a small casino; but not a proper Vegas casino resort/hotel.

The biggest upside of this hotel is it offers a 'stress-free' experience only 10 minutes walk away from the strip Bally's.  There's no attraction/night clubs/sports bar at the hotel which means you do not get throngs of tourists/club goers/loud sports fans/loud bachelor party groups partying here.  Even though there's only one restaurant in the property there's never a line either.

The room-
Nicely appointed as I've come to expect from a Westin 'standard'.  During my recent stay (May 2012) it seems they have also upgraded the TV's to large flat screens.  The deluxe city view is approx 200sqft.  A coffee machine, safe and a lazy chair are included in the amenities.
All rooms are smoke free even though smoking is allowed on the casino floor (adjacent to lobby).

The location-
A lot of people might be put off by their 'off strip' location.  However, I honestly feel that this hotel's location is as good as 'on strip'.  They are located about 10 minutes walk behind Bally's.  Due to the fact that Bally's is at the center of the strip this means you can get to Caesars and City Center complex under 30 minutes on foot.  This is a big plus for me on a busy holiday weekend since it's a pain to get in or out of those casino's by cab due to traffic/wait line.  I would argue that the location of this hotel is better than the 'on-strip' hotels at the far north/south ends of the strip.

Service-
Nothing left to be desired ... pretty much in line with what's expected from Westin.  Check-in agent seems to have authority to offer 'freebies'.  We mentioned that we're in Vegas to celebrate my engagement and was given a free bottle of champagne and cheese platter.
There is one 24hr restaurant and a starbucks (also open 24hr) on location.  Their players' card comped $ can be used at starbucks.
Free beer and wine for an hour during their 'social hour'

Price-
Weekend rates about $125-$150 per night.  They are sometimes found on Yuupon discounted rates and I managed to get a rate of $100 for 2012 memorial weekend.

In conclusion, this should be part of your short list if you need a hotel to rest after a night out on the strip due to it's convenient location and the good value for money that it offers; but you're not looking to stay in a 'Vegas' style suites / resorts.",r01zHizMGnxS00AqXyJb8Q,1,0,4,ei3aqe9mOUGnJdPfvugrZQ
2527342,2017-12-24,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"As far as hotels go, Westin is a great deal for those who want to be right near the Strip but want to avoid staying right on it. It's located just south of the middle strip off, about 2 blocks east and is easy walking distance. Check in is hit and miss, either pleasantly efficient or sluggishly long and it is not common to get a ""still cleaning and we will call you when your room is ready"" speech. You can place luggage there so not a huge deal but just beware. The rooms themselves are standard. Smell good, modern looking, clean and cozy. Noise level is not a problem here for the most part. Considering the price you will pay compared to other hotels, this is a great value. The casino inside the Weston on the other hand is a complete joke. It is usually dead until the weekend evening and even then, nothing special. It is the lowest minimum I have seen in Vegas though so if you like that, come over. I would like to see better service on check in. It seems to be the only issue, that and the parking structure could use a remodel, at least a new elevator. Overall, Westin may not be the glamour and fame of the strip or other properties but it really is the best bang for your buck when on a budget. Definitely worth it especially if it is last minute weekend getaway.",Z1GkmmyhHAG8Q1e_QEOGgw,1,3,3,H8YDyylaOor4r_cPgejM3w

2549504,2012-05-26,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"The Westin has some good things about it, and some bad things about it.

I usually stay there when on business travel, and I suspect most of their guests do too.  They seem to have a lot of airline employee guests (flight attendants, etc) as well.

Good:
- It's supposed to be smoke free.  It mostly is (see below).
- The fitness center is decent.
- The pool and hottub are open until 3AM.  No one seems to know this, so there is rarely anyone in there late in the day.
- If you get one of the SPG floor rooms, the rooms are upgraded and up to a normal Westin standard.
- You can walk around the corner to Ellis Island, which has great BBQ, their own beer, and pretty good pizza.
- Starbucks is open 24 hours, but it's a hotel Starbucks, so it's overpriced.
- Free happy hour (I think) sometime around 5.  Beer and wine, chips.  Hey, it's free, don't complain.

Bad:
- The casino on the first floor allows smoking.  So the lobby area of the hotel is not smoke free.  It's not as bad as other hotels, but it's definitely not a completely smoke free hotel.
- As Westins go, this one is far below the standard.
- There's really nothing to do around here.  I know its not the Strip, but for example the Hard Rock Hotel (the other place I stay for business) is right across from almost a dozen restaurants, shops, etc.

I have to highlight one standout - one of the front desk staff, Dalarie (hope I spelled that right) is super nice and one of most competent Sheraton employees I've had the pleasure of dealing with.  I hope her managers read this and recognize her value to the hotel.",m7mQf4FbNRZ6u1wrHEmonQ,1,0,3,_vkD5GQocB0Ot2UmLho-5g

The key to that statement is ""off-strip."" Its not a Paris or Bellagio, but rather a tranquil, spa-like experience that happens to be 1 block away from the strip.

The rooms are small, but very well appointed. Our ""dream"" beds were incredibly comfortable and relaxing. The color scheme is slate grey, soft greens and blues with pure white linens, so the room feels much airier and cleaner than the rest of Vegas. It feels like an escape.

There is no smoking allowed in the hotel. 

It has a near-by liquor store, 7-11, Baptista's and Ellis Island casino for cheap, fast food, liquor, and snacks. The pizza place in Ellis Island blew me away honestly.

The staff is helpful and friendly but no cabs seem to come to this hotel. I think it is because they push their hotel car service so much, which I am not a big fan of.

Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean. Nothing to boast about other than comfy bed that I didn't get to utilize -_- curse those clubs hehe.

Requested 2 additional cots, 1 per room which they were kind enough to roll in

Whenever I needed something and they weren't sure they'd double check.
Razors? Yes
Bandages? Yes. Though they're hulk purple lol.

Staff here was very professional and courteous. 

Love that they give option to wave a cleaning fee. $5 credit towards membership or to restaurants. I have to check if they gave me the credit though.

Thank you for reaching out to me Samantha.  I am a Starwood account holder, so I always reach for Starwood hotels when I travel.  I have stayed at this Westin in the past, as I visit Las Vegas for business twice per year.  I had not been to this Westin in several years, but happy to get back as I recall the comfortable atmosphere of this place and remember it as a non-gambling hotel, which appeals to me as I am not a gambler and don't really care for that atmosphere.  I have to let you know that my experience was not as I had expected, it was rather disappointing. First surprised to know that things had changed and gambling is alive and well there.  It felt like I was Marty McFly in Back to The Future, Part 2 when he goes to Biff Tannen's hotel, but it wasn't quite that bad.   
My room was placed on the 3rd floor, directly above the spa where the renovation is taking place.  I was greeted quite early each morning with loud sounds of construction equipment making drilling sounds.  That was quite disturbing.  I wondered why in the world Billie (the kind and friendly front desk person) would place anyone in this room, I thought she liked me!  My view was not so hot either, I'm sure you're seen my room, 319.  My view was of the air conditioning ducts.  I mean, I'd rather have a parking lot view over that one.  On the upside, I was really happy that you have Starbucks in the lobby, which made me quite happy.  All your staff that I encountered was very kind and professional.  You know how it is when one thing goes wrong, and then you start to see everything in a critical light?  I was going there throughout my stay, and I am sorry to say that because I am usually a fan of all Starwood hotels.  It was highlighted in the lobby on my first night when I walked through the lobby to find your restaurant.  As I navigated the area, I encountered a barefoot man sitting at a slot machine apparently intoxicated and your security people were about to throw him out.  Suddenly I felt like George Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life and Nick is going have me thrown out of Martinis Bar and I just want to get home to Zuzu.  So the terrible view and the construction disturbance were the two things that ruined it for me, and the barefoot man too, so actually three things. 
So, no my confidence was not restored.  But why did you assume my confidence was not there before I checked in?  As I said, I am a fan of Starwood, so you've got me confused there. 
Again, thank you for reaching out to me and allowing me to share my thoughts about my experience at your hotel.  With so many choices of hotels in Las Vegas, we really need to work on the restoring my confidence now",B93LDAs_8puWdehYYXWKgw,0,0,2,qrKYgpaMnBkQZpqTLrGeqA

Also, they had very thin walls. You could hear the voices from your neighbors, the upstairs and the downstairs.
Finally, your options for gambling are quite limited. In the morning I only saw some black jack tables open.

I left some wedges in the lobby. I called housekeeping who was kind enough to return my shoes. I was quoted around $12 and was charged nearly $20. This was the first issue. Secondly, I was returned my shoes full of mold! I called immediately because I was upset they were in that condition and also because that's a HUGE health hazard. AJ and Manuel Juarez were beyond rude, condescending, and unhelpful. They refused to refund my money for the shipping. I will NEVER stay at a hotel with staff as horribly rude as them. There is a lack of accountability and concern for guests. This was a health hazard! Simply unacceptable.",pYTO5RS2_4TydS7YWETAtw,0,0,1,gFC9gRaz5xu1SntQZ4vAgg

Okay, I have been here several times and I would rather choose this hotel over mega-resorts for the following reason.

1. It is off ""The Strip"" but not too far
2. It smells so good
3. The rooms are very nice
4. The staff is always friendly
5. It is small and more personal
6. Easy parking
7. Nice restaurant with quality food (NO BUFFET THANK GOD)
8. Non-smoking hotel
9. Nice gym
10. Rubber duckie

Okay, so some of those things people can live without, but if you are not into the big over-priced resorts on the strip that smell like cigarettes all day, and battling people just to get from point A to point B, and like the idea of not taking an hour just to find a parking space, this place is for you.

I think this place is great after being out in all the bustle of Las Vegas all day, you can come back to this quiet respite.  It has everything you want, but it is only like 10-15 minutes from all the other great places Las Vegas has to offer.

For those SPG members, there always seems to be some promotion or give away for SPG members.  Points, free breakfast, what not.  If you are not an SPG member, sign up at the hotel, they will probably give you a room upgrade.",qQS7enTn8OZb_5IK96-gkw,1,1,5,uSC50A47xxDDW4MKXGxeYw

The construction everyone is talking about is on the 16th floor. During our stay noise was not a problem at all. We were offered a 15th floor room for early check in but we decided against it. There are 17 floors to the hotel and all of the odd rooms will face the strip. It was a nice view with the big Faris wheel lit up at night it's very pretty. I also liked that you could rent gym gear (shoes, the shirt, shorts and socks) for five dollars. I only got the shoes because the shirt and shorts weren't in my size. I pay at checkout so for the duration of my stay I was able to use the shoes for only $5. I guess if u return shirts/shorts and get new ones it would be $5/day. The gym was very nice as well. New machines with the elliptical having TV! There was also free weights dumbells up to 50lbs. Two adjustable benches. Towels, earbuds, water cooler, fruits the whole works! The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Overall we had a great stay at the hotel. The only reason it's not five stars is the bathroom. The hot and cold knobs for the faucet was flip flopped. My wife said she couldn't get hot water for her morning shower (~9am). I didn't experience this problem when I showered ~6am.

I have been to some 4 star hotels, and you Sir Westin Casuarina are not a 4 star hotel. This place is more like a 2 1/2 star hotel in my opinion.

The only good thing about this hotel is it is off the beaten path and you can get decent parking near your hotel room. The shades and the curtains keep the room dark when you want to sleep in after a long night that turns into dawn. And I guess this place is relatively cheap when compared to the other hotels in town. Also the rooms are non-smoking but smoking is allowed at the bar.

Like a thief in the night I found an invoice that was already run on my credit card from the hotel in my room for a ""Resort Fee"", about $13 bucks a night. I still can't figure out what goodies I got for that ""Resort Fee"". Memo to Management, make it mandatory for the front desk personnel to explain the Resort Fee to guests upon check-in and what do you actually get for that Resort Fee. Because I didn't get Shit.

Now, the reason for the bad review:
On the night of Saturday July 1st to Sunday 2nd , at about 2 to 3 am, the fire alarm starting ringing. Both our kids were sleeping when the alarm rang and waked up. Fortunately it was announced that it was a false alarm and we were advised to stay in our rooms, a couple of minutes later the alarm stopped. The kids tried to sleep again, but my older was very scared since he has had bad experiences in the past with the alarms. About 1 hour later, the alarm rang again, this time with a different tone, and after 2 minutes no announcement was made, so I decided to take my family to the lobby. At this moment, both my kids are awake, the older one is crying in panic and the younger one is running all around the lobby. Well, when I got to the front desk, I really felt bad for them, they looked scared and desperate. They told me that a water leakage and that activated the fire alarm. At this point the alarm hasn't stopped ringing, so there is no point in trying to put the kids to bed. Front desk offers me 100$ for each room of F&B without me asking, which I accept. My sister in law says that it is not enough, after talking to who appeared to be a manager, she also got the first night off. After about an hour the alarm shuts off and we go back. I did find odd that the personnel was taking notes in paper instead of the computer. The next day in the afternoon I wanted to double check and the person that talked to us stated that there was no note about a reimbursement, only a note stating that all patrons that came to the lobby to complaint will get credit in F&B. The same person mentioned that those that did not show up to the lobby the next day ""will not get nothing"". I mentioned that we also had a reimbursement, at that moment he says let me bring my boss. The manager, named ""Greg"", was very defensive from the start. The very first thing that he mentioned was that my sister in law ""did not understand well"" (she is Hispanic and was there next to us) and that he will do one or the other, not both, he mentioned that there is no note beside what his agent mentioned, and that that is all he can do. Then the story changes. It is not that my sister in law did not understand, but that the night staff is not ""empowered"" to make that decision (at that moment I understood the paper notes). Then I tried to explain to him our experience and point of view, during which he did stop to interrupt me, I was not upset, but at this point I am starting to get upset. I told him to please let me finish explaining what happened, and he said that ""I didn't need to, since he read the email(?)"", he mentioned that the problem was that in the morning, the manager came and said that ""only a maximum of 100$ of F&B will be given to the people that complained the next day"". Then I tell him that he had to understand the situation of his colleagues, there was a long line of angry customers and that I put myself in their position since I have 15 years of experience dealing with customers in different companies, then he interrupted me to mention that he had ""22 years of experience"". At this point he gets tired and says, ""ok I will give you the credit and reimburse the night"", my brother in law did not hear the last part, and stated, ""can you please repeat, I am sorry"", and he looks at him in the eye and replies: ""then why are you here? I am giving you what you wanted"". Then I say, ""I hope this time you write it down, since I don't want to have the same discussion tomorrow morning"", to what he replies ""HA HA HA"" making fun of me. And there is where I get upset and I ask him, ""what is that about?"", and he replied that since I am sarcastic, then he can be sarcastic too, I say ""I am your customer, I had a bad experience and you are being rude"", he replies that he is entitled to his opinion of people and that it doesn't matter who is customer in this situation. Then my wife states that she is going to leave a bad review and he answers ""I DON'T CARE, you can do what you want"" she goes to the line to check in and starts telling people about the bad experience. He mentions then to us in a very high voice that staying in the hotel is a privilege and not a right and he can kick us out anytime if he wanted. I was about to tell him to forget about everything and simply reimburse me, that there are thousands of hotels in Las Vegas and we can take our business somewhere else, but my brother in law did not want to move. I wanted to let everyone thinking in staying here, that some personnel do not care about the customers (proof: the way we were treated), their own colleagues (proof: the way he referred to the night shift and their situation) or the brand (proof: they don't care about bad reviews).",X---7hep94PofsRjcswuLw,1,0,1,NsbDxAkGY0QLaT_CQESQ2A

My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few nights on a recent trip. It was over New Year's Eve, so all of the rooms on The Strip were booked. My boyfriend is a platinum member with Starwood hotels and usually loves them, so he booked a few nights here before we transitioned to Mandalay Bay.

The lobby of the hotel was underwhelming and didn't offer many options for food. There was a dining area where we ate breakfast each morning, which was a nice option, but the food was extremely mediocre.

The rooms were very dated. The tile on the bathroom floor was filthy and several of our tiles were cracked. Being so close to the strip, I would expect them to up their game a bit to compete, but this was worse than any other hotel we've stayed in.

3272105,2009-12-10,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"When I ended up with the Westin after bidding on 4-star hotels on Priceline, I was really disappointed to end up at the only non-party, non-themed 4-star hotel that was also located off the strip.  After my stay, I found it was really not bad....probably nowhere I would stay on purpose, but not bad.
The Westin is a small non-smoking hotel with a small casino, a Starbucks, one restaurant and a small bar.  It caters primarily to business clientele and I noticed a lot of elderly people staying there.  

The first negative point to this hotel, was the fact that they charged a 15-dollar resort fee, despite the fact that I bid on Priceline.  When I asked what it included, he told me that it included the pool, the fitness center, maid service and bottled water  ( all the stuff that most hotels include in the cost).  It is a bummer that they do not tell us this until check-in.  What he failed to tell me about was the awesome FREE happy hour....if it hadn't been for these Yelp reviews, I would've missed the biggest perk.

Well, let me tell you...this happy hour was awesome...5:30-7:30 everyday, all-you-can-drink wine, beer, soft drinks....and sangria!  The frirst day just included chips, salsa, and chili dip.  The second there was a simple buffet of quesadillas, pizza, fruit, veggies, chips, cheeses, and lots of other odds and ends.  The best part is that we shared our tables with other hotel guests, as this is in a private reception room, and, as this hotel is the choice for Delta to put up their employees, we met a group of pilots one night and flight attendants the next...it was fun to make new friends and start the party.  We even got sangria to go!
Otherwise, the hotel was not a lot of fun. The rooms are comfortable but not special.  The beds are comfortable and showerheads are massaging, but the rooms are small and the tub had some mildew.  The staff was really friendly and all wore cute cowboy hats in honor of the rodeo that was in town.  We were told they would be switching to santa hats soon for Christmas.  Because the hotel is small, it was easy to find our way around, and we were able to avoid any long lines.  It may be off the strip, but it is so close it doesn't matter.  It is less than a block from Balley's and a short walk to Ceasar's.

3290218,2010-07-06,2,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"My friends and I loved every bit of our stay at the Westin!  It was just what we were looking for - slightly off the strip, quiet, clean, and smoke-free.  In other words, it isn't your typical loud, crazy, happenin' Vegas hotel with a loud lobby and a gazillion guests.  So if that's what you're looking for, it's probably best to go elsewhere.

We booked the Westin for $105/night through Priceline during July 4th Weekend - this was such a steal compared to the other hotels on the strip.  

So why did we love the Westin?

1.  No problems with Early Check-in.  They were quick and accommodating.  We got there 2 hours before check-in time and our rooms were already good to go.  

2.  Smoke-free lobby and casino area.  There is a large, but relatively empty casino area... but since all of us are non-smokers we really appreciated the fresh, clean air.

3.  Starbucks in the lobby.  Gotta get a cup of our daily joe before we head out for endless fun!

4.  The Beds.  I slept like a baby on the plush, luxurious, pillow-soft beds.  No complaints.  At all.

5.  The Shower.  The water pressure was AMAZING!!!  It has TWO showerheads so the water is blasting and heats up easily.  

The only negative I can think of is that we wanted to lay out by the pool, but realized that the Westin pool is pretty small.  It's not like anything you'd find at Mandalay Bay or Bellagio.  However, after some quick research I discovered that the gazillion pools at Caesar's Palace are open to the general public FREE of charge.  Good thing Caesar's is so close to the Westin.

The Westin is only a 10 minute walk to the strip, which isn't bad at all.  You can see Caesar's Palace from the hotel room, and the Westin is located on the cross street between Flamingo, Caesar's, and Paris Hotel... so it's actually a pretty prime location!

From the moment we pulled in, the valet totally set the tone of our stay. He was awesome and the bell check was great as well! He followed us in with our bags and directed us to check in. The woman who checked us in was great! She gave us a complimentary late check out right off the bat and a free whiskey tasting as well as free dessert for each day of our stay.

The room was beautiful. Very spacious and updated. It smelled great and was extremely clean. Their beds were very comfortable and I loved that there were 4 pillows on the bed! Normally, you have to fight to get an extra pillow from house keeping at other hotels. The bathroom was beautiful with great lighting and the toiletries were great as well. 

The room service was great as well! We got dessert every night and loved every bite. Even the waiter who took care of us for room service was amazing. AND, they quote 30 minutes or under for all room service. How great is that? The bar downstairs is beautiful and the bartenders were always delightful.

Even though this is not on the strip, it's worth the stay. You're only a 5 minute walk and the way your treated makes it all worth it. Vegas can be very hectic. It's nice to have a relaxing place to return to throughout the day and night.",OrpwDyQm74hLznBtGJifBw,3,3,5,lvAjYhA-2f1SA4bYQ9qSbA

great feature:24 hour rather open and inviting layout Starbucks with the comfiest of blue armchairs. I like....

That is why I gave them 4 stars. Water bottles are all free. In fact, this hotel is heavily used by airline crew:pilots, flight attendants, etc. 

Suite was very large. 2 windows had pretty south-facing views, and of the pool on the 2/F. Btw, pool is open 21 hours a day!!!! waaay cool. Buffet breakfast $18. Looked too awesome. Inside Suede restaurant.

From the perspective of Westins and as they go, this would probably qualify as a dud, underwhelming, not luxurious enough for its Westin namesake. The pool is plain and small, and overall, some features could be quite newer and dazzle-worthy.

Good 10-15 minutes walk to the Strip ( go via Bally's as we did). Mist sprayers at the doorway.

But the lobby is very nice, there are $3 craps tables and 25 ct roulette from 6-8 pm, and the happy hour was quite nice. Glass of Chardonnay, light bites, all inside the conference room to the right of Sbux.

PS their King Heavenly bed was not heavenly at all. Sad to report: it was stiff as a board....shocking! I sleep on a Heavenly system often, and found this to be an outlier.

No super flashy lights, no bumping music, minimal slot machine sounds and a super comfy bed. Parking and checking in is a breeze because it's so small and the room is a decent size. Iv'e stayed in many casinos and places like New York New York and Paris felt like shoeboxes for more money so no complaints here.

Room - double queen beds - clean and great view. We stayed for almost a whole week, the staff was great about restocking towels, making beds and what you would expect from a hotel chain.

No problems with the room or service - everything was great. For how close the Westin is (2 blocks) from the Bellagio and the main strip, this is definitely a great option for budget friendly people. We never stayed in the room much so we really felt like over all experience was positive.

The restaurant downstairs was a great place to eat. We ate there twice. It's not a crowded place, so you can get seated promptly. Once after we checked in in the morning. The breakfast was great. The server gave us a carafe of coffee so we didn't have to keep asking for refills. 

Then we went there for dinner. When we sat down, we told the waiter that we had 1 hour to eat before we had to leave. So he told us what we can order that he can get out quickly. All the food was really good. One girl still raves about the steak 4 months later... 

Another favorite amenity is the hot tub. It's not a often used place, maybe it was the time of year.. but it was a great place to go soak after a day of shopping. 

Overall, I would stay again. But if you need a taxi, walk to one of the nearby larger hotels and get one there because there aren't many that come by that place.

Cons: its about a half mile walk to get to the strip, and there is currently construction along that path, so it can get annoying. Since it is not one of the major resorts (Paris/Caesars/etc.) food options are limited and you probably don't want to spend much time gambling at the hotel.

Our renovated room wasn't in great condition. Cracked and missing grout in the shower, lumps in the carpet. The attention to detail wasn't there.

One day, housekeeping cleaned our room, took the towels and didn't give us any new ones. Kind of a problem when you go to hop in the shower after your race... I didn't appreciate having to call downstairs at midnight to ask for this.

The toilet made a funny sound each time we flushed it (kinda sounded like a doorbell).

Wifi wasn't great in a room at the end of the hall... it dropped frequently.

I was given free breakfast as my amenity (platinum member of SPG)... which consisted of the buffet in the hotel restaurant. It was literally the exact same food all three days... no variation. Sometimes the eggs were overdone.

This hotel is the pit stop for flight attendants and everyone else in the flying business... Saw more then plenty of them coming on and out. The hotel is not bad but not great.

Tried calling for a taxi so we wouldn't have to wait and was told there were some available, when we get down in search for a taxi nothing apparently they think a limo is a taxi & we wouldn't refuse it. They were wrong. So we had to wait like 20minutes for a taxi that fit 5 w/o splitting us.

At first I thought maybe our room was smaller than some of the other hotels like Paris and the Monte Carlo, etc but after visiting our friends rooms I realized ours was the same size.

If you are picky about ""ritzy"" rooms, or looking to spend a lot of time in your hotel and want everything literally at your fingertips, this isn't the place to go. The casino and pool are small and there's nothing terribly ""Vegas"" about this hotel. No shops, only one restaurant, one bar... it's very small scale. 

For us, it was great. We just hung out at other hotels to get the kitschy Vegas experience but still had a comfortable nice room to come back to that was half the price of other hotels and within walking distance of lots of Vegas hotspots. I'd say if you are looking for an affordable nice room and willing to go out of your hotel to experience Vegas this is a great choice.

I couldn't help but notice because with the current state of the lobby, you have to walk THROUGH the checkin line to get to/from the elevators.

3893950,2015-01-02,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"My 5-star rating is not for unbeatable service like you'd normally think of for hotels, but rather an overall rating including convenience. Here's why...

1) Location. 
This may seem odd because it's not directly on the strip. It's one street back between Linq Lane and Koval (on Flamingo). But that's why I love it. Traffic on the strip is a nightmare, but easy on Koval. We came here for New Year's Eve, where the strip is shut down to traffic between 6pm-3am. We got to celebrate in the heart of the strip and easily walked back to our hotel in a few minutes without hassle. It's close enough to walk to restaurants like Mon Ami Gabi, but also conveniently across the street from cheap eats at the Bally's food court. Also, if you are in a North room, it has a gorgeous view of the High Roller.

2) It's a hotel that has a small casino, not a big casino that has rooms on top.
I've tried most of the big Vegas hotels, and I'm tired of the long awkward walk through the casino when you arrive and leave. Everyone's dressed up playing poker and I'm in ""comfy house attire for a long drive"". I have hat hair, am poorly balancing my luggage and pillow, and generally look like crap. Here, you come out of the parking garage and within steps the first thing you see is the hotel registration desk without first having to endure a quarter mile of stares and cigarette smoke. I don't gamble but like Vegas for other reasons, and it's nice to have a more regular hotel where my goal is to actually go to sleep.

3) Parking.
Easiest parking experience ever in Vegas - got one of the first 20 spots in the self-park structure every day and didn't have to walk far. It just doesn't seem that crowded here. This is in contrast to the mega garages where it can take 15-20 minutes to find a spot before your long walk in.

4) Workout gear for $5.
They rolled out a new program where you can borrow New Balance shoes and clothing for $5 for your entire stay, so you can pack lighter. This is great for me on future business trips, when I only have a suit and dress shoes, and therefore can never utilize the workout room. Also, you get to keep the socks, which sounds more hygienic and makes it a great value.

5) Service.
Although it wasn't unusually awesome, the staff I encountered seemed fine. I like the heavy blanket/comforter and the rainfall shower head.

Cons:

1) Wifi is okay but disconnects frequently and you have to refresh that one page on your phone browser to reset it.

2) Although the Starbucks downstairs is convenient, everything is twice as expensive as normal.

3) Something was weird with the heater and freezing air blowing out of the vent by the window.

Overall, we really enjoyed this Vegas hotel experience for the above reasons. Special note: When you book with SPG points, the resort fee is waived.",V6LCcnpxZ3LIkmHTQHfV6w,2,0,5,QlEfHcdPZ7WQB2kY67z3Aw

If, like me, you've spent the entire day in a casino ballroom filled with yelling, arguments, and general tomfoolery, the quiet, understated nature of the Westin will be right up  your alley. However, if you're coming to Las Vegas to get crazy with your besties and paint the town red, the Westin will not be your cup of tea. It's not far from anything, but it's also not right in the thick of it. 

The rooms are standard Westin fare, which means they're super comfortable and generic. The staff is super friendly, and were more than willing to go out of their way to help me get things taken care of. And, despite having a really small gaming area (both machines and tables, but not many of each), I found the dealers and cocktail waitresses to be skilled and engaging. I had a great time playing blackjack until too late in the evening, and it's always a good sign when you lose track of time in a casino (for your having fun level, not necessarily for your wallet).

I took my Lady out to Vegas for her 30th birthday. After check in which went ok, I always make a point of looking around the room to (sheets and towels etc) to make sure that everything is clean regardless of where I am sleeping. At first I discovered the carpet was not very clean and not the kind that you can ignore. It seemed like the cleaners have a habit of tossing the dirt behind the Cabinets in the room or simple not cleaning it. There were plastic bottles and a lot of filth (old coins,lint etc). I was not only disturbed but disgusted by the standards of cleanliness, after all this is the Westin, a Star Wood Hotel. I had been to '2 star' hotels that were way cleaner and better than this.

I really did not want to start changing rooms or looking for another hotel so I informed the staff at reception, and to my surprise one of the guest services attendants insinuated that i had made the place dirty myself!!? I figured she must have misunderstood me and let that slide. I reiterated myself and pointed out exactly where the dirt was then asked them clean it  immediately. ""We are going out to dinner and we expect it to be clean by the time we get back."" They acknowledged , apologized but clearly were NOT listening because when we returned they simply tidied up our room and given us extra water.  THE PLACE WAS STILL FILTHY!- (PICS INCLUDED)

This obviously infuriated us so we figured we would spend the night  and leave in the morning.

Somebody apparently is keeping an eye on things there and decided to whine to Yelp about it, and managed to get it removed. Kudos. But it does not change the fact that you mis-represent your room rates and include hidden fees. A shady business practice.

Today, I did a follow up to see if the Westin has cleaned up their act. Indeed not. First, I checked for availability for my upcoming stay...what do you know. There are rooms easily available in the middle of summer in Vegas. Then, because of my previous poor experience, I read the ""fine print"" about my potential reservation here...There it is: $11.50 ""Resort Fee"". Yep...it has gone down a few bucks, but it is still a load of crap. Simply an extra charge that is not assessed by any other Westin I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world...including those that are actual RESORTS.

When I checked out and checked my credit card statement it was $80 over what I was quoted.

Mind you i called Monday and spoke to a front desk lady and she said I'm sorry that happened call back between 8-4pm and speak with accounting and they will reimbursed you for that mishap.

4021146,2016-11-26,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Honestly, I am not impressed at all. I now live in Las Vegas and while my condo was getting work done I was experiencing pet friendly hotels. I called before hand to let the hotel know that the person paying would not be checking in with me. I told them to charge his card. I was told to bring a card with me for check in and they would use it to hold my reservation so I did. 

When I first arrived, I was greeted by a kind valet guy who was very personable and asking me about my kitties. He helped me by loading up a cart. My 2 cats are service animals and need to be with me however my kitties got put on the cart. I thought well maybe the cart would be Ok since I was walking next to them. Another guy took over and began pushing the cart and then pointed for me to get in line...yes....pointed. I told him my kitties were service animals and they can't leave my side as he rolled them away behind the counter. I was furious. I thought well maybe they will be safer back there away from the dogs and all the people. However, it's not good to pull animals away from their owners! 

The line was horrendous and the front desk staff moved at a very slow pace making the wait excruciating. I kept looking over at my kitties making sure they were safe in their pet carriers and they were. A gentleman in uniform, whom I later found out to be Spencer, kept checking on them while I argued with the front desk. I really appreciated Spencer especially since he was the only who showed that he cared with actions.  

Of course, when I arrived to check in and give them my reservation number they wanted to charge my card full price, about $600, for only 3 nights. I explained that they were suppose to only hold with my CC, per the conversation over the phone, or at the very least take a deposit. The guy at the desk didn't care nor did he want to help so I became even more infuriated. Him and I were not on the same page so I was asked to speak wth the manager and put in another line. Again, waiting to be with my kitties. These people are sloooooow so the lines here are an unnecessary torture. FINALLY, I made it to the manger and while I was explaining all the problems to her, she smirked. I had my friend on the phone wanting to talk to her about pay but she refused to talk to him and told me to giver her a CC. I explained that the guy on the phone was paying and they were only to use mine to have on file until my friend sent over the CC authorization. Again, she did not listen nor did she care insisting I need to pay with mine. Then she hands me a ""dog waiver"" to sign as a pet policy. What an idiot. First of all, I have cats and second they are service animals. I told her I wasn't signing a dog waiver nor was I suppose to be treated as if they were pets! She was now in violation of the ADA. I explained to her it was unlawful to charge me pet fees for a service animal. I then told her I wasn't signing any ""dog"" forms as that was ridiculous and she said that this was their policy, which again was a violation for an animal who provides a service for someone....ME. I wrote NO on their waiver, wrote that my cats were service animals and were not to be treated like pets, then I signed my name to that. Later I find out I was overcharged for my one night stay which I had to pay to shut them up. I reserved the room for $167.47/night including taxes and all hotel fees online. However, when I saw my bank statement I noticed I was charged over $187 because of the so called ""manager"". This was by far the worst welcoming experience I have gone through for a hotel and they should apologize for hurting someone like that. They should also read up on the laws. I will be filing a complaint against their acts with ADA, HUD and FHA. 

Moreover, after I walked away I asked Spencer to bring my cats. Spencer was kind to walk with me and keep my cats close as we looked for my room. Spencer was very kind and went out of his way to make me feel welcome, however I was too upset, already unwelcome and just wanted to be alone. He was the only person who gave a damn at this place! 

On another note, I have been trying to adjust the thermostat since I've been here and it won't go up past 72 degrees which is cold for me. I'm disappointed with this place and for the price of the hotel they should be more accommodating! I will dispute the charges tomorrow and I will be checking out. I reserved a room for 3 nights but after the horrible ordeal I went through, there is no way I am giving these people any more money. Further more, the greedy staff thinks it's OK to over charge and then try to charge more for a pet fee even though I didn't have ""pets"". 

I will not be back. My recommendation for people would be to find somewhere else especially if you have any emotional support animals/service animals! The 2 stars are for Spencer and for the valet guy.",DG6ub7Z5-xX1JuYK-HPLiQ,1,0,2,NvfExcqzds4P9-JWhe2K6g

This hotel is 2 long blocks back of the strip just behind the Flamingo and Ballys.  There is almost always a limo for hire out front ( cheap, cheap) and taxis to ferry you where ever you want to go.  We had two adjoining rooms with the Heavenly Beds ( awesome to crash in after a night of partying!) and Heavenly baths, luxury robes and accommodations.
Oh and its a pet friendly, non smoking place - nice reprieve from the smoke filled mega casinos.
Upon check in look for Grace or Matt both awesome!

Look for Donnell - he is such a nice man!  He even brought flowers and a card to our birthday girl out at the pool!  Totally made our stay!

Yes the casino is small - so if you want a huge casino floor to lose your money on (or to triple it) seek that out somewhere else.

The pool - its small but more than adequate.  They have 6 cabanas for rent in the spa at $100 a pop - very reasonable for Vegas.  Plenty of nicely padded chairs around the pool and hot tub.  Did I mention pool is open til 2am?!  If you're drinking get the Royal flush - Jack and Ananuf(from Brazil)  make an awesome team and were over the top attentive to us.

For eats in the hotel - we dined at Suede for breakfast - good food, affordable and Steven was great!

The Spa - pricey - over priced.  I consider myself a spa brat - I spa just about everywhere I go.  $60 for a quick pedicure is awful and it wasn't even that great - A full on pedicure is $100 - no thank you.  Massage was good but at $120 it should have been.  The staff in the spa were top notch.

The only reason I didn't award the final star was the elevator service.  They state that they are working on it and there are signs to let you know there will be delays.  Its just frustrating - when you are ready to go - you are ready - ya know?!  We never waited more than 10 mins but its just a wait that should not have happened.  Of the  6 or so elevators only 2 or 3 were working at a time.  Many times we pressed 2 to get to the pool but ended up on 1.

Come on its Vegas how many elevators are there?!  Why can't yours get serviced but everyone else's can?!

It is very important to remember that this hasn't always been a Westin. Westin did not build this hotel, this building used to house the Maxim hotel back in the day.

I stayed 4 nights in a deluxe king room on the 15th floor. I chose to stay here because I was in town on business and have Platinum Preferred status with Starwood.

 It was decent. Smaller than other Westin rooms I have stayed in, but with all of the Westin elements I have come to enjoy, like the Heavenly Bed. Everything was pretty standard Westin, including a room service menu identical to every other Westin I have stayed at recently. The consistency between properties is probably something that should be admired, actually. They have a parking lot right in front of the hotel, which was a very convenient. 

My gripe is the casino. I got back to the hotel at 11pm one night and was looking to play some craps. Well guess that, the craps table was already shut down for the night. Are you kidding? It's before midnight in Las Vegas and you're shutting down before the rest of the town is getting started? The casino was depressingly small and empty most of the time, so I understand if they do this based on demand. But, be warned if you're staying here and planning to gamble here on something other than a slot machine, you will be disappointed. 

The staff members I interacted with were all very courteous, the craps dealers were fun and friendly as was one blackjack dealer I interacted with, a man curiously named ""Heather.""  

Overall it was a good experience. Stay here for the points, the bed, or the brand, but definitely not for the casino.",jHlM64I_gTdaQ5Ap0jxdqQ,3,0,3,S4uFJhGmGBa4m_WEO8TacA

The daily happy hour was eliminated. It's no longer a quiet hotel as they have a different clientele (they went from serving airline pilots and stewardesses to serving families with small children). My stay over the 4th of July weekend 2017 was inexcusable and travelers need to know. I brought a newly rescued puppy with me on the trip as they allow pets in the room for a fee. My puppy found a used razorblade and had it in her mouth. I called the front desk and was transferred to the Manager of the Day; on that day, it was Myra. She let me speak first. Then she said - I see in our records that you complained about noise last year. I was floored by her insensitivity. My complaint about noise in the past does not excuse how dirty the room was and my puppy could have died had she swallowed the used razor blade. She gave me 6,000 points.

I loved the location of the hotel because you weren't far away from the strip, but you were definitely in a quieter space than the other casinos along the strip. They do have self parking and valet.

It was not quite up to the level of some other Westins we've stayed at but it was decent enough. It could maybe use a remodel or maybe just some sprucing up? It was a little rough around the edges, I guess. Like for example, the bathroom didn't have the heavenly shower. And the wallpaper was coming off in one place. Not a big deal but just different from other Westins. 

On a positive side the bed was comfortable and the hotel was quiet. We never heard other guests which was awesome - especially to find that in Vegas! They also gave us a late check out for free, which was really great since our plane didn't leave until later in the day.

I think Westin & SPG should really consider making the entire facility smoke free - The Westin & Starwood brands cater to families, fitness, & business; not the typical Las Vegas visitor.

Research by the hubs revealed the Westin adds on a $15+ ""resort fee"" in addition to the Priceline price.  Damn, since I had given away my $35/night hotel ON the strip @ Imperial Palace to upgrade to a 4-star ""south strip"" hotel -- I should have looked a little harder on Priceline's listing of what constitutes strip.  But since the rooms, on the Westin website, were registering at $299, I thought it was a super steal.

I'll definitely say that I was pleasantly surprised -- smaller in scale than I expected, but posh decor.  Small casino downstairs, but it had just about all that we needed for our first night when we're exhausted from traveling but want a little Vegas action (video poker + slots, a blackjack video machine with the video dealers, and a similar 4-card poker machine -- boo on that one though, I lost :P).  

That pool though -- damn. In not a good way.  I can see how they tried, and maybe points for effort, but it was basically rates a 6 for a rooftop pool w/ faux greenery and lots of rocks.  Ten minute walk to the strip isn't too awful -- it's down the street from Bill's Gambling Hall + Half Price Tix, so that was nice!

Disclosure: I'm staying here because the hotel I usually stay at was not available and it was close to my conference venue. 

The hotel definitely needs updating. The room is spacious though it's decor could use a huge facelift. My room seems dingy although not obviously unclean. If you're going to do white linens, they should ALWAYS be WHITE. Not off white. When the stains won't come out, it's time to replace them. And their HVAC could probably use some repair. My room feels like someone just took a shower every time I walk through the door. 

Mostly, it's pretty standard as far as hotels rooms go. There's no ""wow"" whatsoever. Even the lobby is underwhelming for an off-the-strip hotel. It's Vegas. Everything should pop!

They do have a 24 hr Starbucks and a spa which is nice. Hopefully, I'll get to check them out later. 

The worst part is probably the loiterers out in front of the hotel parking lot. I'm familiar with East of the strip on Flamingo so I'm not taken aback or anything. (Although, the city worker peeing by the bus stop was new.) It's just bad for business to have people basically living on the sidewalk near your parking lot 24/7. As a guest and a woman, I don't feel safe. Regardless, of whether anyone would actually do me harm. The impression is that something seedy could happen to me outside the WESTIN, like possibly being flashed by a perv. That's not acceptable. 

The staff seems nice enough. I did place a call to the concierge last night and was places on hold for several minutes, after which I hung up. But that's about the most in terms of interaction I've had with them. 

Overall, with good earnest facelift, this could be something. Right now, I wouldn't stay here again when I'm in town, nor would I recommend it to anyone. 

I give it two stars. It's close to the strip and the rooms aren't horrible. I'll update this review again when my trip is over to keep it honest. Maybe I'll have more good reports.",llFzJj1AogSGeSCeXsdAag,2,0,2,2Hv4BLHEfW9OzMnObsgqDA

From the window of our hotel we could watch the shady goings on at the little apartment complex next door.  There were people milling about all hours of the night.  I guess the air conditioner window units in their apartments were no match for the 114 degree Vegas heat, and they'd rather be outside socializing.

The pool was tiny, and the hot tub had to be free of germs (hopefully) since it was nearly full strength chlorine water!

Luckily the hotel was just a short walk to the Atomic Testing Museum.  Honestly, this was the highlight of the trip!  Vegas is a huge, compact version of what Orlando would become if gambling was legalized within the city limits.

I will say that the ""heavenly bed"" was indeed heavenly.  I think they provided 10 pillows or some crazy number like that.

One word of caution - if you have even remotely sensitive skin - DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT use the hand lotion that they provide in the rooms.  I loved the sage aroma of the other toiletries, but the contact dermatitis caused by the lotion was more than I was counting on.

I can't say that I'd recommend this hotel for the price, but like I said - it was a business trip and I was getting reimbursed when all was said and done.  I picked the hotel for the no-smoking in the rooms & the fact that there was a Starbucks in the lobby.",xBvaQwMU9Gsh3SYBa6CTWQ,0,0,4,8BZZI1j0GWBl57aoelMpXA
4184795,2012-03-11,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I stayed at this hotel during the first weekend of March. I have heard that new management team took over earlier this year and its gearing towards the positive direction. Here are my summaries of stay

Pros:
1. Turns down are back. Its good to have a clean room when you are back to your room at night.
2. Flat Screen TV is finally here. But HD channels are still missing
3. Attractive Weekend rate and ability to earn starwood points and enjoy elite benefits.
4. Ease to walk to the room from parking lot when comparing to mega hotels.

Cons:
1. Internet did not work during my stay. I tried to contact the tech support but still did not work. Both of my friends' PC and Mac was not able to connect to their wifi so its not our computer's problem for sure.
2. The cut back of their ""social hour"" (it used to be 2 hours but now to 1 hour). One of my biggest pet peeve is that they not just reduced in terms of food offering. They used to be at the room inside the Suade restaurant which was quite relaxing and able to enjoy the drinks an snacks but now its just a big bowl of salsa chips and located between the hallway to the spa and pool.
3. Inside their spa they used to offer bottled water and juices too, but its all gone.
4. I wish they can spend some time to ask engineers to clean the lents inside their bathroom and also the pipes for drainage. Good maintenance can keep the room lasts longer since there is no known room renovation plan announced yet. I was surprised to see how long it took for waters to drain down the pipe. Its embarrassing.

I hope the hotel can seriously improve on the offering along with other issues so I will be more likely to return to this property and be my choice of hotel whenever visiting Vegas.",O8M-LETl8rMBPwr9E8HxXg,1,0,3,GWirp3olR3d37r9FZM1HRA

4239615,2015-08-04,3,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"This place is an undervalued gem of a hotel for the following reasons:

-Check-in is a breeze.  

There's a handful of desk people, but it's only for a handful of customers.  Their clientele is varied too; it's not just your run-of-the-mill tourist.  Sitting at the bar, I noticed a huge contingent of their customer base is comprised of airline pilots and flight attendants.  Those people check in during off-peak hours, meaning less lines for you as a tourist..  

Another group of people that come through here are merchants/salespeople/business people.  I happened to see a Shark Tank winner check-in!  Cool huh?!

In contrast, If you've ever stayed at a behemoth like the MGM Grand before, it's like going through airport security again.  

-It's quiet.

Yes, you might want to be near all the party action at the Wynn or the Cosmo, but don't you eventually want to go to bed?  Don't you not want to see half-naked drunk people stumbling through your hotel lobby? 

-The casino is an afterthought. 

In case you feel like those other hotels' casinos are as complicated and maze-like as labyrinths, the Westin's casino is a tiny strip of real estate in the hotel.  I'm surprised people even go there to gamble.  Don't you want to gamble somewhere cooler than the Westin?  Maybe not.  Hard for me to say since I'm not a gambler.

-The location is ideal.

It's just off the strip, but you can very easily walk there.  It's not like the Orleans Hotel where you have to pay for a shuttle to get onto the strip.  And it's not in the middle of all the chaos, so you can get away from the madness when you want to.

-The rooms are spacious, clean, and updated.

The rooms look like the magazine-quality pictures.

-Reasonably priced.

It's appropriately priced; it doesn't have a gimmicky Las Vegas image to maintain.  You can visit those hotels instead. :)

4241909,2011-08-13,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Outside of Las Vegas, this would be a solid 3 or 4 star hotel.  However, in Las Vegas, there's a lot of competition, and the Westin just doesn't live up -- the only reason I stay there is Starwood Preferred Guest, and even that is a tenuous benefit.

The rooms are pretty small for Las Vegas -- approximately 1970s hotel standard globally -- and while well furnished, pretty boring.  CRT TV (I haven't seen one of these in years!), limited additional facilities.  As a plus, there is wired and wireless internet, although for non-platinums, the price is pretty extortionate, as usual.

One major negative for platinums is that there are only 4 suites in the property, so no upgrades.

A big plus is that it's smoke free (I believe, still), unlike the rest of Las Vegas.

Still, I'd stay somewhere else (Venetian, Wynn, etc.), if I wanted a Vegasy experience, or at the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental if I wanted a non-Vegas experience.",pEvhyxL7YAGrYsKB29VJvg,0,1,2,AmYzw8VZFQBg7BgX4Qq3MA

First the linens. Wow. I have only ever gotten my own bedding from the clearance bin at those cheap department stores, because what possible difference could thread count make? All the difference in the world it turns out. Slept like a rock and felt so refreshed the next morning.

I appreciated that they provide ashtrays near the entrances. I know it's impolitic to be a smoker but customer service isn't about politics.

Also like that they are off the strip but within walking distance. I went and played, saw a show, didn't need a cab to get back, and once safely ensconced in my room could not hear or see the pandemonium a block away.

I had the buffet breakfast on my way out. It was good but a little spendy.

Our room was upgraded as we were SPG members so we had a lovely view of the High Roller Ferris wheel. The room was clean and larger compared to the average hotel room. We checked in a couple hours early with no problem, but we did notice quite a line-up at actual check in time later that afternoon. 

The gym, pool and spa were all lovely and clean. The pool is outside which was fantastic. They had whisky tasting and desserts offered daily which was a nice touch (? This may have just been for SPG members). NOTE - they do not do the free happy hour at the pool area as other reviews have previously mentioned. They have lovely water in the reception area that changed every day - oranges, lemon, cucumber. Please drink it, it's the desert! Another thing I really liked was the eco program, where you could opt out of daily fresh linens and towels to save on energy and in return you get SPG points or money back at selected restaurants. 

Overall, this is a clean, less busy and quiet hotel that is off the strip. Be prepared for a short walk (10-15min) to the strip - for us it was no problem at all. If you want to be right in the action, then stay on the strip. And yes, there are resort fees so don't be surprised when selecting to stay here.

This is a GREAT location in Vegas - far enough away from the hot messes directly on the strip, and the accompanying noise - but close enough to easily walk to it. This feels as close to a ""business"" hotel in Vegas as I've experienced, but it's still Vegas. This place wasn't overrun with screaming children, strollers, or people who'd had too many cocktails. It felt like the perfect balance: some slots, card games, tables, food, Starbucks - all inside the ground floor of the hotel; a great pool with plenty of places to lay out and enjoy the hot Vegas sun; very sharp, clean, comfy rooms with wonderful beds; LOTS to see and do nearby.

We were offered a free extended check out time and that they would send us a text message once our room was ready.

Too good to be true, they did hand us one complimentary cocktail voucher for our stay (we had two people for the room, but who's counting?) valid in between the hours of 5-7pm. We were informed that the Strip is pretty close to the strip so the hotel does not provide a shuttle. Yeah, the Strip is in walking distance but we opted to drive anyways.

There was also a complimentary fridge in the room free of charge to use. Awesome. But, we ended up not even using it as it was either not working or the temperature was set to a very low setting. No option to change that.  The cleaning crew also slipped a $5 voucher to use for our stay since we opted out on the cleaning service. I attempted to redeem in at Starbucks  located inside the hotel and was told it wasn't valid for use there and was directed to use it at the gift shop.

A few points of note: They do a decent job of making compact fluorescent room lamps blend in nicely with the decor--the rooms don't seem as harshly lit as most. Like many Westins, the bathrooms in the guest rooms are very attractive. They're well designed, appointed, and stocked. And this may be the only hotel I've visited in Vegas that actually puts a coffee pot in your room--no forced run to the lobby Starbucks (which of course it has) for coffee in the morning. They also have a computer in the lobby that you can use--at no cost--for printing (boarding passes, etc.).

Now the bad: For a hotel that likely gets a lot of business travelers, there's not one outlet in the room that's easily accessible without crawling on the floor. Nowadays people need a place to charge their mobile devices. How about a desk or lamp outlet SOMEWHERE...? Also, they tack an additional ""services"" fee on your bill for each night of your stay, and on top of that, the fee itself is taxed. A sign in the lobby explains that this is for the amenities [you'd expect at a hotel like this], including the pool/spa, etc. I call bulls***. It's a cost of doing business, and it should be included in the room price, not hidden in a surprise line item that's tacked onto your bill. Reminded me of my phone bill with all of the fees the carriers don't want to include in their price.

And finally: The major drawback to this hotel is its location. It's not too far from the Strip, but it requires some walking. If you use the monorail to get around Vegas (and if you don't, WHY don't you?), the signage and announcements indicate that the Flamingo stop is closest to the Westin. They lie. It's not. The Flamingo station may be physically located closest to this hotel, but you must walk all the way out and through the Flamingo casino, to the Strip, to get out--all in the opposite direction from the hotel. Lesson: The Bally's stop is really the closest. Get off at Bally's, walk through the shopping arcade, and exit at the sports book.

I like this place.  It's low key.  It's not a smoke free casino area but I'll take it over the other ones because my sinuses and lungs hate me right now and this place is a little kinder to me.

My liver still likes me, it just feels like it's at an elite event.  I'm a light weight so I'm good with a drink or two.

I'm not into gambling but when I'm with my father in law I have a tendency to play.  Like folks who say they only smoke on social occasions.  I joined their player's club membership there was a special for slot play and table play for first time members.  

I played black Jack for the first time and was dealt two aces.  Hmmm. Do I split or just hit.  I split and won my first hand. Sweet. 

It's a clean casino.  Starbucks is located in their hotel so it's good know a cup of Joe is available for me.

It's a small casino but the slot machines they have are pretty new like the ones in the bigger casinos.  Cocktail service is slow in making their rounds but once you've established your booty in one of their seats the ladies do end up coming around.

What caught my attention was the big dogs with their owners roaming the hotel with their owners. YES! They're pet friendly!  And not only are they pet friendly they allow the bigger dogs in comparison to other hotels that have a weight limit.

I typically stay in Vegas Hotels anywhere on the Strip and I've been given a room at any time of the day.  Total Fail Westin!!!

I asked If there was a possibility of getting in earlier and I was told yes to come back at 4pm.  That doesn't seem any earlier then the first time I was quoted.  Good Customer Service...oh yeah this is after I gave her my Starwood Number. 

Checked my bag with Bellman and figured I would go to pool.  Door was locked and I needed a key. I went back to front desk and spoke with Sweden (yes that is her name) again and she told me I couldn't access the pool because I would need a key (yeah I figured that out 10 minutes ago). Her solution was to write me a spa pass to take a shower.  I asked her if that spa pass would get me into the pool and she said no. Really?  I'm trying to check in and have 7 hours to kill...can i please get a pool pass? Nope!!!! Failing again!!!

Sweden went by the book. Several others in our party made comments to me about her.  It was a little humorous. 

So I did what I should have just done in the first place...stalk a nice family going to the pool and just walk in with them. It was so cute the little girl even held the door for me.  I said, ""Thank you!"" and I was flashed a big smile.  
So I'm at the pool enjoying a little 50 degree weather with some sun. Only 5 more hours to go.  On side note: There is a couple in the hot tub who might be getting it on...cross that hot tub of my list this week.  I can tell 
already It is going to be a long trip and I'm not even checked in yet!!

At 4pm my room was still not ready. I finally talked to guy at the VIP desk. He told me that it was ridiculous that my room wasn't ready and that I had been waiting all of this time. He worked the computer and was able to find me another room.  Finally someone at the Westin cared. 

There were other problems too. My dry cleaning was never delivered to my room even though I paid $2 for delivery. I had to search for it at 7pm and it was no where to be found. I figured the bellboy would find it but when I returned to my room later it was still not there. I called down and was a little upset.  My dry-cleaning arrived at 1:45am...thanks...I don't need sleep. 

One day the maid threw away my newspapers (neatly stacked on my desk) and moved all of my toiletries.  That is so gross and uncalled for.  She put my razor and toothpaste in with my toothbrush. Please don't touch my bathroom stuff.  Every few years i run into a maid who does this and I just hate it. 

Upon check-out the two door guys were total jerks.  I needed a taxi to the airport and they told me that there were no taxis available. They did have a 30 dollar town car I could take to the airport. Wow!!! Not my first trip to Vegas. I told the guy if he wasn't going to help me I was just going to take the Monorail to the MGM and get a taxi there. All of sudden they changed there tune and I had a cab in 10 seconds.  Then the second guy started making small talk with me because he knew there limo scam did not work. It just made me more upset!

This hotel did have some good moments but it is sad how a few bad moments can ruin everything. 

The Heavenly Bed is amazing and the Workout room was great!!!

Daniel at the Happy Hour is one of the hardest working guys ever. Westin should be proud to have an incredible employee like him (he deserves 5 stars)!

I won this off Priceline by accident for $150 total. I was in Vegas for a quick trip to see a concert on a Friday night and leaving Saturday morning. That Thursday I decided to map this place on Google and when I typed in the name it automatically brought up reviews and the overall ranking was two stars and most reviews opened with ,""I unfortunately won this off Priceline..."" and then continued to rip this place apart. I tried getting credit for this and booking another hotel, but Priceline wouldn't budge despite the horrible reviews.

THE REAL DEAL:

IT's right off the strip on Flamingo walking distance from Paris and Planet Hollywood and it has a Starbucks in it. When I pulled up to valet, the attendant told me to pull forward toward the guy with the handkerchief. There was an Asian man wearing jeans, a plaid shirt tucked in, and a white handkerchief  around his face like he was going to rob a bank in the Wild, Wild west. When I got in the staff at the front desk were all dressed like cowboys and cowgirls. I asked why and they said the Rodeo was in town for two days. I thought that was cool that the whole hotel participated in this and made the guests from the Rodeo feel welcome. I went to my room and surprisingly liked it. The decor was modern and decent for the price I paid and the bed was big and spacious, although it did look like they didn't change the sheets. The carpet was dirty and I could tell that they're not really doing upkeep on minor things like shampooing the carpet and painting things here and there, but if they did a good clean up then this place would be 4 stars. 

My only complaint is that the location (even though it's literally RIGHT OFF THE STRIP) is dangerous. I did encounter a  homeless lady that was harassing me and followed me for a whole block while I walked to Sephora. I wasn't phased by her since I've dealt with bums from L.A, but she was a bit scary and annoying. 

I'd stay here for a quick turn-around trip, and I can tell you it is better than the Tropicana. If you're looking for luxury, and you're staying for a few days don't stay here unless you're trying to save money, you don't care about the hotel room since you'll be partying anyway. Ah! I forgot to mention they have free wine and beer from 6 - 8 p.m on the second floor, so maybe it's worth your while to stay here.",QwZaQ_G_AYArFE9G9oMPMQ,0,0,4,u3j1iady4dRQQawWB3FgKg

This Westin can't make up its mind between being a business hotel and a Vegas hotel. It has a very small casino, with 1 crap table, a few table games, and some slots, but virtually nobody playing. The crap table never opened. 

And the rooms are small and very much business like, versus Vegas like in size, decor and style. 

And although Westin has only owned this porperty for less than 6 years, it is already showing age around the edges, losing any freshness or swank it might have had at opening. It just doesn't have a crisp feel like many other Westins in major cities have. 

And right now, the city is doing major construction work on this section of Flamingo Road, so getting in and out of here is a hassle. 

If you want a business hotel in Vegas, I suggest you try Embassy Suites on Paradise. And if you want a more resort like hotel that is reasonable, try the Hilton Grand Vacation properties (there are 3 in Vegas). EIther can be had for under $150. OR get those internet deals from the major Casino Hotels, which are offering some great deals. Like the Venetian mid-week for $69, or many others for under $100.

At least I got 1 day of starpoints to add to my Starwood SPG account.",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,6,4,2,nCZ_Iw8pX5XrzM-Ldqfw5Q
4341743,2014-10-09,5,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Good destination hotel used by frequent travelers to Las Vegas, which actually could be a great little hotel...if they just put a tiny bit more effort into it.

I recently stayed here for $150 / night for two nights... just me so I was paying not quite an arm and a leg, but definitely an arm!  And since I'm not working at the moment I don't really have money to burn.  But it was supposed to be worth it because this hotel allows pets and I wanted to have my dog with me, since he was just boarded for 5 nights the week before.  Poor guy!

Lobby is nice but smallish because most of it is taken away for the casino inside, which is known as Max Casino (see below).  The restaurant I didn't really eat there but it's supposed to be decent and fairly priced, but it's the only choice although there's more food poolside.  Bar is basically a standard square bar with TVs adjacent to the casino.  You can sometimes get a free breakfast for 2 in their restaurant thrown in if you book through Yelp or know how to otherwise reserve this deal on their website.  There's also a Starbucks inside the hotel, but they don't have a full selection of food items and the prices are marked up an extra 50% like other Starbucks inside Vegas hotels (Planet Hollywood for example).

This hotel is not really for kids, they basically cater to adults and I couldn't really see any reason to stay here if you have kids.. but wait that's pretty much Vegas especially the strip.

Pluses: 
Free business center for printing event and concert tickets, send quick emails etc.
No smoking in the hotel itself!   Nice.  Only one in Vegas they claim.
Allow pets for only $35 cleaning fee at the end.
Casino is a well kept secret especially enjoyed the inexpensive table games during ""happy hour"".   Nice dealers when I stayed (got to try them all).
Rooftop pool is a low-key (not too loud) luxury touch with skyline view. Another well kept secret of Vegas.
Excellent TV in room and free Wifi in lobby and rooms, rare on the Strip.  
Location is great, walking distance or a short drive to many places and the monorail / Linq giant wheel, though there are some vagrants wandering around nearby, but police are onto them.
Free parking indoor/outdoor which is a very short walk compared to most.
Sports book inside this casino, so you don't have to go far to place a couple wagers.
Free use of robes in the room, and gym in hotel is free too. For $5 you can rent New Balance workout gear with your stay delivered to your room.  I didn't have time to try the workout unfortunately, but seemed decent.

Minuses:  
Smoking allowed in the casino, which is not entirely separate from the hotel.
Horrible check in experience.  Room was not even close to ready on time.  Never did get the King Bed that I'd reserved / paid for.  Had to settle for twin beds.
Customer service pretty poor.  They only go out of their way to accommodate airline staff and routinely ignore others.  Much better experience at Westin Lake LV.
Doggy walk area is a tiny putting green of astroturf next to parking garage.  Sob.
Bathroom was shabby and wallpaper peeling, but shower was nice.
Rooms are pretty small / standard hotel type room unless you upgrade to an executive suite.  The minor upgrade isn't any bigger.


I filled out two customer surveys about my experience and really hoped they'd get back to me and apologize or do something to make it better, especially since I responded to the GM personally by email but didn't hear back.  They did give me 1000 Westin points (supposedly, haven't seen them yet) when I checked in but until they're in my account I'm going to keep complaining.  Not sure I'd go back until I get some type of helpful response.",lT8GMwid9h0hShr7lDroIg,6,4,3,UzKYfy0rOThecRCijM1-Xw

4351400,2009-06-15,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I hate to give a Westin property anything less than 4 stars, but here is a first.  I arrived late and check in was easy.  I went directly to my room since I had an early breakfast meeting the next morning. My room was clean and I unpacked before brushing my teeth and hitting the ""heavenly"" bed that I enjoy.  

Here was my complaint.  while brushing my teeth I felt a cold tingle on my feet.  I discovered as the water poured out from under the sink that my feet were getting the early splash ( Warning) that something was wrong.  I stopped the water to see that the pipes were disconnected?  Since they were metal pipes this was deliberate by whoever stayed in the room last.  I was too tired to change rooms so I mopped up the water with a few towels ( leaving one for the morning shower) and put the pipes back together as best I could so that I could use the sink to finish brushing and in the morning. I also wedged one of the towels under the pipe so that it would stay together.  It didn't dawn on me until later as to how the cleaning crew wiped up the sink without figuring this one out??

When I got up I showered and used the sink before leaving for my meeting.  I stopped at the front desk to let them know the issue.   They said that they would send up maintenance while I was out.  I went to my meetings and returned to see that Maintenance had been there and really did nothing on top of what I did.  Oh, except move the towel out to the middle of the floor and replace it with a clean wash cloth from on top of the counter.  What service, wow!  This made me upset since you would have thought that they would have scheduled the room to be cleaned right after the maintenance man visited.  No I came back to a dirty room that was a little worse.  Yes the story gets better.  Vegas is hot in the summer and I had walked back from another hotel that early afternoon and needed to wash my face.  Now that the maintenance had used one of the wash clothes for the pipes I only had one left.  I picked it up to see that it was not very clean.  To say the least I am disappointed in this property.

Some good to finish, the staff was helpful ( Front desk) and the price is right ( $119) for a Westin. I would stay here again.",3bv0Ige66kvSB8hkMiGfvA,3,0,3,3iOg-a3kppW40D9BKkk1nA

My girlfriends and I were able to get a good deal on a room here when we decided to take a last minute trip for Halloween weekend, and at first we were concerned that it was too out of the way. But actually it's JUST around the corner from the action, which was convenient and actually really nice to be a bit removed from the craziness when we wanted to be. 

The rooms were perfectly clean and similar to other Westins I've seen, with a spacious bathroom and those wonderful Heavenly beds. We took advantage of the spa, where you can use the sauna and steam room for free as a guest, and ate at the Suede restaurant downstairs, which I was really impressed by (review to come later). We also of course had to use the late night room service after a full night of partying, and it came super quickly and with a smile.

4 NIGHTS = $99 per night (during a busy convention week - Wed to Sun)
Daily Resort Fee = $9.50

The best perk of this hotel is their daily Happy Hour / Mixer event.  It is FREE and all guests are welcome to attend.  What's included: Appetizers, Beer, Wine, Water, and Soda.  The cheese platter & fruits were my favorites.  The second best perk is the Starbucks located inside the hotel.

The room was spacious, clean, and surprisingly looked much nicer than more expensive hotels on the strip. (ie. Paris, Luxor, Monte Carlo, etc.)

The location is convenient for those who want to stay very close to the strip but away from the hustle & bustle. However, the cabs were lacking.  You have a better shot flagging a cab at Bally's. (across the street)

Our flight into Vegas was severely delayed so we ended up arriving around 2am.  Worried that they wouldn't let us check in at that hour, we called the front desk to make sure that our reservation still stood.  The first lady we spoke to was rude and told us that we'd be forfeiting our reservation entirely if we arrived that late and that there was absolutely nothing she could do about it.  Not believing that that was the case, we called back later and spoke with a much friendlier gentleman who informed us that we would be fine and he would be awaiting our arrival.

When we arrived the man was there and he went above and beyond by upgrading our room with a nice view and setting us up for a later checkout on Sunday afternoon.

Pros:
- Clean rooms
- Free early evening happy hour with beer, wine and tacos
- comfortable beds
- well-priced
- the receptionist who made up for the rude receptionist's lack of effort
- polite valet crew who made getting cabs easy

Cons:
- water pressure in the shower was lacking
- the lady at the front desk who told us our reservation had been cancelled and made no effort to accommodate us
- wifi connectivity in the room was sketchy at best
- our TV kept cutting off making for an unwatchable experience


While the location of the Westin is not very far off the strip at all, if you come here during the summer thinking that you're just gonna comfortably  walk from the Westin to let's say the Venetian or even the more closely located Bally's, you're kidding yourself because the dry dessert heat is far too oppressive to make either trek comfortably.  When the weather is a little bit cooler I suppose walks of such a short distance are much more bearable.  So just something to keep in mind there if you're planning to walk to other hotels.

The Westin is located about a block and a half off the strip.  The great thing about this hotel is that it's a lot less hectic and crazy as the hotels on the strip. It's nice to be able to walk downstairs to the lobby and not have a horrendous amount of drunk people running around.  

The rooms here are pretty nice with the Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bathroom items.  This is my second time staying in a Westin, and I loveeee the Heavenly Bed and shower head.  The rooms are also spacious, compared to the other hotels on the strip. Regarding the hotel rooms, I have no complaints at all.

The only complaints I have was the service that I got while I was staying here. When I checked in, the front desk agent wasn't very friendly and didn't execute check-in procedures very well. Also, there was one day during our stay where there was not hot water in the room. I called down to let the front desk know, and they said they would have it taken care of. After 30 minutes, there was still no hot water, so I called down and the front desk agent said someone would be sent up to the room to check it out.  After ANOTHER 30 minutes, no one showed up AND there was still no hot water, so I called back down... this time, the same front desk agent answered and told me ""It's only been 5 minutes since the last time you called, and we only have one maintenance guy on duty... just wait"" and hung up... she said all of this in a really rude tone.  after waiting around for an hour and a half, I decided to drive 20 minutes out of the strip to one of my aunt's house and shower. thank god i have family in town, or else i wouldn't have been able to shower and get to where i needed to be at a certain time.  then later that night, i found out from the bartender that the entire hotel didn't have hot water... if they front desk agent had just told me that and apologized, it would have been a lot better than telling me someone would fix it right away, and not. 

the one good service i got was from the valet though.. the bellboys and valet staff at this Westin are excellent. throughout my entire stay, they were all very prompty, and very friendly getting my car in and out, and also getting taxis. 

as far as the rest of the hotel, it's pretty small compared to the rest of the strip. so if you're looking for somewhere more chill to stay, i would recommend staying here.  it's really nice being somewhere a bit more quiet after all the partying and staying up.  there is also a restaurant on site called Suede, which is very good, but pricey.  there is also a pool at the Westin with beach chairs, cabanas for rent, and also a bar. 

last but not least, everyday from 5:30PM-7:30PM, Westin has the unwind program... basically between those two hours, there is complimentary wine/beer/sodas and snacks for all hotel guests. 

overall, i actually enjoyed my stay here a lot. i liked the facility a lot, but their service needs improvement.

It earned 5 big stars for their beautiful rooms, smoke free casino, restaurants, and Starwood Preferred guests lounge. We really LOVED out short stay here while on a business trip last July. 

My disappointments are with certain staff members and their cowardly hotel manager! I planned to surprise my GF with roses in our room upon arrival. I even called ahead of time to make sure the front desk /guest services would accept, sign, and delivery my FTD flowers to our room. 

At check out time, I kept calling downstairs to see what happened to the missing flowers. I had to pay $11.95 for internet access to find tracking on the FTD site. After speaking to a FTD customer service rep, they said it was delivered as promised. WTH? 

After we flew back home to CA, I immediately researched more. I wanted to see where my $80+ actually disappeared to! FTD gave me the name of the person who signed for it at the hotel. It was a lady in housekeeping. She NEVER gave it the front/ concierge desk. It remained there after we checked out. 

OK, I'm pissed, but having personal experience working in the hospitality & hotel industry, I know this could be fixed. Far from it! I continually called the hotel. I kept getting the run around and kept getting transferred and ""accidentally"" hung up on! They uni formally said the person I need to speak to is ""off duty"" and to call back at different times. When I did that, they amazingly happened to be too busy, at the moment, to speak to me. The hotel manager NEVER returned my calls (not even a voice mail) and through some lackey, asked if I would take Starwood Preferred points as compensation. I just wanted to speak and try to comprehend their WEAK communication and leadership skills. 

After several weeks, I just gave up entirely, and just wrote them off. I still have ALL my attempts documented with names, dates, times, and dept heads. 

Minuses- 
1. They don't have an 800 toll free number! Which means it's LONG distance phone charges! 
2. Valet parking is under the direct sizzling Vegas sun! I could have parked it myself...without tipping the guy! It was so hot in the car, you'd think Valet would be better in a covered garage.

If this is OFF STRIP, you should expect cheaper day rates.

NOT HERE.

AIRLINE PERSONNEL WELCOME ONLY.
All the rest, pay surcharge.

I attended a business conference here earlier in the year.
Previously, I have attended business and sales training conferences at some of the best world class hotels on Las Vegas Blvd's world's famous STRIP.

Not here.

The hotel is nice and clean.  They charge very high room rates as compared to elsewhere nearby because they have special booking with airline staff.

Nice restaurant.

Nice bar.

Great free parking like it should be in Las Vegas. Really nice feature is the parking lot is right out front.  Unlike the massive hotel properties ON STRIP where you have to park and walk quite a schlep to the hotel.  That adds about 15 minutes to your day, possibly your morning. Here it's just a few brief minutes jaunt from the parking lot into the lobby.

The conference venue was filthy after the hotel staff was done with it.

Tiny waste paper baskets when what was needed should have been a massive trash bin.

The chairs, while comfy, were filthy with someone else's chip and lunch.  All over the chairs and underneath.

Take Note When Booking Your Conference Here:
No worries.  They only vacuum this room once a week whether it needs it or not. You will need to empty the too small trash bins yourself 3x a day.

4509995,2009-11-30,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"First and foremost, Las Vegas Casinos don't give the  love to pet owners as much as other cities and their hotels.  I know the pets don't gamble, but I would rather have a cute dog next to me than a drunk twenty something throwing up on the hallways after over drinking and losing his 100 bucks playing craps.

That being said, I read most of the reviews here before I went to this Westin.  I wasn't expecting much but got a great deal.  Of course, I drove from San Diego for Thanksgiving with some of my family so I had a car to drive around the strip.  I have been to Vegas so many times that I don't even do any touristy thing unless there is something new.  Unfortunately, the new City Center (67 acres of steel and metal) was not open ye (supposed to have specialized boutiques like 5th ave in NY or the Magnificent Mile in Chicago see the website).  There are also various hotel and residential properties along the same property.

Back to the Westin, as described by others, although it labels itself a Hotel, Casino & Spa, it is more of a Hotel and Spa.  The casino part is small and very intimate.  There are some slot machines and table games but the table games are only open at night and 24/7 only on weekends. 

The room was pretty standard with some of the fixtures updated and I never felt I was at a motel or some lower class hotel.  Seeing some of the other hotels in the strip, The Westin is dwarfed and there is not a lot of bldg and prkng to speak of.  There is no lounge area (thank god) but there is a bar if you come back from some event or show and want to just sit and drink before going to bed (even play video poker).

I can honestly recommend this more to those who bring their dogs (20lbs or under).  Its the closest to the strip if you do not desire to walk far.  I have stayed at the Staybridge Suites off Russell Road and 15 but  its not an easy walk to the strip from there.  And they were never surprised that a dog or dogs were being walked in the lobby to do its duty outside.  The outside path for the dogs is fairly small and next to the outdoor Employee area (for smoking - the hotel is non-smoking except in the lobby/casino area).

If you ever have any questions about this place, let me know.  Service itself is adequate and useful.  One feature that I like is Room Service.  I know they are overpriced but here is the deal.  You drove for 6 hours and now you are in your room hungry, do you really want to get up, and go downstairs to the lobby restaurant or even drive to another casino/hotel to get some food.  You just want some nourishment so you can rest.  I try to stay away from ordering too much, just enough to last you until you get to the nice restaurant you planned to visit.

I would book at this place again in the future.

By the way, I lost a lot of money in Vegas but gained more info on where to stay next time we bring Apricot our dog.",MAatw6IQHYCqeATbHHMz1w,5,4,4,zwioSlVHM5eGafw3cht9kQ

I know it's a pretty standard fee,  but most hotels inform you of that before charging you for it. I really didn't like that we checked into a hotel room with a clogged toilet. They sent a technician to fix the problem but all he did was use a plunger. He said the toilet needed a part changed but the warehouse was too far for him to go and come back. He said he would let the next shift know so that they could take care of it in the morning since it was passed 1am at that point. No one ever followed up and we had a leaking toilet all weekend. What I REALLY didn't like about our stay was that housekeeping lacks  basic training at this hotel. We left our room at about 11am on saturday and returned at about 4pm. When we got back to our room, the door was OPEN! Housekeeping was not insides. She was about 3 rooms down from us cleaning another room.  How long was our room left open for? Did anyone walk into our room? If we hadn't returned at 4pm, would our room have been left open all night!? All of our belongings were vulnerable to the public of the hotel and management was barely apologetic about it. After complaining to the front desk, a manager  came to our door and explained that their staff was still training and offered us a free breakfast. A free breakfast is such a joke in return for losing privacy/security. When you pay for a room you expect to have a safe place to stay and a safe place to leave your belongings. The Westin failed at this and management failed at attempting to mend their huge error. Never staying here again. I gave one star for the very courteous valet staff.

I was staying at the Paris and my wife and I came here to gamble a tad before we ate at the Paris buffet. Before we left Texas I was reading on VegasChatter.com that did a story on this casino. They were saying how slow it is and how they think it is due to the people who work there. We didn't see any of that at all. Yes, the casino is really small, but Westin's are not known for casinos. As a matter of fact they were so slow that when we entered the casino area, a waitress asked us if we wanted anything to drink. That almost never happens. I played BJ and my wife played a few penny slots. We were there for about an hour or so, and we had a great time. Everyone was nice and the drink service was fast, I even had 2 drinks at one point. The dealers had on a smile as I was winning money and they had a smile on when they were taking my money back later that night. It was still fun. We may stay here on another trip, because we really like the Westin properties in Dallas and San Antonio. 
I would say if you just want to get away from all the people in the casinos on the strip, I would check out this place. It's an easy walk across from Bally's and you will never know who you will be playing BJ next too. 

Check it out if you can.

4578141,2015-01-03,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"This place has a great location, the rooms are decent, and it is cheap! But there's a reason why the Westin has some terrible reviews.

If you're looking for an economical stay, buyer beware -- they advertise that there is 'free' internet but there is a mandatory $20/night charge for 'high-speed' internet. 

Now, a review.

1) Location (4.5/5).  While Westin is not on the strip, it was only a short 8 minute walk to the Flamingo. Fantastic location and on the middle of the strip too.

2) Amenities (1/5). BE AWARE! This hotel charges $20/night for amenities and made no effort to tell us what they were (happy hour in the lobby, for example).  Considering we were there for 4 nights, the extra $80 for amenities which we were not informed of was pure robbery. The only perk I did appreciate was that they gave us complimentary water (if you can call that a perk).

3) Rooms (3/5). The rooms are solid, clean, but seem pretty old. I've stayed at over 10 hotels on the strip and these are by far one of the most basic rooms i've stayed at.  Oh yeah, the shower isn't hot. Nothing wrong with that, but for the price point you could really do better.

4) Starwood Upgrades (0/5).  We were here with a few starwood preferred guest members who stay at this Westin Las Vegas every year. When they choose the upgrade option, they have NEVER gotten the upgrade, so Starwood Members beware. I was told that there were very few suites in the hotel so it is next to impossible to get an upgrade at this hotel.

5) Entertainment (1/5). There's a small casino with a few tables and a mediocre restaurant. Not bad, but we had to go elsewhere for all our entertainment. 

Other complaints:
- Both of our keycard deactivated on New Years eve. Imagine having to drunk stumble back to the front desk to get it reactivated. The service desk was apologetic, so points to them.
- There was NO HOT WATER in the shower on our first day.  We had just flown in and had a dinner reservation at Joel Robuchon and needed a shower before this special occasion, so I was pretty upset when the water was cold.  When I called front desk about this, they were very unhelpful. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone - there is just too much wrong with it. I hate giving bad reviews, but avoid this place if you can.",iA4iura1mleENeFMYaz-SQ,4,0,2,Ioe8opxnierkV2ie7kOl7A

4812823,2012-06-02,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I spent four nights here over the recent holiday weekend... my last visit to Vegas involved a disappointing stay a mile away, with no in-room coffee and nothing interesting close to the hotel other than a Hard Rock restaurant. Having had good Starwood experiences since joining SPG in 2004, I figured I couldn't go wrong here. 

I didn't go wrong. 

The front desk staff were always helpful, Marcus at Suede remembered my name and was very courteous and attentive to my needs, the room was comfortable and clean, the breakfast buffet was the best buy for breakfast, and I loved being able to hook up a HDMI cable to the in-room LCD TV and have a second monitor for my laptop. 

They have a ""green"" program for SPG members, where if you forego housekeeping for a day, you get $5 off food and drink or 500 SPG points. If you're staying more than three days, I'd suggest not choosing this option at checkin... you can choose it with a card on your door each night, so if you want your room cleaned in the middle but not every day, you can still get the benefits (I think) other than the cleaning day and the checkout day. However, when I needed towels or coffee I just asked at the front desk and they were delivered promptly. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, it's about ""a block"" to the Strip. If you come from a normal city, think 4 blocks to the corner where Bill's is. You'll find Bumblebee from the Transformers (or a reasonable facsimile) there, and the rest of the Las Vegas strip. There's a liquor and grocery store two normal-blocks away (halfway to the Strip), and the gas station next door has a reasonable convenience store in case you miss the 10pm closing of the gift shop. 

Main upsides:

* Courteous staff. Never a bad experience with the personnel. 
* Breakfast buffet at Suede was great. Not cheap, and I might have shopped around if it hadn't been on company expense, but it was a pretty good start to the day.
* 24-hour coffee availability, in-room and at Starbucks in the lobby. 
* Nice in-room amenities and linens/towels/robe. 

The only downsides I'd have to report would be:

* The TV is HD but the cable channels are not. On the upside, HDMI in, so you can use your laptop or portable DVD easily. And of all the things that could be bad, I'll take this one. 
* I got the ""hotel computer is being worked on"" message when trying to look at my folio on the tv. Not sure if that got fixed, or if it was because I was on a corporate plan, but that was unexpected. 
* Parking structure is a bit cramped. Always a free space... free as in available, and free as in no parking fees... but it could get scary if it was a crowded car weekend.
* Mini-bar was a bit sparse. Beer, wine, soda, bottled water, a snack or two. But if you can't find a drink in Vegas otherwise, you need help. :)

OK, I REALLY am that bad about cigarette smoke and I originally chose the Westin because it was practically the only smoke-free hotel in Las Vegas I could find.

This is mostly true: except for the bar and the casino. Of course the casino is smack dab in the center of the 1st floor lobby and you can't avoid it if you're going to Starbucks, to eat at Suede, pick up souvenirs in the hotel gift shop, or catch the elevator to your room. In other words, you must contend with cigarette smoke any time you enter the lobby.

That being said, the smoke annoyance was minimal -- notice I still gave the Westin 4 stars -- but maybe it was because the hotel wasn't that crowded or maybe there were a lot more non-smokers staying there so I didn't have the smell in my clothes or hair all the time. *SIGH* until the pricier/fancier casino/hotels barr smoking COMPLETELY (and that ain't gonna happen any time soon), I'll keep spending my money at the Westin.

The restaurant, Suede, was excellent and except for one dinner, we had all our meals there. I think someone else said it was pricey, yes, it is pricey, but the Wait Staff were way above my expectations; I've eaten at more than a few of those ""Celebrity Chef"" restaurants on the Strip and had better service at Suede. No complaints about the service or food. People at the front desk were friendly and helpful too; check-in and check-out was a breeze.

Our room was clean and didn't smell like dog as the Westin is a pet-friendly (ewwwwwwww!) establishment. The heavenly bed and shower were wonderful as well. We stayed three nights and my ONLY complaint was that we couldn't get our room cooler than 72 degrees. I called the front desk and a repair person was there in about 15 minutes (English was not his first language however) but when he left he said it was ""fixed."" Never did get the room to cool down below 70. Guess I should consider my self lucky since it wasn't the hot season in Vegas yet.

Like others have already said, I like the fact that the Westin is off the Strip, parking is self-park & free (unless you use the Valet). Overall, the hotel is clean, quiet, and comfortable. It's also right next door to a small liquor store so it was easy to go and buy a bottle of wine or a snack if we wanted without having to pay room-service prices.

I arrived in Vegas with my batchelorette party and noticed the hotel is very much off the strip. It was roughly a 10 minute walk to the strip. Take this into consideration when you think you're going to walk to whatever club/restaurant/bar you want to go to and then realize you have heels on. In short, you probably won't walk from the Westin to the strip unless you're shopping or sightseeing. With that said there are homeless people begging for some change, randos wandering up and down the street tipsy or drunk and the occasional stray dog on the walk to the hotel. It can be sketchy. I dealt with both HOWEVER, I don't like people walking by you dropping cans of soda and then yelling at the top of their lungs startling you (from a really close distance) -- that'll get someone's eyes burning by that special little seasoning we love and use on foods.

The hotel itself was a little slow on check in. Other than that they were very friendly. There is a Starbucks on premises that's open 24/7 -- you may want to check that out. The rooms need some updates. There is nothing wrong with the beds but the rooms need some modern features to brighten it up a bit. Ordered room service and the food turned out perfectly - I was very surprised. The rooms were dark and the bathroom should've been a bit bigger. It seems like this Westin is an older hotel so in order to attract customers they certainly need to provide this hotel with a massive facelift. I have stayed at plenty of Westin's and feel this property falls short when it comes to the modern aspects of it.

The bar area is small and relatively tasteful (I don't partake but it's nice to not have to walk past a tacky, smoky bar area to get to my room).  Coming off the elevator, the colors are neutral and muted--not Vegas-electric.  And when you get to your room it is a Westin room (this is a VERY good thing).  Great bed, great shower, great room.  And, unlike most Vegas hotels, the room service food is actually decent quality. 

The only thing that I would mark them down for is that at certain times of the year, the taxis kinda forget about this place.  So this isn't really a knock against the hotel just a caveat about the overall stay experience.",srMgQgx8RAN978cYgFDXmw,1,0,4,ocWaax5aZBh1Tz8nkYpm0Q
4928594,2009-07-23,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"After three nites at Planet Hollywood (reviewed, 3-stars), I was looking forward to my move a traditional and 'quiet' business hotel.  That is what you'll find at the Westin, despite the casino in the lobby.

In contrast to your typical Vegas mega casino resort--you won't be charged $20-$30/day for fitness club access.  And unlike Planet Hollywood's 9AM pool opening time and Mandalay Bay's at 8am, here, the pool opens at 6AM and doesn't close until 2AM!

Also, in comparison to typical Vegas strip mega-hotels (this is 1/4 mile east of mid-strip) this place is tiny.  Say, 300 guest rooms instead of 3,000.  It does have a casino, but small with a tiny sports book offering better odds than big boys (e.g. Patriots 9-2, while Mandalay Bay is 3-1).  Also, on weekdays 5-8pm blackjack has a $5 minimum.

GOOD HOTEL..................................
-No lengthy check-in line.
-My room had nice furnishings.  
-Bath robes in room.
-Evening reception with free beer, wine and snacks.
-Nice, i-POD-compatible stereo radio.
-(my room rate included nice breakfast buffet).
-24-hour Fitness Room
-Decent outdoor pool.
-In room coffee maker.

ALTHOUGH......................................
-Standard, old tube TV.  No HBO, etc.
-Guest room normal sized--i.e. tiny by Vegas standards. That also means a small bathroom, with one tub and one sink.
-It's a little bit amateur-hour management here.  For example, there was no hotel guidebook in room with information on the health club, pool, TV stations, etc.   When I inquired, I was told that the hotel was out of them.  Bath robes were delivered while I was out one evening.  Except they were tossed, rolled-up on the floor.  My blackjack dealer had trouble adding up cards (I am NOT joking).  Some gamblers may think that this is a good thing  ; )",85gI4BQZ9zMtqkQ33niGWw,0,0,3,lrQRHXS4kuUgYMhRoJNa7Q

The service poolside was not very friendly and we were not able to check in early because they said they had no rooms available.  They had said that to a lot of people.  I find it fascinating that at exactly 5 minutes till 4 all of the rooms got magically cleaned and we were able to check in.  They probably need to work on that.,4sd36-D0tqMMEZdCKFi0vA,1,1,3,Yf0UF2HzlQI-MiAyZaGzFA
4930291,2016-10-12,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Before I get into the cons let me first say the staff members were very friendly, one of the Westin experience managers even sent us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise to celebrate our anniversary; we were very thankful for that. Also we were able to check-in early and check-out late. It was clean and only a quick walk to the strip if you wish to stay off-strip. The spa was nice and there is a Starbucks and Enterprise Rent-a-Car on site. However, for 12,800 SPG points per night we expected much more. We felt like we were staying at Super 8 with a Westin sign out front. There are no microwaves unless you want to pay $20 per day, there is a mini fridge but it only serves as a ""cooler"" unless you get the mini fridge package. We had to walk to the gas station next door and use their microwave!  Even the most basic hotels I have stayed at while traveling for work, which is a lot, has at LEAST a microwave and mini fridge..and the Westin doesn't?? So you basically are screwed if you bring left overs back to the room. The pool area was sad, very small. The ""Max"" casino in the lobby....well, I wouldn't call it a casino there are a hand full of slot machines and a few card tables that don't open until 4 pm. We were very disappointed as owners. SLS is also a starwood property here in Las Vegas; we visited it just to check it out because the two were both 12,800 points per night and boy is there a difference! It made me nauseated to see the difference in just the lobby, decor and size of the hotel. I mean, this is vegas people! I walked in some of the best hotels/resorts/casinos on the strip and The Westin just did not make the cut on this one.

I love staying at the Westin...the amazing beds, the large rooms, the non-smoking atmosphere...but this Westin fell a bit short of my normal expectations of what a Westin should be.

To start off the visit: went to check in at the Gold/Platinum Preferred Guest desk, and there was no one there. Waited...waited...waited, then someone finally showed up - from her smoking break. I realize this sounds totally bougie, and I don't mean to sound bougie, but whatever...

Another misnomer: I thought this hotel would be a ""smoke-free"" hotel. When I think of smoke-free, I think...NO smoking, right?! WRONG!! I guess smoking is allowed in the casino and lobby area because it still smelled like an ash tray. Ironically enough, there were signs posted that said ""no smoking"" yet, they had ash trays and matches at the slots and card tables. Thankfully, the rooms were no smoking!!

At any rate - not what I expected for a Westin, but not total crap like other hotels in the same price range for the area cost.",Sp-S4y8rx1xIX3d5VOK0bQ,1,2,3,bhFI5UnhXfgJLcvjHvXcww

Also, as a guest in cosmo, mgm, the cromwell etc you get vip treatment at that club there! That is about the same savings as the room charge!

4946527,2009-05-12,11,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"We go to Vegas a lot and usually have always stayed at the larger, flashier hotels, but this time, I decided to try out the Westin. I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.

Check in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.

Between 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.

Later, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.

The Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.

We did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?

He changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. 

So for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas. I'm done with all those kitschy flashy hotels.

Oh, and winning money at the casino was another huge plus!!

I didn't know we would be visiting until the day before I left, but was able to find a good deal online. Way below anything I could find on the Strip. Very happy I found a place that I feel comfortable enough to return to.

Vegas has so many hotels with such a vast difference of reviews and prices and it's hard to find something that matches my needs on a consistent basis.  I may have found that with the Westin.
First, not your typical Vegas hotel on the Strip.  It is far enough to be away from all of the crap of the Strip, yet walking distance if so inclined.  It is on Flamingo, nearly right across the street of Bally's. Easy walk to the crosswalk, to Bally's and then all that the Strip has to offer. From the hotel, looking west is Caesars.  We like to walk and went, going north, to Venetian and going south all the way to Monte Carlo. Very close to Miracle Mile Shops.

Now, the hotel.  Very easy check-in and very polite. Easy hotel to navigate. Very small casino, which happily eliminates the smoke-filled casino. I would have liked more gaming, but I guess you can't have both.  There could be more eating establishments; slim pickings.  Starbucks is very convenient.  Another awesome feature: easy parking access, and FREE!  Also, a lower resort fee than anything on the Strip.  Another huge plus. And one other negative:  my wife was very dissatisfied with the lack of a great gift shop.

Room and bathroom were great.  Excellent sleep, nice firm mattress.
Check-out was easy and very polite and helpful.

Will definitely return.",tmmEeNlrppyARtYNg-EpLg,0,0,4,oRULq7PAU2JAxlmoBKqGJA

GAMBLING: They also have $3 blackjack and craps / 25 cent roulette specials until 5pm. You can't beat the price for this location, it's literally just across from Bally's and across from Caesar's.

AMENITITES: Rooms are clean, typical Westin style no frills. There is a small basic gym, spa, and small pool area. Everytime I go, I get credit for the breakfast buffet at Sueded which is a decent place for basic food like eggs, bacon, and french toast. The only problem is that I wish there were more food options nearby. The best restaurants are really off the strip and on the main strip hotels.

When we visited, the hotel was undergoing renovations and we were fortunate enough to have a newly-renovated room. The updated rooms are tastefully decorated in white/neutral tones and the beds are very comfortable. The outdoor seating and pool area is located on the second floor, is perfect for sun-bathing and includes a variety of seating options and several private bungalows. 

Service and staff: Staff was exceptionally attentive, friendly and welcoming. Room service was quick (albeit slightly expensive) and there is an option to ""rent"" a set of workout clothing (including shoes) for those of you who do not want to pack extra bulk. 

Food and drink: As previously mentioned, room service was quick and the meals were very good. As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with ordering any of the menu items. 

Overall impression: In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel to individuals looking for an affordable alternative to many of the big name hotels within Las Vegas.

My only issue is this and it set the tone for the rest of my stay here which is why I gave it two stars:

As someone who is currently active duty military and looking to relax and enjoy myself before going on deployment, the treatment I received from the front desk staff was not very welcoming. I booked a room for 2 double beds via Vegas.com. According to the front desk when I checked in, the room isn't a guarantee since it was with a third party so the only room they had available was a King bed which would be fine if I was traveling by myself but this wasn't the case.

The front desk then told me that I had to wait if I wanted to get a room with two double beds. For how long, she couldn't say and I asked if I could try again Saturday morning when people checked out but she said they were fully booked that day as well. So pretty much if you don't book your room on the main Westin website, nothing is guaranteed. Maybe a free upgrade to compensate for the lack of availability of the pre-paid room would've been nice and something that's happened before at other hotels I've stayed at on the strip but it wasn't the case here. 

I'd say it's worth it to spend that few extra dollars and stay at a hotel that actually guarantees you the room you requested.",pOTRc3VY-03BTZCbuFqk4w,1,0,2,nfx-D1ck5McDNz-9zQ46dA

We brought our dog, who was blown away at being taken thru a casino and up an elevator (please don't poop, please don't poop!).  They only charge a $35 pet fee and a refundable deposit.  I felt that this was very reasonable.  We were a little paranoid so we bought some incontinence mattress pads at CVS and spread them ALL over the floor.  Our dog was awesome, no accidents.  

They have a postage stamp dog potty area, which they keep very clean.  Worked fine for our dog.

The room was small but cozy and the beds were VERY comfortable with an abundance of cushy new blankets and pillows.  Our dog was tortured by itching and kept trying to get off the floor and we think she might have been having a reaction to either the carpet or the carpet cleaner.  Keep that in mind if your pet has sensitive skin.

Everyone we encountered was super friendly and helpful.  Just a really nice bunch of folks.  They have some computers and printers right in the lobby that you can use w/out having to sign in or pay.

The location is great!  Right behind the Flamingo, about 1 1/2 blocks from the new ferris wheel.

The Bad:  Lamest casino EVER!  Thank god I wasn't there to gamble.  I wandered down to the video poker bar and stuffed in a $20.  I like to slowly loose about $20 while having a few free drinks.  The bartender immediately warned me that drinks aren't comped at the bar.  I found that many of the machines had non-functioning buttons (""the manager doesn't want to pay for the repairs"").  So I went down to the casino floor, found the cocktail waitress, ordered a drink, and parked my ass at a machine.  The machines were all old, run down, w/ hazy, scratched screens, and cheap graphics.  Many of them didn't work.  The cocktail waitress never came back w/ anyone's drinks.  After about 15 mins I decided I was too sober to find gambling amusing.  On my way back to the elevator, I saw the cocktail waitress sitting at the poker bar, having a drink.  Okay...I guess she had gone off shift.

They definitely do not thoroughly clean the rooms. Seems like a quick turn to get rooms turned over. 

Bathroom is very old but does have lots of counter space. The bathroom door seems like it expanded because it takes a good push to open or close it, making it very loud and disturbing especially in the middle of the night. 

Westin's are known for their Heavenly beds and this bed is not a Heavenly bed!  This is probably my biggest disappointment as I just wanted to have a good night of rest. Struggled to get air flow in the room. Had a horrible time sleeping at night. 

TV was not working well. Not sure if this is the satellite feed issue because of a storm or if the system just kept rebooting itself. 

The only reason why I did not give them one star is because room services for breakfast was surprisingly good. They delivered the food quickly, it was still hot, great portion and tasted great. My husband and I split the turkey and egg tacos.

If you booked at the Westin in any other town you would land yourself in a beautiful, classy hotel, with great service.  But in Vegas the Westin is so subpar and here's why:

The Westin had long check-in lines.  Our room was not ready on time on a Friday night when we had early dinner reservations and already had limited time to get ready.  I think we waited about 45 minutes to get checked into our room.  From there we had to make a call and push back our dinner reservations.  What a lovely start to a weekend in Vegas.  The Westin has a tiny pool and spa area.  Get there early or you will not be getting a seat.  The spa, which was the whole reason we booked here was very lacking in amenities.

The good:
+ Clean, nicely furnished rooms with comfy beds.
+ Double sink bathroom.
+ Starbucks cafe in-house.
+ Complimentary drinks and small bites at happy hour in the restaurant lounge.

The bad:
- No fan ventilation in the bathroom!
- Small casino. They might as well not have one at all.
- Small pool. 
- Lousy doormen with the worst skills at hailing cabs. My group waited about a half an hour for a taxi...in Vegas. I should have walked to Bally's across the street. I bet they had a whole line of taxis. While waiting in frustration for taxis, the doormen also tried to convince us to take limos. We even agreed to it, but the limos never came!

Overall, it was just okay. I was expecting more because I was in Vegas, home of gigantic hotels, prime dining options, and limitless entertainment. In the end, the Westin provided great accommodations for sleeping, but that's about it.",sDjLntGYVuhp4FlKz33P_w,8,8,3,45TGy_nfWsaG6ZR2T5gmqQ

The ""Heavenly"" this and that, is actually really comfortable. You could sleep all weekend and the drapes do a really good job of blocking out the sun. The bathroom also comes complete with Starbucks coffee if you choose. The pool area is a little small, but maybe that adds to the charm. There are a few poolside lounge chairs that have an overhead mist on those hot days. On another side of the pool, there are cabanas that you can pay for. This hotel is also pretty close to the strip.

Now the bad. The casino part of the hotel is very small and they do not have a lot of tables. The craps table was not open most of the time we were there. None of the rooms had a good view of anything from either side. The elevators are whack too. When you press a button, it only affects one elevator, so then you have to press another button to call another elevator...so if this makes any sense to you, there will be multiple elevators coming to your floor unnecessarily.

Of course with all Vegas weekends there is always some type of drama and unfortunately it was hotel drama. There was 3 of us checking in and our check in went smoothly, the room was nice but upon checking in we got in our room to find our toilet was not working. We called down to have it looked at, they sent engineering up to our room and the toilet was fixed. Fast forward a few hours and I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and it was broken AGAIN...I really had to go and went down stairs to the lobby to use the restroom. I went back up after I was done, my key had been demagnetized so I had to go to the front desk to get a new key and I mentioned to the front desk person what was happening with the toilet and he was very receptive to my issue. He said we could move rooms in the morning (it was 4am) AWESOME. I went back up to the room and went back to bed. In the morning I mentioned to the girls what happened and called down to move rooms. You would think I dreamt the whole conversation with the front desk guy no one had record of the conversation, the issue or even the engineer visit upon our arrival!!. We had such an issue trying to get a new room, they finally did it but after we went downstairs to speak with guest services and a conversation with the manager. He was a smug individual and I am so surprised that this man is even in the hospitality field. He was condescending and rude and made us feel like whiny bitches.
We changed rooms, bathroom worked YES!!! AC did not work well but at this point a working toilet was all I needed and as long as the room was at a comfortable temp I guess it would be fine.
The one star is for the shower heads, AWESOME shower heads, water pressure and loved it so much I was taking 2 showers a day.
The location is a block off the strip BUT there are a lot of questionable characters in this area, homeless people. They have a little drinking area right next to the hotel in an open lot. We were fine walking in the daytime to the strip but at night a cab was necessary. Looked a little shady.

As a Platinum Member, the buffet breakfast is great. Lots of choices for American-style buffet. The staff are also extremely friendly when serving me orange juice/coffee/water. I stayed for a full week during CES and have nothing but positive feedback for them,.

As for the gym, it is actually quite decent for a Westin. You've got a bunch of cardio machines, good quality freeweights, and a few machines. I just use the freeweights (small section, but does the job).

As for Platinum Recognition, the hotel needs to work on that. Not sure if they never upgrade me to suites during my visits and only higher floors, but would definitely like to be told that there are no suites, or they're sold out. I've never really been ""upgraded"" except maybe to a higher floor. That is my only area of improvement, which dings them 1 star since I feel like a normal visitor. 

There may be a wait sometimes checking in also since they get crowds of airline flight attendants. It is also sometimes very difficult to get a taxi since you're off the strip - it took usually 3-15 minutes to get one.

Casino area is small - that is ok by me because I am not a big gambler and I find the other hotels casino area over whelming since you have to walk threw them all the time to go anywhere. 

Check in - well for me went poorly. Arriving at 530pm and 2 people ahead of me for a check in who were with staff. I standing in line waiting to be served had to wait for more than 25 minutes. This would be acceptable because the other to staff members were being catered to..However, there were more staff behind the desk doing absolutely nothing.  Now, if they were not the 'staff' to check people in they get out behind the desk. If you were then shame on you for making guest wait..Actually the staff at the concierge's area came over to me at 25 minute mark and asked me if they could at least get me a water or at least help me with something....In my eyes this check in process needs to be looked at

Rooms - we had a king size bed that over looked the high roller (back side of the hotel). The bed were comfortable, clean room, small fridge - great for water bottles, bathroom clean and well equipped with what you need. The only thing wish they had 2 bath robe not one..But you can always call to get another one.

There is a safe in the room - it didnt work for us and we didnt report it either..but is ok cause we didnt need it.

House Keeping - didnt need it much cause we had the do not disturb be sign up all the time, but every morning we had a bag with a bottle water, and coffee and supplies hanging from our door.

I did however called house keeping and ask if possible if we could have a case of water in our room. Without any question or hesitation they brought up a case for us,and they didnt charge us for it. Now this taking care of your customer.

Pool - is small and quite as for the action there. But the lounge chairs are wooden with warn out pads and well when you go to move them be careful. My fingers got jammed/wedged in between the back rest and well caused damaged to a couple of my fingers as I found out after I got home. Not good for a massage therapist...

Some nights or maybe all the nights they have free munchies & drinks..it is great for pre social gathering for the night.

Also was a little too hungover to go out for breakfast so we ordered room service and it was very fast and not bad tasting either!  Pool is not very busy so it was easy to find a lounge chair and is decent.  They also have comp happy hour which we made good use of one particular night.

It was very quiet, never heard anybody from our room, and you didn't have to walk a mile to get to your room.

5470756,2018-01-07,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,This hotel which is near Las Vegas Blvd is technically off the strip but is actually almost a strip hotel. We stayed here New Years Eve and it was so near Las Vegas Blvd that we just walked for a short distance. Roads were also closed but the hotel's parking lot is near Koval St so we were able to go in with no problem .  The room was clean and the bar restaurant in the lobby was always open. Valet parking is the greatest. You get your car in 5 mins compared to being in Aria where you wait for 30 mins.

5518950,2009-06-01,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Overall, a decent experience. Check-in was prompt and friendly. The room was clean on the surface, but showed signs of much wear, especially the carpet. My ironing board was broken and I called for a replacement. when I came back to my room later, the board was replaced, but #2 was also broken (ironically, exactly the same way with the exact same markings and stains). call #3 resulted in a working ironing board.

Very loud people across the hall, though a call to Service Express resulted in security responding within moments. On my second day (of 3), my room was not made up by housekeeping. I left the room at 8 a.m. and returned at 3 p.m. Albeit, I put out the do-not-disturb sign between 3-4, and housekeeping likely came by then. I left at 4 and returned after 7. I would have appreciated a call asking if I wanted my room made up. 

Main hotel pet peeve - why take the perfectly good bar of soap I opened? Your signs ask me about clean towels and sheets, but why can't I keep the bar of soap I opened?! 

I moved the one bar of soap into the shower (hoping they wouldn't take it). Didn't realize there was no soap until I was in the shower. Had to step out and get the new, unopened bar of soap from the vanity. Annoying. 

The bellman/valet conned me into taking an unauthorized limo service to the airport even though I insisted 3x on a cab. I reluctantly agreed only to have the driver ask me not to tell (oops!) since he isn't authorized to serve as a taxi. A call back to the hotel resulted in a conversation with the bellmen supervisor and someone in customer service. I thought they handled my call very well.

$5 just to log on to the Internet to print a boarding pass? Seriously? 

Oh...to the reviewer who felt duped/conned by the $8 bottle of water on the dresser: the tag attached to the bottle clearly states the price. Overpriced? Yes. Conned. No.",wg4PKu2VK8IqJ3GybY6ARg,2,1,3,ZKBdcP-0NVRapssk3fjm7A

Overall, I thought this hotel was great. It's smoke free except for the casino area, which is pretty much impossible to find in Vegas. The standard room I stayed in was fairly large. The bathroom and beds were really nice and everything looked clean. The bed had one of the nicest comforters I've used at a hotel - it was fairly comfortable, and I definitely got a good night's sleep (probably because I was so tired from the weekend).

All in all, it's a great business hotel. I did a prepaid deal (no refund if I canceled), which gave me a great rate on the room. The internet was pretty ridiculous at $14 per day, but I guess that's to be expected.",vZ60gN0Tx-sDhTOUh9EWMQ,1,0,4,ji1I2Mpdag6f4iIeBj7G6A

I've stayed here multiple times and i LOVE the location. It's so close to the strip, not on it but so close. It's also quite close to the light rail which is convenient if you're partial to taking that vs. cabs. 

The rooms are decent sized, comfortable. I love the Westin Heavenly Bed and bedding. Always equals a great night sleep for me. 
One feature of this hotel we like is, yes, there's a casino, but it's not like the endless miles and miles of slot machines like at the large hotels right on the strip. it's a smaller square footage and limited to the main lobby. The restaurant bar is right next to it so there's no reprieve if you're looking to have a beverage there but that's why we enjoy the pool...!
We always grab a chaise out by the pool whenever we're in town. It's fun to hang and enjoy a cocktail pool side- they do not have pool parties like SLS or Wynn or Encore. It's a far more sedate scene... I bring a book. It's mellow and good for sunning. Partying? not so much. NBD for us though.

On this trip we were celebrating a special occasion and someone super special to us sent us a cheese platter from room service. Oh my it was fantastic! They knocked it out of the park. The strawberries were perfectly ripe & so sweet. The grapes were also. These cheese selection was impressive and excellent quality. We're cheese fiends so that was a score! I'd definitely recommend ordering it. 

The one downside of this place is that their bathroom was under par. The grout was kinda funky as you can see in the photos. They did a decent job cleaning the place overall but it failed my expectations. Also the bathroom ceiling height is oddly low. I had to knock off 2 stars for shower condition. 
I also wasn't thrilled at our reception when we checked in. We were needlessly made to wait which was annoying. Not sure what that was all about and I'll spare you the deets. 
I'd come back here though. It's a good value for the location and it's a good nights sleep. Just don't expect an immaculate bathroom.",9qxZWyZcgYZJqPTvWoWjBg,6,2,3,DPm4eFDWrIJ9LiI2MUNaeQ

Relative to other options near the strip, there's few that are this clean (and none this affordable). I am sensitive to fragrances, pet dander, mold and the karmic ghosts of failed gamblers. The Westin is thankfully free of all these things. Sure, there are fancier places in town that are just as clean, but the cost of those places are triple. Pro tip: this place is crawling with flight attendants and pilots, and it is a target-rich environment, for those who are on the prowl. What else... there's a small casino on the first floor, with a friendly roulette table and a William Hill sports book. Some would see that as a negative, I like that you have to get out of your hotel to have adventures, and that there is a quiet refuge when you are done with all that mess.

Yes, the rooms are smaller.... but we're really not spending much time in our rooms anyways in Vegas. 

Yes, the pool area is significantly smaller than most Vegas properties. 

Yes, the bathroom does seem smaller than ""typical"" Westin's ... but it still I'd say a ""typical"" hotel-sized bathroom. Except it has the Westin signature ""Dual Showerheads"". 

The pro's in staying here:

1) You get SPG points if you're a Starwood junkie
2) The parking lot is small and manageable unlike so many other hotel property parking lots in Vegas
3) It's a quick entrance from the parking area to your hotel room; unlike so many other Vegas hotels where you literally have to walk FOREVER to get to your room
4) Their casino card gets you comps good for anything/services in the Spa, their hotel restaurant Suede, on-site Starbucks, or towards your hotel bill

7) Unwind/Rewind social hour/s with complimentary alcohol and few snacks
8) You can bring your dogs here

When we arrived on Friday afternoon, I headed straight to the Starwood Preferred Guest desk and politely asked if we could be given a king bed instead of the double bed that I originally reserved.

My coworkers and I went to this hotel bar a LOT while staying at the hotel. We were excited because they have a free happy hour for business people to mingle and maybe hook up with each other later. It was pretty lame as it turns out. They had a giant bowl of chips for us to eat and Pace Picante salsa in a slightly smaller but still big bowl. They had Bud Light and red, or white if you chose that option, wine. ""From the bottle to the cup"" is the slogan they kept using. Not very creative if you ask me, but no one ever does. That's why I write reviews on the internet.
I observed many flight attendants while sitting at this bar. I also got mistaken for a flight attendant by a drunken pilot. He loved trying to buy his new flight attendant friends drinks. He had seen a lot of movies about pilots and planes, like Airplane and Top Gun. He had a wedding ring according to my coworker so that lowered my opinion of him. I guess he was the only person we talked to.
Also, this isn't about the bar but it relates to alcohol drinking - This hotel has a convenience store at the end of the parking lot! If you can't get your bottle of wine open they have a guy that works at the hotel that will help you. He'll just come right up to your room, which by the way was charming as a country cottage, with one robe to share. But enough about the hotel.
The bar was reasonably priced according to the married pilot who bought my coworker and me drinks. We were all flying high by the end of the night. Try the quesadilla, said Randy, a name I made up for the pilot.",qSPz7aTSN1CHOjqQQiza_A,1,1,3,i-bix9_HaE9NGVXgTCSbUQ

I also got stuck on a lower floor because of this, though this turned out to be a positive later on. 

The elevator situation is just ridiculous. In a bank of 6 cars, they had 2 operating fully and one with limited service that seemed to be used by the hotel staff more than their own back elevators. Two freaking working elevators for a 14-15 story hotel? Ridiculous.

Was excited to stay at The Westin in Las Vegas because I'm aware of the comfort from past experiences with the hotel. However, The Westin in LV didn't have a Westin Hotel feel, at all. We started our stay by arriving at 9pm to check in and were told that our room wasn't ready and they couldn't tell us when it would be.  Apparently they didn't lead on that they overbooked the hotel and were hoping for a checkout to put us in. The associate was non-apologetic and didn't seem to think it was poor service when the room should have been ready for check in at 4pm. We finally got a room at 10pm after the help of a high roller friend who called and spoke to a manager multiple times.
  The room was decent but the older building was obvious by the slamming of doors that woke me early every morning. 
  Very odd...about an hour after we got into our room a housekeeper unlocked our door and walked in unannounced, surprised we were in the room. I guess they don't update the housekeepers soon enough!! Good thing we were still dressed!
  The pool was beyond small..and the website pictures deceiving....making it look much larger. If your looking for a nice pool to lounge in I would say stay clear of The Westin in LV!!
  Both steam rooms were ""out of service"".
  The elevator to the parking garage was ""out of service"" all 3 days. So...imagine carrying your luggage up 3 flights of stairs!
  The bar seated maybe 5 people. There was no lounge or separate seating for a drink and conversation. Above the bat is the old ""cashier"" sign (weird). 
  If anyone remembers The Maxxum Hotel...it's the same building....and the remodel to a Westin is insufficient.

The rooms were Westin-esque, although we have stayed at nicer Westins. I think this place must have been a different hotel before. They offer a full casino and sportsbook. Although not very big, this can be a good thing for someone trying to learn the games without the pressure of the fast-moving strip casinos.

They did charge a $15 fee for each room, but that entitled each guest in that room (we had 2) to a manager's reception every evening from 5:30pm to 7:30pm.

That $19 resort fee, front desk explained what it included and it was beyond reasonable - wifi, free bottles of water, steam/sauna access, etc.
Room- clean, spacious and quiet. My husband was working and they even allowed us to have a late check out no questions asked.
Restaurant was great! I ordered a veggie wrap to go with fruit and it was 1000xs better than the gas station sub next door for almost the same price.
Starbucks open 24 hours should I say more?
Last but not least, Westin staff was THE most friendliest I have experienced in a long time. I know I had a super cute puppy, but everyone stopped to greet, welcome, and dote on us and surrounding guests in general.

The pet area is in the back near their staff entrance and despite being on break, they didn't hesitate to continue their pleasantries.

Contrary to what Priceline thinks, it's not really a 4-star hotel, and if you can get that out of your head during your stay, it's actually a decent hotel on the cheap.

For a busy Friday and Saturday night with tons of events going on town, I got a good deal via Priceline. Even though Priceline adds fees and taxes to your negotiated rate, you'll still get hit with their ""hotel fee"" of $15 per night that. Since we took advantage of everything like the bottled water, tea/coffee, workout room and parking, I didn't mind paying the $30 for 2 nights. But for a longer stay, I could see how it could add up and be pretty annoying.

Service was generally very friendly, from the housekeeping staff to the cashier dude to the blackjack dealer. Contrary to most people, I actually liked playing in an empty casino at the only table. Plus I won some money, so obviously that helped. The only person who looked like they had a stick up her piehole was the front desk lady who checked us in.

We had a room that overlooked the small pool area outside, and a view of Bally's across the street. Safe to say, there's no eye candy and butt flossing, topless parties going on at the Westin. But that's expected, of course. Everything in the room checked out okay except for the fact that whenever we use the shower, the water wouldn't drain quick enough. Ankle-deep in soapy water isn't really fun.

The workout room was surprisingly decent, I half expected it to be the size of a closet with 2 treadmills, but it had a nice variety of equipment.

We probably would have walked just as far staying at a hotel directly on the strip if we had to walk through the casinos. 

The hotel was nice, nothing fancy. They did have a happy hour which was nice, but unfortunately they were serving tacos and only had 1 meat option...pork. I don't eat pork so it was a bummer to not get any free food. 

Also, we were never notified during check in, that they offer a discount if we opt out of maid service by putting the sign on the door. We found this sign in the morning at around 9am, but for some reason it needed to be hung by 2am in order to qualify. That was a bummer since we still didn't use the housekeeping.

My kids love that they could see the airport and a few buildings from the strip as well as the monorail. This hotel is good for families with kids (who asks a lot of questions) as it doesn't have a casino, no cigarette smoke fumes or roudy loud drunk guests.

Casino is even decent. easy to get in and play, no massive crowds, but attentive staff.

Only downside is pool is small and uninspiring, but it is fine (just not las vegas good).

Suede restaurant- attended buffet. It was fine but aside from being in the hotel and convenient, there are too many great options nearby.",OGP5eR9Mz-ouqLtt6DF4zg,0,0,5,ZfXVZaTJNC5CthJHuOO34Q

Megan- I got us really good cheap rooms at the Westin. But it is a non-smoking hotel (but you can smoke in the casino) and the casino is small.

Me- It's non- smoking and it is in Vegas? Oh so avant- garde! Kinda like being in Vegas just not as sinful.

The beds are simply heavenly! 5 stars

The showers are dual- headed and heavenly! 5 stars

The towels are fluffy and heavenly! 5 stars

I was worried that the hotel would be packed with older people and honeymooners... It was. But this usually entails less drama. The lobby was not crazy sprawling maze. I did not have to fight drunken 21 year olds to get to my room. I didn't need to get to the South elevator tower to get to my room and the East tower to get to my friend's rooms. I did not have to go up 10 flights of lot floors to find a parking space. I actually felt refreshed after waking up here, on 5 hours of sleep, because I felt like the Westin provided me relief from all the Vegas madness.

This is the ideal place if you want a smoke-free environment, no hassle and clean environment. Not the place if you want to stay at a happening party hotel.

We aren't sure if they vacuumed our room, we found a hanger from the guest that stayed there prior to us on the floor near the window.

I stayed here the weekend of April 15 and I cant complain.  When I checked in everything was pretty quick and pleasant.  The look of the hotel lobby and the casino was grand.  It was very elegant.  

As I walked into my room they had upgraded me to more spacious room due to the hotel almost running out of rooms.  It seems that weekend was a very busy weekend for sin city, I didn't complain.  Why not take it??   The room was elegant, from the decor to the comfort of the bed.  My room was spacious and everything looked up to date.

Large TV's in the room, complimentary bottled water in the room, starbucks coffee, great shower pressure.  I wouldn't stay here for a  vegas vacation, probably, simply because I'd want something a bit more lively. Great for if youre in town for work, however.  Adequate fitness center- dumbbells up to  60lbs... Full circuit cable pulley machine and a lot of cardio---around 15 cardio machines (ellipticals, bikes and treadmills) free fruit in there as well...   Pool area is pretty simple, but very nice- there is a bar out there, (where this nitwit paid 5.75 for a Redbull!) :- /    There are cabanas and a good amount of lounge chairs, pool and hot tub.  Really, no complaints about this place, Other than, I do agree with another reviewer- the walls are thin, as I could hear people to the side of me- not partying, but just speaking loudly.. A great place to stay if you're looking for something nice and clean, yet w/out the party hard vibe.  It's hard to go wrong with a Westin, however.  I believe there is also some type of daily happy hour too.. FREE food, etc... but I haven't tried that...

5928538,2014-02-22,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"Yes, the Westin still has $3 craps during happy hour, and $5 craps during all the rest of the time. But nevertheless for experienced craps players this is a terrible place to play. The reason: the dealers are not very experienced and there is no pit boss sitting at the table, so that the 3 dealers are continuously carrying on a conversation with one another. The dealers are inattentive and screw up frequently. If you like playing multiple points and are depending upon the dealers moving your come bets to your points and moving your odds to your various bets, it is hopeless. When the dealers make mistakes (which is frequently), they will slide your bet back to you (that should have been on the point that just hit) and say ""sorry, I didn't year you"". The frequent mistakes they make are never resolved in the player's favor, but always in the house's favor.

Until they get a permanent pit boss watching over the poorly trained dealers, this is a terrible place to play craps.",4QuDtcOl35uwnUQJU6D7rQ,0,0,2,MlfhcfOvdE7XYVk0IoIFHw

5961073,2007-07-15,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I hate to start my first review like this, but I just had an awful experience at this Westin hotel. I travel exclusively at Starwood hotels, spending most of my time on the road, and this is the worst Westin I have ever stayed at. The attention to detail that the staff of the hotel presented leads me to believe that this wasn't just a one off bad experience, but is typical of the way this hotel is run.

Just a few highlights:

1) They lost our reservations and we had to wait thirty minutes to get a room. They admitted having messed up but didn't provide any decent compensation. They offered us two free spa treatments even though we had a group of ten people and a block of ten rooms.

2) The iron was broken. They did bring up a new one, but it took a day.

3) I had same day laundry service that wasn't delivered on time. I had to call down to the front desk and they couldn't find my order. Finally a few hours later they delivered it.

4) At 6AM a dog in the room next to me started barking and after 15 minutes of listening to it I called the front desk. The person at the front desk asked me in an almost confrontational tone ""What do you want me to do?"" Luckily the owner of the dog must have come back and the dog stopped barking as I was on the phone.

5) The gym has three recumbent exercise bikes. None of them worked.

6) There was a problem with the elevators and the wait times usually exceeded ten minutes.",kGeQ4tqBKDxEoWVORFNcHw,0,0,1,CHOKnETKcUF2ObuZX8gnAg

5964384,2006-11-08,0,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I'm a Westin-ite...I blame it on the ""heavenly"" beds. I've stayed in a lot of Vegas hotels over the years and my favorite's include Mandalay Bay, The Hotel, Hard Rock and The Palms during the summer months (for the pools) and the Westin for the winter months. 

I love that the Westin is concise. Everything down on the main floor seems within reach and unlike other hotels you don't have to endure a 20 minute walk to get to Starbucks, the front desk, the casino or the bar. For an ""off the strip"" hotel it's closer to the strip than some ""on the strip"" hotels....(if you don't believe me test it... walking from your room at the Westin to the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd. will for sure take less time than walking from your room at Venetian, Bellagio or Ceasars down to the strip!)

The ONE thing I disliked about this place was that the only food options were one steakhouse, roomservice and a starbucks : (",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,0,0,4,Bm1s11Ss-LnnDazhQuJdXw

What you get instead is a comfortable, quiet room with a heavenly bed, a decent gym, a terrific spa, and an overall familiar experience if you are a frequent business traveler. You don't have to wait in line for 30 minutes to check in or out, you can get a cab as soon as you are outside, and you can walk to the strip within a few blocks.

I was a bit stormy when I realized that I wouldn't be spending my ""Vegas weekend"" on the actual Las Vegas Blvd. strip.  Upon arrival I knew that it wouldn't matter.  Everyone in this hotel was amazing from the front desk associate who checked me in, to the concierge who sold me tickets, to the blackjack dealers who took my money, to the great Starbucks staff serving up Chai Tea Lattes 24/7.  This smaller hotel is located right behind the Flamingo (so you are basically on the strip) and has so much more of a sense of service than any other large hotel I could have stayed at.  It was nice to come back to a hotel that doesn't have a billion lights flashing and doesn't take an hour just to find my room.  

Stay here.  It's an $8 cab ride if you really need to go anywhere far, otherwise, everything is as walk-able as if you were on the main strip.  It has a bar, casino, food, and of course the Westin Heavenly Bed and all signature series products.  What more do you need?",PjoSwmHj3QL5U5lDtjM3KA,0,0,4,tw9BMFBGue1IUqYpxLK-Aw
5990675,2017-04-07,1,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,"I give this place one star only for the rooms themselves and the friendliness of the agent who checked me in.  That's about where the positives end. 

For one, they advertise themselves as a ""hotel, casino, and spa"". They are a hotel and casino but the spa is under construction.  That said, they still assessed us a charge for the use of their spa claiming that you could get paid spa services in your room like a massage. They did not notify customers of this on their website. Not only did they not notify me of this when I called to book the rooms (I booked over the phone because I had some questions) but, when I told them I was booking the hotel for my friend's bachelorette and that we would be using the spa, they proceeded to tell me of all the wonderful complementary spa services that were available...except they weren't because the spa, as I previously mentioned, was under construction.  When we arrived to check in to the hotel, they again told us that the spa's sauna, etc. that were available for complementary use...though they were not.  We only found out that the spa was under construction when we went in circles looking for it and could not find it.  We then saw a sign on the outside of what used to be the spa that said that it was under construction.  I was, obviously, annoyed about this and spoke to the manager who proceeded to offer one minor concession and, then upon finding out that I had paid for two rooms and that the concession should be applied to both rooms, proceeded to reduce the already minute concession she had offered.  When I went to pick up a receipt on check out, they had actually given us less than the concession promised claiming that they had to back out the tax so that the total amount of the concession plus tax equaled the amount of the concession promised. Um, no. Taxes should never have been included in the the concession.  Later, we realized that we were charged more than what was stated on our reservation so that the person who fronted the cost for the rooms was left short almost $100, that they had screwed up our billing and we are still unsure of what they did and why, and they refused to return calls inquiring about the billing issue.  This is by far the worst hotel management I have ever come across and I travel quite a bit.

Oh, also, the area around the hotel is pretty dodgy so I wouldn't recommend walking around that area on your own.",jKSTbETDvcRwseRTs9PrSA,3,0,1,bjfFYuttY3AdNA7rc8IfPg
