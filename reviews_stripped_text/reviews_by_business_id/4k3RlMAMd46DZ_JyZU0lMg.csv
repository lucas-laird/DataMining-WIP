5166,2015-10-16,1,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Recently came to this ramen spot on an impromptu ramen tour with my boyfriend when we were visiting Las Vegas. I would consider myself a ramen connoisseur of sorts. I tend to seek out new ramen spots frequently. I've been spoiled with the likes of Shin-sen-gumi and Santouka so I have standards set pretty high.

Per my fellow Yelpers positive reviews for Ramen Sora I visited to taste their ramen.

Experience as follows:

-Ambience: great spot, friendly staff. Nothing in particular stands out, typical privately owned Japanese ramen shop. We went around 2 for a late lunch, place was not full.

-Service: service was prompt and mostly friendly. I wouldn't say they went out of their way to give us great service, but I have no complaints on quality or speed of service.

-Food: we ordered the pork fried rice, shoyu ramen, and the shio ramen. We aren't particular for toppings so we usually go plain (bf) or with negi and egg (me).

*pork fried rice: it tasted great. Perfectly seasoned, great balance of pork and flavor. Rare is the day when we get a delectable side more appetizing than the main course. 

*shio ramen: broth was weak and had an undesirable aftertase. Noodles were nothing special and the seasoned egg was flavorless. I was very disappointed in the broth.

*shoyu ramen: this was my bf's meal. His words: ""it's plain"". I believe one thing that makes ramen delicious is its ability to give you complex flavors. When a broth is nothing more than dashi stock and soy sauce, you've got a problem.

Overall/last remarks: while the ramen wasn't particularly good or special, I don't think this is a bad spot. Anyone who likes to have a variety of broths/styles would come here. But for me, I'm very particular about a ramen spot to take pride in their ramen. Generally that's done when a spot takes care to perfect a particular broth or soup. When they stretch themselves too thin their ramen tends to suffer. I would recommend this place to newbies or anyone looking for a decent lunch spot.",L4l2BQapWZaEk3xTI0h9Hg,0,0,3,tfNMdLwuDvAxSfQQO8HWzA

I should have turned tail the moment we walked in - the two people with me agreed that it smelled like dirty diapers. Yes. It smelled like someone was trying to hide some sort of hideous diaper explosion that had just taken place. Cleaning chemicals barely mask the smell of fresh baby butt. I don't understand why.... or well, I didn't until our food came out and our ramen had the faint eau de diaper essence. Why? What are they using to flavor the ramen? I'm not sure if I really want to know. The only decent thing was the gyoza. Also, I don't normally leave reviews, but this place was so disappointing that I had to bust my phone out while in the middle of eating.

The reason i took away 1.5 star was because i was served my ramen hot but not pipping hot when it should be, due to this half way through the meal the broth was barely warm.   Also the tamago was over cooked.

Noodles were cooked perfectly, not as salty, more options, and the spicy miso is something that I think Will become one of those dishes you sit at home about craving. 

The place itself is... Well needs a spacial designer.  It's a horrible set up with not enough tables and a lot of open space. It's super irritating to wait when there is enough room to put in at least another 6-8 tables.  Once seated its all worth it.",P5zo78XMAvQrJys4b5N5PA,1,0,4,a3jGQV1W_9s1_rSxlFaqGw

Jan 1, 2017
* 7:12pm my elderly mother, 2 elderly aunts, myself and my fiancé arrive at the crowded restaurant on a very cold and windy night. Wrote our name on the waitlist and waited in a very confined space, blocking exits and clearly in violation of fire escape routes. 
* 7:32pm finally was able to speak to the hostess about estimated time of wait, said it would be 30-45 from our arrival time. 
* 7:58 still waiting, my mom and aunts were cold and hungry, I had my fiancé order a soft drink for them to share while we waited (our party was next to be seated) and they made him pay for the drink rather than start the dinner tab
* 8:11 finally seated after nearly an hour. Had the hostess take our order right away bc we were not going to wait for them to come back later. 
* 8:17 server brought our water to the table
* 8:48 still no food yet, no water refill, the server came to tell us our food will be coming soon. She told us the cause for delay was that they ran out of miso and had to cook a fresh batch. Aren't you a ramen restaurant??? On a busy night, shouldn't there be another batch ready at all times?
* 9:06 food finally arrives: Miso Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, and 3 Nori Miso Ramen. The food was delicious, fresh miso tasted amazing, but at this point, my family was so miserable from the long wait. No one was happy. 
* 9:08 had to go up to the counter to refill my aunt's water myself. 
* 9:12 finally get a visit from the server to ask if everything's ok. It's so moot by now, I just nodded my head so she would go away. 
* 9:15 my fiancé walks up, pays the bill, and we leave shortly after. The plan was to eat and then hit the casinos afterward, but after the exhausting wait, party plans were canceled and we came back tired, grumpy, and miserable. This restaurant ruined our only evening of our short one-night LV trip.

They specialize in Hokkaido-style miso ramen. Choice of soup base consists of shio, miso, and spicy miso. Spicy miso isn't really spicy and adds a scoop of ground pork. They use yellow ramen noodles which have a nice chew to them. It comes with a single piece of chashu which is better than most, but for a nicer treat, order the premium chashu. For an extra dollar you can get a large bowl, or two dollars for super-size. Extra toppings such as negi, nori, and menma are available for an additional cost. Prices are reasonable as long as you don't go overboard with extra toppings. Service is decent with a nice ambiance to match.

This place is fantastic. There are no words to describe how perfect the ramen is, every time. The noodles are not too firm, not too soft. The broth is expertly prepared to just the right flavor. The meat is so tender, it falls apart with a gentle tug of your chopsticks. Who could ask for anything more?

The service here is also top notch. Your soup comes out fast and just how you order it, every time. The servers are friendly and happy to explain the different types of Ramen to you if you're a first timer. I told my server I like spicy, but don't like ground meat (which is what makes their spicy Ramen bowl spicy). My bowl came out with a side of chili sauce so I could flavor it to my liking.

The place filled up fast by noon time so I'm glad we were able to get our big party seated before the rush.

After reading reviews of Monta vs. Sora, I assumed Monta ramen would be better.  Imagine my surprise when Sora ramen knocked it out of the park. The broth is quite flavorful almost too intensely salted.  The menu mentioned the capability to dilute the flavor with more broth if needed.  The noodles were my favorite - fresh, chewy consistency that was absolutely delish.  That's how real RAMEN noodles should taste! Go with the Delux to try a bit of everything.

I will admit, I'm more a fan of hakata style ramen, so I'm not too eager to go back, but I'm rating this for what it is.  
The only reason it lost a star was that their gyoza wasn't too great.  Not bad, and pretty well priced, but I've had many a plate of superior gyoza.
That said, the pork was very flavorful, the soup was very rich, the menma added some very nice flavor, the waitresses were courteous and refilled my water very quickly.  
If you're a fan of ramen, definitely give them your business, but be warned, this is northern style, so it could be a bit rich for you like it was for me.

The gyoza was good, but I didn't like the fact that you didn't have the shoyu, vinegar, and chili oil on the table to make your own gyoza dipping sauce.

Ramen Sora serves Sapporo style ramen, which is a little thicker and chewier, but I like it, it feels a little more substantial.  They have two main broths, a shio (salt) or a miso based one.  The miso broth is a little thicker, but tastes really good, especially with the pork and veggies.  The shio broth is much lighter, both in color and flavor, but as the waitress described it, it's perfect for summer.  The pork was delicious, and they don't skimp on the serving size either which is nice.

I got the deluxe bowl which pretty much comes with everything, which was a plus and minus for my first time.  I discovered that I do not care for nori in my ramen, as I didn't like how it's flavor paired with the pork.  I also thought that the hard boiled egg I had in my soup was slightly overdone, but that could just be a preference of mine.

I also got the gyoza, and just so everyone knows, it takes 8 minutes to cook, so order when you sit down or you'll end up getting them after your meal.  The gyoza were fine, crispy on one side, with a very nice dipping sauce.  They give you a ready made dipping sauce, but you can also make your own if you like.

Cons: Loud, fast- moving atmosphere so don't expect a friendly chat.
Not the best prepackaged noodles, and a tad overpriced.
Do go here if you're interested, it's worth your time. 

Long: Went here with a friend and it was good that we arrived early; they got packed quick. We were sat down, ordered our food. One of the downfalls here is that the place is small, and as it's a ramen joint, it's expected of you to eat quick and get a move on. The place is loud with chatter, and you don't have much time to really sit down and comfortably chat. 
Food arrived quick. For $11 for their special in a large, it's good proportions, but I don't see where all that money went--especially since ramen elsewhere is a budget outing. Soup was great, the meat was as tender as all hell, sides were great, BUT, the noodles weren't the best pre-packaged and that just crashed the whole deal for me. They're good, but I think the whole dish would be better with cheapy ramen noodles off the store shelf. As the main ingredient for ramen, I can't overlook that.

They don't taste anything like actual shio and shoyu ramen, which is a shame because you really can't find shio ramen in Las Vegas except at Sora.

I'm sorry that I didn't take the time to get to know you earlier, but I'd been dating another ramen house at the time and thought she was the bomb diggity. It was pretty casual and we weren't exclusive, but I finally pulled the plug when I got fed up from waiting in line EVERY time and just WASN'T GETTIN' ANY. 

I don't want you to think you were some rebound though - it was some time before I decided to stop by for a visit, but I have to admit that when I walked in and saw there weren't hordes of people jonesing for a table, I wondered if you were my type. After being seated right away though, I perused the menu and knew we'd hit it off. 

Pulling my usual first-date move, I opted for the miso ramen and it was love at first bite. Your bowl of piping hot broth housed a generous portion of noodles that was bedazzled with tender pieces of chashu pork, crispy menma bamboo shoots that snapped with every chew, nori strips for a good crackling, an egg boiled just right, and other veggie toppings. After a few more nights out with you, I came to appreciate that we could be spontaneous with each other. Sometimes I wanted a different broth, or wanted to add other ingredients like corn, butter, or extra pork. Other nights I'd be in a chashu rice bowl mood. Either way, I liked that you were always game to MIX IT UP. 

Let me know when you are ready to make it Facebook official. Text me.

Food:
We have dined here twice in the past. The first time the ramen was not hot. On our second visit we asked to make it EXTRA HOT and it was... hot enough? This time we again asked to make the soup EXTRA HOT... It was not extra hot. 

There was no steam coming off the soup. The menma (bamboo shoots) were still cold(!?). The soup was kind-of hot, but not nearly hot enough. With mostly japanese workers and japanese clientele eating Ramen you would think they would understand that the soup should be served AS HOT AS POSSIBLE. I want to use my asbestos lips and burn a few layers of skin off the roof of my mouth as is tradition when eating ramen. We told the staff and they touched our bowls to check the temperature? Weird. 

Besides the consistent temperature issues....

The chashu's dominate flavor is soy sauce. It lacks depth. The soup is rich, although plain. The noodles were simultaneously clumped and broken. It was one of the worst ramens I have had.

After sitting down, order was taken quickly, and my hot tea was topped off three times before my meal arrived.  From there, things started going downhill a bit.  I had to move myself to a different spot on the table because it was so dark, I couldn't see what was in my bowl.  

The first sip of a bowl of ramen did not trigger all those wonderful memories of good ramen experiences.  For a shio ramen, the broth was definitely lighter in texture, not unlike cup noodle soup.  I know they say it's stock from over 24 hours of boiling black pork bones.  But the taste is definitely infused with too concentrated tastes of a variety of vegies.  And the after taste hung around too long on the palates, not like the deep seated after taste from savory fats, but from something more like MSG, or concentrated condiments.  If shio ramen is oil painting, I believe they served water colors.  My tongue was confused, and thirsty from the soup, and now that I needed tea, it stopped coming.

The high notes of vegies did not stop there.  The curry curiously had a strong carrot and tomato paste taste, unlike any Japanese curry.  At the end, I had to ask the waitress, is the chef Japanese?

Like all foods made with instant condiments, or chemicals, it actually ""tastes"" pretty good.  I do not have any evidence that their food didn't go through long hours of preparation so if I have offended anyone, particularly owner or chef, I do apologize.  But I do challenge that in the tradition of a good ol' bowl of ramen, the convenience of offering customers, hey if you think it's too light we have stuff to make it heavier, or if too heavy, we have stuff to thin it down, etc perhaps is too wishy washy.

Maybe the grave is supposed to put on top and they forgot.
The menu of Ramen Sora is meaningless, it looks like they got a lot of choices, but if you pay attention and you will find out that they only have FOUR different ramen with TWO different soup bases. if you order the Shio ramen and add the topping of green onion it became Negi ramen. it applies to all the others. its really not a necessary put to different ramen with each toppings on the menu.

I didn't like not having the option of different noodles as is with many other ramen houses.  I really wish they would offer the garlic and pickled ginger on the table as well. 

As far as service, not too bad.  After we were done eating, no one came to check on us or bring our check so I had to go retrieve it after about 15 minutes. Other than that, they were friendly and had no problems with the order. 

All in all, we tried it but probably won't be going back. There are too many other ramen houses to try.",SnfOcGYcpgeWWPnjNgz1Sg,1,0,2,uEEj_bY9deNZQ7_agvXNFg

I've never had such thick ramen (in soup) before. I would say it was half as thick as udon, 2-3x as thick as ramen from Japan. I don't mind thick noodles, but the thick ramen was kinda like pasta to me. 

The eggs were overcooked. The soft-boiled egg is probably one of the most important parts of authentic ramen and they boiled them for too long! The entire yolk should be liquid, not partially.

The broth was quite salty and filled with MSG. The Miso soup was actually a little spicy, but not mentioned in the menu. To me, the shoyu and shio broth were pretty much the same.

The chashu here was probably better than Japan. In Japan, the chashu were thin, dry pieces of pork but here, the chashu were thick and tender. Probably the only thing I actually liked from this place.

  I had the worst haircut of my life at This place! and I was so upset and pissed off that in a moment of rage I cursed the place!  Mario went out of business and so did all the business that followed him after that. I've seen restaurants in this locale come and go and even though I never tried any of the previous restaurants I think is time for me to finally return to the place of occurrence, besides what's the worst they could do? ruin my lunch? They can't ruin my hair anymore, not even Mario, most of it is gone! so after all this years, I walked into the place again...

 Ramen Sora brings the traditions and recipes of Sapporo Japan, they take their ramen very seriously making the stock by boiling bones for almost a day. ( not the three minute wait that I was used to.) the decor is minimalist but functional since the place is kind of small every square inch is taken advantage of, atmosphere is very relaxing and you feel like you are seating with the rest of the other customers because everyone is so close but do not worry enjoy your ramen and slurp freely! ( my neighbor did) The always smiling waitress Taeko, recommended me the shio ramen which ended up being surprisingly good, it was light and not too fatty, although I wish they had seafood ramen but hopefully in the future they'll expand the menu to more choices. They will also be serving alcohol in the near future, and I can attest to that since I was in the same hearing (for a different matter) when the owner asked for permission in front of the board, and it was approved!
I'm glad Ramen Sora is the new resident of 4490 spring mountain, I was always afraid another massage place would take over like all my other favorite places in the area. I really liked the food and the service and I believe this place will be here for years to come.

The service was great. Waters were refilled in a timely manner. Food came out fairly quickly.

On to the food. We started with the osumami platter, which didn't have any flavors that stood out. Chashu was well made though. Melt in your mouth good combined with a smidgen of char. The Ramen was a situational type of food for me. The broth is very thick, so you're in a bind trying to reach the bottom of the bowl. While the first few bites are good, the next few bites get really heavy. Perfect for a cold winter night or even a sick day, but you'll definitely feel fatigued eating this in the summer. To balance out the heaviness, I added a bit of curry to my broth. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the aroma and the balance that the curry provides. It is an excellent pairing.

Thankfully, my party of 7 came here at a good time and was able to get seated fairly quickly. Just be wary that if you do come here with a big party, it is a very small place. 

I liked that their menu was simple and didn't have an overabundance of options. Typically, I have high expectations if a place has a small menu because they should be specializing and perfecting in those dishes. I ordered the Deluxe Sora Ramen. However, I never got to taste it, and here's what happened:

Me and two other people in my party ordered the same thing, but instead we were brought out the Killer Ramen (their spiciest ramen) which was previously called Screaming for Vengeance, I believe. When we brought this to the waitress' attention she said ""no, this is what you all ordered"" to which then proceeds to show us her notebook of what she wrote and justify the situation...Um, okay there's 7 of us here and we all heard each other order Deluxe Sora. Instead of trying to fix the situation, she kept justifying herself and said, ""well, I repeated the order and asked you if you were sure you wanted a large.."" First, we didn't hear her. Second, we later found out why she asked if we were sure...because the Killer Ramen is extremely spicy. Be more specific about what you are trying to confirm. We just stared at the mistakes cause it wasn't what we wanted, and she just star
ed at us like she didn't want to try to fix it, so I got frustrated and said we'll just keep the mistakes. Thankfully, I handle spicy food very well (my friends claimed so too) and the ramen tasted yummy, but 2 minutes into it, they were drenched from sweating. Yep, make sure you mean it when you say you can handle spicy. I felt bad for them.

Lastly, we asked the check to be split four ways, and the waitress gave us a dirty look and said ""why don't you guys just split it 2 ways"". Well, obviouslyyy we're grouped up differently, so it's easier for us to pay that way. I wish this was a biased judgement of how the waitress treated us, but everyone in my party noticed it too.

I'll be back for a second try with an updated review since the ramen was good, but I couldn't fully enjoy it. I hadn't eaten all day and the killer ramen killed my stomach...",uuscKYelhweXn_fLVtcf5A,4,2,3,cg41PzYjKxF7FgnuSe6okg

As many have mentioned, Ramen Sora is on a par with Monta Ramen.  The shop is easy to find and is spacious... though part of this spaciousness comes not from the actual square footage of the shop, but because the interrior is designed in such a way that there is considerable open (and wasted space in the middle.

One thing that Monta had going for it is the variety if menu items other than Ramen, like Cha-han (fried rice), etc. But when it comes to Ramen, I think that Ramen Sora rises above Monta.

My wife and I went on a Monday afternoon, around 2 pm. There was no long wait list, though by 2:40 pm, there was 4 or 5 groups waiting for seats. Once seated, and order taken, the food came out quickly. I ordered the signature Deluxe Sora Ramen, Miso flavor, and my wife had the Shoyu Ramen.

What I think sets Sora above Monta for me is the broth.  The broth at Sora is not too salty, gentle, yet complex flavor. My tonkotsu miso broth had very gentle flavors, with almost a peanutty aroma. I was able to finish the whole broth without feeling it being too salty. My wife's Shoyu broth was the same way. You could taste the pork bone broth, hint of shoyu, a bit of sweetness and some herbs.  Very nice.  I find Monta's broth to be too salty at times.

The tonkotsu broth at Sora is on the very light (not thick) kind which is very refreshing.

The noodle is medium thick wavy noodle with sufficient chweyness.  I give it a 10 out of 10.

The cha-shu is melt in your mouth tender, though this is where I felt a bit excess of saltiness. Still very very good.

We also had the gyoza which is very good also. Tender filling, lots of juice, and again, not too salty... in fact you could really taste the sweetness...

That is my only gripe. 

We were promptly served water and the refills kept on coming. We ordered two sides of the seared pork belly which were delicious and I would highly recommend. I went with the Chashu Ramen and added corn with the shoyu (soy sauce) base. My husband ordered the Corn Butter Ramen with the miso (fermented bean paste) base. The portions were great and there was double the pork belly than what I have found at Monta. I generally opt for the tonkotsu (pork) base, so this was new to me but nevertheless extremely flavorful and delicious. The noodles are a bit on the harder side than at Monta, but I quickly grew to like it.

After the incident, the next day my husband, daughter, and myself were sick with stomach issues which I can most likely say the food from this place contributed to it. 

I called and spoke to the manager the very next day and explained how all of us were sick. She immediately referred me to speak to their insurance company and still did not offer me any type of refund. Like really? She can't handle it herself, she has to push it off on someone else in their ""insurance company"". This sets off a red flag with me, it makes me think how many times this has happened for her to have the insurance company information readily available for me to call...

I just found out from another yelper a couple days ago, Ramen Sora's health grade has been recently been decreased to a C from an A. If you now anything about the food business, you will know that takes ALOT of violations /demerits for that to happen.

I ordered the regular spicy miso ramen and it was plenty for me. The spice level was perfect for me but forbmy friend who eats spicy food ""sometimes""  it was too spicy. It came with one large slice of pork, spicy ground pork, half egg and bamboo shoots. The broth was delicious and the meat was so tender.

1947544,2012-09-11,4,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"I've been station in Southern Japan for about 3 years. Didnt really appreciated my duty station nor the host country as much as i should have but Ramen is one thing you could count on when you just squandered your paycheck at the bar and you're tired of eating at the mess hall.

I remember my first time at a Ramen house in Hiroshima...From the outside looking in through a foreigner's eyes what caught me was the wax display bowls of noodles through some glass. It looked good enough and i was hungry as hell so why not. I dont remember the name of the place, most likely because i cant read nor do i understand Japanese but the wax bowls was good enough. Ordering was a bit of a pain as i had to leave my seat, walk with the waitress over to the display and point at what i wanted but when it came out...WOW. The broth was rich i mean REALLY rich, the noodles were firm and chewy and slices of pork were perfect. Perfect both in taste and meat to fat ratio.

Ramen Sora doesnt exactly replicate the same taste or sensations but then again how could i expect them to? The perfect replication of New York style pizza has to go as far as it analyze NY tap water and recreate it to even begin to mimic the crust. Do I expect Ramen Sora to hire a bunch of scientists to cough up an exact mineral analysis of Japanese tap water in order to recreate authentic ramen in Las Vegas? Well yes but when that comes i wont complain about paying over 20 dollars for a bowl.

Long story short, compared to other ramen houses which i will not name (completely dedicated to ramen not 'oh look they have ramen on the menu even though they specialize in Japanese import auto repairs'), Ramen Sora is as close as i'm gonna get without going back to Japan. 

Compared to what i remember of authentic Japanese Ramen, Sora is a bit on the bland side but their menu choices as well as optional sides well make up for it. The pork they use is so damn close it's almost scary to me.

So far i've had the Miso broth and it was damn good if not a little bland due to personal preference, and that didnt stop me from devouring the entire bowl.

I would definitely go back to try out the other broths and HIGHLY recommend this place as well as return to in the winter when it gets colder.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,7,5,4,wwBvbudfmZIweSHZGVbu5g

Monta and Sora are the only ramen places from Vegas featured on Ramen Festival in LA and Vegas. Rightfully so because both are awesome. (Didn't get to go to Ramen Fest though.)

Got the deluxe sora ramen, regular size, miso, for my first visit. BF isn't a fan, so he got the large curry bowl. His came out first, and it was just right- large portion for the price ($6.50), flavors were spot on and it was definitely comfort food. He inhaled the dish. My broth was rich and delish, the chashu pork plentiful and flavorful, and the bamboo, nori, and egg really complemented one another. Noodles were plentiful and nicely chewy, but slightly thinner than expected, given that someone told me they were thick? Guess we have different expectations. I am bummed that I only get half of a (usually overcooked) egg in my ramen here.

I am from southern California where there are at least 50 ramen shop and I have to admit this is my favorite place. Here's why:

Service- there is usually a 10-15 minute wait because it is popular and good. The waiters are very nice and the food comes out in a timely manner.

Food- this is what I want to talk about. The broth is flavorful and not salty. I usually order the number one and they are generous with their meat, it comes with four pieces. The noodles are a perfect consistency. Ugh I am craving it right now as I write this.

Price-reasonable. $10 for the special which comes with seaweed, egg, mushroom, and meat. They also offer large for a dollar extra and xl for two dollars. They are pretty generous with their portions. I struggle to finish a large and I find the regular size to be perfect.

2234986,2012-02-21,3,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"The Skinny: finally! a really decent ramen house in Las Vegas! I would pass on the dessert though (4) service: went during the first week of opening, a little disorganized but it's still pretty good given the Japanese efficiency (3) value: it's not bad as long as you don't order extra toppings which seem relatively pricey (4).

We came here opening week to try out their miso ramen and within a few days, we were back for more. It was really reassuring to hear a bunch of Japanese spoken in this joint by both the customers and the staff. You know that likely this stuff can't be that far from legit.

Here's the menu items we have tried so far: miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, mini chasu bowl, premium chasu side order and a order of their mochi dessert. 

Breakdown of the broths: the underlying broth has a robust, decadent pork flavour to it. Throw in the miso ($7.50) or spicy miso, you have a well balanced bowl of homey goodness. The spicy miso ($8.50) adds a judicious amount of heat to round out the taste without detracting from the underlying taste of the soup. Very subtle and well done. I think of the three broths, spicy miso might be my favourite.

The noodles are in the standard ramen style and cooked perfectly. Slightly thicker than your standard fare, I really loved the mild chewiness of the noodle which speaks to its freshness. Really, a mouth full of joy.

The egg was ramen perfection - hard boiled with a thin layer of soy permeating on the outside, a precise ratio of cooked to runny yolk on the inside. Loved it. Could have eaten at least three of those eggs alone.

If there is a weakness in the bowl, it's with the chasu. Even though the chasu does have a good texture and flavour, it could be a little bit more melt in the mouth. A little too thinly sliced for my liking, it is worth the upgrade for a few extra slices ($2) to make a more satisfying meal.

If it's your first time here, I wouldn't recommend getting a menma ramen ($8.50) or a corn/butter ramen ($9). Considering the price of these additions to the regular bowl, it's rather expensive factoring in the relative cost of the product. I mean, really, $1 for extra green onion? You can buy 3 bunches of that in the Chinese grocery store across the street. Stick to the extra chasu and maybe the tamago if you're an egg fan - you won't be disappointed.

We did try the premium chasu side order but was rather disappointed that it was served stone cold with some congealed fat on it. That certainly detracted from the texture of the product and I would not recommend ordering it.

Instead, get an side order of the mini chasu bowl ($2.85). The chasu, cut into chunks, is layered with negi (Japanese green onion) over rice with a light sprinkle of the marinating soy broth. Very stick to your ribs kind of food and highly satisfying. The chasu fared better in this instance given the way that it was served but again was not quite the perfect texture. Regardless, given the price, it's really worth a try.

Finally, the dessert. We tried their mochi balls filled with red bean and rolled in black sesame ($2). Given the great quality of the dishes here, it really fell flat in comparison. While the filling was okay, the mochi itself was overly dry. I'd pass on this menu item because there are so many other great things to fill your belly with.

Overall, I'm so happy that this place opened because we used to drive all the way out to LA to get a half-decent bowl of ramen. Now my husband can spare me the 4 hour drive there and satisfy his cravings at Ramen Sora (4).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,5,4,EvpMvo9XUWGdduV4RULNJw

At first, the look of the spicy ramen does not look appetizing. But once you taste it, you totally forget about that.  

It's very meaty and you can fee the liquified fat in your mouth and boy does it taste good.  The egg could have used a little more marinating but it want bad.  You could tell the noodles were house made.  They tasted so fresh and so good.  Chewy just like you like in ramen noodles.

It was very tasty, but not spicy.  The ramen noodles were nicely cooked.  Very hot broth, which I hear is a requirement.  The broth was also very tasty, but fatty.  It's pork based (by boiling black pork bones, to be specific) and I could see the oil floating in it.  But that's not a bad thing.

The ramen came with two pieces of pork, an egg, green onions... there was some ginger in there... it was hard for me to identify all the goodness.  The pork was so delicious.  The egg was perfectly cooked.  The thing I like best is that it was not as salty as Monta.  I didn't wake up in the middle of the night to chug a gallon of water.  Oh, and their spoons have little notches that keep them from falling into your soup.  It's the little things that count with me.

I also tried Kurogoma dango for dessert which was mochi balls stuffed with red bean paste and rolled in black sesame.  Three for $2.  Delicious!

It was about half full when I went - pretty good for opening night.  Service was fast and friendly.  I also like their hours, 11:30am to 11:00pm everyday - very convenient and easy to remember.  It's close to my work and I like that I can get a ramen craving at 3pm and get it taken care of.

Four stars for now because they don't serve beer yet.  Ramen without beer can be a little depressing.  But they have Sapporo listed on the menu, Sapporo glasses, and Sapporo paraphernalia all over the place, so it's only just a matter of time.  Also, if my husband gives it his seal of approval, I'll bump it up - beer or no beer.  Looking forward to many visits to this great find.

Ramen Sora is the benchmark of this resurgence of Ramen. It is no longer just the dry brick of fried noodles you try to cram into your hotel room coffee maker.

I'll just go ahead and say it: Monta Ramen is salty. I never finish their broth, and I feel like I need to eat their noodles just to counter the salt and the odd viscosity of their soup base (too thick). Just like Pho Kim Long, Monta Ramen is the celebrity chef/critic favorite for what seems to be no valid reason. Maybe they pay their PR agencies the best - I don't know. It's 'cool' to like Monta Ramen. Well that sucks, because Ramen Sora is King. And Monta Ramen is that mean Prince who tries to trick the good Prince but ends up dying in the end trying to do so, and the crowd cheers!

At Ramen Sora I get the Nori Miso Ramen every time (w/Large Size upgrade for +$1.) There are times when I polish off 2/3rds of the broth before slurping a single noodle. It's that good.

I have the same thought as i saw their chasu cut in a big chuncks of pork and the color so dark. I took the very little chunck of chasu that i could saw to give it a try. Oisy!!! Very tasty!!! It's super soft and melt in my mouth.

I missed the broth. Their pork broth is very good. I would say it similar with daikokuya. Their broth is not smell at all even though so thick of koteri.

My choice for dinner was the miso ramen deluxe (large size, because hey, who am I trying to fool right?). The broth was divine. Such a complexity of flavor, and just enough to keep the soup-to-noodle ratio perfect. The noodles themselves were the consistency that ramen should be; slightly chewy and smooth and slurpable. The deluxe comes with charsiu, which is sweet pork. Sora's is thick-cut, very juicy and not at all dry like it is at some restaurants. Then there were pieces of nori (seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), negi (green onion), and a boiled egg. The menu offers plain versions of the ramen dishes for those who prefer a more simplistic approach, but I enjoyed everything that was going on in that bowl.

However, for their Miso Ramen, which is another traditional Sapporo (Hokkaido) style soup, I've had better ones in my days.  I can actually make a better one myself.  Cha-shu was very thick and not very tender, but it tastes good and it's homemade; so, I don't mind that.  Everyone has their own style of making cha-shu, and I have fun trying them all.  I love pork. LoL  

I also like spicy food, so, on one occasion I was brave enough to try their ""Spicy Killer Ramen.""  It looks awfully good in the menu, but it sounds like a soup made from habanero, so I was always reluctant to try it.  I asked the waitress how spicy it is, and she said very, very, very spicy.  'Is it more spicy than kimchee?' I asked.  She replied 'It's much, much more spicy.""  So, I got the idea.  She recommended me ordering a regular size, but, I went with the large size sho-yu base.

The killer ramen came to the table, and it looks very appetizing, and it smells good.  Before I dug into it, I sipped and tasted the soup.  It was delicious!  But..., made my eyes tear.  The level of ""spicy"" was way off my scale.  The bad part was that it tastes good.  I thought it was their best ramen there.  I just couldn't quit!  I finished it all and drank more than a half of the soup.  The guy sitting right in front of me was just cracking up watching me tear and sweat and suffering from the torture.  Yes, I knew..., I knew I was going to regret it the next day in the bathroom.

If you're really hungry you may want to add extra chashu or get a large.  Some bowls come with more meat than others so it does depend on what you order.  

They can get very crowded and it's small inside so I wouldn't recommend going during busy hours.  For lunch, arriving around 2 pm seems to work fine.  

I wouldn't recommend taking home leftovers unless you plan to eat it near immediately.  I've taken home leftovers twice now and when I ate it the next day, not only did the broth separate (which looked disgusting), it also tasted weird.",TsEE8dZYoAa-Tzzem3yjRw,2,3,5,hr1Hcz3AnHsFm0uffufsrQ

Well first even when Ramen Sora is busy you only have to wait about 20 minutes give or take a few. This is far better than Monta's wait times. Second, the atmosphere is Ramen Sora is more preferred over Monta's cramped, crowded, and extremely loud atmosphere. While at Ramen Sora I have never felt rushed and have always had friendly servers that kept my water filled and made sure I enjoyed my meal. Lastly, I have never had to play the hide and seek parking game that you have to endure when you go to Monta. Ramen Sora has plenty of parking around the back and even if that becomes full there are spaces available to park on the side street. Now as far as the ramen goes, the broth is a rich and creamy pork broth that is bursting with flavor. I always order the Miso Ramen that comes with slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and a soft boiled egg on top of a bed of noodles. Prices are fantastic here and you can always add extra toppings or supersize your bowl for only a few extra dollars. Also they have Kirin on draft for cheap! a large 24 oz is only $5.

2472855,2015-03-03,3,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Man, I wanted to be able to say this place doesn't deserve five stars. The waitress really pissed me off. So I'm going to vent about their bullshit and then tell you how they still got five stars.

So we showed up about thirty minutes before opening and there was still a line of about 6 parties ahead of us. Now We were a group of six and there was one big party ahead of us. The rest were broken up into smaller groups. It was a Saturday so one would figure they'd have enough staffing for the rush.

Fast forward to getting seated. The host had seated the large group in their one seating area. A portion of the restaurant was blocked off because apparently they couldn't handle it due to limitations on staff. Pairs were seated in areas that could have easily turned into 4, 6, and 8 tops but because of the odd distribution of parties, there were no tables to combine without moving folks. They split us into a party of four and two. We did say that was okay.

When we sat, asked the folks at the table next to us if it would be a big deal if we switched our two for the two of them. They were very quick to oblige. It wasn't that long after we sat down that this happened, we hadn't even ordered.

So we called the waitress over who proceeded to chew us out and say that it would be ""too complicated"" for the kitchen and that they wouldn't allow it. 

Look, I get it. It doesn't make life easy when people like us do that. We could have just said we would wait longer for a large table (it would have been an additional 20-30 minutes based off of how long the big table moved out). What pissed me off was the rudeness and the fact that they could have avoided this situation with proper staffing. At a Japanese restaurant no less. I expect more from them.

I think I could just stop my review here. I mean, they pissed me off and I'm still giving FIVE stars. The ramen is that good. It's a hearty, rich tonkotsu broth. The noodles are a little thicker (not Hakata style) and have a nice chewiness to them. Great job on the eggs, the chashu is amazing. Gyoza and fried rice both complimented the ramen. Trust me, it's good.

Here's an insider tip though. As a man who loves miso ramen... order it with butter. It goes really well. But this is my trick. Instead of completely mixing it into the broth, I wrap the butter with the hot noodles. This allows you to have the broth plain to start and then you can pull from the noodles when you want the buttery flavor. As you get further in, it becomes richer.

It may sound crazy but believe me, it's flippin' delicious.

You all know what I'm talking about anyway.  This review is a comparison review.  Sorry, but it's the only way I know to review a ramen joint at this time, and Ramen Sora holds it's own!

The building is a lot more spacious than the other ramen place.  It's more comfortable.    There's also not a 15 minute wait.  In this case, that's a good thing.  Like the other ramen place, service is fast, friendly, and professional.

I ordered the spicy miso with extra chashu.  The broth was very flavorful!  Much more savory than the other ramen place.  A lot less salty.  The spiciness had only a little kick (I eat a lot of very hot Thai food though), but it was enough to give a well rounded flavor to this thick, tasty broth.  If you have a problem with the salt levels of the other ramen place, this might be your go to restaurant.  The noodles were better, I thought.  They were thicker, and ""meatier"".  Very well prepared.  The chashu was tender as if it had been soaking in broth all day.  It fell apart in my chopsticks.  Yum.  The chashu slices were a little thicker than the other ramen place, although perhaps not quite as tender.  

I may dare to say that the overall quality of the ingredients is a little higher here than the other ramen place.  It definitely has a more bold flavor profile, at least in the miso.  I love both places, really, which should say a lot about Ramen Sora.  The bottom line here is that Ramen Sora has added a new flavor to this town, and it is worth while to check out.  It may not become your favorite ramen house in town, but I think it is definitely a great addition.  Thank you, Ramen Sora!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,12,7,5,fhI90ZxrZ7szfuJu0afogw

     It boils down to personal preference. Sapporo peeps will love Ramen Sora for its chewy noodles and its seasoned miso broth.  And though this goes against the general tide, I'd have to say I am a Kyushu or Kurume sistah.  
 
THE MEAT: 
    There are a couple of popular types of Japanese Ramen named after their region/city of origin, 2 of which are now big players in the Vegas scene - Kyushu, or more specifically Kurume ramen (served in Monta Ramen) and Sapporo (served in Ramen Sora).  There are differences in the preparation and quality of broth and noodles, but both places offer the same general toppings - thin slices of roasted pork, egg, green onion, corn and bamboo shoots or wood ear mushroom.
     I can't give a review of Ramen Sora without comparing it to Monta Ramen, which was my first love.  The noodles are curly and chewier, and although I liked the soft thin strands of Monta, I enjoyed the bite of Sora very much.  The Sora miso broth is generously seasoned, and I believe the red specks are Togarashi, red pepper flakes that are available on your table - it has a very distinct flavor, somewhat smoky and a tad tangy.  The Sora broth was more complex, and maybe I'll like it more once I am accustomed to it.  
     For now, the foodie prude in me misses the conservative broth in Monta, rich in meat and egg flavors... and though the broth may get cloying, I love the no fuss straight up lard goodness. All in all, both ramens rock, and will cure any hangover and hit your spot. 

I'M STILL DIGESTING...
     How some folks expect a toddler to go out of their way instead of them accommodating a 2 year old.  Which do you think is the easier task?

2749340,2014-02-14,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Before I give you my opinion about Ramen Sora, let me give you some insite into Japanese ramen. There are many different styles of ramen in Japan just like there are many different styles of pizza in America! Many people I speak with will say that Monta Ramen is way better than Ramen Sora. However, that's an unfair judgement because they are different styles and come from different regions of Japan. Ramen Sora reflects more of a Northern Japanese style ramen using miso, shio, or soyu broth with thicker noodles. The ramen you get at Monta is a tonkotsu style which is a richer pork broth generally using thinner noodles. 

With that said, Ramen Sora is pretty good when it comes to their ramen. I would recommend the Miso out of all the broths as it tastes rich with flavor. 

The reason I gave them 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 is because I feel that their chashu pork fall a little short. Japanese ramen style chashu takes a lot of skill to prepare correctly. If it's done right, it should just melt in your mouth. Ramen Sora's chashu is very tender but i'd say it fall behind Monta's chashu. A few reasons why I think their chashu is not perfect is because they do not roll their slab of pork belly when preparing it. This causes more moisture to escape from the pork during the cooking process. You'll notice Monta's pork is rolled and melts in your mouth. 

So all in all I give Ramen Sora a 4/5. Not bad for ramen found in desert!..and incase you were wondering, yes I am Japanese! Happy Eating Folks!",qZtd5SDe6xoQQ8DEhHANvw,3,2,4,NAbb6k8pnQd9dfO6mQ8QVQ

I got the corn butter ramen with the shio base, and the main note in the aroma was reminiscent of just straight hot cat pee. I was gagging before I took one bite of noodle, but in the interest of being, you know, brave and well rounded and all that, I was committed to trying at least one bite of noodle. I found the noodles to be gummy/tacky and almost stale tasting. 

My husband, on the other hand, hand the shoyu base and he thought his was excellent.

Some pros for Ramen Sora:
-Broth is really, really rich
-I prefer their Chasu rice bowls over Monta Ramen (they even come in mini sizes)
-Gyoza are always cooked well
-Tables are easily moved for large or small parties
-A couple of TVs if you really want to catch a game

The restaurant is incredible. The soup is superb. The pork broth, all thick and marrowy, is beyond compare. The slices of pork in the soup melt in your mouth, and I don't mean in that in the figurative sense. I mean that if you were to live in some culinary fantasy land where you could cross breed a pig and a stick of butter, this is the texture its meat would be. They aren't stingy with the portions at all... unless you're downright starving or sharing with someone, ordering a large is completely unnecessary.

The meat in the bowls is flavorful and has a little more texture than Monta's.

If you had to pick one of the two famous ramen shops in Vegas, I highly recommend this one. Has more room, more flavor in the food, and bigger portions. Also, there is a really big table that can accommodate a party of eight or more.

The only weird comment I have is if you sit along the wall. It's right against the exterior, and I don't think it's insulated well- it's like sitting on a slab of rock in a Japanese hot spa since it's really warm on your butt and back. While consuming hot soup during the summer, this leads to a toasty experience, but the food is great, so I would make sure you get a glass of ice water with it and wear a tank top, and you'll be fine. ;)",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,7,3,5,NVgljqg6irviH_VLsXhcOQ

I have to say, Monta and Sora has their own specialty and tastes. But Sora's broth seems a lot less salty than Monta Ramen.",hxNPDc02kWm_eIW1NmozJw,1,1,5,o6G3qrAwf7y29T1CW_1lAg

After our multiple returns to Ramen Sora, my little family still haven't been disappointed with the food nor their service.  I've also noticed that my family from Hawaii always sends me a picture whenever they come here as well so that's always a good sign.

I usually order the large spicy miso ramen when it's my first meal, but sometimes I'll just order the regular if this is our second meal while my son goes for the extra large killer spicy miso ramen.  This was my nephew's first time here so he went all out and ordered the extra large killer deluxe miso ramen.  I actually felt kind of bad watching him suffer, but he wouldn't admit that he was having a hard time finishing his order.  

I wasn't sure whether it was because he ordered too much noodles or if it was too spicy for him, but I wasn't going to ask the kid anything that would make him break down and cry.  After he finally finished his ramen, he said he really liked it.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,14,15,5,z-iNcVnisUD3vLZjqeGCAg

We all got their number 1 which came with 3 pieces of chasu (pork), 3 pieces of seaweed, some bamboo shoots and half an egg. We all got different broths. They have salt, soy sauce and a miso broth. What I like about this place is that you can ask for light broth, which makes it less salty. I don't usually eat ramen because I don't like salty things but their salt broth (less flavor/salt) was perfect! I thought the noodles were perfectly cooked. However, while they gave us enough meat, the pork I felt was a bit tough. It wasn't as soft as I'd like.

Our server was friendly but she got too busy to check up on us after we got our food and didn't stop by until after we finished everything. My friend went to the cashier to put in an order to go. For 2 regular number 1s & 2 large number 1s, the total came out to be $45 before tip.

One factor that I appreciate about Ramen Sora is that they offer spicy ramen.  The broth in the spicy ramen is delicious!  I'm mainly just disappointed in the noodle.  The atmosphere is quieter than your average ramen house, which was refreshing. : ) They use plastic chopsticks here, so if you aren't a pro-chopstick guru, ask for a fork.

Wow! It did not disappoint. I got a regular size but I could have easily finished a large. The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles were nicely cooked. The chasu melted in my mouth. Lots of fatty content on the chasu. Very delicious and well worth a try. I usually don't drink all my broth but I almost finished all of this one.

Within minutes the place was packed with several parties waiting. We may have been the only non Jap party there.

The ramen offers miso or shio soup - no tonkatsu but they do offer a spicy option. We ordered the Delux Shio Ramen which came with 3 pieces of chashu, egg, manma, nori, and chives. In addition we ordered the Spicy Miso.  The noodles were perfectly cooked al dente and had the perfect bite.  The noodles are similar to the texture of the Miso Ramen at Monta, not the thinner noodles from their Tonkatsu. I ordered both broths to see if they offered more noodle selections but it seems they offer one. Nevertheless I prefer thick cut.  Both of the broths were super rich and full of flavor. 

The kurogoma dango dessert was decent - u could tell it was made at least a day in advance. With the consistent flow of business, maybe they can make it fresh daily and it would def be better. 

So is it better than Monta? I would say no but I always order the Tonkatsu and enjoy the intimacy and atmosphere. But it's definitely a competitor and I'm all for more ramen offerings!",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,4,1,4,CyHavHhxg603oUpk8MJq3g

Also, we asked for soy sauce because my friend ordered the chashu pork bowl, and the waitress said they didn't have soy sauce. That's unusual for an Asian venue.

(I saw some people waiting outside, so I'm glad we didn't have to wait.)

We started with a couple orders of Gyoza ($3.85) which I enjoyed. So much so that I ate more than half of one order! For my bowl, I got the Spicy Ramen ($8.50) with Shio Base (Salt) and added Corn (+$1). I was actually debating getting the Killer Spicy Ramen since I love heat, but we drank so much in the morning, I didn't think my stomach could handle it. I was kinda bummed after I got my bowl as I didn't think it was spicy at all. The broth did have good flavor and the noodles a nice chew. If you're a big meat eater, I'd suggest adding 2 Pcs Pork Belly Chashu ($2.35), Spicy Meat (+$1), or the Killer Spicy Meat (+$1.50). Or all three if you're super hungry. We also got a couple pitchers of Kirin Draft at $11.50 each. If you have multiple people drinking, it's best to get a pitcher as a large glass is $5. Way better deal.

All I want is a regular bowl of ramen please, miso broth, extra nori, no egg, green onions please.... OH WAIT. and I'd like a Kirin please!  Oh! A small order of gyoza (small order = 6 pieces)

Broth tasty! HOT! Steamy Hot! The way all ramen bowls should be served. And the noodles? OMG... if there is such a thing as al dente chewy! (exactly as I like it) is what I got.  

Of all the ramen shops on Spring Mountain  Blvd.? This is a definite must try. 

Note: depending on the time and day you try to dine - you might have a wait period... I assume that because of the sign in sheet as well as the chairs in the waiting area....",fHqt_c3oDQ4ZWFzeOo4ezA,16,16,4,WdEuwFxLFLFVLdVFh585CA

I live in Chinatown and Vegas has a lot of ramen spots but you have never tasted good ramen until you come to Ramen Sora! So authenticly good! Service is always great but my favorite server is SANI! She remembered after only my first visit and always makes sure to say hi even if she's not my server. 

The deluxe Ramen is the way to go with miso based soup and you can ask for it to be made with low salt! The portion sizes are the largest in town and the flavor is a blast of delicious goodness. The ramen noodles are the perfect thickness and crinkly curly. The chashu slices are large and juicy never dry or too fatty. You get way more ingredients in your soup than other places and they don't charge much for add ons.
Expect to wait at least 20mins because  there is always a line but this place is well worth it and Foodie approved! You won't ever leave hungry and it's not too pricey.",cYXPnVBFmggagWbE3jYXKw,0,0,5,r1GD6w1_d6wAfrjbI3TcIw

Ramen Sora was insane. I can't remember what time we arrived, but I'm thinking it was around 6:30 and there were already a million people waiting in their tiny lobby area. By the time we were seated nearly an hour later, I was ready to eat the table!

I had the shio ramen and a mini chashu bowl (see, I told you I was starving!). I think the serving size of ramen here is a little on the small side (possibly because I was starving). I think they have three sizes - regular, large and extra large. Unless you are a light eater or you're going to get something else, I would probably go with the large next time. Their ramen was pretty good and I really like the chashu. Actually, I think they were rationing their chashu because my dad tried to order the chashu ramen and was told they don't have it today.

I quickly found that out after having dinner here with some fellow Yelpers. This was my first time having ramen that didn't come out of a wrapper with a little packet of seasoning...and yes, I'm a fan. A huge fan!

So, we came in here for dinner on a Friday night. From what I read in reviews, I was surprised to see that we got seated so quickly. It's actually a good thing that we did because by the time we were done, there was a line out the door. This is a really small restaurant with limited seating, so if you plan to come here, get there early and give yourself a better chance of avoiding the rush

Since this was my first time eating ramen, I felt like a kid asking all our more experienced Yeeps what everything was. What's a miso? Corn and butter? Hard boiled eggs? I had no idea what was going on and while that menu is only a single two-sided sheet, there's no shortage of options. If you've never been to ramen, I definitely suggest going with someone who has for your first time. 

After much thought and questioning, I found out the Miso is kind of like the ""safe"" option and decided on Spicy Miso. Wow, this stuff is delicious! The noodles are plentiful and cooked perfectly, the pork is tender and having that egg in there is so good. But the best part of it all is that broth. It's rich and is so, so flavorful. I literally wanted to pick the bowl up and drink it cereal style...it really is that good!

Let me just say, if you were questioning yourself on trying a ramen spot, stop and come straight to Ramen Sora. I may not have much experience in ramen but I can tell you this place is worth the visit and I can't wait to come back!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,8,6,4,cJpXOYp3FWreyZ2NndEP-Q

   I usually order the Deluxe Ramen Sora with the Miso broth.  The broth has a good depth to it and you can tell it took them some time to get it to be so tasty.  The Chasu is very tasty and plentiful.  It is so tender and not as fatty as other spots in Vegas.  I like the fact the Deluxe Ramen incudes an egg.  The egg to me is an integral part of Ramen and theirs is perfect and a great addition to the Ramen.

The menu isn't that big, but they have different items to fulfill everyone's craving. If you want normal favored miso to extreme spicy, they got it!  The pricing for the items on the menu are also pretty reasonable.

My favorite thing about this place? They don't close midday! This was one of the few ramen spots in Vegas that was a decently priced and open! 

We also found this place through Yelp, thanks!

Going back to what I said earlier, YES. EVERYTHING IS GOOD! My BF and I were so hungry, we ordered a number of things: the Mini Chasu bowl, the Mini Curry Bowl, the Nori Ramen, and my BF being a huge spice lover, he got the Screaming for Vengeance Ramen.

The pork in the mini Chasu was soooo tender. Each bite literally fell apart and it was sooooo good. It almost felt like it was melting in my mouth, super duper good! Also, my most FAVORITE dish here had to be the mini curry bowl. I'm a sucker for Japanese curry. If I knew how delicious this was gonna be I should have just ordered than instead! 

As far as the ramen goes, the portions are super huge and the broth was really flavorful!

I know growing up my family always salted their food.  But shoot that's why health problems run in the family; high blood pressure peoples...

However, the ramen NOODLES seemed a lot more chunkier and the texture was nice.  So I like the noodles and the soft egg.  Everything else was too salty, like it left a burn feeling - maybe my lips were already mummifying.

Customer service is quick.  They're all nice!  But also busy its difficult to make eye contact to get their attention.  When the crowd slowed a bit, they offered water when we finished our green teas.  Much needed water!

I do not know if this place can be found in Southern California, but when I went to Vegas for the first time last week, I was blessed by this place. I recommend those who go to Vegas for fun to stop here. The ramen fixed my hangover!! 

Parking: A small parking lot, but we were lucky to find a spot right away! Not sure how it is usually since it was my first time here. 

Appearance: When my friends and I first drove up to the place, my initial reaction was: the outside looks like a shack. I had high expectations of this place because my friends kept saying this ramen place was really good. I took a deep breath and walked inside....and it was pretty cool. The feel felt...welcoming? It.is a very small ramen shop, but it didn't really bother me. People aren't elbow to elbow or anything and the place was perfectly clean, roomy (for a small space), and air conditioned. The wait can get long since it's so small; our wait was about 15 minutes. 

Food: I knew I wanted to order their corn butter ramen. I've never heard of putting butter before, although I have heard of cheese! The waitress recommended the miso broth so I got the regular miso broth corn butter ramen, and omg....the everything just melts in your mouth. The butter made it rich and creamy and since miso is also creamy, it was just a melting heaven in your mouth. Even the chashu melted in your mouth because it was on the fattier side. I can't even describe how good it was, but as I am writing this, I am drooling. My friend had the same thing, but she got the shoyu broth instead, and she said it was a bit bland.  My recommendation is to use HALF of your butter since they give you a hearty amount. Or you can take out the butter and add it little by little on how creamy you want it. I was sorta watching my intake of butter, so I decided with half. I would also get the miso broth since it is more creamier, which was a golden combo with the corn butter ramen.  If it's your first time, I  would also get add-ons on the side since adding anything to the original will change the entire flavor, and you should definitely try the original flavor first; it is to die for!

Service: I just noticed that the waitress never forgot to give us water. She was also nice and clear at explaining the broths to us. Nothing to complain about.

I've also had the buttered corn ramen too.  It smells and tastes amazing!!!   

The broth at this restaurant was very decadent. If you're looking for a low-fat meal, this may not be ideal.  The broth is made from not only bone broth but some fatty bone broth!  It's not too much where it comes you heart burn or anything, so just welcome all the decadent flavors from each part of the ramen bowl!  

The service is also pretty good. If we needed a water refill or more napkins, we just asked any server and they happily brought something over. Good team atmosphere from the staff, which I appreciate.  They also sell cool t-shirts too.

It is a small place and the parking can get a little hectic since they have a small lot and you might have to park in the adjacent street. When you go in, don't forget to write down your name, or you're gonna be stuck looking like an idiot waiting for someone to help you out, like I did. 

I was promptly seated with my party and it didn't take long before they came to take our order. I got the ramen deluxe with corn, and I feel like that was a good value for its price. They have larger bowls, but the only thing you get more of is soup and noodles. That's up to you if you believe it's worth the extra price, but I stuck with the normal sized bowl. 

I enjoyed everything in my bowl from the noodles, to the broth, to the egg. I have no complaints with Ramen Sora and I will be making another visit to this place in the nearby future.

11am sharp on a Saturday, ofcourse I expected a line.  But a line out the door?!  Hhmm...  Some things are worth waiting for, riiight? Wait! Who said that? All I was saying in my head was, this ramen better be good or else a special someone will definitely get an ear full from me!  

This ramen house was highly recommended by my Vegas connection.  He has yet to disappoint me on his foodie suggestions may be because he has known me for like forever.  Anyway, I am certain he is probably rolling his eyes as he reads this review thinking he knows better ramen than I do.  Hahaha!

Ok.  Like most ramen house, it was a cozy place so most people were waiting outside.  It was definitely a cold and windy November day.  We waited about 25 minutes so not too bad for a popular ramen spot.

Once we got seated, I ordered right away since I didn't want to waste my time and theirs for any further delay ;)

Corn butter miso amazingly delicious.  Packed heavily with deliciousness, al dente ramen, and believe me, I slurped every bit of that broth!  I don't even think I took a sip of water during my meal.  Yessss, it was that good.  Definitely one of the best I have ever had.

Tonkotsu ramen was just as flavorful and yummy! Great savory broth, cant help but finish everything to the last drop.  It would be wise to go in a group so everyone can taste the best of both worlds.  Which in our case we did and glad we did.  I'd love to have them both again on my next visit to sin city!

Gyoza was for extra credit.  Get it.  Its worth it!

As I have mentioned in the past,  there are only certain things I would ever wait in line for.  Amazing and delicious ramen I definitely would.

Situated in a little Chinatown among a plethora  of Asian restaurants, there are so many other options to choose from if you are driving down the street passing every other Asian restaurant in an attempt to find Ramen Sora but don't give up. It is worth it. 

The price is perfect, about $10 or less for a bowl of Ramen depending on what you choose. There are not that many tables inside so depending on how many people there are, do expect a wait but it's worth it. We waited about 15 minutes, not too bad. Any longer and I probably would've tried another Ramen place bookmarked on my iPhone.  

There is bench seating along the wall which is good for children or large people. I hate being cramped while eating or not having enough space on the table for all our food but this place was fine. We ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, Deluxe Sora Shio Ramen #1 and Corn Butter Ramen. They were all delicious! So flavorful, rich, and creamy, tastes like it's been cooking for days which is the way traditional old school Ramen should be. i read the ""tips"" and they give you some type of thinning broth or hot water to thin it out if you don't like your broth so ultimately rich and creamy, although I do.Toppings seemed fresh. Ramen was not overcooked or undercooked, just the perfect amount of body/bite while still soft. I always compare every Ramen place to my hometown ""Ramen Parlor"" which has the best Ramen or to Ramen I've had in Hawaii and this place is delicious. We each ordered our own bowl but were still hungry so we added on another bowl at the end which we split among us just to top us off and completely satisfy.

If you come down to this little hut in Chinatown, prepare yourself for at least a 20-30 minute wait. Of all the times I've been to Ramen Sora I've had to wait (especially during the lunch and dinner rush) except for the time I came at 10:00pm. (By the way last seating is 10:30) BUT DONT LET THAT STOP YOU!!! This ramen is WELL worth the wait.

To my fellow vegetarians, there is no true ""vegetarian"" ramen available here. Although, if you don't mind having pork broth, you will still enjoy it. If you're picky then order yourself some fried rice no pork (still yummy, but you're missing out). If you don't mind the pork broth, make sure to ask for no chashu, the little pork bits.

Now on to the food. I always get the same thing. And no, it is not repetitive nor is it boring. I get the corn butter ramen, miso broth, no meat no chashu. Hands down, the best, most amazing, most decadent ramen you'll ever taste. Im so happy with my choice that I've never ventured off to the shoyu broth. If you want spicy, the lovely waitresses will bring you chile oil and sriracha.

UPDATE: I have now ventured and tried both the shoyu and the shio broth. The miso is the strongest flavor in my opinion and the texture is creamy and delightful. Still my favorite but now o go without the butter. :)

If you are in Vegas and you don't mind waiting a bit for excellent food and great service, stop by Ramen Sora and get yourself some awesomeness in the form of miso ramen.

I came to Ramen Sora starving one night with my roommate and fellow ramen connoisseur Andrew N.  We were in search of some filling ramen.  We both got the Deluxe Sora Ramen with Shio broth.  We both found the broth to be a little bland and not as flavorful as we expected it to.  To be fair there is a note at the bottom of the menu that clearly states to ask for the Shio concentrate if you want more flavor.  But why shouldn't the original broth have enough flavor to begin with?  The toppings were plentiful, there were three pieces of pork a soft boiled egg and plenty of veggies.  

I wish that there were more soup broths to choose from like a Tonkatsu or pork flavor or even a Shoyu flavor.  I also wish I could add in some corn without having to order the corn butter ramen.  One more thing, $10 for a deluxe bowl of ramen that wasn't that big?  I killed that bowl... imagine what damage a big dude could do.  Over priced for the amount and quality.

I enjoyed their Delux Miso Ramen, and the bf had the Butter Corn ramen. I normally just order the tonkotsu, or super pork ramen at most other places. This place uses tonkotsu as a base, but you have a choice of Miso, Shoyu (soy sauce), or Shio (salt) flavored broth. The pork flavor still comes through, but with delicate miso overtones. I think I will try Shio next time, just because I really enjoy pork flavor, but this was delicious. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The butter corn ramen was very good too. It really tastes like sweet buttered corn! :)The portion size is generous as well. Its not the biggest bowl of ramen I've ever had, but hey.....sometimes bigger really isn't always better!

3392634,2016-12-26,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Short review: When it comes to ramen, this is almost as good as it gets.  A detailed review is below.

I was in Vegas for the holiday and on the hunt for a good food-spot.  I thought first of Lotus of Siam, my by-far favorite restauraunt in Vegas.  But it was closed.  So I decided to see what kind of ramen Vegas had to offer.

I did what I always do when I want to figure out where I should eat: Yelp it.  I checked a few places out.  But I settled on Ramen Sora, as it had several reviews that praised its spicy ramen.

When I showed up, I was surprised by how small it was.  I was even more surprised by how many people were waiting outside.  And when I went inside, there were even more people waiting.  Also, I was right, it's a small place.  There's probably only room for forty or so people (max) to be eating at any one time.

To get a seat, you have to write your name on ""the list.""  When I did that, there were already 15 people (which can mean ay number of people in the actual party) ahead of me.  It took about 45 minutes to get a seat.  But that's not because the staff or kitches is subpar.  This place is one of the most efficient restauturants I've ever seen, especially considering the never-ending demand.

I ordered the Gyoza, as an appetitizer, and the ""Killer Spicy"" miso-ramen.  My company ordered the regular spicy miso-ramen.  The food came out in no more than 10 minutes.

It's the best Gyoza I've had.  The filling was bursting with flavor.  It was crispy yet soft, the perfect combination.  My only complaint is that one order is only five pieces.  First, that's not enough.  Second, that makes for a fight when you have company and have to figure out what to do with the fifth piece.

Now to the ramen.  I could tell once I got my bowl that it wouldn't be the best ramen I've had.  But it looked promising.  The noodles were firm, not chewy.  But they were a bit skinny for my liking.  The chashu pork was flawless.  It's the most flavorable chashu pork I've had.  It also, was extremely lean, which is important to me.  The ramen comes with bamboo, which adds much needed texture.  Now to the most important element of ramen, the broth.  It was as spicy as promised, which made me happy, but it was too thick.  I like finishing off my broth, and this turned into a watery gravy.  (The broth of the regular spicy had a much better consistency--I stole a spoon full to taste.)

I haven't been to any other Vegas ramen joints, but if a friend asked where to go, I'd strongly recommend this spot.",TvNVZfxMET1Iqdke_YqvKg,0,0,4,leW28IEWCu2I9Z2ttstqwA

3411711,2014-01-08,2,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"This review is long overdue. Ramen Sora is by far, my favorite place to go in town for some delicious Japanese history in a bowl. Other than Fukumimi, this is my default ramen place. The Miso broth has a special place in my heart. I pretty much order it every time. It is thicker, cloudy, and a little bit hardier than the other varieties. I also always order the Deluxe ""Sora"" ramen when here. You get so much tastiness packed into that bowl! There is seaweed (nori), half of a hard boiled marinated egg, green onion, chashu (the softest pork ever), menma (fermented bamboo shoot), and of course, noodles. I always add a pad of butter to it, just to make it extra rich and creamy. With the butter added (extra $1), you get all that for just $11. 

The decor is intimate and cozy, and you are always greeted as soon as you walk in the door. About half the time you visit, there will be a 10-15 minute wait. The environment being as ""intimate"" as it is, you have to deal with limited dining space. Often times, the wait is only about 5 minutes, so just be patient! You will be rewarded for that resolve with some of the best ramen around.

Everyone always raves about Monta, which is not too far from where Sora is located. But I urge you to continue down Spring Mountain and give Ramen Sora a chance, at least once. I'm not saying Monta is bad, but I personally think Sora just has that extra something special. Who knows? Maybe you will stick to your favorite, or maybe you will realize the awesomeness that is Sora and be converted. I know I was!",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,13,10,5,ZFEZJZxWckFbxDhx_kvJmQ

The broth was delicious the noodles were perfect. Wasn't a fan of the chasu it was too much fat for me ( that's my preference though) I loved the light spice to the spicy miso. It was very satisfying..

The reason why it's 4 stars instead of 5 is my BF went to go to the restroom and while he was gone the waitress snatched our bowls up without asking and we still had a lot of broth left! We wanted to finish the broth together and by the time I could say something she was already walking away!! Ask first! I know there's a line of people waiting, I get it but give my BF enough time to come back so we can quickly finish our broth. He came back with his bowl gone and was upset. 

So if we come back I guess we have to chug the whole thing down quickly before she takes our bowl? Idk I may choose another restaurant for that reason next time.

It's like their spicy ramen, except two large pieces of dried seaweed are included, and the broth is red from all the mouth burning spices -- that should be a good indication of what to expect. The broth is incredibly spicy, and I have to agree with our waiter that it's as intense as an 8 or 9 in regards to Thai spiciness levels.  As you continue eating, the heat from the spices does intensify. I didn't ""scream,""  but I was sweating like I was in a sauna. If you like the burn, then I say accept the challenge and order ""Screaming for Vengeance."" If ya can't take the heat, I was told you can send it back to have the broth diluted.

Bumping my 4-Star rating up to 5. Not because of the fiery ramen, but because the food I've ordered on each of my visits has always remained consistently good.

Got takeout from here and it was a zoo in here on a Thursday night -- glad we ordered over the phone in advance (but I could barely hear a thing during the call, not surprising though). 

The menu is sort of confusing and redundant -- 
We got the chashu ramen, spicy ramen, and the miso ramen (everything between 7.50 to 9.25, which is pretty reasonable for a decent quality ramen), but each one has the choice of miso, shoyu or shio soup. I don't know why there's a different choice of soup for the miso ramen or why I was even being asked to pick a soup (what else would it be?), but in any case, I just picked miso soup for all of them. 

Pros: 
Chashu was indeed good and melt-in-mouth tender
Price point
Soup had good rich flavor

Cons: 
Servings aren't the largest but I guess that's reflective of the price.

I have tried the Deluxe Sora Ramen ($10.00) and the Chashu ramen (for $9.25). The only difference between the two is that the deluxe one has 3 square pieces of seaweed which probably isn't worth the extra $0.75, but if you don't really care about cost then go for it! The pork is really flavorful and tender and not really fatty. I normally don't like eating pork, but this is one of the few exceptions because it is just that good! Also, most places just give you 1-2 pieces (i.e. Monta), but this place actually gives you a good amount. I actually had to finish my pork at the end by itself since I ate most of the noodles (which normally doesn't happen!). The broth is also really good and my personal favorite is the Shoyu (soy sauce) one. They also have miso which has a creamier texture and shio which is just lightly salted. 

The restaurant itself is pretty clean and the staff is very nice. They are always smiling, enthusiastic, and willing to help if you have any questions.

The ramen was perfectly cooked. I enjoyed all the accompaniments like bamboo shoots, seaweed and especially the egg.

The place is located in China Town, off the strip (which is a plus because I would hate all the traffic on the strip).",MZi4xuO_vdMU6CtGTVb3gg,5,2,5,quEovdxEJmviknjNCw_gIA
3617674,2012-02-09,7,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Currently as the Duke (as of 2/8/2012 7:37PM) of this fine establishment, I would like to welcome Ramen Sora to my wallet.

The Short: Get the Miso ramen, upgrade it to a large, order a Sapporo (when they have their license), and go into a food coma.

The Food:

Shio: Reminds me of Chinese noodle broths, slightly clear and savory, includes 2 pieces of pork with strong flavor (soy?), seaweed, half an egg, and some fermented bamboo shoots. Everything seems to go well with each other and came out at the perfect temperature somewhere between hot and really warm. The saltiness of the broth was not overwhelming or made from someone with a salty palette. I think even my parents who dislike every other non-Chinese broth will probably enjoy this. 

Miso: The toppings are the same as Shio and I feel like this broth is the winner and the prize here. Supposedly  their style of made for the colder weathers, therefore it is rich, thick, bursting with umami or savoriness. I fully agree, except that I'll most likely be here during the summer's triple digit weather devouring a bowl of the Miso ramen. What I enjoy most is that black pig fat floating on top adding to the deliciousness. A Spicy Miso is also available with the spice equivalence to a big red pepper. 

Of course additional toppings can be added such as more bamboo shoots, onions, pork, egg, and noodles. Noodle upgrades however don't come in a separate bowl (kaedama) for you to add later like Monta. 

Curry Bowl: Unfortunately only comes in a mini size, but anyways it is a thick brown curry with carrots, chashu, and pickled red ginger (mhmm). A great snack if you're really hungry and waiting for your ramen, or.. if you're not that hungry, but don't want to feel weird with your dining companions. 

Fried Rice: If you're considering this, I would say stick with the ramen. There are two options for the fried rice, one with the house gravy sauce and one without it. I think this is the one item that is a bit overpriced, and towards the end was somewhat greasy. The house gravy (looked like egg drop soup) came in a bowl which you're suppose to add to your fried rice, wasn't my thing though. 

Drinks are pretty standard can tea, soda, Ramune, water, and Sapporo in the future when the elusive alcohol license comes in. Perhaps the wizards in the kitchen can create a ""real"" Sapparo beer ramen when that comes haha. 

The Service:

I can't bag on them too much for service since it has been mostly good, and they are not even a week old yet. For what it is worth I did experience a bit of a hiccup from the manager whom forgot to process our order and quirky service, but it may have to do with them running out of broth by 2PM causing her to accumulate stress whenever she had to turn away customers. I'm sure once they get things sorted out everything will be dandy. 

The Location: 

Ramen Sora is located ""behind"" Sura Korean BBQ (hard to miss, but if you're coming from the strip its going to be the building right after Macy's Home Furniture). Parking is entrance specific, but quite adequate for the amount of seats they have available (more than Monta if you're wondering). Air conditioning seems to be working strongly too. 

Lastly if it matters for whatever reason I have always seen ""nationals"" in here, so I assume it must have their approval in authenticity.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,9,7,5,cYJ7oXMlcK_zDQHs-lqnhQ

Food (4 stars): 

There are three different type of broths here: 1) shio (light clear salty) 2) shoyu (soy sauce) 3) miso (creamy salty) There are also three different sizes 1) regular 2) large (1/2 size added to reg) 3) super size (1/2 size added to large) --- The regular size is perfect for me but the fiancee ordered a large size and he was content. There is an extra $1 added to each size up. 

I can vouch that the spicy miso ramen is the best ramen here, especially for those who love spicy food! The creamy spicy broth melts in your mouth along with the soft wet noodles. The spicy miso ramen comes with a huge piece of chasu, bamboo shoots and chopped green onion, 1/2 an egg, and spicy ground meat. I tried the shio and shoyu ramen and it was alright.

Broth was spicy enough to my liking and NOT SALTY ----- YAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
Noodles were soft but, not too soft. Which is, also, to my liking.

Me and my bf come here every month or every other month. I've always get Screaming for Vengeance, spiciest ramen in town. Used to give me runny nose from the spiciness but now I can barely feel a thing. It's spicy but not like you can't taste your food kind of spicy. They need to step it up and make it more spicy for me. Lol.

My boyfriend's favorite is corn butter ramen. It is quite delicious. I guess most things with butter taste good.

3709644,2016-03-08,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Pros: Insanely delicious ramen, chashu that just melts in your mouth, friendly and quick service, inexpensive
Cons: Tiny restaurant gets crowded on peak times, parking lot is odd, not a lot of side dishes/appetizers if that's what you're into before you eat ramen

I recommend: Deluxe Sora ramen (miso broth is my favorite) upgraded to large size for more broth

This has become my favorite ramen place in Vegas so far! The chashu is just so tender and delicious and the broth is savory, but not too heavy. It definitely hits the spot when you have a ramen craving. The waiters are very friendly, attentive, and helpful. 

Like others said, the restaurant is quite small so if you're going for dinner (on any day, from my experience so far), you'll probably encounter a wait. The parking lot is kind of odd; if you're entering the parking lot from the back of the restaurant on Eldon and drive around to the side, the parking spots are diagonal in the wrong way (but the correct way if you're entering from Spring Mountain) so it will be difficult/impossible to park in those and you'll have to exit onto Spring Mountain and loop around. Not a big deal, but on more crowded days it can get a little hectic when everyone is fighting for spots. 

All in all, a really great, authentic, delicious ramen restaurant that will definitely hit the spot. On busy days or days that I just want to sit at home in my pajamas and eat ramen, I like to call in my order. They're pretty accurate with the wait time they estimate for you and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to pick up my order :).",mXXOE3bYMw-GAV4-cgGwTA,2,1,5,PCXVC51L2BxoE_NoyuXpVg

No, I don't want a 30 cent cup of salt from Albertsons! I'm sick; take care of me!  Little did I know he was talking about real ramen, of which I had no knowledge.

We arrived around 8 and surprisingly there was a wait, but it wasn't too long. When we were seated, the waitress immediately asked what we wanted. I hadn't even looked at the menu yet!  I guess most people here are regulars and know what they want.

I decided on the deluxe ramen so I could try a little bit of everything. I got the miso base and my husband got the shio base.  One bite and it was like fireworks went off and angels starting singing! Ramen may be taking over pho as my favorite soup da loop.

The miso base is slightly creamy with such a flavorful burst.  It's everything I want pho to be after I add fish sauce, hoisin sauce, and soy....but I didn't have to add anything.  The pork in it fell apart like butter, the noodles were chewy, and the egg was a nice surprise that I was slightly wary of but ended up loving.  The shio base that my husband got reminded me of egg drop soup.  Less flavorful if you wanted to taste the meat more.  But what I really loved (and this is so stupid!) were the utensils! No cheap break apart chop sticks, no, there is a container of real chopsticks that are so pointy that they were the easiest chopsticks I've ever used.  The spoons have a lip so that the spoon doesn't fall in your soup and it has a notch near the spoon for resting on the bowl so you dont have to put it on the table.  Don't ask me why that impressed me so much.

I took off one star because of the service. Along with the immediate wanting to order, we had to hunt someone down for a water refill and our check after waiting a long time.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,1,1,4,UjFWshL64Zex_Hw0Qfl-ww

I ate at this restaurant coming back from a day trip coming back from Zion National Park to Las Vegas where I was staying since I didn't want to eat another $50 dinner on the strip. 

The first impression: the restaurant is small, very busy, and service a bit slow. I got there starving and was seated within 15 minutes after signing in on a clipboard. The food took a bit to come out since I ordered miso base soup and they had run out since it was popular. I noticed that there a quite a few locals/repeat customers who come to this area so I was feeling good about my impromptu choice. 

The food: I ordered the regular deluxe combo bowl (the one blown up on the menu with all the fixings) and a mini curry char siu bowl. Compared to NY ramen bowls, this place is not bad, but not the best either. The (miso) base of the deluxe #1 ramen is creamy and rich but a bit salty for me. The noodles were kind of soft for me (I prefer them chewy) but maybe my noodles were slightly overcooked. And the char siu was very tough and overcooked on the lean portion, although I appreciated how much meat I got for a $10 bowl. I also really like the small tapas-style ""mini bowls"" you can order - around $4 for a mini char siu curry bowl and rice was not bad in my opinion.

This time around I figured we venture out to somewhere new and remembered that Sora was just around the corner from us. 

Nice and quaint, probably reminiscent of a low key Japanese pub (at least of what i've seen in televised visits by Anthony Bourdain) and maybe a tad bit bigger than Monta. 

The menu was short and simple, you can start off with the basics and add a la carte, or just pick from a bunch of named bowls. The 'Screaming for Vengeance' had my eye, but (sorry for this) having 'firebutt' later on in the night in 100 degree plus weather didn't seem like a great time. The spicy ramen with the miso would suffice. 

The ramen was nicely textured, had a great bite and picked up the flavors of the ramen nicely. The broth had a nice spice to it. While the waitress kindly nodded as to how spicy the Vengeance might have been, I'd definitely try it next time. Otherwise, perfect balance and wasn't overpowering. It was great, cause it was super warm inside, slurping along side the many other ramen enthusiasts. This place was among the best we've had anywhere. 

Maybe the only thing I regret was not ordering the large. The regular was definitely smaller than I've seen for that size, but that's probs because they want you to order two, or get out so they can usher in the next crowd.

She almost threw up aince she hadn't eaten meat in 16 years , we asked to have it redone and the manager, female Japanese said she couldn't guarantee there would be no meat in it. At this point my girlfriend asked to cancel the dish and the manager said no that she would have to pay for it or replace it for something else of equal value... we then asked if they could make a vegetarian dish for her then and they said no, only what's on the menu!??is this real life??? 
We ordered her mochi and a soda and left.. literally the only thing vegetarian on the menu.
 Today I tried to eat there again, I brought my girlfriend take out and went inside and asked the manager if it was possible for us to bring in her vegetarian dish and explained the story that  I had been wanting to eat there for a while but couldn't since they don't have one single vegetarian dish.. They said no, and that they wouldn't have anything vegetarian, I then asked if they could possibly think about making a vegetarian Ramen or dish in the future and the tall male server who had been listening in an noticed I was frustrated even though I was explaining how much I wanted to be able to eat there,  stated in a sarcastic voice, ""probably not"" with a smirk.

There were a number of different broths to choose from, but I decided on the basic shoyu. Right off the bat, the broth was pretty thin in terms of both flavor and depth. I was shocked to later read that you could add a slice of butter to your ramen. That's not something that you want to see at a ramen joint. The noodles were average at best. My favorite part of the ramen was actually the barbecued pork and perfectly soft-boiled egg.

Like other reviewers mentioned, this is a small, hole-in-the-wall type of ramen place. We arrived late at 9:45pm though, and the wait was not too bad... a little over 20 minutes for our party of 5. They have several tables for twos and fours, but for groups larger than 6, they offer to split your party up. We ended up sitting in the big middle table with bar stools. Even with all the people waiting, the servers had a really fast turnaround with cleaning the tables and getting people seated.

At first I was worried about eating hot soup for dinner since the vegas temps were really high (111 in the afternoon and 105 still later in the evening), but after waiting for a table we all got acclimated to the light air conditioning, and we weren't sweating trying to eat our soup. Problem solved!

Food: There were three main types of broth here- soy sauce, miso, and salt (shino). Four of us opted for the salt ramen and my dad tried out the sora deluxe ramen. We also got a side order of fried rice, which was really flavorful! The salt ramen was very good; not quite up to par (and a little watery) in comparison to the excellent ramen available in the West LA and Irvine area (Sankutora, Tatsu, etc.) but for Las Vegas, it's pretty good. The rest of my family, who only eats ramen occasionally, loved it and my dad enjoyed the deluxe with miso broth.

For those who live in South Cal, it is not a problem because all you have to do is go to Torrance or Gardena and for sure you'll find places that serves good ramen. But at last I found a place that I can finally say serves the ramen that I've been searching for here in Vegas. Ramen Sora is a small place located on Spring Mountain Rd. and Arville. I gave it four stars because of parking. If you come here during peak business hours a.k.a. lunch or dinner, you might find yourself parking on the street. Ramen Sora's parking lot is small.
When you get inside, you'll find a few tables and a counter (like a bar). Fortunately, my friend and I came at the right time and were seated right away. I ordered the corn butter miso ramen, large with extra cha-shu (pork belly). My friend ordered the Sora Deluxe Ramen. I really liked what I ordered. It had a very tasty flavor, the soup/broth was ""silky"" (I think it's because of the butter), the noodle had the right firmness to it, and the cha-shu was so tender that it just melts in your mouth. Yum!!! I'm glad I came to ramen sora today and for sure will be back for more and try the spicy ramen next time.",YqoYQ7_cl-nehLZuXQ8eLw,0,0,4,nwZyb_m02y4OM3vSflTF1g

The menu is relatively simple, they offer all the ramen staples: miso, shio, shoyu. There are specialty bowls of ramen such as negi or nori, spicy, deluxe, chasu, etc. Finally, you can order extra negi, or nori, or noodles. I did say relatively simple didn't I? Anyway, if at anytime you have a question the waitstaff is very patient and will gladly help you order.

I opted for a regular sized bowl of negi ramen. When she took my order, the waitress also asked me if I wanted extra noodles, that way she could time the cooking so they would be ready when I finished the noodles in my original order. I declined, but I thought that was a very nice touch. My order came with a slice of fatty, melt-in-your mouth chasu, half a soft boiled egg, and a large pile of negi!

The noodles were cooked nicely, they had absorbed some of the broth but still remained chewy. The broth was not too salty and was very rich, heavy, and a bit oily. That is my only complaint and it's a personal one. Considering this ramen chain originated in northern Japan, the heavier soup makes sense. I can definitely see myself craving this place on the cold autumn and winter nights, but not so sure during the summer time. Who knows, maybe they will come out with a special tsukemen at that time.

It is everything you ever wanted in a Ramen bowl: creamy miso broth, thick slices of pork that is tender enough to break apart with your chopsticks, 1/2 an egg, green onion, and 3 pieces of seaweed.

As soon as I tasted the broth I was in Miso creamy broth heaven.  Taste was on point; not too salty, but salty enough for salty lovers like myself.  Pork melted in my mouth as I ate the 3 generous helpings, and the seaweed was a beautiful compliment to the bowl.  The noodles here are cooked the correct consistency, and not starchy to taste at all!  Loved every inch of my bowl!

I felt I needed more green in my meal so I ordered a side of perfectly salted Edamame.

So far, this place beats out super salty with over priced add-ins at Monta Ramen, and super bland and shady on the meat on super starchy noodles at Anime.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,0,1,5,AVioyi8sZd7_kg2cTrmH0w
4006739,2014-11-16,3,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Whenever someone ask me ""What's a good ramen place?"" I recommend Sora ramen. I can't believe I haven't wrote a review since I come here all the time ever since they opened. Yes, I understand ramen is not the healthiest but I'm sure we all have that sudden ramen craving :)

Service
I have never, NEVER received a bad service here. They always welcome customers with ""Irassyaimase!"" and a big smile. Wait time can be long at times, especially during the winter but once you are seated, servers are attentive and fast. I'm always amazed at how fast my food arrives. Never waited longer than 10 minutes which is a huge plus (considering I waited over 30 minutes for my ramen at Misoya and Jinya).

Food
I have tried both shio and miso ramen and personally like miso ramen better. You get a few slices of chasyu that melts in your mouth along with ramen noodle and egg cooked to perfection. I like how the broth is not too salty like how other places can be sometimes. 

For the appetizer, I have tried their mini chasyu bowl which is amazing. It's a perfect size if you are not that hungry. It's almost like a snack since it's not really a meal. I have also tried their gyoza. I'm very picky with my gyoza since my mom cooks amazing gyoza. Sora's gyoza wouldn't beat my mom's, but it is good compare to many other places I tried. 

At the price range of $8-$10, the quality of food you get here is awesome. From my experience, people in Vegas either like Sora or Monta for ramen. I have tried both places but I personally think Sora is better.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,3,2,5,Meoh4NORW9aIdxEZLCMrIw
4012983,2012-02-19,3,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Konichiwa!!!!  Hello my ninjas!! 

The location for Ramen Sora is not hard to find.  There's adequate parking and also street parking on the side if the parking lot gets full.  The parking structure could get complicated though because of the way the lines are lined up.  

On to the food, during my second visit here I came by myself since I was on my way home from a friends house.  Service this time around was lacking.  At one point I made it look like I had fangs with my chopsticks while waiting for someone to come by and ask me if I wanted dessert or my check.  But the service was impressive the first time around.  What happenedddd?  

During this solo visit I had the extra large Miso Ramen (additional $2 will get you extra).  After I killed the ramen in my bowl I asked if I could get extra noodles on the side (think Monta) but I forgot that they didn't do it like that so I asked if I can have a regular Shio.  They looked at me funny like I was speaking to them in Hawaiian.  5 mins later they came back and asked if I really ordered a second ramen bowl for here and not to go.  More waiting.

The broths for both ramen bowls is night and day.  If you like your broth flavorful and thick then go with the miso ramen.  If you like your broth clear and light then go with the shio.  Fair warning though, the broth is greasy.  I have to dip my spoon down deep and blow the top of the broth to clear the grease when I scoop up.  

The one thing that bothers me is the same small window where they serve food and pass dirty dishes.  

But after killing my second ramen bowl I decided to get the kurogoma dango for two bucks.  It was good.  But sitting around and playing with my chopsticks seemed to work for getting their attention.  And mind you there was only 3 other tables occupied at the time.  No excuse for crap service.  I didn't even get the extra chashu that I ordered, but at least I wasn't charged for it.  

Overall good food.  Will definitely come back as there's a lot more room in here than at Monta, if the wait is rediculously long.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,5,3,4,CNHFU-WV2kBA4MdUTvgGRg
4014976,2014-11-21,3,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"For a hot bowl of noodly soup, Ramen Sora is a pretty solid choice.

Me?  I'm used to eating Top Ramen for 10 cents a bag, and adding toppings like boiled egg, green onion, and Tabasco to make it my own.  I ate the crap out of cheap ramen when I was in college and I still take a trip down memory lane every once in a while and indulge in a heaping bowl of Top Ramen.  Until recently reading it can cause cancer!  What the Hell doesn't cause cancer?

Ramen Sora was a good (but decidedly pricy) alternative to the miracle in a tiny plastic pouch.  I like the place - small, quaint, close, cozy (we could hear our neighbors talking about their dog ha ha), pretty comfortable.  If you don't mind a lack of privacy then Ramen Sora will suit you nicely.  On a cool night, some warm broth was on order for the wifey and I.  Wifey is like many others, ""What is the deal with a bowl of noodles?""  She doesn't get it, but didn't mind going along for the meal anyway.  I myself have delved deep into the psyche of the bowl of noodles.  The broth - how it should represent a culmination of the land & the sea.  The noodles - how they should create just the perfect 'slurp' sound when sucking them down.  The chasiu - how the fattiness should infuse the soup with its...PORK.  OK, OK, I admittedly watched a snippet of 'The Ramen Girl' and went along with it.  But yes my friends, there are those out there that take their bowl of ramen seriously.  Didn't bubble your broth all day long?  Forget it.  Didn't use pork bones from a Kurobuta pig?  Psssshhhhh.  No green onion from the Hokkaido prefecture?  Uh-uh!

I admire all that goes into making that perfect bowl of ramen but damn, I'm not gonna go all preachy about it!  Just let a guy eat!  Thankfully, the folks at Ramen Sora did just that.

Wifey got the Deluxe Sora Miso Ramen.  Honestly?  She ended up not liking it much.  I had to make her understand that a miso broth would probably be pretty salty, especially if you're sensitive to it.  Which she is.  The noodles for her were different as well.  Had to tell her for different broths come different styles of noodles.  Her noodles were a bit thicker than what she was used to in a bowl of noodles.  She did like the pork because it was tender and juicy, but refrained from finishing all the slices because they were a tad too fatty.  Which overall made her bowl of ramen not just salty in her taste buds, but too rich as well.  Wifey only managed to finish about half her bowl.  Yay...more leftovers for me!

I had the Shoyu Ramen in a large so I could have an extra helping of noodles.  Big bowl!  For me, the broth was good - rich but not thick, flavorful but not overly salty.  I did overall like the broth but I was wishing for a more porky undertone.  The ramen noodles were excellent, very slurpable, great texture and chew, good flavor.  Cooked just right and not soggy.  I just about finished the entire bowl.  I do only wish that I had more chasiu in mine, as well as a bigger serving of menma too (pickled bamboo shoots).  

We also got a side order of their house gyoza.  That stuff was killer, on point!  Chewy skin, crunchy on the bottom, healthy amount of pork filling.  Very tasty, very dippable!  5 pieces for under $4, not badly priced.  Good accompaniment to our bowls of ramen!

Will probably be back again soon now that we're in winter mode, and I'm sure the wifey will probably pick a different broth in her ramen.  I myself did like the shoyu flavor and will just opt for a deluxe with more meat, and also an extra helping of noodles.  Then again I keep hearing there are a handful of great ramen places in town now so maybe we'll hit them up for a try.

Unfortunately, I found out that I didn't like the spicy meat flavor so much. I thought it overwhelmed or spoiled the actual miso flavor a little and it felt a little like eating spaghetti bolognese - but what do I know, right? Plus, it didn't really add extra spice - side note: hubby and I are both crazy spicy food eaters, so that could be why.

For plan B I ordered a side of pork belly as well because im down, but not THAT down.

I'd opt for the shio version but between you and me it makes no difference.  You won't be able to taste shit after the 3rd bite anyway.  How were the noodles cooked?  Better yet, how was it even possible that none of the ingredients weren't disintegrated? Long hair don't care at that point.

I ordered the Spicy Ramen with miso base and it did not disappoint one bit.  The broth was very flavorful and savory.  I enjoyed each and every sip of the broth.  The chasu slices were fatty but not as tender as I would have preferred and the noodles were chewy but slightly overcooked in my opinion.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my bowl of ramen and it definitely hit the spot after a long weekend of heavy drinking.

My boyfriend ordered the Corn Butter Ramen also with miso base and that one was also really good.  Butter?  In...ramen?!  It sounds truly odd but don't knock it till you try it.  It actually makes the broth creamier and it just works.  Don't question it.  And you can never go wrong with corn in your ramen.  I think this would be even better if they could make the miso base spicy!

Not sure if she was upset about the order mix up or what, but her body language said alot.  

Sooo overall, 4/5 for food but docking a star for the attitude from that one server.  I would definitely come back though to order a bowl of the butter corn ramen for myself.",dR_rEskmBSyY3AuI-84dUQ,4,4,4,6_qzuT7BM6XeY_y5vswMtg

I originally thought that I haven't been here before.  It wasn't until I looked at their menu and used their restroom that I realized I have been here before.  My previous experience was before I started Yelping and don't remember anything negative.  So, I will consider this my first visit.  

Met here with a couple of Yelp friends (Terri R. Chad S. and Nelson S.). Also met up with some new friends that Terri R. originally invited here.  My first thought before I dive into my Ramen taste test...I better ask a pro.  So naturally, I seeked out the advice from fellow Yelper Tetsuro P.  Tetsuro didn't hesitate and was willing to give me suggestions.  He, along with another Yelper Angela T, suggested that I stick with just their Miso and avoid their Shoyu and Shio.  I took his suggestions and I wasn't disappointed. I ended up ordering a large Ramen Miso (minus the meat), added seaweed, and two extra eggs. Only reason for the extra eggs was to compensate for the meat/protein that I had taken out.  I got their large and even though it was ginormous, I was still able to finish it because it was so good.  The Ramen itself went down smooth and also had a soft or creamy texture to it. I think this may be due to the miso broth. I didn't need to add anything else to my Ramen because I felt that it tasted good as is.  

Service at this joint was at point.  There was a total of 7 of us and we all came in different times.  Because of this, our orders were not taken until all of us were present.  Overall, I think 4 stars is fair only because I really don't have anyone to compare to.  After my Yelp Check In, a gang of other Yelpers gave me suggestions on what to order and where else I should go.  I thank you all, especially to Tetsuro P. for his detailed suggestions.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,8,7,4,Fq--OBkF9aLldIc0gUtr4w

Sora Service:  This is a small ramen house with limited seating. The staff wastes no time with getting you seated and your ramen to your table asap.  Everyone moves with a sense of urgency to increase the covers served.

Sora's Ramen:  The menu makes it easy to build your ramen bowl and my favorite is the Deluxe Sora Ramen and I'll add extra chasu and extra egg.  It's #1!  All the ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp on the noodles or the extras in the ramen.  FYI. The broths here are a little saltier than you'd typically come across.  Nothing extreme at all and I enjoy it, but it may not be for everyone.  The gyozu here is tasty and you can't go wrong with any of the rice bowls.

Sora ambiance: Decor is traditional Japanese Ramen house which makes sense but the seating is limited.  There's a middle community table which they'll seat two parties if necessary.  Timing is everything to avoid a wait.

The Ramen and non-Ramen dishes have always been solid through the years.  Timing is everything with avoiding the wait list before sitting down.  There were numerous times we left because the wait was too long.  If they had more seating I'd probably be here more often.  Until then, may the odds forever be in your favor.

I usually come here for dinner when i feel up for Ramen, I usually get Tonkotsu Ramen,(simple i know) i love my pork. Sometimes the broth is very tasty , other times it's average. It really is kind of a gamble here from my experiences. Still, the price for ramen is worth it. Good portion, as I leave content and full.

There's also a sign that pretty much screams out its name. The parking lot is small and I can just see the annoyance of getting out of the lot if the place gets very busy. In this situation, I think parking on the side streets is optimal than deciding to park your car inside of the tiny lot. It's also angled awkwardly, but it's nothing to get annoyed about.

Once inside, the decorations gives a sense of familiarity if you ever went inside a ramen restaurant. They also play EDM music which is good for those who just finished partying on the Vegas strip. The waitress was friendly and was patient with my group so there were no issues with service at all. The price range is about average on what to expect at a ramen place. For myself, I ended up ordering the Deluxe ramen bowl with miso soup. The bowl itself is ten dollars, but was it worth it?

Yeah. I was never a huge fan of ramen, so I'm not some otaku that cries out ""sugoi"" for every ramen place I eat at. However, compared to other places, it was pretty good. The pork blended well with the miso, the egg was great, and the noodles weren't too hard nor were they too soft. Instead, they were just right. The miso itself was average in terms of saltiness.

Just like most Vegas restaurants, you're likely to come out here after a night with a huge hangover in hopes of a recovery from food. It's open almost 24 hours and it's definitely worth a trip to Chinatown. 

So come to Ramen Sora, it's one of the many Pho and Ramen places that engulf the Chinatown area, but does a good job at separating itself from the rest.",sKvMpe8BIqFFwYBW-x2XOA,0,0,4,VXHBRiCzDbabE_y7N8ncFw

The spicy ramen is incredibly spicy, just saying. Im not a big fan of the spicy meat they put in since its a bit bland. However, once mixed, it was okay. I think the deluxe is a lot better. The meat i prefer to eat is the katsu. Their katsu has a bit of fat in there so it puts the review back by one star. The broth is a bit more salty than usual. However, overall the ramen was good! 

Another reason why i put this a 4/5 is because the waiter never came by to refill my tea or water. This place is so packed that you barely get service.

I had to experiment by ordering the simple Miso Ramen ($7.50) instead of the Deluxe Sora Ramen. I needed to see for myself how well the basic order held up. It was in large part the same, with a flavorful broth (didn't seem as salty this time), good bamboo shoots (not fresh, but most don't use fresh shoots anyway), al dente noodles, and green onions. The egg yolk was not runny, which is strange to me because I expressly noted it last time. However, I really missed the nori and especially the extra chashu offered in the Deluxe. The chashu here is meaty but incredibly tender, and it's flavored with a little ginger. It's superior to the equally tender but fattier versions that other notable places serve, and it's why I will stick to the ""go big or go home"" philosophy in future visits.

As I hinted above, I want to describe this place in the overall ramen landscape.

Ramen Sora is still one of my two favorite ramen restaurants in Las Vegas alongside Fukumimi (hence 5 stars), although I still haven't made my mind up on Jinya Ramen or even visited Ramen Misoya Tomi.

The Deluxe is still not the best ramen bowl I've had in town. That honor would go to one of two varieties that I've eaten at Japanese Cuisine by Omae (a prix fixe dinner restaurant, but they've served ramen lunches at times).

Finally, it's certainly at least a notch below the best ramen that I've had in California (Santouka, Ramen Yamadaya), but it's still worth a try as long as you stick to the miso broth. I might try the shio (salt) ramen here in the future, for science of course, but shoyu (soy sauce) is a consistent letdown wherever I go.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,4,5,hXGJdffRIoSktLeTae2GOw

Anywho if you question the statments above then go with Cup O Noodle if you don't then enjoy a true cup of ramen soup...   Before the days of Las Vegas Ramen I used to have to travel to LA to visit friends and OMG please EAT RAMEN!  (Feed Me!)  Now, in the newer days of Vegas Ramen the argument will continue of ""who is the best Ramen""  I cannot answer this question but I will continue to eat some of them because I love those I choose for different reasons. 

Ramen Sora let me list the ways I love you...

1. I love your noodles best, firm but not hard.  Extremly well hand made (the reason my boyfriend loves this place and I have grown to respect is the noodles, before him I would have never noticed the difference).

2. Cha Sui/ Char Sui Ramen depending on who you speak to these are two different    things but like I said I am not well versed enough to tell you that.  Yours is one piece of delightfully cooked, basically melts in your mouth but I wish I had more of you.

3. Sh?yu (""soy sauce"") ramen, love the broth however what I really want is not here but like I said I come here for reasons of its own as stated above but I am always satisfied whether it is Sh?yu (""soy sauce""), Miso which involves a chicken/fish and strong salt base.  There is one more choice at this place but I have never ordered it so I cannot speak about it.   Last but not least is not at this restaurant so I will not continue.

A couple of other notes is I LOVE the corn butter ramen however my body does not.  So I order the corn butter ramen with extra nori (seaweed good for your skin and so much more), extra onion and hold the bamboo.  When it comes I take the butter out (I eat very little red meat and even less fried food and butter it has to be a special place to have me eat it!)  But not as much to make me sick.  

I am always full satisfied and really really happy when I leave.  There may be a small wait depending on the night and sometimes there will be no wait.  It depends on the time of night and the night.  The most I have ever waited was 20 min, well worth the wait in my mind...",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,2,3,4,OyS0ixeKi_B2vdi8GJpPig

I am most definitely a suckered for some good authentic ramen.  Which is something hard to find in my neck of the woods.  I love the different variations of ramen that Ramen Sora had to offer.  Now I know your probably thinking about that quick ramen you get for 15 cents at walmart. But no this is not what I'm talking about. I am talking about a beautiful dance of noodles in a flavorful soup with fresh ingredients.
OK so I had the corn butter ramen which is as amazing as it sounds. It is ramen in soup with butter and corn and ginger and veggies.  Honestly the best I've ever had!! The fact that there are minimal ingredients is the best to me because it allows you to fully enjoy everything without being overpowered by any one thing.
I enjoyed the feel of this restaurant because it was cozy and I felt like a local.  It makes you feel like your in someone's home.
Now this place is fairly close to the strip so your probably wondering well why don't you just go to the strip you'll probably  find something top notch?  The reason?  The best places no matter where you go are where the locals go.  Yes I do understand that some of the best chefs in the world have restaurants on the strip or they come to cook there but honestly good luck trying to first get into said restraunt and man are you gonna pay a lot.

4153431,2012-02-05,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Thank goddess a decent ramenhouse has opened in Vegas. I used to live in Cali and went for ramen several times a week (yes, I am an addict). I'm very picky about the quality of my ramen, and Monta, Shuseki, Ichiza, etc. just don't cut it. (Personally, I think Monta is highly overrated. I gave it at least 5 visits to make sure, and it still does nothing for me. But that's for another review.)

Finally Vegas has something that lives up to the better places in California. I would rank it in my top five ramens, having explored San Francisco, San Mateo, San Jose, Santa Monica and Los Angeles. 

Like any typical ramenhouse, Sora's space is limited. Most likely you'll have to wait for a table, and they don't take reservations. Your best bets are to come either early or late into the peak dining hours. But please don't go right before closing. If you've ever waited tables, you know how annoying this is, especially when these latecomers assume they can hang out for hours after closing time when all the chairs are put up and floor mopped. And then tip 10%. But I digress.

On opening night, we ordered the fried rice with special sauce, an interesting combination. The special sauce was a thick, opaque cornstarch-ladden concoction, a little salty and tinged with chopped scallions. It somewhat reminded me of the more rural Japanese breakfast noodles dipped in ""slime."" If you're not into this type of texture, then steer clear away from the special sauce. Overall, it gave an interesting contrast to the savory fried rice and pickled ginger (the red slivered kind, not the sweeter sushi kind). 

The gyoza was decent, nicely crispy bottoms with a chewy skin. But what blew me away was their homemade dipping sauce. I haven't had this good a sauce in so long. It was a perfect balance of soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, garlic. I couldn't get enough. 

My entire table ordered miso, half of us the spicy version. I do agree with other reviewers that the spicy was not very, but it did have that little extra karamiso kick prevalent at some other ramenhouses. No need to supplement with a side of kimchi here (which they don't offer on the menu anyway). The broth was succulent, rich and oh-so flavorful with bits of fat dotting the bowl. Oftentimes the richer the broth, the less they tend to give you, and Ramen Sora makes no exception in that. Personally I would prefer just another half-to-one more ladle of broth, but what they DO serve you will be pretty sufficient for most people.

One of the highlights of my heaven-in-a-bowl was the chashu. Thick cut and hearty, yet so tender it almost disintegrates in your chopsticks -- let alone melt in your mouth. You can tell the pork has been well-cooked for a good length of time, letting the fat render into the succulent meat itself.

The noodles are the other highlight. Thick, hearty, perfectly-cooked...in a word: amazing. Ramen Sora's noodles are deliciously chewy, making a nice mouthful after mouthful. 

(One of the most disappointing things about MONTA is their style of noodle. Admittedly, this is just my opinion, but I do not care for their sliver-thin wimpy noodles. They hold no flavor, and the texture reminds me of oversoaked bean thread.)

The servers are friendly and attentive, and I'm was quite shocked at how slammed they were on opening day. Word of ramen travels fast anywhere you go.

I stopped by after work today to get a couple orders to take home. Not surprisingly, I was their very first take-out order. I was amused to watch them explore how to pack their wonderful ramen for travel. Unfortunately, because the eggs are only parboiled/partially cooked and are meant to complete cooking when served in broth, they weren't able to supply me with egg. I asked if they could give me a fully-boiled egg, but the chef wasn't able to at this time. No biggie. Instead, I opted for extra menma (fermented bamboo) because I love the flavor and ""chewy"" crunch. I'm sure they'll work out this small detail in the future. 

The noodles held up well hours later, as well as a stovetop reheating of the broth. The flavors were all there, and at home I can slurp in comfort!

Some will come to Sora and knock it down because they're only familiar with Monta. Others will become complete converts. Whatever your preference, I still highly recommend you give all styles of ramen a try. It is diversity that makes life interesting after all, isn't it?",8cnCaI-w7-pNMguG_YEtqQ,6,2,5,0rPxWXCdOOIx6MlVPTmbjg

This time it was meeting up with great friends from high school in Japan for a much needed girls weekend.  Being that we grew up eating ramen picking it for lunch was a easy choice.

Ramen Sora serves up all broth type ramen froms shio, shoyu, tonkotsu and miso.  They state they serve Sapporo Ramen which is miso based.  It is def one of my fave broth flavor that I grew up eating in Japan including the instant kind by sapporo ichiban!  Obviously the toppings at each ramen house varies but typically a bowl of miso ramen is served with chashu, bean sprouts and corn.  

Deluxe Sora Ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#hCJU9RRGp3DKxDTlDB3YSA  You get to pick the broth choice and I decided to go with miso.  The bowl came out nice and hot.  Broth had a great flavor not salty as some can be.  Good ajitama. The chashu was nice and fatty and soft.  It was sliced on the thinner side but it was very good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#D-VllyZqgYKzpRSSEh7PBw The noodles were the yellow curly chijiri type.  It was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  They offer 2 bowl sizes (regular and large) and additional toppings are offered for a reasonable price.  

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#eaaQo6H7y5Ob4t3j7ydoeg Fried up with a decent char.  The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio. 

Ramen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.  Depending on the time you get there you will def have a wait as we did albeit a short one.  

Eyes ~ Nice bowl of noodle goodness!

I went in today and they were quite busy, there were 3 party of 2, and party of 1 (which is just me), after they seated the party in front of me, I saw the island in the middle has 4 empty seat left (the seats that no one wants to sit like in movie theater), I kindly told them I don't mind just sit in one of those rather than wait for a table, the waitress just smiled to me and nod.  I waited and waited, 10~15 minutes past(not to mention I've waited 10 minutes since I came in, so 20 minutes total), they finally cleared off a 4 person table and seated me there, YES, they seated me on a 4 person table all by myself, even though I already kindly offer to sit in one of those empty chair by the bar 15 minutes before.  So when I sat down, I told them I want my noodle but with CLEAR broth, waitress told me but I only have 3 choices, either shoyu, miso or shio(yes of course I know that), then I told them I I usually had extra light flavor before but they always made it TOO salty for extra light flavor and can never get it right, so I just want clear broth from now on, then the waitress acted like that I'm a crazy maniac, and told the other waitress to host me instead and she just walked off, HOW RUDE! by the way, this is not the first time I did this, I order with clear broth for maybe about 3 times with other waitresses and they had no problem with it.  After I got my order, I noticed something wasn't right, but I'm not sure what it is, so I kept eating anyway, during these time, they kindly ask me if everything's ok, I said yes.  But when I finished and getting ready to pay, I decided to go check the menu, and noticed they didn't even give me menma(bamboo) in my soup, so no wonder I noticed something not right since the beginning.  I didn't hold the grudge on them, but I did want them to be aware of this mistake they made, so before I leave, I just put down ""they forgot to put bamboo in my soup"" on the receipt, then as I was getting ready to leave, I was stopped by that rude waitress again and she told me I could've told them something's wrong when they came by and they could've fix it and I wouldn't have to write that note on the receipt, BUT like I said before, I didn't REALIZE it till AFTER I finished the soup, shouldn't they be talking to the chef instead of me?

Moving on towards the food, they have three types of soup bases, miso, shoyu, shiyo! (I think it's shiyo) the selection was very pleasing, I had a hard time choosing! But in the end I got spicy ramen with a shoyu soup base and some gyoza! My boyfriend got the super spicy ramen (which is what they're known for) and so did our friend as well.  

They expected it to be super spicy since our friends warned them that they would get a stomach ache but in the end they said it was not spicy at all. Maybe our other friends are just weaklings to spicy! Lol! 

I liked my ramen a lot! It was not too spicy, it was more like a mild type of spicy. I really enjoyed the chashu pork though! Very thick and flavorful slices. I could almost just eat the pork itself as a dish! (They do have a chashu pork bowl! I'm getting that next time). My gyoza was good as well. Nothing too fancy, the dipping sauce was very sour but in the good way!

I took one sip of  the broth and it tasted like water....so I tried to add more of the potent Shio concentrate (basically salt water in a bottle) but after a couple of squirts my broth and ramen still tasted flavorless. I was so bummed out and disappointed. I ended up trying the Miso ramen and I wanted to tell all of the people there not eating yet to order the Miso which was SOOOOO much more flavorful than the Shio....like 100 times way better. I tried adding miso broth to my shio broth, but it just didn't make it taste any better. Their pork is good, but you only get one slice unless you order the extra pork which is like $3.00?

Started off with killer appetizers. The *Tonkatsu Curry* is delightful, especially if you're a huge fan like I am of Japanese curry. It's not spicy so won't kick you in the face, in case you were wondering. Also good are the *Gyoza* potstickers, which are pan seared. Something different is the *Otsumami Platter* which includes seared chashu (pork just like in the ramen but way more savory), menma (bamboo shoots), and flavored egg.

As for the main stage event, the *Deluxe SORA Ramen* is super hearty. Hits the spot! That special fatty pork is thicker than the usual thin slices, and this bowl comes with bamboo shoots, green onions, soft boiled egg done perfectly with just the right texture, and seaweed. I added corn and garlic for a little extra charge. Totally worth it. I absolutely love all that garlicky broth!

Service was prompt and attentive, and all orders were delivered correctly. The ambiance is of a standard Ramen place, and is clean and well kept. Definitely recommend this for your Ramen recovery regimen.

-Mini chashu curry bowl: I was amazed at how flavorful their Japanese curry is. Lots of savory deliciousness packed into a mini bowl. It makes for a great starter.
-Spicy miso ramen: The broth has a great flavor to it, though I was expecting it to actually be spicy. Noodles were really good too (touted to be made from a recipe straight from Sapporo, Japan). I sampled the shio broth from others at my table. I'd have to say that I preferred my miso broth over it.
-Kurogoma Dango (Dessert) - Tastes like homemade mochi with a sweet bean filling inside. It's something either you like or hate. Doesn't hurt to try for $2 (3 pieces).

The parking is pretty convenient since it's not part of a strip mall, the interior is spacious for a ramen spot, and staff is really friendly and welcoming. It's safe to say that it's all enough to keep me coming back.

Having actual, fresh handmade Ramen in my opinion is way better then instant ramen~ For me, once I had real Ramen, instant ramen wasn't the same. 

They have other side dishes that you can have with your ramen.  My friend usually gets Curry with hers.  The first time I went there I got the Deluxe Sora Ramen.  It was delicious! I love the other ingredients they have in the ramen like bamboo, egg, meat, etc.  

Now, I usually get the Nori Ramen Bowl.  After I ate Nori, Japanese word for Seaweed, with my ramen, I have to have it with my ramen.  The Nori Ramen has pieces of seaweed surrounding the bowl and the usually egg, bamboo, and chashu (kind of meat).  It is so delicious! For Sora Ramen, you can choose from having Miso, Shoyou, or Shio as your soup base.  Miso is soybean base I belive, Shoyou is soy sauce, while Shio is salt base broth.  I like to change it depending on what I feel like having.  It depends on your preference.",SiXUv1oE6uTAbbHXOaXy4Q,3,1,5,l2-g9MTk1fhSdy5cPDwbGQ

I realized that I no longer love miso ramen due to the rich thicker broth. I guess your change in taste evolve as time passes. Who knows. Anyway, I ordered their nori ramen with shoyu broth and added a slice of butter. The broth was flavorful but not too rich, just how I like it. The butter added extra creaminess. The noodles were thicker and chewier compared to other spots, which I like as well. My favorite part was that the chasu wasn't all fat. I know I'm probably the only one who doesn't like the fat, call me strange. I just prefer more meat. I think next time I'll opt for the $1 charge and upgrade to the larger size. All in all, solid ramen spot and for sure I'll be back in the future.

In entirety, the bowl of ramen had great flavor. Make sure to melt your butter under your noodles while it's hot.

4286279,2017-11-20,2,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Quaint hole in the wall ramen restaurant located in china town. Considered one of the top three contenders for ramen in Vegas. 
They offer a standard menu. You won't find a large list of options or happy hour and trendy music here like its competitor JINYA. 
Just solid classic ramen. 

I will preface my review with I am not familiar with the authentic ramen restaurants of Asia. 

Be prepared for a wait as the restaurant is tiny and always packed. 

Their menu offers three bases for soup: 
Miso - all the way get this base 
Shoyu - need to try
Shio -salty and bland. I don't recommend. 

I will start by saying I initially tried shio base and was thoroughly disappointed. Salty, bland and quite frankly did absolutely nothing for me. After trying a spoonful of my friends spicy miso base soup I was ""that"" person and returned mine to the kitchen and asked for miso base instead. Feel free to roll your eyeballs at me here. 

After my initial setback the amazingly delicious spicy miso ramen hits the table. Noodles perfectly al dente. Switching out my soup  was the best decision I made.  the soup was spicy and had a kick but not too hot to take away from the complex flavors - perfectly executed. I see a lot of complaints of the hard boiled egg being over cooked in other reviews but it was perfect for me today. 

I took one star away for service - the waiter got pissy with me. Also for ambiance the interior of this restaurant didn't really have much to it.

Definitely give this place a shot for a solid bowl of ramen.",L6nrDwHJDyV0KThjON-Kog,7,4,4,mVlQ_dhFmIrZo47Q-pu_5A

I arrived at around 740pm and was seated at 8pm, despite at least 8 parties having been listed (that hadn't been seated yet) before my arrival. 

The options are plentiful, and the customizations look great. I considered getting the 5pc gyoza appetizer but realized I'd probably be full from the Large Deluxe SORA Ramen I'd just ordered. 

I am seriously considering buying one of the displayed t-shirts that says ""no ramen no life""...

The ramen arrived 15 minutes after ordering. It was quite good - the quality of the noodles, broth, and chashu (pork) were excellent. Further, they don't use peanuts at all, so no worries on my allergy. 

I was recommended this place by Eugene H.; quite the worthy recommendation - I'll definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants quality ramen at a great price.

A few years ago I had ramen for the first time at some sub-par restaurant that made me stray from ramen for a while. A year later I gave Ramen Sora a try. It was glorious and I fell in love. I love their ramen in all its salty & flavorful broth, thick noodles, crunchy menma(bamboo), and umami chasiu. 
During the time I've known Sora, I've strayed from my loyalty and tried multiple other ramen restaurants around the valley (& some in California!), but I have yet to find another that compares to Sora's rich soup, flawlessly boiled egg and the perfect fat-to meat ratio of the chasiu. Shio (soy sauce) broth is light and salty if you don't want a thick soup. Miso is thicker and flavorful with what I think are hints of ginger. Spicy pork is not too spicy, and ask for chili oil which delivers a nice kick. Screaming for vengeance is hottt and comparable to a crazy night out- you'll feel it more the day after if you know what I mean. Sora even has delicious and good sized portions of chasiu bowls and curry bowls if a ramen doesn't fill you up.  There's usually a bit of a wait at dinner time, but any wait is worth it for what Sora has to offer. 
Sora has everything I could've ever wanted in a love and more.

4422197,2012-02-08,2,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better. 

Ramen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no. 

Broth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something. 

Broth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.

Chashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs. 

Tamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.

Alcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)

Service: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem 
 
Parking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus. 

Wait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there. I was seated quickly",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,7,5,2,dRFYfMButlgz04IKB8g_TQ

A friend of mine recommended Sora and I'm glad to say I can still call her a friend.
First off, I appreciate the quick service and slightly more ample seating. The servers were on their game and quickly delivered the goods with a smile and thorough explanation of the menu. I initially expected to pay a la cart for tamago, chashu and spicy meat like at the other places. But for $8.50 I can get a SPICY MISO RAMEN with all of the above...what a great deal! Of course you can get extra portions of these items for just a $1 or $2...again not a bad deal considering some other ramen houses charge much more.
SPICY MISO RAMEN was perfect! I loved the spicy meat that should be a ramen staple...lean ground meat with a slight sweetness and once mixed into the rich, not too salty miso broth, completes the ramen experience. Chashu is a newly acquired taste for me as I wasn't a fan of fatty pork belly, but in a steamy bowl of ramen is now an unctuous treat I crave. Chashu, slow braised pork belly that takes hours to cook to achieve that tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only thing I didn't like and will probably always have an aversion to is the fermented bamboo shoots..menma. I think it ruins my perfect bowl with its stinky presence...sort of like the uncle no one likes who keeps showing up at dinner. I must remember to omit it from now on.
I enjoyed the simplicity of Sora's ramen that didn't try to pack in everything and give you ramen ADD with adding things like black garlic, chili threads (offenders know who they are). Ramen is a simple bowl of comfort food meant to satisfy and warm the soul.

My one and only negative to mention is that they are so popular that even during off times, you'll likely have quite a wait.  We went midweek, well after lunch hours, and still had about a 30 min wait for 2 of us to be seated.  That won't stop me from going back, because I now understand COMPLETELY why people line up inside and outside!  :)

The food lived up to all the hype and I found myself craving it again within hours.  We started with gyoza and found them to be some of the best we've had.  I had the Miso Ramen and hubby had the Spicy Miso.  Both of us really loved the broth!  The noodles are amazing and the pork is spoon tender.  I was a bit unsure about the egg, but found that it added wonderful flavor.  Who woulda thunk?  The ""regular"" sized bowls are FILLING and way big enough for both hubby and I.

It was fantastic! It was the perfect hurt. It didn't have a very spicy forefront (more of a slow painful build), and it did make my nose run! No sweating though. The noodles were such great consistency, on the thicker side with nice chew. Make sure you have plenty of water to cool yourself off!

It was warm, rich, and absolutely delicious!! The chashu was cooked perfectly. It was tender and practically melted in your mouth with the miso broth. I also thoroughly enjoyed the bamboo shoots that were still a bit crunchy, perfection!

I tried the shoyu broth as well, which was good, but nothing compares to the miso broth. If you come here, don't even contemplate about getting anything but the miso. It is a MUST! The ramen comes in regular or large, and by large I mean ginormous. It's a pretty big helping, so you've been warned. 

The service was on point. We were seated immediately. The waiter was very attentive and informative. He was able to explain the different broths and the different menu options.

4615583,2012-07-24,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"This place is officially my favorite ramen spot. PERIOD. For a multitude of reasons...

1) Most importantly, I like my food spicy. I don't mean ""spicy-tuna-roll-spicy""... I'm talkin' fiery hot, but the flavor has to be there too. It can't taste like those atomic hot wings tossed in chemical-like hot sauces. Ohhh ramen sora, thank you for having the PERFECT idea of spicy :). The killer spicy ramen is my dream come true broth. 

2) I enjoy variety. The mini chasu curry bowl and an order of gyoza are perfect side dishes to ramen. They also provide a great list of toppings for ramen (extra chasu, corn, etc). 

3) Ramen is NOT supposed to be expensive! Honestly, it can be just a tad cheaper but compared to most spots in Vegas, this place is the most reasonable. :)

4) Friendly workers. The service is always fantastic. I never see the bottom of my water, and trust me this is very important when you're enjoying a super-sized killer spicy ramen. Most Asian restaurants tend to neglect glasses of water and we are forced to wave down a waiter for a refill. Not Ramen Sora, they're on top of their game! 

5) Space. I didn't really want to compare Ramen Sora to Monta too much, but man, Monta really does need to expand for customer convenience. You won't have as much problem getting a table/seats at Ramen Sora. 

6) THE RAMEN HERE IS JUST PLAIN FANTASTIC. Great broth, amazing noodles cooked to perfection (not too soggy and just a tad thicker than Monta's), and several options for the broth: shio, shoyu, miso. Flavor reminds me of my favorite ramen spots in NYC, which says a lot.

It's located across the street from my house, obviously making it incredibly convenient but I always know that there will be a line. I don't like to wait. People may find that selfish of me, but I choose not to. I mention that because I never mind waiting for Ramen Sora. They have a sign in sheet, which I saw only had three in front of us. It seems more traditional with the seating, meaning, you may be sitting at a long rectangular table with a couple other parties if you don't mind.
We sat after about ten minutes and were served within five. We always order the same three things a pork belly bowl with rice to split, Killer Spicy Ramen, and Spicy Ramen.. Always more than we can eat, which is downstairs now, but delicious on a level that you savor every last bite.

But I held off on trying any because in the back of my mind ramen is the stuff you find in styrofoam cups or bricks of dried noodles wrapped in cellophane. Ramen Sora is not that kind of Ramen at all. Not even close. 

Ramen Sora is pushing it distance wise for my lunch choices, but I went anyway. (Gotta love Desert Inn - Super Arterials equal SPEED so getting past Las Vegas Blvd is not an issue!) The place is very clean, even a peek through the door into the kitchen showed it to be almost spotless. Service was fast, friendly, and most importantly very helpful. I can't recall everything I ordered, Green Tea, a side plate with eggs, Charsiu, and other yummy stuff, and a bowl of Miso Ramen. 

I have to say I'm typically NOT a pork fan. But when it comes to Charsiu...OMG I have never had anything like this before. Tender, easily pulled apart with chopsticks, and with a flavor I have rarely associated with pork in the past. Charsiu is incredible, more like mind blowing and it certainly adjusted my mindset on pork and how it can be prepared. But as good as the Charsiu was, the bowl of Miso Ramen was beyond incredible. Ok, I admit I didn't eat the egg they put in it, but that's the only thing I didn't eat as this was one of the most flavorful dishes I've had in a very long time. I can't really describe the complexity except to say I have never sat down with a noodle type dish before and finished with a smile from ear to ear because it was so damn good. Until now. 

I have a new found understanding on what true Ramen is, and how great it is.

That sounded scary and knowing his tolerance for heat, I wasn't going to go near it. Anyway, even after taking him to Monta, he still liked Sora better, so I had to see for myself.

We visited one afternoon with his co-worker, waiting eagerly for them to open. Then, we were seated immediately. Both of them knew exactly what they wanted - Killer ramen bowls with the option for more noodles and broth. I went for a Miso Ramen. I really liked the flavor and everything about my ramen was delicious. Oh, and of course I had to try the Killer broth. It has that really deep chili flavor that lingers in the back of your throat. But wow, it was so, so tasty! I actually added a few spoonfuls of the Killer broth into my ramen! It was great.

At the end of the meal, my only problem was that I couldn't decide which ramen house I preferred (between Monta and Sora; I eliminated Fukumimi). They have different styles and I enjoyed both of them. What it came down to for me was the noodles (I prefer Monta's thick, wavy noodles), preference of Tonkotsu over Miso broth, and the availability of chili oil to control the spice level.

Inside is crowded so you literally have to push people aside just to get through to either the restroom or to your table (if it's ready for you). I'm not going to lie, we had a big family to accommodate with kids, too. [Talk about 10 people so I understand that it was challenging for the workers especially on a busy Wednesday night with little seating trying to help everyone else].

When we were seated, they were being really pushy about what we wanted to eat. There was no sense of patience and when we asked what was popular on the menu, one of the ladies rolled her eyes and said ""everything that is ramen"". Okay? 

My cousin could not have anything because she does not eat meag and was also allergic to a lot of the ingredients on the menu. When she asked if she could get food elsewhere and bring it in, they told her she had to eat it outside because it was not ""welcomed here.""

p.s. The ""spicy miso"" ramen gets it's spicy from the scoop of meat that is added to the bowl.  The texture reminds me of a sausage.  I had a few really hot bites and if I order it again, I might get it on the side to control the level of heat.

The ramen here is excellent. The flavor of the broth is delicious and the noodles are cooked perfectly. They have a really good taste. Also, I really enjoyed the Chasui Bowl. I like Chasui so long as its cooked well. I don't like it when it is so fatty that when I'm chewing it, it just is bleh. The Chasui both in my ramen and in the chase bowl was cooked really well and I enjoyed it. 

The service is good but the place is almost always packed. Although, the food makes up for it. 

I think the reason why this is 4 stars is because of how busy they are but they aren't always busy (only a majority of the time).

It was a little saltier than the broth at Monta and the noodles were thick and chewy. I was fine with these things, but I must admit, I would still pick Monta as my first choice. Don't get me wrong, I will be back to Sora. I guess it just depends on which of the two I'm craving since they're different. They have a couple of dessert options, so with my sweet tooth, this is a definite plus. They have mango mochi and Kurogoma Dango. I didn't get to try either one on this trip, but I shall try one next time.

While tasty, I felt the miso broth was either missing some umami or additional saltiness. A side of additional garlic may have also helped but by itself, I had myself wondering what it could be while eating. Inside the bowl was a piece of char siu which was very tender, falling apart as soon as it hit my tongue, nori and bamboo. Very simple and satisfying. The noodles were slippery good and cooked to the right degree of al dente. The gyoza were also very good but also missing something to make it truly memorable, perhaps a little more sesame oil would be more toward my taste. They were also not served super hot, a la fresh out of the pan, which is how I like them. Probably a minor complaint for most though as many people eat it over the course of the meal anyway when it will get warm.

My husband and I ordered the large Chashu bowl with miso base and spicy pork fried rice to share. Let's start with the Chashu bowl- miso base soup was savory and hot. The noodles were also cooked well, not too soft just right (like al dente pasta). Like any of the reviews the Chashu could be softer, the type that melts in your mouth. However, there were 3 large slices of Chashu included in the bowl. So no complaints there. The spicy pork fried rice was a nice compliment to the ramen.

I got the crazy hot shoyu ramen with extra nori. I love to eat habanero regularly so wasn't expecting it to be too spicy, once again not disappointed.

The true seller here is the chasu. The slices of chasu are super thick and tender. I've never had a ramen that had such thick slices of chasu, you definitely get your money's worth. Also I'm in love with the bamboo shoots. I like how they are thick, chewy, and juicy. The way they're supposed to be eaten! Most ramen places give very thin slices of bamboo. The ramen noodles tasted ok, they were also thick and wavy, nothing too special about them. I'd wish they offer chili oil on the side,  it would've made the broth even more awesome. They do have chili powder, however I find it doesn't really offer much of a difference in flavor.  

The only downside to this place is how crowded this place can get. Seating is limited. We came around 3pm, it got packed fast. Another downside is how stuffy and hot inside it was. I was sweating in there! I'd wish they turn on the AC full blast or something. Eating hot bowls of ramen especially in Vegas weather, not very comfortable. Parking was plentiful though. I would definitely come here again if I ever have an urge for ramen again.

We only came here because I wanted to taste it so I could compare it to all the other ramen joints and also because we figured it would have the least amount of wait time out of all ramen places.. 
We still had to wait about 20-30 minutes.. Even though there were tables available. 

We had an order of gyoza and the deluxe miso ramen & deluxe shio ramen.. 
The gyoza was not good to me it had a weird almost iodine taste to it.. 
The miso broth was nice.. very deep and creamy..way better than any other miso broth I've tasted.. also I did like the chashu.. very melt in your mouth good and they don't skimp out on it in their deluxe ramen..  I liked the chewy consistency of the noodles but personally, I am more of a fan of thinner noodles.. My ramen also had that same weird taste to it.. I think it was the taste of the menma.. So I must not like the taste of their bamboo... & The tamago didn't really have any seasoned taste to it..
The service was not good at all.. Our waitress never checked up on us.. She never even refilled my water. BOO!

3.  The choices -  All sorts of choices, additional toppings, larger size with more noodles and etc.

4.  The key points - I like the pork tenderloin in any ramen. I also like the flavor of green onion sliced and cooked to perfection. 

5.  Parking - Has parking, in it's own lot, however, the traffic direction seems to be a bit odd, seems that the entrance is two way, yet large enough for only one car.

6.  Service and Seating - Small, be prepared to wait, nice service, and very busy.

4939669,2012-02-10,2,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"My 2nd visit here in a week.

So I was there about 12:15pm, and the parking lot was 75% full.  Fortunately I was able to be seated with no waiting, but the place was pretty much full.

This time, I tried Spicy Shio with extra green onions and gyoza.  

Gyoza:  pretty good.  But I would have to give this gyoza battle to Monta.  It's very possible they Sora will get better as they have been open only a week, but Monta's gyoza had more flavor and juice.  

Shio ramen:  I'm not a big fan of shio ramen, but I have to admit that this was pretty good.  simple, not oily, with some of the tonkotsu flavor coming through.  Spicy Shio is a weird concept as it makes it somewhat spicier and fattier, which is somewhat like ordering a veggie burger with extra cheese.  I  think I'd stick with Miso personally, but I do like their noodle.  Al dente, slightly chewier than Monta's miso ramen noodle, and wavier.   I think  it is more like a traditional miso ramen noodle from sapporo.  People who are not fond of heavy, kotteri type broth will probably prefer shio ramen.  Not me.  

Service:  today they had a one Chinese lady waiting the table, and other two were Japanese.  This is somewhat disappointing for an authentic ramen house, but it's not that big of a deal as the menu is short and simple.  However, the service seemed to be faster today.  Perhaps they are getting used to it after the opening week.  

As I was leaving, there were a few people waiting to be seated and the parking lot was full.  There is plenty of space to put in a few tables, and I really think that they need a counter space as all authentic ramen houses should have.  I'm just surprised at how quickly the word has spread and so many people have discovered this place.  

It's hard to say who is better:  monta vs Sora, but I'd go to Monta if I""m feeling for tonkotsu, and Sora if I'm in the mood for miso.  

There are no other Japanese ramen house that come close to these two.  If you disagree, please keep going to the place where you get served by faux anime characters.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,3,2,4,HJy0taKXKolvvrjrZkiRAw

Sora gives you half an egg where as at monta you would have to pay extra but Sora's prices are a bit more than Monta's so there's that. Also, Sora is more spacious and bigger.

We arrived on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not full at all.  There were plenty of empty and cleared tables available.  However, they insisted that we write our name down and wait.  A few more parties arrived after us and they were also instructed to write their name down on the growing list.  (Hmmm...why can't they just seat us?  Don't they see that we have a toddler in hand who is attempting to touch all the business cards and paper junk they have at the front register while we wait?  We could entertain him a lot better if we were seated!)  I could only assume it's because they are understaffed.  Are they hiring?  If not, they should be.

When we were finally seated, putting our order in takes a good while too.  Be prepared to wait!  But when you do get your order in, it comes out super fast!  So, that's definitely a plus!

We ordered the Nori Ramen - Miso ($8.50) and the Butter Corn Ramen - Shio ($9.00) and upgraded the latter to the larger size ($1.00).  We thought the ramen was fine, although the Husband preferred the broth at another ramen joint we had just visited the day before out of state.

On our first visit, we also tried the Mini Pork Chashu Bowl ($2.85).  It's a cute little tiny bowl that is very kid-size friendly or an add-on to your ramen bowl.

I liked the noodles in it, the pork belly was cooked well, but the flavor of the bamboo shoots ruined the whole thing.

I just couldn't eat past the flavor and normally bamboo shoots are my favorite.

I ordered their special ramen.  A lot of my friends got it in a large because it was only 2 dollars more and the bowl is a lot bigger.  I was happy with mine though because I barely finished it.  The ramen was good.  Noodles were nice and soft and the broth was thick.  Not as rich and flavorful as I hoped it would be but it was decent.  Lacked some level of rick pork flavor though.  I don't want to give it a low review but I just think that i've had much better elsewhere.  This palce is really just OK with me.  This is my first time having ramen in Vegas...so I can't really say how this compares to other local spots.  Maybe after i try other places I'll update my review since i'll have a better comparison.

Beer is a good deal at this place...I think a pitcher is for 11 bucks?  We ordered 2 and had a great time.  We didn't order much appetitzers except the gyoza.  It was yummy...like all the other restaurants hahha.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I tried my friend's spicy ramen and it wasn't too bad.  They just add some spice to the miso paste.  The spicy ground beef was good but wasn't too spicy either.  I usually order no spice with my ramen because I love the rich flavor of the pork broth but since the broth wasn't spectacular, I asked for chili oil to make it better.

I would definitely go back to this place again and give other ramen places a try but if every place in vegas is like this..i don't think I'll be craving ramen all that much.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,1,1,3,5s56wm-QYHch4DTgCt5gkw
5023016,2012-08-13,1,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"The gf and I were exploring the Chinatown area.  We'd had our banh mi appetizer and decided to find some ramen for our lunch main course.  Once again, we referenced our Yelp iPhone app and two names seemed to be head and shoulders above the competition, Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora, based on the sage advice of Misti Y, Janel S, and Yuhi K.  We made our way up W. Spring Mountain and Ramen Sora became our default choice since it was a shorter walk from Mr. Sandwich. 

Ramen Sora doesn't look like much from the outside or inside with its dive-ish exterior and generic furnishings, but it definitely sounds like a Japanese ramen shop with the shouted greeting ""Irrasshaimase!"" as you enter the place and the slurping of noodles and broth.  The menu is pretty straightforward with descriptive photos of items offered.  While the Spicy Miso Ramen sounded intriguing, I went with the regular Miso Ramen with Chashu ($9) since I had recently had a similar bowl of miso ramen at ramen shop in DC from which to base a comparison with Ramen Sora's.   Three thick slices of pork belly rested atop a bed of nicely cooked noodles, which were bathed in a generously-sized bowl filled with flavorful, but not too salty, miso broth.  The broth was a bit greasy, but it was a result of the fatty pork belly, and not a detractor from the overall bowl.  Ramen Sora's Miso Ramen with Chashu was not quite as good as the bowl I had at DC's Toki Underground (http://www.yelp.com/biz/toki-underground-washington#hrid:J5z59CPghtxPxofmaWWhdw/src:self.), but it was appreciably less expensive and offered incredible value!

My only suggestion would be to improve their eggs. While I had never had any problems before, the last time I was there, the egg was slightly overcooked.

5051604,2012-08-27,3,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"I've been wanting to try this place but since the other ramen place had overly salty broth the last two times, I got turned off eating ramen all together. There was a odd day of constant rain and cool temps in this blister which needed to be celebrated with some soup. Made for a perfect excuse to have something warming.

I grabbed up a miso ramen and the BF went for spicy ramen and on the recommendation of the server for a ""lighter"" broth got shoyu base. The miso was savory and buttery (has some oil floaties, but enough to be a deterrent) and not overtly salty. I really like that it comes with a soft boiled soy egg, the thicker rustic roast style cut of chashu was tender and the ramen was rightfully chewy. This is a bit different from the traditional Sapporo toppings I'm used to as it normally has corn, bean sprouts, pork, and garlic. I suppose I could add those toppings next time. I took a taste of the BFs shoyu spicy broth and it was fairly good. Still a bit porky, but much lighter since it isn't creamy like the miso and the spicy crept up to a medium burn. 

We got a mini chashu bowl to share. It was much smokier than the chashu in the soup so it seems they throw it on the grill before serving and top with a drizzle of sweet soy so it's a different experience. I like this preparation. I wish they offer some vinegar as a side condiment as the little bit of acid would be nice with the sweet. 

We came within the last hour of being open so I figured that's why service is quick, but hope that it soup comes out that fast regularly. Our server was friendly and didn't make us feel rushed. 

I definitely prefer this over the other ramen place. Somehow my BF got it in his head he doesn't like ramen so even though I like it, it may be a trek I make again alone.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,7,4,pF3p3XiRK3I-8gd4KkMllw

I think I actually like Ramen Sora a tad bit more than Santouka (I know I know, heresy!). Prices are very very reasonable and service was quick and efficient. We got there on a Monday night around 4:30PM and there were already about 6 groups in line, but the wait went quickly. 

The husband got the chashu ramen and I got the deluxe, both shio broth.  Both were excellent, but mine was better because it had more toppings. The gyoza was the one thing that was a let down, because it tasted like the generic frozen type they just fried up, so skip that. Also got an order of the grilled chashu, because we love love love the grilled chashu at Hachi. While Sora's wasn't bad, Hachi has the edge because of the charcoal-grilling.

Sora was so good that we ordered two large shio ramen and the pork fried rice to go, which we had for dinner Tues. night when we got home. Can't wait to go back!",FLZVbNL6gLji3ghze303Fg,1,1,5,e3p9xUZPqmNx7r4XujTcZg

In Battle Ramen Vegas, the contenders are widely considered Monta and Ramen. I am no ramen expert, but I have learned that these spots serve up different types of ramen (Hakata vs Sapporo). Some contend they should not be compared, but if thin crust vs deep dish is a fair fight, so is Hakata vs Sapporo. 

And, the winner for me is the Sapporo-style delight being served at Ramen Sora! I would actually return for more, please. 

I ordered the Nori Ramen with miso broth. (Based on my rapid Wiki education, miso broth is the signature broth of Sapporo-style.) I passed off my egg to my husband and removed all of the bamboo shoots, and from there on out, it was edible bliss even on a 103 degree day. I rarely finish an entire bowl of soup, but I slurped every last drop of the rich, flavorful broth. I also devoured the curly, slightly chewy noodles. I was even a little sad when I finished off the last bite of pork. It wasn't too fatty, and it had the taste of the finest pork BBQ in Texas. Oh, and I have recently developed cravings for seaweed, so the crunchy sheets lining the bowl were a wonderful treat. Alas, it was gone too soon.

I also enjoyed the atmosphere. It is clean, airy and cool. There are numerous seating options, and the service is super quick.   

Like pizza, I think that ramen is probably a strong personal preference, but personally, I haven't had a finer bowl of soup than this miso broth beauty in quite some time.

I've been to one other ramen house, exactly one week ago. 

Saturday night, after moving  friends all day in the heat, my fella and I decided that we wanted to give Ramen Sora a go.  

We drove over, and there was a bit of a line, but the wait wasn't bad at all.  
The restaurant is open, and spacious, but has an intimate feel.  

The server was super nice, taking time to explain the differences between the broths to us.  

We ended up ordering an appetizer ""sampler"" of the flavored egg, bamboo shoots, and seared pork belly.  We also ordered gyoza. 

First of all, I have to toot my own horn: I successfully ate my egg with chopsticks.  On the first try.  :D    The egg was delicious:  with the yolk just a tiny bit under hard boiled.  (Solid, but not dry). I loved the bamboo shoots, but was nervous about the pork belly, and almost didn't try it.  I'm SO glad I did!  It was smokey, and tender, and juicy...really delicious. 

Our ramen arrived next:  Mine was the shoyu (soy based) with corn.  Morgan had the shio (salt based)  They were phenomenal.  I loved mine so much, I actually drank all of the broth.  

I loved the service, and how polite everyone was.  

So...for the rest of the night and all day yesterday, Morgan was talking about Ramen Sora.

I started feeling really under the weather yesterday, and felt just as bad this morning...and the only thing that got me out of bed was a trip back to Ramen Sora with friends!

We got to try the miso broth this time, as a friend ordered it...it was awesome.  SO rich!!

Service was spectacular, and the food was just as delicious as it was Saturday night.

I ordered the miso broth with spicy meat on the side and extra chashu pork and nori. It was fabulous! The meat wasn't that spicy but it had a good flavor. I also ordered steamed gyoza and a cold sake. No one had any food left in front of them and it was pretty quiet while everyone was eating. Another good sign of good food.

Fancied by legions of fans around the world, and certainly seeing a renaissance in America that goes beyond the 25-cent cups commonly seen around college dorms, Ramen Noodles have never really held much interest to someone that really does not love soups with clear broth, but attempting to understand a trend that generates lines in America and Michelin Stars overseas it was with a friend that Ramen Sora was visited for 6 o'clock dinner, the small shop on Spring Mountain supposedly Las Vegas' best.

Small and dingy on the outside, the sort of place passers-by could easily blink and miss, Ramen Sora cites its Sapporo heritage with signage at the door and once inside the scene brightens substantially, several tables laid out with good spacing while pop-music chimes over the din of the crowd.

Smallish in menu, a few appetizers joining soups in one of three styles of broth, those arriving during peak hours should expect a short wait, the staff friendly and efficient with bowls emerging from the kitchen at a relatively rapid rate.

Opting for water and tea service, a few alcoholic selections also available to those choosing to imbibe, it was mere minutes after orders were placed before five pan-seared potstickers landed on the table, a ground chicken filling nicely textured and exceedingly juicy with a sesame based sauce served alongside for those desiring an extra bit of umami.

Onward to the soups, noodles of the pre-packaged variety and thus no different than anywhere else, it was at the advice of our waitress that the 'signature' miso soup was selected for both bowls instead of Shoyu or Shio and with a description of 'creamy' the pork infused broth was indeed rich, the spicy beef addition leaving a tingle on the lips while a small knob of butter added even more depth to the corn studded version that trended ever so slightly sweet.

Happy to see an egg and shoots added for texture, the noodles springy but rather redundant bite-after-bite, it perhaps should have been a sign when the table adjacent added several pieces of Chasu to their four-person order, the four bites of pork belly included in our bowls easily the most memorable part of the meal and so tender that it almost melts on the tongue.

***Potentially underrated by someone whose basis of comparison consists of less than a handful of noodle houses to date, it is simply difficult to get excited for something based on pre-packaged starch and pork broth served in a gigantic portion no matter how good, a menu with more options or at least more room for customization potentially something I could grow to understand and maybe even love.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,3,mdWdLdYRgdC95FuxQJDdMQ

I had yet to receive mine. So I waited.... and waited.... and waited some more. It took between 15 to 20 minutes for my food to come out, and I was not happy. By the time I got my food, the rest of my party was already done with theirs. The seaweed had been sitting in there too long, and it was a little too cold, but I don't like to complain when I'm hungry. I ate it and we received our check which came to almost $70. My tip to them was $3. I get it. It was busy, there was a lot of people. I'm very unhappy because the waitress didn't really seem to care, just gave me a quick ""Sorry"" and disappeared until the table was cleared. Anyways, another lady comes and grabs the check and looks inside, makes a face, and motions to our waitress. She points to me as if I wasn't even there, and our waitress rolled her eyes while they're pretty much badmouthing me.  We got up, and our waitress had the audacity to shake her head at me. That really made me upset. Not only is that very rude and disrespectful, but it's extremely unprofessional.  I did not appreciate that. I get that waitresses live off of tips. I live off of my tips as well. I am not going to reward bad service. My tips to someone are a privilege, not a right, and workers here in Las Vegas seem to not realize it's not your right to receive a tip. If you're going to badmouth a customer, as least do it out of sight. Or don't do it at all. Sadly, I won't be back to this place, which breaks my heart since I truly love your miso broth. But I'd rather spend my money at a place that doesn't talk smack and shake heads at their customers just because I left a $3 tip. Judging by your reactions, I'm pretty sure you deserved it.

Edit:

I decided to come back to this place because I can't stay away from their amazing killer spicy miso ramen. I'm glad I came back. Haven't had problems since. I just avoid the two ladies who were rude, and thankfully I rarely have to see them. Definitely try all their food. It's pretty great.",aBrClQ9GLt8G-5DRdCI_5w,2,0,4,1cgjuHtj2KClmlOYlp-pzA

After days stuck on the Strip during my trip to Vegas, my friend drove me to Ramen Sora to try one of the many restaurants in Chinatown. The Deluxe Ramen with Miso was probably my favorite meal of the week! The pickled ginger on the side was a perfect compliment as well (my friend requested it, so I don't know if it automatically comes with meals or only by request).

It is the best ramen I've ever had. Granted... I have only tried ramen at four restaurants including Ramen Sora (one in Los Angeles, and two in Atlanta). However, the soup, the meat, and the noodles were perfect: the soup rich, the meat tender, and the noodles chewy.

I normally get gyoza with whatever ramen I get. There's enough meat filling and the wrapper isn't thick/ chewy with one side toasted for a nice crisp. I've tried their shoyu chashu ramen, miso ramen, nori ramen, shio ramen and the spicy miso ramen. Unfortunately, they ran low on chashu the last time we went - each person could only have 1 slice of pork belly each. Sad! But their chashu is soooo tasty so I'm not surprised. I like to add iwanori (seaweed flakes) and corn on my ramen. Mmmmm...the hot rich broth, the firm ramen noodles and hard-boiled egg + chashu on a cold day. I couldn't want more than that.

5361441,2012-02-06,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"**Summary**
       - Ramen - Their ramen is a bit thicker than your average ramen. It's suppose to be an original recipe from Saporro Japan.
       - Flavor - Their barbecued pork is unrivaled in its tastiness. Since practically everything on the menu includes it, you'll probably try it in one of their dishes.
       - Saltiness - All the dishes were a little too salty for me, but all the good ramen places in Vegas seem super salty. With that said, it's less salty than Monta, which was my previous ramen place.
       - Super size - You can order a large version of the ramen bowls for $1 more.
**Ramen**
       - I got a bit confused with the menu when I first looked at it, so here's my explanation of the ramen.
       - Two things main things make up the base. One is pork and the other you have a choice of Miso or Shio (Salt).
       - They all come with half an egg, one piece of pork, and menma (bamboo shoots).
          - Chashu Ramen has 2 extra pork pieces.
          - Menma Ramen has extra menma.
          - Spicy Ramen has a ground meat/Rayu (Chili oil) sauce scoop added in to be mixed around. It's not spicy at all. Taco bell mild sauce is spicier.
          - Corn Butter ramen had corn and a slice of butter added.
          - Nori Ramen has seaweed added to the side.
          - Negi Ramen has a piece of fish replacing the pork.
          - Deluxe Sora Ramen has 2 extra pork pieces and nori (seaweed) added.
**Ordered**
       - $10.00 Deluxe Shio Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg?select=bs_GyeafgqHE1QlNfTP69g)
       - $8.50 Spicy Miso Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg?select=J6COHikJJ6CviUN8mzSoiA)
              - Soup - Both soups are slow-cooked in pork bones. You can see the pork oil floating in the soup. It really adds a deliciously meaty flavor to the soup.
              - Miso - The miso soup is thicker and heartier than the shio. 
              - Shio (Salt) - I much preferred the shio soup. The consistency is less thick and the flavor a lot more clean.
              - Chashu (barbecued) - The meat literally falls apart it's very tender and the pork is literally a flavor bomb.
       - $2.85 Mini Chashu or Chashu Curry Bowl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg?select=OWti3brKP7toeyxM1L0XGg)
              - Mini Chashu Bowl - Their signature chashu pork on rice. Out of the soup, it really allows you to taste the full flavor of the meat, though it's a smidge saltier than in the soups. Even though meat the rice ratio was a little lacking, it makes for a delicious snack.
              - Mini Chashu Curry Bowl - The chashu pork in curry over rice. The serving of meat is less due to the curry. The curry is so-so and a bit salty. Added with everything else, I think it's a bit too much. I'd prefer the regular Chashu Bowl.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place for a nice authentic ramen restaurant.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,6,2,4,xO2auMvpHXi7ANi8ZSEQKw

I had started with the small bowl of charshu curry. I will be the first to admit that I have had my fair share of bad curry, especially of the Japanese variety, and have develop a phobia about trying it again. I got so many shocked reactions due to my declaration against it that I had to try it again. It was actually very good. I like their pickled radish here. It is slightly sweet and paired well with the curry. A few days later, I made a curry for a potluck and I might not dislike the Japanese version as much as I initially thought. I was still ravenous and ordered a bowl of the menma ramen as well. I am a huge fan of bamboo. It can be fresh, cured, or dried. If it is an option, I am ordering it.

Santouka ramen, jinya ramen, daikokuya, tsujita and many other ramen restaurants make sora ramen unnecessary and a con operation for people who have never tried really good ramen.

The manager, her name is Shinaya or something like that, hestitantly took me to be sitted at the bar but I wanted to sit at a table. Then the manager rolled her eyes and gave me attitude for wanting to sit there. Upon talking with the manager because my appetite had been ruined by the managers rude behavior she tried to justify her actions by telling me she let me sit there instead of another couple of customers who came after me. The manager said this couple are regulars and that they didnt want to sit at the bar either. Even when I told her that i came before her she still insisted that she did me a service by giving me the table instead of them. BTW there were other tables available it was not too busy at the time. The manager did not apologize until I reminded her she didn't even apologize for ruining my experience there; she just kept trying to justify her rude behaviour. She refused to give me the name of her superior and would not give me the name of anyone else who I could speak with regarding her terrible attitude to a customer.

Yeah, I can't call it.  Decided to finally visit Sora this past Friday and had been extremely intrigued by all the yelpers who prefer Sora over Monta and vice versa.  I actually convinced myself that Sora probably had better Ramen because even though I love Monta's version, I've sort of gotten bored of it and find myself ordering the Pork Belly Bowl more often.   

Decided to go with the Spicy Miso bowl and was also fortunate enough to be able to try the Shoyu Ramen as well.  I really liked the noodles at Sora, moreso than Monta as I felt they were more al dente than what I've had at Monta which is what I prefer.  The pork and egg gave me the same pleasurable dining experience that I get from Monta.   As for the broth, in the beginning I actually thought it was a little bland, even after I tried to mix it all up.   With each bite, it became better and better and by the end of my bowl, I felt it had a lot of depth.   The next time I go I actually think I'm going to hold off a few minutes before digging right in as difficult as that will be to do.   The longer those ingredients, and in particular the spicy ground pork, stew in the broth, the better.  I think overall I found it to be as enjoyable as my favorite broth at Monta, the tonkatsu.

I also tried some of the Shoyu broth and actually wasn't impressed with it.   I thought it tasted fairly thin and not nearly as flavorful as Monta's version. I do need to explore their side offerings some more before trying to break this tie, but for now it is what it is.

I like going outside of the Vegas strip and tourist attractions to see what amazing food adventures we can stumble upon. Well, with the help of Yelp, I searched for ramen and bam! This was on the top of the list! It must be really good, oh wait, it goes by distance...oh well. Anyway, from the reviews I read, it is a really great place that many locals seem to go to. Great, I thought, that means we can get great quality ramen minus the high Vegas pricing! This place is in the heart of Chinatown. The reviews are right! Thank you locals for helping me add this into my food adventure! Plus, anything within range of a university means 1.) cheap food and 2.) amazingly delicious food! Score!

The place is small and can probably fit about 30 people. The wait can be long, but we got there relatively early and were seated within 10 minutes. It is a very cozy setting and the staff is very friendly. They gave great recommendations. The menu was easy to follow and had really good pictures and descriptions of the food items. I like 2 sided menus because that means that there popular items are all that matters and everything flows well and that the restaurant focuses on it's specialties. I got the spicy miso ramen which was filling and provided great warmth considering it was freezing outside! My cousin got the Super Vengeance, which is supposed to be a very spicy miso ramen. She tells me it's not that spicy, but she has a pretty high tolerance for spicy food! I loved the green tea that they served because it was hot and crisp and felt very clean. The soups were very delicious and not as salty as some other ramen places I know. Glad we found this place to fill our bellies but to also keep us warm. 

It was great meeting the locals as well for they gave more recommendations as to where to find good eats (bookmarked!). I felt like Andrew Zimmerman on the travel channel...SO dreams do come true?!?",5Hym66RYRlDkFkvYpw04OQ,1,1,5,fxukK13mWO2ZH8MI7XTDJQ

I'll always lean toward something with a little more heat and Sora has the spiciest ramen I've ever had called the Screaming for Vengeance.

We had a 15 minute wait for the very small dining room on a mid Saturday afternoon, but there's seating inside and a bench outside for you to relax once you put your name on the list. Service was friendly and fast for us as we were in and out in about 45 minutes. It's a pretty small menu with no tonkotsu. You can choose to have a bowl that's focused on a specific topping such as nori, negi, or menma. The ""deluxe"" is the way to go if you like all the toppings.

As for my miso Screaming for Vengeance, don't let the heavier broth with a nice lump of killer spicy meat fool you into thinking this is some kind of docile animal. It's a beast and the heat hit me midway, at the end, and stayed way past its welcome all the way until a couple of hours later when I could still feel some burning in my stomach. I'd give it an easy 8/10, pushing 9 to the point where I needed every napkin to dry off the lingering effects of the heat. I still enjoyed the noodles and the chasu, but the heat was right on the border of too much.

Also ordered were a miso ramen and two shoyu chashu ramens. All bowls were slurped up quickly and without complaint. The total was $43 for four.

Whatever you do, don't pass up the appetizer menu. The Seared Pork Chashu ($4) was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Period.

I like how it's in it's own separate vicinity, which means they have their own parking lot, which also means no angry Asian lady ripping her hair apart trying to get a damn parking spot. I also like their miso broth, jam-packed with umami, and from what I know, most akin to my taste-buds. 

Usually, my visits end with a good feeling in my mind, heart, and tummy, but I couldn't quite stomach that same feeling during my last two experiences. 

Perhaps it was because I decided to try new bowls apart from my usual corn and butter bowl, but I ordered the deluxe bowl from one visit and the chashu bowl on another visit. 

On my first visit, the service was just lacking greatly. Water wasn't served until 15 minutes into our seating and I doubt the waitress heard my order correctly because when I asked her why there wasn't butter on my ramen, she had a look as if she didn't know there was even supposed to be butter in the first place. 

On my second visit, when I ordered the chashu ramen bowl, everything tasted great except for the star of the bowl itself! Usually Ramen Sora's chashu is almost creamy, if I say so myself. Like other reviewers quote, a ""perfect ration between meat and fat."" It's almost like it melts in your mouth. Two out of the three pieces in my bowl were just the opposite of tender, and left me giving them to my partner since he'll eat anything. Ruined my appetite.

Despite these two recent experiences, I still have to admit that Ramen Sora is good at what it's supposed to do, and that's to make a good bowl of ramen at a decent price and experience. I won't let these two blunders affect my rating as I know how good this shop can be when it really tries to, despite their obvious inconsistencies. 

Next time, I'll just opt out of so much chashu, and stick to the same old one amazing piece that you get in every bowl.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,11,8,4,OEnfr2es0TYIIDpU6H_RzQ

I should have known I was in good hands with a group of Yelpers.. many of them of Asian decent. (Is that PC? Christina W. where are you when I need you??)

The wait was long, but I take that as a sign of quality, not weakness. We did have a party of 12 so what does one expect? I was just grateful that my fingers and toes were able to thaw from our Yelp Helps event.

The menu was complicated for someone who didn't know the first thing about ramen, in that there aren't really descriptions for anything. But I was pleased to see that every ramen offering had a photo. So really my decision was a matter of what looked the tastiest or least complicated. I settled on Miso Ramen $7.50. I figured it was a good basic and if it was yummy I could try something more adventurous next time.

The noodles are handmade on location and were thick and tasty - not at all like the store bought packages I grew up with. The meat was tender and fell apart at the slightest touch. I wasn't starving, so I took most of it home to the bf who gobbled up the leftovers (his first time with ramen too). I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really was.

The service once seated was top notch. Our waitress was patient, split our checks and got everyone's order correct with the exception of one missed green tea. Not an easy task when dealing with 12 yelpers who were taking pictures and taking notes.

Anyway...check yo car on the way out. Service was friendly and fast as we were meeting people already there and who go there regularly.

Neither  the noodles(texture) nor broth(salt seemed the main flavor), or the fact that the bamboo shoots were so over cooked they were barely recognizable as bamboo shoots (a grayish brown string)and were cut long and thin like fries. Good thing I didn't order extra bamboo shoots. The egg also ends up gray for the white part..even though the broth isn't gray? ?

Ok so first off, don't hate... I am giving it only 3 stars because facts are facts and I've had better. I just came from Japan, where I lived for the last 7 yrs. 
with that being said.... There is a trick to this 3 rating... 
Ok so my Japanese wife is with me, and matter of fact she has only been away from our home in Japan for about a week, and already missing the food... So she yelped and found this spot. As far as authentic, she blessed off and said yes it's really Japanese ramen... However, it's not like the best. 
Her exact words were, ""this is good, for America.. You know if this place was in Japan, it would get some business...""
So on a 10 pt scale... Including Japan, this ramen is about a 5..... Like Tenkaippin... HOWEVER... (Here's the catch)... As far as USA ramen places go... It's like an 8!! 
So I figured... 3 stars would do. Even Sakino JUST said to me, ehhh I don't mind coming back... Pretty good stuff. 
So don't really worry about my picky opinion. I'm a die hard true blue 110% loyal to my #1 favorite ramen spot in Okinawa and honestly nothing will ever compete... But Sakino is Japanese, from Japan, and vouched for this place. Again, she gave it a Japanese 5 but a USA 8.... And since we're obviously on the US right now.... This is the place to be. 
We both got the spicy ramen, rice, mochi ice cream. The SUPER spicy one was like crazy hot...lol. The regular spicy is just fine... No need for more. 
The rice was decent. Mochi was fine. Service friendly and nice and quick. No issues with the staff or facility! And again, I can't go above 3 stars cuz honestly TASTE wise, it's a 3 star place... But that's cuz I've been to the ramen Mecca and back... So for here, you more than likely will NOT find better ramen than this place! Take it or leave it....

I came here with high hopes hoping this would be thick, flavorfulass soup that Asa or Santouka would bring but alas. It was more on the thin side and the spicy miso that I chose was made differently. It did not come as a paste as it normally does, this was infused with pork, so my pescatarian friend was unable to eat it :s

The noodles were very chewy and the egg was okay.. I liked that it was runny but it wasn't mindblowingly good like other places that do not come to mind. 

The pork was super thick. It was on the tender side and was marbled with bits of the luscious fat but it didn't make my eyes roll back..

Found this place on YELP after having a craving for Japanese Ramen.  The last place I had been for true Japanese Ramen was Ippudo in NY so this had a lot to live up to!  

They have a few other things on the menu but come here for the Ramen.  It is a noodle soup dish with added ingredients of pork, seaweed, corn, eggs or greens.  Really your choice.  I opted for the Deluxe with everything in it and was not disappointed.  The key to any ramen restaurant is the soup.  I have read some of the other reviews that felt the broth was hit or miss but on the night we were there it was spot on!  You want to save the broth it is so good and you will find yourself licking the bowl after you drink from it!  

Compared the restaurants on the strip this place is dirt cheap!  Great food at a great price... very refreshing in Vegas.  This restaurant is located in the China Town.

Moving on, I dropped in this place when they first opened and later left since it was cash only at the time.

So I managed to return with the main squeeze since she recommended trying the place out, why not?

Do keep in mind that there is a small parking lot at the rear that can be tricky with people coming and going, so be careful when exiting to the street.

There was a 5 minute wait, which I told myself must be a good sign.  Once seated, we were sharing a large table with another group separated with a makeshift partition that was also a special menu.  Kinda like a science project board or something of the sort.

Anyhow, I read on Yelp that a lot of people enjoyed the Killer Spicy Ramen A.K.A. Screaming for Vengeance...so I had to give it a try, in shoyu broth.  Apparently they offer shio (salt), miso (fermented bean), and shoyu (soy sauce) broth...I wish they had kotteri.  In addition to that, my girl got the Deluxe Miso Ramen while I added a Curry Chashu Bowl, Gyoza and tall Kirin Ichiban draft beer.  What's puzzling to me is that if this type of ramen originated from Hokkaido, why isn't there Sapporo on tap?

It didn't take long for the food to come out and began nibbling on the Curry Chashu Bowl immediately.  Its yummy but was quick to notice that their chashu is doesn't melt in your mouth like it does at Monta.  It is, in fact, very similar to Fukimimi Ramen chashu, a little bit chewier but there is a grilled or smoked flavor that was received very well.

When the ramen arrived, like all soups, I like to take a second or two to taste the broth by itself before loading up any condiments or additives.  I was surprised to learn that the broth was not that spicy, given the name...it was more like whispering for vengeance.  I was praying that it was a creeper and would live up to its name, but unfortunately that never happened.  Thick ramen noodles were included versus Monta and Fukumimi, which is not a bad thing for me.  If I had to choose, ranking would be Monta, Ramen Sora, then Fukumimi, when it comes to ramen noodles alone.  I am not sure if it is handmade here either.

The ramen was pretty disappointing and tasted very much like a mad scientist concoction of instant ramen packets with a heavy dose of togarashi.  My girl was not very please with her ""Deluxe"" as well and we decided to get it over with and get our fill before heading over to the Ice Skating Yelp event at the Cosmo, thanks Misti Y. for the free tickets...well Darlene R. thanks you, she was the Elite member to receive them.

I left the place full and can admit that the only good thing in the ramen is the red fishy chili oil sauce used to garnish the bowl of ramen, other than that, probably will have to rank  this near the bottom of the pack in terms of ramen.  Some  katsuobushi, wakame or togarashi would be nice too.  I still want to come in for the butter corn ramen since it was my initial pick.  So lesson learned, go with your instinct Yelpers.  LOL.

Oh yeah, another thing, when it comes to ramen and pho, I came to notice a lot of people are very particular to certain flavors, so much of this is to each his/her own.  I like to do research on the whole culture to know what I am searching for in good ramen or pho.  Also, forgot to mention that those that like ramen may want to try Taiwanese and Chinese noodle soup as well...Wendy's Noodle Cafe & Yi Mei Champion Taiwanese Deli.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,2,1,2,QCcY-com8zDBmQZTjrNqig

My main issues with Sora are the following:
A) no tonkatsu base... I like the richness of the tonkatsu and feel that the soy base is too salty B) The giant piece of seaweed they stuck in my soup made it kinda fishy and I'm not down with that

I suggest the corn butter ramen with miso base, as this provides a pop of flavor, and the butter gives the broth a silky flavor and texture that I have yet to see matched in the ramen community. They also have options for spicy meat (or the more sinisterly named ""killer spicy"" meat for those who dare) if you want an extra punch of flavor.

You really can't compare the noodles or the broth to other spicy ramen and I have had my share of them.  Orochan Ramen in little Tokyo doesn't even come close to how perfectly spicy and flavorful Ramen sora made theirs, but Orochan Ramen is way spicier, now having said that I still wouldn't want Ramen Sora to change a thing.  I am really glad my friends and I tried this place out and found a gem.  It literally doesn't get better than this and I may have to attribute the balanced flavors to the noodles that were pretty eggy in flavor but hands down its probably what contributed so much to making it right, spicy and delicious.  

The restaurant is small so the capacity isn't very big it could probably fit around thirty plus people.  Come early or wait and if you do wait keep waiting because its well worth the wait.

I think this place beats out Monta. The ramen here as described by many others is a little heavier and has that al dente bite to it. The chashu pork is thicker and isn't a small little sliver. And I know this is super weird to say but it actually feels good in there temperature wise. I know many may think who the f- cares, but that's huge when it'll be the summertime soon and you're trying to put down a bowl of hot ramen. At Monta you're right where the kitchen is and sometimes the sun hits that window at that perfect magnifying angle where its just hot (insert hooker in church joke here) but Ramen Sora doesn't have that issue so I like that. Additionally, the service is friendly and quick.

The only thing I can say that Monta beats them out on is the broth. The broth didn't jump out at me like Montas tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Also, theres no napkin dispenser, they just lay down one napkin. I know weird, but when you eat with a messy eater who keeps spilling soup all over himself like he's literally trying to wash his face with it, one napkin won't cut it. (Dont worry,  your sloppy table manner secrets are safe with me Steve).

The $5.85 pork fried rice was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I shy away from bacon and pork usually but this was AMAZING.  The pork was salty and tender like pot roast and my mouth is watering right now thinking about it.  This is a must-order!!!!

I like my ramen with some spice, so I noticed that they started to offer a spicy sauce upon request. So spicy ramen with chachu it was. It was good but in the end some thing was a bit lacking. The broth had flavor but not a rich taste and the spicy sauce was ok a bit weak in my opinion. Couple of days later, next stop Sora Ramen. Ordered the same, the difference is  noticeable the broth here has a deep rich pork flavor wether it is miso, shoyu or shiso. Even the flavor and look of the chachu has is better here. As for the spiciness? You can ask for a scoop of ""Killer Meat"", which is ground meat cooked in, from what I'm told, 15 different types chili for a long time.  This gives it a nice deep spicy flavor that gives a bold flavor but won't leave you crying . In my opinion Sora tops in all categories from basic to spicy. They offer a variety of add-ins such as corn, butter and extra meat. If you go, get there early as this place gets packed. Highly recommend.",SuY0obGvypUzqYiiI0Q1_A,0,0,5,PusxTgy8hSgTCmhGPS4BsQ

So the other day I went to Monta.  It's hard to compare the two b/c we did tonkatsu there and that option isnt avail here.  Instead we asked for their most popular options, which were the house and the spicy, so we opted for the latter and chose a miso broth (shio and shoyu were the other options).  For on $1, we upgraded to the large, which is like kaedama.  We only ordered one bowl to share bc our past few days of gluttony is catching up to us!

So I like the noodle here a lot more.  It's thicker and not over-cooked.  And even though I always prefer tonkotsu, this broth was delish!  And the spicy is not wimpy at all.  As for the fixings, there was a good amount of it, and the chashu was even tastier than Monta's.  The soft boiled egg was a bit overdone, but still good.

I was surprised how quickly the restaurant fills up. We got there at opening, and a line quickly formed.

+The decor. It's small and efficient and straightforward. 

What left me wanting more.

+The service. The water I was served was half-full and the ordering process was rushed. A little patience and kindness goes a long way and I'm new to the ramen world. I fully admit that I need a little hand holding when it comes to ramen and noodles in general.

You walk in and get this amazing welcome. 
The place was definately smaller than I thought. I mean I know it's a small building, I just thought they would have had more chairs and tables inside.

I have been wanting to try this place since it first opened and I finally did one day during my lunch break. I arrived shortly after opening time and it was quiet but boy oh boy did that place fill up very quickly.

I ordered the spicy hot soup (can't remember the name)  with shoyu broth but very similar to the deluxe. I added bean sprouts to my soup and also ordered the gyoza.

My Ramen was just okay. I don't know if it was the reviews that I read that let me down or if I am a Ramen snob. Either way, it was just okay. The broth was good, flavorful, the noodles were neither here nor there for me. The noodles I was not a fan of. I love a good chew to my noodle but these just didn't work for me.

The pork belly in my soup was so tender and good though. The seaweed I wanted more but refused to pay $1.00 for 3 sheets. My egg could have been cooked less but needless to say, I love egg in my Ramen so not too much of a gripe for me.

The gyoza however, hands down some of the best I have ever had in my life. Simply put: they were cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful on the inside. I felt like I won the jackpot with this dish.

Would  I go back? Yes, why not. I would love to try their miso broth and I gotta go back for the gyoza. But I am not in a big rush to return.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,4,2,3,PCmyt_PceHSuSHBzJtvhDQ
5918935,2012-02-06,0,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Ramen noodles are thicker and chewier; shio broth is flavorful but not too salty; the chashu is generous compared to most, if not all, of the local Las Vegas competition. Good reason to come back for more, not to mention that the wait staff are friendly and will get the answers to the questions you ask about the food and restaurant, if they don't know the answer.

I dropped by Ramen Sora after seeing the new signage on Spring Mountain Rd, and was waiting for it to finally be opened.  What can I say, I love ramen to the point that I actually went to a Ramen Museum while visiting Japan with friends I met during college. I have developed a certain personal preference for what I considered great ramen, and the thinker noodles served here is one of those pluses in my ramen critique formula.  The broth has good flavor without being overly greasy or too salty.  The chashu is pretty good, almost melt-in-your mouth tender, and the portions served in my Deluxe Ramen was more generous than the competition.  Although the overall portion is on the smallish side for me, and I definitely need to pay the nominal fee for the extra noodles.  Or order one of the side rice bowls.

Anyway, they seemed to be off to a decent start, already earning 4.5 stars on 7 reviews on Yelp in the first 2-3 days of opening.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.

I definitely would recommend this ramen restaurant, which is their first US store to open, making this an international ramen chain with two more locations in Sapporo, Japan (Hokkaido area). Being a Sapporo-style ramen-ya, their miso ramen is a definite must try, since it originated there and uses akamiso (red soybean paste).

Food:  4/5  The best, or the top two ramen option in Las Vegas.

Service:  5/5  Friendly, not too pushy, and attentive.

Value:  4/5  Generous with the chashu, but the regular bowl of ramen is not that large.  I definitely need to exercise the kaedama (extra noodle) option.

Location:  Not too far from the Strip on Spring Mountain Road.

Parking:  3/5  Private lot, but it is not that big.  But there are usually street parking if the lot is full.

One positive is they do offer various flavored broths.  Secondly, they offer cheap ($2-3) mini rice bowls that you typically see at Ramen joints.  You can order that as a side item to compliment your slurping meal.  Third, there are various toppings like corn that you can add as an extra cost.

Usually when I try a place for the first time, I always attempt the classic flavors so that it serves as a basis for comparing to other places.  So I elected for the chashu bowl in shio style (salt).  Unlike my favorite places, the flavor was not as ""popping.""  When you eat Ramen, the broth has to shine.  I would say it was mediocre at best.  The noodles themselves was also different from what I'm use to.  A positive note however is the sliced chashu pork was pretty good!  

The mini rice bowls I got to try were the grilled pork and grilled pork with curry.  Both tasted very good and easily finishable if you are hungry.

5939279,2013-05-14,22,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,"Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called ""best ramen"" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA! 

We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.

I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me. 

For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a ""knock-off"" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely true.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being true to protocol. 

Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving ""curly"" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso. 

The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult. 

People in Los Angeles think they know what good or ""authentic"" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change.
