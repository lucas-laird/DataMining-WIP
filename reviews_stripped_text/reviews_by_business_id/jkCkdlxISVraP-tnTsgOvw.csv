991616,2010-04-04,0,jkCkdlxISVraP-tnTsgOvw,This place is not closed but it should be. I just ordered at the drive-thru. The quality is HORRIBLE. The burger was cold and not fresh. The onion rings were probably sitting under the heat lamp for hours. The soda was flat and had no flavor. Go to jack in the box if you want your after midnight meals/snacks. DO NOT go to this Burger King. This place SUCKS!!!! The quality is waaaaaay below the standard.,HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,2,0,1,jSTbV4cp6I7tqtV3c-zzug

Cassidy was the cashier and while i looked up at the board deciding what we wanted, she did not give me any impression she was irritated as what I normally feel at fast food places. In fact she was the opposite. She asked me to take my time. She offered me coupons. She even waited for me to finish getting my drink to let me know my food was ready. I felt very welcomed here and would definately come back and recommend this burger king for everyone!
Cassidy deserves a raise or sometype of mini award, because these kinds of employees you want to keep!",dEkS9SauP57PP9NSrkHbPA,0,0,5,R2yWBf50xnbHrQkPDTSzEA

I I had asked the manager if they could put tomatoes and onions 2 make a Whopper dog but he only said no.

My boyfriend ask for ketchup and she said its in the bag and closed the window with attitude. My boyfriend waited at the window and when she open the window asked for more she wasn't happy we didn't even want to ask for anything else. Then we got home and they forgot straws no wonder they have one star the food is good that's the ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars but guys have to really work on your customer service",6_AugSHouBMud2ngS-RoqQ,0,0,2,m37zjecfwi6VALJA9S88Qg

Every time I've come to this location something has gone wrong, and I have been coming to this Burger King infrequently since before it was struck by lightening and  rebuilt. My most recent visit had me waiting in my hot car when it was 106 degrees outside for almost half an hour because the drive thru staff had me pull around to the front of the building and completely forgot about my order. The food was sitting out for who knows how long before I went in to get it myself. If you have a craving for Burger King do yourself a favor and pick another location. This one falls short of the standard.",CYccznHIW4f7dvy9jY1wPQ,0,0,1,FLVGPZdD6rod3gP1vBF_PQ
