My wife ordered chicken tacos and I ordered chicken burrito. For drink we both ordered water with lemon wage. The server came back right away with water no lemon.  When the food arrived, my wife got beef tacos instead of chicken. I'm not sure how it's happen but we didn't sent it back to the kitchen.  My chicken burrito was dry as a bone. This time we had to sent it back to the kitchen.  When I explained to our server that the burrito is dry and not eatable, he just picked it up in his hand and looked at it for a minute and asked me if I wanted something else instead. I ordered chicken fajita. Once again the chicken was too dry but at this point I already lost my petite.Moreover, all the side dishes were in poor quality. The rise was too try. The salsa was old like it was standing in the cooler over night. We could just go to one of the Mexican fast food restaurants and get better quality then that.  the one star up there is for the chips and salsa.",N_OpnbPJAakJrVch8VBQ9Q,1,0,1,ZWAS325gJJt3_dduQvQ3vw

My friends tried the battered fish tacos and they said they were good, but the tater sauce was a little too spicy for their taste. The service was very good.

I loved that because I've been to places and our server would just leave and not let us know. So great service here, but food was just ok.",8-dMSM5RsZVlQyuJ7PEhYQ,0,0,3,A0wCC5aMQfwoX7XIieEcWw

408876,2013-01-23,0,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"This review is based on the bar area & bar food.

First off, I have to say that the chips & salsa were not too bad. I have been to pretty decent Mexican restaurants with worse salsa. Sooo easy to make, yet I don't get how so many places can screw it up.  

Moving right along...I also had the Tapatio chicken wings, which were a little on the spicy side for me, but, they were very tasty. I would order them again, as well as recommend them.

The Bartender was quiet, but friendly & helpful. I actually ordered a Pineapple Mojito, which is a rarity for me, since I'm not a drinker, with the exception of the occasional Malibu Rum & Pineapple ;) However, the sound of Malibu Pineapple Rum in this drink kind of sealed the deal. It was quite good, actually, very refreshing too. I will also add that, I was kind of stoked from having just won $150 bucks on Caveman Keno, which probably put me into such a festive mood.

Overall, I think I might try out the actual restaurant itself, one day.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,0,1,3,snXuwTqNwPV6AUKlJTJTYQ

Sat at the bar and the first thing that happens is we get a bartender that is by far the worst I have ever seen in 20 plus years in this town.
There aren't enough words to describe this guy but RUDE is a big one among other I probably can't say here.
We ordered food and drink and having to argue with him to do so then asked for our check and he just stared at us and went past us to talk to some new customers.
We then had to ask the bar back to get our check.
OMG this guy really needs to get fired and when we returned home and looked at the receipt there was his name GERARD.
In any other situation I would not have tipped at all but thought of the other people there who deserve their share of tips so did leave something but not even close to what I would have.
The food...it is what it is; Santa Fe Station Cabo food. Don't expect alot and you won't be disappointed.",s6pCPu6_IwXKHsxaiD9Zsg,0,1,1,qOlX1aSCYsjWqe3A7_YZyA

It was edible but possibly the worst Mexican food I have had since I can remember.  nothing out of the typical enchilada, burrito, tamale category. I love a good authentic tamale as much as the next person - but you aren't finding it here. The service was prompt and they refilled our salsa a number of times so that was the only highlight. I had the tamale/chile relleno combo and hubby had the chimichanga and we switched half way through. He said his black beans were ice cold.  The chicken in the chimichanga was dry and it was soggy. Also ordered a pitcher of house margarita - $22, and it was pretty weak. It was suprisingly busy in there but mostly the older crowd.. I liked one of the salsas and the service was okay but other than that I was disappointed.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,3,1,1,qRGvkrRLxiYZpXkhePuEzQ

When we arrived at the restaurant inside Santa Fe Station Casino, we were told it was a 15 minute wait even though there were plenty of empty tables. Our little buzzer didnt even alert us that our table was ready, someone just randomly came out from the other side of the restaurant and sat us. We got the chips and salsa and bean dip 5 minutes later which was delicious. Our waiter came to get our drink order at super fast speed and then disappeared for a while. It seems that EVERY time he came to our table, he was finding an excuse to leave our table--as if he was rushing to be somewhere else even though there was no one else in the restaurant except 2 people at the bar (it was a monday night). Maybe they were short staffed and he was the cook also?!?!? who knows because it wasnt explained. Anyway, the enchiladas were pretty good, they make you order a fountain drink as a condition of getting the all you can eat though. They bring out all three for the first course, beef, cheese and chicken. After that you order as you finish your current enchilada. They dont let you take it to go but they do let you take it home if you're too full. My husband ordered the chimichungas and he said they were really really good.

781940,2012-06-05,0,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"We've eaten at this restaurant a few times and this past experience was very disappointing.  The service was delayed and the food was horrible.  We were served the chips and salsa right away when we were seated and our waiter captured our beverage orders in a timely fashion.  I ordered the veggie fajitas and bf asked if he could order a burrito with veggies, black beans and cheese.  No problem, order was submitted and beverages were being consumed.  

Our food arrives...my fajitas were sizzling but the flavor and seasoning was lacking and the vegetables were really raw, like they might have made contact with the grill top for a minute or two before being transferred to the cast iron plate.  There were corn kernels in the mix and they were stale and chewy like they had been sitting out awhile.  Bf's burrito was a disaster.  Inside he found an obscene amount of cheese and a couple traces of vegetables.  The beans were served on the side rather than as requested.  When the cheese congealed together he wasn't able to eat any more because of the texture.   This is when we dissected it looking for the morsels of vegetables.  By now, our drinks were empty but we couldn't see our waiter so we just waited so we could pay and leave.

We also noticed the other tables in our area were not being attended too.  One table had to sit and look at their food sitting on the server's tray wondering if they should just get up and put it on the table themselves.  A large group behind us commented about their lack of beverages after they had been seated for quite a while.  It seemed odd to me because the restaurant was full of staff and maybe only 60% full of customers.  

If management reads this, please consider making your bean dip and rice without lard and chicken stock. For those of us that are vegetarian/vegans we would really appreciate it.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,1,0,2,m6LrlwhJELxUcwN0oYB9VA

969075,2012-08-17,0,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"Well, I must say we are frequent visitors of CABO because of thier fajitas.  Usually pretty consistent.  We've had a few issues over the years but nothing that wasnt fixed.

Over the last couple weeks we have been twice and seen a rapid decline in thier customer service.  Last Saturday night around 10pm (time may have been a problem), we walked in and either intrerupted employee's discussion at the bar because either they were laughing at their convo or laughing at us.  Immediately we felt awkward walking in.  Only a few tables had people being that it was a little on the late side.  We were served some stale chips and salsas which we had some of while we waited for our drink order or dinner order for that matter-which never happen.  Apparently it was social hour amongst the Cabo staff because after 20 minutes of waiting for someone we looked around in sloooow motion (like in a movie) and the employees were in multiple areas chit chatting instead of taking care of their customers.  We waited a few more minutes and were so disgusted that we left and went somewhere else for a late night dinner.  :( big bummer.

Now LAST NIGHT, we were seated around 7pm Friday night...the place was pretty busy.  We were served our STALE chips with all the crumbs at the bottow.  Seems like a usual....hm.  The salsa a little watered down.  BTW I must say BF very disappointed that the salsa verde is not being served anymore.  :(  Anyways, our server Colleen - has worked there so long....and has lost her luster.  She looked so worn down and was not happy to be there at all....barely talked to us.  I rememember when she first started to work there she had a pep in her step....not anymore. :(  Anyways, regardless of the chips and salsa and service....our fajitas were good.....on a happy note.  I do love amazing chips and salsa though..thats part of going to a mexican restaurant.....that they dont have anymore.

1 star on the chips and salsa, 2 stars on service and 3 stars on the fajitas (still not deserving 3 stars).....all to leave a little desired for being the BEST place to work in Las Vegas~Station Casinos. ;)  Customer service is key Mr. Fratita!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,1,1,2,WZoEcgFm75zbmyuQ1tumhA

Unfortunately, our server was a total Debbie Downer whose initially peppy attitude did a 180 as soon as she found out we didn't intend to order a full meal. Our waters stayed empty, a bill was slapped on our table, and she repeatedly walked by and said ""thanks for coming"" as if to shoo us out early.

2069224,2012-05-27,0,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"My constant readers know that I am about as fair as possible when writing reviews, always looking to find something to recommend, but I am afraid the only thing in this particular Cabo was the Bean Dip and I am sure that was out of a can as the tortilla chips were out of a can.

My urgent warning is STAY AWAY FROM HERE. Here is why:

After taking a bite of my entree there was a high acid, high metalic, high ""Smoke"" taste that was quite simply hazardous. If this was just in the rice I could live with it, but it was intensely pervasive in the Fajita Burrito as well. After literally two bit I stop and even after being offered a new entree I refused for fear of truly being poisoned. I do not know what the exact contaminant was but since it was in the rice and burrito it was a systemic issue and that tells me no matter what the entree there was a problem.

My wife's plate had the same problem but after a couple of bites she had to find a restroom before making a public scene and having the food returned in the ""Roman"" manner.

I have eaten in some of the best Mexican Style eateries in the world, lord knows L.A. has a ton of them. But when the manager insists the food is fine (without tasting it) I must be mistaken. I had sent the food back after two bites so it is not likely my germs were on that plate, there were more germs from the cook and server on it than me and still she wouldn't touch it (or maybe she knew there was a problem). After that the excuse was that it couldn't have a problem because the Health Department gave them an ""A"" rating which of course means absolutely nothing today when the inspection was whenever in the past.

Fortunately I was not expected to pay for those entrees, but a tab did come along for the Iced Teas we drank. I pointed out that my wife was no longer enjoying that Iced Tea and only then were we free to leave, hungry but without an appetite.

So, why am I so upset? It's not like this is the first time I have eaten food from a questionable kitchen, but it is the first time no-one seemed to care about it. Here was a restaurant full of people who were possibly exposed to something very bad and they were still sending out plates. INEXCUSABLE.

Will this kitchen get better? Most likely but the same team will still be there and I know I will NEVER be back because the place is more interested in serving bad food (in more then one sense) than being safe.

The Health Department should be informed.

---

As an aside I asked myself why people were not running out of the place when I realized it is quite possible people didn't realize something was wrong and opposed to making a scene and returning the food ate it thinking ""Maybe this is how it's supposed to taste."" If you think that absurd realize most people will keep drinking that bottle of rare vintage wine even if it turned to vinegar years ago because it is a ""rare vintage"" and are told it is good. This happens a lot.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,4,1,1,v2r4NNRg7VGLcnv3Iv7bxA

2284812,2011-02-01,1,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"I am quite surprised at the current ratings of this restaurant! (1.5 stars), I guess mainly because the lack of reviews. I actually have been really wanting to try this restaurant since I live close by Santa Fe Station and see the specials for this restaurant all the time. And since Stations Casinos is so kind as to offer dining credits to us all the time, it was time for some Mexican food!

Well, this is your average chain restaurant. The food was very average. The items we had were not AMAZING and were not horrible either. I have posted pictures of the food we did order.

I would actually rate this place 3.5 stars. The bonus for the chips and dip you get when you first get seated. The chips were warm and they offer 4 different dips! (3 levels of spicy, and a bean dip.) I loved it all! I guess almost filled up on that alone, but I wanted real food.

Me and the bf ordered the Cabo Party Platter $11.99 (appetizer) to share and the Combo #6 ($12.99) to share. The appetizer was pretty good. But not great. More than half the plate (quite a good sized order) was of nachos which were not that great, but the dip that came with us (an orangey colored creamy dip) was awesome for everything on the platter. The quesadillas were ... bland. But the other items on the platter were good.

And Combo #6. Slightly disappointing. The Chili Relleno was just bad. Pretty tasteless. The Chicken Tamale was also disappointing. Barely had any filling. But the beef taco was yummy!

I think we filled up too much on chips and saved no room for dessert. Bummer. I wanted to try the deep fried ice cream. Oh well.

Service was not too bad. We got seated right away and got the chips and dip right away and she actually explained each dip. But we were so into the menu and chips we didn't realize nobody came to take our drink orders. Until about 10 minutes later. But then they took our food orders right after.

Atmosphere: Ok, but pretty dark
Arrived during the late afternoon, there was still sun out. Upon entering the restaurant, there were lights on from the colorful chandeliers, but it was still rather dark.

Service: Excellent!
The servers were nice and we were seated quickly. Cabo was not crowded when we arrived.

Food: Tasty, but nothing extraordinary
I ordered some tacos. They all came with the fixings separate. I enjoyed the tacos, but they were nothing that I have not tasted before. All great nonetheless. However, like many Mexican restaurants, the tacos were a bit pricey.

Summary: Not bad at all!

I'm allergic to dairy, so it's always good to find a Mexican restaurant that doesn't drown their tacos in cheese and makes them the real way! 
The hubs had a steak quesadilla, Mom and brother got enchiladas suizas, and my SIL got the lettuce wraps. There wasn't a spot of food left on any of their plates, so you know it was good!

At this Cabo it is priced at $5.99 and was delicious. For my meal I ordered ""Cheese Enchiladas"" made with flour tortillas. I asked for very light sauce and when my meal was brought out the enchiladas were covered in sauce. I mentioned it to the server who said she told them to put very little. She then walked away and I figured I would see if I liked what was brought. Well, I didn't. The sauce tastes like it maybe comes from a can and is just nasty.

Like most places with this dish they put cheese in between the bacon and shrimp.  The presentation lost some points with me because some off the cheese was seeping out. But they served it with crispy fried onions and a tangy sauce, close to honey mustard but with a little kick. 
For my main dish, I had the chicken fajitas. This dish came with grilled chicken and vegetables, flour tortillas, Spanish rice, bean dip, sour cream and guacamole. If you don't have an appetite when you come here, order this dish and share with someone else.

This Cabo is located inside Sante Fe Station Casino, where you will find mostly locals.  The great thing about any restaurant at the Sante Fe Station Casino, there's almost no wait to be seated.  Yes, our locals at casinos located off the strip aren't here to eat.  Most are here to gamble.  We arrived with a group of 12 and our orders were taken almost immediately.  I ended up getting their chicken fajitas with double meat. I also asked that all the fun stuff (i.e. sour creams, guacamole, beans, rices, cheese, etc) be put on another plate. One last request was to have my chicken clean meaning no seasoning added.  After what seems like an eternity to get our food, I got half my request right.  Some, not all, items were put on another plate.  But I got my chicken clean, which is the most important.  Taste wise, I was satisfied and know it would have been better if I had the fun stuff added.  Our waitress was great and our server pleasant.  Overall, I have no complaints about Cabo. 

TIPS:
-Chips:  I didn't try at this location, but have tried it at other Cabo's.  I don't know what it is about their chips, but they are addicting.

The salad itself looked like it went through a blender. I tried to ask for it without tomatoes, but since I make it a point not to talk to peoples' back's I didn't get a chance to. Since it was blended it was a nightmare picking them out. 

Service was nothing amazing but I guess they did the job. I hate the uniforms they give these poor girls.

We went on an employee appreciation night, so it was pretty packed. 

In the beginning, I thought our server was crappy and I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt since it was employee appreciation night. I thought maybe she was just getting crappy customers and crappy tips all night long. By the end of the night, I was just convinced that she was a crappy server. 

When we got to our table, it smelled vaguely of vomit (I'm not sayin' someone vomited there ... it just smelled like someone vomited there), there was a huge puddle of something on the ground beneath the table, and my chair was sticky. We asked the hostess if we could get the puddle mopped up. They very politely obliged. 

After we got seated, our server came by to take our drink order. After that, there were unacceptably long intervals between her visits. 

The food was really bad, not seasoned well, hardly Mexican. Maybe Mexican inspired. For the food and service we got, we should have been paying Del Taco prices.

5227785,2014-11-07,4,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"In a word...this experience was underwhelming.

I remember coming to Cabo back when they first opened, years ago, and just LOVING the food.
Have my tastes matured that much, that what once was awesome, and worth a 40 minute wait for a table just isn't anymore?  Sure, I think maybe they've matured a little, but I really think its just a drop in standards. 

The whole night at Cabo was underwhelming, from the time we approached the hostess till we left, with the important exception of the service.  Our server was amazing, and the manager, after a bit of a misunderstanding in a complaint, was very receptive to criticism and feedback.

We arrived at the hostess station at about 6:35pm, and were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait...when there were plenty of open seats. We asked if we could just sit at a bar top, and she said that the servers were busy and had to catch up on their tables.

Ok, strike one, horribly understaffed.  

Then we noticed the time, and noticed that their happy hour ends at 7pm every day.  
Are they trying to seat us late so we don't take advantage of happy hour?  Not that there was a lot on the HH menu that we wanted but still...

Luckily, we were seated at about 6:50 (ten minutes to spare) and got our order of wings in for $5.

Our server, like I said before, was a treasure.  She was pleasant, and kept my water glass full the whole night.

It took a while to get our chips and salsa, which we discovered was because the kid bringing the chips was also the ONLY busser we saw on the floor...which brings in to question:  How are their sanitary practices?  The same guy who is bussing dirty dishes is bringing out our chips and salsa...no gloves.  Hm.

The chips were good, but the salsas were a little...boring.  Another stations property has a Mexican restaurant with a salsa bar, and a MUCH better selection of salsa's.  Boring, and disappointing.  

So our wings arrived, and they were standard wings...nothing to write home about.

When our entrees arrived, that was where the problems started occurring. 

My chimi fajita:   This thing is ENORMOUS.  Like...ridiculously huge, fed me at dinner last night and lunch today, and I STILL didn't eat the whole thing.   It was served with refried beans and cheese, Mexican rice, and a ""garnish"" of pico de gallo.  The pico was laughable.  If you're serving me pico, I want enough to put ON my chimichanga, and there wasn't enough on the plate for the first bite.  

As far as the flavor goes...it started off mediocre, with mostly just vegetables on the end.  As I got closer to the middle, I found the chicken ,and that was actually pretty nice.  

My fella ordered the steak fajitas, and was REALLY disappointed.
First of all, he ordered them with NO sour cream...and received his bowl of pico with sour cream in it.  

Second, on the fajita platter, there was ONE lonely, tiny stalk of cilantro.  One.  It was mostly stem too, no leaves. 

Worse of all though...the steak was bland!  We could have dropped it on the floor and stepped on it, and it would have had more flavor. 

At this point, we asked our server to speak to a manager.

When we told her about the steak being bland, I think she may have misunderstood what we were trying to do, and she said ""What would you like me to do to the steak."" 

Uh...yeah.  We got a little angsty after that bit, and stepped up our game, letting her know that we were simply trying to provide feedback, that the quality of the food was bland.  For advertising that the steak is marinated, it didn't taste that way at all.

After we explained ourselves a bit better, she was VERY apologetic, and offered to take the fajitas off the check (that wasn't  our goal, but since he didn't eat much of it, it was a nice offer that we accepted), and told us how much she valued our feedback.

The best part though, was that she came back out to the table after taking the food back, and said that she tried the steak, and that it WAS bland.  

So the good news is, if she is true to her word, and she seemed like she is the kind of person who cares about her business, she should get on the chefs to season their meat better.  
I was torn about giving Cabo 3 stars simply for her change of heart, but at the end of the day, the food just wasn't very good at all. 

I don't know that I'd come back here again, really...its on the other side of town, and there are better restaurants, but if I'm here and with someone who wants to come out, I probably won't say no.  I'd like to see if they actually make improvements.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,4,2,wHNVyt7uQt2F1bVzLPYmwQ

Quality of the food is just not there anymore. My family ordered the beach party appetizer, chicken tortilla soup, and fajitas for dinner last night. When the chile con queso dip says ""queso "" you would think there would be some resemblance to cheese. Nope. What we got was something that taste like butter flavored melted cream sauce. No tomato or chile as in their description. The other items on the platter was medioacre at best. Hubby says fajita was ok.

The problem was that the prices were on the high end, so unless you're starving I'd recommend finding a different place.",6TLmHF4m3HaIKGh8310sEg,0,0,2,anmzT3wFwV2s9u_jCfRkZQ
5318407,2018-04-08,1,EHDcxAlrrP4VPiZuQlrIrg,"This was our first, and last time eating here. Where do I begin? Initially we came here to kill time before seeing a movie ( Btw, the movie was A Quiet Place and it was great!) I asked for a drink menu, the waitress said they didn't have one. First red flag, had I seen a drink menu, I would have seen that they charge $12 per margarita.  For that price I expect delicious,  expertly crafted drinks. Nope. Basic margaritas you could probably get from a can with a TON of ice and very little actual drink. Now comes the chips , which were somewhat stale and the salsa was meh. Then we ordered our food. Our dinners were suppose to come with salads. After drinking our over priced BASIC margaritas, our entrees arrived. We asked our waitress what happened to our salads. Her response was basically ""Oops,  do you want me to wrap it to go?"" Like we're going to eat salads in the theatre? Now, the food. I took one bite of the fish in diablo sauce and immediately sent it back. It tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato paste, splashes some hot sauce in it, and tried to pass it off as authentic Mexican cuisine. By that point I didn't want to eat anything more from there and asked that my meal be taken off the bill. So for 2 dinners, 1 kids meal and 4 margaritas,  over $100 for mediocre food. We don't mind spending $$ when the food and service is great, but we would have been better off going to Del Taco. Not to mention, both my hubby and I had a mean case of the Hershey squirts the whole next day!! Oh well, at least the movie was good.",DBD3NB1ecSF5_OJNsXjK_w,1,0,1,615EOb580k63M3qMvxwkFQ

Girls night out is always at Cabo Mexican Restaurant in the Santa Fe.  We like to sit at the bar, have a drink or two, play some video poker and talk.  On Wednesday, we sat down and immediately noticed the music was extremely loud, like it is in the casinos on the Strip or Fremont St.  The manager was making the rounds and asked how we were.  I said, we'd be a lot better if we could hear ourselves talking....what was with the LOUD music.  She apologized and said it's a new policy from upper management.  They want the music to be heard into the casino area to help entice customers.  I then asked if it was possible to turn it down a little....it's a Wednesday night, ""SENIOR CITIZEN"" day and most of the customers are over 50, probably a little hard of hearing and really don't enjoy the music blasting over their conversations.  We were told ""management"" would not allow it and do walk by and signal if the music isn't loud enough in the casino (which, by the way, has it's own piped in music going out there).   I am hard of hearing and had a tough time hearing our bartender and a hard time hearing my friends.  The manager said it was exceptionally loud there because the speakers face down toward the bar area, not OUT toward the casino.  She said it was not as loud farther in the restaruant.

We asked to be seated at a table, as far back as we could get.  It was still extremely loud and not a fun, relaxing dinner since we had to talk to loud to be heard.

Santa Fe Station is a LOCALS casino, catering to an older crowd.  We are done with the loud music scene and when we are out for dinner, like to have a conversation without screaming.  Cabo may want to re-think this whole loud music concept....going to lose a lot of older customers, which on a Wednesday night are the majority of customers.  

As for the rest of the experience....GT is great behind the bar, servers were excellent, food was good.....music is what will make us find a new location to spend our time and money.",SIEXigX-Kzc9Er2GgKBJbg,2,0,3,HQ2yR_hHH9ZUcl2b2R7ugw
