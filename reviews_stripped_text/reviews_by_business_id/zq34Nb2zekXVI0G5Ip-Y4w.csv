40713,2010-09-27,1,zq34Nb2zekXVI0G5Ip-Y4w,"Went here on a whim after walking what felt like a million miles down the strip. I was in one of my very picky ""I want something different"" moods and Greek Island was the the most exotic dining option available. I was a little wary of food court Greek but I wasn't about to eat a burger or chicken nuggets so I ordered a Gyro and some fries. I wasn't expecting too much but the Gyro was pretty damn good! The meat was flavorful, the tzatziki sauce was great, the pita was warm and soft. Even the fries were good, My brother didn't want to try it but once I convinced him to take a bite he abandoned his Panda Express *SMH* and I had to go order another one. Next time I'm in Fashion Show I'm definitely hitting this place up.",J1XfWtKz0kd7w38Bx8czRg,2,1,4,NiEAdlHu3RO3Y1TEIhzhAw

It's not the Estiatorio Milos but it's the healthiest choice in the Fashion Show mall. We both had wonderful salads and then went back again last night for take-out. 

Everything else in the area is either fatty burgers and hot dogs or sugar laden Chinese food. Thank goodness for the Greeks!",6Q5JhEvQfIyeOnYzgVdFTw,0,0,4,3p06h57zctXmumlqzPwQHQ
1136838,2011-10-20,0,zq34Nb2zekXVI0G5Ip-Y4w,I was looking for a fast and healthy lunch during our recent visit to Fashion Show Mall.  Greek Island Caf√©s gyro plate was delicious!  The Greek salad was fresh and filling with the gyro perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Staff is very friendly and the quality of food is a bargain for the price!!  Definitely going back on my next trip to Vegas.,g0OHC2ZMmBZO4HJIPaM15w,0,0,5,Ocf9Bu5nqwGTL_G0X2mSNg
1161133,2012-03-14,0,zq34Nb2zekXVI0G5Ip-Y4w,"Myself and my husband visited this place yesterday. We are locals. His Mother is Greek so we appreciate Greek food- we didn't expect extraordinary Greek cuisine seeing as we were at a fast-food food court but we didn't expect the terrible food we got. I was really disappointed by my option which was Falafel on Pita with Hummus. The Falafel can best be described as like golf balls- could not be cut through with the plastic knife or even my teeth for that matter. That means to me that they were poorly/over-cooked or just days old. The Hummus was no better, I could not stand the taste of it (tasted old also) even the pita bread was unfresh. I had to throw it in the trash.
The Tzatziki on my husband's gyro was tastless but the meat and salad was ok he said.
It kind of spoiled our day of shopping!",jHNFoLPUjYCN45Shx8My0A,0,0,1,ekyMo_JBSUeEjK_-s1S9GQ

Taste- good
Value for money- average, it's priced at las Vegas standards I guess!
Quantity - good, portions not really share-able unless you ain't too hungry

Stuff I tried and liked: falafel wrap, Greek fries, Shwrm. chicken pita wrap. I have not  tried but a friend tells me the gyros were good, too. 

Disliked: spinach pie!! Too bitter compared to how it usually is, not crispy, served with plain rice and $11 a plate- Avoid!",qCY467Gp1D1Yrn_N9BpT_Q,0,0,3,FurzEsW4n_Scu-KXhtTvfg

Quick service, a bit high on the prices imo, but this is Vegas.

I would definitely come back.",zYwpJGFLFwncmSc8U8TFrQ,0,0,4,8bdVdTJK4FvUNeMMZpYpCw

This was a taste of the Med, in Las Vegas. Makes a change from the chain places.
Great Gyros(kebab), best chips(fries) out side of Skiathos!
Don't be scared because it isn't so glitzy with a multi-million dollar marketing department behind it making the signs and fittings. The man who served me even spoke Greek!

Tasty food; give it a try. Reading the other reviews i wished I had tried the soup; next time.

This is good food; take a chance and you won't be disappointed or numbed by the mediocrity of yet another chain(oh, and take cash because they don't take cards which is a pain)",ZG038I9dvOk-lJ4OkZ9fDQ,1,1,4,LzQLXmKv3OiIntvwguu2Rw
2634353,2011-07-25,0,zq34Nb2zekXVI0G5Ip-Y4w,"We were in the Fashion Show Mall replacing my Wife's lost glasses. We were hungry and had an hour to kill so off to the food court we go. We decided to eat someplace we can't get back home. As we don't have any Greek restaurants outside of gyro places back home, we thought we would try this place out and we were not disappointed. 

I love trying new things, and we were not familiar with most of the items on their menu. The man at the counter was very nice and patiently answered our questions as to what were the different items on the menu. He went into detail describing them. I ended up ordering the Dolmathes(sp?) which was meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves. It was very delicious. It tasted fantastic! I ended up sharing half of them with my wife. She ordered a dish that I can't remember the name of it, but it was like a potato lasagna dish. It was okay; kind of bland... we definitely liked the Dolmathes better. There is a good portion of rice pilaf and a Greek salad that came with each.  

Overall it was a good experience and the food was delicious, especially for mall food. I'm hoping to find a place that serves Greek food back home just so I can get some more of the Dolmathes.",QIx1kegezE8MHc1TsCBLCw,0,0,4,QxzI7R-383JSApxrRp2eXw
3286385,2010-08-02,2,zq34Nb2zekXVI0G5Ip-Y4w,"I'd be remiss if I let my trip to Vegas end without a shout-out to this stand in the Fashion Mall Food Court.

I stopped by my last afternoon in town, looking for a quick bite that wasn't going to cost me the earth.  I ordered their gyro, which was sliced off the spit and grilled - not those horrible pre-made slices.  The sandwich was perfectly fine, with a decent tzatziki sauce, onions and tomatoes, and a nicely griddled pita.  My platter came with a passable Greek salad and some boring rice.  For a mall food court, this would have been enough to please.

However, when I mentioned how glad I was to see a family food stand selling real Greek food in a mall food court, the woman behind the register smiled, and offered me a container of lemon-egg soup (avgolemono), gratis.  Boy, am I glad I took her up on it.

Best.  Avgolemono.  Ever.

I'll admit that my opinion might be colored by surprise.  I never would have expected such a flavorful, delicious soup to come out of a mall.  I snarfed every last bit, and nearly scraped through the styrofoam bowl, getting every drop.

Believe it or not, that soup was the food highlight of my stay in Vegas.  I spent easily  ten times more for meals at some of the five-star restaurants in town, and this one meal put them all to shame.",Bq5WrIy-AHk-Bc6wOPBDVQ,2,2,4,KEFF4lXl9pNUnl6hEKohzQ

We had just flown in and arrived to Vegas and I didn't feel like eating greasy junk so I found this place. 

The plate came with one chicken kabob, rice, salad, and of course your pita. 

Aside from the price the food was pretty decent. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Pita was a little hard and the salad had one too many pieces of chunky cheese.

TIP-Get your drink next door at the chicken place, it's a dollar cheaper for the same size!",vN-wJa9ZS5Rjt9uhtXOtEg,2,1,3,MecQnduLzCoOkRKnHXTAlg

(ok, this is a little embarrassing) The Gyro's are the best we have ever had.  Their food is authentic, the tzasiki is very good, The owner (Resa) is very nice, The prices are a little high by comparison (other mall food) but far better quality. The Avgolemono soup (lemon chicken) is to DIE FOR!

For all you veggies out there - the falafel wrap is fresh, filling and delicious. The falafel is only lightly fried and the pita is not heavy either - so don't expect a food coma per se.  Side of tzatziki sauce is included (75 cents for extra sauce).  They also offer a veggie wrap with eggplant and zucchini.  Try the Greek style fries with your wrap (fries + feta + Greek spices).  A combo meal with drink and fries upgrade was about $13.  Not too shabby considering it's still Vegas.",xfrRKuHXbvz7J_dShdsTHw,1,0,4,sKVxOcJdKkXAMnLwvzkPLw

4858971,2012-11-10,0,zq34Nb2zekXVI0G5Ip-Y4w,I stayed at the Encore a month ago and ate here twice and back again today shopping at the mall and had to get the Gyro!  It's a tasty lunch for $7 and with a soda about $10.  There is usually a nice lady working here or a gentleman who look Greek so they are probably the owners. Today he offered me a sample of the chicken & rice lemon soup and after you get over the zesty lemon taste it is quite delicious and helped my cold esp on a chilly day.  Will definitely be coming back on my return trips to Vegas.  It's nice to have an affordable meal outside of the hotels where you can easily spend $20-$40 on lunch.,3UW_-mt_Ed0v4y3bMMQcoA,1,0,4,gOIkfP-AURLI2rDrO7vMcw

Mall food courts usually suck for vegetarians; so in my head, I could only think about all the disastrous food I would have to suffer with at the Fashion Mall considering that I've been to that food court quite a few times already.  But upon entering the third floor, I see the word GREEK, and I knew right then and there that there would be falafels to my rescue. Now that's love.

Anyway, my falafel wrap cost me somewhere between $5 and $6 dollars. I can't really remember.  All i know is that the wrap was delicious and filling.
