We finally had the opportunity to have a late Saturday lunch together, courtesy of this Taiwanese deli. Initially, we were going off of her dim sum craving, but decided to try something different. *cue my devious plan to suggest one of my many Yelp bookmarks*

After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we decided on the pork chop rice and the three cup chicken rice. Didn't take very long to get our food and man, their portions are HUGE. One of our entrees could've fed two or three people, so you should either come famished or bring a friend! We ended up splitting the crispy fried pork chop and taking the other entree home. Both dishes had their respective meats, some steamed or blanched vegetables, a large helping of rice, and a soy sauce egg. Mmm, did that meal hit the spot or what?

Service was courteous and friendly, but you may have to get your own napkins and water. If you're afraid of language barriers, it turns out some of them speak English, so no fear! My mom and I speak a lesser known dialect, but we managed with the Mandarin we knew. Also, you're probably better off bringing cash to pay the bill, but most Asian establishments are like that.

However, this time when I went there was HORRIBLE! The first second I walked into the restaurant, there was another Taiwanese elderly lady standing behind the cashier. She was staring at me without any welcoming smile when I was walking to her. When I was standing right in front of her, she didn't greet with me and kinda waiting for me to greet with her. And she gave me a really irritating face! Then she lift up her chin a little bit and blinked in the most annoying way I've ever seen. Ok, I ignored that. Then I told her what I wanted to order for to-go. Then, there's another young male customer came to the cashier and asked for a check. She gave him a very bright smile and called him ""handsome boy"" in Chinese and finished his transaction before me. Really! The guy came after me!!!!! 
Ok, I ignored that too. When she handled me my food, she said ""shiiiit!"" In English. She said it really loud. I didn't really know if she was saying that to me or for something else, but it's still rude to curse in front of a customer.
She is definitely the rudest and the most miserable person I've ever met in my entire life. I didn't do anything or showed any disrespect to her from the very beginning to the end. I even said ""thank you"" after all of this.
Btw, last time me and my bf were there for breakfast, they undercooked the wonton. And it smelled wired.

First off was Duck Tongue, which was the best dish we had.  Had that 5 spice taste but was very mild, which I liked.  It was served cold , tender meat but watch out for the cartilage.  Next was the Stinky Fried Tofu.   It was OK and it does smell like an old sock.  Next ""Spicy"" Beef Noodle, I put the quotes because it was not spicy at all.  Noodles had a nice chew to it, nice beefy flavor from the soup,  big chunks of beef and tendon.  Overall it was a nice dish but wanted it SPICY.  Lastly we had the Shiao Long Bao.  First time eating it so have no reference point.  It's OK, wish the dipping sauce had a little more vinegar to it.

I ordered beef noodle soup WITHOUT  green onion (I cannot eat it), of course it came with green onion. After scooped out most of it, found the beef was tough and the broth was salty. Ate less than half of my bowl, my first time of not finishing my food here.

The noodles are cooked just right, beef could be a bit softer, but there's very little fat in it, and the broth is hot and spicy. There's only a few places I go in town to get my beef noodle fix, and this is on the top of my list. If you don't speak Mandarin or look Chinese, I find that they tend to make the soup less spicy because they don't think you can handle it, so ask the waitress to make the soup super spicy.

They have a wide variety of Taiwanese dishes, ranging from breakfast to lunch items. I haven't tried their breakfast, so I can't comment on it. But they do have the typical Taiwanese appetizers and dishes, such as pig's ear, oyster pancake, and pork chop rice. The only dish I'm not a fan of is the noodles with the spicy peanut sauce, only because it tastes like peanut butter and chili garlic sauce mixed together. 

Service is on the lackluster side, they like to assume that if you look Chinese, you must be able to speak Mandarin and nothing else (like Cantonese). If you want water, you have to go to the water dispenser to get some. There's usually only one waitress working, so if you don't want to wait to pay for your bill, it's better to just go up to the register and do it. Also, there's a minimum $10 order if you're using a debit or credit card.

The most authentic Taiwanese food I have had since visiting Taiwan! 

Breakfast and lunch specialties that can't be found anywhere else in Vegas! 

My mother-in-law is from Taiwan and this is her favorite restaurant when she comes into town. 

The spicy beef noodle soup is a must have when you come here! The portions are large so I usually share with my wife. Everything is made fresh to order, and they have a huge selections of dishes. 

Some of our other favorites include:
spicy wanton soup
fried onion pancake
turnip cake with a fried egg on top (Luo Buo Gao)
Pork and mushroom steamed buns
Curry meat pies
Sun cakes
Soy bean milk (made fresh daily)
rice roll (fan tuan)
twisted cruller (you tiao)
Baked wheat cake (shao bing)
Fried pot stickers
And several more that I can't remember right now

i've been to the one in California and hoped that it was the same quality and it was to my surprise!

i ordered:
hot soy milk (very good made from scratch, add ur own sugar)
chinese donut (wasn't stale)
rice burrito (good amount of filling)
egg pancake ( big portion but too oily)

all it was surprisingly good, because vegas isn't known for good asian cuisine. next time i'm going to get the special

for 3.99
soymilk, chinese donut and a baked beef/pork sanwich

where else can you get a wholesome breakfast for that price! 

the service was typical asian style, no particular waitress, just grab whoever has a apron on for attention :) 

BTW BREAKFAST ENDS AT 11:30AM!

they serve lunch and dinner also, from what i saw it was very traditional taiwan food ei:dumplings,beef noodle soup,etc.",FQ_Dx7S0awXzlMRUL-WgZw,3,0,4,8of0xbny6YA1r75_v-lGEA

The owner of this restaurant is the same one from Champion on Spring Mountain Rd.  It's in the same mall of the old SF supermarket.  

Please don't let the their service discourage you from visiting this place again.  This is how their service works.  When you get there, they don't really seat you, you just find a spot to sit, get your own water from the dispenser and grab your own utensils for food.  You can either go up to the counter to get their menu or you can wait for them.  Either way.  Their service isn't the best but that's how they roll.

I'm only giving this place 2 stars because I've read the review from someone else about this place and he said that they didn't have some of the items on the menu.  So I decided to wait a few days afterwards to go.  But, the items that were unavailable from the previous review, was still UNAVAILABLE.  This makes me wonder, if they even have the man power to run a business like this.  Why did they advertise Taiwanses deli when they don't have soy drinks? Why they don't have shao lung bao? Waitress said to me that since they are so busy, the chef is unable to make the shao lung bao.  (Oh really?  Do you want the business from me? Seriuosly?  No? I guess not!)  

It just doesn't make sense to me why they don't hire more people to help outside and inside of the kitchen?  Why don't they better prepare themselves? They've been in business for a while week already and not to mention, they only moved over from their previous business, so they have experience already.  

I then suddenly remember how the sluggish atmosphere is like from the old champion restaurant.  It's the exact same thing.  They probably want to improve business but don't really know how to handle a busy business within their management.  

I want to review on their dam dam mein.  It used to taste really good at the old location, and i expected it to be the same. But it didnt' taste the same.  Not only did they not have the appropriate  that they were supposed to serve , the peanut sauce was really bland.    They didn't have soy that i wanted to drink, they didn't have the siu lung bao, that i wanted.  I ordered my normal favorite and it turned out horrible.  I also ordered the Beef noodle which didn't taste great either.  

Over all, i was really disappointed in their management.  I hope their services will improve in the future.  I will not be back there for a while.",J-WfsRmH4VPsycArml_G9Q,2,1,2,HecnwWFbZvzDvjwH9nHi6Q

I'm tossed between the Noodle Pot restaurant & this place for the spicy beef stew.  The flavorings are really different.  One feels like its has more flavor (Noodle pot) but I get so thirsty afterwards.  This Yi Mei feels like it can add a little bit more seasoning but the portion size & noodles are more than the Noodle pot.  Btw, Noodle Pot only takes CASH but Yi Mei accepts credit cards.

oyster pancake - bleh bleh bleh.  the sauce was was REALLY cinnamon-y, and not thick enough.  It really didn't taste like oh ah jian (forgive me, I don't know ping ying) at all.  Plus, it was 7 whopping bucks.

dan bing (egg pancake) - really eggy, but the bing wasn't crispy enough.  it's hard to mess up dan bing though.

salty soy milk (shian do jiang) - VERY tasty.  It's a small-ish bowl, but for 3 bucks, it's not bad.  Lots of vinegar and pork sung.  Would definitely order again.

pork chop rice - The pork chop was okay (but I'm not a huge fan of pork chop), but the seasoned pork and vegetable on the side (the zho zhau) was REALLY good. 

stewed pig ear and bean curd - this tasted pretty much like you would expect.  Decent flavor, though the bean curd was a bit on the salty side.

They have tons of other breakfast items that we didn't get a chance to try, but will update once we come back.  I would have given this place 4 stars if not for that horrid oyster pancake.

1813130,2011-02-28,0,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"My wife and I are foodies and having relocated from HK to here we are in constant search of all of our ""favorites"" from asia.  Being that we would take food vacations to taipei we walked into Yi Mei with some trepidation.

Now before I continue on, I do want to mention that HK is not actually a great place for taiwanese food (or else we wouldnt go on foodie trips to taipei).

We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup.  Had a little bit of heat but not sweating sort of spicy.  Which was great because it had a great taste that would've been covered up had it been too spicy.  Very nice!  It was also quite big, I am used to the little paper bowls of beef noodle soup in the alleyways of taiwan, not the american sized portions.  Couldnt finish it all and the waitress (the owners grand daughter) was great and brought me 2 containers 1 for the soup the other for the noodles so it wouldnt go all soggy together.  

My wife ordered the steamed pork rice.  I knew it was good as soon as she declared ""I'm not sharing!""  Of course she did and it was very good we were impressed. 

My wife had the cold soy milk and enjoyed it I ordered the hot and had to put sugar in it, home made and nice. everything was home made and it was like having a personal taiwanese grandma cooking for us.

Then onto the Xiao Lum Bao.  the filling was good the skin a little thick and not enough ""soup"" inside the dumpling.  These took awhile but they were by far the best I have had in the USA.  Din Tai Fun sets a very high bar,we have gone to the DTF in taipei, shenzen, hong kong, singapore and jakarta (no pork at DTF in jakarta no pork dumplings suck).

Great food, nice family atmosphere place.  We will be going back anytime we plan on going to the 168 market for shopping.",72_tM3lDtMVwiGQdsMgQIg,1,1,4,_GPYlHFwPSIz1VKmZ-SjYQ

Well open your mind to a slightly different experience: tawainese breakfast! It's slightly different than dim sum but not so different that you'll be confused. There's XLB, there's bao, there's chinese doughnuts, there's all kinds of spicy nom noms, there's something for everyone! Seriously!

We came here on a Sunday morning, hungry. We left the opposite of hungry. The service was friendly if a little slow to get started. We liked the ample parking and the fact that a Chinese tour group showed up right after we did (they ate their breakfast like champions - truly impressive intake) and that we were the only native English speakers there.  Most importantly we liked the food and appreciated the good advice we got from our server. And the bill was reasonable too. :)

1971280,2015-10-14,1,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli is my favorite savory dining experience that I had this past weekend. Well, maybe it tied with Trattoria Nakamura Ya...Anyway, this unassuming spot deserves more than its 3.5 star average.

If you're craving a big breakfast, then Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli provides the perfect alternative to eggs, bacon, and pancakes. And it also offers an attractive and arguably superior alternative to dim sum (while I enjoy dim sum, most dim sum restaurants are guilty of making their small plates way too salty, maybe on purpose...).

Just like mentioned in the name, Yi Mei Champion is a Taiwanese deli that provides homey, comforting, perfectly cooked dishes. Honestly, this was the Taiwanese dining experience that I so wanted when I visited in Taipei but didn't get. Casual restaurants are fine by me, actually preferred, but many restaurants that I encountered in the different districts of Taipei seemed to have really questionable sanitation practices, making me nervous to try much. I feel like such a wimp, but that's the truth. Yi Mei is a simple restaurant, but it seemed pretty clean. All our silverware and plates were spotless.

But more importantly, Yi Mei Champion's food is so good. The oyster omelet was on point. It wasn't overly sauced and had lots of oysters. The Chinese donuts for dipping in soups and salty soy bean milk was wonderful--crispy on the outside and hollow on the inside. We tried a few items we'd never had before, like their egg and radish cake. Superlative menu item. It's so delicious, something you must order. We also had something similar to a pork bun or bao, except it was filled with veggies, very flavorful. Their salty soy bean milk is really tasty, too, but it comes with pork floss. Good to know if you don't eat meat. Hubby also sampled pork sticky rice wrapped in a banana leaf, which was another win. Lastly, try their refreshing iced tea from the fridge.

I really love this place. I thought service was polite and prompt, though not chatty. Service was definitely not bad, contrary to what has been described in other reviews. I would highly recommend Yi Mei for an early morning bite, whether a substantial meal or something more akin to a snack. Everything we tried was delicious.",UhzrTq9-Sggy1SHkSY4Unw,2,2,5,he8LqDw2wEGFVv6G5ZSUVw

The pork chop rice was HUGE! Came with minced pork also, veggies and was big enough for two to share. The beef roll was also good, came with pickled cucumbers and fermented cabbage that was similar to kim-chi. 

I didn't really care for the oyster omelet with the sauce on top, their soup dumpling was decent, juicy but the lacked in flavor a little.

We dropped by for lunch on an early Saturday afternoon. It got a little busy right after we arrived which might've contributed to the strange time we experienced there.

We ordered a few dishes to start with. We wanted some other things as well, but no one came back to take our additional orders.

Our dishes were delivered by a male server who would drop the dish off, mention what it is and then immediately run off. Wrong dishes were delivered to our table a couple of times.

Their menu is very difficult to follow if you don't already know what you want. The pictures on Yelp are very useful for figuring out what some of the dishes are.

Packed house and yet very efficient.  One tradition about Chinese dinning is that you need to be able to stand other guests staring at you and giving you a very clear hint of hurry up that we want to sit down look.  Don't be offended, that's part of the culture.  You gotta not be shy and be flexible in the seating, that could range from share table to servers bussing your table so quickly that you get that you can't hang out and take your time.  In our case, we are two people so the best chance to grab a quick bite is to let them know we are willing to share table.  Both days we waited for less than 5 minutes.

2639415,2010-10-18,4,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"We ( My date and I ) checked out this newly opened Taiwanese Deli place that's next to Lelysee Bakery and near 168 Market.

Reminds me of Tea Planet without the booth seats and colorful interior. They have some snacks and health products for sale that you can browse through if you like..

They have a self serve utensils and water dispenser if you need an extra bowl or cup to share food or just to drink plain water.

We ordered the Chrysanthemum Tea, which was delightfully refreshing to taste. I could drink 10 of these if there were refills.. but that's just wishful thinking. This is my all time summer drink to cool my body when I feel like I'm about to experience heat exhaustion... it works instantly and you literally feel relieved.. even to say... Aaaaaaaaaaah!!

For dinner, we ordered two most popular Taiwanese dishes:

Spicy Beef Noodle (Soup) - Surprised it wasn't overpowering with the spices that I thought it would have. It was actually just right in giving it a kick each time you took a sip. I actually really enjoyed this broth. I loved the noodles! It had a great texture as if it was homemade. Thicker than fettuccine noodles, but thinner width-wise. It was like udon noodles texture, but half its size... absolutely enjoyed every bite. The beef was like stew meat that is cooked for many hours... unfortunately I had to minus a star for the fact that some of the chunks of meat ( the ends/corners of it ) were quite tough to chew upon. And for that reason, I couldn't even eat the remainder of the beef chunks, but I did finish all the noodles, sliced green cabbage, and some kind of pickled shredded mustard green.

Rice with Pork Chop - It also came with a boiled egg, steam greens, and ground pork. The coating is somewhat similar to katsu style, but this batter they dip the pork chop into and deep fry is on point! It had a light, airy crispy crunch on the outside.. which was my favorite!!! * My eyes lit up like Christmas lights in full blast from biting into a piece. Very tasty and satisfied all my taste buds. Even the meat was tender and juicy.  Bravo!! Bravooooo!!! I definitely recommend this dish if you love meat and deep fried food. It really hits the spot indefinitely :)

They also open at 7a.m.- 11:30a.m. for breakfast, which I heard was incredibly cheap, but good. Service was quick, but not much smiles... At least my tummy was smiling and it put me in a great mood.

Even when we wanted to pay, she yelled at us to go to the cashier for payment instead of bringing the bill to us.

2837567,2013-02-09,1,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).  

Soybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.

Rice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.

Temple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.

Spicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.

Leek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.

Items that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. 

Not sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,7,6,4,WeKDjgCz1BTduMNdFIHFOA

From the reviews that I read, the service sounded like it was terrible and even worse for people who can't speak Taiwanese. That wasn't the case for me because as I came in with my husband and 2 kids we seated ourselves and within a few minutes we had someone come to take our order. I don't speak Taiwanese so I ordered everything in English and the girl who took my order understood everything. Maybe I got lucky that day! 

Within 5-10 minutes our food started coming out and everything was out within 10 minutes. I was pretty happy about that! We ordered a variety of things because I wanted to try out my favorite dishes: green onion pancake, oyster omelette, juicy pork dumplings, and beef noodle soup. I also ordered the hot soybean milk... Which was so fresh and delicious! Made me feel like a kid again! 

Here's a breakdown of the food: 1) green onion pancake- too thick for my liking. I like the thinner and crispier ones. The flavor was good but it was a little too doughy for me. 2) oyster omelette- the omelet itself was great! But the sauce they put on top was too sweet. 3) juicy pork dumplings- amazing. Perfect. The ginger soy dipping sauce complemented the dumplings perfectly. I will come back for more! 4) spicy beef noodle soup- it was good and not too spicy.

This place is pretty far from the main Chinatown Plaza but if you keep driving down Spring Mountain, you will see a 168 Market and there you will find this Yi Mei. The menu is pretty huge with the selection of taiwanese breakfast items ranging from soy milk to radish cakes. The place is popping in the mornings but can be dead at times as well. I'm happy I found the place though because the meal was super super cheap (in comparison to other Vegas food) and it was delicious. We got the soy milk (unsweetened), rice roll, chinese donut, and chicken roll. The soy milk was good.  According to my parents, it was even better than the ones we get in LA. I liked the rice roll the best because i love sticky rice. It was a great combination of sweet from the rice and savory from the chinese donut and the pork sung. The chinese roll is almost like a sausage. It is pretty oily but it is cut up into pieces so you don't have to eat all of it at once but you probably will. I eat it with the chinese donut almost like a mini hot dog (just remember to try to squeeze out some of the oil from the chinese donut. The service is quick and efficient. The lady that works there seems to know everyone or at least makes it seem like she's your bed bud. There are a ton of other things on the menu. It is kind of like a hole in the wall so remember to clean the table before you start munching. It's quick and simple but satisfying and I have to admit, it's a good break from all of the buffets and benedicts on the strip.

FYI, they also sell vacuum packed items from Champion company which is known for their pork sung and other marinated items.",Vi_qBZBXgkNbsO1qXXkoVw,9,7,4,AWuI0Gq43_bZQU7ROiZbhQ

I've seen some people review that the service isn't great or that the owner is snappy, but for us she was very accommodating with us (with that somewhat curt attitude lol). So at least to me, if you look past that, service is great. 

Food is pretty good, not too salty. Only the quantity is somewhat smaller than I hoped. The radish pancake only came with two pieces, and the beef roll was only three pieces, although it came with pickled cucumber and cabbage. 

I'll keep this place in mind, I'd come back to check out the lunch menu. 

One thing that I did appreciate about this place is the reason it has it's hours so short. Sure, it's short and only in the morning (they close at 3PM). The reason is because the owner can then go home and spend time with her dad and cook for him too. She does accommodate people who may want to come in later. She had a party call in maybe a couple days before saying they wanted to bring people there but it would be after closing time, maybe around 4PM.

The inside is very simple and casual and has several tables. Service is mediocre, and I didn't expect much, but usually Taiwanese people are more friendly (granted, some of the waitresses were mainland Chinese). 

The menu is extensive and prices are very reasonable, so that's a plus. I ordered the salty rice ball, salty soymilk, and pickled cucumber appetizer (please see my photo captions for the exact dish names as they are listed in the menu). The fried dough stick (??) inside the salty rice ball was not crispy at all, which was a bit disappointing. Salty soymilk was decent, but I've had much better (and there was no white vinegar on the table or served with it if you wanted to add some). The pickled cucumbers were great though!

It was after 11:30am by the time we got a table (it was packed in there), but luckily they still took our order for the breakfast special. It consisted of hot soya bean milk, Chinese donut, and a pastry bun. This typical Taiwanese breakfast combo was not bad for $3.99. The soya bean was very strong flavor and made fresh at the restaurant. The Chinese deep fried donut was not quite up to par, not chewy and holey enough, but okay. The pastry bun was flaky, although for my taste buds, I would prefer it to be filled with some sort of meat. We also ordered xiu long bao, salty rice roll and a beef sandwich. The xiu long bao was quite tasty, but a little on the small size. The salty rice roll which consists of glutinous rice wrapped around a Chinese donut with dried pork jerky was not bad. It tastes quite good, but the Chinese donut inside was overcooked and a little too hard for my liking. Lastly, the beef sandwich had slices of marinated beef in the pastry bun. It didn't come with any sauce, so to me the sandwich was on the dry side. The flavor of the beef could also be improved. So overall, I think this place is only deserving of 2.5 stars.

Sweet soy bean milk: 1.60-4*
Baked sandwich: 1.65-very plain. Don't order it by itself

3559904,2011-05-22,1,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"I woke up this Sunday morning with a craving for fried donut and wonton soup.  My mom and I went to Wendy's noodle cafe and realized they only open for lunch.  So we decided to try this place since I've read some reviews and heard about this place from a few friends.  

I cannot understand how people are giving this place 4 or 5 stars. 

Where do I begin...first the service was horrible.  Right after we came in I realized this is one of those places where you seat yourself.  I don't have a problem with that so we picked a table.   After 10 minutes wait we still hadn't seen any service in the entire dining area so I went to the counter while thinking maybe this is a place where you order at the counter and serve yourself.  The lady at the counter told me she'll come right out to take our order.  Another 5 minutes later a different waitress came out and started taking order from a group of people who came in after us.  So I had to go to the counter again and the waitress who told me she'd be right out was just hanging there doing nothing.  

Very much like the service the food was also a disappointment.  I wanted something soupy but they didn't have any soup (including the beef noodle soup) available for breakfast.  So I ordered fried donut, beef pancake and soy milk.  The fried dough (or donut) was probably the worst I've had.  Part of it was overly crunchy and the rest was like chewing on paper.  

The beef pancake came out in saran wrap which made it look not freshly made.  It's not horrible but I've definitely had better ones (like the one in China Ma Ma).  The taste was bland and I had to use a lot of hot sauce.  The flaky outside was so crispy that it just fell all over on the table when I tried to unwrap it.  What a mess.  

I expected soy milk but I think she brought me the soy tofu thing.  Anyway the dish already had fried donuts in there.  Any decent waitress would warn the customers that they may not need the additional order of fried donut but apparently not here.  The dish was below average from presentation to taste.  

Overall I don't think there's anything about this place that will make me go back.  They may have better things for lunch or dinner but I don't really care about finding that out.",-p2ISrtcOFS87T2pkyIaNw,4,0,1,BRj-1w8wMeG_EjPX1whLqA

I did both breakfast and lunch items together - started off with a fan tuan (rice roll? I don't know the direct english translation) and moved on to my pai gu fan (pork + rice), which was huge. We also tried the Oyster Pancake, average... could of been better, and the green onion pancake (cong you bing), just okay. The beef noodle soups were pretty oily, so avoid those if your stomach can't handle grease.

Super nice owner, actually from the bay area, and because we bought a bunch of snacks and soymilk to bring on the trip, she gave us extra things for free like a box of pineapple cakes, some sort of coffee drinks, etc. We came back a few days later and she still remembered us. Good service!

3684540,2018-03-31,0,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"So much has changed since I moved away from Vegas 2.5 years ago.  I went to Yi Mei's old location and was disappointed that they had closed, but then realized after checking Yelp that they had moved.  The new location is easily 3-4x the size of their prior location.  The food is still as solid and as authentically Taiwanese as ever.

We came for breakfast and started off with hot soy milk.  Remember, if you ask for sweet soy milk, it comes hot by default and is actually unsweetened since they expect you to sweeten it to your taste.  This is done at every Taiwanese breakfast place because sweetened soy milk being kept warm would start to burn.  The soy milk had a nice taste to it and the perfect accompaniment for what was to come.

Next came the egg pancake.  It was as good as my mom and relatives used to make.  The egg was perhaps just a tad bit oversalted, but it tasted great overall.  The tortilla component was nice and soft and chewy.  I also had a sweet rice roll, which was exactly what I expected.  They got the ratio of peanuts to cruller correct so it tasted great.

Finally, we got the ""Chinese sandwich"" and ""Chinese donut"".  Traditionally, you put the donut part inside the sandwich and then dip it into hot soy milk.  I was really impressed by the sandwich component.  It was really flaky and the sesame seeds on top added a nice flavor.

Overall, solid place for Taiwanese breakfast.  My Taiwanese parents approved.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,0,1,4,IqEVvweXVNJF0Itzrqe16g

My second visit was a desperate one. I originally stopped by Asian BBQ and noodles but they're closed on Fridays :( So...I decided to drive across the street. 

I ordered the beef noodle soup and asked if they could add wontons in it...weird I know but I was craving both. First they brought out a bowl of wontons in beef broth which is understandable and forgivable because of the language barrier. They took it back...added the beef and the noodles...everything looked great until I started eating. The wontons were falling apart as soon as I tried picking them up with my chopsticks. I was starving so I ignored this and continued eating until I bit into one of the wontons and realized that it was still pink...undercooked. Gross...-_-

They have a water cooler and Styrofoam cups if you need water... Feel free to walk up and get it yourself. Same goes for napkins.

Came in for a quick bite before my flight.  I got there around 8 am and the place was relatively empty.  I knew I had lucked out since that would not last.  The waitress handed me a menu and told me there would be no noodles until later in the day.  Good, since that means they are making it fresh, bad since I was craving some noodles.  Oh well.

I ordered the sweet soy milk (x2), steamed soup dumplings, onion pancake with egg, and a beef roll.  Everything came out rather quickly, that was good since I was on a time crunch.  The sweet soy milk was actually unsweetened and warm.  There was sugar on the table so I was able to sweeten it to my liking.  There was also a thin film on top, according to my mom, it is similar to tofu, very authentic, and the best part.  The steamed soup dumplings were good, the skins were a little thick this morning and they could have served it with more ginger.  The beef roll had lots of oninons and hoisin sauce and the pancake it came warpped in wasn't too thick.  The most lacking dish was the onion pancake.

It was very bland, I think the egg made it more so, to the point I sprinkled salt on it.  There weren't a lot of onions in it and instead of being crispy on the outside, it was soft throughout.

Service was efficient, and no one seemed grouchy for having to work on Christmas day.  And the staff spoke my dialect of Chinese, without any heavy accent, just like being in Taipei.  The entire bill for all my food was less than $20, a definite bargain.  Overall, a great place to eat and be reminded of home.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,1,2,4,YaHSV1bZ11w1fjBnorEJGg

For $6.99 you get a hearty bowl of noodle soup with a kick.  Modest plumped egg noodles perched high above the broth like a volcano with diced mustard leaf and sliced baby bok choy acting the role as lava.  Only, those greens aren't just for textures.  Scallions and cilantro are thrown into the fire as well. The soup itself has a really nice tang in there for a spicy broth not to mentions there's plenty of tender loving' beef chunks swimming around in your oasis.
Perfect therapy food for the unwell.  Make sure you grab yourself a Chrysanthemum Tea while you wait for your remedy.  

I tried their XLB  (Shanghai Dumplings) and didn't really enjoy them as much i wanted to.  They were mini size dumplings, so there wasn't much juice in them.  And because of their size you'd know they're made in-house.  The soy dipping sauce that came with it was mild in sweet with shredded ginger slice.  I add vinegar, chili paste, and soy for personal preference which prob made it worse.  15min wait for these.  

Green Scallion Pancakes were also tested since my Taiwanese food's archives is limit close to nothing.   They were a bit bland since it was thick and way doughier than what I'm use to.  Sadly, I couldn't take more than a few bite of this. 

Sorry, no pics. I've been here three times this week and each time I castled myself away from everything that's bind to me with that first sip.  Luckily for me an order of the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup is not super, ginormous since i magically tend to slip off layers of clothing during my treatment.  So might i suggest taking off your jacket before digging in?

If you're confused about which store it is, it's the store 2-3 doors down from 168 Market with only Chinese characters surrounding ""Taiwan Deli.""  Upon entering you can order either at counter or grab a seat and wait for service.

4092765,2011-05-17,0,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"Owner/chef Borman Yung is a charming, incandescent, talented cook and businesswoman.  I met her a few weeks ago when I popped my head in to see what Yi Mei was all about...she immediately began to ply me with deliciousness (but truth be told, I'd just had a huge lunch at China Mama) so I promised her I'd return.  So when I was invited to lunch today by two of my favorite students and adventurous eaters, I knew they'd love exploring Yi Mei with me...and we had a blast.

First, I reviewed what previous reviewers have said on yelp - cross referencing it with the menu she gave me and John Curtas' thoughts...then I dug in and made a list of the dishes that I knew we should try on our first pass -- and it was an amazing first visit...

Spicy Beef Noodle soup was terrific...well balanced delicious - not that spicy...but really good... and the noodles...oy.

Scallion Pancake...textbook

Beef roll...honestly this was my least favorite - but the pickled cucumber and and the kimchee with it were so good, I didn't care.

Sticky Rice Roll with shredded pork...think sweet, fuzzy, crispy, umami chewiness...awesome.  totally the first time I've ever had anything like this before and I loved it.  

Sesame Sauced Wide Noodles that were divine...rich, garlicky, warm, with scallions.  again - the noodles were perfectly cooked - so wonderful.  

XLB that were perfectly sized...finally, I didn't feel like I was going to choke because I had too much in my mouth - these were heavenly. The broth inside wasn't scalding - but I've had them enough now to know how to eat them - with great respect...

Potstickers - no, not redundant, completely different in technique - and with the addition of leeks to the minced pork, these, too, were just perfect.

Two of us ordered chrysanthemum teas - another ordered winter melon juice which was like drinking raisin-honey water...completely surprising and delicious.

So, as table after table of Chinese left, giving us thumbs up, we realized we'd clearly ordered and eaten impressively...We just couldn't stop....

That's when we met Borman...I kept looking for the darling woman I'd met the first time - but she wasn't there... (because she was cooking...)  She came out to see how we liked everything - and I smiled... she said her 80 year old mother had taken the day off... so she was in the kitchen.  We raved to her - so with that she picked out her two favorite desserts and cups of freshly squeezed soy milk and presented them to us, on her.   I didn't think I could eat another bite - but naturally, we soldiered on through what I thought would be sickeningly sweet...I was wrong... everything was subtle, interesting, unlike anything I'd had before - although somewhat recognizable.  From the sun cookie with the chinese symbol on top. to the sweet fried bread, to creamy, but refreshingly wonderful...I was hooked.  She told us about her breakfast.  

We talked about her children - which is why she came to America - for their education...one's a doctor in Ohio, the other also a doctor with an MBA... She left behind a producing career in radio in Taiwan to support them here...and hasn't looked back... Single now, she's funny and contagiously happy, a wonderful story teller and completely passionate about doing things right.  

I never knew how soy milk was made - she gave us a detailed lesson - and probably would have given us a demo, had we asked...I'll have to remember to do that next time.  

As we left, she asked me how many folks I worked with, and sent me back to the office with three boxes of pineapple cakes for them - and plenty of menus - and an offer to do anything to help whenever I might need it... : ) 

She also mentioned proudly her Yelp event...and how much she adores Misti and her husband...how she met them, and raved about his musical talent and regaled us with stories of them and Kevin Costner... ask her!   

This is one of the reasons I've really grown to love Las Vegas - the possibility of finding special treasures like this - Yi Mei and Borman - one and the same - inextricably intertwined, families doing what they love - and loving us in the process...  Go, eat.

I really wanted to try Yi Mei because reminds me of food from my childhood.  I knew I couldn't order everything from menu.  I went with juicy pork buns.  One of my favorite of all time.  The juicy pork bun comes 8 per order and needed 15 minutes to cook.  I wasn't in a rush.
Yi Mei could have provide water or tea while I waited.  Waitress didn't bring me anything to drink and wasn't her fault since I didn't order a drink.

It was cold and pouring rain outside. Errant summer storm in Las Vegas. I scurried in from the parking lot and it was so nice to have an order of freshly made soy milk plopped down in front of me. Odd that it was served in a big soup bowl but it was piping hot and fragrant and i didn't hesitate to try it. I added some sugar to it as directed by the waitress and drank it like soup with my fat Chinese spoon. Wonder why they don't serve it in a cup or mug? Oh well if this is how they do it in Taiwan then this is how I'll do it here. 

Choices, choices, so many choices. I had the worst time trying to decide what to order. Everything sounded so promising and fun. Yelp photos helped me settle on the spicy beef noodle soup but I added a twist and ordered the one that had tendons in it and I am glad I did.

Forget bone marrow it's all about tendons! I love the melt in your mouth texture. I googled tendon nutritional value and found that tendons are high in protein, collagen and are 99% fat free.  Choo chooo put me on the Tendon Train. Delicious.

I also had the temple meatball which was really flavorful and had a fantastic texture. Highly recommend that dish. The only dish I wasn't very fond of was the rice ball roll thing(sorry don't know names) I asked for something to go that was easy to eat while driving and the waitress recommended it. It was also something I saw a photo of on yelp and people seemed to enjoy it but I found it unhealthy tasting. Everything I ate up to that point tasted clean and healthy but this had fried components that made me feel bad about myself afterwards.

Bummer. I still give the place 5 stars for everything else.  I can't help it if my palate seems adverse to fried food. Others seem to enjoy the fried stuff just fine.",9v83UksZrkThOiE584GRBQ,2,2,5,OEjEF5D2Kl-to0XUwXQFQQ

If I'm in China town, and the place is not pricey, I don't really even consider service unless it's so deplorable they are one step away from spitting at me and insulting my mother.

  So ya, I walked in, its not huge, but they did have about 8 tables. The decor is a hodgepodge of crystals, small decorations, items for sale signs etc.  The lady behind the desk didn't speak English, she scurried over to our side after my boyfriend tried to ask her a question, and then pointed at the menu.  She jestured that we point to what we want.  Then we held up the amount of fingers that matched how many of that item.  It's a bit of an issue if you have questions or dietary exceptions.  If you fall in that category flag down the taller man with a ponytail he does speak English.  Luckily I looked at pictures and I knew I wanted the spicy beef noodle soup.  My boyfriend settled on the smoked chicken with egg and rice.  I think it was number 30.

So the beef in my soup is crazy tender, the soup bursting with flavor with just enough kick.  The kind that hits the back of your throat, but nothing crazy.  If you ever had wontons in Chile oil at a Chinese/Taiwanese place that's basically the spice they add to the beef broth.  The noodles had a nice chew to them as well.  

I loved my boyfriends chicken! Like it stole my heart.  Also tender like the beef, just perfectly cooked, had this crazy good sauce that was so savory and satisfying with the Smoky chicken, and sopped up with the rice.  The only downside was the egg, it was way over cooked.  However everything else was so delicious I did not even care.

It may be a bit difficult to come here if you are not familiar with Taiwanese cuisine, as the menu is non-descriptive and there is a bit of a language barrier. I get by using Yelp photos to determine what I will be eating and blindly choosing an item. Yi Mei Champion seems popular for a typical Taiwanese breakfast. I've noticed that this is usually composed of their salted soy milk or salted bean curd, which is are light soy-saucey broths with tofu and some pork floss for saltiness. I add chili oil and it's nice, warm, and homey tasting. Order some extra oily Chinese fried donuts to dip into it! May not be super healthy, but it's super comforting. 
Other things my boyfriend and I have tried:
-Noodle dishes have been good.. can't give much advice on how to order these as we randomly chose them.
-Radish w/ eggs. More like a soft dough fried in eggs. I enjoy this. 
-Chili oil bean curd- very salty, buttery tofu with a hint of spice. Good to eat with rice or spread on something bland.
-Beef roll - pass. dry and pre-made. Nothing special.

I saw a lady near the front making large crepe-looking dishes with a gooey looking dough. Didn't get a chance to ask about it.. but I would totally appreciate if anyone knows and would like to enlighten me about it!

What's up with everyone giving this place 2-3 stars because the ""service was terrible"". My family and I went here twice in one day and did not experience anything remotely close to bad service, despite every table being taken. In fact, the owner of the place actually came over and had a 15 minute conversation about how the place got start, what types of dishes we should try and what other places we should check out in the area. 

I took my parents to Vegas for the first time. The only request that they had was to check out Chinatown (yes, my parents are lame). I looked up a breakfast place to eat and found Yi Mei. I was a fan of the other locations in Southern California, so I decided to take them there. We were greeted right away and wait about 2-3 minutes for them to clear off a table. Unlike the other locations that I've been to, they had a huge menu included lunch & dinner items. I want apologize in advance, since I have to translate the dishes from Chinese to English and completely making the food sound unappetizing. We ordered a variety of things...soy milk (sweet and salty), Taiwanese style donut, scallion pancake, beef sandwich, ""meat round"" (Taiwanese dish with meat filling wrapped by a translucent rice cake). I have to say, growing up with Taiwanese food and living in Taiwan for a year, this place is as authentic as it gets. The food is made fresh to order and they do it very well. With all the food we ordered, the total was still less than 30 dollars. 

If you want a nice break from the expensive casino food, this place is a great option. 

A little about my credentials:

I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,0,0,5,jPpkRfpGylJFwup-blzz4g

Yi-Mei deli shop does offer very traditional Taiwanese snacks/breakfast. I am only writing in regard of their breakfast. The service was terrible, we were asked by this waiter to sit in one of the tables while waiting for our take out, but when it became busier, the waitress came here and was very rude ""you guys are ordering take out right? This table is for dine in only. You can stand there for waiting."" Seriously? Never heard of that. Later on, when the order was ready, the lady was yelling in Chinese ""give me your ticket."" I responded that we never received any receipt. She then proceeded "" no way you don't have a receipt. I give every customer a receipt."" Yes, we were 100% positive we didn't not receive any receipt or any ticket per se.

It was very embarrassing, my foreign friend felt very uncomfortable and indeed it was very bad presentation for her. As a native Taiwanese, I felt very ashamed.

The food was average. The original Yi mei rice ball was delicious, it has Chinese donut and pork song in it. Very tasty and bring home feeling. Egg pancake was a-ok, very soggy and egg were burnt. Milk tea was very good, tasted like traditional Taiwanese breakfast tea, defiantly different than bubble tea from other places.

4974515,2010-12-17,6,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"We were fans of the Champion Gourmet on Spring Mountain and very sad when they closed down.  However, the Yangs (Bobby and Misti) were the first to tell us that they were reopening business in this shopping center and we anxiously awaited their grand opening.  

What we loved most was their hot pot option - something that currently is not offered.  (Word from Auntie Bo directly said she'll be starting the hot pot business again come the new year! Yay!)

We even missed out on the famous CMYE: Breakfast of Champions event, which got raving reviews and reinforced how fabulous the Taiwanese breakfast experience was there.  (We plan on hitting it up one of these days!)

One day the Husband came home and said he wanted some Spicy Beef Noodle Soup from Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. Apparently someone from work had been raving about it, and yelpers concurred!  So off we went to dinner!

This is what we tried:   

* Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) - This is THE thing to order at Yi Mei.  Look around and you'll see every table have a bowl of this.  Every review talks about it and I can see why.  The Husband liked it and found the beef to be tender.  I was personally enjoying the noodle part more.  It had a good texture, something that Suki L. talks extensively about it in her review.  It also came with bok chopy and pickles, be sure to ask for more of those preserved pickles because they add a nice contrast to the dish.  Bring me a bowl of the noodles, broth, bok choy, and pickles and I'm good to go! 

* Special Fry Tofu ($4.99) - This was a long shot because we weren't sure exactly what was going to make this a 'special' fried tofu.  While we waited for this dish to arrive, the Husband asked if they had the stinky tofu still.  I wasn't sure since there was another dish on the menu called ""Hot Spicy Special Tofu"" and thought that may be the dish!  When it did come, it looked like before with pickled cabbage and a dipping sauce.  When I bit into it, it was definitely the stinky tofu.  The texture was a bit dried out, but the crispiness of the tofu was refreshing.

* Green Onion Pancake ($2.99) - One pancake arrived and it was a bit thicker than what I'm used to getting. We needed to add some hot chili oil (and other condiments found on the table) to give it a little more of a kick.  I personally prefer thinner green onion pancakes.

* Steamed Bao ($4.99) - Also known as Shanghai dumplings or 
Xiao Lung Baos.  They were the last to arrive.  There were eight small dumplings that were a little gummy and could have used a bit more time in the steamer.  I prefer it that way so the hot soup within the dumpling can burn my tongue a bit.

This is a pretty casual restaurant where there is a self service station for hot tea, water, and utensils.  You'll find this on your immediate right when you walk in.  Take a seat and be sure they know you sat down so you'll get menus.  (Try to ignore the spelling errors on the menu.) And when you're ready to pay, head to the register and know what number table you sat on to help them out.

This place is steadily busy, and not just from new customers who happen to be shopping at the nearby 168 Market.  But rather, these are long-time customers from their old restaurant.  You can tell they have a strong following.

When the Husband was paying, he got a chance to meet and talk with Auntie Bo, who is just the friendliest lady.  That's when we heard that hot pot was returning come the new year and we were psyched!  You can't help but love the family-oriented atmosphere where regulars come to enjoy some quality homelike food.  She really makes an effort to know her customers!   

Not only is Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli a restaurant, but it's a mini market as well. You'll find dried goods and refrigerated items for sale.  Take a look around for some interesting and unique goods!

Update! 01.06.11 - I stopped by and asked Auntie Bo about the return of the hot pot. Looks like it's not going to happen anymore. =(  She said they just don't have the staff to do it.  Oh well.  But she did mention Dragon House as an option for hot pot which I can confirm!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,10,9,4,do1xc7n_b0svLqjxsxzcvQ

Service:  2 stars. They weren't rude or anything, except this one lady who was too busy to answer my question, but you have to go to the front to order and pay or you will wait forever for them to come to your table. Also don't expect them to be nice and patient. You better be ready to go with minimal questions.  

Food: 
Salted bean curd:  5 stars. Really interesting. It's salty tofu pudding with a savory broth and chinese donut. Will order it again and it was only 3 bucks

Yi mei rice roll:  4. Pretty decent. I think it needs more kimchee in it. basically it's a sticky rice roll with a fried chinese donut, kimchee and savory pork shreds. A staple breakfast item in Taiwan. 

Beef roll:  3 stars. I really liked the cucumbers and kimchee that came with it. 5 stars for the side dishes. But the beef roll itself wasn't that good. The green onion pancakes it was rolled in was super chewy and flavorless. Not flaky crunchy and savory like it's supposed to be. Also the beef is tendonous, which adds to the chewiness. There's no sauce or in the rolls. Usually there's a sweet hoisin sauce but this one doesn't have any. 

Shanghai dumplings:  2 stars. It's very different. Some of the skin breaks so all the juices leak out before you even touch it. I would say at least 3 out of the 8 had no juice. The ones with the juice/soup tastes different from the more traditional Shanghai dumplings. This one seems to have a very strong pork and soy sauce flavor but that's about it. Wouldn't order it again. 

I gave it 4 stars because I do want to come back to try other things and I think that this place is a really good deal. All the food listed came it to 22 dollars and the two of us were very very full. Also once you order, food comes hella quick!",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,5,3,4,S8A2MOqieSIL96LGsHGOcA

I came here with my family and the meal was absolutely delicious (and to Emily R: the menu is just fine; items are understandable; there are just some things that are lost in translation). 

The beef noodle soup was full of beef. Not only that, but this beef was so deliciously tender. The noodles were infinitely better than Lawrence described... The soup was very lite, and not oily like many beef noodle soups that I've had before; the noodles weren't overcooked or undercooked. For an appetizer, I ordered the beef  tendon and that was very flavorful (I ordered it spicy) and was a pretty large order for the $2.50 that we paid for it. We also ordered a handful of other items off the menu like shao bing, fan tuan, soy milk, and a few other pastries and they all were excellent for the price. Everything was flavorful, but not overwhelmingly so at any point. The soy milk they serve plain so you're able to add sugar to your liking (just like in Taiwan!). No corn syrup crap here.

I would come here over and over again if I lived in the area but alas, it's an 8+ hr drive from where I live :(

The soy milk is thin and comes plain. The waitress told me that I would need to add sugar to sweeten it. Maybe after some of the reviews saying it was too sweet got them to just serve it this way. I am a fan of self service and added just a little to lightly adjust the flavor. Unsure about the sizes of the dishes here, I decided to order one at a time. Lucky, for me, because the Egg Cake and Chinese Doughnuts ($4.75) is a bountiful feast. One stick of two doughnuts are wrapped in a large egg pancake. When the waitress came around, she had many little plates on a tray and dealt them out to multiple tables. I eyed the largest plate and wondered what it was. Wonder no more, because it was mine. I debated on whether or not to finish my meal, but the perfectly brown dough begged not to be wasted. The savory and soft egg gave amazing textural contrast to the deep fried bread. They fry them up to order, because on the bottom of my plate, there was a little puddle of oil. Usually this is a turn off, but the taste makes it easy to overlook a normal infraction.

At $7.03, I ended up with a delicious meal at fast food prices. I would like to come back and try some of the pickled mustard green or vegetable buns. 

For a large restaurant, there is only one waitress attending to guest and cashiering. She apologized a few times for the wait time, but it was nothing to get hung up over.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,6,4,4,4_OOGrlwrhEnWsnFYO8LbQ

First off, you know you ""made"" it to the right delicious place when most of the workers there don't speak much English, service is a little subpar, but the food is goshdarn delicious.

We ordered the salty rice roll, which is pretty delicious even though it's such a very simple dish. But hey- sometimes the simpler the better! Their soup dumplings are also pretty delicious, but the wrapping is somewhat a bit too thin so some of the dumplings leaked the delicious juice right as you picked it up from the tin.

Our favorite dish was the daikon with egg. So delicious! I highly recommend this one, and it's great for sharing too. 

Overall, the food here is really good. Don't expect 5 star service, but your tummy will be happy. Credit cards accepted, plenty of parking.",lDKbTlZqjIn2gn490gU2HQ,4,4,4,_z076CwVrmiafRVMG807dA

We got the rice ball with Chinese fried dough and this is a lot bigger than the ones you get in Taiwan.  It's definitely American sized. 

We had the salty soy milk, one of my favorite things.  Just like home.  We got the sesame pocket with beef w pickled vegetable or I think they called it the beef roll.... amazing.  Spicy marinated meat with tendon is delicious and just enough spicy.  We also had some milk tea...  

Everything is delicious even though the lady might be slightly sassy and snappy....  she also reminds me of home...  :)  I was able to chat up with the owner grandpa, he was super sweet and when he found out I'm also Taiwanese with ancestors from Shandong he was super friendly and the conversation just flowed.

5629965,2011-12-13,1,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"It was Sunday and we were coming off our high of an exciting and fun weekend in Vegas.  It only seemed appropriate for us to ""sober up"" with some traditional Taiwanese breakfast foods.  The place was slightly out of the way but we were still up and at 'em early enough to avoid those who waiting until check-out time to run for the CA border.

It wasn't busy which was a relief (possibly due to its location) and when we walked in, we were promptly given a clean and spacious table.  The restaurant isn't big but it wasn't crowded either.

We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff.  The best of which were:
Egg cake with Chinese donut - we thought the egg cake would be wrapped around one Chinese donut but it was two.  Massive!  and we ordered 3 of them!!
Taiwan-style stir fried rice noodles - topped with a meat sauce...totally reminded me of home.
Stinky tofu - not too stinky but the garlic soy sauce paste they serve with it was so yummy, the tofu ended up being a vehicle for the soy sauce instead of the other way around.
Tofu custard soup (salty) - looks almost like a hot and sour soup.  some people might find it bland but I couldn't get enough of it
Cold soybean milk - very fresh and tasty, natural

The not as impressive:
Oyster pancake - I noticed they used clams.  CLAMS!  That's very different from oysters and make the pancake very terrible.  The sauce they used was also too sweet.
Taiwan-style ""meat ball"" - this is really some ground up meat and bamboo shoots inside a skin made of rice flour so it's chewier.  Texturally, it was good.  The meat itself was seasoned well.  Unfortunately, they used the same sauce on it as on the oyster pancake - too sweet!
Steam pork/veggie bun - I didn't personally try this but my friends said it was dry.
Milk tea - they used some wierd condensed milk which threw off the taste of the tea and it was further ruined by the fact they didn't use Taiwanese black tea (red tea in Chinese).

Service was very good and friendly with the owner/lady coming over to chat with us briefly.  We thanked them a lot and they thanked us a lot and in the end, everyone was happy.  I hope we can make this a Vegas tradition!",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,2,1,4,Kjw7a7qQodllfP1a0GEgwQ

The owner's daughter makes a lot of the food that they serve and she is very passionate about food.  I kept asking her questions on how to make a lot of the food and she enthusiastically walked me through her processes.  She even brought out the dough for some of the Youtiao (chinese donutto show me how to do it, and explained the length of time it takes her to do it.  They also get up early to make their own soy milk.

The spicy beef and tendon noodle soup is delicious.  My mother also tends to get the stinky tofu there, which I very much enjoy too.  They also sell frozen products like Zongzi (Chinese stuffed banana leaf filled with rice and other goods).  They stand by all of the products they make and are very authentic.

We ordered a breakfast meal pretty much. It was just veggie-pork bun and oil sticks and this sweet soupy stuff. I totally forgot the name. If you look at the menu, everything looks cheap. It's about $1-4 range (the menu on the wall). I'm probably going to come here a lot with friends now and get random stuff here and there.

This past visit, we ordered almost one of everything on the menu, so I might miss a few descriptions of some of the food items.

Both steamed and pan fried pork dumplings were served with a sweet ginger vinegar sauce. The dumplings were juicy and full of flavour. These dishes tasted amazing.

There were a few other pan fried dishes, but my favourite was the egg pancake and oyster pancake. The egg pancake had a layer of pan fried egg on top of a green onion pancake. The flavors just mesh so well together. The oyster pancake was thin and chewy just as it is supposed to be. The sauce for the oyster pancake is hard to master, but complimented the pancake so well. 

Overall, I recommend making time to try this restaurant. Since most of the food is carb-y, it is also great for breakfast the morning after drinking. I would recommend any dish in the menu, and you won't be disappointed.",bJ-Gmr2bAlUEkp_3pGShsQ,3,3,5,CDImWkmOhel9eB8tmYj24g

5918761,2010-09-04,8,JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA,"Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli has finally opened just a few doors down from 168 Supermarket. And on its first day being opened to the public, it has already attracted a very nice crowd of eager patrons.

From the hand written signs near the cashiers counter, it states that it is open everyday except Thursday. This little restaurant with seating capacity of 48 has a Breakfast Menu which is served from 7am to 11:30am, and a Lunch Menu served from 11:30am to 9pm. Since I was coming from work, by the time I had arrived it was already 11:36am and most of their breakfast items were sold out. Meaning no freshly made soy milk (or Iced Soy/Bean Juice as it is called in their menu) for me, which was the primary objective of this visit and the reason for skipping the free lunch at work. So I ordered the Beef Roll with Preserved Vegetable (it was that or the version made with pork), which was pretty much the only item available from the Breakfast Menu. And it was quickly served to me on a red china and still wrapped in the plastic wrap.  It is a sesame crusted thin bread stuffed with slices of braised beef with Chinese preserved vegetable.  It was alright. A little on the dry side, but a good experience to try their version thousands of miles away from the original in Taiwan and China.

As I ate and looking over their menu I see that they also serve various handmade dumplings (such as ""Steam Bao"" aka Xiao Long Bao, which was also sold out), Spicy Beef Noodle (which I ordered), various Taiwanese Deli, Shaved Ice (which they don't currently serve), cold beverages and hot desserts. The back of their business cards also states in Chinese that they served Taiwanese style hot pots, but that is not in their menu, just like the breakfastitems are not listed in the menu. I also ordered ""Temple Meatball"" and Fish-Ball Soup (should be more accurately called Fuzhou fish ball).



The first item I ordered arrived quickly, since it was premade and came on a plate still wrapped in plastic wrap.  It was okay, maybe too dried and lack much flavor to warrant trying again in the future.  After that it took pretty long for the items to be sent out the kitchen, since I doubt they were expecting this kind of crowd on opening day and they probably don't have any proper line cooks working in the back.  So by the time I finished everything and paid by bill it is 12:50pm already.

The kitchen is definitely not ready for the better than expected turnout, but hopefully with more practice they will soon get the hang of it.  As of right now, there is no POS in use, so items that are out, must be communicated to the staff taking the orders as it comes in, and if not everyone is on the same page, you end up with customers waiting for a good long time, until they either ask about the status of their order or just gives up and pay for what they have already been served. Furthermore, the kitchen and the expeditor needs to agree on how orders are placed and executed, because the time for discussing how to handle order tickets is not in the middle of service.

Food-wise, I thought it was just okay.  The best item I tried was the Spicy Beef Noodle, except I felt the beef needed to be braised longer, since not all of them were tender. There are also still a lot of things I want to try if they are actually available, so I will be back.

Menu - sadly very typical of the mom and pop operations in that the English translations of menu items are 1) misspelled, 2) poorly translated, 3) utilises questionable word choice.  If the restaurant needs someone to correct their menu, I can do it. I just hate seeing simple words like tofu, noodle, chicken spelled correctly in one part of the menu and not in others. And I also can't understand why some parts of the menu is not translated at all, like the shaved ice. It is not that hard to translate select any 3 toppings, 4 toppings, etc for X price.
Parking - pretty convenient since it is in the same plaza as 168 Market.

Price - pretty reasonable for most items.

When we finally decided what we wanted and ordered, we were excited about our meals coming out. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. I did enjoy some of the food we had ordered, but a majority of it was bland. I didn't feel the need to lick my plate and that makes me sad.

soymilk  - nice and piping hot. 
beef pancake wraps - skip. the wrap wasn't crispy at all and the beef was bland and forgettable. comes with a side of that delicious pickled cabbage and the pickled cucumbers. Not enough oil on the pickled cucumbers though, so thankfully we ordered it on the side.
salted rice roll - GET THIS. It's a Chinese donut and shredded pork wrapped with sticky rice. Damn good. I haven't had one of these in ages. My pescetarian friend was able to order a vegetarian version.

I just asked a server if we could sit anywhere and got an affirmative. Menus are already on the tables and they're efficient in taking your order and bringing hot food. Pay at the counter. What else do you want from a mom and pop? We weren't charged tip automatically for our party of 3 - could be 'cause we paid cash and didn't really expect that much service.
