Dependable breakfast items. With basic presentations. 

Their banana but bread is the best thing on the menu. 

They offer a variety omelets and different breakfast dishes. 

I ordered the coned beef hash Benedict- the eggs were fried, not poached. 

The service decent, not amazing but not bad. 

Perfect location next to sun city. Fits the older clientele",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,1,1,3,9qR1CHqn3z9LScTYXWxyBQ
34153,2015-05-10,0,0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw,"It was a quaint little breakfast joint.  Friendly (and honest!) staff, and tasty food.  I was hoping for fresh squeezed OJ but the server was honest and let me know they didn't squeeze their own.  No worries, I'd rather have water than oj from concentrate! :)

I ordered the stuffed french toast with apples, cinnamon and cream cheese.  It sounded delicious, and was mostly, but my advice would have been to serve the french toast slices on their own, with little pots of cream cheese spread, cinnamon apples, butter and syrop for the customer to put on the toast as desired.  The pre-assembled nature of the stuffed toast caused the center to be soggy.  It was tasty, and didn't warrant a complaint, I'd just have preferred a crispier french toast. 

My husband enjoyed his country friend steak, and while they couldn't do poached eggs, the braised eggs were the next best things.  He gobbled it all up.  

A suggestions to the restaurant: perhaps offer a side of greens instead of the potato/hashbrowns/toast/tomato for the customers who are unable to eat or simply reducing the amount of sugar in their diets.  Just a suggestion :)

Thanks for a delicious breakfast!",A3HT4rRJvVXbHQsIxINEAA,0,0,4,jgJurJ-lG7DvGZyXikSoYA

   We went on a Wednesday morning; it was busy but we were greeted at the door & seated immediately. The servers (we had Pat, who was very friendly) and the owner Iggy all worked hard to keep the service quick & accurate. 
   There are over 40 different omelettes on the menu (and other items too) and each is made with 6 eggs! They were huge and the other ingredients were plentiful (neither of us could finish). The breakfast also includes homemade thin potato slices and delicious (and large) pumpkin or banana nut breads. The coffee mugs are even large!

My wife & I wanted to go out for breakfast on Sunday. After reading the reviews of this place, we decided to try it.  I ordered a waffle, my wife got bacon & eggs.  Honestly, I have enjoyed the breakfast at McDonald's more than this place. My waffle tasted like bread dough poured in a waffle iron. The eggs (over medium) were still runny, and the bacon was nearly as hard as beef jerky.
When our waitress asked the obligatory; ""How was everything?"" , we told her how disappointed we were.  The extent of her attempt at customer service was; ""Sorry"".

Maybe we were unlucky, but I see no reason to pay $17 for bacon, eggs, a waffle, and one glass of milk, if the product is sub-standard, and there is no attempt to please the customer.   I WILL NOT RETURN.",tLq1YP87NW0W_gKo28GitA,3,0,2,delQnga43CpOPstpW023Qw

626623,2010-08-31,0,0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw,"Nothing special. Not a great breakfast place and their Italian dinner items are bland. Went twice. Never again. On my second visit we went with another couple that had an Entertainment Book coupon. The staff wouldn't allow us to sit together and use both coupons. (Only one coupon per table, they said, although that wasn't specified on the coupon.) So our friends had to sit at a table next to us and we shouted at each other to have a conversation. Ridiculous.

Plus their highly touted banana bread reeks of artificial banana flavoring, not fresh bananas; and their special potatoes (served instead of standard hash browns) are like thick, hard, and slightly greasy potato chips.

I don't get the couple of enthusiastic reviews here. Perhaps they have a storied past, but for a Vegas newcomer (two months) this isn't even up to a Denny's standard.",LMJw2xuv_4ZMMVSTnMsjnA,3,0,1,4kxxZJ5un8ve9eawJeCurg
644028,2014-02-04,0,0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw,"I was surprised about how busy this place is, given it was breakfast and on a Sunday, however, it just never looked that busy to me from the outside. We went on around 10 am - the wait was 20 minutes for two people. However, there were two open seats at the counter with no waiting so we sat there. They told me that it was always that busy on weekend mornings. 

I had the St. Paddy's Day Omelet. Per the waitress the omelets were the best thing to get, made with six eggs. It was a little under $11. It was huge and could feed two people. The St. Paddy's Day omelet contained corned beef hash and cheddar cheese.  The omelet itself wasn't that impressive, other than the size, it tasted okay but a true omelet should be fluffy and a little soft in the center. This had more than consistency of a frittata, eggs were overcooked and was more dense than fluffy. 

The I picked the spuds that went with it. I think that they cut potatoes on a mandolin and fried them.  There was no vegetables, such as onion and green pepper like you may expect in a country potato, the slices were inconsistent as to thickness which in turn made them inconsistent as to how they were cooked. Some were really crispy like a potato chip and other thicker slices were undercooked and greasy in the center. 

Also, the entree came with banana bread, this was tasty, not sure if it was homemade or a box mix though. Some place you can easily tell box mix but either I was really hungry or my palette was off that I just wasn't sure.  

There is a 2 for 1 coupon in the entertainment book up to $7.00 off. So for two people with two omelets our total was around $18.00, I also had coffee which was $2.50. 

I debated between the two and three stars, the food was ""meh"" but the portion size was good and the waitress was very accommodating and nice. Also, she was relatively attentive considering how busy they were and it appeared that they were understaffed. Also, as a side note it took forever to get our food - they warned us they were back up after we ordered.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,0,3,o1UgKHOqMXqYlnsG7kB_Hg

I used to come here all the time a few years back, making a weekly trip. We moved away and stopped going unfortunately. We were in the area so I happily reminded my girlfriend of the place and we gave it a try again. 

Portions have shrunk from what they used to be, I get that maybe it's a cost-cutting measure, but it left me a little disappointed after my meal in which the old portions never seemed to have an issue with. 

We were also annoyed with the help, maybe since we're not older, we're rushed out, but our waitress was obviously trying to get us out of there. I used to love this place over the various egg-works chain of places, but sadly I doubt I'll be making a trip out here again.",gUJE1jwzhCuYIYjyXHdqoQ,0,0,3,I5fZ59uwW37Hlip0AO3nmw

The 3 egg version is only $1 less so it is a tough call not to get the big one.

The pancakes are really good and Giant, so keep that in mind when ordering those. The pumpkin bread is delish too.
So 4 waters, 4 coffees, 4  big omletes w/ breads and spuds, and a short stack to split was $60. We took home 4 boxes and had another meal out of it later.

What I really enjoy here is the basic breakfast since it's one of my favorite meals, I got the ham and eggs with toast.  Sure what I choose is a basic breakfast but I loved how it's all freshly made and the ham was cooked well and not overly salty.  I've eaten here with friends who've gotten the ""Kitchen Sink Omelet"" and various sandwiches and everyone has always left full and with boxes for the leftovers.

My wife and I went there this evening, basically for her to check it out and because I wanted Italian food. We were BOTH very happy, her in her discovery, and me in my quest for Italian food. 
We both had Italian dishes. The bean soup I had prior to my entree was VERY good. Both entree's were delicious. The flavor combinations were beyond description, and the pasta was cooked, PERFECTLY!!!
The owners parents were on duty this particular evening. Dee was very personable and pleasant, and Frank was as charming as a person can possibly be. I felt a bit guilty because it felt like my parents were serving me, but it also felt warm and very comfortable for the same reason.

2077448,2015-03-18,3,0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw,"The Omelet House is the perfect place to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner if you are in the Summerlin area. This place is located on Lake Mead and Rampart in the Smith's shopping center. We frequent this place about once every few months. It's a pretty popular spot and can get pretty busy during peak hours. Come hungry, because they give you a lot of food! For example, each omelet is made with 6 eggs! You also get hash browns or spuds, I always get the spuds, (think chips but softer) plus toast or a piece of fresh pumpkin or banana nut bread. The bread is really yummy! I have tried many things on the menu, lunch and dinner, and everything is pretty tasty. A few years ago, this place got a new owner and now they offer dinner with an Italian themed menu. Their hours are Mon-Friday from 7-7 and Sat and Sun from 7-2:30. Now the prices are a bit high for standard breakfast fare, but I suppose since they give you so much food it is justified. 

Mom, boyfriend and I stopped in for brunch on Sunday around 1. It was not very busy at all, so I assume we just missed the rush. We all decided to get an omelet, they have 38 different ones to choose from!  Mom got the Mile High City omelet which has ham, diced onion and green pepper, and she added cheese, but they charge $0.59 for cheese. Why this particular omelet doesn't come with cheese is beyond me, considering a majority of the other items do have cheese. Annoying little upcharges like this make me angry. Anyway my boyfriend had the sicilian omelette which has meatballs, italian sausage, mozzarella, and marina sauce. I decided on the kitchen sink omelette, which has no description on the menu, it just says ""For Adventurers"" so I had to ask the waitress what comes inside. She said 5 different kinds of meats, a bunch of veggies, marinara sauce and sour cream. This was tasty, but it was watery. They didn't cook the veggies long enough and I guarantee they were from frozen, so that is probably why there was so much water on my plate. Not super appetizing if you ask me. I could only finish about half of my food, and took the rest to go. I probably would not order that again. Anyway if you are in the are and looking for a decent place to eat, I would recommend this place.

The waitress rushed us through the entire meal even though the place was practically empty. Not only was it rushed, the waitress didn't even pretend to be friendly.

I didn't think a restaurant could screw up toast, but I was wrong. Toast can get pretty nasty when it's burnt and spread with yellow lard (not real butter). The home fries were like eating grease blobs.

My eggs were cooked true to order, but the bacon is cooked until crisp.  I really don't understand why a lot of restaurants cook their bacon until it's hard enough to crack a crown, but... whatevs!  The gravy was a little bland, but not gross or grainy like some other places around town.  The biscuit is tiny, but honestly you don't need much more than what's served on the platter!

I've driven by it a few times, but from the outside, it didn't catch my attention enough to want to stop in. Luckily, it popped up on my yelp and had great reviews so I knew it was time to check it out. 
When we walked in, we were greeted and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. It looks like a typical little dinner inside. The staff was nice. They were busy that morning so it took a little time to get our drinks and order, but it wasn't too bad. Since they're known for their omelets, we thought we'd try those. They have many to choose from so it was hard narrowing it down. A lot of them sounded so good. With your omelet, you have a choice of potatoes and a bread. We decided to get the pumpkin bread and banana bread so we could try both. I really liked the pumpkin bread, but I was disappointed in the banana bread which is usually my favorite. It was really dark and tasted burnt. He got the pork chili Verde and I can't remember the name of mine but it had corned beef hash, potatoes and cheddar cheese in it. I also got a side order of hollandaise sauce to put on mine. Definitely get the potatoes over the hash browns. They were delicious. The omelets are huge. I had enough food to eat for breakfast for 2 days. I think it had like 6 eggs in it. Definitely worth checking this place out.

You walk in and get that old school diner feel (which I like) with counter and all. We were seated immediately and asked what we would like to drink. Menu is huge! So many options and you can even pick from their lunch menu. I actually intended on ordering the eggs benedict when something caught my eye....LOBSTER BENEDICT!! Holy crap that sounds freaking good. 

So within 15 minutes I had this delicious and awesome looking meal sitting in front of me, I drenched it with tapatio and dug right in. This has got to be the best egg benedict I have ever had. I don't think I would even try anything else on the menu and risk missing out on this the next time I come. They were not stingy with the lobster meat either, you savor every bite. 

With this awesomeness came these potatoes that were similar to chips only soft, they were equally delish, especially mix with the yolk from the eggs benedict. The service was great, she checked up on us quite often and refilled our drinks as needed. The eggs benedict was like $11 so for $3 more try it with lobster, you will not regret it.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,10,5,5,fUte1I_Iui-a4X5FZJY62A

The restaurant is located in a strip mall of Summerlin- about 12 miles from the strip. The restaurant is family owned with beautiful pictures of the kids. This is definately not your chain restaurant. 

The service was exceptional with the waitress filling my coke about 4 times. The meal started with a huge slice of homemade pumpkin loaf that was great.

I had the kitchen sink. It was very large and fresh. It was absolutely huge with lots of cheese and very fresh. There were a few strange things like pieces of meatball. I think it had about 5 eggs and I had to bring half home.

My wife had the shrimp omelette. The shrimp was probably frozen but still very tasty. There was a ton of cheese.

We did not like the potato chips- sliced potatoes with skin on. The fries were kinda mediocre. Next time we order the hash browns.

The total bill was $25.00 which was very reasonable for excellent food and great service.

Atmosphere: Community diner with a ton of local people- lots of elderly also. Not too many kids so it was a very quiet and pleasant Sunday breakfast.

Overall: Excellent value and a great community feel- a definite return visit.

I didn't expect anything of the place since I have never heard of anyone I know that had been at this place. Soon as I got out the car, I was walking up towards the entrance and an old man who walked in with me, asked me right away ""how many ?"" I replied, ""4; 2 kids, 2 adults please"" .  He sat us at the booth. I am not sure who he was, but he was older, italian man, after we were seated, he disappeared. (lol maybe he was a ghost)

Anyhow, I was amazed when I saw the MENU. I browsed thru the whole thing and went with the ""The Kitchen Sink"" which had EVERYTHING you can think of. It had a disclaimer below it ""Warning: For Adventurous people only"" or something to that effect. Well, so I order the darn thing.

So when I go out, I observe the staff members at these different establishments and I have only rave reviews for the employees at Omlette House.  And because of it, I personally feel that the great service here is reflected in the food.

Fair warning, here's where I get sentimental. It appears that the true regulars here are in their golden years. At the counter sits an elderly gentleman alone, or is he? The waitress asks him, ""DID YOU VISIT YOUR WIFE TODAY? DID YOU GET TO FEED HER? And he replies. As they begin their conversation, other staff members start to gather around him and begin to joke and laugh with him. Its good to see the young showing their support for the elderly. This is just one of a few things I observed in my one visit but by far the most memorable. 

Back to the food! The menu includes many fun omelet names and the descriptions make them all sound so good. It took a while for us to decide what we wanted to try first. 

There are many restaurants where the food portions are large. However, larger doesn't always mean better. The omelet portions are large and so very good. I could only finish half of my very delicious Mediterranean omelet that included lobster and shrimp in every bite. I was looking forward to having leftovers for breakfast the following morning. With my order, i chose spuds, thick cut of potato chips. Yum!

My husband really enjoyed The Kitchen Sink omelet,  which was larger than my omelet. It had everything, four types of breakfast meats, typical omlette veggies, including broccoli,  cheeses, sour cream, and marinara sauce.

Although the short stack was fluffy, it wasn't all that great. But that's okay, the omelets made up for it.

First thing, the service was superb.  The husband and wife owners worked as a team in front and there was a cook in back.  It felt like you were at the home of a friend and your friend's outgoing parents were there making you laugh and cooking you dinner.

The food that was ordered...
Caesar salad with shrimp and Spaghetti with meatballs.

The salad was your standard Caesar with bland bottled dressing that came with a piece of garlic bread which was the same cigar shaped piece of bread that you get at Olive Garden.  It was close to closing which unfortunately was probably the reason why the bread was stale.  Mark H said the shrimp that was with the salad was tasty, though.

My Spaghetti and meatballs was not so good.  The sauce was very bland and the meatballs lacked flavor.  The saving grace for me was that we had a bowl of grated parmesan at the table so I buried the dish with cheese and hot sauce. :)  My dinner also came with a piece of cigar bread and with a bowl of soup (or you can have salad.)  The soup was a Navy bean which was the best part of the meal.  It was super thick like a stew and had a nice hint of smokey ham hock.  Maybe I should've gotten a big ladle of Navy bean soup poured over my pasta.

This is another spot that's really close to the house I stay at so it's convenient,  I just need to make sure I come here to try the breakfast the next time.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,10,9,3,9zPZ4RcWVh4ojftOzwA9NQ

I've eaten at this location with my mother several times, as she enjoys talking with the  owner's family, who are from the old country (Italy/Sicily). I've never been terribly impressed with the food, and the spuds/fries are just awful. 

I hadn't been back for over a year, and I was nearby and decided to give the place another chance. Big mistake. I ordered one of the cheeseburgers and went to take a bite when I noticed tiny green flecks in the interior of the bun. I inspected the bun more thoroughly, and saw a larger (about 1/4 inch diameter) patch of light green mold. 

I called my server over and informed her of the problem and that I would not be paying for the meal. She was very apologetic and offered to replace my meal with something else from the menu. My appetite was gone at this point, so I elected to leave. As I was gathering my things, I saw my server showing the manager (one of the managing family) my burger. The manager actually said to my server: ""I don't know what that is, but it isn't mold."" 

Really? I know what moldy bread looks like when I see it, and I'm sure as heck not going to eat it!! I just hope that the manager didn't take my bill out of the server's check.",88bX84kj-1Rk77wfrZ62JQ,3,0,1,z_MGfSSvGSy92eJ6MA4GiQ

Come and visit Omelet House for a satisfying meal that will leave you feeling like you consumed 2 days worth of food, lol. Actually everything is large in portions and they can make your order half sizes as well. The menu is quite extensive with omelettes being the main feature, which included 40 different variety of omelette and the option of customizing. Each order comes with your choice of starch that includes hash browns, fries or potatoes studs. Plus your selection of bread or homemade banana bread or pumpkin bread.

Our omelette were made just right and was very filling. The hash browns were cooked evenly with a good amount of crisp and soft like texture and they were seasoned to our liking. However, the homemade Pumpkin and Banana Bread was spot on! Moist and soft throughout and it wasn't dried out. It had this nostalgic flavor that reminded me my childhood years when my family would baked fresh bread. Special shoutout to our awesome server, John! :)

I had the house special omelette called ""My Little Chick-A-Dee"" which was an omelette made with chicken breast cubes, broccoli, onions, and cheddar cheese. I had my choice of hash browns or fried potatoes and I opted for the hash browns.  I also got rye toast.

4014375,2013-09-20,2,0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw,"Pretty good hidden little spot for breakfast in Summerlin.  Really, it is kinda hidden.  If I didn't see the bunch of people coming out of this little place on a Sunday morning I might have never thought to look in this corner of the strip mall!  It's located in the Smith's shopping center off of Rampart and Lake Mead.  

Seems like this Omelet House is owned by a family that is from Chicago, so the decor reflects as much.  I have no problem with that, the home of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Hot Dog (one of my fav sinful snacks) are OK with me.  It was super busy on a Sunday morning, good mix of locals and what seemed to be a bunch of church goers.  Praise be!  Hallelujah!  I got the Spirit inside me!  Sorry, sorry...too many Madea movies lately.

After a short wait we were seated by our nice hostess.  I'm thinking she may be one of the owners, her native Chicago accent was present!  A few short minutes later our waitress presented herself and brought us our drinks of water and coffee.  

The menu at The Omelet House is almost typical with lots of other breakfast joints here in Vegas.  Lots and lots of breakfast items, with a mix of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and soups.  I know this place does dinner as well, but I didn't get to go through that menu so we'll just focus on breakfast and lunch.  I really like how this Omelet House has a sprinkling of Chicago in their menu, they have some good looking stuff.  Specialties like Chicago dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches can be had for your meal.  There are a number of omelettes and breakfast specials to choose from, it can be overwhelming.

I stuck with what I like from these breakfast joints, a Club Sandwich.  Yes, a Club Sandwich.  In this case at The Omelet House, a California Club.  Comes with turkey, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on white or wheat bread.  Also a side of potato spuds (think chips), fries, soup or salad.  I don't know what it is about a Club Sandwich that I like so much.  Might be the nostalgia of when we used to go to restaurants as a kid my Mom would always order a Club Sandwich and share some with me.  Might be that 3rd layer of bread that made a Club Sandwich seem so darn special.

Anyway, the Club Sandwich at The Omelet House was good.  A nice sized portion, big looking sandwich.  The bread was nice and toasted, the veggies were fresh, and the fries were tasty.  Not the best Club Sandwich I've ever had because this one needed more mayo (lots please), and some bacon!  This sandwich would have been off-the-cuff with some crispy bacon!  It was just missing a punch of salt.

The wifey had a corned beef omelet with potato spuds.  Large omelet!  Very tasty too.  The salty corned beef went great with the delicate eggs.  Add some Tabasco and it was some good eats.  But I have had better omelettes elsewhere.  Breakfasts also come with your choice of toast, english muffin, pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread, or tortillas.  We got the banana nut bread and it was yummy.  Not too dry, lots of bananas!  

It's a tad pricy to eat at The Omelet House I'm guessing because it is Summerlin after all.  Much of the menu ranges from the $7 - $10 area for entree type dishes.  So if you're a cheapy look at the menu accordingly.  Service is fast since you will probably be eating with a million other people.  But they are nice for the most part.  Probably be back here again for a meal, just wouldn't be my top choice.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,2,3,88Jmj-LW-BHIrLZ1p32NDQ

Just let me get their customer service out of way first.  The Omelet House has superb customer service.  There's never been a wait, the entire staff is great, and the food is served with the quickness. 

Omelet House has been around for a couple of years now.  They serve breakfast, lunch, and Italian food.  I have yet to try any of their Italian dishes, but I have tried their breakfast and burgers.  Of course, the highlight is their omelets.  The Omelet House has a long list of omelets ranging from your basic cheese to their everything omelet dubbed ""The Kitchen Sink"".  They have close to 25 different omelets with cool names to them.  Their omelets come with two slices of bread and potato chips.  Honestly, I've never been a huge fan of potato chips with my omelets, but always end up eating them anyway.  Omelet House has an extensive list of other food options.  But let's be real.  This is the Omelet House.  I'm getting omelets. Besides, I was born to eat omelets.  My name is even in the word omelet.  Overall, I'm a fan. I'm just surprised that I haven't dined here more often. 

MY FAVORITES:
-Meat Lover's ($11.99):  Made with at least 6 eggs, a ton of cheese, bacon, ham, sausage, and ground beef.  This is my go-to omelet.  6 eggs is a lot, especially when it's stuffed with a bunch of protein.  Get this if you want to be full.

-Double Yolk Burger ($12.95): I'm not a huge fan of the bun, but love the rest.  This burger is two 1/2 lb. patties of lean Angus beef, bacon, American cheese, Thousand Island dressing, and an egg.  Keep in mind that their burgers are leaner, which to some may mean less taste.  I think it's perfect. 

TIP #1:  They serve Italian food.  I never noticed the Italian food on the menu. 
TIP #2:  Their omelets are made with 6 large eggs.  If this is too big, you can get their half order.  They only take off a $1. So, I recommend that you get a full order.  Best bang for your buck! 
TIP #3:  Their chili with cheese is packed with a lot of cheese.  Not bad. Good if you got chili cravings. 
TIP #4:  Restaurant is a lot larger in the inside than it appears from the outside. 
TIP #5:  Opens at 7:00 AM.  Closes at 7:00 PM.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,7,7,4,IVM7IXrI5AO8skU7nvO8tg

I had the Eggs Benedict and added a side of banana bread. The Eggs Benedict was delicious, loved their ""potato chips"", dip those in the Hollandaise....yum!

They offer a pretty wide/diverse selection of omelets plus some other breakfast dishes & lunch items.  Despite the name, we noticed that they had dinner menus there too.

We stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10am, and there was a 15 minute wait for a table.  It has a family owned business feel; everything and everybody has a purpose.  There were quite a few families with children who were all well behaved.  Service was no frills and to the point, but it was difficult to get water refills.

Bf was super happy about his omelet, the #20 Polish Omelet that was stuffed with cheddar & polish sausage.  The ham & egg plate was better than it looked.  

The mentality here was one of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', so I highly suspect that they will thrive on with the same consistency of service, menu, decor, etc.  Will nothing was bad, nothing was overly memorable as well.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,1,0,3,IiSGu6dd3ovgm0RlFhiMZA

My husband, son, and I went to have breakfast one Saturday morning.  We arrived and were seated at approximately 8 am.  I had a meeting and had to leave around 9.  I ordered Eggs Benedict and at 8:45 our food was finally delivered.  The plates were too hot to touch, suggesting the food had sat under the heat lamp for quite some time.  When I cut into my eggs they were hard cooked.  I tried to flag down the waitress, but had to wait about 10 minutes to finally get her attention.  When she finally came over I asked her to please remove it from the bill.  She told me if I ate even one bite she was unable to.  I hadn't eaten even a bite.  The owner came over and gave me a $7 off card for our next visit.  I thanked him but told him I just wanted the meal taken off and didn't need a coupon off our next meal.  It was a simple mistake and unfortunately didn't have time to have the eggs remade.  No harm, no foul.  He insisted I take the coupon.  I had to leave so my husband paid the bill.  Later in the day I looked at the receipt and saw I was charged for the Eggs Benedict after all!  I went back to the restaurant and tried to explain the situation.  The owner came up to the cashier and said he had given me a $7 off coupon.  The improperly prepared food had cost $10.99.  I asked for her to refund the money plus tax.  The owner took $10 out of his pocket and tossed it on the counter and asked for his coupon back and rudely suggested that I order something else IF I come back.  As I turned to leave the cashier said to the owner, loudly enough for me to hear, that she couldn't believe I was making such a big deal over $10 and that if I couldn't afford to go out to eat then I shouldn't go out to eat.  I left this restaurant feeling really horrible.  Twice a month for the past 3 years we have eaten there, we have spent about $40 per meal.  Yet I was treated so poorly when I asked for a wrong to be righted.  I will not return and hope that they treat other customers better than me.",PoYoSyoRqo9EVrkTIVCVog,2,0,1,IqiCgNmzgmXFo-yAaSWxWQ

I hate giving lousy ratings to a place like this because I know there are many loyal retirees that live nearby and make this place their 2nd home. And that, by itself, is a cool thing. But, after today's breakfast, I need to leave a review.  Breakfast today was one of the worse I've eaten in a very long time. The famous ""corned beef hash"" tasted sour and luke warm in temp and like it was reheated. The hash browns looked and tasted as if it were from a frozen box. The toast was stale. The only thing that tasted decent were the 2 eggs!  Not to mention that my CBH and eggs and coffee totaled more than $13!! Ridiculous. 2 McD sausage mcmuffins with egg for $3.33 and a $1 coffee would have hit the spot much better.

Service is also spotty. Sometimes you get one of the more vibrant smiling wait staff, and other times you're not so lucky. You get a disenchanted bus-boy type person.
I've been eating here for 2 years now, and I think it's about time I wrote about it.

The Omelet House doesnt care about that nonsense. They are proud to be from Chicago and dont  try to hide it. All of their decor is Chicago based and I was in heaven.

Ok so how was the food? It was awesome! There was two of us and we split three dishes. The daughter had eggs Benedict and I had the loch ness. We split the waffle plate. The daughter said the Benedict was delicious and loved the waffle. 

My loch ness was pretty good but kinda gross at the same time.  I love seafood and I love eggs/breakfast dishes but have never tried to put the two together? Had to give it a try. 

The Shrimp was fresh but the shrimp flavor didnt mix well with the eggs and the avocado didnt help blend the flavors together. My suggestion for it would be to add a creamy white sauce to help blend the three contrasting flavors together.

The wait staff was top notch always willing to make a suggestion and refill your drink. Jen was our server and she was awesome and knew the dishes well enough to answer the many questions I had as well as to make suggestions bases on my questions.
