It's not that it was bad it was just not that exciting, I guess I expected more out of a Vegas restaurant.  The shrimp with the rice noodles were HUGE but a little stringy and the salmon was a little strong tasting but the seafood dumplings were yummy.  The dessert, some molten chocolate thing was dry and the ice cream with it too hard, we kept banging the plate with our spoons and it was flipping all over the place (is that too nit-picky?? if so, ignore!)!  Sidebar, don't you feel like molten chocolate cakes are over now?  I mean you can buy these at the store already made and just microwave them, think up another way to serve chocolate cake already!! (ignore also the fact that we ordered it!)  

A friend I was with was very impressed that the moment he ""looked"" like he needed service, he got it, so that was a plus.  Overall a decent place, I just wouldn't recommend it since there are so many other places to go.",9yuOMbrURP4we2CIZVuGdA,0,0,2,t1xw_v4up7LhvN6YY7U2Gw

The service was so bad and there was zero ambiance, which would have been ok if the food would have been good.  When I say horrible, I mean just embarrassing.  The chicken in the chow mein was not edible.  It was so fatty and disgusting looking.  Imagine if you had chicken in the most shady of restaurants in the scariest of cities, that is what mine looked like AND tasted like. 

My appetizer-Rock shrimp tempura.  It came out cold and tasted as if it had been sitting around.  One of the few meals in my life that I actually felt ripped off.

The Chicken Spring Rolls are fantastic. The best spring rolls I have ever had and would go here again because of them. The cucumber salad is also delicious. 

The servers were attentive and had fun stories for us about celebrity sightings (Mariah Carey is a fan of this place). They kept filling our water and making sure we had everything we needed. 

We also talked to the manager for tips on where to go after dinner. He gave us great suggestions and was really nice and helpful. We ended up going to Ghostbar and the Playboy Club. Both were AWESOME, I definitely recommend both of them. The view at the Ghostbar is unreal, just beautiful.

We had the steak (excellent with sauteed baby mushrooms and peppers), Palms Roll, Creme Brulee, Seaweed Salad and Ahi Tuna Salad.

Went for the $45 prie fixe menu and ordered:
- hot and sour soup: this was really good. I'm a daughter of a Chinese restaurant chef so I've been spoiled and know whats good and this was good. It surprised me because no one ever gets this right besides my dad.
- lettuce wraps: not a stir fry type lettuce wrap. Comes with 4 types of sashimi tartars and endive as the cups. I enjoyed it. Just had to ask for sriracha. :)
- assorted sushi: ordinary, nothing to rave about.
- kona coffee creme brûlée: it cracked when I hit it with a spoon - a plus! Tasty, a tad on the sweet side but overall good.

Yeah there are a gazillion choices in Las Vegas and granted I come from the land of sushi, but Little Buddha was a decent pick.  We opted for some of the appetizers to start: the crab cakes and the pot stickers (the shrimp ones) were delish.  The sushi was pretty good as well and the mongolian beef was nice and spicy.  The ambience is chil and despite what others have written I found the service to be good.  Then again it was CES and people were probably on their best behavior.

The retaraunt is set up horribly. All half table half booth combinations, the booth seating allowing for me to sink so low into the seat that I felt I needed a booster chair. 

For an appetizer we had the calamari, which on it's own was very ordinary. But the sauce that came with it was amazing! 

I am a big sushi fan and ordered the spicy albacore and yellowtail roll. It was a big waste of $9. No flavors whatsoever. Very bland.

For my entree I ordered the orange chicken. Upon arrival of my plate I was pleasantly surprised. The aroma caught my attention first, it smelled fantastic! And the portion was a good size. The taste however again was on the flavorless side.

Then again, reflecting back, most of the dishes ordered were sushi rolls and standard Americanized Chinese fare.  Orange chicken, Kung Pau, Lo Mein, etc.  I think there is a secret society of restaurant mercenaries who enforce boring Chinese food recipes throughout the US to keep us all locked into the gooey, oily, soy sauce laden dishes that you can get at any Chinese carry out shop.

This visit to Little Buddha was nothing like that!  I was given a voucher as a gift, from a well known online program that offers great deals in local cities.  (think of animals in confined spaces)  Anyway, this offering had a specific menu, apart from the standard.  It began with a tasting of 3 premium cold sakes, ranging from sweet to dry.  2 of the 3 were delicious, and the 3rd was still nice.  A good warm up to the dinner that was coming.  Choice of 2 appetizers included very yummy chicken lettuce wraps.  Although they're the most common appetizer on the Chinese menu these days, these were very tasty, not too salty, and served with nice leaves of Bibb lettuce, which I appreciate so much more than iceberg.  The other selection was seafood dumplings which were served over a sauce that was pretty much lobster bisque.  I wanted to lick the serving plate, but people were sitting nearby.  :o  Next was choice of 2 entrees, which included a seared salmon over a wonderfully light and citrusy (is that a word?  it is now!) sauce.  Perfectly cooked, moist, flaky, and not drowned in soy and teryaki like most Asian restaurant preparations.  The other was roasted duck served over another light sweet sauce.  Roasted beautifully with a crispy skin exterior.  I did pick up the legs and eat the meat off the bone on those!  It had to be done! The shared side was something new....roasted Shishito peppers!  These were amazing!  Like little charred jewels of happiness with just enough heat to keep it interesting.  There was a selection of dessert offerings also, but I'm not a fan of the sweets.  The coffee Crème brûlée looked nice though.

Overall, this was one of the better meals I've had in a casino restaurant that wasn't steak or seafood.  The atmosphere in Little Buddha is very calm and comforting, with a neo jazz/funk background soundtrack, it keeps the vibe just hip enough to be casual and not stuffy.

Which was exceptionally good & juicy, if I hadn't pigged out on something else earlier that day I would've easily been able complete this delectable meal. If you like your beef medium well, then you might want to have them cook it medium instead - mine was not as pink as I was hoping. It was still very, very good though. 

Drinks were on the expensive side - what do you expect...it's Vegas baby! 

The total price was kind of on the high side. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4. I wish there was an option for a 3.5 star rating. Yelp crew?

The downside to our visit was the service, I would give them 1 star for the service, it was that bad. We literally waited 30 minutes between courses which was just ridiculous. We were there with a large party but the rest of the restaurant was slow so I didn't understand what the problem was.

Pros:

1. Service. Basically if you give us good service, I'm going to write a good review about you no matter what. Our servers were fantastic, kept the sake coming, graciously took photos of our whole group, didn't seem to mind us being loud and laughing and a bit distracted, and waited patiently until we were ready to order. I was quite impressed with the staff. The hostess even politely said goodbye and thank you to each and every one of us as we left. Very polite.

2. Décor. It's beautiful in there!


3. Menu variety. There was plenty of delicious options to choose from!

4. Everyone else's food. I tried a friend's orange chicken, YUM. The groom-to-be ordered the spiny tailed lobster, which was probably one of the best things I've ever tasted. It had a fantastic creamy sauce generously poured all over it. SO GOOD. 

5. Location. The plan that night was to hit up the Playboy Club and Moon - which were right next door to the restaurant, so we could start getting our party on right after dinner!


Cons:

1. Unfortunately, MY food. I ordered the Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon, which came out and looked beautiful, but was way too dry for a piece of ""gourmet"" fish. The broth was good to add some moisture, and was nice and tangy, but it just didn't save the fish.

Started with a Saketini....which sucked. Sake, midori etc. tastes like you cracked open a honeydew and took a bite. Too sweet and too boring. 4/10

Food: George's roll! This is the George Maloof's signature roll (He owns the hotel) It was nothing short of phenomenal, quite possibly the best maki roll I've ever had. George's roll is made up of shrimp tempura, avocado and fish roe topped off with lobster. I will be back simply to have this again. 10/10

Its pretty. Really. Love the decor and ambiance.
Service. I am a whore for good service. 
FRESH. SUPER FRESH. UBER FRESH. yay fish!

Fave apps:
1. Wok Fried Calamari and Shrimp- lightly fried and golden with a sweet and spicy dip laced with fish sauce. 
2. Korabuta Pork Potstickers- extra special potstickers, not at all greasy with an awesome ginger sauce.
3. Filo Wrapped Tiger Prawns- shredded filo envelops these gigantic prawns and they are laid in a basil-coconut sauce that is out of this world.

Fave Rolls:
1. Little Buddha Roll- this is one of those rolls where it is a lot, but it all just goes together. The crab is awesome and of course anytime you have spicy and sweet together I am a fan. 
2. Fantasy Roll- light and fresh. The crab is real and king and the halibut is thin on top.
3. Palm's Roll- killer Naruto, not too spicy.

I am not a fan of spicy food, but everyone else loves the Jalapeno Yellowtail. And I have to admit, the only entree I have tried is the fried rice :)

Sake menu is great, they have mochi for after dinner and the pistachio creme brulee is to die for. 

Pretty expensive, but this is Vegas. Unless you leave the strip, this is what you will pay everywhere. Plus, the Palms is very generous with food comps.

The decor/environment is amusing enough- lots of buddha statues and piped in music that will please fans of ""Enigma.""  I'd actually give that aspect four stars.

Unlike many of the reviewers below, I found the service to be attentive to the point of over-attentive, which is not typically a problem int the greater so cal area- props to that server.

I find it fairly astonishing that some reviewers singled out the prices as being ""too high.""  Whatever you want to say about Little Buddha, I just can't say that ""over priced"" is one of the valid criticisms.  Prices were in line with a typical big city sushi restaurants.  The menu, which combines your standard sushi fare with a collection of chinese food, some thai and some typical european mains (steak. fish) with asian preparation)  might be a little pricey on the chinese side ($20 for mongolian beef), but hell- it's VEGAS!  You want cheap? Go to the buffet.

The pacing of our meal was way subpar- we ordered an appetizer, salads, sushi and desert and were ""done"" in under an hour.  Personally, when I'm dining on vacation i want a little more time- this wasn't a business lunch.  The pacing gets ""one star.""

As for the sushi itself- I'm not sure how ANYONE could call this the best sushi they've ever have, unless, of course, they're from someplace where they don't have good sushi anywhere.  I would call the sushi here ""average"".  The jalapeno/yellowtail sashimi dish we had was not spicy at all, in fact it might have well just been called regular old yellowtail sashimi for all the spice the preparation added to the experience.

Didn't try the chinese food or the more european mains, but the diners on either side were chowing down and I didn't overhear any complaints.

Apparently this restaurant is big in Paris, but frankly, I find that impossible to credit.  I think the reviewer below who compared this place to ""PF Chang's with a better cocktail menu"" is in the ballpark, but the sushi is something you can't get at PF Changs.  You can, however, get sushi like this in any mid size to large city in the contiential united states.",dLuNvprTH04p6ZNCyjIq9g,2,0,3,HAsuhzULVf6V9tINAnD-xA

The atmosphere was a mixture of clubby, yet serene (because it was empty), but the slow and steady beat of the music was a nice compliment to the overall décor.  It actually reminded me of an upscale PF Changs...(prices were a bit higher too).

The wait team delivered excellent service and offered many suggestions for us to try.  I would recommend the King's Roll sushi and the calamari.

Because they are notorious for changing their menus often, I am not certain what we had that evening is still available when you go.

I sipped on their Choya Umeshu...a famous and exquisite plum wine. It went down a treat, with the sashimi and maki.  We had the Peking duck, the tiger shrimp and the san choi bow.

There is no Zen at this Buddha dump. Our party of 18 was told to wait in the tiny bar area - where one bartender took 30 minutes to splash together a very mediocre drink. ONE Bartender on Sat Night .... uh oh! 

Then the bait and switch began. Our ""table for 18"" was nothing more than two table seated near each other - just far enough to hear nothing, see little, and be charged a lot. 

After endless discussions, we were forced to order off a set menu - evidently a table of 8 was much too complex for their kitchen to handle. 

Rather than sending over the appetizers and getting things moving, the manager managed to offend the entire group, calling us ""liars"" and ""drunks"" - incredible! 

Turns out to be an omen that we didn't order - the stink from the sushi on the table next to us was vile, as if they cleaned the buffet and poured the dirty towel juice over rice - YUCK!

The two of us came here tonight right before the Norah Jones concert (separate note: concert was awesome and Corrine Bailey Rae's opening was kinda out of this world). We had to sit at the bar since everyone else there had reservations before the show. Note to self: Forward thinking next time. Pick up a phone and make a reservation. 

The bartender (who also served as our waiter), Jeffrey was amazing...he was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. Once he found out we needed to get to the concert, he worked pronto magic in taking our order, serving our drinks and following up with us. 

Our order today:

Shishito Peppers - For 6 bucks we got about 6 shishito peppers. I know I'm dining in an ""upscale"" restaurant but really??? It's about 2 dollars for 30 peppers at the Korean Store guys. On a more friendly note, all 6 shishito peppers were delicious...crisp, nicely cooked, fresh with the perfect sprinkling of salt

Vegetable Fried Rice - For 8 bucks (in contrast to the Shishito  Peppers), this dish was enough to serve at least 3 people. Lovely, simple rice with a sprinkling of black sesame seeds. Simplicity done tastefully

Mongolian Tofu - This dish is actually Mongolian Beef on the menu but Tofu can be substituted. The Tofu was deep fried and crisp but with a soft center. Just the way I like it. Sauteed with onions, scallions, dried chillies and a Mongolian sweet-spicy sauce this was a very very satisfying meal. It seriously hit the spot. The price of Mongolian Beef on the menu was 22 bucks...I'm not sure if they charged the same for the Tofu or reduced it as I didn't examine the bill (which I have now cleverly thrown away). If it was 22 bucks, it was rather pricey but hey, it tasted amazing

Lychee Martini - I finished this drink, smacking my lips. Congratulations Jeffrey on a well made beverage.

Little Buddha is the Palms version of Tao. I've never really cared for their rolls/sushi. It's all right but since I'm a local, I know I can get better sushi in town for a better price (Mikos maybe). The decor here is very zen, the music is very international and the vibe is just quite interesting. The girls seated next to me at the bar ordered lettuce wraps...now this dish looked like a Picasso painting. I mean, colors all over, vibrant presentation, some fried goodness on the plate. I don't know if they serve this vegetarian but I need to eat something that looks this good. 

Dependable good food, great service and a nice atmosphere makes Little Buddha one of out go-to places when we find ourselves at Palms or in the area.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,3,3,4,36jm3yAdpM_3fdsiVLg8Sg

Don't come here looking for authentic dishes. This place is an asian fusion spot that has many familiar items on its menu. So, if you're craving popular sushi items or Chinese dishes, chances are Little Buddha has them.

The highlight of our meal was the ahi tuna pizza ($15). Beautiful, fresh slices of tuna sashimi topped garlic naan bread. Each bite was a flavor explosion with a salty, citrusy, spicy taste thanks to the abundance of toppings ranging from tomatoes to sriracha to microgreens.

Everything else was pretty average. The jalapeño yellowtail ($20) was bland. The King's roll ($20) with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and rice crackers was decent, but the flavors were all muddled. The chicken chow mein ($20) was incredibly oily (although tasty for my Americanized palate). And, the vegetable fried rice ($8) is something you can get anywhere else for a fraction of the price.

The ambiance is kinda like Tao, but not as grand or over-the-top. We dined there on a Sunday night and, while there were lots of people there, it seemed unusually quiet.

This place isn't bad as long as you're not expecting a world-class meal. Of course it's going to be pricey since it's in one of the more popular casinos. 3 stars, but mainly for the ahi tuna pizza. Otherwise, it's probably closer to 2.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,2,3,QQIMpzSXveGpmUiZMiLsZg

I would definitely recommend this place next time you're looking for a sushi place on a weekday, no wait and good sushi.",taiJeRv3uvHs2vVlOT2M-A,5,4,5,oW1JnXzp0pDtabwe2HR2mA

The chef working at the time first gave my party a special sample of some cucumber salad, which turned out absolutely delicious and hyped me up for the my meal. 

My boyfriend and I ordered chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer, which also ended up very good and addicting. 

Then my Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon came, which looked so good even though I was getting pretty full from the previous foods and the sake. When I tasted it, however, I felt deceived because it tasted plain cheap for being so dry. My boyfriend's roasted duck also tasted sub par, even for Asian fusion foods.

They had the same buddha statues adorned throughout each room, but Little Buddha had two gynormous statues sitting in the back room. 

I wished the lighting wasn't as dim as it was.  We wanted to see all the details of the interior decor. We also ran into some trouble reading the menu. It's all good though. I'm all for doing whatever it takes to set the mood.

I came here with a group of girls, so we ordered an assortment of dishes and shared. We ordered the chinese chicken salad, wok fried chicken lettuce wraps, korabula pork potstickers, spicy salmon & scallop roll, philadelphia roll, little buddha roll, and buddha's house chow mein w/ beef.

The chinese chicken salad was delicious. The salad itself was made with super fresh vegetables. It had the crispyness and freshness. The sauce it came with was drizzled throughout, so it made the salad nice and sweet. It was even good for anti-saladers like myself. I didn't get a piece of the chinese chicken but my friend did mention that it tasted like duck. 

The spicy salmon and scallop roll was what I ordered. Let me tell you, each of the rolls comes with 6 small cut pieces. Their special rolls comes with 8. If you're ordering a roll thinking it will suffice, think again. The pieces are tiny as hell. I should've known when the waiter looked at me with surprise when I said that was all I'd be having. Overall, their rolls weren't all that special. I've had much better at hole-in-the-walls. It wasn't completely dissatisfying, but nothing great.

The beef chow mein came in a pretty decent portion. We were able to divide it 6 ways. The quality of the noodles and the beef were good. Not oily and heavy like what I'm normally use to. Again, nothing special. It's probably because I'm Chinese so I've been exposed to some good chow mein. 

The service was great. No complaints. Our waters were frequently filled, and our waiter came by often but not so much to the point where it was annoying. They have a lot of men walking around that look like beefed up body guards. You can totally tell their top priority is great service. I'm not sure if I'd come again, but the experience was memorable.",yhJ1SVBSjC_R2viEh5AbUA,2,1,3,10iVNv53Z7ZYh6mEQZ1NGg

We ordered the wok-fried calamari and shrimp and the ahi tuna pizza as appetizers, a side of roasted shishito peppers, and the Peking duck and New York strip steak as our entrees.

I've actually never had sake before, and this was a nice introduction to it. We ended the meal with kona coffee creme brulee. Being an avid coffee drinker and a lover of creme brulee, this would have been a perfect dessert for me.

I liked the setting and atmosphere of the restaurant. Overall, the service was good. Although the place was fairly packed, our waiter took the time to explain everything to us and checked on us every once in awhile.

But my girl Megs and I had a lovely time, and in the end I feel that my lighter wallet was totally worth it!

10 minute wait for the beautifully laid out, classy decorated dining room, or immediately at the sushi bar? C'mon........ come on. Although the idea of omakase was tempting at such a lush and revered spot, Megs offered to pass since she was a self-proclaimed noob. Knowing that, we dove into appetizers and a few rolls, with just a smattering of nigiri and of course cocktails!

Megs opted for the Tru Blood martini and I (duh) chose the Lychee Martini. Both were delicious and perfectly complemented our meals. If you must get a starter, I HIGHLY recommend the fillo-wrapped tiger prawns -- the coconut basil sauce it comes with is one of the greatest dipping sauces I've ever encountered, for reals. We rounded the first course out with tempura veggies, and be forewarned -- the tempura sauce is more savory than sweet, which was a nice change IMO. Also -- tempura baby bok choy will change your life.

One of their house specialty rolls comes with marinated lobster on top of a shrimp tempura roll, and that was a favorite with both of us. Megs requested to try the spider roll, and seriously, I've never had soft shell crab that tasty, fresh, and well fried. I also enjoyed their rainbow roll, to which I added an order of yellowtail nigiri for Megs to compare and contrast the common fish types in sushi. Lastly I just HAD to tack on an order of spicy yellowtail/albacore, and that was perfect -- nicely spiced, fresh tasting, and neatly made.

I think that last sentence pretty much sums it up. We had a lovely server that was helpful but not overbearing, and sushi chefs that were kind but left us to our own devices. The restaurant is dark and intimate, but look up on occasion to see some lovely touches of decor. But the best part about this place is just how fresh everything is -- no, it isn't the all you can eat quality that most are used to, natch -- but it's of a much higher and therefore tastier pedigree. The yellowtail melted in our mouths (TM Megs), the rolls hardly required anything else other than efficient chopstick usage, and we still walked out of there full and happy. Yay! I can't afford LB every time I stop by, but it's certainly a once-in-a-while treat to enjoy!",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,4,3,4,0xnAtMlGM8W30OCZsSZU_w

I was pretty excited after reading the reviews, but after visiting, the food was marginal, service average and atmosphere was kind of blah . . . and it was a Saturday night!  

For starters, we chose the calamari and chicken lettuce wraps -- I thought the calamari was very skimpy and a lot more battered than in other places I've ordered it.  The chicken lettuce wraps, on the other hand, were delish!!  I would recommend those!!  For dinner, we ordered the Mongolian Beef which I thought Pei Wei does MUCH better and the Orange Chicken which was pretty good.  My girlfriend loves orange chicken and says it was very average . . . . it's not something I usually order, so I'll go with her assessment on that one.  

I'll have to say though . . . they do martinis well -- I did have the lychee martini and my girlfriend had some peach martini and we did enjoy those thoroughly!!

All in all, a worthwhile stop if you're in the Palms, but I wouldn't go out of my way for the Little Buddha.  Aside from the margaritas, Pei Wei is much better.  And that's sad as its twice the price at Little Buddha!!",evS0cCehNU_EiDiD3286Jw,0,0,3,I3OAAS3eVSv-Kr8iPHjt-Q

We wanted to have a nice dinner without driving anywhere, but didn't want to shell out for a diamond fancy restaurant. Made reservations Thursday afternoon for Friday evening at 5:30.

Last summer, the guy and I had one of our favorite meals ever at Little Buddha in Vienna, Austria. 

Thinking that the Little Buddha in Las Vegas would be the same, we decided to try it out. 

We made reservations for 10 P.M. They didn't have our table ready, so we didn't get seated until about 10:20 P.M. No big deal really, the staff was friendly and seated us as soon as they could. 

For dinner, we decided we would order a few appetizers and share an entree. 

To start, we ordered the seafood dumplings, kobe beef tataki, and spicy scallop and salmon roll. The sushi was definitely nothing exciting - it was definitely my least favorite item of the night. The kobe beef tataki needed more flavor and wasn't as tender as I thought it should have been. The best of the bunch - the seafood dumplings - tasted good, but they had an overly pungent smell.

For our main entree, we had the miso black cod; I remember this as being the most delicious thing I had eaten in Vienna. The version made by Little Buddha at The Palms was severely lacking in flavor and didn't measure up to my expectations. 

It was during the main course when a fight broke out at the table behind ours. Some guy punched his friend in the face, and an all-out brawl broke out. We had to abandon our table to get out of the way! 

Let's just say that the sound of a fist hitting someone in the face made me lose my appetite. The staff seemed concerned about the other patrons in the restaurant, so I think they handled things relatively well, considering the circumstances.

I think it all comes down to preference-- this is not the place for people looking for extensive cuts of Toro sushi or quail egg shooters or some of the kimshi style exotic foods.  Now that we got that out of the way,  this place rocks-- literally!

Have you ever grooved out to the Buddha Bar CD collection-- the standard of ambient house/world music/electronica. (ok, I have a few of these).  The original Buddha Bar in Paris has branched out and now has an offspring in Las Vegas- continues the very chic, upscale theme of the original.  Not that I would go to a restaurant solely on the decor-- the food has to stand on its own.

Our table of four ordered a spicy salmon/tuna/shrimp appetizer-- each was ground into a paste that we scooped up with belgian endive-- almost like those appetizer spoons on trays-- very yummy and creative.

For the main course, we ordered the standard fare-- catapiller rolls, rainbow rolls, toro sushi, yellowtail sushi, etc.  The fish was very fresh and the spicy sauce was substantially better than most places that squirt some red stuff from a bottle.  We finished with a Buddha bar speciality- a roll that mixed yellowfin, shrimp, and scallops without any rice.

Something about the entrance nestled between Gardunos Mexican and the Rain nightclub makes it seem like an afterthought.

That's too bad, because behind the heavy doors is an amazing space--a sunken circular room that transports you to a lost world of exotic Asian opulence, dominated by black lacquer, firey reds and golden Buddha statues. While upbeat mood music stirs the soul, you practically expect a silk-robed sage with sharpened fingernails and a Manchurian mustache to approach you with an opium pipe. To the rear is a lavish bar with bolstered stools one could spend hours upon; beyond is a more modern room dominated by a dramatic sushi bar. 

Like TAO across town, the connection of a decadent den to Buddhism is lost on me--but this is Vegas, overthinking is distinctly discouraged.

The creative cocktails aren't all that impressive, but they do have a respectable sake selection.

Careful choices from the pan-Asian menu will satisfy you. Steamed seafood dumplings offer a mélange of shrimp and scallop, drizzled with lobster bisque and an eel reduction far from average Dim Sum fare. But the must-have appetizer would be the unlikely sounding big eye tuna pizza, thin slices of deep red fish garnished with heirloom tomatoes, garlic chips and wasabi aioli on a fried flour tortilla. Of the creative sushi offerings,  a jalapeno yellowtail presentation with yuzu and tosazu sauce is as gorgeous to eat as to look at. And for a truly decadent delight, don't miss George's Lobster Roll (named for the Palms Prez): tempura shrimp rolled with avocado and marinated lobster. 

Don't fill up on the intro courses and miss the entrees though--they are some of the strongest offerings. The slow braised Kobe short ribs are so juicy they disintegrate under a fork; delicately broiled Misoyaki black cod, served over a squash puree, and dynamite baked sea scallops are two other strong stand outs.",97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ,0,1,4,-qOjC_4WLGDa1VDGVvY3aQ

The service was very strong.

I started with a bowl of miso soup.  $5.  It was very good.  It had lots of seaweed which gave it a bit of an ocean taste.  I would have liked a little more tofu.

Next I had a platter called the king's roll.  It was made up of rather ordinary things (for a Japanese restaurant) combined in a way I thought was unusual.  The roll was several shrimp tempura.  wrapped around that was rice and seaweed.  then a layer of spicy tuna, finished with a layer of avocado.  It was tasty and interesting but didn't really wow me.  There were 10 slices for $20 bucks.  I think finishing the rolls with avocado just made for too much avocado.  It's pretty rich.",QuZbJquRtbY9O9JrB9NpxQ,6,3,3,SiZYwsuCOGDp2rd7SvLhfw

The only thing we ordered that really stood out to me was the ahi tuna pizza, which i've never seen on any other sushi menus.  It has a teriyaki aioli type of sauce, which creates a harmonious flavor profile with the pizza dough and the ahi tuna sashimi topping.

After looking at the menu for a few minutes, we decided to get three appetizers to split. We tried the Chili Rubbed Beef Satay, Wok Fried Calamari and Shrimp, and Bamboo Steamed Seafood Dumpling.

Oh my god. The shrimp were out of this world. The beef satay had a little bit of spice to it, but it was not overbearing. One of the other guys loved the dumplings so much, he beat me to the last one. Darn. 

As for an entree, I decided to be a little daring and try the Mongolian Beef.  I was a little apprehensive, mainly because I tend to shy away from spicy food. Our host was gushing about it so much, he convinced 3 out of the 4 of us to try it. It came on a HUGE platter, while the dish itself was tossed in vegetables along with a side of white rice (you could also choose brown rice if you were so inclined.)

The beef was perfectly cooked, and the spice was not too overwhelming. I also decided to try a Japanese beer...the name escapes me at the moment. It complemented the beef well and had a distinct flavor that you just cannot find in a bottle of Budweiser or Heineken. Speaking of the bottle, it was huge! I was able to get 1 1/2 16oz glasses out of it, and a nice buzz, as well.

Loved the decor of the place. It seemed like it would be the ideal spot to take a date. Small groups work well here, as the music isn't too loud to prohibit conversation.

Atmosphere.. awesome.. Service, decent. This place definitely feels trendy asian fusion from the moment we walked in. BUT, my #1 most important thing is food, and does the food somewhat justify its cost. 

Cocktails: Quite happy with them, but I've had so many incredible $10+ cocktails in Vegas it's hard to  give them an extra star. We had the godzilla and dragonfly for reference.

Appetizer: Rock shrimp tempura. This is always one of our favorites, but this one had a bit too much mayo. Presentation was cute (in a chinese takeout box), but the one at Shibuya is just tastier. Decent value/size for $15.

Sushi: We requested twice all sushi have no wasabit on it at all. We both hate wasabi. We ended up ordering yellowtail sushi, Toro sushi, and the Palms roll. Yellowtail sushi was awesome as was Toro.. fresh, buttery, not chewy, not fishy! yum! However, Toro did have wasabi on it. The Palms roll wasn't good at all. I know some people go for the no rice thing but to me this thing tasted like a gooey fish ball. We weren't able to finish it .. it just wasn't that good. 

Duck: Very yummy, however it was $30. The rendition of duck at PF Changs is honestly JUST AS GOOD, but about $12. I realize this is the freaking Palms, so I'm not complaining.. just have to point that out.

I'd been to Little Buddah in the past and when wanting to grab a bite to eat at the Palms before a movie, we decided to stop in. I worried immediately because for a Friday night, it was much emptier than I remembered. 

 My concerns were laid to rest with the first dish and every dish that followed made me want them to be busier, because I felt like they deserved it. The sushi and sashimi  tasted fresh and the prices weren't typical of the gauging you find at comparable places in Las Vegas. 

 Two of us were in and out the door for $50+tip and we were satisfied. We ate a comparable meal at a competitor for $125+tip and ended up stopping for more food on the way home. 

 The ambience was pleasant, with the exception of the fact that they put us in the nearly empty back room, but I think that was just the seating rotation. We felt a little cut off and given how empty the place was, it would have been nicer to be in the main dining room. 

 I'm going to have to make it a point to go back often, because I want the place to flourish again. I suspect their location in the Palms is (like with other businesses inside recently) holding them back.",zaC3L_qy28bMLIvnoMng8Q,0,0,4,eoy0IGfAB-5rMeE2lg6pVQ

The Atmosphere
The atmosphere goes for trendy, loud music blaring while you eat, it can be really annoying or actually blend really well depending on what the DJ is spinning. As soon as you walk in it's almost like a giant circle with a sushi bar a little further away and of course a big giant buddha. I actually liked the decor there was something about it that was just the right amount of touch. Good job on that. Not a fan of the bathroom situation though. You have to leave the restaurant and walk through the casino to get to the bathrooms. I'm a people watcher so I don't mind watching the antics involved around the casino especially for those trying to set up shop at  Rain or Moon depending on which bathroom you go to but I can see how it's kind of tedious to go outside of the restaurant to use the bathroom. Ah well, it happens.

The Food
Very very subpar. Actually it's really terrible considering all the other amazing places we have in Vegas. There were a couple of dishes that were actually pretty good but of course being in the Palms was unnecessarily over-priced. I don't mind dropping several hundred on a good meal but not if it's something that I can find somewhere else that is better quality and half the price. But hey I get it, you're paying for the experience and it is in the Palms so it's all good. However, even if it was a local restaurant the food would still be very subpar at best.

The Service
Ahhh saving the best part for last. I want to give this place a C but I also want to give it an F. The hostess was super nice and very cute. Our server couldn't hear a thing we were saying thanks to the music but was nice and kind of attentive. However, the busser or food runner or whatever his title is, was just an utter disgrace to the service industry. What a black-eye to all the hard workers out there. I believe his name was Andre or something like that, white guy bald head from balding, and a very unnecessary attitude. So listen Andre or whatever your name is, if you don't like your position, then quit. If you had a bad day, be a big boy and push it aside there's a reason why they call it the ""service"" industry. You don't have to bend over backwards and provide 5 star service but if there's eight of us and we asked for eight waters there's no need to have an attitude when you bring out six and we ask for two more. There's no need to slam waters down, roll your eyes if someone asks for a fork or throw a temper tantrum like a five year old because YOU brought out the wrong order. And there's no need to continue to mutter things under your breath, at least save it for when you're out of earshot. There weren't any difficult or demanding customers in the party and these aren't difficult things to ask for and seem generally commonplace. I hope you aren't a reflection of the rest of your staff because if so I'd rather be treated poorly at a place with better food.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,2,1,1,T__0N4ueUJ_Uf1S3C9UbKA

I had the saketini which was not overly sweet, and went with the $45 4 course menu. The hot and sour soup was amazing, and I easily could have downed a second bowl! The lettuce wraps were actually small scoops of sushi,  and I'm glad my friend asked about it beforehand as she hates fish. For my third course I went with the 12 pieces of sushi and sashimi. It all tasted fresh, and I enjoyed the salmon and whitefish the most. I chose creme brulee for dessert, and it was wonderfully rich with a hint of coffee flavor. I couldn't even finish half, but it was everything creme brulee should be! 

Our bill for 2 drinks and two $45 four course dinners was $121. Pricey, but not bad for Vegas.",LYDb1-rtaOZiLn7kEU1lew,0,0,4,Ut8d2MlLS6kYokxkBZZvjQ

5841019,2007-10-08,0,9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ,"Went to Vegas for a bachelor party last weekend and was fortunate to eat here. While the non-sushi dishes ranged from ok to very good, the sushi itself was some of the best I've ever had. I didn't look to much at the menu because our attentive waiter suggested we split some dishes and he planned the menu on the spot. We each had about two or three cocktails and walked out satiated for $75/person. In Vegas that's pretty cheap for a meal of that caliber. Would definitely recommend this place, but stick with the sushi/sashimi. The only problem is they don't have outdoor seating.",IHFVljMsPhMc2-lW3UMNuw,0,0,5,SMcinC1X7O3Ea6X5C0eehg

5918914,2011-02-26,0,9WAnQD1nj1j3zLZ7ONtvfQ,"Used my Groupon for a dinner visit recently.  The place wasn't busy when I arrived (7pm on a Wednesday), and aside from 3 other people seated at the sushi bar I was pretty much the only other patron there (until a little later), so the hostesses told me I can sit wherever I feel like.

So I picked the sushi bar, since I was planning to order some rolls and try their toro nigiri.  Ended up ordering the Palm's Roll, George's Lobster Roll, and also the Kobe Beef Tataki.  I thought all of them were decent or good.  The cucumber ""wrapper"" was cut nice and thin, so the sushi chef that prepared it was equipped with a good set of knife skills.  The rolls were all presented in a elegant way, with an orchid as decoration.

I also tried their dessert, Strawberry Mango Shortcake with Yuzu Infused Cream.  It was just okay, not really all that.  In fact for the $9 price tag, I would be better off driving to the Strip and get a dessert crepe from JPP at the Bellagio.

The damage even after the $50 Groupon discount was still close to $50.  So not a cheap meal, but the waitress Rumi was very good at her job of checking up on all of her customers seated at the sushi bar, asking if you needed to order any more items or refilling our beverages.

The decor and ambiance is nice.  I think it would be a cool date place, especially if you plan to go clubbing afterward.  But if you are expecting to chat it up with the sushi chefs like at some of the other sushi bars around town, I don't think this should be a place for you to go to.

And like fellow Yelper Paolo D mentioned in his review synopsis, I too feel that for less money you can get similar quality food and good service at other sushi destinations around Vegas.  Only thing I want to add is that the desserts is not really worth it.  For the price they charge, I expect a real plated dessert.

Decor:  3.5/5  Love the Buddha near the sushi bar.
Price:  2/5  Pricey.  
Food:  3/5  Overall pretty good, but lacking that ""WOW! this is the bestest sushi I ever had"" feeling.  It does look pretty though.
Service: 4/5 Rumi is great, the sushi chefs checks up on you frequently.
Location:  Good for out of town visitors, since it is close to the Strip and all the cabbies know how to get here.

i love the spicy lettuce wraps! it was the bomb. love all that spicyness. the palms roll was very good too. i like that they used cucumbers to wrap the sushi instead of rice. nice crisp and fresh. i also had some complimentary fried rolls of some sort from a coupon since i was staying at the Palms. it was very good too.

service was good. prices were expensive, but worth the money! a lot of people were eating here during 7-8pm, but we got seats still.",Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,2,2,5,wzcdrWuGBkdGednXI9AgaQ

None of the food blew me away, but I was relatively happy with the service and the food. Nothing was spectacularly memorable, but it was pretty solid grub. I tried the kalbi, Kobe, roasted shishito peppers and the diver scallops. I also ordered a roll of some sort, but I can't remember what it was at the moment.

I wouldn't make a special trip to go to this place again but if you're in the area or see a coupon or a restaurant .com offer for this place, it's worth a try.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,1,3,VOcSAg9wTA1CeTvk-HRmyg
