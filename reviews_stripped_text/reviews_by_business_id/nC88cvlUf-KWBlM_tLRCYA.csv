The music they were playing last Sunday was repetitive (internet radio) which isn't such a big deal. The norm is if you want something to drink you have to go to the counter. I signed up for a players card and within an hour, they gave me $10 in free play. Machines give bonuses more often. Later on someone did come around a few times to pick up trash and ask if you needed anything to drink. I will be back.",s0wOwU_bkxfTMW2oFnM_tQ,1,0,5,npaSF-FsKqBuwewzlx2wqQ

I was then fed up and asked for a refund saying about 20 minutes with no drinks or food that's bullshit. I told her her costumer service was poor I came to have a good time spend money play eat and drink and she just bugged us and gave no food drinks or service she then began to tell me she's great and makes tons of money I will not be returning I'd usually go 4 times a week I will not return and I will let anyone I know who goes there to not stop going cause the business is fine just don't tip this rude ***** she deserves her minimum wage only since she ""makes tons of money""",FFkzpFzQPxz774ZLd18iMw,0,0,1,PSzXR5C3dpb-7geSgsaw9g

You get better customer service and you win more with bonus that runs throughout the day and special bonuses that you get when earn a certain amount of points in a visit.,HAx6BZefc86jPtbgivE1sA,0,0,5,jJTK8Y4epn61l3SYfpvipg
