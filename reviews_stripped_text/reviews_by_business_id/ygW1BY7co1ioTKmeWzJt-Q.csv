1010768,2011-07-23,0,ygW1BY7co1ioTKmeWzJt-Q,Absolutely horrible. The food is frozen and warmed to order and there just isn't anything that tastes fresh. Avoid at all costs.,i1DLF75XQ221QE-zPDFlng,0,0,2,x31M7BTxIRssDtJ9_GHO_A

I have been here countless times and have yet to be disappointed.  One yelper mentioned that it TB and Del Taco paled in comparison, man was she right on the money!  I love the rolled tacos, all that guac and under 3 bucks; *drools*  The staff is friendly who takes your order and the environment is lax.  I have heard that the food is different depending on which Roberto's you go to, so I'm only speaking for this location.  Come one, come all - you have to check this place out!  Oh, and need I mention, Roberto's = drunk munchies haven!!!",aF0x_jysPRIkR9O-qq8xuw,0,0,5,XsVKDjvEun4-sX2yN5i00w

SUPER CARNE ASADA NACHOS! (no beans)

They definitely do not hold back on the carne asada, which is always good!  The melted cheese (so greasy), sour cream, and pico de gallo create such a perfect harmony with the meat and the crunchy chips.

I just used ""perfect harmony"" while describing nachos.  I need help.

Just try to ignore the massive amounts of grease towards the bottom of the plate.  It'll make you feel really bad about what you just ate.",Ih2jdDfK4EnWNi188V0Jfw,3,3,4,ekFQk6fzSjMy2lhvX5diFQ
