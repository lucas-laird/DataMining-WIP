1642671,2012-06-03,0,YMoOYH8hQG5lxUUkh1uusQ,"Little pizza place in the Venetian between the entrance
to the elevators to the hotel rooms and the walkway to the
main check-in desk. I ended up getting a quick bite to eat
here because it was very convenient. It's still Vegas prices 
but at least it was never too crowded. Also, free wi-fi here. 
I had to do some work on my trip (yeah - even in Vegas) and 
there is one table here that actually has an electrical outlet 
right next to it so you can hang out for a while and plug in 
a laptop if need be. The wi-fi connection here was actually 
pretty good and I could connect to my employer's VPN without 
much of a problem. I would even say it was better than the 
connection in my room which they actually charge for. 
   So I got breakfast here - eggs, sausage, french toast for 
a reasonable price. Also lunch - usually several Sicilian pizza
slices and a drink. Decent pizzas - not the best I ever had but
definitely hit the spot. You can charge it to your room (if you're
staying at the Venetian) so that's a plus. Also, if you face the 
casino while sitting at the tables it's great for people-watching.",0d7gFJUi4cV3I7j1dHn9fQ,1,0,3,s8tYJL7wreq1J3t7vjmLyQ
2506328,2015-12-06,1,YMoOYH8hQG5lxUUkh1uusQ,"I wanted a quick lunch and headed over to one of my favorite, Noodle Asia, but I knew I wasn't eating there since the line was a mile long.  So , I sighed and headed over to the food court on the same level as the Venetian Casino.  I don't expect much from a counter service place, but I noted while standing in line and evaluating the foods displayed in the glass counter, I thought, this is going to be better than a typical walk up counter place.  While not the greatest place to have Italian, especially in Vegas and especially inside the Venetian, the meal was better than adequate.  If you're looking for a quick fix, then this place will meet your expectations.",7dnh9OrD8LekBwvachGH5Q,0,1,3,973D2HNZ-lxDL-nbTOYpsg

Pizzeria de Enzo was the only place in the Venetian Vicinity to grab food for a quick bite.  I got an open face spinach and onion crostini for $6 just to get something to eat.  It was mediocre, but I did not have high expectations.  They get credit for being convenient, especially because its open 24 hrs.",Ud8tcgnxp0w0qBtXt_DKOg,0,0,3,L_5jIkf_mo4wWuUlMIEdkw

3467441,2017-11-25,1,YMoOYH8hQG5lxUUkh1uusQ,"Horribly rude Italian Granma running the counter.  She wanted to give me a lesson on proper Italian pronunciations.  If I gave a rats ass how to speak Italian, I would take a class!  A simple order that would normally take 2 minutes took 10.  I almost left at that point and wish that I would have.  The mystery meat lasagna was mushy and the flavor off.  I was dumb enough to eat it though as I was very hungry and in the middle of a poker tournament. Definitely regretted it the next day as I was quite ill.  I will never eat there again, and I visit the Venetian regularly.  I can't believe the Venetian allows this place to do business in such a great casino.",txzbW9iQpglAhMinCkwD5g,0,0,1,SGk4CPI__A3Mmxq_kzKixw
3687726,2012-12-24,0,YMoOYH8hQG5lxUUkh1uusQ,"Great place to get pizza in the Venetian.  It's located just around the corner from the main lobby.  Pizza slices are New York style - thin crust, but huge slice.  Single topping is about $5 per slice.

At first, it seems like a let down because you think you are going to get a slice of pizza that has been sitting under the heat lamp all day.  But once you order, they pull a piece out and heat it up in the pizza oven for a few minutes.

Good service and good quality, I would eat there again.",vQAM8ZNOl9mzScxdwSd1DA,0,0,4,u6mPhQlhwFYxTghgh-oz3w

The people at the pizza told me I had to pay and I said I paid with the girl up front and they continued to argue with me and told me I can't have pepperoni and sausage that I paid for cause I didn't pay yet and I told them I paid more than once and looked st the girl and she said I paid and they still argued, so I just took a pepperoni and left. But!

I ordered spaghetti. I LOVE spaghetti. Even cheap food court spaghetti. But the spaghetti here was not satisfying at all. The sauce was practically flavorless and was too diluted - not the slightest bit chunky at all. I ended up only eating half of it and tossing the rest. And I only ate that much of it because I was STARVING and needed something in my stomach before heading out for the night.

One plus - you get a side with your order. I opted for the Caesar salad, which was decent. You can't really mess that up too bad can you?

Vegas prices, so expect to shell out a few more bucks for something you would normally get for cheaper elsewhere.

Maybe I should have just been safe and gone with the pizza.",JUfeYfJ6XtZAWxCpC1Zw0Q,1,1,1,q9ulwlcXf0UxaXJEN_hlCA

4451517,2012-02-21,0,YMoOYH8hQG5lxUUkh1uusQ,"If you're in The Venetian and you need a quick bite, the pizza here just may be right up your alley. It's located right off the main casino floor, near the front registration desk. It's nestled in a small food court.

Th slices are pricey, will likely run you $5+ (more money if you add toppings or get specialty slices). The day I was there I had 2 slices: mushroom and pepperoni and a two cheese/basil combo. Both were thin and were heated up in their oven. Overall I enjoyed them, but for $12.97 - man, they better have tasted good!

Comparable to Secret Pizza @ Cosmo, but definitely lacking. The tastes are about the same, with Secret PIzza winning by a hair. However, Secret Pizza's prices are obviously much more friendly than this little pizzeria. 

And for those not interested in pizza, they do serve other Italian dishes, which appeared to me to look dissatisfying to say the least.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,3,oOHSSSlCruVhyhZuHvnxWg

Garlic knots and pizza by the slice at 3am? Tooooooo clutch. TOO CLUTCH. Knots were great and crust of the pizza was delicious.

Came back when I was sober on another Vegas trip and the knots were just as good, crust of the pizza though was eh.
