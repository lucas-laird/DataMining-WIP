I ordered it to go so I did not realize the error until I got back to my hotel room.  The pastrami sandwich was huge, but aside from the generous portion, it was not that great.  Just ok.  It came with coleslaw and a pickle.  I actually enjoyed the coleslaw and pickle more than the sandwich, if that tells you anything.  Probably would not go back.  It's not cheap.

There's really nothing wrong with the people that work there. The issue is that there is one cash register and one person taking your order.

As a matzoh ball soup fanatic, I was super stoked to see they offered it.  It wasn't the best I've had, it had very few vegetables in it, but I'd order it again in a pinch.  I also had a decent egg salad sandwich on egg bagel.  

But, what I will definitely order next time is one of their INSANE looking desserts.  I think I may have drooled while checking out the selection.  Apple tarts, cheesecakes, strawberry shortcake -- they had all my favorites.

Overall, it's a bit expensive for deli (but, it is in a casino).  If you're looking for better deli food, go to Weiss or Bagel Cafe.  However, if you just want a decent lunch on the Strip, this is a good spot.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,3,1,3,gCRwl42RibjExt1tCqYqJw

Where do I even start?

My stepbrother ordered a slice of pizza and chicken fingers and a cheese hot dog for his girlfriend, I ordered an egg salad sandwich w/potato salad and a chili cheese dog.

$36...we told them we were new, hoping we would be offered a soda while we waited but no such luck, oh well.   

1. The Pizza was horrible, we all 3 had a taste.

2. The chicken fingers were super crispy, almost over done but if you like it like that then they would be good to you.

3. The cheese dog has a little shredded cheese sprinkled on and not even melted...

4. The chili cheese dog was DRY, I am used to wet chili, soaking through to the bread and this was not that.

5. The egg salad...well, it had green peppers in it and I didnt know that, I was more than willing to dig them out though until I was digging and found a black hair and that was the end of that.

The Potato chips were good though, I would buy a bag of lays chips again and I strongly suggest you try those too and avoid the others items I mentioned.",tbivfqTrnwTp7mSKSz1j0g,1,0,1,FKwNOSEKtOOodHzCaytBkQ

You place your order at the counter.  When the food is ready they call your number and you carry it to a small  area of tables just off of the Sportsbook. Not exactly romantic dining, but this is a small Deli in a casino. Being in the mood for something really decadent, my wife and I decided to share a pastrami reuben sandwich on rye. It came with a side of french fries. The sandwich was huge. Even sharing, it was a lot to eat. The pastrami was delicious and the Reuben was extremely well made. And the fries were also quite good. They were coated with something that enhanced the flavor. The biggest negative was the price. $13 for Reuben sandwich without table-service seemed to be a little steep ( about the same price I would expect to pay at a deli that has sit down table service).",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,0,4,yTEhVj7xO1sjFplsn_R4Cw

Chicken salad sandwich on wheat with fries, the chicken salad is simple... Really simple but it's good and to the point and a huge portion as is everything at this place. 
Matzo ball soup, they keep the matzo ball separate and not sitting in the soup so it's never soggy but isn't dry either. They use the same base for their chicken noodle soup and their matzo so if u like one the other is good too. Bagels are always fresh and their half soup half sandwich choices are always filling. The other choice is pastrami sandwiches, they shave the hot fresh pastrami and beefs when you order.

I really wanted to try Steak 'n Shake, and decided to pass on Del Mar Deli and wait for S'NS to open. I mentioned this to my good friend Jay F. later that day and he said ""Dude, Del Mar Deli is legit"" and claimed they had the best bagels in Vegas, and better than the beloved Bodo's Bagels from our college days in Charlottesville (UVa). Those are big words and a high recommendation coming from a NJ native. So we agreed that the next morning, when he was taking me to the airport, we would meet at Del Mar Cafe so I could see what all the fuss is about. 

The fuss is well-deserved. I ordered a Bagel and Lox sandwich on an egg bagel (toasted) for breakfast. It seemed a bit pricy at $10, but the sandwich had a generous portion of lox and cream cheese, and the bagel was oh so good. 

Sandwiches here also looked amazing, with nice large portions of meat, and the desserts were HUGE. The tiramisu was the size of your head - literally.

My personal favorite is the Everoast Chicken Sandwich (cold sandwich). The chicken has a ton of flavor, is moist, and the bread at Del Mar Deli is outstanding. They put enough meat on their sandwiches to make an extra sandwich or two. Also make sure they include a pickle. Also a fan of their cheeseburger.

They obliged and charged me double, lol.

I threw the other half away because I couldn't eat the whole thing.

This place is just a necessary nightmare when you're staying at South Point.

 I have enjoyed  almost everything I have gotten here. The vegetables can at times lack flavor. They have everything from bagels to omelets to sandwiches and desserts.

4. The eating area and condiments were a duplicate of the Costco set-up, notably the self serve packets, forks, et cetera. And definitely not comfortable but then again that is not what a deli is about.

Review the menu and there's nothing you haven't tried before.  Plain and boring.  But for some odd reason, one of my favorite stops in Vegas.  My guilty pleasure.  If I'm south of the strip and am feeling like feeding, don't be suprised if I stop at valet and tell them I'll only be 10 minutes to pick up something from the deli.  

-Fries:  One of the best.  Never greasy, just right.  Golden brown, just like how mom use to make it. 

-Calamari:  Not sure if this is regular item, but I have gotten it a couple of times. Just okay.

-Whole Chicken w/Swiss on Wheat:  This is what I come here for.  Nothing special, just hits the spot for me and is the portions are healthy.  Try 14oz of chicken meat.  Have it plain and it's low carb and high protein.  

-Corn Beef Sandwich:  Pretty damn good.  All you will taste is corn beef and forget the bread is even there. That's how big the serving is.  

-Pizza:  Never a mistake.  Only a mistake if you are counting the calories. NY Style. 

You have a choice to get the half sandwhich or whole sandwhich. The half sandwhich is really most places full sandwhich.  Keep in mind, a half chicken is about 7 oz of meat.  

Now for their specialty.....the desserts.  You won't see the desserts on the menu, but cannot miss them because they are smack in your face.  In da face!!! I have tried the carrot cake and the cheesecake.  Each slice is about 6 inches thick.  Not a typo...really big especially for a deli.  One of the best cheesecakes out here.  Yes, I said it.  You can wash their desserts down with the shakes from Steak N Shake (hang a left from this place and a dogleg right, can't miss it).  My only issue...plastic silverware.

Grabbed a couple bites, threw the rest away, and have been feeling sick and bloated for the past 2 days. 

How can this place get good reviews is mesmerizing to me. Sure if u like crap finger food, this place is for you, otherwise, stay away!!",B35E00wmkrovU2OyKNSE7g,1,0,1,1M8ihQWbbClT8-c7mbyC1A
4137836,2011-07-03,0,sUMi2q41l4AzOsmJMRY8zQ,"One of the yummiest Strawberry Shortcake's that I've eaten in a long time. It reminds me (almost) of the yummy LSG cakes back home from Guam. The yellow cake is moist and thick at the same time, the frosting is lightly sweet and all the fresh strawberries that they pack in the cake is Oh sooo goood!!!! 
They sell large slices for around $5.50 but you can also order your own cake for any occasion. I just recently ordered a quarter sheet for a baby shower and everyone loved it. The quarter sheet was $35.00  and a half sheet is $65.00.
I just recently tried a slice of their banana cream cake and to answer your next question- yes it was yummy as well. I would've liked it more though if there were real bananas in the middle of the cake not just on top for a garnish.
I also tried a piece of cheese pizza and that was hellah good also - kinda salty but I'd rather have a tad bit salty than bland!!!!
I have only tried these 3 items but so far so good!!!
Next time I would like to try a slice of the Neopolitan cake & the Chocolate Strawberry Shortcake.....
P.S. I wanted to order a cake again so I called at around 8:00pm and the lady said that the baker had left already but if you call right at 8:00am first thing in the morning the baker would be able to do it and I asked her if she was sure cause I can call elsewhere and she said ""Yeah, just call at 8:00am and I know the baker will do it......Well, I set my alarm and called right at 8:00am and to my disappoinment found out that they do not do same day cakes- what a freakin real bummer....All the employees should get together and have a meeting cause they all have to get on the same page!!!!!!",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,0,0,4,fDv1xv-zq3-cIT_d5A98yA

4540450,2012-02-23,0,sUMi2q41l4AzOsmJMRY8zQ,"This place used to be AWESOME.  It is sad to see a place go down hill.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich and a Lox sandwich to go.  When getting to my destination the corned beef sandwich had a lot less meat on it then it did the last time which in itself was still less then it used to be and the price is higher.  The rye bread is not your traditional rye anymore either, now it is a thicker softer kind of bread almost like a thick sourdiough so they can put less meat on the sandwich and still try to make it look good.  The Lox sandwich was very disappointing.  For the price they charge there should be enough lox to cover the bagel, instead there were only 3 very small pieces.  

This is NOT the place to go for lox and bagel.  You can get a MUCH better lox and bagel for a cheaper price at Einstien bagels or Sunrise Cafe on the East side and they will not try and rip you off.  

I can understand raising your prices because things are more expensive, but to raise the price and lower the quality/quantity of your sandwiches that is just wrong.  Its hard enough to find a good deli in this town and just when you thought you had one, they make changes and it goes down hill. 

This place used to offer a really good Lox Platter and now it is only a sandwich and once you add lettuce, tomatoe, and onion on your bagel, you cannot even taste the lox.  Higher prices, lower quality, equals less customers.  It is sad to have to lower the quaility of my review for this place.  I guess I have to resort to visiting other places which have lower prices and real rye bread, and who are not as stingy with the lox as this place has become.

4655483,2017-02-19,14,sUMi2q41l4AzOsmJMRY8zQ,"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Unfortunately what rarely happens in Vegas, is a restaurant selling delicious New York style bagels that stay in Vegas. The closest that I have come to experiencing a New York style bagel in Las Vegas that tastes like the one I grew up with east of the Hudson River is the Bagel Cafe in Summerlin. I have a favorable opinion of Bagel Cafe. When I have shared my favorable opinion of Bagel Cafe with people, a few told me that they are affiliated with the Del Mar Deli in the South Point. For the past couple of years I had wanted to try Del Mar Deli. This morning, on the way to Red Rock Canyon I would make a detour to the South Point to give it a try. 
  Del Mar Deli is located in the southeast corner of the South Point adjacent to the sports book and a few steps from Seattle's Best. If you park in the parking garage, you will get exercise walking across the casino. That is a good thing because the bagels are large. 

  At the time that I arrived at Del Mar Deli, it was happening. This was at a time there was little action going on at the sports book. This gives me an impression that customers are going out of their way to eat here. When I waited in a line that moved fast, I looked at the sundry of choices on the above blue and white menu boards. My mind was set on a bagel sandwich. If my mind was set on something else there were hot dogs, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and cases of pastries. If I was not set on the bagel I would order a pastry. These are humongous and delicious pastries that include chocolate chip cookies and the very hard to find in Vegas rainbow cookies. The pastries were identical to those of Bagel Cafe. As I waited in line, I glanced at the open kitchen. I failed to notice evidence of bagels being made fresh. This brings up the question, ""Are the bagels made fresh in the Bagel Cafe then delivered here?"" When it came my turn to order, I exchanged nearly $11 for a poppy seed lox bagel. Subsequently I would wait for them to call my number and present me with my food. 

   When I picked up my food, there was another wait on line before enjoying it in the moderate size dimly lit seating area overlooking the sports book area and deli counter. You would think that for $11 in a self serve restaurant that breakfast included coffee. That was not the case. Instead of chancing a couple more dollars on a cup of coffee that could be dumped in the trash, I walked a few steps to one of the remaining Seattle Bests in Vegas. The medium cup of Seattle's Best added $2.40 to the breakfast. With the coffee and lox bagel, I brought it to one of the few vacant tables that faced a wall of pictures above a counter of condiments. 

  The lox sandwich came open. Lying flat the two halves of the poppy seed bagel held lox, tomato, onions, lettuce, and cream cheese. When I put the two halves together to form a sandwich, it was an impressive size. I was impressed by the size of the bagel at the same time that I would have appreciated more slices of lox. The bagel temperature was just right. Complimenting the lox bagel sandwich were half a pickle with Cole slaw. It would take around a half hour to savor the tastes of a New York style poppy seed bagel lox sandwich gradually disappearing from the to go box below. Of course, I would take advantage of the complimentary South Point WiFi to keep up with the news. 

   After dumping the nearly empty plastic plate, I walked across the South Point Casino with some thoughts on Del Mar Deli. Here are the thoughts. With an infinitesimal selection of Las Vegas bagel shops that can compete with a New York bagel shop east of the Hudson River, Del Mar would be my second favorite west of the Colorado River. Regardless how much I love a lox bagel sandwich I am aware that it is a treat to enjoy once in a while. As I wrap up this review I have a different thought to share. Here it is. Unexpectedly, it never dawned on me that this is the place to grab a pastry to go along with Seattle's Best Coffee. The next time if I return to Del Mar Deli, I will try one of the delicious cookies in their display case . My closing thought: 4 Stars!",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,13,4,s07vN_1fYJrDwulpygy8mQ

5120292,2015-12-26,2,sUMi2q41l4AzOsmJMRY8zQ,"I know I've had food from here before in the past but from what I can remember, someone always ordered and brought it to me when they were at the South Point Casino. I was here twice today, Christmas Day. Twice because I went out with my family to watch Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It was about 9 in the morning and we hadn't had breakfast yet. We picked up our tickets last night and the girl at the ticket counter informed us that Christmas Day is their busiest day of the year, so we had to get there early if we wanted good seats and didn't want to stand in line. Well, I mention it because that's the only reason I would be at the casino at 9 in the morning. It was about 75 more minutes before the movie started so we decided to get some food. Compared to all our other options at this casino at this time, this was our best option. And to be quite honest, I'd choose this place over Coronado Cafe for breakfast and late night eats. 

For breakfast, I ordered the foot long hot dog which is $3.95 and comes with a side of chips. You can add toppings if you like, and what's awesome about this is  that they give you a good amount of it for no additional charge! Which at first I only expected sauerkraut and grilled onions because that's what I heard when I ordered. So it was a nice surprise to find a huge side of sauerkraut, grilled onions and CHEESE on my hot dog. Unless I'm at a specialty hot dog joint, I don't usually see cheese on hot dogs. 

I also tried a bite of the pastrami sandwich (on rye) which had a good portion of pastrami slices. It was tasty. 

They also have a huge selection of self serve, pump style condiments against the wall near the dine in area. Mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, deli mustard, relish, hot sauce and more. I also liked the framed posters of old movies on the wall. 

After the movie, we decided to pick up some food to go. I decided to go with the Corned Beef Rueben. I love Reuben! That is my favorite sandwich at the deli, so I decided to try this one. Compared to others that I've had, the corned beef was thick and flavorful but I wish they grilled the whole sandwich more so the cheese would be a little more melted. Oh, and the menu shows that you can choose from cole slaw, potato salad or chips... but they have no problem substituting fries for your side! Just ask!

Oh and I can't forget the DESSERTS. This is what first caught my eye as I walked up to the deli counter. Even though I'm not eating any desserts I can write about it to satisfy my former sweet tooth. And you can enjoy it for me :).  You should see them in person. My photos don't do them justice. Each cake slice, brownie slice, cheesecake slice, tiramisu, cookies, muffins and almost all their desserts are HUGE. Each dessert is about 4-6 inches wide and about an inch thick. It can serve 2-3 people depending on your appetite for sweets. The only ones that were normal size were the chocolate covered strawberries and cannoli. 

We also ordered the cheesecake with strawberries as well, but I had to hold myself back from trying it, as I'm watching my sugar intake (no diabetes for me.)   :( You don't even know how sad it made me. It's Christmas Day too. I don't know why the dark side was tempting me to try it. I've had great willpower since I've started this no dessert thing. It could be because it's the magical time of the year when there are beautiful sweets galore everywhere....smiling, twinkling, batting their eyelashes saying, ""Eat me. eat me. eat me. Just one bite, Michelle. It won't kill you. Eeeeeeeat meeeee."" 

But The Force was strong in me today. I did not give in to the seduction of the cheesecake. Take that cheesecake!

The saving grace (and reason this is getting any stars) DESSERT!! Their cheesecake slices were huge and very tasty! Check that part out",3UkPgOhbqhAqJfaWkGAvXA,0,1,2,uG5TfiwtOsxtNe3zCEE75g

They serve the same amazing bagels you'll find at the Bagel Cafe in Summerlin, and a selection of the same menu items, including some ridiculously huge and decadent desserts, the best of which are the tiramisu and strawberry shortcake.

But for me, it's all about the bagels. Big, round, soft, crusty bagels teeming with toppings. They're the best in town. Good bagels are hard to find in Vegas, but these could stand up to the competition in New Jersey. I don't give many higher recommendations than that.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,1,5,WKGb56_Bh4Ix40zbQs5j-g

What really made the deli stand out was the amount of insane looking desserts they had, nothing I had seen since my own family's bakeries when I was little.  It all looked fresh and homemade.

My husband and I shared a half corned beef on rye, a small bowl of matzo ball soup, and a piece of strawberry cheesecake.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The corned beef was as good as Carnegie for a fraction of the price.  The matzo ball soup, dare I say, was better than the matzo ball soup from Weiss Deli.  And the cheesecake was new york style, and light, fluffy, with some of the biggest, most fresh strawberries.  

This deli not only blows away all the other casino sports book deli's I have been to but is better than probably most of the other deli's in town.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,1,5,vHU3o68kZwjvcrWUkykRTw

This place is off of the freaking chain. I was here with the radio station I intern at and we ate at this place. I don't know what everything cost and I didn't have a meal but my sister and I split a piece of HUGE caramel topped cheesecake. It was so ridiculously good - probably the best I've ever had in my life. I am a cheesecake connoisseur and I can say that it was handsdown, the best cheesecake ever.

Saw them screw up someone's order today, and they gave him a cheesecake slice. Was more than his sandwich cost, very nice if them.

 Eaten here several times, sandwiches are good as was the slice of pizza. Cheesecake was very good. A little pricey on things but portions are generous.

 Everyone working there has been cool. People tend to take things out in workers in casinos, I've noticed, and this place is no exception, I would imagine even the most enthusiastic employee would get jaded over time.

I've been here about 5 times within the past two weeks strictly for the pastries. First off let me tell you I LOVE black and white cookies and their black and white cookies are amazing, basically a flat yellow cake with chocolate and vanilla frosting. They are soft and fluffy and so very tasty. They have a nice assortment of cookies, cakes, cheesecakes, a recreated hostess cupcake, brownies, and a bunch of other goodies. The other day I stopped by and got a cheese danish and a bagel with cream cheese for my fiancé, we love bagels. The cheese danish was great and again HUGE! The bagel with cream cheese was also very good and fresh. They also have rainbow cookies which I don't think I've ever seen anywhere before but it's more like a small piece of cake layered with chocolate frosting and strawberry jam (may of been raspberry) pistachio cake, strawberry cake and vanilla cake, it was an interesting dessert and very good and soft. I have yet to venture in to their actual food yet but their pastrami looks amazing. They have all kinds of stuff from pizza to matzo ball soup. I plan on trying their chicken wings and pastrami soon, if you are ever inside the south point hotel and casino stop by for some very very reasonably priced sweet treats.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,0,0,5,TE_HSLhCDu9wruZheAS1pw

They charge for everything including buttering your bread. Yeah, even that is extra.
Take a deep breath in line, that'll be another $1.

Good bagels, good bread, good portions, good quality. You can split any meal on the menu.
1000 mile catatonic stares from the people taking your order and they may get it wrong so explain it fully, in detail.

If you want a salad, say the word 'salad' twice or it'll be a sandwich. 
It's a long, frustrating wait to get a wrong order corrected so make sure they are listening when you order, good chance they aren't.

Excellent chili, excellent soups, excellent pastries, excellent sandwiches, it's all good.
Nothing out of a box or can or pre-frozen. This is the real deal.

Honestly, I cannot recommend anything on their menu.  I just like going here because it's a better choice than most other spots at South Point.  The wait isn't too long, and you get a 15% discount if you are a hotel guest using their discount book.  I'll continue to come here whenever we stay at South Point.
