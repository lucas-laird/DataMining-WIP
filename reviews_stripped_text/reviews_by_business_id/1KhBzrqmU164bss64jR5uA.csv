The bar was a load of fun and the drink prices were very good! The free shots were a plus. We had a Halloween themed party at Rick's and we had a ball!

We got to talk to him and get a photo!! I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife had the ribs.

We were pleasantly surprised when the doorman informed the crowd inside the Pawn Shop that Rick was making drinks at his bar. We headed over forgetting bars don't let in ""under 18-ers."" (My son was with us). We were sent out of the bar, but Eddie brought us complimentary sodas and said Rick ""might"" come out for the kids. 

AND HE DID!!! He took a photo with my son and then I snuck in one with them. Not sure if Rick approved of what I did but I'm sure he knows how the ""kids"" get to his shop;-) 

In gratitude for the sodas and the photo-op, we ate downstairs at the BBQ place. Food was highly flavorful and scrumptious! I loved the souvenir cups, the stickers for my son's skateboard, and the mac-and-cheese!! What I loved the MOST, though, at the Pawn Shop and BBQ place was the staff. Every single one of them was outgoing, courteous, and friendly (especially Eddie!). Food prices were what I'd expect it to be: 2 meals with sides and drinks were $40 and don't forget the cup is yours to keep and refillable sodas. 

Glad we went! Thank you Rick for the picture and thank you Eddie for the hospitality!! You made our trip and ya'll mean that much more to us now!!",R4W20gmXAQJ1o83xic3b6Q,2,0,5,4ZC1mczzag5I3C6-CjqSFg

But given the product that they produce It is Well above what they should be charging. I have had better BBQ from Arby's then I got at this place for double the price. Their pulled pork was Bland and tasteless the brisket left a lot to be desired the hot link was okay but the outer casing was difficult to chew digestion swallow and the bread was hard not stale but clearly getting there. The meal itself was under sized and the drinks were outrageously overpriced and I don't mean the alcoholic drinks I mean every drink on the menu even water was overpriced. The venue in which it was served lacked any sense of aesthetic charm the chef was very stingy with the sauce and the person at the counter had no idea what they were doing. I don't know what I expected from this place given who owns it. But I can tell you one thing I will not be returning here and I strongly suggest everybody else do the same because it is not worth it like I said I have gotten better barbecue from Arby's and Applebee's at half the price or less.

2491248,2017-01-27,0,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,"We love trying out new restaurants whenever we go to Vegas, and were in the mood for some BBQ. Rollin' Smoke was nearby, so we decided to try it out.

I will say, before walking in I thought it would be a touristy BBQ joint. It shares the parking lot with the Pawn Stars shop and the building looks a little hipster. 

We were greeted by a guy behind the counter commenting on my t-shirt. He began talking basketball with us and he seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.

Looking at the menu, I could see that this place knew how to do brisket. They had options of chopped, sliced, or burnt ends. I got half sliced and half chopped. The worker went and grabbed the full slab of meat to cut it in front of us.

The sauces included a sweet sauce, which tastes better than it sounds. Unlike other sweet sauces, this one isn't syrupy and cloyingly sweet. Then there's the Arkansauce, which is truly unique, perfectly concocting pepper, tomato, and meat sauces in one.

The chopped brisket was so flavorful and moist we didn't even need sauce at all. But if you choose to, I recommend the sweet sauce. It runs over it nicely and only adds to the amazing quality of meat. 

The sliced brisket is almost as good. It's less fatty, but you'd never guess by how easily your teeth slice through it. Both meat options are reminiscent of genuine Texas brisket in every way.

My only gripe here is the price. It's $16 per 1/2 lb of brisket--so $32 per pound. That's a little steep. I realize it's in Vegas and the meat is fantastic, but I think charging by the pound would be smarter--maybe $25 per pound. For those who don't eat a lot of BBQ, $16 per half pound doesn't seem like much, but it's very far above average. If you get the combo, it's $20 and it comes with a side and a drink. The sides are usually $4 a la carte--so you basically get the drink for free.

For the sides, I highly recommend the mac & cheese. I got the baked sweet potato, which is an extra $2 and not really worth it. 

Each meal also comes with a slice of Texas toast, smartly placed underneath the meat so that it gets nice a soggy (trust me, it's amazing).

I will definitely be back here, but perhaps only order the meat by itself and get a larger portion of the side to share instead of both of us getting a meal (I don't drink soda). 

It's great that Vegas has a quality BBQ spot for locals to get some brisket cooked the right way.",STPMW3_6Uk1CGCStvJkn4A,4,1,5,7NbF992B5KUm8DhFifRAqQ

Waaay OVER priced for the quantity of food that you get and to top it off, the quality is subpar and lacking. 

The bbq sauce is runny and bland. The brisket is dry and flavorless. The hot links are nothing but hot...that is literally all you taste is overpowering heat!

2741649,2015-10-24,12,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,"Finally all you tourists that just gotta check out the pawn shop can have some pretty good barbeque here. Now I dont know how Rick Harrison ended up with his name being included in the title but I can only guess when your barbeque is damn good you tend to gain some notariety. That and you were offered a spot in their new plaza-like setting. I guess its a win-win for both parties.

Now for the food. I gave the original Rollin Smoke location 5 stars. Why? Because its a stone's throw away from Spearmint Rhino! Ok, maybe that shouldnt qualify but hay, making it rain does make one hungry so hoppin on over to RS should be a no brainer. 

Sorry to stray off the main subject there, as a guy, I tend to get easily distracted and strip clubs tend to be one of them. Unlike the original location, this new place does not serve beef ribs at the moment. The beef ribs are mainly the number one reason I go to RS because I havnt had anything like them anywhere. Here it is a limited menu. The prices seem to be marked up as well but that should be expected since they are technically on the strip still. 

What I ended up getting was the 2 meat combo ($19.99) which comes with a side and a drink. Your meat choices are pulled pork, beef hot links, chopped brisket, smoked chicken, or st louis ribs. Your side choices are bbq baked beans, cole slaw, mashed potatos, and mac n cheese. I chose chopped brisket and st louis ribs. As usual both meats were on point. The brisket was a little bit greasy this time around but still good. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone smoke flavored goodness! Mac n cheese was just ok.

Some random useful info: When you order your meats, they will ask you if you want sweet barbeque sauce on it or on the side. They also have a spicy and a really spicy barbeque sauce but you have to ask for it. On the tables they have their standard barbeque sauce. They also have wall outlets everywhere for your convenience so you can charge your phone or laptop. Just like the beef ribs, they told me that they dont have wifi for now as well. There are tables outside. Locals get 20 percent off their order. Hours are 10 am to 10 pm everyday. There is a bar right above where they serve appetizers and alcoholic beverages.

In closing, I dont understand why you would have a limited menu when this location is gonna breed surefire success. I would rather have you not open just yet in order to make it right with a complete menu. You cannot deny the people their beef ribs, outlaw burger, and smoked meatloaf not to mention fried catfish, more sides, and dessert. The marked up prices def will take advantage of you out of towners.

The ridiculous price for this was $28.  I live in Wichita Kansas and a dinner like this would come in at 1/2 this price. Where  I'm from an all you can eat  barbecue buffet would cause $19.50.  Here it's an outrageous $40 for all you can eat in one hour.  Now that you know it's extremely overpriced let's talk about the quality.  The brisket and pulled pork were both extremely dry. The taste was ok but certainly nothing for bragging rights.  The hot link was good.  The sauces were good.  The Arkansauce had a little bit of kick to it.   I preferred the Sweet Mama sauce.  You will need lots of it for the dry meat. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but certainly not addictive.  The service was friendly. The building was what you would expect of a typical barbecue restaurant.  This restaurant would not be in the running for the best in Wichita Kansas.  In fact the price alone for most barbecue restaurants would put this one out of business.,WPL-9R7VIaCX1mPB-qtXdQ,0,0,2,fFfXv3Ue0_XRE2ohF_Mm3w

2877161,2016-04-22,1,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,"This was fantastic! The pulled pork was moist, not full of fat and flavorful.  There were gorgeous  smoke rings on the meat. You received  a  big portion, which I devoured, of the pork. The bbq sauce options were South Carolina Mustard, Eastern  NC vinegar, and a more Kansas City tomato based sauce which comes either spicy or sweet. I opted for the sweet, but my husband chose Eastern NC and we were both happy. There  are great sides available. I had slaw which was slightly  spicy, but still a nice cool counterpoint  to the rich pork. The baked beans were incredible. Unlike  other baked beans, these backed beans had small chunks of meat, not fat, in them. The sauce was redolent  with onions and a thick flavorful  tomato  sauce. The was great looking cornbread, but I did not have any as the potions were so big. There were good-looking  desserts available,  but who had room to eat them?
          The restaurant itself is one in which you place your orders at the counter and then sit on stools and eat at the counters that run throughout the restaurant. I think that there is outdoor seating as well, but we sat inside. The Staff is very knowledgeable , upbeat, friendly and positive that they have the best bbq in town.

   As it was slow the guys running the place told me I would have to go upstairs to the bar to order.  After realizing I had no idea where the bar was they let me order with them.  I got to give them a shout out for being cool about that. 
   I order 3 dinners to take home and the guy ringing me up asked if I was a local and once I told him yes he adds - cool we give locals 20% off!  I ordered two pulled pork and chopped brisket and one chopped brisket and spicy sausage.   I also ordered the chipotle slaw, potato salad and spicy macaroni and cheese.  All were good with the spicy macaroni and cheese being the standout.  It definitely was spicy but not overpowering.  
  Their BBQ is tasty with good smoke flavor.  The pulled pork was my favorite with the spicy sausage being a close second.  I did like the brisket but not a fan of having it chopped up.  Their BBQ sauce is Sweet with a slight tang which I really enjoyed.

Their parking lot has always been small. We got there right before lunch and luckily, the parking lot wasn't as busy as I was able to immediately get a parking space. Love that this restaurant is on the ground floor.

My brother-in-law and I didn't want to eat a whole lot, although the All You Can Eat at $40/person was appealing. We opted for the Brisket Sandwich combo which also comes with mac n' cheese, pork and beans and a drink. Total price, $25. Glad we were sharing because that is a pricey. Luckily, the drink cup was the souvenir drink cup which is normally $5. We liked the brisket sandwich. I poured the pork and beans over the mac n' cheese and that was great.

The restaurant workflow makes sense. You walk in, you stand in line at the counter and give the server your order, followed by the cashier, fountain drinks and utensils. The entire restaurant is ""pub"" seating, either window seats or shared large eating counter.  Between every couple of seats are napkin dispensers along with different sauces you can try, including Sweet and Arkansas. Everything made sense, everything was clean.

I would love to have seen some different types of food done BBQ style or new concoctions made with random types of food. Or I don't know maybe I'm crazy and I never knew I just don't like BBQ food. Either way, the atmosphere is really fun, the people that work there are really really awesome, but between myself and friends, none of us liked our food and definitely wouldn't recommend it. Maybe come for drinks and a good hangout spot but either skip the food or be very very clear that you don't want anything to have any kind of spice in it and see if they have anything off the menu that's not sooooo overdone traditional BBQ.",XcYOTqbY3Yr678gwWaHTJw,1,0,3,XLNxop1hKq8AJy9nsYcLPg

I actually pawned a ring once that a woman sent to me while I was on 'Jerry Springer.' It was really gaudy."" Steve Wilkos

Personally I kinda wish I could pawn the flavor left on my taste buds.

Let me start off by saying that I have had food from the original location of Rollin Smoke BBQ and that was was pretty special. You would think the food at this location would be just as special.

My younger daughter, here's a surprise she wanted to eat mac n cheese. My wife took a bite of the mac n cheese. For a side dish that cost $8.00 she, my wife, said it tasted like it came from a can. My daughter at the age of seven was not impressed as well.


My older daughter, age nine, choose to eat a cheeseburger. The portion size was fine, but she was not to favorable for it's taste. I took a bite and thought I was taking a bite from a meatloaf sandwich. 

Myself I ordered BBQ Taco for $12.00. My meal came with a side dish of cole slaw. I also ordered some baked beans. I liked my side dishes more than I liked my tacos.

Service was nice, the establishment inside was very clean. Then again it was only 11:30am.  Located in a brand new shopping area right next to the shop made famous on the television show Pawn Stars. 

I love the food from the other location, but here, and with Rick's name on it, something was missing. My wife and I agree, we didn't get the bang for our buck. I do feel like we payed for the name along with the location, and not so much the food.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,5,0,2,N4-vCAI38d2VCzIqH4ywTg

3814807,2018-06-11,6,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,"2 stars for a solid BBQ joint with one glaring problem.

After checking out the famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop from the television show ""Pawn Stars,"" we headed next door to the BBQ shop owned by show's star, Rick. The joint, called Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern, is a 2-story venue with what looked like a take out area on the bottom level and a bar and outdoor area on the top level. The venue's style as a BBQ joint is well executed and made this Kansas City boy feel like he was back in the Midwest.

We sat down at a table and a bartender came over to say hello and bring us menus. She also let us know that Rick himself would be bartending tonight, so we were free to stick around to see him or come back and see would make sure we be able to get a drink from him. I appreciated that she was very friendly and overall provided good service. 

After looking over the rather extensive menu (including a good sized beer list), my wife and I decided to get a couple beers and some sliders. While our dinner reservations kept us from ordering more, both the beers and sliders we received were rather solid. The venue, service and food all corresponded with the venue's 4 star status. 

What is unfortunate is that, while the venue's food and experience merit 4 star reviews (and would have gotten one from me), it takes the extremely inappropriate step of manipulating its rating. It does this with a little sign on the table, listed in the picture below, offering a free PBR or mystery shot in exchange for being willing to ""Yelp us out."" Since the sign instructed me to ask the server for details, I asked the server and she told me that we would only receive the free drinks in exchange for a good review! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! This is an absolutely despicable policy that hurts Yelp (posting of inauthentic reviews), insults Yelpers who look to provide honest input and the venue itself because it is less likely to receive constructive criticism that would help it improve. It is one thing to encourage people to write a review for a drink (a little shady in its own right since people would most likely avoid criticizing the venue since it could jeopardize receiving their free drink, but outweighed by the benefit of getting people to write reviews), but offering free drinks for a review AND requiring the reviews to be good crosses the line. The saddest part about this is that the venue would almost assuredly get good reviews and repeat business based on its merits, but this policy is so harmful and insulting that I refuse to go back to this location and recommend everyone avoid it until the policy is eliminated or at the very least reworked to remove the positive review requirement. While the official policy may not involve the positive review requirement, the servers would need to be instructed that this isn't a requirement and the sign updated to reflect that the content of the review wouldn't impact receiving the drink.

Overall, Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern is a solid BBQ location with a great atmosphere and menu full of good options. Unfortunately, the abhorrent Yelp policy makes this a place a must avoid for any self-respecting Yelper.",yBpajT9TpzIpLtINu3Xl0w,20,11,2,eJ04IL2o_QVNOd7y06G8Vw

As we made our way to his bar, we were exited to see him, but as we got closer to him he didn't seem too thrilled about the customers in his establishment. All we wanted was a picture with him. He had to ask his bodyguard to see if it was ok. As Rick chain puffed on his cigarette, we ordered a drink and chatted thinking he might stroll by and check on his customers, NOPE.

Hot links tasted and had the texture of processed gas station pepperoni sticks.  Spare ribs were just okay, I've had better at Memphis or even Lucille's. As for the sides, the coleslaw was my favorite, was not heavily dressed and had a bit of kick because of the chipotle. Dirty rice was a bit too salty, and the collared greens, were just okay.

What's different here than most BBQ joints is that they let you sample something if you're on the fence about it. I'm always on the hunt for a good pork or beef rib so luckily they didn't have to help me too much with my lunch decision, 

I must say, they are definitely doing something right with their St. Louis ribs! The succulent meat just falls right off the bone. I'm so glad I went with the half rack because three (3) ribs would have not sufficed. At the ordering counter they drizzle a bit of the Arkansauce on top but  they have three different sauces on the tables/ bar stool area that are great on the ribs as well if you want extra flavor. 

Sides: Smoked Mac & Cheese, ALL DAY, ERRRDAY! 
The Mac & Cheese here has a slight dark yellow color to it but don't be alarmed, it's not spicy, it's smoked! Perhaps they add the Arkansauce to it as well but trust me, this is absolutely cheesy goodness. It's rich in cheesy flavors and it pairs excellent with any BBQ of your choice.

And after we're done we go accross the street and have a couple beers upstairs at Ricks. The drafts are $7 and he's got a great selection - I quaffed down a couple of the Rogue Dead Guy Ales and the wifey had the Hop Nuts Porter. We also had split a rack of huge baby back ribs which were pretty good considering we're from Kansas City (home of the best BBQ ribs in the world). Rick's also has some cool stuff from the shop on the wall and the breeze coming in on the top deck makes it a comfortable place to have a drink.

We had gone earlier in the day and had an awesome bloody mary and couldn't wait to come back for dinner. The place was packed because Rick was there ""bartending"".  Cleared out pretty quickly...probably because their MC (Antwaun??) was obnoxious, showing everyone the gun he was carrying, making sure everyone knew he was a self proclaimed badass and dropping an excessive amount of F Bombs...buy this poor guy a thesaurus! So not classy.  Honestly thought Rick had more class than this. Funny for a minute, got old quickly.  So  disappointed...would not recommend.

Evidently quite a lot because it's freaking awesome.
I've eaten BBQ in every BBQ state. North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, you name it it I've had it. I consider myself well acquainted with the subject.
Surprised and very satisfied with this BBQ 
We ordered the Pit Special, chopped brisket, beef hot links, ribs, chicken and pulled pork.
I generally don't care for chopping brisket but it was still very good. The pulled pork was excellent, some of the best I've ever had. The ribs phenomenal, beef hot links are super tasty and a nice little heat and spice. If I had one issue, The chicken was a little dry.
The sides are great too. Smoked Mac and cheese, da bomb. The baked beans are great.

It's owned by Rick Harrison, one of the owners of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop across the parking lot and star of the tv show Pawn Stars.  We learned Rick was going to be bartending one night while we were in Vegas so we headed to the bar hoping to meet him (and get a book signed).  We saw him (and his bodyguard) head up the stairs to the bar right on time at 8pm.  We headed up afterward and found a seat at the bar.  There's also a few tables around the bar and outside on a veranda - but it's a pretty small establishment.  Rick was behind the bar pouring himself shots!  He looked a little nervous and out of his element, which I found endearing.  He made conversation with people at the bar and when I asked him for Long Island Ice Teas - he deferred to the real bartender, lol!  Our drinks were strong, no joke!  I did see him pouring some beers for other customers though.  One of the servers walked around with merchandise like hats and shirts which Rick would sign if you bought.  He did come over and sign the book but after we were there for about 30 minutes, it started to get pretty packed and he was being approached for photos and the like.  We accomplished what we came for so we relinquished our bar seats and headed to our next stop.  I did see some baked potatoes being served that were giant and completely legit!

The ribs are better than the brisket, which is better than the pulled pork, but that doesn't mean any of it is good. It's kind of Texas style, except for that they use green onions and there's no jalapeño. The mac and slaw are okay, but neither is quite southern (and who put corn in my slaw?)

Started at poutine place downstairs but wasn't interested in sitting outside and wanted a bar to go with my gravy smothered fries. Turns out the place is totally cooperative- guy at poutine place told us it was fine to take his food upstairs to the BBQ place/bar. 
 The place was totally dead in a way that plagues any outdoor mall on a cold Vegas night. We were the only bar patrons aside from the security guy from the pawn shop. This afforded us a private (pretty much) bartender who was super chatty and personable and told us that locals get 20% off (hello!). He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer. 
 Things to consider- BBQ was good and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't smothered in sauce, one of rare times where brisket outdid the rib tips in flavor. Awesome brisket, great job, guys, usually brisket falls short when compared to rib tips because fat is delicious. This is the only time I have been to a BBQ spot where brisket was as delicate and flavorful as this. That said, rib tips reminded me of a pot roast. I truly think it's because meat wasn't very fatty- quality- just a bit off from what I'm used to with rib tips. 
 Beer- it's almost impossible to find a bar that has s good selection of hef on tap that isn't fruit/vanilla flavored. For the love of God, hef lovers like me just want a plain delicious full bodied hef that doesn't taste like a syrup. 
 Lastly- it wasn't a whole lot of food for $20. Don't come in here expecting to fill up and then some.  It's good, it's pretty cool, just isn't the best value.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,6,4,4,3d_rcyyzyxpUF97px2Rf5w

5646533,2016-01-14,1,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,I am from Memphis Tenn and I love my barbecue. This place was fantastic!!! After the nice man in the kitchen suggested the Mac and cheese I turned it down but I taste my husbands and quickly decided I better get my own. This is a great place the staff is extra friendly. I will definitely be back more than likely before I leave.,S7M1tQYVm4PRWFqcC42lzg,1,1,5,VWPmlbVqoft-jw82C6RYqQ

5712908,2017-11-05,0,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,"Went into the barbecue restaurant on the first floor for dinner. Had the platter that included smoked chicken, brisket (ordered it sliced), ribs, hot links and three sides.  The portions were large as was the price: $35.00, but I wanted to sample what they had to offer since barbecue is one of my favorites.  The chicken was OK, but lacked a lot of smoked flavor.  The brisket was juicy and cooked perfectly but had virtually no smoked flavor at all.  The hot likes were just OK.  Probably the best meats were the ribs, although they were far from the best I have had.  The sides, collard greens, cold slaw, and potato salad were about average.  All in all, the barbecue was OK, but pricey.  And $5.00 for a fountain soda? 

 After dinner we went upstairs to the tavern were Rick was tending bar with Antoine from Pawn Stars as the MC.  They also had a DJ in the tavern.  Interestingly enough, the drink prices were better than the food prices.  A nice feature of the tavern was that you could order off the menu of the barbecue restaurant.  The tavern had a nice beer selection, and Rick and Antoine certainly put on a show at the tavern. As it turns out, Antoine can be quite the comedian.

5756337,2017-08-24,0,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,"Had the smoked brisket sandwich and bbq baked beans. The beans were awesome,  the brisket wasn't full of flavor. The bark on the brisket was decent, but the meat didn't have much taste outside the sauce. Those beans tho!!! 

Spent $20 for my meal, which was about par with other single meals I've eaten during the week. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to patronize the business owned by the pawn stars. If that is the case, eat at the old fashioned burgers next door.",USXdUIPEpeqHtGPIikZudA,1,0,3,iJP8v-MkcUgdEJMYwoLViw

5818882,2017-04-08,0,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,The meat was great but the potatoes tasted like instant mashed. They were out of Mac n cheese at 6pm. Service was AWFUL. Getting refills was impossible.,l5yqFfJ2Ebw_Zl4yerkp5g,0,0,3,swe22AKHYQj7v3SuLkdrMA
5926057,2017-07-27,0,1KhBzrqmU164bss64jR5uA,As I walked in there was no one in the place and the woman at the counter was asking personal questions that only an illbred and illiterate person would ask. I told her to mind her manners. The small draft beer is 7 dollars! Total rip off. The food was half way decent. I will never go back or recommend this place.,QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg,1,0,1,UqzKJ51Hg07tWnpxLRjUhQ
