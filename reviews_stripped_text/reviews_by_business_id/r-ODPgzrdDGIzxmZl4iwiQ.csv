188830,2011-11-24,1,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,"Had to poke a little review in here.  If you seen my last JITB review just imagine the complete opposite of that.  Was in the drive thru around 1230 today. The lady asked how my day was and ordered 1 Jr bacon, 1 Jr Bacon plain and 1 breakfast jack. I asked if they still had dollar drinks and the lady apologized that the promotion was over. Had my order read back and pulled up to the window. On the way I decided to add an order of mini cookies I saw on the sign. No problemo. Got my order, the woman gave me 10% off my next order for no reason I could tell and asked if my service was as good as it was my last visit. I told here it was my first visit, but it was awesome and she wished me a happy thanksgiving.  That is like what it should be at the drive through.  

PS  My jr bacon was plain and the cookies were delicous.   THANKS JACK.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,3,0,5,bIe6lFYsk8KJkhvHGC_Gyw
575582,2015-11-15,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,"I wasn't going to post, because I wasn't sure last time, but I know now that there is racist service. On both occasions I waited 15-20 minutes to place my order, while there was staff more than capable of taking it; I've been in the restaurant business for 4 years. Then someone finally takes my order, when they relize I'm not leaving. Then a white person walks in, this time a white female, and they helped them right away, and I looked at the screen, which displayed the same number of drive thru. If your a colored person don't come to this location, unless you have a white friend with you, or are prepaired to wait 1/4-1/3 an hour! Your welcome.",P5-WmTJYIMkEaRSpJmbHDA,0,0,1,4qA9p7PjCQro10HAXp7WvQ
1075529,2017-09-21,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,"I have to say for being a fast food joint, their salads are really fresh!  I've ordered their side salad and their full size salad with grilled chicken and haven't been disappointed yet by their freshness! 

I've tried the salad at a nearby competitor and I've had mixed luck. Some days the red hair girl gives me a decently fresh salad, but most of the times you can see the vegetables are starting to wilt. That's not the case at Jack in the Box. When comparing the side salads you definitely get more from JITB and I prefer their ranch dressing, although the competitor do have baked potatoes. 

I sometimes pair the salad with a value menu item like the chicken sandwich or Jr. Jack. 

This is the place I go to for salads when I want it fast.",OvHYa3jg6ZJceNH1XU772w,0,0,4,Lc6_yiddCwfNaYs2C57KUg
1486719,2015-02-11,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,Came to drive through and the associate name Allen was extremely rude. He took our order with attitude and really did not act like he wanted to be there at all. Management should really evaluate their workers on customer service.,9qRjoGq7lo8eM6q2jtzekg,0,1,1,SNnxaUBj6JSJN3JjJfQa3w
1657747,2017-06-25,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,So annoyed. Went to this jack in the box after 7 hours of moving into a new place. We get our food and it's ice cold. I won't be back to this location EVER. The one on Tropicana always makes the food fresh to order late night and the staff is way more professional. #thisplacesucks,KZL3i6mKCOKSgHLz7IEENQ,0,0,1,QkjQ-AgoblsvURDnIADSNw

However, the service from the drive through employee was great, he was super friendly and my milkshake tastes delicious-- which is why I ranked this review 4 stars.",lwbBX9J19JlQ99pDcT4GZw,0,0,4,d7JgFd9SI05g99wIQQLevQ

I tried to ask for some simply sauces she just kept say what like as if I were trying to ask her for so much more. So she turned around I thought she was putting the sauce in the bag but got home and realized she didn't. On top of that they burnt my food so I didn't even get to eat my food. What a waste of time and money.,1IqmtVe_5wUqeXUz8ITtJw,1,0,1,-yvNFfPs08N0Gdy-57HXUg

3883492,2010-01-28,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,"It's happened to everyone.  You pull away from the drive-through confident the Man in the Window filled your order successfully.  You plop down on the couch, unpack your booty, and alas and alack , twas not meant to be.  For me, this recent experience involved an uninvited switcheroo - seasoned curly fries were ordered, regular fries were delivered (at least I still got some type of fry, right?).  But despite this accident, I'm prepared to give Jack in the Box the benefit of the doubt, as their all-day breakfast options trump the occasional drive-through error seemingly unavoidable in the world of fast food.

In the realm of Vegas fast food, Sonic and Jack in the Box are the only two options for 24-hour drive-through breakfast.  Sonic never leaves me feeling all too great afterward, as their options seem greasier and less satisfying.  Jack in the Box barely beats Sonic on the grease factor, but their collection of egg sandwiches & bowls available anytime and their scores of local locations win out in my book in the battle of the bagged breakfasts.    If the options are driving out of my way for Sonic, or the Jack in the Box around the corner, Jack has my mind made up.

Specifically since I don't order fast food drinks (the food is bad enough, do I really need a sugar-ade to wash it down?) JitB is more convenient and tastier than Sonic, and I'll continue to support them as necessary to satisfy my junk food cravings, despite the occasional miscue.",INBUCYK-dguQKfDWIwug0w,0,0,3,lyKFXr4pNMcleJsRdgawyg

4795720,2016-12-13,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,"I work nights and got off work late. I was tired and physically exhausted. All I wanted was a hot meal and my bed. I had never had Jack in the Box before and given it's the only fast food place really open on my drive home I decided it was time to give it a try. 

I used the drive thru which had about three other cars in it. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich meal and substituted curly fries. I was pleasantly surprised with the quickness of the drive thru as I was to the window in no time. I quickly received my food and was back on the road in no time.

When I got home I dove into my meal. The sandwich was made fresh so the chicken was still steaming hot but extremely tasty. I was excited for the curly fries as I have always been a fan of Arby's curly fries. Well to my surprise these were the same if not better (recommended). After finishing my meal I was pleased with the amount and the price as well as the taste of the products. I wish I had tried it sooner. Really a good place for a quick meal.",1PvDk9-siiBuDSt73Jgi-Q,0,0,4,xZEtklZOoOvU_WB2KJsqSg

 I was the only one there and about the time I started to wonder what took so long she called me up. Not a boy did they make them fresh, hot and crispy with salt melting, she upgraded me to a small for free!
Said thank you for waiting and I looked like I needed to smile.

5695445,2016-09-02,0,r-ODPgzrdDGIzxmZl4iwiQ,"I am giving one star because of Cheyenne, the drive through worker that helped us. 

Worst service ever by the manager. The soda machine wasn't working properly. Scott let them know. The cashier said there was nothing he could do about it. So Scott asked for the manager. She said she would fix it. She came out from the kitchen, piddled around with the machine and went back into the kitchen and back to the grill area. Didn't say if she fixed it, it was broke, nothing. So then I go up and ask for her again. I pointed out she went back into the kitchen and asked if the machine was fixed. She tells me the machine is fixed. When I asked why she didn't let us know, she stated she was the cook and the manager. 

She then returned back to the grill. When Scott asked to speak to her again, this time about her long pony tail flapping around, she refused to come out to speak Scott. 

I'd like to point out that Cheyenne, the drive thru worker, did what the manager should have done: she offered to get a drink from her soda fountain. Easy peasy right there. How hard is that?!?

Needless to say, we won't be returning. Sad really as this one is close to us.",3XteFzrS1vDT_45X1LOuqg,1,0,1,48-KUG0Z_QDV9oLPQvZ8rw
