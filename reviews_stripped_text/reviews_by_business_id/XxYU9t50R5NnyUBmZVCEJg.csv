Being from New Mexico I am well aware how chili should taste and cooked.  It's like they take a tub of the frozen green chili and plop it on your plate with no seasoning. Very disappointed.   I've been there three times giving them the benefit of the doubt and each time more disappointing than the other.  Trying different things thinking it was the cook.  I mentioned it to the server and I was on,y giving attitude.  Did not offer an apology.  The last time I went there I ordered some items to go thinking they could not mess it up.  The beans were so greasy and had so much garlic salt on them I had to throw them away.  It ruined our bbq for sure!   I will not eat there again nor will I recommend it to anyone.

607452,2015-08-07,0,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"4th visit and I am addicted! What a wonderful find so close to where I live. Very impressed especially as they've only opened June 1st (2 months ago).

The decor is comfortable, New Mexican appropriate while remaining upscale and avoiding that kitschy cheap look. Service is thoughtful, attentive and warm. The owners Paul & Amy are truly hospitable. Pricing is incredibly approachable and fair for the filling portions. 

And now the food...delicious! Warm Christmas chips to the table with a mild/medium house made salsa. Pork adovada is fall apart, rich and saucy. Guacamole is bright and green, their take as its not the traditional cilantro, salty laden mix. Posole is thicker and more stew like but nevertheless tasty. Tamales and enchiladas are decent but what makes everything standout is the sauces. The green sauce hasn't been blended so it's chunks of chile and the red sauce is smooth, developed spice without being burn the mouth hot, and quite frankly...addicting!  Sopapillas are airy, fresh and not greasy.  Best fried ice cream as the outside is still warm and extra crispy while the ice cream is *gasp* still cold! 

I'm not from nor have I been to New Mexico. But, I've been enjoying Mexican cuisine for about 20 years, consider myself a motivated foodie, and it's a different, refreshing spin that I highly recommend!",nCpEToOzl8dlzp7EyCl_4A,0,0,5,6oYe5HYYKisUYyewrZ10tQ

I'm not talking about the bland stuff you get at so many Mexican eateries in this town.  There is a huge difference.  From the first bite I was transformed back to Santa Fe, Taos, Albuquerque, etc...  The heat from the red and green chile was amazing, so fresh, so flavorful,  (for the faint of heart there is an option of mild chile).  I had stacked cheese enchiladas with both red and green chile topped with a fried egg (so good), and refried beans and rice.    
My husband had the stuffed chile rellenos which he always loved in New Mexico.  We were both in heaven and oh, the sopas, just so substantial and yet fluffy.  For dessert, we shared the fried ice cream which did not disappoint.

My husband and I went to Chile Addiction for an early dinner yesterday with high hopes.  The food and service surpassed our expectations.  The owner and servers were most gracious and wanting to please.  The ambiance and decor was also a nice surprise.  We couldn't believe we actually found this gem.

792278,2016-09-10,1,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"I made my second visit to Chile Addiction last night and was drawn to the place for this visit due to their Hatch Green Chile Roast event on Sept. 9-11. Their Facebook event page stated and I quote, ""food and drink specials, entertainment and more."" There were no food and drink specials after ""happy hour"" according to the server who quoted the owner and there was no entertainment and what's the ""more"" when there was nothing else going on but people roasting chiles outside that you could purchase! Green chile was already listed as part of the event, so that couldn't be the ""more!"" The server was assisted at times by the owner and even with the 2 of them, service was slow and less than desirable. Food was simple and looked thrown together on the plates. I had a ground beef chimichanga and it was just ok. The pinto beans were bland and not cooked all the way. The rice was ok. We had the nachos and that was a hot mess of unwarmed chips, nacho cheese sauce and lumps of refried beans. I think more than half the plate was left. If it wasn't for the company, this experience would have been a total disaster. I'm not an event planner, but I certainly know when an event was poorly planned. If it was just a 'hey we're roasting and selling chiles' event, then just say so and don't lie and say there's food and drink specials and entertainment just to try and draw people to your restaurant. That's gonna piss people off and that's only half the issue. Then you get people in (and I had several others join on this occasion) and between the disappointing service, food and the lack of truth in the event description then it puts a bad taste in your mouth. I think I'd rather take an 8-hour drive to Albuquerque just to have an authentic dinner. Not sure if the owner was in full charge of this event and the Facebook posting or not, but when I mentioned the post, the server kind of just blew it off. This just means they don't care and that they were probably just trying to attract business. The first time I went to this restaurant, there was maybe 1 table of people also dining and we had the attention of the owner who was our server. I had the Indian Taco and it was good, not amazing and the service was better. Just not sure between what happened now versus what it was like months ago that there's really any need to go back. Oh, and I didn't want to go there, but one person who works there reminded me of 'Magda' from the movie 'Something about Mary!' It's not necessarily the tan that I'm referring to but the nervous, fast-moves, all over the place kind of mannerisms. Not sure if it's got Red Bull or what written all over it. Personally, I think they need to refocus before another restaurant becomes history. I'm not trying to sound mean, be nasty nor do I want them to go away, but without the focus on customers and what you're putting out into the media and on tables, it's only going to go downhill and all that blood, sweat and tears is going to be for nothing.",AyPR1D0je4VoCH1AqagpIg,0,0,2,NWv-ToJ-TBtGODhVgBlTPQ

I had the burger because I LOVE green chile cheeseburgers. 

The Good: meat was flavorful and a good size. Cheese was melts. Bread was better than a regular bun you get when you give up and order a burger at a restaurant. Spicy. 

The Bad: fries were really sad looking, flavorless and undercooked. Guacamole was meh. Salsa tastes like stores bought salsa with a few chopped up chiles thrown in. Beans definitely came from a can.

I would have enjoyed my meal much better if I only ate the burger. It was pretty good. 4.2 out of 5. Everything else was so underwhelming that it dragged my entire experience way down.",a80mZw7Bz3LoaBiHSg83HQ,3,2,2,hli2qyJf7f_zJbLk2OQFIA

Now the ""not-so-goods"" - The food is WAY over the top spicy. I've had New Mexican food before and I loved it. Using various chilies to enhance the flavor of traditional Mexican dishes is a brilliant thing when done well. In the case of Chile Addiction, I don't think the cook knows the difference between flavor and just plain over-spicing. To add to the insult of food so hot that you can no longer taste the other ingredients, when my wife asked our server how the chicken in her dish was prepared (prior to ordering), his response was ""Ummm.... well... it's kind of braised... umm ... you know"" which didn't really mean much. Being of Mexican descent, my wife eats super spicy food pretty regularly and she couldn't finish her meal either. :(

Anyway, in our party of five only one of us finished our meal and even she said she could only taste chili-peppers and black ground pepper. Why would anyone want to eat enchiladas or chimichangas where you can't taste meat, cheese, or other ingredients??

Also, the Spanish Rice was soft and mushy and the refried beans were goopy and stiff and as if from a can. Darn it! I really wanted to like this place.",9qeb4Z0BfIJ9Uz62TR2foQ,5,4,2,q5xykHUOj75iRej24yJMfA

I understand this restaurant is just over a month old, so small things like slow wait staff the place being a little unorganized from top to bottom really didn't bother me too much. 

The food, was...OK. 

I ordered the ""hangover"" smothered burrito which was far from being ""smothered"" in green chilies and my fiancé ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Neither of us ate the hashbrowns because they were so unbelievably covered in butter they were almost inedible. Both dishes featured the green chile (as they should), but just fell short with the sides. Of course The hashbrowns, and the refried beans were over cooked and chewy.

1239087,2016-08-11,2,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"Sorry, but this is not New Mexican food.  I lived 30 plus years in Alb. and have had my share of great and not so great New Mexican cuisine.  This, unfortunately, was probably the worst.  Granted we are not in New Mexico but if you are going to slap on a sign that says New Mexican Cuisine......anyways.   First the atmosphere was promising because it actually had some nice ristras hanging (which probably could have been put to better use in making the red chile sauce) and it was clean.  My wife and I started off with a small bowl of guac and some salsa.  Things went quickly downhill from there.  The guac came out and we immediately noticed it was runny and a dark brown greenish color hinting that it was from pre mashed avocados and stuffed into a plastic food bag.  It tasted even worse.  The instant taste of old aged, slimy, runny avocados quickly answered all questions as to whether it was pre-packaged stuff....blegh.  It was absolutely disgusting.  We ate about two small bites each and then gave up on it completely.  Over to the salsa and it was more of the same.  Bland and boring but it was slightly more fresh than the guac....and the chips...sigh...the chips were those multi colored things.  They had a peculiar smell of something chemical....not pleasant at all and to round it out tasted just as bad.  Seriously, for a small place like this MAKE YOUR CHIPS FRESH and MAKE YOUR RED AND GREEN CHILE SAUCE FRESH and USE REAL AVOCADOS FOR GUAC and..... on and on I could go. By now my stomach is doing some funky stuff from the little I ingested and even the beer I ordered was not washing away the nasty taste.  We decided not to push our luck and tapped out there.  Now to be fair I wanted to at least try what the red and green chile sauce tasted like and asked the waiter for a small sample.  New Mexicans live and die by green and red chile sauce and a restaurant is quickly judged by the quality and taste of both of them.  To be honest, I think the green chile sauce was the Bueno jarred stuff (Bueno is a company in Alb. that has a decent reputation and some good stuff especially if your in a pinch and you've run out of your frozen red or green chile).  That being said, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. The red was the frozen red Bueno chile sauce (which is just red chile pureed and frozen) and little more than that.  No savory balance to cut the natural bitterness of the red and no simple traditional spices with the unholy exception of maybe some cumin (which Is almost blasphemy in New Mexico cuisine).   So that was our experience.....We couldn't even stomach a main course after those apps it was that bad. I wanted so badly to have a good/great experience here because New Mexico cuisine done right is a god send of goodness but this was just a mess of wishful thinking and poorly thought out execution.  Seriously, these guys/gals need to rethink what they are doing and go to back to N.M. for a refresher course.",l6DExU0PKOHy42h7ROQsGQ,5,1,1,hKUP8-NIEwnz-YmdkLwF5g

The first thing was the salsa... it wasn't all that good it had some flavor but it was more hot than flavorful. I ordered the stuffed sopapilla with green chile and ground beef with refried beans and Calabasitas. The calabasitas (squash) were not how I have ever seen them cooked in NM. They had tomatoes and onions and green chile. They didn't have any flavor. The stuffed sopapilla had a ton of fresh green chile piled on top. I am used to the green chile to be in a sauce not just fresh green chile on top. For it being hot it didn't have flavor either. The refried beans and sopapillas were the best part. My sister in law had carne adovada which was also flavorless but really hot. I don't know how food can be so hot but doesn't have flavor. I wouldn't go back.

1826886,2016-09-03,0,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"Out first time here last evening and I have to say I was pleased! We love all things New Mexico!
My first comments are about the location which I think hurts them a bit in terms of getting people in to give them a try. That said, it's behind the Home Depot on Flamingo in a strip mall. They did a nice job capturing the Feel of NM from a TV showing NM landscape and photos of the famous Hot Air Balloon festival held yearly to the Ristras hanging from the ceiling to the kachina dolls on the shelf. So I give it an A on capturing the feel of NM here in NV

Now, on to our service experience. The place was pretty empty which leads me to the comment above about it not getting traffic due to location. That said our service was attentive and excellent. 
No complaints. Very very good service.

I had the chimi with carve asada. Nice taste/flavor. Two sides were refrained beans and the squash onion corn traditional NM side. Garnished with fresh guac, sour cream, fresh lettuce and tomato as well as Christmas sauce on the side (red and green chile). The green chile was awesome. Love!
Red was nice but it is acquired taste and is not taco sauce or salsa! I personally like the depth of spiciness and smoky flavor. Guac tasty and fresh.
Only two suggestions. The meat was a little tough and I realize carne asada isn't a rib eye but it could use a little more marination time and up the flavor a little more. The squash and corn side dish was cold and could've used some more heating. Taste was fine however.

I forgot to mention the chips and salsa are free and the salsa was good, chunky type and had some heat! They also serve you soapapillas with the meal and honey is available on the table. 

Portions are large and truly 2 people who aren't starved but hungry can share a meal. 

We will be back. I hope they do better with more foot traffic. I enjoyed this little taste of NM in Vegas.",yhHsw9Uf24S8G8Gf3MnE_Q,0,0,5,dTco-Tnz2Gjj5P_rJtZkYQ

The green chili stew was thick and well-spiced, packed with potatoes but only a few bits of pork. Good flavor in this dish, and a good price, which included accompanying tortillas.

It may have been 3 tables with patrons at them. The place was empty. I placed my order  combination plate of tamales, chicken encilada, rice and beans. (Note to self... this is Albuquerque new Mexico style) I was open to change, green chiles different palate, whatever) this was the most bland, dry mexican food I'd ever experienced. The rice was tasteless, the tamale dry, full of masa, no meat, which I wouldn't mind had the masa been good. I paid about $15.00 for my lunch mind you. I politely paid my bill, vowed never to return. I left no tip, they didn't deserve a tip, the meal was Uber terrible. I would minus the 2 stars I gave them, if I could. Mucho bad",48P0qBCNRNT9IltKZDNdZg,1,0,2,gsmJsO9XmTsXJS5oUokL1g

I found it a little strange that the ground beef was not cooked in the red chile.   I understand that they try and cater to everyone including vegetarians but it seemed like there wasn't enough chile on the dish so it seemed a little dry.

The Spanish rice is soggy and awful. The calabacitas is ok but mushy as well. 
The tamale, by far the worse I e ever had. Very dry and overcooked. And the chile relleno, that too is the worse I've ever had. Too much of that thick batter drenched in cooking oil. I come from a family where I grew up on this stuff, I actually have tons of family in New Mexico and have tried all these items cooked by different people in different styles and recipes and have never had my food taste like this.

Keep in mind this is different from Mexican cuisine. It's flavorful but not necessarily spicy (though some dishes are). 

The key to this cuisine are the unique ingredients and dishes like red and green chile and traditional favorites like sopapillas (with honey). If you can't decide between red or green chile order ""Christmas"" which is some of both. 

Not only is the decor stylish and new but the food is made with heart and soul. Amy the owner is the brightest, sweetest, most joyful person and you can see she cares and is passionate about the food and her customers. 

Don't let the bad reviews keep you away. Businesses have growing pains and they've found their groove. I promise if you know and love New Mexican cuisine you'll be an instant fan. And if you've never had it -- you're in for a treat.",rYDaQWvNtl6YxZyy8zh_9A,0,0,5,dRykIe0Wd5m8ZTaQfURbxA

Our food came after an additional wait of 20 minutes and it was nothing to write home about. Chicken tacos were soggy and lacked flavor, Spanish rice under cooked. The only item we enjoyed were the sopaipillos and honey.

Great family run business with excellent service and selection.  I've never been to New Mexico to have anything to compare this to so I can't speak for the locals.  However, we really enjoyed what we had.  Definitely has a lot of kick to the food but it wasn't so hot that I couldn't taste the amazing flavor.  Plus, this type of Chile doesn't have a lingering spice, it wears off quickly compared to other types of peppers.  I like that the food isn't greasy and you can tell it is all homemade.  We had the pork stew, chicken and green chile soup, a tamale, chicken enchilada, and sopapilla.  The chicken and green chile soup was my favorite since the creaminess cuts back on the spice a bit.  I also loved the homemade salsa they serve with the chips.  The vibe of the space is homey but fun and definitely makes you want to visit New Mexico.

It was so worth it. Me and my friend went all out, because we wanted to try so many different things. First, they serve you complimentary chips and salsa, which is what they do in every true New Mexican restaurant (good start ;) ). We shared as an appetizer the green chile stew, which was spicy and wonderful. We then decided to try the red chile enchiladas with a fried egg on top, and the stuffed sopapilla (this one with green chile). We both shared the two meals, and they were both delicious. We finished it all, and then even had room for dessert!!! We couldn't leave without eating some sopapillas with honey, which are always a must, and were of course delicious. We also decided to try the fried ice cream. It was the first time any of us had had fried ice cream, and it exceeded both of our expectations. Also, we got it for free just for checking in on Yelp!

We ordered guacamole for an appetizer and waiter kept saying ""they're working on it"" our food came out and I told him to cancel the guacamole , he probably forgot to order it and blamed the kitchen .. I ordered the steak fajitas, they were tough as leather.. The onions and bell peppers were very oily / greasy as they came out sizzling on the skillet, the beans and rice were bland, absolutely no flavor , one bite and I was done with them.. It took a while to get the condiments for the fajitas, the sour cream / splash of guacamole.. Glad we canceled the   Guacamole appetizer cause if what I had with the fajitas  is the same batch I would've sent it back, again no flavor.. 
My husband had The green enchiladas he said they were so so he ate them but he wasn't real happy with them.. For the complimentary dessert they bring out sopapillas before we were even 1/2 way done with our food so by the time we were done and ready for them , they were ice cold.. Sopapillas are suppose to be nice and hot when consumed , that way the honey is slightly warm and gooey.. I asked for a fresh batch.. 
The service was subpar at best, I had to ask 3 different people for a small container to take home the salsa we had left over, finally the 3rd person brought it over.

Chile Addiction is the best New Mexico cuisine in Las Vegas (sorry Carlito's).  That being said, the chile could use some tweaking.  The red has good chile flavor but it could use some Mexican oregano, cumino and a little more salt.  It may be worthwhile to upgrade from bueno too.  No big complaints with the green and, in fact, the pork verde is very good.  The pinto beans also suffer from a lack of seasoning.  I like a few cloves of garlic thrown in while they are cooking and finished with lard and plenty of salt.  Sopapillas are very good.  Can't wait til they get some beer in there.

I feel like I need to qualify myself as a true New Mexican food connoisseur. I've had Horseman's Haven No.2 chile many times, and can reel restaurant name drops off the cuff like The Pantry, La Choza, Tia Sophia's, Tecolote Cafe etc. I also cook all the staple NM dishes myself, so I think that I know what to look for when authenticating this type of restaurant. I've eaten here a couple dozen times, and have tried a good cross section of all the items on the menu. The first time I came in I ordered the green chile stew, carne adovada stuffed sopapillas with chrismas chile, a combo plate with a chicken taco and enchilada that had calabacitas on the side. They threw in four (mini) sopapillas on the side with honey and butter and green chile guac with chips on the side as a nice bonus. The guac with fresh made tortilla chips is some of the best I've tasted, and I give their sopapillas 4/5 in terms of flavor and texture. All of the dishes I've tried have been legit, they use Bueno chile so everything has decent heat without ever being super spicy. I would most closely compare their menu with that of The Pantry restaurant in Santa Fe. Chile Addiction is definitely the best New Mexican restaurant I've tried outside of NM, and the service has always been fast and friendly whether I was dining in or taking out. They even sold me a ristra that I gave to my Grandma for xmas, and they have a little shop area that you can buy jars of salsa and chile, or dried chile.

We were soon greeted by Amy who showed us to our table and was our server.  After looking over the menu, we ordered a burrito for my wife with refried beans and Spanish rice and I got a chimichanga filled with carne adovada.  My two sides were pinto beans and calabacitas.  I ordered red sauce--regular spice level--for my wife and I got the triple hot green sauce for my chimichanga.  

We were brought a basket of chips and some salsa that had a good kick to it.  Even my gringa wife is starting to like spicier foods.  Win!

Our dinners came and they were very good.  Andrea thought her red sauce was spicy but she liked it.  My triple hot green sauce was great and it added great flavor to the adovada.  The only minor drawback was we were brought no sopapillas despite the menu saying that all meals are served with sopapillas and two sides.  As it turned out, we were full enough without having the extra amount of food from the sopapillas.

For dessert, we got an order of fried ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  Very good and large enough for sharing.

Prices are very reasonable and for some reason we had a $4.35 credit applied to our bill listed as a coupon.  We didn't have a coupon.  Our server, Amy, was a verry pleasant person.  She made you feel welcome.

We had the chicken nachos and the chile rellenos with both green and red chile. To sum the food up in one word: bland. Seriously, I didn't know a chile stuffed with cheese and covered in chile could be bland, but it was. Calabicitas: bland. Nachos: chips with plain chicken breast on top and a small amount of cheese sauce on the bottom (which somehow also lacked flavor). They don't even offer some table salsa to spice things up on your own. 
Sopapillas come with your meal, which is a nice touch and why they got the 3rd star. However, we had 2 adults and 2 kids, so we split 2 entrees, and were served 2 sopapillas. How much would it cost to provide 4 sopapillas for 4 people???

I picked the calabacitas and the Spanish rice. Both sides were pretty disappointing, they were plain and lacked flavor.

I was referred here by another New Mexican,  but  I must say the food was bad (very bland). I ordered the stacked enchiladas with ground beef with a side of whole pinto beans and rice. The rice tasted like ketchup and rice (no spice) and very bland. The Enchilada had very little cheese and beans with tasteless ground beef. The green chili sauce was clumped like out of a can some of the peppers still had the outer peeling.. This not what I was raised on, I can only assume the cook does not taste the food as it is being prepared? No seasonings I had to add salt just to choke it down! The egg on top tasted like was out of a carton not a real egg?
I was hoping the owner Amy would like some feedback and I suggested her chef was not performing to task on the quality of the food and offered some suggestions. I would like to see them succeed with their new business but she was very put off by my comments. She replied this is our interpretation of New Mexico food. Owner Amy was closed minded and pompous. WRONG attitude the food is really bad! I suggested she get a couple of grandmothers from New Mexico in there to do it right to come even remotely close to Garduno's or Padilla's or El Pinto's in Albuquerque. Her response is the chef was a very successful chef who has worked at many fine restaurants. If the chef was any good it would show in the food. I never write YELP reviews but this lady asked for it with her attitude.
 I feel the Chef should spend some more time in cooking school learning the basics like seasoning and not getting his New Mexico recipes from Google? If he is tasting the dishes as they go out he has a palate problem, he should should spend some time in Albuquerque tasting real New Mexico food! It is an art and would be worth the investment.New Mexicans know good New Mexican food, and this is amateur at best.
My suggestion for what it is worth save your money or you will be disappointed. I am still on a quest to find good New Mexico food in Las Vegas and this is definitely not it. I wish them luck and we will not be going back sad to say.  Consider yourself warned food sucks. Sorry but Carlito's still beats Chile Addiction on taste.

The water was brought as soon as I told the server that's what I wanted but no chips and salsa. Which to be honest is sometimes my only reason for going to a sit down Mexican restaurant and not just habanero grill which has excellent tacos and Is just across the parking lot.. But the salsa came long after I ordered, which is also a way to get my bearing on how spicy the food will be, the salsa being mild and me ordering mild food since on the menu the hot scale goes from mild to hot no in between ... If the salsa came earlier I would have guessed that it's more of a decoration than a guideline for ordering. 

I left without eating.  I asked if there was hot sauce for my tacos, she offered Tabasco. I said you don't have any Mexican hot sauce or anything house made.. She went to the kitchen and brought back a bunch of chopped up jalapeño peppers which is what they put on something on their menu. I said this is it you don't have any sauce. She said we do but you asked for hot and this is the hottest we have. I opened the menu up and said a bunch of this stuff comes with a sauce on it most say hot.. But I can't have any? She went back to the kitchen. I waited 5 min not eating just waiting. Realizing she was either spitting in my sauce or taking her time I left without paying or eating anything.  What kind of idiot has never used hot sauce on tacos?!?!?! If you sell tacos have some hot sauce.  I won't be going back. I suggest you avoid this place too go to an actual Mexican restaurant where they don't offer Tabasco for tacos.  Also the tortillas were like wal mart brand. Not even a good store brand they were as thick as a Harry Potter novel, hence my asking for sauce and they were three times as big as the meat in them, so the ratio was way off..

I guess my description AND PHOTOS of the meal somehow aren't good enough. Would the credit card receipt somehow prove it?

Here's why this place is authentic New Mexican Food:

1. The owners and kitchen staff are from Albuquerque.
2. She is a fellow Hatch-Head. If it's not from Hatch, New Mexico, then it's not ""chile"".
3. Christmas style ain't just for December
4. The enchiladas are topped with a fried egg...by default.
5. Very friendly and invited us to the soft opening ""if we don't mind a few inevitable glitches while we get things figured out."" 

We dined there on their opening night and found the food to be wonderful, authentic New Mexican cuisine. The owners are very friendly. The shop also has some items that I haven't seen available in Las Vegas.

Chicken Stacked Enchiladas: Very good. The chiles were a tad spicier than expected, but had great flavor! Loved the rice as well.

Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito: Delish! I was a little jealous of my husband's choice here since I liked it even better than my own food. 

Sopapillas: This is the place where a star was lost. I'm sure in the restaurant, they are served soft and warm. Since we ordered delivery, these were cold and kind of hard.

5058217,2015-08-17,3,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"After reading good things about Chile Addiction I brought my family there on a Sunday night, but we had a less-than-optimal experience. From the time we entered the restaurant, we didn't get our entrées until 50 minutes later - and there were only five other tables occupied in the whole place. Our drinks (no alcohol license so don't expect a beer or margarita) and guacamole arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it took well over a half hour for the rest of the food to arrive. 

Also, as we arrived the restaurant was very dimly lit (the sun was setting) and then when they turned on the lights everything was really bright. But when they tried turning down the lights a bit the lights started flickering. Miserable.

And then when the food finally arrived the disappointment continued. I was looking forward to the stuffed sopaipillas and the chiles but the whole plate was very bland. Nearly everyone at our table went for the salt shaker, which I can't remember happening at any restaurant in a long time.

I hate to give it one star because the two servers we encountered there were friendly, but everything ended up being a disappointment. Slow service, bland food and flickering lights that almost gave me a headache? I don't think I'll be back.",ArQHLbbnNpQiaSaDqsaZzg,5,3,1,PdLFuKThbMuDwNi6bUQzZw
5071721,2015-09-04,3,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,I lived in NNM for the first 24 years of my 28 year existence and this restaurant does not deserve to associate itself with New Mexican cuisine. Chile wasn't hot at all and didn't taste like much. You're better off heading over to Sonic and getting a green Chile cheeseburger now that they offer hatch green Chile. Really wanted to like this place because carlitos burritos is hit n miss and no place else to go.

5123054,2016-12-07,7,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"Walked in around 530pm and the lone owner/waitress working tables seemed completely overwhelmed with 7 tables to herself. Perhaps someone called out.

We ordered a carne asada chimichanga with both green and red sauce (they called it ""Christmased"") and carne asada enchiladas with the green sauce. If you want something out of the ordinary, go for the green on pretty much everything on the menu, it seemed to embolden what a ""chile addiction"" is all about. Chunks of green chili (I'm going to guess) is what gives this the New Mexican Tex Mex food authenticity although I've never been to New Mexico. The red on the other hand was your very basic red sauce (read: nothing special doin'). The carne asada was tasty and they gave me a decent portion inside.

The sides of refried beans and rice were pretty standard. I would skip the zucchini and squash side even though I was looking forward to it...tasted a bit bland.

The chips were very fresh although the salsa didn't seem to be, reminding me of chunky old el paso.

I was confused at the honey on the table and I didn't understand what it was for. When I ran out of salsa for my chips I gave them a few squirts thinking that must be what they do in New Mexico. I understood when the food came and they brought out some complimentary ""Sopapilla"" to go with the meal. It was my first time trying one and I'd describe it as a fluffy fried dough...good stuff.

A couple misses here and there, like not having silverware on the table after our food had arrived and the ice water tasting like it was straight unfiltered tap, but I'm a sucker for friendly owners of mom and pop joints and this place has a nice feel to it with decent food.

They are worth a go for a slightly different twist on Mexican.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,12,8,4,4vrc_ooh6La2CSNGo_zLTQ

I knew ordering fajitas probably wasn't the way to go but I had a taste for fajitas so I ordered them anyway. For $16 for chicken fajitas you think that it would be a decent size portion but it was the smallest portion I've ever received! The waiter set the food down and my husband asked if that was a full-size portion for the fajitas and the waiter snottily answered yes and walked away. Not only was the portion extremely small but one side of my fajitas were completely charred to the point that they were crunchy. And I'm not talking caramelized either. Mind you this whole time I've been waiting for a refill on my drink so I was already a little irritated. A Lady working there who may have been the owner could tell that we were unhappy and came over to address the problem. She offered to bring me more fajita vegetables until she realized that my husband took a picture of the portion size and the charring and then offered to bring me additional chicken as well. When she brought out the replacement food, it was good but even that second portion was tiny compared to what you get at most restaurants for the same amount of money. The food was good but the service was just not great - like I said I waited for a refill on my drink the whole time.

5322920,2015-08-07,12,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"New Mexico style Mexican food?!? I've never had that, I needs to go to there! And so there I went. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed declaring this a food adventure. Especially seeing this place so highly rated on Yelp... again, don't believe the hype.

This was a major food fail for the most part. First and foremost, it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by and say hi and take our drink order. Chips and salsa arrived shortly after. The salsa was a bit spicy, which I liked, but my dad and sister don't do spicy, so they only had a quick taste before tapping out.

I ordered a cup of Pozole. It was delicious, heavy on the hominy (which mama likes), and was presented in a large bowl and tasted homemade. 

My little sister ordered a carne asada burrito, refried beans, and rice. I had the stacked enchiladas with carne adovada with calabacitas and whole pinto beans. My dad opted for a combo with a beef enchilada, chile rellano, and a carne asada taco. We also got a side of sopapillas which weren't touched. When the order came out, my dad's taco was MIA. The taco appeared like 20 minutes later and we declined it, they offered to let us take it home, and I did with my left overs.

So let's talk about the food. It was bland and kind of boring. I was expecting more exciting flavors! New flavors, but everything fell flat. The only stand out dish at dinner was the Chile Rellano. It was the dankest of the dank and probably the best one I've ever had, but a Chile Rellano does not a 5-star review make.

Thanks to Yelp, we got a free fried ice cream as we looked over the check. Fried ice cream was great, but it wasn't anything I hadn't had before.

Chile Addiction didn't leave me with even a craving or much to remember them by. I really wanted to like this place. I really want little independent places to make it! I really root for the underdog! I just can't give them more than 2stars. Poor service with less than mediocre food. I'm chopping it up to rookie mistakes.

I'm a big fan of hatch chilies and spice so this is the place right?? We they nailed the spice factor.

Interior is nice and very ""New Mexican"" so it fits the bill in the decor aspect.

For food I ordered guacamole, taco salad and red chili pork with pinto beans.

Food was very very under seasoned and lacked any excitement. If it wasn't for the spice it wouldn't have any character.

5442840,2015-07-07,1,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"This is a review of Great and really pretty poor.  Went to Chile Addiction on Sunday.  It was about 3:00 and the place had about 4 tables.  We were seated immediately.  Once we reviewed the menu, we ordered a bowl of soup to split between the 2 of us and an entree each.  The chips and salsa arrived pretty quickly.  The chips are ""Christmas"" (Red & Green) and nothing to write home about.  The salsa, however was complex and had enough heat to wake you up, but not so much as to make you want to run away. 

We waited about 15 minutes before asking our server if we were getting our soup.  He said he would check and out he came with our soup and the two entrees all at the same time.  We were told that they thought the order was for 3 people even though there were only two of us at the table.  I had to ask for spoons!!!  The soup was very good.

The pork chili verde was quite nice as an entree.  Complex chili flavors and a fair portion. 

I am not sure of the idea of every entree coming with sopapillas and having honey on the table.  They were OK, but ensured that we did not need to order desert.

As I said from the start. this is a review of Great - the food and the pretty poor - the service.  If you can get over the fact that it may take your server 3 trips to bring 2 glasses of water and straws for quality tasty food at a fair price, then this place is for you.  The owner was there,but she was either running the register or setting tables.

Yes you can get enchiladas and fajitas and I had a Chimichunga my husband had the green chile stew. Yes it takes a bit for your food but it is fresh! Ray served us he was awesome! So for those of you that are giving bad ratings you do not know New Mexico food for those of you that want to try it you have to go!",Mx88pVIphvnRr3Eu_Qee5A,0,0,5,EC-BXx4NZ5Zpks7FGfIE5Q
5762647,2018-05-26,0,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,This was a wonderful meal. I had the taco salad and my husband had the carne adovada burrito with spanish rice and refried beans. The service is outstanding and friendly not to mention the complimentary pillowy sopapillas that are a perfect ending to the meal especially delicious with a touch of honey. We will definitely be back.,TNj7NNasMS9ypEJJFECBJw,1,1,5,5JkNCik1065B45kNeVVU5Q

Salsa was good with a little heat.  Enchiladas were topped with a fried egg, and tasty.  Sopaipillas were served with the meal and very good.

My only complaint was that food was not served very hot, but somewhat lukewarm.  

We will return.  I would like to try the fried ice cream!",XqxfND6MnnWCy-4Y3Hf7wg,0,1,4,VNCJUjf5SbwFCTCMuFWARQ
5819889,2015-07-27,2,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"I'm sad to have to give this a bad review because I really wanted to like it. The service is so slow and unpleasant here, which doesn't make any sense as a new restaurant. It makes sense to still be getting it together, but when there's multiple tables looking visibly annoyed, you need to be at least a little apologetic when it takes 15 minutes to even have your order taken or 90 minutes to get through a meal.

I will say that the queso and the green sauce are good, but it everything else was shockingly bad. Started out strong with fries with queso and green chile, but the burrito was awful. The red sauce is terrible, the calabacitas are bad and the rice is practically mashed potato consistency. It came out completely cold, but no one ever appeared to tell them about it so we were out of luck there. 

I might give it one more try and order something else (and stick to green chile), but if I feel like I'm bothering the employees by even existing then it'll be a loss.",j359pP-JXZzkQrJMtKF3jA,5,2,2,Y_YU7wZRtAFjwoHjiroM6A
5831675,2017-02-13,0,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"This is a bittersweet review for a few reasons. The sweet part being the taste of the food. The chicken in the taco was juicy with nice flavor. The pork in the tamale was the perfect consistency.... the bitter part being the delivery service... I dont know if it's in-house or ...? Needless to say, delivery took a while and when the driver called me to tell me where he was, as I was explaining  where to go, he abruptly hung up on me. So I went outside and saw him a ways down the road... I waved him over and as he approached my door he dropped the bag... you could hear the smash.... I just stood there in disbelief. But hey... it happens? So we get the food and I am anticipating the damage, and sure enough... everything was crushed into a giant shapeless mash. The chicken taco wasn't broken due to the food drop, but because it was soggy mush...rolled enchilada was also a bit underwhelming. Bittersweet.... food was flavorful... but presentation and general care of the product, a huge disappointment. I would definitely enjoy the food better if I ate in-house.",Oi8rMmCMOyCNCZE3vSkepw,0,0,3,sdKbVHzsmK6Qw6Sas8VN8A

I had the chile rellano with green chile and hubby had chicken tamales stacked with green chile- both very good, good portion size. Only downside - service was slow. Not because they were inept but because they were so busy and hadn't expected the huge increase in business.  I am sure they will hire more staff because I don't see them slowing down.",1o-d_kvOceQR5aPO90vQAQ,0,0,4,GXdE_XQP9GQF66amRr5P7g

Having grown up in Albuquerque and Santa Fe and having a true love for New Mexican cuisine, as well as knowing how to cook New Mexican cuisine, imagine my absolute delight that someone had decided to open a New Mexican food restaurant in Vegas apart from Carlitos Burritos.  (Which, by the way, is a SMASH hit 5 STAR place.. and the Nevada Governor's fave place to visit when in town, I know, I was there when he said it himself, but I digress...) 

1 star for having the ""huevos"" to open up such a restaurant 
2 stars for the beautiful Southwest décor, complete with an RC Gorman print on the wall... 

Regretfully that is where I will leave it.  

Service was miserable.  NOT a crowded afternoon, it was AARP / toddler hour.   Took FOREVER to seat us and there were more than enough open seats.  Once seated, we counted 18 minutes until someone came to our table.  That was after my husband had to flag someone down.  These are the basics, people.  

Once we did order it was an eternity to actually get our food.  

Carne Adovada was super dry and not worth a third bite.  The pork chile verde was loaded with large potatoes, no hatch green chile spice at all and one piece of pork.  Really?  

My husband and I were so disappointed.  I seriously have no words for the level of gross.  

Too bad, it would have been a huge hit for my family had it been better.",3zczu4YDXk5M27xMQl-Few,27,12,2,MOIGryHa4PEajJIXFzq3yg
5960010,2015-07-01,11,XxYU9t50R5NnyUBmZVCEJg,"My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on stacked enchiladas, sopaipillas and posole. When I heard Chile Addiction had opened in the southwest side of town, I was so excited to give them a try. 

I was thoroughly impressed by the food and the service. So impressed, that we ended up coming back not once, but two more times.

I have tried the stacked enchiladas with pork verde, posole, stuffed enchiladas with pork verde, chile adovado, huevos rancheros, sopaipillas, tamales, breakfast burrito, churros and fried ice cream. Every single thing I have tried has been great and definitely has that nostalgia factor going for it.

The service here is beyond wonderful. The servers and owners are so friendly and welcoming and make sure refills are plentiful. They've even offered us free dessert as an apology for our food taking too long. The funny thing is we didn't even notice a delay, but they insisted that we order dessert on them.

I plan on making this a regular spot and I hope others take the time to experience this regional cuisine that holds a special place in my heart. Just skip the desserts as they are not good.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,19,16,4,wDuk8Oi-BKcpdz_zCpXKzg

This restaurant is the first I've found in Vegas that uses Hatch green chiles from New Mexico in their green chile. Takes me back to the Colorado green chile I grew up on!  They even have hot and xxx hot! We'll definitely be back!!",VbmG59Z8nnRpVgVeob_OaQ,1,0,5,ZHYuQCwRIICbxbCqvRWg0A
