2803677,2015-08-15,1,VYOtofDcgJIV5-vPUd4sZA,"My first impression was simply ""dirty"". Place looked like it hasn't mopped for months. Tables had crumbs and grease. The drink fountain was dirty with liquid dripping and sticky. The buffet counter was also dirty with stuff on it. 

I came to Cici's to get varieties of pizza. $5.99 per person. But no good at all. Came with family of 4 and we all rejected the pizzas. The mac & cheese pizza was cold and chewy, no softness of the dough. The cheddar cheese and ham pizza wasn't good at all. I never liked any of the pizza dough. The seasonings on the crust was good but didn't help at all in general. Though I really liked the cheese-stuffed deep dish pepperoni pizza, very crispy crust with cheese oozed out of it. The salad bar was horrendous. The salad was chopped up in weird uneven pieces. There were bacon bits but DID NOT taste like bacon at all. Some other toppings and plenty of dressings. If they have like 6 different types of dressing for just salad then maybe they should do better for the pizzas instead (after all the place is for pizzas, not salad). There were pastas with Alfredo sauce but didn't look appetizing. The desserts were some choco brownies and some types of cinnamon buns. Tried the cinnamon buns, tasted like cinnamon buns. 

Overall was not impressed. If a person was to pay almost $6 pizza for this kind of pizzas then I recommend you order Little Caesar's instead, same thing for families.",pIekRRbcZvQbwYobu7f6sA,0,0,1,WdQmpw2vpl3qLeJvaIKgaw

3119483,2010-04-27,1,VYOtofDcgJIV5-vPUd4sZA,"It a $5 pizza buffet! Of course it's crap but you go into the place knowing that. They typically have about 5 or 6 different types of pizzas sitting on the counter at any time but they're pretty much just different combinations of the same ingredients. The only good pizza they have is the pepperoni deep dish pizza but usually, as soon as they put that out, it's gone. When a pizza is out and you want it, you can request a few slices from the next one that comes out, and they'll give you a big ass orange safety cone type of thing to put on your table. I don't know why but I don't like that. It essentially goes from a buffet to a regular order when you do that and you're typically waiting for like 5-8 minutes for the next pizza to come out because they probably don't throw one in the oven until the current one is at least half done. 

They also have some brownies, some cinnamon roll pizza thing, some pasta and I think a soup and they're all crappy. Everything taste like it's some generic brand stuff from Costco's frozen food section.

I also liked that the tables were cleared as soon as customers left. When my fianc√©e and I came, it was around 6pm so it wasn't too busy but had lots of kids running around. The pizza was fresh and hot. Wasn't too impressed with the selection of desserts though. The cinnamon rolls were gooey and had lots of icing on them. LOVED it. 
My complaints would be that the floors seemed dirty, like they hadn't been mopped. I come from Texas, so being raised with Southern hospitality, I automatically thanked the table busser for taking our empty plates away. She gave me a strange look, so all I can say is never again. The pizza staff was awesome though, making sure pizza was always fresh and the pizza pans were full.

With all the Cici's I've been to, I was having a hard time remembering this one.  But that's not to say it wasn't good.  It just means, don't wait too long kids!

This is a nice location.  Far off the strip on the end of a quiet strip mall.  It seems fairly new judging by the building exterior and interior.  As with all Cici's, you get the ""Welcome"" greeting when you walk in the door.  Don't forget your military discount all you veterans with an ID card.

By now you know the deal, order when you walk in, get your salad (they have their own mixture like Olive Garden).  The follow the serving line.  Pasta is up next.  Basic fare.  Then garlic cheese bread.  Yum!  My favorite when it's cooked correctly.  And then pizza.  Usually there are 8 to 10 already made to choose from.  If you don't see what you like, ask, and they will make it for you.  

They will ask how many slices you want or you can just take the whole thing if you're feeling hearty.  The pizza will be ready in a few minutes.  It doesn't take long at all.  At the end of the pizza line are a couple of dessert things; a cinnamon bun kind of thing and a chocolate brownie style thing.  I've never tried these or the pasta, but they seem popular.  Finally, get your drinks and go eat.

Nice clean location.  Busy, friendly crew.  They keep the pizza coming and the tables clear.

I got there at about 8 PM. tonight and the place was about 25% full. There was no where to sit because almost every table had plates on it (dirty buffet plates). AT first I thought maybe they were just short handed. Right away I noticed the cashier kept filing the salad and dressings without washing her hands. She was touching everything! Money, dirty rags, trash and then would go fill the salad and move the pizza around. I went up to the pizza counter to ask for our Pepperoni pizza that we had ordered about 20 minutes before and they had forgotten to make it. As I stood there I noticed the cashier pull a pizza out from UNDERNEATH (below the pizza counter) the counter and set it under the heat. I was horrified to see a sausage pizza that had been sitting out (already cooked) placed underneath the heat lamp. We left and didn't even eat more than a plate of food after being disgusted by the slop fest of CiCi's pizza.

4239484,2010-09-12,2,VYOtofDcgJIV5-vPUd4sZA,"Ever had one of those moments where you want to forget that something ever happened? I just had one of those. It was after eating at CiCi's.

In all of my young adult years, I've never found a reason to complain about pizza. I've had cheap pizza, and higher end pizza. They are what you pay for; and generally, what you expect. CiCi's was a different case, however. Sure, it's a real cheap price for an all you can eat extravaganza, but is it really worth it? 

Maybe as a kid I wouldn't mind this place. Heck, as a kid, anything pizza-related sounded good to me. Combine two awesome foods, like mac & cheese and pizza? That sounds like a childhood fantasy. But, when actually having that cardboard slice of pizza with macaroni & cheese thrown on top was like I dumpster dived for a slice of pizza and found mac & cheese residue on top. The pizza didn't taste good, nor did the mac & cheese. Combine the two and you get an exponential amount of awful.

Sure they have the normal pizza with the traditional toppings. Thing is, they taste similar to pizza that sat out in a drunken dorm room for about a week, maybe worse. Then they also have the crazy combination pizzas, like the mac & cheese or one with Taco Bell style toppings thrown on top, which make absolutely no sense at all. Putting such low quality food and combinations made my taste buds weep tears of sadness. That night, I wouldn't be surprised if half of my taste buds shut down on me in sheer disappointment, forever leaving me with the palate of a senior citizen.

Yes, the place was all-you-can eat. All I was able to handle was 1.5 slices. It was after that, I was done and walked out.

Me and my roommate went in for lunch Sat 3/7/15. For the two of us, 2 buffets and 2 large drinks came to $17.  

The place has a family atmosphere and there is also an arcade area. There are tv's around, and on that particular day they had on a soccer game. 
 
There is a salad area, a soup area, and the pizza area. I noticed that the pizzas were always well stocked. The soups weren't anything special- clam chowder and chicken noodle mostly broth but I prefer that anyways. The salad bar had no cheese, and only iceberg lettuce. But they did have mushrooms. And their signature Italian dressing tasted similar to Olive Garden!

As far as the Pizza, I really enjoyed it. I thought the sauce was excellent, and it was fresh.  There was a lot of cheese and various toppings. One very cool thing is that you can request a pizza to be made to order. My roommate really liked that--he even got a Pan crust! I posted a picture of it.

They no longer have the cheese and red pepper shakers on the table nor the napkin dispenser. Everything is all bunched up around the soda fountain with the lids on one side and the straws on the other! 
The paper cups are a really classy touch. 
Oh yea, the main reason for the low level of love: they adiosed the memorial to the two officers that lost their lives here in 2014.

First, the bad.  Green salad comes out in very small batches and there are a few greasy squeeze bottles.  There are lots of kids running around so you have to be careful not to step on one of them.  The pizzas that are on their usual rotation aren't too interesting.

Now for the amazingly good side.  The pizza was actually pretty good.  Not gourmet-good but at least as good as a Papa John's or Pizza Hut pizza.  And much cheaper.  You can even request your favorite and the staff will bring you several slices when it is ready.  The staff were remarkably cheerful given how busy it was.  

Really glad I finally got a chance to try.  I'll probably be back at least once on my next trip when I get tired of the casino buffet food.",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,1,0,4,goEusZS__b3xkc182RK4PQ

With it not being very busy, I can understand not having a lot of pizza out because it wouldn't be fresh for very long, but they did have some variety and did their best to keep it rotated and fresh. I have no real complaints.

Pizza was fine and of course their cinnamon rolls were awesome.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,3,F6CkQfh6NVhsnOkOyeoSkQ

Only issues was, the arcade area took some of our money, without letting us play. And the sticker machine was out of stickers, but still took our quarters, so again, we got nothing. It would be really nice if they could make sure those things were properly labeled when they run out, check on them more often maybe.",q_MC5Mzvyf96Ut3f6-1ABA,0,0,4,cwDc7WuHKHBr2Whk51G1Tw

Love the Cinna bread stuff, the brownies and the apple dessert pizza though it can be a little to sweet. Depends on who makes it. 

NOW FOR THE BAD. 
I walk in, and am waiting for a Cashier and it takes 10 minutes before someone comes up to ring me up. The pizza station wasnt stocked at all, and the pizzas that were up there had minimal pizzas left. The bread sticks werent on par with the ones ive had at other Cicis in other states. The Sweet Tea wasnt sweet at all. 

They have a hard time keeping the pizzas fresh and stocked. Same thing with the Desserts they werent stocked well at all. They come around often and clear your table. They also forget about your special order pizza and instead of taking responsibility they try to pass the blame on someone int he kitchen.

I have never seen such a worse group of people in there. And ive ate at Cici's in Colorado and Arizona. People coming in wearing Pajama pants and slippers with there underwear plainly visible. Men wearing Shorts with there boxers showing and wearing a wife beater and you can see the disgusting stomach hanging out. Parents letting there kids play with the soda machine, and Kids being inside and are wearing dirty clothes. 

The restaurant area is clean. But this one straddles the area of Nice and Ghetto on Nellis And Stewart. And I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS ONE. Looking at some of the patrons almost grossed me out so bad i almost lost my dinner. This should be named Pistol Petes and not Cicis Pizza.",A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,5,2,1,lQDQ4qEvHjL-08l_K9wzIA
5535483,2018-06-23,0,VYOtofDcgJIV5-vPUd4sZA,The pizza was good when we custom ordered it. The service was lacking and tables were dirty. I also found a hair in the cinnamon bread. I thought it was just a little burnt piece on the side of it so I pulled at it. Seeing the hair come out of it was gross and ruined my experience as that must have been cooked inside of it.,iMciVTJ3nNs6H-ypyknoow,0,0,2,TEQ0XPltx1uH_2VZCyDabw

5890656,2015-07-28,0,VYOtofDcgJIV5-vPUd4sZA,The food is good for the price but you'd thing the pizza would be better since it is pretty much all they make. I always order a combo and it's the best thing in my opinion. Service is a bit odd. They rudely come to your table and clear it while you're eating.,8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q,0,0,3,w_pdsyHou8FY8svOdpEQvw
