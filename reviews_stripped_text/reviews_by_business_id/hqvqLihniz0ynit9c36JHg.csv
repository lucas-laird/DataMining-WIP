Came here for lunch and did the AYCE bbq and sushi like everyone else here, and we were really let down because basically nothing was fresh. In fact, the best thing we had the entire time was the starter salad, which is pretty sad. The banchan (side dishes) were all not quite up to par. The bbq was passable but meats were quite old. Sushi was the biggest shock because we couldn't keep eating after taking a few bites. All the rolls just tasted OFF and they were trying to disguise it by using a lot of sauces. Still can't cover that smell...! Service was good and attentive though, I guess that was the only positive aspect of this dining experience.",WrwbiFTDY_YUoJQGG6Sgjw,0,0,2,5aNnYf6fShuK45GEhdbYYQ

352753,2017-07-04,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"Worst kbbq experience ever! Yelp has five stars to give so I'll deduct one by one by listing these points why this place is absolutely horrible.
1. Customer service is lacks that it's basically non-existent. We were told we'd have to wait half an hour but this was understandable IF this place was busy. However, I only saw five parties. Two parties we're already sitting down, and three parties were in line. There were SO many empty tables and after waiting for so long with no chairs to sit I decided to ask the waiter why is there such a long wait when there are so many empty tables. Want to hear the reason? ""Eh..we don't have enough staff and the other room is busy so we wouldn't be able to serve you if you sat down"" what the bogus reason is this? Clearly they DO NOT know how to run a business. 

2. Food wait times - knowing we wouldn't be served because of their lack of employees (no idea why you would even open a business with like 3-4 employees for a supposedly a busy place) we ordered a couple of items on our first round but the proceeding rounds got worse as the time went by. We were neglected, orders were wrong or take forever to come. For example, I ordered THREE steamed eggs and received one, I ordered edamame and received it when I'm almost done eating my food. The waiter passed by and failed to deliver

3. Change of grill - we changed our grill twice. First time we waited about 5minutes, second time we probably waited like 15-20minutes. It feels like I was done with my food since nobody came around to ask if we're okay or even ask if we needed a grill change. How do you keep a business if you

4. Paying for the food - gave our card and they took forever to even give us the check to sign. We had to seriously walk up to the cashier to ask for the card back. The only Asian girl greeted us thank you (the same person who put us on the waitlist) looks like she was so lethargic. She said thank you but ignored our receipt that we signed. Do you even want our business????!!!

5. Yelp doesn't even allow zero stars otherwise that's what I'd give. Since they get one star I'll conclude with a few last pointers - Their selection is very small. Prices are overpriced for their selection and after this day, I definitely will NOT be returning back. We were FORCED to pay the 20% gratuity because we had 7 people but this was pretty steep of a percentage. I've been to other places and their food was much better, more selection and cheaper. Their sushi is also a lot of rice and when they delivered our sushi it didn't look so appetizing. Their fried calamari was not even crunchy/crispy. Water was refilled ONCE during our long wait periods
All in all - I don't know how this place is even alive or has 4 stars. I don't even know if this place even knows how to run a business. If you're short staffed why would the owner even allow so many employees off or if they didn't have enough people to begin with..wouldn't you think hiring people would be a good idea? It isn't rocket science biwon! It's more like bilost now.",QVaYqV2ws-ABCXM86Y1Dag,1,0,1,j0xsD46BEp7M3SNeSG2j5w

420202,2016-09-22,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"I and my family wanted to try out KBBQ and sushi together so we went to this lovely restaurant. We went around 2:30 P.M so there was no wait time at all. We got seated and our server was very polite on how the whole AYCE system works and explained it very well. We ordered the Marinated sliced Ribeye, Spicy pork and the Beef Brisket. We also ordered the Ocean roll, Mushroom poppers and Shrimp poppers. The food came by very quickly (5 mins top) and let me tell you the Mushroom/Shrimp poppers are the bomb! It's a deep fried sort of sushi roll but on one side, it has a deep fried cap of sorts to contain the crab and mushroom together. It contains a lot of flavours such as a crab mix and sweet sauces. I would def recommend it if you are feeling for deep fried items. The Ocean roll was also very good being very crunchy while having other flavours go with it. Marinated sliced Ribeye is a must to order if you are getting KBBQ.  The beef brisket was also nice as it was already Marinated a bit and tasted quite good. Although the spicy pork was not one of my favorites, I made sure to order the Ribeye 3 more times because it tasted real good. Also to mention that the servers made sure that we were doing fine and changed the grill often. They also helped us to cook our food and were always very happily to take our order. On our second order, we got more mushroom poppers and 3 different sushi rolls. All of it arrived very quickly and boy did we eat it fast. Although the sushi wasn't anything special it was well worth the 5 dollars we spent. To finish all off we had some Green tea ice cream. Let me tell you, this is so damn good ice cream. All of our family got at least 3 more big scoops of it 'cause it was def better than most ice cream you can find here in LV. To sum it up, they have a lot of options to choose from just for the Lunch option.

There was an abundance of banchan dishes though. Service wasn't so hot either. I know we came in at an odd time - around 4pm - so it was really slow.

The idea of AYCE Korean BBQ and Sushi was exciting. I personally enjoyed the meat; how it was seasoned and the dipping sauce. Sushi was decent; it wasn't bad but I've had better at other AYCE Sushi restaurants. 

There were 3 servers that assisted us, and I don't recall any of them smiling or looking like they wanted to be there.

My girlfriend and I we're admittedly pretty stoked at the prospect of AYCE Sushi AND Korean bbq when we drove past Biwon a few weeks back. 
We checked on-line to make sure it was going to be open late after I got off work. It said 3am closing time. 

We showed up at 1:20 am on a Friday night and sure enough there's a sign on the door saying that its open until 3am. When we walk in a small, tatted-up asian dude ""greets"" us. He doesn't say ""Hi"" or ""Welcome to Biwon"", he says ""Last call 20 minutes"" with a shitty look on his face. We asked if that was for sushi and bbq and he said yes, and quickly returned to his reciepts. Not wanting to feel rushed, we verbally elected to return at an earlier time the next night. The guy heard us say it. 

Now we usually would have just said screw this place and never went back, however the promise of Sushi and BBQ was enough to lure us back. So we go back the next night (a Saturday) about 12:30am when we walk in the same tatted-up asian dude is at the hostess/host stand going over his nights reciepts again. He asks us "" Two for BBQ?"". We reply ""Oh,both sushi and bbq"". He then tells us that sushi is only until 10:30...every night. And with an ""I couldn't care less look"" he put his head down once agian, more interested in his cloing work than taking care of the customer.

WTF! Why would you not tell us that the night before when you knew we were coming back?!

The food may be the bomb,but, I'll never know...because I won't be back a third time.",YiutVyblSGa9oYyEscFPdg,3,2,1,jN6jWIJ9qUSVojYqr0Ba6A

Had no clue what to expect, but once we got there we did have to wait and parking was difficult. This is definitely casual dining and you might want to dress in clothes that you dont mind getting oil splashes on. We ended up waiting around half an hour to 40 minutes but considering it was fathers day, that is acceptable. 

We ordered a wide variety of appetizers and entrees. Ill list them according to my favorites; entrees then appetizers;
1. Garlic beef belly
2. Ribeye
3. Beef brisket
4. Beef tongue
5. Spicy pork
6. Pork belly

1. Tempura calamari
2. Garlic calamari

The quality of the meats were very good. It was also the first time i have tried beef belly and let me just say that it was frickin amazing! Soft, juicy, packed full of flavor as you cook it with the farlic sauce. It is a bit fatty but thats expected from a belly cut. This is definitely the highlight of my food adventure here and if you do visit this place, make sure to order at least 2 servings. The ribeye also had good marble and was tender. Make sure to not overcook or unevenly cook it. The beef brisket and tongue were of good quality as well. The rest were standard at any korean bbq place. Oh i alost forgot. The ban chan was delicious as well, from the fish cake to a variety of kime chee and pickled vegetables.

As for service, everyone was nice and welcoming. Our server was awesome and didnt shy away from engaging with us and answering questions or cracking jokes. It is a busy restaurant so do expect some delays but its nothing to complain about. 

I highly recommend this place, but do go early and expect to hover around the area trying to snag a parking stall. Dont worry its all so very worth it!",E2zn6jIaM30wTHVmBGBFGg,0,1,5,D5xw3k2hf4S9VAdu6rQHHg
1112423,2016-08-22,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"Food was on par with other korean restaurants. 
Sushi was also on par except for nigiri which didnt taste fresh. The rolls were good however. 
Unfortunately for this visit and despite all the great reviews i would have to end with a 3 star. The service could use improvement.

Our kbbq orders were delivered but a lot of our sushi orders were taking a long time. Somewhere in the process the orders for the second round of sushi was lost and it took our family multiple reminders to the wait staff to get our orders filled. This was an hour long process. 

My father started getting heated up, and whomever seemed to be the manager came up and clarified the order professionally and fixed the issue which is why i am up to three stars. We arent a very needy family but we felt we were left on our own a lot and for long durations. Often left  flagging down wait staff for many many things, but it did not seem like they were understaffed at the time in relation to the amount of tables and customers.

They take reservations which was a pleasant suprise and we were immediately seated. At 7pm on a sunday there was about a 30 min wait for kbbq section if one  had no reservations, which is about where the competition is at during sunday dinner.

All in all kbbq was great, nigiri dept could use a boost and customer service could be warmer and more frequent. Maybe just maybe will return but not for a while.",MYZ0elwTuCGhNbGB6_g34w,3,0,3,MbGvWSfQ_EF9ELnGgxUykQ

I've been really excited to try this place. AYCE sushi AND AYCE Korean BBQ at the same time is unheard of. It's two of my favorite food options together!

Anyways, place is very clean. The staff was attentive, but one seemed like she was having the worst day ever. You have the option of doing only one versus two. The price also changes for lunch menu versus all day menu. The have a lot of different appetizer options. We went with shrimp tempura, gyoza, and bacon wrapped asparagus. We wished we had room for the mussels. My only complaint was the tempura and gyoza didn't come with separate sauces. They have a ""no rice"" section with 3 or 4 choices. I tried the ""something special"". It includes deep fried eels, spicy tuna, and Cajun sauce wrapped in spy paper. If you like a little kick I recommend trying it. Its texture is different. Their ""Tuna Poki"" is yummy as well. They use the spicy sesame seed oil, so watch out for the creeping small fire. From the nigiri, I gave the garlic tuna a try. I didn't really care for the dried garlic as the garnish. They used a little more rice than I like, but honestly better than other places. I was sad that they didn't have the super white tuna as a choice, only the albacore tuna. They have the traditional  specialty rolls, but a lot of different takes of their own. For instance a bacon roll or the even more intriguing lobster roll. They really should look into doing half rolls.

The Korean BBQ side was delicious. They had a lot more varieties of what meats or seafood to BBQ. The dipping sauce was a way too salty though. I was sad they didn't bring out kim chi, only oi muchim. I was happy to find there was no limit for how many short ribs you're able to get. They grilled it for us this time. Sadly we didn't have room for dessert and it was too early for alcohol. I definitely recommend giving them a try.",1B-y0vJqZCDbyNjVgK6lFQ,3,2,4,eKZ1gCVuv-TZafI_aZd5nA

Its up the street from umc hospital. The service was really great. The staff was very attentive. I swear at one point there were five workers attending to us at one time to deliver our food, take away dishes, and order some more. They kept asking us if we needed anything else. The server even cooked and cut our meats for us. 

Theres three sections of the restaurant. One is the sushi bar, another is the sake room, and the kbbq room. Kbbq was delicious. The sushi was on the mediocre side when it came to taste.

1488534,2016-10-16,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"I love Korean BBQ and I love sushi.... so what's better than combining the two... all you can eat sushi and BBQ!! 

I was excited to try a new Korean place but I'm always wary because I'm from LA... and I'm also Korean. I'm picky when It comes to Korean food and it can never really compare to LA food. 

So, why the three stars? 

Mainly the service. The younger waitress was helpful and did a great job of accommodating me, but the older Korean waitress was rude and couldn't get us out soon enough. We were in there a while but we certainly didn't have our fill.

The meat was... ok. It was nothing amazing but it was good enough. The sushi, I wasn't really too fond of because it didn't really suit my taste buds. But not that it was good. 

There was ample selection and frankly a little overwhelming. I couldn't decide what I wanted because I wanted everything. They were quick about changing the grill and came by to cook the meat fairly frequently. 

What I did like is that they did have the different sauces available, but you need to ask. For true Korean BBQ people, you always ask for ssamjang. They also had my chili garlic sauce, but all of it was given only by request. Just FYI. 

I would probably return again and give it another shot. It wasn't the greatest food I've had but it wasn't the worst. And besides, it's a great place if you have friends who don't like sushi but like BBQ and vice versa.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,3,kv6pCbbUsDDCRA34sIz4nQ

And I've came before with a big party of 50 for our work party. And they did well. 
But this time it was just weird service the moment we got there. 
At the end our bill came out 300. With gratuity already added ""20%"" which should be standard of 18%. 
We gave them 180 in cash and the rest in card which is 120 right ?! But they charged our card 220. We spoke to our server and he said we only gave him 80. That we short him 100. We distinctively counted that money many times. We asked him to check again. He gives us attitude and checked again. He came back saying you guys only gave 80 and saying that we were wrong. We were trying to be understanding but he gave us Attitude making it our fault. We asked to talk to the manager he said he's busy. So we asked to count the register. He said I will check our cameras. (This took over 40 mins by the way) 

He came back the 3rd time saying alright do you want to void the cc charge. We said so were you wrong? Didn't bother to apologize right away. And it took him a couple mins to admit it. The whole time he could've handled it better by not arguing with us. Which is rude and unacceptable in this industry. All of us work in hospitality and understand to not make the customer accused. 

The owner came out and apologized but didn't offer a discount or anything but said, ""come back next time, I will take care of you""

Take couple minutes to get someone's attention to seat us down.  I want the BBQ and sushi AYCE, and my husband just want the BBQ AYCE.  We were told that both of us have to get the exact same thing.  We can either get sushi AYCE or sushi & BBQ AYCE, not one each. Since my husband knows I love sushi, we end up just getting the sushi AYCE only.  This is the second sushi AYCE I have visited in Vegas, the first one was Umiya Sushi.  I would say Umiya Sushi is much better, more rolls that I can choose from and different rolls taste different.  We got the following: porncorn, 2 SG hand roll, 2 shrimp tempura, #69, rainbow, tuna lover, what the heck, bulgogi.  I think I got the shrimp lover instead of tuna lover.  Most of the rolls taste exactly the same, too much mayo on top of the rolls.  The server shows up twice during the visit, has to wait for him to show him or flag him down when he was helping someone else.  Bulgogi was ok (a little bit too sweet for my taste, but it's soft and not chewy), not sure how good is the BBQ AYCE, I know I am not coming back for sushi for sure.

Service wasn't quite on point, and we got the feeling they were short handed for the first half of our time there.  We did have an appetizer, a side, and one bbq meat that never showed up.

Shout out to the server, Jason whom was very attentive and friendly! So unfortunate that we overheard and witnessed the other server/host talk to him so rudely.

The lady who was our main server (I believe she has red hair and wore dark eyeliner) had a huuuge attitude problem... we didn't like her vibe one bit. She was not happy, friendly or approachable. Upon asking for more banchan she would just say ""okay, yeah I know"".

The restaurant was cold... Very very cold. I guess they didn't want it too warm because of the burners on the tables but still cold is cold. Besides that it was pretty clean. But it was a little confusing as they had different rooms for different parts of the menu.... They have a sushi area for people that wanted AYCE sushi and a room with burners for people that wanted AYCE kbbq.  Ambiance 3/5

Service was a miss. It wasn't that they were bad it was just that they were very inattentive. We were sat and instead of asking us right away what we wanted... We had to wait and flag down a server and ask for meat to be brought out. One person on our table decided to get sushi as well and she had to flag down a server to place her sushi order as well. And instead of asking what sides we wanted they just brought stuff out and when we told him that we wanted more of the fried zucchini, the server told us that they didn't have zucchini...But... ummmm... It was egg battered zucchini that was pan fried. He kept on trying to say that it was cucumber. Do they not train their servers???? Service 1/5

Food.... Total miss. It wasn't that it was horrible or inedible but just the fact that nothing tasted great. All the meats that we got were tough and/or very very fatty. I love beef tongue and the ones they had their was chewy chewy chewy... Marinated bulgogi was nothing to write home about... Marinated beef chuck was eh... Sirloin was OK...Oh and one of my favorite side dishes... Steamed egg was way way over cooked. Parts of the eggs were burnt on and there was no ""soup"" at the bottom. It was the dryest steamed egg o have ever had. Food 1/5

Overall, I would not return. Nothing here made it stand out that I would come back here. There are lots of places that are closer to me and cheaper to boot with better quality meats. Definitely a pass.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,1,1,2,d2_Lt1JZC7IuyxfvKA2OZA

They also have radish wrap and lettuce upon request too.

We had ordered a lot of things during our first go, and our server forgot a few which we reordered and eventually got. Spicy garlic edamame, was meh. Tasted like they were steamed from frozen. Mushroom poppers and green onion salad was good! Steamed egg was weird and strangely ""holey,"" full of air bubbles and was rubbery. Not soft and fluffy, bf said they probably used powdered eggs. Friends ordered the cold buckwheat noodle. Said it was okay. Wasn't exactly cold, more like room temp/cool. Their pork belly is a little weird too. Not your typical strip of ""three layered"" pork.

Some of us had parked on the street in front of the apartments next to Biwon because Biwon's parking lot is very small and had no open spaces. There were NO signs anywhere that said we couldn't park on the street. After dinner, we walk out and see that 2 of our group's cars got towed. We walked back inside to ask if they knew where the cars got towed to and why they were towed and were told where the cars are and that signs were put up as we were eating... but no manager or worker went around to tell anyone in the restaurant.

(Warning: visitors from Central Florida in for a vacation) If you're Korean BBQ pros then you already know the banchan- all those little plates brought out at the beginning of the meal- helps bring life to the BBQ. Half of these items were kimchi varieties. The only big thing missing (that I've seen in other establishments) are little seasonings or sauces beyond the typical soy sauce or srirachi. On the other hand, not really necessary because...

GREAT PROTEIN CHOICES- GOOD ON THEIR OWN
We tried the Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Pork, and the Ribeye - everything tasted great. No complaints at all. I enjoyed the flavor of both Porks better (delicious especially with any of the pickled Banchan) however Hubs liked the Beef better because of the softer texture. You don't have to be a grilling pro to enjoy the meat- due to our negligence some pieces stayed on the grill longer than they should have but the servers can also help if you want.

FUN TIME WITH A GREAT PRICE
There's also all you can eat Sushi at this place (but we didn't try it) and a few different levels of Korean BBQ- the cost depends on what group of meat you want. It's totally fine to just try the lowest price option- everything was already tasty. Although the restaurant was slow during our very early lunch, the servers were very prompt and replaced our grill top as the oils got coated.

The food here is mostly quite generously portioned and the options seem endless, which is fabulous. If you can't decide between hot, sizzling pieces of bulgogi and cool, tender slices of fish atop crisp salad, fret not because here you won't have to. That being said, the sushi rice was a little off in texture, but there were a lot of delicious offerings available to make up for that. Scallop, soft shell crab, sea urchin abound. Items that are limited in the AYCE are conveniently colored red so as to be easy to distinguish. The sushi pieces were on the small side, but that's not bad when you want to save room for the mountains of meat they serve. There are rice free rolls and the one we tried, the rock n' roll, was tasty if not a little difficult to grab hold of due to being quite saucy- but let's be real here, you're getting all the grilled meats and most of the sushi you could possibly want at a VERY reasonable price so it's difficult to be too hard on them. The fish was decent, definitely adequate for the variety available (including multiple sashimi options) and freshness/quality. For the BBQ you get lots of banchan, too, as well as the option for rice- so if you're carb conscious you can easily skip it.  Even the dessert is AYCE! After stuffing ourselves silly our server was amused that we only got one scoop of ice cream for dessert...speaking of, the red bean ice cream actually has whole sweet beans in it! 

The interior was cool, quite spacious and reminded me of Korea so that's fun. 

They were really on top of the grill and water with us, offering to swap out the grill for us several times throughout our meal. No complaints there. 

I think they do charge for drinks like soda, but we drank water and our meal (with tip) was really surprisingly low. We'll definitely come back and try more of their offerings because there were too many to try this time through.

After inquiring about JUST the sushi menu we were moved to the sushi side of the restaurant. In the beginning the service was ok but slowly deteriorated as the night went on, which is baffling seeing as we were the only table on that side. No one checked on us and orders were missing. It was obvious that they paid more attention to their bbq customers. The first halibut nigiri order came out warm and some pieces shriveled.  Most of their nigiri were on the small side and the temperature was always a little warm and lacked flavor. 

We did love their oysters and the korean ice cream sandwich. They also do half orders on most of their rolls which was great. Overall this place just doesn't cut it with their sushi offering.

They separate you from your group if youre all not ordering AYCE and just want to do sushi. Or if one person doesnt want to do all you can eat and just wants Al a carte, they cant order anything. That's terrible service. If that were the case, post the rules somewhere. I read the AYCE rules and it said nothing about having to order what everyone else did. Or if you wanted to order, youd have to go sit at a different table. We came here for a celebration and my boyfriend just wanted teriyaki chicken while everyone else ordered ayce. Again, would not recommend. The service is terrible. :)",QFd7Bd8GF1H9QoMIncaWzQ,0,0,1,lmychibka3Tc2JkrIgyPpg

I thought I found a new place to go to when I want to eat kbbq and sushi. But no it was bad service. Nobody notify us that it was last call for sushi. If someone notified me then I would have ordered more -_- . Then they gave us an order of squid that has an hair on it. I called the manager attention I make a complain about none of the waiters notify me about the sushi last call. And he just charge me for kbbq. When I make a complain about a hair on the squid he just brush it off. I requested for them to just charge us the night special ($20) instead of the all day special  ($25) due to the bad service and the hair on the food. But he said no because we started ordering before 10pm.  I'm definitely going to report them to Nevada health department.  The sushi was good. But I will never be back here because of bad service and bad experience.

Biwon ONLY has one negative:  the pork belly.  Pretty bland and flavorless.  BUT the Bulgogi was by far THE best I've encountered in town!  The Kim chi was perfection.  And oh the Shrimp Poppers (double order)!  The service...I do not have enough words to speak of Devi.  Devi was intuitive:  never had to ask for refills on my tea and came before we needed to order more food, had the BEST professional yet personal attitude of any waitstaff I have ever experienced.  When I go back again, I'm sitting in her section.  We love you, Devi!  You are what made the experience fantastic!!!!

All the food was fresh and seasoned to perfection (with the exception of the pork belly).  Maybe it was just an off day.  We went for lunch and sushi.  I cannot speak to how good or bad the sushi was because I'm not a sushi fan, but the salmon on my friend's sushi appeared very fresh and almost was appetizing to even me.  The tempura was extremely tasty and who doesn't love green tea ice cream?  

Honestly, I didn't even need to upgrade to the all day option due to the extensive options available on both menus.  But I will have to one day to try out the spare ribs.  :)

Bulgogi was overly marinated, it killed the meat consistency so it was pretty mushy in your mouth. The server turned the heat too high and the other thin meat was charred in no time. Another guy came by later saying ""oh, heat is too high"".

Biwon's actual building itself is quite large.  A separate sushi bar exists but head towards the back and a large room filled with all grill-ready tables await you.    There are booths and there are tables that can hold even 10+ parties.  

During dinner, $19.99 gets you AYCE Korean BBQ; add $7 and now you have endless selection off their sushi menu including appetizers.

Biwon's meats were delicious.  My buddy and I especially liked their marinated short rib and their beef brisket and pork belly were satisfactorily good.  The brisket is always a good choice to start as it cooks fast and gives you something to eat while you wait for the thicker short ribs to cook.  Two dipping sauces (sesame oil and 'meat sauce') along with white rice compliments your carnivorous meal.  Side dishes included kim chee which was fresh, potato salad, spicy cucumber, and steamed egg.

(Just to note:  For a few additional dollars you can add Filet Mignon or Ribeye to your meal.)

I definitely ate at least quintuple the worth of my $7 sushi add-on on the appetizers alone.  Appetizers included a one-time selection of fresh oysters from Korea, crab miso soup, seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, edamame, tuna poke, and even chicken wings.

As far as sushi goes, off the nigiri list:  Garlic Tuna, Salmon, and Yuzu Yellowtail were all good.  
Rolls: Ocean Roll (lobster mix, cooked shrimp, avocado, cucumber, and screaming O sauce) was refreshing and delicious and my soft shell crab roll was large enough to fill the rest of my stomach to the brim.  Of course, I've had better sushi at places that specialize in just sushi, but not at this price.  Best $7 I've ever spent.

Desserts include your standard green tea or red bean ice cream, a red bean ice cream sandwich, or our favorite choice, Korean popsicle.  More like a crunch ice cream bar than a popsicle, an outer layer of crunchy chocolate, once bitten, reveals an inner layer filled with vanilla ice cream and strawberry sauce.  Tasty!

Definitely a place to come back to soon.  Service was exceptional with friendly and attentive staff.  Food arrived quickly and was devoured just as quick.  It's still shocking to me days later to think about how a restaurant can offer both sushi and korean bbq.

If you sit in the Korean BBQ side you have to get the AYCE BBQ and sushi. But the great thing is to add AYCE sushi, it's only $7 extra. That's a pretty great deal! The sushi menu is pretty extensive too. 

The Korean BBQ I can't really comment much just because I am  NOT a big Korean BBQ fan. I don't crave it, I don't really like it. I just go when my friends who love it go for their birthday, just like the time I came here. I did enjoy the side dishes like the salad and the tofu. 

The sushi did have a great menu but I was not all too impressed with the fish freshness. Nothing on the menu really stood out to me as far as selection not found else where. Everything looked like every other sushi place on town, and there's a lot! 

I really loved they had melon Ice cream. It was like an ice cream bar, so good. And the Korean ice cream sandwich was very delicious as well. 

For the price of the meal we had, it was pretty decent. Defiantly a great place to go with friends due to the variety. Won't be my go to place but not crossed out completely",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,9,5,3,kcMXtUwzhErI68Fz-8Efeg

I would give four stars just because of the wait and the parking! Wait for dinner on a Saturday night for a party of 7 was almost an hour and a half! The smaller parties of 2 were able to be seated without that long of a wait. So I wouldn't recommend going with a large party unless you go later at night around 10 pm. Late night all you can eat after 10 pm is also cheaper! There is limited parking area and it's very tight space! So this gives you anxiety, like me, I would carpool!

The Korean bbq is so good! My fave is the garlic beef belly! And I don't even usually eat that. The brisket sauce is so good as well! For dessert you can also get a melon bar or a chocolate crunch bar or ice cream. Service is also great!

We live out of state, but after reading a review of this restaurant, we decided to make the trip to Vegas to try it out! The menu is quite well-represented in person-- we both got the $19.95 All Day All-You-Can-Eat BBQ without sushi and it was phenomenal! I do not say that lightly, as we've tried several different BBQ restaurants throughout California and this one is definitely above the rest, especially for the price. The meat was surprisingly high quality (sometimes AYCE isn't) and the side dishes were the most authentic I've had outside of Korea. The kimchi was well-seasoned and strong enough to pair with the meat, and the  (soybean paste soup) was exactly right.

Wait to get seated was about 30 minutes for late night AYCE BBQ & Sushi.  Great deal and options for $23.95.

When ordering, BBQ items come out almost instantly, and sushi items about 5-10 minutes later.  Everything was fresh and was great quality.  Be careful, if you order ""Burn Your Bum Bum"" make sure you can handle spicy!

The inside is quite noisy but that's expected with such close tables and lots of seating.  If you go for the sushi only, you are seated in a separate area to not interfere with the grills on tables.

The marinated short ribs are a must, at least three orders needed. Pork belly and rib eye is also a must, but utilize the brisket dipping sauce they provide for anything that isn't labeled marinated because it just sets off the flavor. Shrimp poppers are soooooo goooood. The dessert is not included on AYCE BBQ so that's a bummer but you should still try the Korean ice cream sandwich cause it's fire.

First of all we came on a night that they were short a sushi chef and there was a 45 minute wait. Luckily we thought ahead to make a reservation. So we had the AYCE BBQ/Sushi (everyone at the table has to agree to get the same thing). We didn't mind that it would take time for the sushi because we were too busy enjoying our pork belly,bulgogi and sirloin! The meat was amazing! Very flavorful and tender. The side dishes were good they had a large variety. We ordered mussels,(would have liked more cheese on these) calamari, and seaweed salad for appetizers. They were okay. I ordered the red rock roll and the B2 roll. I will say that the B2 roll was very different it had coconut flakes and was kind of sweet but it really worked well! The fish on my red rock roll wasn't as cold as I would have like it. Mind you the heat from the grill didn't help. We then ordered dessert and I ordered the Korean chocolate crunch bar. OMG IT WAS SOOO GOOD!!! I want to buy a box. The service was great minus the fact that they were short handed on sushi chefs but hey I'm understanding and I was glad they told us and they were really doing a great job regardless of the fact.

3087686,2017-07-09,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"When my boyfriend and I have the ""where do you want to eat"" conversation on weekends it usually always ends up being Asian and AYCE sushi and Korean BBQ usually among the choices. A place that does both is going to get at least one visit from us. Biwon was recommended to us from a Lyft driver so we checked it out. 

It's right off the 15 on Sahara in a large building that's divided into a BBQ area, sushi area, and another offshoot dining room. We chose the BBQ area and it was decently occupied at around 6pm. We chose to do the BBQ and sushi AYCE for $28 or so (it's $7 to add on the sushi option). We ordered the bulgogi, brisket, and marinated short ribs from the BBQ side and the Boo roll, 1/2 of the Something Wrong roll and the Easy roll for sushi. Right off the bat they bring you 6 ban chan, ranging from fish cakes to pickled vegetables to noodles. They also bring a giant salad to share. I actually liked the salad a lot, the dressing was peanut-y and the lettuce was thick and hearty. 

We started off grilling the brisket, which is super thin and doesn't take long to cook. It's seasoned with salt and pepper but it was probably the blandest meat I've ever tasted. Luckily they give you a sauce to dip it in but that wasn't very memorable either. Unfortunately since it was just the two of us we had a lot of brisket to eat. They probably give you 20 pieces. We found that the crispier we cooked them the easiest it was to consume. Next up was the bulgogi which was probably the best thing we had. The marinade makes all the difference. The kalbi was two very thick pieces that you can cut up with scissors when it's done. It was somewhat fatty but decent if not a little too thick. 

I definitely would not recommend adding on the sushi option. If you want AYCE sushi do it somewhere else. The Something Wrong Roll had shrimp tempura and crab yet it was the fishiest roll I've ever eaten. The Boo was better but their cucumber outer wrapping is thin and falls apart easily. The Easy roll was the best one once we scraped off all the mayonnaise. These aren't top quality sushi rolls and it's nice to have option if you want to pig out but I would have been fine with just the meats and appetizers from the BBQ side, especially when they already give you a side of rice. 

Overall it's a good concept but not executed well. It's not the best AYCE sushi I've ever had and it's not the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. I've actually stopped going to AYCE Korean BBQ places in favor of the a la carte, higher quality places. Fortunately we didn't over do it here but you easily could and I would only recommend coming here with a large group that is looking for variety at a cheap price.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,3,Xtp2W_vT8kMVwFdy2M_N4A

The restaurant did not allow us to choose to only have sushi or only have kbbq. Which was kind of strange. My boyfriend and I only wanted sushi instead of the kbbq. But because people sitting at the same table as us were ordering kbbq, we had to pay that price even though we didn't order any. 

The food was good, but it took about 30-45 minutes each order.. and all we got was sushi.
 
Also- when I ordered food I requested Juan our waiter, that my boyfriend and I are going to have our own separate check from the rest of the guests. 
When it came down to paying, they were trying to charge me for someone else's beer! They said someone in my party didn't pay... (I was with a party of 28) That is supposed to be the server's responsibility.

Their sides are delicious but slightly on the salty side. Went in for dinner on Wednesday. Although it's a Korean BBQ restaurant, it doesn't have the Korean feel because all the workers are non-Korean. The floor manager or supervisor is Korean and can speak Korean but that's about it. It was definitely weird ordering food in English because I'm so used to ordering in Korean at Korean restaurants in LA (And no I'm not a fob.. born in the US and just bilingual). 

I like how they serve small portions of each meat order because in LA their portions for each order is huge and is overwhelming to finish it. However their quality & may taste is 5/10. But I do have to realize I've been spoiled with great quality Korean BBQ coming from Los Angeles.

Service was ok. Had to ask for everything.. instead of having it be given automatically. I think this is partially due to the fact that the workers aren't Korean and don't know the Korean food culture so for example it's not a given to bring out ssamjang  (similar to soy bean paste) when you bring out garlic and jalape√±os or sesame oil/salt& paper sauce for the meat.

I say semi because I tried BBQ before and was not a fan, but this changed my mind! I love the Korean BBQ. Best for first timer in BBQ. 
The sushi! Every single sushi that was brought was just as delicious or even more delicious than the last! 
Its truly the best of both worlds! 
I can usually stop eating in restaurants but I kept wanting to eat here! I wanted to burst with delicious flavor! 
The sauce was great! They gave two flavors and Eric was great recommending which item to which sauce. Everything was delicious. I know this place will be packed one day and Im glad to experience it before it got big. 
Thank you Eric and the owner of the place. Its truly an experience and its a place I can't wait to recommend.

After this experience, I'm not sure if I would do it again. The AYCE Korean BBQ is $23 for dinner plus another $7 if you wanna add on the AYCE sushi. They also have a late night special (after 10 pm) where they only charge you for the lunch price. 

The KBBQ portion was pretty good. They have a wide variety of meats and banchan. My favorite meats included the rib-eye (limited to one per person), beef sashimi, marinated short-ribs, shrimp, brisket, and pork belly. On the other hand, the sushi was meh. I didn't expect the sushi to be that great, but it was actually worse than I expected. The uni and sweet shrimp were some of the worst I've ever had. The rolls were actually ok. I  enjoy those baked California rolls smothered in mayo so we had a few of those.

I would have given this place 3-3.5 stars (4 stars for KBBQ and 2 stars for sushi), but the service was outstanding which is why I'm bumping them up to four. Despite how busy it was, our server was quick with our drink and banchan refills as well as bringing out the meats and sushi. 

It was odd mixing raw fish and meat, and I couldn't fully appreciate each one for what it's worth. Maybe if I tried just the sushi, it would have been better? I'm not sure. I would skip the sushi for now (unless you absolutely need/want it) and go with just the AYCE KBBQ.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,11,6,4,FHiMIA96eV9svn0MKCDMwA

3318856,2017-08-22,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"My partner wanted Korean BBQ and my sister doesn't eat meat but loves fish and sushi. I yelped this place and this was the only restaurant in Vegas that catered to both! I could be wrong but I searched a few times and nothing else but Biwon came up. So for the people that aren't into fish and are into meats can come here and the same for non-meat eaters. Why I gotta be in the middle and figure out stuff? :/ But in the end we all satisfied our hungry bellies. Everybody is happy! 

We didn't make a reservation and there's parking in the back area. This restaurant is huge and is in two parts, the sushi area on the left when you first walk in and the Korean BBQ grills and tables in the back area. My sister lives here and had no clue about this place so I am glad she now knows and she loves to support new businesses! 

Prices are very reasonable for lunch on Sunday, Aug. 20th and includes so many items, from meats to appetizers and Korean ice cream sandwiches! Yummmm!

When we sat down they already had all the fixins' ready on the table and big bowl of salad. The bbq grills were nice and hot (even more so than the Gen BBQ in Torrance) the server was very attentive and he even changed out the grill when we ordered more meats. Even other servers walking by would take our empty plates. 

It cost extra if you want the better meats but still worth it and definitely cheaper than LA/LB Korean BBQ restaurants. We were happy with our brisket, bulgogi, marinated pork and chicken. Sushi was also very good, they have a huge selection of rolls you can choose from AND if you ask nicely, you can order half rolls so you can try as many as you life! 

Some items were marked in red on and that wasn't included with the sushi/BBQ price but it's not a big deal. The corn cheese appetizer is interesting, I never had that before. It comes out on a sizzling platter.  

This place wasn't that busy when we got here but it did fill up shortly after. I will definitely come here as many times as I can whenever I visit my sister.

The appetizer gyoza tasted better than the grape sized shumai - but both didn't taste very fresh.  The soy bean paste soup was delicious and you can't really mess up the steamed egg.

When we walked in we weren't greeted by anyone right away.  A guy finally approached us and asked if we wanted sushi or BBQ... I thought it was both so I was confused. So I asked him if we could have both and he said ""ok"" and was looking for menus. He seemed a little confused and continued on by saying he was ""just a bus boy"" and doesn't normally seat guests. First of, in a team effort to build a successful establishment, you are not entitled to just your ""job title"" and at the very least, don't let it show or be known to your guest. 

We got seated and the menu seemed overwhelming but in a good way.  There were a lot of options to choose from. We ordered from both the sushi and bbq menu, and I'd list them but its too much to name.

In the grand scheme of things, the quality of this place is NOT there at all.  The meat and sushi quality did not do it for me to the point where after my first order was placed, I did not order anymore.

I was feeling sushi when I went, so opted for just AYCE sushi. There were only two sushi chefs initially, and they seemed a bit overwhelmed between the sushi-only patrons and making all of the sushi orders for people having Korean barbecue. Even though I sat at the bar, it took quite some time for all of my various sushi orders to be made. They eventually added a third sushi chef, but this is definitely still an area for improvement.

As for the sushi itself, it was not bad, pretty standard for AYCE sushi. I don't remember anything wow-ing me, or anything really standing out as unique. The price was typical for AYCE sushi, and I enjoyed my meal.

Service again was good and I was checked on appropriately, but it could be hard to flag down a waitress for non-sushi orders (appetizers, water) and again, the sushi itself was made slowly, not exactly ideal when there is a 90-minute time limit.

Steamed eggs, and miso were pretty good... also nice that other people in my party could add ayce sushi for $7.00 more, and we all didn't have to also... we just couldn't ""share"" - which was fine. The only thing that really bugged me was our waitress. She was super rude, and lacked in the customer service skills department. There was another younger woman who was really nice, and kept our glasses of water full... if they work on their waiting staff, I'm sure I'd give them a better rating, but I just cant because of that. I don't think we are the only table that complained about it... although I didn't mention anything to management while we were there, my nosy self did hear another table complaining about her. So in short, the food is good, and if you don't mind having the waitress give you some dirty looks or be bothered to bring you some more meat, then give them a try!",PQRsR4DJM1cmLgCdZT9Lhg,0,0,3,f1nulgZSrxNU8xM3tDS8WA

My family and I returned to Biwon last week & the food was delicious yet again. The only thing I like to point out is Francisco is an awesome waiter! To me he holds that whole place together! All the other staff there is ok, not outstanding... But if Francisco is your waiter, tip him well cuz that man works hard 



Almost 5 stars! Hit most of the marks for me

1. Not hot! Hate eating when it feels like a sauna. 

2. Good selection!

3. The staff was awesome & very attentive!

Only thing that wasn't the best was the nigiri. It wasn't as cold as I like. Kind of warm?

Ambiance- nothing out of the ordinary. Clean place and you can definitely tell they just opened. Very friendly. We were greeted as soon as we walked in as well as the minute we walked out.

Service- our server was very attentive. No point in our experience that we have to look for him just to order. He cleans up our table quickly to make more room for food. He made small conversations with us as well.

Food- we did the all you can eat kbbq and sushi lunch. For sushi, fish was fresh! I definitely love their nigiris. We had a couple of garlic tuna and that was my favorite. I also ordered what the heck roll which was really good. Appetizers from the sushi menu is different from the kbbq even though they have the same name on each menu. for example, the jalape√±o popper from the sushi menu is different from the kbbq menu so keep that in mind. For kbbq, the marinated sliced rib eye was my favorite meat! We got the brisket but it was okay nothing special. We also got delicious marinated pork. What lost their 5 star review for me was the steamed egg. It was not cooked thoroughly and there were parts of my egg that was grey. Why grey? Idk, I didn't really want to ask. I don't want 1 bad egg ruin how much I like their food. I just set it aside.

We had a choice a All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi or AYCE Korean BBQ, I said both, which was $30 per person. Normal AYCE sushi places average $25-$30 so price is excellent comparison. We ordered the same time Mel took our drink orders, they are so fast that our 4 food orders came out before we had silverware and small platters. The Nigiri portion was better than average, meaning the rice ball was smaller cause we all know that the more rice we eat, the faster we get full. The Nigiri slice were above average so overall the fish to rice ratio was better than most places. Didn't try much specialty rolls but sure took advantage of the bbq options. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because no loyalty stamp card, no communication between staff as each time they didn't know if we were AYCE sushi/ AYCE BBQ/Both or/Ala cart, and we had to ask when the grille will be on the fire to put the food on it and once they got that, we had to ask for the silver ware to cook and eat our food after the grille was on the fire.

The real issue that we experienced was that we were unable to finish all of the meat that we ordered (we ordered too much!). So we understood that we are expected to pay for what we could not finish. 

We had to ask the staff for the check 4 times!!! The same server asked us if we needed something twice when we had already asked for the check. 

When it came to determining how much extra they were charging for the unfinished meat, they were totally frazzled! They were all conversing and calling someone in the phone with confused expressions, as if no one ever had food leftover. I guess that's why they were unable to present a check all those times we asked for it.

You can order right with the sushi maker if he isn't slammed but there also is a server you can pass your requests too and he will write it down on a slip for the maker. We definitely got our money worth of the roughly $26 cost of all you can eat.
I look forward to trying the bbq side but I will definitely go there again for the sushi. Probably nearing 40 sushi options if I can remember right. Maybe I was too excited and I inflated the number but it seemed like a lot of options. I def recommend going there.

I'm starting to think that a lot of these 5 star reviews have to do with the fact that you get a free soda or sake if you leave a review on here...hmmmmm.

The place itself is actually very spacious and it's hard to miss when driving. When you come in a person will ask if you will be having kbbq, sushi or both. Of course we said both! Like come on kbbq and sushi AT THE SAME TIME!? Can't get that anywhere else here that I know of lol. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our orders.

For kbbq we started with two orders of brisket. There was a couple behind us who was seated after us and received their kbbq meats before us (different waiter). I was trying to keep my cool because I was getting hungry haha. 5 mins pass, still no meat. I think our waiter finally realized that our table was still pretty empty aside from the kbbq sides so he came back and asked if we wanted anything from the kbbq -____- I told him that we were waiting on our brisket and he acted like we were just ordering it now so I guess they just completely forgot about our brisket to begin with :( Well when the brisket finally came, all was good. I would give it a 2/5 for quality and taste. It was very bland and nothing like the briskets I had at other kbbq restaurants. I ended up just drowning it in this sweet dipping sauce our waiter gave us. It was season with a black pepper which I guess is their thing here because I noticed the other meats we ordered later was also seasoned with black pepper. Eh I don't even know how to really describe other than it just tasted odd so I was very disappointed because I usually order 4 plates minimum!

Later on we ordered the beef chuck, bulgogi, beef tongue and pork belly. Again, the taste was just not there for me. Just very bland. The bulgogi was probably my favorite out of all the meats we ordered. I didn't really like the pepper all over my pork belly either because it was so coarse. 

For our sushi portion we ordered a bunch of nigiri: uni, unagi, garlic tuna, sweet shrimp, scallop and salmon. Uni and garlic tuna was good, they give you a small piece of roasted garlic on the tuna. Everything else was ok, not the best but not terrible. We also had some oysters, and my friends had a few rolls which was also ok.

I did like how dessert was also included! I tried the melon bar and it was delicious.

Overall service was 4/5. Our waiter was attentive and changed out our grill whenever it was burning. The other tables waiter also came to us a few times to help cook some meat and also gave us scissors to cut the pork belly since our waiter forgot. Food was 3/5 for me which I really hate leaving that kind of rating because the service was good but I just didn't like the taste as much. I still think I would come back though to try other stuff on the menu and who knows, maybe the brisket will be better the second time around :)",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,4,4,3,b-mJZgzRtqbj1D_hQf7UYQ

Their menu has a good amount of stuff for both kbbq and sushi. Their sides were pretty good, but I felt like the sushi and meat wasn't. The sushi wasn't fresh and the meat quality is poor. Also our server was not nice. He did come over and ask if wanted to order more food, but the way he spoke to us it was rude. He acted like he didn't want to be there to take our order.

Servers lack experience or passion for their job. When we asked to send back the overly sauced sushi our server simply said ""i cant send it back because its already been made"".....I sat for a split second after hearing his response in disbelief....but i politely asked him if there was a manager on duty.

Came for my boyfriends bday with some friends and left with a very happy tummy! Pricing is very reasonable as well... $28 for dinner ayce kbbq AND sushi.. not bad at all. 

The one thing that kind of threw me off is if you're going with a group you all need to be on the same page whether you want to do the ayce kbbq or ayce sushi (if your intentions aren't to do both). Some of my group wanted to do both and some of my group just wanted just the sushi but unfortunately then we would be split up for seating because the ayce sushi is on the left side and the ayce kbbq is on the right side. Everyone sitting in the kbbq side MUST pay the ayce kbbq price and then it's just an additional $7.00 to add the ayce sushi (as I mentioned earlier.. it's $28 for both). I personally think it's just worth it to do both.

The kbbq salad that you start off with could be a little better since thats one of the things I look forward to eating when we eat kbbq. But aside from the salad, everything was just sooooo good. Food was bomb! And the variety of desserts they have.... BOMB!! I do recommend you save room for the desserts because that was like the best part to top off dinner.. that waffle ice cream sandwich they have is LIFE.

To me, nothing really stood out... They don't give you any of the good stuff for lunch; Sweet Shrimp (Ama ebi), Sea Urchin (Uni) or Scallops (Hotategai) even though the menu actually says Limit one per order instead of only available for dinner. 

While the sushi was fairly good, I can't think of anything that was outstanding. A couple things I ordered were a big let down. The Steamed egg was very disappointing...one of the worst I had. I usually love this dish, here it lacked flavor; was bland and lacking other ingredients like mushrooms that usually complement this dish. The other let down was an order or Popcorn shrimp; the shrimp itself was OK, but they came on 4 California Rolls. Um...what?! Nowhere does it say the shrimp came on California Rolls. I didn't want those...a waste of space, like Biwon wanted me to finish those so I can't order more? A bit shady I thought. IMHO there are several better places for AYCE sushi in Sin City.

The meat for the Korean BBQ was delicious. We got the brisket, short ribs, mignon, rebeye & shrimp. The great thing is you can order Sushi so while you wait for your meat to cook, you have something to munch on. It's always a must ""steamed egg"" when you do Korean BBQ but for some reason this was more on the dry side. I really didn't enjoy it. They only had 2 types of dipping sauce.   

I order a couple of nigiri; Salmon, Garlic Tuna, shrimp & yellowtail. They were really yummy!!! I order some sushi rolls as well but I can't remember the name of them. They were alright. Nothing to die for. 

Desert was yummy. I was looking forward in trying out their crunchy bar but they were out  I ended up just have a Korean popsicle and I liked it.

Service here is so bad that you literally have to watch forna sever to appear and wave your hands up straight and flag down your server (they avoided eye contact with customers) for more food.

My biggest fear going into this was the sacrifice of quality because I imagined only one out of the two options being good as that is what typically happens when you pair up two ""AYCE"" giants. After my visit, I can definitely say I was surprised. 

To start things off, I really thought both the quality of the meats and the sushi were pretty high up there. I wouldn't go as far to say that either was amazing, but it was definitely good for a restaurant that offers both in an AYCE setting. Not only that, but the price for both to be included was more than affordable ($21.00 for the basic menu). I do have to say that the highlight for the KBBQ was the brisket, while the highlight for the sushi was the garlic tuna (which featured a garlic chip on top of the tuna; very unique in comparison to other AYCE sushi allocations). With the meal you are also give the traditional small Korean dishes and the house salad that you would receive at any other AYCE KBBQ location, which was a nice touch. 

The only word of critique that I would really offer is to have more staff on duty. We were sat in a separate room, which seemed to hold everyone else who decided to dine in that day (the restaurant had several different rooms for seating). While all of the tables were concentrated into this one room, I would have imagined at least a few servers (minimum 2) to be attending to all of these tables. Instead, there was only one server attempting to tend to everyone's needs. Another word of advice that falls into this same category is for the lone server to at least carry a notebook to write her orders on. There was actually a point during our meal where the server forgot our items twice and on the third try, she brought out the wrong item. Honestly at that point, I didn't feel the need to ask for the correct order because I was already too full. 

All in all, this place is very nice if you have a craving for both KBBQ and sushi. Be aware that you will probably get full though before you can truly enjoy everything that you want, but that is also a testament to how tasty everything was.

KRBBQ: Best Galbi I've had period. Beautiful on the bone/ uncut/ heavily marbled/ well marinated short rib. Other stand out cuts were the marinated rib eye / thick slabs of pork belly. 

Sushi: Woah! no rice rolls were delicious (only 1 per person, but there are 4 different kinds)

Etc: Along with KRBBQ/Sushi they also have appetizers from poki / tataki / chicken wings / yakatori / and fresh Oysters! Everything we ordered was exceptional, the menu was huge and a little overwhelming. We wanted to try soo much more food, but got stuffed from everything listed above. 

Service: Really solid, prompt, took on our crazy orders with no issue. Did a really good job of spacing out the food orders so that the table wouldn't get too crazy. KRBBQ+Appetizers+Sushi takes up a lot of table space but they made it worked.

Location: Interior looks like most other KBBQ joints and is very spacious, with a sushi bar separate from the rest of the restaurant. Be wary about parking. The lot is very small. Parking can be quite a hassle so be prepared if it gets busy.

Food: Lunch (11AM-3PM) and late night (10PM-3AM) prices are $16.95 for ACYE KBBQ. It is an additional $5 for ACYE sushi, but only for lunch. ""All Day"" prices are $19.95 and $7 extra for ACYE sushi. If you just want sushi, lunch is $21.95 and the rest of the day is $26.95. 

There are a ton of options to choose from, with a great variety. Quality of the food is decent, but nothing to be amazed about. However, I think the freshness of the sushi was lacking. Do note that a portion of the menu - everything in red - is not available for lunch and sushi is not available at all in their late night prices.

Service: Nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about. Every time I had gone, the servers were rarely available if you were not ordering or getting delivered food. However, they were more than accommodating when flagged down.

Overall, this place is a decent option if you can't choose between KBBQ and sushi. It is definitely worth the price. This isn't my go-to place, but I wouldn't mind dining here once in a while.",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,2,1,3,AdWU2kf8SH_Wj6qczZAU_g

They refused to allow us, again being the only people in the restaurant and we were sitting at the sushi bar, to split our orders.  They said that too many people cheat and eat from the all you can eat customers.  I eat a decent amount of sushi and I have never been refused this request.

4152791,2017-02-01,1,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"Whenever I go to Vegas, there eventually comes a point where you no longer want to eat hotel buffets for $30+ per meal, because it's not very economical, I don't want to gain 40 lbs., and frankly they all eventually begin to taste the same.  So what do my friends and I decide to try out?  A buffet.

To it's credit, Biwon is a Korean BBQ, which means you pay money and then get as much meat as you can eat.  But it's not the same bland prime rib, four types of potatoes, chicken wings and piles of browning leaves called salads slathered in ranch dressing hidden behind a sneeze guard at a hotel packed to the brim of people determined to stuff their faces silly to soak up thirteen yards of margaritas.

I can't really speak for the location since I'm not local, but it was fairly easy to get to off of the Strip utilizing an Uber to get my party there.  The one drawback to going off Strip for tourists is that if you run into a wait, like was the case with my friends and I, there's not always a convenient plan B to fall back onto, or immediately walk away towards.  Despite the size of Biwon, they're kind of a segmented establishment; upon entering, immediately to the left is the sushi restaurant, immediately to the right is kind of a bar/lounge type, and the back room is the BBQ restaurant.  Needless to say, neither of these segments are particularly large, so despite the fact that it looked like a large restaurant when we arrived, we still had to deal with a 45 minute wait for a table in the BBQ restaurant to open up.

Regardless, after we were seated, service was fairly decent.  One important thing groups should be aware of is that Biwon has a policy that everyone at the table gets the same dining plan.  So everyone in your group needs to be on the same page to what everyone's getting, otherwise, there might be some salty vegan who's not happy about having to pay $25 for meat they're not going to eat.

Meats are ordered, and portions are brought to your table, where you cook them yourself over a tabletop grill.  I will say that Biwon is the first KBBQ joint where the servers don't try and take over the cooking at the table, meaning you are entirely on your own when everything starts coming out.  I'm not sure if I liked this hands off approach, but I also wondered what I was paying for, if not a little bit of service.  Banchan (sides) were never refilled throughout the meal, and everything extra was kind of nickel and dime-y for my tastes.

Oh, and despite the advertised all you can eat, Biwon supposedly has this policy where such is the case - for 90 minutes.  It wasn't entirely clarified, but I interpret it as I can eat as much as I want, but for only 90 minutes, and if for chance that I go over that, even with my group of six, our meals are over.  This is definitely the first time I've ever encountered that kind of policy.

Fortunately, all of the meat is well seasoned and tasted good; after all, we cook it ourselves, and I've got plenty of experience cooking my own KBBQ, and ultimately my party and I ended up pleasantly stuffed, and not full of crappy Total Rewards hotel buffet quality food.

Overall, Biwon is definition 3-stars: A-OK.  The price is OK, the service is OK, and the food is OK.  All of them _could_ be better, but here we stand.  I will say it was a good experience getting off the Strip for a change, but I know Vegas has a ton of dining options away from the tourist areas, and I can't say that Biwon is high on my opinion for a second chance any time soon.",uq_xDJi7cmZ9wLE8v3X4Bg,0,0,3,MjSL-carahE1x9tlHhRwhg

This is a huge restaurant! They have separate section for sushi vs Korean BBQ. So if you are there just for sushi you won't get smoked out! Lol. 

So my husband often complaint when I want to eat Korean BBQ because sometimes the meat is not what we are expected or the pricing can be super expensive at times! But Biwon have changed all of that! The price for lunch is $18 and some change and dinner is $22 and some change. And if you want to do AYCE sushi on top of AYCE Korean bbq is only $5 more! Talk about a lot of food though!! 

Meat quality is pretty amazing! And just tons of it! They are not stingy at all with their portion for sure!! We took one picture not sure why lol. But this is my husbands favorite which is the beef brisket! And he ordered 3 portion of this! And the meat next to it is the pork belly which we can do without! But it's also a very good quality! And huge green tea ice cream for desert too! 

Service is pretty on point! You never have to look around for them! They come to your table to make sure that the grill is hot enough and that you have enough food!! they are very attentive!

If you love meat and are feeling hungry but don't want to spend too much, this is the place for you.

They also have a menu to order off of with a lot of different side dishes (rice paper, kimchi, pickled veggies) and even options like ice cream and gyoza. 

At first, the service was slow in getting us our meat and rice paper (apparently they had to make a new batch?) but sure enough we were able to eat until we were full without being kicked out for exceeding any sort of time limit. The meat quality seemed to be fine as well and the servers stopped by and checked in every once in a while.

We first ordered Pork Belly, Pork Brisket, Pork Shoulder, and Miso Pork. They have various appetizers you can order, I ordered Takoyaki and Steamed Egg. Usually the inside of the Takoyaki is really hot since all the heat is inside, but Biwon's Takoyaki wasn't burning hot like I'm use to when eating Takoyaki.

They also offer Corn Cheese, which is like the name, stretchy cheese and corn. It goes well to mix your meat with the cheese. They actually have lettuce where you can wrap your meat in.

She didn't ask all the patrons at the table what they wanted to drink and was just really cold and treated us as if we were prisoners. She constantly watched over us as if we were going to steal something and was literally standing behind us watching us eat. 

She only came by twice to ask if we were ok, never offered refills, and if we asked for anything she made is seem as though we were asking for the world. 

On the menu it says free ice cream or soda with Yelp check in. When I advised Lee about this she stated it's only if I leave a positive ""good"" review. I was a little bothered by that because that's not how Yelp works. I advised I would go ahead and leave a review and she wanted to see it. So I firstly wrote the other review, because I promised the little guy we were with some ice cream. Though truly this place deserves less than 1 star. 

The WORST part, besides being treated like trash, is that they charged us for INFANTS because she saw ""the baby eat a leaf of lettuce and a few pieces of rice"" Our party was 4 adults, 2 infants, and a 2 year old (who we had to pay $11 for even though they don't charge for 2 year olds) they put an auto grateful of $17 because there were more than 6 PEOPLE.

If you like lobster, get the baked sweet lobster roll. Will definitely go back if we go back to Vegas.",vXJY0NFoGjWkCZqiJq5KKg,1,0,5,34s6jH_2MtsiiKk8BYXA1A

Their brisket was good. That was the main thing we ordered. I did order some of their spicy pork and I wasn't crazy about it. Their kimchi wasn't great at all. I've definitely had better. The place was clean, spacious, and nicely decorated but overall I wasn't too impressed by the food. The staff was accommodating but other than that they didn't really interact with us much. 

I don't believe this would be some place I would return to. Just because there so many other places that have better quality meats and larger variety in sides to choose from.

The location is a little bit sketch, but the food makes it worth it. I'd also recommend dressing in light clothing since it tends to stay pretty warm in the dining room during the summer.

On our most recent visit, the boo and I shared the bulgogi (5/5), marinated pork (5/5), brisket (3/5), your name roll (3/5), shrimp poppers (4/5), and the B2 roll (4/5). My favorite out of everything was the bulgogi. It was so perfectly seasoned and delicious.

You also get a free scoop of ice cream at the end, which they also added to the menu!!

Prices; it is $28 each for all you can eat sushi and BBQ. It is $10 for each child. We had a party of four adults, three children, and one infant. The total came to $150. About the price I expected! 

At the end of the sitting, we all got a Korean ice cream sandwich. We literally thought we'd have to unwrap the ice cream sandwich like we always do. Nope! The ice cream sandwiches were hand made there and DELICIOUS!

What's makes this worse is that this restaurant actually had good reviews on yelp. The waiter never introduced himself. No one cleared the table once. When they dropped off food instead of clearing the trash they just moved it over and placed the food on the table. I actually had to grab trash and ask where a garbage can was because I had 6 empty cans of soda in front of me plus dirty napkins. My brother ordered rice twice and never received it. Every time we asked a server for something it seemed as though we were bothering him. One time I asked the waiter over to the table and the waiter looked right at me and ignored me. To top it all of the overhead hood fan didn't even work so my brother and I were sitting in a smokescreen the whole night. I definitely do not recommend coming here with a group of 6 or more or at all. It seemed as though because they add 18% auto gratuity to big parties they paid less attention to us because they had a tip no matter what. I my self work in the service industry and have not seen anything like this before. This experience ruined my brothers birthday. People may read this and say oh they were just busy but the sad truth was that it wasn't. I had every intention to speak with a manager but I was to upset and didn't want to make a scene or say something I would regret. My hope is that the management of this restaurant read this and train there staff on customer service and cleanliness of the tables they are serving.,kzhj33gO-1ZjTl5pxsrKlQ,0,0,1,Wp4NVDR4zEH4T67riYzskA

I have eaten a lot of Korean bbq at a number of different restaurants, the assorted meats were all excellent and marinades delicious, as good as any I have had. Sides were all good, fish cakes were absolutely awesome.  

Took probably 20 minutes for our sushi to come out and every piece was good.  Second order of sushi came out faster.

Beer was cold and reasonably priced, service friendly.

It was my buddies first exposure to Korean bbq and he loved it.

I have nothing at all to say negative about the experience.  I am somewhat relieved that the place is 2000 miles away, otherwise I'd likely be there way more then I should.

You could easily have a great dinning experience here doing either bbq or sushi seperate but given how inexpensive it is to combine both and seeing how I love both, the bbq /sushi combo was clutch.

If your in vegas and looking for Korean bbq and or sushi in a very non-touristy/ non-vegas strip sort of restaurant, Biwon is the place.

No worry about having a LATE meal, sign said open till 3AM.

Last night I got off work late and wanted sushi so I decided to finally come. The restaurant is hidden right off of Sahara next to the palace station. I like that it closes at 2:00 am. I loved how spacious it was inside and the decor was really nice and authentic looking. They have 2 sides one for the sushi and one for the BBQ. I was hungry so I went with the ayce. For my appetizer I ordered the spicy garlic edemame, I didn't care for the flavor and it was too greasy. Skip that. The baked mussels were delicious! I loved the shrimp poppers, they were very flavorful and filled with crab inside. I had trouble deciding on which roll I wanted so my friend told me to try the panic roll which is her absolute favorite. I liked them but wasn't in love. I also got the Japanese lasagna and those rolls were good. The chef was very friendly and super fast with all of my orders. It's $21 for the lunch ayce and $26 for the dinner.  Overall I was satisfied and I'll come back to try the BBQ.",y4xrOPXEB75lJaLjr7Rtaw,6,5,4,aTtmM7-wmEMky2QPx9xU5Q
4911050,2018-01-12,1,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"We came here for my husband's birthday. He was not quite sure whether he wanted sushi or Korean barbecue and ended up getting both. When they told us it was going to be around $30 each for the all-you-can-eat of both, we almost wept for joy. (Have I mentioned before that we're foodies?) This is insanely reasonable.

Our server, Linda, admitted she was new, but she was attentive and amazing. I think she's going to do very well here. Hubby got Soju for the first time since he actually was in Korea with military. It was divine; they went out of their way to get a really good brand and the price was very reasonable.

Food kept coming. And we kept eating. I wish I had 5 stomachs. There was not a bad bite in the bunch. From the Washington roll to their homemade cucumber kimchi, everything was absolutely incredible. We tried at least one type of each meat: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, even squid. The squid was bloody amazing!

They gave us a generous portion of salad that started us off right. The dressing is inspired by God.

We will definitely be back. Possibly every payday, lol.",OueXAik2P-eUcXbd1qGXKw,2,1,5,sIyF0dsz0p9O953lze5Ahw

4923602,2016-12-20,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"I love KBBQ and sushi, and when I say love them, I mean I could eat both every day if I could afford it. Also getting fat would be a bummer. When I found this gem on Yelp while passing on the Heart Attack Grill (fast food cooked in lard? no thanks), I lightweight freaked out and knew what had to happen.

***Location/Wait***

The place is located off-strip. We took an uber from DTLV, and it took about 10 minutes. I want to say the place is also about 10-15 minutes of strip by car also, but you will probably want to google it. We got there around 5:30 pm for dinner, since we had a flight to catch around 8pm. There was basically no wait, since we came before the dinner rush. But it did seem as it got closer to 7pm-8pm people were waiting at least 10-15 minutes.

***Service***

The service was definitely fast. I would hope so since we were only one of 3 groups eat at the time. We were constantly checked up on for either water or for more orders of food. Orders came out relatively quick as the servers got into the zone. That may sound a little weird, but our first plates came out a little slower. The more we ordered, the faster they came out. Overall service was excellent. I can't speak for when they're really busy.

***Menu/Price***

The menu. THE MENU. Well we decided to go with both AYCE sushi and kbbq because it was only $7. I personally justified it as if I ate the oysters and uni, it basically paid for itself. Oh quick note, it was only one order of uni and oyster per person unfortunately. There were so many options on the sushi menu that included poke, various fried and baked rolls, basic sushi with all the fishes that you would typically order (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, etc.). The whole sushi menu is massive, and it would take me forever to explain it. You will have to look at pictures of the menu to see.

On the kbbq side, the menu isn't as expansive as let's say Gen in California. The menu has all the essentials such as brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, and spicy pork. They also served kalbi and pork jowl which is rare at least for me. Again, you will want to look at a picture of the menu to see it fully, but the types of meats definitely satisfied me. The side dishes were also typical, but what surprised me was they had no rice paper (yo like wtf that's essential).

***Food***

Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best judge of meat and fish quality, but I thought Biwon's was decent. It was definitely the best I ever had, but it was still pretty damn delicious. The brisket never got too dry and was tender overall. My favorite was definitely the kalbi. It was tender and the marinade was awesome. It was my first time having pork jowl, and I definitely enjoyed the texture and taste of it. It was a pretty standard kbbq taste. It wasn't anything mind blowing, but definitely worth the $20 for all you can eat. I would give the sushi a 4/5.

The sushi was also above average. The fish was not the freshest, but definitely still tasty. I really enjoyed the uni and oysters. I always order them since I know they're the most expensive, but as I said only one order per person. I do not remember the rolls we ordered since my friends ordered them, but I enjoyed them too. I would give the sushi a 4/5.

***Overall/TLDR***

Overall this place does not have the best food, but since we have the option for both it definitely made the experience more enjoyable. Atmosphere was nice. Definitely a great hidden gem in Vegas if you're ever sick of eat on the strip. It might be a little pricey, but for the options you get, it's definitely worth it. I mean you're in Vegas, so you should expect to spend.",cdJlXTezyBLmvjFD7N-aow,1,0,5,kV6OgEba6o8jBA8YuPAsmA

I thought it was a cool idea, having both kbbq and sushi in one place, but I think a place is better off specializing in one thing or another.

The ribeye wasn't too good or seasoned well either. 
Onto the sushi side, it was alright. Nothing really stood out, and the rice for the sushi felt a little tough.

My meat came out later than the sushi my girl ordered.

They have lots of lunch and dinner AYCE specials, for either Korean barbecue or sushi. We have always opted for Korean barbecue. It costs $17.95 per person for the lunch AYCE, which includes about 10 (give or take) different meats, and a bunch more side dishes. We haven't tried dinner here yet. 

This last visit we ordered bulgogi, marinated pork, and brisket. For sides we got gyoza, and chicken wings. They also bring all of their standard kimchee sides, rice, and salad. For two people, it's a good amount of food and will fill you up.(If you over order, they charge you a la carte prices for leftover food). Everything was delicious! Meat was fresh, and sides were hot. 

Two reasons why they lost a star: service is sometimes a little off (but of course it depends on how busy they are), and they charge you for each individual drink - no refills, even on soda/lemonade. These can really add up at $1.50 each so we usually get a drink each, then water after we finish.

We all choose the Korean BBQ Buffet and the first comment is that the meat is of decent quality.  Even the top sirloin is marbled and tender, my best guess is that it's at least USDA choice grade.  Wished the rib eye was not limited to one per person, I would order it all night long.  The beef brisket is sliced very thin and leaving it in the grill till it's cooked to the point of being burnt is our favorite way to eat this.

Immediately the hostess was kind and attentive. She wanted to seat our group once everyone arrived, one girl was missing, so she had us sit at the sushi bar to order drinks. Very kind of her. 

The food was okay. Some of the dishes just weren't appetizing. 

We mainly ordered from the sushi side which most of the food came to the table very very slowly. Some dishes didn't reach the table at all and somehow the chef still had time to prepare a roll ""on the house"". It was very kind of him, but we didn't really want it by the time it arrived. Most of the sushi prepared were just okay in taste. 

We ordered brisket, beef and pork belly along with some sides for KBBQ. Meat wise we only got the brisket and all else were forgotten, except somehow they tried to give us marinated chicken, marinated pork, and other marinated meats. Which none of us enjoy eating marinated meats at a KBBQ so that was not our order. 

The wait staff were kind to us, but weren't very attentive. When we asked for certain side dishes or even a mug for beer, we would have to flag them down a second time to remind them we ordered or asked for ""x"" thing. I think the staff may of been overwhelmed. Maybe they were extremely short staffed. Maybe there was a huge flux of people, which is doubtful since we saw maybe two or three tables occupied other than us. I can't really say since the wait staff, although kind, weren't very communicative.

First and foremost, lets talk price.  
All you can eat sushi AND Korean BBQ...$30 a piece at dinner.  You cannot beat that price.  

The spot is clean, and let me tell you...it smells amazing, even outside.  

We had great service.  I think our server's name was Demi?  She was awesome, and explained everything that we had questions about. 

We had all of the normal sides:  dikon salad, noodles, fish cake, cucumber kimchi (omg amazing), bean paste, and some kind of meat dipping sauce that I wanted to drink.  

Korean BBQ items:
brisket:  thin, delicious.
green tea pork belly:  really nice!  Good flavor
Butter and garlic squid:  mmmm.  I love calamari, and this was great.
garlic beef belly:  pretty yummy.  We crisped mine up like bacon.  It was great.
shrimp:  perfect
bulgogi:  favorite BBQ item of the night.  So rich and flavorful.
pork jowls: not our favorite, but we had to try it, since we'd never had it before.
spicy baby octopus:  really good.  We accidentally overcooked the head, but the tentacles were perfect.  

Sushi items: 
Scallop:  perfection
Cajun albacore: excellent:  perfect amount of spice
Unagi:  good! Not as well done as we asked for, but still good.
Garlic tuna:  amazing.
Tako:  excellent
Yuzu Yellowtail: favorite of the night.  This was perfection.  

We also had the gyoza, which are the best gyoza I've had out to date.  

Super happy with the service and the food. I could do with items being brought out just a tiny bit faster, but it wasn't a huge deal.

The food is good. Shrimp popper was good even though there was barely any shrimp. It was more imitation  crab meat. The chicken wings were really tiny, it was kinda weird. The sauce a bit spicy and was overall okay (I'll probably skip that next time)

The service was good. The servers were attentive. 
You have the option to do AYCE KBBQ/ Sushi or both. I don't like sushi, but in my opinion if you do Sushi  and KBBQ- that's a whole lot of food.

The food tastes really good and their meat is high quality. They had AYCE option that included a large sushi menu for no additional charge. First time finding an authentic Korean BBQ All You Can Eat + All You Can Order Sushi.  They also had udon on the AYCE if you're in the mood for soup and noodles. Steamed egg, tofu soup, and more! Also get the ""Korean Ice Cream Sandwich"" which is red bean with vanilla ice cream and mochi...so yummy.... also have ice cream in green tea and sesame flavors. The exterior of the building is an appealing traditional Korean style structure. Interior was spacious looks like would be accommodating for large groups. We went early so there was no wait. The staff from the host to the waitress and buss boys were all extremely friendly, quick, and attentive. We ordered a variety of meats including tongue, galbi, and brisket. The side dishes are plentiful and flavorful. Also order sashimi salad which kind of reminds me of ahi poke and comes in small portions. We also ordered the Ellen roll which is spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber, and I think avocado... that was really good. I think I definitely ate my money's worth because of the sushi menu. Also just 10 minutes away from the North Las Vegas Outlet which is where we went to next to walk off all the food. Most importantly, the price was extremely reasonable and I would recommend it to all my friends going to Las Vegas.

What did it for us was both sushi and Korean BBQ was AYCE.  The other places I found or looked at were just for the BBQ.  And the price was right so we ventured and we were glad we did.  Korean BBQ + Sushi AYCE for $27!  Food was fresh.  Wait staff were pleasant and responded pretty quickly.  And dessert included.  YAY.  There's a huge selection of meats- some of which we can't get back home on an AYCE menu so it was fun to try new things.  The marinated pork was a pleasant soft surprise- tasty at that too.  Pork Belly was fabulous- little thicker than we get back home, but bigger.  My husband, a former sushi chef, was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Hamachi and the Ama Ebi.  Some things can only be ordered once per person but that was very few and far between.  Don't get too caught up on eating all the rice because the meat and sides are very good.

I'd say the quality of the meat is good and the appetizers are tasty. Side dishes(especially fish cake) are delicious. I love the variety of appetizers from corn cheese, gyoza, tempura, etc. 

Although the food is good, the service here is terrible. First two times I was here, it was just okay. But today it was horrible. It seemed really slow too. Beside us, there was about only 3 other tables. One of the servers seemed nice since he explained the menu to my friends who has never been here before. However, in our order, we ordered gyoza, steamed egg, and 2 side dippings of bean paste, they never came after 20 minutes of eating. We called one waiter over and asked about it. He said he would go check on it for us, but never came back. 
Another 10 minutes later, we called over another waiter and asked him about it. He brought us the order of gyoza but didn't bring the bean paste or steamed egg. While he was there, we asked him if we can have some more fish cake. Didn't come AGAIN. Later on, we couldn't even find any of the servers to even order more. 

I honestly felt embarrassed with my friends. We were all very disappointed with the service here.

There is a good selection of meats to choose from.   Hit and miss there.   The kalbi we got were thick and very hard to eat but the pork shoulder we got was great.   The shrimp was also very memorable because it was bland and they weren't cleaned. 

The sushi we will skip that next time we try this place.   Didn't seem the freshest and the rolls were too drowned in sauce.  I know some people like that but I'm not a fan of every roll having cream cheese and or mayo. 

I noticed that this was mentioned in a lot of other reviews as well but they ""were out"" of the dessert again.   If they don't have the items they should just remove them from the menu. 

All in all we'd go back to try meats we didn't get and to give this place another chance.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,3,BH69k2tMmEFOd_9I2J8ifQ

My favorite part is the spicy baby octopus cause it moves and swivels around, it was hilarious! Had to take a vid haha. The service is amazing! They're all very attentive and very friendly. We came here TWICE in just 30 hours lol. We came here May 27 noon time and then May 28 around 1:30 lol. My boyfriend and I suggested this to friends and family.  This restaurant is wonderful & the food is soo soo good. I loved the Bulgogi, Calamari, Miso Pork, Spicy Baby Octopus, Vegas Roll, Cucumber Kimchi, Kimchi, Fish Cane, Green Tea ice cream and so much more. We were so full that we maintained full the whole day! I love this place! Makes me wish I live in Vegas! Totally coming back here again!

5884492,2017-07-13,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"It's okay. This location is right next to Palace Station, on Teddy St. Parking was plenty, and was fairly easy to find a spot, however, their a little tight. 
The first thing i noticed when i walked into the restaurant was the space. This place is huge. It felt like some sort of lobby. While waiting for our party to arrive, we sat on the waiting area bench where one of the nails were sticking out and and my girlfriend scraped/cut her ankle from the nail. We notified the restaurant and the manager was nice and quickly provided aid and apologized, also note that they were kind enough to have her entire meal comp'd for that matter.
Food wise, we had the All you can eat KBBQ and some had the sushi and KBBQ. The KBBQ itself was okay, i mean.. nothing too different about it from any other KBBQ place. I didnt try the sushi but my friend had plenty, so i'll assume it was really good. One thing i am big on is cleanliness. I noticed some of the air ducts was really sticky and dusty, some even had webs on them. It made the food less appetizing when you look up and there's a bunch of filth.
Overall, a below-average experience. maybe it was that time of night i came in, but a restaurant should be at 100% from open to close.",ZvneWq5RacQdzAdci1LkHQ,3,0,2,Ofev6r0LPI4IgJPjPGQaHQ

5902865,2017-10-15,0,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,Worst experience ever! Was there for the fitness expo and went with friends to eat after. Worst experience with one of the female waiters. She was rude and kept leaving our table. She left our table for someone else to handle and missed most of our orders. We waited so long for our food. And when we asked it was never put it. They also had a problem with our payment where our table payed yet was missing a receipt and this waiter that kept on leaving said just pay it and go. Ummm No! It's not our fault you guys can't do your job correctly. And while handling this situation at the counter she kept leaving and come back to just Butt in and leave again. Wow! Have never seen such lack of management and customer handling skills. Definitely not coming back again. Food was not great also. I was trying to order my own meat and the waitress was like you guys share first..  and even though I was hungry the food was not the best. Horrible service by our waiter and management. Busser and other guys seem friendlier.,A3eyRhWV7LPCT3uwcHk_cw,0,0,1,jZoo-lXhLxEWc9f51uRuIg

Lunch AYCE BBQ + AYCE sushi addition: $23.99
Dinner AYCE BBQ + AYCE sushi: $29.99
For a combination of Korean bbq and sushi, that's super cheap and meat quality is great. There were some complications with the sever and orders coming out 15-20 minutes later but I understood that everything is made to order but man, I was so hangry. I waited almost 30 minutes for my sushi roll to come out and almost 15 minutes for rice paper (they do make it fresh and it's super soft) 

Aside from food taking too long, the reason why I'm keeping this at a 4 star-review because when my friends and I walked in we were kept waiting at the host stand for almost 6 minutes before someone greeted us. After the greetings we waited an additional 5-6 before we were asked how many was in the party and where we'd like to be sat. Customer service overall could of been better that night, but food was still bomb",4ukIXXBhmHz9ioDXsjSjKQ,3,2,4,P6q2Y3eo5wRMhBzfSCXFrA
5919567,2017-10-01,2,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I'll use the 1 star for cleanliness of the restaurant other than that, this place is a sad sad mimic of what could be really good Korean food. We arrived late, like 2am, and didn't know of any other Korean restaurants that were open (until we realized later in our trip). My husband is Korean (South, if any one out there who has been living under a rock for the last 50 years wants to know). We enter, & I presume a Korean female host welcomes us. He automatically speaks Korean and she replies, oh I don't speak Korean, which is fine because she is probably a Korean adoptee like me that just learned English. I asked her if anyone there spoke Korean and she says, no, sorry. Ok cool. That's fine. We chose bbq and sit on the bbq side. We are greeted by what looked to be a Hmong waiter (no offense to Hmong people, most of my friends are Hmong,however I know on the western side of the states most Hmong ppl call themselves Lao or Thai and don't realize they are Hmong...it's a midwestern thing). Anyway, the waiter approaches us and we order chadolbagi and sseumgeupsal. Which is essentially really expensive sliced beef and pork belly. He serves us some kind of lettuce salad, our banchan: fish cake, potato salad, and I think it was radish kimchi with some kind of strange tasting dipping sauce. He lights the grill and throws the meat on right way. Are you flipping kidding me? Anybody that grills knows you have to let it heat up first before applying the food. So of course the meat, which btw is no more than what you would get at your local grocery store, sticks to the pan and burns. And this guy, everytime we turned down the fire he would come and turn it back on high heat. Then, my husband asked for sesame oil with salt and pepper. Because if you go to a real Korean BBQ you get sesame oil as dipping sauce and rice and lettuce to wrap your meat in. Or at least some soybean paste. But here, nope. The guy says ""oh I don't speak Korean "" and my husband said, no sesame oil. Again the guy says, I don't speak Korean. Didn't even listen. My husband is like, I'm speaking English! You don't have sesame oil?! So then the guy finally gets it and brings us ""sesame oil"". Um no. It was vegetable oil with salt and pepper. I said, look here this is vegetable oil. And the guy argues, nope it's 100% sesame oil. We don't eat it. 5 minutes later he comes out with a ""browner"" dipping sauce and says, oh we have 2 kinds of sesame oil. Yup, no.that one basically tasted like watered down hoisin sauce with salt and pepper. We also ordered marinated spicy pork, idk y since the first two sucked, but it was ok. My husband said the marinade was no more than some soy sauce, msg, and brown sugar mixed together. We wasted over $60 eating here and we left the guy a tip, even though he was quite ignorant. You are sadly mistaken if you think you are eating authentic Korean food here. Save your money and go to Chinatown or the other Korean restaurants in Vegas which I will also review.",l4Wb3YIgZQ66bSOLvIgCsw,0,0,1,cwivwDat0Mge4ZRCA8yoSQ
5928774,2017-03-21,1,hqvqLihniz0ynit9c36JHg,"The first time we came to this place was around 2-3 months after it opened. We don't remember the exact day but we had the sushi + kbbq buffet for around $27.99/person. It was nice to have so many menu options and we did enjoy having both sushi and kbbq at the same time. Service was quite good that night and was overall a pleasant experience. 

Recently we decided to go there again. When we came in we noticed some customers waiting at the door when the restaurant was practically empty. There were three servers standing in their own circle chatting not too far away from us. After around 5 minutes or so the group in front of us were seated. While we were still waiting for anyone to notice our existence we decided to check out the menu. We soon found out they didn't seem to have the combined sushi + kbbq option anymore. Remembering that kbbq was pretty mediocre at this place last time, we decided to leave the place since we weren't seated anyways. Right when we were about to go out the door the servers now stopped chatting and one of them ran to us and was like 'How many?' 
Yeah right a little too late now bye~ 

Later that night we went to the highly rated Gangnam and had horrible experience. Can check out my review for Gangnam if you decide to find out more about the story.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,0,0,2,EnQ-sxORhD_7SRhUSJ4mdg

The service after that though was good. There food tasted great. We had bulgogi, spicy pork, tempura, cow tongue, rib eye, spicy squid and other things and they all tasted great. So for food quality I give a five and the portions are awesome.

They should say reservation for small parties only. Our group was 11 so service fee is included. Therefore service goes out the window and is bull crap. Our waiter came a by just to pick up our left over dishes but doesn't ask for anything else. Ever time we ask for an order he say ""I know"" and scurries away. We ordered a few dishes with other waiters and they brought it faster then our assigned waiter. We ordered beer and waited 15 mins. He forgot. Once he finally came by to collect our dishes he remembered and ran back to get the beer in a minute. For any one reading this I don't recommend coming with big groups.
