Next we had the grilled halibut warm appetizer, i think i died and went to heaven.  This dish was so OUSTANDING, I wanted to take a bath in the sauce, its a MUST HAVE.  NEXT THE Hapa roll, yummmmmmm.  Our server Chanez was excellent!  I mentioned that we loved Japanese scallops and they are hard to find in sushi restaurants, but I wanted to know if it could be made into a spicy roll, instead of just a piece of sushi, when it was served to us the chef created a special roll for us using the Japanese scallops, it was to die for!

We had the crispy tofu appetizer, which was excellent, and a couple of rolls -- Unagi (eel) and Happa (cajun spiced albacore, spicy aioli) -- which were outstanding.  Also threw in salmon roe sushi, which was good.  What really made the evening, however, was the outdoor patio seating overlooking the Bellagio fountains, so that every 30 minutes we would be treated to a music choreographed fountain display.  Really a great dining experience.  Highly recommend.  I will definitely go back next time I visit Vegas.",GPAi8INfekcCMTr8BfuUCA,0,0,5,b3zaWPCIvHDRAwFZHJ9DMw

43834,2014-06-05,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Was happy that my buddies and I could get a table without much waiting on a busy Saturday night . The entrance to the restaurant is rather narrow with bar setup, but once you walk past the bar, the place opens up to a nice and spacious dining area.

One of my buddies was quite intoxicated when we were seated, and he started asking so many questions about how the food is prepared and what goes into each dish on the menu to our server.  My other friend and I were amused, so we didn't interrupt and we really appreciated our server's patience and also his professionalism. 

About half way through our meal, another server started serving our table. When this talkative friend asked her to surprise him with a good glass of wine, she brought him one of the most expensive wines (as the rest of us suspected!) on their menu (~$30), but this wine tasted merely ok, not great. 

I had sushi rolls and it was very mediocre tasting. Presentation also was OK. I expected more and better food for fine-dining for the money I was paying. 

If you really don't care much about food or price, this place offers modern and well polished environment with good cocktails. But alas, you are in Vegas, the place full of many great fine dining places that could offer the same level of ambience and cocktails. 

Although I realize if you are in Vegas to party the hard way, the food might not be your main concern... in which case, what are you doing, wasting your time reading this review!",U0LynIOSfU0RiIe096zHrQ,1,0,3,0PkQCHYYLMpFlRluyf95LQ

The tempura king crab was good, but not great - very good execution, but I wasn't blown away.  Maybe there's only so much you can do with king crab . . .

The oyster shooter I had was great - very fresh, and the sake & tomato sauce combo worked well with the oyster.  Good service at this place also.  A solid option overall, but I give the clear edge to Nobu when it comes to Japanese fare in Vegas.",_gjKuFxdQSLPrf6fYSiUwg,0,0,3,99kj2vyZgHXaUrU5CKLkow

That said, Yellowtail is not the typical sushi restaurants that has 3 pages of different sushi rolls or all you can eat option. Its an upscale Japanese restaurant with tapas serving sizes. We ordered most of the popular dishes: Big Eye Tuna Pizza (Crispy), Tempura King Crab (Crabby Crab Crab), Kobe Beef Tataki (raw and weird at first), Crispy Soft Shell crab and one specialty sushi (don't remember the name because it wasn't memorable). I was very pleased with the suggested dishes by the waiter and was awed by the view of the Bellagio Fountain.

The location, with views of the Bellagio fountains, can't be beat either. Convenient for going to see O after.

However, it was so expensive that we ended up feeling a bit ripped off. It was a great meal, but it didn't seem like it was worth $150 a person. We went to L'Atelier de Joel Rubochon at the MGM Grand the next day for nearly the same price, and that was a million times better - totally different kind of cuisine, but if you want a splurge meal I would recommend L'Atelier de Joel Rubochon, not Yellowtail.

82058,2009-05-21,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I'm a bit of a sushi snob, so when I heard that the Bellagio was finally getting into the game, I was definitely intrigued. Didn't get a chance to try it until now, and the results aren't impressive...

The wait wasn't too bad; around 10 minutes for 5 on a Saturday night so a few members of our party decided to go play some blackjack while they waited. While they were gone, we were seated and placed our drink orders. A few moments after our entire party returned, yet neither the waitress nor the sake attendant could be bothered to acknowledge their arrival or take their drink orders. Pretty tacky...

The service didn't get much better from there. Sake came quickly, but anything from the bar took way too long without any explanation. When we finally ordered our food, our waitress missed two of the items, most of our 2nd round of drinks and then checked in on us very infrequently. I suppose to her credit, she admitted her shortcomings and offered us a free dessert, but it would have been nicer had she just been on her game from the beginning. 

The food wasn't much better. Sushi was an embarrassment. Ordered a lobster roll; the lobster was alright, but the mango was nowhere to be found and the roll was simply too small to justify the price. The toro was nowhere near as delicious as toro should be and I'm not sure there was actually any wasabi on the nigiri. 

The hot food does deserve a little praise. The rock shrimp in a korean chili sauce was very tasty, although the sauce made the shrimp on the bottom of the bowl a bit soggy.  The kobe tartar and kobe filet were the highlights of the meal, but again...way too small for nearly $40 a plate.

I'm aware it's the Bellagio, so obviously things are going to be a bit higher then an off-strip place, but that's not an excuse to rip people off and you better have your execution down. This wasn't the case at all, so it deserves no more then two stars. If you're on this part of the strip looking for good sushi, I'd recommend Sushi Roku across the street at Caesars.",C1_AvND8ApbjfZlKbtbbEA,0,0,2,3_fxGXmugxxpDJ95PfmhPQ

We do not have big appetites but the portion size here just did not justify the price.  Service was good but looked confused when we mentioned the portions seemed small in relation to the price.

There is a bit of background here... during my Jan trip to LV, they planned a dinner at a sushi place in Cosmo knowing that I don't eat fish at all!  I eat various types of meat, chicken, beef, pork but no fish.  

I got a text asking if I wanted to join everyone for dinner, of course I said ""yes"" before asking where they were taking me only to find out that it was Yellow Tail.  I'm sure for some, this would be a great treat since I'm told that Yellow Tail at the Bellagio has great seafood, for me it was a diet night.  

I got to the restaurant bar around 6:30 and had a quick drink with everyone.  The bartender was very nice and they do have vanilla vodka, so I was happy with my drink.  We were seated shortly after and were quickly greeted by our server, he was very nice and attentive throughout the entire meal, he was great!

So my very funny coworkers decided to order a Chef sampling, so I ate nothing due to the fact it was all seafood.  The server noticed my lack of food, he felt terrible and offered to bring me some cooked meat... we decided upon a filet cooked medium.  My filet arrived shortly after the order and I promptly wolfed it down in about 3min flat.  I have never been so happy to see cooked beef in my life.  The filet was ok, cooked well and topped with some sizzling teriyaki sauce.  It wasn't as good as Prime, but given that this is a seafood place, I was just glad that they had the option.

I did try some cold Saki for the first time ever.  I was scared at first but it turned out to be very good and was nice to sip along with the meal. 

I would return here for the service and beverages without question.  Knowing that they do have cooked beef on the menu is a HUGE plus, I know I won't starve at least. haha",MQgm8BtxS-_W-unU4y0OxQ,1,1,4,bZROw6lFDrxPNMorWACPdw

I actually had a very enjoyable evening thanks to great company, and I was prepared to feel overcharged given that this restaurant is located inside the Bellagio Hotel. But, if you live in a city that has good sushi (L.A.) you can probably think of 3 sushi bars within 3 miles of your house, have a better meal at each and every one of them, and still have money left over in the end.

To me, sushi is supposed to be an experience in every bite. Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant & Lounge is too bland and too expensive (and the servings embarrassingly small), and will likely disappoint all but the most novice of sushi fans.",ZQnKs1ZG7V0eiglKLfyEFg,2,0,2,-3lfMrpuYRl7JOCsUTzVOA

The front of the house is staffed by a 20-something, ADD-challenged, Barbie-wanna be who has no clue on how to organize, let alone honor, those people conscientious enough to call ahead for a table. 

We (and two other couples who were not with our group) had reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday night. All of us showed up either 5 minutes early or on time, and were asked to wait for a few minutes. No problem, we understand this is usually the case while tables are cleared out. 

By 8:20pm, we were all still standing around. 

However, during the 25 minute wait for our tables, two Japanese business groups (containing 4-6 people each) showed up without reservations and were rushed through to open seats. When we asked Barbie about this, she just prattled, ""Oh, it'll just be a few more minutes."" 

We left shortly afterward. 

I'm not sure what happened to the other 4 schmucks patiently waiting for a table. But as far as I'm concerned, front of house represents the restaurant and if you cannot manage your customers, how do I know whether you can manage the food?

Yellowtail Tataki was very good (we ordered 3 of them after the first tasting). The pop rock candy roll was ok and something we would pass on the next time. 2 desserts (chocolate in a cup and green tea mousse) were very good (and our waiter picked them out). The dessert actually came with some type of mocha shot and was a nice way to wash down the dessert. 4 bottles of beer and the total was about $340.

Being in Vegas, this is not as authentic as R-23, but the ambiance and service make it a very enjoyable dining experience.

We walked in last Sunday night after the ""O"" show got out and were able to get a table wo reservations. We basically ordered almost all the vegetarian stuff that wasn't sweet or fried off the menu:

-edamame: come in regular and spicy, and served warm. that was interesting. regular was a little too salty for me, but Boyfriend preferred them over the spicy ones.
-oshitashi: good grief this was expensive for what it was. Okay I know all is like that, but...it was alright. the red beets were just julienned on top...nothing to write home about really
-seaweed salad: rather interesting with the inclusion of non-traditional seaweed (i only recognized the wakame). this was rather bland 'cuz the dressing kept ""falling off"" into the bottom of the plate
-assorted mushrooms:  HOLY FREAKIN' GOODNESS = reminded me of the frickin' delicious mushrooms @ Tokyo-Go-Go (SF)...'NUFF SAID (aka ""it tastes like it has buttah insoyde"" aka butter is totally in that awesome sauce and I dipped my ikura sushi rice in there to sop it all up)
-ikura sushi: this was really good. actually no fishy taste at all and not too salty.  wow.
-tamago sushi: um...this was like eating egg spongecake...we were confused.

Amazingly we got full. Boyfriend had a $20 glass of champagne and that wasn't even the most expensive glass..it did taste better than my $12 champagne (don't ask why we were drinking champagne in Vegas). 

Beef 1: We did order the vegetable sushi roll, but they forgot about it, so we just took it off the bill.

Beef 2: Our server suffered from tunnel vision. She was nice enough, and spoke clearly and whatnot, but we had a lovely time trying to flag her down.

If I find myself in the Bellagio again, I'm going to just go here for (overpriced) drinks and eat tons of the mixed mushroom plates. I felt like there's definitely better for the price, and I only give it 3 stars because of those mushrooms and the fresh-@$$ ikura.

And for the record, we paid ~$86 for vegetables and a glass of the cheapest champagne they had. (Boyfriend got his $20 glass from the bar while we waited.)",LK_pGahoQqa3hb4lKKYLzA,1,1,3,s_FXSjAhLbjgxP1ekJyldw

I would expect a nice expensive restaurant to have decent glasses not a glass you would receive while gambling or something.    

The tuna pizza was good but presentation rather boring.  We also ordered Kumamoto oysters which was about $32 for 6 and it was not anywhere near Asian inspired I felt like it was something I would have got at an Italian place.   Oysters and cocktail sauce is basically what we got.   We ordered the filet toban as well which smelled awesome but was nothing special.   The crispy kalbi roll was delicious but presentation was lacking!!!!  

Now I don't mind spending money on my meal if the food and presentation and service was great but I wasn't really happy when I left.  The service was rushed and she didn't really listen to us, plus she kept telling us that was probably enough food in which was not and felt that she didn't have time for us.   Maybe she just wanted us to leave.  We were helped by another man who was dressed in a chef coat who was not the chef but was helping out he said and he was very personable and helpful more than our server was.

When sushi is this expensive, you expect it to be really good.  I ordered Ikura, Japanese scallop and yellowtail sushi.   Each piece was very smail, which to be fair is more traditional, but when you consider that each order was $9.00-$11.00 or $12 you kind of want a teeny bit more substance.  If not substance, then at least some kind of special preparation.  Small portiions are even forgivable if the fish is to die for.  The yellowtail had virtually no flavor - weird, right?.  Even bad yellowtail tastes like, well bad yellowtail.  This was just void of anything.  The scallops were wet and mushy and the Ikura was just okay - kind of fishy - even for salmon eggs (which I love and order all the time)..  I also ordered the eggplant on skewers.  This was so-so..  They cut the eggplant into small cubes, skewered them, supposedly grilled them, then slopped it with the sweet sauce that you usually see on eel sushi...a.totally forgetable dish.  But the worst offender of the evening was one of Yellowtail's 'signature' cut rolls: spicy crab, asparagus, green bean  and (are you ready?) pop rocks.  This is HAD to try just for the goof.  But before diving in, I asked the nice barternder/server if this roll had mayo in it because I'm not a fan.  She said that they could make it without,.  It arrives and looks like your basic california roll.  When I tasted it, it wasn't spicy and the pop rocks just don't work.  In fact, it was ridiculous...like the chef was high out of his mind one night and said hey! let's stick some candy in a sushi roll and see how many suckers out there will pay $16.00 for it!!    Dinner with one non-alcoholic beer cost $79,00.  Granted, I'm at Bellagio so this should be expected - and I'm happy to pay for something that is worth the money.

So yes, it is expensive but it is also very good. Portions are small which I actually like because I'm not looking to get stuffed ordering a la carte. This is not AYCE. Small portions translate into perfect little bites with a lot of fresh flavor here at Yellowtail. 

The King Crab Tempura was outstanding. So delicious. Crispy outside, tender juicy king crab chunks on the inside.

Popping rock spicy crab was amazing! I'm gonna try to get my local sushi chef to add that to their menu. 

Toro was priced a little high for even a fancy place but it was fresh and of course, melt-in-your-mouth divinity.

625404,2017-06-04,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I made Saturday night reservations weeks ago as it was my birthday. We had 7:45 reservations arrived 15 minutes early and were greeted with a happy birthday. However I was told the table wasn't ready which was understandable. There are tables directly in front of the host and we sat there. 25 minutes later I had to go back to the host to inquire about my status. I was told the patrons were taking a long time to finish their meal. We were not seated until a half hour after our reservation time. And while it is not required, a nice touch would have been an offer of a drink. We were not offered that drink so I was forced to get one at the bar. 

When we were finally seated it was at an unremarkable table and in light of the multitude of two tops, it is extremely unlikely in my mind a table didn't become available sooner. 

A server whose name escapes me was very good. However our appetizer came at the same time as our rolls and I felt like my birthday meal was being rushed. No explanation was offered on the timing of the dishes. 

The  sushi is very, very good. We had the octopus appetizer, the California roll (true Alaskan crab), the unagi roll and the tuna roll. I recommend them all. 

Besides the Happy Birthday greeting, no mention was made again.  

The price of the meal (110$) was reasonable for an upscale sushi establishment. It just didn't feel like an upscale sushi restaurant.

655387,2009-06-29,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I am shocked that this place has a 4 star average. Absolutely floored. 

In Vegas for the weekend, the wife and I want sushi. We decide to give Yellowtail a try. The hostess tells us she'll have a table for us in 20 minutes. Great, we go to the bar.  35 minutes later I go back to check in and a different hostess tells me it will probably be another 15 minutes. Meanwhile the place is at least 1/3 empty. They're probably trying to create that fake buzz that the restaurant is more popular than it actually is. Annoying, but I guess that's part of Vegas. At one point the bartender even asked us ""You guys are STILL waiting for a table?"" When we said yes, he actually went up to the hostess stand on our behalf. Not sure that it did much, but we were appreciative all the same.

After waiting for about 45 minutes in a 1/3 empty restaurant we finally get seated. The decor of this place is nice, I'll give it that. One of the few redeeming qualities of Yellowtail.  We're seated by the window facing the fountain show outside The Bellagio. Nice setting. Unfortunately things went down from there.

We ask to start with some edamame and the King Crab Dynamite starter. Then we order a couple different rolls and a few types of nigiri sushi. The starter arrives (the edamame never actually showed up) and within 2 minutes all the rolls and sushi were on the table. Shouldn't you have at least 5-10 minutes minimum to eat your starter before the rest of your meal is being hustled to the table? The restaurant at this point is probably 1/2 empty.  It wasn't like they had to turn over the table quickly for other waiting guests.

It's not even worth rehashing exactly what type of rolls and sushi we ordered because it was all pretty poor, as was the crab starter. The quality of the fish here is equal to what you get in those pre-packaged Safeway sushi trays. No lie, it's on that same level. Certainly not what I expected given the decor of the restaurant and the exorbitant prices. We were ready to drop some $$$ for a good meal. We certainly dropped the $$$, but Yellowtail didn't deliver on the good meal.

2 Large Sapporo's, 2 glasses of champagne ($30 total), King Crab Starter, 2 rolls, 6 total pieces of Nigiri cost $170!! $170 and I left hungry.

My advice for anyone thinking of going to Yellowtail... instead go to Safeway, buy a few of those pre-packaged sushi trays, a 6 pack of Sapporo and a bottle of champagne and take it back to your room. Same quality food and to complete the effect, you can even make yourself wait 45 minutes to eat it. And the best part is that you'll have an extra $120 in your pocket to spend in Vegas.",ztF6hMa3-HeXa6Fm-BZ_KA,1,0,1,zIOwAdvYyrGsgCWIQCeClQ

However, we were meeting a friend who is a local and said we had to go.  We did and my husband was an instant fan.  A lot of their items are a shared plate (warm and cold) as well as the rolls, etc.  My friend and I shared the tuna pizza which is excellent!  It consists of a toasted tortilla (whole wheat I think) with thinly sliced red onion, some sort of white sauce and then the tuna on top.  Delish!  We also had the yellow tail which was good (a nice light fish).  My favorite was the king crab tempura.  To top things off we had a spicy tuna roll.  We would have loved to try more but there is only so much you can eat.  My husband had the aged Kobe beef flat iron steak which was sliced and served with a teriyaki sauce on top of some root vegetables.  He ordered this the 2nd time we were there as well but ordered a bowl of rice since he felt he needed a bit more to eat since he passed on sharing our plates.

The hostess was great, she remembered us right away.  There was one hostess (not at the desk) that sat us and she was not friendly at all but that did not detract from our night.  The waitstaff was so friendly and when we asked for suggestions, they were spot-on.

If you read any part of this review, read this:  

GROUP FOOD POISONING AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.


I had been planning a really special bachelorette weekend for my best friend of 22 yrs for months and of course I wanted every bit of it to be just perfect as a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and arguably the most important time in a woman's life.

We flew into Vegas from NYC on July 18, 2013 and wanted to have a big dinner and rest our first night before celebrating the following 3 days.  

I chose Yellowtail as the Bellagio would be a change of scenery (we stayed at the Cosmopolitan which by the way is AMAZING), and because it is a 5-Star property at which one would THINK they would be dining in a trustworthy, luxury place.

We ordered many dishes to share including tuna pizza, different sushi rolls, eggplant, shrimp tempura, beef and more.  

There were 6 of us in our party.  One of the girls  is vegetarian, so of course she did not partake in any of the seafood dishes.  Nor did I, as I don't eat fish. A 7th girl joined us in Vegas the following day, so she did not dine at Yellowtail. 

THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE DID DIFFERENTLY FROM EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE FIRST DAY OF OUR TRIP which is how we know that the food poisoning came directly from Yellowtail.

The next morning, all 4 girls INCLUDING THE BRIDE, who ate the fish & sushi came down with debilitating food poisoning symptoms.  Vomiting and other issues that I'm sure I don't need to spell out, kept them literally lying on the hotel bathroom floor for the remainder of our trip. The poor things were hardly able to stand and we were thankful that we had a suite with multiple bathrooms or we would have been in an even worse state.

Our trip, and more importantly, the Bride's special weekend (and more--this food poisoning spell triggered her to experience vertigo which she is still suffering from to this day), were COMPLETELY RUINED.  The girls spent all day and night feeling like they literally might die, and the 3 of us who did not experience the symptoms , were force feeding them Gatorade and toast so that they wouldn't be hospitalized in Las Vegas with dehydration.

7 girls, 7 RUINED trips. 

We couldn't do any of the fun things we had planned and wasted a lot of money and time that we will never be able to get back.

We called the Bellagio right away to put in a complaint thinking that they would AT THE VERY LEAST, refund our dinner bill as a courtesy for our extreme inconvenience.  

Instead, they proceeded to give us the run-around for weeks, passing us off from department to department--Security to ""Guest Services,"" to the restaurant itself, to the Light Group (who owns the restaurant), etc., and ultimately we were told that they would not be taking ANY responsibility and that we were basically sh*t out of luck. 

DO NOT EAT HERE.  Vegas has so many amazing and accommodating places to dine, and so many fun things to experience. Don't ruin your trip by eating at this irresponsible establishment.",EPHmlbN3_p1pSWP3A4f9rA,1,0,1,QqWVkOnn25nfOBpdALBptw

855083,2010-10-11,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Beautiful. Very Good Food. Superb Service.

Party of 4 on Sunday night.

We ordered the big eye tuna pizza, popping spicy crab roll, seafood ""dynamite"", some nigiri and a Maine lobster roll (a special that evening). Each dish was good, the tuna pizza was very delicious. The pop rocks in the spicy crab roll are amusing. It's a nice bit of sushi, the candy doesn't add all that much, but puts a smile on your face. The seafood dynamite was the least refined of the dishes, very stew-like but still good. We were offered a special roll that was made with Maine lobster, it had flavor reminiscent of the tuna pizza which we loved and the lobster was excellent. The unagi, maguro and shiro maguro were all very nice.

Our server, Teo (sp?), was attentive and made our experience a comfortable one. He was very knowledgeable about the dishes and his description of the lobster sold us on that fine dish.

Yellowtail's beautiful space just added to the overall positive experience. We will definitely return.

Total bill with tax/tip $240 (2 rounds of cocktails).",FIKgmhT3AttTMBarz_sqjw,0,0,4,YxoRZwApN2GMw1Z65pNp9Q

869216,2010-12-27,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I agree with the others, this place is overpriced! My eyeballs had the $$ in them as I scan the menu. 

My mister and I had our dinner here on our very last night in Vegas. I choose this place because I saw the chef on the Bellagio info tv channel making the popular big eye tuna pizza dish. Just to clarify, this is not your cheese and tomato pie, but slices of tuna on a crisp tortilla bread and sliced onions with truffle oil sprinkled on top. That was $26! Yes, that was our appetizer and it was really delish and one of the most creative dishes that I've had in a long time. I ordered a Lychee martini - $20, for that drink. 

The mister decided that we should go with the chef's seven course tasting menu. The last time we ate a chef's tasting menu anywhere was ages ago, so why not, the mister was treating the Mrs. Here is the breakdown of the chef Akira Back menu: 

1. Seafood Pate with a tiny, delish sugary treat (I didn't like this) 
2. Sliced Yellowtail with jalapenos 
3. Salad with greens, tomato, & onions 
4. Salmon with miso sauce and foam 
5. Kobe short ribs with a quail egg and star shaped veggies 
6. 5 pieces of sushi (sushi was average) 
7. Green tea mousse cake with a shot of milk. 

Portions are small so this tasting menu made our stomach at that beginning feeling at full. Believe me, there will be no leftovers to wrap up and I made sure that I drank very sip of my lychee martini. Overall, I loved my experience at Yellowtail. The waiter was awesome as he made sure we done on time as we had to leave for our show. The ambiance is beautiful, so chic, and very romantic. This restaurant has a beautiful view of the fountain show. I would come back just for the tuna pizza and ambiance. As for the prices, you will be spending part of the jackpot you've won OR considered what you've paid to eat here as a part of your gambling losses.",WksOkt4sdPXryez2tnLggg,1,0,4,VuDBGiynJy4mpghthEV-Nw

After 30 minutes of waiting for 2 sushi rolls (we were just getting a snack), I finally was able to get our server over to our table and ask what was going on.  Her response was that they were really busy; which was not the case.  Let me also say, once we had our drinks, she NEVER came back to our table.  Our food was brought to us by runners, and our server never even came back to see if we wanted another cocktail.  I have to say the food was excellent, as usual, and also very overpriced but I knew that going in.  I give the food a 4, the price a 2 and the service a 1.

Then, the server said he ""recommended dining family style"" and when we told him we'd like to each order separately, he responded by saying he ""wasn't allowed to write seat numbers next to the orders"" so they'd all have to be delivered to the center and we'd have to sort it out... what the?!@#$#?

Then, the completely forgot to fill one persons order, so he sat patiently while we all *finished* our meals, and then he was served. To Yellowtail's credit they comped his meal, but it still ruined it.

Anyway, I've been here twice. Both times, I've had indigestion afterward. And I eat a lot of sushi, a lot of fish, so it's not just my stomach, it's definitely something here that makes me sick! 

Last time I went was for my 21st birthday. It was still a fun experience and I still had a great time, but there are just better places to eat in Vegas. I really do love their butterfish appetizer, it is perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth, and you just talk about how good it tastes for 10 minutes. They also have an Alaskan King Crab tempura app which is pretty good. It was featured on ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate,"" but I think I like the Nobu version better. Anyway, everything else is just all right. Their handrolls aren't really handrolls... They should call them ""tiny stick rolls"" with one smalllll piece of fish in them. They taste good but it just doesn't quite cut it for me.

We had a reservation at 9pm but were 1 1/2 hrs too early. We got a table, regardless. Unfortunately after only a few minutes we were about to leave. The place was incredibly noisy, no way to have a normal conversation. The music was sooo loud, the people's voices level unbearable. We were so disappointed..... We wanted so much this evenIng to be unforgettable. The staff was really nice and showed much understanding for our frustration. First they offered another large table, however the noise wasn't really better. Since the number of available seats on the patio/outside terrace is very limited, the likelihood to get a table for six with no reservation was very low! But i must say i was impressed by their efforts to help us. And after 15-20 min, with a bit of patience they were able to seat us outside, in the patio, with direct view on the Bellagio's fountain with great water choreographies and our evening was saved! Yes, the evening is really memorable. The food was great! We had revisited oysters, tempura crab, a selection of sushi, kobe beef tabaki, i recommend the 'angry salmon', shared plates: yellowtail jalapenos, gratinee seafood, scallops: all was great! My guests were absolutely delighted! But we had our very highlight with the dessert. I am not a 'dessert guy' but what we got that evening was absolutely magic. The yuzu citrus was the best dessert we ever had, the chocolate in a cup with banana foam absolutely top!!

This was my first experience with Sashimi, I love sushi rolls and never thought I would care for sashimi.
I believe we had the halibut I could be wrong on this. We also had the yellowtail jalapeno, oysters all of these were amazingly good! We also got the big eye tuna pizza so delish!

970918,2013-02-27,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"2 stars for great ambience and good service - would give a 1/2 star for food if Yelp allowed, but not good enough to round up to 3.  Let me qualify this review by saying we were motivated by a good experience at Noodles and the in room bio about the Korean executive chef who broke down the making of his signature tuna pizza.

Decor / ambience: excellent.  In fact, probably one of the best places on the strip for views of the fountain show and quiet atmosphere for a business dinner or dinner date.  Minimalist decor with candles on each table.  Drink menu presented via a customized iPad app, which was a little over the top, but fine.

Service: fine, exactly what one would expect from a restaurant trying to market itself more on the fine dining spectrum.  Drink glasses always full and empty plates taken away quickly.

Food: herein lies the great and tragic downfall.  We began with the tuna pizza and soft shell crab roll.  The roll was small for our tastes about a 4 inch cut roll, wrapped in nori and soy.  The crab was crisp and fresh though so okay all around.  The pizza however left much to be desired.  The tortilla on which the tuna lay was burnt and overpowered anything that the chefs could have placed on top.  The tuna itself was cut delicately, but tasteless.  The order was followed up with ankimo, Saba roll(Holy Mackerel), hamachi roll (Yellowtail Scallion).  Ankimo was not true pate, but the tube sort, cut into round circles and lacking in any flavor.  The rolls resembled convenient store sushi in appearance - although the rice was soft, there was such an insignificant amount of fish that we really could not taste anything.  I really am not trying to be overly dramatic here - looking at some of the photos I post, you will get a feel for what the plates are like.  The price for the disappointing food was the final nail.  I understand that when going to a place like Yellowtail, you will be overpaying to a certain extent for the ambience and experience.  However to not even receive food I could get from places in LA, I.E., Go's Mart, Katsuya, Sugarfish, or Got Sushi for what Yellowtail charges is ridiculous.

Normally, if I do not like a restaurant, I would not return.  However, I was so dissatisfied with my experience at Yellowtail, that I felt compelled to review.  I do not plan on returning.",6zivd0TMVJN4wYqMpwveRg,2,1,2,XWG_7O69HjjWx79lKC9zwQ

Unfortunately, we weren't sitting there, but we had a huge booth, big enough for six, all to ourselves, just two of us!

Service was good, not over the top.  Our waiter was a great photographer, so he gets kudos for the most excellent picture he took! 

The specialty drinks are stunning and creative in presentation, heavy on the alcohol by my standards, but expensive - $20 for one martini!  Loved the Lychee martini!

The food is fresh, inspired, and pretty!  We had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  I could have eaten two of them by myself.  It really isn't a pizza at all, but an artfully covered cracker with plenty of tuna accented by shiso and truffle oil. To get my daily dose of veggies, we ordered the grilled eggplant skewers which were covered in miso and sesame. It was sweet and good enough for dessert.  We had to try the Popping Spicy Crab Roll, the claim to fame being the addition of pop rocks (remember those?) amongst a more traditional crab, asparagus and cucumber roll.  We were expecting an explosion of sorts on our mouths but it was actually very subtle and sweet on the finish. It didn't wow us like we thought it would, but it was still a delicious roll.

Yellowtail is really all about the combination of atmosphere, service and food, and it was a great experience!

That being said, the ambiance was pretty nice.  The decor was dark and sleek, and our server was decent (he did forget to bring us tamari, but other than that, great).  We could also look out the window and see a little bit of the Bellagio fountain show, and it was neat to see it from inside the building.

I also liked the sommelier.  She was able to take two different wine preferences (dry vs. ""sweet!  I like Moscato!"") and recommend something in the middle that would appeal to both types of palates (still a little too sweet for my liking, personally, but a good compromise).

We shared the seared diver sea scallops (""mustard potato puree, cherry tomato"").  These scallops were cooked very nicely and were garnished with a smear of the potato puree, which was too sweet, and a roasted cherry tomato.  The only thing was... there were two scallops.  They were 1.5 inches in diameter and had been cut in half so that there would be four pieces arranged delicately on the plate.  For $23, I think at least one more scallop would have been nice.

Next up was the popping spicy crab roll (""cucumber, asparagus, pop rocks"").  Umm, it had pop rocks in it.  How could we not resist?  This was really fun to eat and actually worked a lot better than I expected.

We also ordered the unagi roll (""cucumber, sesame seeds, eel sauce"").  Eel is always good and this was no exception.  These rolls were all a bit on the small side though.  Actually, I could have eaten the scallops and the rolls on my own, and then I would have been full.  But that would have cost me $50+.

Overall, I wouldn't choose to come here, but this was a nice place for a group of friends to chill and drink some wine (marked up from $20 to $55).  Such is my experience with Vegas...

- Crispy Kalbi. This dish has a center of Korean short ribs and uses slaw, rather than rice, as the outer layer.  Yep, you read that right.  No need to grab your Grandmother's glasses; I said slaw.  Trust me (famous last words.)  ;-)  But really, trust me.

- Broiled Atlantic Black Cod.  OMG, and I mean OMG! Any attempt to describe the taste of this menu item will fall short.  The fish is firm, yet pulls apart easily and I would ask that this be the last item to be served during the meal.  A perfect punctuation mark to an experience that has been building in taste and texture.  The chopsticks were clicking as we attacked the dish like a school of Amazonian pirañas.

I would replace the Filet Mignon Toban with one of the above.

- Rock Shrimp Hand Roll.  I would order this rather than the Baked Crab Hand Roll.  Both are good, but the Rock Shrimp Hand Roll takes it over the top.

1151643,2015-03-17,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"well, where do i start...  before i do that, i would like to say that i am a big foodie, trying out numerous michelin rated chefs and top rated chefs and restaurants.  that is probably why we like going to vegas,, chicago, and nyc for great food.  
we were staying at the bellagio to begin with and we already ate at Picasso once again.  so, we thought we tried yellowtail, since the hotel tv talked highly of it.  
when we dine at japanese restaurants, we like to do the full omakase dinner, sometimes it can be from a 7 course to even an 12 course type of thing depending on where you end up.  well let me tell you why my husband and i are disappointed with yellowtail.  first the portions are just too small... we were on out 4th course and they are teenie tiny.  we dined at nobu countless times and at masa as well in nyc and vegas, and we have never seen portions that small for an omakase dinner.   then by the time we are all done with all seven courses, my husband and i had to go to the noodles restaurant for another late night supper.  
food wise, it was decent, nothing to scream about.  the tuna pizza was different and very light tasting, but other than that, not that great.  we had a little sampler of their rendition of kobe beef, but that so so as well.  nobu does their kobe beef on a hot rock and the taste is much much better.  
we dont mind paying for good food, but it has to be good, and at least the portion needed to justify it.  for $150 per person, i expected a bit more in terms of portion.  we gotten more at picasso, and sage in terms of portion, even thought  we spend way more at morimoto or nobu or masa, the portion sizes were just way more and we  didnt have to supplement our dinner with a second dinner. 
also, the last thing is the atmosphere,  it is pretty loud here,  we have been to morimoto in nyc and its loud too, but there were a bunch of tipsy people just talking trash behind us.  
wouldnt go back there ever.  there's a lot of better places to eat for sushi in vegas.",Wla5C7_-Rz4RgYek4SWw8g,0,0,2,OZ3y4UpJ8FLHlNj0L8TZrA

The restaurant was beautiful and the view of the Bellagio fountains impressive.

But here's the bottom line: at approximately $60/person (including tax and tip), guests should be leaving pleasantly full and impressed with the cuisine.  We left already planning our late night snack and absolutely unimpressed with anything that Yellowtail had to offer.

Their flagship item, the  Big Eye Tuna Pizza was good, but somewhat bland.  We also liked the Edamame Two Ways: Sea Salt and Sweet Chili.  Everything else we ordered was pretty uninteresting, and I've had far better at any number of sushi bars in LA at 1/3 the price.

We had a bland Yellowtail Scallion roll, a lame Spicy Tuna roll, a very fishy Mackerel with Shiso that I couldn't even eat, very average pork Gyoza, and a fairly tasty Seared Albacore with Onion, Crispy Shitake Mushrooms and Chili Sesame.

Big Eye Tuna Pizza * thinly sliced tuna w/ a cream sauce on top of a cracker thin crust & topped w/ micro shiso & Truffle Oil.  The best way to eat this is to scoop one half of the tuna onto the other half of the pizza & enjoy a larger amount of tuna on each slice mmm! ($27)

Strawberry Roll they used to have it so maybe it's a seasonal Roll that I love topped w/ sweet strawberries, thinly sliced.

I got there and the hostesses were super accommodating and gave me a seat on the patio with a breathtaking view of the Bellagio fountains. 
SERVICE: My server who's name was Mickel ""Like nickel and pickle"" was an absolute gem. He made pleasant conversation with me and we chatted about what was great about traveling solo. It was a really welcoming experience to someone dining alone. 
FOOD: I got the tempura crab, some wine, and some strawberry gelato to end. Hands down one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. It was pricey but the view and the staff and the food made it worthwhile. 
AMBIANCE: The fountains went off and music played over the speakers every 30min or so, and there was no question that myself and the other patio-diners had the best seats in the house. I hope to be able to go back someday.",mFXaX_upRmNrRMQ7YiJ38w,0,0,5,IvpSTHV0gTVgVQT2X16teQ
1387657,2017-04-02,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,This place is outstanding. The food was amazing. For appetizer I suggest ordering tuna pizza sounds daring but is delicious it is also complemented nicely with truffle oil. Also the creamy spicy rock shrimp dosent dissatisfy. It's nice with a nice touch of spice. Also for the main rolls we ordered angry salmon which is a spicy salmon garlicky roll. Secondly we ordered rock shrimp hand roll this roll wasn't the extraordinary but it was ordinary. For tempura lovers there is a tempura roll that is amazing. Lastly we ordered an amazing roll that is a spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna was by far the best roll on the menu and I high reccomend it. It is very spicy though so If you don't love spicy this isn't for you but my family and I love spicy so this roll was a home run. The service is ok not the best but decent in the beginning it was amazing but towards the end not so much. But either than that it's a home run.,pDsZ2FKSsii8PSiPdIdB3w,0,0,4,3-2YRSpymfzwUffL131xTw

1408374,2016-02-01,3,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I really wanted to like Yellowtail, but it was such a disappointment.  My co-worker and I arrived to our party's reservation (of about ~12 people) late and ordered our entrees late, but that should mean that everyone else's entree orders should arrive on time, right?!?!  Wrong.

We had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Yellowtail Jalapeno, and Tempura Alaskan King Crab (which is supposedly highly praised by the Food Network).  I liked the tuna pizza, but mostly because I liked the truffle oil.  The yellowtail tasted odd to me but that could be that I'm not a fan of orange flavored things and it's sitting in a blood orange sauce.  Meh, I think it was just not for me.  I had high hopes for the crab tempura given our waiter's high praise for it, but it was lackluster and did not wow me at all.  Tasted exactly like what it sounds like.   :/  What's up with that Food Network?  I thought this was supposed to be good!

Given our lackluster appetizers, I was hoping our entrees would make up for it.  I had a taste of the High Steak Roll, Crispy Kalbi Roll, and Jidori Chicken and again... lackluster.  :c  I could only taste the A-1 sauce in my steak roll and mostly only mayo from the coleslaw on my kalbi roll.  The rolls were overly sauced making it hard to even taste anything else!  Luckily the chicken was not so bad, and actually quite tasty and tender.  Thank goodness. But despite the chicken, it didn't save this place from the mediocre food and long wait times!  

Throughout dinner, everyone's food came out at various times so one or two people would get their food, while the other ten would sit there waiting.  And then another person gets their food 15 minutes later, while the other nine sit there waiting.  And then another one or two people would get their food 15 minutes later, while the other seven or eight people would sit there waiting... you get the idea.  By the time everyone's food came out and decided to order dessert, it took another half hour before it was brought out!  To the point, where we almost wanted to just call it quits and pay just to leave.  After having the dessert, it wasn't even worth the time we spent waiting... sigh.  It made the wait that much more terrible.  :c  This resulted in an 3.5+ hour, $$$$ mediocre dinner.  :c  Lots of thumbs down.  Waste of time and money if you ask me.",zLiMsSMhcr_lVXdmDy7_NA,2,1,2,fezGMjfR-bANkRz1A5QttA

The first two visits were just normal dinners, a little pricey but I felt like it was worth it for the food/ambiance/experience. 

My most recent visit was a little ridiculous because my friend is a pretty big gambler so our group of 5 had an extremely extravagant meal thanks to him. The best part was that we literally tried just about everything on the menu. 

Our flight got to Vegas at 9, we were at our villa by 915 and we called and asked for 36 oysters to be ready for us because we were starving. When we arrived they sat us right away and had the oysters ready in minutes! They were so delicious we ordered a second batch. 

All the sushi was fresh and delicious (you can see in the pictures I posted), the lobster was really amazing (I actually don't even like lobster to begin with so I was pleasantly surprised when I was going back for seconds) Even the lobster tempura was good, it literally melts in your mouth. 

We also had the most AMAZING bottle of wine. It was $1700, so normally we would never but since it was on the casino's dime, why not? I think it was called the Montrachet (I posted a picture of the bottle incase you wanted to try it) but it was the most expensive white wine they had. 

We also tried one of everything on the desert menu, I'm not too crazy about sweets but the ice cream was pretty bomb. 

It was a fun experience, honestly it is overpriced and pricey but you're in Vegas at the Bellagio so what do you expect? It's got a killer view if you're seated near the balcony so go let loose and have some FUN!",SAVq9t6Hs561yzp5-ZvCVA,3,2,5,a21oZFBvUqmekPtc6pt5ig

1.  Atmosphere - wow, it was really nice.  The restaurant is pretty intimate and cozy (kinda dark with light music in the background).  If I had to do it over again, I would recommend making reservations to sit outside on the balcony.  On the balcony, you would have a full view of the Bellagio Fountains playing while you eat.  We learned of this AFTER we sat down.  Next time!
2.  Service - so so, they were quite busy and a lot of the waiters took their time.  However, I must admit that the hostesses are incredibly attractive...LOL... my wife gave me a few angry looks..lol.. oh well.
3.  We all ordered the set menu.  It is a 7 course fish.  By the way, quality is key here.  Funny thing, after our 4th dish, we jokingly mentioned that we may have to swing by the In and Out Burger joint to get a filling.  However, the 5th to 7th course is a bit heavier and actually made us full.
As for the food, I would highly recommend the sliced Halibut , the yellowtail/salmon/tuna salad, and the Kobe Medallion beef.  Wow. 
We capped it off with green tea ice-cream... very good.
Drinks are kinda cool.  They have their own variations of mixed drinks.
4.  Price -- extremely pricey.  Usually reserve for special occassions.
5.  Dress code - we were a bit surprised that it was not more of a dressy crowd.  We saw a few jeans and several in shorts.  For an upscale restaurant, we thought it was a bit odd... I guess you are on the strip.

I was actually really excited to try this place because the menu looked amazing.
I tried a few of the cocktails not exactly sure what the names were but had a cucumber essence, something with blood orange in it, a lychee one and the konpai?

The Cucumber Essence one smelled strongly of just cucumber. It wasn't sweet like some other cucumer drinks I've had in the past. It smelled like straight cucumber and alcohol. It was meh. The one with the blood orange was great! I loved it. It was sweet but not overly sugary. The lychee one was a little sweeter than the blood orange. Both great. The Konpai was really tart.

They had several dishes brought out for us to try. We had the big eye tuna pizza which was really good but small. Had a few sushi rolls that were ok.

I understand people not wanting to pay the price of high quality sushi - it's expensive, I get it. But it's truly a culinary experience. When you get good fish, cut with artistry and finesse, served well in a beautiful setting, then it's a price worth paying. 

I absolutely love sushi. I've had good and bad experiences all over the globe. This, while not in my #1 slot, it does make the top 5. The cuts are perfect. Thick,  uniform, and precisely sized. The fish itself melts in your mouth, as it should. The edamame was crisp, and well seasoned (I didn't care for the chili seasoning, but my husband did). The seaweed salad was perfectly prepared. 

Drinks: I started with an infusion. A pineapple sake cocktail. Probably one of the most dangerous drinks on the planet. So good! The sake selection is extensive and will take another visit to explore more throughly, but impressive nonetheless. 

Service: Our waiter was triple sat with us (party of 2), a party of 7, and a party of 10. Come on guys, that's just not fair. But in our servers defense, he handled it expertly. He asked for help from other staff when he was overwhelmed and the support staff always stopped to refill our glasses or clear the plates. To someone who doesn't notice those sorts of things, it would have been seamless. To me it was server perfection. Well done! 

Atmosphere: This is a nice get away from the bustle of the casino. You can't hear the commotion from the dining area and the views of the fountains are spectacular! It's a beautiful setting and quite conducive to an enjoyable evening. The music is quiet, yet enjoyable and the decor is hip and trendy, yet elegant and well executed. 

In conclusion, I'm sad that yellowtail doesn't get better reviews. While I only enjoyed the sushi on this visit, I would be willing to try more. Including the chefs choice menu with 7 courses and a sake pairing! 

Well done over all, Yellowtail. A specific thank you to Chef Akira Back and your team!",TGo6H2hP6myp1tFgDsbP0g,3,1,5,pTGSr2sBZdf9G5ziXD6wVg

I made reservations at Yellowtail for my husband's birthday. He loves sushi and could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and the place was not that busy. No big deal there...it happens...sometimes you have to wait. 
Then there was the food. Becca F. was right in her review...""sushi chefs everywhere are embarrassed"". We order the 7 course chef's tasting menu. After each course I was hoping and praying it would get better. I kept thinking...How could it get any worse? I was wrong every single time. Then we finally got to the dessert and it was bad! How do you screw up dessert? 
Even the service left lots to be desired. Since we had 7 courses we often watched our next courses take a couple laps around the restaurant before it made it to our table. A few waiters that didn't know their table numbers I suppose. No big deal, until the ice cream was practically completely melted on the dessert by the time it came to our table. 
The ONLY thing that was good about this meal was the Sapporo and we all know Yellowtail had nothing to do with that. I have been reading a lot of the other reviews on this sight and I wish I would have read them before I went. 
Here's the kicker for those of you that are still reading...After dropping almost $400 on this crappy birthday dinner we went directly from the restaurant to Taco Bell. My husband didn't eat any Taco Bell because he was full from eating my meal and his meal at the restaurant because he didn't want to waste it at those prices. Now the next morning, as I type this review, my husband is having a hard time trying to decide which end to put on the toilet first because he has FOOD POISONING!!!",KvTgMSLPS4gABtZepy_ZUA,0,0,1,ojKLCWBCY-IVTlmG0M9EXg

1659144,2014-01-16,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Went here after a conference and had a wonderful experience. There were five of us so we went all out. We ordered a ton of dishes and while the ""signature"" or special dishes were the BEST EVER, the spicy tuna roll (which I think is a pretty basic staple) was the only let down really.

I tried the following dishes, and I have listed in order of how amazing they were:

1. Yellowtail Serrrano - go figure, the yellowtail dish was the best dish at a restaurant named Yellowtail. Thinly sliced with jalapeno and cilantro, the worst part of this was it was 6 pieces and there were 5 of us... dilemma.
2. Rock Shrimp Handroll - this was so yummy, I didn't even offer a bite to the others.
3. Big Eye Tuna Pizza - I'm unsure why others don't like this... it was delicious and a perfect appetizer.
4. Rock Shrimp / Tempura Alaskan King Crab - these were similarly prepared dishes but complemented each other well. When the Rock Shrimp would get a bit too sweet, the Alaskan King Crab balanced it nicely.
5. Red Dragon roll - I only got one piece of this, but it was the best Red Dragon I've ever had. I think the others agreed with me as... you know... I only got one piece.
6. Fillet Mignon Toban - sizzling and amazing. It comes out in a tiny skillet with the best mushrooms I've had in a while. The only reason it's this low on the list is because that is just how awesome all the other food was.

Now, the last two are the only two that we didn't finish, or I wouldn't order again:
7. Kobe Beef Tataki - maybe because it came out with the Yellowtail and just couldn't hold it's own. I really can't remember that much about it.
8. Tempura Veggies - run-of-the-mill like the spicy tuna roll.

I want to go back again and get a table by the windows so I can watch the fountains of the Bellagio while I feast on fish.",8MUbEirRpX4qwiQhj0SWfA,1,1,4,gybwXcS14dOSkaf3HCg-zw

First off, what a great location- no doubt a reason for the prices. Yes the drinks are expensive. Get over it, you're in the Bellagio

The menu is excellent, something for everyone and even adhering to the ""meat heads"" that Las Vegas attracts. Everything has a great deal of different flavors and textures going on all at once. 

My server was Guy B, absolutely amazing. Very smooth and attentive to our every need and expectation! He gave us great recommendations and wasn't pushy! I highly recommend him to anyone who wants great service! 

We were a table of two and ordered Tuna pizza, Lobster carpaccio, Alaskan King Crab Tempura, Rock shrimp hand roll, protein roll, and cup of chocolate, and Oolong tea!! 
The lobster carpaccio was great! Nice and light! The king crab tempura was outstanding- nothing like i have had before in terms of SUBSTANTIAL King Crab. Rock shrimp roll was good, I would most likely try something different next time. The protein roll is a must!  Cup of chocolate was a great twist on a classic! Banana foam is a nice touch!

All is all, amazing meal, amazing service! So why the four stars instead of five? Well I was looking around and it seems that We got lucky with our waiter! Next to us, i was watching a waiter pour beer into a class(not tilted) and it completely over flowed on the table. The waiter seemed to just walk away before he could watch the inevitable happen. Also, it seems theres a lot of confusion with tables, many of the food runners were making mistakes around us involving table numbers. Either a lot of the runners don't know the table numbers or theres a lack of communication.

Last words: sushi rice was warm- GREAT hard to find warm sushi rice anywhere! They are good with allergies such as Celiac!",3s50bA1myv2f5TzkCt60_w,1,1,4,-JashkeK2GmIBclOFv3Arg

This roll had actual pop rocks in it and was so much fun to eat! Note to all sushi places, start using pop rocks! I loved the sweetness from it and it all came together so well.

Next we had the Kobe beef flat iron which came with baby root vegetables & potato purée. On the side you receive warm teriyaki glaze and it was smooth & sweet. This dish was good but nothing special. Ordered a side of mushrooms that were great! 

We also had a few cocktails, one was the sunset that contained grey goose l'orange, blood orange purée and yuzu (nothing special) and then the Infusion which contained pineapple & vanilla infused ""early bloom"" sake and Bacardi light rum (loved this one) the drink presentations were beautiful with very feminine touches like an orchid and an orange twist.

1876900,2014-01-17,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Trendy, trendy, oh so trendy. Yellowtail greets you with scantily clad exotic waitresses (this is Vegas after all) and you eat your small portioned Japanese gastro pub dishes while endless techno club music pounds in the background. While eating Japanese food in this manner isn't really my style, and holding a conversation at a table larger than two was rather difficult, Yellowtail did leave my tastebuds popping with pleasure from a few select dishes. One minus was that the food took a while to come out. It's a truly one of a kind place from which to view the Bellagio fountain show. They have a balcony you can watch from, and you're on the side of the Bellagio right up in the action - I could feel a slight mist from the shooting water!

My favorites:

Seaweed salad: The seaweed was fresh, with two different kinds, and the sauce was tangy and refreshing.

Salmon and sweet shrimp sashimi: The salmon was a more expensive cut than you usually get, a darker orange salmon with more punchy flavor. I've had sweeter ones, but these shrimp were up there and fresh. The heads were fried to perfection, and you could eat 100% of the fried shell. Crunchy!

Big eye tuna pizza: Now here's something innovative and unique. You're getting fusion cuisine at its best, with thinly slice tuna sashimi laid on top of thin cracker style crust, with truffle flavors and small garnish tying it all together in a savory finish. This was a wonderful surprise and really got my umami on. I loved the pairing of the truffle with tuna sashimi and the crunchy texture of the crust to offset the soft raw fish.

Protein roll: We tried a few rolls and this was by far the head of the class. It's called the protein roll because there's no rice! A well seasoned seafood and fish egg mix is wrapped inside layers of fresh sashimi. The roll disappeared in seconds, and one of our party didn't even get to try a piece! Oops.

Other things we tried:

The Kobe beef tataki was pretty good; the texture of the raw beef was phenomenal, as it was fresh Kobe, and you could see the delicate marbling in the meat. However it seemed a waste to drown it in a soy sauce based sauce, with raw garlic slices as garnish, since they are both very strong flavors and high quality beef should be worshipped instead of overpowered.

The Alaskan king crab tempura was apparently featured on Best Things I Ever Ate with Chopsticks. I thought that it was good, and the sauce was savory and tangy, but it didn't seem like anything special enough for a TV show. How could something fried like that be bad? Seems a shame for fresh crab.

We tried some other rolls, but none else were memorable. The vegetable tempura was nothing special, the rock shrimp tempura had a mayo-y spicy sauce and was good, but like something from a seriously upscale Buffalo Wild Wings.",1f9d6R0fSmQX99uf7AS9Gg,3,1,4,BXnadC4LoF8-kO2JZetyGA

If I'm paying Vegas prices, I want there to be ""no limit"" to the hours something is served. So, if I want sushi in a restaurant that is located in the lobby of the Bellagio, it should be served all night, not until eleven PM. 11 PM?! Really? Because I'm not a Vegas local I'm most likely just getting out of a show then, or maybe 1/4 of the way into my night. Serve sushi all night...it's a good business model.

However, if you do serve sushi, don't put white onion in it. It's totally gross. Maybe the chef was playing a joke on us.

Dinner for two: $80 including a horrible plate of mushrooms and ""sauce"" that tasted like something from my high school cafeteria; that weird ""onion roll,"" and something tempura'd, which can never go wrong. 

Also, the server insisted on reaching our table by maneuvering through a tiny gap between my left shoulder and the wall. It was like someone was sneaking up on my, only they were bringing me my chopsticks. 

I'm sure this is a fun place to have a drink (we weren't given a drink menu) but our vodka tonics were watered down. 

Eh, you get what you get when you go for convenience in Vegas.",HiiPiXK1VFmltxArg7X18w,1,0,1,sr8R5Kx7Qg7JoVdpEkPoow

With that being said.... Our server  Emmanuel was very attentive. He asked once, by name, if we were waiting on the birthday girl. After he knew who she was... He kept calling her by name all night. Even snuck the dessert menu over to us while she was on a bathroom break! He's good... Really good! I'm was stuck trying to figure out how he got her to go to the bathroom on queue. Lmao
 
Right away we ordered the edamame, in which we wanted both bowls to be sweet chili instead of sea salt (the best way to order them). 

There were a few things on the table... Let's see if I can remember them all.   

My favorite roll is the high steaks! It's a shrimp tempura roll topped with filet mignon and A1 sauce. It's a interesting combination... But a good one. 

Mushroom as a side.... Soooo much flavor!!!! 

Rock shrimp- a little dry. Not as good as Nobu

Chilean Sea bass- great tasting... Small serving. 

Nope, can barely remember anything else (I had a lot to drink) but I'll post the pictures! 

Just make sure when you come here you bring both of your wallets, because it won't be a cheap night out. Also, if you're in a big group they don't split checks... Not even three ways!!!!",a9UymHuKxZKMnHXOo3nLKA,3,2,4,cPp2sAxSF-4vfQqex5If5g

2) Seaweed Salad
3) Kobe Short Ribs

The poppy crab roll is a novelty and if you haven't had it, its worth a try. The rib eye is also a decent slab of meat, topped with crushed wasabi root I believe.

There is a long bar in front and the dining in the back which also includes out door dining that overlooks the Bellagio Fountains and the show they put on. The environment is chic, comfortable and the staff is very good.

The bar is very petty and they make a great drink something many sushi places don't do well. Here the drinks are strong, it could be because it's Vegas. The staff is knowledgeable.

The food is fantastic. Plates tend to be small but that works well as it lets you order many different things. Some stand outs from the shared plates for me are the Lobster Carpaccio and the Yellowtail Serrano amazingly light and citrusy but both with some spice to them. Both of these are cold plates and i could not get enough. We reordered these multiple times. The warm shared plates i enjoyed were the Black Code and Seafood Dynamite. Both were wonderfully balanced with many layers of flavor.

We ordered quite a bit of sushi and i am not sure now what all of it was. I had my standard Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and then some of their specialty rolls.

2136879,2010-09-04,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"While my girlfriend and I were in the Bellagio waiting for the performance of ""O"", we decided we would stop and eat at one of the many restaurants in the Bellagio floor. We had already eaten the Buffet, so we narrowed it down to the four or five remaining restaurants. Yellowtail had the shortest line, and I had been in the mood for sushi for a few days, so we stopped in.
The setting is very intimate, very cool. There's a small section inside next to the bar, a few tables spread throughout the restaurant, and a few tables on a deck looking out over the casino floor. We were seated immediately, and the service was outstanding. Very, very beautiful hostesses and servers took care of us all night long.
Had a few different rolls and a few orders of sashimi. The pace of the meal was pretty good, as we got our drinks and soup immediately, then slowly started receiving the rolls and sushi as the meal went on. It was at a good enough pace where you could eat and enjoy the meal, yet not have huge plates covering the table, spread out every which way. Overall, the quality of the sushi was very good, and the taste was great also. 
For the restaurant, I was going to go with three stars. The food was good, but I've had better sushi at many local restaurants throughout the country, and it was WAY cheaper. The price of this restaurant certainly doesn't reflect the taste, although it was good, just not for the price. The service definitely knocked it up to four stars, however. Our waitress was exceptional, and the entire meal was very relaxing and enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for sushi on the strip, as it probably won't get any cheaper unless you go somewhere else in Vegas. Definitely enjoyed the experience, and I would probably stop here again.",UY3x_8KhKlrqVSDE0QKV8A,2,0,4,iis2N7u4j8L18wNCz8GGJg

I came here for my birthday dinner. I expected to pay a lot, but I didn't expect the food to be this good!

The decor was just in my taste, gold, warm colors, dimmed lights - just a romantic, pleasant atmosphere. Tables aren't too close together, so we had our privacy. LOVED IT!

THE FOOD IS EXQUISITE! I was extremely happy with EVERYTHING we ordered.

Big Eye Tuna Pizza - simply delicate and delicious. The truffle oil was an amazing addition.
Baked Crab and Rock Shrimp Hand Rolls - delicious and tender
Madlon Sea Salt and Sweet Chili Edamame is a MUST - a very nice twist to edamame!
Sake was good as well!

The SERVICE WAS SUPERB! Our waiter was pleasant, cooperative, and attending without hesitation. He was very helpful with any unfamiliar items on the menu.  He truly deserved a big tip!

The bill was a bit pricier than what I usually pay for Japanese, however, it was worth it. Plus for the Bellagio, the prices were considerably cheap!

Pretty great find in Vegas. Took my cheap a** friends here one night while we were in Vegas. They wanted to eat at Outback Steakhouse since they spent the day buying designer belts, but I was NOT down for that. I told them that this place had a steak too... a grown up steak.

Anyways, I had the spicy tuna roll, the eel roll, and the surf clam sushi.
Spicy tuna: just the right amount of spice. Had a great kick to it and the fish tasted super fresh. Also had some scallions thrown in there which heightened the flavor a bit
Eel roll: Pretty good. IMO it's pretty easy to mess up an eel roll by dousing it with sauce, but this was perfect.
Surf clam sushi: Best surf clam I've had in awhile. Surf clam can be awfully tough and hard to chew, but this was great. Surf clam was tender and just the perfect consistency. 

Our server was amazing. He was very accommodating to my friends and I. Regularly checked up on us, topped up our drinks, and made sure that our table was spotless. 

My friends didn't want to admit that they had the best steak of their lives that night, despite the small portions, but I'll take their facial expressions at face value.

There are some Korean influences, such as onion and corn in the seafood dynamite ($23).  I never really liked dynamite anything - covering perfectly good food in mayo or cream cheese is just not my thing.

2347910,2016-08-20,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"This place is so expensive but also so good! Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I always leave this place satisfied and wanting more and with a hole in my wallet lol. Well, technically I'm not the one paying but you know what I mean. Last time we came with the party of 8 and the tab came out to be around $1,600 including tax and tip. 

Let's talk about the setting of the restaurant. It's located in the casino of Bellagio. It's next to the fountain. If you get seat by balcony like we did, you get to experience the fountain show from inside the hotel. It's a completely different feeling than experiencing it on the Strip. It's much closer that way and you can enjoy it without being in a huge crowd of people. As you'd expect from a high end restaurant, the setting inside is fancy. It's dim a little giving sense of romanticness, so it's a perfect place to take your date. 

The food. There large selection of food and honestly they're all great. Though these are my personal favorites: tuna pizza, yellowtail, flat iron steak, ribeye, and Scottish salmon. 

-The tuna pizza is a thinly sliced pizza served with raw tuna on top. I thought it was an interesting combination at first. I mean, raw tuna on pizza? Does that even go together? Oh man, let me tell you, it does. And it does great. It has the soft and juiciness of the tuna and the crunchiness of the pizza. This was our party's favorite and we just kept ordering these. They come at $29 a plate though. 
-The yellowtail has got to the best yellowtail I've eaten. My go to food at most Japanese restaurants is grilled yellowtail cheek, so I've tasted plenty of yellowtails, but this is honestly the best one I've tasted. Well I mean you'd expect it to be good, afterall it's the name of the restaurant. The fish is juicy and soft and just melt in your mouth. It's not dry like some places. 
-I'm going to review the ribeye and flat iron together. They were both great. The quality of beef is excellent and it's super soft. However my only complaint was that they were a little burnt. Maybe the chef was a little off today, but the outside of the beef were a tad bit burnt. This wasn't the case with my previous visits. Aside from that it tastes heavenly. 
-The Scottish salmon also tastes great. Not much to say about it. Just your average salmon, but they just somehow seasoned it and made it taste so good. Maybe the chef used his secret sauce or something? ;) lol jk but seriously it's good.",moLOf2NP6uYHQVwZ66xEiQ,0,0,5,ME4Is9qhPNV2DiE--MEB-w

It was NOT busy at all and she took 15 minutes to refill waters after we asked, and we had to ask for our bill twice and then get up and ask at the hostess stand for it. Ridiculous.

I got the tuna pizza based on her recommendation since she said it's what they were known for. It was delicious. My bf's chicken meal was crazy good too and he loved it.

yellowtail serves sushi for a very high price.  and as the food came we joked that we had to go to mcdonalds afterwards.  we ordered the big eyed tuna pizza which the server said was the most popular.  it had truffle oil and was pretty good.  bascially tuna on crackers.  i had seaweed salad - nothing spectacular here except the price.  and also a clear soup - again nothing spectacular.  thei lobster carpaccio is not raw.  the lobster has been poached.

they have this really high energy sommelier/sake specialist (?)  

for dessert mochi and tempura ice cream.  a bigger ball of ice cream would given us more ice cream after frying.  we got a lot of melted vanilla ice cream on our plate.  i never order mochi because its not like they make it.  they just buy it and put it on a plate and charge us much more.

2422541,2008-07-25,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"On a weekender to Vegas, my gf and I were hungering for sushi one night and the concierge of our hotel (Monte Carlo) suggested going to Yellowtail, the newest restaurant at the Bellagio.  Only open a week,  one might expect some hiccups along the way, but the food was top notch and the service was even more so.

The outside entrance signals the restaurant's presence with a beautifully decorated, massive glass tile mosaic of a yellowtail fish.  Indoors, posh, elegant, with clean yet comfortable lines in a contemporary style. 

Seated at the bar (since we had no reservation), the service didn't slack one bit as our bar waitress was more than knowledgeable, explaining the vast menu choices and offering helpful suggestions on what to order.   Despite the busy atmosphere of having to juggle bar mixology and restaurant patrons, she checked up on us often and made us feel comfortable.  

Food wise, my best description for this dining experience would be - sushi fusion.  Combining East and West sensibilities into sushi produced some unique flavor combinations that I've never tasted before.  I'm not talking about your typical California roll here.  Think banana flavored sake, strawberry topped rolls in place of unagi, Big Eye Tuna Pizza with shiso, Toro Sashimi with caviar and microgreens.  The crab dynamite was delicious with generous chunks of crab meat, and a hint of spiciness. 

One of their signature selections is the Grand Omikase, a six course tasting menu based on the chef's* fancy that day.  I would highly recommend this, as it's the most bang for the buck, and you get to taste a vast array of flavors.  Kobe beef fans will be satisfied as this includes  Washu beef (a domestic breed of Kobe) offered in a tenderloin cut; a texture that just melted in my mouth.

Some might think sushi fusion is a bastardization against tradition, but I think it's fun.  Why not try something new?  Your palate might thank you for it.

I have eaten at a lot of of good sushi places in Vegas and elsewhere in the world and went i went to Yellowtail, i figured this was going to be amazing as it is in the Bellagio..Firstly, way over priced for the quality and selection. Second, the selection was terrible. When you only see a selection of 12 rolls, you would think that these 12 rolls are probably really good specialty rolls super rolls, nice and big... Not.. They were regular rolls. A regular tuna roll which is $5.00 anywhere you go (tuna, rice wrapped in seaweed), at yellowtail, it was $16.00..I will admit the salmon Sashimi and the salmon sushi was delicious. 4 ppl, did not eat much as all, $450.00...We actually left Yellowtail so disappointed and hungry and went for another dinner. The second place was better for a fraction of the price. Went to RA in the fashion mall. Now this place isnt the best, but we had a much better meal, we ordered more food than we did at Yellowtail and the check was $100.00...I never take the time to write reviews, but this yellowtail was so disappointing and overpriced that i had to write a review..PPl, stay away.........Now i see a lot of people giving this place 4 & 5 stars...Fake..Fake ratings...PPL in Vegas are being paid to write up bogus reviews in behalf of this place..There is no way this place should ever get 5 stars..They only thing that gets 5 stars for this place is the decor..IT is really nice..But they are charging you for it..NO thanks...Yellowtail get Yellowfail...If there was a a seventh dollar sign, i would pick it..$14.00 for 2 pieces of sushi or sashimi...That is $7.00 per piece..Terrible..",XXYvaVIOy38Q4XqWzh_Bjg,0,0,1,WwODQZkRhMqJpG2fcp9wWw

We waited 30 minutes for one of our pre dinner drinks and 30 min for a hot tea I ordered after dinner.  She forgot one of our rolls.  And she never seemed the slightest apologetic or embarrassed.

2563297,2011-10-15,14,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"WHERE: Inside the Bellagio Hotel/Casino.

WHEN: Dinner only! Monday-Thursday, 5pm-10pm. Friday-Sunday, 5pm-11pm. It is also recommended to make reservations during the weekend just incase it gets a little busy.

WHY: The dishes are worth the while (or at least the ones that I got the pleasure to try tonight! =D)

WHAT: So... first thing's first. I actually got home not too long ago from eating here.  Right after my amazing experience in this great atmosphere, the only thing I could think of was ""I'm so going home and writing a review!"" So here I am, and here I go...

One of my good friends has been talking about how great everything was for the past year. So after a year, we finally got together to make it happen! Prior to getting to the restaurant, I was extremely giddy and excited!!

When we got to the restaurant, checked in, and got seated, we automatically were asked what we wanted to drink. Tangent! Before I forget, customer service was at its best! Anyways, back to my experience. We weren't as hungry, so we all decided to get an appetizer each and share. =) That's what friends are for.

FOOD: Keep in mind, the portions are small, but so worth your taste buds!

We started off with Edamame.  There were 2 bowls, one with cold, salted edamame beans, and the other with a warm and cooked-in-some-good sauce (sweet chili) edamame beans. Always such a great starter!

Eggplant Skewers:  One thing, I am not an eggplant fan, but I am not afraid to try it. My friend recommended I try this, and thank goodness she made that recommendation! It did not taste like eggplant at all. It tasted like bbq on a stick brushed with sweet miso and sesame sauce goodness. KUDOS!

Big Eye Tuna Pizza:  Definitely not like your ordinary pizza! One of greatest things I have ever eaten! To simplify such a magnificent dish, it was smoked tuna on some type of cracker/bread (which made it a pizza). Everyone must try this! KUDOS!

Popping Spicy Crab: Why come to a sushi joint and not order at least one roll?! We made the right choice. If like uniqueness in taste, be sure to taste this roll! Who would have thought that pop rocks (candy) can enhance a simple sushi roll?! It was magical! KUDOS!

Lava Cake: For dessert (I always have my heart, mouth, and tummy ready for dessert), I was given the duty of choosing. I chose correct! To explain this lava cake, it was a small, dark chocolate-filled cake, topped with banana foam, and lychee ice cream on the side! Perfect amount, perfect taste, just pure perfection!

To sum it all up, I had a wonderful time with my friends, the staff, and most definitely the food. We also got to say hello and converse with Chef Akira Back! He is very down-to-earth and such a great chef!

I leave you with this. KUDOS, KUDOS, KUDOS!",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,15,14,5,H_8RawYSA7rBcRcDbEoq4w

2633629,2015-07-14,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I don't usually leave reviews but I felt like the service here was exceptionally bad/ SLOW. Here's my experience:
Ambiance- very beautiful/sexy. Casual near the bar, dressier inside. 
Food- great, not exceptional. Tiny portions, which is fine for most dishes in sushi restaurants but not others for the price. They need to learn from Nobu here.  $30 tuna pizza- pricey but worth it bc it's original. $60 for one order of toro sushi (2 pieces).... Not so much. 
Service- if I had nothing else planned for the evening, it might be mildly tolerable. We put in an order for 6 items and they rolled out 20-25 apart. Nobody wants to put a tiny piece of fish in their mouth and wait 20+ minutes for the next piece. When we tried to order more food, the server told us that everything roll-like will take 40 minutes and that we should only order off the appetizer page. Obviously this limited our ordering substantially. 

This was my first time asking for a manager at a restaurant and he told me that these wait times were very normal. Not how you want to treat guests in my opinion. Never had such an experience at Nobu, Mastros, Katsuya, Mizumi, or anywhere else in LA or Vegas. This ruined the experience for me.

It was a special night for us (anniversary, which nobody mentioned or cared about) and we wanted to have a great time. But sitting at dinner to only grow hungrier was not the way to do it. Next time, we will take our money back to Mizumi, which is a guaranteed five star experience.",d1zQqVT9XcplmHxBE1Mo3A,0,0,2,1fasUy2Mchl3KNGaaHcRhw

2646062,2012-09-08,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Lets walk through from the beginning. We had a reservation for 9:30 pm. We showed up precisely at 9:30 and checked in, were asked to give them a minute and please go to the bar if we wished. We waited a couple minutes for a place at the bar to open up and then ordered a drink. We sat and watched as walk ups were seated before us, including a couple of girls who walked up and hugged the hostess and were seated immediately. While I am not too stupid to understand that some people ""deserve"" to be seated immediately, it was disheartening seeing walk-ups get seated before us. I guess I wouldnt have a problem if they said they dont accept reservations, but they do, so I didnt understand the point of having one if it took 20-25 minutes to get seated.

So with that negative, lets say a positive. Our servers was perhaps the best server Ive had at any restaurant, high end or otherwise. I believe his name was Nick. Just wanted to give a shout-out because he was that good. We never ask to speak with management, but made sure we did this time to put in a good word for our server.

So, the food. It was good, and some of it great. Pricey, but then again, we knew that going in.

The yellowtail Serrano appetizer was outstanding. It practicably melted in my mouth. The Gyoza app was good, but nothing special.

The edamame was good too, I mean, its edamame, how could you mess it up? I wasnt a fan of the sweet chile flavor, but the gf loved it. The japanese pickles salad was awesome!

One of their signature rolls is the Popping Spicy Crab...it was ok. Seemed a little gimmicky, but wasnt bad. The yellowtail scallion roll was very tasty, as was the spicy tuna roll. I also had some scallop sashimi...it was very tender and had good flavor.

Overall impression, it was good, but slightly over-priced. You pay for the atmosphere and to be at the ""cool"" place to be. Dont get me wrong, the food was good, and I wouldnt hesitate to go back again, but just be warned you arent going to be absolutely blown away with some new type of sushi. You are going for good sushi (better than 90% of places), and for the atmosphere with outstanding service (once you get seated).",reSiLbRNq_kCVD5RGI780Q,0,0,4,YxtT6TnySSh7OHh9nP67Xw

2680518,2012-01-16,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"NOT A RUN OF THE MILL SUSHI BAR...

Well, I guess I'm a little biased with this review.  You see, I visited YT on a night where the stars were completely aligned.  

Akira Back present - Check
Cameraman filming Akira Back - Check
Akira Back dedicated to our table alone (due to the 10+ group)- Check

I'm typically not a big Vegas sushi joint kind of guy.  I like my hole in the wall, off the beaten path sushi places.  I think that there are sushi chef's in smaller places that outperform the renowned.  Perfect example is Crazy Sushi in St. Peters, MO.  One of the best IMO.  Why do they not have a Crazy Sushi in a Vegas casino?  Thus going into YT I was skeptical, and preparing for the same roll I could get somewhere not Vegas for a lot less $$$.

Yellow tail was a great experience, and I understand why Akira has his own place at the Bellagio.  This isn't Dragon, Philly, or Vegas rolls, and if that's what you want go elsewhere because you are going to overpay for very basic sushi.  Sushi is a very tiny piece of YT.  Notice this says Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant, and not Yellowtail Sushi Bar.  There you have it... I have still avoided going to a Vegas sushi bar.

Like I said, we were treated to a much different experience than someone who waltzed in on any given night.  Akira is not always in, and I doubt I will ever visit a restaurant again where the chef is being filmed while making my dinner.  FYI Akira Back was on Iron Chef North America...   

We did a hybrid Omakase  which is the 7 course sampler.  I think we received over 7 courses, and I think this was due to Akira, and the camera guy.  Again, stars aligned...  Also we agreed with the server to let him make whatever he wants for us which probably didn't hurt either.

From the first dish which was his pizza, I started realizing why YT is different, and not a sushi bar.  I really like truffle oil when it's applied to the right dish.  You wouldn't think raw fish would mesh well with the pungent truffle oil, but it goes great with the other flavors of the pizza.  

The kobe beef tataki was awesome, as was the protein roll.  

The pop rock roll was just odd to say the least, but was freaking amazing.  Pop rocks in sushi WTF?  Only in Vegas.  There was also a roll brought out, and I want to say it had strawberries and tuna in it.  

There was agrilled walu which was outstanding...  

The kobe short rib dish he made for us was awesome as well.  I think we asked for another round of the ribs, and walu.  

I could have done without the rock shrimp.  Shrimp is just meh for me. I don't get excited over it because well... its just shrimp.  Shrimp should be the chicken of the sea, not canned tuna.  With that being said, the table loved it, and if you are a shrimp lover you'll go nuts over it.

Anyhow, those were some of the dishes that really stood out for me at YT.     I'm pretty sure we had something chicken and sashimi as well.  They were good, but drowned out by the quality of the courses I mentioned.

Appearance, flavor, and quality were top notch.  Akira Back should be very proud of his ability to be extremely creative with food, and a pallet that knows what goes.

Would I have enjoyed the restaurant as much on any other night? I don't know.  I  wouldn't have been as daring and would have just ordered some rolls, and the pizza.  I probably wouldn't have went to YT because I would have thought it was just another sushi joint.  Things happen for a reason right?  I can share my experiences so you can either walk-in, or walk-by.  

I think this place is well worth the money.  Sure it's expensive, but seriously folks... if you're worried about price why the hell are you considering eating at the Bellagio to begin with?  Hey I look for the 5.00 tables, but that's only because I am a shitty gambler.  For dinner I go all in...",EosqAeelddiMeS1Lk5kYsA,1,3,5,klVFP0ODb8WzSq_3ka5sEA

And the love of my pallet, their Kobe steak, it's like a meat explosion in your mouth... (um, wow, screw it, I'm leaving it just like that.)... It IS pricey... the Kobe alone will run you upwards of 40 green backs for a pretty small steak (I couls easily crush two of them).  But its worth it!
Drinks are really well made here, order something different, you;ll be surprised.
And if you want to eat here, call ahead, if the weather is nice, ask for fountain side outdoor seating, best ground level view of the Bellagio fountain show.
Oh yeah, they have this sweet deal... if you buy Cirque De Soleil ""O"" show tickets, you can upgrade to a package deal for 13 more dollars, the package includes a free drink at a bellagio bar, your O show tix, and dinner at Yellowtail!!! Of course, its off of a limited menu, but still very tasty stuff.  Try it out, and off topic, O will blow your MIND!

My husband and I go to Bellagio twice-yearly just to splurge and stay for the spa.  The multitude of restaurants and Buffet is excellent and the price never bothered me, until now. 
The ""dynamite"" Seafood dish was a mush of mostly canned corn, fried old shrimp and chewy leftover scallop pieces  amalgamated in an overly sweetened mayonnaise sauce.  EXCEEDINGLY OVERPRICED at $32. 
For four small lumps of Kobe ribs, you pay $42.  Each refill of Coca cola was $5. 
Very limited menu overall. Sushi is average and again, OVERPRICED at about $7-8 a PIECE. The Japanese yellowtail sashimi was tasteless and rubbery, for example.  
But lets talk about the worst service for an over-hyped restaurant where the decor cost needed to be made up in what you pay for bad food.  Each dish came out within 20min of each other.  Each person at my table waited and watched as the other person finished his meal.   Waiter said he would bring our meals but never did.  My second drink came at the end of my meal.

2999938,2014-09-24,2,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Our experience at this restaurant is the impetus  for writing my first review on yelp. My wife and I read the mixed reviews and decided to try it since we love sushi and unique dining experiences. I'd  have to say, this was one of the only vegas ""higher end"" meals that had left us disappointed, and sorry we didn't heed the warnings of those who had been disappointed  before us. We eat a LOT of sushi,  probably 6x or more a month. We tried two rolls (for a total of OVER $50) and were  completely  underwhelmed.  I've paid the same for similar sized rolls at sushi roku in Ceasars and didn't regret the price for a second because it was that good. Yellowtail? Meh.. ok flavor, pretty small size. Then we ordered  salmon sushi. My wife and I both laughed out loud when the order came. Others have scoffed at the size of the sushi pieces and we should have listened. I honestly can't even describe how small they were. I guess the best I could day is, take a standard ""pink eraser"" from when you were a kid in school, cut it in half, and that's the size of the order.  For $12. And, it was just ok. 

Then we get to the service. We were in vegas on a Sunday night. It was dead. Walked right into this place and could have had a seat on the terrace on the fountains had we asked. That's how dead it was. The waiter was running around like he had never been busier, checked on us maybe once and in the midst of his ""rush"" failed to bring a BOWL OF RICE that we ordered for my son. We had two rolls and a salmon sushi delivered approximately 20+ minutes after we had ordered, ate them and then sat around waiting for him to come back. He looked shocked when he asked if we wanted anything  else and I asked if we could get the food we ordered in the first place before we moved on to anything else. 

My wife and I eat out A LOT. It's a passion to try new things and explore new places. This place fell dead flat. Extremely disappointed  and thus, doubtful  we would ever return. Too many other great options out there. Not to mention much cheaper. It's unfortunate.  Great location and concept and beautiful decor.",qm7gqNdBDFoKBHBQDKn5sQ,2,0,2,lpj3VUaoypLWMRv0g7hccw

3021430,2009-01-13,4,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Yellowtail will not overly impress traditional sushi aficionados but for the jetset, it will make for a good change of scenery from Nobu at the HRH for those used to that sort of dining environment.  There are however a fair number of reasons why you might put this on your itinerary for your next Vegas trip: 

1) ""NOBU"" FOR ADULTS
The décor, the atmosphere, the music, the attractive hostesses... even many of the dishes are blatent clones of Nobu's aesthetic.  Some of Nobu's more famous plates like ""tuna tataki"" have been adapted to ""yellowtail tataki"".  Some dishes served, like Nobu's Toro Tartar, are available as flat out Xeroxed, down to the caviar accenting & ume plum garnish.

That being said, there are some improvements over Nobu that aren't hard to miss:
--- CROWD:  The clientele are of a, uh, higher caliber.  Being at the Bellagio makes Yellowtail a target for business dinners & younger committed couples.  This is by design, according to a friend who works there.
--- BAR:  The bar is very large & active, not to attract singles but to provide respite for individuals waiting for their tables.  There are 14 first-come-first-served 'bar tables' that you can just jump on & get served at.  And again, since it's at the Bellagio, you'll find it easier to dodge the patented HRH skanks & douchebags.
--- SERVICE:  There is a very strict code of service at Yellowtail where ""everyone on the waitstaff is held responsible for any customer's satisfaction"".  They have ""secret shoppers"" go through often to ensure service levels & with the exception of really busy days, this should shine through.
--- VIEW:  Call for the 'window view' reservations FAR in advance & you'll have a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains & the Eiffel Tower at Paris.

2) NOUVEAU JAPANESE DISHES
Like most ""trendy"" sushi restaurants, the Yellowtail menu has both traditional as well as avant garde dishes to satisfy any age palette.  Yellowtail didn't hold back in duplicating the ""Hot Dish/Cold Dish"" menu orientation of Nobu, & why should they?  It works & is immensely profitable.
A few notes:
--- ROCK SHRIMP:  Overly soaked in a cream thai hot sauce that mimics the ludicrous over-saucing of many of today's Americanized sushi ""rolls"".  Similar to a finger foods version of a ""911 roll"", this undoubtedly is a huge moneymaker w/ its cheap ingredients but familiar flavors.
--- TORO TARTAR:  An poor clone of Nobu's more famous dishes, this is disappointingly salty.  The soy sauce concoction that the minced toro w/ caviar sits in lacks the savory nature of Nobu's dish because they forgot the bonito stock.  As a result, its got a salty bite & at $39, it's as they say: EPIC FAIL.
--- SUSHI:  The salmon & mackerel were fairly good.  Fresh, select, cut correctly, & in good proportions.  The sweet shrimp were actually live amaebi surprisingly.  The deep fried head however was served luke warm, but it was also a pregnant shrimp providing a good amount of roe to accent the head & that sort of made up for it.  I expected the toro & the yellowtail to be good considering how much they must serve at the restaurant.
Rock Shrimp/Creamy spicy sauce:  3/5
Toro Tartar: 3/5
Salmon: 4/5
Spanish Mackerel: 4/5
Sweet Shrimp: 5/5
Sweet Shrimp head: 4/5
Toro: 4/5
Yellowtail: 4/5

3) SAKE MENU
Yellowtail has a fairly good sake menu that is price-designed very well to direct people to the cheaper high-margin Jokigen.  As a result, don't be surprised if it's ""out of stock"" as a result.
--- BEWARE THE SAKE 'SWITCH'
Don't order an expensive 'carafe' of sake if you don't know what you're doing.  I received a tokkuri of sake - the Mukune, which I've had many times before.   They serve the Junmai Ginjoshu which is dry & a little earthy but still lightly fragrant.  What was given to me was none of the above, making it either a) not Mukune or b) very old.  To the wait staff's surprise, I demanded that they bring out the sake bottle.  Not surprisingly, they chose not to & instead brought out a completely new unopened bottle of Mukune.  The bottle's production date was 9/08 & lo-and-behold, the flavor was greatly improved from the first.
--- EXPERT'S HINT:  If you order a 'carafe' of sake, request that your sake be served in a 'tokkuri' or ceramic flask COLD & have them bring out the bottle at Yellowtail.  And most importantly, do not let them pour it into those bamboo shoots - it distorts & changes the flavor.


CONCLUSION:
For the strip, this is about as good as you're going to get.  There's better in Vegas, but not by much.

4-stars.

-----
NOTE:
Yellowtail does not have the ""most comprehensive sake menu in Vegas"".  That award goes to Okada & Shibuya, as any sake distributor will confirm. 

And as for the dude that recommended ""the sushi bar inside Caesar's Palace (next to Cleopatra's Barge)"" over Yellowtail, that place is called ""Hyakumi"".  It has an all-you-can-eat sushi deal during lunch if that tells you anything. [shakes head]",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,6,6,4,pPkjTm0gLJQy32i1GIVF3Q

I am certainly no sushi expert. I know the basics and that's about it, but, I do appreciate sushi that is fresh and prepared correctly.  I hate rolls that fall apart when they hit the chopsticks. That's not the case here... every thing is fresh and tightly wrapped.

I also love that this restaurant isn't afraid to to take chances. You can go to hundreds of Japanese restaurants and see the same exact menu... but to see things like sushi made with pop rocks or big eye tuna pizza- that jumps off the page. I love the originality!

The pop rock sushi was fun. The taste of sushi was fresh and delicious and then the aftertaste of the pop rocks fizzing in your mouth made it even more enjoyable. The tuna was delectable as well. Fresh and plenty of flavor and surprisingly easy to chew. I had other sushi rolls like spicy tuna and eel and avocado but those two items were the most memorable.

Also worth noting is the view. If you are fortunate enough to get a view of the fountain it doesn't get any better than that.

As many have already mentioned, the only complaint are the prices. The portions aren't large so you have to order a lot and then you are stuck with a huge bill.",Tf9eq2qBukCUDHNgsIR5NA,0,0,4,WvdvPuqW116gbStnsFRhkw

Food, and I get it, you're a 'high-end' restaurant, was forgettable. The proportions were small and butchered. High end or not there is an art to cutting sushi.

Our meal:

'Sushi'
Hamachi - VERY good, best part of my meal, but again, each slice was about the size of my pinky
Tuna - quality of the meat was good but the meat was butchered to the likes of which I've never seen and again, the slices were about the size of my pinky.

'Entree'
Sea Bass - for the price we were a bit surprised to only receive a piece about the size of one and one half golf balls, we were told it was large enough to share; it was good.

'Rolls'
This is more of where the major disappointment came in. The rolls were very small and basically fell apart upon touching. I'm no sushi expert but I believe the rice is the portion of a roll that the chef takes the most pride in

Hamachi roll - fish was SUPER fresh but it again was butchered and appeared to be more of the left overs than a fresh cut of meat meant to be placed in a roll.

Shrimp tempura roll - there was very little 'tempura' to the roll and it felt as though the shrimp was split in half to fill an already tiny roll.

Gyoza - Not that it was bad but I mean its Gyoza and I've had better at Ramen shops. 

My wife had a lychee martini that was pretty damn good and they have plenty of beers/wines/sake on hand. Not listed is a warm sake which is decent and cheap at $18. 

I think the lesson to be learned here is that just because you charge more than market prices for your food that doesnt mean you're a high-end restaurant. There is a sushi joint 2 blocks from my house across the street from an auto parts store that could teach the chefs here a few lessons on preparation, the proportions are larger, the fish is of equal quality, and the prices are a little less. I'm not trying to harp on price here, I go to Vegas knowing Im paying more for everything.

We were never offered tea, no edamame which at least to me seems to be a default appetizer when you visit a sushi restaurant. No Ahi Poke on the menu but I didnt ask and they do have a Ahi tartare if I remember correctly, no chicken karage, and I dont even recall a side salad with the awesome miso dressing 99.9% of sushi restaurants offer.

Again, the food was NOT bad, the services was good, the ambiance was elegant but it felt more like a steakhouse trying to be a sushi spot. I would like to visit again and hopefully I'll be able to give another star. 

I would recommend checking it out for yourself if you're really craving sushi and have a couple hundred to blow. It's an experience and maybe they just had an off night. 

My personal opinion is that I'll try a couple more Sushi joints before returning here.",8w6KbpFl0Vp2xX122XHYpQ,2,0,3,5g7UJBUZC8hOv9Q2Z8SR1Q

All 3 salads came at different times and all 3 rolls came at different times. It's rude to start eating when a member of your party is still waiting for their food. You would think a restaurant inside a premium hotel, such as the Bellagio, would understand that.  The 3rd sushi roll came out 10 minutes after the first two. While we were waiting, we asked the waitress about the missing item and she became very defensive. Literally said ""I put in all 3 orders at the same time and you will get it when it is ready."" It was just a salmon roll. Not like it should have taken extra time to prepare it. We asked our busboy to look into it and he said he would. Then he never came to our table again. We got there right at 5:00 PM and were the 4th table seated; so they should not have been too busy when our order was placed. Food was just OK. I have had much better in San Diego.

They set up a private table on their small balcony (it could only fit a table for 2) overlooking the fountains.  It was dusk so the lighting was perfect.  The noise was minimal.  We had most of the nigiri on the menu - from hamachi (yellowtail) to toro (tuna belly) to uni (sea urchin).  It's so hard to find fresh uni and yellowtail had the best!  I swear I could taste the ocean, it was so fresh!  The waiter said they had just been flown in from japan (not sure if he this was true but I didn't care b/c it was delicious).  I could have eaten a dozen!  Overall the service was great - we had an informative and attentive server.  I would definitely go back for the sushi!",j-K60nzvdZR3QArdfc6fIg,1,1,5,VkryHj2dXCwITdvXcOebGg

We were seated in the back with a view of the fountains which was beautiful, and settled in with our menus. A waiter came by to bring water, and then the giant cluster that was this evening began. 

After that waiter came, we were completely forgotten about. I don't even understand how this is possible, as we had a waiter come by in the first place. A table next to us was seated five minutes later and ordered their drinks and meals while we continued to sit. Finally, after 15 minutes of sitting there we flagged down a bus boy who said we would get our waiter. Another 5 minutes go by and a waiter comes to the table and proceeds to tell us that he is going to get YET ANOTHER WAITER?

After waiting another 5 minutes we walked out. I don't understand how this is even possible. The restaurant wasn't full, there were waitstaff all around, yet we could not get anyone to take our order.

Would have given the two mainly because Vegas prices are outlandish and so is the price of EVERYTHING on this menu. I mean, REALLY, $19 for one basic a$$ roll is NOT cool. But it's Vegas. 

The fish itself was fresh and wonderful. I had the angry salmon roll which has incredibly basic ingredients. Can I just point out that I pay $5.95 for a salmon and avocado roll here in St. Louis? No complaints on the taste and ingredients of this roll. 

Also had the big eye tuna pizza. What a different take on tuna and pizza! It was really light, airy, crispy, and yummy. Only complaint again? Price. Ridiculous. I wish I could poop money because then I could give a crap about the pricing, haha, get it?

The ambiance of the place was perfect for our occasion, we were heading to Hyde Nightclub afterwards. The decor of the place is beautiful. 

The service was crap. We were a table of 8, yeah, larger tables are harder to serve, but there were maybe 3 to 4 other tables there. And at least 3 servers. So the incredibly lethargic speed of our server was uncalled for.

We ordered the yellowtail sashimi and the big eye tuna that everyone seemed to be raving about. Both were delicious, but they were $30 each. Normally I wouldn't think much of that. I'm a strong believer that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to raw fish, you want high quality. But I felt a little ripped off when I discovered that the same exact appetizers were served at other restaurants within the Bellagio for around $18. This experience alone would have caused me to rate this establishment at three stars. The reason I've opted for two was the service. I had to order several things numerous times since our waitress seemed to keep forgetting. When I ordered the big eye tuna, I also placed an order of standard salmon sashimi. After finishing the big eye tuna, I had to remind my waitress of the salmon sashimi. It took at additional 15 minutes to receive my sushi. No apologies, no discount. Nothing.

You are here because you have fat bankroll, a generous sponsor and/or you're very very beautiful.  Unlike some of the more hip upscale places, there weren't any goofy spikey haired mtv types, which is a good thing.

Although I normally evaluate the value of a place, it is difficult to do since I did not see the bill and probably if you are worried about getting your money's worth, you might as well just get a $14 cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere before grabbing a cab and having a giant feast on Spring Mountain for the same price as your cocktail.

We had spicy tuna rolls, flat iron kobe beef, beef tataki, seaweed salad, miso soup, halibut sashima (I think), potstickers, big eye tuna pizza (a surprising dish!), lobster bowl and some weird roll with pop rocks in them.  I made sure that I got full by adding a bowl of rice to my order.  Portions were generally tiny, though aside from the pop rocks, every dish was excellent.  Even the miso soup was done right.  Normally, I am a little bit more aware of the food, but I was a little buzzed and didn't have my inner yelp critic active.  Since they don't publish the menu nor do I have a receipt, I can't remember the exact dish names.

As a practical matter, if you are on a date here, try your best not to get whiplash.  The ladies are out in force here.  If you are here with the guys, then get a table in the waiting area instead of the inner restaurant.  It's the best view in the house.

They had highly disorganized team. We wanted a few minutes to look over the menu and the server never came back to us. Instead another server came and took our order. We only ordered 3 items since we only had about 2 hrs before meeting up with friends.

After our order was taken, the previous server came back and asked if we ordered. We told her we did and waited another 15 minute before we were served with Braised Kobe beef short ribs. 

Honestly, it tasted like something my dad could make for 1/3 of the cost. Wasn't impressed, but the next item that came did taste amazing. The Seared Diver Sea Scallops tasted Amazing! It was cooked perfectly and practically melted in your mouth.

Here is where I have trouble understanding your service. I had to wait 30 minutes for the Big Eye Tuna Pizza. A cold dish. There was 3 servers that came over and asked me if I wanted to order more. Did it look like I was happy sitting there with no food on the table? I asked one server to check on it and she never came back. The second one actually checked on it and told me it's almost ready. The third one obviously wasn't told that people were working on it already. 

It then took another 10 minutes to get the check. Is it because we came in late around 9:30? Is everyone rushing to get off work, so we end up getting a few minutes per server?

When my wife and I went to Vegas for our anniversary, Yellowtail at Bellagio very nearly ruined it. For background: My mother is Japanese, and I've been fortunate enough to visit many times. I don't need my Japanese food to be authentic, but it does have to taste good.

Yellowtail's food is neither authentic nor good. The glazed salmon I ordered was soaked in a sugar sauce, sweet to the point of being inedible. (My theory: To cover up the fact they serve cheap salmon.)

To their credit, when my waiter came over, he immediately asked me what was wrong. When I told him, he quickly replaced the dish with something edible but completely forgettable. (The good service is the only thing that brings Yellowtail up to two stars.) My wife had a similar experience. The food is more ""Japanese-y"" than Japanese.

Unfortunately for me, I had a severe stomach ache for the rest of the night - a distraction to say the least when I was trying to enjoy Cirque du Solei. The Bellagio hotel staff were completely unhelpful to the point of belligerence, but that's a story for another time.

I had the hamachi jalapeño, which is one of my favorites. Their sashimi meat wasn't as thick as others, but the jalapeño (obviously) was spicy enough. I might've enjoyed better with a side of sushi rice, but since I wasn't hungry, I had it just as is. I also had a few other of their amazing meals. 1 was their popular ahi tuna pizza. I may not have been a big fan, but my dining mate loved the dish. 

My favorite was popping spicy crab roll. There was a surprise hint of Pop Rocks, which I did not expect. It was very refreshing but also a good surprise to the dish. I'm surprised this place only has 3.5 stars! Beware, it is pricey, but if you're at Bellagio, what else do you expect? If you walk in knowing that it's not going to be a cheap bite, you'll have much of a better experience. I had a great time. Plus, free Shogun Shot with Yelp check in!

It's definitely elegantly designed and does its job in attracting the hip/beautiful crowd but I can't say it's any different than the other Nobu ripoffs you see in town.  We got the traditional sashimi dishes, the yellowtail serrano and the hirame usuzukuri, and thought both were ok.  They didn't have as extensive of a sushi selection as I anticapted which really surprised me, considering being in the Bellagio, and to make matters worse, they were out of two of my favorites uni and mirugai.  Not having abalone on the menu is excusable but really disappointed me as well.  I tried the strawberry roll out of curiousity and was surprised that flavor combo of fruit and spicy tuna tasted actually alright together (props to being bold).  The two pluses for the night were the miso soup of all things (which really tasted more like a fish stock soup) and our sommelier Yukiko.  Yukiko was super friendly and after politely asking what type of sake we liked, she paired us with a real nice Daiginjo from the Murai Family.  I highly recommend this bottle. It's good to see that they have the sake segment of their restaurant in the right hands.  I read another reviewers remarks about the wine list being bad but I've always thought wine with sushi was weird anyways...just stick with sake and beer.

Making reservations is a must and pricing is in the Nobu neighborhood.  If you can, try to get a seat outside on their patio which allows you to watch the water show.  Although the hostess are definitely attractive, you're not missing much in terms of decor on the inside.",-uBmDm-WLzhue5KQUiol9g,3,2,3,IA99jRF84vPojKOajyRAaw

The interior setting is modern and very posh.  I am a huge fan of sushi and sake.  I'm not a knowledgeable snob; I just know what I like.

* The Fishy Food:
The presentation is modern and minimalistic.
The Big Eye Tuna Pizza is tasty, but will leave your breath fishy.
The sushi was horribly forgetful!  Major letdown.  I had the spicy tuna & some other roll (I forgot).  The ingredients were fresh & tasty, but I've seen conveyor belt sushi with more charm and heartiness.
The sake was insanely priced.... however there is a huge selection of high grade sake!
Yes, the price was ridiculous for everything ($5 beer = boo) but that's just how it is on the main strip in the big hotels.

* The Service:
It took about 10 minutes before the staff prepared an empty lounge table.
The waitress was charming, but she wasn't attentive at all.
The service had a lot of room for improvement.

* The Setting:
I really dig the style of Yellowtail.
The outside lounge tables look over the casino floor, where you can be seen as the coolest dork under the Yellowtail sign (or I can at least).
The interior is dimly lit, there are some Asian inspired artworks along the walls, and the lounge music sets a nice background.

If I were to return to the Bellagio, I would keep Yellowtail as an option for an expensive drink and a quick bite in a very cool lounge.  Don't go for more than a bite, or you might just end up unsatisfied and cursing the bill.",WFioCidbh2iO7Qvf2jKb2A,0,0,3,jDjorihTvPEVE479kka7Xg

Unfortunately, Yellowtail fell quite short of my high expectations...

ATMOSPHERE
Located in the Bellagio, Yellowtail definitely has some swag (I mean, that giant, bright, metallic, golden fish hanging out on the wall definitely screams ""Vegas""). It was a pretty swanky place so I had some high hopes.

The server was really nice, but she accidentally gave us someone else's bill on top of ours... 

FOOD
1) Tempura fried king crab appetizer
2) Red snapper sushi
3) Shrimp tempura roll
4) Salmon sashimi
5) Angry salmon roll
6) Toro scallion roll

The TEMPURA FRIED KING CRAB was fantastic. I wish we just ordered a few of those instead of the sushi and sashimi. The crab itself was juicy and the tempura was perfectly crisp and crunchy. The dish tasted so good with the ponzu sauce! The scallions were a great finishing touch because they added that final subtle zing to the dish.

The SUSHI and SASHIMI were both mediocre at best. The rolls were small and they weren't that creative. The only good thing about the sashimi was that it was presented in the shape of a rose, but it wasn't the best sashimi I've ever had.

Overall, Yellowtail is overrated and overpriced. I feel like I had better sushi at Ichiban in the basement of Bally's for 1/10th of the price.",D-anvESbGXSH60T4AalPEg,0,0,3,jhCgGI0eNHop8MVHCuRO0Q

When I say the place was hip, I mean it might be a little too hip. The team of waiters (young, cool, and attractive) were always passing by and were perhaps a bit too present if you know what I mean. Certainly nice, certainly attentive, but also often interrupting us to ask us what we needed. This might just be a function of the place being new (and I admit that it's certainly better than being ignored!) but it was noticeable.

Some of the food we had was incredible: the Kobe beef carpaccio and the lobster carpaccio get five stars. The sushi, on the other hand, while good, was nothing to write home about. I felt like it was about the same as the good sushi I can get here at home, and it didn't compare to the sushi I had at Shibuya in MGM Grand.

Not impressed!  I guess I'm not a fan of fancy sushi.

Here is a list of what I ordered:

Spicy miso $8 
Baked crab $10 
California $17
Kobe beef flat iron $42 

Miso was good I like the little kick it had from being spicy, the baked crab was good but not great the crispy onions they put in it were overwhelming all I tasted was onions, the California roll was good but how can you mess that up and the Kobe beef was ok. Overall the food was good but nothing special. 

What I really enjoyed was the atmosphere really dark and romantic and the view was amazing since its inside the Bellagio you had a close view of the water show which was nice.

I see in a lot of people's reviews their complaining about the prices all I have to say to that is I agree the food is not worth the cost but its worth the experience. The atmosphere, view and service was well worth the  $400 something dollar bill. 
Also the food presentation was very nice as well I didn't take any pics because that is very tacky to do at a place like this. 

So overall it was a good experience, but I think I'll stick to my small hole in the wall sushi joints.",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,6,2,3,ULJsRjDYN1y5fIp5lFCe2w

Pretty busy for a Monday night to be honest. Sat at the bar where I had three fairly attentive bartenders. They didn't steer me in the wrong direction. Had the Tuna Pizza which I was told was a MUST. It was way better than I expected. Very flavorful and the truffle oil was a nice compliment. This paired nicely with my vodka rocks and I was off to the races.

Next up the protein roll and mile high roll. Both were fresh, presentation rocked, and really good! All this cost about $90.  So it's not the cheapest sushi place but def not the most expensive. Very impressed, will be back!",Il7zz6w1NVA87xwIEXZ3Yw,1,1,4,8BeiQzIN4MmxcNAJ8zw9uA

We sat at the bar and our first server aka bartender was so inattentive that the other bartender just stole us from him without even trying. He kind of looked like a mentally challenged version of a celebrity that I can't remember ... I think it was Rupert Everett. If you come across that guy, or a guy that remotely resembles him, or in fact, if you are ever served by someone who looks mentally challenged, well, maybe you can expect the same time of service.

The place is elegant for dinner, dimly lit, and loud with the sounds of other table guests. Our reservations were for 9pm, but was seated around 9:30pm, so just be cautious about time if you are on a schedule.

This is what we ate:
1. Big Eye Tuna Pizza $26 - thin crust on the bottom and tuna on the top, good to share, and definitely should try if you never had it before.
2. Grilled Eggplant Skewers $12 - sweet miso sauce with sesames, soft mushy eggplants. I would pass on it to try other things.
3. Popping Spicy Crab Roll $16 - House recommendation, actual pop rocks within the roll, very interesting, a must try!

We also ordered a bottle of sake, there are lots of selections. You can also grab a beer or glass of wine.

""Hamachi: the Japanese name for Pacific yellowtail, especially when used in sushi and sashimi."" - Google

I first heard of Chef Song Ook ""Akira"" Back when Chef Back was on Iron Chef & he battled Chef Bobby Flay. I was secretly rooting for my fellow Korean (after all I am half Korean). Sadly, Chef Back lost, but he gained an instant fan!!

I think the Iron Chef battle was sometime in 2008 because I ended up at Yellowtail in the Bellagio for their grand opening in 2008.

I have been to Yellowtail at least 10 times since their grand opening, & I have to say, it's still a nice place to relax & unwind!!

I enjoy the vibe & being able to have a lighter meal & cocktails in the evening.

---

Ahhh yes, that glorious meaty fatty melt-in-your-mouth fish that is known the world over as HAMACHI!!!

Yes please!

Ironically, my favorites at Yellowtail aren't made with Hamachi...

Yellowtail is a an upscale sushi bar & lounge where Chef ""Akira"" Back hones his love of Japanese food with a twist.

I have tried many of the items on the menu so I'll review 1 item I would pass on & 2 I usually order when I'm here:

Big Eye Tuna Pizza. (3 stars).

Chef Back's most popular dish is his signature Big Eye Tuna Pizza.

While the Tuna is sliced deli thin & delicious, I feel the truffle oil overpowers this dish.

I do love truffles & I do love truffle oil, but I find myself smelling truffles HOURS after I have eaten this pizza.

That tells me, there is too much truffle oil for my liking.

The micro shiso greens do give a nice crunchy texture but much like the tuna, they are overpowered by the truffle oil.

The ""crust"" is a thin crispy shell which does add a crunchy & enjoyable texture but this is one of those dishes that u will either love or despise.

U won't really know until u try it.

If u get this pizza to share, one slice is more than enough to taste the flavors & move on to another dish.

The BF said the truffle oil is too potent for him so I was forced to dump 3/4 of my pizza. Boo!!

Tuna Tataki. (4 stars).

Every time I visit Yellowtail, I always order this. I think it's because it's so simple but luxurious in quality & taste.

Plus, I get to see each individual slice & inspect its quality while admiring its beauty...

I am from Hawaii where Ahi is KING!

But I have to say this tuna tataki is light, subtle, & silky in texture. A nice firm fish that melts on contact with my tongue. Surprisingly great quality tuna for a restaurant in the middle of the dessert!!

While Chef Back's sushi rolls are fun to try, I come here to enjoy a semi-naked fish basking in all its glory... in a pool of spicy mustard sauce.

Delicious to the last bite!

I order this when I have wicked bad cravings for ahi & I'm not in Hawaii.

This tuna tataki has got me ""hook, line, & sinker"".

Duck Prosciutto. (4.5 stars).

Perhaps I love this dish because I rarely find it on any menu?!

Of the few places I have had duck prosciutto, Yellowtail is my favorite place to have it!

The fatty salty curing that these duck breasts go through make them all the more delectable. 

Yellowtail's version isn't gamey at all. Just a deli-thin slice of duck which is so delicious with an ice cold beer!!

The saltiness is addicting & the micro beets give the duck a lightly floral flavor while adding a nice crunchiness.

I love rolling the greens into each individual slice of duck and eating it like a roll.

This dish is really what entices me back to Yellowtail after all these years. Maybe not the best in the world, but the best I have had thus far!

Ahhh... the perfect quack... oops I meant bite!

Service is always friendly.

If u have a small party, I highly recommend sitting at the bar!! The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable & friendly. The cocktails at Yellowtail are innovative & delicious.

I'm an ""old-fashioned"" kinda girl... *Angelic smile*

3758542,2011-01-10,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I'd have to thank Food Network for this visit to Yellowtail.  If it wasn't for Beau MacMillan's convincing testimonial of their Alaskan King Crab Tempura from Best Things I Ever Ate, I probably would never have considered coming here.  It looked so good on the show, I had to make the effort to try it out.

I came by on a Sunday night without a reservation so the pretty hostess asked if I want to sit at table inside the lounge or outside on their front patio.  So no view of the Fountains of Bellagio which wasn't such a bad thing.  I chose to dine at the front patio as it was a nice way to people watch while I would wait for my food.  As a side note, the hostess and all the waitresses here are really HAUTE!!  Never had Crab Tempura before, but after having it at Yellowtail, I'm gonna look for it at any Japanese Restaurant.

The Alaskan King Crab Tempura was amazing!!!  Not only was it delicious, it was very photogenic as well (http://bit.ly/2wg2LWg).  The Crab was tasty and the Ponzu sauce totally enhanced the flavor of the Tempura.  For me, it was a foodgasm with each bite.  At $23, it is quite a splurge considering it's from their Small Hot Plate menu, but they give you plenty of pieces and a side order of Rice went great with it.  Plus, it's not very often that you would find Crab Tempura on a menu at your conventional Japanese Restaurant.  So consider it a different experience when you're ordering it.

My waitress was great and very friendly, and as I mentioned earlier, very HAUTE!!  One minor hiccup about my service was that the person who served me my food forgot to include the Ponzu sauce which was a very important ingredient.  It took a while for my waitress to get the sauce for me which cooled down my food a little bit.  But once she brought me the sauce, the awesomeness of the Tempura totally made up for it.

4.5 stars rounding up!  Yellowtail has definitely earned a spot as one of my To-Go Vegas dining spots.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,4,1,5,MRVj9O4pXOjtEK7JgI0plw

My wife tried the Kumamoto Oysters and while they were a bit on the small side, she said they were very good.  She also ordered the Baked Crab Hand Roll and said it was fantastic.

The Japanese Yellowtail Roll Sushi was average and I would not order that again.  I have had better at Hole-In-The-Wall places for half the price.

They did have a solid wine list by the glass and my wife tried one of their signature drinks as well.  It's a bit on the pricier side.  Our bill with drinks and tip was roughly $200.

A quick trip to the men's room and the subject of dinner will be decided. When I got back it was unanimously decided (without my vote) - YELLOWTAIL JAPANESE RESTAURANT & LOUNGE.

The fact is, this is really good Japanese cuisine. The best ingredients, great preparation, beautifully done and very delicious.

Everyone including myself enjoyed the hell out of it, and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting this cuisine.

Was it very expensive - a resounding YES! It's not a hole-in-the-wall place with hole-in-the-wall prices. It's a ""Real Deal"" place with ""Real Deal"" prices.

One thing: the wine list was an absolute embarrassment.  We saw a bottle of Yellowtail (the name of the restaurant but also the crappy Australian wine you can buy at our corner Ghetto Mart for $7) for $48!  Using that as our baseline, and knowing next to nothing about wine, we ordered a bottle of $70 wine thinking it would be at least decent, and it wasn't.

They sat us at a round table that we all appreciated. However you weren't able to focus on the atmosphere because the hip-hop dance music was playing so loud it was difficult to even talk to the person next to you. (now don't get me wrong - we went clubbing after dinner and hip-hop dance is what were after that nite but with a 5 star level of service the music was really contradictory to the atmosphere). It was also very dark - almost so much so that it was hard to read the menu.

We were greated promptly and presented with the wine and saki menu. They have no warm saki so I chose a cold saki that they were out of. The sommelier was sent over to make other recommendations but it was just as though she was reading from the saki menu, not really making any suggestions or asking me what I had in mind. Therefore on my third try for a drink I opted for a cocktail, but other members of my party got sparkling saki that they enjoyed.

Our server was prompt and seemed very knowledgeable. He made great recommendations, many of which we tried. This is not your typical sushi roll restaurant! They had the best albacore tuna and yellowtail sashimi that I have ever eaten (and I have eaten sashimi all over the world). Other members of my party enjoyed the spicy tuna snapping roll - I recommend you try it! The cucumber salad was heavenly with a sesame dresssing. The espresso was wonderful at the end of meal with dessert!

Overall this experience was slightly pleasureable and never forgettable, the food was excellent in quality and flavor, average in presentation.

Other than the fact of us canceling the salmon dish everything went well definitely will go back here for the amazing fountain view and delicious sushi hopefully with better service.,0H50qxdwgVYNROTBA3OQLw,1,1,4,tODpX9YKVoMMQ_cAQPCJ5A

They open at pm each day.  This time, it actually happened.  Boy was I not disappointed.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  I ordered the yellowtail serrano.  I am not usually a fan of the pepper on top, but this was the best yellowtail I have ever had, and the serrano made it even better.  The fish literally melted on my tongue.  It had an amazing burst or fish and pepper as a great contrast.   We ordered eel sushi as well, and it was the same way.  My god; this was the best sushi I have ever had in my life.

Thank goodness it was my birthday dinner so I got my wish! We ended up at Yellowtail in the Bellaggio. The staff is completely friendly and fun and I love that more than anything. Friendly staff can make okay tasting food into a great food experience and you might not even realize it. The ambiance really seemed to match the whole cocktail dress look, I honestly felt like I was in an episode of the Hills, I don't know if it was the martinis or what, but I really felt like Heidi would walk by with Spencer or something. I loved how the windows looked right out to the Belaggio fountains. The sushi here is really amazing, taste was extremely well balanced, fresh and just left you wanting more and more. I loved the two different kinds of Edamame, the one with the sweet chili sauce on the pods was a hit at the table. I was a little disappointed by how simple the menu was, I like lots of specialty rolls with lots of ingredients in them as opposed to the more simple rolls but the simple rolls were to die for so I am not complaining at all. The entire table seemed to really be enjoying their experience the signature cocktails were well received as well as the food. The birthday dessert brought out was similar take on a chocolate lava cake with a liquor and mint infused foam on top. Perfect to share with a table. I would highly suggest taking a few moments out of your trip and give Yellowtail a try, great place for several occasions and you might see Brody or something!",TyowQ3RBaqPdXrcYePQTQQ,1,0,5,Ojy6PMtmkFadCPFoNDJecQ

We all shared the dishes that we got. We first started off with the tuna pizza (it's not what you think), it's thin sliced sashimi on a chip with some good truffle oil inside. After that we got a few rolls is sushi. The first one was a yellowtail sushi which was rather fresh and straightforward. We then got a roll that had tuna on the top and a spicy aioli that was really good. (And I don't like mayo) we then got the ribs and mashed potatoes. I didn't think either of those belonged as a sushi restaurant but they were both really good. Perhaps some of the best mashed potatoes I have had. The sauce is what did it for me for the ribs. (They didn't have a one in them and were cooked perfectly.) 

Lastly, we got the recommended deserts on the menu. One was the apple desert and the other Was the chocolate desert (I think it was first on the menu.) I was not impressed with either of them and would recommend that you try another place for desert.

I had a reservation for 5 PM to assure plenty of time to eat and relax before the 7 PM show.  I was taken to a two top at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.

I looked at the menu and my server came and asked about water/other beverages and I ordered my standard iced tea which was quickly brought to the table.  I looked over the menu some more and the server gave me some recommendations.  I decided to order one cold shared plate and one warm shared plate as the server (and some reviews) point out that the shared plates aren't that large.

I got the Big eye tuna pizza and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  These were two recommendations from the server and he pointed out that the tempura crab had been on the Best Thing I Ever Ate Food Network show.

The tuna pizza was very good.  It had a very, very thin crust with just enough substance to pick up the pieces and eat it truly like a pizza.  The flavors were great even the truffle oil because it was used sparingly.  The tempura crab was a bit of a disappointment.  It was OK but the tempura was a bit heavy and took away from the crab. I couldn't help but think it was a waste of good crab making it tempura style.  It wouldn't go on my list of best thing I ever ate.

For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate in a cup.  It consisted of Nutella, banana foam, and vanilla bean ice cream.  The Nutella is in the cup and there's a ring on top of the foam that breaks and dissolves into the foam and ice cream.  It was a great dessert.

Service was impeccable.  The view of the fountains is always good.  During dinner, there were three fountain shows.  Prices are Strip prices but I knew this going in so it doesn't affect my rating.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,8,3,bwsrThB5PfchEB1q8NPJHw

The lobster carpaccio was also a hit with my fiancee, a crustacean nut who gobbled it down happily.  The cilantro was used liberally, which didn't mind me but could be off-putting to those who think it can overpower dishes.

The only dish that I would not have ordered again was the eggplant skewers.  The eggplant itself was nice and meaty, with a good char, but the sweet miso sauce was just way too sticky and sweet for my taste - going with a less sweet, more spicy drizzle (and using less of the sauce) would've made a world of difference!

Miso Cod - basically it is butterfish. This as always a winner. It is served with a sake foam that actually does add something to the dish. It also comes with a pickled cauliflower to tasted like a red plum. 

Sushi - here is when things go all wrong. The sushi was cut thin and a small piece. Even tough the fish is fresh, you can't taste it because their is not enough of it. It reminded me of buffet sushi. I take that back. Buffet sushi in some ways is better than what we were served.

4055588,2010-01-29,2,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"So I went to Vegas this past weekend for my friend's birthday and we decided on Yellowtail for dinner. We wanted an elegant setting and a good range of choices. I was excited for dinner even before we got to Vegas! I knew it would be fairly expensive and portion size wouldn't be all that filling. But damn! 

My friend ordered the Scottish Salmon and asked the waiter approximately how large the fillets would be and he said ""two pieces of salmon equal to about 7oz."" and then he gave us a visual of the two fillets and motioned them being placed on the plate ""boom, boom"" he said for each piece of salmon. When her dish came out, we were looking at it in dismay. This did not look like a ""BOOM BOOM"" but more like a ""bing bing!"" Boy, was that microscopic. I tasted some. The texture of the salmon wasn't bad, not too dry. However, my taste buds don't fancy sour marinade so I didn't really enjoy it. But hey, ""one man's trash is another man's treasure.""

My other friend ordered the Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs. The texture and taste was quite succulent. The beef was tender and juicy. The only thing wrong was that it was the size of one of the salmon fillets. 

Another friend ordered the Big Eye Tuna Pizza and the Popping Spicy Crab Roll. The pizza was alright. Thinly sliced tuna on top of a thin cracker-like crust. That, too, had a sour taste. The Popping Spicy Crab Roll was ... fun. I wanted to try some so my friend ordered it. What was fun about it was that it consisted of Pop Rocks! When they first brought it out, you could hear the Pop Rocks crackling in the roll. I have a major sweet tooth, so I enjoyed the contrast of the pop rocks and the crab. 

I ordered the Angry Salmon Roll. It wasn't horrible, except that the roll had a diameter of maybe a quarter. Mediocre to me. It filled me up quite nicely and kept my bill under $20. Overall I thought Yellowtail was average for the classy prices they were charging for each dish.

It was the last entree, and one bite was so tender & moist, we couldn't resist our stuffed silly selves.  my stomach wanted to explode like a ticking time bomb, and wait... there's more.  a ginormous dessert platter, i nearly lost my ability to breathe.  luckily i savored more than i sweet, so after a few bites, i was able to.. slowly....put...down...the....spoon....... easy there.

The service is as friendly as you can find.  Our waiter was constantly checking on us and making recommendations.  

We started with the garden salad which was good but the dressing was a little saltier than I expected, I think I was just prepared for something sweeter based on the smell.

4099757,2011-03-15,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I don't consider myself a cheap person.  But I value quality and quantity equally.  So when I come to a restaurant that looks fancy, acts fancy and provides fancy food, I'm mentally prepared to dish out some good money.  But when that fancy food equates to the same type of food I can get elsewhere for half the price and double the portions, I get mad.  This is Yellowtail.

Yes, the tuna pizza was delicious and probably the highlight of the entire meal as far as taste and value goes.  The Kumamoto Oysters were delicious but they were overpriced.  Besides those dishes and ordering a soft shell crab roll, an angry salmon roll and a spicy tuna roll, four slender girls (we're not fatties that eat a ridiculous amount of food) left hungry.  We decided not to order any more food because at that point, we realized that no matter how much more food we ate, we wouldn't be full unless we ended up shelling $100 each.  So at a tab of  about $125 (all we had was water to drink), we decided to cut our losses and headed straight to the Bellagio snack bar.  Yes, the snack bar.  We were all still so hungry that we actually didn't feel satisfied with what we ate.

The service was good but I felt that the server was a bit pushy with ordering more things or trying to push us to order something from the bar.  But in hindsight, she probably knew that the things we ordered wouldn't fill us up.  

Definitely not worth going to, there are so many better places that you can get this kind of food without dipping into your gambling bankroll.  Save your money to use it on something worth wasting your money on...like Megabucks.

The only availability was at 9pm, which was fine since we were gambling and shopping.  We actually finished early and arrived at 8:30pm.  When we checked in, the hostess was able to seat us. Score!

Our server was super nice and knowledgeable.  He recommended dishes and answered every question we had about the dishes. He also took his time- so even though the restaurant was busy, he didn't rush us.

What we ordered:
- Big Eye Tuna Pizza - this is one that the server recommended and oh-mah-gawd.  It was SO good.  The whole dish was light but filling.  The truffle and shiso complemented the tuna and crispy rice thing on the bottom.  YUM.
- Salmon sushi - fresh and delicious.  I got several orders of this.  LOL
- Ikura - my favorite ikura is from SugarFISH so I always compare ikura to theirs.  This was pretty close.  =)
- Yellowtail Scallion Roll - I figured since I was at Yellowtail, I should order something with Yellowtail.  The roll was good- nothing special.

We just drank soda since we were buzzed playing at the tables. Total came out to $120 after tax and tip!  Not bad!

After our dinner, our server told us we should go out to the balcony to watch the Bellagio water show.  It was nice to see the show from a different point of view (usually it's from the street), but I felt weird standing in the corner amongst the other patrons enjoying their dinner.  LOL.

Yes, you could say it is overpriced and not so good and whatmore. Some of the items on the menu could just be considered mediocre, yet their signature dish were definitely worth calling them 'signature.'

My friend and I took all the recommendations of our kind server and had an overwhelming dinner. Their Big Eye Tuna was served first. It was to die for. I personally love truffle oil, and its scent and flavor all went well with the crispy tortilla and thinly sliced tuna. This is a must-try on their menu, and probably one of the best I had the night. Second, we got the Yellowtail jalapeno. There was nothing that really stood out or made it different to other japanese restaurants, so you could skip this. Then, we got the rock shrimp as a finale to our appetizers. This got us FULL. Their portion for rock shrimp which is simply popcorn shrimp marinaded in somewhat like a spicy mayo sauce was huge, but the overall taste got sick after few pieces. 

Yes we thought we were full but we still managed to move onto our entrees, the rolls! Our server asked us couple questions and brought us out the Popping spicy crab roll and Happa roll. The happa was a little spicy but it was delicious. THEIR POPPING SPICY CRAB ROLL WAS THE BEST. it was probably one of the best rolls in my whole entire life. You may think pop rocks in sushi roll is weird, but trust me and get this roll. It is worth every buck that you pay for it. 

The service was great as well. Just make sure that you have plenty of time if you were to dine here since they do take awhile to bring out your food.

My friend and I shared lobster carpaccio, the tuna pizza (!!!!!!!FABULOUS!!!), Japanese snapper (!!!!YUM!!!), octopus sashimi, duck prosciutto (shockingly AMAZING, and I hate duck!!), tuna tataki, some kind of crispy pork roll, and another sushi roll that had pop rocks mixed into the rice (sounds weird, but was AMAZING!!). Every single thing was exceptional, but the ones I marked with exclamation points were pretty much orgasmically good. We had some good desserts, too.

It didn't hurt that everything was washed down with a sake flight featuring 6 different types of sake...plus a shot of some cucumber vodka cocktail they feature that was incredible.

We got the rock shrimp, seafood ceviche, and braised kobe beef short ribs. The shrimp was a tempura-battered pieces of shrimp drizzled with aioli sauce. The seafood ceviche came with only five pieces of wonton chips to serve with the raw seafood mixture. To be frank, the portions are incredibly small, but I guess that's how fancy restaurants are. The flavor was good, but nothing extraordinary to me. I do have to admit that the short ribs were cooked amazingly well as the meat just slid off your chopsticks. Otherwise, nothing too special.

This time around, we still loved three out of four of those aspects.  The food was delicious. The rolls are on the smaller side but the fish is very fresh and the seasoning is perfect. We had a split opinion about the popping crab roll. I personally did not enjoy the ""popping"" part as it felt like my rolls had sand in it, but the rest of the group loved it. The ambiance is still amazing. From the outside, the restaurant looks like a typical strip mall sushi place. Inside, however, it is gorgeous and very romantic. Service, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. We ordered our food and I, specifically, asked that we get the dynamite shared plate as an appetizer. However, our server decided that he'd bring the dynamite last, as he didn't want us to fill up on the mayo. Had he brought it up with us, we may have agreed. But he made that decision himself.

If you've ever been to Nobu, the menu is very similar. The food was really good, and you're not supposed to go and order just one entree and be done. I definitely recommend the rock shrimp, kobe beef tataki, and the yellowtail serrano. The spicy tuna specialty roll was really disappointing, and I didn't really like it. Also, the edamame comes in two different ways: the regular plain way with sea salt and then with thai chili or something which was just okay. I was also not impressed with the dessert menu, so we didn't get any. I also got hot tea, which was $8..!! 

The ambience was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful, but a little smaller then I expected. It was rainy and windy that day, so the balcony was closed, but we got a seat right next to the window so we could see the Bellagio fountain show very easily. 

As for the service... I didn't really like our server. I felt like he was ignoring us and rushing to get away when we were trying to talk or ask for something.

4338282,2017-11-16,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I had made reservations for my wife and me as I read about the opportunity to have fine Asian fare overlooking the Bellagio fountain.  We were shown to an ideal little patio table overlooking the fountain.  The evening weather was perfect., and were both in high spirits.  What could go wrong?  How about all the food and all the drink....

We started the evening with one of their $20 cocktails.  I'll let you decide whether or not that would be considered ""overpriced"".  Mine was OK, but my wife's choice had vodka, spicy pepper, and strawberry puree.  It was so sour, we had to call over the waiter, and ask if it was supposed to be so.  He said no, that the sweetness of the strawberry puree was supposed to compliment the spicy pepper flavor.  He returned it to the bartender who then made a better tasting one.  Well, it was a minor slip-up on a $20 drink, but stuff happens, right?

We had ordered a chef's tasting menu paired with various sake tastings.  Before we could even take two sips of our pre-dinner cocktails, the food runners from the kitchen started dropping plates of food in front of us like it was a race to get us through our dinner.  We ignored the food while we enjoyed the cocktails looking over the fountain and Las Vegas Boulevard.  We asked our waiter to slow it down.  Ultimately, we begged him to just stop completely.  

The chef's tasting menu was supposed to be six courses and a dessert.  We made it through three of the courses before we told the waiter to just stop.  The chef was embarrassing himself. 
Each course was worse than the last.  The first course was kind of a sashimi pizza.  It consisted of four minuscule, paper-thin pieces of fish on a communion wafer with truffle oil drizzled on top.  The waiter said it was their signature dish.  My wife tasted it, and said the communion wafer was burnt.  By, Jove, she was right.  They apparently over-toasted them, and all you could taste was oil on a burnt cracker.  Oh, OK, the drink was bad, and the first course was disappointing, but we had a great view.  It would certainly get better, right?  Wrong.

The second course was three paper-thin pieces of fish with some melted chocolate sauce and a splooge of sriracha right from the plastic bottle.  It tasted as awful as that sounds.  There was no flavor of fresh fish.  None.  Chocolate and sriracha  Blech.

The waiter was growing tired of hearing our concerns, and just then, another food runner showed up with Course #3: again, three paper thin pieces of fish covered in mustard and salt. What little taste was exactly like one of those German pretzels with mustard on it.  It was at this point, we had to flag him down and demand they stop the service.  Each course contained tinier and thinner pieces of fish than the last (if that could be possible).  There was no celebration of fresh fish, but a naked attempt to serve the smallest portions possible slathered with overpowering sauces dreamed up in some hellhole kitchen about to be eviscerated by Gordon Ramsay.  

I have never, ever, in my life asked for the food to stop coming.  We felt horrible.  We had never had such a difficult restaurant experience.  My wife was nearly in tears.  The waiter said the manager removed all the food from our bill, and we were still served a bill north of $250 just for the drinks.  I tipped the waiter appropriately as he wasn't the chef, and I had to write off the experience as a very expensive seat to enjoy a couple drinks overlooking Bellagio's beautiful fountain.  The manager refused to visit our table.  

Now before you or the restaurant manager simply write us off as East Coast rustics who wouldn't know fresh fish if it was a piranha that bit us on the cheek, let me provide a little context.  I am retired military and work internationally.  My wife is also a highly accomplished professional who travels globally for her work.  We have had the world's best sushi/sashimi at the Tokyo fish market.  I have eaten fugu in Japan (the potentially deadly blowfish).  We have sampled the raw fish in cities like Hong Kong, Seoul, Beijing, Macau, Luoyang,  San Francisco, Hawaii, and dozens more places.  Sushi is supposed to be all about the delicate flavor of the fresh fish.  The ridiculously transparent slices of fish and the nasty sauces made this the single most disgusting sushi meal we have ever eaten.  

The.  Worst.

This was supposed to the the chef's tasting menu!  I would have preferred gas station sushi from a quicky-mart on a desert highway outside of Pahrump, NV.  The fish slicer at Yellowtail should be paraded in sackcloth and ashes down Las Vegas Boulevard on his way out of town for good.

I guess you could say we wouldn't recommend you waste your money here.",Rjd5bfZ6qc8118-Bamriig,7,0,1,bB9CYFkbr9elXZEXPFVYzg
4349267,2011-08-07,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"We came here for dinner on Wednesday night before our 10:00 ""O"" show at the Bellagio. We enjoyed several drinks at the bar where I was introduced to a really tasty - and strong - lychee drink.
After a couple rounds, we relocated to the dining area and started off with some San Francisco oysters (which, by the way, were so good we ended up with 4 orders....we have no shame) and sake. Our server, Roberto, did a spectacular job - I have never had such amazing service ever. He also made some excellent recommendations such as with the sake selection ""Wandering Poet"" - a fine balance between dry and sweet at a fair price.
Our entree was an usual order of spicy tuna roll, bluefin tuna sashimi style, and some whitefish. The ribs came highly recommended so we decided to give it a go as well. I'm not going to lie but I was pretty disappointed and felt like I just got ripped off for a mere handful of meat chunks. Like, seriously? 4 pieces of beef for ~$30?! Of course, this IS Vegas and the quality you get is definitely noticeable, no complaints there.
For dessert we moved to the balcony with a perfect timing - the water show! The view was awesome and we enjoyed the green tea mousse which came with a shot of coffee  on the side. Really superb combo.
Definitely give Yellowtail a try when you're in the area!

4361152,2012-10-16,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"We've eaten here many times and it doesn't disappoint.  Favs: Tuna Pizza (OMG), Rock Shrimp, popping crab roll, Edamame in the chili sauce, basically any special of the night.  The cocktail with cucumber was AWESOME!  

3 complaints: Sake menu is pretty unfamiliar for most people, and the very nice girl who helped us by making recommendations only pointed out extremely expensive bottles, like $250+... ummmm... no.  So we felt like douches because despite everything she suggested, we chose an $80 bottle because that's more reasonable for us... to us, it's sake.  It's not Opus One.  Some people might disagree, but I just wish her suggestions were a bit more varied. 

Secondly, the seating is too close together.  The tables where we were seated are all situated along a bench, and you sit THISCLOSE to strangers right next to you.  It makes for an uncomfortable dinner, because I didn't feel like I could talk to my husband freely without feeling like everyone was listening in to our conversation.

Lastly, when you order lots of small plates, I expect the server to stagger them so that you receive one or two, and then you get a break between.  This is the way our meals have always been at Yellowtail in the past.  This time, our table was suddenly loaded down with all 4 of our choices within maybe 10 minutes time (or likely less).  We felt very rushed and not relaxed at all.  That part sucked.

If the service had been a bit better and we hadn't been jammed in with strangers, this rating would be much higher.  The food itself and the atmosphere is amazing.",VbPb2-zOI4poJY8nahkFcw,2,0,3,0R_STj1qeU8GIm-vIGdjaA

My biggest complaint was the lack of attentiveness by servers shown towards our group. The restaurant was about 50% percent capacity but the service was very horrible. Our dishes took forever. It's sushi? how long can it really take? The food was not bad, but it was overshadowed by the horrible service. You would think 25 dollar sushi would come w/ immaculate service. Expensive doesn't equate to great service. 

My friend came to the rescue, and made the situation a little better. She spoke w/ management regarding our experience, and the manager admitted, they were hosting high rollers at another table and couldn't properly serve his other guest. He discounted the bill and bought us a round of drinks, but it still didn't make up for the experience. Two stars for the good food and the management for attempting to redeem themselves.

Followed with the Kobe beef tataki. By this point I told my server it had all gone down hill. The sauce was over powering and you could barely taste the beef.

After taking the Tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur, Getting lost inside New York, New York for 15 Minutes and walking all the way back from there to our Hotel (Planet Hollywood). I decided to come here for a Late Night Bite, located deep inside the Bellagio lies Yellowtail: a Japanese Restaurant that serves killer Food, with waitresses dressed in Miniskirts (but mainly this is about the Food). 
When I made the reservation I asked if I could have a Table overlooking the Bellagio fountains outside, but they said they were all taken (that was only negative thing about my Experience here, Other than that everything else was Spot-On) they were at least kind to put me close to the window (Close Enough). 
The reason why I wanted to come here was because of one Dish: Tempura Alaskan King Crab recommended by Beau MacMillan (1st Season Co-Host of the Food Network show: Worst Cooks in America and 1 of 15 Challengers to defeat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America) on The Best Thing I Ever Ate episode (With Chopsticks). 

It came out and it was like layered like a Cake and When I went to take a Bite it was Awesome (The rich juicy Crab meat, the Crunch of the Tempura, you get Heat from the Serrano Chilies, Mildness from the Red onions, Smokiness from the Micro Cilantro, Earthiness from the Beets, some Crispness from the Shredded Nori and you get sweetness from the Ponzu sauce that they pour over just when its about to be served).To take the world's biggest and most expensive Crustacean and turn it into this is just Mind Blowing.

The galbi roll was basically just rice and they charged $20something dollars for that junk.

4465406,2015-12-28,10,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"No, No, No, No...and No...You've been warned. 

Sadly, everything was wrong about this dinner. We made a reservation on Saturday morning for an evening dinner there. We like to do a ton of research and try new places, because well, it is Vegas and there's a jazillion restaurants to try. Frankly money doesn't matter to me (though it is nice to feel like you are getting what you pay for).  If the food, service, and ambience are great, then it is worth it.  I like to leave a place happy and satisfied.  But, on the other hand, if you drop ~$200 (for two mind you) to eat what amounts to nothing (and not remarkable either), then we've got issues. 

We arrived for our 6:30pm reservation and were greeted by the hostess(es), who all wear the same tiny black dress with extreme amounts of cleavage baring cut-aways. Being a dude, I don't mind this much, though I will be respectful to my lady and not ogle or point.  I mention this because my girlfriend was appalled by a couple of the girls, and as she ""pointed out"" an Asian hostess seemed to have gotten the wrong size dress because her assets were on display. Not sure how cold it was in there all day, but it was beyond a tit bit nipply for this lady.   My gf was put aback by this at an upscale place.  Strike one for low class wandering exposed boobage.

(As for the décor, location, and the restaurant. It is a dimly lit, very woody feeling, and warm (dark) hues of browns and low orange light. I liked the ambience and décor. This is the one earned star.) 

Next up we got seated. Sadly no fountain views were available though I had asked for it...not a big deal. Our server was all hopped up and excited, which can go either way...but she really, really, really was pushing the Big Eye Tuna Pizza appetizer...hard core...so we bit at it much to my dismay (I wanted the Toro) and it was a super thin cracker with way too much truffle aioli on it, and the thinnest slices of tuna ever fashioned. It was ""6 pieces"" but honestly I could have put back 3 or 4 orders of these things for the amount of food an ""appetizer"" should have been.  We were both not impressed.

We also ordered an Organic Field greens salad, a Rock Shrimp (warm plate), the Protein Roll, and the Toro Scallion roll. Also we ordered a two-person pot of hot green tea because it was effing cold in Vegas this past weekend (and even dusted some snow!??!). Quick reviews:

- The Big Eye Tuna Pizza was just a $29 waste...not even tasty (see above).
- The field greens salad was acceptable...and simple salads should not be the highlight of one's dinner experience.
- The Rock Shrimp were over fried, hard, and just smothered in chili oil. Our local sushi place in LA has a similar dish where the shrimps stay moist, meaty, and the fried batter is a doughy, spicy delight. Here it was like eating rocks. I am being serious...they were so overcooked, I couldn't tell that it was a shrimp dish. 
** Meanwhile our bubbly server is asking us every other minute what we want to order next, we got so frustrated with her constant up-selling, it detracted from ""trying"" to enjoy the food we ordered **
- The Protein roll was okay. I thought the flavors worked. But the portion and roll size were embarrassingly small. 7 disjointed pieces, not symmetrical in cut, super small in diameter...this would NOT have passed for an appetizer, let alone a $32 entrée roll.
- The Toro Scallion Roll was tasty, but again it was too small, and weak for the asking price. 
- Two person serving of green tea is $16. Wow.

I do not ever mind spending my hard-earned money in Las Vegas. I like gambling it away, I like eating it away at nice restaurants, and I enjoy the shows, the comics, and the art work...but I could have rolled up two hundred dollar bills, dipped them in McDonald's ketchup and eaten them, and probably come out more satisfied than Yellowtail. 

From hostesses with wandering nipples, to a giddy over-selling waitress, to tiny bites (ha ha small plates...not so much), to dishes that fall flat...save your money and go somewhere else...there's a dozen more sushi joints in town that will impress you.

It sits right over the water's of the bellagio fountain which happens to be my favorite thing to see on the strip. Other restaurants have seating next to windows, but I think this one (maybe also olives) are the only one that allow you outside to see it all. 

We called and made a reservation for a Tuesday night. While the restaurant really wasn't that busy, the patio is small so it's worth calling. 

The service as most yelp reviews have said, was ok. Weird buser who kept making loud dramatic comments about how much water I was drinking. The server was a calm individual who never listened to what we would answer to his questions. Example, so"" you guys are here visiting Las Vegas?"" ""No we're local, we're just celebrating our anniversary"" ""do you know what you would like to drink?"" 

The food:
1. The tuna pizza, pretty good. Bread to tuna was sad. But hey, it shows the chef knife skills to cut the fish that thin!
2. King crab tempera chopped and deep fried. Small portion but good flavor.
3. Salmon roll. Same as any roll at a sushi place. But they double the price.

4539818,2012-08-07,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I suppose when I saw the ""bigeye tuna pizza"" as being the best dish at this restaurant I should have figured it would be subpar sushi joint.  I have no idea why this place gets so many good reviews but I guess with Vegas being a big tourist area most people reviewing this place have no clue what good sushi tastes like...especially a reviewer that states there is no place better in California!!? I live in Southern Cal and some of the best sushi I've had has been in the LA area i.e. Sasabune, Mori etc. But I'll simplify to specifics:

Service:
Sucks...lots of staff running around serving people with way too much money and food takes forever.  

Sushi:
We tried the bigeye tuna pizza and I guess it was decent...nothing to call home about. As for the sushi...I never knew they could cut sushi so thin and charge so much money.  I don't mind spending money on sushi but throw me a bone and at least make it hearty!? I can't believe they call themselves a sushi joint. I guess Bellagio can get away with charging that much for people that don't want to leave the hotel. The rolls were tiny and mediocre tasting. Usually my wife and I are fighting for the last piece but at Yellowtail we were fine leaving the overpriced food.

Ambiance:
I kept reading about being sat by the fountains which is why I chose the place. But the first thing you see on the site ""patio seating is very limited and you are not guaranteed a spot"" Well figures...when we walked in it was packed and we got seated in the middle area which basically defeated the whole purpose of us eating there. It's basically a club that serves sushi.

Summary:
A white washed sushi joint for people with too much money.  Lesson learned...Vegas is not the place for sushi...should have listened to the other reviewers. I wish I would have spend my time and money at a restuarant like Joel Rubichon or Bouchons or even just the buffet.  Won't go back. I spent $190 for an appetizer 2 drinks, a couple rolls and a couple pieces of mediocre sushi.

I love proscuitto, but the duck prosciutto was a bit on the saltier side, but again, it is duck.  Oh another that was delicious was the kobe beef tataki, man that literally melted in my mouth. Oh My, my tummy just started growling for that.  LOL, I don't think I can finish this review without re-living the experience again.

For some sushi we tried the Popping Spicy Crab roll, a favorite that my brother enjoyed.  I devoured the Toro sushi, what was in the platter, went all in my tummy.  We had a platter that had a variety of fish.  If you are eating here, I don't have to go in details of what I ate, but you won't be disappointed.  Toro, for sure, that was a must for sushi. 

Okay seriously, I am not done.  We still had more food to be served.  Main courses brought on the Kobe Beef Flat Iron and Jidori Chicken.  They both were cooked to perfection, the yummy goodness that melted in your mouth had me saying MmmMm, so good, but so full, I can't even eat more of it :(.   

For dessert we finished off with a ginger flan and chocolate lava cake paired with lychee sorbet.  I mananged to get at least a bite out of both of them, and they were yes, like the rest of my review, YUM. 

I can't wait to return, I'm coming back with an empty stomach.  The whole staff was very pleasant.  BTW, the seating of this restaurant also overlooks the water fountain, oh you know, just icing on the cake at this place.

For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it....

yellowtail serrano- so sadly I can't remember, but instead of the yellowtail, we got a different type of yellowtail that was butterier than regular yellowtail. Can a sushi expert help me out here??? Anyway, it was sitting in a blood orange sauce with little serrano peppers and micro cilantro. The presentation was beautiful and the dressings were subtle, not cutting into the glorious stand-alone flavor of the fish itself.

foie gras torchon - two slices of foie gras with a nicely sized scallop, and an oyster. break it down! - I would have liked to see the foie gras seared, but that's ok, that's ok, it was still a decadent heap of fatty goodness that dissolved on my tongue bite after bite. The oyster was perfectly cooked, which is to say, nearly not cooked on the inside. It was fresh and delicious, but I could lose the weird crunchy balls that had been sprinkled no the top. Nearly ruined it for me. And lastly the japanese oyster sitting in the middle off the plate was to die for. Meaty, fresh and not fish. It didn't taste horrendously like the sea. It was covered in watery, salty juices. It was just a clean, fat, oyster.

Toro and scallion roll - there's not much to say. They make this everywhere because it's a classic and it works. The fish was good, the rice was good, it was a solid roll, But not if you're looking for something special.

Uni sushi- Since this is synonymous with awesome, there is nothing more I can say.

And the Bellagio is such a beautiful and romantic place. You really can't ask for more for a lovely, romantic, dining experience.",608u33flNeT1Ofts1kFLpg,2,2,4,Y6LrgsRl5e_5YlYYtdXJ0g

When we got there the line was 3 hours long. That was not going to cut it. So we looked through the restaurants in Bellagio and passed Yellowtail. It was a bit more than I wanted to spend but we were hungry and tired. 

We were sat immediately. I must say it is a beautiful restaurant. The rear of the restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountains so we could watch the fountain show from our seats. 

Now to the food...the kid got edamame and gyoza. The edamame came 2 ways: with sea salt and with thai sweet chili sauce. Edamame with sauce was very tasty. Then wife and I ordered 2 sushi rolls. The one that stands out had pop rocks in it. It was surprisingly good. For entree I ordered Kobe Flat Iron Steak and my wife had Scottish Salmon. Both delicious but portions were on the small side, typical of over-priced Las Vegas restaurant. The food is so expensive because they don't turn the tables so you have to make all you can get off of each table.

4741401,2009-01-07,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Formerly Shintaro at Bellagio, Yellowtail is the Bellagio's attempt to cater to the younger hip crowd. The decor and ambiance are nice. The bar setup is cool. A few more specific comments

- on a busy night they do not give beepers or have any way of tracking you when your table is ready. So keep a watchful eye or they could skip you!
- drinks at the bar are about $14 for cocktails (the kiwi one is tasty), to $12 for large Asahi. Reasonable for Vegas, but still on the high end.
- Sushi rolls are pretty tasty, but be forewarned that they are SMALL. They roll them tight with not much rice. Not too much inside either. So while you may think a roll for $9 isn't that bad, you only get a small portion. So you must end up ordering more than you thought just to not be hungry an hour later.
- Bill for my wife and I. We each ordered 2 rolls, plus some sashimi. 2 cocktails and one large beer, with tip came to $150. Luckily we charged it to our MGM room which has a 30% off promotion via Mastercard until January 31, 2009 - otherwise it was a complete rip.

Ambiance good
Service acceptable
Price excessive

Details: This came highly recommended by a Bellagio employee, who raved about the sushi rolls. I love me some sushi rolls. I eat them at least once a week from various Bay Area restaurants or even markets. I don't have super-high standards... I just want fresh, flavorful, well-crafted rolls that aren't chewy. Well, this place failed on all accounts. Add insult to injury with a hefty price tag (the roll I got was TRIPLE what everywhere else charges for a larger, better roll). Yikes, not happy! It was also supposed to be spicy. Umm, yeah it was after I put a pea-sized amount of their wasabi-like paste on it.

The wine list made no sense for a sushi/seafood restaurant, and again super overpriced.

Appetizers:
--  Seaweed salad: came with two types, one with an overwhelming oceanic taste and the other a salty and sweet clear green thin type found in most restaurants. I liked this one but the fresh seaweed was almost too powerful to handle. 
--  Cucumber salad: light and refreshing, they use some great white vinegar to enhance the flavor. Makes a great refresher in between complex dishes.
--  Miso soup: the best I have ever had.
--  Grilled Eggplant Skewers: one of my favorite dishes, this eggplant is cooked PERFECTLY, and has the best sauce I have ever tasted. It is like a caramelized miso reduction and if you like eggplant you need to try this. I think it was around $12 so for being the cheapest app on the menu it was by far the most memorable!
--  Big eye tuna pizza: We tried this one because it won ""best appetizer in LV"" (according to our waiter). It was good but not spectacular. I will say that you will definitely taste the truffle oil. Also, the salmon was fresh. Not worth 26 though.
-- Scottish Salmon Carpaccio - Another winner, fresh fresh fresh! The sauce (Yuzu Soy I think) was delicious

Entrees and rolls:
-- baked crab hand roll : SO GOOD. THIS IS SO GOOD. I MEAN GOOOOOOOOD. If you like your sushi with a little oomph and cream sauces then get this. for 10 bucks it is well worth it!
-- rock shrimp hand roll : I liked the flavors a lot, but the roll is a bit more of a dry one in comparison to the baked crab. **The paper that wraps these two rolls is unlike any other I have experienced, I would go back just to have this style hand roll again. 
-- california roll : tasty and standard, again aim for the more unique dishes here 
-- spicy tuna : not much more than tuna and rice. I liked that they were very spicy 
-- oysters - creamy and very good

Drinks: 
-- Lychee - This one was good but for $20 it wasn't great. There was a strange flavor to it that was not sweet, empty and unsatisfying. (It was too unusual to compare to something else though). I will give them points for strength, the cocktails most assuredly hit the spot. 
-- Essence - cranberry cucumber flavors, extremely refreshing and mild.

Overall go here for appetizers and drinks, do not waste your money on an entire meal. We spent around $500 for 4 people in total. 
I will give it 4 stars because for as much as we spent, I was expecting each dish amaze me in some way or another.",gU4HktZ_PUPXHFTdwGqAPA,1,0,4,XpR61t_Gmy5q2CaN_IH4BA

Finally, we washed it all down with our $4.50 glass of Coca Cola....(hey its Vegas...whats a $4.50 soda).

The food was ok but WAY overpriced for what it was.  We had miso soup, seaweed salad, oyster shooter, 2 sushi rolls, and 2 cocktails.  The miso soup was fine.  The seaweed salad was weird.  Instead of loose seaweed, they came in tightly rolled balls.  They didn't have as much flavor as I'd liked and the consistency was just strange.  I didn't really like it.  The sushi rolls were rather bland.  And small.  I had a ginger cocktail, which I really liked and my husband had a cucumber martini, which he didn't like.  But at $20 a cocktail, they were rather steep.  I think the bill came out to $175, not including tip.  To me this wasn't a $200 meal.  I've had much better sushi for a third of that price.

The good:
The rib eye - sous vide prepared, excellent but  pricey at $49
The view - the fountain show is spectacular

The not so good:
The service:  For the pricing of the food, the service is meh at best.  I expect better, this ain't a coffee shop, we shouldn't have to ask for  refills of soda or water.

The appitizers....not served at the same time - spread out over 10 minutes, and althogh the King Crab tempura was tasty, they drown it in sauce so if not eaten immediately, it becomes a soggy dough piece of crab.

The Kobe beef - BEWARE - they told us that they had Kobe beef as a special that night, in two, five or ten ounce portions.  They don't mention the prices and beware it's in the $35-40 range per ounce.  It's heavenly but way too expensive.

They have a Kobe-like flat iron steak for $42 on their everyday menu so it gives the impression the special Kobe will be prices in the same range - NOT.  

Lastly, check the bill carefully.  They will offer to room charge it, but be sure to take a look - in error on our bill was three orders of some lobster roll that no on ordered - plus the surprise of the outrageous Kobe - even the waitress and the manager did not know agree on the price per ounce ($35-$42).

That was a mistake. I wasn't expecting the quality of sushi found in Los Angeles, but Yellowtail didn't even measure up to my diminished expectations. 

With regard to the cooked food, I would describe Yellowtail as the stereotypical high-end restaurant in an upscale Las Vegas hotel. Filet mignon, king crab, lobster, and foie gras dishes with prices you'd expect to pay for those ingredients - but there is very little care taken to accentuate the qualities that make those ingredients special. 

Take the Tempura Alaskan King Crab for example. Chunks of overly battered crab that were cooked in oil that was too cold, so the oil was absorbed into the crab. Just not good. 

The foie gras preparation (foie gras served with a corn croquette) was a bad combination, and paled in comparison to the foie served at Michael Mina (either the foie tart or whole roasted foie). 

The Filet Mignon Toban was tasty. That was the one dish that I can recommend.

I had booked a reservation to celebrate an anniversary on their patio a week in advance.  On the taxi ride to the restaurant, I called to let them know that we were running a little bit late.  I was told that there was no reservation under my name, and when she looked up my OpenTable confirmation number, it showed that it was booked for the previous night (Friday), and that the restaurant was fully booked, especially for the coveted patio seating.  I was floored at myself for the mistake; we were so excited to try Yellowtail and experience their beautiful patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  I asked to just put my name down in case something opened up, and perhaps we would just dine at the bar.  We checked in, were told that it was a realistic wait of an hour and a half, and proceeded to order a few drinks and appetizers at the bar.  Maybe 20-30 minutes passed by, and the hostess that I spoke to over the phone approached me at the bar and said she was able to get me a table on the patio, saying she ""knew she had to do something for me"" after speaking to me on the phone.  I really appreciated the hospitality, especially since it clearly was my mistake on booking a table for the wrong night.

The patio table and view of the Bellagio water show were divine.  I have no words to describe the amazing ambiance, and truly can't compare it to any other view while dining.  If you dine here and the weather is nice, I would try to get a table out here.

The food was a bit mediocre for the pricing, though I feel like it was justified by the patio experience.  The only dish that really stuck out was my boyfriend's Surf & Turf ($115).  The sauce on the lobster was so delicious, and both the proteins were cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Hirame Ikejime ($30), which was just OK.  Hirame is one of my favorite fish eaten raw, but nothing wowed me.  I also ordered the Seared Foie Gras ($45), which was again, OK, and a very tiny portion for the price.  There was nothing special about our miso soups ($8 for a regular, and $9 for spicy).  The spicy version just tasted like they added few dashes of Tabasco.  All in all, the scenery made it all worth it (I know, I can't stop talking about it).

Service was great.  He didn't mention anything about it being our anniversary, but I was already highly appreciative of the fact that the hostess got us a table.

The food here is inventive with bold flavors.  Stay adventerious when ordering; you will be rewarded.

The majority of the dishes are made to be shared (although the portions are not too large that those dining alone will not have a decent selection).  

The tai (snapper) served sashimi style with EVOO and shiso is excellent.  The peppery edge of the oil enhances the sweetness of the fish.  The lobster carpaccio is amazing.  The sweetness of the lobster and the onion play off each other beautifully and offers the perfect textural contrast.  Finally, the kobe beef tataki is an absolute must try.  Roll up the paper thin slice around a sliver of garlic and spicy diakon pickle and pop it in your mouth.  It's amazing how the bold flavor of the garlic is washed away by the fat of the beef as it melt in your mouth.

For warm plates, top props to the ""Seafood Dynamite"".  Lightly broiled king crab and rock shrimp dressed in a spicy yet not cloying citrus aioli; delicious.

The nigiri sushi is all very high quality but boring when compared to the inventive speciality rolls.  The ""Popping Spicy Crab"" is a serious must try.  Crab, spicy aioli, cucumber, asparagus, and POP ROCKS!  Just try it.

Service is excellent.

The wine / sake list is very good with well chosen selections by the glass.  Prices are high (remember, you're at the Bellagio).

In a city that probably has some of the best chefs in the world yellowtail at bellagio is a stand out. I recently dined there Tuesday and already can't wait to go back. As a Las Vegas local it's tuff to get me down to the strip for dinner. I'm very glad me and two friends made the journey. The food is simply amazing. Started with the big eye tuna pizza. This is a must when you visit.  Roberto, our server recommended this a starter. Fresh tuna, truffle oil and micro shiso. It's life changing. After that we just let Roberto take the reins and order for us, he did not disappoint. Every dish was amazing. The service is top notch our server made the experience unforgettable. The entire staff made us feel welcome from the front door all the way to the check. At one point the general manager even stopped by to say hello and ensure the had everything we needed. In closing, I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.

5118950,2008-08-10,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I love sushi.  I love it raw and I love it alot!  My goal is to try every Japanese place in every hotel we stay at in Vegas.  Raw may give you the runs but raw will keep you lean.  Yellowtail at the Bellagio Hotel in Vegas is an excellent choice.  We started out with endamame (soybeans) which came out in 2 flavors:  with sea salt or wok fried with a sweet chili sauce.  The sea salt was good, but the sweet chili sauce was a little too oily for our tastes.  It's something a white person would eat and like, but for Asians don't do it! It was like something from Panda Express - the white man's chinese food.  Our next try was the spicy miso soup with crab. It was not too spicy, pretty good, but the crab made it a little fishy tasting.  Next we tried yellowtail sashimi and giant clams. Both were delicious and fresh tasting.  Yellowtail has fish flown in daily. Next we had the kobe beef skewers.  It tastes like real kobe beef.  Alot of times you go to places that sell Kobe beef and it just tastes like regular American angus. We finished off with mango sorbet and mochi balls.  The fried mochi balls are good if you like that doughy mochi taste.

Try the Omakase.  It's a six course fixed menu.  It will give you a little sample of everything.  Do not try the melon martini.  It was gross and creamy.  Creamy martinis are always disgusting.  Service gets an A+ here.  There are always about 5 people nearby just waiting to meet your needs.  Oh and this is not your traditional sushi place with the sweet Japanese girls.  The girls look like the ""me love you long time"" type in shorty slutty cleavagey dresses.  I think that big fake racks are required to work here since all of the girls had them. The tits here are better than they are Hooters. It's great for people watching!",BN_azmr7N43F_ofUgW0z-Q,1,1,5,ISGVKNF5GKnJQ_XrNAWOAg

We came here for a friend's dirty- thirty bday dinner with a group of 13. So getting the reservation or a large party was a little bit difficult especially on fight weekend. They accommodated us with a phone call about three days before.

Service - pretty decent. Very responsive with a large party but thats because tip is guaranteed. But they did fill our waters and had decent suggestions. Also they were very responsive and helpful.

Food - Each group of 4 people ordered their set of dishes. In my group we had a hardcore sushi person, two experienced sushi eaters and one non sushi eater. 

We ordered the tuna pizza, which was pretty good, the non sushi eater liked it. Along with tha we ordered 4 rolls, a unagi type roll, a soft shell crab roll, a tempura roll of some sort and a tuna roll. We also ordered a Wagyu beef dish that was probably the highlight of the meal. We also had a snapper dish which definitely one I would come back for. I am not much of a roll person, so I can't say they were that good nor that bad.

The non sushi eater was pretty good at taking down the rolls, so in that sense the fish was pretty decent. The tuna pizza is more of a novelty, sorry toro, or hamachi are number one on my sushi wants.

Decor - It was a very modern setting and the view we had was outstanding, it was a great view of the water show at the bellagio, it can get pretty noisy in here so don't look here for a romantic dinner unless you like raising your voice to the person across from you.

I'll admit it wasn't my first choice (Comme Ca was) but it proved to be good for a not too filling meal, which is what we aimed for.",McGxalb8WuuXrf1a6vTnWQ,0,0,3,nhlgFSKjPvWaNiubZLFiog

You cannot go to Yellowtail without having the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  While this is something that I wouldn't ordinarily order, after reading the reviews on yelp, we ordered one as a starter.  It was honestly one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth! ;) We followed it up with the tempura lobster (from The Best Thing I Ever Ate) and a couple sushi rolls including one with pop rocks.  In all, our dining experience was not just tasty, but elicited all of our senses and was truly a dining experience.  

The only down point was the service.  It was actually pretty horrible but the food made up for it enough for me not to deduct a star.  We figured the bad service was due to the A-list singer and D-list reality star sitting at the tables next to us, but we still would have liked a little more attention for our $300+ dinner!

With booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,1,CuzBiQPW_KaEQSmqIMsLow

Our drinks were amazing - I had the blood orange and my bf had the kiwi (this will make sense when you see the drink menu). 

One gripe - I hear they have super nice bathrooms, but when I went they were shut down and I was (sternly) directed out of the restaurant. The food was definitely tasty - if I were in Vegas again I would go back to try some other things on the menu ...which could push my stars up to 4 (stay tuned).",hqZIoYCI7TxkrQKOSrFDEQ,0,0,3,9ZtwstlxMfhzE2sGSBRTuA

While it might not be the ideal sushi place for a connoisseur it will definitely satisfy. I wasn't in the mood to be picky so I made a deal with the waiter to bring out plates based on my affinity for certain flavors, not to be confused with the Omakase I can't eat that much. Every dish was beautifully put together and delicious. One of my unexpected favorites was the tuna pizza (not sure if that's the actual name). The smokey flavor and slight crunch were perfectly paired, I only wish I wasn't sharing with someone. My only real gripe is that the sake selection is lacking.

-Just lovely

5477929,2016-04-21,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"The food was pretty good, but our service was so appalling I had to take off three stars.

We go to Yellowtail on a friend's recommendation. It's myself, 7 other students, and a professor in town for a convention. After a lot of deliberation our waiter suggests letting him order, saying it'll be a good way to try the menu as well as making the price reasonable for us. He asks for our preferences so he can understand our tastes, and two of the students say they like California rolls - which should indicate to him their tastes are pretty basic. 

We get one round. Four plates, all different, and share. It's kind of cool we think. Then another round comes out, two orders of two items. Then another. And another. Progressively going up the menu. 

After about our 5th round the waiter tells us everything he ordered is in and now we just need to wait for the rest to come out. After this, two orders of a $60 dish come out. Then more rolls. Then two orders of a $130 dish come out. At this point, everyone is full and wondering why this waiter has ordered us so much food. Food that some people can't even enjoy because it's too eclectic for their tastes. Another order comes out. Then another, four rolls that are barely touched because everyone is so full. 

We've barely touched that order before the next thing comes out. Luckily someone says ""No. We're done eating."" Afterwards our waiter comes over, leans into the ear of the girl who organized our dinner and somewhat snarkily says ""Just so you know... Well, nevermind."" And walks off. Then we get the bill.

Our bill is about $1300 and our waiter has guaranteed himself about a $200 tip because of the automatic gratuity placed on tables of 8 or more. 

Our server took advantage of us. He knew we were young students. He knew we were indecisive about our tastes. He knew that amount of food was way too much. And yet, he put in at least 11 courses of food, possibly more. 

Why wouldn't he place 3 courses, ask if we would like more of what we had or if he's matching our tastes, then continue? Why would he place THAT MANY orders at once?

The service here completely ruined my faith in Yellowtail. Between being shoved in the back and having to wait forever to get refills on drinks and our experience with a waiter who knew he ordered too much food that was too expensive for a group of 20-22 year olds and a professor, likely because of an automatic gratuity, I don't know if I can return. If your waiter is a tall man with glasses and closely cropped hair, do not let him order for your group.

If, despite reading how they treat their customers, you decide to est at Yellowtail anyway, give the tuna pizza a try. That and a few other dishes are slightly redeeming qualities of this restaurant, but I'll never forget the way their staff abused the trust of myself and my peers.",Kxvi2sh8cpv4o3t7b1AG3A,0,0,1,dVGCVK_dIV9HEu35IhVuqA

Check out my full review with helpful photos here:
http://asupr.us/ap-yellowtail

Yellowtail is quite the luxurious setting which is quite fitting considering the fact that it's within the grand Bellagio casino.  The decor was upscale, but trendy at the same time.  In addition to the extravagant decor inside Yellowtail, you're also spoiled with an absolutely breathtaking view of the famous Fountains of Bellagio.

First off, I acknowledge that eating at Yellowtail comes with a premium.  And I already expected the increase in price from eating in Boston compared to eating in Vegas.  With those two factors in mind, I still found the prices a little on the high side.  Normally I'd be fine with paying a premium for high quality sushi, but for the price in Vegas and the sushi I got... I felt like the price I was paying was more for the surroundings and the location.  I found the dishes to be on the smaller size, but it's all about quality, not quantity.  Still would have liked to get a little more bang for my buck. Here are some of the rolls I tried:

Big Eye Tuna Pizza - Micro Shiso, Truffle Oil
Simply put, this thing is amazing and unique.  It's a stark contrast from the soft delicious tuna and the crunchy pizza crust.  It just all worked, very clean flavors.

Kobe Beef Tataki - Spicy Daikon, Garlic, Maldon Sea Salt
The Kobe Beef is cut paper thin, but it's the combination with the crunch of the garlic and the sea salt that makes this dish a sure winner.  Melts in your mouth.

Tai Snapper - Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Shiso, Tosazu
The extra virgin olive oil makes this dish divine.  The slight peppery taste gives the snapper a nice little kick.  Excellent stuff.

Toro Scallion Roll - Blue Fin Tuna Belly, Green Onion
On the small side, but a classic combination.  Fish was nice and fresh, rice was perfect.  Nothing special, just very solid.

Popping Spicy Crab Roll - Cucumber, Asparagus, Pop Rocks
Amazing and unique roll.  Yes, the description does say Pop Rocks.  Most unique roll I may have ever had.",AvGKAzOeriemqmuGYWNuLQ,0,0,4,MYvx2TY3MrCsqzRn6S6qaA

We ate here before seeing O and waited for about 20 minutes for it to open. We didn't make reservations so I'm a bit confused about how that part works because they wouldn't let us sit inside, they sat us at the ""lounge"" area facing the casino (which was honestly a view in itself, best people watching of my life!) but it didn't deter us. We tried the seaweed salad, which had kale and for the first time in my life I didn't spit the kale out. The cocktails were too expensive for me to try ($20 PER DRINK!) but my husband got a blood orange Grey Goose drink off the cocktail menu that was okay but not worth the price.

Both times I recently went we sat right next to a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the food and service were both phenomenal.  

I've had the edamame, big eye tuna pizza, the Alaskan king crab tempura, the popping spicy crab aka pop rocks roll, and the filet mignon toban.  

The sweet chili that was added to the edamame made it very delicious.  The big eye tuna pizza is a dish that is an absolute must try.  It's difficult to describe the burst of flavor when you bite into it a piece, but it's excellent.  The crab tempura was fried to perfection and went really well with the sauces they served it with.  The spicy crab roll was unique because of the pop rocks they add to it.  The filet mignon melted in my mouth.  I also had a dessert that was made from nutella that was amazing.  I don't remember what it was called (dessert in a cup maybe?), but I would recommend it as well.  The overall quality of the food is good enough to justify the price you pay for it.

The portions were unbelievably small (we ordered 4 sushi rolls for 2 people and were definitely still hungry - I mean not even a tad bit full).  I figured that could somewhat be the case, but I seriously think these were the ""skinniest"" rolls (not sure how to describe it!) I've ever seen.  Not very thick at all.  Like mini rolls.  They tasted ok.

But, I will say - our table was near the patio, so we were able to walk out and take photos with the water show, so that a definitely a plus.  The restaurant is also nicely decorated and I like the huge gold fish tail on the wall outside of it.",UVm_NEroYABSXYZ_3sAhEg,1,1,2,awkml9yiaHZ349pBcxLkZA

          Chef Arika Back knows what he's doing here, a former professional snowboarder and worked under many great chefs (Morimoto, Nobu). Chef Arika Back brings much more to Yellowtail, offers classic Japanese cuisine, which features innovative dishes that utilize fresh ingredients. 

          We frequent here for snack with the casino host; this time we had a quick bites with Julie K., but the food here is always consistent and yummy. Service is quick and we love sitting at the bar, to try all the sake cocktails.

- Shikoku octopus with cucumber and jalapeno vinaigrette
- Hamachi Serrano
- Kobe beef sashimi in ponzu sauce
- Big eye tuna pizza, reminds me of Morimoto Waikiki
- Oyster shooters with citrus sake.

       If you are the type of Yelpers complain about the small portion, this is way out of your league, remember even a bowl of PHO is $15 here at a 5 diamonds resort and casino. You get what you pay for, this Yellowtail considers reasonable compare to other sushi spots on this strip!

5650424,2012-12-27,2,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"4.5 stars, rounded up-- mostly for the fact that their service has been the cream of the crop in Vegas every.single.time. Along with this, the restaurant is very hip and trendy yet maintains a beautiful and almost addicting ambiance. 

I've now visited Yellowtail on 4 separate occasions, all very impressive. As aforementioned, their service is truly top-notch; At times I felt that there were anywhere between 3-5 wait staff members assigned to our table; on one occasion, we had 7 different members visit our table. However, none of this was overbearing to the point where our party felt uncomfortable or ""too"" helped, if that makes sense. Perfect balance. Also, I'm a water snob, and my water glass was never less than half-full. Wheeee.

Some patrons have docked stars because Yellowtail is so expensive. Well, I can't blame them, as I almost docked a star because of its price tag. I try to reason that ""it's Vegas, and everything is overpriced, and blahblahblah *insert the voice of the teacher over the intercom in Charlie Brown / Peanuts.*"" Anything to assuage the bill's amount....riiiight? 

A few of our favorite items include: 

--Big Eye Tuna Pizza ($26): Quite the delectable item, but make sure that you don't mind truffle oil! The oil is strong but brings out some additional nice qualities of the tuna sashimi. All served on a crisp ""pizza"" crust, this appetizer is best split between 2-3 people. 

--Tempura Alaskan King Crab ($23): My mouth waters just thinking of this...nom nom nom. Tender pieces of fresh king crab with just the right amount of tempura battering. Served with some shaved serrano (think like bitter jalapenos) and a delicious sweet ponzu, we make sure to get this each time. A great starter for 2-4. 

--Cucumber Salad ($8): Probably their most basic menu item besides the miso soup, but the bountiful, thin shavings of cucumber mixed with the delicious sweet/vinegary liquid makes this something we always crave. 

--******Baked Crab (or Rock Shrimp) Hand Roll ($10): This is probably my family's favorite little dish at Yellowtail. My mom always cracks me up when she says that ""we need to order the little burrito things!"" May seem a bit funny, but these really do resemble mini burritos. We love both variations of the hand roll-- I personally prefer the crab-- and we once got carried away and didn't realize that our party of 8 had ordered 10 of them until the bill came out. Sorry we're not sorry..? I'm sure our waitress loved us that night. 

--Popping Spicy Crab ($17): If nothing else, this is worth a try. Very unique with the pop rocks embedded in the roll. 

--Shrimp Tempura ($14): Extremely basic, but tasty nonetheless.

TIP: Their specialty cocktails are good, but for $20, I'd rather stick that into a video poker machine, test my luck, and tip the cocktail waitress for 2-3 premium drinks. 

Overall: Yellowtail keeps us coming back with its impeccable service, unique ambiance, and fantastic flavors.",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,3,2,5,usZFA8AjDMRxsTnXXMtRSQ

First and foremost: the big eye tuna pizza with white truffle oil.  Just get it.  That's all I'm going to say.

Secondly, ask for the patio.  It lays directly over the Bellagio fountains and provides an amazing special occasion experience, especially for newcomers to impress.  Otherwise, the inside area has a more bustling, active ambiance.

In addition to the pizza and the patio, I'd also recommend ordering the miso glazed cod which is not on the menu for some reason.  Although it is not as good as the original (Nobu), it's definitely up there, albeit a too-small portion.

My only gripe would be the less-than-sweet (I'm being nice here) hostesses, which is why I'm only giving four stars.  Yea, less attitude would be appreciated.  The servers are awesome, however.

5724733,2015-08-11,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"My wife and I visited Yellowtail with friends of ours while in Vegas on vacation recently. We were all staying at the Bellagio, so this was a great place as far as convenience goes. I was able to place my reservation online using the mLife portal.

Let me start by saying Yellowtail is expensive. If you're looking to have dinner/drinks for a party of four, prepare to spend about $75-100 per person.

That being said, Yellowtail is also very delicious! We started by ordering some small plates (Gyoza, Edamame, Ceviche) which were shared. The Gyoza came out hot and crispy on the bottom, they were very full of flavor. The Ceviche is served with five fried wonton ""chips"" to use, and was very flavorful and had a strong citrus backing. The Edamame comes out served two ways, one small bowl with traditional steam and another tossed with a Chili Sauce. Trust me when I say this, get the Chili Sauce! It's FANTASTIC!

For our meal we ordered an assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi and nigiri. We had several special requests for preparation of these rolls and they were followed well. As other reviewers have said, the Crispy Kalbi is very special. Korean short ribs and slaw as a role? Sounds crazy, but it works!

So is Yellowtail overpriced? Yes, obviously ($14 for a 12oz can of Japanese Beer, for example). But show me one restaurant located in a casino that isn't. If you're willing to overlook the price, it's actually a really fantastic Sushi restaurant and fun dining experience.",uYEMjOZ37TMvy3YhCY-I1g,0,0,4,T5GRuhHpZkXGsKnF3bUk4A
5725570,2014-06-27,0,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"Yellowtail is by far one of my favorite restaurants on the strip. I agree that the price is definitely a lot higher than your average Japanese restaurant, but aside from paying for the incredible quality of fish, you're mostly paying for the real estate so it's a great place for a date! The ambiance is romantic and ideal for beginning your night out since they have a trendier atmosphere. They're in Bellagio Hotel which is centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip and sits by the lake overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Also, trust me when I say this... Yellowtail has some of the best servers in the hospitality industry.  Every time I come here, the service is impeccable; personable, knowledgeable and top-notch, worthy of Bellagio.

Roll Call - 

*Ahi Tuna Pizza - MY FAVORITE! Thinly sliced grade AAAAA ahi on a light, crisp tortilla with a magical onion and mayo blend, topped with micro greens and...TRUFFLE OIL!
I've personally had friends tell me they don't like tuna OR onions OR mayo and then I introduced them to the tuna pizza and BAM! Life-changing.

*Baked Crab Hand Roll - What is up with soy paper? I love anything wrapped in soy paper! And this isn't your typical grossly baked, oozing with burnt mayo roll. The crab itself is baked, I believe. This roll will make you MOL (Moan Out Loud). 

*Crispy Kalbi Roll - I don't know how this came to be but it definitely works! I love the texture of this roll - meaty, crunchy (from the slaw), and juicy! It also has complementing temperatures of hot and cold in your mouth!

*Grilled Walu - Of course it's amazing and buttery and just melts in your mouth. Just don't order too many or you may end up on the toilet the rest of the night since Walu is like a natural laxative. You're absolutely fine if you have a few bites and it's worth the small risk since it's fatty and delicious!

And then if you want a fun novelty roll, get the Popping Spicy Crab roll. I'm personally not big on it only because it's a pretty simple roll (crab, asparagus, cucumber) with pop rocks in it but I have to order it whenever I bring someone to Yellowtail for the first time and they always love it! 

My 5 O'Clocktail is the Lychee Martini! It pairs wonderfully with everything on the menu & you don't have to love lychee to enjoy this beverage!

Stay classy Las Vegas and thanks for stopping by!",PjKQInHMkNLT1cnCwCVl4g,1,1,5,puBJK7I4cHhGJIMMUPf_zw

5734598,2013-04-01,1,Dxaz8OxaadecnWol18kAtw,"I came to Yellowtail, trying to continue the legacy of great sushi meals I have had in Vegas. I managed to do so, but I will say that we ended up ordering more ""non-sushi"" items than we had intended here, and that was fine.

From their hot and cold plates menu, we ended up with four things. Our Bigeye Tuna pizza came recommended, and was quite good. The tasty thin sliced tuna was ""glued"" to flat bread with something - creamy, and neutral, maybe a creamy cheese? That particular ingredient wasn't listed on the menu. The whole thing was topped with drizzled truffle oil, which I frankly could have done without. The more I am exposed to truffle, the more I think the smell is offensive. It's too powerfully earthy, almost a rotting smell, to me at least, and while the taste is not as strong as the smell, it tends to overwhelm my nose, and thus my sense of taste. But this was still good, my anti-truffle campaign aside. The sliced octopus in jalapeno vinaigrette was...fine, but unremarkable. The octopus was tasty, but the vinaigrette needed some more punch. I didn't find much jalapeno in it.

From the hot side of the menu, our tempura king crab was awesome - light batter, flavorful tender crab meat, tossed in a sweet/hot sauce. So delicious, and probably the highlight of the prepared plates. The seafood dynamite was also good, served in a cast pan with corn and mushrooms. Kind of an interesting take, with plenty of chunked seafood. Also worth ordering.

For sushi, we ended up with their popping spicy crab roll - how can you resist a sushi roll with pop rocks? This is gimmicky, but also very good. I liked the crunch of the pop rocks (and the pop) along with the soft crab and crisp cucumber. Their spicy tuna roll was good - heavy on tuna, not just spicy mayo like I've had at some places. And the toro scallion roll had some of the best toro I've had to date. Super tender and flavorful. The scallions did not overpower like I thought they might.

I also had my standard seaweed salad, which here is a mix of fresh and pickled seaweed, for a nice change of pace. Really enjoyable.

Service was good, prices are...well, I'd say normal, but not absurd for Vegas. The restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountain, so if you get a good table, you've got a great view. Even from the middle of the room, we found ourselves stopping conversation to watch the thing go off. Cliched though it may be, it's still really cool, every time I see it.

Here's to another successful sushi meal in Vegas - 3 for 3. Of note, dress code here is ""casual"" for sure. One of us saw a man enter the bar wearing a bear costume (which included fake abs and a furry hat with bear ears) underneath a suit. So yeah.

The good: The pop rocks (yes, like the candy) sushi roll and the rock shrimp are fantastic. The high steaks roll is good too. 

The bad: The second-to-last time we went there, we made a reservation on Open Table. Their airheaded hostesses couldn't even be bothered pressing the button on the screen that said that we had shown up. We spent over $1,000 that night and yet got a nasty note from Open Table saying we were cut off from making reservations, because we had ""No Show""ed at Yellow Tail. Are you kidding me?? 

More bad: This last time, we got a call to confirm our reservation, with a warning saying, because they are so full tonight, all dinners are limited to two hours. Basically, we will kick you out. Are you kidding me? 

I've had enough of the attitude. There are plenty of great sushi restaurants in Vegas and we'll happily spend our money there.",v2HxTx0A8MkJ1oM1yJ4www,1,0,1,b14VbwaIUQMWAgBioS6VuQ

I'm not stingy when it comes to fancy dining, especially Vegas; I know you pay a lot for a little in places like this, but this place is ridiculous! The portions are so small, its hard to share something with even two people (and we had 10), so if everyone wanted to try something, we had to place 5 orders for it!!$ 
The waiter came by every now and then, and had to yell over the ambient noise; AND forgot either a drink or menu item more than a couple times.  
As for the food...eh. Although the fish/shellfish in the apps tasted extremely fresh, it seems as though everything was drenched in truffle oil to make it seem fancy [hire a new head chef]. The rolls were about the size of my index finger, so tasting the fish/ingredients over the rice they were rolled in was a task.
This isn't the only sushi restaurant in Vegas, I recommend trying one of the others before you step foot in here.

Yellowtail was not a contender for a 5 star but do no let that disuade you from hitting it up.  The food was VERY good and things like the edamame with sweet spicy chili sauce were new and very good to me.  I thought it interesting that they have a Nobu staple (popcorn shrimp in spicy sauce) on the menu.  I ordered 4 of these for the table and they were gone in 3 minutes (they should be eaten hot anyway).  I ordered more and they too were gone. 

We ordered some sushi rolls that were fantastic including the first lemon zest I have ever had in a Maki Sushi.  It was a special and tasted like a perfect summer happy hour roll.  So good...  Anyway the one guy that didn't like sushi was happy with his $50 Kobi beef.  Seaweed salad was fantastic and ample/fresh.  The Ahi nachos rocked too.  You will not be dissappointed here but bring money like at every non-buffet in Vegas.  Again, this place was built for the expense account.

Dinner at Yellowtail was a highlight of my latest Vegas business trip. We decided to eat whatever the Chef's preferred to make us, without even looking at the food menu, and we were not disappointed.

The tuna pizza - Awesome! Yellowtail Serano - Awesome! Tempura Alaskan King Crab - Awesome!  Seafood Dynamite - DYNAMITE! Baked Rock Shrimp Handroll - Awesome! Angry Salmon - AWESOME! Sushi  was fresh, the rolls were fun and mouthwatering. 

Everything was so tasty I wanted to order another, and then the next thing came up and took the ""Favorite"" spot.  Of course we drank - champagne, wine, coffee and finished dinner with the Lemincello (first for me), and thanks to the sommelier recommendations, everything was excellent.

The best part, and I didn't know this was an option, one of my dinner guests told the waiter he wanted to time dinner service with the Belagio fountain show - every 15 minutes.

Every 15 minutes we walked out of the restaurant to the balcony (it was a cold night so the patio wasn't open for dinner) and watched the fountain show, came back to the table with a new set of dishes, glasses re-filled, everything clean, napkins refolded or replaced.

The service from the waiters, sommelier, food runners, was excellent. We felt pampered without interruption, all night long.

Service in the beginning was spectacular, really nice bartenders, suggesting what is good on the menu.  I wanted everything on the menu but it was a bit pricey so had to be selective. 

Their edamame app is unique as it comes with two bowls of edamame one tradition with the salt, and one with a sweet chili sauce. Both were fantastic and just the right thing to have before the sushi.  Next up, Miso soup - delicious!! 

I had ordered sushi, along with my two other friends, and figured it would be up after the apps.  It was a long wait for the first round of sushi for my friends, and even longer for me :( They had forgotten about my order and somehow the sushi chefs never got it! The bartender (our server) was trying to figure out what happened.  He gave us a round of drinks on the house to apologize.  

Personally, I was not even that mad even with him apologizing so many times, and him saying this was not acceptable to their restaurant.  I was just happy to be in Vegas an having a good time.  Yeah, it did suck that my wait was really long. Never had to wait that long before in my life.  Hopefully in the future that does not happen with anyone else.

Holy cow, this is a fabulous dish.  It is listed under the ""Shared Plates"" part of the menu but I can guarantee that on my next visit, I am getting one of those suckers all to myself.  Maybe two.  It is that delicious.  My husband had tried it before and was raving about it ever since, so I tried to manage my expectations, but he wasn't exaggerating, it is that good.  I am not even going to bother describing it, because no description would do it justice.  It is just a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Period.  

I am quite serious about ordering two for myself next time.  One to start and one to finish my meal.  In between I will order the Uni Sushi again, and the addition of the quail egg, really put these 2 pieces of sea urchin sushi over the top.  The baked crab roll is also fabulous.  My husband and I shared it, and I may just have to get an order for myself next time because the crispy onions, spicy aioli, in the soy paper was fabulous.  I was literally ""mmmmm""-ing after every bite.  

We also ordered the Popping Spicy Crab just because it is such a unique dish that we had to try it at least once.  Not only was this meal a pleasure for the senses of taste, smell, and sight...it was quite an experience for the ears too.  When the dish was placed on our table, you could hear the pop rocks popping away.  It was actually quite tasty.  Who knew that the sweet and crunchy pop rocks would be a great compliment to the spicy crab? Chef Akira, obviously.  

My husband's favorite seafood is scallops and so we had to order the Seared Diver Sea Scallops, and it was seared perfectly and accompanied by a mustard potato puree.  It wasn't my favorite, but my husband loved it.  Fine with me, because that just meant more room for another order of uni.  From start to finish, I had a smile on my face.  With a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountain show and a tall glass of Asahi Black, I was in heaven.  

The service was impeccable.  I highly recommend that you ask to be seated in Roberto's section if you want amazing service.  I was quite pleasantly surprised with this meal.
