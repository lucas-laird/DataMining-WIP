435655,2017-10-07,1,e6m1p7oPbq7Gq37eMhSsWA,Best pizza in Vegas by far. No one can compare. Authentic NY pizza. Chicken rolls and calzones are top notch. Take my word for it. Born and raised in the best borough in NY (Brooklyn). Real Polly-o mozzarella and ricotta. We are addicted. I am eating a slice while posting this review.,57xaMQEs448cEc2RhHl9XA,0,0,5,px0arAXdPdbaF6dB-Xf1Mw

3251882,2017-10-07,0,e6m1p7oPbq7Gq37eMhSsWA,"Well we tried our new neighborhood pizza joint today. They could've earned 5 stars with better customer service.  

I ordered takeout via Yelp.  A large order. I was very detailed on my order so there would be no confusion.  I ended my order asking nicely for plates, cheese and pepper flakes please.  

We needed the food at the house before 7:30pm for the start of the playoff game.  I placed the order at 6:32pm.  The website said we would receive the food in 35 minutes.

After a large order of pizza, pasta, wings and dessert, I got a phone call from the restaurant.  They sold out of meatballs.  On a Friday night ... at 6:30pm.   I replaced it with Ravioli and Chicken Parm.  

It took forever on the phone call.  They asked my what flavors I wanted on the wings...even though I already ordered them with flavors indicated.  She said she had no idea.  She asked whether we wanted ranch or blue cheese... even though I already indicated what I wanted in the original order.  

Let's say NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE GETTING MY ORDER RIGHT.  

At this point it's 6:45pm.  I asked how long for the takeout to be ready. She says 45 minutes.  I say that's too late... can you deliver?  She says yes but it's a $4 delivery fee.  

Serious??  Their mistakes and errors are making the order late, and they can't waive the $4 deliver fee??

6:30pm rolls around, no delivery.  We literally live 3 minutes from the restaurant.  At 6:45pm, I call and they say that the food is on the way.  It arrives at 6:50pm.  One hour and twenty minutes after the original order.  

No plates as requested.  No cheese or pepper flakes.  

If I was the owner or manager, I'm including a cannolli or a cupcake or a couple sodas... or anything that says ""sorry, we're new to your neighborhood and we made a mistake, but we want a second chance for your business.""  

Food wasn't bad. We would've returned with better service. Like the reviews on their Henderson location, they are stingy on pizza toppings.  Tough to understand given that they charge $15-18 per pizza. 

We usually go to Rocco's which is good and has a bigger menu.  Or we takeout at Bambino's which is excellent.  Sadly we probably won't return to this location.  Poorly executed and even more poorly serviced.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,10,0,2,Zm8jKoUoQ18ny_6fEyysUw
