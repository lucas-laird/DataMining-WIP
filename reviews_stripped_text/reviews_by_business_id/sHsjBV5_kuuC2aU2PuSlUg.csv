I love burritos so I decided to try it out with him. At first it was overwhelming looking at the menu because of all the options and I didn't know half the things that were up there, but just like at Subway you get the option to pick what you want on your sushi burrito and it was easy to just point at the clear glass and tell them you want ""that"" on it. 
For me and him both, it equaled up to $20 which isn't too bad.
Even though I don't like sushi I really enjoyed it and my boyfriend loved it. If you don't like sushi, I still recommend you trying it out and if you're a big fan of sushi then you should definitely go here!

I live fairly close and, with the construction going on towards Sahara and Decatur, I opted to try it out. I was not disappointed AT ALL! The service was friendly and fast (a rarity in these times of lethargy, computers, and cell phones), the food was hot and very well prepared, and the portion sizes were quite large for the amount charged. I like places where I can get a good bang for my buck and this place is now at the top of that list.

It's kind of like a Subway (but 100x better and without the stigma of pedophilia). They have a pre-constructed menu that you can choose from and have your choice served either as a jaburrito, rice bowl, jachos, or salad (I think...I'm not a salad person). Also, if you like, you have the option to build your own. The sky is the limit!

I am very VERY pleased and I will try my best to add a photo at a later date. However, until then (which may be tomorrow), I can only give you the following vivid description:

Deliciously sticky/fluffy white sushi rice topped with a heaping portion of grilled chicken and slathered in queso de gallo and mango teriyaki sauce accompanied with savory sweet roasted corn, fresh red onion, crispy tortilla strips, juicy jalapeños, fresh cilantro, and shredded romaine lettuce. #YUM!!!!!!

I got the Rockport with soy paper but subbed shrimp tempura for soft shell crab and subbed salmon for spicy tuna. It was really delicious! My only complaint was the sauces was only on one-side of the burrito so the parts without the sauces were kind of bland. I may also try it with seaweed instead of soy paper next time. Also I wish they have unagi as one of the choices, please add it to your menu! 

The setup is like Chipotle, however, the line was moving kind of slow when I went.

This place looks very clean and nice on the inside, minimalistic decor and decent amount of tables for you to eat. I ordered the Redondo sushi-burrito from the menu and wasn't impress at all on the first bite. It tastes very bland, and the house soy sauce wasn't good at all with it. The sauce was extremely salty and thick, which doesn't compliment the roll very well. 

The price is a little pricey and the serving wasn't fulfilling enough to justify the price.

My friend, she's the one who hear about this place, and I park the car, then approach the building. Not the greatest location of town, but it's around enough restaurants and stores that you don't feel on edge. As we walked in we noticed there was a no eating area outside, something they may want to look into considering the very limited amount of dining in area. Otherwise the restaurant smelled clean, lighting was energy saving, and the staff seemed nice enough. I studied the menu. There are pre-selected types of sushi burritos available (which all sounded amaze balls) or you can build you own, Chipotle style. You can also make it a combo with the salad, chips or mochi. They even allow you to choose between a soy or regular seaweed paper. What blew me away was their option of Taro chips. At the end they have more a variety of choices versus the normal dining area. For example Kern's juice and Aloe Verde was in the fridge. The cashier definitely needed more training.  The sauce bar at then end needs a bigger cup for the stayers.

Well now I'm spoiled because I have JaBurritos less than ten minutes from my house!

Super vegan or veggie friendly. I get the Gardein steak, spicy vegan mayo, nori paper, sushi rice, and alllllllllll the veggies!

I love all the flavors combined. At first I was like ""grilled corn and steak flavor in my sushiritto, hell no."" But I tried it and it's sooooo yummy! I am a huge seaweed salad lover so I usually unwrap and add some seaweed salad. And of course while I'm unwrapped I add ginger and wasabi! I like it spicy!

I have also tried a bite of a vegan Mex style, the Gardein steak, grilled corn, lettuce, pico, spicy vegan mayo, avocado, tomatoes, soy paper wrap, brown rice. It was also good! My husband usually gets something like that because he is NOT a fan of anything sushi smelling, no nori or wasabi for him! 

I have gotten my combo bowl style also but there is just something yummy and comfort food with that burrito style. Maybe because all the extra tortilla calories?!?! Oh well, just eat it.

     Brought some co-workers here and they all loved it. Brought my girlfriend, she's got a jaburrito problem now.  lol
     I have tried with the seaweed paper, soy paper and flour tortilla. I think they are all good in their own way. (The seaweed tends to get a bit messy near the end), 
Best thing about Jaburrito is that I always feel pleasantly satisfied without and heavy lunch feeling after.  Light and fresh.

    They definitely need a bigger seating area and more locations around Vegas.   Hope they expand!

Sushi burrito, pick the burritos you want or create your own. Both times here I picked the ones they have on the menu, Rockport my first time in and Long Beach my second time. The Rockport had all the ingredients I love, but the taste was lacking, it had barely any flavor. I got the combo (who does not love taro chips???). Hmmm tell me why is there huge chunks of salt and furikake on the bottom of the tray but it does not stick to the chips, making it completely pointless to have that on there. Now the turn off for me was the canned nacho cheese side for the dip. Taro chips were totally covered in nacho cheese sauce overpowering it and took away all of the are chip flavor. Nacho cheese and regular chips, but not with taro chips it does not work. In addition I saw a girl get taro chips to go and her portion looked 3x my size in a paper bag. Mine had about 8 chips filling up only 1/3 of the tray it was served in. Maybe pick another tray or fill up the chips into the entire tray so it does not look like much of it is missing. I tried putting salsa on top as the owner suggested and I am sorry, but none of the salsas tasted good with the burrito. I really don't get it at all. I tried every salsa there (which they all seem canned salsa. One I swear is Pace Picante salsa for sure.) Not a good match with sushi. I felt the portion was pretty small when my total with the combo was close to $15. 

Second time there, opted for just the Long Beach and no combo since I was not impressed with the taro chips experience. Again, no taste on the burrito.

1893079,2015-10-25,9,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, with mexican influences. I dig it! Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.

Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.

The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.
The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.
The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.
TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. 

Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. They're still in their soft-opening phase and busy as hell. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling.

I ordered the Redondo because it had yellowtail, and also go the drink and seaweed salad combo. The burrito was good, and the salad was seasoned perfectly.

I considered getting another burrito, but at that point I thought to myself for the price of two burritos, seaweed salad, and a drink I could have went to an all-you-can-eat sushi joint and left stuffed.

I may have gotten a little too hyped for this place, which means my expectations were a little bit higher than usual... The staff was friendly, but I had to wait 25-30 minutes until I could finally order. I kept in mind that there were new hires who were working the assembly line, so it was understandable.

Redondo - 3/5 // $12.95
The first thought that came into my mind as they were making my sushi burrito was ""that's all the rice they put on it? Really?"" I thought there'd be at least a little bit more rice to make up for the lightness of the fish and toppings. The quality of the fish was pretty good considering the fact that we don't live by the coast. All the other toppings felt like they were a little bit skimped on and there was supposed to be Chipotle Mayo sauce, but I barely tasted any in mine. Overall, there was't really much flavor to it and it didn't really fill me up, which was a little disappointing (and I have a small stomach tbh). My friend told me that I could have gotten sauces on the side, which is what I should've done! Next time, next time...

Other than the food, the atmosphere is refreshing with its white, open space. I got my order to-go, so I didn't really get to bask in the restaurant. When coming here, keep in mind that there may be a line... because there will probably be a few first timers who will take forever choosing which toppings to put on their sushi burrito.

Jaburritos occupies a small space across from Palace Station, next to David's Bridal. They definitely need more room, but they probably had no idea this place was going to BLOW UP like it did. When I met my new friend Rachel F. there for dinner, it was packed. There were at least 15 people in line to order, and by the time we left there were another 20 waiting. What sucks is there are only about 6-8 small square tables inside to eat at, and they were all occupied. People were saving seats and pushing tables together to accommodate larger parties. Since there aren't very many tables to begin with, this left us with nowhere to sit so we had to go to the McDonalds across the parking lot, a little lameeee if you ask me. 

So how it works is you make your own bowl or burrito, or you can choose one of their signature selections. I wanted to try a couple different sushirittos, so I chose the Long Beach and Mission, both on soy paper, and sans lettuce because who wants to eat lettuce with sushi?? I enjoyed both, but the Mission was my favorite. I also got to try Rachel's burrito, the Redondo, and it was missing flavor. Apparently they missed a couple items that belonged in hers. I know they are still super new, I am sure with time they will be able to make all the items without having to look at a ""cheat sheet."" I did like that they do not skimp on the fish or the toppings. If you don't like fish, fear not! They have chicken and steak too!

The irony is just recently on my visit to Sacramento saw my first glimpse into the whole concept burrito but sushi style. I became fan the first time but here at Jaburritos they truly take it to another level. It all the little details that really stand out. 

The quality of the fish is top notch with my favorite AYCE spots in town. The tuna and soft shell crab. I would say tuna definitely sashimi quality and soft shell as fresh as can be. It was tough with all the choices then to make matters worst is you can literally build your own burrito. On my first trip I wanted to try something off the menu and the Rockport is one of the more popular rolls. After inhaling both halves in record time can understand the popularity. The crispy fried soft shell crab combine with spicy tuna have perfect blend of crispy texture and one raw. Then you add the vegetables inside gives it even more body and textures going on. Bringing it all together with the Chipotle mayo and Sweet Anguila sauce. LOT LOT going on but all together LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Portion size there no skimpy portion here you get nice size amount of protein and really just looking at the burrito total WoW that burrito my friend. The rice in the burrito totally legit sushi rice! They also have salsa bar that can get even more creative with ideas. First time so never grabbed any but can assure you will the next visit. The way the line is set up makes for not only great entertainment. You get to see them make your burrito to order or if want create one watch your own masterpiece come together. The open kitchen you can really see the freshness in ALL the ingredients, every single item would want in my burrito, and cutting board area very clean. The place is insane busy right now being Hot and New business. I was impressed with the system they have three or four workers handing down the burritos and pumping them out. Still every single one is consistent the size, portion, and think that speaks volumes most part the whole menu burritos. 

Diversity is awesome. The taro chips with furikake. I grew with furikake in the 808. I think its the best thing on rice ever hands down. I would never think put some of it on fresh deep fried taro chips. Da Bomb! Those things are so addicting like everything else at Jaburritos make sure take my time enjoy the food. Lol! If looking for chips munch on these taro chips are delicious! The juices were looking good but saving those for another visit. Not just juices they have assortment of bottle beverages and fountain machine.

The staff is awesome! Talk about high energy, positive, friendly, and making the whole process watching them or creating your own burrito. Fun!

This fusion concept has made it's way from the Bay Area down to SoCal, across the desert to Vegas! 

The hardest decision: do you want a burrito, bowl (think poke-style/rice bowl) or nachos (aka Jachos)? I was on my way to McCarren so I went with a burrito as the most logical vessel for a grab-and-go situation.

You are able to either pick one of Jaburritos' own creations (named after different seaside locations) or customize your own sushi burrito.  Burritos come wrapped up in either traditional nori (seaweed), flour tortilla, or for carb conscious folks there's soy paper!

I opted for a custom burrito. Why? Because I've got old lady eyes and I could simply not be bothered with squinting to read the menu board and messing up my RBF in the process, plus you can't beat ordering your food Chipotle-style.

Need help? The friendly staff can help come up with a tasty concoction without judging you for adding all those extra proteins, extra toppings, extra sauces, etc. because beach club season is over now.

But let's be real here.... I wouldn't really call this a burrito, it's more of an oversized temaki-style sushi. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and Jaburritos will be one of the options for food when I'm back in the area and need a quick bite to eat. The sushi burritos were pretty filling (I only added one extra protein serving this time) and the ingredients were all fresh, backed by a reasonable price.  We spent about $25.50 before tip for 2 burritos, 2 drinks and a side order of taro chips with cheese.

Pro-tip: opt for the taro chips as your side, or base for the Jachos vs boring tortilla chips.",Qk9ogz2-6sN7ojEkwDG6Xw,7,3,4,kXRYXIijvZEcYBjR0DDfyQ

Are they huge sushi rolls or somewhat small burritos?...yes, they're Jaburritos!!! What you're getting at Jaburritos is fresh, clean food you can customize to your liking. Chef John realized the good thing going on in other places like San Francisco and teamed up a sustainably minded partner to bring Vegas their first glimpse of sushi burritos...think over-stuffed sushi rolls, or hand rolls.

Jaburritos is an easy win for me. Price, quality, and flavor. For about the same price as a lot of sushi rolls in town you can purchase a sushi burrito...not Philadelphia and California roll prices, but a comparable value for anyone that regularly orders sushi rolls....and JSB's are larger. You won't find some of the high-end cuts of fish that Soho and other sushi places have, but then again you wouldn't want to ""waste"" those cuts in a roll or a sushi burrito. What you will find is fresh, good quality fish and meat to make your sushi burrito enjoyable. One of the secrets to a great sushi burrito is the sauce. JSB might even do this better than some other sushi burrito spots. As with most sushi rolls, the sauce is where the flavor is. JSB has a lot of great Japanese sauces, salsas, salsa fusion sauces and even some Asian sauces that aren't necessarily Japanese in nature. Ex: Yuzu Guacamole?...Yes please! I would recommend Jaburritos to friends based on these reasons alone. Throw in the customization of your sushi burrito and the fact that JSB is immensely sustainable in their efforts and I find myself with a business I can really get behind!

On your first visit feel free to jump right in to the create-your-own game if you have some ideas to explore before you arrive, however most would do well to check out one of their pre-determined concepts such as:

Redondo - ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayo

Long Beach - spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce

Mission - salmon, sushi ebi shrimp, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole, tomatillo shiso sauce

This is my first time ever trying this wildly popular sushi burrito craze and to my surprise, it was great! I had my reservations about eating a giant sushi roll; I feared that the rice would be packed in like a brick, lack flavor, quality fish and enjoyable textures that I've come to love in sushi rolls. Good news, it wasn't a depressing/ soggy rice bomb! I've compared the looks of these to their competitors and I can definitely see the quality ingredients, inventive menu and the presentation offered here. The prep-line carefully added fillings to the burritos like a science! Everything was proportionate and well balanced.

You have the option to select from their signature Jaburritos menu, which offers a good variety to appeal even to a picky eater! If you feel the courage, you can even create your own, just like you would at Chipotle/ Subway/ Pieology (you get the idea.) They also offer Jabowls which are poke bowls topped with their unique ingredients and they even have Jachos, which are house made taro chips seasoned with angel dust, I would assume, and a side of melted queso. I really loved the taro chips, they were delicately crispy and addictive! I enjoyed dipping the taro chips in their house salsas - really tasty pair! The queso wasn't really anything to write home about; some people refer it to canned cheese, but I thought the combination was interesting.

The complimentary salsa bar offered a few chunky house made salsas: Mild, Verde, and Roja - none of them being spicy. The flavor of the salsas weren't too pronounced, which is great since it didn't overpower the Jaburrito; the chunky texture and acid added depth to the Jaburrito. I would have to say Verde & Roja enhanced my meal the most! Ginger, wasabi & their house soy sauce (similar to a thick black soy sauce) is also available and these condiments paired well will the Jaburrito.

Here's what I tried: 

* Rockport $10.95 - Soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce. This one was my favorite! Think a burrito sized crunchy roll! The combination of texture and flavor really shined through. I even asked them to add a little bit more sauce and they obliged, making this an explosion of flavor! Rated: 5/5

* Redondo $12.25 - Ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayo. This was good, they were generous with the fish and the unexpected crunch from the tortilla chips added a wonderful surprise. Unfortunately, the wasabi mayo was weak on this one, I would probably ask them to add some sweet anguilla sauce or maybe another sauce to wake it up next time! Overall a good Jaburrito option offering fresh fish. Rated: 4/5

This place is a real hit with the younger crowd & locals; as the word spreads like wildfire, it's only going to get more packed - that line is unrelenting! Also, there isn't much dining room space, so finding seating may prove to be tricky. Crowds aside, I love what they are offering here and I can appreciate the sushi burrito trend. I really hope the proportions remain consistent as they continue to gain popularity; it would be a shame to see them cut corners and lose quality.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,80,75,4,uaQouLhLEbciL2E6x4qhYg

They're still located in the exact same location, same employees and management team. They claim they are still using the same ingredients and such but I can't comment on that since I haven't tried it for myself. Expect a new review on their SOHO SushiBurrito Yelp review page shortly.





No more waiting for the Foodie Fest to be here so I can get my Jokasaki fix. We now have JABURRITOS here in town!

In a nutshell, it's sushi in burrito form. Please take a moment and take a look at the many pics already posted here. It taste just as good as it looks...if not better.

Our first time here, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We wanted to try everything to our hearts content. You can choose between soy or seaweed paper for your burritos.

I ordered the Rosarito $5.25: spicy tuna, cucumbers, cabbage, tortilla chips, rice and their diablo sauce. Whooo!!!!! Just a word of caution: I LOVEEEEEE anything spicy but that diablo sauce made my lips burn. Yes, it was more of the spicier foods I've eaten in a while.....but it felt sooooo good! ;)

Boyfriend ordered the Rockport $10.95: soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumbers, rice, tempura and chipotle mayo. He LOVED IT!!! This seemed like the more popular burrito because while waiting in line, two separate people in front of us AND one in the back of us ordered this.

Then as if that wasn't enough for us, we also ordered the Long Beach: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce $10.95. We split that one. This was just as delcious but we rather stick with our first choice.

Only downside is the seating arrangements. Very few chairs and tables. If you come during peak hours, hope you can find a seat. No doubt this place is going to do really well so they need to sort this out somehow...someway.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,7,4,5,iCYg_8quJeqVZZJjE2iV-w

I spoke to the Soho owner, John, who now manages this restaurant and he was nice enough to tell me about his ideas for this food establishment and suggest some food for me to order.

I'd rate Jaburrito more like 4.5 stars but here's why: It's a brand spanking new  and the workers are still learning the ropes.  After minor things like reminding an employee to put the forgotten cream cheese in my Mission Jaburrito and a somewhat lackluster Jachos (nachos) with two tiny pieces of shrimp tempura, the Jaburrito flavor and quality of their food and sushi save the day.

I first had the Mission-  Salmon, Ebi Shrimp, Cream Cheese, Yuzu Guac and all the assorted veggies on Soy Paper.  It was clean, fresh, and delicious.  Adding jalapenos and all the side condiments like the salsa and the house soy sauce made it even better. 

My wife decided to try some Jachos and our protein of choice was tempura shrimp.  I would not select this protein again simply because it came with only two little shrimp tempura and a ton of chips.  The queso sauce was delicious and the staff also gave us a few dipping sauces:  Mango Teriyaki sauce, Eel Sauce, and some pico de gallo.   My suggestion is use bigger shrimp tempura.  I can't imagine only two of these would fill a custom burrito order without being disappointing to the customer.  

I was quite pleased though with my Mission that I decided to go back into the Chipotle-style line for more.  John suggested I try the steak burrito on a wheat tortilla.  I customized it by adding queso cheese, rommaine lettuce, onions, cucumbers and seaweed salad.  I topped it off with John's suggested sauces:  Soy Chipotle and Chipotle mayo.    This baby was exploding with flavor and crunch.  Absolutely in love with this and what I would highly recommend.  

There's great potential and I surely hope this place not only succeeds but also opens more locations so that I can go here every week!   If you're a fan of sushi, this new take on it will surely delight your tastebuds!",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,6,4,5,riaXcC3yc-BEdXZUUyFzpQ

The place was small, but the crowd was big. We saw at least 20 people come and go during the 30 minutes we were there. Ordering the food felt a lot like Chipotle in a slightly more disorganized fashion. 

Because of how busy it was, it felt difficult to truly customize your order without holding up the line. It was my fault, because I should have taken initiative, but I do think it would have been nice to be asked.  I got the Baja burrito, it was great, but I personally needed more sauce. My husband got the Redando and he felt the same way. Anyways, next time we will speak up.

It's the concept of burrito mixed with Japanese ingredients... And omg it's so good!! 

They have some popular burritos already built with certain ingredients, or you could choose to build your own. Since it's my first time here, I decided to get one of the popular ones.  My boyfriend and I had the Redondo and Rockport.  You can pick your wrapping with seaweed, soy paper, wheat tortilla or flour tortilla.  We both got seaweed since that was the most popular. 

Redondo was really good with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, Masago, jalapeño, Onion, tortilla strips.  They were so good together, the sashimi were so fresh! 

The Rockport had spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab, jalapeño, onion. 

Both were just super yummy, and we got a side of home made taro chips.  It comes with cheese for dipping, but it totally hides the flavour, it tastes the best with nothing because it is seasoned.  

They definitely need to get one of these restaurants in Toronto!!! We went during lunch, and it was pretty busy, like a subway, with 4 people dressing the burritos, and one cashier! Can't wait to come back to Vegas and try another jaburrito!!!",4hetE9pQKPXesVF4KB2c8A,1,1,5,VtiM6ovQd8b2wmfBEvTmPg

Jaburritos isn't a new idea; it's just new to Vegas. There are a few locations on the Western side of the U.S. that serve this style of enormous sushi roll. Yes, this is sushi and not a burrito, but ""Jaburritos"" sounds better than, ""Large Sized Sushi Roll Eatery"", moving on... 

The ordering style is the ""create your own"" model, but they also have pre-made options to choose from for the creatively drained. This was me when I walked in, and after a brief explanation of the menu I ended up going with the Long Beach Roll; spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, Anguilla sauce and a side order of Taro chips and nacho cheese. 

This crazy ass meal was actually very good and very filling. All the ingredients were extremely fresh, fried additions weren't overly fried, the veggies were crunchy and weirdly enough the house made salsas fit-in perfectly with the other flavors. I did have a problem with the nacho cheese on my Taro chips; it definitely came from a can. 

Jaburritos can be a bit pricey depending what you order, but no more than any other decent lunch place in Vegas. I would definitely come back and see what else I can jamburrito into my face.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,17,13,4,CMpd4-PZoA_2j7NkOUPH2w

3022382,2015-11-12,0,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"I found this place in the local paper and for some reason, a sushi burrito just sounded like something I needed to try.  I decided to give it a shot and let me just say, it was AMAZING. First off, I honestly didn't think the burritos would get me full.  I really thought I was probably still going to be hungry afterward because, c'mon, I can kill some sushi on any given day (as long as it's good!) and these burritos didn't look like your average burrito.  So I ordered the Redondo burrito (since I Yelped it before I got there) and got some of those chips with a side of cheese.  When I sat down to eat, I was in heaven. I paid for two burrito combos and it was only about $25 plus tip. To me, that's not bad at all considering how fresh the seafood was and how generous they were with it.  I hate when places cover up their seafood with a bunch of veggies or stuff like that so you can't tell how much seafood is actually in your meal. Nope. Not this place. I got what I paid for and I was extremely satisfied. 

My ONLY complaint about this place was the seating.  I don't live close enough to this place to be able to take it ""To Go"" so when it was getting close to time to pay, I was a bit nervous that I would have to sit in my car to eat.  I understand how it works, but it was kind of annoying that there were people saving seats for people who were at the end of a long ass line. I'm sure by the time THOSE people ate, people like me would have already been done with my food. Lucky for me, I had placed my order to go but right before I walked out, someone had just got done eating and left.  I sat down in a hurry before one of the other scavengers stole a seat for their friends in line. Anyway, I'm sure this place didn't expect for it to be so busy/popular which explains the limited seating. If there's one thing I had to point out, it would be that and only that. Otherwise, I walked out full and completely satisfied.",Yi8blDfoSpyAg1lvLBFJpA,0,0,4,I7TmeggPIjNt3tY04EqrVw

I think if you keep it to one protein and just pack it full of veggies it's a better deal than the signature items. The taro chips are a must, but it was really strange with cheese. I tried to stick to mostly Asian ingredients, but I'm curious to see what it would taste like in a tortilla. 

The place was packed, which is understandable. They had a ton of people working there but it still seemed really slow. They didn't seem to have a good system going as to telling the cashier what people have ordered. I also think they could consolidate some items. Do we really need green onion and red onion? Cabbage and romaine lettuce? Tomatoes and pico? Nice to have the options but they had a hard time hearing and understanding what I wanted for my custom order.

The restaurant is set up like a Chipotle, where you line up and tell the people behind the counter exactly what you want. You get a choice between soy paper and seaweed for the wrap, and brown and white rice for the inside. There are a lot of toppings, including soft-shell crab, yellowtail, salmon, veggies like red onion, jalapeños, radish and lettuce. Sauces include yuzu chili and diablo (which my friend Emma didn't find hot enough but I was burning from.) You can also add guacamole, avocado, cream cheese or tobiko (fish eggs). I tried the Rockport, which was AMAZING--soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumber, red onion, chipotle mayo and sweet anguila sauce. I highly recommend trying one of their combinations instead of creating your own. I'm sure their creations are highly tested.

Once you pay, you can pick up a few of the excellent housemade sauces, including a salsa verde and amazing housemade soy sauce.

My Jaburrito was amazing--very filling, the fish was of great quality, and the flavors just went perfectly together. I was a little apprehensive about the lettuce, and using the salsas, but they actually tasted great together.

I expected it to just be a giant sushi roll but it's more because you can customize it with some alternative ingredients and, maybe more importantly, texture. I had a nori jaburrito with Salmon and Avocado (my favorite simple roll), masago, wasabi mayo and avocado cilantro, lettuce, tortilla strips, and tomato. What sets these rolls apart is mainly going to be the sauces. They add another layer of flavor choices that really makes it enjoyable. I also had a side of seaweed salad, which was pleasant.

My jaburrito was 7.95, which I thought was a good price for fresh fish and great tasting ingredients. Other choices can run as much as 10.95, but I honestly think it's better to choose a favorite protein and make your own rather than jumble 3 or more fish together.

I've also tasted the Jachos with taro chips, which were also tasty, but I don't really know how well it went with fish. I'd think drenching it in sauces and masago and veggies would be the way to go, but I'd have to experiment with that more.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,4,0,5,LIzjinr_y-EM9y032IS6BQ

Pricey, decent, good texture, long beach. 

Sushi? Love. 
Burritos? Love.
Pick and choose style eateries? Love. 
Jaburritos? :(

Having eaten Jaburritos 3 times now I can't say I'm a fan no matter what the hype says. It isn't terrible, its pretty decent, but so many aspects makes it a place that I wouldn't eat regularly. It isn't exactly mind blowing, and really more so a giant hand roll that isn't so giant. Smaller appetite patrons may be satisfied after one sushi burrito, but larger appetite patrons may consider getting 2, which ends up costly. Consider quickly though because the lines are tremendously slow and as the place gets busier it'll only take longer. I have been in line for at most 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a sit down, but for a pick and choose restaurant its rather slow. Lunch breakers consider ordering ahead of time.The Long Beach may be the best of the ones I've tried.

The sauces are great here (my favorite is queso, weird eh?) but mask most of the flavors of the fish which seems counter intuitive if you're here to eat fish.                There is good texture though, with creamy and crunchy being most prominent. The salsa cups are paper cups but a larger variation is needed for dine in (there is 2 separate cups for dine in and take out), too small to be useful for chips. 

There is a variety of prices for each burrito ($6-12) but seems to be a bit expensive for the size.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,7,3,3,2VsiKMoIuzLbtnnTjCpa0w

* i had the 'huntington' and added ahi tuna, xtra jalapeños and diablo loca sauce (wrapped in seaweed) i got additional salsa and jalas from the salsa bar bc i do like my mouth on fire basically, lol. however, i didnt end up using any of the extra bc it was plenty of heat already!!  it was HUGE n i didnt think i was guna be able to finish, but it was so freakin good, i DID eat the entire burrito!!!
* we also ordered taro chips --BOMB! w/cheese sauce to dip em in and some edamame (which we didnt even end up eating bc were so full!)

3849340,2015-10-24,0,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"Sushirritos have long been a trend in California, and like everything in Vegas, we get it years later. At least we get it from the people behind Soho, the best sushi place in town. 

We got the Redondo and the Rockport to share, both sans red onion (he's picky). The mistake was ordering it just on soy paper, like I always have in California. These weren't really ""Mexican fusion,"" they were really just large sushi rolls beside the fried tortilla strips and cilantro. Which was good But they needed a tortilla to really feel like a sushirrito. (Plus, just being wrapped in the soy paper made them a little drippy on the ends, which wouldn't have been a problem on a tortilla.)

The rolls themselves were really great, but I have to give the edge to the Rockport--the soft shell crab was great. It also was more substantial than the Redondo, though the flavors of each were great. But again: these are big sushi rolls with primarily sushi flavors, not burrito flavors. Fair prices ($10.95 each) considering all the seafood in them both. 

As a side we ordered taro chips and mochi. Mochi was mochi--nothing else to say there. The taro chips were great, perfectly cooked and not oily, with some kind of sugary seasoning on them. What was weird was the nacho queso sauce that came with them. It was good...but it mixed kind of weirdly with the seasoning. 

I'll probably be back sometime soon, and I'll definitely try a different roll, on a tortilla this time. They've only been open two weeks but the line was out the door the whole time we were there, so it's safe to expect this place will be open for awhile.

3877212,2015-10-20,2,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"Is it a giant sushi roll or are handrolls just miniature versions of a jaburrito? We might never know the answer to this chicken or the egg question, but this new fusion joint is spot on. The marinade of Asian cuisine neatly wrapped inside a roll is not a new idea. Fusion burritos have been around for nearly a decade with the advent of Korean burrito food trucks. Sushirrito was the original sushi burrito concept to open in San Francisco. I've tried them all, and in the past, I've found this concept to be a poor substitute for actual sushi because the pieces of tuna or salmon were cut in such a way that they were too chewy and stringy. It was, in essence, a larger, shittier version of actual sushi. 

Fast forward to the soft opening of Jaburritos last week. This place takes a step in the right direction. Most of the menu items are affordable starting at $5.25 and up. Not only do they have raw fish, they also add a crunchy option to the mix with the offering of shrimp tempura and soft shell crab. I settled on the popular Redondo, which is filled with three different kinds of fish: salmon, yellowtail, and ahi tuna mixed with tobiko, guacamole, red onion, cilantro, wasabi mayo, and cream cheese wrapped in seaweed (soy paper also available). Each and every bite was delicious. Although I wish I could have appreciated the flavor of the sauce more, the ratio of fish to rice was great. The addition of the different self-serve salsas went wonderfully with each bite. However, for nearly double the price of some of the other fishes, I might have just ordered two separate tuna and yellowtail jaburritos in retrospect. All in all, the fish quality was great and I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other things including the jachos.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,4,3,4,gCepvaqXP-mjdf5N2uIWQw

I admire their desire to be different, to be adventurous.

BUT Jaburrito has the same problem that sushi restaurants have. The food has no flavor; you have to add flavor....with sauces and add-ons.

Let's be honest here: rice has no flavor. It's like little pieces of styrofoam. 
Most raw fish has no flavor, other than slightly fishy. 
Now combine all that into a flour tortilla (or soy paper etc) which also has no flavor, and guess what: MORE no flavor. 
Oh sure, lots of TEXTURE, but flavor has left the building.
So slather on the wasabi, the hot sauce etc.

Hmmmm. I wonder about this food strategy.

SO to test my thesis: after I ordered my Jaburrito, I drove a few blocks down the street to Mariana's and ordered a typical carnitas burrito. Then I went home, and ate half of each.

Guess which one had more flavor....and therefore more satisfaction?

It is called temakizushi (?????), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. 

SERVICE
Their ""assembly line"" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.

FOOD
I ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. 

There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. 

You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.

CONCLUSION
I paid around $10 (tax and tip included) for a burrito that wasn't filling. Maybe I would've enjoyed my experience more if I didn't wait for so long. I will give another chance in the future but 3 stars for now.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,7,5,3,3mjA_vO1XF4DAjbXznYIEw
4039943,2015-10-27,3,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"Jaburritos is run by some passionate cats. I loved going in and meeting the staff and trying their food! The place is very technologically advanced (machine that smushed rice into seaweed) and also Eco-friendly (recycled/repurposed furniture). It made me feel good supporting this business.

Jaburritos does a fusion burrito with sushi concept. You choose a wrap like soy paper or seaweed and then you pick the insides a la Subway type ordering. I opted for one of their pre-decided burritos. 

It had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and an array of veggies. With soy paper I enjoyed the freshness of the burrito. Their veggies were great and the spicy tuna was good. My let down was the shrimp tempura. They give you 2 pieces and the shrimp have very little shrimp in it. The shrimp they use are super breaded. It literally shouldn't even have been on there it was THAT small.  
The price with a canned green tea came out to about $14. Which I think was worth the price. I think for $10.95 a burrito that they could use better shrimp for their shrimp tempura.

I also tried one of their burritos with steak in it and one of their salmon burritos. They were both very good.

Overall I did like Jaburritos, but in my honest opinion I wouldn't go here often. The concept is great and the food is good, flavorful, unique. I would just rather go to an AYCE sushi place is all. I can't be the only one out there. It's really just giant hand rolls. That's just me. To me this falls into the novelty category.

4107088,2015-10-31,7,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"When I saw the culinary mind behind Soho in the house, my expectations grew higher. They were exceeded.

I've anticipated the opening of Jaburritos ever since I heard that Chef John Chien Lee of Soho Japanese Restaurant was launching a new place. I finally got to try it when I met up with friends for an early lunch. And yes, the man himself was present, watching the front line and working around the back counter and the kitchen while still smiling to customers. How could that not be a great omen?

Jaburritos is his take on the fusion of sushi and burritos. Unlike other concepts that I've tried (local AYCE joint JJANGA and LA-based food truck Jogasaki, the latter a regular sight at the twice-yearly Foodie Fest), Jaburritos actually incorporates Mexican ingredients into the burritos and provides a basic ""salsa"" bar to boot (mild salsa, salsa verde, and salsa roja in addition to ginger, wasabi, and house soy sauce).

I like the location and the space. It's on Sahara across from Palace Station, so it's not far from the freeway. The inside is bright and welcoming with environmentally conscious decisions (full-on LED lights, anyone?) and relatively modest seating (maybe 30 people max). The line moves quickly, and it's very natural to compare the ordering experience to Chipotle because of the assembly line format, the ""burrito"" bowl option, the possibility of customization (although the pre-designed, beach-named menu items seem like winners), and of course the (sometimes) bagged chips available at the cashier.

I decided not to look into the possibility of ""jachos"" (corn or taro chips topped with sushi ingredients) and I didn't feel up to making a burrito from scratch, so I went for the easy preset options. For the choices available with these, I asked for the soy paper, not the nori wrap, so as to match the presentation of the aforementioned sushi burrito purveyors. I also stuck to the white sushi rice instead of the brown rice because they stated that the latter didn't have the sushi vinegar.

Taro chips with queso ($2.99 for the side order, i.e. not the combo): I must mention this first. I kept munching on this and almost ignoring the burritos because they're so addictive. The taro chips are much like the Terra packaged version except dusted with furikake. They're fun on their own, but something about the combination of the taro chips with that liquid cheese dip that makes it very tough to stop. I somehow tasted a light sweetness with the combo, and it definitely wasn't from the queso alone. Definitely make this a part of your order, whether it's the shareable-size side portion or a smaller portion in the drink combination.

Rockport ($10.95): soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi, jalapeño, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla (eel) sauce. It's easy to point to the two powerful sauces as the reason that this has been a winner with others, but it wouldn't succeed without the other ingredients combining harmoniously. The tempura crunch is the standout of the non-sauce components. I could probably eat this all day, but I shared half with a friend in exchange for...

Redondo ($10.95): ahi, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeño, cilantro, wasabi mayo. It wasn't as purely fun as the Rockport, but it's almost as delicious. The fish stand out in this burrito, proving that you don't need so many sauces to have a good sushi roll. Or a good Jaburrito, one that I'd also order again.

[UPDATE 11/3/15: Went again with different friends, tried the Kodiak ($8.95): grilled salmon, romaine, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango teriyaki, chipotle mayo, and furikake. It wasn't very good, and I had to keep adding flavor from soy sauce and the various salsas. Skip this, and design your own grilled salmon combo if you must.]

I tried the salsas with everything. I didn't find that they significantly elevated anything (except for the lackluster Kodiak), but they weren't incompatible and provided a fun accent. The soy sauce helped the Redondo more than the sauce-laden Rockport. I skipped the ginger and wasabi since I feared unnecessarily sharp flavors, but they looked like standard fare at least.

Jaburritos is a great choice for lunch or a light dinner. With fresh ingredients and solid execution, Chef Lee has proven the concept of sushi and Mexican fusion while creating the best rendition of the sushi burrito that I've had thus far. I can't wait to return to try different options and eventually make my own Jaburrito from scratch.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,8,5,Z76qyivXFBR-BisCmMildQ

They took the concept of the sushi burrito and blew it up and continue to use the same high quality of fish in the process. I love that they are the first ones to bring this to Las Vegas. I love that there are so many choices of fish, toppings and sauces to choose from. And I love that they created this restaurant entirely of recycled materials. 

Who cares if there's a wait? When you finally sit down and bask in the burritos glory, it's worth it. How many restaurants do we go to without a reservation and it's a standard 20 to 30min. wait and when you finally sit down, you still have to wait approximately another 30 to 45min. from ordering and actually cooking your food. I don't think anyone ever thought this would have blown up so quickly so we can't blame them for trying to catch up and figure out their flow. 

Anyways, I like building my own burritos because I get greedy with my toppings and protein. You can use fish, chicken, beef, tofu, tempura or soft shell crab as your protein. You can use seaweed or rice paper as your official wrap to seal your burrito. And you can even get brown rice. 

I also love the Jachos. Something about the queso and lightly sugared taro chips just go so well together. You can even customize your Jachos as well. If you're too lazy to add your own toppings, you won't regret getting Long Beach Jachos.

4315017,2015-10-25,0,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"It's about damn time we get a sushi burrito restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been waiting for a long time since trying jogasaki at foodie fest 2 years ago and my dreams have come true. In a nut shell it's really just an uncut sushi roll but eating it burrito style is awesome.

Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. 

Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.

Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). The redondo was the burrito I selected which really is the best bang for your buck. Tuna, yellowtail, and salmon (I highly recommend adding shrimp tempura) This is sushi heaven rolled almost perfectly (it is pretty huge). Comparing this to jogasaki it is about $5 cheaper, and a lot bigger. Foodie fest won't be the same with Jaburrito around.

Service: Friendly but they're more focused on churning through the customers, especially when it's busy it was like waiting for sushi burritos at foodie fest. 

Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.

Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Jaburritos has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,1,0,5,xhQQ_HOKcB4Fkh8xKISv4A

The interior is nice and bright with lots of sunshine. The dining area is not very large and will most likely be full around lunch time. If you've been to chipotle or cafe rio, you will find that the ordering is similar. You can either get a pre-made burrito with your choice of wrap (seaweed, soy paper, wheat/flour tortilla, etc.) or make a totally custom burrito. My first order was the Rockport, which includes soft shell crab, spicy tuna, imitation crab, and other good stuff. It was somewhat spicy with the included jalapeños, but you are more than welcome to substitute anything for anything. My favorite part is the tempura crunch!

They assemble your burrito fairly quickly. They have a fancy machine that builds the perfect layer of rice on which they will lay a sheet of seaweed. At the end of the assembly line is another fancy machine that will wrap your burrito.

I rate it 5 stars because it is just so delicious and fairly quick to order. It's also easy on your wallet, considering you're essentially paying for a sushi roll. Average price for a burrito is $10.

Their soft shell crab was delicious, and their spicy tuna was fantastic. I don't like my tuna too spicy, so it was the perfect amount of spice for me. I also like how you can either have seaweed or soy paper for the rap. 
The place is pretty small, and their place was packed and I went in around lunch time.   They have only been open for a few days and it's already this busy, that must mean they are really good.

I know it shouldn't count against them, but the contributing factors of the rating was the name. On Yelp it was called Jabburitos when it fact they just did a recent name change to SoHo SushiBurrito. It was very confusing driving around the lot trying to locate it with my friend.

Walking in we were greeted by the platoon of workers standing behind the line. Very impressed with this because we got our order from start to payment in no time. The ingredients were fully stocked and nothing seemed out of temp or dated.

I ordered the Triple S (previously known as the Rockport) -  soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab. I enjoyed watching my burrito being made. 

But once the novelty wore off, my stomach took over. I enjoyed and appreciated the freshness of the ingredients. The spice level was perfect for me. Not too much but definitely packed with enough heat that it didn't over power everything else. Nothing worse than having the heat ruin the taste of the other components in a dish. After eating the burrito, along with a cup of their salted edamame, I was left with a feeling of wanting more.

With my mind set on something else and finding out that the restaurant was closed, Jabburitos was my second choice. I will however give them another fighting chance and come back to try the other incarnations of each dish as you can build you own bowl, burrito or nacho.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,2,0,4,cRn_QDPV8Cp7P2VbXhySRQ

I got the rockport without tobiko and subbed cream cheese instead and my husband made his own. They make it right in front of you and they're really friendly and patient. There wasn't too much rice on the rolls and they were pretty hefty with the portions of the proteins and toppings. We got the combo with our meals, we got the seaweed salad and the taro chips and dip. The rolls were really good! My husband said he couldn't taste the sauces too much so we'll have to ask for extra next time. The sauce for the dip was also in a very tiny cup so it was kinda hard to get the chip in there lol. We got too full so we didn't have any room for mochis. Each of our burritos had like 3 types of proteins in there so they were a good size. The place itself is nice, I love how bright it is in there.

I am a sucker for a saucy, crunchy, fresh tasting sushi roll - with a lot going on. I love tempura and eel sauce and avocado - and tuna and salmon and the list goes on and on. This becomes a bit extreme on a roll because they end up being gigantic (and never mind the cost). BUT Chef John Chien Lee solved my problem! THANK YOU MASTER! 

Jaburritos is such a winning concept. It's like the Chipotle of the Sushi world (but better). 
Pick your wrapping - soy or seaweed - (i opted for soy) and then decide whether you'd like a concoction that has already been perfected or if you'd like to take a stab at your own creation. I went  with a modified Rockport - which had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo and sweet anguilla sauce. I said nah to the surimi crab and added avocado and salmon. Enter - my perfect roll! IN A BURRITO! It was so freakin' good. 

These are like a giant hand roll of everything you could ever desire. The thing that makes these so legit though -hands down- is the quality. Nothing is mushy - the rice is cooked perfectly, the fish is fresh and firm. It's a high quality roll in a beautiful blanket of burrito-ness. 

I'm really hoping for an expansion to San Diego because the two places that tried their hand at this concept have failed. PLEASE CHEF LEE - HELP ME OUT!!! 

I promise if you love sushi, you'll love this place - and you'll crave it...often...like all the time. Like every day. ugh.",BJw7sMunTB5uAfvgI4_HIQ,3,0,4,sCTH6YuM8avQItsjMrkuxw

Jaburrito's thing is sushi burritos. For those of you who don't enjoy raw fish they do have chicken, steak and cooked fish. They have burritos that have names or you can just create your own. Which I suggest you do. You can also make it a bowl or nachos. 
It's an assembly line situation. You go down the line and tell them what you'd like in your burrito. What I like in my burrito is I start with the traditional seaweed paper and sushi rice. For my protein choice I pick raw salmon and tempura shrimp. Next, you move onto sauces. If you are unsure of a sauce you can always ask to sample it. I like the poke sauce and the chipotle mayo. Last, you move on to veggies and things. I like to add guacamole, cream cheese, cucumbers, and roasted corn. Jaburrito has a super sweet machine that presses the burrito all together. That's it! You have a fabulous and tasty burrito.

I wish they had a location closer to me, but it's so good it's worth the drive. If you like sushi and burritos Jaburrito is a must try!!!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,5,2,5,6jjHGukydiWa7H08A9wppg

The menu is simple: 
1) Pre designed concoctions: *probably the most popular choice if trying for the first time*
2) Build your own sushi burrito, jachos, or rice bowl.

Items tried:
- Redondo: If you love raw fish it is loaded with yellowtail, ahi tuna, and salmon! Not the most flavorful, but flavors can be enhanced with the house soy sauce and extra wasabi! Or salsa from the salsa bar, if that's your thang. 

- Long beach: One of my favorites! It has shrimp tempura, surimi crab, and spicy tuna. The flavors of the chipotle mayo and sweet anguilla sauce puts it over the top!

- Baja: Yellowtail and spicy tuna. Good, but not great. I only sampled this. I think it needed a second flavor profile. The yuzu guacamole alone did not have the oomph. Maybe a salty/sweet element was missing?

- Jachos with ahi tuna and toppings of your choice! Imagine the set up like Chipotle or Subway. 

- Taro chips with queso. So addicting. The whole idea of ""cheese"" is weird at first, but totally works! Love that these chips are dusted with furikake!

I love the high quality fish, house made sauces, fresh ingredients, and nice touches like the crunch from the tortilla strips!  

Workers are friendly and have a great attitude. My initial visit, they were less efficient and still working out the kinks. Second visit, was much improved. I would imagine it would only get even better with time.

I tried the Kodiak with brown rice and fresh salmon. This normally has grilled salmon so, the fresh salmon was extra. The fish quality was good.

The restaurant is tiny with only a few tables. I'd recommend taking your food to-go because of the lack of seating and you'll end up smelling like cooking oil. The service is great though.

And for the non seafood eaters, they have chicken and steak. I like that they have tons of fresh veggies you can add and seaweed salad.  The tortilla chip option also gives it a nice crunch to the rolls.  They also have chips, I wish they had a wonton chip nachos with a mix of fishes/crab, eel sauce, etc.  Lol....if the owner is reading this...I've been dreaming of a place that would serve nachos like the ones at Samurai Burrito in Fountain Valley, CA ;).

She made a huge deal out of it and called her manager and pretty soon every employee was crowded around staring at me. And then the manager backed up the employee. So I walked out and they lost a customer. 

Too bad, because I was hoping this would be my go-to place, since I work nearby.",1Qo3Pw-XRPaaNfpGPmmORA,2,1,1,y399zCFFsfrE17RUABU2DA

For instance,  I thought it was all build -your -own until I sat down and saw the flashing menu.  Tip to the owner - slow down the flashing screen.  Doesn't allow time to really read.  Anyway,  back to the food that I devoured.   I ordered soy paper, spicy tuna, salmon, fish eggs, wasabi aioli, cucumbers and pico.  Glad she told me about the combo so I added miso soup and a drink.   All up and in $13.  Not bad for the freshness and quality.

5531147,2015-11-16,1,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"Sushi burrito..  Interesting concept but even cooler in person!!  It's just a really HUGE sushi roll!! 

You can opt for a normal-ish burrito -depending on the extras you decide to add. And they have tortillas.  So fear not, non-adventurous sushi people. 

I made my own, with the nori rice- which is a nice thin layer. Got some shrimp tempura and some random stuff in it, but the seaweed salad was the best part! 

Prices are reasonable considering the prices at a normal sushi joint are about the same or more for a smaller portion. 

We also got the queso and taro chips. Both of which were pretty good. 

We left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed and with a good feeling in our belly that it wasn't a greasy, oily, heavy meal. 

There isn't too many tables, I'm sure on a busy night during the dinner rush it can get pretty busy.

JABURRITOS hit the spot for me and the fiancé tonight.  Craved sushi but didn't want to go to a busy sushi restaurant.  I've seen places like this in Cali so I'm happy to see they've finally brought it to Vegas.   

All the guys working there are super friendly and they will help you out if you have any questions about the menu.   

The ordering is similar to chipotle/subway where they make it in front of you.  
The fish is fresh and they are generous with the condiments.  You can choose to customize it if you'd like or opt for a salad instead of a burrito.  If you want to ""make it a combo"" it includes a drink and you add a side salad, chips or, mochi.  The side salad was seaweed and I was craving cucumber salad, which they didn't have but the chef gave me some sauces to make it ... awesome ! 

This place isn't quite on my side of town, but I definitely would recommend others to come here to get your SUSHI BURRITO FIX !",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,3,2,5,pFanZnzYixvM0jSM-4N5Ew

They offer salads, bowls and burritos  (wraps) with your choice of sushi. It's similar to a Subway sandwich shop where your selection moves down a food assembly line whereby you may choose your fresh ingredients. At the end of the line, they offer an array of sauces to top your meal.  

There is a shirt learning curve to understand the menu but we'll worth the brainpower.",Igju-tNzMmIn4LRldU5WrA,0,0,5,lCeYIlhAtgKnRxUKAecoAg
5588896,2015-10-31,0,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"This place is sooo good. Such a fresh concept. This is where I will go if I crave sushi but don't want to have a whole sit down dinner for it. The fish is fresh, the ginger is yummy, and the prices are decent. There's a cool rice pressor machine to give you a thin layer of sushi rice in your jaburrito and another cool roller machine to make sure your roll is nice and tight. 

The only thing is the rice pressor machine is the limiting factor. The wait a quite long for a process that should be pretty quick. 

Today we tried the Rockport and Redondo. Go for the Rockport! Its so yummy! Flavor is great and spicy too. Redondo is good for you sashimi lovers as there is fresh chunks of fish. 

Also, service is great. They are nice and explain things if you don't understand. My fav sushi chef, nunu, which transferred from Soho is here too! Makes me sad that he's not at Soho, but that's OK.",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,1,1,5,o2nE3uDnrsZFoDVWCaUp2Q

I created my own Jachos with taro chips, ebi shrimp, crab, guacamole, pico de gallo, and had the nacho cheese on the side.  Wow, those taro chips are amazeballs!  I could have eaten another serving and plan to very soon.

The b/f created his own Jaburrito with salmon, ahi, brown rice, and chips and was also tempted to get another creation, but the line became super long as we were eating our first go-round.  Word is definitely out on this place.

Sometimes new spots disappoint because those expectations become unreasonably high, but Jaburritos did not; we'll definitely be back sooner than later.

*TIPS:
Our party of six arrived around 6:15pm on Tuesday night and we were lucky enough to snag a table for all of us.  However, it wasn't too long before the place got packed.  It's new, so patience is key.  Check out the menu online so you have an idea of what you'd like to create or try one of their own Jaburritos.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,13,9,4,BBDlCxNMIGo6-HefiPikag
5622078,2015-12-06,1,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"This place was pretty bomb. It's mainly sushi with an attempt to make it mexican-esque like adding jalapeños, guac, red onions, etc - which I think is weird with sushi, but I guess some people are down for it. They had selections to choose on the menu so you don't have to choose yours from scratch. I got the RockPort one, and it was so good! I told them to take off the jalapeños cuz it's weird. I also should've told them to take off the red onions and add avocados. 
It was funny cuz the guy who checked us out said ""for go"" all nonchalant instead of ""for here or to go"". Haha! Also, they have Asian drinks you would find at the Asian market next to Jarritos! It's so odd to see those together.

Other than that, the place was clean and a modern design.

Just a suggestion for the store: It would be nice if they had like classic rolls like California roll, caterpillar rolls, dragon roll, etc in a burrito form. That would be so much better.",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,1,1,4,od5Tnyedpa4_EiI5pq9MUg

The line is set up kinda like Subway...you pick whether you want nachos, a burrito, a bowl, or a salad, and then you can choose between their signature burritos or build your own.  I got the redondo which is Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Cucumber, Tobiko, Guacamole, Red Onion, Tortilla Strips, Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Lettuce, Avocado, Cilantro, Wasabi Mayo, with Soy Paper ($11.84 after tax).

They have an awesome machine that rolls the rice onto the nori/soy paper.  A sushi machine! Never seen one before.  Fancy-schmancy.  

Honestly, I don't even know how to review this place because...well...I don't like sushi.  THERE.  I SAID IT.  I've tried, really.   I want to like it so bad because it's to beautiful and hip!     

Like Manami S. noted, the assembly line was chaotic, with the guys reaching over each other and reading the recipes off a piece of paper.  The same guy asked me twice about somebody else's burrito, then the cashier tried to charge me for the person behind me.  My burrito was missing the cream cheese and the onion.  Mildly irritating but understandable in their first few weeks of opening. 

The place was crowded and there's only seating for maybe 20 people so we took our burritos over to McDonalds and ate them.  I got about five bites in before I gave up and gave my other half to my new friend.  If I ever go back, I'll stick to the white girl options like the waikiki (chicken) or the boardwalk(steak).",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,10,10,4,oyP39FBKHE_QVvPB5OGXng

Atmosphere - Really clean, simple setting restaurant. 

Menu- Easy to read with lots of options. 1) you could either customize your own burrito 2) pick a roll that's already customized. 

Food - I got the redondo and it was delicious!! It came with tuna, salmon, and yellowtail (Fave fish). 10/10 they always make their own soy sauce which was more on the thick side but really good!!

5910882,2015-10-29,1,sHsjBV5_kuuC2aU2PuSlUg,"This is the sushi burrito of my dreams :D 

Think ""Chipotle/Subway-meets-Japanese fusion"" and you'll get the gist of this place.  They have large sushi burritos, bowls and salads, with your choice of different fresh fish (spicy tuna/ yellowtail/salmon/soft shell crab/ etc) or chicken, veggie toppings, and sauces. And it's all prepared when you get up to the counter in assembly-line fashion. Much like Chipotle, some add ons are extra like guacamole or seaweed salad. The sushi rice, for a semi-fast food place is great! And the quality of the fish is pretty great too!  

I had a make-my-own sushi burrito in a soy paper wrapper on sushi rice with spicy tuna + salmon + cucumber + red onion + tomatoes + seaweed salad + chipotle mayo + sweet anguille sauce. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I ate the whole thing in one sitting ( a little big but sushi doesn't keep well).  I got a combo just to try the taro chips with cheesey sauce...meh, I'd skip that next time. 

If you don't want to think too hard, they do have jaburritos already concocted for you with names like Redondo & Long Beach (California dreaming much?). 

My only complaint is that this place is kinda slow....or more so that during lunch time this place gets incredibly packed so get ready to wait in line for a while before getting to order. There is also very limited seating. Otherwise, this might become a very regular lunch spot for me :P",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,2,2,4,3zJJnVADtRu5102raiFpwA

When all of that is factored, everyone knew that I'd be a fan when Vegas finally joined on the sushi burrito train. This place is good, really really good. Which is why it's a 4.5 star from me. The location is nice, across the street from palace station, it's very minimalist and clean. I've gone here so much the staff even remember me and my order. My top two favorites by far are the long beach and the Baja. If you want to go off menu, that's totally fine because it's a create your own burrito type deal , so throw on your crown and have it your way boss. One thing that sets them apart from another sushi burrito place is that they are definitely more dedicated to fusion. They have more traditional burrito items so it doesn't always just feel like sushi to go. The lines can get long, but I can't penalize a business for being too popular. They definitely could improve the ordering system. It seems to get slow at times, and I'm not sure if that's just a product of new people or what, but maybe call ahead ordering would be legit.

I was super excited to find out that Vegas finally has a place with the concept of sushi burritos so I definitely had to check it out. I love seafood, so it took me a while to decide on one of their choices, but I finally settled on the Rockport ($11.25) mainly because of the soft shell crab along with some sweet anguila sauce and wasabi mayo on the side. You also have a choice of getting it wrapped in nori dried seaweed... and a couple others I can't recall because I like nori. I wanted to get a smoothie, but they said they're focusing on the food for now so it'll be about another week until they start making the drinks. That's reasonable.

So, how's it taste? I was a bit sad about the overall size and amount of rice that was put, but it was pretty good. My choice may have hindered me from tasting the quality of fish that they have to offer since the soft shell crab is mainly crunch and the spicy tuna is already minced. They have quite a bit of sauces and even a little salsa bar on the side so I definitely recommend trying some additional sauces. I don't think the salsas would go well with the sushi burritos, but try them out with the nachos (or ""Jachos"")

I wasn't wow-ed my first time going, but the owner and other employees seem eager to grow and improve everything which is great! I'll definitely be back to try other things and see how they decide to improve the food.
