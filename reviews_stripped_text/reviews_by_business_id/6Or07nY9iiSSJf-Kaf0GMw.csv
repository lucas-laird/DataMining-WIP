Very good, I've never had a sweet potato ""tortilla"", salsa and seasoning on chicken was delicious, even better I don't feel ""too full"" after eating. The cashier was sweet and kind, since it was my first time she was patient with me and guided me through all their tasty options.

So it was also very close to my gym at my house and where I work, so very convenient for me. I went one time for lunch and got the tuna wrap and a coconut protein ball. The second time I got the turkey meatballs and a coconut protein ball, as well as a piece of strawberry cheesecake for later. All of these items were amazing. I would go back anytime. Especially the variety of cheesecakes is amazing and one piece of it is only 150 cal, which is incredible. The tuna wrap was yummy. I did not like the turkey meatballs too much but that was not because they weren't good, that was only because I like a lot of seasoning and spices, so to me they tasted kind of bland. I am definitely going to go back to get the protein balls once in a while. They are so big you can park them in four pieces. The staff is amazingly friendly. And the second time I walked in the girl that works there recognized me, so that was a super awesome experience. I have recommended This place already to multiple other people",JpyT-I-Zo8s-Izd0kG9caA,0,0,5,b79BTxMgvquwLBlYGKDzxg
2143632,2018-03-17,0,6Or07nY9iiSSJf-Kaf0GMw,"Gluten free, low carb, no added fat, and no added sugar.

Sweet potato everything here. Great concept.
No sugar is added to any of their items. I learned that the longer you cook/bake a sweet potato, the sweeter it gets and that is where they get their sweetness from. They use the white sweet potato in all of their items, which they have displayed throughout the place. Of course I had to try the sweet potato latte $5- it was ok. Adi's offers smoothies, breakfast bowls, salads, crepes, wraps, coffee, tea, and other healthy foods. I came during lunch time and decided to try one of their specials....chicken tacos with sweet potato tortilla. The tortilla felt like a mix between a tortilla and a pancake. It fell apart easily but the food was amazing (even the salsa that it came with). The gal gave me a sample of their banana, sweet potato/cinnamon muffin...perfectly moist with a little bit of sweetness. I purchased that muffin and a sweet potato energy bar To Go. I definitely will be back to try other items they have. The restaurant is bright and nicely decorated, love the teal.

2846501,2018-05-08,0,6Or07nY9iiSSJf-Kaf0GMw,"When I reviewed Adi's cafe 4-months ago I was writing from the positive experience. Up until recently the lunches and check-ins here were consistently wonderful so I recommended this place to several coworkers.  Today for lunch I ordered the turkey burger which is sandwiched between two thick slices of sweet potato rather than a bun. I've ordered this once before and it was delicious. When I was presented my food I could tell it was different than before as the lettuce was different and it seemed very runny. Upon cutting open the turkey patty I saw more liquid and uncooked meat which turned me off. So I walked up to the counter to address that my food was not thoroughly cooked. The immediate reaction by the staff was an excuse or defensive approach ""oh, we cook with paprika that's probably it""...instead of examining the meat and seeing it truly was half-cooked.  Then once she realized it was in need of further cooking she sent back to the kitchen. After a few minutes passed, I was greeted with the same exact meal I was served - yes, that's right - the turkey patty I cut in half with the same sweet potato slices and all topped together as if to pass it on as brand new. I understand not being wasteful, but never in any other dining experiences have I been served the original dish if anything was in question. And, it's usually met with an apology, not a defensive approach. I was beyond disappointed in lack of care and have decided that today would be my last visit. Hopefully the coworkers I've sent over don't share in my experience when they order.",LC_o79IQTseA2Qi41v_rMg,4,0,2,AtPmXOQNCe9zXcEYjNgSHQ
2906704,2018-04-06,1,6Or07nY9iiSSJf-Kaf0GMw,"4/2/2018:  This was my first visit here and it looked like a good, healthy place to have lunch. I love sweet potatoes (well, who doesn't, right?) so I thought this was going to be a perfect lunch. I was in a rush (had a doctor's appointment in about 15 minutes) and didn't really have a lot of time to study everything on the menu, so I chose the Sweet Potato Wrap, thinking that sweet potato cubes would be in the wrap. The wall description for the Sweet Potato Wrap said chicken, avocado, and spinach, and the cost would be $8.00.

Okay a little steep on the price but I was willing to give it a try. When the wrap came, it was a brown wrap - really quite uninviting and with no ""curb appeal,"" but I was hungry and dove in. After my second or third bite into the wrap, I started to look for the sweet potatoes, since the wrap was mostly filled with spinach leaves and chicken cubes - could hardly find any avocados and certainly no sweet potatoes.

I went over to the cashier and mentioned that there were no sweet potatoes in my wrap. She replied that the wrap is actually made from sweet potatoes and that's why the name of the item is called Sweet Potato Wrap. I told her that I thought sweet potatoes would be inside the wrap and I was very disappointed - especially paying $8.65 (with tax) for a tasteless, dry wrap (no sauce or dressing inside the wrap for flavor). As for the taste of the outer wrap, it was tasteless - like eating brown paper wrapping that you use to wrap gifts with - except it was soft and not hard. Nothing about the Sweet Potato Wrap was enjoyable...nothing. Too much spinach - waaaay too much spinach, lots of chicken (that's good, but even the chicken was tasteless), and if there were any avocados in the wrap, I certainly didn't see or taste them.

For me, the place is not only over-priced, but the Sweet Potato Wrap is tasteless. It was a real chore to finish the entire wrap, which I did the next day. I forced myself to ""down"" it because I made it more palatable by adding some salad dressing inside the wrap for some flavor. Too much money and no flavor, so I'm not coming back.",jIH2fzQfXY7RW3C3W1Z1iQ,2,0,2,rcettuk2jnDh59Iarlnigg

4195825,2018-04-18,0,6Or07nY9iiSSJf-Kaf0GMw,"I've been here a few times, I usually order the Sweet Potato Wrap which has chicken, avocado, and spinach. This time I wanted to try something different so I looked through the menu online. The Thai Peanut Sweet Potato Noodles looked appealing by the image posted on the menu. It was listed for $8, and you can add chicken for an additional $2. So that's what I decided to order, along with a strawberry and kiwi detox water. My total came out to be $14 and some change. I ordered for a pick up so I can take it back to work.

I picked up my order, the staff was courteous. When I got back to work, I looked at my food and it was NOT as advertised on the menu online. It was EXTREMELY cold, the cubed chicken that was added was dry and cold. The taste of the sauce was very awkward and bland. Everything was just kinda mushed together like a typical potato salad. It was not actual noodles as the image I seen online, it's shreds/strips of sweet potato. The strawberry and kiwi detox water was just overloaded with fruits I could barley stir my straw around to get the little amount of water that was in the cup.

When I called and told them I was not satisfied with my order, the girl who answered the phone kind of shook it off. She did not show strong customer service qualities in making the situation better. Overall, I'm sad to say this was a unsatisfactory visit and I don't think I will be spending my money here.",4wdelnr96jkYkDNmQTmr6w,1,0,2,_2f9_PfwwYN-zEuuBacBiw

No white flour, sugar or oil, powered by the potato. I love it! The owner, (Sorry didn't catch his name-possibly Aida?) was just getting ready to open up for the day.

4417563,2018-06-07,0,6Or07nY9iiSSJf-Kaf0GMw,"I want to like this place. I really do. 

First, let me start with the staff. Very friendly and very helpful, especially to a new customer. They made great suggestions. 

Now, let's get to the food. I'm just not feeling the food. I got the quinoa balls. Not only were they not balls (more like a patty), but they were huge and tasted more like a Christmas cookie. I was thinking of something more in the realm of a donut hole size. They were packed with good stuff like cranberries, walnuts, etc. and had a bit of a curry flavor. I just wasn't into it. The inside of them was also super mushy. It wasn't a pleasant texture. I think if these were smaller and didn't have dried cranberries they would be more palatable. 

On the side were giant sweet potato wedges. They didn't have much flavor and were just mushy. I didn't end up eating them.

The green sauce that came with them was pretty spicy. Although I'm OK with spice, I could see how for someone else, it might be too hot, especially since I wasn't told it had some kick to it. 

I hope to come back to this place and try something else on the menu. Again, the staff was nice and the place is beautifully decorated and clean. I think I just picked the wrong menu item. =)",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,2,2,3,teg5YpetECFMzBTAl6rSjg

I am used to sweet potato in my diet with no sugars and no process carbs so this was a no brainer when it came to trying this place out. 

The place smells fresh and awakening as you walk in and the people working make it feel easy to chill a bit while looking over the menu. They also do let you sample one of the muffins that they choose to cut at the time which is nice for people to know what to expect with the baked goods. 

The banana sweet potato cinnamon muffin I had was a little more on the dry side compared to the sample I had which was weird, unless they left it out  or gave me an older one. The sweet potato latte was ok but I asked for it iced not hot and they made a hot one so I kindly asked to have it switched but I feel like the person still didn't know how to make it iced very well since there was not that much milk in it and the coffee tasted a little like burnt popcorn.

Adi's however stands out in a town with an array of franchises.  Here it's all about the vegetable, sweet potato right down to the sweet potato latte;)
My favorite recommendation is the sweet potato bolognese- hearty and healthy!  Healthier than a baked potato and yes, indeed more satisfying on those taste buds!
Crepes! Healthy crepes, yes they can be healthy here at Adi's that is.  I've only had the cocoa cream one and it is sweet and savory!
Detox over one of the infused waters, yes water with a twist.  My favorite is the blueberry & lime, different and will tantalize those taste buds.  
The sweet potato wedges are a crispy, roasted side and quite filling in a good way;). Apparently healthier than those other fries out there;)",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,6,2,4,tuQ9GbTTmnpJBezUQH778w
