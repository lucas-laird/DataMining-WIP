The drip coffee was very good (not burnt or over exposed like a lot of 24hour places). I had the best coconut latte I've ever tried- you could actually taste the coconut! They were playing good music. It was small but not overcrowded with junk like some other chain coffee places (*cough*). We didnt try any food because the pastries looked a little dry, but according to the menu they are made in house.  And the best part is that it had lots of windows so we could keep an eye on the car. Overall a great place to kill a few hours.",ArK2MB2QBizzgDDgqRHdgg,0,0,4,dMXnYixZ7dRgM9yw-v2mEw

It makes iced drinks so much more delicious to me. Lots of sweets/pastries.(but priced high.)  The Green Card sandwich (turkey, cheddar, bacon and guacamole) was delish.  Various healthy and vegan choices, even almond, coconut, and hemp milk for your drinks.  The coffee beans' flavor is so rich and not bitter.... Board games to play.... Menu is a lot easier to read/understand at this location, rather than the DI location .... I like it when their music is chill or jazz, anything without lyrics so you can hear each other talking better and be able to read/work better too. :) .....

Cons:.   The prices are a little high, especially for the quality/quantity of the food.  Herbal tea choices are sparse....Only one outdoor table.  Unexpected for a coffeehouse....  the prices are a little high, especially for the quality/quantity of the food.  The tuna sandwich is flavoress and dripping in mayo-type spread......",5fTEVByUVKUhrS-hA4rRNQ,1,0,3,Hu1hGwRkF0FDZ79ZXTQEBQ

Because it is the Super Bowl day, the cafe is seemingly quiet, but I'm sure it gets busy. Plus, they have a drive-thru station which is just as good as it gets. The place is very small, but very homey. The staff smiles and greets you when you enter and greets you farewell when you leave. That, for me, earns points. The drinks are pretty good for their prices. I would definitely visit this place again. Free internet but is only free for 120 minutes.

When I decided to leave Las Vegas, I knew that I was also leaving a second ""home,"" I was a regular, and I always felt comfortable getting work done. There were a few times when I would get into really great conversations with Las Vegas locals, and I actually bought a good deal of artwork from Recycled Propaganda whose work you'll see around the café. Now that I'm settled back on the East coast, I miss my West coast staple. However, I know that it's a place that I can go to where I can feel at peace and be around good people. I even ran into friends here (and I hadn't told them about Madhouse), though people love it and they have the business to prove it.

I say all this to say that I miss Mad House, I miss the Barista's, I miss Marco and his wife, and they made it that much more difficult to move when I left. However, they will always be a shining star during my 2 years in Las Vegas. With that said, when I'm back in town vacationing, I will definitely go out of my way to drop by and say hello, and absorb the good vibes of Mad House.",EOCN2e60YZO2ILPVu8qmeg,0,0,5,OQ9M812YDmf8aSwtE2Sqjw

When I called the store to find out when the owner was going to be at the Eastern location, I was unaware that the manager's relative put my call on speaker phone so the manager could hear my comments without my permission. 

The next day, the manager confronted me in front of 10 customers and asked if I was the one who left a message to speak to the owner.  I was not prepared for the conversation and nor did I want to voice my concerns to someone who was looking for a fight and in a crowded coffee shop.
 
If you don't care how hard you work for your money, then you can continue buying your coffee fix from them. But if you want to be respected for your business, then find another place to purchase your fix. This place does not care about customers since the manager was being confrontational with me in front of customers and lied about the product being fresh. She can't even make a good cup of coffee.  Customers shouldn't be expected to defend themselves if they have a problem with product they are paying for.

We had the Groupon for $10 and ordered nutella tiramisu, a chocolate croissant, a red velvet mocha and a monkey mocha. Still ended up paying $8.. a little pricy.

Nutella: I love nutella. I eat it plain. Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts. I thought this would be a home run. Nope.. awful! Anyone who says otherwise needs to have their tastebuds evaluated. It tastes like expired cream cheese and cocoa with a crumble of espresso soaked ladyfingers. It's bad!

Chocolate croissant: mediocre

Red velvet mocha: AWESOME! It's 2am and I'm considering driving over for another. Best frozen coffee drink of all time. Kudos.

Monkey mocha: I tried it. My brother wouldn't drink it, and he eats anything. It was okay. If you like the artificial banana flavor, you will love it. I think fresh bananas would work much better.

I came here once, years ago, in a land far far away and really liked it. Then...I totally forgot about it. I don't know why, because I remember it being great, but I forgot. 

So, like 3-4 years goes by, my baby mama is out of town and I'm taking our little feller to an indoor playground (because it's 1,000 degrees outside). I'm about to drive by this place and I'm like, ""yo, I remember that joint, it was bombtastic, I should get a blended iced beverage to help me cool down on this very warm day."" Best decision ever.

I went with the Mocha Monkey. The name isn't just awesome, the taste is too. Banana, chocolate, chocolate chips, and mocha blended into a smooth, creamy consistency that I can only describe as a milkshake, but better. I drank this in about 5 minutes. The indoor playground is across the street. I literally had one swig left by the time I pulled up.

So what did I do the next day? Yep. Got another.

Side note...chatted it up with the dude who took my order. We talked about the Golden Knights and how cool it was that they made the Stanley Cup. Friendly fella who made natural conversation, didn't feel forced or like he was pushing for a tip. Appreciated that.

It's a tiny little spot on eastern, PAST the starbucks at the 215 exit. You might not notice it if you weren't looking for a good coffee alternative to the corporate norm. Lucky for you, I found it and am here to write a review about it.

Like I said, they're tiny. They have maybe 5 -6 tables inside and 2 nice recliners. My master bedroom is practically as big as this place, but that's not such a bad thing. The furniture is moderny throwbacky and the music is alot of throwback eighties electronic and nineties rock-- quite comforting to an ear that its had its fill of top 40 sewage. I put in my ear plugs and sat in a corner and studied moderately well. This is where you go to get away from the people you know studying at the starbucks.

The staff is friendly and willing to help newbs like you decide what to get. On one hot day I decided to try the iced mint mocha, which turned out to be an excellent choice. It was honestly better than just about any frappucino you can get at Starbucks (and I have had them all) though the price isn't much better. 
I've also had their hawaiian dark roast, which had an interesting tang to it. At 2 bucks a medium, it is definitely competitively priced with the corporate big wigs.

This is a small coffee shop with a few tables outside as well as wicker furniture. The inside is pretty much filled with tables, not much space to move around if there were lots of people on the inside. They have a drive-thru which most people seem to use instead of coming inside. Since it was a hot morning, I decided to have my coffee in-house and enjoy the AC.

Even though this place is small, it was nicely decorated and everything seemed clean. They have a bookshelf full of games for those that want to spend some good time here with friends and have some fun. 

This place has a large menu with lots to choose from. I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted to have. Their hot drinks come in 12 oz/$4, 16 oz/$5, 20 oz/$5.75 and their Over ice & Blended drinks, as well as their Smoothies and Ice Teas, come in 16 oz, 24 oz, and 32 oz. Their prices on those depend on what kind of drink you get. I found that overall their prices are a bit higher than other coffee shops that I've been to here in the area. 

I got the 24 oz Carmel Toe coffee drink which cost $6.25. It was pretty tasty, but a bit too sweet for my liking. It had a lot of caramel flavoring in it that overpowered the coffee taste. Definitely not worth what I paid for it.

The lady that took my order was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu. Since the menu doesn't say what is in each of their drinks she was kind enough to explain what was in the drinks I was interested in getting. My guest got the Peanut Butter blended coffee which was really tasty. They use actual peanut butter and not some flavoring for it and you can tell the difference. A must try for those that love peanut butter.

EXTREMELY happy we took the chance , the cashier was super sweet and helpful . They have such unique , delicious sounding drinks and surprisingly in August offered pumpkin spice so of course I ordered that knowing Starbucks wouldn't have it until the fall . I got a small nonfat iced psl & after the first sip wish I would've gotten a large . My dad got a hot red velvet latte and it tasted better then any red velvet cake I've ever had . If your looking for coffee with light flavor I would opt for one of their unflavored drinks but if your looking for dessert in a cup you've come to the right place . I will definitely be back to try their other coffees , and I can honestly say after these two drinks madhouse has the best coffe I've ever had .",Xr7zgZ7idWW6FINGmh8J9Q,10,13,5,IDCV3MBqqZGCXmDHJiiGaQ

So I measured it out and turns out they had put it in a 16 oz. cup.  I went back, measuring cup in hand, and they tried to blame it on the cash register and then the owner, (all the while the manager is telling me how nice she had been to me earlier.)  Needless to say she was quite rude and simply told the barista to give me a medium to make up for the difference-he by the way was very nice and I felt badly for how she spoke to him.

4655258,2013-03-14,4,eS76100l3h7Ollb5s3_M4A,"Variety is the spice of life. Mad House Coffee has a large variety of coffee flavored syrup. Mad House Coffee is to coffee houses what Baskin Robins is to ice cream.

 When I want to add some spice to my morning before work, I check in to the Mad House. My caffeinated beverage is a medium coffee with a flavored syrup.

  The flavored syrups personalize the coffee drinking experience.  If I want to feel tropical, I get pineapple syrup. If I want to feel peachy, I get peach syrup. If I want to feel nutty, I get coconut syrup.  If I want to feel conservative,  I get the classic syrup. If I want to feel satisfied,  I get the strawberry syrup.

  I also check in at the Mad House for my caffeine boost before work. If I were to compare their coffee to gasoline,  it would be 93 octane. It is a level of caffeinated fuel to turbocharge me in the early morning and have me bouncing through the leading hours of my eight hour shift.

 When I drink coffee here, I am sitting inside a former It's A Grind on the northwest corner of Eastern at Pebble. It is close enough to Interstate 215 to be on my ""Exit off the 215"" list.

  The shop is relatively small. It isn't really cozy or hip like Grouchy John's. When I spend time, I hear the uptempo 80s songs playing on their music system. I have had zero issues getting a table. I am usually the only patron sitting inside.

  It is a good thing that Mad House is not busy. Everytime I have been there, one employee has been running the shop and drive thru. That person also cooks the sandwiches and cafe food.

  Before work I need to add some spice to my morning and high octane caffeinated fuel to my body. Before an 8 hour shift at a real mad house, I will be checking in to this Mad House.

Of the 3 out of 4 items I've had, 3 were gross. The time I stopped for a bagel sandwich and 2 shots of espresso over ice with almond milk. The bagel sandwich was soggy, bland and rubbery. The drink was great. Then, last week I stopped for an early lunch. I ordered the ""Wannabe"" which wasn't my favorite name for a sandwich but sounded good. It was not. I was in a hurry and ended up waiting over 20 minutes for it. And it wasn't worth the wait. Again, it was rubbery. I learned it was because of the use of a microwave. The ingredients don't taste high quality.... I accompanied it with an iced green tea that was really an iced water with a tinge of green. You could barely taste that green tea was even brewed near the cup let alone in it. Because it's a drive thru and it's a local place, I may give it a final 3rd... 3 strike your out at some point...

Coffees - My only issue is that for a regular brewed coffee, it is already in pots that you pump and poor to your cup. I tend to prefer freshly, immediate brewed coffee.

This place was alright at first. I kept giving it chance after chance. But I've had enough. The workers are very unprofessional and rude. One particular female working there just has a very impolite attitude. Don't use their drive thru, One SMALL latte will take more than 10 minutes. Also they've overcharged me on multiple occasions. So I started asking for my receipts from then on because they don't even give you one or ask if you'd like it. They will tell you a price but apparently isn't what they charge you.
