375707,2013-10-30,0,UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ,"When it comes to fresh quality Thai food, this hole in the wall restaurant definitely makes the cut.

To start off, walking in the first thing I noticed was how tiny it was. There's enough space to seat 22 people. Doesn't pose a negative affect on the experience, but to some people during busy times it can feel a little crowded. The decor isn't all that appealing but again, this isn't some mainstream restaurant. While I waited to order drinks, I read some other reviews and most people complained about a cigarette-like smell; have never had that experience in all my times there. The staff is very friendly and after going in a couple times they have gotten to know me and greet with a cheerful smile and ""Welcome back!""

My first visit I decided to try the red curry with shrimp. I am a huge fan of red curry so I was ready to put theirs to the test and I can tell you they definitely exceeded the expectations I had for a tiny place like this. Most places are somewhat stingy when it comes to picking a meat other than chicken and they loaded it with plenty of shrimp. I also really enjoy chicken pad thai and after experiencing these two dishes I was in love with this place. Their pad thai noodles didn't have that ""just microwaved"" shiny look some other places have and feature a perfect blend of peanut taste. Grand China is an absolute disaster compared to this place. 

The other day I tried out their lunch special for the first time and for $5.95 the portions are extremely generous. They are about as big as if you went in for dinner, plus you get the choice of egg drop soup or sweet and sour soup along with an egg roll. This time I went with the orange chicken and it was awesome. The chicken wasn't too crispy or too soft and the flavor was on point. I have been craving it ever since. If you enjoy boba tea this is a good place to get some as well.

All in all, this place is a must try. The prices are cheap, the portions are big and the flavor and quality is above the rest in this price range. They deliver too so that's a huge plus. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!!",1WpKr4f0WzHghvK4sQuuwQ,0,0,4,v20Fe3KjZKIrG42I0CvtXg

969113,2013-07-09,2,UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ,"Just a little hole in the wall located in a strip mall.  We've been coming here for some time now and always walk away satisfied and stuffed!

First off the lunch specials are enough to make you want to at least try it once-the food will make you come back for more.  $5.95 lunch specials to include soup, egg roll, rice and the crunchy noodles that you dip in sweet and sour-all to include your main dish with any type of meat you want and any level of spice you can customize.  The portions are gigantic-always.  I never can eat everything and usually take half of it to go.  The Chicken Pad Thai is what I usually order and I am never disappointed.  I order it a spicy 8 (from a 1 - 10 level).  It rarely is spicy enough for me (I can hear my BF now....blah blah blah) but I'm afraid that one day it will be really a spicy 8. LOL

Saturday was an odd day.  They usually have this cute teenager girl working the cashier and tables.  The cook, who I assume is the owner?, was doing it all as I believed him to be the only one there.  I must say that the guy handled it pretty well considering he had several tables occupied yet he still made time to check on them occasionally.  Gotta love a man who can multi-task!  

I ordered the Mongolian Chicken. I was in the mood for rice versus noodles this time.  The dish came with the rice on the side with the Mongolian chicken, onion and green onion.  While the chicken was very tasty, dang there were a lot of onions!  Like I said the portions they give you are so big so it didn't matter to me too much.  I just didn't eat most of the onions.  I didn't eat the eggroll that it came with.  It looked greasy and I rarely will eat them just because of that.  The BF ordered the Mongolian Beef.  That's what he always orders and it is always consistently yummy.

I always notice people picking up to go orders and there are always people seated as well.  They have a TV going that is muted BUT there is music that's playing that makes me want to actually rip my hair out.  For real.  Something about Celine Dion versus Thai food doesn't mesh well with me. hehe

Anyways....Good food.  Big portions.  Cheap eats.  Can't go wrong there!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,3,1,3,qrTSaKGqWgp0KGtjVZhdbA

1273765,2013-10-31,0,UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ,"I was going to give this place two stars but I had to increase my rating to three stars. I gave this place a three star rating because they deliver and their quick. I was desperate for Thai and called at least 9 other places for delivery. Just my luck, none of them delivered to my area. Unfortunately, the restaurants I called prior to calling Little Dumpling are all the four star rated ones. Once I got my first ""yes, I deliver to your home."" I decided to give Little Dumplings a shot. They told me the delivery would take 40 minutes the delivery guy came ringing my door bell in 30. I ordered yellow thai curry, boba tea, and the dumplings. 

First I had the yellow thai curry. It was savory and just the right kind of spicy. I didn't tear up or have major difficulties eating this dish. I personally don't like that kind of spicy. At the same time I wasn't left wondering why my dish wasn't hot enough. If I could change one thing it would be the packaging. The sauce was dripping out of the box that they packed it in. They put the curry and the rice in one Styrofoam box. It would've been better if they put the curry in the same type of container that they put their soup in. 

Next I had the boba tea. I had it for the first time and only ordered it because of a review I read on here. It isn't really my preferred taste but it wasn't disgusting. They gave me a large boba tea instead of small one for the same price. 

So finally let's move on to the dumplings. I saved the worst for last. Honestly, the dumplings sucked. Ironically this place is called Little Dumpling so I would only imagine their dumplings being their best dish. Wrong, they had a burnt taste to them and I gagged after eating it. I don't really have anything else to say about the dumplings cause I took a bite out of one and contemplated throwing them all out. I may have gotten a bad batch. It may be cause my stomach is sensitive right now. So I wouldn't call this a deal breaker

All in all, I am a fan of the customer service, delivery time, price, and the yellow curry. The dumplings surely do need work though. I will give this place another shot in the future. Little Dumpling is definitely worth a try if you're looking to get a quick bite... just stay away from the dumplings or order them at your own risk.",413jyUbgve1MX9hC2wJF5g,0,0,3,6l95yDrWobZe9TLtlwZKuQ

None of that matters if the food you get isn't even fully cooked.

It doesn't taste great, but I can live with that. But not fully cooked? How the hell do they pass food safety inspections?

I've tried 6 different things at this place and all of them have been mediocre at best. The sugar in my almond shrimp last week wasn't even mixed in, I could feel it between my teeth as I was eating the food. Most people wouldn't come back to a place like that after that sort of thing but like I said, it's across the street and I love Chinese cuisine.

TL;DR: If it wasn't for the pink coloring I saw on my chicken, I'd give this place 3 stars. But given that I paid money for food I couldn't even eat without risking indigestion, this place deserves less than 1 star.

To the food. The Panang Curry was watered down and lacked flavor, it was a shadow of the true Panang Curry I've had everywhere else. Next the Pad See Oew... Or what they called Pad See Oew. The noddles were floating in liquid. The noodles were rubberish and it was all very bland. The Pad Thai... Hard to mess this one up right...wrong. First it came out looking neon orange which is no big deal as long as it taste good which it didn't. We got it at spice level 7/10 which I do everywhere. The heat level was good but it wasn't heat with flavor but just all over your mouth heat with the bland noodles. On to the fourth bad dish, the Lo Mein noodles.

Gross, it gave my sister food poisoning and the food was not that great at all. The other little dumpling on decatur is just too oily for me.

This chinese place, gives the right amount of food and the right amount of deliciousness each time we come here. We always get the lunch specials. Comes with soup and your entry. The noodle dishes don't come with fried rice though, but nonetheless you still get a lot of food for $5.95! Whatever dish we order or try, it always comes out delicious. I'm a sucker for their pad thai. Their chow mein is always so good too. Honey walnut shrimp is a must once and awhile because it is just, yummy!! Also their sweet and sour pork is what got me hooked to this place.

This place is also always so clean, people complain about the smell when they walk in. I've gotten used to it. But it is clean and you can sit anywhere. At least when they get health inspections, they always pass. Grand china always fails their health inspections. I wonder why? 

I also come here to get their taro boba. I love boba and theirs is just sweet and the boba is nice and chewy. Sometimes it can be a little 'too' sweet, so you might ask for less sweetness if you'd like. 

I only give 5 stars to places, I really like and enjoy. This place, I really like and enjoy. The decor can be updated, but its okay. I go there for the food and friendly servers.

The green curry is decent, don't bother with the Pad Thai, the noodles are too gummy and it's just not authentic for my tastes. They do a decent Generals Chicken.

I know the sauce can stain and color the noodles, but I'd never had them that color. Usually they are a muted rusty reddish orange. Despite the neon hue, they didn't actually have much flavor.

The pad see ew noodles were also overcooked  and mushy, and the sauce was overly sweet. Pad see ew is usually my favorite, so I was disappointed by its lack of flavor and sweetness. The meat(chicken and beef) in both dishes lacked color and flavor.

All in all, it just seemed like the food was missing something. I don't know if it was simply because I didn't order any of my food hot or what, but I have never had a problem with dishes lacking flavor anywhere else when I ask for less of a spicy kick.",dcpE4CUvtqLf63tRJgNqKQ,2,1,2,jb41PBvOi1E9c5kvN1RqEA

I went Thai style and was not disappointed.

Yellow curry beef, delicious. I've been to Bangkok and I've had home-cooked Thai food for years, this was really good. Home style is a bit more thick on the curry, but this was delightful.

Tom Yum Kai, also delicious, with the caveat that I asked for Thai spicy with the usual ""I've been to Bangkok..."" etc, just short of writing it out in Thai. Not disappointed, in fact I was set back on my heels a bit for the first few tastes until my body remembered.

A nice little spot in a Vons strip mall up here in north part of town, definitely on my list of places and it will not be so long until the next time.

(Note, this order was delivered by DoorDash, and the food arrived so hot and well-packaged that it was tricky to un-bag it without giving it a moment to cool... no complaint there)",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,0,0,5,o9RCF0g9MWHYwnj02MfYfQ

First of all, there is another ""Little Dumplings"" on N Decatur which is quite good. This place, not so much. I ordered the pad Thai, no spice, overly sweet and the shrimp tasted like mackerel. The Mongolian beef also had no spice and was overly sweet, the beef had a texture of something other than that from a cow. The crab rangoons tasted like something out of a gas station vending machine. The salt and pepper shrimp, I love this dish, but not from here. They actually fry and season the shrimp with the shell on! Not just over the tail, the entire shrimp. I usually love leftovers as its a nice meal/slash snack the next day, this wasn't worth the space in my fridge. The lo mein was edible, barely.

5050101,2010-02-22,1,UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ,"It is what it is- not anything great but okay when you need food and I think there are very hit and miss with the menu.

Got delivery-  The salt pepper pork chops were decent , strawberry chicken is kinda weird idea to begin with but could be done right- it was sweet sour sauce with sliced strawberries thrown in....not really good. Eggrolls- okay but slightly too oily, shouldve been patted out thoroughly so they'd be crunchier.

2nd time to deliver- Was really sick and can barely get up to cook....
Fried tofu- yuck. It's tofu pieces battered and was too lightly fried that the batter didn't crisp enough. Also why even batter it? Tofu fried gets crisp on its own. I thought it was a no fail dish but apparently a big fail.

Tom yung goong- cleared up my sinus but not too spicy. It was good but not great. Needs more lemongrass perhaps and kefir leaf. Other than shrimp, it had bamboo shoots and regular sliced button mushrooms (not straw ones like in most Thai) and no cilantro in it. 

I guess it's hit and miss and the hits are just okay. NW just doesn't seem to have decent Chinese takeout- it's a growing area so fingers crossed for something tasty. Maybe eating in is better. For now, I think I will reserve my Chinese eating for when I am actually in Chinatown area.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,0,0,2,sCXy5rNXrXn8Jv3HcR-XHg
