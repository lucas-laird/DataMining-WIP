This place is really new, so I could tell half of the staff still wasn't really sure what they were doing because they were still being trained on the job. Overall, the staff were very friendly, even though they were slow. 

Lounge burger: I feel like this place's ""inspiration"" is In&Out with the whole thousand island dressing and grilled onions (you can also opt for fresh onions, just like In&Out). I actually thought my $10 burger was pretty good - juicy & flavorful meat, good bun, and just a good combo of everything in it. Felt like they could've melted the cheese a little more, and the burger was a little on the dry side. It was a good size burger, so at least you won't walk away hungry. 

Regular Fries: Again, felt like they were trying to copy In&Out with the whole ""natural fries"" thing. Unfortunately, the fries were not good at all. They were too thick for the whole natural fries scene, and didn't have any flavor at all. 

Chocolate Milkshake: They don't make it until you order it, and you can taste that freshness. The thickness and consistency of the shake was perfect, and it was easy to drink it with a straw. I would definitely try this again.",N-rmSmFsulSrc2BtSAf3-Q,1,0,3,xU6XRkHN780anOsrsSKC9A

My one and ONLY gripe and its a big one for Burger Lounge...THE LACK OF SEATING. Probably at most can sit up to 10-12 people and there is ALWAYS someone rushing to grab the next open seat which makes the experience here kind of uncomfortable. If I do decide to come through to Burger Lounge again I am either going to just take my burger back to my hotel room and sit in the sporting lounge at Planet Hollywood cause its really a struggle to either wait for someone to get up so you can rush to a seat to eat your food or you're already sitting and you visibly see a few people standing and looking directly or indirectly at you waiting for you to finish and get up, so they can sit and have that same experience.

1614899,2016-06-19,1,qKys2eEhVt5A7NUYMn7o7Q,"The last of the restaurants I ate at in the Aria Casino in Las Vegas.

It was my last night in Vegas before flying back home to Hawaii.  If you've ever been to Hawaii, then you know that a good burger restaurant is an oddity.  Don't even give me the Teddy's argument - my reviews on that speak for themselves.  SO, needless to say, I'm always up for a good burger venture.  Yes, I know In-N-Out was right down the road but in Vegas, walking a mile in heels at midnight was not at the top of my list and I was too impatient to wait for a taxi/Uber.

The reviews of this place sounded good so I said hey, why not.  I walked across Aria's gaming floor to the poker area, where I heard Burger Lounge was located.  Easier landmark?  The taxi/valet entrance.

I waited behind a couple, for what seemed like a good bit of time.  One of the managers (I presume, based on the way he presented himself) ushered me to another cashier (who was busy engaging in conversation with another employee).  She seemed startled that I was in front of her, waiting to place my order.  Otherwise, she seemed nice.  I ordered a burger, well-done, with fries and a chocolate shake.  I couldn't wait!!  They give you a little hand-held remote thingy that other restaurants use to alert you when you're table is ready, only this one is for when your order is ready.

I sat at a long table, of which there aren't very many.  Probably in your best interest to get this one to-go.  My order came fairly quickly, and I asked for some extra mayonnaise to-go and they were easy to oblige.  Immediately I tasted my chocolate shake - YUMMMM!  I couldn't wait to get back to my suite to try the rest!!!  The aroma of burger and fries was taunting me from my little paper bag.

Finally made it to my room and sunk my teeth into the juicy burger........ Even though I ordered it well-done, it came to me more of medium.  *see picture*  Because I was so hungry and it was so late, I mustered through it and tried not to think of the blood I was swallowing.

Meh.  Had my burger been cooked to my liking, this place may have been ranked ""up there"".  Customer service was pretty good, location was okay, food was decent.  Will I come back?  Only if I stay at the Aria again.

1652501,2016-07-04,7,qKys2eEhVt5A7NUYMn7o7Q,"MORE BUN THAN BURGER

I've mentioned before that Aria could use a couple more fast and casual dining options, so when I came across Burger Lounge I got excited. I doubt Aria paid attention to what I said, but I'd like to think so.

Burger Lounge is in the location of the former Starbucks knock-off, and I found service to be relatively fast and casual.  However, Aria needs to pay attention to what I have to say about the food.  We ordered burgers and a small side salad.  The burgers are relatively tasty fare (similar in general taste to Fat Burger AS IF IT WERE A KNOCK-OFF), but there is considerably more bun than burger.  I wanted say, ""where's the beef?""

From the small seating area, You can easily see the line cook working the grill.  Pay close attention to his grilling technique.  He puts the meat patty on the grill and pounds it down with a cast iron grill press hand tool so much (and with such force) that it literally flattens the burger into a pancake shape (which we all know causes a loss of the juicy goodness of a burger).  

You can actually see the burger patties splitting/falling apart into pieces on the grill, which is disturbing (considering one of those puzzle piece patties is earmarked for your dining pleasure, all for a tidy fee of $10).  

Burger Lounge is just okay, but because of where you are (deep in the bowels of Aria), it seems like the only game in town.  H-O-W-E-V-E-R, ARIA REGULARS KNOW they can always walk out the main lobby doors a short distance toward the Strip to Bobby's Burger Palace, which has a much beefier burger and and tastes better than the Burger Lounge smashed up burger OR to my favorite Shake Shack.  

Burger Lounge, if you want to be a true winner, you'll need to work on two things, your grilling technique and the size/shape of the patty.

Update (2017) - For sheer walking convenience, I have been back to Burger Lounge a number of times.  I recommend the bacon and egg sandwich, which is served day and night.  It is a tasty option.",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,9,7,2,w3qwEhwGF3oASFyfEftTtw

The girl doesn't even say ""sorry about that"" and goes and gets me a container of corn. No offer to put it inside my salad container or toss it. When I received it I said ""I would've expected a sorry since I did have to walk all the way back here"" to which instead of saying it, she says you can talk to the manager (who was lounging in her jacket behind her). I said to the manager I would've expected an apology since an item was missed, and I made the walk down, and she goes ""I didn't hear what you were here about."" Basically made a small thing into something way more annoying because of their terrible service.

 I ordered the classic and it was mind blowing. It has a very tender and juicy taste unlike the burgers that you would obtain at in n out or even red Robin. The fries and onion rings are also cooked well.  

 When receiving your order, you get the burger and the fries/ onion rings placed neatly in a tiny square box. I feel that they give you a generous portion of food. The service was okay, not great.

 The only issue I could point out is the tables given for customers to enjoy their food. You sit next to strangers and it is too close for comfort. I would highly recommend to order take out because it would be more convenient for you.

We've tried all the Burger Lounge locations in San Diego and this particular location just doesn't compare. This was nowhere near as good in quality or service as the SD locations. 
They don't have barbecue sauce (which is one of the reasons we go), the ranch tasted like mayo (didn't taste ""homemade""), the fries were not crispy or well seasoned, and the burgers..well.. 
They also don't take gift cards (another reason we went).
Seating is limited. We ended up having to sit at a table with complete strangers and could barely move. They have Coke beverages but even that wasn't good because it tasted too watered down. Sigh...

First off, the seating can hold maybe just 20 people at most.
They don't carry the cool specialty drinks that Burger Lounge is popular for. My wife really enjoys and looks forward to ginger beer soda and they didn't have it.
Also the chocolate shake wasn't working...granted that can happen anywhere, but it just added insult to injury cuz that's what I look forward to the most.
When you wait for your food to be prepared they give you a buzzer. When the buzzer hadn't gone off in 15 minutes I checked on the status of the food. It had been sitting out for a good while cuz it was all luke warm and therefore not that tasty. 
We then got a vanilla shake. When the shake was made it was also sitting out and we decided to see if the separate buzzer would go off for that. But it didn't. So when we asked why, they just said with attitude that they don't work, and that that's just how it happens.

The grilled onions are a little greasy, but so tasty. 

Burger Lounge serves breakfast all day--try the country-fried steak sandwich with gruyere, tomato jam, and an egg. Hearty and flavorful. 

Do not miss the cheddar tater tots...ridiculously good. They're house made with cheese inside, not your standard tots drenched in cheese. Tons of flavor, nice and crispy on the outside, cheesy and melty on the inside. Only way to make them better is to dunk them in the Lounge's delicious ranch dressing!

They've got some organic lemonade and iced tea...I'm surprised they offer conventional sodas and not cane sugar options.

The girl and I came over today and heard this place had just opened and decided to give it a shot.  I ordered a classic burger and fries as did the girl.  I typically do a special order as I'm not a huge fan of cheese but that seemed to offend the lady taking the order.  I'm very sorry that your cheese is organic and fair trade and everything - but I'd prefer if you just leave it on the side if that's okay. Five minutes of struggling through up-sells of half and half fries and onion rings, mexi-cola, and are sure you don't want our great cheese on your grass-fed burger...and buzzer in hand we sat down at one of the six tables.

Don't get me wrong.  The food was good.  The patty was cooked nice, and it was as flavorful as it had been suggested to me. It just wasn't a $10 burger.  The taste and consistency was almost the same as Smashburger's - minus a bit of butter - for double the price.  

Overall it's a good joint. The price just isn't right for the product.  Save yourself a bit and walk to The Park at grab some shake shack. Or if you have a car there's a Smashburger at the south outlets.

Patty is grilled super thin. It works.

Fries: Delicious! Great with their ranch. Large is actually super filling. Small could do you.

Onion rings: OMG! I don't usually like bread crumb type onion rings but these changed my mind real quick. I am craving them right now. Perfect outside crisp to inside softness ratio.

4048594,2016-12-21,5,qKys2eEhVt5A7NUYMn7o7Q,"Excited to finally being able to try Burger Lounge after hearing countless praises about this place! It's a fast and casual restaurant. Once you order your meal, you will receive a buzzer and wait to pick up your meal. They have a small menu but they offer the basics of what you would want/need/expect at a burger spot- burger, sides, and milkshakes. 

I was able to try their lounge burger with a side of fries and a root beer float. The burger itself was too oily for my personal preference. The bottom bun was literally dripping out oil. I thought that was normal until I noticed that other people's burgers were not doing the same thing. Their fries were great! They were crispy and well-seasoned. The root beer float was enjoyable and was refreshing!

The food is a bit pricey for what you're getting. It's in the same price range as Bobby's Burger Palace (located right next door) but at BL, you don't get as much variety on the menu or in the burger. 

Seating is limited so if it is crowded, I suggest taking your food to-go. Burger Lounge is located by Aria's hotel exits, so there are plenty of seats outside where you can enjoy your meal and sightsee at the same time! I probably won't be coming back for the burgers but probably more for the convenience.",uS2rQ9oyAJ1nOMbL0YL2lg,7,5,2,c2Ihb3rt5hUFdohQ4cFRLg

I had chances to go, but was swayed by either a friend's bad review of the place or because there's so many other options in Daygo.  Since then, Burger Lounge has expanded throughout the 619.  As they got bigger, I heard that the quality of their burgers got worse.  Let me see for myself. 

Burger Lounge is now in Las Vegas inside the Aria and conveniently located next to the poker room.  The location is small and can be easily missed if you're not paying attention.  The menu consist of burgers, a turkey burger, a veggie burger, 2 types of breakfast sandwiches, and salad (but who has time for that?).  Sides include fries and onion rings. Burger Lounge also has floats and shakes for dessert.  I got the Double Classic (double grass-fed beef and cheese).  You know how in some places you can't tell the difference between a regular burger and a burger that comes from grass-fed cows.  Here, I can taste the difference.  The burgers are fresh, juicy, and very tasty. The quality that you get here also comes with a hefty price.  3 burgers (one was a double), two sides, and one drink cost us about $75.  In my opinion, that's a little steep considering that the size of the burgers are a little small.  But you pay for quality, right? Overall, I'm a fan of the taste of their burgers. I'm just not a huge fan of the value.

Unfortunately, this is not the same Burger Lounge that we know and love. First of all, they wouldn't take our gift card that we had so that sucked. They said because they are a franchise. Sorry, but for a customer how you do the money on the back end shouldn't matter. Second, they have a more limited menu. I like the little lounge burger but there was no such thing. Also, no salad with chicken. Third, the quality just wasn't as good. The burger just didn't have the same craveable, juicy goodness like the burgers in San Diego. It was just...okay.

You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer to notify you when your order is ready. It's a small joint with around 4 round tables, which seats 4 and a community table, which seats about 8-10. 
The burger consisted of grilled or fresh onions, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and house made 1000 Isle dressing. The fries were seasoned with salt & parsley with a side of organic ketchup & ranch. 
I loved that their burgers are homemade. It is also very rare to find veggie burgers made with quinoa as most restaurants offer a black bean version, so this was a nice surprise. I ordered mine without cheese and dressing and it was still delicious and full of flavor. The $9.95 price was worth it. I've paid more for a burger and have gotten less. 
My only cons about this establishment is their lack of ample seating for the amount of people that were there at the time looking and waiting for an open spot.
They also have a small open kitchen to the left of the order counter where the upper half of the walls are made of glass. It looked a little claustrophobic for my liking & I can only imagine how the 5 or 6 workers must've felt cramped in that little space.

After contemplating whether I should order room service at Aria I tested the system and it ended up being well over $50 by the time I order food and a drink and the fees. I noticed they offered order and pickup option at this joint. This was much more reasonable in price and grass fed beef is the way to go when ordering a burger. I ordered a basic cheeseburger with combo fries and onion rings and a drink through the tablet in my room. Within two minutes they called to confirm my order and told me I could pick it up in 10 minutes. I walked downstairs to the main floor to pick it up and it was all ready to go and they opened my drink for me too. 

They load you up with fries and onion rings. The fries were good, but I loved the onion rings. They were dark golden brown and nice and crunchy taste with onions still perfect in the middle.

I ordered the Lounge burger, salad, and lavender lemonade (which was heavenly). Despite the heartbreak I encountered when I was told they didn't have cod for the fish sandwich, they made a huge comeback with the burger. You can smell the fresh quality of the beef. Not going to lie, I did eat like a pig and had some of the sauce and grease drip down my hands and wrists, but it was well worth it. It didn't have as much meat as I'd hope, but it was still delicious. The smell wouldn't come off even after I washed my hands--a true sign it was a damn tasty meal. Stealing some of my boyfriend's vanilla shake, I would also highly recommend getting one of those babies. It's thick, creamy, silky, with natural vanilla beans that makes you feel content and cool while dealing with the insane Las Vegas heat.

5097917,2017-02-24,5,qKys2eEhVt5A7NUYMn7o7Q,"I'm coming around to the fact that new burger joints are finding reasons to convince customers to spend over $20 each visit.  This place qualifies into the category, as their pitch is ""the original grass fed burgers"".

First of all, I ordered the original double burger with avocado add on and small fries (no drink) and the total was over $22 (would be around $26 with drink).  Holy cow Batman, that's some serious inflation.  Good thing that I have my poker comps from the Aria to cover the meal.

This is a real burger and it's a generous portion to satisfy most appetites, some reviews mentions that it's too greasy but it's just right to me.  The bottom bun doesn't come out that soggy which is good but at the end of the meal, your hands get really messy.  I don't detect any fillers or excessive salt or other flavorings as I'm not excessively thirsty with other lower end burger joints.  I would pass on the avocado add on, as the burger drowns out and overpowers this and had to remind myself that I spend over $2 for this add-on.  The bacon add on is more advisable to choose instead.

The fries are ok, not soft or too crispy, it's a lot more starchy then the other places.  The portion is on the smaller side.

Is it worth it?  I don't really know, as it would depend on what you are willing to pay.  It's definitely better than the typical fast food joints but at 3x the cost or in other words 3x better.. that is questionable.",tw1YfWwGJffPlUNTl_w1fw,6,4,3,B8OQsQ5nT580sK5I938pVQ

I stepped up 100 feet away from the register to read the menu of what i wanted. She was so impatient she kept saying I can help you. I said I'm looking for a second. thanks. 
I stepped up she walked away. the other girl who was sweet and nice took my order, I got the crispy chicken sand wich and onion rings to go. The other girl who is African American the rude one took over butted in while the other girl was helping me. Anyways. long story short. she is a Bitch,and unsanitary never ever once washed her hands or put gloves on and grabbing food. I approached the counter with a loud firm voice,and said if this is mine do not touch it. she freaked out. I said um you can ask your manager to get it for me. so the cook i guess is the manager put gloves on and put it in the bag for me. but before my order she already touched someone else fries,and was grabbing there food with no gloves on and put it in the bag. If you go I suggest you pay attention to the cashiers actions before properly handling your food. 
I also hope she gets written up!!!!",anwmW5m3Q_ZvDK50-RMGbw,0,0,2,91NC27pjG98hTAu0lm8A7Q

Now on to the burger itself, was a little dry so that was disappointing, I later found sauce in my bag , which probably would have helped, didn't notice till I was through . Fries again were just ok, I guess no ones going to compete with homemade fries fresh , just saying! Overall I would return, definitely pricey!",rsWhPMvPDAEO82jn9wjmsg,0,0,4,y4oJ-y6LFy3Q54eogIvgCA
5593873,2017-05-09,2,qKys2eEhVt5A7NUYMn7o7Q,"Had a surprisingly good in-between lunch and late dinner meal here one weekend. We were walking around Aria looking for a quick but decent bite of food. We passed Burger Lounge and kept walking but decided to come back to it. I'm sure glad we did. It's cooked to order quick meals but the quality was very good. The flavors were great. I ordered The Classic ($9.95) which is a single burger patty with organic american cheese, organic ketchup, chopped onions, mustard & pickles usually. I asked for no mustard, no pickles but added applewood smoked bacon. This burger was delicious. Not just cause we were hungry but it really was of a great quality and taste. I really liked the melted american and bacon to top this burger off. The bread was good as it was toasted on the flat top but still soft to the touch. I would get this again for sure whenever inside Aria. 

Also ordered was the fresh vegetable salad ($10.95). It came with romaine lettuce, spinach, tomato, corn, carrot, cucumbers, red onion and daikon with a lemon basil vinaigrette. It was a big salad. We also ordered a 1/2 and 1/2 which is a good for two people onion rings and fries appetizer. Good fries and really good onion rings. 

Service at the counter was friendly. Seat yourself, as there is a dedicated dining area, patio-style for Burger Lounge patrons. Located at the far end of Aria near the exit to Monorail and walkway to the Mandarin Oriental. Open til Midnight.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,3,4,4,BFDX8pgyguvs8I-naS3pIw

I'm a huge fan of organic offerings, which can be difficult to come by, particularly on the strip. This place offers free-range beef and chicken, and organic salads. I ordered the Lounge burger and housemade lavender lemonade. Both delicious. The best part to me was the customer service. I'm a fan of the buzzer system which lets you know when the order is ready. Unfortunately, after I placed my order, I got caught up in the blackjack room and didn't return til 11:00pm. They close at 11:00. So it's 11:01 and they are closing up shop, told me they got rid of my order since it had been sitting out. Then they offered to make me a new one. Literally they're closed and went out of their way to use the grill past closing time to fulfill my order, all with a friendly and professional attitude. I was touched.

Hubby had the chicken sandwich and he said it didn't have any flavor, so he wasn't happy until I let him have some of my burger. I told him for the price he should take it back but he didn't want to be that guy so he suffered in silence while I enjoyed my burger. We got the 1/2 & 1/2 of fries and onion rings. The onion rings were good but I would definitely only do the French fries next time as they were really good. They gave us samples of the lavender mint drink . It sounds cute but it was pretty gross. Ended up getting the root beer float which was nice but just too much with the meal. I would get it again to have by itself while on the casino floor as it can stand on its own. 
I want to try the cheesy tators next. Yes, I'll be back to visit burger lounge before we leave Vegas. You should visit also. Just avoid the chicken, it's a burger joint.",HDQKW7LPzKeTLGoJ4PtozQ,0,0,4,mISOJaGkjq0MZCNHsbNUJg

Now I do appreciate the burger was grass fed and understand it is expensive to run a business in the Aria. The coke alone was about $6.  Two burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 coke came to $30 or so.  The rating reflects the price for one.  The other issue is one employee was drinking a beverage while working.

One of my biggest issues with Vegas is you pay a hefty amount for mediocre food or you pay a ton for good food. It's not Portland where you can literally drive almost anywhere and find a delicious food cart meal for $9. 

Burger Lounge is the solution. Granted, it's not the best burger of your life, but it's decent and affordable and ready pretty quickly and the line probably isn't too long. Not only that, but the $11 dollar salad? That thing is dope. Where else are you going to find a healthy, quickly-made, affordable meal on the strip for $11. Please let me know, cause I really think Burger Lounge might be one of the only places around.

Also, their Arnold Palmer is delicious and refreshing. Free refills!",iWpQOw985MfgiREacq3ItA,1,1,5,pYCpT4_bXN_pt5KVv6ZC9Q

I'm a creature of habit and I always order the same thing, a turkey burger with avocado and I make my boyfriend share fries with me. You cannot come here and not have the fries, they're habit forming and oh so delicious. Every location has the friendliest people and the quality is always the same. I don't eat red meat so I can't comment on it personally, but my niece devours her burger whenever I take her so one would assume they're phenomenal as well. I've also heard that the onion rings are amazing, but I've never been able to actually try them since I'm always so full from my burger and fries. I genuinely make everyone come here to eat since I am such a fan, and I have yet to hear a complaint from anyone.

With the food, my burger's patty was flattened out and was hanging outside of the bun.  I'm not a big fan of this since it serves no purpose other than making it look bigger than it really is.  The burger was alright but nothing mind blowing but for the price it wasn't too bad considering how expensive other places are.

Overall, probably a good place to grab a late night drunken meal at since they are open late during the weekend.",VxvFf0NeKk5lT-4Wdp9qkw,0,0,3,doNhOPTgCet0Xs0RZelQjA
