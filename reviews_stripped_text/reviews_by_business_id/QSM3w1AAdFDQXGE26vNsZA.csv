43087,2016-03-17,0,QSM3w1AAdFDQXGE26vNsZA,"I ordered the garlic knot pizza with about 6 or 7 toppings along with one of the brownie desserts about a week ago, & when it arrived, it was not what i had ordered online. Ordering online makes it very specific, i would think. My pizza should have been double checked before leaving the store. The reason it was an issue is because my sister has dietary restriction that does not agree with what i ordered on my half of the pizza. Not only was it missing the extra BBQ drizzle sauce, but at least 3 of the 6 or 7 toppings were missing as well. We were not very happy about that. I called to discuss the issue and they told me they would replace my pizza free of change, no problem..  I called this evening to reorder my garlic knot pizza, & i spoke with Devon. He was VERY polite, & assisted me in replacing my pizza. I even changed the toppings. I thought I'd ask about the possibility of having the brownies replaced as well because i love dessert after dinner, & he made it happen with no issue at all. He confirmed my contact information in the system, & told me it would all be taken care of. . My pizza just arrived. Hot, & just the way i ordered it. & thankfully, the chocolaty,warm brownies are here as well. I am very happy with the service i have recieved, given the fact that this is quick eats. Thank you Devon! & thank you Pizza Hut!",-M_J92bkyGwmuLzuQ8wObA,0,0,5,Ma1xT4tvRCkRGbNFuaQTJQ
359535,2015-10-28,1,QSM3w1AAdFDQXGE26vNsZA,"Why did I give this Pizza Hut 5 stars? 

1) First and foremost, consistently friendly staff. Sad to say, but nowadays this sticks out. I lost count on how many times I have left an establishment and said ""thank you"" to utter silence (Hint: It should be the other way around) Half the time when I thank a server these days, their response is ""yep.""  Not ""you're welcome"" but ""yep."" The staff at this location has always been engaged and polite. 

2) Pizza is consistently great. 

That's enough to warrant five stars in my book.",lIeTkArfBdFByShcU7zXAA,1,1,5,l1jNORk2Y5rciuiDlZ7VLA

A call to the manager got us two more pizzas in about 70 minuted.

I did request a free two-liter cola for our trouble, as we had guests. There are many pizza shops in this area, and I believe one of them  (we'll find it eventually) will earn our business.

966456,2016-01-29,0,QSM3w1AAdFDQXGE26vNsZA,"Ordered a pizza by phone for pickup on a visit to Vegas to visit family. Order was to be ready at 5:36 pm.. I arrived at 5:32 pm and paid for the pizza. I sat down to wait. And waited. And waited. About 15 minutes into the wait, the register area was packed with people who were still waiting for very late orders. A young woman came from the back, hysterical, yelling at the cashier, ""I made them all! I made them! I just don't know where they are!"" 

Hilarity ensued and I got my pizza 19 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Of course, it was cold by the time I got it back to my family's house 6 minutes away. 

I called the restaurant and, after a wait on hold, asked to speak to the manager. ""Brett"" said he would need an explanation of what I needed to talk about before he could put me through to the manager. I persuaded him to get the manager, a ""CSR"" whose name, I believe, was Sandy. She explained, ""I was one of the people back there trying to help find the pizzas and it was just really confusing."" I declined to discuss excuses with the ""CSR"". She said that the next time I came in, she would give me a credit. Given that I live near Philadelphia, that was obviously not a great idea. She told me she could give me the owner's email address and I could tell him what happened. She then put me on hold for another 8 minutes. Then she came back to the phone, telling me ""I haven't forgotten about you. I'm just trying to get all the details right. I have to put you back on hold.""

Last I went to this pizza hit, they screwed up my order so they told me that they would credit the $16 to my Pizza Hut online account..... today I check my account and find that I actually have NOT been reimbursed or credited for that day. I mean I'm not trying to get money back or whine about $16 but if you're going to tell your customers that they're going to reimburse your account .... I think they should???? I never even asked for a refund, they TOLD ME THEY WOULD refund me and credit it to my account. And now I'm sitting here with no credit and never coming to this Pizza Hut again. I don't even care that they are across the street. I'll drive to a better location... where they'll get my order right and then follow through with promises of a refund... such an annoying thing to deal with when companies can't even pull through on their end. 

********











Upon arriving, I had to wait 10 minutes while the cashier was on the phone with another customer. Understandable and not her fault, but other employees should be able to assist carry out orders while she is taking phone calls. However, Cylie, when she got off the phone was very polite and apologetic. I was really annoyed at first but I'm so happy she handled it correctly and professionally because it completely turned my experience around. Another downfall.... my order was incorrect. The person who took my order was male. He apparently input my order as ""pizza and breadsticks"" and failed to put it in as ""pizza, breadsticks, and cinnamon sticks"" AKA the dinner box. So Cylie got the cinnamon sticks ready for me, told me it would be a slight wait, which was alright with me since it's a weekend & im just hanging out with my son not doing much. 

Not the best branch but the cashier really made my experience a lot better when it could've been the worst experience ever. Granted, my order was wrong and I had to wait a long time but customer service is a huge thing for me... so I am appreciative!",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,0,0,1,mTcorgLngtDis0QzKICrbA

I find that not only extremely rude to tell me - but pointless, quite frankly I don't care - I paid money for dinner for my family and we received something inedible. He asked if I would just like a regular pizza. Seeing how I ordered a specific item and that item cost more - I'd like what I ordered, simply to be cooked. He said they would remake it and send it out for delivery immediately. Awesome. Thank you. Once the remake was delivered, the driver acted flabbergasted I wasn't tipping again. I'm sorry..

Another guy came in to pick up his order and was told 20 people were still ahead of him with no time frame of when his food would be done and she completely could not have cared less that it was supposed to be done. Staff does not wear food handler gloves. They eat while they work and scream profanities while the customers are coming in and out. There were no less than 50 dirty disgusting pans stacked up that were falling all on the floor while they stood around in a group of about 5 guys just laughing at the one that actually picked up the mess. This place is gross and i wish i would have found this out earlier. They lost 2 customers in the span of about 5 minutes. Great job! Not.",udYHU-SQRrY8fhBAbcQNEg,0,0,1,DP5ROqHQuNOK-ScfpN3dSA

Ordered a supreme and they cheated us on the toppings. I don't think we will be ordering from this Pizza Hut again . The last time we ordered from this Pizza Hut they didn't cut our pizza.

So the Mrs. placed an online order. The process was easy. Instead of delivery, we decided to have it picked up. Called into the location and told them I wanted to come in myself. After giving me and my wifes name the order was found, ( wow not organized at all ) . ""Yes you can pick it up."" Mind you, the new order total at the time with delivery charge is $19 and some change. 

1830 I showed up to pick up. What do you know, couldn't find me again, so I looked up the confirmation. Yup there I am, and guess what, the driver is on his way to deliver the order.

WOW REALLY?!!

So I waited for him to come back. ""It's Sunday, so stay calm Mikey."" So the driver comes back and I'm shown my ordered pizzas. Ok they're good. Time to pay.  $32 and some change is the total. !!!!!WHAAAT!!!!? Ok explain. ""Well the previous total was for delivery only. Since it was changed to pick up, the deal does not apply."" GEEEZ!! RAAAAGE!!! PEE OWED!! is whats going on inside of me, but in the outside, ""So then thats it?"" Yup pretty much. All I got was a ""I'm sorry that happened."" When all they had to do was honor it. You couldn't find the order, you had me wait for your driver, and you upcharge me for coming myself to pick it up?!! REALLY!!!?? .. You know what, I'll cook. 

There's a reason why your customers are not happy or satisfied with you guys. Check the reviews. Pay a freakin attention. 

Waste of time. There's a Domino's down the street, or even Rossotis. It's bad enough I saw one of your cooks dropping food in the back kitchen area. Yes, the one with the bangs hanging from the front of his hat. Dropped a chicken wing while putting it in the order basket. Ask him what he did with it.

5193089,2015-06-11,1,QSM3w1AAdFDQXGE26vNsZA,"My first experience with this location was about 3 weeks ago upon moving into our new home. My family needed something quick so we ordered a 24 piece hot wings and was advised it would be ready in 20 mins. When my husband showed up 18 mins later to pick up our order he was advised they had given our order away. He waited another 20 mins for them to make him another batch while asking to be compensated for their error for which they tried to give him a free soda after they JUST rang him up for 2 when he paid for the wings. After his wait they handed him his wings and we went home only to find out we were shorted HALF our wings. I called back up to Pizza Hut to speak with the manager. She explained my original order was never given away yet it was never made in the first place, she apologized for my short order, and offered to make me a whole new batch on the house. At that point I felt this location gained their stars back until today... 

Today we ordered yet another 24 piece wings and was given a 20 min wait. My husband goes to pick up order and was advised wings were never even made yet again for some odd reason. So the wait begins. He's given a $5 off next visit like others have mentioned. He's given his wings and this time hubby checks his wing count BEFORE he leaves and yet again he's short. The guy in the back laughs, says, ""oh really?"" and then picks up another container listed ""naked,"" adds sauce to them and hands them to my husband all while the guy next to him is paying for his ""naked"" requested wings. It makes me wonder how many people they short change on the wings that don't really complain. Let's be honest, if you short 8-12 wings off a 24 piece order, that's bold! I can only imagine what ordering a pizza would be like. And if people hate the service just that much, who cares how many $5 off your next order coupons you dish you because they won't be returning anyway!!!

So upset with my experience on 6/19/16. Ordered a $10 dinner box at 5:27 and expected delivery was 60-1hr 10mins. Would've been fine but we heard the delivery car pull up to our house. Saw the car from our upstairs window and went down to the door to open it. My boyfriend saw the delivery driver NOT even get out of the car, and just pull away from the house. NO EXPLANATION AT ALL. He just left! What the hell!!!! 

We did call the store right away, and was on hold for 10 mins before hanging up. Tried again a couple minutes later and someone had told us that because of the game, it would be ANOTHER 1-2hrs. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Your delivery driver was in my drive way. HE DIDNT GET OUT OF THE CAR. I cannot believe the horrible customer service. You think people would be more informative with answers rather than not apologizing and saying our order would take another couple hours when it was literally right out front of the door 10 mins ago.",TOAVvNSWRS7elQquFQuMVw,1,0,1,HcWAwHr3coaYglUDRFx_Zw

The ingredients are so low quality I would rather eat my DOGS FOOD. It was DISGUSTING.

Also, the pizza's were barely warm by the time they arrived and they could have been cooked a little longer.  I asked for extra mushrooms and I think there were a total of 5 on the whole pizza.

I always order online so there are no arguments or excuses on their end other than simply making it incorrectly. Tonight was no different. They do always give you a ""credit"" for screwing up your order and then send someone with the correct item. They did not give me cheese breadsticks when they charged extra for it so I called and let them know. They gave me a $10 credit then applied it towards new breadsticks, even though I already paid for and did not receive them. However, I waited an extra hour for cheese breadsticks tonight and they're over cooked with very little cheese plus THEY ARE COLD. Pretty disappointing for a pregnant woman who's wanted nothing but cheese breadsticks for two days.
