His request is to take out at Panda and stay in to eat at the hotel while mommy and daddy have a date night and to gamble. Lol yay for us. Did some research and found a Panda right next to where we were gonna be at. A bit hard to find bc it was hidden in a small shopping center 2nd floor and even my local friend had a hard time finding it. But there's a small food court in the small strip mall by MGM and M&M World and this was there. Ordered about 4 combos to go. They had our usual of chow mein, Orange chicken, beef broccoli, fried rice and teriyaki chicken. Pricier than the usual Panda bc of location. But heard it was still good and fresh after taking out to eat at the hotel.

- Service was ok, you can tell the people behind the counter hate their jobs. 
- The Chow Mein was really cold..... thank buddha for white rice. 
- And they didn't have chopsticks, or they didn't understand me.....

DECOR
minus 4 stars for no real pandas...not. Cmon. Panda Express one star? You must eat lobster every day. I ate lobster twice last week but I'm still not a douche.

3206091,2015-07-15,1,iNdMl5rb4FKFFgmzimuzvQ,"Returning to the U.S. this year, but this time spending a week in Las Vegas, I was looking forward to revisiting one of the many Panda Express restaurants on The a Strip. So after a 10,5 hour flight from the UK, checkin, relaxing by the pool, and short exploration of some of the other hotels on The Strip, like Aria, I was ready for some Chinese takeaway! From my visit to Florida, I am a big fan of Panda Express, especially their Orange Chicken, and after such a long and busy day, all
I wanted was a good old fashioned takeaway. 

Close to our hotel (MGM Grand) was a Food Court at Showcase Mall with several food outlets like Wendy's, Subway, Del Taco and of course, PANDA EXPRESS. Ordering a Plate, which consists of two entrees and a side, I could only think about having Chow Mein Noodles with Orange Chicken and Sweetfire Chicken Breast. It was incredible. Everything I had been craving for! Delicious! Of course I shared the dish with my girlfriend, and after such a day, it was the perfect food to end it with.

The food gets FIVE stars without a doubt, but the food court itself wasn't the best location and it smelled like dirty water. Next time, I will just get the food to takeaway, or visit another Panda Express in one of the nearby locations.

So, once my boyfriend and I walked in here, it was at least 100 degrees in the food court! We made the mistake by staying.. We ordered our food and sat down. After about maybe 7 minutes of sitting there, I had to get up and ask the lady for a box, because it was extremely hot in the food court.. It's sad how I was just stopping for lunch before I continued my shopping on the same side of the road on the strip! I had to walk across the street to my hotel room to eat my meal. She said after it rained, it just got really hot in there. My ice in my drink, was pretty much all melted. I asked her for a refill, and tried charging me! Don't charge me for a drink I bought 7 minutes ago, and it's ice is melted already... Lol 53 cents for a refill after spending almost around $20 for two people to eat there, when my food wasn't even hot, and was a little soggy from the heat inside the court.. All of the other restaurants inside the food court had free refills, I believe...

The folks who waited on my were young and not overly friendly. That said, I have to give some leeway because I was there in the midst of the lunch crowd, and they had to be overwhelmed with customers. My biggest complaint was that my soda was flat, and my food was only lukewarm. It would have been nice to have a nice fizzy soda and hot food. I ordered a sweet and sour chicken, and I just wasn't impressed with the food quality or temperature.

3855636,2009-09-12,0,iNdMl5rb4FKFFgmzimuzvQ,"Going to Vegas, the last place I would be expecting to dine at would be the Panda Express in some random shopping center off the strip. I hardly ever walk to anywhere, but since I had to walk this instance after doing a lot of drinking, I had to get a bite to eat at this Panda Express.

You can walk to this Panda from MGM, and it would take you no more then 15 minutes. The things I would probably look out for on the way there are the porn handlers, and drunk dudes that like to get frisky. 

Once you get to this location, its almost impossible to find seating. Since there are multiple fast food joints at this food court, all of the tables are almost always taken. An Indian family was nice enough to let us take a corner of their table to dine. 

As far as service goes.. there is no service at this Panda. Imagine having to deal with strip traffic day and night. All of the people working there resort to being your high school lunch lady. Rice or Chow Mein? *slaps one scoop on your plate and keep on moving*

They won't even let you pay ahead of someone that was dining in. I ordered my order to go and about 99% of the time at other Panda Expresses, they would let me pay right away. Nope, not at this one. They need to make sure you get the full high school cafeteria experience. 

Come here if you don't have a car, hurting for food..and this is a last resort. Otherwise there are plenty of better Pandas, or other options out there.",nTcMFBHZV2vPnig0XLk-Hw,3,0,2,LtoebMP-9OT_MgoYkfyO1w

But I came here one drunken night with other drunks to sober up and we saw some guy dressed like a wrestler with a WWE championship belt, which is cool.  You probably won't see this dude at other Panda Express stores.  

I tried the new Orange Chicken with Bacon which was really good and the new Chicken Breast w/Kale.  They might as well calla it, Chicken Breast w/Broccoli and Kale because I had more broccoli than kale.  You can ask for less broccoli when they serve you but just take it off it altogether.

4285419,2011-02-10,1,iNdMl5rb4FKFFgmzimuzvQ,"As far as Panda Express' go, this one ranks near the bottom. As a plus, they're open 24 hours a day, so this is an ideal spot for a 3 a.m. meal when you're in a drunken stupor. The downside is that, unless you get REALLY lucky and walk up right as they're putting down some fresh food, chances are you'll wind up eating something that looks (and tastes) like it was made hours ago. Panda can be tasty quick Chinese food when it's fresh & hot, but after it's been sitting for a couple of hours it starts to practically decompose, leaving you with a plate full of nasty crap. I couldn't tell you a good time to stop in to this one, but at least it's located in a food court with a few other places that'll do if this isn't looking up to snuff.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,3,2,2,0ur8wCfzRuMXidxxwDXSdA

You can get pizza, Subway, Del Taco, hot dogs, or Panda Express.  The Panda Express on someone else's plate looked good so we went with that.

Panda Express is like any other Panda Express establishment but this reminded me somewhat of a military boot camp cafeteria.  I asked for the half chow mein, half fried rice with black pepper chicken and the guy behind the counter repeated my order twice scooped it out fast, tossed it down and yelled ""next!"" He gave me steamed rice instead of fried rice and by the time I went to correct it he had an angry look on his face and was trying to move the line along so I decided to stay with my rice.

They had a promo at this location.  If you got the monster drink, you also get these sugared wonton crisps.  We went for it but the drink was too much to handle considering I only drink enough to cover my meal.  The meal itself was ok.  I guess the black pepper chicken is considered healthy and listed on their ""smart wok"" menu.
