215735,2017-04-01,1,6W3hdaCjx_n1kADEuORduA,If you want to do something really crazy go here at night. You're going to be going down a dark Road the last 5 miles and then you'll turn on to Bonnie Springs Ranch Road and it's even darker for the last two miles. There will only be a few cars in the parking lot and the restaurants off to the left about a hundred yards. It is really something out of the past the food's good just plain bar food they do have fried livers and gizzards you definitely have to try that one time and the gizzards really just one time.  Open till 9 on weekdays a little later on weekends. Definitely check out the men's room even if you're a woman.

However, what truly brought us back as weekend regulars for the last year was the AMAZING bartender, Isaac!  He is truly one of the nicest, courteous, and most professional bartenders we have ever had the pleasure to meet, his customer service and friendly attitude is why we always come back!  After a long work week, we intentionally make sure to carve out time to ride out and catch the game on TV, eat, relax and enjoy the atmosphere, but only when Isaac is working!  It is impressive to watch one person skillfully wait on and take care of so many folks especially when the place is slammed and do so with a great attitude.  He always remembers patrons that come back, he knows what you like to drink and like to eat and you can tell that he wants you to enjoy your time at the Springs and want to keep coming back.  This establishment should truly be enjoyed by those that aren't in a rush, it's ""Solid Country Gold,"" so put on your kickers, sit back, relax and relish in that Las Vegas still has a non-franchised, homey and timeless restaurant/bar with   traditions.",QYxh3cPPhkcUiZ2SYpX3-A,0,0,5,OcNxyBTnIOS9k0Ohxdt0Mw

How have I never been here before and it's only 15 mins from our home?

Just outside of Red Rock Canyon is this gem! Bonnie Springs Ranch has all sorts of fun things to check out including this rustic and super cozy restaurant. It felt as if you were very far from Vegas but it's right in our backyard and the moment you walked in you can feel the warm fire. On a cold day there's nothing better! 

There's a fun bar with signed bills all around it that are left by visitors from all over the world and we left ours as well. The large fire place is in between the bar & dining area and it really added the perfect touch to our evening. 

The menu is classic American from steaks, seafood and all sorts of sandwiches. We didn't come in very hungry so we split the Bonnie Springs burger and a house salad. The salad was delicious and it was topped with garbanzo beans, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes (ranch on the side). Our burger was so juicy and it came with Swiss cheese and bacon. It was served on sourdough bread that was toasted with butter! The fries were a perfect side! Everything was so damn tasty! 

The service was excellent and our waitress was friendly & attentive. Everything about our experience was perfection and I cannot wait to come back! Come in for dinner or just a drink and enjoy the fireplace that is surrounded by comfy chairs. Also take the time to walk the grounds if you're here during the day and you'll see all sorts of animals such as ducks, peacocks and roosters who are all lucky enough to call this place home.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,42,43,5,Z2Ss5GPOMME4FBUqkzNDLQ

There's a large lake out front with several ducks, turtles, peacocks, and chickens roaming around. Inside, there's a bar area and an indoor fireplace to enjoy in addition to the usual two- and four-top seating. It's dark with themed decor and animal heads overlooking the tables. I dig it.

Food menu has everything from breakfast to barbecue to burgers and meatloaf. They have no nearby competition and materials have to be trucked in, so prices are on the high side but not unreasonable. We shared some apps instead of getting full meals: the chicken livers and gizzards come freshly fried with a great cream gravy, and the Western Style Chili Bowl (with beans) is huge and just a touch spicy.

I can't say this spot is appealing enough on it's own to warrant the drive outside of town, but it sure beats a picnic. Coupled with the other Bonnie Springs attractions, it makes for a fun, adventurous day for kids or adults.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,17,4,stOwgb7DFNuwUqM6f1J91g

But one thing that I did like was the wood burning fireplace in the winter. We went there about a week ago for some hot chocolate and dessert. Unfortunately Olivia P. was our server. It was freezing outside and we noticed the fireplace was not on. We asked Olivia if someone could start it and were given several excuses...the first being she said it has to be extremely cold out (the temp was about 40 degress and people were bundled up in their winter clothes), then she said they only put it on in the evening (this was at 2:00pm and we've been there before when the fireplace has been on in the morning), then Olivia told us that they import the wood which is expensive. ???  There were no beverage prices on their menu so we asked how much hot chocolates were and Olivia replied with "" I don't know...maybe around $2 something"". As a server they should NEVER ever say I don't know...as a waitreess I would think they'd know prices. We asked for our drinks and dessert to be delivered at the same time. She brought our drinks and we waited and waited for the pie. By the time she brought the tiniest piece of pie I've ever seen, we were done with our hot chocolate as if we waited our hot chocolate would have been chocolate cold milk. We reiterated that we wanted these items to be enjoyed together so we declined the pie. A good server would have apologized and offered complimentary refills, BUT NO. By now it's 2:30pm and we saw some bikers come in. they asked for the fireplace to be on...and guess what...they put it on for them!!, yet it was not ""evening time"" , it was the same tempurature and the wood was from the same ""imported pile"" that could've been used for us. What horrible horrible service, or lack thereof. This one single experience is enough for me not to return.

2318470,2017-11-19,0,6W3hdaCjx_n1kADEuORduA,"Complete disappointment. When I go out to eat and spend extra money on food, I expect it to be worth it. I was completely wrong. It started off bad and then just got worse. 

Place was moderately busy. Seating seemed disorganized. But, it's got a nice little view of the little pond right outside. Cozy feeling inside like a log cabin but with big windows. The fire looked like it was recently burning. It was a little chilly so it would've been nice if it was still going but no biggie. 

It seemed to take awhile for a server to come and multiple times, servers would walk our way but they would call out to other people behind us. I hardly noticed this odd behavior until other factors came into play. Finally we ordered and opted for the sampler. Not looking for a lot to eat but something to fill a craving hunger. 

The onion rings were just undercooked enough that they were kinda soggy but not too bad. The bad thing was the chicken fingers. 4 of them and all different sizes. Anyone with half a week of frying knowledge knows that frying different sized items require them to be dropped at different times. Such a shame because they looked homemade but the biggest of the 4 was raw inside. Right after noticing this, it seemed that all of the servers were avoiding us and when one did head in our direction, again, they would do the 'hello' to someone behind us. I finally flagged one down. When we showed her, her eyes almost popped out of her head. I figured that she would try to take care of it but this is when things started nose diving. 

First, when another server did bring it back, she didn't say anything and kinda dropped it on the table like we were inconveniencing her. Then, I noticed they gave us the exact same fingers which is a huge health hazard. Guests fingers on food that they put back into the fryer which contaminates the entire fryer is a huge health hazard...not even mentioning the fact the chicken was raw. Ugh. Furthermore, RE-frying food that has already cooled is another huge no no because it burns the breading very easily. It was burned. 

No apology. No credit on the bill. No compensation. Oh, and the total was only 17 bucks but the server demanded I show my I.D. for my card. Fast food doesn't even ask for I.D. when something is under 20 bucks. Was this some kind of a disgruntled jab for inconveniencing her to properly cook the food? Like...what?? 

I asked her if I could break a bill for quarters so I could get feed for the water birds outside while showing her my I.D. She told me I had to get change from the bartender. 

So, instead of feeling remorse for feeding raw chicken, we got nothing but grief and attitude. 

I don't know who was worse...the cook and their string of mistakes or the server and their odd and annoyed attitude...so, I'm thinking to myself...why am I spending money here again? 

Well, never again.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,0,1,stZfsnhtyl3XWHMoTdZqhw

To get into Bonnie Springs it costs $10 ($7 for the youngsters), but to go to the restaurant is free. Surprisingly, the food was really good. I didn't have much of an expectation since the town looks like it could be a tourist trap of hidden fees (it's not at all, btw). While the restaurant is on the higher priced side for the offerings (sandwiches $13-$15ish) the quality was really good. Wife and I had the same exact thing, cheeseburgers cooked medium w/ cheddar cheese and we got a grilled cheese for the little man. By 2yo my son will be able to write a book on the best grilled cheeses in the valley. Burgers were cooked to perfection, seasoned nicely, and the bun was fresh. It was a really good all American burger. Young buck loved his grilled cheese. Pro tip, their ranch dressing is off the charts. 

The rest of the day was great and included watching a hanging in town, attending a melodrama, a walk through the petting zoo (a deer ate my sons snacks), and we concluded with an old west photo.

3321221,2016-01-07,4,6W3hdaCjx_n1kADEuORduA,"Took a long nap after arriving at the motel and woke up hungry! The restaurant is really the only food accessible without leaving, so W and I ambled our way there around 6pm - there are no lights between the motel and restaurant, and there aren't really any good signs, so it took us a few minutes and our cell phone flashlights to reach the restaurant.

There is a big sign when you walk in that says ""WAIT TO BE SEATED BY HOSTESS"" - we stood there for a couple of minutes and there was no hostess and not even a greeting by the bartender. W finally asked someone if we could just sit anywhere and they gave us the go ahead.

Ordered BBQ ribs and BBQ chicken sandwich. Food is pricey for what it is; I think it must all be pre-bought/cooked, because our food arrived only a few minutes after ordering. The salad that came with the ribs were probably the best food out of everything we've had. Ribs were ok but not that tender (we guessed pre-frozen), and chicken was flavorful but dry (anything is flavorful if you add enough sauce). The sides were atrocious; sub-par coleslaw, moldy beans, and cold corn kernels.

Lastly - this isn't part of my experience, but as we were leaving, a couple came in with their kid and sat at the bar (again, no hostess to greet them). Bartender could've directed them towards one of the tables in the dining room, but instead gruffly told them ""No kids are allowed at the bar!"" No hello, no re-direct, nothing, and they ended up leaving.

I would consider nominating this place for an episode of ""Kitchen Nightmares."" Maybe this place is better and the food is fresher during the day, but we were very disappointed.",dGT0g7kHt9IzryiITiP2Pw,1,1,1,F-TrUSF7Vzh0WtPabDxGLg

1. Dinner. We loved the BBQ pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw; also the Buffalo burger with fries.

2. Breakfast. We already knew that we are going to try this place for breakfast sooner or later.

Surprisingly, Monday morning, the restaurant was already halfway crowded. We been seated promptly.
Our orders were taken immediately. Water and coffee was served in minutes. Breakfast arrived about 10 minutes.

My bf ordered the Grandma's Country breakfast: two eggs, ham steak, country potatoes, and toast.
Everything tasted fresh and satisfying! Coffee was really freshly brewed! And I really loved the Blueberry pancakes, with FRESH blueberries in it!

Location: Just a hop, skip and a jump from Redrock Casino (10-15 minute drive) that takes you back into another time and place.  It's located in beautiful Redrock Canyon... just head west on Charleston Blvd and turn right when you see the sign for Bonnie Springs Ranch.

Bonnie Springs Ranch: has all sorts of fun things to do and you can easily spend several hours here.  There are 2 dirt parking lots (FREE) and if you park in the 1st large lot you can catch the cute little train for a 5 minute ride to the entrance area.  The 2nd lot is small and is located right in front of the entrance. There is the rustic cowboy style restaurant with a nice warm fire when you enter. 
Train Ride:  Cute, fun and Free
Horseback Riding:  I think it's around $60/hour per person. 
Zombie Shoot & Ghost Tours:  Each of these takes place one Saturday evening per month... They are both kind of pricey and we did not do these.

Bonnie Springs Restaurant:  Very Good!! The menu is classic American Food with Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  I had the Bonnie Springs burger with Corn on the Cob instead of fries. My  burger was perfectly cooked,  juicy and it came with Swiss cheese and bacon. It was served on toasted buttered sourdough bread and it was delicious!  It wasn't cheap but it is well worth the price.  They also have buffalo burgers and sometimes Elk too! The service was excellent and our waitress was friendly and saw to our needs for refills and keeping the table cleared.  Be sure to walk the grounds if you're here during the day and at no charge you'll see all sorts of animals such as their bull, ducks, peacocks, turtles and roosters.

On the Bonnie Springs Ranch. It's actually a little outside of Vegas. About 5 miles from Red Rock Canyon.

ATMOSPHERE
Casual. A little country and western. The bar looked perfect enough for me, but with two toddlers inside the main dining area gets us into less trouble. 

The restrooms... Does giant petri dish give you a good enough idea? The men's loo sounded just as bad.

FOOD
At around 1:30 p.m. on Halloween 2016, we finally FINALLY got some grub. I was hangry. 

BBQ pork sandwich = okay. No complaints, but certainly not the best I've ever devoured. 

It came with fries. Weird mix of some crunchy and many limp. Not even my fry-lovin' kid ate many of them. 

It also came with coleslaw which I will not eat, but was told it was good by another in our party.

Not a fan of the lemonade. Not fresh. Overly sweet.

KID/BABY-FRIENDLINESS
Kid menus have usual offerings. My kiddos didn't enjoy the hotdog, which they usually love. There is a baby changing station, but when we were there it was difficult to get to because the door to the handicap stall next to it was practically dangling off of one hinge. 

SERVICE
Friendly, but not so attentive. When my mother-in-law asked a different waitress (not our table's waiter) nicely for some wet wipes to get all of the BBQ sauce off, she knowingly neglected to help pick up half of them on the floor after she tossed them on the table.

TIPS
- Friday night = karaoke
- Saturday night = live music

OVERALL
The food arrived at our table for 6 after about fifteen minutes which was okay, but I hesitate to rave about a potentially charming place when the young bucks waiting the tables display subpar skills. Let's hope you have better luck than I. So much potential, this place.

The place feels like it's in the middle of the 1800s an old Nevada. Only about 20 minutes from Charleston and 215 going through the red rock State Park. Well worth the visit. If you have the opportunity,definitely go to the zoo as it is a nonprofit sanctuary.",hAZEee0Q7APAcerRQ4Ze3g,1,1,4,YKeArHoJU5yRhe27HS7Hgg

My bf and I stumbled in here after a  phenomenal hike at Red Rock (which you should also look into if you like hikes). Being foodies, we thought of trying the bison burger but the bartender suggested the Elk burger. Not only was it cooked to perfection but the fire pit lounge area will cozy you up regardless of your mood.

First time there, we saw Ms. Bonnie herself - in her 90s, looking great, and eating chicken fried steak in her spot at the end of the bar. Staff is friendly enough with a nice hint of sarcasm - appropriately attentive and they leave you to enjoy your time! Server Chris and bartender Isaac took great care of us and we can't wait to come back!!

This has become a new regular spot for us :) 


PS. The BBQ (especially ribs) are tender and smoked properly",VoRJlAhNG6D_SBZdLmio-g,4,0,5,yqlRSto_xp6Bd2ED96zm4A
5498807,2017-11-19,0,6W3hdaCjx_n1kADEuORduA,"I arrived here with my family for a late dinner at the restaurant. The food was mediocre to say the best but the service of the staff and manager on duty Olivia was totally unprofessional and rude.
I started with my bison burger and it was very uncooked. The burger was bleeding still when I ordered a medium rare. When we complained about the burger the waitress argued that medium rare was raw and after I explained that the middle was still kind of cold and the burger was then taken to be remade. 
By the time of the second burger arrived my family had already finished eating. I didn't get an opportunity to try the second burger but the fries were refried and since I didn't want to inconvenience everyone I got the burger to go.
We were charged for the burger anyway after it not being what I wanted. When my wife spoke to the manger on duty Olivia, she responded with attitude  about removing an item that we didn't get what we wanted. 
The kids and my wife were happy with their meal but due to the impolite and unapologetic attitude of the staff we will not be returning and had to post this review.",6TUqtd8ycUCv-9sLiztmAA,3,0,1,PpSE_xqLoRtB4M7DpJBSHQ

There were mallard ducks everywhere, which I thought was interesting considering we were in the middle of the desert.  We went on a Tuesday so the park was pretty much closed but you can still walk around it. We were starving but we weren't intending to eat there, but we went In to just grab a snack and head to another restaurant, but after looking through the menu everything looked legit.  We ordered the top three things bison burger, country fried steak and meatloaf which all were delicious! But the biscuits!!!  Were amazing!!!  Just go!  It's amazing!

5629431,2015-07-04,0,6W3hdaCjx_n1kADEuORduA,"Omg this place is awesome. Such a small place on a dude ranch w/ plenty to see, a nice quick trip from red rock. Was originally a stop over for pioneers on the way to California in 1800's then 

Bar is homely, we were looking for something different and this is the place. Bartender Isaac, was super cool and introduced us to his own signature creation; a peacock punch. Originally from Hawaii a great bartender. 

We ordered the 2 most popular dishes; bison burger and pulled pork with fries., so freaking  good like one of the best burgers ever.  Bison is not gamey like I was expecting very juicy tasty and excellent with pickles. Fries are good. Pulled pork with a homemade bbq sauce just.... The best tasting flavor. Not overstating how good everything is. ...... Wow....",tGCMFz6iB6yOiN4LXd06pA,2,0,5,bRGC1X5Ow1o4eVZPIILaeQ

We have been to Bonnie Springs a few times over the past for their Halloween attraction and we seen they had a restaurant and decided to come back and try it.

It is easy to park and walk to. Pretty good size place too yet kinda has a cozy feel to it with a bar area as well as a kinda of a western feel to the place. It is very comfortable and nice if they have the fireplace on.

Service was friendly and the food was good. We thought it was pretty good and worth checking out if your in the area. Prices are not too bad for being a tourist attraction..

If you head to Bonnie Springs check this place out!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,22,18,4,uFGClLLpNdTMX6NywUlPhg

I opted for thick cut onion rings ($) and he had French fries. Washed down with a soda and it was the best thing since sliced cheese. 

The property/inside was a ranch with an interesting duck pond. Kind of dirty looking but eh, led to some chit chat and people watching. You can catch a few peacocks off in the distance also. I like that it was a no frills type of place/attitude that you'd expect a ranch to have. 

Service was super nice, on top and overall ended with no problems.",TVN3qoXU0-sateboutdCZg,0,0,4,H4AMMgVASOaEZhmHr0zoDQ

The staff this last Monday in September were each and everyone exceptional. The horses are cared for exceptionally well and  so beautifully strong and trained Even a novice or expert or the most inexperienced rider is safe on them and with this wonderful wrangler Cole. He is a considerate and skilled , kind wrangler Who really knows what he's doing one of the gentleman with us had a previously hurt hip and Coke got off his horse and walked the whole trail next to him and was ready for anything to be sure the customer still enjoyed his ride/walk.  I hope I get to have him again! The wolves in the animal rescue zoo are so cool! A fav for me is the majestic plethora of amazing peacocks walking all around you! I feel wonderful and thrilled to be that close! The duck in turtle pond is serene and beautiful to sit around then sit along side your window while you dine. I live the Smoky the Bear type cozy and delicious steak house! Food is great! I only eat meat when I can get a quality steak and I look forward to their's. The darling Bartender and the wonderful staff are always so cheerful when they suggest and bring you the delicious food I love the twice baked potato. The cherry pie is home made and it is out of this world! There really cool roosters walking all around the grounds and used to have a black raven although he was not there this year! Bonnie was a showgirl in the 1950s and 6os who originally opened up an animal rescue and restaurant and the place is full of cool kitche, tradition, cool Las Vegas history. The train, decor and delights on the Ranch including A little western town is wonderful and serene. I tell everyone at VIVA LAS VEGAS ROCKABILLY WEEKEND at the end of the week to make sure before they go home to stop at Bonnie Springs!  it is definitely one of my favorite spots!!! I asked for staff names put them in my overall pockets Because they each deserved to be mentioned for their wonderful service and friendship while you are there and then washed  The overalls I was wearing when I got home . I wish I could remember each and everyone of them they were really great but I must say that Cole The horse wrangler was the best at any customer service and experience you could have even takes pictures while you're on the horse which is so considerate!  I've never had them do that for you before anywhere and he knows exactly which horse to give which person according to their size and experience and he was absolutely right on per each of us! this kid really knows what he's doing. I must admit last year I had an old crabby guy so it was a refreshing To know they got rid of him and replaced him with this delightky Cole! And to get to be taken out to the beautiful red rock Desert on the most gorgeous horse and confident Comfortable ride while being told history and stories and jokes by the wrangler.  if You were blindfold snd road backwards You would still have the safest ride with this wonderful wrangler Cole! Don't miss this spot you will be left out of an experience you'll never forget and if you do go you will make a point to go every time you're in Vegas! Bonnie Springs is actually therapy for me it brings me back down to earth and makes me glad I'm alive",GND27BvHrA3gmJa3LBhlnA,0,0,5,0PF0zgDgu3P-n072meERHQ

Came in whenever they needed me on days off, came in early whenever they needed me.  During my time there they fired more employees than any place I've ever worked at. High turn over isn't even the word because they literally run everyone off or fire them.   I could never recommend anyone to go here because they are horrible people that run the place.",PmxN0OTvx7AtOuvApwGQPw,1,1,1,v97nsUGmvVgZ3tet5z1o7Q

We love to have a table in front of the little lake. The place has a unique atmosphere. And the food is great too. My favorite part of dining there is their collection of beer. I am not a beer expert so I let my boyfriend order a beer for me. And that stuff was beyond great. I don't remember the name of the brand, but I do believe that it has a word gypsy in it. However, the service this time was very slow, the servers were totally ignoring us, and we had to go to the bar to grab our own drinks. I still give them 5 stars because Jessica took care of us and resolved the situation.",wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,0,0,5,j8ynjnlw9QSZEngCXueVnw
