713549,2014-05-20,0,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,I have had good experiences with the staff here however the area is terrible.  This is a  hot spot for the panhandlers in the area.  I can think of at least a couple of times when their begging made my guests feel uncomfortable.  I am not saying this is a bad venue just that you should be aware of this issue when choosing a spot for seeing friends or a date.,Q8-KQ668uEgt9ZDq7o8a3w,0,0,2,svBteUg5_3GwpQaStmqI2g
724644,2017-04-29,0,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,I just came through the drive thru and I'm always seeing people around the corner begging for change. I also ordered an Bacon ultimate cheeseburger with no bacon. This location usually has ok service until tonight. This location needs improvement.,De4uNnWfd-s8ji1dDPmUyg,0,0,2,z-lRNU_r4JmordLDEIL8DA
1336178,2015-04-01,0,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,"The absolute only time I eat here is if I have a craving for the buttery Jack, an oreo cookie shake, or churros. I've never had a problem with any of the people that work here (except 1), but I have a few problems with this location.

1. Way too many people begging for money. They need to keep the premises clear. I'm not against giving someone a buck or two for food, but having people begging at the intercom every time I go gets to be a bit annoying.

2. They take FOREVER to get people through the drive through. First you have to wait at the intercom for 5 minutes. Then when you get to the payment window, they find everything to do except take your payment. Then when they finally take your payment, they take another 2 minutes to give your change back. If you're lucky they won't ask you to wait at the window until the car in front of you gets their food. The wait is never less than 10 minutes. For that amount of time, I might as well wait the extra 5 minutes and eat at a real restaurant. 

3. At night it seems like they only have 1 person working 2 windows. The other night I didn't see anyone at the first window so I drove to the 2nd window, and the lady had an attitude, as if I should have waited for someone to appear at the window.

Management or the owner really need to fix this place. There is no reason they are so slow. If they are short on staff, there are plenty of people at the intercom begging for money, and I'm sure they'd be happy to have a job or even work for a free meal or two.",L7xRncCG-irmaFlDNhMHiA,1,0,1,Y0BXkpEvjGDGQrtmqSl8Ug

2169906,2014-06-20,0,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,Last night I want to jack in the box. I guess they where a bit busy for the night around 8:54 pm and I was being patient while the girl took my order. Went to the Window to pay and the girl told me if I could wait a bit since she was busy. I didn't mind waiting got my bf's food l. It took a bit long but I didn't mind. Over all good customer service. The girl that attended me was nice. Wouldn't mind waiting a few minutes since I wasn't in a hurry. Just wish they had some veggie burgers...,N5gMFThkvPsEtkGPjPBt2g,0,0,4,6F-0N1xXVyNcD7rgWX2ulw

3141704,2017-06-30,2,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,Jack In The Crack! We go waaayy back I mean I practically lived at Jack In The Box during high school days because it was the hang out spot afterschool. This location is pretty far from my house but I have a doctor on this side of town so today I decided to stop by. The drive thru actually was empty and the inside was packed. Because it is a million degrees outside I wanted one of the Oreo Milkshakes! Improved over the years because they use to be too watery. Occasionally Jack In The Box sends out coupons and I happened to snag one of the ones for a $1 off any size shake. Utilized that bad boy today and went on my merry way! Fast service and the employees were nice. It's fast food.. What else can I say?,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,2,3,dzQ_MBQYGd20DPv-pumRTw
3341117,2013-09-10,1,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,"The employee working the counter was having a hard time processing my order in the register and finally stated they were in training before going to find help. I understand there is a learning curve and it takes time to learn new procedures, but having a trainee flying solo at the register during lunch hour was probably not one of Jack's best decisions. This definitely wasn't fast food. The tacos I ordered were not your typical, hot and greasy JITB tacos. They were cold and not very tasty. Iced Tea is not available with all of the other beverages when dining in. You must get it from behind the counter, which only adds to the delay and frustration. I frequent the drive thru at this location and have never really had an issue. This was my first dine-in experience and it may be awhile before I return.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,1,1,2,7vc0vXGLDJ6pq9EJ4yT-0A

3977645,2018-03-10,0,q1tKmIMgDdBGwLzcuxnmtg,I give this location 3 stars because I like their burgers. The only problem with this location is those homeless bums and crackheads hanging around the drive thru begging and asking for change. I just don't pay them no attention. The last time I was nice enough to give one a couple of dollars so he can eat. I don't do it anymore though. However this location is pretty good.,8xoiTVHPawcYxeaW8fZpDg,0,0,3,qYwqDAUX5Eu5laaVagcGRg
