1049543,2011-11-16,0,Vk1-8BhzJdZYiZjXPFwgEQ,"I've been coming here on and off since I moved to Vegas the Summer of 2008. 

The setup is your basic bar in Vegas... which are poker/slot/black jack machines at the bar, as well as regular sitting, no machine in front of you. They also house pool tables, a few arcade games, a little lounge area to sit down and watch TV, juke box, and brand new flat screen TVs . There is not a kitchen at this location but rather a Roberto's next door and Hawaiian BBQ is a 4 minute walk away. 

Initially I started coming here because it was close to where I was staying at the time and they had great happy hour specials. The happy hour times changed a bit since then, they are currently from 4-7pm and 12am-3am everyday and all drinks are half price. In addition to good deals, they also have Sunday Ticket so you can find me here on Sundays too. 

Overall, it's a basic bar that stands out in customer service. All the bartenders I've met here are really cool. Of course a few have came and gone, but all replacements are open to customers make you feel comfortable. This place is pretty well kept, even when you stumble in at 2:30am.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,3,0,4,y0_J6aWsANYE41Qas7rBWQ

It took 10 minutes for someone to come over to take a drink order, she came back with our order pretty quick and asked if we were ready to order food. I asked for a menu and said we would need a few minutes. 45 minutes later a woman in her PT'S  uniform shirt came out of the kitchen and was saying goodbye to her coworkers! I stopped her and asked if she could just ask someone to come and take our order. This young woman did that herself, she took our order and was super nice about it. Then she was leaving so I stopped her again to say thanks and gave her a $5 tip. Then it was another 35 minute wait for a hamburger  and some wings. We never did get to reorder our drinks.  We were done with our meal and just wanted to pay and leave.The bartender was flirting with a guy at the other end of the bar and after waiting 10 more minutes, I stood up by the table (which, by the way, was the closest one to the bar) hoping she would turn around so I could get the check. No such luck. Finally someone came in the door so she turned around, and saw me! She brought our check and said sorry for the wait. I paid, left NO tip, and promised my self never to return. You see, this is not the first time we've had to wait for an unusually long time, nor the second. This has been a constant problem for the last year. With the change in the menu and a total  lack of customer service, we will not be back. I had hoped that when they removed the wall and door between the ""restaurant area"" and the bar that the long wait times would dissappear.  No, they did not. I believe this is a management problem and ignorance on the part of the employee.",kyEy7PQlm5I2QzCIS40GLg,0,0,1,DuxZZGUVVCNZKC4nbonhmw

When I arrived, I was greeted promptly with a smile from Bree (who is also the manager). She served us right away and we began our night. Throughout the night we juggled some loose machines and won a lucrative share. Yay! Bree was there to make us feel special throughout our first PT experience. We were skeptical at first but now our minds are at ease and made up. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by. Guys, it's a fun time!",KmmxQtyjKFDX9Jd4tePdIQ,1,0,5,2wBzY4SqiRbcAznrHkIzbw
5135379,2016-03-05,0,Vk1-8BhzJdZYiZjXPFwgEQ,What the hell can I say about this place ? It's great for locals! Mindy is a terrible bar tender she always remembers me even tho I only come in once every six months also she's remembers my drink of choice. ( please note the sarcastic tone) she's great most of the people that work here are great. I don't think I've had a bad experience here so far in the two years I've been coming ! So give this whole in the wall for a PTs place a good shot!,jLMhF5g3tn8pquntJ-0E4Q,0,1,5,aXOQRJEXfgKfAimsW8wDlQ
5513378,2013-07-04,3,Vk1-8BhzJdZYiZjXPFwgEQ,"Again, I have had friends come into town to hang out and we hit a few local joints to drink and hangout.  PT's is close to home and we were sick of the Casino bars.  But, to be honest, after awhile, all bars look the same.  But, it's not really about the place you are drinking but, who you're drinking with.  

PT's is a chain but, that doesn't matter to me.  A Jack & Coke tastes the same here as it does at the touristy bars, but it's cheaper.  Anyhow, we just sat around and reveled in stories from our past.  The bartender took care of us and was ready for more drinks when we needed / wanted it.  Everything was clean, a ton of T.V.'s which would probably mean that watching the Superbowl here would be fun.  I have no complaints...

Some may say, that this isn't the best part of town, but who cares.  Lock your doors on your car and turn the alarm on, and you'll be fine.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,5,2,4,Er9JvfsfZnFZEFbyPR60rA
