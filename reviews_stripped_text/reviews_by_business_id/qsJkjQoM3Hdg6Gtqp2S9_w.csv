We have had unpleasant experiences here at this location several times now. It is closer to our house than the Flamingo or Rainbow location so we really wanted it to be more convenient for us. Sadly enough, every time we go here our order comes out wrong. We order a spicy number 6 and no spice is added, we order a spicy number 4 and it burns our heads off. We don't run into this problem at any other location. 
We have also been to this location and it is super busy and their is no one to help us sit or order food. 
New management is needed here. They really need to change these things. I would love to frequent this restaurant but find that it is hard to trust that our food will be done consistently.",hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ,0,0,3,wYbeErQ_vUd5DYMnasKuGA

I need 2 high chairs and room for a stroller. Then a girl took us to a big table which was perfect. She brought us 2 high chairs and kids were all seated and we got everything situated then they told us we needed to move because they thought there was more people. That place wasn't even that busy. I was annoyed but just swallowed and got all the kids and went to a different table. It was a same size table that they sat us! So we were trying to get situated again and someone came and told us to move to a smaller table. I was annoyed AF and the girl saying I thought more people.. WTF do they not understand English or just plain stupid? I was so pissed we decided to leave. They didn't apologize or anything. If you're stupid then that's fine with me but don't be wasting my time and energy. Definitely not going back there.,khfnTx39pWf7cEJBuAEWJg,0,0,1,wWZolaFumDQ1lj0ab5h2LA

We had basil chicken, yellow chicken curry, pad thai, & fried rice.  My 1 & 4 year old devoured the pad thai and fried rice...this may be a direct result of the amount of thai food I consumed while pregnant with both of them. 

The basil chicken and yellow chicken curry have to be some of the best I have ever had.

With that said, I had 2 babes with me and the service was a little slow, and less than attentive. They also put us in the very back corner, which felt a little like ""they have kids keep them out of the main area."" It took a long time to get drinks and have our order taken.

Since discovering Archi's I've stopped going to my old, cheap Thai eats place, Thai Style Noodle. When I can pay an extra $2-$3 for an infinitely better dish, it's a no brainer. The noodles are great. I usually get the Pad Seeyoo(sorry about the spelling) or Pad Thai. Both great options, but it really depends on the day. The chefs are usually pretty consistent.

Thai Basil Fried Rice is good too and the curries are delicious. One of my only complaints is that even though they ask you your spiciness preferred level (1-10), their tastes usually run hot. No biggie, but when I'm with people that want mild, they expect mild and I don't want them having a bad time that night or the next day.

Anyways, Archi's is now in my restaurant rotation so I hope they continue to stay yummy.",qui1s5g63qbg8nTBSIElMg,2,2,5,sgJOBaiBIRJzXGJOaDN8WA

After we sat down a server came and told us and ""you want drinks?"" And we all just wanted water and the guy gave us a dirty look. After we got our waters we waited 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. We had to go ask someone to take our order. After taking our order they took forever but as I was looking around people who sat down after us got their food and was practically half way done with their meal. I got up to speak with the manager and he walked away from me. He had our food on the tray he was bringing out and walked over to our table and started to place them on the table as I was trying to tell him about how terrible the service is. After he put 2 of the 3 plates we ordered down he told me that they are busy and that's why it took so long. Being busy doesn't excuse you to give some of your customers crappy service.

We usually get the Pad See-Ew, Pad Thai, Spicy Eggplant, and sometimes a Thai Iced Tea. My wife also loves their Green Papaya Salad and enjoys their various curry dishes. For the spicy dishes, they will ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 0 to 10. We usually go with ""2"" because their ""3"" can be extremely hot, as in sweat-inducing, nose running-like-a-river hot! I can't even fathom what a ""10"" might be like. Their prices are very reasonable except I do get annoyed when they charge you $1 for a small bowl of rice without letting you know ahead of time. Pet peeve, I know.

What distinguishes this place from most other Thai restaurants (and the original location) is the warm, clean, and contemporary interior. You feel like you are dining in an upscale restaurant instead of a hole-in-the-wall joint. Service is typically friendly and efficient.

The combination of quality food at reasonable prices, solid service, upscale ambience, and as an added bonus its proximity to home make this our go to place for Thai. Well done, Archi, well done.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,5,4,4,Lm_VdUMGwDuO0vAVb2DYhg

Drinks are easy. They usually either crack open a young Thai coconut with a straw, or pour me an ice cold glass of Thai tea, depending on my mood. If I'm hungry enough for an appetizer, I go with the veggie egg rolls, and sometimes a cucumber salad with peanut sauce. For dinner, it is almost exclusively a beef salad with a request for lean beef (no, I don't like chewing on fat) and my absolute favorite, PANANG CURRY with chicken beast. I'm literally drooling while writing this. Panang curry is so creamy and spicy you'll want to order extra curry sauce, which I usually do. I've tried other things, that were admittedly delicious, but I can't not order panang. 

If you're lucky enough to come in often, the hostesses/waitresses will likely remember you. This always adds to the experience, when they welcome me back and ask if I'd like my regular order. Nothing beats that feeling.

219299,2015-06-12,0,qsJkjQoM3Hdg6Gtqp2S9_w,"Not going back to this location after today!

 About 2 weeks ago my 3 year old daughter and I went to eat there just before 5 pm on a Friday. We got our food and after only a few bites, my daughter needed to use the restroom. I could not locate a staff member to let them know that we would be right back so we left our practically untouched food there and quickly went to the restroom. Just before that, the restaurant started to get extremely busy and large numbers of people began showing up. We returned to our table about 5 minutes later, only to find that our plates had been cleared and they had already seated somebody else there. When i let the hostess know that we were at the restroom and not done eating, she said that they threw our food away because they thought we left without paying. I asked if we could be seated in a different table and have our order re-made quickly and she said that they did not have any tables for 2 people and that there was going to be a wait. I asked if they would be able to make our order to go and again, she said that there was going to be a long wait since they were busy. I also spoke to a manager about this who apologized, but again did not offer a solution. Even though we did not get charged for the few bites that we ate, i find it very frustrating that my dining experience was ruined (not to mention that I am trying to feed a 3 year old dinner) all because they got busy and in a hurry to seat everybody that showed up just after 5. I vowed then that i would never go back to this location. 

Then...today I was in the neighborhood and thought i would give them a second chance. I ordered a Thai beef salad (spicy #2). I have ordered this more than 5 times at this location and it was always perfect amount of spice for me. I also order it this way at the Flamingo location (which has always been amazing!) I was sooooo disappointed to taste my salad, only to discover that they did not put ANY spice at all. (totally changes the taste of the salad!) I called them from work (30 min away) and let them know. Instead of apologizing, they started yelling at the cook (with me still on the phone) and came back on the line and said that they did put spice and that #2 is not hot and i should have ordered it hotter. I told the girl that i always order it this way and i know they did not put any spice, she just said sorry i asked the chef and they did put spice (basically calling me a liar). She said that i could bring it back in and get a new one. I let her know that i work 30+ min away and i am not coming back on a Friday after 5 (considering my last Fri experience). She put me on hold and I think talked to a manager. She came back on the line and said that next time I should have brought it back right away. 

Clearly, not returning here! Also, I am pretty upset about the whole thing, considering I have never left a review good or bad on yelp.",as0_PSHGTGv4m1u027ESSg,0,0,1,hYCXJaA9l5FvzVaAJ-7kbg

Overall one of the better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. It is clean and easy to find and very convenient if you live in or near Summerlin. 

One area of constructive criticism since I do eat here often with the family: I would say is the customer service needs to be improved drastically since this is the only area that has a lot of room for improvement since their food is very good. It is not bad by any means, but they often appear disorganized. Some servers are better than others. Specifically, when lines start to form the given estimated times are more like guesses and substantially differ depending on who passing by at the front.

Then, when we went, we had to wait ANOTHER 25 MINUTES!  During that time, they could have cooked many other meals which they did.  They helped all the people in the restaurant first even though they told me it would only take 25 minutes.  Plus, we went to pick up the order ourselves.  If you are backed up, you need to tell people not to come and give a better wait time.

When I called in to complain, the manager was not very nice.  He wasn't very apologetic and just said he would talk to the person taking orders.  He didn't offer a discount or any other good will.  We have been to that restaurant countless times and the manager was very rude.  He just hung up and wasn't willing to talk it through and just complained that it was ""very busy"" today.  Instead, he should have offered some sort of discount or something else for having us wait for so long.

Do not order take out from them.

Last time we did it online and then found out the restaurant was closed because all of the servers had quit that day.  

This time we ordered and had to wait an additional 25 minutes.  What is the point of ordering take out if you have to wait that long.

Finally, BEWARE when you order certain dishes.  We have ordered some dishes like curry, and the entrees, and the portion sizes are extremely small.  They aren't even big enough to fill half the plate.

I hit up Buldogi's, Jollibee and Pyaar (R.I.P.) long before I even bothered to check this place out. Could it be living across the street from Basil n' Lime? I really don't know.

So I finally did check the place out. What a wise decision. :)

This may seem a little underwhelming to some because I had Pad Thai. I know, I know, too ""Americanized,"" but that's the very dish that eased me into trying and loving Thai food, and to this day I feel the only way l I can trust a Thai restaurant is if they do Pad Thai right. Anyways, on to how I felt about the Pad Thai. It came out in a HUGE plate, and they don't skimp on the meat (a very good thing since Basil n' Lime is starting to get skimpy with the meat in their Pad Thai). It was fresh, and of course it would be ridiculous to expect Pad Thai to not be greasy at all, but the grease was at a minimum, which was great. No groggy, increased blood pressure feeling afterward. The only issue I had with the pad thai was a few too many glass noodles, they really could have cut back on that (and looking at other plates around the restaurant it seems like they smother EVERYTHING in glass noodles) In addition to the Pad Thai, I also had the Thai spring rolls. These definitely could have used a little more seasoning, but they were fine when dipped in the sweet chili sauce on the side.

The service wasn't very attentive unfortunately, I had to flag people down for pretty much everything, and the fact that the restaurant wasn't even that crowded made it even weirder. The dining floor is very nice though. Small but cozy feeling, not cramped. The ambiance is also in a sort of middle ground between casual and formal. The decor was also very in character (with the exception of the small Budda (not Buddha) statue on the front table....wtf?). The chairs were uncomfortable though, just saying. 

My bill came out to be about $13. At B n' L, it would be almost $16 or $17 for a similar meal, so that's one pro Archi's has over them.

THE FINAL VERDICT:

Pros:
Fresh food.
Reasonably priced.
They didn't screw up the pad thai, a good enough pro in of itself.

Cons:
Iffy service.
Too many glass noodles in everything.
Uncomfortable chairs, so it's probably better to do take-out.

The wtf?:
Is the fat Buddha (appropriately known as Budai) apart of Thai culture at all?

Suggestions:
Be more conservative with the glass noodles. You only need a little bit of them for some crunch in the food, since they don't have much of a flavor on their own. 

Will I return? I'm really not sure.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,2,2,3,s3So0q8rTL2M2XZs2woFtA

Since my friend and I aren't big fans of spicy things, we got level 2 spiciness for our dishes (which can be rated out of 10).

So it was a bit drafty inside and we walked to be moved further from the door... we were sat directly to the left of the open door maybe two tables down. After we were moved it was less drafty but still on the cool side. This was the day we had the snow storm for 2.5 minutes. We got our usual with the addition to the deep fried tofu. The pad Thai came back with a chemical taste and wasn't edible. So that was a bummer. Seemed like they're didn't properly clean or let burn off whatever cleaner was being used. So we then split the veggie basil. Towards my last bite I wasn't sure if it tasted odd or maybe it was just cold at that point. Our Thai tea was even a different color... we thought it might have been a different batch or bottom of the batch scenario. It tasted normal for the most part but the coloring was darker than the norm. Other tables had the same and no complaints so we over looked it. The service was still good. Never had a complaint about the service though!! Seems like just an off day.,zuopKcPI1VBVFG8ynCHIMA,2,1,3,p-SA0OGv_nppO60apKru4g

Panang Curry - I would definitely recommend this dish with tofu, it literally will melt in your mouth. The tofu is slightly fried so the outside has some texture and it is served over white rice. Sadly brown rice is an extra $2. 

Pad Kea Mow - This dish is so satisfying and delicious. Best Pad Kea Mow I have ever had.

Tom Yum Soup - Sometime I will get this as an light appetizer before my main entree, but  be careful they make this REALLY spicy so get a low number for spice.

Pad Thai - always a winner.

Soup it came with was good. They brought out a bowl of rice which I thought came with lunch, and my food a bit later.

No noodles for the baby. Had to ask about 5 minutes into my own meal all the while trying to keep me quiet by giving him the rice which he just threw on the floor.

The baby started to fuss toward the end of the meal so I handed them my CC so we could get out of their quickly.

Shapow man ordered a beef salad which came real quick. My red curry lunch special took it's sweet time but what lacked in readily available made up in mmmm mmmm good.

The soup that is included with the lunch special was kind of a thai american fusion. It was chicken soup but was thickened and egg dropped. Thick cuts of onion, carrot slivers, and celery with decent sized slices of chicken white meat.

I was overall impressed with the red curry. Medium wasnt quite as spicy as i was expecting ordering a medium but it had a very pleasant creaminess from the coconut milk. Lots of bamboo shoots which i love. Salad was perfectly dressed with a thickened fish sauce (i think) based dressing. Overall everything on that plate was friggin good.

again, the streets can go on forever as ever.  we were almost to
our own street [buffalo] so we had to decide fast.. 

we came upon a plaza that had a jollie bee, a fancy shmancy, a couple other things... and archi's thai cafe.   though I told the kids they could pick what they wanted, I came out the winner in this game.  again, I love Thai food.

theirs lots of parking.. 

the decor is very traditional thai and is a really good sized restaurant with lots of seating.  our waitress was friendly and though it was busy.. she never forgot about us.

the order:

appetizer- stuffed chicken..  [wow]  the kids loved it..  my son, who doesn't often venture from the norm,  loved  this dish a lot.  super good..

i had my usual yellow chicken curry mildly spiced and i they had an excellent curry..

won ton soup- the won tons were juicy and the broth flavorful.. the vegetables and slices meat slices were plentiful.  it definitely did not disappoint.

shrimp fried rice- comes with a lot!  it's tasty.

after trying archis for the first time..  i'm a fan!
will definitely try the one closer to our house.. not sure when i'll ever see this particular location again.. but if i were closer i'd probably be a regular!",Nw6Jza_cb0aqd4PT769Vzw,2,2,4,ei0jtnDZqOyPa6cNwl_aFA

This is not your usual Asian themed furniture but don't let this fool you, for the food is as good as it gets.  

Waiters will take your order and ask you from a level of 1-10 how spicy you would like your food to be, and plenty enough to satisfy all types of taste buds and spice level to handle.  Tom Kha may not be for everyone but It is a great little soup starter like won ton soup for Chinese food.  Price could be cheaper, but the quantity of food is decent enough and good enough for the price.  I don't know if your typical person would go everyday, but nice to have once in a while.

Our biggest issue was the ""Fresh Spring Rolls"" which are a signature of any good Thai restaurant. These had a very doughy wrap and felt more like vegetable sushi rolls. Once again, no seasoning or signature flavor at all. The peanut sauce was extremely tame and didn't add much.  Did not enjoy these at all (mainly because of the wrap)

The thing about success and growing more restaurants is will the consistency be there at ALL locations. I can honestly say before I tried this location the one on rainbow my go to since closest to home. The food has been just as awesome, amazing, and on point every time.

Two things that stood out for me came to this location versus the others. I felt like the lunch special portion was twice the size compare the rainbow location. I would order the same thing spicy basil with ground chicken. Swear the spicy basil was twice the size. The plate was full full compare to rainbow location everything looked nicely portion size. Just overflowing almost. Thumbs up for me!!! The dining area might be the same size as rainbow location but feel like bigger again maybe double in size. Fair the set up lot more different. The dining room has high ceilings compare to the rainbow location. Upfront almost like dining room next to dining room. Not as loud so comes lunch time or busy no need to shout out conversations. The tables not literally next to one another then rainbow location. The decor like definitely know walking into Thai restaurant. The service feel like they stop by more often check up on you.

2375077,2010-06-08,0,qsJkjQoM3Hdg6Gtqp2S9_w,"So Archi's turned out to be a hidden gem after going there for the first time, I thought the food was decent but not spicy as I had ordered. I LOVE spicy food- the hotter, the better. I know most people think they like spicy food and when you give them a mildly hot dish they start crying like a baby. Which is why I always order my dishes at the highest spice level a restaurant serves. And so, my first visit to Archi's I did as such and was disappointed by the lack of heat. I mentally crossed them off my checklist of my favorite Thai spots....  A month later I was craving Thai and Archi's is literally a block from my house so I gave them another try. After the first 5 bites of food, I was breathing FIRE!! I couldn't believe the extreme turn around of spiciness level and I absolutely loved it! 

Archi's has now become one of my top favorite Thai places and I know I can count on them to live up to my expectations. I work in a smoky bar and when I get home from work I usually feel sick to my stomach from breathing in second-hand smoke all day. The Tom Yum with chicken (level 10) always does the trick to make me feel better or cure a hangover. I also LOVE the Pad Pak w/chicken (lot's of delicious veggies with choice of meat), Garlic Pepper Chicken, and Red Curry. The only think I don't care for is the Pad Thai at this place.

My favorite so far would be Komol's (in Sahara) but this is a good alternative considering I live in Summerlin.

Archi's Thai Cafe was the first Thai spot that really stood out to me and got me hooked. They had my favorite Pad Kee Mao for years. Now, I typically go to other places because I have found almost all of my favorite dishes done better at other Thai restaurants, but Archi's remains consistent and I'll probably always have a soft spot for some of their recipes.

My love really enjoys the Yen-Ta-Fo at Archie's. I know without a doubt that if I stop by to pick her up some soup I can always pick up and enjoy some Pad Kee Mao or Panang Curry for me. While the Pad Kee Mao is not my absolute favorite version of Pad Kee Mao anymore, Archie's is still a very good and robust one, with lots of character...easily one of the better versions in town...throw in the fact that they do so many dishes well above average and you won't hear me complain about coming here.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,20,18,4,JtxTP3bkT1YuGs_8E_FYeA

What started off as a positive experience, slowly and annoyingly became a long & drawn out waste of our time. 

After 30 minutes of waiting for our food, I became drawn in and aware of the time - I was starving! I saw that there were tables that were seated after us, receiving their food, I suppose it's because they were appetizers? I couldn't tell. I was still annoyed and very hungry. 

I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food. At this point I was very antsy, hungry, and aggravated. My soda has watered down a lot at this point (I like to drink it fizzy with my meal.)

45 minutes later, our food arrived. We asked the server if they could be so understanding to swap out my coke for a fresh one, since I hadn't even drink it yet and it had gone flat since we waited so long for the food to come out. The waiter didn't understand, he thought we wanted a coconut water - so he got the manager involved. The manager listened to our concern and request, but he said that they don't do that here and that our request was unusual. So we just had to say - ok thanks, never mind then.

It's just a simple coke - we were agitated about the extensive wait, my watered down coke that was clearly not drank from, but they weren't concerned about our complaints. He was polite and professional - but I still feel slapped for the whole experience. It wasted our time and not once did our server or any server come out to explain the long wait for our food or check on us. 

Although, we requested spice level 7, it was really a level 1. We asked 3 times for a chili tray to be refreshed as the chilies were gone - 3 different servers later, brought the chili tray. We also asked for lemons 2 times in a row, the second person finally brought it for us. There were a lot of servers but no one wanted to help our table. Our food was getting cold as were were waiting for these things.

The positive things I could take from this place was that the noodles were moist, the pad kee mao had nice flavor, and the pad thai (although bland) was a massive portion - I feel like it was at least 4 portions that they brought out, which is a good deal. 

Yet, I wasn't a fan about the horrible service.  If I ever feel inclined to come back, I would order take out instead.

I used to frequent the movie theater next door when I was a teenage hoodlum and remember when this place used to be some really crappy Americanized Chinese food place that always smelled like crappy Chinese food. I was really surprised it was the same place considering how cute & Thai-like the inside looked! 

We've sampled their yellow curry, panang curry, beef and basil, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, pad kea mao, and papaya salad. My favorite is the panang curry! Omgosh, it was so delish, until I went home and checked out the calorie content. Panang curry typically has about 40-50g's of fat for one serving. Ouch! Well, anything with that much fat better be worth it, and I'd say that one serving of panang curry is worth it. Their pad thai is on the greasy side and kind of bland when you think about what's in it. I definitely prefer the pad kea mao because it has more veggies and tastes like basil (yum!!!)  compared to what you'd get in pad thai with just bean sprouts & peanuts.

I did not enjoy the papaya salad. It was my first time trying it, but for $10, you get a ""salad"" that has a grated green papaya and this ""dressing"" that just tasted like fish sauce?

While it's not the place I go most often for Thai food, it's the place I go when I want a decent assortment of dishes on the menu and Thai food prepared consistently well.  There's enough variety there to satisfy what you're looking for most of the time:  appetizers, salads, soups, entrees (including curry and noodle dishes) and desserts.  I've eaten at the W. Sahara restaurant, and Rainbow Blvd. restaurant and found the food and service to be consistently good at both.

Lunch portions are almost as big as the dinner portions and include an egg roll and small soup.  They're definitely worth choosing from during the lunch hour.

Dinner is always delicious.  For those who enjoy Thai food, you'll see many of your usual favorites there.  If you're new to this variety of Asian cuisine, consider adding your choice of meat to the Pad Thai (everyone seems to love this dish), Pad Se Ew, Pad Prik Pow, or Broccoli.    If you're in the mood for curry, there are eight dishes to chose from and they're all good.  If you'd rather go with soup, I highly recommend Tom Yum or Tom Kha.  (Tom Kha is essentially Tom Yum but with coconut milk added to make the soup creamier rather than brothy.)

I prefer the fried Egg Rolls (they're served warm, right out of the fryer) rather than the fresh Spring Rolls (served cold).  And if you've never tried one, don't forget to treat yourself to a Thai Iced Tea.  They're almost too sweet for me, but they still taste fantastic.  It's almost like a liquid dessert.

Finally, like with most Thai restaurants, you can dial the spiciness up or down.  The waitstaff will ask, so go conservative if you're a little nervous and dial up from there.  You'll start to feel the heat with anything above a moderate level, and if you're adventurous, go for ""Thai hot"".  (But you better like spicy food.)

Parking (at the Sahara location) is ample since the restaurant is located in a storefront.  When you enter the parking lot, look for the Regal Cinema.  Archi's is to the right.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,7,5,5,GfXNuYRYRrbm22ln2sC8jQ

I would suggest not getting the salads or the soups too spicy because the spice tends to overwhelm these dishes. Better to add more spice later than be sorry.

Favorite dishes are chili mint ground beef with a spicy level 6. That level is a happy medium too spicy for those who cannot handle spicy. 
Another favorite is the pad thai. So delicious usually get chicken and a spicy level 6.

But the attitude that they serve along with the food makes it an unpleasant experience.  Also, they fail to attend to the details, especially keeping the place super clean, which is what you want a restaurant to do.  (Not a surprise that they were featured on ""Dirty Dining.""  Gross.)

I used to do take-out, but even that takes a loooooong time.  And you still get treated to their snotty, high-school popular girl type of attitude.

Your cooks apparently learned NOTHING in the food sanitation class to get their food handlers card through the health department. The update was the demerits were corrected- but how long will it be maintained? It's very apparent that your cooks lack responsibility of handling raw food properly when the comment was made on TV that the cooks were unaware raw meat and seafood were being held at unsafe temperatures. A class can teach you technique in handling food properly to avoid a food borne illness it can't teach you to have integrity for the food you are serving to the public!

I just so happened to eat here a few weeks ago and ordered Chicken Pad Thai and thought it was drenched in too much sauce making it a soggy clump of noodles. I asked for lime wedges and my server came back and said they didn't have any. He brought me lemon wedges instead. What? A Thai restaurant that has no limes? Limes are  a common ingredient in Thai cooking and the kitchen doesn't have any? 

The service was inattentive. The server came with my order and never returned to see if everything was good. Several staff walked by several times but never took my plate or came back with a check.

I used to love and frequent this place often, but then went through a phase where I just wasn't feeling the Thai vibe.  Recently, though, I got a craving for some red curry.  I could just taste that flavorful goodness as we drove down to the restaurant.  My husband was excited about the Pad Kea Mow.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in my grand comeback to this former go-to spot of mine.  

- The service was terrible.  We waited almost 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order.  I felt so bad for the couple next to us, hidden in a corner.  The staff completely forgot about them back there and the husband had to go ask the hostess TWICE to send over a waiter.  Maybe it's because it was a Monday holiday (President's Day) and they didn't expect such a big crowd?

- The prices had increased.  One of the things I loved about Archi's was their price point.  It's still moderately priced, but it was still disappointing to see the increase.

- My beloved curry (spiciness level 3) was over spiced and over powering.  The beef was overcooked and tough.  The Pad Kea Mow (also a level 3), on the other hand, was bland and had no spice to it!

My boyfriend ordered a ground chicken dish, I don't remember the name of his, but it was delicious, as well. 

I would have given them 5 stars, but we were with another couple and first they brought out our appetizers without bringing theirs and then they brought out our entrees without bringing out theirs, so we felt obligated, out of courtesy, to wait about 5-7 minutes for the rest of our party to be served first before we could eat. I didn't like that my food was just sitting there. Yes, I know I could have just started eating, but most restaurants serve everyone at the same time.

The curries, salads, and other appetizers are quite good too (except I've never been a huge fan of the spring rolls, which are normally my favorite thing at a thai place).

I even checked out the website a few times. Finally, we got the chance today for lunch. We are not on this side of town much, though it's not too long of a stretch (just one street). We watched a movie, caught a matinee bright and early, the first showing. It was noon. There were quite a few diners but it is spacious, so it didn't feel crowded.

The ambiance is very elegant and pretty, with many dark rich solid wood pieces of furniture, giving you the feel of being in a resort lobby---it is one of the prettiest thai restaurants around. I thought they were for show but they were functional. The decor on the walls were simple (silk greenery variety) and ornate (wrought iron looking, rectangular-shaped). Seating is mainly chairs and tables with some bench seating. There were touches of alters but nothing large (or gawdy, for that matter). The kitchen is well concealed but you can hear the cooking activity (it isn't very distracting that you don't enjoy your meal, if you can still carry on with conversation, it's all good).

I was so excited to dive in, I didn't take any pictures, but I can still see the delicious dishes in my head. (Before we went into the theater, we checked out the menu on Yelp, so we knew what we wanted.) We ordered the fried rice, chicken and yellow curry, chicken, which came with a bowl of steamed white rice. It was so yummy. The fried rice was flavorful without being overly salty. It was big. The curry dish was excellent. We had seconds but we also had leftovers. It was a little over $22, without the tip. 

The wait didn't seem long at all. The staff was nice and our server was attentive, refilling our waters without us asking. (We got greetings both on our way in and as we were leaving.)

My husband loves spicy food, so he gets (from a scale of 1-10) a 6, as for me, I am a fricking wimp when it comes to heat in my food so, I usually have a few bites and eat the crap out of the lettuce since it's mostly water and it's super refreshing! 

Other than the Papaya Salad, the food is like any other Thai restaurant and can assist with any fix that you're looking to get for Thai food. The thing that differentiates Archi's from other Thai restaurant is the fact that they pay attention to detail through service and presentation. Pure white plates and carved garnishes are usually small indicators that they care about- presentation. The decor of the restaurant is very modernized. Walking towards Archi's the first time, you'd assume that the place was as plain as the exterior of the restaurant... Not at all true.

A restaurant that has our favorite wine, Riesling, as their house wine gets an extra star in my book, because it's never happened before.  Kudos!

We started with Tom Kha, and it was up there with the best we've ever had, loaded with white meat chicken and lots of flavor.  How did it know it would be just what the doctor ordered for the flu I'd come down with the next day?

For once, I managed to convince Herb to let me take a break from our chicken-infused life, and we ordered the Garlic Pepper Shrimp.  I was in heaven!  It was delicious, and had a good-sized helping of the elusive (at least in my culinary world) crustaceans.  I even convinced him to eat a few, since there were too many for me.  That's because there was yet another chicken dish to dig into.

Country Curry (with chicken, natch) wasn't as successful.  It was okay, but a little too bland, though we'd ordered it medium.  The waitress took it back to the kitchen for an additional helping of hot stuff, and it was vastly improved.  We've been a little skittish ever since going to Australia and learning what REAL Thai ""medium"" is like, i.e., smoke pouring out of your ears, so AmeriThai medium turns out to be not spicy enough too often.  

Service was excellent, and even though we got there late and were the last people to leave the restaurant, we didn't feel rushed.  

I'm looking forward to trying some of the other dishes on Archi's menu, and maybe even one of the other locations.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,3,4,AkOY-YQCVwXoy1r-dQd3jQ

Then I thought again ...I'll order a side of Pineapple Fried Rice just in case. My husband ordered the Thai Beef Salad which has grilled top sirloin, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, and hand-tossed in spicy lime dressing . That salad never lets me down..it always turns out really good. I ventured away from my usual chicken curry dishes and wanted to also order a salad. I chose the Papaya Salad that had sliced green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, dried shrimp, and spicy lime dressing. When I read it on the menu my eyes failed to see the dried shrimp. I was picturing nice big juicy shrimps on top of that salad. When they served it I thought ""Maybe I forgot to mention the shrimp"" ..because I couldn't see them. I started eating the salad and my husband starts eating it too. Then I tasted the little dried up shrimps which are smaller than the peanuts so they are barely noticeable. I dare not say a word because my husband loathes mostly all seafood and he already ate half of of the dish! It was a nice crunchy salad because of the papaya but I didn't mind. If I were to get this again I would have them leave out the dried shrimp because I'm not a fan of it. I also had my safe Pineapple Fried Rice which has Jasmine rice, stir fried with tomatoes, onion, green onion, pineapples, cashews, raisins, egg and cumin powder. It's a nice melody of flavor that blends nicely together. I had to stop myself from taking more than a few bites so I wrapped the rest of it for lunch for the next day. We ended with the Mochi Ice Cream which comes with three flavors we chose Red Bean, Green Tea and Strawberry for my husband.( He has a hard time trying new things) I always enjoy the ambiance here because it's relaxing and the food is delicious!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,2,4,_8V27J17A4SURF2pu19oaA

4506594,2010-02-11,0,qsJkjQoM3Hdg6Gtqp2S9_w,"When my youngest son and his fiancee brought me here yesterday for Lunch... I thought to myself as I walked in.... ""I've been here before... but when?"". They tried to bring me here last year when I was visiting, but Archi's Thai was closed that day... They took me to another place... and was extremely disappointed. As you can see by the rating, Archi's was a pleasant surprise and very good Thai cuisine... judging by the Lunch Specials.

As I told the kids... Archi's is deserving of 5-Stars for the sampling of the Lunch Special... and if the Dinners were as good and consistent as the Lunch Special that I had.

Atmosphere is most unlike Southeastern Asian.... The decor is set in medium dark woods... furniture is French Provincial in style... pictures are, surprisingly, of Thailands French Colonial days with framed pictures of their former Royalty in Thailand of days gone by. You will be surprised by this atmosphere... a little of French Colonial in an Asian restaurant.

On the menu....

Tom Yum Soup (**** Complimentary) Lemongrass, Lime Leaves and Blue Ginger infused Broth, Mushrooms, Tomatoes and Lime Juice... sprinkled with Cilantro and Green Onions. For a smallish 3"" diameter cup / bowl... this Soup could be considered Thailand's version of Chinese Hot and Sour Soup. Dang good... but left me wanting more... but it's complimentary.

Lunch Special #4 - Red Curry Dish with Beef (***** $6.95 Shrimp-$7.95) Fresh Red Curry Paste in Coconut Milk with Zucchini, Bamboo Shoots (a lot of 'em), Basil, and Bell Peppers. 

When you order this... the wait-staff will ask you the degree of Hot-ness that you want your Soup (from 1 to 10... with 1 being a lack of Heat and 10 being Super Hot)... I was considering ordering the Soup with a 10... My son and his fiancee looked at me quizzically or amazingly. They really tried to convince me to reconsider.... I tried this tactic... I asked the waitress... ""If you ordered this, what number would you order?"" She replied with a 6. So, I compromised.... 8.

When the Soup came out, The Soup was accompanied by a very small Green Salad which was totally inconsequential considering it's size; a Thai Egg Roll (***)... I really don't like totally Veggie Egg Rolls, and a thinly fried Won-Ton (****). This was just a small sampling of from their extensive menu.

The Red Curry Soup was something else altogether... As you travel West across SouthEast Asia... you'll notice that the Asian countries will be more influence by Indian Cuisine as you travel. This Soup was silky smooth from the Coconut Milk and the Red Curry gave it a warm color and unique flavor that only Curry can impose. Coconut based Soups are some of my very favorite. If I had to penalize the Soup for any reason, it would be for the amount of Bamboo Shoots... just too much. Otherwise, something you should try whether it be a Lunch Special or at Dinner.

Lunch Special #5 - Spicy Basil Dish with Beef (***** $6.95) Stir Fried with Zucchini, Bell Peppers, Garlic, Chili and Fresh Basil. This was a sampling that my son's fiancee obligingly gave me to try.

A very delicious Stir-Fry with Ground Beef. I will try this next time... whenever that may be.

Wait-Staff was very friendly, helpful. I asked the waitress how the smallish chain came to be named Archi's... She said Archi was the nickname of the owner, who started his restaurants seven years ago. This location started up two years ago taking over a Pick-Up-Stix franchise that went bust. She also said the owner usually is at the Rainbow location ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/archis-thai-kitchen-and-thai-bistro-las-vegas ) since that was the original restaurant and is quite larger in size.

One other advantage of this location is the proximity to my favorite Cinema in Las Vegas... the Regal Village Square 18 ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/regal-village-square-18-las-vegas ). Archi's would be a good pre or post movie visit.

Today for our lunch break my boyfriend and I decided to give this place another try. Bad idea.  I walked in and got seated by some server who seemed to have an attitude. We waited about 20 minutes before we were greeted by a busser asking what we wanted to drink. We asked her to order food as well and she told us she had to get our server.
15 minutes later finally a server came over and took our order. The food took forever to come out but the food was actually good though. The whole process took an hour and a half which in my opinion is very lengthy not to mention IT MADE ME LATE BACK TO WORK!

I normally order the Chicken Satay and to be honest there have been times when this has been overcooked. But only when I phone in an order. And I can honestly say it's only been twice in 30 some odd visits. The peanut sauce is my favorite out of all the Thai places I've tried. Also on the appetizer front is Beef Jerky which comes with a light citrus sauce. I dont care for Thai Jerky on a norm but theirs is good. 

For the entr√©e my norm is Pad Ka Pow (Spicy Basil) Beef. It is ground beef in a spicy chili basil sauce with sliced bell pepper and zucchini. Seriously, it is without a doubt my favorite dish of theirs. The meat is so spicy and flavorful. It always clears the sinuses. If I'm not feeling Ka Pow on a certain night than I get Pad Thai. Their Pad Thai has a fresh taste to it. And while I enjoy shrimp Pad Thai; theirs while being good had the tails intact which is a pain in the keester. So I would suggest getting the chicken version of the dish.  I have had other various entr√©es that are equal in quality and flavor. And love trying new dishes when ever I need a change. 

And finally dessert. They feature a plate of sticky rice with fresh fruit which is amazing. It's a bit pricey ringing in at $7 but I think it is worth it for the amount of yummy goodness you get. And it is easily big enough for two people. 

So take a chance and try this place. As I have said it's the best Archies in town. 

Happy Eating,

I usually ordered pad Thai, spicy basil and pad see eww in the lunch special menu here. They give you a lot of food. Pad see eww was a little oily, in my opinion, but it's very tasty. You'll get a lot of thai basils in your spicy basil. Thai basil leaves taste different from American basil leaves. 

The service is okay, it can get very slow during lunch time. Another thing to note is that they close on Tuesday :(. 

However, since I discovered Thai style noodle house on Fort Apache, I have been going there instead. I feel like their menu has more variety. Their food is good and they are cheaper.

4787751,2014-03-25,0,qsJkjQoM3Hdg6Gtqp2S9_w,"My go to spot for curry and pad thai in my neighborhood. There are very few places that I visit on a consistent basis that make me as happy as a trip to Archi's does. It is my guilty pleasure without the guilt.

Lets start off with my favorite dishes. 

The yellow chicken curry is a balancing act of perfection. A carnival of different flavors melded together to make one kickass curry. Throw in some potatoes, onions, and carrots with whatever meat you desire and you have a hearty delicious meal on your hands. Choose your desired spicy level, give me a side of rice, and I'm done!

Now the pad thai is easily one of the best pad thais I've ever had. It is not some fancy rendition of pad thai with overcomplicated ingredients or an unnecessary presentation. It's pad thai, with a side of chopped peanuts and baby sprouts. That is it. It does not need to be more than that.

I will say that not all dishes are created equal at Archi's. Their fried rice is just not that well put together. It looks delicious but it just really falls short on the flavor department. And another shortcoming of Archi's is their inconsistant spice level. I usually order a spicy level of seven but it will vary wildly from mouth scorcher to somewhat mild. I think it depends on who is preparing it but make sure to keep that in mind when ordering.

Despite the complaints, Archi's still goes down in my book as a solid place to get some pad thai or curry.",eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q,0,0,4,yT7W9u0jumxv-7hHiIdqeg

So far, the best Thai food that I've tasted in Las Vegas. That probably doesn't say much, as I've only been to one other Thai restaurant. Came here around 6:30p on a Friday night. There was a little bit of a wait, (20 minutes), but no big deal. Started off with the Satay Chicken - nice and tender, and able to cut with a fork. I didn't really care too much for the Thai Egg Rolls, not that it was bad or anything, but it was just an ordinary egg roll. It did taste a little better with the peanut sauce from the Satay Chicken. Got the Larb (spicy sausage salad). My dining partner insisted on a spiciness level of 8, then after tasting it, proceeded to complain how it was too spicy - Lol! I liked it, but it was a little sparse on the salad part. Pad Kea Mow w/ chicken seemed to be a popular dish, so, we got that one too - it didn't disappoint. Even though those were the only dishes we ordered, there was enough leftover for lunch the next day. Service was good - server kept our water glasses full and frequently checked to see if everything was ok. On my next trip here, will try one of the curries, the spicy eggplant, and possibly the stuffed chicken wings.",4Zqh0-Db39qpGEHCIll9hw,3,3,4,yRW-zcCWiWXALGkAxXyP8A

I wish the curry had more a bit more curry...didn't seem to have much liquid but I liked how it had green beans.  When we ordered they told us it'd be 30 minutes.  Hubby went to pick it up after 30 minutes and he still had to wait another 10-15 minutes.  While he was waiting he spoke to a few other patrons who were waiting to be seated/pick up their orders and many of them said they've often had to wait an additional 30 minutes to pick up their orders.

I live at the apartment complex right ""next door"" - about a 5 minute walk from my door to Archis, so I end up eating there a lot.

FOOD: The food is really great. I love the pad thai of course. I've tried all of the curries and like them a lot. My girlfriend is the opposite - she loves the curries but only ""really likes"" the pad thai. I recommend getting _beef_ with your pad thai. Something about it just absorbs a bunch of flavor and tastes delicious. I also recommend venturing out and upping the spiciness a bit! (They ask you how you want it 1-10.)

My girlfriend and I love getting the wor wonton soup. It's really good. The thai iced tea is _amazing_!! The beef salad was ok. There've been a couple other dishes I've ordered that I recall just being ok rather than great.

PRICE: Really reasonable! Most dishes range from $12-15 or so. Not McDonalds, but nothing too crazy. And most dishes give you a solid amount of food.

WAIT TIME: You'll usually be seated right away. Almost always within five minutes of arriving. From the time you order, the food comes out in a pretty reasonable amount of time.

SERVICE: Usually the service is fine. There have been a couple of times when I have went where they've forgotten about or ignored us. One time there was a communication issue about how big the wor wonton soup was going to be (I was with a party of four and we wanted something big enough for all of us).",dnsCCmwYrONjUAivm3XR4w,0,0,5,jxkEOpzuosr-EJO_daWrCA

I've never had good experiences at the Thai places I've been to in the past, which pretty much made me avoid Thai restaurants in general.  All I remember are ""bean sprouts"" and ""peanuts"" - LOTS of them.

So I was a little reluctant to try Archi's, but am SO GLAD that I DID.  Can't believe I waited this long.  Their chicken pad thai is so good and their chicken fried rice is bomb. I was pleasantly surprised to see that not everything is bean sprouts and peanuts!  

We ordered those 2 dishes, an eggplant dish and a Thai iced tea which came out to be ~$40 including tax.  I wasn't too thrilled with the eggplant, it was a little bitter and harder than what I'm used to.  The serving portions are fairly large and we pretty much ended up taking 75% of the food home.

5199524,2010-03-14,9,qsJkjQoM3Hdg6Gtqp2S9_w,"Archi's is a Las Vegas Thai chain with 3 locations, and I must admit that a recent obsession with Thai Noodle had caused me to forget about how much I do enjoy some curry and noodles at Archi's, particularly at my neighborhood location. 

When we first moved to town, Archi's was our go to spot for Thai. The food can be great, which I will get to later, but I think what distinguishes Archi's from most restaurants in Las Vegas is their interior. They have done a brilliant job transforming a strip mall space into a warm, clean and welcoming space. There is a coherent sense of design, which puts me at ease for some reason. Maybe it just makes me feel like Archi has a good handle on things. 

And he does! After being a little Thai adventurous and eating all around town, I can confidently say that when the food is good it is really good. Granted, they do suffer from inconsistency from time to time, and their spice scale baffles me. A 3 can be mind-blowingly hot despite the fact that the scale supposedly goes to 10. Consider yourself warned. 

Despite that, when I want curry or Pad Kee Mow or a very respectable eggplant dish, I am happy to visit Archi's. The tofu in their stir-fry and noodle dishes is not the most flavorful, but I was obsessed with their Pad Kee Mow for at least a month. I became a little frustrated when the vegetable selection kept changing. How hard is it to give a girl a solid helping of real vegetables (baby corn does not count) with her noodles? However, on my last visit, I told the waitress ""lots of yummy vegetables please"", and apparently that is the secret phrase to unlock garden delight because I got mega-veggies. Splendid!

The service has always been no-water-glass-empty amazing when I have visited. Food comes out quickly and hot. Servers are always nice.

I was teetering between a 3 and a 4 for Archi's, but Archi, I am slapping a 4 on your establishment because although the food is a little inconsistent, I really really appreciate the atmosphere, cleanliness and service, and when the curry stars align, the food is definitely fan worthy.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,9,4,wj6qjW-PIAs4FLIuPfDV6g

I love spicy food and let me tell ya, 7 is pushing it but I've tried 8 and while it is very spicy, you can still taste well enough to enjoy the dish. So far everything I've tried has been delicious from Pork Phad Thai to their Tofu soup to Tom Kha Shrimp. If I had anything bad to say about Archi's it would be that their fried rice is mediocre, I've most definitely had better fried rice before, but its not terrible- just bland.  Make sure to try the Thai Tea with your meal- DELICIOUS! :)

Definitely recommend if you're feeling Thai and you're nearby. You don't gotta jump into your car to drive through the creation for. Kid and stroller friendly!

I love that I can ask them to make my food without all the sugar, and they actually do it (unlike some restaurants that say they will, and make the same thing they always do).   The atmosphere in here is great, so eating in is always nice.  Take-out is always packed very carefully.  I've never had an order mix-up, or a leaky container. 
The only issue I have with Archi's is that they don't seem to give you as much rice as other places.  If you order some curry, you get a box of rice.  If you order two curries, or a curry, and a tom kha gai, you still only get one box of rice.  I sometimes end up having to make more at home, which kind of negates the whole take-out thing.  I'll just have to remember to ask for more before I leave next time.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,0,1,4,h5KVz6HrRwzRujl5xGsHKg

The restaurant has a nice and open layout. A good amount of space between tables. The waitress and servers were nice and attentive.

- the drunken noodles was delicious. I usually order this in most Thai restaurants and this is probably the best I have had in Vegas (so far). I personally don't like Thai food that is towards the sweet side, and this was definitely very savory with a nice light basil flavor. There were lots of vegetables like mushrooms, baby corn, and green beans. The spice level was up there, so if you don't like spicy food, I recommend ordering much below a 6.

- spicy basil with pork was an above average dish. It came with a tiny bowl of rice. With all of the sauce, I was hoping there would be more rice. The dish comes with ground meat, and we requested sliced pork instead and they accommodated us without any problems. There is a soy sauce, basil, stir fry flavor. I would probably try something else off the menu next time.

So I decided to check out Rising Sun Sushi, which is supposedly located in the same strip mall (sign is still up), but after driving around the entire strip mall and not seeing any sign of Rising Sun and finding Archi's Thai Cafe next to the movie theater I decided to check out their dinner menu.

The restaurant itself looks nice, the dining area is split into 2 sections (at least), as I was directed to a corner table in the smaller more secluded dining section closest to the parking lot.  I was hoping to be seated in the main area, but whatever.  They have a few waitresses and 1 waiter, and I am not sure if they take turns in getting customers/tables, but I ended up with the waiter that still have a lot to learn about getting better at being a waitperson in a restaurant. If the number of guestcheck holders in their apron is a direct count of the number of tables they are currently assigned, then I would say he has 3 tables to look after while I was there, and he was overwhelmed with just those 3 tables.  After I ordered and the food was served (by a different waitress), he did not come by to check up on the table until I was practically done eating, and it took forever (at least 5 minutes, but most likely not more than 10 minutes) to have him come by again to pick up the money.  This while at least 10 people were eying me sitting there waiting, while they wait for a table to be freed up so they can get seated and order some food.

Anyway, moving on to the food.  I have tried the curries before, and I thought about trying something new.  Sukiyaki (Thai Style) was what i ended up ordering, and I was thinking a Japanese Sukiyaki with Thai ingredients.  Completely wrong imagery!  What I ended up with was a bowl of Thai noodle soup that I remember eating at one of the street food vendors when I was a kid in Bangkok.  The flavor was the same as what I vaguely remembered. It was served piping hot (good), with lots of vegetables (sure why not), a lot of pieces of chicken and 2 shrimps, plus a side of chili paste (cool, you can adjust how spicy you want).  But still I thought that item was overpriced for what it really is, and I will not order it again.

The Thai Iced Coffee is still large, and I think is worth the price of admission, and still very enjoyable.  I sometimes feel like just ordering that to go, if I am too lazy to shop at one of the Asian supermarket that sells them premade in cans or as a mix.

Overall:
Service: 2/5
Food: 3.3/5
Price: 2/5 (For their Sukiyaki - Thai Style)
Atmosphere: 4/5

My usual go to items are the pat kee mow (stir-fried wide noodle), basil fried rice, red curry, green curry, or koowakai (also stir-fried wide noodle but with chicken/squid and a side of dipping sauce). 
I prefer their pork over chicken/beef because it is always tender with the right amount of marination. I even took my parents here and it soon became my dad's favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. He really likes their pad cha cha cha which is a seafood stir fry.  

So why is this place a 4 star to me instead of 5? 
I understand that this place is a popular spot in Vegas and is always packed during dinner time. However their service will go down drastically during their busy hours.

Pad thai was mediocre to say the least-had no tofu, the noodles tasted of shrimp (never tasted that before) and it was spicy after i specifically said ""no spice"". Service was below an ""eh"" but above ""awful"". I asked for extra napkins and instead of responding he walks away so my friend asked if he heard me. I waited to see what he would do before i said anything and he ended up walking to a station to get napkins...is it that difficult to say ""sure"" or ""yes""? Not the worst thai place but i will definitely be visiting OSHA in San Fran next month!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,0,0,3,CYykOCs-Xnq0rR1zr-j1qQ

Last couple trips here it seems the soup and entrees come out very close to each other. I would prefer to eat the soup before the entree arrives. 
But a solid meal everytime.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,4,BNHZmIFMkDu5T6ShEM0zOQ

The service was less than okay. Our waitress only would come by to drop off our drinks, soup, and meal. She never stopped by to ask how we were or if we needed a refill.",5bI67_CVxFy8PPL7E3BLqw,1,2,3,hT3KzBJq46KBA3VzQbNA7A

We just don't come if we are in a hurry or we get take out. Can't compare it to other Thai, because we are always pleased and don't feel the need to go elsewhere.",_2rRSDaeAmn3v4YOaS1PLg,0,0,5,5dI83m_tWm6EbKkeTRgQyA

My husband and I ordered takeout at 5:30 this evening and was told the food will be ready for pick up in 25 minutes. We arrived at 5:55 and they had us pay for the bill. I waited until 6:30 before my takeout was ready. During my wait I asked the girl, why is it taking so long? She replied that she wasn't the person who took my order over the phone and she would've told me it was a 45 minute wait.  First, I'd like to point out at this restaurant they make sure to take your money before they even begin cooking your food. That's why we waited 35 minutes after we got there...unacceptable. We finally get our food which was overstuffed and piled to the very top of a plastic bag. We had to take some of the food containers out and place them in a second bag. I ordered ginger ginger ginger chicken not spicy. They didn't even get that right. I had to throw it in the garbage because it was so spicy and there was red pepper sprinkled all over the top of the dish. Then we opened the fried wonton container and the wontons were hard as a rock and tasted like they were fried in burned oil. We ordered Thai toast and that was hard and tasted like it was cooked in old oil. They wasted my time and money:( 
I went to bed upset and hungry:(",YVzCfCmtxIerxa7uNNuO8w,0,0,1,v0OIiOvRFFy7YNhkr3Pbag

We eventually gave up before walking two does down to Bachi Burger. I decided to give it another try. I have to say, both food and service are unimpressive at best. I will not be returning.",opg5Cl7qTQhB-GDKvrmzyg,7,5,2,dPZRHwp1bG0w_lseo-2OBQ
