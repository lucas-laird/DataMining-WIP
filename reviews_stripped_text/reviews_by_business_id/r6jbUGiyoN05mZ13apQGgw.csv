My son wanted to eat there after school so we went & were the only patrons in there on monday jan 30th at 4 pm. While we are eating the latino cook sits at the table behind me & proceeds to talk to the guy working the front counter. Every other word out of his mouth was the F BOMB!!! I turned around after hearing about the tenth F BOMB and sternly asked him to stop swearing & that I was under the impression this was a family restaurant & not a sports bar!! I couldn't believe that not even the front counter guy deemed this inappropriate!! I asked him if he failed to see the child dining with me!!",h4w6AhswqV8u90OMobuISA,0,0,4,6_dpkI1JAPjfLjAPc_cUeg

405004,2015-06-07,0,r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw,"Well we are regulars at Mama D's. We decided to go for an early dinner on Saturday evening. We usually order pasta dishes, but this time we decided to try one of their famous pizzas. When the waiter came over to the table, I told him I wanted a pizza with Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Feta Cheese, Garlic and a few other items, I Also Pointed to the list of the ingredients on the menu, to show him exactly what I wanted. We ordered a large. When the pizza arrived, we looked at it and we didn't see any of the items/ingredients we had asked for. The only thing on the pizza were large mounds of mozzarella cheese, two or three tiny slivers of garlic and the smallest pieces of basil i had ever seen, so small you couldn't even taste any basil flavor. 
I told the waiter this wasn't what we ordered. He said, ""Yes you did"". I said, No, I asked for, and I mentioned all the ingredients that I had previously told him we wanted. He said well that's not the pizza you pointed to. That's a different one! So, then  my husband said, why don't you adjust the bill and give us the $16.99 deal price of 1 large, 1 topping pizza and two small salads, due to this being your mistake and bring us two salads. NO, No, No they wouldn't do it.  The pizza they brought to our table wasn't even hot and wasn't what we ordered. This is the difference between right and wrong. When the customer orderers something specifically, they should get why they order. We were hungry and didn't feel like waiting another half hour for another pizza.
If a customer/guest specifically states the ingredients they want on a pizza, the waiter as a professional, should write down all the ingredients they just mentioned and say, Oh here's the name of the specialty pizza you want. BEING THAT WE ARE (WERE)NOT ANYMORE)  REGULARS, THEY SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO MAKE US HAPPY AND SAVE A CUSTOMER..... THEY DID NOT! 
We will never go back to Mama D's. 
*By the way, the menu descriptions, prices and sizes of the pizzas are not clearly laid out on the menu. The name of the pizza should be on top in bold, with the list of ingredients below it and then the price and sizes. Mama D's should offer us a voucher for $20.00 to come back and give them one more try.....AS FOR NOW, WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN, NOT GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE.

In the past year the food quality has gone down drastically. We always order to go, and I've gotten home and orders have been completely wrong. Items have been forgotten or made incorrectly. Also, their french fries are horrible now. That was one of my favorite items to get with the chicken fingers or sandwiches. But they changed the way they do their french fries and now they're always greasy and limp. I have ordered them 3-4 times since they've changed, and they're just gross. I asked the cashier if they would ever go back to their old fries and he said no. I haven't been back since then. I went from eating there 2-3 times a month, to maybe 1 time in the past 6 months.

1st: they stated  that they were  short staff so they got the new trainee taking my  order and it takes  forever.  After I got home I call and change my order, more stuff, which was a mistake.  It literally takes 30 mins.  Next day I call to give them the exact time that I'm  going to pick up my food, they said  that they  were confused  with my order.  After 30 mins to order yesterday they still messed  it up and no one bother to call me to verify  the order, until I call them.  
2nd: when I pick up my order no one show any appreciation  for my business, not a thank  you after I paid. When I got my food, they didn't  even  ask if we needed  set up or help to bring out the food.  Nothing  was said by anyone  accept  stared to see who comes  to get their food off on top the deserts fridge. I decided to put the tip back in my purse.  They did not deserve it.  Again no thank you for the business.  The food was heavy and no hand to open the door.  I had to push the door open with my back, almost drop the foods.  I look at 3 worker to see if anyone  can at least hold the door open for me, everyone  look down and ignoring  me.  I managed  to load up all my food.  
3rd: the food was horrible.   I was embarrassed to serve it to my staff and had to spend  more noney and order from somewhere  else.  Pizza was the worst I have ever seen and had, frozen pizza looks and taste better at this point. It Looks like days  old pizza.  I order a full tray of lasagna  and it end up in the trash.  It was dry, no sauce, no cheese just  little on top, pasta was dry and tough  and rubbery chewy. 
I like their pizza in the past  but no more.  This is the last  time  that I order from them.  Cici's pizza foods are lot better across  the street.  My advice  is do not order food to go from here.  They don't  care as long that you are willing to paid.  Bad Bad Bad business management.",stmCU4mPgJbUnIsBxOf1Qw,0,0,1,JSIKrtGrpBK8iC67PD37lg

1007172,2006-08-25,0,r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw,"After a grotesquely long day of manual labor and dealing with people who wouldn't be able to decide whether they would rather be burned alive, buried alive, or go on a date with Angelina Jolie, my stomach is nagging at me as my mother used to while I was in high school.

Luckily I have received a request to find some place to eat for five of us, me and four other ""men"" (I thought women got all the blame for indecisiveness?). Something inexpensive. Something within one mile of the house. Something that will please all of us. In other words, something that possibly might not exist.

The five of us slumped into a small space that claimed itself as the authentic New Jersey pizza joint. Proof? There's two: a vanity NJ license plate that says ""SOPRANOS"" and a full-sized Sopranos poster to entertain you on your way to the bathroom.

We ordered the first pizza listed on the menu, the ""bada-bing"", and requested it Sicilian style. But one pizza is not enough for the five of us. A ""not-from-New-Jersey chicken ranch"", 16 inches please. 

Apparently no one at the table except me has ever eaten pizza containing ranch dressing before. To eat one of those, you must 1) like ranch and 2) like LOTS of it. It came to the table just oozing of the heavenly rich smell of ranch. Unfortunately the ranch was not evenly spread out, so it took a couple of slices for me to get to the gooey goodness. Great New York style thin and foldable slices, soft and chewy dough, and lots and lots of good ol' grease. Top that with a pitcher of beer and... 

Wait a minute, this isn't Vegas, this is a college town! Yes! They've got greasy pizza, lots of it, with lots of beer, and cheap price deals for them. A place that has pride in their pizza, rightfully so, believes that it is more entertaining for guests to listen to the radio while watching television at the same time, and the Sopranos is just the icing on the cake.

The Sicilian had a very crispy finish, which is not to my taste but people ate plenty of it nonetheless. It was piled high with the ""bada-bing"" toppings, but my joy was in the ranch pizza. 

It is close by, it is not pretty, it has lots of greasy food. I ate till I felt sick. Definitely not tourist-friendly. And it has all my love. If it was open later than 11pm, it would be perfect.",mvH7LLr26Wj3STZeBdi7Jg,2,1,4,6f_GDVjreBj6zKGDYy6TEQ

The food is good, but between wrong orders, late orders, and delivery guys trying to run off with our money assuming they were getting a 50% tip (really??), it's not good enough to put up with the absolute shit service. 

Tonight, however, is our straw to break the camel's back and we will not be customers at this establishment any long (a shame, since we live just a couple blocks away so it's mighty convenient). We've been giving them 2nd chances for over a year for the sake of convenience and supporting a local business. 

Tonight's mistakes: 
*Our pizza was 1 hour and 20 minutes late. Why? The delivery boy delivered our pizza two houses down. After my husband watched the first house turn him away, once we had realized what was happening with our order, the delivery boy then started walking to the next house in the OPPOSITE direction from ours. Genius staff, this place. 
*He dropped the sodas after being hunted down, which then turned out to be the wrong sodas from what we ordered
*They forgot our side order of ranch
*There were mushrooms on our strictly pepperoni pizza
*The pizza was cold
*When confronted with our complaint over the phone, the staff tried to lie about how long it actually took. Trust us, we were watching very carefully. 

When all was said and done.... We were offered 15% off our next pizza.

I used to be a regular customer for take out pizzas and salads ( which are not cheap by any stretch of the imagination ) compared to similar spots in town. 
    One night when I was going in 40 minutes before closing time I opened he door to the stench of dirty mop and table rag water which almost made me vomit. I asked out of courtesy if they were still serving food right now even though they were clearly open, but seemed to have ""cleaned up"" by spreading germs and making the establishment smell awful.
    After I asked about ordering food the lady who seemed to be in charge behind the counter as rudely and with a massive tone of annoyance pretty much screamed at me ""well what do you want to order?"" 
    After I told her the regular what I wanted she rolled her eyes at me and said that they were all out of the ingredients to make a pizza which seemed like a blatant lie to get me out of there and lose a customer.
   After politely saying that it was no problem. And that I didn't want to get in the way of them closing, she continued to be extremely hostile to me with such a nasty tone of voice making feel terrible for even entering the building to provide business to a local establishment.
    Way to lose me and the every person I will ever talk with to avoid this place at all costs, all it takes is one nasty person and substandard grade C health violations to create such a bad name for your restaurant.
    True to my word, I have never returned and many potential customers have been warned of this incident as promised.

It could use a little more sauce, it's a little dry but still tasty. We usually get a side of sauce with it. 
Their pizzas are good but any of the meat pizzas are a tad greasy for my liking. If you look at the photos you'll see a pepperoni pizza soaked in grease. I wish I could eat it but I'll be awake at 1AM with a heart burn. I won't make that mistake a third time. 
Calzones are good too but by the time you add all of the toppings you want it gets pricey. 
I love garlic knots but theirs is also too greasy. I'll indulge in one every now and then because they are good. 
My favorite food from there is the spinach salad. Not with chicken because the chicken is bland. I now order without. 
The Hot wings are okay. I'm still looking for a place that serves hot meaning SPICY wings. Their hottest wings are like a medium. My tolerance for spicy is pretty high. 
Pasta is okay. I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and I got spaghetti noodles instead of Fettuccine noodles. Maybe they were out of Fettuccine that day. I called them to let them know. 
I'll definitely order from here again on my lazy days and when I can afford it. Their food is good overall. It's convenient because they deliver to my area. Now if I'm going to drive out for pizza I'll go to Grimaldi's.",D14Cva_AOyyBab1hPXkALw,1,0,3,dd3yIm7qPs80_yLS3Pj4YA

About another 5/10 min went by and then I went to check and they said it's almost ready but the 24""pizzas in the oven (for delivery mind you) add taking all the space (this was very disappointing to me because wouldn't you let your customer know that when they place there order? !.

We were actually on our way to Teriyaki Madness when we saw that this place was right next door. From the moment we walked in my daughter and I were treated VERY WELL. We walked up to the counter and asked if we were dining in or taking out. We figured we'd dine in. So we were asked to take a table anywhere we wanted and that someone would be right up to help us. A very nice young lady came up to us and handed us each a menu. She immediately took our drink orders all the while with a smile from ear to ear. They have a great selection of food with a good description of what comes with each item. We asked for a recommendation and were told that the meatballs were made fresh so she recommended any dish that would contain meatballs. My daughter had the chicken Alfredo I had the spaghetti with meatballs. A minute or two later we had complimentary garlic knots and house salads brought to our table. They waited for us to finish our salads before bringing out our main dishes. They were piping hot!. Kudos! There was a family ambiance there and you could see the other patrons with smiles on their faces. The prices were very reasonable. We went home with plenty of leftovers. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because the food was a bit bland. Yes, the meatballs were ""homemade"" but lacked in flavor as well as the garlic knots. There was water at the bottom of my bowl of spaghetti which tells me the noodles were not drained properly. But for customer service alone, I would return to this place again and again.

The Food is Very Hot & Very Good...
Garlic Knots- Enough for 2 People, Comes to You Hot and Buttery with the Marinara Dipping Sauce.

Pizza- the Small Size, Again Enough for 2-3, Cheese is Gooey & Stringy, Very Tasty (Just How I Like it) not Greasy, or Soggy like some Places! 5.99

Chicken Wings- Comes with French Fries & a Drink for 6.99. Crispy & Tasty! I Ordered the Garlic Parmesan....Yum!! 

Free Refills on the Soda Machine! 

They do have Lunch Specials, They Do have Take Out!

For $6 I believe you can get 6 wings, a slice of pizza, and a soda.  That's a pretty good deal my friends!

On my particular trip I got broccoli and cheese soup served in a sourdough bowl.  The soup is $4.50 I believe and the extra charge for the sourdough bowl was $2.50.  Soup was good; it was thick without being too thick.  The sourdough was good, not as good as BJ's, but still quite excellent.  Decent sized serving.  The soup with the bowl was plenty of food to fill my belly.

I didn't try the pizza, but it looked kind of gross.  The sort of pizza you get in the elementary school cafeteria.  Greasy thin crust and whatnot.  The wings looked good, and my friend I dined with says he enjoyed them.

I had a taste of my friend's fries.  Yum.  A bit crispy on the outside, but still thick enough to taste the the potato on the inside.  Perfect.  Usually, crispiness comes at the price of not tasting potato, but this place was able to pull it off.

Service was really good.  Anytime my soda began to get low it was promptly filled back up.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,1,1,4,3idCktT3Fn3M53mV5vcaEw

 Once the pizza was soggy and uncooked in the middle.  They also did not bring the parm cheese and crushed peppers I asked for. I called,  they brought me a new pizza and took the old one. It was a mediocre pizza and kind of bland. I thought that maybe they were busy or had a new cook.

The next time I asked them for crushed peppers and parm cheese packets ( I alway ask for this)I stressed how it was important it was. They said they would put it on the ticket.  Pizza showed up with no peppers and cheese packets and I saw on my receipt it was on there.  So they said they would be back in a few minutes with it. We waited an hour and they never showed. Pizza was cold and soggy by this time. OMG, don't say I will be right back and never show up! 

I gave them another try a week later. (I love pizza) Same thing!  No crushed peppers and cheese packets!  This time they came back in 10 minutes with it. It was on the ticket! So why not have extra in the car? At least this time the delivery guy came back. The pizza was a bit bland but ok. 

 Ok, tonight I ordered a gourmet pizza. I figured I might have better luck with their house specialities. This pizza is supposed to have FRESH basil and fresh mozzarella according to the description on the menu.   The pizza was 90% tomato sauce that tasted like cheap canned spaghetti sauce and katsup.  The cheese was so minimal. It was a pizza crust with tons of tomato sauce on cracker and a few little chunks of cheese. The fresh basil as they stated in the gourmet pizza description was not fresh at all. They sprinkled a little dried basil or maybe parsley on the pizza. I don't know because there was no basil flavor let alone ""fresh basil"".  When I see FRESH basil on the menu, I sort of expect it. Epic fail on the so called gourmet pizza. Keep your katsup cracker!

 The pizza is just not good anymore.  In general,  it's bland and there is little care in preparation. There is little care and a lot of mistakes on the delivery side as well. I have given this place a lot of chances because their service and food was good for years. No it was really good. I feel terrible about posting this but I gave this place so many chances to make it up. I didn't post after a single bad experience but after several consecutive experiences that left a bad taste in my mouth.

4654977,2016-03-06,4,r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw,"In Bob Dylan's words, ""The times they are A-changin."" For New York transplants these are great times for pizza and eggplant parmesain fans. It seemed that a few years ago that I'd have to fly to New York to relive the delicious pizza and heroes that I grew up with. Now that it seems that Las Vegas is in a close tie with Broward County, Florida for Sixth Borough of New York status, I only have to drive a few miles from the 215 Beltway to enjoy delectable New York pizza and eggplant parmesain heroes, which is called subs in other parts of the country. 

    Recently I gave Mama DePalma's a try. The backstory is that the DePalmas  created delicious Italian food that they imported to Las Vegas when they moved here. The backstory implies that Grandma DePalma's legacy lives on with their food. I can say that her legacy also lives on with another positive review saluting her recipe. 

   Mama DePalmas is so close yet so far away from the New York kitchen where her recipe originated. Mama DePalmas is situated off a palm tree-lined Maryland Parkway in an Albertson's anchored shopping center at the southwest corner of Silverado Ranch Road. Because the back of the business faces the thoroughfare, it is easy to pass by. 

   As soon as I entered the restaurant, the friendly woman at the counter welcomed me into the restaurant with a smile. In a few minutes I'd be greeting the eggplant parmesain hero on toasted bread with a smile. After exchanging around $13 for an eggplant parmesain hero with fries and a fountain drink, I sat myself at the table. A couple of minutes later, she brought the glass of Coke to my table. A few minutes further, Mama DePalmas recipe was in good hands, which were mine holding a fork and knife. 

    The eggplant parmesain hero on toasted bread is making me hungry thinking about it. Between the two pieces of toasted bread was a stuffed portion of eggplant covered with the mouth watering warm parmesain cheese. Mama DePalmas did not skimp out on the portion. When I dine on an eggplant parmesain hero, I want the experience to be slower than molasses. The tasty fries were the dining speed bumps that slowed down the temptation to speed through this precious food. Regardless it had to end. 

    What is better than Mama DePalmas? Two Mama DePalmas in the Las Vegas valley. It makes me happy to learn that there is a Mama DePalmas closer to me across from the Galleria Mall. I really see a future check-in happening here in the future to put their eggplant parmesain hero on toasted bread to the test.

To our surprise it was not what we ordered. I phoned the restaurant and spoke with the manager who apologized and said they would be putting it in the oven right then and would have the next delivery driver send it out. A hour and a half later, and no pizza. Phoned the restaurant again, spoke with a lady who had no idea what we were referring too. After speaking to the manager AGAIN, he informed us that it just came out the oven and would be on the way. Apparently they had made the pizza wrong again. (This was one of their specialty pizzas as well, it's not like we were ordering a difficult pizza). And since when did it take a hour and a half to cook a pizza?

Craving some pizza and decided to try something different from the usual Grimaldi's, it was good. 

the ingredients were tatsy, the pies were priced right, and cook right. 

What was it missing, the crust was good but not greats, it was thin but dense, NY crusts should be thin chewy with a little rise to them though or chewy crispy not too dry. This was neither but still good, also the garlic in white pizza was not even, bite into pockets of no flavor and then explosions of garlics on other spots. 

Forogt about the service, OK pretty hard for me to give a bad review on service when I am only picking it up but you got one. 

Girl at the front was taking an order on the phone and helping someone at the register at the same time, she was spit off stuff and the people inside didnt know if she was talking to them or the person on the phone. The people inside said they were ""impressed"" what they should of said was annoyed, dont encourage bad bahaviors. 

I would of been more impressed is she just said "" give me a moment to finish up..."" People at the store should have priorty over the phone.",C7xugvjzMhmPkADOEGkQdw,1,0,3,hMCisP4ksQBvqNk8ZUyKfg

Slight stomach discomfort is a small price to pay for ricotta, mozzarella, and garlic. So simple, but my groups go to for years. The Health Nut Veggie should not be overlooked either. It is loaded with morsels of fresh and fried delights that sets it apart from other joints. If the artichokes, olives, peppers and onions are not enough. They put slivers of fried eggplant on it.

These guys are legit though. Straight out of Jersey. Want proof? Order the diner fries. A big metal tin full of thick-cut fries (not steak fries mind you) smothered in brown gravy and cheese. It's not exactly poutine but the concept is the same. Back in the Newj we'd call these ""disco fries"" because they're the perfect food to eat when it's 2:30 in the morning and you've got a stomach full of Belmar booze.

The pizzas are good but the crust isn't as chewy as I'd prefer. The toppings, however, are top notch and there is one pizza here that is really standout. It's the Pop's Pesto pie, topped with grilled chicken, artichokes, pesto, garlic and tomatoes. (ProTip: skip the tomatoes for a sturdier pie.).

The stromboli is another good choice, packed with Italian cold cuts and cheese but somehow not as deafeningly salty as these things can be.

Not the best pizza in the valley but a solid choice - especially if you prefer the cracklier style of crust.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,4,872Vm152p0rTrYyYB1fqiQ

The garlic parmesan is a dry seasoning which was good and not overpowering. The teriyaki was my favorite out of the two flavors, a lot of the time teriyaki on wings can be overpowering and either too sweet or too salty these were nice and lightly flavored just enough to compliment the flavor of the wing itself. The fries were decent nothing special, the ranch was a good ranch it had the pizza parlor taste to it. The zeppolis are awesome I looooove zeps so good, I used to get them all the time as a kid at the San genarro festival when it used to be at the Rio back in the day.
