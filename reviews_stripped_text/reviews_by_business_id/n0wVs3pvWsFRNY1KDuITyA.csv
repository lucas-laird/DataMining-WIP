1225626,2018-02-26,1,n0wVs3pvWsFRNY1KDuITyA,"This Little McDonald's is a terrible, terrible McDonald's. It is so sad. I went to this McDonald's location. It was both my first time and my last time eating there. First of all, they have a sign that says ""Restroom for customers only."" As far as I am concerned, anyone who comes in the door is a potential customer. This sign is petty and selfish. I understand the need to lock the restrooms but this sign is heartless and unacceptable. Other McDonald's locations just lock the restrooms and give the customer a key and don't allow bags if there is a homeless population nearby. That is how it should be done at this location. I know it may be legal and their right to put up this sign. They need to be reminded that it is also legal and my right not to go to this McDonald's anymore because of this sign. It is my right to give this McDonald's a bad review because of it. There is nothing that this Little McDonald's can do about it. I have NEVER seen a sign like this at another McDonald's location. The soda machine is behind the counter. It is very inconvenient to get a soda this way. In addition, I ordered a plain hamburger. I specifically said that the hamburger should have nothing but the bun and the burger. I am not sure if the person who makes the food misunderstood the order or was simply thinking about his/her dream house and personal life. Anyway, they put cheese on the plain hamburger. A hamburger with cheese is not a hamburger. It is a cheeseburger. Perhaps the person who made the food is simply too stupid and incompetent to understand the difference. They also took around 10 minutes to complete the order and they still managed to get it wrong. I was actually impressed with their ability to screw up at this point. They are very good at screwing up. The person who made the food should receive a coaching. If he/she continues to mess the orders up, then he/she should receive progressive discipline. If he/she still continues to mess up, then he/she should be terminated with an ""ineligible for rehire"" status or transferred to another job at McDonald's. The manager of this McDonald's location should be terminated and not be eligible for rehire. The manager should be escorted off the property immediately to his/her vehicle by higher management and the McDonald's HR department. In fact, this Little McDonald's is such a terrible location that they should just shut down this location altogether. I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS LITTLE MCDONALD'S LOCATION AGAIN!!! IT IS A BAD MCDONALD'S!!! THERE IS NO HOPE!!!!!!!!!!",5a9apMBuq4BfCiEU_6kjeQ,1,0,1,Yww_yDsh_MmhjHQXRHIyDA

I hope you don't mind being panhandled while you eat or having someone in the booth behind you coughing on your neck. 
Don't expect the employees here to get your order with any sort of expediency, because they are busy handing out free cups of water or refilling the same soda cup that was dug out of the trash .
