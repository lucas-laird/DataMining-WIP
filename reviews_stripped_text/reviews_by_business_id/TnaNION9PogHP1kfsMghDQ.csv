421799,2013-04-20,0,TnaNION9PogHP1kfsMghDQ,"Now I know what all the chatter is about. Why can't all sandwich places be like this?! Capriotti's is simply in a different league. Sure the price is a little higher (About $8 for 9"") and the wait a little longer, but this is due to the quality of ingredients and preparation. This spot in Town Square is fairly new and it was packed around 2 on a weekday. The seating area is limited, a few tables and a counter with bar stools facing the window.

On to the food itself...Let's begin with the bread. It is sooo soft and fresh. Just lightly toasted. It's still warm when you unwrap your sub, unlike other places that slop the meat on a cold bun and call it good. I went with the Italian Sausage sandwich with hot peppers and wow, flavor explosion! The meat is grilled to perfection and still very tender. One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. I'll probably be a regular here.",lALW6UN3fU2DRaiMzH9kMg,2,0,5,JdLf-tMKIBxKrxM5SAzn-Q

I used to get the Italian subs growing up but in most recent years have become vegetarian, almost vegan. So when they introduced their veggie options I was excited. Being able to enjoy some of their signature sandwiches is a huge plus! This location at Town Square mall was cool. Yard house happy hour wasn't gonna happen and we beat the dinner rush and grabbed a sandwich. The staff was really nice for young adults. You know how the kids these days can be... so good customer service was a nice change! We got the veggie burger that was quite good and the cole veggie turkey. Both hit the spot.

Apparently they couldn't tell that earlier. Then they turned off the drink machine at 7:25 so we couldn't get refills. When we asked what time they closed they said 8. When we asked if we could get refills they said no because they were ""pre-closing"".

When I did eventually go back later that year, I lost the card(doh!) but I still went to get a sandwich here.  Personally out of all the sandwiches I tried, I personally like the Bobbie the best which is turkey, cranberry, and stuffing.  I also had tried the Capastrami and the SlawBe Joe which was pastrami and roast beef respectively.  However, both of these sandwiches have cole slaw in them...not a sandwich that can keep for a couple of days.  I ate half of the Bobbie the day I ordered it and ate the rest the next day without refrigeration.  Still tasted good!  Any sandwich that can taste as good as the day you bought it, wins oodles of points in my book.

It is unfortunate that the first reader did not have a good experience, because I have only had terrific experiences. Capirotti's serves several great sandwiches, but the highlight of this place is a sandwich called ""The Bobbie"", which is a Thanksgiving feast of turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing on a tasty sandwich roll. Other winners include ""Slaw Be Jo"" (roast beef, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo) and a tasty eggplant parmesan sandwich, which is one of many vegetarian choices. The only negative is that there are not a lot of places to sit, which can be a problem during the heart of the lunch rush. Service is friendly and prices run from about $6 for a small (9"") sandwich, to $11 for a huge (20"") sandwich which can be easily shared.

This was my first time at Capriotti's and I am pretty disappointed because everyone tells me that it's the best sandwich they have ever had.. Me thinks not.

The cashier was completely ice cold towards me while I was ordering and only spoke to me wwwwwwheeeeeen: I finished ordering and gave her my card to swipe. When she handed it back and said nothing, I started walking away to sit down at a nearby table. Immediately, she raises her voice and says ""HEY! YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS FIRST!"" Maybe it is because I have been in customer service for so long that something like this pisses me off, but that's not how you address customers. If it's a big deal, wait until the receipt is done printing, and THEN hand my card back at the same time saying ""Will you please sign that receipt for me as well?"" 

I ordered the Roast Beef without onion and added mayo. To my surprise, the roast beef was shredded.. I've never had it shredded before when I have ordered from other places? And the big bummer was that the roast beef was very very dry. The bread was okay, but it was on the colder side. I didn't know if I had the option for it to be toasted when I ordered or if it's served like this, but the cashier could have cared less.

4451859,2013-06-26,2,TnaNION9PogHP1kfsMghDQ,"Well this is a place that despite its oddly arranged seating and small space is going to do well at Town Square. I honestly cannot remember what was here before Capriotti's, but can we really remember many of the unmemorable, poorly thought out, and down-right bad places that have opened up at Town Square? The place seems cursed, save for Yard House. BUT I believe Capriotti's WILL survive, if only based on the fact it is a chain that delivers good food and it is a name that will have people flock to it no matter what.

I happened upon Cap's while I was shopping today and had two things in mind. 1. Getting some food and 2. Escaping the heat. I wandered to Cap's and entered. The place is tiny and cramped. There is bar seating and a few tables. No matter how busy this place gets, it is not going to hold many people, but I've noticed that about a lot of Capriotti's - small places, limited seating.

I received the Capastrami (Small) and a small fountain drink, which I had to shimmy to the back of the place to fill up. There is room for exactly one person in front of the soda machine so be prepared to wait if the place is busy. 

My sandwich came out quickly and was delicious as usual. Cap's uses the finest meats and the best ingredients, that's why their sandwiches taste so good (save for a burnt Philly Cheese Steak I had once). 

If I'm in Town Square and need a quick bite, this will probably now be my go-to. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is again, the tiny space and the necessity to squeeze around people to get to the soda fountain.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,4,z5YPJWEZoTIulxOF6vuexA

Not only did the sandwich taste bad but hot food has to be served at least at 160 degrees and this wasn't near that temperature.

Not only do they have Subs and sandwiches but they also offer salads, soups, desserts, and chips. None of which I've personally tired. Do want to note that when I was here last, they asked me if I wanted bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms and I said yes to the mushrooms not knowing that it wasn't a ""freebie"", so I was charged an extra fee for it.

When you walk in, you can swear it's the same restaurant as not much has changed in the set up except the big board menu above the kitchen and ordering stations.  

The staff is super friendly.  They seemed to be as excited as I was to be there, and I hope that time does not take away that enthusiasm because I genuinely appreciated the sincere friendliness.  

I walked in at about 1pm on a Tuesday and there weren't very many people in here.  This is disturbing because I would HATE for them to suffer the same fate as Johnny Maguire's.  I'm hoping once more people realize they are here, they will come.  Build the sandwich, and they will come. 

Anyway, I ordered a small (9-inch) turkey with all the fixings.  In my excitement I had forgotten to tell her I was a mall employee, but to my pleasant surprise, she made sure to ask me before finishing the transaction.  I got a small discount, which I truly appreciated.  Then I waited for my sandwich.  The employee who was making sandwiches called out a couple other people's names and then saw that I was standing there still waiting.  He asked my name, and 2 minutes later my sandwich was ready, and to my surprise, a large instead of the small I had ordered.
