The pizza is awesome and despite the average casino it is in, please go and have a slice or three at Pop Up.

The pizza is still awesome, but I recommend asking for extra sauce these days, as the pies seem on drier side.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: So, I would like to leave a split review here. I love the pizza, but I am continually disappointed with the organizational abilities of this place. They seem to have a really difficult time understanding pizza orders beyond their signature pizzas, especially if you want some things on the whole pizza but also some different things on each half. Then tonight I tried to place an order for delivery, but no one answered the phone during the hour I tried calling. Thinking maybe they are just really busy, I tried their online ordering system. The order went in (and sent a charge to my credit card) and said the pizza would arrive in 45 minutes. An hour later I tried calling again to see if they got the order, but still no one answered. I called the hotel to try reaching them by their extension, but I only got voicemail. I left a message, requesting someone call me and confirm my pizza was coming. An hour after that (involving several more attempts to call them), I ordered a pizza from somewhere else. The whole situation is absurd. The pizza is really good, though.",Upz_9d58CqAmi6rMjPJPAw,3,0,3,MCtiIyenUYzlCoXu4nr8og

182530,2014-01-29,0,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"Out of all the pizza places in DTLV, I decided on Pop Up for our office lunch because of it's 4.5 star rating and the fact that they deliver when Papa Johns doesn't.

Our order ($53): 

2 pizzas
House Salad with ranch instead of Italian
4 extra ranch (charged extra for each)

Our order took an hour and 15 minutes to get to us, even though the Plaza is only 3 blocks away from our office. I probably could have walked to pick it up quicker than it was delivered. The pizza was...luke warm and the crust was very tough to bite through. It didn't taste awful, but it's not as good as the reviews made it out to be. The salad? It was tossed in Italian dressing and didn't even include any ranch on the side. And speaking of ranch dressing, we only got 3 out of the 4 we ordered!

The quality of food, lack of attention to our order and time it took to have it delivered were very disappointing. Definitely won't be ordering from here again.",QmkyZNoC6gQUfPYeMhnQBQ,0,0,2,bjq1miB_feHVkIXAdOWnQw

237608,2014-08-14,1,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"My boyfriend and I ate here last night for the second time. The first time I had the chicken tender basket and it was alright. It wasn't great; the seasoning was a little strange, but the chicken was very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. 

Pizza: Last night we had the pizza and it was delicious. My bf had the veggie pizza and he thought it was alright, nothing special though. I, however, had the pepperoni, mushroom and onion. It was very good. It had the right amount of greasiness, the cheese and the toppings were both very good and the thin crust was delicious and crispy. The crust was almost burnt but that's how I like it so I had no complaints. It was much better than the average pizza from the various, big delivery chains. 

The Price: the price was a little outrageous. For two slices, our bill came to about $9, which just seems a little crazy for pizza. It was great but I don't think it was THAT great. The slices are huge so that helped justify the price A LITTLE bit.

Overall, this place is really good. The pizza I had was a good size and tasted good. It was cooked perfectly too, when you'd bite into it, all of the cheese and toppings wouldn't come off in one huge, messy piece. I would definitely come back here and I would recommend this place if you have a craving for pizza and you're in or near the Plaza.

Update: today we had the buffalo wings and they were delicious. Especially for a place that doesn't specialize in wings. I could literally eat a vase full of them. Sooo good.",ABt6wlmgY2PSN6uMl6QLag,1,1,4,zQnQypOSiHxnqLOp_zbenQ

So I had to do a  quick order via phone since I was short on time and had to come up with something for a work potluck. I spoke to this chick who took my order and then transferred my call to the delivery guy to figure out delivery time.
They took my order, got my credit card information, but NEVER told me how much my order costed me. Initially when I asked they said they had to call me back in 15mins because they are not at the register or something. They called me back --still didn't tell me how much it costed me in their voicemail saying that I had to confirm the order so they could deliver it. So I called back to confirm the order and then when I asked how much the total was, the dude just kept on saying that he doesn't remember it on top of his head because he had already left the store.
Come to find out on upon delivery that 2 pizzas costed me over $50!!!! Ridiculous!
The dude just showed up with the 2 pizza boxes and the receipt of what they had charged on my card for me to sign.
I still went ahead and paid for it, but could not get over the fact that I feel so ripped off and scammed. My coworkers told me how crazy I was for still paying for it, but I told them, ""NEVER AGAIN"".
People who work at this place need to be trained more, for real.

We ordered 2 pizzas to go.  Bf was a little shocked by the price but I say whatev, we took away two 18"" pizzas to enjoy for the rest of the weekend.  I ordered a vegan cheese pizza with carmelized onions and olives.  It was great.  The crust was thin but the edge was thick and soft-chewy.  There was plenty of cheese and when you use a pizza oven the Dayia actually melts like cheese should rather then turn rubbery.  I would have preferred more onions but that's just me.  I think the olives were kalamata instead of canned black ones so I will skip those next time.  

Bf ordered his with onions, jalapenos and mushrooms.  He had the same positive comments about his crust and taste so I see more pieces of Pop Up Pizza being consumed in our future.  

A little bit more sauce would have been appreciated but I will defer to their pizza engineer expertise when it comes to sauce-crust-topping-ratios.  

Besides offering vegan cheese for me the other best part about this place is that the casino bar has $1 beer!  That's all I have to say about that.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,2,0,4,wBIKD-MPKPl6sG0mzQB7pw

HANDS DOWN, the BEST PIZZA money can buy on Fremont, if not Vegas.  Your experience might be different from mine but here's how it worked.
You see the pizza you want through the glass plus anything you see on their menu.  At first I thought they were going to cut out a slice from what has been sitting out in the open.  Instead, the four of us waited and received FRESH PIZZA SLICES from the oven, three different kinds of slices.  Were they amazing?  You bet your A$$ they were!  MAYBE it was because it was slow when we arrived, that might explain why they had the time to make fresh slices for us.  Who knows?  The service of course was friendly and warm welcoming.

The storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep...probably because it was EDC week. The workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking.

I got a slice of their White Chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers. The White Chapel is sooo goooood! The other one was tasty too, but I preferred the White Chapel despite the lack of meat. The slices are pretty big, and I really liked the crisp yet chewy crust.

Maybe it's because I waited so long, maybe quality has gone down, I have no idea. All I know is that tons of my Yelp friends raved about this place and slapped down five stars and I was a bit underwhelmed. 

Opted for the Newport (ricotta, artichoke, peppers, eggplant, spinach and mushrooms topped with a garlic infused olive oil) and the Soho (Vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, and roasted bell peppers)-- both were heated to order, boxed up to go, and helpfully accompanied by packets of peppers and cheese.

I found the Newport to only have a single dollop of ricotta, but liked the roasted veggies. Did not taste any garlic infused olive oil though, and I love garlic. The Soho simply taught me that I do not like vegan cheese- still appreciated the veggies though. BF's take on the slices were that he loved the crispy crust but felt the sauce was too acidic.

Unfortunately they do not take phone orders so we had to drive all the way from the strip, then place our order once we arrived, only to find out that the pizza chef was on a break and we'd have to wait for him to get back- about 20-30min for our pizza to be made.  We waited because we were already there and starving and too exhausted to go anywhere else.  The woman that took our order was also very sweet and apologetic!  

I was also bummed that they no longer offer the vegan soft serve which is still advertised on their menu.  I was really looking forward to trying it, and in all honesty, was the real reason I wanted to go there in the first place.

If you've never had vegan pizza or don't get to have it often, I recommend trying it.  It just wasn't  extremely amazing compared to others I've had (in LA).. Basic crust, veggies, diya cheese.  
But I must say that I'm grateful they offer vegan options!

First time, I thought the service was kind of slow (5 mins for a slice) but since I wasn't in any particular hurry it didn't matter.  The pizza was pretty good but pricey.  After today I'm never going back.  Incredible jerks who operate this place. Ordered a slice and then sat down.  Wait, wait, wait and then finally I go up to the counter and they don't even have the decency to come over and apologize for not making my order.  Guy behind the counter says ""give me 30 seconds"" as he shoves a slice in the oven.  Apparently I wasn't the only one they screwed over.  While he was discussing another botched order with a customer, he takes my slice out of the oven and then shoves it over the counter without a word as if I magically know that's for me.  Kinda service I'd expect in new york but not here.  If you don't care about your customers then go somewhere else.  

This time the pizza was pretty mediocre.  It wasn't hot, after 30 secs in the oven.  Crust was rubbery and the sauce tasted like out of a can.  Probably because had been sitting out all day and they reheated it.  Definitely not worth $5.  If you're from out of town don't waste your time and money eating at dumps like this.   Their pizzas look decent and maybe they're good when fresh but considering the service and the mediocre slices it's not worth trying again.   There's better places around town for pizza. 

BTW, the brunette behind the counter both times I've been there obviously hates her job and doesn't like dealing with people, or maybe she's a complete nit.  Since I live close I asked if they took phone orders and did they validate parking.   I'm not going to hassle with plaza parking and pay for it too but hey if you can get a pizza and parking for a few hours then it might be worth it.  She says 'no'.  They used to do it but they stopped.  Now you have to have to get your ticket validated at one of the casino machines and she points down the hall.  ""Okay, so you do validate parking but you have to do it at the machine, right?""

I stayed at the Plaza this past week and found this little gem the last night we were there. Wish I would have found it earlier. I ordered the 20 piece chicken tenders for bf and I to share and was happily surprised at the price of about $18 with tax. We got them plain with buffalo and teriyaki sauce on the side. The man who was taking our order was super helpful and patient while we tried to decide what to order. Our order was ready in about 10 minutes and was fresh and hot. The tenders were a decent size and the sauces that accompanied them were good as well. The ranch is homemade and bomb.com. I am very picky about ranch and this one was up to par. We had lots of chicken leftover i just wish we had a damn refrigerator we could have put them in to eat the next day, but that was no fault of PUP.

I ordered the vegan slice with vegan garlic knots. The Mr got a spinach/white slice. 
The pizza was OK, not the best but not the worst. It was a little bit soggy and not flavorful enough. 
The garlic knots were really just mini round rolls and were over cooked. They were not garlicky at all, and they were dry. Definitely would not order the garlic knots there again. 
Also, the marinara sauce that came with it was cold and kind of just tasted like ketchup - no seasonings at all.
Side note- my absolute favorite garlic knots in this town are the ones at Pizza Company, those are life-changing! 
Also, since we weren't staying at the hotel they don't validate your parking. So we had to spend $10 on parking in addition to $20 for two slices, two sodas, and a small order of knots ...w parking it all came out to a $30 adventure.

And like BBQ, pizza is fairly simple but it's that simplicity that makes it very hard to do well. I have scoured the city and been disappointed more than I can recall. This place is a shining gem in what is a murky pool of pizza in Las Vegas.

I was coming home from running errands and pulled into a Mexican restaurant down the road. Noticing the FULL parking lot, it dawned on me that it's Valentine's and I'm single with no make up on. Yeah, it's delivery time. I'm new to living downtown so I had no point of reference on what may or may not be good. So taking a chance after reading reviews on yelp, I ordered up delivery from Pop Up Pizza. So glad I did!

They lost a little bit of that 5th stay because the girl who answered the phone was kinda dim and really couldn't answer questions well. I even had to remind her that she needed my address. I was a great point of concern but I already made the order so I decided to just cross my fingers.

What I got...
Personal Size 5th St Pizza...this was definitely an excellent pizza and on the TOP of my list for Las Vegas. There really wasn't anything negative about the pie at all. I do prefer a thinner crust but it wasn't really thick either, so I enjoyed it. I must say that the crust and sauce were definitely done extremely well. 

Garlic Knots...everyone kept mentioning them in reviews so I had to try them out. Mine were a touch over done on the bottom but otherwise they are super tasty and I will definitely order he again.

My only other real complaint was the delivery guy. He called me and told me I had to come outside because they don't typically deliver to my address. (Btw, I live probably a mile or so away). He then spent a LOT of time looking at my credit card and ID. I started wondering if they have a problem with thieves or something. It was fairly awkward and uncomfortable. 

All in all the pie made up for any hiccups that I ran across in the exchange. I'm glad to know they are close and deliver. I'm looking forward to heading over and checking out the place in person",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,2,0,4,2RzVnfubWM20oIjtAqqsdg

If you've been following along, I have been searching for good east-coast style pizza since moving to LV.  Cosmo Secret Pizza is close (although it's kind of greasy and it's not really a secret anymore).  Everything else has fallen flat.  I had heard about Pop-Up Pizza and decided that the trek to downtown was worth the possible payout.

If you only look at the counter and remove the setting, Pop Up looks nearly identical to the Cosmo joint.  They even have boxed wine should you choose to go that route.  There were only a few pie choices, but even then it was hard to decide.  I went with the 18b (cheese pizza with homemade red sauce) and The Goodman (a carb-tastic behemoth with spinach and potatoes).

Both slices were amazing.  The crust had a snap and then a chew.  It was a contradiction of terms, and it was amazing.  The red sauce had a perfect blend of seasoning.  And potatoes on pizza sounds ridiculous, but you have to try it.

I would eat here every day if I could.  Unfortunately, The Plaza is not close to home.  At the same time, I think this is better - now I can truly savor my Pop Up Pizza experience and enjoy it.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,4,3,5,aPGCqFzSlt7WTTyA3mMMvg

Upon ordering we were told many of our selections were not available. The cashier said the Newport was very similar to the vegan selection, the Soho. I tried it but quickly realized that vegan pizza is nothing like real pizza. The cheese is visually unsettling, like playdoh. The crust was dry and flavorless. I was sad to consume my evening calories this way. Luckily they had my other choice, the White Chapel. It was pretty good. Cheesy, roasted spinach, generous chunks of ricotta and a doughy crust. Two slices and sharing a side is enough for one (costs about $11). The side we enjoyed was the fried pickles. They are fried as spears instead of slices. Wait for them to cool or you will pull a searing hot spear from the bread casing. We were bummed the breading was separate from the pickle, but I'm not sure how you fix that. Also when the man said peoples' numbers that night he said it so nonchalantly and quietly that he had to say them many times. Also our re-warmed pizzas were not super hot, just warmed. I think I would have enjoyed it more if they were hot. If you're down here I'd stop by, but it's hard to make a special trip and not be able to order the slices you wanted.

2562564,2013-02-25,3,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"Loved this place. It's been on my bookmarks since it opened. I know everyone compares it to Secret Pizza, honestly I was WAY too drunk to remember my 3am experience there so I'm not gonna be one to compare the two. 
We went here during a visit to the Friday downtown farmers market. The parking at the Plaza sucks. You pay $5 then get it refunded inside. The elevators were creepy. Find parking within a few blocks and take the walk. You'll need it after stuffing your face with the thin NY style pizza, 
I went with The Plaza (sausage, ricotta, red peppers, no red sauce) I'd order again and honestly I will return based on this slice. Also went with the White Chapel which was a typical white pizza with spinach. I'm a sucker for ricotta on pizza, but next time I will get one with red sauce because I tasted it with my garlic knots and it was bomb. 
My bf had a slice with different meats and eggplant. My homegirl had a slice of pepperoni. Both enjoyed but I don't think either of them has had a pizza in NY or NJ the way I have & they didn't get the appreciation I had for the place. And as mentioned in my tip, the reggae music and genuine service topped it off perfectly. 
Loss of star for the stupid parking. I appreciate the downtown casinos getting new good grub, but they need some updating as well. Nasty cigarette smoke is not the business!

For the past few years I have been addicted to the Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan, and this year I have cheated on it and now things will just never be the same between us. As a matter of fact Pop Up Pizza is so good that I ate its pie twice...in the same night....with only a few hours of rest and one rather loaded yard long pina colada to slow me down. What I thought was just going to be a one night stand turned into so much more. The crust so perfectly charred, so crispy and thin. The sauce so sweet, the topping so fresh, the cheese so creamy.  And they also give you a little something extra on the side. How about some hot sizzling action from the fryer. How about trying the pickle ? Deep fried and delicious served with creamy ranch. Or how about French fries with fresh minced Garlic and Parmesan ? Oh yes please. Give me more.  Sometimes I just need some variety in my life, a chance to experiment. Pop Up Pizza has a orgy of different pies to choose from including an exotic Vegan Pie.   So it is with a small amount of guilt that I must break off my relationship with the Cosmo Secret Pizza.

2759601,2014-04-09,3,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"Im hungry. Lets see what pops up on my bookmarks. Well, would you look at that. Pop Up Pizza just happens to be about 3 blocks away.

First off, the place is located inside The Plaza Hotel and Casino. You can park in the Plaza parking lot for 5 bucks cash only (free for those that are gold or platinum or whatever card you need that the sign says at the gate). Dont worry though, keep your parking receipt, have the attendant at PUP stamp your parking receipt after you pay for your food, and then take that stamped receipt to the cashier at the cashier cage about 50 yards away so they can give you your 5 bucks back.

As you go up to the counter, you can see garlic knots and all the pizza that is available for purchase by the slice. If you refer to my pic, they have this combo menu right on counter. You have 6 options. I picked combo number 1 which is any two slices and a large soda for 7.99. I selected a slice of the Harris Meatball Pie and the Fremont.

The Harris Meatball Pie: Mozzarella, classic Italian meatballs, caramelized onions, olives and topped with fresh basil. Nuff said.
The Fremont: Mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and roasted eggplant. Again, nuff said.

The only negatives I observed is that when you park in the Plaza parking lot, you gotta walk past the Greyhound bus station. That place in itself is a whole other review. http://www.yelp.com/biz/greyhound-bus-lines-las-vegas#query:greyhound%20bus%20station
Also, where the seating area is for PUP is basically in the wide open portion of the casino itself, meaning that whatever secondhand smoke is lingering around will give your pizza the smoke flavoring that you dont want.

Some random info: I was told there was free wifi but I couldnt get it to work for me. The domain is popup pizza. The password is popuppizza1. They are open daily from 11 am to 2 am for you guys that have the munchies late at night.

In closing, I think their thin crust pizza is pretty good. Its just the 5 dollar parking that you eventually get back, the scenic route to PUP, and the unwanted added secondhand smoke flavoring to my pizza that kind of ruins the moment.

There were around 15 tables, a couple businessman eating and the rest was open. Seating wasn't an issue. My first slice I went with your basic cheese, this way I can get a good feel of the crust & cheese. This was pure pizza perfection. The crust was so perfect, just cripsy and not too thick, not too thin. I was so in love, I was scared to try to my second slice because I didn't want to be disappointed. It was anything but, I went with a white pizza, the Plaza, it had mozzarella, ricotta cheese, roasted red peppers and italian sausage. Nice bit of oilve oil on top as well.

If sit on that seat for a while, you might forget why you went to the Plaza.   

It's next to the south entrance of the hotel, and has about seven table in front of a pizza display case.

On the first floor of the Plaza Hotel was Pop Up Pizza.  It looked very nice and bright, very clean and sheik, with great art work displayed on the walls, two tv's, great music and it was packed with people.

The first piece of pie that caught my eye was the Fremont because of the eggplant.  I loooove eggplant.  And the other piece I wanted to try was the Goodman which had potatoes as a topping, which was a something new for me.  And I also ordered a basket of garlic fries.  And to drink I was pleasantly surprised to find my all time favorite soda in the frige, Doc Brown's Cream Soda!!!  Hard to find, so I was shocked to see it here.  But this was a good sign that it was going to be a great meal.

The Fremont was fantastic.  The eggplant was baked just right, and very tasty and went great with the sausage and peppers.  The crust and bread had a perfect balance between soft and crunchy which completed it all.

The Goodman was great.  The potatoes were very flavorful and turned out to be a great topping on a pizza.  I would definitely have it again.

Garlic fries were hot and fresh, fries were nice and crispy.  And of course, the Doc Brown's Cream Soda was refreshingly solid as always.

Overall, it was great handmade gourmet pizza with reasonable prices, nice ambiance, good service, & Doc Brown's Cream Soda.  It's great quality food perfect for dinner, and fast enough for a quick lunch.  Definitely coming back.  This place could definitely become a regular stop.

Then we returned Sunday (5/21) around 2 and ordered another whole pizza (always go with the whole pizzas as they are made fresh) and this pizza was a bit too heavy on the sauce and the cheese was a little heavy as well.

Pop Up manages to turn out pies with a thin, crunchy crust and a flavorful cheese/sauce combo. That's really all there is to 'za (makes you wonder how so many people screw it up). Bonus:  The pepperoni on the Main St. is arguably better than the average pepp slice you would get in NY. Tons of flavor.

The set specialty slices they have are a bit all over the place (I find each slice to have one odd ingredient), but if you have a few peeps with you, order a custom pie and make it your own. The only real negative I have is that a few of the pies they had out looked like they were sitting there for a while. Always a downer to see that.

The location is odd, sure, but worth a visit if you need a quick bite while on Freemont. While it's not quite at full east coast pizzeria level yet, if they start putting together some sicilian and grandma slices out, I could def give it the 5-star nod.

I have got a ton of pizza spots bookmarked and rarely get to them. Mainly because I've really got to be in the mood for it and that doesn't happen often. Pop Up was one of those times that being in the mood for pizza was a good thing!

Pop Up is located in the Plaza Hotel just to the right when you exit from the parking garage elevators. It's a fairly small spot but not hard to see at all. All the pizzas are pre-made and displayed at the front for re-heating, unless requested otherwise. 

I went with a slice of The White Chapel and a slice of The Harris Meatball Pie. Even after being reheated, the crust here is fanfriggintastic. If you want to fold it, go ahead...but you're not forced to do so to avoid a sloppy mess all over your hands. In my opinion, it was the perfect texture/consistency, whatever you want to call it, for a pizza crust. The toppings are great too and they aren't skimpy with them either! I'm assuming some of these pizzas may sit here a while sometimes but all the toppings were fresh and full of flavor. Plus, how can you complain about a pizza that's described as being topped with ""dollops"" of ricotta?! I know I can't.

If you're in the Plaza for whatever reason, this is definitely worth the stop! The prices are great too...for 3 slices of pizza, 3 drinks and some garlic knots, we only spent about $18. Pop Up Pizza, you will be seeing me again!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,3,4,2Yqo6cXSc7jCMCdGuACU3w

The server said to us, in a nasty voice, there is only one piece. She asked the chef if there was any more coming out, he said no. I had to ask when there was going to be a new pizza. The wait was 15 mins. We waited and ordered 2 pieces of pizza, mozzarella sticks and parmasan  garlic fries. The garlic fries were doused in garlic and no parm. The mozzarella sticks were the only good thing about this experience. Except for the fact that we got back to the room before we noticed there wasn't any dipping sauce, or forks. When we went back for the sauce and forks the employees were standing in the middle of the dining room talking. None of them even glanced at us, and we were standing at the cash!

I read all the glowing reviews of Pop Up, and I thought, thank you jesus, a great pizza place in Las Vegas to go along with the very very very few other great pizza places. But alas, THIS IS NOT IT! 
Not even close.

The sauce tastes like the spaghetti sauce you'd get at Vons. The crust is nice and soft, but not fully-evolved: too much floury flavors. And a touch too thick.

The mozzarella is so not there, it may as well not be there.

The pepperoni is so large it looks more like salami, and doesn't have that spicy kick that puts the damn ""pepper"" in pepperoni!

It doesn't end there. 
Their business model is as retarded as the Secret Pizza place at the Cosmo.
They don't have a menu.
They have only one size pizza: 18 inch.
They clearly missed the memo from high school business class that says: give the consumer choices and make him feel like he's getting what he wants. 

Oh, and I almost forgot, it's expensive....almost 20 bucks for an 18 inch (we don't have any other size) pie.
No deals.No pick-up specials.

4014478,2014-04-11,1,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"Wow, am I glad that this pizza place decided to 'Pop Up'!  Totally gives Downtown LV a good place to get some decent pie!  

Finally got around to eating at Pop Up Pizza the weekend The Plaza had the Hot Wheels Super Convention in town.  Hot Wheels?  Toys?  Pizza?  Can't get much better than that!  Well, if I was rich it would have made it a bit better.

Seriously, Pop Up Pizza is one of the better places to get a bite.  I love me my Hawaiian eats and such, but sometimes you wanna get away from cheap prime rib, teri chicken bowls and oxtail soup, and just opt for something lighter.  Easier to digest.  This will fit the bill nicely!

Pop Up Pizza is like lots of other pie joints in town, got a display area for ready to go slices, or you can just order off the menu and wait for your pie to be made.  If I was with the family, no doubt we would have gone the order a fresh pie route.  Since it was just me that day (with a few limited edition toys in my other hand) I decided to get a few slices to go.  Luckily their #1 combo of any two slices and a drink for $7.99 was right up my alley.  I have no problem with reheating pizza in the oven for a few minutes as long as the pie hasn't been sitting there for TOO long.  Of all the slices I wanted to try (and the list was long), I opted for the ones that weren't dried over.

As luck would have it I managed to get two of their top choices.  And wouldn't you know, I almost went damn near Vegan!  I ended up with slices of:

#The Newport - Ricotta, roasted artichoke, peppers, eggplant, spinach, and mushrooms with garlic olive oil

#The Soho (uber popular by Hippies & Tree Huggers alike..I kid, I kid) - Vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, and roasted bell peppers

After a few minutes in the oven to reheat, and a drink filling, I was on my way out the door!  But...I caught a whiff of my goodies and just couldn't resist.  Walked back to the dining area of Pop Up Pizza and popped open that box.  Oh the joy!

This was seriously some great pie!  The Newport was yummy, full of veggies, a nice serving of cheese, hint of sauce (good sauce by the way), and a still crunchy but not soggy on top crust.  And was I surprised by The Soho!  Delicious, delicious, delicious.  The Vegan mozzarella didn't taste Vegan at all, had good melt.  With the veggies and the light crust, I had no problem finishing this off.  Imagine, me, a meal with no meat!  And I was satisfied!  I can see some of they hype with the Vegan pie.  Good show Pop Up Pizza!

Only downer for me?  P-E-P-S-I.  Ugh!  I just feel Pepsi products are too strong to go with any type of pizza!  But that's just me being biased to Coca-Cola.  There is a reason why 'Coke is it'!  But this is just a minor inconvenience.  I'll just sit at a machine and order a BEER.  

You can bet I will be back to Pop Up Pizza anytime I can get myself to actually go Downtown.  I do want to try some of their other pies and maybe sample some of their Garlic Knots (I'm a sucker for anything overly garlicky).

So glad you guys decided to POP UP!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,0,4,l-8RIksRHwcD7_s60abo2A

Now that I live Downtown and there are so many choices my personal rule is to never try the same place twice.  Thats going to be hard here.  With all of the mom and pop style pizza places popping up here I didn't have high hopes for a joint right inside of a Casino.  It started when I made the phone call. The manager asked what time I would like the pizza ready by.  I imagine they try to time it perfect to assure the freshest possible pizza.  When I arrived the pizza just came out of the oven and as I was paying the manager greeted me with a warm smile.  I took the pizza home where my family was eagerly waiting.  The large is quite big but turns out it was not enough.  This place blew Radio city Pizza and Uncle Joes out of the water.  I hate to say it but wow.  The crust was perfection.  Im very surprised by this and Im still wowed by the service.

The portions are huge too which is always a plus and is priced very reasonable. I recommend ordering a whole pie(way cheaper) and you can take home the leftovers. The white chapel is another one of my favorites!  Another big plus is their service, the employees are super nice and willing to acomodate you(very refreshing for a place inside a casino).

Just walking by the arsenal of pizza on display, I was able to tell that there's quality and care put into their pies. The pizzas looked amazing. Plus, slice prices were very reasonable for what you get (around $3.50).  I had the pleasure of two different slices:

18b - Traditional cheese pizza infused with herbs. Very tasty, with a great crispy crunch to along with it.

Goodman - There's a lot going on with this pizza. In fact, I thought too much was going on. The flavor combo on this one wasn't the best with the caramelized onions, potato, etc. I preferred the simplicity of the 18b over this. Still, pretty decent.

In terms of pizza, they do come off on the lighter side. They are not overly greasy, leaving me with a notable crispy crust to munch on.  If hungry, it might take 2-3 slices to get your fill.

 It might be a little disappointing to go out of your way specifically for the pizza, but it's a definite stop if I'm in the area. 

Note: Parking at the Plaza is a bit of a pain. Pay $5 to get in, get validation wherever you eat, then run to the cashier cage to get your money back. It's a slight run around, but just make sure you have cash to get in!",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,6,3,4,XYjyJImOWMfxIxSiM3FpDA

Rumor has it, this place imports a lot of stuff from authentic graphical locations around the states.  For instance, they ship their cheese from Wisconsin, rumor also has it they use the same water softener as what's used in New York, ensuring the perfect New York style pizza.  If all that's true, then hats off!!

So the location is a blah.  It's on the south end of the Plaza hotel, at the west end of the Fremont Street Experience.  The place is hard to miss, Pop Up PIZZA sign is HUGE.  There are a few square tables in the area.  You have a glass case with all the pizzas available and a couple of tvs.  It's a small quaint pizza joint in the middle of a downtown casino.

Today, I got a slice of the meatball pizza and a slice of the 5th street pizza.  The total with a bottled water and tax came to $10.  The meatball pizza has slices of Italian meatballs, pieces of basil and olives.  The meatball was perfectly seasoned, the basil offered an herbal refreshment and I love the saltiness of the olives.  The 5th street pizza included pepperonis, sliced mushrooms and caramelized onions.  I LOVE mushrooms on pizza.  Something about that combination makes me smile :)  The pepperonis were sliced differently so it looked homemade.  The taste was out of this world.  Add that with the sweetness of caramelized onions and you got my favorite pizza from this place.

I'm always working and hanging out downtown.  Now that I've found this authentic gem, there's no way this was my last visit.  I think this place needs to be told and shared amongst the world of Yelp.  When you're in downtown Las Vegas, you really need to check this place out.

Garlic Knot
Cinnamon Bombolini with Cream

While New Yorkers or the New York-centric seemingly love to tout the excellence of the ""slice,"" it can only be said that I don't get it - a greasy pile of low quality pepperoni on overly sweetened sauce topped with cheap cheese supported by a foldable, dull crust simply is not my idea of pizza and no matter how many try to defend their favorite slice shops or memories of slurping down a 99 cent hunger stop-gap at 2am the fact of the matter is that most of it is no better than Sbarro...a few exceptions noted...and one of them right here in Las Vegas.  Dubbed ""Pop-Up Pizza"" by the folks at downtown's Plaza hotel and located just off the gaming floor Pop-Up is not a pop up in any true sense of the word, but rather a traditional appearing joint with white tiles, limited seating, and gas ovens behind a selection of pre-made and fresh pies ready to be fired (or re-fired) plus a few bonus items and with expedited but friendly service it provides a veritable bargain; my total bill coming to $9.47 before tip and delivered to my hands in less than five minutes.  Beginning first with the 'extras,' both the supple garlic knot and delicate brioche-style donuts with truly impressive house made sweet cream would prove to be quite well made at 50 cents each and moving on to the pizza itself I'll simply offer a 'bravo' to the persons in charge of sourcing and the team arranging the pies as each component came together beautifully - the sauce tangy but not sweet, the garlic aromatic but not overwhelming the fresh spinach, and the cheese of a whole-milk variety full of flavor and not with oil while the crust, still foldable, had good crunch but ample chew neither adding or detracting from the composition.  Still not even remotely close to the quality of many artisan pies but a step in the right direction, particularly for the slice-shop genre, and offering delivery throughout Sin City I still can't say I 'get it' but for those looking for an improved take on the nostalgia of childhood, or drunken nights in Manhattan, this is about as good as it gets.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,4,xzy2gEZD9zC9Nr-zogzPIA

What's more hipster than Vegan Pizza (craft vegan microbrews, but I digress), I opened up my faithful Yelp app and saw that PUP was open until 2 AM, we decided to part ways with our friends around 1:15 AM and found ourselves at PUP around 1:30 AM.

Seeing as it was the wee hours, they only had two slices of the Soho their vegan pie that has won my sister over and her bragging rights to what's hip in the food area (which is my usual bragging rights - sibling rivalry never dies). So we got one slice of the Soho and one slice of the Newport.

The Newport is ricotta, artichoke, peppers, eggplant, spinach and mushrooms topped with a garlic infused olive oil. IT was delicious, not overly decadent and tasted really fresh (which is important). I hate when a pizza joint has canned anything on it. I was impressed. I devoured that first slice. Then, I ventured on to the Soho. Vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, and roasted bell peppers... I sized this bad boy up... Then I took a bite. How the heck is the VEGAN pizza soooo damn good and better than the NON-VEGAN options? IT WAS OFF THE CHARTS, y'all. I see why my sister was so sad that they only had two slices (for each of us)left. Needless to say, I cannot wait to go be a hipster downtown and end my night with a slice of vegan pie.

Frankly, I went there because they have garlic rolls, one of my favorite treats.  The ones here were okay but barely.  The bread was slightly chewy so that was good, but instead of butter, they were covered in oil of some sort and then garlic that tasted like it came from a jar.  The kicker was that the extra 58  cents I was charged for the marinara sauce was ICE COLD.  For hot garlic rolls.  Ugh.

The Scintas slice was more up my alley.  Basically a meat lovers slice.  Very tasty.

Pop Up Pizza makes a very good pie. (Yes, east coasters call it a pie.)  it is 18' so one pie will feed 5-8 people as 1-2 slices will fill almost anyone.  The toppings are great, the pepperoni is from Chicago and large flavorful slices instead of those microsliced ones you get on chain pizza.  The bacon was real and crisp.  There is a ton of flavor in their sauce and maybe just a touch too much oregano.  There is a lot of garlic but I like that.  

The Chicken Strips are very good but be careful, the ranch has a garlic flavor to it and many don't like that.

We also had the Pepperoni and Mushroom which was my boyfriends absolute favorite (probably mine too if he let me have more than a bite). We also shared some chicken strips that came with fries. Trust me it was not because we were drunk, but we were devouring this food, wanting more even though we were stuffed. It was simply delicious!
Service is decently quick, I mean they put your slice in the oven the moment you ask for it which is very convenient. I also love the horse statue!",ioOy7qYLTRgZDakeMdW4GQ,0,0,4,6zqZvQktx53h8tirjLx91w
5736769,2012-08-19,1,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"After a night of drinking downtown, I knew that I had to try the new pizza joint that everyone was talking about. So we waded through the madness of the Fremont  St. Experience and finally found them in a corner of the Plaza. When you walk up, it looks like a normal pizza place, with pies sitting out waiting to be consumed by the slice. I was immediately drawn to the white pizza and after reading the menu I knew this was not the run of the mill food court pizza. They are quite inventive with the toppings and very friendly. 

I went with the White Chapel, cute name, which was a white slice featuring spinach, garlic, and ricotta. It was pretty fantastic and I definitely would have eaten another slice. It was flavorful, especially the spinach and ricotta, and the crust was crispy, thin, and delicious. My husband had a slice that had bacon, sausage, and pepperoni, a real man pizza. It was also very flavorful and delicious, you were really able to discern the flavor of each meat in every bite. I kept stealing bites each time he turned his head. We also tried a slice of the Goodman, which features spinach, potatoes, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. This was good, but not as outstanding as the other slices. We also had some garlic knots, which were good, but nothing too special.

Overall, this place is dishing up some great NY style pizza with inventive toppings. The sauce, the toppings, and the crust are all highlights to these pretty outstanding pies. This is drunk food, with some serious flavor!",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,3,1,4,Ua8KR_6lZNkdcjnBjPyqgw
5754092,2014-03-25,0,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"Decent pizza, decent price, terrible location and dining setup. Apparently this is a Vegan Hipster Mecca, and while I did not have the vegan slice I will say it sounded interesting enough to try. I found myself to be merely satisfied with the Main Street and marginally more so with the Fremont. Neither was worth a repeat trip. Unless you are a Vegan Hipster in which case run, don't walk.",23IlERT0gL_QOF_9g8oSWw,0,0,3,dAL7Rnj__BU-F7ee5YxCYA

5799720,2012-07-20,0,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,Laying on my couch just got your request to come back and have you try to make it right......... Amazingly I think this is the right thing to do and am super impressed that this offer was extended. On that alone I will change my rating to 3 stars. If we're all in neighborhood again I may take you up on that offer. Not often a place in Vegas makes wrong into a right. I'm all too firmiler what a bad review on yelp can do to a store owner who tries so hard. With that said you receive an A for effort. And thank you for making my opinion matter.,fp2KiLfoIO9OIUV2KHkgEA,1,0,3,vIzqMxEnagKKEvDNmRbwWg

It was even better on the left over side.  For anyone trying to be frugal or wanting to have multiple meals.  Come to the plaza.

5959779,2014-11-04,4,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"Wandering around Fremont, my friend and I needed, yes needed, a slice of pizza cap off our night.

We stopped by Pop Up Pizza, she ordered a slice of meatball with kalamata olives and onions and I ordered the eggplant with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers. They were warmed up quickly and I enjoyed the toppings and the dough was solid too, but I had hoped it would be cooked a little more evenly. My friends was nicely cooked and had a nice char, but mine was on the doughy side.

Overall, I enjoyed my pizza, but found the dough to be a little inconsistent.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,3,W3NLyq7TYhDzT_p6HiIHsg

5987092,2017-09-22,1,sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,"When 1st getting this vegan pizza the soho I didn't know what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's about the same as evel pie in flavor. I like that they have a specialty pizza that vegan I got mine w extra cheese. This location is not as busy as where evel pie is but they both have equally good vegan pizza. Negative one star only because this place is also hard to get to. If your getting take out you have to either pay for parking, or drive up the parking garage it's free for the 1st hour, but I had to go all the way up to the 2nd to last level around and around and around. I was thinking ugh.. this is so ridiculous... again. The should make it easier to get take out, like they should advertise if you show the valet the receipt they will let you park for 10 mins or so so you can run in get it then go home.  or somehow make it a easier process to get take out. Either way this place is a good place to get vegan pizza eat in or take out. It's inside a casino. To your right after you exit the parking garage elevators in the casino level.",N26-dXhOoB3gHhX6meMMNw,2,1,4,IQrgJ598-dmbyCXFJYF2cA
