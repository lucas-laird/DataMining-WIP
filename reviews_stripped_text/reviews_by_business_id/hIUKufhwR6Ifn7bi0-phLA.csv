Definitely try their eggplant and ANYTHING with pesto, it's delicious and the proportions are perfect for lunch! The seafood bisque is rich and creamy. If your feeling sweet try their monkey latte.

My only peeve is that this place is a little awkward to get to and it's tucked away on the side of a freeway and corporate offices.",1EjIfQi64Zj7ntXWlFFXpw,0,0,4,PPvi5KebTX9WcDBFSlsrCQ

We had the vegetable quiche with salad, cup of carrot soup, eggplant/prosciutto sandwich, and apple carrot juice. Everything was wonderful!

The chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese, bacon and tomato pesto is also very good, as is the chipotle chicken sandwich.  The only one I haven't liked so far is the Bleu Brie.  I will be back to try some of their homemade soups.

The generous serving of Quiche was creamy and savory and melt-in-your-mouth. Bacon in every delicious bite! The crust was outstanding. The salad provided just the right contrast of crisp and crunchy, and the house dressing dressed the salad without taking over.

The Salted Mango Tart - wow! I'm not a big mango fan, so I was skeptical. But the flaky crust, light banana-flavored pastry cream topped with glazed, salted mango was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Not too heavy, either.

The Chocolate Tart - To. Die. For. Rich, creamy, and chocolatey goodness in a flaky almond crust! Again, not too sweet, but oh so decadent!

So disappointed. Wasn't worth the money or my time. Seemed like a good place to sit and eat though! 
Not a place where you order food to go ,for sure!

323511,2013-07-02,3,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I've died and gone to heaven. Seriously. I also have just gotten home and taken my first bite and felt compelled to let people know what they are missing out on. 

I've always bypassed this place before because it's tucked away and hard to get to and is only open during the week during business hours so I never had the opportunity. But now that I'm on a schedule that can accommodate theirs and seeing all the rave reviews I was compelled to come here in my pajamas in search of breakfast. 

I was greeted immediately upon entering and apparently by the look on my face Olivier asked if I had been there before. I told him I was a first-timer and he proceeded to offer me recommendations on their most popular items and informed me of their baking style (from scratch and throughout the day). I went with their popular omelet on a croissant (fresh out of the oven) with bacon. He also asked me if I would like anything to drink; I ended up getting a decaf americano (yea for illi coffee). My mouth started drooling at the sight, smell, and introduction to their cranberry croissant and chocolate croissant (also fresh out of the oven). I caved once my omelet croissant and coffee were ready and asked for one of each to go as well. 

The establishment itself is small but cute. Indoor and outdoor seating as well as a small loveseat with a table. Norah jones was playing on the overhead (bonus points). Next time I'm definitely dining in. 

On to the food - freakin awesome deliciousness. Words do not do them justice. The food tastes as good as it smells. The croissants are the real deal. Light and fluffy and to the demise of my waistline. I might just say it. The omelet croissant was perfect. I can't even describe it well enough to do it justice. How does an omelet croissant melt in your mouth?? Just try it. The chocolate croissant was decadent. Again light and fluffy croissant with chocolate embedded in it's fluffy goodness. Pairs well with coffee. The cranberry croissant had a high bar to meet, I think I was already on sensory overload by the time I got to it, so I may have to try it on a clean palette to give it a fair shake. 

I'm already hooked. Time to introduce my husband to this little slice of heaven. I already can't wait!!",7qisKMCj9ONJF6gSEFHj3w,5,4,5,9Gt-iO5Nrr7wUB03uawpLw

When we got there, we were treated very nicely by the employers and the place had a very good vibe, we looked at the menu and had very good choices. I got the chipotle sandwich and my bf got I don't know...

We had the special of the day: The pork loin sandwich - tender slices of pork with a creamy sweet sauce, mushrooms, shaved parmesan, baby spinach and tomato on an extremely well made baguette (crispy crunchy exterior texture, soft interior).  Absolutely delectable.  The chocolate tart and pear tart were very delicious as well.  I'd like to come back to sample the quiche (they ran out) and the rest of the menu :-D.

The food here was as good if not better than a lot of the food I had while I was in France recently.  Breakfast here yesterday was a treat, especially as Oliver was pulling fresh bread out of the oven while I was standing there.  I had the pain au chocolate, and it was superb to say the least.  The chocolate inside was spread evenly throughout, and it was sweet but not too sweet.  The pastry was what you dream pastry should be like, light, fluffy, flaky and full of flavorful.  Every bite was a mouthful of deliciousness.  I also tried their quiche Lorraine, which was wonderful as well.  It was not heavy nor dense, and the flavors all came through wonderfully.

I am so happy that I discovered this place near my new place, and I know that this place is now my go to breakfast spot.

And a note for all you soon to be first-timers, it's located in the back of the office complex if you enter of Sunset Rd, so don't be worried that you don't see it straight away, just go around the buildings and you'll see it tucked away in the back.  It might be easier if you're coming from east of there to come in off Raphael Riviera, as there's a driveway entrance located right next to the cafe.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,3,2,5,fO2KC77-fXsOdNId6IXqaA

Olivier is a great guy and very friendly which makes my visits very pleasant. I've had several of their sandwiches and loved them all. Same for the breakfasts.

- Nice selection of beverage though I have only tried a normal latte.

- Great service for a small operation; they bring your entree to your table!

Cons:

- Customer Service...they are just too busy especially during lunch hours to clean the tables fast enough...not necessarily a bad thing.

- Customer Service...they are just too busy especially during lunch hours so there can be a long line...not necessarily a bad thing...nom nom food takes time.

I was in the area today so i decided to try it out. When we got there, there was a line literally going out the door. We waited about 15 minutes so i would suggest avoiding going there during lunch hour. When we got to the register, we were helped by a guy who was really friendly and informative about their menu. He remembered our names and seemed to genuinely care for his customers. 

I got the turkey sandwich and an iced white mocha and my friend ordered the curry chicken sandwich and a funky monkey specialty drink. We were so hungry and being that they were so busy, we knew it would take some time to get to our order so we grabbed a goji bar to munch on. The bar was made from all naural products so i expected it to taste like cardboard but it ended up being SO GOOD! Our sandwiches were also delicious, especially the baguette that they were on. 

While waiting for our food, we kept eyeing the peach tart that was in the display case. We ended up giving in and buying a slice and im sooo glad we did! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. It wasnt too sweet and the crust was the best i've tasted in a while!

All of the pastries are baked in-house each morning by the owners, and I simply cannot resist a banana or strawberry muffin if they're available.  
The quiche Lorraine is my favorite of the quiches, but Olivier usually switches up the type of quiche prepared every few days; keeps things interesting, you know?
The cherry on top of this entire deal is the fact that only Illy coffee and espresso is served.

I love his cream of potato soup with truffle oil and butternut squash soup, but I've never been disappointed by any of his other soups. The first time you come here, Olivier will be more than happy to explain to you the items on his menu, and he's always enthusiastic with customers. He wants you to love the food as much as he does. The food is made with love, and I think that's why I like it so much. I would definitely recommend the chicken curry sandwich (it's not on the menu though) and the chicken pesto sandwich is delicious as well.

The cafe is located in the same plaza as a whole bunch of big business buildings so it can be a bit confusing trying to find this place the first time. The cafe is small, with about 5 or 6 small tables on the inside, but there are more tables located outside. I've noticed many of the customers are people who work at the nearby office buildings on their lunch breaks, but there are also many customers who, like me, make the drive for the food and relaxing atmosphere. The cost is a few dollars higher than your regular sandwich, but it's well worth it for fresh baked bread and ingredients. 

The only gripe I have (and I've told Olivier this before) is that the cafe is only open until 5:00 pm Monday-Fridays. It makes sense as most of the office buildings nearby operate on the weekdays, but I get mad cravings for my chicken curry baguette and soup on the weekends!",g4GA0o1DRARHKGhmxkiSBQ,7,3,5,g_fh5PvglI-fx9PxW3dnDA

If you enjoy travel, and like places with an ""international vibe,"" you will probably enjoy this place! Pictures of Paris, French-speaking customers, eclectic music tracks ranging from rustic guitar rifts, Spanish vocals, to funky electronic, will bring a smile to your face. It was a bit of journey to find it, as it is tucked away, but well worth the effort. The owner/manager/barista (lol, busy guy!), ""Oliver,"" makes you feel welcome right from the start. The coffee is top-notch, I usually get just plain drip with some cream. On the day I went, they were serving beans roasted by Anchois coffee Co FYI. They serve it in big, warm cups, served to your table. Lastly, the food selection is also fantastic. Great breakfast and lunch options. I had an Egg baguette Panini. Delicioso!

They have great wifi now! So they get the 5th star! This place checks all the boxes for me now. I will miss them as I leave Vegas, here is my going away picture...Have a ""Tiru-ific-misu"" journey!

1157565,2014-08-19,4,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I've been a regular for several years now, and it's still my favorite place in town. Everything is delicious - everything. Close your eyes and point. Not only that, but you can feel the love and passion that goes into everything both aesthetic and edible. And they care about YOU. I can go for 6 months without being able to visit Baguette, and Olivier still welcomes me like family and asks how I've been as casually as if I'd been seeing him every week. 

I see a lot of people complaining about how to find the place. 

HERE IS A TIP FOR THE EASIEST WAY TO GET TO BAGUETTE. 

If you are driving westbound on the 215, take the Buffalo exit. Go straight through the light at the top of the hill. You will be on a street parallel to the freeway, and you will drive right up next to the business park on your right before you hit Durango. There will be 3 total turns off of that side road (also known as Raphael Rivera Way). Take either the 2nd or the 3rd and you will be at Baguette. It is right in between those two entrances, up against Raphael Rivera. It truly doesn't get any easier than that. See? Not so hard?

If you truly have no choice but to drive through the business park (say, if you were coming east/southbound on the 215),  when you turn off of Sunset do NOT just drive all willy nilly through the middle of the business park. That's how you are all getting so frustrated and hitting dead ends. Look at a Google map. If you refuse to look at a map ahead of time, then stick to the west side of the business park. Take Ganger Rd when you turn off Sunset, and stick closely to that far west side of the business park as you wind your way to the back of the business park towards Raphael Rivera. Eventually you will see that row of buildings that Baguette is tucked into in the very back peeking through the larger business structures.

But seriously. Just look at a map. It's worth it.

*After going today, I noticed that they've expanded their outdoor seating. TONS of places to sit now with plenty of umbrellas, it's very exciting for their lunchtime rush to see some extra room!",DWkRSHLNEbdbs37Eh392dw,6,1,5,-oyko9OGM3_1_7zYmwtUrQ

I am currently salivating just thinking about the buttery and flakey goods! Whenever I order a sandwich, I also substitute the baguette with the croissant; it's life changing and I can't get enough! Being the carb queen that I am, I pick up a chocolate twist once in a while too. 
As for the drinks they offer, I can say their fresh juices and smoothies are just as delicious. I am big fan of their mango smoothie. It pairs well with their salads. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I can't rave about that, but I've heard good things from friends. 
One thing that is annoying about coming here is that it gets packed during the lunch hour. It's a small space and usually one cashier so if you're in a rush, I would avoid coming around 11:00-12:30.

Aside from the lucky locals that know about this cafe, I imagine that it is also a popular breakfast/lunch destination for the surrounding business folks, as it is located in a considerably large, fairly occupied plaza.  

We approached the counter and browsed the menu for a few moments when we were warmly greeted by Olivier.  From soups and sandwiches, to drinks and desserts, he wasted no time in explaining everything thoroughly, including several vegetarian options.  Olivier's knowledge and passion about the menu made him easily identifiable as the owner, and we did not hesitate in going with his recommendations.  

I ordered the Morroccan Chicken [sandwich] and an organic, non-sweetened, pomegranate iced tea.  My boyfriend got the Curry Chicken [sandwich].  Note that if we didn't have a time constraint that day, we would have dined in, but we were in the middle of house-hunting, so we placed our order to go.  It wasn't until we sat down to wait for our food that I began to appreciate everything else about the place.

The cafe is designed simply, yet elegantly, and allows for plenty of natural light, as it has windows in place of walls.  This gives it a pleasant ""sidewalk cafe"" feel, and also keeps them connected to their outdoor seating.  The kitchen and service staff are all in plain sight, and they seem to share Olivier's friendly and hospitable demeanor.  

Our order came out timely.  I took my first bite as soon as we got in the car, because I wanted to taste my food while it was still fresh.  The Morroccan sandwich was delicious!  The African spices were just right, and it had enough sauce to add flavor, but not so much that it made the bread soggy.  Speaking of which, the bread was perfectly toasted.  After cleansing my palate with my pomegranate iced tea, I took a bite of the Curry sandwich.  It was excellent too (and this is from someone that can get pretty fussy about curry)!  It reminded me of one of my favorite French-inspired, Vietnamese dishes --a spicy curry with a baguette on the side.  I imagine both sandwiches to be just as good if they were prepared vegetarian, which replaces the chicken with grilled eggplant, and am looking forward to trying this at my next visit.  

I already had a feeling while I was looking at the menu, but was further convinced after trying the food, that Baguette Cafe uses quality, hand-picked ingredients.  This is one of my favorite types of places--a place that reminds us that food can be wholesome and tasty at the same time.

Seating available inside and outside. 

Past few times I have tried this place, it is the owner who has been taking my order. SUPER friendly and really knowledgeable... think i remember someone telling me he is a school trained chef? ANYWAY. Very nice greeting and always suggests their daily specials. OH also another note about this guy.. He will secretly take note of your name if you pay by credit card, and he will give a personalized good-bye as your leave ! very surprised ! Also ! they do not do numbers or what not to ""signify"" where the order goes. If you tell them where you are sitting, it will get to you in a timely manner. 

One of their most popular sandwiches is the Chicken Curry Sandwich. Past 2 times, that is what i have ordered. Spice level made to your desire. Moist chicken, melted cheese, and a nice yellow curry sauce super flavorful all in a nice toasted ciabatta-like bread. 

Both times that i have sat at the restaurant, i have paired with my sandwich, a hot Mocha Rocha. HUGE cup (with a tiny handle) topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce and whipped cream (if preferred). Nice flavor. Not too sweet, not too strong (for the not-so-much coffee drinkers) 

The other time, i ordered a pork loin sandwich. I actually forgot what the sauce is but it pairs with the moist cooked pork loin really well. Shaved fresh Parmesan cheese, organic spinach, and tomatoes. Wonderful combination in a toasted bread. 

Very nice atmosphere and good tasting food. Really do plan on coming back later in the year, when the weather is SLIGHTLY warmer and sit outside to enjoy the sun while either working or reading a book. been searching everywhere for a NICE place to hang out on a clear sunny day (one of the few very lacking things in this city)",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,2,4,taIYZnA4WH9WJ9nYKLTeJg

Food: 5/5
One of my favorite things to get is their croissant sandwiches. They always come fresh and hot when served to you. Another sandwich I highly recommend is the Pesto with bacon. In all honesty, all of the sandwiches I have tried have been very tasty. 

Drinks: 5/5
I have tried both their mango and strawberry smoothies and both are amazing. I love how fresh the fruit is and you can tell it isn't artificial flavoring or anything. I also really love their espresso drinks and I highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha Frappe. It's way better than an overrated Starbucks drink. 

Staff: 5/5
I've come here frequently and every time the staff never fails to treat me kindly. They are all very friendly and will cater to whatever you need. If you need help figuring out what to get they are more than happy to recommend some of their items for you.

I was so excited that I decided to find a French restaurant and try real French food. Went on Yelp (of course) and found Baguette Cafe. Came here for brunch the following morning. The owner Olivier greeted me and started to talking to me. I have never met this kind of a welcoming person filled with energy and shining eyes. He introduced me to his workers which I found out later were his family members. And I felt like we knew each other for a long time. That was amazing.
He gave me some advice on what to try, and, finally I decided to go with chipotle sandwich with salad, berry torte and some iced tea. My order came fast enough. Everything was very delicious. I'm happy that I was here and definitely this place will be one of my favorite places.
When I was going to leave them Olivier shook my hand and thanked me for visiting them. I was so happy with this kind of service. Many business owners must learn a lot from him. 
The only bad thing was that they are far away from center and it is a little hard to find them.

Oliver introduced himself and was super nice explaining the menu and the specials of the day.

He had me at vegan carrot and coconut hot soup......a ordered a cup as soon as he explained it and YUM it was good. Sooo good I was dipping my sandwich in it.
I ordered a vegan sandwich on a ciabatta bread it had roasted vegetables, hummus, greens, eggplant and avocado. But the super shining star on the sandwich was WALNUT PESTO. I don't know how they made said pesto and I don't even really like walnuts but WOW I need more. 
I don't fool around when it comes to coffee. I like it black and preferably bathtub sized. Well, Oliver has that...22oz of fresh hot burn your mouth off ILLY coffee. As some people have described it a ""bowl"" of coffee. He did offer that they have soy, coconut, or almond milk if you wanted it. How nice?!

Hubby got the breakfast special which was a croissant with egg whites and I think it had tomatoes on it also. It's comes with a standard size coffee and a cup of orange juice. It looked beautiful and he said it was super yummy!!! I think all three were $5-6? I can't remember, but I remember thinking it was very good value.

Keep in mind. THIS IS NOT FAST FOOD. It started to get busy as we sat down to our table but I'm guessing it took about 30-35 minutes to get our food. I don't care. I watched how carefully this lady crafted our items. Two thumbs up. My sandwich was very filling and hubby gladly ate every last bite. He even ""dipped"" because I made him ;) he loved it.

The location is hard to find due to it being in a business park. But it is like a hidden gem or a treasure. Once you have found the shop, the rewards are worth it. 

Think about it... walking into a friendly warm atmosphere with fresh croissant and coffee aroma in the air then greeted by the most friendly coffee shop owner ever then enjoying a nice cup of illy coffee or a small parisian meal, life is so beautiful. 

I have been to sunrise and sambalatte and sunrise was my favorite before but as it is growing, I feel less connection with the coffee shop (I believe coffee shops should provide not only delicious coffee, but also interaction and lifestyle). I found Baguette cafe from a friends recommendation and now it is the only place I would go for coffee.

Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted by Oliver whom I assume is the owner. He was friendly and welcoming, but most importantly appeared extremely passionate about what he was doing. He went over several items that just finished baking and even made a couple of suggestions. Ultimately we settled on the pesto chicken panini and the brie panini with a white mocha coffee. The ingredients were fresh and quality while the portions were fair for the price. I enjoyed the pesto panini especially.

So, we decided to give it a try and wow we are not disappointed. It was a beautiful Thursday morning 730 am and temp was perfect at 73. We ordered The Pesto Sandwhich for me, Croissant & Egg with Bacon and Ham for my husband and chocolate croissant for the kids.

I love what I ordered. Avocado, pesto, sundried tomatoes with chicken and bacon between toasted baguette. Need I say more? ;) My husband liked the flakiness of his croissant. The kids enjoyed their chokie croissants as well. They also offer fresh pressed apple juice which my kids ordered. The coffee they serve is Illy. We ordered cappuccino, which is okay. They have this biscuit latte which I might try next time. 

Overall, experience was great. Their place is awesome too. You can sit outside, al fresco. The staff were kind and friendly.

1719775,2017-09-19,0,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I want to love this place, it has beautiful food, great ingredients, pleasant atmosphere, BUT the service could improve. It's friendly yet very slooooooww.....In 2017, I have dined at Baguette Café three (3) times for lunch. Twice on a weekday & once on the weekend. We know to go early in order to get a table & beat the crowds. It is a very popular lunch destination. 

Each of (3) times, food items have come out in no particular order, so don't plan to actually dine with your table mates (pet peeve). Your companion will be through with their salad, before your sandwich arrives. Or their soup will get cold while politely waiting for your croissant to be put on the table. 

Today, 1/2 our order didn't come out. They do not seem to serve ""first come first serve"", as has been sited by other reviewers. We had to go inside and ask for our order. Oh, and then go in again to fetch the silverware staff forgot to give us when we were in gathering our food the first time.

So if you want to try the café, lower your expectations to realize you will have extremely slow & haphazard service. You likely cannot make it your lunch in 1 hour. If you can roll with that, you may enjoy the meal.

I wish management would make a few changes to correct these service issues to make for an overall better experience. And, I wish they would realize it might be a good idea to get their weekday lunch service doable in less than 45 minutes for those who work.. 

I really do want to love this place.

1730083,2014-06-11,1,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I am so glad I discovered Baguette Cafe. It is a very small cafe in a hard to find area. Unfortunately they are open business hours and M-F only which is a downside if you don't work or live in the area. As far as the food-it is top notch and my absolute favorite place to get a sandwich. I feel the ingredients used are fresh. I love any panini that includes the eggplant. It is well cooked and flavored. 

I also love the soups. Every soup I have tried has been pure deliciousness. I've been told they are all homemade and you can tell. 

I also enjoy their iced tea choices. I appreciate a restaurant that has brewed flavored tea, not just the plain unsweetened black tea. 

One time they messed up my order and gave me the wrong order and I did not notice until I was at home. I called to tell Oliver and he offered a free sandwich the next time I come in. That is good customer service and I liked that a lot.

This place has kept me coming back for more every chance I get when I am not working. If they had longer hours and weekend hours I would probably be here more often. 

I can tell the owners passion every time I have come in here. He is always talking to his customers and is genuine with them.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,0,1,5,3-NY_MEF0rmGMpMOJ-bIGg

Although it has a Frenchie name, I was expecting this restaurant to be an ""american sandwich"" place. It surprised me with the lovely food and service there. I customized my croissant with curry chicken . The croissant was amazing, I would say the best I've ever had. However, my only complaint is the location. This is in the middle of nowhere and if you're not living in Vegas and you're not driving, it's about $40 cab from the strip to the cafe. So I spent approximately $80 just to come here and go back.

With the great service we received all around, the food is delightful! It's a smaller quaint dining establishment with patio seating as well. We luckily were able to place our order before the lunch rush.  I think there was a line the entire time we were there.  The secret is out or I am just late to the party.

Since I was eating lunch with a friend who shares everything with me, I was able to taste an abundance of menu options.  What shocked me the most was the Tuna Sandwich.  I'm usually not one to order this but I'm so glad we did.  It was light, fresh and not overly fishy.  It was topped with tomato, egg and fresh greens.  I adore this sandwich.  The Pesto Chicken Panini was no slouch either.  The sandwich included the toppings of avocado, mozzarella and bacon.  You can't go wrong with those ingredients.  Delicious!  Each sandwich had a small green salad on the side.  

Now I'm not going to leave out the scrumptious desserts we indulged.  Tiramisu is always a favorite of mine.  Yes. It's wonderful.  The Chocolate Croissant was really fresh.  It contained the perfect amount of chocolate so it didn't take away from the croissant itself.

1800468,2016-07-10,0,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"We were looking for a local place for a quiet Sunday brunch.  Checked out the Yelp reviews. The first 2 places I called each estimated a30 minute wait. When I called Baguette Cafe, I was told no wait at all.  Now that could be good news, or I could be bad news. Was there a reason this was the only place with no wait on a Sunday at noon? I felt it was worthwhile to take a chance rather than wait 30 minutes for lunch someplace else. Turned out really well.
While the address is on Sunset, it would be much easier to find if you enter off of the 215 freeway Service Road (just east of Ikea). This place is truly a well-hidden gem. It is located in the very back of an office complex off of Sunset. The restaurant itself is rather small with indoor seating for about 24 people. We got there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon so we were able to take advantage of the outdoor patio seating, which is absolutely delightful. We shared the vegetable quiche and the prosciutto quiche. Each was very fresh with a good quality crust. Very very tasty. I also ordered a cup of coffee. This had to be the largest cup I've ever received. Good quality strong flavorful coffee.

1809890,2014-06-28,3,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"We decided to try this place out because of all the good reviews. However, we were extremely disappointed because of the ***VERY*** small sandwiches and the fact we had to go to another place just after eating here to eat lunch again because their portions are more like an appetizer. And, I am 150 lbs and my wife, 120 lbs so we are small people with a normal appetite.

I don't know how places get by with a $ sign on Yelp when this could not be further from the truth. Their sandwiches are more like 1/2 of a typical sandwich and very stingy on the additional items like lettuce and tomato (micro bits and pieces). I told one of the owners we were disappointed and he blamed it on the baguette company not being consistent with their bread sizes. Come on, if the bread comes in too small,  you don't just rip off your customer,  you let them know up front and give a discount or something extra.

This place is so tight and out of touch with reality that they give you just a few tiny pieces of lettuce on the plate which they called a small salad but it wasn't enough for a new born rabbit. Seriously, to see it was to believe it...they had to try hard to tear the lettuce that small. 

So, if you want to spend $16 on one whole sandwich (two of their sandwiches x $8) to get full go ahead. But this place is off the list!! Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but the the prices per portion would make this place easily $$$ restaurant!  And, the people were nice but I'm not in the habit of donating to the success of restaurants without something in return.  No thanks!

And, this is a legitimate review by an engineer and his wife with no ax-to-grind against this establishment or owners. There was another couple that came in with us at the same time. It was their first time too and they left with the same disappointment as us, and we both questioned whether or not the owners may be better at generating false Yelp reviews than they are at running a fair establishment.",ieF5HygMipxxReyxwKbbVQ,6,2,2,PoqmNsrJc-aOGex9tFu3Xw

1947525,2011-01-16,2,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I find it very refreshing to find a locally owned business such as Baguette Cafe. 

I came right as they were closing and the owner Olivier hooked it up with a deal on some of the baked goods. 

There was something heavenly about the croissant. Even if it had been sitting all day since it was baked and was past it's freshness prime and a bit cold it maintained a crunchy flaky exterior while having a tender bite and slightly chewy texture on the inside. If this is what the croissant becomes after a few hours it must be ten times as better fresh.

The soup, Mexican vegetable, was just absolutely divine. The soup it self could stand up on it's own but when you bite into the large cuts of assorted vegetables the melodies of the ingredients along with the broth just melds together in your mouth. The bits of lime in the soup add an excellent touch as they're able to retain their individual characteristic.

The pannini press was cold and it would have taken too much time to fire it up again so i asked for a cold chipotle chicken sandwich. Two more snags, they ran out of sun dried tomatoes and there was no more baguette bread which they normally use to make the sandwiches. I informed them it was fine and if there was anything they could do. Tomatoes were taken out and the sandwich was constructed on this roll. I took the foil wrapped sucker home and baked it in my toaster oven for about 10 minutes. WHOA!! What ever that roll was i want more of it. The crust was just absolutely divine. Crunchy and chewy and satisfying. Actual slices of chicken breast were used instead of deli sliced and the sauces were tasty. Could have used a bit more of a spicy kick but they this is a modified version.

I came here during their closing process and as a result got the day's leftovers. The left overs pretty much made my day. The bread is absolutely divine and the soup needs the skills of a poet to properly give it credit. 

If you are to come here and try this place out i would come at opening time (0700) when everything is fresh.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,6,2,5,9DdUf2p-tT_F6Kqv2UdX6w

freshly baked bread and an eclectic selection of tasty ingredients.

The soups are lovingly made from scratch

Oliver made our visit feel more like going to a friend's home than a cafe.
He is warm and inviting, super amicable, and to hear him gush about the food, makes you realize how much love and pride goes into the cooking.

Cream of Celery Root: Not watery, Not thick, Just Right.. Super Fresh and Very soothing! 

Cream of Split Pea: a little thicker in conistency, another straight, simple, fresh approach with the ingredients. Nice!

* Soups change on a daily basis.. ""Cream of..""

Croissant with omelet and bacon: Airy and Flaky croissant, thin egg omelet, meaty bacon, 

The Turkey Sandwich: Simple, Clean and Healthy Turkey Sand.. Local Fresh Ingredients makes the difference!

Chocolate Croissant: Croissant itself one of the Best I've had! Unmatched combination of butteriness, softness and flakiness. The chocolate stuffing wasn't sweet nor bitter but just right.

Illy Coffee: I don't drink coffee much but this had a distinct flavor and had a bit of bitter bite to it. Different from Starbucks and Coffee Bean in comparison.

Funky Monkey: Delicious, Refreshing and a little different in a banana way?!.. 

* Got to meet the owner (Oliver), he was working the cashier at the time. I asked him to suggest a popular item to have for a first timer..

Sandwiches were made fresh to order, brought out wrapped up tight and hot to the touch. Wait time was a reasonable ten minutes.

Chipotle was delish, with chipotle sauce, chicken, bacon, avocado, and pepper jack cheese- lots of flavor and a tiny bit of kick without too much spice.
Eggplant sandwich was better than expected, with fresh-grilled veggie, mozzarella, and tomato pesto, served on a fresh and chewy baguette that held up despite the moisture of the sauces and the ample amount of stuffing in the sandwich itself.

Soup was good and clearly homemade- flavorful and creamy without feeling heavy. Cup is a tiny portion, BF inhaled it and I barely got a taste. Didn't expect him to enjoy this flavor but it was gone so fast, he must have! ;)

The cramped maze of chairs and lack of line do not help in the slightest. I, for one, enjoy perusing the counters and seeing the baked goods. But, unless you do this between people standing in line...this isn't going to happen here. 

While the place is visually interesting (there's plenty of Look-At-Me hipsters manning the counters), I appreciate people wearing aprons. and the girl working prep looked to be wearing a bra, and not an actual top. Worse, there is no point in wearing gloves if you make a sandwhich, close a door, and go back to the sandwhichs. That kind of defeats the purpose of gloves in the first place.

With all the amazing reviews for Baguette Cafe I was excited to see what all the positive hype was about. Thankfully, Baguette Cafe did not disappoint! The restaurant was somewhat tricky to find located in the back of a business plaza but well worth the hunt.

The owner Oliver worked the register and asked if it was my first time at Baguette Cafe. When I said yes he excitedly went over the menu for me and explained the finer details. I ended up ordering a half and half ""The Chicken Sandwich"" and roasted red pepper soup. My girlfriend ordered ""The Chicken Salad"" and potato soup. The order arrived promptly and wonderfully presented on a small square plate and small colored cups for the soups. It looked so well made and dressed on the plate my excitement became overwhelming.

The chicken sandwich was delicious on a fresh, home made baguette, with cheddar cheese, tomato, mixed greens, bacon, superbly seasoned chicken, and a very nice tomato pesto. The ratio of meat, cheese, and bread was perfect and the sandwich oozed with flavor as it melted in my mouth. The red pepper soup was surprising. It tasted similar to a tomato basil which much more of a pepper kick. It had a light creamy taste very rich with flavor. It complimented my sandwich well. I had a bite of my girlfriend's combo and her salad, although dressed with a vinaigrette unsuitable for my tastes, had a nice flavor. Her soup was possibly the best potato soup I have ever had.

The cafe is welcoming and decorated with white walls, warm red-orange accents and yellow hanging light fixtures. It suits the establishment and their lunch driven menu well. The owner Oliver was very pleasant and assisted in the overall great vibe. The prices are very reasonable and go well with the perfectly sized portions.

The food was OK, I've been here a few times. It's a bit over priced, very small portioned (the key ingredients a starbucks sorority girl loves), but I suppose they have to squeeze every penny out of each patron. So what's up with the one star review? I got food poisoning. Bad. I ordered their quiche de jour (lorraine) which unmistakably is what made me terribly ill. I should have cancelled the order when I saw the quiche on the counter not refrigerated, then cut to be warmed. I didn't, probably because I was tired from hiking and didn't want to get into it. Besides, I'm well traveled in undeveloped countries and have a very strong stomach. Like other foods I'd ordered, it was simply alright. Unlike other meals, this was a hospital visit.

The entirety of my first visit here was met with unbridled satisfaction.  I arrived early for a meeting and ordered an omelet sandwich with a large hot tea, salad and juice all for just 5 dollars.  I was taken aback by their prices, the food tastes like it belongs in a much more expensive environment.

I could go on about the quality of the cuisine, but the service is what really got me hooked.  A woman named Shelby asked me my name and continually asked me how I liked everything throughout my meal, she even wanted to see how I would react to my first bite.  THAT'S how much they care about their customers as well as their food. 

Pretty soon everyone else behind the counter was asking me how the food was.  It wasn't annoying at all as they all were addressing me by my first name.  I went all giddy over how personable they were being.  I even overheard the server refer to me as ""the gentleman over at this table"".

I appreciate all of their selections because they're not too heavy, and you're not filled with a lot regret afterwards. 

Quiches were a decent breakfast as well. Eggs were fluffy and soft, but the crust was not as flaky and buttery as I had hoped.

Everything lives up to par. The food, coffee, and service. 

It's a small little place hidden in a business complex, but if you're smart enough to find it - then you deserve to eat there !! Think of it as a treasure hunt. If you take the time to find it, you'll be rewarded in the end. 

The owner, Olivier, is a very friendly man. If it's your first time, he gladly explains almost everything he has on his menu. And what I liked most, is that he takes the time to find out your name and shake your hand. Not many establishments do that. 

Although he does have a set menu, the soups, quiches, & tarts seem to change almost every day. Plus, I do believe he just has other random food items available each day, so be sure to ask him what he has for the day [though, I'm sure he'll tell you before you get the chance to ask]. 

I had the chicken curry sandwich, an item not regularly available on his menu. Damn, it was delicious. Good flavored curry, tender chicken, great baguette, plus some fresh herbs and such. I hope he has this on a more regular basis. 

For you vegetarian and/or vegan folk, he has quite a few options on his menu, and he said he was looking to add more. 

The croissants there are supposed to be really great. I wish I could confirm this, but unfortunately I'm not a big fan of croissants. They're just too buttery and flaky for my taste [a lot of people judge me for this, but it's OK. =p]. But, I will comment that they did LOOK good. 

Overall, a great place to meet a friend for lunch. Or get some studying done [ free wifi !]. Plus, with an always changing selection of food, you'll always have a chance to try something new. When you go, be sure and eat a croissant for me.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,10,7,5,yayy9Xfif4Ye1fUITpvpxw

(3).

This place obviously caters to the office buildings nearby given it's remote location hidden by the towering adjacent structures. We wandered in while the suits were getting their fix of illy coffee with lunch.

First of all, despite it's moniker, this place has nothing to do with baguettes. We ordered two sandwiches - one ham and cheese and one pressed panini with a curry chicken filling.

The bread is more of a ciabatta-type affair - a 6 inch loaf with a dense texture and a little mildy unpleasant hard chewy crust. This is not the light centered loaves with the pleasant crust that I was anticipating.

The ingredients inside the sandwich were very good - the slices of chicken in the curry sandwich was sufficiently moist and tender while the sauce was pleasant. The ham and cheese sandwich was made with fresh ingredients albeit the bread was only okay for me. 

I was a little struck by how disorganized the people in the back were - there were three sandwich makers/servers in the back that were looking for direction from the cashier who I believe is the owner. This unfortunately was sufficiently distracting enough (plus he took a phone order in the interim) that it took about 10 minutes for us to place our orders.

Yeah - this place serves a better sandwich than your average place but is it something to go back for or drive across town? I'm not so sure. 3 stars.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,7,3,yppydLW3L6-1zXNmg8kWmA

This is the restaurant that made me say, ""I've got to go to France."" This is the restaurant my sandwich-avoiding husband never says ""no"" to... and the menu is mostly sandwiches. 

My fave is the grilled eggplant panini and whatever the daily soup is. (The onion soup - so often made with beef stock elsewhere - is vegetarian here! And the little toasted bread slices they serve with the soup - crunchy and chewy at once? Mmm!) 

The three-cheese panini is also tasty, which is saying something because I find gorgonzola to be unacceptably strong except in itty-bitty amounts. But this is the sandwich that made me say, ""Okay, this is why people like stinky cheeses."" (Everything about Baguette Cafe makes me chatty.)

The bread.... ahh.... (I'm speechless. Gotta get to France. Gotta get to France.)

Oh, and don't miss the cream of carrot soup with coconut milk and fresh ginger. (Which I see, as I type, gets name-checked in other reviews. In what world is carrot soup such a star?! In a world where everything at the Baguette Cafe tastes like sparkling mouth-magic!) 

Look, I'm not a soup-fiend. I like soup, but I don't take a detour for it, not on a buffet line and not on the road... until Baguette Cafe. I find myself wondering - from my home a mere crow mile away - what the day's soup is and, shazam, next thing you know I'm hanging out by the counter, watching Olivier (the master of the magic), Olivier's mom (so friendly, so skilled), and the ever-enthusiastic Shelby do their thing.

And on days when their ""thing"" includes quiche, my husband does the eye-flutter of bliss. ""The best I've had in my life,"" he says.

I'm not sure I'm exaggerating when I say this is the best food in Las Vegas. Yes, it's in a strip mall in an office park. No, it's not fancy inside (but it is very clean, comfortable, with the option outdoor seating). Yes, the menu is mostly soup and sandwich-based (but with smoothies and frou-frou coffee drinks and a case full of delicious, delicious cookies, muffins, and French pastries). No, you can't visit after 5 o'clock (and that's probably why there isn't a line across the parking lot).

Heaven knows we have so many wonderful places to eat in this city, but the taste here is really special, bringing a non-stop complexity of ""umami"" - a word I hate to use (buzzword bingo!), but which perfectly describes the fullness of flavour in every bite of anything you get here.

Add a bottle of ginger ale from the ""Fresh Ginger"" people, a spicy nearly ""ginger brew""-type drink where you can see the ginger and sugar sediment at the bottom of the pale liquid, and your lunch will be complete.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,13,8,5,t6QfnPJdf-JHmmaeqrfDiA

A favorite spot for almost three years, I walked in this morning with thoughts of fresh croissants, melted cheese, tomato pesto, and omelets, but when I saw a new menu the words açaí bowl, I went in that direction. Olivier's super cool mom described the preparation: organic açaí blended with almond milk, banana, and a touch of agave, served with granola and sweet pineapple- ananas, as she told me in French. :) Later, Olivier asked how I enjoyed the bowl and mentioned that it was inspired by his Hawaiian vacation-- not Rio, but that's OK. (mental image of Olivier at Carnavál carrying pineapples on his head goes here)

It was different from a traditional açaí bowl, but very flavorful and enjoyable. The Amazonian açaí was not thick nor overwhelmed by banana. If you prefer a smoothie texture, ask if they can accommodate. The pineapple was perfectly ripe. They carry a selection of organic bottled beverages, and the grapefruit ginger juice paired nicely with the bowl. If I type the word açaí one more time, this review will be filtered as Portuguese.

The best soups in Las Vegas are found at Baguette Cafe. I'm looking forward to summer if only for the chilled gazpacho with crunchy granité and whipped creme fraiche. I usually order a half sandwich and soup combo and am satisfied with the portions. The quiche, breakfast pastries, tarts, and desserts are all excellent.

It is kind of in a weird place in the back of a business park off the highway...not exactly front and center and not exactly easy to figure out how to get to, but once you are there, it is like a little oasis of calm! 

They have a nice menu of salads, sandwiches, fresh juice, coffee and sweets, quiche and other snacks. Three members of our party had sandwiches, all served on lovely fresh baguette with side salads. All of them were devoured without even an offer for anyone else to have a bite....I had their roasted veggie quiche of the day, which also came with a side salad, plus a fresh pressed green juice. I loved my meal - perfect amount, great flavor, fresh, and a good value for so much healthy food in one serving!

I also really liked the location - once you find it, there is plenty of parking, and there is indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is comprised of a bunch of tables under trees and umbrellas. The day we were here it was sunny and in the low 70s - extremely pleasant to sit outside and eat and enjoy the weather! 

I am only giving 4 stars because it is a little tricky to find (we drove around for a good 10 min, in and out of plazas, trying to figure out how to get to it) and also because despite them giving us a number for our table, we received several orders for other people before they finally served us our food - so it seems their ordering system or their servers are very confused....and the food takes a little longer so be prepared to wait (however, it IS worth the wait!).",xKwdQNkBZIpwKLWYOlyz9Q,1,1,4,rbnZAcoplrtfRv0wlXINpg

From the minute you enter you get the cozy, little neighborhood cafe feel. The place smelled amazing, full of fresh pastries, coffee and delicious sandwhiches and salads. 

It is small so they can't seat many people inside so go early before the rush or you might end up taking it to go.  It's a fresh, unique cafe with a variety of sandwhichea, large portioned salads and thirst quenching coffees, juices and teas. 

It does seem like a spot that is utilized mostly by the employees within the business complex, huge business complex so I am sure they get plenty busy. I'll admit that's why I stopped in, it's next to my building and I needed a quick bite. Sure happy I did stop in though, I'll be going back!

The service was great as well. We were welcomed right as we walked in, the girl who took our order was incredibly friendly , the guy who dropped our food off came back to check on us and as we left everyone said thank you and good bye! Awesome!!",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,4,2,5,QMzp1d-Dxf6zGK6GVFiN4g

It was breakfast time so I got the omelet sandwich in a freshly baked croissant and a funky monkey blended drink, which is a mocha drink with banana.  They even did it decaf!  The funky monkey was delicious and the omelet was a nice surprise.  Spinach, a variety of flavorful cheeses, extremely yummy.

That's how good this place is. 

Their food is diverse and their flavors are unique. They mesh the flavors of different cuisines together so well that you feel like you're eating all of your favorite foods at once. At least, that's how I felt. :)

Just, come here. Make time. Go out of your way. 

The menu is simple. Salads. Sandwiches. Soup. Pastry. Coffee. Along with daily specials that are to die for. 

I had the yellow chicken curry panini the other day and I think I visited heaven for a moment. The curry sauce was perfect and there was also mozzarella cheese and other ingredients I can't remember because all I kept saying to myself was, ""this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten."" 

Also, I ate a chocolate twist croissant. The chocolate filling had some type of creamy flavor - oh my goodness. Flaky, soft, fresh and delicious. 

Please open on the weekends? Even just one day?

(Edit: I also have to tell you how wonderfully friendly the family/friends are that run this place. I only assume they are friends or related because they seem to really connect and get along well while they are working together and putting orders in. They are terribly nice and do such a great job of explaining menu items and specials. They also asked my name and remembered it!

Background info: I just moved here from NJ/NYC and have an obsession with croissants. My friend recommended this place to me... and as I'm searching yelp for nearby lunch options, I notice my office is a mile away.

Now, back to the actual review. Service and cleanliness, top notch. Food... AMAZING. Had the pesto sandwich on a croissant (of course I would). Each bite was perfect. So perfect that for dessert, I ordered ANOTHER croissant (plain this time, but just as good). Looking forward to trying other options on their menu.

You will have nothing but found memories of walking the streets of Paris (not so much street but get my drift) and walking into Cafe smelling fresh baked pastries, daily soups, and fresh baked bread most notable baguettes. The irony is this gem always been in my backyard neighborhood. Shout out too my beast training partner Suzy H for showing me this gem after our beast bike ride not think of better place too refuel!!! 

Unfortunately the only thing with this gem is words out. So we were very lucky too find spot too sit down for lunch at prime time 12. But they do have outside seating and few inside or if anything can always order too go. It SOOO worth the wait!!

I order the chicken pesto sandwich and we shared the granola bowl. I mention many times but really believe no matter sandwich its ONLY as good as the bread. The baguette. It bread from heaven. Truly  only one other experience that had that baguette had that authentic everything on point. It nice crispy crust one that bread the bread away with hands, It nice moist and hot on the inside. I could just go bread crazy eat baguettes all day, Inside find perfectly cooked chicken breast nice moist and hot just like the bread. The pesto spread was awesome! Basil, pine nuts, cheese, and chicken is there better combination for chicken sandwich. Maybe the curry chicken sure bookmark that one for next time. I like the little (literally) salad couple bites. I like the salad dressing on top of it. Not sure if house salad dressing but in any case could have had big salad be happy for lunch. The granola I really enjoyed. It came with fresh cut banana on top and side of milk. We tried it both ways. I prefer it with the milk but either case really good. Suzy nice enough got too try her acai bowl. It first time tried one. It was delicious. All the menu items are under ten dollars for the most part so definitely affordable lunch/breakfast spot. 

I love the fact the owner Oliver very much puts his stamp on the restaurant. He constantly on the go walking around asking customers for their input and making sure everyone happy! The acai bowl something relatively new on the menu asking Suzy her thought on it if something that could improve the dish on. I respect any small business owner that always willing too listen too customer feedbacks. You can tell much passion goes into all the dishes at Baguette Cafe. Not just the owner but the entire staff is great! Friendly, helpful, and even if not have the answer they go back too the kitchen get one.

The quiche is sublime (and I've never used this word before. I just couldn't think of a bigger superlative.) With fluffy filling and crust that is moist and buttery.  Don't forget the soups, which are subtly flavored but extremely well-developed. Everything is delicately flavored so don't expect big, bold tastes. They allow the natural flavors of the ingredients to come through. Try to think about a cafe for someone with a more refined palette.

We said we were newcomers, so he introduced himself and explained the menu. It's a small cafe, but they have so many options to choose from. We got the Curry Chicken sandwich with a Chai Latte, an Egg & turkey Baguette with a White chocolate Latte, and an order of lentil soup. At first we thought the portions looked rather small, but don't let that fool you...it is really filling, very tasty, and reasonably priced. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the soup and the small salads that came with the sandwiches. They were a little on the plain side. 

I would definitely come back and try the quiches and the croissants, as that's what I believe they're known for.

We were greeted by a European man with a lovely accent, who was very helpful. I settled on the chipotle sandwich with chicken and bacon, ginger ale and the infamous chocolate tart. My total was around $17, so I was expecting greatness. 

Service was excellent. Our food was out in less than 5 minutes. I was a little disappointed when I looked down at my plate and saw a white roll, what looked like deli chicken and a side of lightly dressed greens. There was absolutely nothing special about the sandwich. It tasted good, but it was pretty plain. Someone in my party ordered the chicken salad. It literally looked like a bagged salad, and it was around $8. Quinzos, Earl of Sandwiches, Subway, Starbucks... just naming a few places were you can buy a cheaper, tastier sandwich or salad.

The iced Carmel macchiato rivaled Stsrbucks and my dad enjoyed a natural ginger ale.
I recommend the 3 cheese panini and the only thing that would have made it better would have been tomato bisque was the soup of the day cuz the weather was overcast with hint of winter chill.

Olivier is a doll.  I initially came back to this place on my way home from the doctor's office and hadn't been back in 2 weeks.  Immediately, he says, ""Hello, Kimberly.""  (I had paid with a card the previous time.)  I was floored.  This place can get packed.  There are tons of regulars, and he remembered my name after I ordered a cup of coffee and a bottle of ginger ale one time to go?  My order changed from iced tea to go to a salad and iced tea for dining in.  I figured I could read through some things there.  He sees my laptop and asked if I needed wifi (free and secure).  It sounded good to me, and the password is just so upbeat and positive like the vibe you get in the shop.

As for the food, everything I have had there is DE-LISH!  I've eaten my way through the salads.  My favorite is the one with the jimica.  The soups change daily, so be sure to ask if the listed soups are for today.  All of the sandwiches and pastries are amazing.  Everything is always fresh and organic.  If you're there and the quiche isn't sold out try it!  Also, I've heard the chocolate twist are a must try.  (I don't like chocolate.  I know, I know.  Something is wrong with me.)

Lastly, the drinks...  The ginger ale that they carry is a favorite.  It's not homemade, but it has real ginger in it.  If you are a ginger lover, check it out.  The espresso and brewed coffee are both Illy.  I am not sure of the brand of iced tea, but it is fantastic and never over steeped.  I've also seen families come in on a three day weekend and order hot chocolate and swear that it's one of the best in the city.

Not every place lives up to the hype.  That said, I find it even rarer for a place to exceed expectations.  Baguette Café has done that for me!

Baguette Café is one of the absolute best breakfast/brunch/lunch cafes you will find for the dollar!  Please know that I am way more into savory Items that sweet varieties.  I have a lot of friends that shell out 4 strong stars here for the pastries, but I am so into their savory items!  It's an easy 5 stars in my book.

Chef Olivier is one of the nicest and more engaging owners you will meet.  Passionate about food, he takes time with any willing audience to impart a depth of knowledge about the products being used in your meal.  This may not change the way your meal tastes, but it certainly enhances the experience for anyone that remotely cares about what they ingest.  

The quiches here might be the best I've had in Vegas...and if not the best, they are certainly in the conversation.  A light and buttery crust gives way to a balanced and scrumptious filling.  Their soups are equally enjoyable.  They change regularly, but are consistently wonderful!  I also have a lot of love for their grilled sandwiches--The Curry, Blue Brie, and Moroccan all worth trying out.  Limited hours prevent some from enjoying Baguette Café, so check out the days and hours of operation before you head over here...but do make a point to stop by and enjoy their offerings!

As an insightful reviewer has pointed out, the best way to get there, if you are going west on 215, is to exit Buffalo and take Raphael Rivera.  That way you can avoid the Office Park maze.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,16,8,5,tv0KF1U1_gDYjyGhvsTZxg

The cookie was almost an inch thick!

WHEN: Monday through Friday from 7am-5pm.

WHERE: On Sunset & Durango, close to the corporate buildings.

WHY: For their tasty French baguettes.

WHAT: My best friend and I decided we needed to have lunch. And since I had heard such great reviews about this place, we decided to go and try it out.

First thing's first, I love Olivier!! Anything he said, I believed! And because he said the Yellow Curry baguette was one I should try, TRY is what I did. And yes, Olivier does it again! Such a great sandwich, with a touch of spice, and a cup of tomato basil soup... This had to be the best lunch I've ever had!

Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.

For dessert, we tried the newly made Peach Tart, which was UHHMAAYYYZIINNNGGGG! It was not too sweet, and just the right amount for both of us.

There is generally a decent wait during the lunch hour rush, but what would you expect from an extremely tasty place?
There is limited indoor seating for the cold winter months and hot summer days, it gets cramped fast, but luckily there is additional seating in the outdoor patio area for the many months of nice weather we get here in Vegas.

Pretty much everything you could want in a local cafe.
It's authentic, you walk in the door and are immediately greeted by Olivier, such a polite gentleman who is happy to explain menu items and has great suggestions.
There are always two made from scratch soups brewing, and there hasn't been one yet I disliked, sometimes I come just for a bowl of soup!

2633126,2013-10-26,7,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"Still 5* all the way, but after eight visits in five months from the extreme NW for the exquisite food, customer service and above and beyond caring: UPDATE! 

Olivier is as charming and caring about real, healthy, whole food options as ever. His parents work side-by-side with him: I LOVE that. I'd not been back since their early September holiday and even the cashier remembered the size and addition of ginger to my Green Juice. 

Yesterday was my Dad's first visit, though we have brought him take away before. He was enamored with the Proscuitto sandwich  with salami, fresh mozzarella greens, nuts and bleu cheese. As a Sicilian, he is very picky about his charcuterie and loved it. Olivier's Mom kindly explained to Dad that Proscuitto does not fare well with panini (heat press) and she was right; it tends to dry out the delicate meat. He also enjoyed Virgil's Zero Cola with Stevia: another testament to Olivier's belief in healthy, organic, non GMO product. As an 80%er in Clean Eats, his breads are the perfect spot to blow that 20% carb wad; reminds me of Baguettes you pick up at market in Paris, perfect combination of crunchy, light and chewy. Who could ask for more?

On previous visits and in correspondence, he had suggested and espoused the virtues of Coconut Oil in treating Alzheimer's. He was delighted to hear the folks are using it, and gave advice about other uses and types to incorporate into wellness lifestyle.  Was also not surprised he met two couples I know the day before; and remembered where they sat outside and their names! 

He truly cares for and remembers each and every customer, and trains his employees the same. This is why only recently he has decided to follow his dream of a wine Bistro in an adjacent store which will have extended hours. He does not want to expand and lose the personal touch they impart into every customer interaction. 

Chef always makes two soups daily and one is vegan. The offices, hospital and local Doctors offices order frequently en masse. Yet despite my pleas, he doesn't have a website, printed menu or even a business card. Food, family and healthy living are his passions. Maybe someday we will talk PR seriously, but humility is part of his charm. There is currently a spot on their Facebook page to vote for them in Chase's $250K neighborhood business grant program. Can't think of a more worthy choice. 

As we left yesterday, he was introducing a new client to the menu as he always does; but he stopped me and handed me a Financier that was indescribably perfect. Looks like a mini pound cake, but lighter than air, almond flour based and not too sweet. Mom the chocoholic LOVES the chocolate tart, as I do because he uses 80% cacao, giving it a dark chocolate and not cloyingly sweet taste. Every special item he has presented from his pastry offerings have been nothing short of perfect and worthy of extra cardio :) He follows Yelp and always thanks you for patronage and feedback. 

I drive far to enjoy his creations and dedication and am happy to have turned friends on to this delightful spot. Again, every menu item can be modified for any dietary concerns and be delicious. It is not for ""Super Size"" it folks. But, as in France, you get just enough of everything to be sated and not sporting a Food Baby. 

Merci Beaucoup, Olivier for being a wonderful person, Chef and advocate for fabulous food health, social responsibility and animal rights. See you soon!

2639437,2010-10-27,8,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I'm a true night owl at heart and I was so looking forward in trying this place that I literally set my alarm clock to wake up super early to beat the lunch crowd here.

The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.

I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the ""fire"" for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest. 

I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal. 

From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that. 

I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good. 

This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee.

It is one of those places where what you had last time was so good you want it again but then want to try something new because everything you have ever ordered was delicious.  So you sit there going back and forth in your head until it is your turn to order and you just blurt something out.  Or maybe that is just me.  The Pesto, Moroccan and Ham & Swiss Croissant are a few of my favorites.  Oh and the pastry case is to die for.  Get there early, items sell out.  I always hope for the chocolate tarte with fresh strawberries but I haven't had anything that wasn't amazing.  

I have had a few service issues.  More than once I have had to ask for drinks and pastries that were not brought out long after my food had arrived.  After the first time I tried waiting nearby to get my drink and items from the pastry case and was shooed away and told they will bring it to me.

It was perfectly crispy flaky on the outside with just a touch of custard running through curves. So good that I want one right now. We also tried the plain croissant and apricot croissant. I would definitely order the plain croissant. But I would pass on the apricot - it wasn't bad, but not nearly as good as the the other two. We ordered the quiche with pancetta. The flavor and the crust were amazing the only thing that held me back from a 5 star was the texture. It was so creamy (do they use cream cheese?)that at first I thought it was undercooked. It was still good - just was a little odd - but change is good right? The owners are from France and are the nicest!

The only reason Baguette Cafe does not get 5 stars is their limited seating.

Tucked in the back of an office complex Baguette Cafe is a wonderful lunch spot and patisserie seemingly lifted from the left bank and deposited in LV.  Olivier and his staff do an amazing job of pushing out quality sandwiches, soups, breads, teas, organic drinks, and wonderful desserts.

Attention to detail with his food is apparent, as quality ingredients and creative preparation are mixed with passion in every offering.  The emphasis is on fresh and simple, with detail down to the off-the-shelf drinks:  Olivier crowed to us about how his ginger soda was so special with natural ingredients.

Get there early for lunch or prepare to stand in line.  Hope that they don't sell out of your favorite items before you get to the register.  Fridays are especially busy so plan accordingly.

My only downgrade is the not-so-scenic office location.  Put Baguette Cafe alongside the Seine or in a more bucolic setting and this place is a lunch place
10.

I use any excuse to eat out for lunch at Baguette Cafe. The service is always personable as they're not in a rush to make people decide on what they want. 

A fresh menu of daily soups (today was carrot & sweet potato. SOOOO good! My daughter nearly licked the bowl), sandwiches, and salads. My go-to order is the prosciutto salad with an eggplant sandwich with prosciutto. The salad is AMAZING. Fresh mozzarella, pesto, greens, tomatoes, and a creamy vinaigrette that automatically comes on the side without asking. And then the toasted sandwich on their beautiful freshly baked bread with pretty much the same ingredients of the salad + eggplant. I've also tried the curry chicken which is very flavorful, but IMO, doesn't top the eggplant sandwich. 

Lastly, do not forget dessert. Yes, you can get a chocolate twist as a dessert, but my kids call that an appetizer. For dessert, do NOT skip the chocolate tart! This isn't typically what I'd order but my friend asked if I wanted to share and I would NEVER turn down trying new menu items. So, we ate this, and forks were scraped across the plate until there was no more chocolate mousse left over and every tart crumb was gone. This thing melts in your mouth like the lightest, most beautiful, airy chocolate. i'll probably be back on Monday to get another slice.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,3,3,5,_iJeWjf68Owf1CPAWvAVCg

He explained what specials he had for the day, what soups were available, and what are some of the popular items.

I ordered the half soup, half sandwich combo. One of the soups of the day was Potato Leek. It was perfect for the chilly weather. Soup came out pippin hot! I loved it. The sandwich was good but nothing special. I've honestly had better sandwiches at Panera Bread. My meal cost me about $7 and some change. Pretty typical for soup and sandwich combo (just like Panera) but the portions were more on the small side. It BARELY got me full and I normally have a small appetite. So I can't imagine a grown man getting full off of this. Maybe if you order two entrees then yeah.... I really don't get what's the hype about this place. It's simply A-Ok.

When my mom and I arrived they were not busy at all. We ordered two lattes, two sandwiches, soup and a slice of quiche Lorriane. A few minutes later they had a semi-large group come in and the waiting began.

After about 15 minutes brought us our quiche and soup. The quiche was sort of lukewarm, had far too many onions and the crust was tough. After another 15 minutes of wondering where the rest of our food was they brought the sandwiches. I do not believe they served me the right one, but by now I was a bit resigned. My mom told me the shrimp bisque she ordered was okay but that she did not like the curry flavor it had ... by now we are 3/4 done with our meal and the coffee is no where in evidence. I went back up to counter and politely inquired about it. The young lady blinked at me then the ""oh no"" face appeared. She said she would get that to us next. About 15 minutes later we are done with our food and finally the coffee arrives. We are ready to leave, so I have to walk back up to the counter and a finally get a young man to give us take out cups.

Since this place is far away from both my work and home it would have to be a special trip if I were to go back. I may have to try it again but it is not on the top of my list with all the other choices out there.",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,4,2,3,RLn_wRgie7y1TpOkQuJ4cA

I believe his mother is the one in the back doing the cooking and baking.  She has served us as well, and is super friendly.

The food is excellent and very fresh.  We have never had anything here that we didn't like - in fact, everything from the croissants, to quiche to sandwiches rival those in the tastiest bistros we have been to in Europe.  They must import their butter or something.  I have no idea how the quiche can be that fluffy and the crust can be that flaky.

they prepare all sandwiches and salad when you order so it takes a good 20mns sometimes...
Still LOVE that place. it's located between 215 and Buffalo/Durango
they have a very lovely outdoor seating with big olive trees which remind me of south of france.
Inside seating is small. when it's rush hour it's kind of crowded between the table, the counter and the people waiting so pick a table near the wall or glass window if you don't want to be surrounded.
it's family owned :) Olivier is the owner and his mom does all the amazing tarts and quiches.
great family affair!
i always order our birthday tarts there (order them in advance)
the only negative thing is the wait.
their sandwiches and paninis are delicious! love their curry sandwich, eggplant and mozzarella sandwich? the ham and cheese, mannnn i think i can order the whole menu board lol
the sandwich bread is so so good. 
their salads are fresh and healthy, dressing is miam miam 
veggies quiche, quiche lorraine, slice is nice and big when you eat there it comes with a side salad.
pastries chocolate croissant,croissant, chocolate twister are baked daily
now ready for the tarts?? and orange blossom cheesecake?? you cannot skip the tarts, they are so so good like home made good!
it remind me of my childhood when my mom used to prepare them! 
on Sundays we sometime come and get breakfast in their outdoor patio. it's nice and calm

I was hoping for fresh eggs but it was kind of omelette style. I got the chicken apple blue cheese baguette and while the concept was great, the blue cheese was extremely overpowering. I got a tuna sandwich and they literally throw a huge tomato slice and half an egg on each half of the sandwich.

2851844,2011-09-23,5,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"Just like the greatest gifts, this was a review I was hesitant to share with others since a part of me wanted to keep it for myself!  Having read all the stellar reviews, I had to see for myself if this was truly the cat's pajamas.  I currently live in Henderson and given that I usually have to go into the office at 8AM, I got up an extra half hour early just so I could make the trek across town to check out this oasis of French bakery nirvana hidden within a sterile collection of office buildings.  

Upon walking in, I was momentarily levitated by the smells of fresh baked croissants and Illy coffee much like those 80s cartoons where the streams of smoke coming from a pie or turkey physically grabbed one's nose and dragged them over to the prize.  The folks working behind the counter include a charming young Frenchman appropriately named Olivier along with his mother, a retired pastry chef in France brought out of retirement to help his son run the business over the past few years.  My primary objective was to sample the pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant) but I found out from Olivier that they typically are not ready until about 830 since they require a different temperature to bake in their limited ovens.  That kind of attention to detail sold me to the fact that these were true artisans (In the words of Ron Burgundy to Baxter upon finding out he pooped in the refrigerator....""Heck, I'm not even mad....that's amazing!) 

I happily opted instead to sample their regular croissant combined with spinach, egg, swiss cheese, sundried tomato pesto, and black forest ham accompanied by a regular cup of Illy coffee (although the Almond roca mocha will be tops on my list for my return visit).  Having had memorable croissants made by bakers trained in France in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco, I must say this one holds up.   Irresistibly flaky, one should best lean forward when biting into this paragon of buttery perfection at the risk of scattering croissant confetti all over one's clothes.  Throw in a rich dark brew of Illy coffee and pleasant conversation with Olivier (I found out he will occasionally brew his own hemp milk for the customers, which apparently has all sorts of health benefits and is very delicious.....how unbelievably cool is that?), and you're well on your way to starting your day on a an impossible high.  I am literally contemplating moving to the SW part of town just so that this place can be a regular morning pit stop en route to work...crazy, right?

It is located in a very odd place but once you get over that fact, you actually notice how it's actually in a perfect place. It's isolated and very mellow.

I came on my lunch break after all the great reviews I saw, I just had to try it. The lady who took my order was very helpful. She even let me taste the soups of the day because I couldn't decide which one to order. I went with the half Mushroom soup and half Chicken Chipotle grilled sandwich. 

You can tell that the soup was just made and wasn't sitting around all morning. It wasn't too creamy and had good bold flavors. I am NOT a mushroom lover but this soup was really good. The sandwich was amazing. It is a pretty small half sandwich but it was a perfect size for me. But I think most of you should order a full sandwich. The bread was made from scratch. The ingredients tasted fresh. I also got a iced green tea which I really liked. 

The owner, Olivier, was great! I went to talk to him about getting a menu to take with me but unfortunately he doesn't have any yet. He did grab my e-mail and he sent me a copy of the menu. When costumers would walk in he would automatically address them by their name. Now that's good customer service and it shows that he has regulars that come in for his amazing food. He even let me know that he uses all organic foods and meats are processed clean with no hormones. He said he really cares about what goes into the food, which I really appreciate.

Seriously, stepping into this casual coffee shop/cafe is like stepping into a friend's welcoming kitchen. Provided of course that you have friends who know how to seriously handle themselves in a kitchen.

Misti Y brought me here for a quick lunch and some work time. Free wi-fi is always a plus and Baguette Cafe provides that. But, they also provide a nice, simple meal as well. I tried a combination of the veggie soup and a crunch salad. Each portion was half sized which meant they were perfect together to provide a whole meal.

The soup was a cream instead of what I expected (I expected more of a broth with whole vegetables cooled in there), but it was a fantastic flavor. The crunch salad was simple and simply delightful - chock full of jicama, carrots, and other such crunchy veggies.

The prices were more than reasonable and if I'm not mistaken you can get a baked good made fresh that day to round out your meal. One note - this is strictly a morning and afternoon spot as I'm fairly certain they close at 5 pm on the weekdays and aren't open on weekends at all.",ACUVZ4SiN0gni7dzVDm9EQ,8,13,5,cO7AmNxMvjjyHH-rb6brfQ

Let me tell you the wonderful treats I had.....first off I ordered a curry chicken sandwich with a cup of their vegitable soup. oh my....so much flavor! My two year old devoured that soup! I bought a chocolate crossant and a peach tart for a small treat to share with the family. Big mistake...I really didn't want to share after I tasted the tart ;-) next time I will just buy everyone their own cause sharing really isn't even a option...it's plenty big enough to share but you really don't want too. Their coffee is yummers too! They have my favorite brand illy coffee :-) 

Another plus for this place is the owner/server, Olivier :-) If I wasn't a married mama I would probably be his biggest groupie. He takes the time to ask your name and he actually uses it! Not just by calling out my name when the order is ready but actually talking to me. I felt like I was a regular to his cafe yet this was my first visit....I love that feeling!

Olivier and his staff produce some of the most delicious, yet simple, food you can get in Las Vegas. They do what they do well. I've been frequently ordering the blue brie sandwich with chicken, and my husband prefers the curry chicken sandwich. When you get it to go, it doesn't come with the light salad you get when you dine in, but the sandwich stays crispy and warm due to how they wrap it. Today I felt very sick and my husband picked me up their vegetable medley soup, which really gave me a much needed pick me up. Of course, if it's available, I cannot walk away from here without getting their fruit or chocolate tarts. Their chocolate twist is a great alternative if you're just looking for a pastry as well.

Given the locale and demographics, they're only open mornings and early afternoon until 3 pm. On the bright side, they're open on weekends too, for those in Vegas for weekend trips.

I love pesto, so when I saw the pesto grilled sandwich listed, I knew I had to order it. You get your choice of chicken and bacon or eggplant. Of course, I picked chicken and bacon. The sandwich is so good - my favorite part was the bread. Haha. 

The croissants had been freshly baked, so I also got the croissant and egg with turkey. The croissant itself was flaky and buttery. Definitely my favorite part of this item. Both the croissant and egg and the grilled sandwich came with a side of salad.

BF ordered the drip coffee. For 16 oz., it came in this huge mug, with separate containers to add cream and sugar to taste. A nice complement to our sandwiches.

There's indoor and outdoor patio seating. We opted outside because indoors was a bit warm (from the baking and cooking, maybe?), but outside had its challenges as well because the wind picked up and wrestled with our loose napkins and paper. Other than the blustery breeze, the outdoor patio seating would've been great during a normal sunny day.

The food experience so far would've been 5 stars, but we also got some pastries to go since the food was so good. We ordered two fresh croissants, a chocolate croissant, and the chocolate twist. I read rave reviews for the chocolate twist so I was excited to see it in stock. We took it to go to later enjoy in the hotel room. While the croissant was fresh and delicious, the chocolate croissant was okay, and the chocolate twist was the disappointing one of all. It must have been sitting in the display case for a reason because there was white stringy things on the chocolate part of the twist. I thought it was crystallized sugar but it wasn't. Ended up tossing the twist in the trash since it wasn't salvagable. =/

There are a variety of salads, breakfasts, soups, fresh pastries, and sandwiches offered. On a first try, you must have a soup and a sandwich. 

The soups change daily and are always delicious. Consider yourself lucky if you come on a day when the spinach or butternut squash velouté is offered; they are some of the best soups I have ever had.

There are a variety of cold and hot-pressed sandwiches, but hot-pressed is the way to go. The bread is exquisitely toasted and extremely fresh. All the sandwiches are offered with a choice of meat or vegetarian and there are also tasty vegan options. 

Coupled with the fresh food, the pastries are absolutely amazing. I've tried the chocolate twists and the mixed berry tart; they both nearly made me drool all over the table. 

If you are in a rush, make sure to call your order in ahead of time. Olivier recently told me they are implementing an online order system which should make things even easier.

Nothing special there either. BUT their salad dressing, or whatever that supposed to be, was just disgusting. I have no idea what it tasted like except for bad taste.

But none of us ordered a panini and she didn't notified any of us, we waited for 25 minutes for the sandwiches. Remember, it was just a normal sandwich w/ nothing special at all. 
Then my salad didn't come with the sandwiches for which the server said she would bring it right out. I assumed it was just too much for her to bring at the same time. So I waited... a few minutes later, my salad was still not there. So I went in and follow up. And this is our conversation...

Me: Hi, I would like to follow on my salad. It was taking a bit long. 
Server:  I said I will bring it right out!

um... excuse me... Last time I checked, you said the same thing 5 minutes ago! 

Seriously, how hard is it to just put some greens together and the meat on top? 30 minutes in total? For just an average salad? Not worth it at all. My co-workers and I both agree not to go back EVER AGAIN!

We are from SoCal, this place only qualify for an average meal but not worth the wait.

Also, we had to sit outside because it was way too hot inside. The owner is SMART enough to the oven in the room but not the kitchen...

BTW, just a little tips here... If you come here on a windy day and planning to have a salad. I would suggest you not to sit outside or your salad will be flying all over the place. It's not even funny, it's real.",OYlVkEt1KAsMs_9qT42-mQ,3,1,1,bxs2oqhQGu6CETiTaK0Ypg

As I started to say no, the lovely cashier started explaining all of my options and what they are about. She told me how everything was made fresh daily and they are known for their quiche. There was only once slice left so I ordered it. Along with a crispy green salad and a cup of onion soup with curry. When I asked which soup was better the owner brought me a taste of both. I also ordered a cappuccino since in a review someone mentioned it was the best they ever had. I told them I read that, and it was like the pressure was on. However that made no difference, it was indeed one of the best cappuccinos i have ever tasted in life ever. The foam was perfect and the person who made my drink clearly knew a thing or 2 about espresso by the way she pulled my shot. My boyfriend ordered a turkey sandwich that he said he would order again in a heartbeat. They double checked to make sure we liked everything. It was just exactly what I expect from a place I want to give 5 stars to. Nothing was wrong whatsoever from the service, to the cleanliness, to the food and its quality.

There are few words to really grasp how great this place is. Sublime. It is sublime. Baguette Cafe is the definition of 5 stars. It is the pinnacle of what such a place should be. I went in hoping for a decent cup of coffee and my expectations were happily surpassed. 

For breakfast, I had the traditional quiche lorraine and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was superb. To add sugar or anything else to it would be a crime. The quiche was a fantastic balance of flavor with a crisp, light crust on the bottom. My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich, tea, and juice. His only issue was wishing the size of his tea was switched with the size of his juice. The tea was tropical green tea and it was very tasty as well.

For lunch, I had the Jerusalem artichoke soup, a blueberry muffin, and another cappuccino. My feelings on the cappuccino are clear. The soup was up to par with the rest of the food I had experienced. The soup was satiny and fresh. A spoonful delicately coated my mouth with a creamy deliciousness. The muffin was tender and sweet while not crumbly or overpowering. There was no shortage of blueberries either which is often a problem I experience with muffins. The cup of soup, muffin, and drink proved to be quite a satisfying lunch.

I haven't even gotten to Olivier. He's the proprietor of the establishment and greets every customer with a warm, sincerity that I wish was seen at every business. During breakfast, he knew the name and order of every customer who came in. He was attentive without being intrusive and it's clear he takes great pride in every detail of his business.

At lunch, every single person sitting around me and those who walked in said it was one of, if not THE most fantastic place they had ever eaten. One gentleman said it was the best food in Vegas and I might be inclined to agree. You won't run across this place on the street though. It's at the back of a business complex, but it is worth the trip from wherever you live. The only bummer, they are only open 7-5, M-F. I did overhear Olivier saying they might try a Saturday if they get a solid enough business outside the employees of the surrounding buildings.

This is not a fast food place even though you get your food pretty fast. It's as though it exists outside regular time. When I eat there, I savor every bite and it reminds me to take time out for myself to appreciate the world around me. Seriously, this place is amazing. GO.

The best part about finding this cafe is the fact that their entire menu is genuinely delicious!  I am in love with this place!

Situated in the corner of the Centra business complex, Baguette is a treasure worth searching for on Sunset and the 215. If it wasn't for my new job down in the area, I would have lived the rest of my life oblivious to true French pastries and the genius of the owner's parents and their fantastic from-scratch cuisine. The first time I walked in the smell of fresh croissants wafted in the air. They import the dough from France and bake it fresh daily. It has the right pull, the beautiful flaky exterior and a flavor like no other croissant I've ever had. From there I began ordering sandwiches and literally worked my way through the menu. Every single one is flavorful and down right delicious. I'm hooked. The best part? They make my chai tea better than Starbucks. Yum!

If you want a place to eat where you don't have to avoid parts of the menu, or are looking for a family run cafe that makes sandwiches and pastries from scratch, venture down southwest and eat here. It's worth the trip. I eat here every single day and will never tire of their great food. It's simple-sandwiches, soups, salads, and a variety of pastries and quiche daily, along with Illy coffee and variety of lattes and teas--you cannot go wrong. Olivier, the owner, is amazing and will take care of you. His parents cook in the back and are AMAZING at what they do.

I would give this restaurant a 3 normally for the nice patio setting and the food being okay, but their customer service just angered me. 

We ordered a special juice they had made thinking it would be delicious. It was Watermelon lemonade. Unfortunately when we sat down we tried it and it did not taste very good at all, so we politely asked if we could exchange it for anything, even something much cheaper. They said no. 

We started eating our sandwiches and still did not get our soup till 7 minutes later and our latte 12 minutes later. 

We also noticed there was no chicken in the chicken sandwich. We went in and when they saw us they asked ""WHATS WRONG NOW?"" We asked if the chicken sandwich had chicken in it and they took it and brought back the same sandwich with a few bites out of it just now with some chicken.  

When they finally brought out our latte they also brought out two pastries and apologized, but unfortunately the damage was done. 

Presentation is lackluster. One redeeming quality is their carrot soup that we had the first time and their vanilla latte.

The bread is fresh and soft but with that perfect chewy texture. The chicken was moist and tender.

I am sad that I waited to long to try them.  We had been out on a hike and came here after for breakfast.

We decided to share a Quiche Lorraine with a side salad.  We got the Watermelon Lemonade for our drink.  
  The Watermelon Lemonade was really good.  The Watermelon was the stand out flavor with the lemon flavor being in the background.  Honestly I normally wouldn't have chosen a drink like this but wow was I impressed!  Our order come out pretty quick and we were in for a treat.  The baguettes for both of our sandwiches were so good.  Good bread is so hard to come by and this was a welcome treat.   Of course both sandwiches were delicious.  The omelet was perfect size and fluffy.  Perfectly cooked and really hit the spot.  The Chicken Curry sandwich was really good too.  The curry was spot on.  It added to the flavor but was not overpowering.   
   The Quiche Lorraine was amazing.  Light and fluffy and so tasty. Many places over cook their quiche but not here - perfection is the way they roll!  The salad was made delicious with the tasty dressing of which I was a could get a bottle of to take home!

The granola they use on top has pepitas in it as well as flax seeds and other crispy delicious goodness. The parfaits are different every time. Sometimes it'll have sliced grapes and strawberries, other times I've gotten banana and watermelon! It's always phenomenal. 
For lunch they always have new soups every day, they're always spectacular. Their cream of asparagus soup and gazpacho is my favorite. 
I've had a few of their salads and my favorite by far is their Greek. Is a huge salad with black olives, cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta and the Greek dressing is bomb. It also comes with soft, warm pita slices and home made hummus! It's seriously amazing.

In some ways there's little praise that hasn't been heaped on the culinary wonders that lie in this hidden gem at the back of a business plaza off Sunset road just north of the 215 beltway.

My wife well knows my aversion to sandwiches for the evening meal, but the ""chipotle"" baguette gets a special pass into my tummy at every opportunity. The quality of everything - the chicken, the bread, the aioli could be straight out of a Michelin star restaurant and here you have a solidly sized, artisan sandwich available for little more than the uninspiring fare served up by Subway or Port of Subs.

On top of the sandwiches, of which there is a small but exciting selection, there's usually one or two intriguing (and always incredible) soups of the day, and a selection of cookies, pies, tarts, and quiches which mean that even at the thoroughly reasonable prices, I end up racking up quite a bill - but it's money I am glad to pay to fill my fridge with such delightful goodies.

The thing that prompted this extremely belated praise of Baguette Cafe was an article in Las Vegas Weekly about ""50 Must Eat Meals in Las Vegas"". As far as I'm concerned - no trip to Vegas is complete without one of Olivier's baguette creations, perhaps complimented with a generous slice of chocolate tart and washed down with artisan ginger ale.

You know the jittery feeling when you first step into an unfamiliar place and try to figure out how and what to order? You won't find it here. The owner was quick to diagnosed us as newbies and gave us warm smiles and explained the whole menu to us. When he was done, we wanted to get everything on the menu because they all sound amazing! Then, he was kind enough to offer us samples of his two daily soups while we were deciding what to get. And then, of course, we wanted to get the Shrimp Bisque too (simply heavenly)!

Since we went for tea, we ended up only getting a chocolate torte, lemon torte, croissant, thai chai, hot chocolate and white mocha. Please, please do get the tortes. The chocolate one was rich but with a fine balance of cocoa and sweetness. The lemon one was a fantastic explosion of citrus loveliness. I also liked the croissant, tasted just like France's very own.

A relaxed vibe, great food and friendly customer service. What else can you want?

Recommendations are:
The Moroccan Sandwich
Croissant
Fenancier (I think that's how it's spelled - they're pretty much almond honey cakes)

He then went on to question my ability to differentiate excellent food from crap - I believe his analogy implied that I could not recognize a diet pepsi from a cab sav.  Sorry Oivier - I'm not a ""frustrated want to be foodie"" as you wrote, or the jealous competition.  I don't claim to be a foodie, nor do I aspire to be one.  I'm a simple guy - who enjoys nice things, good food, atmosphere, and company.  I've dined at a handful of Michelin rated restaurants, and enjoy the local hole-in-the-wall establishments around town.  I am not trying to diminish anyone's livelihood - as I understand the owner should take pride in his establishment.  But I also truly feel that Baguette Cafe does not deserve a 4-5 star review.  I went out of my way to try the food here simply because of the high rating - and I feel this was extremely deceiving.  Everyone's palate is different, but I think I have a pretty good gauge on what tastes good, and what doesn't.  Olivier - you don't have to convince everyone that walks in how great your food is by telling them pretentiously to their face -  let them decide on their own.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but it's WAAY off the beaten path for me, so I waited until I had to pick up my equally adventurous niece (hereinafter referred to as ""Rosebud"") from the airport, and we decided to search it out for a late lunch. (""Search"" is no exaggeration - thanks to whoever posted that handy little map!)

Once you find it, it's a pleasant little place with an absolute sweetheart (Olivier - the aforementioned Frenchman) behind the counter. Selections were on a chalkboard. I went with the curried chicken sandwich and zucchini parmesan soup. The bread was great, and the chicken was hot, juicy, and clearly freshly cooked. Rosebud went for the four-cheese special, and wound up having to scrape off some of the gorgonzola because it was too pungent. I had zero sympathy. People who order blue-veined cheeses get what they deserve.

Because dessert is mandatory, she went with a croissant stuffed with Nutella, which she would have preferred heated. (Mighty picky for a non-paying guest, don't you think?), and I had the last slice of chocolate tart, which I eyed nervously every time some potential interloper stepped anywhere near the display case. It was silky and rich, and it was mine.

Fellow Diet Coke addicts, be forewarned: Olivier fell victim to the silly internet urban legends about D.C. not being good for you, and stocks an alien brand of sugarless cola. The bottle was beautiful, and it didn't taste too bad, but it was not a reasonable substitute. I yam what I yam, and next time I'll bring my own.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,3,2,4,uftqecsaLo_hM2e7nmfEhg

The owner, Olivier, is fantastic. He is very friendly and makes sure to greet everyone warmly. He is extremely knowledgable about French cuisine and takes time to explain the menu to newcomers. 

Our only lament is the location. We wish it was closer to Green Valley! My wife and I (and our dogs) would come several times a week if it were closer to home!",BLNkQjlMr11fkLdbBX1wYg,1,0,5,JzSztUz-dLeO2l9QLkF5VA
3460505,2011-02-23,3,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"One of the best things about my job is that I get to work within yards of Baguette Cafe. I've grown to dearly love this place over the last year. The food is always good, the people are sweet and the ingredients are as quality as you can get. 

The food, bread, pies, muffins and coffee drinks are all made fresh, in house by Olivier, his mom and dad. All of whom are from France. This seems to also be the congregating spot of the local French population. It's not unusual to see groups of French-speaking people dressed beautifully sipping a huge cup of coffee and dipping croissants into their beverage on most mornings. 

I adore their soups. Everyday there are 2 soups. Both usually vegetarian. Creamy Cauliflower, Vegetarian French Onion, Curry, Spinach...the combinations Olivier's dad whips up are phenomenal. Easily, the best soups I've ever had. The sandwiches are made on store-baked baguette and served with the freshest and crispest ingredients. Olivier's dad is such a sweetheart...sometimes I come in and ask for pasta and he creates a dish just for me. 

Another dish that I think is marvelous is their pizza. Sometimes they have leek, sometimes roasted tomatoes and mushrooms...whatever they create, it's always sensational. The crust is thicker and definitely buttery and the toppings baked to perfection. Remarkable. 

Baguette Cafe's pastries and coffee are another pairing to treasure. The Caramel Macchiato is easily the tastiest and most satisfying morning drink I've had. Paired with their delectable fresh-baked croissants, breakfast is a heavenly experience. The dessert selection varies daily. Today they had chocolate tart and lemon meringue pie. Both made lovingly by Olivier's mommy. The meringue pie was perfection. Sweet, refreshing, smooth and made with actual lemon pieces, this clearly put all desserts to shame. They bake Madeleines in-house daily and have muffins and Pan de Chocolate (also immaculately baked fresh by the mom). 

Pricing here is very very very reasonable. $6-$7 for a half and half combination lunch and $3-$4 for a healthy piece of dessert. 

A place as delectable as Baguette Cafe is not going to be a local hidden gem for much longer. I've seen it's popularity soar over the year and I know they are going to go places (as they should). Partake in the joy of this cafe before it goes viral!",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,7,3,5,uEh1rQixRnt_YbdDTuWIjg

Fresh, natural and quality ingredients! Service with a smile and just overall, tres magnifique!  Olivier was there and has a gift of excellent customer service! Charming and charismatic are the best ways to describe the people who work here! I have to say that with 100% honesty this place is the best french food that money can buy in this town! 

The last time I remember eating food this fresh, I was sitting on the steps of a17th century church, eating a picnic of local meats, cheve and ripe tomatoes we bought off the streets in the market of Apt, France.  The only thing missing was the sweet provencal sun and a bottle of wine! 

I highly recommend a half sandwich and soup/salad combo! Its perfect portions and sensible value will allow you to indulge on a heavenly patisserie and espresso to boot! Please give the specials a try, you won't find them on the menu so remember to ask.  

I am in LOVE with the tomato, cucumber and basil gazpacho! I could eat a gallon of it but then I wouldn't have room for the goat cheese and moroccan chicken sandwich on a crisp baguette! Yum! Last but certainly not least, is my most treasured Pan Aux Raisin! I search high and low for this coveted patisserie that is not only rare to find in its authenticity but in its simple and uncomplicated form.  Guess what? It's here at the Baguette Cafe and it's as good as I remember eating from the Patisseries on the streets of Paris. 

My only complaint, is that I live 23 min away (I actually timed it)! Also if you are on W. Sunset looking for the Cafe you have to find the cluster of office buildings and cut through those parking lots, go in the direction of 215 to find it.  Just watch your gps and you'll see.

3519453,2010-08-24,3,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I'll admit that I'm a softee when it comes to rating locally-owned businesses. I tend to round up. But, if any local small business deserves a high rating it's this place. I've seen the other 5 star Yelp reviews for Baguette Cafe and was really skeptical that a small place in an office park could be that good, but it is.

I've been there a few times in the last 2 weeks and the food I've tried ranged from good to excellent. What makes it so good are the fresh ingredients and the spreads and soups that are made from scratch. The prosciutto sandwich with mixed greens and walnuts had a home-made celery spread. I've had it twice and the first time it was very good, the second time the prosciutto was too thick and salty.

On another occasion I had the molé chicken sandwich which had a nice tangy and spicy spread. The two soups I've tasted, the carrot coconut soup and the onion soup, are both excellent. The three cheese panini is another delicious sandwich. It has gorgonzola, mozzarella, goat cheese, tomatoes, and basil and you can add chicken (which I did), turkey, or prosciutto to it. The chicken curry sandwich has a creamy yellow curry sauce with a little bit of heat. The key to any great sandwich is the bread and theirs is fabulous. A little thick and crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy inside. According to the owner the bread is baked daily from dough imported from France. 

Portion sizes aren't super-sized like most sandwich places these days. But, they are a size that I would consider to be normal and healthy. If you're in a hurry, this may not be the best place to go because it does take a while to get your order. Which I attribute to a more laid back European culture than the fast-food mentality that most Americans have. But, the food is worth it. You can tell it's meticulously and thoughtfully prepared. You can feel the care and love that the owner(s) put into this establishment. And, it doesn't just stop with the food. The feel of the cafe is like a clean, modern, Starbucks-esque interior (with less merchandise and flair). It's their attention to detail -- from ingredients to plating -- that make this place a hidden gem and the friendly staff make this a fantastic establishment. The only real negatives about this place are the difficult to find office park location and the fact that they're not open late or on weekends.

3520219,2013-10-25,19,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered ""The Prosciutto"" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich ""panini"" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. 

If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,26,23,3,MjzWnUcG0Nm1yrdCQ71WvQ

Did I win $1,000,000 in Vegas? No, but Baguette Cafe and my taste buds were the real winners.

Baguette Cafe is a little French café located 10 miles away from the Strip. Location was a bit difficult to find, but totally well worth it (hint: drive into the business park via Raphael Rivera Way).

Very friendly service. On a side note, one of the staff members misheard my order and accidentally gave me the wrong drink. Without realizing what was going on, I was somehow charged with extra amount of money. However, the staff recognized the mistake and gave me back the overcharged amount - so I really respect the staff's honesty here! 

Blue Brie (mustard spread, apple, walnuts, blue cheese brie, and the choice of mushrooms or chicken, $7.96): I got mushroom blue brie and this grilled sandwich was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Crispy crust and fresh ingredients - talk about delicious!

Quiche du Jour (bacon and swiss cheese quiche or vegetable quiche, $5.46): I got bacon quiche and I was really impressed! It was seasoned very well and texture was so fluffy. This is a must order!

Thank you Yelp for leading me to this incredible French café. On my next Vegas trip, I might even steal my friend's rental car just so that I can come back here again!

I think it's a combination of the owner's French appeal and the flaky, buttery goodness of the pastries.  It's undeniable... Baguette Café makes my heart flutter.

Everything they offer from the pastries to the soups made daily is made from fresh ingredients. You can just taste it. On my first visit, I had the prosciutto sandwich and cream of mushroom soup. I expected for the baguette to be hard and crunchy but that wasn't the case at all. I took a bite and it was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. On my next visit, I had the chipotle chicken panini and cream of potato and leek soup. Everything was divine. They are good lunch portions and affordable at around $6-$7. 

The service and ambiance is 5 stars all the way. You can tell that Olivier appreciates all of his patrons because he tries to get to know everyone by name. He takes the time to explain everything that is on the menu. He is so enthusiastic and passionate about the food that he makes everything sound irresistible. His French accent doesn't hurt either. True to his word, the food is every bit as delicious as he describes.

Unfortunately for me, they are only open Monday-Friday from 7 am to 5 pm. I have actually considered quitting my job so that I can get another job in the business complex where they are located.

 A chicken curry quiche - Taste like chicken curry.. yum yum

Eggplant, Prosciutto, tomato pesto and mozzarella Pannini - First off, let me tell you that I was only planning to have a bite of this since my molar isn't doing so well, as in a root canal procedure may be involved type of pain.

The Morrocan:  Again, fresh.  The chicken wasn't dry, and the sauce was just the right amount of flavorful.  It didn't overpower the rest of the sandwich.  The baguette was good, as was the side salad.

I dunno maybe it's the Frenchness maybe it was something else but that was one thing that bothered me I really didn't feel welcomed I felt like I was a bit of a burden being in their restaurant. Very unfortunate for such yummy food. I will certainly try it again due to the level of the food hopefully it'll be a better experience next time.,vOhlglILExP0wf6IA6WaZQ,0,0,3,n6cLsUyV2pPm2YzN5rLPpg

This place is 40 mins away from my house and I had high expectation before I visited it. It didn't disappoint me as soon as I walked in. It is a very cute little cafe. All the staffs work here are really friendly with smiles. I told the owner that I am kinda picky about the onion soup and like it less salty. He offered me a small cup so I could try it and see if I liked. It was very nice of him. He also told me chef never put beef stock in soup so it wouldn't taste too salty. After I tried the sample, I liked it a lot.
I ordered Prosciutto sandwich, onion soup,seasoned fresh veggie soup, crunchy green salad, Bleu and Brie sandwich and a pear crusted tart. I loved loved their cute presentations. Colorful little soup cups was a plus. Both onion soup and veggie soup were excellent especially the veggie one. I liked the prosciutto sandwich better than bleu and brie one. And the pear crusted tart was the bomb! I was really fulled after eating my sandwich and soup. However I still wanted to tried their deserts since  this place was far from my area. I wasn't sure when I could taste their food again. After my first bite of pear crusted tart, my tummy immediately reserved space for it lol. Owner told me chef put real almonds into the crust, and that was why tart tasted really fresh and tasty. Pear fruits melted in your mouth once you put it in. The only thing I regretted that day was not getting another pear crusted tart to go ugh...  next time I am gonna try their chocolate tart!",VzBoi7n5pee-iLx5dc5BHA,2,1,4,aZVInE8lwv6prmgwHJL0Fg

PROS:

* Their food is definitely fresh (you see them making it right in front of you)
* They have a good selection of food
* Prices are reasonable
* They have outdoor seating
* Food is delicious
* Owner is onsite & is really friendly


CONS:

* Since they're very popular, sometimes they run out of things (i.e: quiche, chocolate tarte)

* They get busy right at noon, so sometimes the line would be out the door & tables would be full

The cons actually show how successful their business is & how good they are.. so technical, they're not really cons =)

The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.

After a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.

Anyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!

The Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.

Overall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.

We went for the egg croissants and added some bacon which were delicious! A little side salad was also a nice touch. The only reason I'd drop a star is that the outside tables weren't maintained and there were other people's leftovers on many of the tables. We had to move someone else's dirty dishes in order to take a seat. It was a busy lunchtime and everyone was busy, so I'd definitely give this place another try but it might be worth staffing someone else at the busy moments so the guests don't have to do the tidying up.",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,1,0,4,9NFD7U-f-vi_LHLYaBSNIQ

However, by all means avoid the lunch hour rush! I came in a few minutes before noon and luckily there was only 1 person ahead of me. But a minute after, practically every office employee within a 1 mile radius was here! Not only physically, but also calling in their orders for them to pick up (smart decision).

As I was waiting in line and looking over the menu. I noticed Olivier was holding his phone with his gloves on. And from what I saw he touched some food immediately after. 

The first thing I put in my mouth was greens from the side salad that came with the sandwich. Unfortunately the greens were wilted, which was already a turn off.  

I ordered the tuna panini which was a pretty standard panini. The only thing is it wasn't left on the panini press long enough because the lines from the grill were really faint. I think since they were in a rush to get the food in and out of the kitchin quick, it wasn't left on the press long enough. And I really do like that toasty taste. 

I was more pleased with my other selections such as the shrimp bisque and the banana nut muffin.

Shrimp Bisque- very tasty, I've ordered lobster bisque at a classy restaurant and this was just as good. The 2 pieces of toasted baguette was a really nice touch.

Banana nut muffin- really moist and I enjoy the fact there's no cinammon.

I tried the cold brew, and I personally found it to be bitter. I added a ton of cream and even tossed a sugar in to try and balance it out. The watermelon lemonade was delicious though. 

We sat outside on the patio. Every table was covered with dirty dishes and they were napkins blowing around because it was a windy day. The dirty tables remained as they were the entire time we ate. The table we sat at had been wiped off so we wiped it ourselves. Definitely not a great site to see when trying a new restaurant.

-Not a fan of the Curry Grilled Sandwich, for me it felt odd putting curry in a sandwich form.

I have been frequenting Olivier, Shelby and the gang for quite sometime now and all I have to say is Thank God for Baguette Cafe. 

I love everything about this place. Upon entry into this unassuming cafe, you are greeted with a smile and the delightful smell of fresh baked breads and pastries. I love the purity and love that goes into the food here. It really is unlike any other cafe in the Las Vegas area. The staff is very enthusiastic about what they serve and it shows. Olivier will take the time, despite a line out the door at lunch time, to describe in detail the daily specials of soups, sandwiches and pastries. 

I have been here too many times to count. With the free wireless, I often find myself setting up shop and spending the morning or afternoon catching up on graduate school or just chatting with friends. 

Some of my favorite daily specials served: Chicken curry sandwich, shrimp bisque, french peasant stew, Moroccan chicken sandwich, gazpacho, spinach and cheese quiche, pear tart.....OK now I'm making myself hungry again.

They have a wide range of beverages and serve Illy coffee! 
Some of my favorite drinks: Thai iced tea, green tea iced tea, CHAI SO AMAZING. 

Warning: It becomes very busy at lunch time and also is not open on the weekends. Also sometimes food takes a bit due to the nature of the care that goes into the sandwiches they prepare. I really dislike the reviews of this place stating the service is slow or that it took too long to get their sandwich.

3973288,2014-11-08,7,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I stopped at Baguette Cafe two years ago on a Saturday to find out they were closed on weekends.  With much of their business coming from the office buildings where, they're located, that's probably a goof idea because even though it's along the freeway, it's off the beaten path.

There was no line and I ordered a Moroccan sandwich with chicken, one of their grilled sandwich options.  This sandwich can also be made with eggplant for a vegetarian option.  With it, I ordered an iced black tea.

I sat at a high top table on the side so I could watch the people do their work at the grill and espresso machine.

In a short time, my sandwich and tea were on my table.  The sandwich came with some mixed greens with a little dressing.  The Moroccan is made with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and is topped with a North African spiced aioli.  The sandwich was quite good and the mixed greens were a perfect amount for a lunch portion with sandwich.  I really liked the North African spiced aioli.  It gave the sandwich a very good flavor.

The cafe has a nice area for outdoor eating between the two buildings or in front where it's shaded.  It looked very pleasant but the morning was still cool m so I stayed indoors.

I would have tried a pastry but there wasn't much of a selection left.  It looked like the pastry people had come through and bought everything in sight.

I do like this place but it really is inconvenient to get to from where I live.  It's a good option if you're in the area.  If you're coming west on the 215, I'd exit at Buffalo and take the frontage road from there to the business park.

I was originally just have a croissant and espresso, but it soon turned into a buttery croissant filled with scrumptious fluffy scramble eggs, Swiss cheese, Black Forest Ham, and with garlic infused mild tomato spread served with a side salad for around $7. 

The croissant was absolutely heavenly with its flaky exterior and buttery moist center. It came with a filling amount of ham, and the eggs were very well prepared with a soft  fluffiness and spot on seasoning. The Swiss cheese was nicely melted and the tomato spread was just right. Its flavor let you know it was there, but did not overwhelm the croissant breakfast sandwich. A great way to start the day indeed.

The side salad was fresh, crisp, and light dressed with a tasty balsamic creamy dressing. The espresso was very smooth but with a rich robust after taste. Best of all, my meal with the coffee was all for under $10. Also service was outstanding and very friendly.

I went today for lunch (5/22/13) on the late side (about 4pm) and had the four-cheese and prosciutto panini. It comes with a really generous helping of fresh mozzarella, basil, and a tasty and tangy homemade tomato spread. They recently switched from ciabatta to baguette (apparently they hired an advisor before opening the restaurant who told them that Americans prefer softer breads to crunchy baguettes...that advisor was WRONG!). The new bread is amazing - very crunchy but soft on the inside, and even better when grilled in the panini press.

I also tried the artichoke soup (splendid) and a croissant (buttery and soft inside, flaky outside...perfect!). Every single thing I have ever tried on the menu has been delicious. They also make great smoothies and though I am not a coffee drinker, I am told their coffee is fantastic as well.

Lesson learned from a previous visit, we called ahead to check on the availability of chocolate croissants.  We were informed they would be ready in 30 minutes - somewhere between 9 - 9:30.

We arrived and were greeted very pleasantly by Olivier and his mother Claudine.  They introduced themselves, asked our names, asked if we had visited before and so on.  It was a very polite and personable experience.  

After ordering, Olivier suggested we dine al fresco under the olive tree.  So, we did just that.  We set up shop in the shade, put our feet up, and read.  Approximately 20 minutes later we received our quiche, chocolate croissant, cappucino, and frappe.  Everything was delightlful.  The croissant was just as we had hoped...buttery, airy, flaky and scrumptious.

I met Christie O. for lunch recently, at 11 am there was ample seating to choose from but within the hour, every seat inside was taken and there were even some patrons seated outside. 

Baguette Cafe is owned by an amazingly friendly and highly skilled chef named Olivier. He was in back when we arrived, but we received very friendly service from the sweet employee manning the counter... and Olivier came out a little later to say hello and ensure everything was to our liking. What a charmer that man is!

Baguette Cafe is serving up BIG time taste at really inexpensive prices... My lunch was a half a sandwich (tuna salad), a cup of soup (cream of sweet potato) and a large iced tea, and it cost under $10! The soup was lick-the-cup delicious and the baguette that the sandwich came on was perfectly chewy without being hard. The portions are not huge, but for me it was the perfect amount of food. 

While I am not vegan, it is always nice to see places that care enough to offer up vegan selections for those that are. Most menu items can be altered to accommodate different dietary requests. 

I definitely look forward to another lunch at Baguette Cafe, and I think the next time I go in, I will have to try some of the baked desserts Christie and others have raved about!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,8,4,4,RIwqfnUMXvIyOJbE-czwrw

But once you find them, you're in for a treat. Their sandwiches and soups will leave you wanting more. Fresh, clean, and made to order...Baguette Cafe is not only good for their sandwiches, their soups are also a fan to many.

I had their Egg Baguette Panini.  I had mine with the eggs, turkey, spinach, mushrooms, and their tomato basil sauce.  This panini comes with Swiss cheese, but opted to have it taken out.  At first bite, I thought that the bread was the highlight.  Their breads are freshly made in front of you if you're lucky like me, then you get to the substance, which is the turkey and egg.  My goodness...I loved my meal.  I chased my panini with a cup of their chowder.  This was so good too.  Dining inside looks to be a little tough during lunch time since the restaurant is small and the outside seating is minimal.  Plus, seems like everyone else is a fan because there's a line out the door. But don't fret...the line goes by quick and your meal is served in a decent amount of time.

4108191,2016-06-13,5,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I somehow managed not to try this place for years despite all the allure and mystique. After an idle Sunday morning, I decided to rectify this issue.

Baguette Cafe is a local breakfast/lunch spot with light French fare. Not only have many of my Yelp friends raved about it, but it has made the national Yelp Top 100 list three years running. I knew that I had to see what the fuss was all about sooner or later, and today I finally went.

The cafe is simple and inviting enough, and it has plenty of seating both inside and outside. The employee at the register (not Olivier, I believe) was friendly and patiently answered all my questions about the still-available pastries (about half the case was empty at the relatively late hour that I went), sandwich breads (baguette and croissant), and quiche. I wanted to try everything, but I decide to limit myself just a bit.

Chocolate Twist ($2.80): my first taste of their flaky and moist croissant dough with vanilla cream and semisweet chocolate. It really does not lack for chocolate. I didn't want to stop munching on this treat, and I was almost considering ordering another one or two.

Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Cookie ($2.45): yep, it's a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips. It's crunchy enough on the outside and moist and chewy inside. I definitely could've used more chocolate chips and perhaps some peanut butter chips too, especially considering all the flavor I got in the Chocolate Twist. This is a great cookie, but maybe it's just not a match for my personal preference.

Large Caramel Latte Frappe ($4.89): at first, it definitely hit the spot for a kick of caffeine and sugar. I should've stuck to something simpler because I was getting sugar from pastries, and the sweetness wore thin as my day went on.

Vegetable Quiche ($6.00): my first, second, and third impression was that it was undercooked. The quiche was kinda runny and the crust was only a bit flaky golden brown. It seemed slightly underseasoned too, and the flavor wasn't that potent overall - unless I misremembered, goat cheese was mentioned but didn't tickle my palate at all. It was a hefty slice, but there wasn't that much to it otherwise. I don't know if this is the standard here or a fluke, but I have had better quiches at other local cafes. [P.S. The leftovers were much better after a short stint in the oven.]

Blue Brie Sandwich ($7.95) with chicken: got a taste of their baguette through this. Great crunch (as this is a grilled sandwich) and nice chew throughout this bread. I wasn't getting the blue and Brie cheeses to begin with, but they came through when I started on my leftover portion. The white-meat chicken was satisfying in texture and seasoned well, although it's modestly portioned if you ask me. The side salad (with a few bruised leaves) and the dressing were unimpressive though.

Prosciutto Sandwich ($8.25): I got it on a croissant and had it wrapped to go (no side salad here, phew), but I took a few bites anyway before I left. This is actually mainly both prosciutto and salami. Those meats pack a punch, and the copious amount of greens and tomato are on the edge of neutralizing the saltiness (which side of the fence you fall on may depend on palate and other factors). The croissant was flaky and buttery as I expected, but it really shined with a quick toast when I dove into my leftovers at home. Maybe they'll entertain a request at the cafe to toast the croissant before adding the more delicate ingredients?

The best part of Baguette Cafe is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the bread. Everything else wasn't quite top-caliber. It's a solid neighborhood cafe, and I can see why people are fans, but I'd only consider it if I'm passing by on the highway (rare because I live in Henderson) or planning a trip to the newly opened IKEA store nearby (likely to happen sooner or latter). It's definitely not a destination as you might expect a ""Top 100"" spot to be.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,7,4,TZws9gHznqGlE1hTjKC3hA

After being told by so many people that Baguette Cafe is a must stop, I finally found myself in the area and time to stop by.

Using google directions through yelp I was takin a little off course. If your using google you be directed to the other side of the cooperate buildings. Simply turn into the car park and drive through to get closer to the highway.

Visiting on a weekday during lunch time, I expected a line and it blew through pretty quick. The owner was very nice and had time to chat. He recommended The chicken and The curry. Both were amazing! 

Everything is fresh, the actual Baguettes were freshly made. And even though I have driven past this place a million times I will be back real soon!! It's hard to argue with nearly every yelp review on here. Outstanding!

Maybe that it is the greatest cafe in the WORLD!!! Muahahahahahaha

AHEM! Anyway, I frequent this lovely cafe as often as I possibly can. My office is only about 4 minutes away. That's very dangerous. Luckily I have a bit of self control and a tight wallet. 

The owner greets everyone as they walk in and gives each and everyone the attention they deserve when you get to the counter. He will answer any and all questions and never rush you away for the next customer. He knows his regulars very well as each business should. It adds that extra touch of special. Only wish I would have is that they be open one day over the weekend, so that I may bring my family more often.

So instead of going through what I have tried, I will just fill you in on my favorite. 99% of the time I go with The Turkey sandwich and I switch out the Swiss for mozzarella. Turkey is always moist and everything is fresh. Caramelized onions are also included on this sandwich. Along side every sandwich is a petite salad with the most delicious dressing. I have yet to figure out exactly what it is. All I know is my mother and I are addicted to it. ADDICTED!! It's like a delicious drug. We also go with a classic black tea which is always brewed to perfection. Occasionally we will do a muffin or cookie, but we have to be extremely hungry. 

Let me end it this way, I've never had a bad experience here nor have I had anything that was not delicious!

Delicious is an understatement!!!!",7S2wwOSVSRn4CEZdtQKG_Q,8,7,5,ri0AHHzk2_lpWU4zIto8vg

I remember how much I loved Baguette Cafe months ago and decide to head there for lunch. Olivier actually remembers me (crazy!) and once again provided such a charming and personalized interaction. Ever helpful, and always ready to make a suggestion for those who are most indecisive (me). He noticed I had my laptop with me and right off the bat gave me the wifi password. Even the guy who delivered my food was funny, very helpful and got me more hot water for my tea as well as a slice of the peach custard tart so I wouldn't have to wait in line again.

On my most recent visit I tried the breakfast croissant with tomato instead of any meat. The flakiest croissant (baked fresh that morning, naturally) filled with a tomato jam and omelet style eggs filled with swiss and spinach. It came with a little salad (mostly a garnish) on the side, and was just right. It was satisfying, but light enough for me to still have room for that delectable peach tart afterwards. While the peaches aren't fresh, the custard is surprisingly eggy in a pleasant way, and the crust was just tender enough.

The chocolate tart looked amazing, dense and decadent, but I decided I'm saving that one until my next visit when I can pawn half of it off on a friend =)

It certainly won't take another 8 months for me to return.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,5,3,5,UMoWjJzpBa5fI5vxgYVm2g

I've been many times and will continue to go. I love sandwiches and they have the best prosciutto sandwich! It was bits of walnuts in the mayo. The salads are good, too! I've been for breakfast and its a perfect amount. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich... I wanted to go back for seconds! I've had the quiche once. I love quiche but I felt their quiche lorraine had way too many onions. So that's off for me. But that's ok because everything else I've had is super good.

This cafe is one of the very few places in town that actually serves real food.  What do I mean by real food? Well, first the soups here are all made from scratch; the turkey and chicken on the sandwiches aren't sliced off some glued together super-breast, it is actually identifiable as real meat. There are about thirty other examples of the little things that differentiate this spot from the average restaurant in town but rather than dwell on how lousy the food is everywhere else let me tell you about how great the food is here... I mentioned the soups; there are usually two soups per day; I've tried about 7 of their soups all of which have been awesome. The sandwiches are great and even the iced tea is good. Finally the croissant, oh man, just amazing...

My daughter who can be picky at times loved the omelet on croissant sandwich with pesto.  We had the chocolate tart for dessert and it was wonderful.  It had a cookie like crust and the flavor of dark chocolate.  Both the quiche and tart were generous servings and reasonably priced.

I chose a prosciutto sandwich and my husband opted for one of their specials, a Moroccan chicken sandwich. We also shared a bowl of the corn chowder. Wow, everything was super delicious! The bread is amazing and the ingredients are top notch. The corn chowder was incredible as well. Although the portions seem kind of small, the meal ended up being quite hardy.

The curry chicken sandwich: Light on curry flavor, mildly filling. I wish there was a side (other than the few pieces of lettuce) that it came with. At over $7 I want some fries or fruit. 
Açaí bowl: A little too big and watery for my liking. Lacking in toppings for the price. Order it somewhere else.

Sandwiches, soups, salads, and handmade coffees are made carefully by the staff and Oliver, the most genuine and passionate restauranteur/host I've ever come across in my years of being an adventurous foodie. 
In my attempt to change my eating habits, I finally tried the prosciutto salad and it is hands down one of the best salads I've ever had. And it's a salad, people. Almost a honey mustard drizzled over fresh and organic mixed greens, tomatoes, soft mozzarella, mouthwatering prosciutto and salami, sliced onions, and tiny croutons on the side; you're in heaven. The prosciutto sandwich is delicious too. Can you tell I'm Italian? I'm not but it is d*mn good!! And don't even get me started on their pastries. Freshly baked from love and recipes to kill for. Tarts, tortes, and twists; this is THE place for the ultimate cheat meal. The atmosphere is lively and the sweet smiles you get from behind the counter are so welcoming I just love coming here.

I can't help but feel that leaving this number of reviews may lead to catastrophe for my new favorite lunch spot.   So without further ado, allow me to push the BC to 667...

The Baquette Cafe is tucked behind an office park on Sunset Road with nothing more than a three foot high chalkboard sign alerting motorists of its existence.  Truth be told, I've driven past if for a year without ever noticing.  

If you're lucky enough to happen upon this place you will likely be greeted by its owner, Olivier, a vibrant Frenchman who will enthusiastically walk you through his menu with a thick French accent and ear to ear smile.

The menu is filled with the freshest organic ingredients and multiple vegan options.  In addition to breakfast and lunch items, there are also a variety of fresh pastries and deserts.  Each dish served is a bit of classic with something special added to bring it to the next level.  Take for example their turkey sandwich.  In addition to the freshness of the ingredients, Olivier adds caramelized onions for an extra zip that puts a smile on your face.   Pair their sandwiches or salads with a cup of their fresh soup for a perfect match.  You can enjoy unusual but delicious soups such as their celery or carrot soups.  They also have more traditional but equally tasty soups such as tomato or vegetable.

My friend and I went a little while before noon, and it was pretty empty. By the time 12:05 came, there was a line to the door!

The service was superior to any other place I've had in Las Vegas. The owner, Olivier, greeted us and spent the time to tell us about the soups and sandwiches of the day. He even asked for our names. The other workers were very attuned to our needs. One of them replaced my napkin and fork when my first ones were used up (usually I have to ask for new napkins). 

I ordered the Turkey Sandwich, a Vanilla Latte Frappe, and a chocolate twist pastry (I don't remember the French name for it.)

The sandwich was very good. The bread was fresh, and it came with mixed greens; much better than traditional shredded iceberg lettuce! There was mayonnaise on it (which was not stated on the menu). I hate mayo, but I happily gobbled it up because the sandwich was so yummy!

The Vanilla Latte Frappe is similar to a Starbuck's Vanilla Bean Frappucino, but a thousand times better! It may be due to the Illy-brand espresso, but the frappe at Baguette Cafe tasted super fresh, homemade, and not too sweet. Loved it!

My friend and I each ordered a pastry for dessert. I got a chocolate twisty thing, and my friend got a chocolate tort-type thing (it looked like a slice of pie.) Olivier told us that he would keep the pastries chilled for us until we were ready to eat them, because otherwise the chocolate would melt. Any other place would have just handed us the food to get it out of the way, but I could tell they have pride in their food! The two pastries we tried were amazing and tasted like a piece of heaven. 

The only things I would change about this place is the ambiance (there isn't much decoration on the walls or anything fancy about it), and the hours. I would have come here a long time ago if it were open later, or on weekends!

In a town of corporate structure and in your face advertising of today's specials this place stands alone. the vibe feels as though it was neatly dissected from the streets of San Francisco or Seattle and transplanted to our rugged desert land. Olivier greeted us as we walked in and asked our names and took the time to run through the whole lineup of today's pastries, breakfast specials (today was quiche loraine), sand which specials and HOMEMADE soups. All of the pannini's had familiar sounding names but each one seemed to have a special unique twist. I had the curry pannini because i personally am not a fan of curry. Usually it is to overpowering for me and the flavor is just off. I am happy to say the Baguette Cafe single handily changed me. After they're curry panini with actual chicken breast not slices and sun dried tomato's I was hooked. I could have easily donned a Curry baseball jersey and a big foam curry is #1 finger. my wife had the chipotle chicken pannini. Again another home run. Subtle spiciness, moist chicken, roasted tomato's and the contrast of the warm creamy goodness of the contents and the hollow sounding crunchy exterior of a delicious french baguette equal a perfect sand which experience. As if this was not enough reason to return we also shared the prosciutto infused potato pureed soup. Again absolutely divine. the creamy flavor packed soup shows you the one of a kind indulgence of simplicity. this was served with a few freshly seasoned crostinnis. Everything here was delicious and fresh. The fresh part was confirmed by Olivier when he told us everything he uses is fresh. I don't know what kind of secret farmers market he discovered out here or if he has an astounding garden on his roof but the quality of every ingredient and the love put into the preparation shine through. While we were there he pulled a freshly baked apple tart out of the oven. The smell could only be described as heavenly as going into to Joel Robuchon's memory bank of his grandmothers pastry cooking. Olivier told us ""some people sell crack, I sell apple tarts."" then based on the smell alone there will soon be Dr Drew's Las Vegas apple tart rehab. 

Short and sweet - If you have a weekday off go here for any meal or just a coffee and homemade pastry and feel like you have left town and ended up in an artisnal coffee shop somewhere along the coast. Phenomenal.",xSswLVAmW9bZ1-aVCfJyww,3,1,5,FfMZGTmRTRTnQ4EvygP1bw

The ambiance is Portland. It's very trendy and retro. The inside was very clean and very busy. The line was almost out the door and there was only 1 server. I think they were a little short staff cause we went first thing in the morning at 9am. 

Pricing is decent. Holy smokes! If you look at the size of the quiche I ordered, you would not mind paying what I paid. I didn't try any of the drinks this time, so all I ordered was food!

Quiche - this thing was the size of a pizza. No JOKE! A freaking size of a pizza. It was huge! It was so fresh that I bent my plastic fork. Lol. This was also very true. When I opened the togo container the quiche looked so amazing I took one bite before I started driving. That was when the heat bent my plastic fork. Lmao. There was plenty of prosciutto in this slice. Every bite I took, had a pice of prosciutto. I love mushrooms! OMG the mushrooms were were huge in my piece. I hope they make the whole pie like how they make my piece. 
 
Greek Salad - I did wish they put a little more lettuce in this salad. It wasn't very big. The container it came with was still very empty. Although the dressing was very good I think I could've gotten more lettuce since there was no meat in this salad.   

Chipotle Sandwich - I really though this sandwich was going to taste similar and better than the ones offered at Earl's but it's not. The sandwich was not spicy. So don't be scared to order it. There was a decent amount of chicken, but the taste was a little off. I couldn't pin point what I didn't like about it though. 

There is so much to offer here, that I would still give it 4 stars because I probably just ordered the wrong things. But what I did order was decent and not bad. Give it a try if you're in the area around 215 and going towards Summerlin.",-RA9NLalwmRTOX_8UMHnVQ,2,2,4,iMiu9DUix9wHf0-qMX9Zuw

The location is easy to access from the 215. Parking is easy since it's in a corporate parkway with plenty of parking. The inside of the restaurant is simple with about half a dozen tables. Most of the seating is outside. It didn't seem like seating was an issue since most people were getting their orders to go. 

The menu offers a nice variety of options. They serve breakfast as well as lunch. For lunch the paninis can be vegetarian with options for mushrooms or eggplant in place of meat. For meat eaters there are a couple of meat options. Even though I'm not vegetarian the option for mushroom or eggplant in place of meat sounded delicious.

Sharing is caring so like usual we shared everything we ordered for lunch. The Tuna Sandwich was the memorable savory item we enjoyed. The tuna was delicious and lacked any sort of fishy taste. Mixed in was olives and the sandwich was topped with egg and some other vegetables. The sandwich flavors reminded me of a Nicoise salad. I loved this and would definitely order it again. The Pesto Panini which we ordered with chicken and bacon was also good. The bread and other ingredients worked well together. I liked dressed on the simple greens to the side of each sandwich too.

For a sweet ending to our lunch we enjoyed Tiramisu and a Chocolate Croissant. Both were excellent. The Tiramisu had the perfect texture and taste. The first bite made me stop and close my eyes to savor the delicious flavor. The Chocolate Croissant was flaky and the chocolate was delicious. 

I will definitely be back, hopefully next time to try some of their breakfast menu!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,0,5,5a2NgIaeouJYJBdynycKJw

I just found Las Vegas's signature pastry here at Baguette Cafe. It's the strawberry muffin. I'm only writing this review as a plea to keep the seasonal strawberry muffin permanent. PLEEEEAAAASE make it a permanent item! McRib people can understand this plea. 

I'm kind of a pastry fanatic. I appreciate the level of preciseness that comes with pastries as my wife is quite the baker. So when it's holidays time, we jumped at the idea of ordering 2 dozens of these strawberry goodness.

If you like strawberry shortcake, just imagine this to be 10x better. My one knock of this place is that the service is incredibly slow. But if you're not in a rush, you're in for quite a treat.",PAzgMhSXGokkOw2CMZUI1w,7,6,5,ueNQMFbrjH1cCABWa3hLDQ

They apparently just started opening for the weekends but I suppose they used to be more of a corporate lunch place, given their location in the middle of several office buildings. Given this somewhat out of the way location, the number of reviews and high stars is a testament to the quality of their food and drink.  We think the prices are reasonable, service is very friendly, food is excellent ( just wish their 'salad' was actually more than half a handful of lettuce w/ some dressing!).  If we are ever on that side of town, we swing by now.  If you are seeking truly European food, fresh with simple but delicious texture and taste, this is it!

Baguette is a quaint breakfast/lunch spot that caters not just to the surrounding office community but to savvy locals who want good food and a great ambiance.
Olivier is welcoming and greets every guest like an old friend. The pastry chef moves about the kitchen bringing out scrumptious treats like tarts, muffins and the fresh baked croissants. These croissants will completely spoil you forever. It would have been a sin not to have one. The warm buttery aroma wafts through the air like a warm blanket for your olfactory senses. Close your eyes, sit at a table bathed in morning sunlight, drink a fresh mango orange juice, then take a bite of heaven.
The Croissant & egg omelette was incredible. The omelette is prepared to outstanding culinary standards, the croissant is light, flaky with a thin layer of buttery soft dough that almost melts in your mouth as you take a bite, there is a light tomato basil sauce that elevates it above all other breakfast croissants and it is served with a small house salad so you can have a serving of greens.
I am elated to have finally experienced Baguette Cafe and will make this a regular morning ritual at least once a week. ""Bon Appetite!""",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,14,8,5,jj2cFJ24VFynvbZHXnvHZA

Service: As I came in, I noticed a very friendly faced man who introduced himself as Olivier. I told him it was my first time, and I wanted his suggestions, but I knew I wanted some of whatever he was making with those watermelons. He told me to try the Eggplant sandwich. He then asked my name, shook my hand, and continued to introduce me to his whole staff.  Wow!  Never felt more welcome walking in a place. 

Food: I went with Olivier's suggestion of a half sandwich and cup of homemade soup. I also ordered some of the fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade. 
The sandwich was crispy on the outside with warm cheese and grilled eggplant in the middle. The soup was loaded with big chunks of vegetables. The lemonade was amazing.  So light and refreshing, I wanted more, but I was too full. 

Facility:  This is a small cafe type atmosphere, but the true charm was the outside seating. I just happen to come on a beautiful day that allowed me to enjoy the almost European atmosphere.  There was comfortable seats, plenty of greenery and soft music playing. Loved it!!!!!

4538474,2015-10-26,15,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I am writing this review while finishing one of the best tarts I've ever ordered here. I am a full believer in having goals, my biggest, is to get through a meal to enjoy dessert! Baguette Cafe makes it extremely easy because their not-super-sweet, sweets, are as beautiful to look at as they are to taste! 

I must start with savory! They have a very decent sized menu that includes quiche, breakfast sandwiches, salads, cold sandwiches, grilled sandwiches, and usually 2 homemade soups. And one of those soups is almost always vegan. Today they had Brussel Sprout and Creamy Pumpkin. I opted for Brussel Sprout and it was FANTASTIC. It was savory, creamy, and VEGAN. I would have put money on the fact there was at least cream or chicken stock in that velvety, perfect green soup. I've tried the chicken pesto sandwich and it was delicious, today I had The 3 Cheese with chicken. I LOVE goat cheese and they put the perfect amount to pair with the tomato basil pesto. I've had The 3 Cheese with prosciutto before as well, next time I'm doing bacon(not actually on the menu, just sounds good)! The sandwiches come with simply dressed mixed greens. If you'd like a heftier salad I recommend the Crunchy Green, it's not often you find jicama in a salad!

Okay, now the tarts!!! They are pretty infamous for the chocolate tart, which is decadent! I've enjoyed an amazing mixed berry and an apricot too. But today I was lucky enough to run into the plum cinnamon tart and the two flavors together is perfect. The crust is made with GREAT butter! If you know anything about baking, especially French treats, you HAVE to use amazing butter. They place beautiful pieces of seasonal fruit in this beautiful egg custard then into this perfectly semi-salted buttery crust. I recommend starting with the crust on this beauty, then working your way to the tip. The only way to make it better is to add a perfect iced americano! 

Do yourself a favor and check out Baguette Cafe, their 4.5 star rating tells you this place is every bit as tasty as the reviews say.",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,28,24,5,BzE33x8JrV4U-Jj4_587dg

Croissant on the egg sandwich was beautifully golden and buttery, with some sort of a lovely tomato spread inside. Cappuccino was perfect and as expected.

To my misfortune, they ran out of soup when I got there (around 3 in the afternoon). Soup is my favorite, but I do like me some paninis! A friend and I ordered the 3-cheese panini and the eggplant panini. Both were very delicious and full of flavor! The bread was the ideal texture. I also distinctly identified the pesto within the sandwich and found it to be very savory! Mmm! They were both such great sandwiches and they both came with a little serving of mixed greens. I have no idea what the dressing was, but that was scrumptious, too, and very light!

On a side note, I think a common complaint people have with ""eating healthy"", fresh, or light meals like these is that they don't ""feel full"" afterward. But this definitely had me stuffed in the best way possible! To go with my panini, I had myself a hot chai and it was perfect right down to a tea (tee)! Lol. Never mind the awkward pun... The modern decor is white and bright! The daylight comes in through the windows so beautifully! The simplicity of the decor also brings attention to the lovely photos on the walls!

Lastly, the service was awesome! Everyone here talks of Olivier so kindly and it is definitely true how personable he is to his customers. As someone who likes to experiment with different diets (pescetarianism, vegetarianism, veganism), when he mentioned vegetarian options, I was definitely over the moon. He noticed that and didn't hesitate to ask about it. Who doesn't like genuine, friendly service?!

I'd truly recommend this place to everyone I know, but a significant part of me really just wants to keep it all to myself. LOL...

You won't regret coming to Baguette Cafe!

It's usually tough for a business to live up to the hype, but I've been on a lucky run lately. Baguette Cafe recently popped up on my radar thanks to some stellar ratings. I'm glad to report that Olivier's humble little joint in an unassuming business park next to the freeway... is all that and a baguette (of chips?).

I went there for lunch today. I had read about some amazing soups, so I decided to get a half sandwich and soup combo. For the sandwich, I chose their curry chicken on a baguette. Are you kidding? How could that not be good? But the thing that blew me away was the soup. It was some sort of sweet potato concoction with puréed carrots and some curry spice. It was pretty incredible. In hindsight, that soup was the perfect thing to pair with my sandwich.

If there was one thing to complain about, the portions are kind of small. But that's just my American brainwashing speaking. Honestly, the meal satisfied me completely. I will definitely return.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,11,6,5,uERDClK-pjeLp2iqQ-l2hQ
4629508,2018-04-08,0,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"I first came here a year ago, only ordered the egg, ham, and swiss croissant. The wait was extremely long due to how busy they are compared to employees. The croissant was ok, wasn't enough for me to wait another 20+ minutes again.

So, a year later I decided to try this place again on a whim, realizing I had never even tried their coffee last time. I came before work, shortly after they opened. I still had a bit of a wait but it was closer to about 10 minutes this time. I ordered a starberry white chocolate muffin that they heated up and a hot white chocolate mocha. Both were delicious, I was pretty impressed with both. Usually when I find a good coffee place for some reason the pastries they have I usually don't care for so it was nice to have an actual good muffin without needing to go to a bakery.

I left this on a 4 star due to the wait still (only two people working and ringing). Although I was very satisfied with the coffee and muffin, desert wind coffee is on my way to work and tases just as good. They're also much faster and have a rewards program. If they had more people working I wouldn't mind stopping in here instead about once a week. However, with the wait that they have I'd have to actually wake up probably about 30 minutes earlier just to make enough time to stop here and it's just not worth it to me.

On the rare occasions I'm up early enough (as I was recently!) I'll consider stopping. If you live nearby and have some time, I'd definitely recommend stopping by.",K0nNkWrwogABf_TkG9Ywhg,0,0,4,HxotcO5VsMlLnsaoKRfDww

+ The aroma and smell
+ Affordable prices

I ended up getting a ham and swiss croissant because I had heard that the croissants are legendary! Perfect butter proportion, and the ham and cheese melted perfectly.

My friend had gotten a Pesto baguette, I didn't get a chance to try it but judging the look on her face she was extremely satisfied.

A pain in the arse to find. Buried in a sea of office space. What sucks is the only way to get to this place is taking Frontage Rd, which happens to be a 1 way street. So if you're coming from the west side of this place like me, you're going have to make a big circle to get to this place. Also, don't miss it, or you have to go around in circles. Be sure to have your navi if you suck with directions.

When I eventually found this place, I was the only one there, with another group of people who seem to work in one of the office space around the area. The place looked like it just opened. The chef is apparently French, but doesn't seem to have that heavy French accent, so you can understand him. 

The Ham Sandwich I got was served with a Baguette. Just a warning, this isn't the same French Baguettes that are super long. They are less than a foot long (I think). He made it fresh, so it took a little longer than if you were eating at Subway. He did tell me while I was waiting, just wish he told me before I ordered. The ham and greens of choice were very fresh. You can taste each individual ingredient and just yummy. Beats Subway and even Togos by far. Haven't tried Capriotti yet, so can't compare. My sandwich came out to $6 and some change which isn't too bad for what you're getting. 

They also have an illy espresso machine and illy branded cups. I'm not an espresso drinker so can't comment on those.

Bottom line, if you want something a lot better then Subway for a small premium and you can find this place, try it. Would get a 5 star, but had to knock it for its crappy location and the wait time till my sandwich was ready.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,1,0,4,IwVMVYgxD0U0j4UOU8TUdQ

I am knocking off a point for their smoothies. I ordered a mango strawberry smoothie. Although it had the authentic taste of mango, it tasted like a frozen snapple. It had a very icy consistency, not smooth or creamy. It was more of a slush then anything. It costs about 4.50. It was disappointing. I definitely wouldn't order that again or recommend it.

Somehow everyone is so fascinated, but me!

Went there for lunch. First time, so it wasn't easy to find it. Only thing that helped me to get there that I saw the sign from the freeway many times!

My BF and I both ordered the Grilled eggplant panini with extra turkey added. And for drinks, he ordered iced tea, and for me hazelnut cappuccino.

After we paid, went outside to find table. They were plenty of empty places, but dirty. One after another, all dirty tables. Finally got a table next to the entrance, got napkins and wiped off the table.
About 15 minutes later we got served.
Everything looked good!
I took the first bite, and struggled. Then I realized I am fighting a big piece of paper from my sandwich.
Immediately went inside, asked people in line to excuse me to go front. I showed my food to the cashier. He immediately took it from me, and gave it to the cook. The cook said, OH IT'S ONLY PAPER FROM MEAT. I said, okay, but it's not supposed to be served! Cook gave me a dirty look, didn't want to fix the problem. Well, I asked again, WOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO EAT THE PAPER? 
Finally the cashier told him to make a new sandwich!
I couldn't watch him prepare the new sandwich, I returned to my table. Very soon my food arrived. Honestly, I really lost my appetite!
I kind of forced myself to try and eat, since I was hungry.
After other customers left from the neighboring tables, the cashier came to us. He apologized, said SORRY many times, apologized for the cook's behavior, too.

Bottom line: IT IS VERY RUDE TO DENIAL ABOUT WRONGDOING! The cook was very rude!

Panini was tasty for the second time.
My cappuccino didn't taste hazelnut at all!

1) it's in a random location
2) it doesn't have that cafe ambiance THAT much
3) it's sooo far

Legit baguette bread? CHECK. At one point, I grew up on french style baguette. I can taste it when it's store bought or made with TLC. And here it's made with TLC. All the food is. Food here is an art and I absolutely love it. AND it tastes great and healthy. 

Great marinated chicken-CHECK
Fresh ingredients--CHECK

The owner is actually from France and we shared a bonding moment when I saw he had Vietnamese fish sauce (Vietnamese food IS french and Chinese fusion basically).  He is such a sweet heart and they have great service. So worth the drive.",2ZAGNRs2kmUk1H2BOW_3OA,1,1,5,PrSlkRKdAtMohPZt0L043Q

At first I felt a little guilty when he was explaining their menu items in full detail and asking where we were from, but I quickly realized that the folks line understood that this is a place to relax, engage in a little conversation, get fresh pastries or breakfast and hang for as long as you want.

Rarely, do you get an instant feeling that you are at a place where the owners love what they do and puts ttotal passion into it.  The employees equally present themselves the same way.

I can't say enough good things about this place...you can eat inside or outside the cafe.  The croissants and quiches are outrageously good and priced just right.
Staff and ambiance are just what you are looking for to have a nice breakfast/brunch with friends or as a couple.  
You order up front and take a number...(similar to Cafe Leon's) wait was minimal for as busy as it was...first come first serve tables.

As has been noted by some other reviewers, its a little tricky to find the place at first, in the far corner of a group of office buildings, but its well worth the effort.

I got there about 11:40 am which I think was perfect timing, since by the time my food came out almost every seat in the place was taken. The decor is very nice - simple but beautiful.  Normally small local cafes look pretty amateurish inside, but Baguette Cafe was done right.  Its warm and inviting and definitely a place you'd like to eat at or just have a cup of coffee in. 

I decided to have a ham sandwich and a cup of their roasted pepper and gouda soup, both of which were very good.  I don't normally care for tomatoes but the sandwich was good enough that I actually enjoyed them.  The presentation of the plate was also very nice, with plates and bowls that were a cut above what you'd expect to find in most Vegas cafes.

Olivier, whom I take to the owner, was very nice and welcoming, introducing himself and asking me which nearby building I worked in (none of them, I live down the street) and asking my name when I left and shaking my hand - something you definitely don't get at most restaurants or cafes!

All in all I'm very impressed with Baguette Cafe and recommend anyone in the area (or out of it, its worth a drive) to give it a try.",GQHALW3lLovKRXhHPEq00g,3,1,5,mUOvq_iH9IR5kkSSFpmDbg

The croissant was excellent, so buttery and flaky. It was a delicious sandwich. My latte was yummy as well, especially because it was made with whole milk and I usually get mine nonfat. Baguette Cafe only offers whole milk, almond milk and soy milk.

I couldn't help myself from stepping into this place everyday while attending classes inside the building right across. The fact that I'm anticipating to eat lunch there everyday should justify my statement.

I love croissants and I've had them in a number of places, including France; and I haven't found a place that does it right than Baguette Cafe (in Vegas). Light, airy, buttery and not to mention FRESH, it baffles me on how they won't initiate a dozen deal by now.

Aside from the obvious obsession, the sandwiches and salads are up to par as well. The Chicken Salad/Sandwich is my go-to choices whenever I'm starving but I'm always sure to try the others whenever the time calls for it. And as other reviews have stated, be prepared to wait in line prior to and after ordering- as everything is made to order.

Baguette Cafe offers indoor and outdoor seating which I love. Their menu looks so good! They have tons of vegetarian and vegan options as well. They also offer amazing fresh soups daily. We both ordered the Blue and Brie sandwich with mushrooms. Baguette gives you the option of mushrooms or chicken on this sandwich. 

Since it was such a nice day we ate outside. They have plenty of seating outside among the trees almost makes you forget your in a business complex. They offer benched seating as well as single seats covered in cushions.

Our food came out quickly. Our sandwiches were accompanied by a small side salad with a house vinaigrette. Super tasty and I loved the tang it had. Now that sandwich!!!! Yummy! The bread which was perfectly toasted and I'm pretty sure was home made. It was the perfect vehicle for all the cheesey goodness. There was a layer of sautéed mushrooms and onions. Next came a little blue cheese and a thick slice of melty Brie! I couldn't help but eat the whole thing.

5019990,2011-04-30,1,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"(My 400th review...Woot, woot!)

During our most recent adventure to Vegas, we were in search for another great sandwich place and we ended going to Baguette Cafe.  Yeah, it was a little out of the way from the Strip, not to mention, it's located deep inside a business park.  Thankfully, I noticed the sign on their building while on the 215 so it wasn't that hard to figure out.

We got there around 11am on Tuesday and it was empty, we figured we'd beat the lunch rush.  The gentleman who helped us, we didn't get his name but I'm assuming he's the infamous Olivier, was quite hospitable.  He asked if we've been there before, offered suggestions and went through all the menu items we were curious about.  In the end, I ordered the Blue Brie Panini and the s/o ordered the Chipotle Chicken Panini.  With one bottled soda and one Iced Tea it all came out to just under $20.  I noticed they had Illy Coffee too, which is awesome but it was too warm to drink coffee. :)

It took awhile for our sandwiches to be made, not sure why.  However, I did notice that their phone kept ringing and Olivier would give each caller the undivided attention that he provided us.  Yeah, that's awesome but at the same time, customers were starting to line up and wait.

When our sandwiches came out, the presentation was nice.  It came with a couple leaves of greens, the s/o said it was a salad because it had dressing, but IMO, it was a garnish but wow, it was tasty.  It would've been nice to have larger portion.

The s/o and I split our sandwiches to experience both.  My Blue Brie was pretty awesome!  The turkey was poached so, it's not your cold cut turkey, so it tasted quite fresh.  It also had apples and walnuts.  I absolutely loved it!  The Chipotle Chicken was good, just a little too spicy for me, hence ""Chipotle"" but who can hate on a sandwich with bacon in it?  The bread however is totally what made both Paninis, it rocked!  They baguette was freshly baked and served warm, yum!  Eat your heart our Subway and your ""Eat Fresh"" slogan, this is the real deal!

Overall, Baguette Cafe is a cute little place that I would love to visit again, maybe on the way to Red Rock.  I'll just have to remember that they're only open Mon-Fri.

Now that our days off are weekdays and our friends who have the same day off as us live in the SW, it was time to finally check something off my list that has been sitting there, patiently, for years. 

We were gonna order off the menu until we were told the two specialty sandwiches. There was a yellow curry chicken sandwich and a moroccan sandwich that had north african spices, goat cheese, red bellpepper, etc. Both sandwiches were great sounding so we chose those. I liked the moroccan a bit more, but only because Im a sucker for those flavors combos. The bread was nice, good balance of crusty and softer bready center. 

Got the ice tea of the day - green tea citrus gingko which was refreshing. I like places the brew fresh, and brew something a bit more unique that plain black. 

The service was really friendly - it was the owner of the place at the counter. He was super enthusiastic and caring of his place. They brought out our food outside and came to check on everyone outside which I didn't expect. It is always a nice touch for counter service places to still have some sort of service. 

I think the price to quality ratio was very good. It seems they use better products with an emphasis on natural, healthy choices and nice to have places not charge a arm to get fresh choices.

I can see why people like this as their casual lunch spot. I think there are other similar sandwich and coffee type cafes like these you can compare it to, and this I think this probably ranks top notch among them.

I also ordered a 1/2 turkey sandwich and a cup of onion soup. I really wanted to try the lemon tart and the seasonal fruit tart but I was just too full for that. The fact that mostly all their food items are organic and they can make it gluten free is awesome! Their meats aren't processed. They baked everything the morning of. Everything is fresh.

Nice, friendly and absolutely Frenchy. Deliver great service with a smile, food are phenomenal although I prefer my baguette to be just a little bit softer cos it seems that I gotta chew with my jaw a little it.

The only downside to this place is the hours of operation, only opened M-F during work hours, 7am- 5pm. 

I just had the Bleu Brie sandwich today and it was delicious.  It was not my favorite though, since it was missing some kick to it.  Now what it specifically needs, I do not know.  I do love me some brie on baguette, though, yumm!  I really love the yellow curry chicken sandwich.  It's usually on the written menu.  If it is not, you can probably ask Olivier (I think that's his name, and I'm sorry if you're reading this - I forgot your name, but judging from what everyone else is writing, it looks like Olivier is your name) to make it for you.  I also like eating my sandwich in the cafe, since it comes with a palm-sized amount of salad.  It really is not a lot, but it's a very petite addition at no extra cost to your order. 

I also had the quiche today, the one with bacon and swiss cheese.  I've been wanting to try it in the past, but they'd always be out.  I ate the quiche after the sandwich, and being somewhat full did not stop me from enjoying the savoriness of this quiche.  

In the past, I had ordered a blended iced-coffee.  It wasn't as tasty as I like my iced coffee to be.  I usually like it on the stronger, chicory-esque, sweet side.  However, my coworker had one today, and she said it was good.   

The cafe gets a bit busy during lunch time.  I have yet to see how the foot-traffic is during the mornings.  If you have a 30 minute lunch, then I would suggest calling ahead of time and placing an order, just to prevent from waiting in a line to order and then waiting for your food to be made.  The cafe is pretty decently sized, a bit on the smaller size, but it works.",K536-wsQXCN7bZaPM0RDng,0,0,5,AZ05MijPixixsd10GDB_QA

The chipotle chicken sandwich melts in your mouth with just the right amount of kick. And the chocolate tart? silky and luscious! The coffee on the other hand I could have gone without, I got a white chocolate mocha and café mocha with hazelnut, neither drink made an impression. It needed more oomph in my opinion. There's also a bit of a wait for your food after you've ordered because there's only 2 of them, it took about 25 minutes for me to get out of there (there was a group of 3 ahead of me) They take pride in the quality of their food and it's really worth it in the end but I wouldn't go back unless I know I have plenty of time to spare. I wish they were open on the weekends though, it's a nice spot to have brunch with the family. I will surely be back one of these days.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,5,3,4,O6OGeDrTZvF9M2I3qWT0ww

It's secretly hidden from your view unless you venture to the back of the office park on West Sunset Road, northwest of the 215 and Buffalo Drive.

The baguettes, on which the sandwiches are served on is baked in-house. They are very light, crusty and buttery. My favorite sandwich is the ""Prosciutto"" which consists of mixed greens, prosciutto, tomatoes, and blue cheese spread.
I have had fantastic Quiche in many different French Cafes in Las Vegas, but Baguette Cafe surpasses them of all. It's fluffy, creamy, and very satisfying, the secret is in the flour and  temperature control. 
Don't leave without trying the torte, the chocolate and the mixed fruit taste heavenly.

Olivier is an amazing host, very nice and humble!!
On occasion, I'll mildly observe peoples interactions with him and he's always puts smiles on peoples faces. He genuinely cares about his customers, and the regulars feel that positive vibe thus express the appreciation. 
The prices are very reasonable, you won't be disappointed.

I had always been meaning to try the Baguette Cafe for months, but finally made it up here after running random errands around the city. The hype, unlike most places, is well-deserved.

Right when I walked in, the place was full to capacity - tables occupied inside and out, a line forming all the way to the door. Luckily, this allowed me to sort out my indecisions, and decided upon a tea and the Eggplant panini. Not only are the other fellow patrons incredibly nice (as found out through enduring a line together), but Olivier is perhaps one of the sweetest, most charming men. Joking around, offering suggestions, and making small talk even when there are five people behind me, he makes you feel right at home, and treats you as a patron rather than another order. 

Sitting outside, I was brought my tea by Oliver and panini accompanied by a small salad later on by another staff member. The panini was so simple, yet so immensely satisfying. Eggplant, mozzarella, and marinara sauce on bread - even though I could count the ingredients on one hand, it tasted phenomenal. You could taste the love that went into such a simple sandwich The salad was a nice sidekick, playing the role of added nutrition to all the carbs I was about to ingest. 

After my meal, Olivier really showed his gregariousness. Wrapping up my leftovers, he asked how the meal went and other various questions. But what impressed me the most was adding in another packet of the green tea I had ordered as well as being so friendly and relaxed despite being in the midst of a rush. 

Honestly, Baguette Cafe is the sort of place I could sit at for hours, staring at the nearby mountain range - throw in some more delicious food and a cup of tea, and I'd be perfectly content. The savory side of the menu was impressive, and only leaves me with an excuse to visit again to try all of the sweeter goods.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,4,1,5,KZPBr6bgjkDgrCLeRpLsLA

For a while now, I've been wanting to try this place out because of the reviews from yelp, as always.  Plus, it's different to Asian and Mexican food that we've been eating in the past.  My boss decided to drive with me, and thank God she did because if it weren't for her I would've been making u-turns on a constant basis.  

We got there and immediately I thought of California.  My boss thought the same since there are tables and chairs outside and the patrons who went there had the appearance of being from Cali.  I can't explain any further than this.  Lax?  Laid back?

Anyway, I ordered the chipotle chicken panini and turnip soup that had brochuto (wrong spelling) in it.  Mmmm... delish! As how my boss describes it after eating hers.  The spice in chipotle was just enough to give the panini that extra umph.  The soup was definitely delicious and I'm almost addicted to it.  I tried my boss's bell pepper and tomato soup and it was just okay.  I think the turnip soup beat that hands down.  Even she said so herself.

Overall experience was awesome.  I'd come back over and over again just to try everything else in their menu board.  Which by the way, they don't have a menu.  I think they change their menu regularly.  I actually like that.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,1,5,wlP2Oke7pRRH1XKFvxmVZQ

I typically get the Proscuitto salad and one of his yummy soups. They change daily and have yet to disappoint. The cream of mushroom was the best cream of mushroom I've ever had. I look forward to trying more of them every time I go. 

My favorite new addition to the menu is the FRESH Thai coconuts !! I adore coconut water so getting the chance to drink out of a fresh coconut from Thailand on my lunch break is a major treat.

I won't deduct any stars for this, but it's a major bummer there is never any quiche when I go at lunch. Apparently it sells out at breakfast.

Highly praised by locals and viewed from the highway on my Monday to Wednesday commute the lone factor preventing me from visiting Olivier Brouillet's ""Baguette Café"" to date was the weekday only hours, an understandable choice given the restaurant's business-park locale but a pity for those living within the somewhat Un-Vegasy constraints of a 7:30a-5:00p Monday through Friday schedule.  Small in size but airy in décor it was just after eight o'clock on a PTO Monday with family in town that our trio made way into the brightly lit room and with a few locals lingering over coffee as fresh baked goods stocked a small pastry case it was mere seconds before Olivier greeted us with a smile, our affirmation to his ""first time?"" inquiry leading to a full description of nearly every item ready or soon to emerge from the kitchen and our eventual order comprising the majority of them.  Admittedly intrigued by the sandwiches but preferring to focus on pastry it was with mild disappointment that Illy was the only brew offered as I find their over-roasted beans poorly suited for much but with this small quibble aside the glut soon to arrive would by-and-large impress, the simple  croissant on par with those of Paris as shattering layers gave way to echoing caverns of butter while four items laced with high quality chocolate each proved superlative - the crispy rimmed cookie near-molten at its core and the torte rich in taste but ethereal in texture.  Not quite as impressive or diverse as Bonjour Bakery, La Belle Terre, or Thomas Keller's Bouchon but featuring a combination of great pastry and lovely service that sets it apart Baguette Café is every bit the local gem that many have claimed and although hours and coffee will prevent frequent visits I've no doubt I'll find my way back eventually if not for a full meal at least for thing; an almond financier beyond my superlatives warrants any presumed hassles of location or time, even rush-hour on the 215.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,4,4,1W5Hpdc2x2IGrEfILExvfw

Gathering medical records from various hospitals for myself and my Gammy, she asked if there was a place to grab some food that didn't suck. Knowing that Dyanna and I have similar tastes and FINALLY being able to check it off the bookmark list, I arrived here at Baguette Cafe. I highly recommend using GPS to find this place. It's tucked in with a bunch of medical offices and business buildings.

The place has a fast casual environment. A huge portion of the space is occupied by the food prep station, espresso bar, and the kitchen. The space was mostly empty and there were a few patrons enjoying the Spring day outside.

The menu is huge and written on a chalkboard, there were a variety of sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were vegan/vegetarian/carnivore options. I talked to the owner, Olivier, and he was knowledgable, answered all my questions, and made me feel welcome.

My vegan cream of veggie soup was amazing. A green mush color, but full of flavor and it wasn't overly salty. It was balanced and delicious. I ordered an eggplant sandwich in vegan glory and my grandma got the tuna salad. Both were nice potion sized and excellently prepared. I love when you can taste freshness and that's what was delivered.

Baguette Cafe was all that I hoped for and all that I dreamed it to be. I can't wait to find myself in the SW area of town to dine her for a quick, comfy, casual lunch again.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,11,11,5,oMFepRWc_Y1lbbiZ24OFNg

This place is chock-full of character. It's a great escape from a horrendous workday. I've never been to France but the vibe here feels French cafe-esque. The owner, who is French, is also the cashier and he is a total charmer. Plus he is happy to help you out with your order should you have any questions. Sometimes I just ask him questions I know the answer to just to hear his accent. I know I know....
And It's also a family owned\run restaurant so that also adds some warm and fuzzies to the experience.

I've been here twice (soon to be 3x because I want to go back tomorrow).
Both times I ordered the chipotle sandwich and both times I considered licking every crumb and drop of sauce off my plate. I could say it was the flavor combination. I could say it was due to the incredible chipotle sauce and fresh avocados. I could also say that it was the fresh & crisp baguette it came on. I'll just say it was all of the above.

I ordered a cup of the cream of celery soup today. I don't even like celery all that much, but I had heard the owner\cashier describe it to the guy in front of me and I was sold. My only regret was I didn't order a bowl.... or a gallon. There was a distinct essence of  fresh celery in the soup but somehow, maybe magically, the creaminess mixed in with the freshness made this the best cup of soup I can remember. Apparently I do like celery.

Both times I ordered a coffee beverage. For the coffee snobs out there, myself included, they serve Illy coffee. For the non-coffee snobs -- this is AWESOME coffee. First time was drip coffee the 2nd was an iced white mocha.... both yummy.

So for a half sandwich, a cup of soup, and medium iced white mocha totals just 12 bucks..... a small price to pay for perfection, I'd say. Baguette Cafe is a jewel of a lunch joint. If I didn't work in the area, I'd find an excuse to drive across town just to enjoy it.

5374308,2011-04-29,5,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"Tucked away in a complex surrounded by banks and business buildings, this quaint coffee house is perfect for a lazy brunch. Stepping through the doors, it would be a shame to rush out in such a hurry. 

The decor is simple, nothing elegant or pretentious, but the people working makes it comfortable and warm. Chatting with Olivier was a pleasure. Watching him interact with his patrons reminds me that the service industry is not all about how fast the food can be thrown out, how fast people can down it, and turning the table. The people that frequent this cafe enjoy having conversation over superb food. The food talk ignites the wannabe Anthony Bourdain in me. 

I am convinced after visiting that I could close my eyes and point to any item on the menu and not regret it. Katrina M. and I was passing a panini around like it was an elicit drug. (Disclaimer: The promotion of illegal substances is not intentional.) That is how good the food is. The three cheese panini with prosciutto was magnificent. The creaminess of the goat cheese and the subtle snap of the mozzarella mellows out the Gorgonzola. The cured ham rounded out the sandwich, giving it just the right amount of saltiness. Grilled crisp on a a crusty ciabatta bread gave contrast to the otherwise texture-less sandwich. The half bacon omelet panini with orange juice and your choice of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate is a steal at $4.95. Ask for it on ciabatta or a croissant will only cost fifty cents more. Being the gluttonous fiends that we are, we ordered a pain au chocolat and a slice of the apple tart. The chocolate croissant was flaky on the outside, chewy on the inside, buttery, and the chocolate melted as soon as it met the fork. I have not had a croissant of this caliber since France. The apples on the tart were crisp. The light layer of custard did not make their crust soggy and was not too rich.  

The quality of coffee is important as well. I had ordered an Americano and my friend ordered a coffee. We lucked out, Olivier was brewing a new pot. The few minutes it took was worth it. A good coffee should be strong, bold, and not bitter. No sugar, no cream, full flavor.

My current lunch time fix involves an order of the Moroccan sandwich, which comes with a choice of chicken or eggplant.  I am by no means a vegetarian, but on this sandwich I actually prefer the eggplant due to the moist, tender texture.  If I'm feeling splurgey, then I grab a 'Real' coconut water to pair, which is as close to cracking open a coconut as you're gonna get.

5390871,2016-04-11,4,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"For years I had seen Baguette Cafe listed among various coffee shops(?) on the Yelp Las Vegas homepage list of ""Best Food in Las Vegas"", and I scoffed.  No doubt in my mind that Baguette probably had some fine sandwiches, quiches and the like, but I severely doubted that it was worth a trek from UNLV or my house in the Southeast to experience.  If I could turn back time to September of 2009 I would most certainly be Duke of this joint raising my Yelp cred.  Unfortunately I don't have time travel abilities and am stuck with a paltry 8 check-ins here and non-elite status for '16 which I wear with Scarlet Letter-like shame.  

The food here is really on point.   I especially am in love with most of the salads they offer.  In particular the Ham, Prosciutto and Tuna varieties just blow me away every time.   In perusing the reviews I saw a random 1 star review which made me pause, and saw the reviewer complaining about the length of time it took for his salad, and wondering why (I'm paraphrasing) ""it took so long to throw some meat and greens together"".   I, for one, am happy that it's not that simple for the staff here to lovingly put together what very well might be the best salads in Las Vegas that I've had.  I've actually stood, drink in hand, watching them prepare my salad-to-go order (yes, that's just as creepy as it sounds), and there's a lot of attention to detail and, dare I say, culinary love going into these.  All of the ingredients, from the meats, cheeses, veggies and herbs always taste fresh and no component seems out of place or unneeded.  

I can only put the highest of recommendations on those three salads, as I tried the chicken salad once, as well as the greek salad with chicken, and found the chicken to be bland in comparison to the other protein options.  

I haven't really delved into the sandwich options much as the salads demand my attention every time.  Preferring salads to sandwiches is something I would've once only thought a Bizarro version of myself would say.

Sandwiches (bread by far is one of the best!):

The Prosciutto - Best sandwich on the menu hands down

The Chipotle - Had the chicken version and was ok....

The Blue Brie - Had the chicken version and it was a little interesting having a hot sandwhich but with sliced apples...intresting as in it was weird...weird as in not in a good way...

The Curry - had flavor and was good...got the chicken version


Quiche - Very good and rich

Apple Pastry - One of the best and reminds me of the ones i get at the Japanese dessert or French dessert places...fresh apples with a buttery crust

Honestly that Prosciutto Sandwich with that bread and spread is some of the most high quality sandwich for a $6ish price point. I don't know it's something about that specific sandwich that warrants this place a 5 star however me being who I am tried a wide variety of things and the way that Prosciutto sandwich made me feel can not be said the same for some of the other sandwiches.

Always a warm welcome from all the staff! Which is a tell tale sign of any well managed business.  I've had the sandwiches, the pastries and the soups, all are fresh and superb!

But, I'm freeway close and from Orange County, so driving is no bid deal to me.

I got lost trying to find Baguette, as it is tucked away in a business complex.  I eventually got a clue and looked for the address on the buildings.  I eventually found it.  The restaurant is small but well kept.  Their displays are amazing and everything looked so good.  The service was nice too.  I like the personal aspect at the counter while ordering.  The guy taking my order asked me about my tattoos.  I like that... a friendly greeting goes a long way with me.

I ordered the Chicken salad.  And, I was informed that they could make any sandwich on the menu into a salad.  But, I kept to my order.  The salad was okay but that was the way I ordered it so I can't complain.  I tend to pick through and separate my veggies.  I'm weird like that.

I have been raving about this place for some time, but don't manage to get out to these parts often.  I am sure everyone would agree a relocation can be bitter sweet considering that the current location does cater to the medical and business district surrounding the area..  Those of us that don't frequent this area suffer while the nearby patrons prosper, although, Oliver makes it worth the drive as well.  If a relocation is in the future, I pray that it's not an expansion unless they can duplicate it enhance the service, otherwise, it's hard to replace the experience.

We stopped in after picking up my fiance's pops from the airport.  Breakfast was on order and we all had a day off what better time to sample over of the great breakfast joints Vegas has to offer.  Our walk from the parking lot included a warm greeting from the maintenance workers outside, uncommon but awesome.  We were then greeted inside and conversed with Oliver again, who provided a passionate overview of the days special offerings.  Everything looks up for the day ahead.

My fiance offered the chicken brie, my pops in law, the breakfast pannini, and myself, the fresh made quiche.  I don't know about everyone else's dish, but the quiche was the best I had.  It was most and flavorful with a good balance of ingredients.  The slice is hefty and a perfect portion to hold me down till lunch rolls around.  I did get to sample the fresh made chocolate truffle croissant twist as well and it was euphoric, considering I'm not much of a sweet tooth.

The ambiance is very welcoming and noticed new decorative art that added a nice touch.  The over sized glossed photography art adorned the walls, but a fee more were needed towards the rear of the eating area.  I believe the art resembled modern French stills.  I dug it and it reminds me of the art in the original Bachi Burger, also priced for gallery sale.  Staff always make you feel at home and when the weather permits, the outside patio provides a refreshing experience.

Don't forget about the coffee selection.  Illy can be a little overwhelming for my taste, since I'm a black coffee person, but think will more than satisfy other coffee aficionados.

I would give this experience an overall 4.5, minus 0.5 for the location, but round it up and what do you get?? A five-star experience and coming from me, that's really saying something.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,2,5,1q92z5ry1PEVWaN4EM4l7g

After having just finished a lovely holiday bike ride, I met up with two of my favorite foodie kiddos, Derek and Petra, and their moms since I knew they'd be off, too.  Long a Yelp bookmark, it was finally a great day to dine here since they're closed on the weekends.  
After zig-zagging through the parking lot, I found the cafe.  Every table was taken and there was a short line at the register to order.  Thankfully, one party vacated while we were in line, so our party of five could sit down inside.  This place is very popular; after I checked in on Yelp, a plethora of recommendations were thrown my way in the comments section.  I was told to get the soup of the day, no matter what it was.  When I got to the register, Olivier, the friendly proprietor, told me the soups of the day were cream of zucchini with parmesan and cream of roasted pepper, but the latter wasn't ready just yet.  I chose a cup of the zucchini soup with a half of the 3 Cheese sandwich with added turkey for protein.  I spied the croissants behind Olivier and asked for one of those, too.  Petra ate the zucchini soup and Derek munched on a raisin croissant; these kids have good taste and that's why I eat with them a lot.  We all enjoyed our food, including the new acai bowl that's been added to the menu.  
There was a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there and, in fact, the line was to the door by the time we left.  Word on the street is that Olivier is opening up another establishment and it will be open on weekends; if that's the case, I will certainly be back more often with the little partners in dine (and their moms).",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,7,4,RzLQJyJ4TJDfxzm72jHitw

The only negative thing I have to say about our past experience was how busy it was...it was early January on a Sunday around 12:30pm (party of 4) and it was a little too cold to sit outside (where they have the majority of seating) but every table inside was already being used.  

We ended up outside and thankfully a table of 4 finished right before our food came out so we quickly bussed the table and enjoyed the warmth. 

The food was wonderful. I did 1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup. The soup was broccoli and I am so glad I got to try it on a cold Vegas day. I choose the chipotle sandwich with chicken and it hit everything I had hoped from it.

At first, everything seemed okay. I was greeted by Oliver, who was very welcoming. I ordered a sandwich (I don't remember the name), a cup of thai curry soup, a chocolate pastry, and a water cup. I expected to wait anywhere between 15-25 minutes considering how busy it was at the time. I waited a whole hour for my food to finally get to my table. That's right, one whole hour. For just one sandwich, a cup of soup, a pastry, and a water cup. That's it. 

On top of waiting for about an hour, I saw other customers come in after me and receive their food before me. I went up and asked how much longer for my food because it's been about an hour and one of the workers told me it was coming right up. I saw my receipt, so I know my food was not given to the wrong people/forgotten/skipped. I finally got my food, and it was good, but not worth an hour wait, especially when you notice from people that came in after you were already half way through their meals. 

I wanted to speak to someone, and finally one of the workers asked me how my food was. I told her it was good, except for the amount of time I had to wait. I was glad to finally talk to someone who seemed to care about my misfortune, but whoops! Nevermind! Before I even got to elaborate or explain how long I was waiting and how others got their food in a fraction of the time, she was already running back towards to kitchen saying ""sorry for the wait."" Seriously? If you're going to ask someone about their experience, at least act like you care enough to listen to the whole thing.

Maybe I just came in on a bad day, but regardless, the service should be consistent. I would have appreciated someone taking the time to listen to me, or checking up on me while noticing I was waiting for awhile. Maybe that would give me a reason to come back, but since none of that happened, I don't know how I could ever want to come back.",zN_dg4ROyZESvaZkLSKSUQ,2,0,1,iAYLWW55dI7SfNgtdZ7VVg

Food: Light but portions are large enough to fill you up. Everything is downright delectable and just so refreshing to eat.

Atmosphere: Coupled with the delicious food, a comfortable dining area full of natural light also makes eating here more pleasant. There is ample outdoor seating as well for nice days. 

They bring their food to you! My favorites are the ham and brie sandwich and corn chowder. Their house salad dressing is delicious. Get the fresh juice!

Baguette Cafe may be a bit of a drive and a few dollars above my usual price point, but it's always worth it.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,6,2,5,0nbCkUyt13JOWi6Uj5GOig

With so many food and drink choices, it was difficult to choose. I went with the three cheese baguette with turkey and dark chocolate almond coffee with coconut milk. My friend had the chipotle chicken with bacon and black tea. Both our taste buds were very impressed. My dish was $15 his was $13.

Ambiance: small inside with a few tables but also nice outdoor patio area that is dog friendly. Small pastry display case. 

Location: in a plaza next to an industrial business park. Dead area on the weekends, but the restaurant was packed. Handy to come here after visiting IKEA.

Visited on Thursday 8-25-16 at 1PM.  I don't usually come to this part of town but I had went to IKEA and decided to stop by since I've had it bookmarked for 2 years now LOL 

$37.94 got me two sandwiches, two small salads, and a watermelon lemonade. I wanted to order a fresh juice (which is almost $7 by the way) but their machine was out of order. 

 I ordered my food to-go and sat on the filthiest couch I've ever seen and waited about 10 minutes.  My name was called and I looked up to see a dark handsome French man with my bag of food.   

$7.95 tuna sandwich-Menu says it has mixed greens, tomato, onion, tuna salad, and olives.  Mine was on delicious crusty and chewy french bread but the olives were missing.  The tuna salad was divine and tasted just like my mom's.  I'd love to try the tuna salad on a bed of lettuce...I bet it's amazing.  

$7 three cheese sandwich- a warm baguette with tomato-basil pesto, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  I bit into the sandwich and loved the bread and the cheese was tangy and warm.  I didn't notice the blue cheese on the menu and was shocked that I liked it because I don't like blue cheese. 

$6 crunchy green salad has mixed greens, jicama, carrot, celery, red onion, cucumber, and cilantro.  My opinion is this salad is overpriced.  It's very small and has no meat in it and jicama+cilantro+vinagrette is kinda gross.  I did not enjoy it.  It's the same size as the petite green salad which is only $4.50 and I don't see the difference in quality or quantity of ingredients.   

My favorite thing besides the tuna salad was the chocolate tart.  It was a generous slice and the ganache was smooth and rich.  The crust was light and delicate and the strawberries on top were a perfect pairing for the creamy dark chocolate.  

I don't think I'd go back.  I can get the same thing at Panera bread for about half the price and it's bigger, has more places to sit, and is much closer to my house.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,15,16,4,rrDgobFc-hmgNCLo6I3JjA

Curry chicken sandwich & 
The Chipotle

Curry seems to be the most popular but it's just so delicious! First timers, definitely get that one :0D.

The place is quaint so if it's busy there won't be much room to sit. However, they do have outside seating so that's a plus. It's inside the office complex so you have to do a bit of hide and seeking to find it. ;)",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,0,0,5,89OTFqAT9nKXLqvRwF4Bdw

When we walked in we were warmly greeted by the owner, Olivier. He was super nice and immediately asked if it was our first time. After we told him it was, he gave us a ""tour"" of the menu. We ordered a couple of sandwiches and he took the time to chat with us and learn our names. We sat down and chatted for a few minutes before they brought our food out. 

I got the chipotle which consisted of chicken, avocado, bacon, melty cheese, and a delicious chipotle sauce all on a warm baguette. It was stunning! It was served with a small salad with a fantastic house vinaigrette. My husband got the soup and sandwich combo. The shrimp bisque was surprisingly delicious and cheesy. It was served in a cute little mug with a side of croutons. My husband also got half of a Moroccan sandwich. This was a special sandwich which was not featured on the menu, but Olivier was nice enough to tell us about. It had chicken, three types of roasted peppers, creamy goat cheese, and a house made garlic aioli. We were both very happy with our decisions. 

We also tried some drinks, since it was a cafe. I had an iced chai tea and was very pleased. It definitely had a subtle flavor, but was exactly what I wanted. My husband got a blended Thai tea, which is such a fantastic idea! It was also very light and refreshing. We decided that we absolutely must try something from the dessert case before we left. Olivier explained that they make everything fresh daily and everything looked amazing. We settled on a slice of the pear tart. It was almost too pretty to eat! It had a very delicate flavor and wasn't too sweet. It was really the perfect treat after our meal. 

Overall, this place is fantastic. You get one of a kind service and delicious food for a fantastic price. Everything we tried only came to about $20, can't beat that in Vegas! They work hard to make everything fresh daily and actually get to know their customers. I am still stunned that a place like this actually exists in Las Vegas!

It's in a weird location, in the middle of medical buildings and stuff. Anyway..on to the food!

Cream of cauliflower soup - really smooth and yummy, but they garnished it with cilantro...yea I'm one of those people that thinks it tastes like soap. 

Chicken pesto sandwich - nothing special 

Roasted vegetable quiche - delicious! nice flaky crust 

Tuna sandwich - one of the best tuna salad sandwiches I've had! They put thin slices of hard boiled egg, which was a nice surprise. It's on a baguette bun that's nice and crispy. 

The staff is very friendly! The guy at the register jokingly read everyone's totals in francs and pesos, which could be seen as corny/lame, but you gotta give him credit for doing it through the entire lunch hour!

I will qualify that by saying I've never been to France.  They bake the stuff right behind the counter, and looks delicious when it comes out of the oven.  We got there, walked right up to the cashier and ordered, and then about 12 people walked in.  Good timing.

My rating is for the ham, cheese & egg croissant, and the Americano & cappuccino we had.  They're famous for their breads, and they don't disappoint with this dish.  While you can't get a whole lot of mileage with ham, cheese, & eggs, the bread makes this sandwich.  Crispy outside with tender & chewy inside, the croissant is scrumptious.  The coffee, while obviously high quality, isn't exactly to my taste.  I'm partial to the sweeter, caramel type beans such as Colombian, and I think theirs is more the Ethiopian type.  So this will be up to your preference, but if you like the more earthy African beans, this is a good choice.  Cappuccino is topped with perfectly frothed milk, which you don't find all the time.  4.5 stars for the sandwich, 4 for the coffee.

I plan on coming back to try some of the other breads.  I'm reserving .5 star for the return, at which point it may round up to a 5.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,1,1,4,4TdlYS6tDZqB5eS7gmlUXw

Atmosphere 4/5: Comfy chairs, they even have a sofa. The place is nice and looks new. It's not French touch but it's modern and different from other places! Quiet with some good music in background and you have the perfect mix for a good atmosphere. 
Food 5/5: I tried the Quiche Lorraine and the Bleu Brie Sandwich and it was awesome! I loved it! The Bleu Brie sandwich matched perfectly the taste of sweet (with the slices of apple) and sour ( with Bleu cheese)! Yes PERFECT!

Needless to say we didn't eat because of looking at the cars and talking to people. Finally got around to eating one with cheese about an 1 1/2 later and it was still amazing. Of course it would have been even better eating right away, but it was still soo good. This is a must return for us.",OwUwO6wdVSrUUUyXnVMYVg,0,0,5,yawm4Oq1nfO32oelMpr4cA

It's a small space but there's plenty of tables (and even a couch) inside, as well as a courtyard area with tables to sit outside. I guess the people who own this came from France, so the cafe is themed accordingly with a very quaint feel. Their menu is pretty expansive, offering breakfast, lunch (sandwiches), smoothies, and of course plenty of coffee and teas. I ordered the croissant and egg breakfast sandwich, and WOW I don't know what they put in it but it was phenomenal. I also ordered the mango smoothie to go with it, and that was delicious as well. The service was excellent too - you can tell it's a mom and pop kind of place, rather than your typical chain coffee shop like you see everywhere in Vegas. And even though the location is kind of hidden (they're located in a business plaza), they were busy the entire time we were there! My friend who brought me there also mentioned the few times she's been she's noticed the regulars are usually French, and speak French to the owners! Which I thought showed the cafe's authenticity.

5881689,2012-03-14,1,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"So this morning I was craving breakfast...really good breakfast...so I hit my yelp app to find out what is in my local area...hello Baguette Cafe! 

After reading about 10 or 15 raving reviews I decided I must venture across the street to find this hidden gem...and let me tell you, if you don't live on this side of town, it is TOTALLY worth the trip...

Olivier greeted me as he does every single person who walks through the door, asking my name & making me feel as though I had been there a million times before...and today was only my first time...I told him I heard about his place on yelp and he said ""we love that website, they have been so good to us""...he explained the menu to me and recommended that I return some time to have lunch (I most definitely will be returning) 

I had the Spinach/Swiss Omelet with Bacon & sun-dried tomato walnut pesto (of course with bacon because doesn't that make EVERYTHING just that much tastier??) on a croissant...it came with orange juice & my choice of tea, hot chocolate or coffee...since I'm not a coffee drinker (WHAT? I can hear the gasps now, but sadly yes, I've never acquired the taste for that wonderfully smelling bitterness that seems to keep my colleagues running) but just as an FYI - if you haven't read any other reviews - they serve ILLY coffee which apparently is pretty damn good coffee - but I digress - the croissant was so deliciously buttery and flaky & the omelet inside was absolutely perfect...after that amazing little breakfast sandwich I got up and looked at the freshly made tarts that were in the cabinet & he told me that he also had a lemon tart that he was getting ready to cut...and I couldn't help myself but take a slice of that also...let me tell you...if you like the sour of REAL lemon with just a dash of sweetness, this is heaven...and I'm not joking...the crust was flaky...the fresh creme that was put to the side, dusted with cocoa...blew my mind...my tastebuds were singing his praises...

There were 4 other people there when I first arrived but within 20 minutes there was a line out the door...to say this place is popular is an understatement...I only wish they were open later (7a-5p, M-F) and that they were open on the weekends...",lB_dUD37SnJnkHs5UB7yvQ,4,2,5,JpvahCIZKLy1oeqjs5maHQ

5902826,2017-04-10,2,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,"Baguette Cafe is always good. Always. Here's the lowdown:

THE GOOD:
+ customer service
+ quality ingredients
+ good portions
+ affordable prices
+ lots of vegan and vegetarian options 
+ the food

THE BAD:
- There is no bad. Please revert back to the first line of the review. 

Joking aside, this place is really, really good. If you want something light (as in smaller, not healthier), I recommend getting the Croissant and Egg. The croissants are always perfectly flaky, rich, and buttery.

If you want to try the quiche, get the Veggie Quiche. Ask anyone who works here, and they almost always prefer the veggie.

If you want to try a sandwich, get the Pesto with eggplant. Delicious sun dried tomato walnut pesto, avocado, mozzarella, and eggplant on their fantastically crusty baguette.

If you want something sweet, get the Chocolate Twist. 

And lastly, grab a cup of soup as a side, because they're always good (and almost always vegan or vegetarian!) You can even ask to Pick Two.

Overall, definitely recommend this place! ~",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,2,5,ePtteOP0G7ajTgY2bZI_mA

I ate a chipotle chicken grilled sandwich which came with a small side salad. I ordered a caramel latte with coconut milk as I cannot consume dairy.

Only a couple of people on the line, which was good. The cashier, which i think might be the owner was very nice and friendly, which was nice. I ordered an eggplant panini with chicken (no sauce). My boyfriend ordered the prosciutto salad.

My panini was great! The ingredients were super fresh. It came with a mini side salad which was yummy. My boyfriend's salad was also very good. The dressing was a little thick but the flavor was delicious. The meat, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, and dressing combo was great. Only thing is we don't really like pesto and there was a lot of it on the mozzarella cheese. We'll ask for no pesto next time. My boyfriend also got a peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie which he loved. 

A couple of things I didn't like - there wasn't too much seating inside, so we got stuck sitting outside and Vegas in the middle of the day outside isn't the most comfortable lunch setting. I couldn't fully enjoy my meal because I wanted to just get out of that sun asap!!  Another thing is, I wish they had more drink options!! But those things were not a big deal.
