I do recommend when ordering from this restaurant it definitely tastes better when you dine in as oppose to taking it home to eat...because the flavor and color can change once you get home. I rather dine in because the flavor of the food is just right. :)

As with the previous reviews written, the combo plates can be upgraded for $1 more if you wanted to add like BBQ pork in the rice...so I think that is reasonable.  Also, I don't think the cow mein is rubbery.  I think everyone has different taste buds.

Overall, You can't go wrong with fast food Chinese at an affordable price.  Definitely going back again!! :)",oc4pLl-0yBlgD6U9CDC0hw,0,0,4,9Luqloq7x62UTKgVdt2VNQ

1548080,2015-08-30,1,haa0u6VwTWBXbIW0mxlSGw,"Decent food but the absolute worst possible customer service.

We ordered Cashew Chicken and Broccoli Beef. We got the following:

One container of fried rice
One container of Cashew Chicken
Two containers of white rice.

Obviously someone in the kitchen accidentally mixed a container of white rice with our broccoli chicken. Mistakes happen.

When we called about the problem the rude man on the phone (who identified himself as the manager) declared it was impossible, that he had prepared the order himself and there was no possible way the order could be wrong. Strange, despite the impossibility the containers of food were still staring up at me.

And the ""manager"" continued that besides it was too far away to send someone out with more food to fix it.

WTF????

Guy got ruder and ruder until I blew a gasket and went on a two minute rant and then hung up. Mistakes happen, but to act like an axxhole that can do no wrong and treat the customer like they are idiots - there are far too many good places to get food in Las Vegas where they actually are concerned about taking care of the customer.

We ate the food - was decent for the price but not Earth shaking. Not worth the idiots and the horrid service, though.

I doubt I am too picky about Asian cuisine but:

Sweet and sour chicken (blue ribbon recommendation by gh) tasted like it was deep fried yesterday and served today not crispy or fresh.  Sweet and sour sauce was runny and watered down and with no good taste.  Poured it over the chicken and it was watery and got the chicken soggy.  

Lo mein with shrimp: poor quality shrimp, noodles covered with garlic that is all you taste.  

Beef with broccoli: sadly the only good one but beef quality was poor, overall taste not bad

Pork fried rice: bland and poor quality pork extremely greasy.

White rice: very dry and old.

Ten years ago, this place used to at least be tolerable, but any more I can't drive past it without sneering and saying, 'oh, yuk.'

The meat is low grade, no matter what kind.  The chicken is fatty, the beef is tough.  Anything fried tastes like oil and not like the food it's supposed to be.  Their sauces are so thick they're more like glazes, and the sugary ones will almost send you into a diabetic coma.

I usually order take-out from this place ($6 minimum order, $1.50 delivery charge), and they deliver it to my job on the UNLV campus. The delivery time is pretty random, sometimes taking 15 minutes, and other times taking 30-45 minutes, but it's worth the wait.

I have always ordered the All-Day Express Meal, which gives you either 1 Item ($4.15) or 2 items ($5.15), as well as a side of plain Fried Rice, and plain Lo Mein Noodles.

3573082,2013-05-09,2,haa0u6VwTWBXbIW0mxlSGw,"Writing reviews is not an easy feat. When it is a good experience and expectations or needs have been met, there is the tendency to give it an exceptional write-up as well. Am not one to skimp on writing or spending the money or giving it less the time and effort for anything in this world. If it means to do something right or good for the benefit of mankind's satisfaction, there is the compelling need to let it be known. Restaurants and food places have to meet a great deal from each person's hunger satisfaction as well as the purse strings that purchases the meal. 

Dined in this small restaurant next to a massage parlor in the shopping plaza at the corner of E. Flamingo and Algonquin Rd. in mid-April. Not many diners at that time. Menu is not extensive in choices. This restaurant skimped on authenticity of Chinese cuisine cooking, that is far from what one expects from Chinese cooking. For its cheapness in cost of a meal, it skimp or cut-back in ingredients! The noodles and fried rice were made of soy sauce and a little salt (maybe), devoid of the usual chopped vegetables and egg that comes with it. As you know it, the regular fried rice (or if it was for the combination meal) in almost every Chinese restaurant or in fast cooking or to-go Chinese restaurants as well, would make fried rice with the usual ingredients of chopped vegetables (i.e., carrots, peas, corn, or other type of vegetables are the staple to fried rice, isn't it?) and with eggs. Wouldn't you agree? How do you picture Fried Rice whether you know or not, or you are the Chinese cook? The usual idea and way of cooking fried rice is what anyone expects to be Fried Rice. The Curry Chicken tasted unlike curry with most likely the sauce itself came from a bottle of ready-made ""curry sauce"" or chili-curry blend. See photo (thanks to a diner who was gladly took a photo of it) and regard it with your eyes if having less of ingredients means to have such meal at a cheaper price of $4.99 is sufficient. Is it a great buy for a combination of 2 entrees with plain noodles, plain fried rice at $4.99? It was disappointing to eat through the meal despite the affordability. In all accounts, a meal well-made is satisfying irregardless of the price it is afforded to. Sad to say, as it is decent in price but skimp on ingredients! Would you pay for less of a meal that's presented in a cut-back of ingredients? Had to mention that upon questioning how the fried rice and noodles were made as plain as can be, the cashier or man behind the counter stated that to have the vegetables and fried strips of egg in the fried rice and/or the noodles, an extra dollar is the extra charge or cost to the meal, thus would cost $5.99 (cost un-taxed). Such a sinker! 

Expectation: the usual Oh what a decent price for a combination meal with fried rice! 
Upon receiving the meal: Two thumbs down! 
Rating: 2 Stars to 1 Star.

It's coming back slowly, coming from ChinaTown area you don't have to search heard for AWESOME take out.  You have more than enough choices, so looking through YELP as I often do, I came across China Joe's.  Now looking at the reviews I was kind of weary, but this is YELP and we all have different opinions, hence the end of all my reviews read the same ""but this is just MY opinion, try it out for yourself and see what you think""  (ok, well most of my review have that ending)

I always go for ""my USUAL"" when trying new places, if you cannot get USUAL correct, I don't want to try anything else in you restaurant. So my universal USUAL is orange chicken and chow mien/fried rice.  Very simple, no need to complicate the basic.

I ordered through YELP, you can set the time that you want to pick up your order. SUPER convenient. Now the 4star rating is solely based on food and service HOWEVER I would like to ass this little tidbit.  The PARKING LOT is very crowed, China Joe's is located right next to YamaSushi, so after a certain that parking stays PACKED and you may need to circle around a couple times before you actual find a parking space.  If you don't mind parking close to the bank, cvs or the far end of the parking lot (close to flamingo) then you good.  Me myself personally, I don't mind parking wherever, my legs work PERFECTLY!  ok enough about that

Dinner special is only like $10, very reasonable and you get a lot of food, enough to split with another, or take for lunch the next day.  And there's always daily specials posted right next to the register and that's a damn good deal too.  Last night I paid $8.11 for Honey Shrimp, Fried Rice and Egg Roll, ijs not too shabby and yep when I get home today I SMASHING THE LEFTOVERS but I digress...ORANGE CHICKEN

ORANGE CHICKEN
Decent pieces of chicken, not too big and not little chicken nibblets.  Its dressed in sauce, a little heavy but I like it that way, so that was a PLUS in my a book.  You can taste all 3 parts of the entree 1) chicken 2) breading 3) sauce and no one did not take over the other, it was well balanced.  Chicken super tender and moist, breading NOT soggy w/ a tiny crunch and sauce not sticky to where your teeth are not sticking together but SAUCED. Yum, yum, yummy...

FRIED RICE (combo w/ egg)
JUST RIGHT! not gummy, not overpowered with soy, FILLED with chicken and egg, every bite you either have rice and chicken or rice and egg, or a bit of all 3 chicken, rice and egg. No super greasy and NO you cannot taste the MSG. Lol

Since my 1st visit last year, this has become or GO-TO spot for chinese food.  I have also tried
- Shrimp Fried Rice (AWESOME, huge pieces of shrimp, and they give more than 3pcs, ahahahaa)

- Beef Broccoli (AWESOME, crunchy pieces of broc and tender pieces of beef, sauce ON POINT)

- Pad Sew (is that how you spell it? anyway, noodles aldente, even ratio of sauce-noodles-beef-veggies

I figured if I start to order the daily specials, I can hit the entire menu at a fraction of the price. Just a thought

No big GLITZ job as for decor, chairs and table and a soup bar.  It looks like a family owned place, last night when we were there, they had their younger sons/nephews angering phones, taking orders.  I was tempted to send my nephew back to work an hour or two.

   China Joe's in the Flamingo at Maryland Albertson's Shopping Center, is most likely a ""I've experienced it move on"" check-in. It was okay. 

    On my way to the Clark County Main Library, I was up to trying a new spot for a lunch special. It was time to give this China Joe's a try. When I looked at the lunch specials on the window, instantaneously I was decided on New York style chicken chow mein. 

   When I stepped inside, I entered a decent size restaurant with a take out environment. Nothing cozy or fancy.

   When I ordered at the counter, their was a slight language barrier when I ordered the lunch special New York style chicken chow mein. Finally I just said ""L-4."" With a fountain beverage, the lunch special came close to $9.

  Contrary to last Saturday's 2.5 star experience at the Rhodes Ranch China Go Go, the food did not arrive at my table in seconds. It took at least 15 minutes for the food to arrive. In a way, this is a good thing because it gives me some confidence that my food is being cooked from the time I place the order. But, where was the soup that is supposed to come with the soup?

  After the woman placed the tray with the  styrophone box, a spring roll, and fortune cookie on the table, I saw a couple of surprises. This did not look like New York style chicken chow mein. Oh hell no! New York Chinese Restaurant and China Garden is true New York style chow mein. The entrée in my opened styrophone box looked like chow fun with chicken. Oh well! I'd eat it with my taste buds in agreement that it was okay at best. The second surprise was that the fried rice that is supposed to be included was air. This is the first time that I ever dined in a Chinese restaurant where the entrée filled the dish (styrophone box here). In a strange way this is good because when the entrée covers the depth of the styrophone box, there is no filler. Then again, this is like going to an Italian restaurant and ordering veal parmigiano with pasta and getting a dish full of veal parmigiano. Ultimately, what happened to the soup that was supposed to have been included? I walked to the counter to ask the woman working here. She pointed to a table with self service soup. I am thinking to myself, ""wouldn't be the slightest bit helpful to the customer to know that they have to serve themselves the soup?""

   This China Joe's made 3 stars barely by a hair. And speaking of hair, there was none in my food. The dining area of the restaurant was clean. Cleaniness is the wildcard influencing the 3 star rating. 

  There are so so many restaurants to dine in and try in the Las Vegas valley. In my case, this China Joe's gives me an infinitesimal incentive to return.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,5,3,Cvy2_pA9Zk1XhXRYB9Bppg
4722723,2016-01-02,0,haa0u6VwTWBXbIW0mxlSGw,This place needs a whole new interior makeover. The food was pretty average as far as these mom and pop restaurants go.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  The proportions are massive so come here with an appetite or be prepared to bring home some leftovers.  I loved how it was cozy inside with only a few people.  Somebody recently opened up a new Chinese restaurant a block away so less people are eating here now.  Before that this Establishment used to be a lot more packed.  It's still the same great food but now without the long lines to wait in.

I called him back when I got back to the lobby and he said he already left and laughed when I asked why he left that message!

Beef or shrimp fried rice, mu shu pork, general's chicken, beef and broccoli, crab rangoon, BBQ spare ribs, and egg rolls are ALL good. Of course it's all about personal tastes. Some places fill general's chicken and their fried rice dishes with chunks of peppers or onions or pineapples, China Joe's just gives you meat and rice. :) The crab rangoon doesn't taste like crab, but that's okay, I get it for the cream cheese.
I used to go to China Joe's just because they were close to home. After I moved across town a few years ago I started trying new chinese places. Disappointed time and again. I never knew good chinese takeout was so hard to find. I go to a tiny mom and pop around the corner if I'm really needing a fried rice kick, but otherwise I call China Joe's to get my food ready whenever I'm on that side of town. And their service is always quick and polite. I love ""my guy"" there. Almost every time I call and pick up, it's the same nice guy at the counter.
