Our food was served hot, fresh, and quick.  We had a nice relaxing lunch and enjoyed our food.",of-Kuw-FAB59_b5YlUtGSQ,0,0,4,pXwmNu-BTnQoCC3lKTIQNg

We ended up getting that and some steak burrito, which I didn't care for. But the lobster burrito was delicious with lot's of great flavor and more lobster chunks than I had expected.

(Don't you hate when you forget to review after going to the place and then when you actually have time to write the review, you forget half the information?? Darn.)",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,1,2,3,tLEOgTw03m2sKFQUVQpLXg

I spontaneously came here with my Mother and surprisingly.. she hasn't had any fresh Mexican food neither have I in a long time. So we were both in for a treat :)

It was around 5p.m. and we were kindly greeted by the general manager, that was also my cashier. It was nice to see he was hands on than a GM that just sits in the back office all day. Jose Garcia took our food orders and I forgot to get a drink, which he was more than happy to accommodate. He gave me a refillable plastic ""to go"" cup, which anybody can bring in any time to refill for .99 cents forever! So it says on the cup :D How nice!!! I love tea and they had four varieties to choose from... all you have to do is push the button of the one you want to drink and it pours out. I loved their sweetened Green Tea and Nestea Raspberry Iced Tea has always been one of my favorites.

We headed straight to their famous fresh Salsa bar... which had six different kinds to choose from. My Mother picked both Hot Salsa sauces and I picked the famous green sauce.. Salsa Verde Medium and the Salsa Mango Mild with tons of cilantro added to it. I loved the Mango Salsa the most out of all and I went back a few times to get it refilled. Chunks of freshly diced mango, red pepper, and jalapeno. You can tell it was made that day and it definitely had some heat to it, but it sure made everything taste refreshing and good. My mother enjoyed both Hot salsa sauces and the Mango salsa. Word of caution.. once you taste the sweetness of the mango, it made the salsa verde green sauce taste bitter. 

We ordered one Baja Chicken and Steak Burrito. It also came with a side of tasty golden torito chips, which had a nice crunch and ate all of them at the very end with my mango salsa!!! Delicious! The Steak burrito was hearty and filling. The handmade guacamole, melted jack cheese and Pico de Gallo made the burrito come alive. The Chicken Burrito was delicious and tasted better with the mango salsa. Both tasted so healthy... it was guilt-free to enjoy. 

My mother loved these burritos so much she asked me the very next week to eat there, but this time we took my father and they happened to be closed!!! It was 9:30p.m. and they were cleaning up. Now I know.. Baja Fresh closes at 9p.m. even in Las Vegas! My mother was so bummed and goes.. those are some good burritos.. where are we going to go now??!? :(  

Service was great and the salsa station was always refilled whenever anything looked half gone. Even saw the GM change a light bulb by the drink station as soon as he noticed it. He greeted every single person that walked through the door and asked how they were doing. Even some by name! He also came around to each table and asked how everything was. Very hands on and that is impressive. He was cleaning all around the place, taking orders, and answering the phone for takeout orders. He showed a great example of how to be a role model that people can admire and learn from. David Kim would be so proud!",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,6,1,5,n487IFWZfMMoFrSeL1361A
4664106,2011-07-02,0,QTH_XGh4rWYdd0fTW-tUDw,The last two times I've been to this place the food was absolute garbage.  Onions are always rancid and the tomatoes were green.  At one point they were out of coke and salsa.  Had to get my $ back and leave.  Maybe one of these days they'll get their chit together and put out a good product.  Same experiences at the Sahara/Decatur one.  The only one that had been consistent was Charleston and Ft. Apache.,XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,0,0,2,1Dtmv6__LQ3QTQfapYZQ5g
4888992,2007-02-23,0,QTH_XGh4rWYdd0fTW-tUDw,i'm impatient. so i should have called in my order. they took a while to get my ultimo burrito done. not enough meat. too many bell peppers. next time i'll get the baja burrito. chips were really oily. like it was from the bottom of the frying basket. usually its just a couple.. but they were all like that. service was bad. the cashier greeted everyone with an 'you ready?' .. which isnt really a greeting.. and when you werent ready he kinda shifted his weight to his other side and his head followed his body. like he was being scolded.. and wasnt listening. anyway.. i'll try again and hopefully add another star.,SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,0,0,3,Q07mTu9mcJ2zJK5m1w6jEQ
