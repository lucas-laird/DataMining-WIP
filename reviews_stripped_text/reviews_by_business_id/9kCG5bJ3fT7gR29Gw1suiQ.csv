The price they listed on the menu is not what you paid.  They add $1 or $2 more on each item we ordered and our total bill came out $20 more.  It is illegal and dishonest to run a business like that.
If you are in Vegas and want to eat good VN food, try PHo Hue Thai.  Their prices are reasonable and the food was very good.  And also, very nice waiter and waitress.",frhEueJg7Lo3Ih3WLU8wCA,0,0,1,ZdLjyC098oVB-oj8DEG6Ng

Actually, it was more like a triple bogey on all 18 holes. The BBQ pork had a weird taste to it as if the meat was old. The bread sucked also. What a waste of money. I do not know about coming back here.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,1,1,1,kEA4gk-04oAqRbMeS4Litg

The bread used to be really good and very large.  Now its hard, crusty, stale, and almost half the size.  I've been back twice to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  Also, I used to love all the fresh veg they use here but on my last sandwich there was like a teaspoon of carrots.  I've posted photos of both the old award winning banh mi and the new ass-sucking one.  You decide.

Since the banh mi were the only good thing they served, I have no reason to go here anymore.  

Until I find some place better, Hue Thai has the best banh mi sandwiches I know of in LV.",ybcBGlRG0qYHI9DbXjfznA,5,4,1,TmMN72K5UR9tHt9QBVilgg

We only discover Vietnames places when my boyfriend's Vietnamese mom is in town. We've probably passed by Pho Nhu Y on Spring Mountain a thousand times. We always go to neighboring Ichiza, Zizzy's, and Z2, but have never popped in to Nhu Y. 

We popped in a couple days ago for pho, but they have a okazuya (I don't know what the Viet equivalent would be) type set up where you can order take out. 

I always like pho, but my bf, the pho connoisseur likes Pho Saigon 8's broth the best. He said Nhu Y's is decent. 

But for take out, we ordered -- and I don't know the names of anything, pardon -- some mackerel-looking fish in a black bean sauce and these huge prawns in an orange sauce that I was told is saffron based. Now, I've never had saffron, so I can't argue yay or nay that it was real saffron ... but those prawns were damn good. I was just snacking at home, eatting rice and drizzling the orange sauce over it. That was awesome good. Then I ate one of the prawns. Those things were larger than my palm. They didn't feel fresh, but it was all about that friggin' awesome orange sauce. The prawns were $4 per, but worth it. 

They have a little market where you can buy Viet and Chinese confections, including gin dui (Chinese mochi), which I am definitely going back for. They also sell Viet beef jerky and sauces and crackers and stuff. 

The prices were reasonable. You could buy French-style Viet sammiches for like $2.50. 

The service ... is Asian service. Kind of curt and to the point.

This places specializes in quick take out food, with a steam table of rice and other Vietnamese deli foods to make assorted Com dishes.
There are also a few shelves of desserts and deli/convenience foods.  

But it has about 6 tables to sit and eat, and you can watch the TV with a DVD playing over and over again the traditional Vietnamese outfit contest portion of the Miss Universe Pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam,

They have a decent smattering of Vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm, but the food is pretty good. Khai Vi, Pho Bo (about 17 combos) Hu Tieu, Mi Xao, Com Dia, Che, and special dishes like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu,  Banh Cuon, Goi Du Du, Nem Nuong Cuon, etc. 

They also have Boba drinks, coffees, etc.

Don't expect great service. 

The Pho Tai Bo Vien and Pho Tai came in quite large bowls, with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls. There was also a lot of noodles, more than most places. Only $4.99, good price even for San Jose or Little Saigon. 

If you want quick to go Viet food, or a cheap and large bowl of Pho in Las Vegas, try here. It is in a 2 story strip mall just below Korean Garden BBQ.

The place is totally remodeled so it really looks like a restaurant and not a mini-mart but it still has the steam table for hot foods. It appears they might have been taken over by the folks at Mr. Sandwich since that's what it said on the menu the lady handed to me. I ordered 2 Bahn Mi, one was the house special and the BBQ Beef. Both were very good but the bread was not as crusty as they once were, they seemed more buttery and soft unlike a real baguette plus less meat than before. Still a good value at about $4 a piece but its no longer my favorite place for a BBQ Beef Bahn Mi.",T_RiQ-TOeZf8N2kiCNCiSg,1,1,3,zTzUWSzqygD8OJHTFsQcIw

It's located below a Korean BBQ place and next to an AYCE sushi place so it's very easy to overlook. We all decided to order bun thit nuong cha gio. I enjoyed my meal and the server was very attentive. Come to think of it, this is the most I've ever tipped at a Pho restaurant. I'll try the banh mi next time I'm in town.",_I5VlmDdCafD24xLi0FsxA,0,0,3,W8vlbc4hEV14hG-2mGaTPw
