When I opened it up I was appalled.  Every other piece of carne asada was fat.  I could not eat one bite.  Huge waste of money and time.,yctYv9E1rK6AYTx1FHU3gw,1,0,1,GG4LzEIuf-WSQVp6bNjCcA

If you ever have Veronica as your cashier you can expect your order to be wrong . I have had to return my food more then twice because they don't bother to communicate with themselves and they have an attitude for asked to get what you orders in the first place. I often see people returning the good and being upset because they always get the orders wrong. 

The cashier Veronica has the worst attitude while working and you can expect her to role her eyes at you or even ignore the fact you are in front of her trying to order. She will take your order when she is finally ready.

700263,2012-11-29,0,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"I went to Pepe's Taco last night.  I had an interesting experience.  I ordered the Asada Fries which was different from what I usually had in the past.  I typically get my fries from Robertos.  Pepe's Taco makes their fries fatter and thicker which were a nicer difference.  They also put nacho cheese over their fries, sour cream, guacamole, and of course the asada.  I think I like the ones from Robertos better because the meat is thicker and I like the salsa that they add on it.  I ordered my food to go and it did take a bit but I think it is because there were quite a few people before me.

They have a wide variety of meat options such as goat as well as the typical asada, chicken and ect.  They do have lunch specials but those are offered from Sun- Thur from 12-4. 

Inside they have a jukebox which is really cool because I have never seen one in real life.  They play Mexican music which is understandable because it is a Mexican Restaurant.   

I do like that I can see the workers cooking their food.  I was able to watch them prepare my food and watch them cooking limes.  I think they were a bit creeped out because I was just watching them.  Pepe's Taco does have a nice salsa bar which has green salsa, red salsa, some carrots and onions, and I think they were radishes.  I felt my Asada Fries were decent, but next time I will go to get some tacos.  They are called Pepe's Tacos afterall.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,0,0,3,C3HtIIrMDBTdc93emmsKOA

So my boyfriend & i get to pepes & we order 2 carne asada tacos, a side of sour cream, & a small water cup. The girl who took our order never gave me the side of sour cream nor the water cup ...i had to go back up there & get both. when our tacos came out they were a little cold but still really good. (thats for the 1 star). So when we were finished eating our tacos &  were about to leave i decided to use the restroom...when i walked over to the womens restroom door there was a women employee standing in the door looking around in the bathroom curiously ,So i said ""Hi, may i use the restroom?"" & she says back to me ""Are you smoking in this bathroom?"" i said to her ""What? No i havent even used the restroom yet im just Asking you if i can use it?"" So shes like ""ohhh.....umm....ok i guess"" and walks away. At this point im just thinking that maybe shes mistaking me for someone else? & the bathroom didnt smell like smoke or look like there was any smoke in there at all? it was just weird. So i used the restroom & when i came out, there were 3 employee girls standing around the door so i was like cornered...& the one fat girl with the braces says to me ""The bathroom is for customers only, you need to leave rightnow!"" i explained to her that I AM A CUSTOMER & that i was JUST EATING not even 2 minutes ago & that i didnt understand where all this weird judgement was coming from? She just kept on saying ""You need to leave rightnow!, you cannot smoke in the bathroom."" So i began to leave because i was so embarrassed & confused & i hurd the girl say to the other girl in spanish ""Stupid druggies think we dont know whats going on. That bitch just lies"" & i turned around & said ""excuse me? Just because im white doesnt mean i cant understand/speak your spanish.

862930,2012-12-07,1,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"My son and I were so excited when we saw the Pepe's was taking over the old Baja Fresh place. I was excited because I had heard from a coworker that they have an incredible carne asada burrito. My son was excited because he's a 16 y/o boy and two things excite him, food being one of them. Every time we came around the corner and saw the progress that was being made we giggled like school girls.

So it opened and we went and we were not all that impressed. I got the burrito and it was as good as advertised. My wife got the shredded beef tacos which honestly are the best we've had in Las Vegas. My son's food was only okay.

The place is just kinda dingy. And that was after being open for just one day. The people at the counter were not very friendly and never smiled. There wasn't a clean table to be found. And the unsmiling, unfriendly worker became more unsmiling and unfriendly when we asked if someone could wipe a table down for us.

I went a couple of days later to get a chorizo and eggs burrito...... I do love burritos! The girl tells me that will be $7. ""For a chorizo and egg burrito?"" I ask. She points to the menu and it's a full on meal with rice and beans. I ask what the price is without rice and beans and she tells me it's the same. Come on now!

The salsa cups are way too small and the red and the green sauce runs all over your fingers and drips back in to the vat. Now I keep my hands impeccably clean. Julia Childs would be so proud of me. But I don't know which person before me was picking their nose or had left the bathroom unwashed. I'm not really a germaphobe, but seriously!

I'll go back for the burrito or the shredded beef, but I'll use the red sauce I took from Fausto's

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with a drink, and my husband ordered a bean and carne asada burrito. He asked for cheese and salsa but the woman taking the order must not have heard what he said because when he started muching on his burrito it DIDNT have cheese or salsa.

DRINK: They have a soda fountain, Mexican bottled sodas, fresh Jamaica and Horchata, and fresh squeeze orange juice. The orange juice is delicious. For the fountain drinks, they say that if you share your drink, they will charge extra.

FOOD: Ordered a bunch of tacos and the super nachos. The tacos were dry and bland. It tasted like it was just random stuff tossed onto tortillas. The nachos had a really big portion for the price. It didn't taste good though. I got my nachos with carne asada and it had to be the worst carne asada I have ever had. It is a staple hispanic meat and they messed it up. The chips were all soggy because they put waaaaay too much cheese on it. I love cheese, but this was unsettling.

ATMOSPHERE: The staff is always super irritated and makes their customers uncomfortable. The restaurant is really dirty with food stains and crumbs everywhere. I like that the restaurant is spacious and bright inside though.

1069847,2017-07-11,1,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,I feel ripped off. I blindly ordered a carne asada burrito and I paid close to $10 no drink. I sat down feeling like I over paid trying to figure out why it was so much for a regular taco joint burrito. Since this place is on Rainbow maybe it's unicorn meat I thought but nope. The burrito is good however not $10 good. I will never go to this place again just because it's over priced.,1D22op5wRnaSMD1RHRP0Fw,0,0,1,1d6a_vmTaHjhX9FGrOx_Pg

The hours are the same like the other locations open 24 hours. Now having it literally so close too my house like taco heaven on earth. LOL! The tacos authentic as can be nothing americanize about them. True taco no cheese in it or taco shell by the bunch. True taco is two tortilla heated up with protein choose with onions, and cilantro. The choices of protein choose from not just your basic usually get the lingua (tongue) but friend (god bless him for introducing me too Pepe) said next time try the buche (pig stomach). I tried the buche was really good. It different texture then lingua are carne asada. Like it. Never had it always like too try new foods in life. The salsa bar has all your normal fixing choose from diced white onions, pickled carrots and jalapeno, fresh cilantro, and both salsa red and green. I am HUGE fan of the red salsa prefect compliment with your tacos no matter what you order. It not hot hot but just right kick too it. Tacos they come with refried beans I love taste fresh made everyday and chips perfect way scoop up beans or leftovers from the tacos!

Since it brand new. It refreshing compare too the normal spot go too because its the complete opposite. New everything looks part, the signs, mexican artwork decorate some of the walls, neon signs, and it look great. It bigger then the other one been too. So not have too worried about finding spot too sit. Maybe cause it was new the place was packed. The only negative was they not serving there three or four tacos specials with drink. Is something they known for at all other locations and the three taco special use too getting. Still even regular its very reasonable priced for under ten dollars.

Come to Los Angeles and go to King Taco. They'll show you how it's done and what a legit ""street taco"" should taste like.

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and both of them had fat all over the meat. A proper carne asada taco should have nothing but tender juicy meat that is EDIBLE. I had to spit out half the meat that were in my tacos. Perhaps I caught them on a bad night but it is not likely I will be returning to this place. ""Best Tacos in Las Vegas 2010"" my a**. Whoever was a food critic for this place should be fired.

Honestly, Tacos Mexico (they have multiple locations in this city; ie. Tropicana or the street close by Stratosphere Hotel) is wayy better than this place. With Tacos Mexico, I've been here 10+ times and all 10+ times everything was satisfying.

The only reason why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the carne asada fries. They put nacho cheese all over the fries...a good addition in my opinion.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,4,2,2,imXmfKQy7sJKOxmSD_AUQQ

2741705,2013-06-26,9,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"If Yelp had an evil twin equivalent of the ROTD (Review Of The Day), this would win hands down. To the reader, I am not taking responsibility for your well being if you still choose to eat here especially after reading this review.

Let's start from the beginning. I bring my wife and two boys. I order 4 pastor tacos for me and my oldest. A cheese quesadilla for my youngest, and an order of asada fries for all of us to share.

So the food comes out. It all looks good. But looks can be deceiving. You know when people say don't judge a good book by its cover. Well this cover looks good but once you read the first page, it will make you want to rip it in half and burn it.

For starters, the pastor was dry like it has been on the spit for days. That's really funny because there was oil literally pouring out of the tortilla when I pick it up. My guess is that they dipped it in hot oil before throwing it in the tortilla. I should of took pictures of the plate it was on because it was literally transparent from all the grease.

The quesadilla should of been called a ""greasadilla"". My youngest only took a couple bites before he had to stop because of grease running down his chin and fore arms. The tortilla itself was already soggy. 

As for the asada fries I was hoping that would be the saving grace to this horrible experience so far. I was wrong. Boy was I wrong. I took a picture of it and posted it on here. It looks decent. But when we started eating it, we noticed they had used nacho cheese instead of shredded cheddar. For nachos that might be ok. But for fries that's a major no no. The meat was also greasy like they dipped it in oil to bring it to life. The only decent things about it was the sour cream and guacamole.

We ate or should I say tried to eat at least half of our food but it seemed like with every bite our stomachs were screaming bloody murder. But alas, we had to dump it in the trash. 

So in closing, memo to ""Pepe"", can you please cut down on the grease and at least make the tacos just a tad bit bigger? Once you do that, then maybe I will give you guys another try.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,13,9,1,z1p1x-qcKpoVBTeZ4B8msw

2865905,2016-12-21,7,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"First time at this Pepe's, but I've visited the Boulder Highway location before.

I stopped in for a carnitas taco ($2.25).  It wasn't the crispy type of carnitas I like, but it was still pretty dang tasty.  The little pieces of pork were soft and succulent.   The taco had two tortillas, a lot of meat and nothing else (I ordered it with no onions).  You can, of course, doctor it up with salsa and cilantro from the salsa bar if you wish.

Bathrooms are for customers only and they are kept locked.  If you need to use them, you are required to tag the bathroom with your gang sign.  They are serious about this policy.  They won't even give you the key unless you have a marker or paint pen.  If you don't have a gang, they have a sign up sheet.  Once you are all signed up and jumped in, you just show them your markers, and they'll give you the key to the bathroom.

You can, obviously, tag anywhere, but at Pepe's people mostly like to tag the back of the bathroom door or the toilet seat.  Any fool can tag the door, and they all do.  The real artists here are the guys that tag the toilet seats.  They don't even use markers.  They painstakingly carve their signs right into the plastic.  Can you imagine the dedication of these bright young artists?  Quite impressive!

I was here a few months ago but drunk out of my mind and I couldn't have written my Yelp-worthy review based on my tipsy experience. I decided to stop by the other day and I guess you have to be drunk to really appreciate this place.

Located off Flamingo and Rainbow, Pepe's is a 24 hour taco/Mexican fast food spot in the same vein as Robertos. They have about 6 or 7 different types of meat for their tacos along with plenty of burritos, combo plates, and other standard Mexican offerings.

The tacos were small and at about two bucks a pop definitely not worth it. They only use one small corn tortilla so everything gets soggy and falls out on the plate. =( booo! The carne asada was lacking in flavor and a little dry, likewise the chorizo was nothing memorable. The salsa bar was a disaster when we came in. The two watery sauces they had were splashed all over the place added little flavor to the tacos. 

What really disappointed me about Pepe's were their stupid policies. 50 cents charge for using a credit card, 30 minute limit for eating-in and they even had the nerve to post  sign on the soda fountain about extra charges if you are caught sharing a drink. All these rules and fees make eating their mediocre food more of a hassle than it should be.

If you are looking for an authentic tacos hit up Tacos El Gordo, better tacos, cheaper prices, no stupid rules.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,10,1,2,S67QSG1ukj78_czIn_ECtQ

However, because I am gluten free and pescatarian I left very unsatisfied with the food itself. The customer service was on plaint and she knew exactly what to suggest when I mentioned I don't eat meat or gluten. The cashier suggested that I make breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs, beans and cheese. She mentioned that she wouldn't be able to make them but she could give me the ingredients to do so. The eggs came out cold and the corn tortillas were thick and steamed which didn't make a good taco. All in all, cold and bland with a soggy tortilla was a disappointment. They were also cleaning out the Horchaga at the time so that was a bummer as well, but I can't fault them for that.",9SiaKMfoX7hsWxqNd-CKaw,0,0,3,vRWboqjxDNw7rtkS3mEtWg

Tacos I appreciated. I liked the shells. Flavor was fine but not amazing. Many chunks of meat were very big and much of the meat was as tough as beef jerky. Maybe it was the time I got there. Around 11 pm. May have simmered all day and lost its tenderness. 

The burrito was filled with everything. Good size. $8 and dry rice. But the chicken was perfect.

3923105,2013-05-29,0,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"A coworker and I had to run some errands in the adjacent strip mall so figured we'd stop by Pepe's for lunch. Unfortunately, that was a huge mistake.

We got the chicken quesadilla combo and a carne asada burrito. First off, ""combo"" just means a drink is supposed to be included; it doesn't come with rice or beans or sides. Worse yet, the quesadilla managed to be both bland and really, really greasy, which seems like a cardinal sin. The burrito was also lousy - it was more like really dry ground beef than carne asada. It was small, too, making the value proposition quite suspect.

And there's a reason I said that the combo means a drink is ""supposed"" to be included; after I got my CC receipt, I noticed they'd charged us for an extra drink. The same lady who processed my order refused to credit the CC and wanted to pay me back in cash instead, but when she gave me cash she only gave me back the menu price of the drink (without the sales tax, which they charged). I had to talk to another person to get them to understand that they also owed me the sales tax.

I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't a mistake, since I never asked for a drink in the first place (since it was supposed to have been included in my combo); they just arbitrarily charged me for one. Also, not a single person apologized during this whole interaction.

Finally, they charge $.50 to use a CC. Bad value proposition, lousy food, shady cashiers, and still nickel+diming us on top of all that? No thanks.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,4,0,1,LaPRQ8ho7o5EaW-PonS1wg

The fries had cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese.  I like a combination of both.  Chicken taquitos were the best part of the meal and that's not saying much.

First they got the order wrong and tried to insist we accept the rolled tacos they made instead of the crispy shredded beef tacos we ordered. Why make it awkward for us having to insist we get what we ordered? (and yes, it was correct on the receipt).  
So I started eating my food while my hubby waited for his correct order. No problem. As we're waiting we overhear another patron talking to an employee about his shredded beef being hard and inedible. When my husband finally received his order it was the same. Sooo dry it seemed like beef jerky. It looked horrible, I don't even understand how they could serve this to people with a strait face. My hubby will eat just about anything and not complain but this was just plain gross.

You can find Pepe's Tacos located in the same plaza as La Bonita and Lee's Liquor on Rainbow. This building is pretty big and is and very clean. 

We ordered tacos: asada, carnitas, al pastor, and a chicken quesadilla. Along with that I ordered the fresh mixed juice (carrots and orange).

The asada meat was a little on the dry side, yet somewhat greasy... does that even make sense? The carnitas and al pastor were decent. At least they weren't dry, but I was hungry so I downed it. The chicken quesadilla wasn't enjoyable at all... ended up boxing it up with a few bites. The only thing I really enjoyed was the mixed juice.

4500603,2017-01-16,0,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR RECEIPT AFTER PAYING FOR PHANTOM CHARGES.  I went here with a couple of friends at about 5 AM (we're not drunks, we just all work night shifts), and ordered about $45 worth of food.  This apparently wasn't enough of our money for the woman behind the cashier, as she asked if we wanted drinks and we politely answered no, and that just water cups would be fine.  She even asked for clarification on if we wanted bottled water or water cups and we SPECIFICALLY stated that we just wanted water cups.  

The cashier then proceeds to charge us $6.87 extra for three medium drinks (we were unable to see an itemized menu from our end before paying).  When our total came out to $50.73 it raised a couple of eye brows, but the cashier held firm that that was our total for the food that we had ordered.  AFTER giving us our total, and after she saw that we were noticeably perplexed towards it being so expensive, she then proceeds to pull out three ""soda"" cups for us, which we just assumed was a gesture of good will for us spending over $50 at their establishment, especially since we had -specifically stated- and clarified that we did -not- want drinks, and that we only wanted water cups.  

We went and filled up our drinks that the generous cashier had just given us, then sat down.  That's when I checked my receipt and noticed the upcharge.  I politely approached the woman behind the cashier to inform her that we had been wrongfully overcharged, she then proceeds to tell us that since we had already filled the cups up that she was unable to refund us our money.  She admitted that it was her ""mistake"" by giving us three drinks that we hadn't ordered, AND she admitted that she COULD refund us our money, but apparently only had we not filled the cups up with anything.  

This is essentially petty theft what the cashier is pulling here, and it's a despicable and dastardly way to run a business.  I can't count how many people I've turned onto Pepe's or how many times I've been there; but the shady business of operations they've got going on at this location is extremely disappointing.  

Oh and if you want to look out for the shady cashier, I didn't catch her name unfortunately as she was not wearing a name tag, but she was a lighter skinned but Hispanic woman with dark hair.  She looked to be in her mid 30's, with a little extra to love but not obese by any means; and probably about 5'7"" in height. Shame on you Pepe's.

The quality of the snack, however, is mediocre. The tacos aren't huge, but they also aren't expensive. However, they are constructed with one corn tortilla, which falls victim to dreaded soggy taco whereby the contents of the taco escape onto your plate. Spoon is required. The flavor of the taco is ok, but not amazing, and unfortunately, the salsa bar was a total wreck when we visited. I wasn't inspired to douse up the taco. The spot is big, so there is plenty of room for sitting, and the service was kind and quick. For what Pepe's is, it is ok, but if I am not in a hurry or have other options that are open, it wouldn't be my first stop.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,16,3,rI5o3tec_D2jIyk4mPN-dA

5322418,2013-09-10,1,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"Sister and I were hungry at 10 PM on a Sunday night and were looking for some Mexican delight. Pepe's Tacos had recently opened up near our house and we decided to get down.

I ordered three tacos: carne asada, lengua, and al pastor. The lengua and the carne asada were decent. Not horrible, but not stand out. The star of my taco trio was the al pastor. The marinated pork, cilantro, onion, a squeeze of lime, a touch of the hot sauce. AMAZING! Definitely a must try. 

My sister got the Machacha Plate which came with beans, rice, and warm tortillas. The machacha itself was pretty bland, nothing really lively or exciting about it. Didn't really pack much of a punch. The rice and beans were okay as well.

Pepe's is open 24 hours and has a wide variety of offerings that are all cooked to order. They have a traditional taco salsa bar, with the red hot spicy sauce of death (which I love) and a green, mild salsa. The carrot, onion, jalapeno mix. Radishes. 

This location was clean, brightly lit. The staff was friendly. Pepe's is a decent taco shop. A step up from Roberto's, but not a home run.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,2,4,2,s1iKwlX4uPYC1H5dvICz3Q

5529321,2012-12-07,12,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"It was late, I was starving and this is the closest taco shop to my house so I decided to give it a go.  The thing that got me most excited prearrival was that they offered al pastor 24/7.  Not much can beat great al pastor and I have yet to find anything that tops my beloved (and closed down) Tacos Los Parados al pastor, so I had high hopes.  

Those hopes dashed away as soon as I was at the counter and saw the pastor spinning on the spit.  It was as if it had been on there for a couple of days.  I then realized how difficult it must be to maintain quality pastor around the clock.  This is why there aren't any 24 hour shawarma joints.  Yet I was in denial and ordered 2 pastor tacos and 2 chicken tacos for $1.79 a piece to go.  

10 minutes later, all 4 tacos were crammed into a foil package the size of a PB&J sandwich.  I was surprised at how small it all was that I asked the cashier ""Is this everything?"".  I get home and realized that I had just ordered the smallest tacos in the world.  

I read an article a while back that the current (maybe not by the time you read this) New York Jets coach, Rex Ryan, would eat 12 tacos for dinner before he had gastric bypass.  He certainly wasn't eating these babies.  The chicken was fine and as I had expected, the pastor was dry.  Perhaps I need to go during peak hours when it's fresh?

Roberto's is definitely their main competitor and in the cheap and ghetto Vegas taco game, Roberto wins.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,14,7,2,0StKg3lxfF91uQ1f10YTtA

I remember the other charleston location being worth the drive across town, but this new one kind of sucks. Super nachos were crap compared to what I've become used to from similar places like Roberto's. This was a little bit of chips w velveeta and chopped up chicken, not fall apart tender chicken tinga like you usually get. 

Getting drinks near the general area of the bathroom reeks of sewage. Positives are good horchata and really great refried beans. That's about it - I'll stick to my tried and true Roberto's",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,2,12VuY1vTq8BhDSVKLuThCg

5830856,2015-05-26,0,XDYCIRENiT2doRZgwNJ3SA,"This was my fist and last time going. What was wrong with this place.... way too much! First of all its $11.00 for 6 rolled tacos. You can get 5 for $5.00 at so many other better places and this didnt even include cheese. Thats an extra 1.50. So it $12.50 for 6 rolled tacos. When i talked to the manager about it, everyone spoke Spanish in front of me to delegate the situation. Granted I know Spanish and am Latina myself, this is America! Speak English!!!! Not only is this rude to customers who cant speak spanish but its horrible business practices. After refusing me a refund even though no one told me the stupid rolled tacos didnt come with cheese (who does that! Rolled tacos always come with cheese and guac!) she asked the cheese to be put on the tacos and walked away. Other things wrong with my service:

 - Tacos were overpriced. $2.50 for a mini taco. You pay that price for a full sized taco at other locations
- Cheese quesadilla overpriced. $4.50 for a plain quesadilla that can buy you a beefed up quesadilla elsewhere. 
- There was half of a broken toothpick in my rolled tacos.
- The meat in the rolled tacos was fried to exessively making the it hard and jerky like. 

 I did go into this place expecting something great considering it seems so popular but im not wasting another penny on this dump and neither should you.

I paid $23.00 for two burritos, added guacamole for $1.25 each and opted for take out.

When we drove a short distance home to sit and eat I realized my burrito had no guacamole in it I was let down. 

If you are going to charge me for guacamole then I expect their to be more than a teaspoon in my burrito.

I called Pepe's to voice my complaint, the girl answered and spoke in Spanish. I asked if anyone was available to speak in English to assist me. 

She said yes is me and proceeded in English. I asked her name and she replied ""what you need?"" I again asked for her name she again replied the same what you need?  

I explained my issue and she asked for my receipt number and said hold on, she came back on the line and said my Kitchen Manager Hector said he put guacamole on your burrito.

I ordered the carne asada gordita and it was ok but the gordita was really doughy and not as crisp as I would have liked. My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing. We also tried a taco al pastor just to check it out and it was dry and not flavorful at all. Definitely a lackluster experience and I don't think I'll be back.
