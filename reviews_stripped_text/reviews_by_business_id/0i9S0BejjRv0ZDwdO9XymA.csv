Really enjoyed the service and food. My husband and I got spoiled at this place.

1637649,2017-04-20,0,0i9S0BejjRv0ZDwdO9XymA,"Today was my third time at Thai Seafood Ginger.  Obviously I liked it enough to return.  The first time we ordered delivery online.  The last two visits have been for lunch.  The lunch specials are a great deal.  For $9 you get your choice of a handful of entrees that come with a small side salad and choice of appetizer (either vegetable eggrolls, crab rangoon, or fried dumplings). I recommend the rangoon, as good as I have had. I've had the seafood combo drunken noodles, seafood combo pad see ew, and chicken pad see ew.  They were all very good, and good sized portions for the price.  The lunch specials are a smaller portion, but still plenty of food.  

A couple pieces of advice.  The seafood combo is all seafood as opposed to the chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp combo I was expecting.  It was good, but know that you are getting shrimp, scallops, mussels, octopus, etc.  

Finally, they offer you the choice of mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot.  Realistically, your choices are bland or melt your face.  Mild has not spice.  Medium is somewhere between boiling water and molten lava. Hot is similar to the surface of the sun.  I can only imagine Thai hot resembles the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark when they open the Ark.  I expect Thai food to be hot, but this is another level.  The great thing is the waiter was more than happy to work with us.  We ordered one dish between medium and hot, one medium, one between mild and medium, and one mild.  We also received extra chiles on the side so everyone could add heat if they wanted more.  I recommend going a level below what you think you normally want and ask for some chiles on the side.",2ENYnoAK-OUshFsilqHKoA,2,0,5,S_9jv1YJ1C_KlYxcDrqRxQ

1676302,2017-05-08,0,0i9S0BejjRv0ZDwdO9XymA,Great 1st time experience!  I needed a place to get some warm soup late at night and just searched on Yelp for the nearest Thai that was on my way home and up came this one. I like the unique name too. The signage isn't the best and it's tucked back away in a corner but was open! The inside is VERY  bright and open and smelled of bleach -- it's almost industrial. I was thinking of something darker and cozier but it was fine--so then Olé came out and was soooo welcoming and accommodating! He is awesome! He gave amazing recommendations for the seafood soup and Pad voon sen! The food was piping hot and fresh! Awesomeness! And yes as Olé had said it's was the BEST Thai iced tea EVER! The chef does some magic brewing. So I will be back for Olé and the food -- the one star off is for the general ambience but that's a personal thing. Oh and they gave me free coconut ice cream for checking in on Yelp-more yumminess!! Thanks!!,oIISARIyxAaZAbjv4pYhbw,0,0,4,wC6aI4DNtCqCz05PMsvHrA

1773305,2017-10-20,0,0i9S0BejjRv0ZDwdO9XymA,Food was about average to me for a lunch/dinner spot. They have a mix of Thai and Korean dishes. I almost always choose Thai food every time I go out to eat but then I saw that they have seafood bibimbap on the menu so I ordered that instead. The brown rice was undercooked and stale which kinda made the fish and all of the toppings not as enjoyable when they're all mixed up. You can get something similar/better at Sakura Sushi inside Greenland market. It's called haedubap and comes w/ variety of fish instead of just salmon plus cheaper too. They were also out of Thai tea ice cream and nom yen (pink Thai milk tea) that I really wanted to try especially since not many other places offer those. Their complimentary crab rangoon they brought out to us was delicious though - it was perfectly crispy and even had real crab meat inside. Service here was friendly and attentive. I feel that there are other places around the area that are just better overall.,qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,2,0,3,gCayGKIpcjOCzTQPrzMbnw
1893102,2017-02-19,14,0i9S0BejjRv0ZDwdO9XymA,"The former Hooligan's dive bar with stuffed burgers has finally been replaced by a new business- Thai Seafood Ginger, straightforward Thai seafood specialties despite the backwards-sounding name. Hopefully they will be able to overcome their hidden location and stick around longer than their predecessors. 

We were brought out an appetizer sampler on the house, for the kitchen to test out new dishes. The rangoon, squid salad, seafood salad, and pickled veggies were all fresh and well-made. We started with the tom kha soup (sub tofu for the usual protein), and I had the Drunken Noodle entree (also with tofu) while my guy had their Spicy Garlic Shrimp- the seafood dish was definitely the best of what we ordered, which is in line with their business name. Pricing initially seemed a touch high but was justified by large portions.

The soup had a great broth, and was heartier than usual with added carrots and other veggies. The noodle dish was decent, but modifications to add mushroom and sub tofu to accommodate my (part time) vegan diet were met with a dish that had egg (despite it not being listed in the description), no requested mushroom, and a ton of fried tofu... that was soggy rather than crispy. My guy really enjoyed his shrimp dish and the spicy garlic sauce I tried was robust and flavorful. The seafood was definitely their strongest dish.

Service was friendly and the interior has undergone a complete transformation since it's days as a dive bar- the bright modern interior has a red and black theme and a huge bar area. They're close enough to home to be my go-to Thai takeout option, so I may revisit for lunch, or perhaps to try some of their Korean dishes.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,16,3,l6F_Z4kXXZ7-D2foyfSJ8w

Yesterday, I had some chicken pad thai that was so sweet that I couldn't believe it. The noodles were stuck together in wads. There was no one else in the place, yet half eaten food, dishes and half empty glasses remained on an adjoining table throughout the meal. Perhaps they changed chefs... the waitress was very nice, but otherwise, I don't know what gives. Keep it clean. The Health Dept was there and took down the not very uplifting C rating right before I left, but I did not remain to see if it went to an A from there. I hope so.

1983958,2017-06-08,0,0i9S0BejjRv0ZDwdO9XymA,"Since 3-stars to me is simply average, I cannot bring myself to give it. 

Upon arriving, Hubs and I were seated quickly with note that our server would be right with us. And right with us he was! We were greeted with enthusiasm and friendliness that you just don't find in Vegas. Service was exceptional, for sure! 

Being half Korean, I had to try their Korean dishes. Hubs is not a fan of the dishes offered for Korean fare, so he stuck with our favorite - Yellow Curry with chicken. I ordered the Kalbi, even though I'm usually a little wary of ordering Korean from a non-Korean venue. 

We were brought a plate of crab Rangoon, on the house. I have to say, this really was the best I've had in the Valley. I am usually not a fan of the dish, but I didn't want to be rude and not at least try it - I ended up eating them all, they were that good! Hot and fresh from the fryer, the filling was creamy, just a tad sweet (just how I like it) and filled with REAL crab meat. I would definitely recommend you try it here if you like this dish! 

The main course came out shortly after - Hubs stated his meal was good, but that he's had better. It appeared to have a good mix of vegetables and was balanced well with the amount of chicken. I tried a taste of his broth at the end and agree, although it was good, we have had better. We both prefer our curry a little more on the creamy side (this appeared to be pretty watery) and there was a bit of a... tang? to it. Just a little different than what we're used to/prefer - but definitely NOT bad. Probably wouldn't satisfy a craving for curry for me, but would be a decent meal option if I was just out for a good meal. 

The Kalbi - well, it was good, but I likely won't order it again. With so many Korean options in Vegas, it's just not on the top of my list. The meat was tender and well marinated, but the taste was a little... off... from what I'm used to. I enjoy the meat a little sweeter, and with less of a puree covered feel. I understand for many places, the marinade recipe calls for pureed fruit, and this may have been what I was feeling - but it's just not my style. The meat also seemed to be a sloppy cut at the butcher - which is not something to really hold against the restaurant, but when I have to be careful about how hard I chew because a shaving of rib bone might be in the mix, it's a little less enjoyable. 

All in all, the location is nearby which makes it very convenient. The prices are reasonable and although the taste isn't what we're ""used to"", it's not like the meal was bad, it that makes any sense. Kind of like - it's good, but not like mom makes it. You know what I mean?

Also, I ordered a Thai Iced Tea - they boast it's the best in Las Vegas. It's good, very good, but there are other places just as good, or even a little better - for much cheaper. $4 for the drink is a little steep for me. I got it for free with the current check in offer, so it wasn't so bad - but knowing it is $4, I will likely be going elsewhere for my tea needs (when I don't brew it at home).",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,1,0,4,FPjBPtgllASQLTE2gvspkQ

Average Thai food in Las Vegas is not hard to come by. Average Thai food with exceptional service? Well, that's a little more rare. We heard about a new Thai restaurant that also had some Korean dishes. This is normally not a good thing. It's typically better if a restaurant specializes in one cuisine, but then there's always exceptions to that norm...such as island style. So when we looked and saw seafood in the name, we knew we had to check it out... 

As it turns out, what you have at Thai Seafood Ginger is average food accompanied with the aforementioned outstanding service. As such, I wouldn't try to dissuade the casual Thai eater from coming here...but for those that don't believe that all curries are created equal, there are a lot of better Thai places in town.

I had a 10% off coupon to use, so my love and I went to check this new restaurant out after a mid week yoga class. We were ready to Indulge in some Thai food with seafood.

As you walk in, you see a large, yet something-missing kind of space...it almost looked as if it was not open for business. We were greeted by our server who was so welcoming--genuinely affable and warm. We ordered Papaya Salad, Seafood  Curry, and Pad See Ew.

The Papaya Salad was prepared with green papaya and seasoned with tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, cabbage,  and spicy lime dressing...the taste was not memorable. Not a good memorable anyway, the cabbage was not fresh...it had a sharp aroma that wasn't pleasant. We were so excited to taste the Seafood Curry until we saw and tasted the dish...far too watery to be a Thai style curry and too plain to be served. The vegetables in the curry seemed to be thawed after frozen, especially carrot slices. The Pad See Ew was the best we had, but the noodles were undercooked to any standard. This dish lacked flavor as well.

It's hard for me to grasp where all those 5 star reviews came from and why we didn't have those amazing dishes they set out for others...I can only hope Thai Seafood Ginger improves and meets the standard of Vegas's educated and intelligent eaters.

Also the variety in the menu and well as how many different ingredients added into the dishes themselves is amazing. You can tell they care about making the food good not just making an easy buck.

He was even very honest when we asked if the flower that was served w/our ice cream was edible (because it was too pretty to eat lol) and he honestly replied that we can & that it wasn't poisonous or anything but it won't taste as good as the ice cream.

FOOD: Amazing! We tried the Spicy Garlic Shrimp and the Fried Chili Seafood. They don't skimp on the seafood. The ingredients (scallops, mussels, shrimp, squid, & clam) were all fresh.

SERVICE: A+mazing (as Mariah Carey would say). We had two servers (Dao and Olé). They very friendly, quick, accommodating, & sweet.
The owner also gave us complimentary Crab Rangoon and we got our free ice cream.

We definitely recommend this place! Authentic!!!

Let's start off with basic tom yum. If you cant pull this off, then you're no thai restaurant. 
What kind of tom yum is sweet instead of sour? There was so much oil on the surface that half of my spoon was submerged in it.

Pad see ew. The noodles were unevenly cooked and tastewise, it was awfully mediocre. Kale was extremely bitter.

Curry. I'm not complaining, but it does run a bit watery compared to other places.

Lunch portion is a full size order and it is wayyy bigger than what one can eat in a single serving

Pad See Ew - friend got it with beef.  The noodles were spongy and not soggy (overcooked).  Thick sauce and not overly salty.  Veggies were cooked well.

Pineapple curry - with shrimp and fried tofu.  More viscous curry so eat with a fork if you're using a plate.  Shrimp was firm and tofu added some extra protein.

Crab ragoon - fried lightly with crispy skin (not burnt) with a good about of filling

Thai tea - ""It was like crack.""

Thai coffee - a bit sweeter Vietnamese coffee but still delicious.  Very large sized drink

Hot tea - korean tea bag that comes in a cute porcelain cup with lid to keep warm.  It stayed hot through the whole meal without refill.

Coconut ice cream - served in a tall stem cocktail glass.  House made with coconut milk, fresh coconut, and some type of fruit seed with tapioca like texture with a sprig of mint.  It was my favorite of the meal.

A new mom & pop restaurant that just opened a couple months. The restaurant decor is simple but beautifully done.

We ordered a couple entrees. While waiting for our food, the chef sent out a complimentary appetizer, crab rangoon and I say it's the best I had in town. The server gave us a couple of drinks to try thai tea and lime juice. I'm not fond of cold drinks that has milk. I tried the thai tea but still not for me. My husband finished the drink though. I had the lime juice with honey. I loved the light taste of it, but a bit on the sweet side for me. 

Our food arrived, deep fried fish with mango salad/salsa and it was very delicious. It reminded me of when we visited Thailand. The spiciness was just perfect. Another entree was the lemon chicken which was not bad at all but my eye was on the fish alone. 

To top it all the service was top notch. Definitely a place to recommend.",APJZG-Mt2VklE63dJOiiZQ,0,0,5,vvHg1mNuXFRSRJHbOaU0OQ

And, it was chock full of mussels, clams, shrimp, squid, fish, and scallops. (Most places are stingy and use seafood as decoration.) Sean, our waiter, was awesome, very attentive and friendly.

So happy to have discovered this restaurant, they only opened a few months ago- and we wish them all the best- until next time!!",QaTxU6LOwGC8cR4vI5HXCA,2,1,5,aNHyN7ku6DHUqHGml2OmZQ

I wish they had a lunch special menu, but it's amazing. They do have Korean dishes as well. I'm looking forward to coming back!",d_o8CMIHKlKWUfdrMmtOlA,0,0,5,KdrNnmEUM0KGX5GfzhyBAQ

Near the busy side of Vegas like the strip.",-xL6Vy7hpffs1gYu8fyLIg,0,0,1,lzU_TlBmEZVKgihTv0eKeg

The vegetables were as much a feast for the eyes as the just right spicyness of the ginger appealed to the palate. My server, Dao, was super attentive and checked frequently to make certain everything was to my liking. Thai Seafood is tucked away...so don't miss it. Worth your time and wallet to stop by for a welcoming bite.",qbaQbZbrFdvXwVzYkyumzA,1,0,5,7-J6_NNNCVek4pkULQqSLA
5854240,2017-08-18,3,0i9S0BejjRv0ZDwdO9XymA,"My go-to food when I am starving and can't decide what to eat is always Thai food - Pad Thai to be specific.  I found Thai Seafood Ginger on Yelp and have had it delivered 1-2 times a week over the last 2 months.  Delivery is prompt, food is warm and it's decent Thai food.  I did stop in the other night for the first time.  The restaurant was nearly empty but it is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and not the easiest place to find.  Service was great and all of the orders were correct.  I really like their fresh spring rolls, the hubby loves the crab rangoon and the Pad Thai is decent.  I really wish that they would bring back the Honey Limeade - because that was delicious!  Overall, it's a good place to eat and if you don't want to leave your house - delivery is a great option.",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,6,3,4,sj_qfUcE7fPqc655uxQ7ZA

I always get the yellow curry and it's a little more on the soupier side but soaks up in the rice really nicely. My boyfriend gets the lemon chicken and he's said it's the best chicken he's had in a while.",iETCGuWIAgwS1oY8ApI85A,0,0,5,pfDUlrOUoG96WVx7I8l8CQ
