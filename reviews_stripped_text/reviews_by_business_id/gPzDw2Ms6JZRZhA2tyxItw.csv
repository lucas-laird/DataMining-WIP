The renovations made to the store were exceptional and the cashier was super friendly. Very good time for a Burger King.,EuVwlUj8RDV-Lxqz0QhvYw,0,0,5,WDZvdJrFL9Lk3qvYLEYx9A

It was remodeled and everything is very clean and wonderful..But I must say that one employee really stands out ..His name is Francisco ..He has the greatest customer service skills, always smiling and happy at the job he does. I wish more places had employees like him. If your looking for great food whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or maybe just a quick snack, you won't be disappointed.. great service, good value for your money, and great service.",tPHsCkjYsBgKr_fw-m-LBQ,0,0,5,I8u2JVfRNTKgFNJaBs8cUA

I came in to place an order & nobody was at cashier.
The place is a mess & the workers are bad at communicating with each other. I love eating Burgerking but this location is bad.",Q4uccJwGm_iMOgoiPe86uw,1,0,1,hoSfdUG55ivcUwTj0763Kw

I felt cared about and important, something that I rarely feel in my life. My trip to Burger King tonight completely rejuvenated my spirits and re-energized me for the turmoils and stress that naturally come in life. I will definitely be coming back.",Cis1MEn25Tn5AdxLHk7G6w,1,0,5,vyFJ2zqM5aZKtD3A7Dpwcw
4121479,2013-08-31,0,gPzDw2Ms6JZRZhA2tyxItw,Went here for lunch the other day since it is close to work. I ordered a grilled chicken ranch wrap. Got a fried chicken wrap with honey mustard. Chicken was fatty and gross but I should have expected that I guess. Not trying that again,YzIOj3ctc0JpFaG0noHebg,1,0,1,QPvSG8Ai9YMLxUoYZwERDw
4406221,2010-01-03,6,gPzDw2Ms6JZRZhA2tyxItw,"1st to review? I guess thats really no surprise word gets around that this place is BAD!!

It's been quite awhile since I've been to Burger King mostly because they microwave everything right in front of you ans then tell you it was charbroiled. I was lured in by a co-worker willing to pay and wanting to try the NEW Funnel Cake sticks.

I stay away from the burgers since they are FROZEN patties semi-broiled then microwaved. Not my kind of burger. I do however enjoy an occassional chicken sandwich microwaved or not. I ordered it MY WAY-plain.

The chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake sticks were terrible-like a vanilla flavored straw made of straw. I couldnt eat them, neither could my son:(

A place I wont be back to for another long while and thats not even due to the terrible service we experienced taking more than 20 minutes for 3 chicken sandwiches + 2 funnel cake sticks.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,8,5,2,oYYlcEp8kDtFux1Wyi875Q

One coffee... it's not like I had a big order or anything, just one cup of coffee. Took a sip and the lid wasn't on all the way so half of it leaked out and spilled all over and burned my lap and stomach. They had one job and couldn't even prepare a cup of coffee safely.

5862453,2015-10-19,0,gPzDw2Ms6JZRZhA2tyxItw,"Terrible service. I just went in a few min ago, I was first in line and waited 5 min for someone, anyone to acknowledge me and take my order. Lots of people behind the counter. All apparently waiting on drive thru customers. Not one employee to work the counter and serve the walk in customers. So, they did not get my business, I just left and will never go back. They don't want my money? They won't get it.",X7dzSxWdHcJbvCJBHmnDpA,0,0,1,XB-am4uqSLHMknvG3lcbCw
5980790,2018-02-14,0,gPzDw2Ms6JZRZhA2tyxItw,"SLOWEST Burger king I'VE ever been to,.. I know i been here a couple times last year and i SEE WHY me & my family stop coming here. Theyre way too slow and need more workers for one. I PROMISE YOU my last visit here was 2/11/18 when my order was very wrong and was going to have to be remade for a third time that was it and demanded a refund i see why the boys in the back who made the food in the morning works in fast food. How many times does it take to get sandwiches correct and cheesy has browns correct and it this who time it took us twenty mins to wait on an order we didnt receive. If i could i would have given this place a NO STAR. Besides homeless people lingering around and inside the restaurant && taking wash ups in the restrooms.",oS4pqudBM8okSRf9D97SaQ,0,0,1,TKbdrCdSqvaTMCQgGJo0ZA
