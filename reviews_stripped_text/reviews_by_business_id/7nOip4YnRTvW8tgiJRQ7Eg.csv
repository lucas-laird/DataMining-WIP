They have very delicious food and the prices are a deal. They take cash and debit. They don't currently deliver. The wait time is not so long. Can't wait to see them grow!",9TFIghUif-STiTV3rnCaaw,2,0,5,LUKlRmnOvAzkkGUQ-i108Q
3253758,2018-04-30,0,7nOip4YnRTvW8tgiJRQ7Eg,What's the point in having a special requests section if your not going to follow the special request. What's so hard about not throwing lettuce and guacamole on the plate. People order without guacamole because they may be allergic. Ever think of that. Well I guess is back to Robertos. It's funny too...most of those guys don't speak English and the still get it right everytime. Step it up habaneros.,xhyRXvER3M-_u2c8mzIZ3Q,0,0,1,0jAUXlOr1QtuUMISjgJJHw

I got a good vibe from this place the cook reminded me of my cousin who passed away a couple yrs ago who also was cook/owner of his own Mexican food restaurant in Northern California.... Definitely will be coming back.....",iJAHqoFJQlmLn5_RpmS7Tw,0,0,5,o7Tlg-Tll024t1VaudT-PQ
3402013,2018-07-02,0,7nOip4YnRTvW8tgiJRQ7Eg,"Im rating this place 3 1/2 stars, my bf and I were craving carne asada fries so we decided to give this place a try after looking at their reviews. We ended up getting a torta to share and the fries. The food overall was good, the meat had a good taste. Only complaint is that the fries needed more cheese but I'm sure you can order extra cheese or ask for the nacho cheese. 

One more thing I would suggest is having a salsa bar so guests can help themselves to different salsas like most taquerias have. They only gave us 2 little containers and it seemed like they only had one type.",n7WeWRCpDoiP_yHwGe8_jw,0,1,4,c4Bd_6ShfciKIo_-XkH61Q
