71139,2017-04-03,0,nepZ1HPAgBqw0TgJWbSgOA,"Whelp , went here with a family of five looking for a good barbecue spot. What we got was a whole lot of fat, skimpy meat with marginal flavor that's terribly overpriced. Wanted a sample of different meats like most places have; they don't offer any. Everything is al la carte. Menu says $2 for sides then they show you that the $2 price is literally a tablespoon so you'll need to pay $6.99 for a pint or $11.99 for a quart of one side. No mashed potatoes, very limited selection. Ordered their ""Bad ass fries"" and received these plain ass fries with nothing as advertised (picture). I ordered to go so I didn't check my food until I made it home and was pissed. Underwhelming and disappointed is an understatement.  My nine year old summed it up best with "" Dad, I don't really taste much meat so I'm just dipping it in the sauce"". My thoughts exactly. Severely Overpriced. Don't waste you time nor money. I would've glad shelled out more elsewhere. This puny portion set me back $70! Never again",wtfkiZbF4A-KegFBX6i6iA,1,0,1,IfOCrx9hPitWSTT6oc36JA

I ordered the pork sandwhich, which came with coleslaw, I also ordered the baked beans, and a big red soda. The pork was super tender and smokey tasting. The baked beans were SO good. It had chuncks of smoked thick cut bacon, very delicious. Also the coleslaw was like none Ive ever eaten before. It didnt have a ton of vinegar..it had alot of fresh dill and tasted very light, I could eat a whole bowl of it, just by itself.

However, this super cute and quaint restaurant was very clean, so were the restrooms-a HUGE plus in our book!  Secondly, the owner Steve, is a BBQ champion, he has more trophies on display in the restaurant than you can shake a stick at.

We split the 'Big Daddy', (because we wanted to taste a little of everything), which is five smoked meats, 2 sides and Texas bread. OMG, the food was incredible and the sauces are to die for!  We had to restrain ourselves from eating it all and ended up bringing the leftovers home for dinner.

We're so happy we made the trip across town, it was definitely worth it!!  If you're looking for outstanding bbq/smoked food, look no further.",GIsXPEy4HXSNSgniVrsTag,0,0,5,b0VkrXXw4Y_8K-Zib-Vk6Q

After they came and set up for the party of 30+ people I still was a little concern. Steve was outstanding. The brisket was the best I ever had. The BBQ and the Chicken was outstanding. The people at the party were so impressed that they all asked for Sin City Smokers brochure. These guys are amazing. The questions that should be asked.

First: Picking our food and our setting was incredibly easy and affordable. 

Second: they came fully prepared with all the necessary equipment, and tableware making the set up incredibly easy on us. The serving went off with out any problems whatsoever.

Third: (and most important) the food is excellent. The portions were great. The beef brisket was so popular, we had none left over. The sides were also great, especially the Mac N Cheese! We found that the portioning was almost spot on. We had just enough left over to enjoy.

We went for dinner, was very surprised to find that you only get 4 ribs with the pork ribs, and the size of the sides were ridiculous.  The sides were not much bigger than the little cups that you get your salad dressing in at most places!  I had the brisket, it was ok at best!  Odd to have raw onions with it..... No texas toast or anything else, just 3 pieces of meat and to very small sides.  So dinner for two, rib meal, brisket meal, 2 sodas, and tip it was over $40 dollars.

Far as the meats, my ribs were good but not $15 good and they both felt the portion on the chicken was lacking, along the anything special on taste for the price. The sides were small too. Use to normally getting loaded at BBQ joints with sides or at least bread but here not the case. Only drink options are in a fridge or lemonade/tea is prepared. Have to say, if you do go by, have to try their banana pudding! Now that was delish! Overall for Spending $50 for 3 people to eat, I'm disappointed. Had high hopes for this place based on help reviews but maybe we came on an off day or time. 
Also, not family friendly at all. Well those with small children. I have a almost two year old, yet no high chairs were seen nor ever offered so it forced my wife to have to hang onto him.

The sides at $2 each are limited and the creativity to the beans and potato salad did not pay off. They also come in little cups smaller than a Snack pac pudding. Very stingy for inexpensive items. Sauce was either spicy or too sweet. I asked for bread because it is not listed anywhere but it was nothing special. For two of us it came to $34.95.  Only one other customer and service was very slow. The girl serving us had long brown hair flying around with no net or hair the the health department requires.

I ordered the special of the day which was a base of mac and cheese, with pieces of ""burnt ends"" of beef brisket.  It was then supposed to be covered with more mac and cheese and fried jalapenos.  

It  arrived in a tin foil take out bowl (even though I was eating in) accompanied by a plastic fork and knife.  The mac and cheese was lukewarm, with a not more than 5 small pieces of meat on top if it.  The mac and cheese was only OK, but the meat was terrible.  Burnt ends (at least in Texas) are meaty and juicy.  Here half of the meat was just fat, and the other half was dried out and incredibly tough to eat.  There were a few small (less than 5) small pieces of jalapeno.

The waiter came over to ask how the meal was.  It told him it was terrible.  The meat was dried out with little flavor.  In virtually every other restaurant when I tell someone that I don't like a dish, they immediately offer to replace it with another dish and often offer to refund my money.  Here at Sin City, he simply stared at me when I told him how bad I thought the food was, and offered me nothing.  I then got up and left.

The meat was good, is the only reason why I put 3 stars, everything is terrible which should be reviewed by the owners and have it on their consideration.

Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you.
I always try something at least twice, I believe everyone deserves a fair chance. 

This place was a one star experience on BOTH visits. First was a lackluster dine in experience where a sandwich consisted of white toast, a small scoop of meat (of which half was fat and gristle), and FAKE American sliced cheese straight out of the Kraft wrapper. Sitting next to that is a huge pile of sliced raw onion (why??) and a gigantic ""pickled jalapeño"" (which is NOT pickled whatsoever, just likely boiled down with no vinegar or spices and is bitter and inedible). Out of this plate of food I ate maybe 3 fork bites of meat. No joke, that's the edible part. Of a full sandwich.

Second visit was tonight's carry out for the family which is as $35 of the coldest, fat soaked food I've ever eaten. And don't think it was cold because we showed up late. We live right around the corner and from our phone call to pickup it was 10 minutes max. Cold chicken quarter platter...so cold my kids asked why it was from a fridge. Cold and wilted ""side order"" fries, maybe 10 total, might I add. Smoked pork tacos that literally tasted like they had ladled the pork fat right on top to make them moist. With every bite, my mouth was coated with cold, flavorless pork fat. I actually gagged and spat it out and ate the corn salad topping for dinner. My husband also said his sandwich had no sauce but was covered in the same fat drenching, making it a soggy mess and flavorless.

Listen, if you've made it this far, don't go there. It's gross, not just disappointing, but gross. Not sure what the deal is with place, but I have no idea how they own and operate a ""restaurant"". I hate to add in the rude commentary, but at this point I am angry these people have taken any of my money with the terrible product they've provided me.",O5mzCXMSsyjT1s-4BUBWgw,3,0,1,aIpFAbLUqri9KuA0i6901w

After phoning my sister to let her know I'd found our caterer, she suggested a few changes to my menu choices. Without problem or hesitation, tweaks to the originally planned menu were made, and from burgers to chicken to German potato salad and grilled fresh, seasonal vegetables, all of the food was delicious. They supplied all the necessities: plates, utensils, napkins, condiments, and I was assured, too, they would clean up and vanquish all remnants of their presence, that we wouldn't even know they had been there, and true to their word, it was so. They did, however, leave all the excellent, leftover food - another blessing in a time of deep grief.

Before you order: after perusing the menu on the wall, be sure to take a glance down below the register...posted on the front of the bar/counter are three other menu items not listed with the others. One being the Big Daddy Platter for $25: five meats, two sides, two Texas toast.

Two of us shared 2 ribs (nice and lean, wonderfully tender), 4 brisket slices (also trimmed, nice and lean), sausage (hot links? tasty and flavorful), chicken, and pulled pork (not fatty, moist and yummy), beans and fries.  

I decided to add the Special that day; BBQ Lasagna for $7. I know it sounds weird, but was amazingly addictive. It was definitely different, but we couldn't stop taking bites of it. I would call it a BBQ Casserole, though. :)

After throwing on a couple pieces of cornbread to boot, we stuffed ourselves silly, and still had more than half of almost everything to take home.

Everyone was super friendly and it felt very homey to eat in there. The decorations were eclectic and charming, including a quite full trophy case and oversized check from a competition won.

Unfortunately, we didn't see the desserts in the case until after we were done...or had any room for by that time...but we will make a point to try a couple the next time, because we will definitely be back!",OcpxS8U7evLWyfw1K2pwng,2,1,5,BPUjdpIdmcKpJrnQmkAYaw

And for those who want details:  The strip mall was deserted, it was late afternoon on a Sunday.  They looked closed due to the darkened windows but that was not the case.  Country music was playing, we were greeted immediately upon entering and asked if it was our first time in.  It was so they explained how the menu worked (super helpful!).

I ordered the brisket on Texas toast, baked beans and coleslaw with dill.  OMFG...
Brisket:  incredibly tender!  Our server recommended putting the barbecue sauce and the horseradish on the sandwich.  Being a foodie, I had to taste both the barbecue sauce and the horseradish prior to dressing my brisket.  OMFG once again!  The horseradish was not overpowering and had crunchy cabbage in it (it rocked!).  The barbecue sauce...wow...not sweet, acidic, secret recipe...I added them both as suggested.  Best idea ever!
Baked beans:  Sweet with maple coming through nice and strong with a subtle hint of bacon.  LOVED.  It could have been my dessert and I almost drank the sauce left over after the beans were gone.
Dill coleslaw:  Not too much mayonnaise (I hate mayonnaise!) and the flavor of dill came through although it was not overpowering (perfect and fresh tasting!).
Chicken:  Barbecued perfectly and sooooo tender!  The barbecue sauce on the chicken was different than the brisket sauce; sweet but not overpowering. 
Jalapeno potato salad:  Once again, not too much mayonnaise and the jalapeno did not burn your mouth in the slightest, it only added a special touch to what can be a common, boring side dish.  Oh how good it was!
Beverages:  Oh the options!  The mint tea (with fresh mint and unsweetened) was so refreshing!  The sweet tea was delicious too.  All brewed on site, none of that crap coming out of a soda machine dispenser!  Also saw a pitcher of cherry lime aid, you KNOW that has to be delish!
I'm coming back and dessert will be on the agenda as well as the food!

It really feels like a family spot.  The menu is cool you pick the meat (or veggie) you want and then how you want it, plated, sandwich, taco, fries, quesadilla, etc.  Since we were ordering for several of us we opted to order by the pound.  We ordered 1 rack of spare ribs, 1/4 lb brisket, 2 hot links (we were told 2 links = 1/2lb), veggie plate, quart of mac and cheese, quart of potato salad, 3 corn bread and a sweet tea.  Our total before tip was just under $100.  Price was around what we normally spend when getting bbq so that wasn't an issue.  Food was good.  It just didn't blow anyone away.   Didn't seem like we got 2 hotlinks but maybe it was a 1/2 lb and that is closest to 2 links.  Hot links were our favorite part of the meal.  I could have done without all the onions, peppers, jalapeno, etc, that in some form was on every meat.  It didn't affect the taste of the meat that I could tell.  It was more of a garnish.  Maybe it is a regional thing?  I think the hot links had more veggies than the veggie plate.  Mac and cheese was topped with Cheez-Its that was a nice touch.  The potato salad had jalapenos but wasn't spicy (that is not a complaint just fyi).  The cornbread was sweet and had great taste but was extremely dry.  Their house made bbq sauces were really good.  They have a regular and spicy.  They had several puddings in the drink case.  On the day we were there they had banana pudding, peanut butter and jelly (with nutter butters!) and a third I can't remember maybe funfetti or something like that.  When we got home we wished we would have gotten them.

The new hubs and I decided to do it ourselves for our wedding over Memorial Day weekend. I contacted a bunch of places, as we weren't sure what kind of meal we wanted, but we knew our budget. Christie's reply was prompt and professional, we met shortly after for a tasting at their Henderson location. She gave us a number of options to fit our budget (120-150 wedding guests) which included service, entrees, sides, bread, and beverages on a per person basis. And the food!! - I took one bite of that juicy chicken, I wanted to slap my mama it was so good! 

The contract was clear and unambiguous. The couple of times I did have questions before the big day, Christie was responsive and helpful. 

The day of the wedding, they came in promptly and set up in the designated area. Service was flawless and everyone had more than enough to eat, with tons left over. As we surveyed the party, everyone was full and more than happy with the food. It was just what you want from a vendor on your wedding day - totally uneventful, professional, and polite - everything just worked!!! We (the tired bride and groom) feasted on the leftovers they thoughtfully packaged for us for the next couple of days. 

All in all, this was the best day of my life and Christie and her team helped to make that happen. Thanks Sin City Smokers, looking forward to booking you for our next event! (and stopping in for dinner next time we find ourselves in Henderson)

Without hesitation, I was told simply: ""Sin City"". Well, I just couldn't let my husband's Birthday pass without celebrating with some quality barbecue and that's JUST WHAT I FOUND at Sin City!!! The happy faces that greeted me as I placed my order was a welcome change to other eateries I'd been to in the area and then, my heart nearly ""skipped a beat"" when they brought out our orders of a rack of pork ribs, corn bread and creamy coleslaw!! Then I ate......That rack of ribs nearly had me up and dancing with delight!!! Very, very little fat on that rack and maximum flavor-ishous meat with two sauces to go along with it to boot!! The corn bread and creamy coleslaw did not disappoint either and were the perfect compliment to our ribs. The portion were also perfect too. Not too much and not too little either. The vibe of the place is ""so bomb"" too. You'll love the rustic, funky feel there too. THANK YOU SIN CITY FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!

I never order chicken at a barbecue place - I feel it's a waste... until I tried the chicken here. My current favorite is the B.S.L.T.  That stands for bacon steak lettuce and tomato sandwich. It haunts my dreams. This is the kind of barbecue that would delay air force one on the tarmac while secret service picks up food and brings it back.  This is the kind of barbecue that would make cops and criminals forget their differences and just sit down at the table to eat. This is the kind of barbecue that would eliminate racial tensions across this land. This is not a paid review nor my connected in anyway to this establishment.

The pros 

Nice flavor on the brisket at the sauce good quality nicely done, not the best brisket I've ever had but above avg

The mac & cheese was all right slightly above average

The baked beans were actually the highlight of the meal might be some of the tastiest beans I can remember I've had

The cons the size of the sides really a miniature cups for two dollars each I would rather spend 2.50 to 3 dollars a side and get just a little bit more than they give, especially considering how good those beans are

They do offer what they call a plate version but I did my find another way to combine meats like most other of the barbecue places do, seems to me that they could do some work on the menu such as offering a two or a three meat combo maybe I missed it but the menu still seems to be needing a little bit more development

The staff is friendly which is a plus

This is very close to being 4stars....sure I'll give it another go and if it's good it will get bumped up there's just so many bbq places and the sides value and the ability to get more than just one meats are things that can be improved",dmOKXLjffo-mTgdcMw7FsQ,0,0,3,52MgvCG2LBXNcuLAqxJBGg

I went with the Brisket ( a 1/4 lb) and it came with raw onions and a pepper. I really just wanted meat, raw onions are not appetizing to me  but the grilled pepper had some nice flavors. I also had a 1/2 rack of ribs. The ribs were decent, nothing out of this world or something I would go back for. The brisket was dry and I was thankful they put sauce in my bag so it was more edible. It did have a nice outer crust and smoke ring, just not juicy as I have had it elsewhere. Looking at the different sides I went with the mac and cheese, they call it another name but that's what it was. It was a super small portion, a few bites and there is a cheese it on top.

The sides dont have as much ""soul"" (hint hint wink wink) as is my preference but good enough. I don't recommend the mac and cheese. Idea is better than the execution. It's essentially kraft plus chez-Its. My only real complaint. 
     Ive liked: BSLT, Brisket (was as close to being in Texas that I've had), Texas Melt and baked beans. ..good lemonade  (not too sweet). 
     Friendly service. Really clean. Food fast considering the quality. 
   If you read poor reviews about this spot...I say do two things. 1 compare and contrast other Henderson options. If you been here more than a year you understand. 2. Look at their review history. You'll see what I mean.

4052456,2017-02-16,3,nepZ1HPAgBqw0TgJWbSgOA,"Sin City Smokers is Hot & New.  Actually, they're not new to Las Vegas.  Sin City Smokers is known around town as one of the best BBQ catering businesses in Las Vegas.  They're also known throughout the country and have placed 1st place for ""Best Ribs"" a ton of times.  Check out their trophy cage located inside their restaurant.  It's pretty impressive. 

I heard rumors over a year ago that Sin City Smokers was planning on opening a restaurant in Las Vegas.  And finally, they're here.  Sin City Smokers is known for their ribs, but it's the brisket that brought me here.  If they have good ribs, they must have a good brisket too.  Besides, I usually skip pork and not a huge ribs guy.  The menu isn't stacked like the rest of the BBQ restaurants in town.  Their meats consist of ribs, hot links, BBQ chicken, and brisket.  Pick your meat and then choose how you want it served.  I chose to have the brisket with their Texas toast.  I have to admit, the brisket is one of the best that I've had in Las Vegas.  The brisket was a combination of fatty and lean, which is just how I like it. It was also tender and had that smoked flavor to it.  It's a good thing that the brisket was good because the Texas toast was a little dry.  The brisket was so good that I ended up eating it by itself with no sauces.  If I had an issue with their brisket, it's the portion size.  I got about 6 oz. of brisket for $9.99.  Additional sides are $2 and I got their Maple Bacon Baked Beans.  This was pretty good.  I just thought it was a little small (less than a cup) for the price.  

Overall, I have mixed feelings about Sin City Smokers.  Las Vegas has a lot of BBQ restaurants in town, especially in Henderson.  For the price I paid, I'm used to getting about 8 oz. of meat, sometimes two different types, and two sides.  Also keep in mind that they don't hook it up here.  The menu is also missing beef ribs, tri-tip, burnt ends, turkey, etc.  I'm not saying they don't have it or can't make it.  It's just not on their menu.  The sides for $2 each are on the smaller side too.  But then again, I didn't get what they're known for and that's their ribs.  The reason for the 4 star review is because their brisket is so good and worth coming back for. I just wish the portions, including their sides, are a little bigger.  

TIP #1: Located off Green Valley and Sunset, where Sumo Sushi used to be located. 
TIP #2: Check out their Weekly Specials.  
TIP #3: Signature Sandwiches also on the menu (3 pork sandwiches / 1 beef sandwich)",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,11,6,4,_iNLFLHHysr3K074O02r7Q

4382234,2017-08-05,3,nepZ1HPAgBqw0TgJWbSgOA,"A nice addition to the Henderson BBQ scene that seems to be growing by the day. My husband loves meat and wanted to try this spot as soon as he discovered it. It seemed like good fuel before our axe throwing league night. 

Sin City Smokers Barbeque is located in an older shopping center at Sunset and Green Valley. It's not the nicest looking shopping center so I was pleasantly surprised when we stepped inside the restaurant. The restaurant is very clean and uncluttered. The Texas BBQ themed décor was cute and added to the ambiance. The counter is in the middle of the restaurant where orders are taken and then brought to the table. The entrance divides two sections of seating. The inside of the restaurant is well done for a casual dining spot. The restaurant smells amazing as soon as you walk in the door too.

The menu offers several meats and from there you choose if you want the meat in tacos, a salad, plated, as a sandwich, in a quesadilla, or on fries. There are about half a dozen side options that come a la carte. In addition there are several specialty sandwich options and daily specials. The menu doesn't look big, but there are a actually a lot of options.

My husband and I decided to share a few things. Unfortunately, they were out of ribs so we had to go with another meat. We chose Brisket and Smoked Pork. The brisket was marbled and didn't have a lean option. I really liked the flavor of it and when only eating half of the portion the amount of fat was fine. It would have been too rich for me to eat alone. The smoked pork was delicious and moist. I liked the traditional sauce that came with the meats. It had a little heat and a smoky flavor. The sweeter sauce was good, but I preferred the traditional sauce. 

For sides we shared Maple Bacon Sweet Baked Beans and Jalapeno Potato Salad. We both loved the baked beans and they were sweet indeed. I love that they didn't hold back on the maple flavor. The potato salad was good and the jalapeno didn't overwhelm the flavor or add too much heat. The only disappointment was the Sweet Tea. My husband declared it garbage and upon tasting I asked if he had grabbed from the wrong drink dispenser. Hopefully it was just a bad batch and it'll be better next time.

The pricing seemed about right in comparison to other BBQ spots in the area. Most places offer a plate that comes with sides, but even with the a la carte ordering it didn't add up to more than other restaurants charge for a combination plate. It'd be cool if the plated option that comes with onions and a jalapeno included a small piece of cornbread or even a slice of white bread (traditional to Texas BBQ style).

The portions aren't as large as some other spots, but I kind of liked that it was easy to enjoy BBQ without overdoing it. With my husband and I sharing two meats and two sides I'd say that our meal was on the lighter side. Each side made a small serving for each of us. 

We'll be back. Hopefully the ribs will be available next time!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,9,5,4,0NrSMTnrfV9mUlRlziWalg

It's just across the street from the Trader Joe's a shop at a few times a week! Hubby was at home with the kiddo and I said I'd bring home lunch. He was up for anything and I was craving BBQ, as always. I got some loaded fries for myself, tacos for him, some ribs and a free side thanks to my Yelp check-in. 

The way the menu is set up is pretty cool. They list all their meats, which you can get as a sandwich. And next to that are other ways to get them - as loaded fries, as tacos, etc. every day of the week is a different special - I remember one day is tamales. You can also buy meat by the pound, do a combo plate and pick out sides and desserts. 

I was completely in love with my loaded fries! The fries themselves were done well. And then they were topped with cheese, baked beans, corn salsa and choice of meat - I went with brisket. There were HUGE chunks of tender brisket all over these fries! The meat was so good that it could definitely stand on its own. The corn salsa and baked beans were great additions, too! I'm not usually a fan of beans, but these had so much flavor and were so sweet that I couldn't get enough!

The taco plate comes with two tacos. Hubby had one Pulled pork and one chicken and said he enjoyed both. Part of me wishes I'd gotten to try them myself, but I was happily stuffing those fries in my face...

The Ribs were some of the best I've found here in Vegas. They probably come in second. They had quite a chewy and flavorful bark and the meat was tender enough to pull off the bone. 

For my side I chose the dill slaw. It was decent, but nothing compared to my love affair with everything else. And it certainly had a strong dill flavor. 

The desserts I'm in the fridge looked good and I might have to try one next time. I can't wait until then!",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,3,2,5,w552-GzgtUnlvVDDpfi9QQ

This trip we called ahead to reserve only to discover it was unnecessary because there were still 4 left.  Oh well, better to be safe than eat at McDonalds.  I was surprised to find the restaurant entirely empty throughout our stay, perhaps everyone was out shopping?

I recently hosted a corporate party for upwards of 500 people at a private residence in the outskirts of Vegas.  Steve was consistently detail-oriented and professional from our first introductory phone call.  He holds a lot of pride in his business (as he should -- the food is INCREDIBLE) and it's evident through his courteous professionalism and passion for his craft. 

Now, onto the food.... he makes the absolute best brisket I have ever had.  Actually, I'm pretty sure it's the best meat I've ever eaten -- period.  Melt-in-your-mouth goodness with an incredible array of sides perfect for our audience.  We had:  ""smackeroni and cheese"", mashed potatoes, biscuits with honey butter, three different meat options (brisket, ribs and chicken) and salad.  Each and every item was standout delicious in its own right, but perfectly complemented one another on a (heaping!) plate.  

They were on time, set up and tore down quickly, and were friendly and informative for our guests.  I'd give them six stars if I could, and won't go anywhere else when I need a caterer in Vegas.

The aroma is out of this world, wafting into the parking lot, it hits your nose like a ton of bricks, in the most delicious way possible.

The atmosphere is very comfortable especially for a bbq joint.  Casual sit-down. Nice decor. 

The service is very friendly! I ordered online via yelp and the blonde who greeted me when I picked it up was vert nice and even let me use the yelp check-in to add a free small side to my already-completed order! 

They got the order correct and accomodated all my requests (cut sammich in half, sauce on the side, etc)

Brisket was tender.

The bbq sauce itself is delicious!  I really like the sweet bbq!  They put a bunch of dif flavors in the bag so I could sample them all! That really made me happy!

Now to what I didn't like.  Again, keep in mind that everyones tastes are different.  I am simply writing my personal take on the food.

Food was very greasy. I understand bbq isn't exactly health food.  And I am by no means a health nut.  But when the flavor and mouthfeel of grease is what stands out in a dish, it takes away from the experience. 

The food was missing that ""wow"" factor.  I can't place my finger on it but it just didn't ""hit the spot"" for me. I ate the food, but I found myself wishing I'd gotten something else.

 Maybe other items of theirs are more up my alley.

They keep it's simple with their 6 meats to choose from and you build from there to make any thing from tacos/quesadillas to the Bad Ass fries which are a favorite of mine!

The fries are in a league of their own. Very well seasoned and addicting, I couldn't stop myself.
The way the meats/meals are served is traditional of how bbq is served in many parts of the country (over raw white onion with a grilled jalapeño) If you don't like it simply ask for your dish plain.

They basically force you to upgrade to the larger sizes and extract more money. Okay, I get it. So, we ordered the largest coleslaw available and it wasn't even filled to the top.

C'mon, it's just cabbage with watered down mayo and some seasoning. If you make me pay extra, at least fill it to the top. The other sides weren't any better in that regard.

The meatballs were delicious and savory, and the pulled pork sandwiches were just right.  Lots of people from our event commented on the food and asked me where I found them.  There on site catering set up looks great and captures the BBQ vibe perfectly.  Highly recommended!",WXCOHDBzOV-i5MF7ec6jvA,0,0,5,C0ipmRAbzSd6gCKoaNHu7A

The staff is exceptionally friendly and they take the time to explain the menu if you need help. This was my fourth time there, and the service and quality of food remains consistent. I've had the ribs before and they were very good. I thought they were a little pricey, but that is very common for ribs. On my last visit, I had the brisket.  It was very flavorful, tender, moist, and the serving size was perfect. For sides we had, Mac & cheese, beans, and potato salad. I enjoyed them all. I've read complaints from others about serving size of the sides, but I thought they were the perfect amounts. The fact that this place is close to my house makes it all the better. I'm a fan for sure.",j9vih1KD2r-NLlaHfZPkRA,1,1,5,uL_r7cZhHd4arKHo37Tv0A

Also received a free side for checking in! I got the chopped pork and ribs and they were excellent! The chopped pork was smoky (but not too smoky) and full of flavor! The ribs were huge, juicy and tender! If you like good BBQ in a less crowded clean place I would definitely come here!! Great food and great portions! The staff is friendly the service was quick!!

5738506,2017-07-01,0,nepZ1HPAgBqw0TgJWbSgOA,Very friendly staff. I went on a Friday so I got the full rack. Was a pretty solid rib. Good BBQ sauce as well. Nice atmosphere wasn't crowded when I went around 6 o'clock which wasn't a bad thing. Tea was pretty solid and had free refills. I honestly didn't care for the sides but it was still pretty good. I think it was the ribs that stole the show for me,OgaVdTqZaRrFoRtPNyI1ag,1,0,5,2FAjQtosIALRjUpDjOb7lw
5774108,2017-01-29,13,nepZ1HPAgBqw0TgJWbSgOA,"Great news to have a new BBQ place within walking distance of my home. I loves me some 'cue!

Located at the intersection of Sunset and Green Valley Pkwy, in the NW corner shopping center. You walk in past all the trophies of owner Steve's competitive BBQ'g days up to the counter. Choice of meats, of how you want them (tacos, plate, sandwich, quesadilla, etc) and your sides ($2 each). They have a section of weekly specials and signature sandwiches as well.

I went with the 1/2 lb Brisket, with Maple Bacon sweet baked beans and 5 cheese Smack-A-Roni. All in, $20+. Sides are a bit small so recommend a double order. Brisket was nice and moist, with good flavor. The baked beans are almost the same recipe as my own, heavy on the maple and bacon flavor....delicious!!! Smack-a-Roni is good too, creamy with a couple cheez-its on top. 

Overall, the place is nicely decorated and clean. Service is good and friendly. Food is very tasty. I'll be back a lot I think, as I enjoy good BBQ. And I think they will get better as they work out all the kinks and get everything working perfectly. They only opened 5 days ago on 1/24, and sold out Friday night.

Hours are 10am-8pm 7 days a week. Not sure why but they have a catering page on Yelp as well with a few reviews, kind of confusing which page is which.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,26,26,4,y13cJ23rGJtdaJyVv15N_A

The iced tea, mint tea, and lemonade were delightful.
