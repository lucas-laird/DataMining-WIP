Located in New York New York, this quaint little hot dog place has a quality dog & great fries. Two people will leave full for just about $10.00. 

A native NYC-er & Chicagoan give it 2 thumbs up.",4SpvUkhmmb_KXUnQhxT_Fg,0,0,4,c0eENLuk9Ago1-g9IqDPsA

A good, cheap place to eat if you need some food in your stomach before getting ready and going out to the clubs.",W7wzsmg-XOKAHHZda9-Pgw,1,0,3,rMTgcRbYMzHAF1r8Iph-jw

I had the Chicago-style hot dog and the veggie mix on top was just way too excessive. I couldn't even taste the hot dog anymore because of all the damn toppings. My friend ordered the bratwurst and it was pretty plain tasting, nothing special. Even our sodas were wack -- super syrupy and sweet. Wish I tried some other place before here.",4TJF62R5ytolOmiMWKtjGA,1,0,2,UYUsmiidYfZuif6bI0kT5A

Vegas is a place of flashy exuberance; dripping with neon lights and bronzed blonds dressed in sequenced gowns. Champagne and caviar are as easily accessible as sweet Asian Lucy. Believe me when I say I wasn't in the mood for either. After winning a whole ten bucks on the penny slots, I wanted something good and semi-cheap to celebrate.

After meandering the pseudo streets of New York, New York, I settled on Jodi Maroni's Sausage Kingdom. Surprisingly, this little stand had a lot to choose from. There are Sausage sandwiches available from Hot Italian to Polish and Bratwurst to Chicken Pomegranate. There's also the good old fashioned hot dog which I settled on. I decided to get the combo which included fries and drink. The hot dog was good and the french fries were delicious. A simple meal, yes, but it definitely hit the spot AND I had some money left over from the ten bucks I won.

Jodi's is located near the ""Chrysler building"" and the Zumanity entrance. There are a lot of little tables and chairs around to sit and enjoy your meal and it's also a great area to people watch. Definitely a cute little  place. I give it three solid stars.",wXc5iFV2Z3-Wg02blnZtjQ,2,1,3,1S0_bQlG6F82hVn8ztcbbA
