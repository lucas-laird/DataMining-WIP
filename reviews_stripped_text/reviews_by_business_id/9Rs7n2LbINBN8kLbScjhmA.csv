The lady working here was absolutely rude to my party. They actually served us the softest crepe ever when we asked for extra crispy. On top of that, I personally feel that they purposely served us a bad crepe because we brought outside drinks in... even though there were no signs to prohibit it. Instead, the owner took the sleeves from my drink and switched it with theirs. Rudeee!!!! As ridiculous as that sound, the comparison between the crepes that was served to us and the crepes served to other customers were completely different. It was also super overpriced... About $15 a crepe and that's not even ""fully loaded"" with all toppings included. I will never return here again.",j2fcXtmGPV-MntIE9M7Tjw,3,0,1,XH5drxUrPwyI4Mhm60hzPg

A lady came by and said, ""i know you are looking at the picture online but we are different from the other restaurants, i can explain to you if u have any question."" i feel that she thought we didnt even know what crepe was and we had to look it up online.  NO, we were looking at the pictures from Yelp about your food! You dont know there is a Yelp app?  

Then, she told me that it was good that we were going to order dessert because she had closed the other part of the kitchen.  Your sign said that the place is closed at 10pm and you were still playing live music at 9:30pm and u told me you were closing when i was ordering?  Was it a nice thing to say to the customer? Not really. 

Besides they didnt get me the hot coco that i ordered, when i was cleaning up their toy because my son was crying, this french looking man came to me and asked me, ""can u take your son outside?""  i was thinking my son was crying for less than 2 mins and the table next to us didnt even turn their heads because the music was so loud.  We had paid and i was cleaning up the toy for u and get ready to leave.  What was the problem?  Do they really know customer service?  Not really.

My wife, son and I went here for dessert after having a bad experience at an other restaurant hoping to save our family night out. We were both very impressed from the moment we walked in. We were greeted by the chef who walked us over to a table near a play area for kids. There was a live band playing jazz by the front door. Our son saw the toys in the play area and was set for the rest of our stay. I am not very good at describing food so all I can say is that our crepes were delicious. The staff was very friendly. They have all sorts of activities throughout the week for kids. My wife and I were able to enjoy our crepes while our son played in the play area about ten feet away from us, so we never had to take our eyes off of him. When we were done with dessert, my wife and I sat for a while and played in the play area with our son who didn't want to leave.

Service is terrible and so does the crepes. Ordered the Monaco (the one with the creme burlee) and it was really just throwing a creme burlee on top of a piece of crepe. And the owner said ""our crepes are special and you can't find it anywhere else"". And the service? The guy who served us was an idiot. We ordered couple crepes for everyone to share.

We stumbled into here by chance, coming down from the upstairs and frankly, it took us a while to realize we are in a cafe. The performing band made us stay. Hubby ordered a Moroccan crepe, cuz he is form Morocco and was expecting authentic home-cooked goodie. Failed expectations. The stew in the crepe tasted like nothing traditionally  cooked in Morocco...  I ordered either a Polish crepe and could not finish it, too much of sauerkraut. And I love sauerkraut and sausage!

Service and decor are nice, selections are also big, which is good.  But the crepe itself it mediocre at its best.  A perfectly cooked crape for me is a little crispy on the edges and still light and fluffy like a crepe should be.  The few times I've tried here, they're usually OVERCOOKED.  Most of the time I couldn't even cut with my fork or even having hard time with a knife, it's not acceptable to me.  

I think if you like a bunch of nutella and whipped cream smothered the crepe so you're eating the sauce and not the crepe, this might be the place for you.  Or sometimes people get too excited to think it's a crepe place and they're eating crepe, but don't know what crepe is supposed to taste like.

864202,2014-09-20,1,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"The good: the owner is nice, the ambiance is pleasant. The crepes themselves (just the crepe, not the ingredients) were good.

The bad: the food. Much of it is frozen and/or canned, which is a bit disappointing for the price. We ordered the St. Tropez (sweet crepe, with orange juice, pears, and whipped cream). The menu says ""caramelized"" but the pears most definitely were not - they were likely dumped straight from a can onto the crepe. On that type of dish, the whipped cream makes up a large proportion of the total ingredients, which means that it matters to the overall quality of the dish. 

Actual conversation with server:

Server: ""how was your crepe?""
Me: ""It was okay.""
Server: ""What was wrong? What could have improved it?"" 
Me: ""You don't use real, fresh whipped cream."" 
Server: ""What do you mean? We use fresh Reddi-Whip from a can."" 

Ah, fresh reddi-whip from a can and canned pears with cheap orange juice. It wasn't horrible (we ate it) but it wasn't worth almost $12 and we won't be back. 

Finally, the servers are attentive to the point of being intrusive. We had FIVE different servers come by to try to take our orders before we ordered, and then AFTER we ordered we got at least three other interruptions from servers asking for our orders. I understand they're trying to be attentive and I applaud the effort but ultimately execution is all that matters and they fail dismally.

Agnes, (or Alex, I see different names in the reviews regarding the owner) the owner and chef,  is very much involved in the front of house as well as being the chef. We had the Germany,  Mexico, Europa and the Italian crepes.  All were very good and completely different. The Mexico was the most visually appealing with its vibrant colors.  Although,my husband ordered it with chicken and NO TOMATOES , it was served with beef and lots of tomatoes. He didn't say anything and ate the beef and picked out the tomatoes.  Not sure what was going through Agnes's head while making his crepe, but she seems the type to let you order what you ""think"" you want and ends up giving you what she thinks you should have, she had that kinda personality going on, but she was really into the food and very proud of her menu. You can tell she loves her business and really is involved on every level. The fresh brewed ice tea was delicious, it is $6.50 for a carafe, so it should be good.

1543861,2015-03-17,1,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"First off, let me say that the food deserves 5 stars, but the chairs were so uncomfortable that I had to deduct a star, the only thing that was bad about our initial visit here. And I say initial, because I know we'll be going back.

We were celebrating and wanted something different, the reviews and comments about this place sparked our curiosity.  We got to Tivoli, did the valet, and found this bistro to the left of Brio. 

We were there early enough that it was happy hour, with half-sized crepes being one of the specials (good wine prices being another). Since we hadn't been there before, we asked the waiter about them and he said they were about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a regular crepe.  Our mistake, not asking how big a regular crepe was.. thinking we knew that answer.  They were more what I would call a full-size crepe, so you can imagine how huge the regular size crepes are!

We got the following:
  From the breakfast crepe menu: 
     France: ham, egg, goat cheese, scallions, parsley, tomatoes, bechamel sauce
            (we both loved it)
     Alaska: smoked salmon, cream cheese, garnished with pickles, capers &
            cucumber slices (we both went apes, unanimously our favorite)
  From the lunch/dinner crepe menu:
     St. Petersburg: caviar, sour cream, pickled onion, tomato, cornichons, capers
            (really good!)
     Scandinavia: smoked white fish, sour cream, capers, tarragon sauce
            (exactly as described, but rather boring.. probably exactly like you'd get in 
             Sweden)
     Greece: chicken, Bulgarian feta cheese, greens, cucumbers, tomatoes,
            peppers, tsatsiki  (very good, like a chicken gyro in a crepe)
      And.. the night's special, which I forget what it was but it had chicken, 
            sauteed mushrooms and onions, peppers, and other yummy stuff (we 
            both liked this also but we were getting seriously full so most of it came
            home with us afterwards)

Then, the delightful chef decided to surprise us with a couple of dessert crepes, which we managed to find room for despite being full.

South Africa: lemon curd, lemon cream - delightful!
Monaco: creme brulee.. an OMG, I think I'm in heaven experience.

Every ingredient was carefully selected and meshed perfectly with the others to create a culinary travelogue for our taste buds. I think the only one we completely finished off was the Alaska but we regret nothing. 

We had a lovely chat with the Chef/Owner and were also charmed by our server - both of whom made us feel not only welcomed but almost as if we were family.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,0,0,4,sK1aPtTspwsd5mOqLXgMEw

I have never been treated so absurdly as a customer in an establishment. Ive always been polite and respectful to the people working here, because i work as a server too. I really tried to like this place because it was so close to my house and friends like to perform here, and I've given this place so many tries (and lots of  my $$$) but my last visit completely convinced me it was a waste. 

Upon entering and seating myself and my date, we were completely ignored by the staff for almost a FULL 30 minutes as they served the tables around us, completely ignoring our eye contact. I finally got up and asked the owner if we could get a menu, and he said that they're only serving 4 items right now. Very disappointing, but I understand. The business wasnt doing so well. That's fine. But I really didn't want any of the 4 items they had so I decided I should get a drink. 

Before deciding, a waitress came to our table, and offered water. Which she was going to charge $3.50 for, and left right in the middle of me speaking and saying ""oh, no thank y-"" so I ran up to her and told her that we didn't want any water to which she scowled and demanded ""why not?"" In such an aggressive tone that I was actually shocked.  I told her we were just leaving, to which, she scoffed at us and rolled her eyes. ( what the fuck, right?) Just before leaving, I was saying a quick hello to someone else I knew that I spotted having dinner in the corner of the restaurant, while I was saying goodbye, the same waitress came over and said ""you guys need to go away now. You got to respect what I'm trying to do here."" I responded that we were just saying goodbye and she said, and I QUOTE, ""you know this isn't a cafe. Our rules are a little bit different here.""  I was so angry I didn't even look at her and walked out. No wonder they're going out of business.

The crepe was the perfect light dessert as it was made with just some sugar & burnt butter. It was delicious. We also ordered a glass of moscato for me to continue my dessert moment & my man had a few beers. He randomly chose Thai beers and they were great.

I went with a friend and the owner came by, introduced herself with a very limp handshake and regaled us with the specials, both of which sounded good.  I'm pretty sure she only stopped by because I was laughing at the Moroccan crepe on the menu.  The description said it had a ""chicken and tajine stew.""  A Tajine is an earthenware cooking vessel in which you prepare stew, so to have it ""and"" means you'll be eating a cooking vessel (there's a few other items on the menu that make it clear they really have no idea what they're talking about).

When the waitress came by to take our order my friend chose the Chicken Provencal special and I chose the Pastrami special.  Neither of which the waitress was at all familiar with.  Luckily for her the Chef was right behind us.  Then the chef outright stated she had no idea what we were talking about.  Lovely.

The waitress goes on to helpfully state that the owner liked to come up with stuff on the spot.  Which is great if she's in the kitchen making it but not when she does it while glad-handing customers with no intention of conveying her ideas to her staff.   We asked a few more questions of the chef to see what she thought was what and my friend decided to play it safe and order off the regular menu, I stuck with the Pastrami special.

When the crepes arrived, fairly quickly, my friend's plate was overflowing with food while mine was very demurely folded into what looked like an empty crepe with some sparse decoration.   The pastrami was tasty but there wasn't much there, especially for $12 dollars. My friend said the Hawaiian wasn't bad but wasn't all that special.   Her crepe cost $14.  I wasn't that hungry that I needed a giant pile of food, but it makes them look bad that their portion sizes were so completely inconsistent, especially for the same table.

Seriously, this is the first time I have ever gone to a restaurant in my entire life where they did not serve ice water. So how exactly is the ice tea made? Just curious...

The waitress actually gave the guests a cup and told them to go fill their own tap water from the back of the restaurant. I wish this were a joke and if we were not waiting on a big group of people to show up, we would have left. I truly don't understand why this even had to be an issue. Of course some people at the table were upset when the waitress acted like this was normal and seemed surprised by the reactions she got.

Service: When it's slow like the first night I was there, the chef talked to us and informed us vegan options would be available during the weekend. The place didn't have menus...customers have taken them...
I return on the weekend for the market and stop by again. While waiting, a lady lines up behind me and the chef by passes me to take the lady's order behind me! 
While witnessing this, another lady in front of me asks for protein options, the chef then tells her ""you name it we got it!"" Not even a question like ""what kind of protein are you looking for?""
Finally I get up to order and she then tells me ""Monday I'll have the order/supplies in to make vegan crepes"" okay I'll wait till Monday.
I call before I go over, and she's not even sure if she has vegan items to make a crepe...""Tuesday my supplier will be here with the vegan batches""...so you don't make the batches yourself, yet charge a ridiculous price? C'mon!

2952855,2014-11-21,7,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"""Meh. I've experienced better."" sums it up nicely.

Located on the ground floor of the Tivoli Village 'Market', I had high hopes that The Crêpe would not disappoint and make the near 30 minute journey worthwhile.  Of course, this was not the case.  

Start to finish, this place is (and I'm being generous) two stars.  Upon entering, there's a sign that states ""please seat yourself"".  Fail number one; combining the seat yourself concept with inept servers leads to a guest sitting at their table for 20 minutes before being greeted.  One would think that the 20 minute wait would yield at least a glass of water; not so fast!  This restaurant does not have the ability to serve ice water...only their bottles of water.  What?!?!  I've been served a glass of water in a third world country, this is fucking Summerlin NV USA!  OK I'll play ball, ""I'll take an iced vanilla latte please"" I reply; not so fast again!  Are you kidding me!?! Guess what, they also don't have glasses to serve an iced vanilla latte in, only their Styrofoam to-go cups.  What finally arrived was a room temperature latte with no ice; I suppose the lack of a sink also precludes them from the ability to make ice.  Want plain ol' coffee?  Too bad, they don't have coffee, just fancy espresso-based drinks.

On to the food!  This is going to be amazing I think to myself; given the bold statement that this is THE CREPE, as stated right on the front door!

Two crepes were chosen: the Bologna and the France.  The France, which includes ham, eggs, farm(?) cheese, scallions, parsley, tomatoes and béchamel sauce was standard fare; it doesn't disappoint, but it also didn't wow me.  There was no discernible difference in flavor with the ingredients here, just a crepe stuffed with the above and the usual béchamel sauce.  The Bologna, which includes meat, red sauce and Italian cheese would have been OK if I knew that it wasn't going to be a crepe.  Let's explore this further:  the name of the business is The Crêpe and the Bologna is listed under their savory crepe section; it should be safe to assume that one would be receiving a crepe.  Well, not exactly; the Bologna is merely the cooked crepe batter with the meat and sauce slopped on top; more like lasagne than a crepe.

The service here was shitty; harsh but true.  No check back for another drink...maybe I'd like another room temperature latte. No check back after the meal was dropped...maybe there was a roach in my food (there wasn't), they wouldn't have known it however because they never came back to see how things were going.  Confidence in its purest form?  ""Our food is so great we don't need to bother ourselves with your opinion.""  Nearly 30 minutes pass by after the crepes were finished. Se il vous plaît, le chèque! Yah, I had to get up and go to the counter and request it, where I was met by a fairly combative owner who dismissed the few concerns that I brought to her attention.

I've lost count on how many times this place has failed.  Needless to say I won't waste my time driving up here again.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,11,6,2,ZoampE7VMkSEUQ13ti1y9g

3167862,2014-07-27,4,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"I'm not necessarily a crepe fanatic, but I do love a good one and being that Tivoli Village isn't that far from home, I've had The Crepe bookmarked since they opened. It's not hard to see the appeal of this place, especially when it comes to the atmosphere. You've got a nice little French inspired restaurant and for those with kids, they have this really cool little play area! The lighting is neat, the live music is a nice touch and it just has a cool ambience. I wasn't a fan of the tiny tables and uncomfortable seats though.

One of the biggest issues I have with this place was the service. They have a sign up front that says whether to seat yourself or wait to be seated. For whatever reason, the sign was pushed into a corner and since apparently customers don't get greeted at the door here, we kinda just stood there until I went over and asked someone if we could just seat ourselves. After we found a table, it took a good 10 minutes for a waitress to come over and take our drink order...but the drinks did came out fast and I love how they serve the iced tea in a carafe. So, we looked at the menus and after putting them away, ended up waiting another 15 minutes for a completely different waitress to come over and take our food order. The original girl who took our drink order had this complete look of disgust on her face and seemed to be pretty unhappy, so I'm actually glad it was a different girl. But apart from that, they rarely check on you during your meal and neither the restaurant or bathrooms were very clean. The same seemingly angry employee was resetting tables that hadn't been washed or had trash on the floors and chairs underneath it. They just seem way too unorganized here.

Moving on to the menu, they've got quite a few crepe selections including items for breakfast, lunch and dessert. One cool thing they offer is the ""Crepe Duo"" which gives you your choice of 1 savory crepe and 1 dessert crepe. For the prices though, I thought the portions were a bit small. Most people would probably easily be able to finish the Crepe Duo and at $23, it's a bit hard on the wallet. When you factor in a drink and tip, one person could ended up spending over $30 to eat here. For crepes? Eh, I don't know.

The crepes themselves were hit and miss for me. We ended up ordering 3 crepes to split between us...the Britain (bacons, eggs, potatoes, gravy), the Argentina (beef, peppers, onions, chimichurri) and the Austria (strudel, caramelized apple). The Britain was the smallest of the 3 with mostly eggs filling it and severely lacking in salt. With the Argentina, it had a bit more filling and the flavor was much better. While still a bit lacking in salt, and pepper too, the beef was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri sauce has nice, bold flavors with just the right hint of garlic. Sadly, the Austria was the worst of the 3 and just a complete let down. I'm not even sure how they managed to do so, but there was almost no flavor in the whole thing. You can taste the apples on their own but everything else was completely bland.

In my opinion, it's just okay and although the service was lacking, the ambience, iced tea carafes and the decent Argentina crepe is what pushed me to 3 stars. I won't be rushing back, but I'd give them another shot if it was in the mood for a crepe and didn't want to drive across town.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,6,4,3,b7RWAC1JixWfy208aaIUtA

I also ordered a glass of champagne (they have a very large selection of beer and wine, even sake!)
The live music was nice for atmosphere, and they kept the doors open but it didn't get hot at all inside. It was actually almost chilly.

There was live music as we entered but we immediately noticed there was only seating available toward the front.  For us the table right in the middle by the door was too cold.  It's unfortunate they cannot close the doors because it would make for a much more pleasant dining experience in the colder months.  A table closer to the wall and away from the doorway opened and we took it and that made it more comfortable.

We also had a two year with us so the kids play area was appreciated.  He occupied himself there almost the entire time and it was very visible from where we were sitting.

3937329,2015-05-23,0,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"So today we we strayed a bit from our typical Saturday trip to Tivoli Village for the Farmers Market and Breakfast at the Amazing Cafe Leone and decided to duck out of the sun and to checkout The Crepe. 

We had walked by it numerous times in the past but could never quite figure what it actually was a restaurant, Desert and Coffee shop or music venue? But the in-laws were in town and my Nephew loves Crepes so we decided to check it out. 

While my brother in law ordered a Crepe and a couple drinks at the counter we Sat-down in the Cafe style setup and waited for the food. 

A cordial waitress put some silverware on the table and a small plate of sliced fruit and asked if we would like drinks or anything else which we declined. Then it got a bit bizarre. While my nephew ate his Crepe a Crepe chef approached us to ask if we ordered food and then a manager approached 10 minutes later telling us they had a reservation in 15 minutes and needed the table. So after sitting for a max of fifteen min from the time we walked in the door ( at a Coffee and Dessert Cafe) we were basically asked to leave surrounded by a series of empty table tops. And the kids were good as gold so there were not any extenuating circumstances there.
So we left for a walk through the Boutique shops without ordering a couple Coffees for the walk or leaving a nice tip for the server which is our custom in this setting.

While I still have no clue what it is the Crepe is trying to be or was trying to accomplish in it's approach towards us. I do know it's an establishment we will not be frequenting again. And truly hope that the reason for their approach had everything to do with having a bad day and nothing to do with discrimination.",5P210NtHgQpHg2FTUTTlFQ,0,0,1,Z-14CUGui-vIPr0j8YDMHA

There was a sign to seat yourself and I went a few tables in from the open door.  It was a perfect place because you could enjoy the morning air but the breeze coming in wasn't overwhelming.

I was brought a menu by Agnes.  I later found out she was the owner.  After looking over the selection of breakfast crêpes, I went with the special of the day which was a crêpe with pastrami, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and Russian mustard.

The crêpe was very tasty.  The mustard absolutely made the dish, however.  It was a rich, spicy, brown mustard with a lot of favor.

As I was waiting for the crêpe to be made, Agnes came by and as we starting chatting, she sat down across the table from me and she explained that the restaurant had only been opened for two months.  We also talked about the music and dance evenings they have.  I think I need to go back for one of the jazz nights and have a dessert crêpe.

The crêpe was tasty and it was artfully presented.  As I said before, the mustard made the dish!  I will come back again.  I like the space and the ambiance.  The crêpes are a bit pricey, but then the rents for Tivoli have to be high, too!  A coffee Americano is $3 with a $1.50 charge for a refill.

After my first experience here, I was sitting on the fence. I loved the food and the restaurant decor. The effort you can see has gone into this business. But maybe it was the service I was unsure about. 

This time around I have to say i was quite impressed. As always the food is amazing, and well worth the trip. Service was ten fold better than the first time I was here.

I agree with another Yelper Sarah Jane, that even though Crepe is awesome, I think downtown would be the perfect fit for this business. So right now I'll suffer with it being so close to my house.

Extremely kid friendly, if you have little ones this is the perfect place for a bite to eat and a play area to keep the little ones occupied.

4142770,2014-01-24,9,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"I am really digging The Crepe!  Have you been yet?  Well, why not???

I noticed The Crepe the other day when I was in the mall.  I couldn't go then, but knew I had to give it a shot soon.  What really caught my eye was all of the things that The Crepe is involved in and promoting.  Who doesn't love a fun neighborhood joint that has Argentine Tango night, Live Jazz night, and even Story Time for the kids.  Yay for trying to get a community going!  

I noticed they have a great Mommy/Daddy & Me deal going on Monday-Friday 10-11am.  The deal is for every full sized crepe purchased, you get a free kid's sized crepe for your kiddo.  I love a good deal, especially a BOGO deal.  So I had to go and check this place out.

On our visit, we got there at 10am and were the only ones there, except for our friends we were meeting.  We were greeted right away by our server and he took good care of us the entire time.  He wasn't familiar with the BOGO deal, but we go that straightened out pretty quickly.   We had good service the entire meal and felt truly appreciated the whole time.  Our server even told us about all of the other fun stuff they do for kids there like the story time and puppet shows they do throughout the week.  He did a great job.  I wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out.

Now to the good stuff, the crepes!  There are so many options to choose from!  Everyone in any group is bound to find at least 1, if not a dozen they want to try.  On this visit I tried the breakfast France crepe.  It had eggs, ham, farm cheese, tomatoes, and béchamel sauce.  It was super duper yummy!  My daughter had the sweet USA crepe.  Her crepe was filled with pb&j with some sliced bananas thrown in the mix.  She hardly eats anything at all and she took down half of this in a few minutes.  That is crazy impressive for her!  There were about 15 other ones that caught my eye as well, so I see us going back often, especially for the BOGO deal!

I was also very impressed with the quality of the ingredients that are being used at The Crepe.  They try to use as much locally sourced items as possible for their menu.  The freshness of the food really comes through in the flavors you find in the crepes.   I love fresh food and helping to support our local farmers, as well as just having better quality food!

Speaking of going often, The Crepe offers as frequent visitor punch card.  I love punch cards and wish more places did this for their regulars.  The Crepe does it so every 9th crepe is free.  Not too shabby, if I do say so.
 
They also have a little play area for kids.  This is a fabulous idea because when you have toddlers, they just really aren't into eating.  I know my daughter usually takes 2 bites and is ready to go play.  With the kid's area being right by some tables, all of us adults can sit and enjoy our crepes and watch our kids play.  This way everyone is happy!  Thanks for thinking of us parents who really want to eat something beside drive thru all of the time when we are with our munchkins.

The only critique I would have for The Crepe is the drink selection.  I am a weirdo who doesn't like coffee, hot tea, or smoothies.  If you could add some regular soda to the menu, that would be great.  I almost always have a soda when I am out and about. I love soda just a smidgeon less than my kid, so help a girl out please! Even if it is just canned soda, I think it would be a great thing to offer your patrons. Please please please add some soda and I will be back even more often, PROMISE!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,9,8,4,3ySsgBigy5ATp0OD5hhXVA

I despise fake-ass Tivoli Village and its Botox Betty clientele, but this is a humble little jewel of authenticity in a sea of bourgeois poseury. The Crepe is the only locally-owned restaurant in the complex, basically a start-up run by a young couple, and the place has a definite Euro vibe that might alienate some Ricky Bobby types.   

A friend *INSISTED* I try this place, so I hitched up my wagons and forded the Summerlin Pkwy, journeying out to the wilds of upscale suburbia to see what all the fuss was. And I was glad I did!

Come to find out, a crepe is basically just a (tastier) tortilla, and can be stuffed with pretty much anything -- sweet or savory -- to make what amounts to a burrito. This place names each dish after a different country, so you can order crepes stuffed with Indian, Thai, Polish, Moroccan, Argentine, Bulgarian, Russian...almost ANY type of cuisine in the world! And that's just the savory ones -- they also have a shit ton of dessert crepes stuffed with fruit, chocolate, nuts, etc. 

I had the Greek (fabulous!!!) followed by the Europa (Nutella and fruit). I also had a few bites of my friend's Sofia (nuts and honey). REALLY good! I definitely plan to come back and try them all (except maybe the Scandinavian....ya know?!?!)

I see from the other reviews on here that a chief complaint is service. They only have a little tiny kitchen -- right in the open behind the counter -- so if the place is packed, I can see it taking some time to get your order. But guess what?!? It's a little startup, with a little kitchen and a little staff. This ain't Brio!! Cut 'em some slack!!!

Instead of getting your panties all twisted, chill the fuck out and enjoy the scene -- they have some form of live music or entertainment every night, from this smoking hot Italian opera singer dude to live jazz and tango. They also have a kids' play area and supplies for making art. What with all the interactive stuff and entertainment, the place has a real neighborhoody vibe -- when I was there a couple regulars dropped in just to say hi.

To be honest, I feel like this joint is a bit out of place here in Botoxlandia -- they would be a better fit downtown, where people aren't so fucking uptight. But, they're stuck in ToryBurchville...so I guess you could consider them a lone outpost of the real world, like a Mars colony.

My hursband and I shared a South Africa (lemon curd crepe) and word to the wise, they only have bottled water. They try to fancy it up your experience by giving you plastic wine glasses-- for water lol. The crepe was on the crispy side and it was the first time that I had ever had it that way. We first thought it was a mistake but if it was, it wasn't a bad one to experience, just different I guess. Usually crepes are airy and seem underdone so making it crispy give it a different texture (obviously) but it may appeal to some but for those accustomed to the airy kind of crepes, it's an odd thing to experience.

There was a live band playing and from what I heard they were young college kids who were all friends and just liked to play music. We were definitely impressed and our ears were smiling the whole time.

The owner came over and told us the special again. She asked if it was our first time there and we said yes. First time there, not first time having authentic crepes. She wouldn't leave us alone. Anytime we would answer her question by telling her what we were thinking about having, she would tell us that's not really what we wanted and basically that we wouldn't like it because we were American. I also really wanted the peanut butter, jelly, and banana crepe for dessert and she told me it was horrible and if we were going to have crepes we should have something better than that. She said she only keeps it on for the kids. Why not put it on the kids menu then? Little does she know I LOVE peanut butter and jelly and could eat peanut butter by the jar. Probably would have been the best thing ever in my book! She charges $13-$15 for a crepe and then criticizes your choice. When it came time for dessert, I wanted the Venezia, which is a cannoli crepe. She, again, came to the table to talk to us about dessert. She told me I probably wouldn't like the Venezia crepe because it's authentic Italian and they don't use a lot of sugar and that maybe I should get the Nutella crepe. Little did this rude and stuck up woman know, I'm Italian and my maiden name is in fact, Venezia. Long story short, the crepes were good, very overpriced, but good, and the owner is rude, condescending, pushy, and ruined the experience.

Friendly service, adorable ambiance, clean bathrooms, a little pricey for the quality of food. But remember: the cost of ambiance is built in the cost of the food and this place is located in Tivoli. 

I got the two-crepe combo, pick one savory and one sweet ($22.80) and I also got a macchiato ($3). The waiter alerted me: ""It's the real Italian macchiato."" Great! It was Lavazza. 

My savory crepe as the India (cheese, cauliflower, peas with yellow korma). It was tasty. I really liked the house crepe batter. They serve all of their crepes not wrapped up like a breakfast burrito, but more like they put the crepe spread open on your plate and then just cover it with whatever your desired ingredients are. 

For my sweet crepe, I got the Paris (European flan), which looked like albino diarrhea, but it was yummy. Super rich. Huge. I wouldn't advise eating one of these by yourself. Share with one or two more people. 

There is inside and outside dining. Indoors, there is a little art gallery (hobbyists) and a place for kids to play with plenty of toys, and the stairway up to the Market shops and restaurants.

The menu is comprised of sweet and savory options. Honestly, the menu was much more diverse and had more selection than I thought it would. Crepes are represented by country, so I had The Venezia ($10.90), which was an indulgent crepe with cannoli cream, black and white chocolate drizzles and chips, and a dollop of whipped cream. 

It was a yummy crepe and nice for dessert. However, the pricing is putting me off from returning. Perhaps if I'm in the area I may try a ""savory"" crepe next time.

Milano : fresh mozzarella, tomato basil and balsamic reduction. I noticed that the ingredients stand out more in a crepe . I typically have sandwiches made like this but the bread typically takes over. I loved swiping the remains of my crepe in the balsamic . Very tasty!

There is a variety of desert crepes you can pair with the duo. I always prefer anything with Nutella. The owners are very sweet. They expressed some interest in holding a Yelp event in their cafe. They were mentioning having different crepes from their menu passed around. It would be more of the international crepes. I told them they can get a hold of the Yelp community manger to set one up. 

I also love the scenery . I  like sitting by the big windows so I can people watch. When I look outside It doesn't even feel like I'm in Vegas!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,2,5,DLcZM8BQIr7Enm-KJxmEAA
4495614,2014-02-14,0,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"I had a pleasant evening here with a friend. We met the chef Agnus(or was it Angus? I'm sorry if it is a mistake), she was very knowledgeable in her business and was very kind to us. We had a crepe duo, one savory and one sweet. Our savory dish was the Morocco, as recommended by Agnus as something I've never tried. It was the most interesting flavor I've ever tasted in a crepe. It was sweet, tangy, and a little spicy all at the same time and very subtle. 

We had the Europa as our sweet crepe. It is filled with Nutella and fresh fruit. It was utterly delicious. The Nutella was not overwhelming and the fruit went well with it. The crepes were perfectly cooked. As the chef said, ""You cannot cut it with a fork, you must use a knife. If you can eat it with just a fork then your crepe is undercooked.""

We also had a Monaco(creme brulee) and it was the best creme Brule I've ever had in my life. Everything on it and in it all had its own special taste. I heard this was a popular dish here, and would highly recommend it. 

Their cappuccino was also very good too!! 
Not to mention we got some things on the house, but that is not why it was so great as not everyone reading this should go and expect it ;p but the reason why I mention it is that the people who work there know how to be impressionable. Not just the chef, the waiters and waitresses too.

hope you try try them out and enjoy your experience like I did!:)",ZDd4asPfshXeYZQCmR1ydg,3,3,5,h1QXSHFaY3_c8EcOQF4l8Q

1. They don't serve tap water, supposedly they are too small. 
2. If you can't, fine. Just don't charge me 1.50 for a small bottle of pure life.
3. Today, it seems they were only taking reservations before one o'clock.  Yet they had a sign that said seat yourself and the girl at the register said we could sit anywhere.
4. I think it was Alex the owner who was bussing tables and walked between people instead of around them the entire time. I am aware that the shortest distance is a straight line but don't make your guests uncomfortable by squeezing past me for no reason.
5. We shared the Britain.  It was a crepe filled with undercooked potatoes and bacon and decent eggs. Maybe I don't fully grasp the crepe thing but I would suggest that crisp bacon and cooked potatoes might be more appealing.
6. If I had one more person ask me if I wanted a desert after eating a breakfast crepe and not take no for an answer I would have screamed. They offered us a free father's day crepe when we got there and we said yes but they made us wait for something we DIDN'T ask for. 
7. One waitress we didn't know stopped to ask me about my walking dead shirt. She knew the show but only because her mom watches it. She informed us in quite a snooty fashion that she reads. Good for her.

Chef Agnes, what can I say? She was telling the people next to us that they were waiting so long because of the aforementioned reservation that was needed before 1 pm. Then she said it was miscommunication with the staff and that they should have never been seated and did they want some hot sauce because the crepe they ordered wasn't very flavorful.  I didn't just remember those things and put them in my own run on sentence, that is how she said it.

I have been to three highly recommended crepe places on Yelp. I don't get it I guess. However, the overall weirdness of this place reminds me of that Kitchen Nightmares in Arizona with the blonde and the old guy.....so they would have to make the best food ever to get more than one star.",SHykT53mky80zxsdeGmXcQ,4,2,1,mPOdSV56QdsoZ57vgAdvDg

It is small place which also has outside seating. The only complaint I had was the tables were about as big as the plates I usually eat off....I'm a big guy. I get it though...French. Petite furniture....lol. There was also a violinist and a guitar player playing some type of ethnic music. I did not inquire to what type of music they were playing.

The menu has a great selection of crepes and if you do not see anything you like, which I am sure will not happen, you can build your own crepe. There are crepes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desert. The crepes are named after different regions of the world that best represents the ingredients inside the crepe. I like the fact that they offer whole wheat, buckwheat, vegan, and white crepes.

We ordered the following and they were all equally excellent!! They were served with sides of almond pâté' and chili sauce. The almond pâté' was awesome!

-Mediterranean with a vegan wrap minus the cheese. - Mushrooms, red peppers, tomatoes, spinach, and broccoli.

-Brenton - A crepe wrapped around fresh berries and topped with agave syrup.

-The Florida - A crepe filled with Key Lime and then toped with crushed graham crackers, Key Lime sauce, and fresh whipped cream. ****My Favorite****

5 crepes
2 coffees
1 orange juice
3 bottled water

We came on a Saturday night and they had a fantastic Jazz quartet - they were honestly excellent musicians.
The ambiance is really cute. Super open, airy, European, chic, and trendy. I loved the fact that they had an open children's play area. we have little ones so that is a definite plus in my book. 
The waitresses that helped up were both very sweet and pleasant.
When our Venezia crepe was brought out to us it looked delicious...if only the taste of it agreed with the presentation of it. 

The Venezia description was ""cannoli cream, black and white chocolate."" My husband and I both love cannolis, but if your hoping for something that tastes anything like a cannoli you will be sorely disappointed. The filling was curdy and rather runny, the white chocolate chips on top tasted super cheap, and the crepe itself had a strange lemony flavor that did not at all belong. We both took about 5 bites and tried to talk ourselves into liking it, but in the end just couldn't do it... Definitely a waste of $9. 

That being said.... because of the great live Jazz and the children's play area we will probably be back and get something safe like a tea or milkshake....",D5_r1GN1Jd2REoRjsRaWHg,3,3,3,NEtq2M9tEGNFOz_d0FUZIw

Thankfully, ""The Crepe's"" savory portions are a bit larger than others I've had in the past.  I'd still probably need the second one, but at least I don't feel hungry immediately afterwards eating only one.

The reason I am giving the extra star was due to the Mommy/Daddy & Me deal, where the little ones get a FREE crepe (sweet or savory) just half portioned.  This lets Little Foodie and me eat relatively well for a fair price!

We tried the Germany ($10.50): Bratwurst, Sauerkraut, Pickles, Green Onion & Mustard Sauce. Interesting combination, but it works well! Good size and pretty filling considering it's a crepe lol. 

Italy ($9.80): Cured Prosciutto, Scrambled Eggs, Italian Cheese, Tomatoes & Pesto Sauce.  A bit less filling than the Germany, but I enjoyed the flavors here.

Europa ($6.50 Kid's size): Nutella & Fruit. Just like it sounds...with plenty of Nutella hiding inside!  Some places are a bit stingy with the goods, but they LAYER Nutella in there :)

Would be worth checking out if you are in the area, esp with a little one!  Right next to the park, so let the little ones work off that sugar when you're finished :P",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,2,2,4,Q8eD-pqizXYfRlcAvvGT-A

The server who invited me inside as I was checking out the menu by the door was very friendly and attentive, the place is pretty, and I love that the Market offers free wifi. I needed to get some work done on my laptop. It was a good place for that. 

After I saw that the crepes were out of my price range for today, I decided to order a tropical fruit smoothie. They couldn't tell me what exactly was in it. I was thirsty and I like tropical fruit, so I didn't care that much. I'm sure it was probably the same frozen bag I usually get from Trader Joe's with pineapple/mango/strawberries/bananas. I asked them to make it with soy milk. I wasn't disappointed with the taste, it was pretty much exactly what I expected. 

But the portion?! I will let the picture speak for itself. Seven dollars and some change, after tax. I saw an employee replying to other reviews, trying to justify the high prices by saying that they ""favor organic produce."" Cool, me too. That's how I know that for the same price, I could go into Whole Foods (couple minutes away from here) and get SIXTEEN ounces of smoothie, know every fresh not frozen ingredient in there, and if I wanted to get twelve ounces, I could even add some bee pollen or protein and it would be the same price as the child-size one that I got. At least cut the straw so it's proportionate to the smoothie cup. 

It's an okay place. Very nice ambience, and friendly service. I probably still won't be back. I can't comment on the food besides it smelling delicious and looking nice, but if you're thinking of getting a smoothie while you're there, that's what you can expect.",DA-Lh4PyrYR9EnZkwdElPw,3,1,3,QOJfKAcrpu5Tv4YZKU0AkA

Finally, a server noticed me and asked me what I wanted to drink, and since I was there for a while looking over the menu I knew which crepes I wanted to try. Well I didn't read the small print and on the menu it shows certain times you can get the trio..and I wasn't there around the right time.

Yes, you can get big portions and fast service (with a hectic environment!) at a place like Egg Works.  This place has a European feel to it.  The food was carefully prepared, right down to the side of fruit that was nicely presented.  The coffee is excellent (espresso beverages and large selection of dairy-free creamer options if you don't drink milk).  They have great entertainment (jazz some evenings, some open mic and comedy others, puppet shows and story times for kids in the afternoons, classical music on Sunday mornings).  The owners here clearly understand that eating out is an experience.  I will agree with other reviewers that it took a while for our food and one order came out of order (people who arrived after us, a smaller party, got their food first), but I really enjoyed lingering here.  I enjoyed my coffee, , the music, and actually being able to talk to my husband while my kids quietly played in the kids' area.  It was a pleasant place to hang out while eating, which I love!  I guess my advice based on the other reviews and my experience would be don't come if you are starving and/or in a rush to get somewhere or if you are a very impatient person.  But this place is perfect for catching up with a friend or enjoying a relaxing weekend brunch, or if you are dining alone and want to catch up on work, a book, or e-mail.  There aren't many places in Vegas like this.  

As a mom, my first favorite thing about this place is that they have a nice little play area towards the back for kids - blocks, a little train building thing, board games, puppets, paper/crayons, etc.  Awesome!  It was wonderful to let my little ones play quietly while I relaxed and enjoyed the live classical music for Sunday Brunch!  Normally eating out with my kids is kind of stressful and frustrating, but I had my best meal in a restaurant with my kids today because of how they laid this place out in a thoughtful way for families.  My kids aren't badly behaved, but like all kids, they have a low tolerance for sitting around with nothing to do.  They clearly designed this place with that in mind, so that parents can relax and children are content (which means children are quiet and less annoying to patrons without kids).",eArDc4Z-1oM1NirhGRlk0A,2,2,4,ZhN4E4J1hkeFzB14sVmw8A

It did take a bit for the crepes to come out, so if you are looking for instantaneous food you will probably be disappointed.

I could write on and on about their unknowledgable servers, lack of products (lemon, water, creamer - to name a few) and filthy restrooms but I'll spare myself the agony and awful memories.",rE7aqdRKNrN6cg8bHHvfhA,1,0,1,Eup_OvD_i8fC-klD9bunSA

Loved the decor and feel of Europe, however we were very disappointed with the quality of the crepes. I've been enjoying crepes for more than 20 years and was taught by a very good friend of mine to make crepes at home (French style). We'd seen this restaurant and really  were eager to give it a try. Service was pretty slow. Our order was not complete, so we had to ask the server to cancel a soup since we were almost finished out meal. We were told by our server that the chef was giving her a hard time in the kitchen. When we finally went up to pay for our meal, which no one ever came over to tell us that we needed to see the cashier. However, we did not receive a bill. So, we assumed the server was coming back to complete everything. When we signaled to a waiter, he explained that we needed to go to the cashier to pay. Our server was not visible and the cashier explained that she was given the task to help us at the last minute. Too many excuses for shortfalls.",utZdZNv82NHQh3sfYwsMWQ,2,0,2,To27KcaDUVGgCmHJCS2N0g

We shared a breakfast crepe called the Switzerland which was delicious with broccoli, asparagus, carrots, and cheese. Really moist and tasty! We also split the dessert crepe titled Venezia! Luscious chocolate, and cannoli creme. Very rich! Very busy place so service was meh, but I would come back!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,1,1,4,UNcCxMTLNUYoRMkUNomytA
5752754,2014-07-21,0,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"Wow, first time posting a review in forever!  I've had a grand change in my life with new work and new town, and of course bunch of new restaurants to try!  I had all the intentions to catch up on all the reviews for the past 6 weeks or so, but then it became too many and now I've given up on that.  So now that I don't have to worry about that, I'm starting with today!  My first is an adorable big place called The Crepe in Tivoli Village.

There is so much to like about this place besides the food.   Will critique the food separately, but will bullet-point the rest:

 - The adorable, highly talkative owner Agnes
 - The special events every day and evening (readings, DJs, guests, tastings, you name it)
 - Big place with spacious room between seatings
 - In Tivoli, a very cool place
 - Absolutely divine crepe pancake that is light and paper thin
 - Fresh ingredients, many from local vendors, Agnes said
 - Not just a restaurant - I didn't pay attention too much but they have books, gifts, retail foods, etc.
 - Reasonable prices for an upscale feel (in a way)
 
Only thing I wasn't crazy about is the price of the beverages - high with no real choice for more reasonable quaffs.  Now, the food.

I had the France crepe, with ham, eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and parsley.  First of all, the crepe wafer is divine - light and paper thin, with slight crunchiness on the edges and soft in the middle.  It was just perfect.  The sauce was delicious, sort of bernaise-like but with a hint of sweetness that was ideal.   The taste was a bit peculiar, however.  Although they didn't mention it, there was a distinct taste of sage which I didn't think went well with the rest.  It overpowered the other flavors.   As a result, I wasn't in love with the overall flavor and this is the reason they don't get a 5-star rating.  But I can't wait to try the sweet crepes, which are what I really love anyway.  Tougher to mess that up on the inside on these and the wafer itself is divine, as I already mentioned.  That should make for a fabulous breakfast, and I'm DEFINITELY coming here on a weekend morning and ordering one of their sweet crepes and a cup of (again, expensive) joe.  That might cause me to bump this place up to a 5.

Table-for-1 Factor:  This is another big like for me.  Perfect for a solo guest to enjoy with their coffeehouse-like feel.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,1,0,4,Bb7TBgAnflzxwhTMwMG1rQ

5774245,2014-03-19,2,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"I would actually rate this 3.5 stars. I stopped in one morning because, well, I love crepes. I was excited since this is pretty close to where I live. I rolled in early around 930am and was one of only a couple customers. The owner Agnes, a very nice lady, seated me and ordered me a coffee. Her refrigerator was having issues and the servicemen were there looking perplexed. 
She was also training a new waitress, so it was a little bumpy as far as service but that stuff doesn't bother me. We had a nice conversation regarding how difficult it is to find good employees. 
I had the USA sweet crepe, which is basically peanut butter and jelly, with bananas, or so I thought. No bananas came with mine, so maybe I had to request them. It was pretty good, very thin crepe. I wasn't overwhelmed by it. I think it was about $8, and the coffee was $4. 
I""m sure I'll be back, at least to sample the entertainment at night plus one of the savory crepes. They do have a nice menu with lots of variety. 
I wish the place success, and Agnes success. Tivoli Square has been rough on a number of restaurants, and other than happy hour at Kabuki I usually don't even go there anymore because there's just not much going on.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,2,2,3,xej4o0oSACxFqwnmvvIfBQ

The owner, Agnes, is what makes this place unique. She comes to your table and interacts with you. She also is willing to accommodate any tastebuds upon request. Sage was our waitress. She was very friendly. This is going to be one of my new favorite places in Vegas. The service, interaction, and food this place offers is hard to find. Thanks for everything, Agnes and Sage.",-gzqF2ucnXwHf64_k2Hoxg,0,0,5,4IuYvgrNzw5COytj-i5rkQ

5883101,2014-08-30,0,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"I went here with my husband, we both love crepes and were happy to have a place to eat it close to home, since we love those from Jean Philippe but it's too far from our house. Disappointment is the word. We ordered a regular coffee, they said they just have expresso, so she suggested the americano for $3, I don't like to be pushed, but ok. Then my husband ordered two glasses of water and they said they don't have tap water, only mineral because they don't have a filter for water, so how to they do their juices? To finish, the salmon crepe was good but the apple one completely tasteless. So, nothing good at all. Won't go back and don't recommend it.",cGY3BfrfJZLH3l3ETTQzeg,0,0,1,7SllX6mbZQ3Y_6_gz8zQKA
5885001,2014-02-24,1,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"I was pretty excited to try The Crepe's gluten free option but when the waitress told me the batter was buckwheat I decided against it. Buckwheat ins't what I would be using to make a crepe. If they try Gluten free Bisquick or use cup 4 cup maybe I'll return. Luckily for me the farmers market was going on so I was able to get a fresh smoothie from one of the vendors. 

 My mom and sister however tried two of the breakfast crepes. They took a little while to come out and both left saying their crepes were.... ""interesting"" and dont think they will be returning anytime soon. 

My Mom had the FRANCE - ham, eggs, farm cheese, scallions, 
chopped parsley, tomatoes topped with béchamel sauce. Her crepe was swimming in the bechamel which had no taste at all. 

My Sister on the other hand had the CANADA - Canadian bacon, egg, potato hush and maple syrup topped with toasted oats crunch. Her's was swimming in maple syrup.

I really hope this place makes it but based on what I saw on Saturday, It doesn't look to promising.",AQqOzSNf_5rmmOPxGgqSJw,4,1,2,2AeYznyvZlKp_A3QOg4KbA

The crepes themselves are okay. Not great, not bad. A little pricey, but I can tell the ingredients are fresh. 

They do have both savory and sweet crepes. I got the ""France"" crepe, which had yummy goat cheese, ham, scallions, eggs, tomatoes, and covered w/ bechamel. Flavor was okay, but like I said, not the best ever.",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,2,1,3,dnADgFdUHlh9jW8HQSxR5w

5990191,2013-11-27,4,9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,"My husband and I really like this place! We were very excited to try it and glad we did! The chef is very friendly, we have had many conversations with her. She really puts her heart into this place!

I read some of the other reviews and yes, it's true, when they first opened they did not have much decor and did not have enough menus - no big deal! I go to a restaurant for food and for the experience, not the decor! The decor is coming along and they now have enough menus. They just opened and sometimes when a restaurant first opens, it's a little disorganized. 

I have tried several of their crepes - from sweet to savory. I prefer savory to sweet so I have tried more of the savory options. All have been tasty! The only critique is regarding the Indian Curry Style crepe - I feel like it should have had more spice! Or at least the option to add spice. 

I support this The Crepe because it is a wonderful concept,  they use locally grown food and they have plenty of options for people with dietary restrictions (gluten free, Vegan). Also, the food is GOOD!",QiTUXljbTIqcuzOS4iS4hg,6,4,4,H1O4bcktee0ujCSOwrzn_Q
