As a visitor in town, we chose this place because it seemed ro have the simplest menu.
Horrible service and food. Felt like we walked into somewhere we were not welcome or expected. I ordered Mapo Tofu and I was told I would be charged for rice, and if I wanted a small dish of steamed vegetables, I had to order a vegetable entree costing 12$. 
The mapo tofu cause some kind of nasty reaction in my mouth that made the ice water (which we had to ask for mid meal) taste fizzy and tart. I do not know what they did, but I was afraid to eat more. I had  a total of 6 bites and stopped eating. I did not feel my concerns would be understood or taken care of, so I  paid and left.",WUYHIup4CuNQMuV8iqGEOg,1,0,1,ey4xXY9ViHr6HRpBKV8MwA

I have never tasted something fried that tasted like it was deep-fried in Old motor oil! That's the only way that I can describe it to you,  it was basically inedible!
Just gross! 
The sauce was incredibly sweet with no sour balance. They do not make an effort here and they definitely do not change the fry oil on a regular basis. That I can tell you for sure! Tough, chewy nasty tasting drowned in over sweet MSG filled sauce. I almost threw up! At least the rice was good and the green tea was good. My advice, stay very far away from this place!

I love chinese food been to sooo many different restaurants this has been the worst. First of all the place smells so bad. Place was empty. NO type of decorations the old lady that sat us down and took our order was soooooo rude. Like cmon why the attitude and long face you've been doing nothing all day because the restaurant is dead. I had to get up walk to her to order our drinks because she only took our entrees order. I had to get a High chair myself because she obviously forgot (i dont get how) when we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant. I had to tell her if they had Soy sauce/ chili... Nasty food the chow mein was so hard it needed more cooking, sesame chicken was alright and beef brocoli was disgusting tasted sour like it had orange/lime juice wth mann. &&& the plate are sooooooo expensive for a smalll tiny portion. I think we couldve ate at PF changs (small portions) but delicious food. She also charge us 15% for service wtf smh. Well obviously right because with the terrible terrible service nobody leaving her a damn tip so she has to charge it on the receipt. You got us good there lol.

600915,2015-10-25,1,_28WWtPWNYlxzl-GY9Gvog,"Living in Texas, I have yet to find a decent xiao long bao place that meets my standard, so I decided to hunt for it during my Vegas trip. Despite reading the low reviews mostly for bad service, my family and I decided to give this place a try. It was Spicy City's darn tempting poster that caught me! 

The ""highlight"" of the experience was that absolutely NO ONE spoke English. I called ahead and the lady could not answer a simple yes/no question. She told me that her English wasn't very good, then we awkwardly hung up the phone. When we arrived, our waiter also didn't speak English. The waiter kept speaking Mandarin to me. I could understand bits and pieces of what he said and made effort to order a rack with the little Chinese Mandarin I knew. The waiter scoffed at me and scold me in broken English for not knowing Chinese when I'm ""Chinese"" and I kept telling him ""I'm NOT Chinese"" both in Mandarin and English. My brother joked, ""if no one speaks English, then who did the paperwork??"" To top it off, he's screaming ""Amigo! Amigo!"" to his worker while madly waving his arms and throwing crazy sign language at him. 

Aside from that, the pork xiao long bao served its purpose! It was juicy and the broth was tasty. Not the best I had compared to Joe's Shanghai in NY, but it satisfied my craving. It beats most  so called ""xiao long bao"" from other restaurants where the broth has been absorbed into the dumpling and there's no drop of soup coming out. This place gets an EXTRA star for decent xiao long bao!

In conclusion, I now understand why Spicy City deserved its low ratings for service. I found the experience to be more HILARIOUS and MEMORABLE than anything. It makes an entertaining story I can tell over and over to my Chinese friends. Although I only had xiao long bao, the food here seemed authentic as I see mostly Chinese families and Chinese tour buses eating here. I highly recommend coming in with someone who speaks Mandarin or at least having a Mandarin speaking friend on FACETIME to order for you. Hopefully, you won't get scolded for not speaking Chinese or even meeting halfway and trying your damnest to communicate!! But Jayzzuss!! Please take the wheel!!",5Bl9O0f_xWUro-F1gCpORw,1,0,2,_-vKzUkBtamMzYCrftDLKQ

3403682,2014-08-23,2,_28WWtPWNYlxzl-GY9Gvog,"My family is from New York City and we were DYING for some rice. (We asians love our rice) We were driving around Chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the Chinatown Plaza caught our eye, so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurants. 
Nothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw Spicy City. It was pretty empty inside, only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant, a very friendly and jolly man, popped his head out and says ""please! come try out the food! it's amazing, my wife cooks it!"" 

This man did not lie. We had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup. Everything was delicious, and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family. However, the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isn't very good at eating spicy foods, tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this restaurants lives up to its name. 

I recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night!",0plkofNRjn29JJvGSB9z3Q,0,1,5,qSi7cRhp17fXMramAFrrig

We ordered the second plate of that buns, the owner told us only the first is served with the special offer. The food their is small portion but expensive.

5441066,2018-05-27,0,_28WWtPWNYlxzl-GY9Gvog,"Went in here for the lunch special. Portions were tiny. Orange chicken tasted like Dawn dish soap and each chicken piece was about 1/4 inch. 

Minced pork noodle dish had tiny bits of meat. Small enough to maybe fill the bellies of the four inch family members of the film, 'The Borrowers', and that's just an assumption.

The pork was mixed into a kiddie sized portion of Cellophane noodles, that appeared to be sauteed in regular soy sauce and sprinkled pathetically w/ bits of green onions. First bite is a shocker, but then cognizant dissonance kicks in, and you convince yourself that it's 'alright. . . I guess.'
