1612442,2017-05-14,4,cZBCVzd4lg_jx8IiFz-Iag,"Whipped in here while running errands for bathroom & burger. Bathroom first.

There's a sign on the men's room door: ""Men's Bathroom broken, sorry for the inconvenience."" Or something like that. Looks as though the sign has been in place for quite some time.

OK, there's no room for error here, I need to take care of #1 business pronto, so I peek into the ladies' room. The coast is clear. There's no lock on the door. Well, if a lady opens the door, she's going to clearly see me standing at the toilet, with my back facing her. She'll figure it out and wait outside until I'm done. And I'm going to be done & gone in 90 seconds anyway. 

So no harm, no foul.

Or so I thought.

Mid-stream, in darts the store manager, a short, quite-stocky young woman. 

Apparently she saw me head into the ladies' head - - and she's come in to investigate. 

The manager says ""You can't be in here."" I say ""Well you don't have a men's room. And it's a little late for me to be walking out now."" 

Then the manager says ""You are disrespecting women by being in here."" 

AHA! NOW we are at the crux of the manager's concern. Political correctness. 

This manager thinks it's unfair for a lady to have to wait her turn under these circumstances. (As if people in this world have never had to wait their turn for a bathroom.) 

Oh no, being a man, I should just go wet myself in the middle of the restaurant - rather than POSSIBLY cause a lady to have to wait her turn. It's not men & women equal - in her mind, it's women above men. This attitude may also explain why this manager hasn't bothered to fix the men's toilet in the first place.

But the sword of political correctness always bears a second edge - for those who know how to use it.

I say ""But I AM a woman. I am a pre-op transgender woman. Who just happens to be dressed as a man today.""

Silence. Utter, glorious, satisfying silence. 

I finish my b-room business and leave for the counter, while the manager remains, her brain seized up by the endlessly-looping, MÃ¶bius-strip logic of my response. 

When I get outside, both the young girl at the register and the guy cooking in the back are both rolling with laughter. Apparently they heard it all. And apparently they are sick of working under a manager toting this kind of attitude. 

I get my two-double-cheeses-in-a-poke and leave. The burgers, btw, were AOK for a Carl's. And the girl threw me a 10% discount.

Thank goodness I don't live anywhere near this neighborhood; I'll never have to return to this joint again.

OK Ms. Manager, here's the straight-talk:

It's the law. You serve food, so you are required to have working bathrooms. So fix the d@mn bathroom. And then you won't have men causing women to suffer these supposed indignities. 

And if you can't figure out how to fix the bathroom - - then get your butt over to Home Depot, spend $2 out of petty cash and buy a manual bolt-action door lock and screw it onto the inside of the door. Then make a sign that says ""Unisex Bathroom"" to stick on the outside of the door.

As we're sitting there I glanced over and noticed how dirty the walls were, the windows, and the doors.  I know it's an older place, but you can still clean it every 10 years.

Tip to management: you are running your floor thin and understaffed. You may not have a lot of hours to use cause of a slow location. But experience of customers is key.

Our family will never visit this or any other Carl's Jr. establishment...
To whom it may concern:
It is with great concern I write you today with the story of our experience in one of your restaurants.
My friend, my brother and I visited the Carls Jr. in the Lakes of Las Vegas NV on 4-27-18 at around 6pm. We all ordered our food for ourselves and paid underÂ one ticket. My Â brother who is disabled with Cerebral Palsey ordered a low carb burger with no cheeseÂ as he cannot digest wheat or dairy. We go to our table and wait, our food comes and my brother opens his food to find both a bun and cheese. He pointed it out and then scraped them off and ate the burger and veggies. Later when my brother got up to go to theÂ restroom and the Manager asked him, how everything was. My brother is very shy and introverted so to my surprise he told her about the mix up on the order, to which her response was ""well you ate it all didn't you?"" Then she said ""what is it some kind of diet?""Â He said No, Hes messed up and she said ""honey, we all are"". then she mumbled some other stuff. My brother proceeds to the restroom and she comes over and says ""is he okay in there, does someone need to do a wellness check?"" I told her he was fine and he just takes a little while.Â 
The sole reason I write you this letter is because my brother got his feelings hurt. I am over here trying to encourage him to have a voice. to talk to people, to engage and your employee who represents your company both belittled and berated him. It is myÂ opinion that your manager receives some constructive critiquing on etiquette and manners.Â 
Thank you for your consideration
