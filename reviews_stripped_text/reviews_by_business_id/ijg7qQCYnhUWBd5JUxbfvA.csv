62117,2014-01-20,0,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"This review is looong overdue. I had the pleasure -I use this term loosely- to visit Roxy's Diner during my Stratosphere Hotel stay during mid-March 2013. My cousin and I went to the Casino floor to hit up Starbucks then venture over to a food place for some midnight munchies. Gosh it sucks to be 18y.o and in LV; so many restrictions. Anywho, we arrived at Roxy's around 11:30pm and the hostess came and sat us by the kitchen. Our waitress didn't come to our table for ten minutes. It wasn't even half-max capacity in all of the diner. More like fifteen people who were already served.
The waitress finally comes with the gnarliest attitude known to man and takes our orders. We get two cheeseburgers and onion rings to split. Let's fast forward THIRTY MINUTES later: my cousin and I are sitting there at the kitchen counter waiting for our food. I had Goshly patience that night because my cousin was about to blow a casket. Appartently the sh*tface waitress never put our order in!!!! What the f......? The chef who had seen us sitting there like two big barneys on his way to and from his break saved the night. He politely re-took our order, gave us a fifteen minute wait time, then proceeded to hook us up Thank You Bob. Our burgers and onion rings were superb and The Chef gave us an order of shrimp with french fries *on the house*. All the food was delicious (we ate in our room).
Whats hilarious is the fact the waitress finally came back with a check in her hand and plopped it down on the counter. Succubus. But I digress. I tipped The Chef for all his kindness and this little experience didn't deter my Roxy's adventures that happened the next day *wink, wink*. We'll leave that one for next time.

What you can take away from this overdue review: be patient, very patient. You'll never know who will come save the day. Also, screw that waitress.",m6jVNutUQfdvbkZ-lbwEVg,1,0,3,ano30ioujtgOl5dZqoG-9w

124330,2013-07-09,1,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"Roxy's is '50s themed all the way from the music, outfits to the decor complete with awful reflective walls and ceiling. Did any places in the '50s actually get built to this extreme or has this look become an over-exaggerated cartoon version of what we think the era to be? The open kitchen is a cross between a Fatburger and Johnny Rockets, the restaurant is a mix of everything you could ever think of. It is filled with almost all 4 person booths, along with a few loose tables for larger groups. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) I didn't get to witness any of their singing which supposedly happens here. Still it is definitely not quiet in here as the music drowns out pretty much any sort of conversation you may want to have. Their menu features pretty much any item you could possibly think of for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert at any time of day. Within this menu are many options for burgers, including the more recently hyped Claire Sinclair's Sin City Burger to commemorate her new burlesque show in the property, which is a half-pound burger with a fried egg, pepper jack cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions.

What came out initially looked decent, but turned out to be a mess. The huge, dry vacuum of a bun sucked any moisture and flavor from this burger the entire time. The large pre-formed and probably frozen patty had good char flavor upon first bite, but that char quickly turned to a bitter flavor and wasn't that great the rest of the way. It was cooked a little too much for medium rare, which was probably ok given the quality, and still managed to make a large mess on my plate and hands even though it came off as very dry throughout my meal. The fried onions were cold upon arrival, and not much better than the premade generic ones you get for your typical green bean casserole dish on thanksgiving. The 'caramelized' onions were your typical pan fried onions, not very caramelized but had ok flavor. The egg was non-existent, as were the mushrooms; I pulled one out to try on its own and it had decent flavor. The lettuce and tomato were decent, if maybe a little light compared to the mass amount of everything else. Overall this tasted like nothing but dry bun with a bit of onion flavor. Not really sure what all the local bloggers and press people were raving about, but maybe if I was staring at Claire while eating this I might like it more too?

The fries were awful; almost approaching room temperature, and of your basic frozen variety complete with a stale oily flavor. And if the meal was barely tolerable, it took a solid 7 minutes of me staring at my empty plate with a crumpled napkin on top and empty glass of iced tea before anyone acknowledged me again to get my check. But I guess going anywhere in the lovely Stratosphere, let alone a crappy '50s diner, you're not coming for ambiance or excellent service despite what its visitors have to say online. And apparently you're not coming here for a decent burger either. My burger and iced tea came to a completely unreasonable $17.27 for what I got, and I couldn't recommend avoiding it any more. Now that the Top of the World restaurant took the burger off their menu, I'm not really sure what your burger options are within the property, but I'm not really sure what you're doing there anyway.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,4,0,1,uHSlaCIXh_9CjNDBjr47cQ

We were highly entertained by the staff, and they had some talent too LOL.My husband and I stumbled on this place on a valentines weekend trip to LV. I had already had the ""steakhouse"" experiance, and other fine dinning experiances on this particular trip, and was a lil worn out that particular night. We went in there, and were seated fairly quickly (even for a holiday weekend) I don't recall exactly what I ate, but I believe it was in the burger/fries/shake area, and I was totaly impressed. Good portions, and good food. Like I said, it's a diner in the stratospher in vegas, I didn't expect it to be the most amazing food on the planet, but it was great! What really got us was how fun it was, and the singing/dancing, and a very ""on it"" wait staff.
Kinda reminded me of a cross between a Happy Days episode and Jonny Rockets! I sent my mom and grandmother to try it out on one of their trips down there too, and both had a blast, and loved the old music they grew up with. Plus also agreed, food was pleasant, and good portions.

Classic 50's Diner 

Located at the Stratosphere 


Intentions to eat at the buffet I've made my way back to Roxy's Diner! 

What can I say? It has an open atmosphere which I find very welcoming.

Waiting to be seated is but a couple minutes.

We've made our way in and is guided to the outside patio where we enjoyed the casino scene.

What first caught my eyes were the wings and I had to try it; the Classic Club Sandwich is also a go...+Monterey Grilled Club Sandwich.
   I ordered an apple martini which was the generous enough to walk over to Roxy's Bar to grab for me. 

The martini arrived first and oh it was delicious! 

The food is exceptionally a fair amount and the price is right.

It doesn't matter what hotel you stay at; it never hurts to walk the entire strip! Try out their food! You may be surprise along the way.

I am back in California today, but man my heart is at Roxy's Diner!

SERVICE

Outstanding service In a town of service is saying a lot. What are my metrics you ask?

1.  Not intrusively-frequently asking if you are ok every 5 minutes, while anticipating your needs;
2.  (Relatedly) Not waiting for my water glass to be filled;
3. Fixing any issue professionally and quickly;
4. Knowing the menu and offering advice honestly

The wait staff are not only vibrant and seemingly genuine in their care and service of the customer, they often sing extemporaneously and some actually perform a full song live (when their service permits it)

What fun! 

All amazingly good voices too- (way better than the band the casino employs). And although it would be nice to hear a strong female voice once in awhile, Hoss, Slim, and Ike are awesome!

FOOD

As a 24 hr 50's style diner they offer some really tasty stuff- here's some of my favorites:

Green Apple Jalapeño Coleslaw
Reuben Panini Style
USDA Prime Phill
Club Wrap
Traditional BLT Wedge
Claire Sinclair's Sin City Burger
Classic Tijuana Caesar Salad (w/chicken)
Carved USDA Prime Flat Iron Steak and Eggs
Any malt

I have found no bad choices and all portions are large enough for anyone.

The only advice I have for guests (and preparation staff- please read this)- watch the oil/grease.

I have spent orders of magnitude more on meals in Vegas, as well spent most of my life in NJ and NY. (land of the diners) and can say this is quite a find.

1620315,2011-10-25,1,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"To what others may find is a rose among thorns, I'm still trying to sift through the dirt on this one.  The food is average and the service is quick but it's something about it that hits a nerve with me.

Let's begin.

One staff member will seat you, another take your drink order, another brings it, another takes your food order, the person who took your drink order brings the food, the person that sat you refills the drinks all while two different managers come during the duration of it all.

I'm tired.

Mashed potatoes are good and so are the fries, mhmm.

The chili wasn't good.

Chopped salad, do you really have to make it only edible with a spoon? That's how tiny everything was; that's my biggest concern.  I was spoon feeding myself a salad.  I get it, I ordered it chopped.. but even the chicken wasn't forkable.  The salad was good, just with a spoon, that was a first.

Las Vegas tap water, I'm not a fan.

I guess sodas/other beverages are refillable.

That was not a Boston Cream Pie.

It's sort of expensive for what seems to be cheap and it's not for the experience, probably because they need to pay the rent.

Oh they let ACE card holders in first, haha like it's some sort of VIP thing.  Well, yeah I guess it is but that is just funny to me.

Décor was bright and I guess retro was what they're going for.  A 50's style diner, it's really bright and open and they have ""outdoor"" seating which is still in the hotel but it's weird to explain.  It holds a dirty feel to it I think because it looks very tacky. 

A cool part of it is that they have the staff sing a song every so often, one girl was really good. Roxanne I think it was.. oh! And their names aren't their names; it's their stage name, when the audition the managers pick a name for them if they get hired, something neat about them or what-not.  That's neat.",fxqvyXlml4400BglsxRG_w,0,0,3,_1ez828TqbS4Yg5hEMN7LA

A few minutes after we gave our order the server came by again asked what we wanted. She had forgotten she already took our order. I chalked that up to bring late at night (2 am). The onion rings were amazing as were the fries. The club sandwich was nothing special. I scraped off the avocado for two reasons. One I don't like it and two it doesn't go on a classic style club sandwich. 
My friend tried the club also and agreed with me on it. We couldn't decide what the cheese was, either cheap American or cheddar. We just couldn't figure it out. 
The wait staff that was the singer was amazing. 
I'll probably go back to try something else. It's a good place to eat if you're staying at the Stratosphere and while not cheap when thinking of McDonald's pricing it's not ridiculously expensive, especially for an in casino restaurant. The club was $10 and the onion rings were $7. The drink price was a little high at $2.99 for the glass of almost flat slightly warm coke.",pp-FlnTnaRgJ6iM5_WIsoA,0,0,3,3026vSIgdNSQfMxJDwu1yQ

We were seated after waiting in the line for 15 minutes. The hostess was apologetic and said that they aren't typically that busy and the second visit confirmed that, and we only had their $5 bellinis that time.

The servers at the Roxy are really polite. I kind of feel like I'm home when I'm there, probably because we sat in same booth both times.

I typically do not eat hot dogs of its not a cookout about once a year and my wife is even more opposed to hot dogs than I . Needless to say she didn't try my foot long chili cheese dog. It was really good and flavorful. It came with fries and was only $9.99. Very good price for the amount of food you get. The wife only had cheese fries to absorb the bellinis we were sucking down. I was happy to have ordered the hot as the first meal of my birthday. The only thing I'd like to be different is the fact that I had to eat it like a sandwich because the bottom broke because there was so much chili and cheese on it.

Breakfasts, sandwiches, burgers, shakes and desserts. Their angel-hair onion rings are good, especially dipped into ranch. They sing- a LOT. It may have been more than usual due to it being the weekend, but it seemed like every 5-10 minutes someone else was belting out a song. They've got much better voices than I do, so it wasn't a bad thing. The acoustics in the corner I was in weren't the best, I couldn't make out the actual lyrics- just that their voices were good. It gets really loud when they're singing, so if you're a conversational type you'll prefer other venues for sure. Food is better than Denny's or Ihop, location is convenient if you're already staying in the casino and the prices aren't exorbitant. I wouldn't seek it out, but it's not really my type of restaurant in the first place. 

BTW, they're open 24 hours- so you can get your drunk food delivered by singing 50s style staff at 3am if that's your thing.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,3,qTMASA4bvwd6Tr_1M5cIIw

He specifically asked the waitress of the meat was tender and she said yes. I tasted his dish and had to spit it in my napkin. The meal was not fresh and tasted like day old reheated meat (we've all eaten leftovers, so you know what that tastes like).

Another 15 minutes rolled by before they even took our drink order. 15 more minutes to actually get drinks. I asked one of the waitresses to get our waitress and she essentially ran into the kitchen to hide. I camped out at the kitchen so I could ask about the holdup as it was now over 30 minutes for food.

The food finally came out. Some of the food was good, some was ok and some was mediocre. I had the patty melt which was flavourless and disappointing. My wife had the clam chowder which had almost no clams. We didn't see our waitress again until I tried to hunt her down.

A number of items were recorded incorrectly for who ordered them which made splitting the bill very difficult.

If you think our service was bad, during our ordeal another table of 6 was seated behind us and they left after waiting more than 15 minutes for wait staff that never came around to even take their drink orders. They were followed by another group of 6 who got their drinks quickly but then were never spoken to again. They paid their drink bill and left, shaking their heads.

Service:
We had a waiter named Joey that was severely inattentive and didn't seem to be very organized in his work. He'd pass by multiple times looking at our empty water glasses and go about what he was doing. When we finally flagged him down to get it refilled he only refilled one then asked if anyone else needed more water and i had to point to my empty glass that had been sitting on the edge of the table for 22 minutes..

The Food:
The food USED to be good and portions USED to be perfect. Now the portions were much smaller and Im sure the food would have been good if Joey our waiter had brought it out when it was still hot...... Instead, we all got plates of barely warm food which ruined the  quality of it.

NO we didn't bother speaking to a manager  because what was that going to do after the fact, we just wanted to get out of there,",fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA,1,0,2,7PKEt9EIp_QAhE6v7Gerww

Our server was curt and kind of rude, but got the job done. The food was ok; however, nothing to really write home about.  Between the two of us we had a patty melt and also a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Our sides were the mac and cheese of the day.

It took about twelve minutes after we were seated(to-go order) before our order was taken. The wings were ready in six minutes.... Ummm what? I don't know any restaurant that is preparing fresh wings in six minutes. Come to find out the were precooked then re-dropped to order. Which dried them out because they were over cooked. The buffalo sauce was extremely hot for a mild sauce. I should've followed my gut and avoided this place.,n5ddOjLzVuzi6GZJYzVxXg,0,0,1,fcQOpA0zdZs_w36o7H_yIQ

Food was really bad.  Perhaps they were having a bad night or inexperienced chef.  My daughter ordered breakfast (for dinner).  It was ""classic eggs benedict"".  The sauce was not identifiable.  Some sort of runny cream colored sauce.  She said it tasted like mayo mixed with mustard.  Smothered over the egg and ham and muffin.  The ham (not Canadian bacon) was *under* the muffin.  We asked for the egg medium, it was almost raw, and exploded when she cut it.  She did not finish. She ordered two pancakes because she was still hungry-  they were undercooked and gummy.  My son ordered cheese fries.  Very obviously canned/jarred sauce with a few strands of shredded cheese, completely smothering the fries, which then became soggy and inedible.  My food was not bad, a grilled chicken sandwich.  The lettuce leaf was from the stalk of the lettuce, too thick and brown/wilted, so I removed it.  The ""kettle fries"" were from a bag.

Yes, we're in Vegas.... there are a million [good] places to eat, but in all honesty, we were exhausted and this place seemed good and it was right next to the elevator to our room, so yea... 

The place isn't horrible.

So my fiance ordered a raspberry iced tea and I ordered a chocolate ice cream soda to start.... now I ordered their special, which was a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda for $7.99.  Now, I didn't order a soda, but obviously my fiance did.... so shouldn't they have given that to me for free?  Nope they charged me for it... so I was already irked.

After driving around and looking for a place to eat, we ended up back at our hotel so we decided to have a late night snack at Roxy's.

We were super disappointed that the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station wouldn't let us dine there since I had the kids with me.  Wish they'd made that clear on their Yelp page that you can't dine in if you're under 21 after a certain hour.

Anywho, I'm glad that we gave this place another chance since it wasn't as bad this time around.

I had the corned beef hash and it was pretty decent.  The waitress was able to get them to make my order without onions and replaced the bell peppers with jalapeño peppers instead.

The boys shared a foot-long chili cheese dog with a basket of fries and they were complaining that it was too much food for them, which I also made them help me with my corned beef hash.

I expected it to just be okay but was actually really suprised at how good it was. Whatever they season the hashbrown with is really yummy and flavorful.

Location (3/5): This restaurant locates inside the Stratosphere, far from the strip but convenient for hotel guests. It locates closed by McCall's Heartland Grill and Fellini's Ristorante, so high competition around.

Service (4/5): Our waitress, Bebe, was very friendly and nice! She usually came to ask how we were doing. Although the restaurant was packed, I thanked her for the effort!

3256013,2016-07-16,0,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"Meh. That's the first word that would come to find if someone asked me about this place. 

The bomb...I guess:
THE BUTTERFINGER SHAKE. 
The Sin City Burger was decent. Presentation was a little sloppy and the buns were cold which was weird but it was pretty good. I got the Chipotlé aioli on the side, but honestly, you should get it on the burger. It's one of the best things here. 
I like the design of the place. Could use a little more lighting though. 
The fries were good too...I guess. 
Our actual server (I guess) was pretty nice and had a sense or emergency. 

The bad:
The initial server wasn't the best. He could make it a little less obvious that they're here only for the paycheck. 
The food took a really long time to come out, especially considering that they were mostly standard fast food items. 
They don't write down your order. They memorize them. I honestly think it would be better if they wrote it down to minimize errors. 
They didn't clean the floor underneath our table. It was pretty gross. 
The seafood soup or whatever it was. It was scary honestly. 
The steak was not at all tasty and tasted like the sausage from McDonald's. What's up with that. 

If you're hungry (and can't wait) and staying at the Stratosphere, Roxy's Diner will do. It's pretty filling, but not fulfilling. If you just want the standard burger or something similar, you should go to Sonic's or something cheaper. It was a little overpriced for what it was. If you have the patience, you should try better places. Period.",mclXJ8FvkRxWnahBfCqTLg,2,0,2,0QLpmoQ3OUmD2X1M_-zQHQ

The food isn't anything to write home about but remember it's late and you're starving from a day of leisure activity. You're familiar with the menu items, burgers, fries and shakes. Throw in some other sandwiches and onion rings to round out the choices.

We came to stay at the Stratosphere from Friday till Sunday morning. 12/7-12/10. 
My fiancé and I decided before we went walking for a bit let's find a nice place to eat and have a nice little dinner. So we were walking and walked past this place. There was a large gentleman singing and trying to get all of 8 people in the restaurant to sing with him. Didn't go so well. 
So we got out table there was no wait at all, we were immediately sat at a booth. The place looked nice had a good feel. 
As we started to look at the menu time kept going by. No server. 
10 minutes passed! Still NO server. 
15 minutes passed! Still NO server. 
Finally went to the host stand to ask where out server might be or if we can sit in a section where there is one. She looked at me frustrated and annoyed throwing her one hand in the air saying "" go sit down I'll get someone for you"" 
Hum okay no need for the attitude. Another 10 minutes passed at this point we were really upset that with only 4 tables sat and no more then 10 people in the restaurant we never had one person come and see our table even after telling the host! So we got up and started to leave and finally a server came. ""Can I start you guys off something to drink"" absolutely not! 
Their horrible server and such bad attitudes those employees had was just terrible. 
I would never recommend this diner to anyone I know. It's just so not worth the time. We really wanted to give this place a chance which is the only reaper stayed. But so be you run your company on rudeness and on no service to customers. 

I don't see this Diner being open for many more years. Not with the way it's ran and how dirty it is. Floor was disgusting. Wish I would have taken pictures.",aVWQFbpTaMqSBFIPcAKuvA,0,0,1,pdZRW6L4r_5WQjty3imxrw

He offered to remake my meal however everybody else was done and we were ready to leave. He then hands us our bill and charges us for the meal. While we were sitting there we could see the food prep area and we watched someone put a burger in the microwave prior to serving. Clearly my meal did not make it to the microwave step!

When leaving we asked to speak with the manager. She came by and was very rude and argumentative. According to her chef the food was never cold. She also stated that she personally waited our table and ordered us extra drinks, which was a lie. Her next excuse for the horrible service was that she was dealing with one of the hotel towers being out of power. I finally got her to comp our meal and she said I would have the refund in a few days. She also refused to provide me a receipt.

I order eggs over and I got scrambled, the huge portion of hash browns were cold, oily and just disgustingly gross. The tiny pancake was made a few days ago, it was tougher than the ham.
Coffee was probably from the Clark County Detention center down the street. The highlight of my meal was the glass of ice water.
50's diner theme and kind of loud annoying music in the background. I actually saw a ""chef"" walking around, but who is cooking back in the kitchen?
There was a family at a nearby table and you could tell they didn't like their food either, it seemed to me that they were tourists from another country. What they must think of American breakfast food? Shameful!

3394466,2011-12-07,0,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"This is the best breakfast for the money that I have had in Vegas.

After reading about the singing wait staff, my wife and I wanted to check this place out just for kicks. When a couple friends wanted to go to the top of the Stratosphere tower, it was a perfect opportunity to eat at Roxy's.

It is in the casino just inside the south tower entrance? which isn't far from a nearby Deuce stop. We went on a wednesday morning around 10:30 am and there were only a handful of other tables taken. We were seated right away and given menus and brought fresh coffee. I noticed right away that the place was clean and the decor was pretty cool with shiny chrome and neon much like a diner from the 50s.

I ordered texas style french toast with a side of sausage, my wife had an omelet with spinach, feta, and provolone, with 2 glasses of OJ. Our 2 guests each had a BLT with  fries and 2 sodas.

Everything was served fairly quick and the food was very good. My french toast was thick and filling, the sausage was hot and tasty. My wife's omelet was big and covered in spinach and cheese. The BLTs that were ordered were both too big to eat they had to take them apart.

We all agreed this was a good meal. When we received the check we were surprised to see the total was just over 40 dollars for the 4 of us. That is less than what we paid for breakfast for 2 in another place that wasn't nearly as good as this. Just goes to show you don't have to spend a fortune in Vegas to get a good meal. I am so tired of hearing people justify spending way too much money on average food or drink by saying ""well, it is Vegas"". This was good food for not alot of money, so there!

We did not have a singing waitress but she was very nice. We will have to come back another time, perhaps for dinner and maybe we will get treated to a song.",ChRpi0qtrDHAY95LA3Zmhw,1,0,5,dV083eswYbCr9Hl054Xj8Q

The first time, it was a little busy so the service was somewhat slow but not terrible; had pretty good burgers, giant crispy onion rings, and the Anaconda was in heaven with the handmade hot fudge shake. 

So, I was already ok with it, but on the way out we saw the dessert case with individual cakes displayed and got a chocolate for him and a cheesecake with white chocolate curls on it for me. We were pretty full but each took a bite when we got back to the room. Turned out to be a restless night, with each of us popping up in paranoia when we heard (or thought we heard) the other one stirring, convinced our cake was under attack. When I actually did catch the Anaconda in the act, we  just got up and ate them. Those things were GREAT, and so rich and sweet that either of them would have been plenty to share, but we didn't!

This time I went with Babygirl, and she was not impressed with the busy atmosphere or the open-to-the-casino-traffic floor plan, but we were seated immediately by a smiling host and our waitress, Alex, was pleasant and quick. BG ordered water to drink and immediately made a face, pronouncing it the most chlorinated she'd ever had. Personally, I've never objected to that flavor- always reminded me of swimming pools and childhood summers, but she is spoiled by overpriced bottled varieties so she traded it in for the $5 mimosa, which was served not in a champagne flute but a good sized tumbler - quite a bargain and they let her take it with her.

She had a chicken melt (10.99) which had grilled herbed breast meat and avocado on a giant ciabatta roll. It looked great and she loved it. Very impressive since she was in a mood that day. My BLT (8.99) was also good- served on lightly toasted sourdough, which gave it a just-right texture: held up to the chewy bacon and wet tomatoes and mayo, but wasn't hard enough to shatter or shred the inside of your mouth, which sadly is often the case. Fries were hot, crispy and tasty.

Of course, I was still hungry (meaning, ""not stuffed"") since she refused to give me any bites of her chicken, so I ordered the bread pudding (5.99), which was dense and hot, and came with a scoop of ice cream, a glop of whipped cream, caramel syrup, and a scattering of crunchy pecans. It also came with an extra spoon, which Babygirl used with a vengeance, not even seeing the ironic glances I cast at her to-go box.

Back to the cleanliness, or lack thereof - under the table was so dirty that we were accidental kicking debris on each other when simply shifting our feet around. So disgusting! At least they wiped the table and seats down just before we were seated, because hey, what's better than sitting on wet vinyl seats. By the way, there were still crumbs on the seat. 
The burgers consist of previously frozen patties that aren't very good and pretty decent veggies. Not really what you're looking for when you are dropping this much money on a burger. Just save some money and go up one floor to Mickey Ds. 
Their other food isn't a great value either. For example, $8 will get you 5 alright onion rings. Stay away from the shakes, unless you aren't picky.

This All American Diner is located in The Stratosphere off the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. This place is open 24/7 which makes it convenient at 3am when you've given the casino far too much dinero and start feeling a rumbly in your tumbly and immediately think ""where can I go to give this place even more money?""

The vibe here is a retro 50's style (more or less) and they have a giant screen playing some classic black and white flicks. They are also, allegedly, supposed to have a DJ and the servers are supposed to sing...I don't know if these events occur at certain times or on certain days, but when we visited we did not experience any of this (it was 11ish on a Thursday night).

Now, the service was both good and bad. I say that because the servers on the one side of the restaurant seemed quick and extremely attentive. However, the side of the restaurant where my wife and I and many other poor unfortunate souls were sitting...not so much. This guy was slow. When it takes over five minutes to even be acknowledged and another ten just to receive water, that's when I have a problem. Normally, I would have walked out on a situation like this but I was tired, hungry, and already sitting so I really didn't want to try to find something else. I don't know what our server's issue was as I saw very little of him and saw the other servers zipping around their sections repeatedly.

In fact, orders were left sitting for pick up at the kitchen window for far too long before our server grabbed them to be delivered. Thankfully our food was hot and did not sit long, but there was a burger that belonged to a guy sitting at a booth adjacently from us and my wife watched it sit at the window for about 10 minutes before it was delivered to the guy (we sat by the kitchen so it wasn't hard to notice). My wife tried to warn the guy that his food had been sitting a long time and commented that hopefully it was warm. The guy (who either could care less, was drunk, stoned, or a combination of the three) simply nodded his head. 

The food itself was about average although portions were a tad above average. The potatoes were slightly mushy but the bacon in my sandwich was good. My wife's meal was supposed to come w/ an English muffin which never came. When we DID see our server again, we informed him of the MIA muffin and he said he would grab it...which turned out to be a lie. My wife and I had a few more bites left of our meals and still no English muffin. This was the last straw... We were able to flag down a manager and complain about our experience so far and he told us he would return. He did. He came back a few minutes and nonchalantly informed us our meal was taken care of and we were good to go. My wife looked at me and said ""I guess I don't get that English muffin..."" ""Guess not"" I replied, ""but we do get to make like a tree and get the hell outta here.""

So, based on my experience here, it's a one star, but since our meal was comped I am giving Roxy's two stars and that is the only reason as to why.",GNQyX_YtwWRqoIf8B9AsQQ,10,4,2,OxQ65QXazK6dWz7Kb7YOMA

When I complained to the manager about the incident he didn't take my complaint seriously and it was obvious he thought it was a joke. He asked repeatedly ""but are you okay"", like it was no big deal that his staff member disrespected me in his restaurant. I'm a former waitress and I know great customer service. I won't be dining there again merely because of the way the waiter and his manager handled the situation at the end of my experience.",aJi6AKjRtbPW9Lo4PsAWFg,0,0,3,UWeY1IVaKekTFvH45F4K8g

3695820,2016-02-22,3,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"The worst dining experience I've had to date.

My friend and I were wandering the Stratosphere  at ~3:30 AM when we found this place. Props for being open 24/7, because I wouldn't know where else we would've found a sit-in place at that hour.

We had to wait a while to get seated because the staff at the front was occupied with a customer complaining about bad service and the amount of food he got for the price. Not a good start.

After we were seated, no one came to take our order and it was difficult to get anyone's attention. The place was only around half full and they had lots of staff around - just none of them were paying attention.

Taking the order was messy - we ordered items that gave us a choice of sides and the waitress didn't even ask which sides we wanted (which is what basically every other place does). I had to specifically state that I wanted kettle chips on the side to her as it looked like she was about to walk away without asking. Then when the order came and I got the wrong side anyway (fries instead of the kettle chips I asked for), she got really confused and was about to swap out both our fries and we had to stop her and tell her that my friend did order fries and that only my order was wrong.

When I asked where the washroom was so I could wash my hands, the waitress said she'd bring me something and gave me napkins dipped in hot water for me to clean my hands on. It was the most ghetto thing I've ever seen a diner do.

I'd ordered one of their burgers and the whole thing was falling apart. Nothing fit like a burger and I ended up eating it piece by piece. The whole meal was bland and wasn't even hot. Needless to say the staff wasn't around much until it was time to pay the bills either.

Shoddy and unattentive staff - bland, cold, and falling apart food... and it's not much different in price from any other place on the strip. I will not be coming here again and I highly dissuade anyone else from visiting this diner if they can help it.

The server had just taken notice of my daughter in her high chair when she (the server) repeated the verse ""Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough."" Perfect song, perfect moment.

The film even ""froze"" a few times giving me the impression that a used dvd is what was showing the film. We were there for about 1 hour, around noon-ish. Not one of the servers belted out a song.

My friends and I came to this 24 hour diner everyday (sometimes twice) while in Vegas.

Everything was so delicious - and it's even better when you're starving after being out all night. They're very accommodating as well - extra toast? Not a problem. Jalepenos in our grilled cheese, with extra on the side? Sure. 

The waitresses remind me of the ladies who work at Waffle House down in the south, if you've ever eaten there. The theme of the diner is definitely 50s (think ""Happy Days""). If you stop by late night, you might even be lucky enough to get serenaded by the manager of Roxy - they are such talented singers and performers, and makes for an entertaining meal.

3846594,2018-03-10,0,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"My friend and I went to Roxy's diner last night around 10:30pm. We were seated fairly quickly but it took a long time to even get a water. Eventually, the server took our order. From there, we sat and waited and sat and waited. It was frustrating to see that people who arrived after us had already eaten and left, while we hadn't even received our order yet. We had ordered two items: an appetizer platter and a sandwich. The server did not come by and apologize or even check to see how we were doing. Over 45 minutes later, a friend who just got off work sat with us and placed an order. Our order still wasn't there. Did she even put the order in?

Our friend placed his order and finally our food came out. I believe at that point it had been an hour since we put our order in. The food wasn't bad, but the wait time was ridiculous. Once we were all done with our food, the server never came back to bring our bill. We waited. We waited. 30 minutes later we had not received our bill. We went to the area where there seemed to be a place to pay to explain our frustration in waiting this long to even pay. Eventually, a manager (if that's what you want to call him) said he would give us 10% off ($3).  I couldn't believe it. The entire experience took over an hour and a half and he was not even apologetic or sympathetic. We could have easily left without paying since our server clearly didn't care to serve us. 

It had been so long since we ordered that I forgot who our server was. When a girl took our cards and we asked to split the bill, she kept saying down the middle? Down the middle? Well yes.  I started complaining about our server not coming back and how awful it was. She said she didn't need to be treated like that and stomped off to the back. The manager cams back and didn't seem to believe we had even waited that long. I think he was going off the time our friend showed up and not when we placed our initial order, 45 minutes or more earlier. Our cards ended up being taken to the back which made me nervous. Why would you take someone's card for over ten minutes? Finally he came back and I was furious. I didn't want to even pay at that point because the entire situation was awful and customers should not be treated how we were treated. 

Not sure how the manager and server still have a job, but I will definitely not go back to this restaurant again.

My sister and I wanted to order a special package for my dad and his new bride, so we went to place an order in person at the restaurant.  For starters, apparently the wrong person took our order.  It was supposed to be a manager, and instead it was some cook who didn't write his name on the order.  He gave us the wrong package.  When my sister and I went a few days later to speak to a manager, she took a long time to find our order.  When she finally did, she stated that the order wasn't what we said it was.  However, I specifically remember telling the guy what we wanted.  Then the manager continued to blame us for our order being wrong.  I told her someone had to be held accountable for not placing the order correctly in the first place, meaning that a manager should've come out (I saw that they were there the day we went to place the order) and made sure it was correct with us before placing it in the first place.  After arguing with her for about 40 minutes, she said at best she could only give us 20% of the price back, which isn't much.  I understand that with customer service, there is only so much you can give back.  What really got us upset was the fact that she continued to blame us for their mistake and was very rude about it.

I thought the service was good, but for the most part, I was not impressed with the quality or tase of the food.  I had a spicy ""southwestern-style"" burger ($12.99), and the majority of what I tasted was the THICK, doughy-Bun.  The meat was rubbery and bland, the condiments were soggy and tasteless.  Fries were ok (they were hot, so I assumed they were fresher that the rest of my plate).  In my opinion, a terrible burger for the whopping price of $12.99.

Another member of our group ordered a Reuben sandwich - According to her, It was greasy, and she was ill for the rest of the night. 

The rest of the food that I saw seemed mediocre and rather plain, especially given the prices they were charging.

The breakfast menu is small but sufficient choices. The regular menu is looks like a record LP. The place is Coke themed as if Coke sponsors the restaurant. But overall looked good.

I had a Chicken Fried Steak meal w/eggs and sausage. It was delicious. compare this to places like Denys and IHOP and Roxy's will blow them away. The waiter took a bit long which we didn't realize cause when you have a large group you're into a lot of conversations.

The waiter arrived with some food. Food for half the group. He said he accidentally dropped a tray. First time in about 6 yrs. So we WOWED for a little bit. Not sure if it was because he dropped a tray for the first time in 6 years or because he had been working there that long. 

Soon, the waiter began to sing a song. My girl. He came over and sang to a girl in our group. We laughed and clapped. It was great.

After the song, the waiter brought the rest of the group their food. On one order, the waiter made a mistake, he brought sunny side eggs when the person asked for scrambled. He quickly sent the plate back for a correction. The waiter then offered dessert for everyone on him. 
Some people took it, some didn't, I was way too full.

Wir hatten die Hühner-Nudelsuppe, das Clubsandwich, das BLT-Sandwich mit Pommes und die Fajita. Zum trinken gab es Softdrinks und Milchshakes.

An american diner all 50ies Style in the Casino Area of the stratosphere (Tower) hotel. Everybody is pretty friendly, food and beverages were fast at the table and everything was pretty good. 
The menu is made like an old newspaper, pretty cool I think.
A few of the waiters/waitresses are performing live songs in the diner, really great (some of the voices are really good!). 
We had the chicken noodle soup, the classic Clubsandwich, the classic BLT with french fries and Fajita, to drink some soft drinks and thick milkshakes. yummy!",sJt7xHhgWBuQ7LJYserqiA,0,0,4,V6zITTU1EVK4vdf-z3uvKg

The food was just bad.. we had the french toast sandwich and the California omelet. I asked about the corned beef hash and the waitress told me that it is made from a can. After dropping the food off we never saw her again until she brought the bill (I needed hot sauce but just ate without it)...my husband was NOT happy with it. I can say that this restaurant is definitely a drunk no other place is open spot to go to. Nothing else.  Dennys and ihop would have tasted better.

The 50's singing waiters was just annoying to me. But I know that's their thing there so others may really like it. For dessert we split a banana malt which I have to say was super good.

ACCESSIBILITY REVIEW
No bathroom that I know of, I didn't ask.  I stayed in the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino, which sucked but that's for another time and place.  There are no steps/stairs in this place and it's very accessible to get through.

RESTAURANT REVIEW
I ordered the Big Daddy Double Decker burger.  I like hamburgers, but unfortunately this one was too big.  For some reason, I liked it the first time, but the second time, I couldn't seem to put it down.  Maybe I 'partied' too hard the night before and just couldn't seem to eat food, if you know what I mean...wink wink.  It's served w/ onion rings which are good.

The one thing that makes this place unique, is that everyone that works here is required to be able to sing, with the exception of the cooks.  The host and servers take turns singing a song every few minutes or so.  Considering this is a 50s diner, they do 50s songs.  Don't expect Metallica...well, maybe at the rate they (Metallica) are going, but I hope not.  When they sing, they'll walk around the room and put a hand on a few of the customers, singing directly to them.  If you're lucky, it'll be a really hot waitress, and yes they have them.  I was eyeing 3 of them one night.   If you're like me, you get excited when any hot girl so much as even looks (let alone, touches you on the shoulder) at you.  Then again, I'm a lonely guy.

First when everything else shuts down in Stratosphere we had no other choice but to go to this restaurant..
Then we wait outside at the welcome counter for 10min and nobody comes and finally we decide to just step inside..
The manager said he has not only to be on the counter to welcome the guests but also serve / work inside too..
The staff is really less..
We then ordered something and there was HAIR in my food.. CAN YoU BELIEVE that?
When I mentioned this to the waitress, indeed she took it back but her words were ""Oh is it, let me take it but I shall check the HAIR later""
You think I was lying or is it that you don't care there was hair in my food..
There are hardly any Vegetarian / Vegan options and the waitress didn't bother to come back to take the order.. She didn't take any efforts to mention if anything else can be cooked Vegan..
I thought there is some courtesy of the quality of food they gave us..

My first experience at Roxy's several years ago was with two good friends, and great food.  The wait staff also was performing and the prices were great.  

Over the years the menu has changed a bit, but the servers still performed.  The other day the server basically ignored my table, and there was one performance in all of the hour I was there.  The food quality had gone downhill since my last visit a few months ago.  Also they switched from Coke to Pepsi.  It may not seem like much but combined with the rest, it was one more downgrade.  

When the staff used to perform every 20 mins or so, and they had great food at decent prices, and Coke, this was a great place to visit.  There are much better diners in Vegas for locals, and I'll be bringing my friends to them from now on.  The staff and food used to differentiate this one from the rest.

I order a chili burger, which didn't have as much chili liked I hoped, but it was still pretty decent. I believe the whole casino is having a deal with Budweiser beer, which was $2. Not too bad, I'm not a big fan of Bud beer, but I couldn't pass up such a cheap deal.

Also, from time to time, some of the servers or waiters would stop what they are doing and start singing a song. It was fairly entertaining while we are enjoying our food. I really felt like we were in the 50's with everything provided by the restaurant staffs.

We aren't known for our authentic diners out here. That's a given. The one place I knew, that wasn't even 24 hours, closed down long ago.

Stay because there are some talented singers crooning, and if you're lucky you will catch Viva Las Vegas, which I adore for two reasons: 1. The opening credits have some of the best footage of classic Vegas neon signs. 2. Elvis.  Just be sure you request a table with a good view of the screens.

In addition to the live tunes being sung by the waitstaff and Elvis, the other good things are that they have no problem with separate checks even if you're a party of 7, and the service is friendly. 

However, I must say my side salad was sad. The iceberg lettuce creation was browning on the edges, and besides black olives and pungent red onions, didn't include too many vegetables. For me, black olives are an immediate sign that you're entering a salad danger zone. I requested blue cheese, and either ended up with ranch or their blue cheese is disappointing. A fresh mixed green salad with balsamic would be more impressive. Really, all you need for a solid salad are fresh goods and a delicious dressing, but those were missing.

Located in the lobby of The Stratosphere and operating 24/7 since its inception Roxy's Diner had always struck me as the sort of restaurant targeting the hotel's drunken late nights but with a recent menu update and a fresh coat of paint I suddenly found the place calling my name, a 6:00am breakfast proving well worth the trek.  Large in size and copious in choices from the 'all-day' menu as Marilyn Monroe films and 50s décor flourish beneath an era appropriate soundtrack it was to smiling service that my arrival was met and although coffee refills occasionally required reminder nothing about kitschy cuisine lacked in the least.  Beginning first with a duo of French Toasts, one part savory and one thoroughly sweet, suffice it to say that when compared to central-strip 24/7s like Central or Carnegie Roxy's portions trend large for the price and although the sandwich was quite good with crispy bacon and fluffy eggs between supple bread it paled in comparison to the cinnamon roll's gluttonous spiral complete with frosting and further gilded with a warm maple sidecar.  Setting aside parts of the first course ""to-go"" (a ridiculous $1 surcharge for the box on my bill) and turning attention to desserts it was to another duo that I was treated and although I'm rather certain the bread pudding suffered a delay en route given the lukewarm temperature and melted ice cream the flavors were quite pleasant, a compliment equally offered to a sizable $6 carrot cake rife with cinnamon and thickly frosted with citrus-tinged cream cheese.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,3,9Ivp0jepFW5jc2lGM8Z6Ig

Ce restaurant est une vraie machine à remonter le temps avec un décor rétro des années 50, de la musique des années 50 et des serveurs qui chantent des chansons des années 50. Le menu est complet avec une bonne sélection de hamburger vraiment gras, gros, juteux et un peu saignant au centre de la galette afin de donner un goût tendre mais aussi des déjeuner qui vont vous donner une crise cardiaque juste à voir l'assiette. Les prix sont très abordables pour la grosseur des assiettes. Pour environ 12-13$ (en dollar US), vous avez une énorme assiette avec des frittes qui sont probablement préparé dans du saindoux et de l'huile la plus grasse possible. Le service est rapide, amicale et en plus, les serveurs/serveuses vont même chanter à votre table!

Le hamburger que j'ai mangé à deux occasions était très gros. Sans trop exagéré, je crois que mon hamburger était d'environ 8 pouces de circonférence. La galette est une demi livre mais il est possible de commander un hamburger de deux livres ! Le choix que j'ai pris avait du fromage bleu frit dans de l'huile et du saindoux, de la laitue, tomate et autres légumes. Il avait un choix spécial dans le menu avec des oeufs frit dans du gras.

Le spécial au déjeuner possède probablement les calories nécessaires afin de permettre à un être humain en bonne santé physique et mentale de survive plus de 48 heures. Vous avez droit à une méga tranche de bacon canadien salé et délicieux d'une livre cuit sur le grille et vous avez aussi le droit à trois ufs préparé selon votre choix sans oublier du pain avec une tonne de beurre chaud à volonté et probablement l'équivalant d'une livre de patates au four. J'ai facilement pris trois livres de plus avec ce déjeuner qui porte le surnom de ""graveyard"".J'ai bien aimé mon expérience culinaire américaine, malgré une forte accumulation de matière grasse dans mon organisme.

They've re-opened on December 28th after being temporarily closed for repairs. 

Been here four times. Third time was the charm. The fourth a let down. Was looking forward to the nachos with beef brisket. We had it on our 3rd visit for my boy's birthday. It was hands down the best part of the meal, coupled with the great service and showmanship from our host/waiter we had such a grand time. So for mom's special day we wanted her to have the same awesome dining experience. 

First letdown was the seating arrangement. We were led to the ""patio"" part of the restaurant where the red lighting was too visually unappealing and not conducive for taking great photos. My bad we should've asked to be seated elsewhere. 

Second was the nachos with beef brisket. The beef tasted like they were boiled. Totally bland, and they used the canned cheese. 

The other food choices we got were: footlong chili dog and beef quesadilla-yummy; chicken bites- ok; and the Hawaiian burger- dry, but it was my choice to have the teriyaki sauce on the side. The thing that redeemed the night was the good service we had and the great showmanship from the hosts/waiters/waitresses cum singers. Mom was also touched as most of the diners chimed in when they sang her birthday song. I had to throw in another star for our past experience as well.

Its great they are open 24 hours there was so many nights we played on the machines for hours and lost track of time and went here because we wanted something fast to eat before heading to the room.
Its not a bad place to go if you want some Diner food. Its convenient to go to when staying there instead of leaving casino to go find someplace to eat.

Check it out it is a fun Diner to eat at!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,8,7,4,6nxR4ZvDZzBY2NmtbLfyCA

However I ordered a chicken Philly sandwich and instead of it being on the traditional side roll it was on the Different bread that did not bring out the flavors! The fries where cooked just right and were very good do not recommend the cheese fries just the plain regular fries were good!,zO_bN6rvzYpMj7Fzu0wDBQ,0,0,3,UTy_hEAO7KDsdfE9Bukj_A

Nothing too fancy--just very nicely constructed one-third pound burgers prepared to order, and delicious specialty sandwiches to boot.  My medium-rare Roxy's Grand Chuck Burger arrived just as ordered, with lettuce, tomato, and pickle planks supplemented by requested bacon, mushrooms, sauteed onions, a slice of Swiss Cheese, and fresh avocado on a soft bun.  Heinz ketchup and Heinz mild mustard applied by me finished the job.  Once done, I could barely get my mouth around my hamburger, but when I did it packed a delightful multi-ingredient punch.  House Fries in a small paper bag, and thick golden battered O'rings dipped in BBQ sauce and Ranch Dressing,rounded out a fine filling meal.

Singing waitstaff added an authentic touch of rock 'n roll to this venerable diner located on the main floor of the Stratosphere, and service was again very good.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,9,9,4,ze2tlpKn8DVlcNmlCZw-_w

5868632,2014-08-13,1,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"Don't let the photos fool you...it's got a cool theme, but this diner is a wee bit dirty, as is everything in the Stratosphere. It was also excruciatingly LOUD in there. I got a headache from the music and some fool singing on the other side of the room. I found the entire building a bit scary, to be honest. But I promised my daughter she could do the rides on the top, so I sat below and ate at Roxy's to kill time while she rode.

Service was really bad, but I was killing time, so I didn't complain. It took a long time to get someone to take my order and then I never saw her again after I got my meal and the only coffee I was offered.

Having said that, the Huevos Ranchero I got were really good.

If you have to be at the Stratosphere and you want diner food and you are not in a hurry, go for it.",WYX_NXU_0UjLwihc0B1_Vw,1,1,3,uuA-L7fbtFxT0nKn3FfuHQ

5965469,2017-08-09,3,ijg7qQCYnhUWBd5JUxbfvA,"After more than twenty years, Roxy is still here, and I couldn't be happier. As I child we always stayed at the Stratosphere, and Roxy would always be my favorite place to eat, no matter what time of day it was. 

The 50's diner vibe is half of why I like it so much. Something about 50's diner just perks me up and makes me happy. Maybe it's the lights, or the big red booths, or the servers dressed in 50's attire and talking like Elvis. 

The food they serve is the second half of why I love this place so much. I can't remember what I would order as a kid, but I can tell you that when I ordered the Sin City burger, I was very happy with it. First of all, they actually cooked it rare, even though the burger was thinner than most. That is an amazing feat to accomplish with such a small burger, and I loved it. The burger was also seasoned well. I'm not ordinarily a fan of fried eggs on burger, but I was really feeling it on this day, and I loved it. 

I had to purchase a souvenir Stratosphere glass because it was only $5.99. 

In the end, I'm so happy Roxy is still around. Revisiting the diner brought back a lot of memories for me, and I thank you for sticking around.",UuAk4jHFBCHlgiAFJfubQw,5,6,4,mvAx8MOI1VVOQ7vNJcAEDg

Been here more than a week ago. We had our brunch here because this is accessible since we're staying at the Stratosphere Hotel. The ambiance is nice but the quality of the food is over price. The waiter didn't gave us water. We're almost done, so we just ask another server. She didn't come back to ask if we're ok. We ask for the sausage but we end up eating a bacon and its not crispy at all. I'm so disappointed.",-7PoA5pm2biQB7CqMwrjCA,1,0,1,wegk9L_YJ56eMtcIxaR2-A
