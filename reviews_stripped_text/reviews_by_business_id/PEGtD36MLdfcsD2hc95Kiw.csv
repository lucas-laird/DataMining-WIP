The meatballs were disgusting and also tasted frozen. When I called an hour after I ordered the store clerk was extremely rude. When the delivery finally showed up they did not have the credit caRd machine so I had to call the shop back and process my card over the phone.

445040,2013-06-29,0,PEGtD36MLdfcsD2hc95Kiw,"Ordered delivery 6/26/13, at 7:50pm.  I had the Gyro Special that was $7.55 and it came with fries and a can of soda.  They have a choice of Beef, Lamb, or Chicken, and I chose the lamb, thinking it would be like a more authentic spit roasted lamb, but it came as the typical gyro roasted ground meat.  It was good, no complaints.  It seemed small at first, BUT they are generous with the meat, which made up for the size of the pita.  The fries are the steak style fries.  Reminded me of Fat Burger, ""Fat Fries.""  Very good, and there were a ton.  Good deal on the Gyro.  Been a long time since I had a gyro, and this really satisfied my gyro fix I was looking for.

Also, I was in the mood for some BBQ ribs.  Ordered the Baby Back, ala carte.  Whole rack was $16.95.  They reminded me of the ones you can get pre-made at Smith's deli.  For the price, it was totally fine.  Tasted OK, fall off the bone tender, and were wrapped nice in heavy foil, no leaks.  Satisfied my craving for ribs.  Actually ate the rest for dinner the following night.  

Ordered by phone.  The guys accent was thick and a little difficult to understand, but was cordial so that was fine.  Paid with CC and had them add tip.  Was told 35-45 minutes for delivery.  It came in 38 minutes.  I was pleasantly surprised by that.  Deliveries are usually way late from other restaurants.  I also want to mention that the kid who delivered it was friendly and very polite.  Nice, compared to the regular grumpy delivery guys from other restaurants that seem to be the norm in LV.  

Overall, happy with it and will definitely order from them again.

They will be replacing Angelina's, who was my go-to until they did a really bad job on my last order with them.

1976605,2014-09-06,2,PEGtD36MLdfcsD2hc95Kiw,"Found this place via Yelp search after a long day at work, no lunch break, and a killer wing craving- unfortunately, the wings offered here are not buffalo style, as I assume when ordering wings at a pizza place.

Order of wings for one comes with a side of fries (option for regular, curly, or upgrade to onion rings) containing 8-10 pieces per their website. Sauce options are medium, mild, hot, and bbq. The ""hot"" wings are  sauced prior to baking, and overcooked to the point of being dry, sauce itself seems to be sriarcha-based and includes red pepper flakes- a combination I've never seen or heard of on wings. Unpleasant at best, ended up tossing half the order despite my hunger.

Curly fries were decent- then again, they were my only option. Ample portion, would prefer ketchup packets to the weird shot glass of ketchup I actually received, but an order of fries won't make me a repeat visitor.

Location is small but decently clean, cashier was polite. Group of smokers on the patio made for an unpleasant smoke odor- may have been employees as one of the group got up, entered the dining room, went behind the counter and removed a bottled beverage from the cooler, then went outside to drink it, without saying a word to me as I waited to pick up my order.

1976775,2016-02-22,2,PEGtD36MLdfcsD2hc95Kiw,"I accidentally ordered from this Sophia's, thinking it was the Sofia's located on Arville (different restaurant, different owner, see review). That was a mistake and we were beyond disappointed. 

The driver showed up late with our pizza & other items. We paid with credit card (thankfully), tipped, and they left. Well, when we opened the pizza after the driver left, all of the toppings had slid to one side and there were only three slices that we could eat.

So we call the restaurant and they were super rude, the person on the phone even denied it. How could they even know?  We went back and forth with 2 phone conversations, and offered to text pictures of the mess they delivered. The restaurant offered to give us a discount on our next order. This resolution wasn't nearly good enough, as were hungry and there were literally 3 slices with all of the toppings on them, the rest just saucy crust. Not only that, but it's presumptuous to think they earned our business after this mess - the pizza topping mess is occasionally expected, the bad customer service is never okay. 

Finally, we said they could charge for the rest of the order, but we weren't willing to pay for the pizza. If they didn't agree with this resolution we would dispute the entire cc charge and send pics for them to decide. Well, they must have agreed bc we were charged for the other items ordered + tip (although undeserving), but not the pizza. 

Bottom line: they have terrible customer service. And the little bit of pizza we were able to eat wasn't even good. I will never order from here again. I noticed the review regarding change in ownership, but I'm not even sure I would consider that worthy enough to try them again.

2107331,2017-08-30,1,PEGtD36MLdfcsD2hc95Kiw,"The worst walk-in pizza experience I've ever witnessed in my 42 years of life. No exaggeration. So unbelievably bad that I basically just shut down (mentally) in the process. 

Lunchtime. Weekday. Around 1:30ish. Day of this review. Saw this place as I was driving by so I decided to check it out. After all, I felt like some pizza.

First thing I noticed as I walked in was how HOT the damn place was inside. A/C must have been down (or maybe they were too cheap to have it on), but it wasn't a deal breaker. Little did I know, this was the brightest, biggest red flag that was ever waved in my face, and I completely ignored it.

Walked up to the counter, trashy woman appears from out of the kitchen area (so trashy, you noticed it at first glance). She doesn't greet me, doesn't say a word, just stands there looking at me with a dumb look on her face. Finally, I say: ""Do you guys have pizza by-the-slice?"" She replies: ""No"" in the most monotone voice ever. At this point, I'm looking at the menu and she doesn't offer any other alternatives. At this point I should have my head examined for not walking out. 

Long story short, I ended up ordering a calzone and a drink. For the ""drink"", she gives me a can of soda (no ice, no cup) and tells me ""20 minutes"". Okay, maybe the place didn't have cups or ice, but you'd think someone with half a brain would wait to give you the drink AFTER or at least ask. I shut down in disbelief.

I have a seat and I start to realize just how hot the place actually is now that I've settled. It's VERY uncomfortable. So I'm sweating my Filipino ass off as I'm sitting there with my unopened can of root beer and thinking ""I should get my money back?"" But something deep inside is keeping me from having to ever exchange a single word with the trashy woman ever again. I decide to avoid interaction at all costs. Also, it was a card transaction, so that wouldn't be a cash refund, which meant, a few words of exchange. Remember, I'm in shut down mode.

And just when you think it couldn't have gotten any worse...

Trashy woman BLOWS HER F*CKING NOSE right at the counter. Loud, too!!! I couldn't make this sh*t up. At this very minute, I think I'm in some trailer trash nightmare that I can't awake from. It's surreal. Like, I'm in a comedy sketch or something. I was waiting for someone to say ""Hey, Jeff. You see those cameras over there? You've been Punk'D!"". But that wasn't the case. I shut down even more.

20 minutes later she hands me my order. No napkins. No condiments. Took it back to work. Ate a couple of bites and threw it away. Couldn't. Lost my appetite. Lost faith in mankind. Boy are we in trouble. 

I forgot to mention, while all this was going on, her 7-year-old daughter (I feel sorry for her because she's going to grow up just like her trashy mom) is sitting in the damn dining area watching Youtube videos (loud) or something; not really a big del, babysitters/dare care cost a lot, I get it; but in the context of everything that happened, it definitely doesn't help. 

I'm usually vocal about customer service and speaking/standing up for myself, but as I've mentioned several times, this unfortunate series of events just shut down my psyche. The chemical reaction in my body went to ""sleep mode"", rather than, I don't know.... uh... murder? 

Anyways, if someone, anyone, the owner, the managers, someone who is not trashy, is reading this, you might want to add a dollar to whatever hourly wage you're giving these trashy people you hire.

I'll tell you this: Every opportunity I get, I will go out of my way to ensure that everyone knows that there's most likely snot from the scummy people you hired. You guys have no standards.  I will NEVER come here again, I don't care about how many locations this ""organization"" has. 

You should be ashamed of yourself. Keep my money. There's no way I'm taking this review off Yelp.

P.S. The place smelled like fetus sh*t too. Forgot to mention that little detail. Screw you YELP for not giving me the option to choose ZERO stars.",im_hgYOpTpXP8ZZ0aUe5fg,2,1,1,ondeHNNQJhAv1WRkoTgOUw

Use either fresh Romano, or at least canned whole tomatoes, to create your own sauce. The base cheese is mostly mozz - could benefit from a 50/35/10/5 mix of mozz, jack, white cheddar and grated parmesan. There is no topping cheese mix - any of a combo of Parmesan/Romano etc, would work. I ordered on Grubhub  - the half-bucket of wings is advertised as 16-20 pieces. I got exactly 16 pieces - which is, what I expect, is the norm. If you are going to offer a ""Half-Bucket"", then be specific in the number of wings you are delivering.

This is the only spot I order pizza from in Vegas and it's open 24hours!!!,TK9tx5CzfHbxSCQccvFnZQ,0,0,5,mZpkzQ8tSrS_2MhtRpajzA

We called and asked for them to just talk to their employees who put their flyers under our timeshares door (The Grandview at Las Vegas) and they were just rude and the women who answered the phone would not let any of us speak to the ACTUAL MANAGER. I am a student and they stole my laptop with all my school work on it to finish off this semester and graduate. I tried to call the police, but you know how Las Vegas police are if it's not a killing or a shooting nothing really gets done. Do not support this business. Full of Shady individuals who will sadly get what's coming to them sooner of later.",DHbSfmWvVOEWp7IYBxAzqA,2,0,1,9JV2nVZVfnSqxp13nWcPag

My PREGNANT daughter in law wanted some food after taking care of my grandson all day and was exhausted and hungry, she found Sophia's on Grub Hub and placed an order. We placed the order around 10:40p. The delivery time was supposed to be between 11:30-11:40p. It didn't get there till after midnight... so we were waiting for about an hour and a half. The food arrives and the entire order is wrong. We asked for pepperoni and got cheese pizza. The wing order was wrong and our fries were missing. 

We contacted Grub Hub the next day because we were obviously too exhausted to deal with the mistakes that night. It took Grub Hub about a day to get in touch with us and they offered to refund us $2... what a joke! So then we contacted Sophia's the next day. A manager answered and said he'd have to contact the owner. I asked him if he had my number and he said he had it in the caller ID and that the owner would call me back. She didn't. So today (third day of trying to take care of this), I call again. 

A woman answered and was trying to give me the run around yet again. As I patiently explained what happened, I started getting more and more aggravated as she kept insulting me by saying things like we should have called that night since they are open for 24 hours and that we couldn't have been too tired to call that night since we ordered food late... seriously??? We ordered food 1 1/2 hours prior to its arrival. Not all of us stay up until the crack of dawn. When I told her the pizza didn't have pepperoni, she said they put the pepperoni UNDER the cheese. Who are they trying to play here? There was NO pepperoni anywhere on that pizza. We took one bite because we were famished and it was so gross we had to throw it out. We tried to eat the wings and they were so bland, we had to toss those too.

Finally this woman agreed to refund our money but that she was going to report us to Grub Hub to blacklist us. Seriously? I'll be checking my account everyday & if it doesn't come through I'll be contacting Channel 13.

The only negative i have for them is that i feel like crap after eating it most of the time but that is because i eat way too much of it.",LUW7TG4M-6_WLn070Rvthw,3,0,4,dqlF_0pqkf9ip6hcxcj3Jg
