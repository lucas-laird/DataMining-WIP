The menu said 8 oz burger. So you expect ONE burger not two small dry patties. Whoever decided to serve two dry flavorless burgers NOT cooked to order should be fired. I told the server this was one of the worst burgers I've ever had. She practically shrugged which irritated me and prompted me to ask for the manager to come over. I don't know whose lack of caring was worse the server or Pat the manager. What a disappointment and waste of FORTY DOLLARS!!

The salmon dinner my husband and I shared was excellent with mango salsa and a baked potato.  Could have had more vegetables, but the fish was cooked perfectly.  My 2 sons ordered burger and fries.

If you're not in the mood to dress up and go someplace fancy, but you still want high end food like filet minion, lobster and crab legs, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is nice, but casual. The food is great. Your meal starts off with great soft dinner rolls and PRETZEL ROLLS(! )which are a delicious change of pace. I had the petit filet with crab legs. The filet was cooked well as I asked, and they butterflied it so that it would cook more evenly. The crab legs were meaty and pre split so you didn't have to crack them. A huge baked potato and mixed veggies accompanied the meal. My husband had the prime rib with shrimp scampi as his ""surf"". The shrimp were huge and the sauce was great. The portions are very generous and there is no way that you can have room for dessert, so I can't judge those, but the meal was awesome and the service was very attentive.",GKQgCULAuiVur--lP_0tkQ,0,0,5,Qo_xcRnFpJbHZNqCZVmx4A

124267,2012-03-27,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"After living in Vegas for over 8 years now I've eaten quite a few burgers all over town, but since starting this blog I've had to look at many of them in a whole new light. One burger I've eaten many times is the one at All-American Bar & Grille at the Rio because I used to work down the street. I remembered it being decent, but how does it hold up now that I'm being completely subjective?

The front seating area of All-American is a fairly clean, loud area with a big bar and lots of TV's, open directly into the equally loud and slightly more hideous casino floor. It's great for people watching as the Rio doesn't always attract the most savory folks. It was especially great the day I went for my burger, as NASCAR was in town. Need I say more? The back seating area of the restaurant is a bit 'nicer'; if you're coming here for a steak you might want to eat back there.

Both the lunch and dinner menus are fairly similar, featuring a wide variety of steaks and pretty much every generic thing offered in all bars across the country. The choice of the day for me was the All-American Classic Burger which I got with sautéed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and the standard lettuce, tomato and onions. What gets served to you is a decent presentation, but I was a bit disappointed by the waffle fries that I immediately saw on my plate as I'm typically not a fan and I wasn't given a choice for anything else. The meat had decent flavor, but was way overcooked from the medium-rare I had ordered, while my friend's medium was cooked how I would have liked. Did they mix up our orders or can they just not cook to order properly? The bun had good flavor, but was a bit too thick and way too dry. The sautéed mushrooms had peppery good flavor, and the Swiss was melted and tasted good. And while I used maybe  of the lettuce they provided me, all of the veggies were fresh and good as well.

My waffle fries as I mentioned were quite disappointing; kind of stale, not very hot and pretty generic. For years coming to All-American I remembered getting a basket of random fries; some waffle, curly, skinny, and fat. That would have been more welcome as I liked the variety, even if it seemed like you were always eating from a mixed bottom of the barrel.

Overall the burger was good, but nothing out of this world. $12.99 is probably about right for a casino location such as this, but I think it's a little steep for what it is. Plus the service has typically been less than stellar every time I've been there. I think on this particular trip our waitress took our food order and drink order at the same time. Talk about being prompt. There probably aren't too many other choices off the strip by the Rio, but if you're at the property and want a burger you can't go wrong, just don't go out of your way to come here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,cOBYsloYvTcGbJjOBSnBTQ
125329,2013-09-28,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"Was in town for the day (April 13th) with family for drag races. We opted to stay at the Rio since they had a parking lot accommodating for all of their trailers, cars etc. This place seemed like it would be good for a quick bite, not so much. Where to start:20 minute wait to be seated turned into 30. Drinks were ordered right away but waited another 15 minutes after drinks were dropped off before waiter came to take our order. Now over all the food wasn't horrible but mediocre and over priced at best... I think the best thing was the version of a wedge salad.Not hard to screw up. Shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 jumbo shrimp with a lemon wedge,saltines and a tiny cup of sauce $14..no thanks. Oysters Rockefeller $15 and ate 2 of the 6..oyster was beyond small and drowning in so much tasteless gooey sauce.Long story short save the time and money go else where.",rajiewsNaAf7I7UeISmmhg,0,0,2,yUywK0VjLdLYhVWfF71tyQ

180896,2011-02-16,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"This was the only decent place to eat at the Rio, I stayed the last week of January and I ate at this restaurant about three times. 

The place is just as it sounds it's all american food and their main focus is the aged steaks they have which I didn't get to try since I didn't have too much money to spend. The food alone is going to be pricey no matter where you go to eat.

The service was great and the server we had was very attentive. I had their bean dip a couple of times and the last night I went I found a hair in the dip so I lost my appetite but they were nice enough to not make me pay for the dip. Their Cesar salads were good and so was the shrimp. One of the nights I had the mini corn dogs and fries which were also delicious. 

Each soda refill isn't free which I found out when I got my bill. But besides that everything was great.

I would recommended others to eat here if you are at the Rio but I don't think i'll be back since I probably won't stay at the Rio again for other reasons.",yEeClTP1kPV0zKjJmt-UAQ,0,0,4,-FzcitMdMAj1MewwZkLUvw
203338,2015-10-19,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. My husband and I are staying for 10 days house hunting and not big fans of strip - dining thanks to the overwhelming prices and super fancy food (which is nice, but not for every day). However, this place is tastey- with large portions and a comfortable atmosphere and although the prices are a bit high, it's worth it IMO. The front is more bar like: tables, bar booths, and video gambling at the bar with tv's for sports if you're into that. My favorite is the back part with spacious booths and a gorgeous fireplace, also very quiet! 

Not going to lie, I've only ever ordered one thing- it was what I ordered the first time we went there and I love it so much I just keep ordering it....the turkey burger. It comes with smoked gouda, sautéed onions, lettuce, tomato, and onion on a wheat bun. The meat is super flavorful (well seasoned). The bun is honestly always a little crumbly (I think they ""warm"" it) which normally I hate, but it doesn't mess with the final product to me, so it doesn't bother me. It's that good! I always order it with a baked potato and the potato is always half the size of my plate! I love potatoes, so huge win! My husband always orders the same burger I do, only with different sides. He had the baked macaroni and he loved the bits of ham and peas. Fries were good too. 

Our drinks are always full and never have issues with service. They are always polite and quick and the manager roaming around always greets us and checks up on us. Our last visit we arrived just barely 25 min before closing and service was still on point and they didn't rush us out.

519048,2015-05-31,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"Well the wife wanted aged meat for her birthday meal. Based on our past experience several years ago this was the place. Well there is no more aged meats at all. We decided to eat anyway. Clam chowder did actually have clams in it but was more like clams in a watery mashed potato mix. She had a bone-in rib eye 18 ounce steak which looked like it had lost about six ounces while being cooked. Not all that great either. I had the Shrimp Scampi with Linguine. It was far from being shrimp scampi. More like a alfredo sauce.

This place and other sites on the internet say the pricing is good at between $15-25 dollars per person. Just two lousy ice teas are $7.00. My CUP not Bowl of clam chowder was $7.00. A can of Progresso soup is better and only $1.88 last time i shopped for food. So for the $15-25 you might get 2 drinks (lousy pepsi products, iced tea or lemonade) and a couple appetizers for that amount but you're not going to get anything descent for $15-$25. Just a plain cheeseburger here is $14.00.  Based on our meal a burger at In & Out will taste better and cost only a few dollars if that.

No plans on ever going back again. For the price I would have rather eaten at Roy's Hawaiian Fusion on Flamingo.

Judging by the lack of conversation and the quickly cleaned plates, the steaks were pretty delicious too. The portions were generous. The prices were pretty fair, especially for LV.

1503524,2013-06-30,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"In a word, overpriced. I know most casino restaurants are, but this place listed burgers for $13 and I just didn't feel they were worth it. The mushroom-onion burger has an ample amount of tasty grilled onions, but the fries were somehow the star. They were crisp outside, and soft inside, and just the right temperature. This is one of the times I was a little glad that the portion wasn't too big, as I would have gulped down as many as they'd given me.

The soup was not a good choice though- the French onion is only available in a bowl size, so I expected something larger than what I got, especially when it was priced at $8 and was more of an appetizer than a meal (which is what I'd ordered it for). Add to this that the soup itself was completely unremarkable, and you might understand my frustration.

The customer service could also use a boost- one employee came by and asked for our drink order, only to be followed by another asking for our drink order and appetizer order RIGHT behind him. I understand that maybe they didn't know whose table it was, but the second guy (who we got stuck with the rest of our visit) was not as friendly and rubbed me the wrong way. For starters, he seemed frustrated that we didn't immediately place an order for a $12 appetizer the second our butts hit the seats and when we didn't have our meal order ready the moment he returned with our drinks, he rudely warned us that he was ""going to step away for 60 seconds and be back"", as if to make a point that we'd specifically said we needed an extra 'minute'. Maybe it was his attempt at humor or sarcasm, but it came off as rude and immediately gave our visit a negative tone.

Waited for the manager who was not on the floor at the time, and all he knocked off the bill was my $7 beer, which the waitress had forgotten to put on the bill in the first place (I made the mistake of not looking at the bill before he came over, so I was caught off guard). I thought the burger should have been comped, but my husband doesn't like confrontation, and we had a guest with us, so I didn't push it.

If he had taken the burger off the bill I may have been less inclined to write this review, but there you have it.

Ate lunch here twice on 3/9 (sat at a table) and 3/10 (sat at the bar.)

Per their website: ""We feature a contemporary atmosphere with fireplaces surrounded by two waterfalls in the dining room. We also feature a sports bar with over 10 plasma TVs where we serve appetizers, fresh squeezed juices for an afternoon margarita and our famous Angus beef hamburgers.""

Beautiful bar with Flat Screen TVs and Video Slot/Poker machines embedded in parts of the bar (beware it makes it awkward to eat if you have it right in front of you!)

I had the same thing both times because it was so darn good... The Avocado BLT on Sourdough bread. Great bacon, great avocado (I could have used more!) great toasted bread, very good fries (mix of waffle cut, curly, regular) Combined with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, an excellent combination. My boss had a burger on the Monday, he said it was very good.

Service was good (though they were packed a lunch time both days). Guy next to me had a strip steak on a salad that looked really good.

Anyway, my friend and I decided to start with the spinach & artichoke dip.  It was ok however I did enjoy the bagel chips that are served with this appetizer.  We also split the Turkey Club on sourdough.  Their sandwiches are served with fries which is perfect for sharing.  Again the sandwich was ok but nothing outstanding.

Since the tables are close, we chatted a bit with the woman next to us who gave the wrong room for her bill to be added to.  I jokingly said to the waiter ""sorry we are making it hard for you"" and she replies ""its OK I am used to people doing it"" with no smile or sign of sarcasm/humor and just walks away.  

I had to flag the waiter down after approximately 20 minutes to inquire about the milkshake.  She forgot about it.  Thirty-one minutes from the time we ordered I receive the milkshake (I know this for a fact because I sent a text message right when we ordered).

So we decided to go to All American Bar and Grill for a light supper.  It was packed but we luck out and got a table overlooking the casino.

Looking over the menu which had a lot of good selections we decided and ordered , 1/2 dozen of Chicken Wings plain served with Blue Cheese Dressing $11.00 and a order of custom Fries, served with Parmesan Cheese and a side of Ranch Dressing $6.00 , a Reuben Sandwich which came with a side of your choice we chose the Chili Lime Fries for $14.00.

First of all I like my wings lightly dusted with flour or none at all fried crisp and tossed with seasoning or sauce served hot, the way All American executed their wings they were heavily coated with a batter and fried which left them soggy but one good thing the blue cheese dressing definitely stay on the wing they were just not my flavor profile ,same with the fries I would have loved them to be toss while hot with the parmesan cheese but it was on the side and the cheese could not stick because they were served warm. The Reuben the other dish at the table which I tasted was served on marble rye bread with corned beef, swiss cheese, sauerkraut , russian dressing , and grill all the right ingredients but it fell short not enough corned beef and the sauerkraut just didn't have the tang of a good sauerkraut my Husband did comment and stated not the worse but surely not the best and I agree. Served with fries in a brown paper bag with the chile lime seasoning on the side ,I personally like this concept but again fries were warm and seasoning did not stick well when shaken. 

Service was excellent , seating was good , food fell a little short that night but in their defense it was extremely busy .  Don't forget to check in on your Yelp app for one free Draft Beer which hit the spot , and of course we had a wonderful evening now on to round 2 !",78lSMnppchL8-yN06z4Q8A,90,72,3,jjLOnmA9hlZqEJVO9sQWYw

Overall - I've really liked everything that I've had. I would have given it a five star except a few servers were just OK.

On the burgers side - the Chili Burger is really good but large. It's a great item to share. On the Vegan side - the Black Bean and Quinoa burger on a Gluten Free bun is really good. I think you have to accept that you're not eating meat, but the texture of the patty is really good. I normally also like veggie burgers and alternative types of patties so perhaps I'm more liberal in my thoughts but the ingredients that make this patty are not a mystery, they are fresh beans and quinoa.

I just went there tonight and I shared a full rack of ribs with my husband and it was sooooo enough of a share plate. It also comes with a huge baked potato (dollar extra to have it loaded - we did!) and veggies. I had come to expect their food to be pretty good, but the ribs were excellent.

The burgers and sandwiches force you to really grab hold with both hands to wrangle them in your mouth, or at least wonder if you need to wuss out and ask for a knife and fork. Remember when the $6 burger was deemed classy, well let's leave that at CJ's these burgers are +$12. I am impressed with their waffle fries, always crispy and perfectly seasoned it really hits the spot for junk food. 

Chicken strips have much chicken flavor and is tender and juicy, perfect finger food and filling when you just want a tasty bite to eat and move on to the fun stuff in Vegas.

For dinner, the steaks are actually pretty good. Real quality steakhouse style with criss-cross char marks and all! With the meat grilled on a mesquite-wood fired grill you can taste. At first you can't really tell what a nice place this is from, since the first thing you see is the sports-bar out front. 

For drinks just go with a beer to wash everything down. I tried their iced tea, both regular and passion fruit and they were disappointing.

So I opted for a small Caesar salad and half dozen buffalo chicken wings. Big mistake. I wasted $20. The Caesar isn't fancy anyway so how can you screw it up?? With very little, if not processed Parmesan cheese and very light to no flavor Caesar Dressing. 

The Buffalo Wings looked hearty, but as I picked them up, they are lightly battered which I was not happy about. They were slightly soggy. Once I got passed the batter, there wasn't much meat on the bone. Forgive the grotesque picture but that's the batter I plucked off wings. 

Thank goodness I had jerky, nuts and pork rinds to snack on. Very disappointed. 

As far as the staff, well... your typical bar staff. I was told by three different people they would be right with me. Then two disappeared. One of the guys finally took my order.",mi2opdSKjAnBuJ9QoI6OlQ,1,0,2,qCi9DAvasxsyBsjPaEtPjQ

What we thought to be a burger joint turned out to be a full-blown steakhouse where they age and butcher their own steaks.

The most recent visit was alright.  It was the Monday after 4th of July and I think it was the  2nd or 3rd day of the World Series of Poker, which was also being held at the Rio.  It was REALLY busy in the hotel and in this particular restaurant (the hotel's buffet line had at least an hour wait and the cafe was not open until 4 PM...it was about 3:00 and we were STARVED)

We were seated quickly (did not have to wait at all) and our drink orders were taken promptly as were our food orders.  15 minutes later, our drinks (1 corona and an iced tea) still had not arrived and a second server stopped by our table to inform us that he would ""be back to take a drink order.""  My companion informed the polite server that our drink orders AND food orders had already been put in 15 minutes ago. The second server, Steve, I think, apologized and went to check on things in the kitchen.

Our food and drinks arrived shortly thereafter.

Me companion had a Blue Cheese Burger and a Basket of Chicken Wings.  The chicken wings were hot and tasty and crispy with hot sauce and ranch served on the side.  The burger must have been alright because I didnt hear any complaints.

I ordered a chicken sandwich (which came up as ""Chix Monster"" on the receipt haha). The Chicken breast was grilled and juicy.  It came topped with a roasted poblano, jack cheese and 1/4 avocado (though it said guacamole on the menu), as well as lettuce, tomato and thin sliced pickle strips.  

My 2-year old had a basket of Chicken Fingers off the appetizer section, since they did not have a kid's menu.  

Our entrees all came with a mix of waffle-cut and regular french fries.  The portions were generous and despite the wait, our food was hot, fresh-tasting and properly seasoned.

We were offered dessert for the wait, but politely declined (we were SO full and just wanted to go back to the pool :)).",ahj9FxM6MQBU501LGypcCQ,0,0,3,4GorMcnVqd-sIPUhGSrSgA

There were beers listed on the menu, but no wines. I asked the waiter for a wine list. He told me could tell me the wines available by the glass. He rattled off five choices, including two Cabernets. I was not familiar with either of them, but he told me they were ""both from California.""

3209117,2013-02-26,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"This is your very basic, run of the mill bar and grill located in the Rio.  It is right off the main gaming floor and pretty easy to find if you come in the front doors (where the taxi's drop you).  

It has a full bar and lots of things like burgers, hot dogs, quesadillas and meatloaf.  Sort of diner food, but a little more Vegas glitzy.  Nothing here will rock your world, but you do get large portions for the big prices they charge.  They are a member of Total Rewards, so if you have that card you can get a discount.  

Service was friendly, the place seemed clean, but it was one of the loudest places I have been to dine in Vegas (and that is saying something).  I could not hear my husband across the table without him yelling and then I still only heard every few words!

Main course: (Me) NY Steak cooked Med-Well w/ baked potato (Friend) Filet Mignon cooked Med w/ baked potato 

My steak was a bit over cooked but still flavorful and delicious. My friends steak on the other hand was still squirming on the plate and bleeding all over the place. If it was me, I would have sent the steak back immediately, but because it took so long to get initially he sucked it up and ate it. The veggies were a bit on the salty side but still good.

The best part of the dinner was when the fire alarm went off and nobody seemed to know what to do so they went about things as usual, like it was a common occurrence.

Dessert was good. I had Red Velvet cake, it was flavorful and moist, and my friend had cheesecake that was pretty fabulous.

We had reservations for a party of nine - and they were able to seat us in about 5 minutes of our 6:45 p.m. reservation time.  We sat in the very back of the restaurant against a three tiered fireplace that made one side of the table very warm.  The three tables that were put together to accommodate us were uneven by about an inch.  We sat there for quite awhile before someone came to take our drink order - and 15 minutes later the drinks came and appetizers came.  We tried to order our meals then, but the waiter said he'd be right back.  Another wait..... Then, one of the drinks on the table moved (by itself due to the pooled up condensation of water under the glass) and tipped off the edge of one table and on to the other and spilled.  Half the drink ended up in a bowl of artichoke dip.  That caused the waiter to come over to help clean it up - but we were not offered a refill the drink, no compensation for our now ruined appetizer - and a belated warning (that was already obvious) of the uneven tables with no solution to straighten it out or offer to move somewhere else.

The place was pretty busy. I had good service, but a few other patrons waited a good bit of time for their Chicken Caesar Salads (I wasn't the only one with healthy aspirations!)

3326189,2009-01-22,1,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"I visited All-American Bar & Grille over the weekend.  My friend had a $75 food voucher, and she suggested we spend it here.  She asked that I pay the tip, which seemed too good of a deal to pass up.

The Grille is located right on the casino floor, so the dining area is a little noisy.  There are plenty of flat screen TVs hanging above the bar, so you won't miss the game you are betting on.  The decor is industrial and simple: brushed stainless steel with light colored wooden accents.  If it weren't for the unmistakable ""ding-ding-ding"" of the slot machines, one would feel as though they were dining at an airport bar.

The waiter who took our order was not the waiter who brought our food.   Yet another waiter inquired if we needed anything else, and the fourth waiter actually brought it to us.  They also thought, for some reason, that one set of utensils should be sufficient for both of us.  Ehhhh, guess again.  

Look, I am all for teamwork and delegation, but someone has to be responsible.  There's a reason why every CPR instructor teaches you to POINT at someone and say ""YOU!  Call 911!""  If you just said ""someone, call 911"" no one would do it, because no one would know who is responsible.  Waiting tables is not a matter of life and death, of course, but the same rules apply.  

By the way, the waiters' uniform is a polo shirt with wide horizontal stripes.  The shirts were similar to the ones the host of Blue's Clues used to wear on every show.  What is up with that?  Not exactly the most slimming outfit, is it?

As for the food, we both ordered steaks.  They have various cuts, each available in USDA Choice Beef or Dry-Aged Angus Beef.  The latter, naturally, is more expensive (about $10 more per cut).  I went with the 18-oz Angus NY Strip for $34.95.  Keep in mind that the price included mashed potatoes and a mix of boiled carrots and peas.  My steak was cooked medium rare, but it was fiber-y and slightly dry.  Also, the steak was on the bone, so 18 oz wasn't as big as one might think.  The sides were just average.  After waiter #2 dropped off my steak, it took me a while to flag waiter #3 to get waiter #4 to bring me some horseradish.  My friend had a fillet, rare, which she seemed to have enjoyed thoroughly.  I also ordered a side salad, with creamy Italian dressing.  The salad was very fresh, the dressing - delicious, and the serving - big enough to share.

Our bill for two steaks with all the fixin's, a salad and 2 iced teas came to $72.50.  We gave the waiter our $75 voucher, and I added $12 in cash for a generous 20% tip.  So, for $12 out of pocket, it was a tremendous value.  If I'd had to pay $87, I would have probably been a little more disappointed.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,1,1,3,41tENKct9IBL4Ho81HRXQQ

3577011,2011-01-23,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"The All-American Bar & Grille is where I'll usually go to eat at the Rio.  I'm a poker player and during the WSOP everyone I know prefers to go there as well.  Even when it's not WSOP time, however, I'll make the trek over there occasionally.  If you just want to drop in for a bite to eat, use the valet, otherwise you're going to walk across half the casino to get there.

It's a bit cramped and almost always busy inside, although you won't have to wait to be seated.  There's a bar and a number of tables out front, facing the table games, and at least half a dozen TVs tuned to various sports channels, not that you can hear any of them.  What I didn't know until the third or fourth time I was there was that there's actually a back part to the restaurant which is at least twice the size of the main part and has a totally different ambiance.  That area is much more suitable for large groups or just when they're busy.  A couple of TVs are in the back, but there are also water features, softer lighting, and a fake fireplace.

AAB&G has standard ""American"" fare -- burgers, steaks, chicken, fries, and quite a few seafood dishes as well.  Service can be hit or miss, but it's generally good, and food tends to arrive in a reasonable amount of time.  

I've had the chicken fingers, they are pretty good, although the chicken wings are far better, and I would normally prefer to eat chicken fingers rather than chicken wings anywhere else.  The wings are so well done, in fact, that I'll usually eat them without sauce which is also something I wouldn't do anywhere else.  Another appetizer which is really great is the prime rib & fried onion quesadilla.  It's really good and if you just got it and the chicken wings from the appetizers menu you could easily be satisfied with those two alone as a good meal.  The burgers are very good and quite large.  I usually get one with bacon and cheddar.  They are served with a mix of fries that include the normal fast food fries, waffle fries, and curly fries.  Sometimes they can oversalt these, however.  

Expect to spend around $20 per person or so after a tip, maybe a tad more if you get an appetizer, but I can guarantee you that you won't say something like ""I could have just gone to McDonalds instead and spent $5"".",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,4,qWVvBpFTSVYcCv3jB91hwQ

He was creative with my milkshake request and didn't tell me what it was, just the way I like it. But if I had to guess, it was chocolate, strawberry, and peanut butter. The T-bone was cooked to perfection, rare and a little bloody. The busser was always refilling our drinks and never had to asked once for a refill. The fried ice cream is what I always get and once again, it didn't disappoint.

We came to this place because we didn't want to eat at Burger King. We were seated quickly in the wee hours of the night and out server approached our table without delay. Our quaint table of 4 individuals were comprised of locals as well as family visiting from the nearby kingdom of California. Fantasized by the soups, we asked if we could get a sample of the beer cheese soup. Our request was obliged and our server brought us over soufflé cups to taste. I would say that it wasn't the most appetizing thing on the menu, but it wasn't dreadful either. 

We ended up ordering the sliders, which contained thick pieces of meat and were actually not that bad. If you think the price is ok then I would recommend it, especially to our friends that need food after a night of debauchery. We ended up getting a dessert of a chocolate cake with a thick layer of fudge all around. We requested the dessert to be warmed, but apparently the limitations of the fudge do not allow the food to be warmed as it melts the cake, according to our server. The cake was paired with a nice glass of milk. I recommend the short cup.

Came here three times- one for lunch and twice for dinner. 

Not bad!

LUNCH: 
Ordered a Turkey Burger with yummy goodness on it - onions, lettuce, mushrooms, etc. It was pretty filling with fries too! I was really surprised at how full I was. 

Lunch Service: 
Pretty fast and efficient. We needed to get out of there a certain time to catch a speaker for the convention. I was dressed normal, so they sat me in the center where everyone can see me. 

DINNER #1:
I was dressed as THE BORG QUEEN and looked scary as f**k. So they sat us at the corner of the room. It was quite funny because NO one could see me. HAHAHA... i guess to not freak people out. I did look freaky. https://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/jOKSDbfa_Zx0qm6KVhq6Lg/l.jpg

FOOD:
I ordered a Clam Chowder soup cup - it was good. Not salty at all and came with crackers. It was a small amount but I wasnt hungry so it satiated me. 

SERVICE:
Slow. It felt like they never came to our area - could be my costume - but man... it took forever to get them to come give us the bill. We were in a hurry again!

DINNER #2:
I was dressed somewhat normal - but I looked like myself. So they sat us with people again. I just wanted dessert because it was late. I got a root beer float! It was good but really small for the cost. -_-

SERVICE:
Standard. Not too fast, not too slow. They got confusing at times because the guy didnt speak perfect English and it took my friend awhile to get the beer. 

AMBIANCE:
Bar scene
Lots of TVs
Good for groups

PARKING: It's Vegas

SMELL OF SMOKE: Nope.

 So after we placed our order and prior to that (RICH who was our server) we placed our drink order and was brought out quickly and precise. Everything came at once two big trays with all of our orders ( 7 adults and one child ) after everyone received their meal I was expecting someone would complain about they were missing this or that, nothing was amiss! I ordered the Blue Cheese burger well done and instead of fries I upgraded to the onion rings. The burger was cooked how I asked and it was a good flavor combination with the Blue cheese.

I only have one complaint about the onion rings, you can tell they are fresh battered dip because they were stuck together and pulling them apart some of the batter wasn't cooked but overall not bad ( I spoke to the chef Larry and mentioned it to him and said I should have mentioned that I had a problem with them. It was such a large portion that what I didn't eat was not a loss. ( and I came hungry! )
All the while our waiter RICH would check on us as well as his assistant server ANTHONY would refill our drinks when they started going low.

On the way out I wanted to let the manager know how much the meal we had tonight was enjoyed by all at the table.

Again after reading the good bad and the ugly comments on here, I would definitely throw caution to the wind on these comments. I understand people have an off night and sometimes they have a stellar night. 

I would suggest for anyone coming here in the future ask for Chef Larry or the manager Luigi instead of not trying to make a bad situation better.

So instead of biting nearby strangers , while we search for a food network owned restaurant , we decided it would be better for everyone if we just ate the the 1st place we came too. So glad we did . I had the grilled chicken Cobb salad $18. It was huge!! The chicken Breast was seasoned & grilled perfect and juicy. My husband had the turkey Club sandwich $16. It came with a side of fries , which almost all items do. Beware (It seems all restaurants are pricing their drinks between $3.50-$5.00 in Vegas) the drinks were $3.50 - serious waste of $

I'd say service overall was good; better than at some other dining establishments at the Rio, but not up to the standard of on-Strip properties like the Wynn.

However, the actual food was pretty inconsistent -- drinks weren't great, and while some of the steaks were correct as ordered, others were overcooked (I'd accept a one level discrepancy, but medium rare should not be well done).

I'm not sure how much of this was due to the restaurant being busy vs. routine.  However, they did adjust the bill to reflect problems, so we were overall pretty happy.

Olive oil, salt and pepper marinade, and when it is on a SCRAPED grill, butter, butter, butter. You will gain a lot of fans if you begin to cook your steak this way.

Their website lists the average price per person as $15, which is total bollocks since nothing on the menu is under $15, it seems.  Way overpriced for what you get and the service was incredibly slow.

We had a friend in from out of town, so we went to see Penn & Teller. We thought we'd get a nice bite before we saw the show, but didn't feel like going the ""fine dining"" route.  So we stopped in here around 7pm on a Wednesday night and waited about 5-10 minutes before we were seated, which was fine.

The menu was weirdly limiting. One steak, one chicken dish, one fish dish. Caesar salad with shrimp, steak or chicken. A couple kinds of soup. Potato skins and bar food.  I didn't notice any burgers or sandwiches or pastas... nothing a well rounded place would serve. The Rio website indicated this was kind of a casual steakhouse, whereas the reality is more of a sports bar, hence the bar food and limited dining room menu.

We finally got our orders in, then sat for 29 minutes without so much as a basket of bread (which we finally had to ask for since we were starving) when the table next to us, seated after we were, had already enjoyed bread, salad and were digging into their entrees. I had to ask the waiter to go back and check on our food, which he brought out a few minutes later. Two caesar salads and a grilled chicken breast took 35 minutes.

We asked if there was a locals discount and he said no, that we had to be club members. Since it's a Caesar's resort, we had one of those cards and he agreed to give us a discount, which I appreciated given the situation. It came out to be like $14 off, which tempered the ridiculously high price for a Caesar salad a bit.

I'd never eat here again and wouldn't recommend it unless a friend was staying at the hotel and couldn't venture anywhere else. I'm sure it's fine for a beer and a hot dog or nachos while you're watching the game, but with a place that's made up mostly of restaurant tables, it's not much of a restaurant.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,1,0,2,9Fl43lEEaLurjOhRsvxfCw

The New York steak was perfectly cooked and had a great taste. This dish was delivered with vegetables and a big potato. The service was also very good and the prices were reasonable for the strip.

4905080,2011-11-09,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"The All-American Bar & Grille (AAB&G) is located inside the RIO Hotel & Casino. There are two distinct areas of the AAB&G. The front half is a bar area with seating & TVs to catch the sports events, and a dining area in the back. The food is good and so is the service. As the name implies, it is ""American Pub fare"" with a selection of salads mixed in too. This is a great place to have a hamburger & beer after a round of golf or a day at the pool. It is also a good place to go for BBQ, steak, or prime rib too. We have eaten there since the Rio opened in 1991. 

Over the years, the menu has expanded to include many more varieties of beer, appetizers, and entrees. There is something for everyone on their menu. The only unfortunate part is that the prices have really increased. No way, no how, a cheese burger & fries should be over $10, and I don't care how good it is. A domestic bottle beer is now $5, and really should be closer to $3. Bar management should realize that the more reasonable drink prices are, the more beverages their patrons will consume. Of course, I'm not the one paying their rent, but the prices that they are charging today no longer qualify it as a good value. That is the only shortcoming that I can see with AAB&G.

4973812,2008-09-18,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,"There were ten hungry girls in my party and we were ready to eat.  Unfortunately, the service is my biggest complaint about this place.  I'm not sure if it's because the waitress wasn't used to working our section (our table was the only one she had in this section), they were understaffed, or she just disappeared a lot.

Not once, but twice, someone from our party had to go look for our waitress.  It took awhile for the food to come out, but then again, we noticed other tables hadn't gotten their food yet either and they arrived before us.

One of the girls mentioned that we still hadn't received any bread yet, and that almost caused an uproar.  (Did I mention there were ten hungry girls at my table?)  When the bread arrived, round rolls that reminded me of a soft pretzels and big fluffy rolls with whipped butter, were vacuumed up!

Our foot arrived soon after, and maybe it's because we all stuffed ourselves silly with the bread, but pretty much no one finished their meal!  

I ordered the ""Spit Roasted Free-Range Chicken (1/2 Chicken) for $19.99.  All entrees include vegetables, a choice of house rice pilaf, baked potato or mashed Yukon potatoes.""  You can add a stuffed potato for $2.50 more.  I chose the Baked Potato and it was a huge spud!  Of course, my chicken was way too much for me to eat, but I devoured as much of it as I could.  There were parts of it that were dry, but that's a bit expected with roasted chicken, right?

Other girls ordered the Broiled NY Steak Caesar Salad or the AAB&G Grilled New York Steak Salad for $11.99 and their portions were huge.  The steak doesn't come in strips, it's a piece of steak sitting on your salad leaves!  The French Onion Soup Gratinee for $5.99 was also generous too.  And the Buttermilk Battered Chicken Fingers ($8.99) remain untouched, only because the girl had stuffed herself already!  We saw the French Onion & Cheddar Cheese Loaf ($6.99) go by and it was huge!  Definitely something you want to share!

One thing we did appreciate was the waitress was able to change a last minute order of Oysters Rockefeller ($11.99) to Blue Point Oysters (12 each at $15.99) without a hitch.

When I went to pay my bill, I wanted to pay separately so I could put it on the credit card. Unfortunately, the waitress made me wait until the rest of my party got their cash together before she took my card.  (Other restaurants have no problem running my card first, with the added gratuity, while the rest of the check is still being calculated!)  So that was a pain to have to wait even longer.
  
Overall, it's not a place that I would normally choose to eat at in a hotel on or near the strip. But it fit the budget we had and satisfied the meat desires of our group.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,3,3,6do9enTMnP9Ru5oOdBqGfA

The first time our waiter was totally lost. We were seated promptly but waited quite a long time before we even got a waiter to come up and acknowledge us, I think it was closer to 10min? Even then the service was pretty spotty. Never came to refill our drinks til we flagged someone down after they were empty for awhile. Unfortunately the food wasn't good either. I got a burger n fries and the fries were overdone to the point it was hard all the way to the core. My friend ordered a soda before our meal and he never got it! When he finally managed to grab our waiters attention to it, it was after we were done eating. I couldn't complain about the overdone fries til that time since our waiter seemed non-existant after we got our food til we saw and flagged him down at the end of our meal. At that my point my friend said don't even bother since we were done and ready to go. The atmosphere and prices are reasonable but I wasn't gonna ever go back.
The ironic part is about a year later, I was hanging with a friend visiting from out of town and we were gambling at the Rio and thats the only place open for food in middle of the night and we were both hungry. I was hesitant since my first experience. I even told that friend what happened that time. But my friend said nah, let's just eat here so I said ok. And what do you know, we end up with the exact same waiter I had the first time! I literally thought O. M. G. I tell him after the waiter walked away that this is the same waiter he was shocked too lol. Well maybe that first time was an anomaly and this time will be better right? WRONG. He basically served us similar to the first time, being pretty non-existant and he forgot something but I can't recall what item it was right now. Amazingly the fries were overdone again. I was starting to get the impression maybe someone there knew who I was and didnt like me? So deja vu haha.
I'm sure the service there can't always be that bad and maybe I just got the same bad waiter both times, who knows. But I definitely will not go there again if it can be helped. It's sad though since I have found it overall very good at the Rio except for AAB&G and one time at the craps table.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,0,0,1,hMjDi0S2WtlUBWMW3qsZNw

So I jumped on the hate-wagon and as we walked with sorrow and cursed the world, we came across the All-American Bar & Grill.  Hey, we're Americans, lets cheer up with some good ol' American eats!  

So I placed our name on the wait list and waited for about 30 minutes.  It felt fast because I went to gamble and made my lunch money.  Score!  Anyways, they called us and as we were walking to our table, we passed the kitchen which is smack dead in the middle and along the kitchen hall were slabs of butchered meat hanging behind a glass window.  Pretty awesome view and you can see the cooking action too.

Off to the gnitty gritty.  I ordered their burger (forgot the name, but it had sausages and jalapenos) and it was hugemongous.  In fact, everything we ordered were ginormous portions.  How can a little 135 lb guy like me devour a meal made for linebackers?  Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to!  The fries that came with my burger were mixed with criss-cut, curly, and regular fries.  We also started off with 50 wings (about $20) and it was very meaty, had the right amount of crisp, perfectly fried and if you add a drizzle of their ranch and hot sauce on top, you'd forget how much money you've blown at the craps table.  I also picked on my friend's 20 oz ribeye and it was very tender, perfectly grilled and charred.  Then I went to my other friend and tried her shrimp linguini and that blew me out of the water.  Shrimp was succulent and divine.  Then I invaded my last friend's pork chops and holy crap that was good too, but the piece I ate was slightly overcooked.

Overall, our server was kind of slow because it was a full house, but we received our food in 15 minutes and the wings are one of the best I've had and for $10, my burger was huge...a great meal!

I thought I'd eaten here about 10 years ago with my parents when they lived in Vegas, after this meal I'm not sure at all now.  I remember a primo steak house. This place served steak but they served everything in between as well.  

Chalk it up to being the end of a long day of driving and two very tired people. We couldn't decide on a restaurant and were not hungry enough or energetic enough to try a buffet. So we ended up here because I remembered it fondly.  It delivered well on the food, quality was excellent by all standards.  A bit pricey.  I think the caesar salad with steak on top was just under $20.  The point is, I was HAPPY with it. So it's ok.

Versatile menu and VERY enthusiastic and attentive waitstaff. They aim to please and just about bend over backward to give you what you want. Or what they think you want. As long as you are happy, then they are happy. NICE experience, even though i was tired and not in the mood for too much interaction.

I think I would rather try this place again when i can enjoy it more. Ambiance was great, service stellar. Food pretty darn awesome. It earned it's five stars!

This is one of the few non-smoking places you can find in any casino, so that was a huge plus for us. The beer selection was very good, the staff efficient, but the prices high. My wife got a Sam Adams in a bottle ($7) and poured it in a pint glass they gave her. The 12oz. of beer came close to the top of the ""pint"" glass. My pint of draft Lagunitas IPA ($7) was in the same glass, and after settling, had the same amount of beer in it.

5682979,2017-06-08,0,YRiQtFNteLUUEiGkdQ23vg,All-American Bar & Grille is your standard steak and burger establishment that underwhelms as far as taste goes but doesn't lack an energetic atmosphere.  The restaurant is seemingly divided into two sections: a casual area with full service bar and tables that allow people watching into the casino and a more formal dining room setting away from the hustle and bustle of the casino.  The freezer of aged steaks as you walk in is pretty neat.  I decided to try the preshow special menu with New England clam chowder and flank steak cooked medium.  The soup was standard New England clam chowder but I think the portion could have been slightly bigger.  The flank steak at first glance looked very juicy and tasty but upon first slice and bite it was quite tough to cut with a sharp edged steak knife and very tough to chew.  Overall the steak was overly salty and had me chugging water during my meal.  As I made my way towards the middle of the steak it was undercooked and looked rare more than medium.  The baked potatoe and veggies that accompanied the flank steak were actually better than the steak itself.  Overpriced steak and burger joint in my opinion based on the flavor of the food.  Overall service was decent but nothing special.,hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,0,0,3,XZbUR1889HQwOBiurLIw_w

Years ago we thought they gave you a lot of food for the money.

Now the past time we went we both agreed that the prices are crazy high.  Maybe because when we were tourists we did not care? I don't know what happened maybe we became locals?  

We both ordered a steak. I wanted mine rare and he got his med. Rare. Mine was like he ordered and his was more on the well done side, He did not want to send them back, we should have asked for the manager. He hates to claim but sometimes you have to let them know.

Service was ok, a little slow at times for refills on our tea.

We wouldn't go back we decided we would eat some place else here or go somewhere else,

The meat on these sliders are completely unseasoned....like to the point of unbelievability.

I'm not even going to focus on how the seven tables seated after us (only two of us) were served their food before we even received drinks.  Let's just focus on this microwave cuisine that they're serving at a ridiculous price.

I had the Classic Burger and added onion, bacon, and cheddar cheese.  Lives up to the name, really tasty, and ingredients were all fresh.  I asked for the burger medium rare and lo and behold it actually was - in fact it was perfect.  Being from Utah where burgers are legally required to be flame grilled right through on the fires of hell and few restaurants will even go near rare of any kind this was a nice change!  Fries were super awesome also.

My wife's quesadilla while okay was nothing to write home about but it at least hit the spot.
