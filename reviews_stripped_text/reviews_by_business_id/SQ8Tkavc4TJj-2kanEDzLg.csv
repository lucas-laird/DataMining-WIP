Initially, I was a little annoyed because it was really far away from my home in the Southwest. I was impressed by the nice open kitchen--I like being able to see how they are preparing my food. We ordered a HUGE--I mean HUGE pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, salad, and bomb.com cookie. The pizza was pretty good...the crust was crispy, and it had a good amount of cheese:pepperoni ratio. The garlic knots were okay, I have had better. The salad was the most impressive part! It was HUGE for only $3.99 and the ranch was yummy. It was spicy! 

The cookie...please, try the cookies they have. I thought they were muffins when I saw them on the counter, but the nice girl who told me to try one was one smart girl! They had huge chunks of belgian chocolate and were ooey gooey perfection!

then i went to visit family in Vegas back in February...yes, 4 months ago, i know.  my in-laws had Red Rock Pizza waiting for me when i arrived.  i was hesitant to try it because it wasn't the Neapolitan style that i now love.  i took 1 bite of this pizza (veggie) and LOVED IT!!!  this is not your average pizza!  it's GOURMET.  the crust was awesome, not too thick, not doughy, not smothered in cheese that stretches out 2 feet when you take a bite, just the right amount of garlic and veggies.  i even had leftovers for breakfast the next morning.

well here we are back in Vegas and the first night we arrived we went straight to Red Rock Pizza.  this pizza does not disappoint!  the little ""garlic knots"" it came with are TO DIE FOR!!  this pizza is now the only ""non-neoploitan"" pizza i will eat in the US.

i gave this establishment 5 stars because of the flavor and freshness of the ingredients and because of the awesome crust.

However, customer service is just as important to me as the food served.  My star review averages subpar customer service with the good quality of pizza.
Terrible experience!!!
I use to love this place.  Actually it was the only pizza place I ate at, however after what I experienced today I will never go back.  I got pizza, and a salad delivered.  The salad was wilted, and brown rotten.  When I called to notify them, a girl on the phone (who later claimed to be the owner) tried to refuse that the brown salad was rotten, and stated it was just a little oxidized.  I wish I had time to take a picture of the brown, soggy lettuce, however I was too busy chancing down the delivery man so that he may exchange it.  30 min later he came back with a new salad drenched in dressing (my order stated dressing on the side). When I called back the same girl gave me a fake apology, and hung up on me.  I also want to say I am pregnant ( which I told her), and eating any kind of rotten food can be harmful to my baby. I drove to the place asking for my money back, and again the girl gave me attitude. First she said there was no manager, but then she told me she was the owner.  At that point I lost all trust, and didn't want to eat the salad she probably spit in.  She had absolutely no customer service skills.  On the other hand, the gentleman that refunded me for the salad was extremely gracious.  Now, about the pizza.  The pizza was ok but more greasy than usual, which I didn't like.  Also it always takes this place an hour to deliver to my house, even though I live 5 minutes from their location.  I never cared about the wait before, but the food just isn't the same anymore. Now I have to find a new pizza place, it's a shame. :(",lQTee4RvSpMCGvfpKB7REA,2,0,3,W7PpMaHVxwyGRIrsSwH1nA
1234305,2013-07-26,0,SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg,"I just had an awful experience. 
So, we just moved into the neighborhood Red Rock Pizza is located, from The Vistas. Like today, still have movers moving things, been schlepping boxes all day, today. It was 7 pm, and I needed to feed my 6 year old. We are vegans, and usually we can have a veggie calzone without cheese no problem. But still I asked ""do you cook your marinara with chicken stock?"" ""No, no animal products in the marinara whatsoever."" 
So long story short, the $26 veggie calzone arrived, and since I don't have utensils, I ripped it in half, poured the sauce into both halves, then set them aside to let them cool. 
I then served my daughter a piece, and she started eating. I finished what I was doing then sat down to eat with her. The little bits I thought were garlic in the sauce were actually Parmesan. Crap. 
So I called Red Rock Pizza and they were immediately defensive. I just wanted my money back. I couldn't wait another 45 minutes for them to make another and send it to my house! They treated me like I was lying about putting the sauce on both halves. They told me they didn't tell me to put the sauce on it (even though I asked and was told of course they don't use animal products.) my husband called them and was told a new one would be made and sent. They sent a half-sized calzone to replace the large I ordered and paid for. 
So, the mistake with the cheese would have earned them 4 stars if they rectified the situation. They handled it so poorly that I'd give them a 2, but since they then sent a half sized calzone instead of trying to make it right as they argued they wanted to, they get a 1. They would get a zero if I could. 
Very disappointed and I would not recommend eating there unless you are willing to shut up and eat what they tell you to eat. I certainly wouldn't have ordered from them if they were honest in the first place. Sad, but I've never experienced customer service quite like it. I hope Paul is the owner and not just a manager.

They just have an internal problem with their employees not collecting the coupons when they deliver. Why should I (long time customer) be punished for the incompetent behavior of the employees they choose to hire. If they put a coupon out, they should write dine in or pick up only on it, if they want to enforce this. I feel that customer service is so important, if you want repeat business and referrals...

Found the crust to seem oddly premade given the uniformity of the thickness and turned-over crust. Did not have bad taste though.

First impression of the place; it looks like a mom and pop shop with the way the kitchen is set up. The making of the pizza is kind of secluded so it was a little different in that sense. Other than that it was a nice atmosphere. 

We then saw the special, which by any standard is pretty good. 2 slices with a topping and a 20oz. soda for $6.95. We were excited that it was very affordable. 

Customer service was below par by our standards so we weren't impressed with that. The wait was not long before we got our pizza and soda. When we got back to work to eat it we found that it wasn't the most amazing pizza ever but it is decent. 

This place will be on the list for whenever we are craving something quick, affordable, and have a craving for some pizza.",RwcJUbL4UfULTflpoTJKSQ,0,0,3,OnrhEjXVuq6r8TrJVRfTxw

I live in Summerlin, and this is by far the best pizza delivery option. My go to favorites are the Widowmaker and the BBQ chicken but I often split a onion/garlic/sausage/pepperoni with a friend at work for lunch. 

Full Review

So this place is obviously not Pizza Rock quality, but I don't think anyone could expect that from a residential delivery place. If you are a pizza snob this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a step up over Pizahut/Dominos kind of place than this is great. 

Some notes on the Pizza
Price wise this place is about 75-100% more expensive than your average delivery chain for just about everything- pizza, drinks, wings etc. 

A few reviews have raved about the ""fresh ingrediants""- this is not exactly true. Their sauce comes out of a jar, I have never seen anyone slicing vegetables etc- they seem to use your run of the mill restaurant supply ingrediants. I wouldn't really expect anything different for the price but if you are a fresh food fenatic you may be dissapointed.


Delivery times- I live 2 miles from the place, I work about 500 feet from it. Delivery takes about 45 minutes to an hour whereas pickup takes 20 minutes so I would highly suggest picking it up to avoid getting the pizza past its prime. 

Wings- I love chicken wings and these are perfectly passable delivery wings given that we have no dedicated wing joint in summerlin. They are baked not fried which does negate the crispness a little but not too much.

Garlic knots- yes these are pretty good. You get 1-2 with your pizza depending on the size, would recommend getting a side order to avoid fights to the death in a situation of GK scarcity.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,11,3,4,29yfor1Gd8s58pOvUeCyuw

It arrived to my house in the time frame I was given & the delivery person was very pleasant (as was the guy who took my order). The ranch dressing was not my favorite- too running, not much flavor.

Again, good texture & I liked that the garlic wasn't overpowering. Definitely worth a try & I will not hesitate ordering from Red Rock Pizza again.

The cheese was melted to perfection and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. I asked the man who owns the shop his secret and he simply replied, ""fresh and homemade ingrediates."" To this day, I refuse to eat pizza from anywhere else. They recently added pasta and paninis which are equally delectable. This is a must try place. But I warn you, one bite and you'll be hooked.

I asked the guy at the counter if the 2 Slice Special is more or less Pizza than a Personal 10"" Pizza....he said the 2 Slice Special has more Pizza, so I went with it.  The special price is for Cheese only, to add more toppings it's $.50 ea, so I decided to add Pepperoni & Sausage to both slices.....total damage $6.95.

I then grabbed a Soda out of the beverage cooler, they have Coke Zero, score!  I'm not much of a Soda drinker, but there are 4 Sodas I have a tough time saying no to.....Mexican Coke or Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and Coke Zero.  I swear they put liquid Crack in Coke Zero!

After a short wait, my Pizza was ready.  The Crust is slightly thicker than a NY Style Pizza and you must fold the Pizza if you want to eat it properly, otherwise you'll have to use a knife and a fork....which is a Sin!  I took one bite and thought the Pizza was really good.  The Pepperoni was great, quality stuff.  The Sausage was pretty good, but not great......was missing ""something"".  The Pizza had the perfect proportion of ingredients.....the Cheese or Sauce didn't overwhelm the Pizza.....which is a common mistake at some Pizza joints.

My favorite pizza is the Pueblo with sweet roasted garlic, sauted mushrooms, chevre goat cheese, mozzarella, sweet red onions, and roasted peppers. Delicious! My fiance's favorite pizza is the Widow Maker, it's like a heart attack on a plate! Ham, Salami, Italian sausage, Arezzio pepperoni, Italian sausage, black olives, and Mozzarella, hold the olives please. 

The salads here are also delicious. They make thier own dressings in house and they are yummy! The garden salad is not your typical pizza place iceburg salad with a few carrots and tomotoes on top; it is lots of fresh romaine lettuce with red onions, cucumbers, black olives and tomato. The portions are generous and two people can easily share a small salad.

They offer a few dessert selections, cheesecake (haven't tried it), cannolis (pretty good) and a loaded chocolate chip cookie that is irresistable! 

Red Rock is on the pricey side for pizza, but in this case you get what you pay for. The restraunt is very casual and set up more for take out than dining in. There are some small tables and chairs, and a few outside, but it is not inviting. So we usually call our order in for takeout.

I've had good pizza from other local pizza places and even BJ's (way too expensive), but I gotta say this pizza was everything they advertise. From my first bite, I could tell the dough, the sauce, the cheese all are fresh!  My pizza was only $9.19 and after trying it, I would've paid at least $2-3.00 more. (I hope they don't raise the prices). Even after a 15 min drive back home, the pizza was still warm enough for me to enjoy and really taste the flavor of the jalapeños and the gooey mozzarella. Yes, the mozzarella has just the right amount of flavor you can taste.

Yeah, I may love their pizza, but the rude, uninviting attitude of one of the staff is getting to be too much for me. Like I said, I love their food, and most of the staff is awesome, but they really need to retrain or reassign this guy. His attitude is always short, rude and genuinely unpleasant to deal with. I'm not sure what his problem is, but he ALWAYS has it....and it's just about to start keeping us away. 


My new go-to pizza delivery place! Yeah, they are a little on the expensive side, but it's completely worth the extra few bucks. So far, we've loved everything we've ordered. Well, I don't really care for their garlic knots, but that's not something I would normally order anyway. Regardless, everything is obviously freshly-prepared with quality ingredients, and very quickly delivered. That's pretty much everything I'm looking for in delivery pizza.

I was actually a little bummed when my old favorite pizza place started falling the hell apart (wrong orders, long deliveries, nonexistent refunds for shitty food, etc...), but after getting reacquainted with the fine folks at Red Rock, I'm realizing that it was probably more the prices and proximity that I had formed an ""allegiance"" to before...not the actual food. Messed-up, right? Well, that's all over now. I'm happy to pay the higher price for the better, more consistent food at Red Rock now. 
Thanks to ********'s NY Pizzeria for chasing us away! 
I really, honestly appreciate it now.

That's about it, folks. But before I go, I would like to point-out that, unless something has changed in the last couple of days, the ""place order"" link on this Yelp page doesn't do anything. It looks official, and like it's doing something, but it isn't. My wife spoke to someone at Red Rock and he said that he didn't have a clue how or why that option is listed here.

My response?  ""Oh, crap.""

Fortunately for me, I didn't have the customer service nightmare that other reviewers had.  So that leads me to believe that the issue must be either with: take-out, delivery, or someone that works here got the memo and decided to work on their customer service techniques.

If anything, the service was very friendly.  Quick, talkative, checked in often to see how we were doing... they even stopped us when we went to select our drinks as the colder drinks were in the back of their fridge.  Why? They wanted to point those out over the still warm ones they had recently placed in there.  Again, little gestures.

We got two personal pizzas: Cordon Bleu and Cajun Queen.  And those were some really tasty 'zas, especially sharing between ourselves.  Someone else on here pointed out this place's wings, and I am a HUGE wing enthusiast.  These are definitely some mighty fine wings.  I ate those like they were going out of style.

The pizza is about the same grade as chain stores like domino's or papa Johns. Crust tasted and had the texture of those premade things you get in Vons bland sauce and very little seasoning overall. You are also blocked from seeing the pizza being made which I find unusual

The pizza was not the big problem because even bad pizza is kind of okay. The problem is that the staff arguing loudly with each other in the open kitchen. I was the only one in there and one guy was going on and on about how he's not going to let the other employees walk all over him anymore.  This went on for about 10 minutes and then they went on to other subjects. 
Someone must have been working on the building because the power went out. At this point the staff decided since the power was out that I must be unable to hear them cursing and belching (yes belching) really loudly. At this point I finished and left. No more money for pizza that wasn't any better than frozen or for the completely unprofessional staff. How this place is getting 4 and 5 stars is beyond me.

5629682,2013-06-27,0,SQ8Tkavc4TJj-2kanEDzLg,"Red Rock Pizza is officially the only place I will order pizza. The price is a bit more than what you'd find at Pizza Hut or Dominos, but the portions are large (a small pizza and small side salad make a fine lunch for two for about $16) and the taste it quite worth it (unique, specialty offerings with fresh ingredients)!
 
So far, here's my take on a few of the items I've tried:
*The Pueblo (mushrooms, GOAT CHEESE, onions, and red peppers; sundried tomatoes for $1 more): Possibly my favorite. I love goat cheese, but not a lot of pizza parlors offer it. Love the unique ingredients. Also, you MUST get it with the sundried tomatoes! It makes the pizza.
*Tesoro (Artichoke hearts, tomatoes, olives, red peppers, broccoli, and feta cheese): Apparently this is their best-selling vegetarian pizza, and I can see why. The veggies are so fresh and seasoned to perfection. They also don't skimp on the toppings, and my pizza was literally overflowing with tasty artichoke hearts.
*Eggplant Rollatini (eggplant, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese): So good. It's basically like an Eggplant Parmesan pizza. I don't even need to go any further--- it's just so, so good,
*Cheesy Onion Roll: Greasy, but delicious. You might feel guilty eating it...
*Garlic Knots: Not bad, but a bit dry. Opt for the Cheesy Onion Roll if you're looking for a scrumptious, carb-mazing side!
*Garden Salad: We got this one with the house-made Blue Cheese dressing. Not a huge fan of the dressing, as it was very runny. I like a thick blue cheese dressing with blue cheese chunks, but this one resembled a watered-down ranch. Meh. Salad was simple.
*Red Rock Salad: Barely needs dressing, as the artichokes and red peppers bring a lot of seasoning and oils to the salad. Excellent!

Sure, it costs more than your run-of-the-mill pizza place, like Pizza Hut or Dominos, but what you get is good quality food and service. The only thing that would make this place better is if they had an option to order pizza online!",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,2,2,5,S4HjV1LjIXIWL6NKnf_3zQ

First off delivery was super fast I am still waiting on my maintenance call since 9 am ! at my apartments however called them up and got here in under 30 mins not bad !. 

The Philly -- the toppings are amazing ! the philly meat not shure what cut there using  for it has great flavor and not hard or tough to eat but verry good. ! My one negative on the Sicilian style pizza ( thin crust for non consumers . ) is a little tough to eat maybe recommend a dipping sauce like marinara to dip it in. either for to go or delivery might be a good idea. 

Chicken Wings these are baked off witch the trick is not getting or serving raw ones trust me from owning a pizza joint this tends to happen. However these where done perfectly and also they make there own blue cheese - ranch dressing you can tell the difference compared to some of the places I have been too. 

Living in Summerlin its a bit tricky on pizza I am happy to find a new one that delivers close to home its a toss up ( drum roll ) lol between Red Rock Pizza and Those Guys. 

Ohh and pizza was not salty nor buttery sometimes people wonder about this weather its the sauce etc.. Perfect seasoning through out the meal. 

Defiantly worth checking out if your in Summerlin -- They do have dinning room however tad bit small and I am shure like every where else in the valley during weekends it gets crazy.
