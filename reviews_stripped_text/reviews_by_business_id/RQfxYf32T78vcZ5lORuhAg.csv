And yes,  they will sit around and argue about whose job it was before they get moving.  
They are stingy with the protein and very generous with the rice. We ordered extra meat for an extra fee and still ending up with a white rice burrito with about two tablespoons of meat... Seriously. And that's after waiting an additional 30 min for them to make the food because they were bickering about whose job it was to do so.
I hadn't realized how ridiculous they were being with the portions of protein that they were serving until I tried a burrito bowl at a different location. At the Nellis location,  I ordered a burrito bowl with no rice and extra meat. It barely created a mound big enough to rise above the sides of the plate. I ordered a burrito bowl at the location near town square mall and I couldn't finish it in one sitting.

We also got complementary drinks, chipsl and guacamole.

My chicken burrito with extra chicken was so full and yummy. I got picco, cheese, black beans, and brown rice. This is one of the few Chipotle restaurants that actually give you the extra chicken you pay for. 

I tried one of the chicken tacos and they were also delicious. Had plenty of chicken and the lettuce was so fresh. The pico de gallo sauce was also a nice touch. 

I didn't try the steak tacos but my friend said the meat was flavorful, tender, and juicy.

The guacamole was fresh and good and they gave us plenty to go along with the fresh lightly salted chips. 

The place is huge, lots of seating, and very clean. Only drawback was I think the cashier had an attitude. She seemed annoyed while I was making sure our order was correct. The total came to $54.25 which was alot but it was free.

My sister just came up to tell me. And just stared at me and didn't say anything so I walked away. When I came to sit down she was like see there right there and there wasn't any ! And she just stared me down and walked away. Later she came out with two new bottles. And the chips were stale and WAY TOO SALTY!!!",0H4uBVkYFc12GfchSTGaow,0,0,2,8dnCOCVyLq5pVNV0kh7lYg

The only thing I don't like is the area or that shopping center. Normally I'm in and out, but the area inside is big enough to have multiple people eating in.",Lqa-U3bSO1wtYXnHLLjXCg,1,1,5,7669rAzrLsbAgE9vy5kHZg
