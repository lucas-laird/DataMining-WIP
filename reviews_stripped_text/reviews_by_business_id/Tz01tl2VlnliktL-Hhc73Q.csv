We came on a thursday, and it was hopping. The price was right, and the hookah smoke came out thick and smooth.

First time here was a spontaneous decision. Came out of Q Karaoke around 6a but was not ready for the night to end yet. Saw a sign that said ""food"" and we were reeled in. 

First impression: dim, bunch of lights, pretty crowded, loud music. Got seated in a booth. Ordered drinks and Ethiopian food that came with injera. Server told us their mom makes the food. Group liked it and even one stated it was better than Merkato's. Overall, told myself I'd come back.

Second time: sat ourselves at a booth then ordered a hookah with strawberrry pineapple, two longs islands, and two beers. Let me just say, I might want to smoke hookah more often. It was smooth, tasted good, and lasted forever. Music gave a good vibe that night. Bunch of Reggae and Nigerian music. Dance floor was pretty packed. Good vibes were just being emitted. Cost us $34 for our hookah and drinks. Not bad at all.

Service here is amazing. They consistently make sure you're doing fine and they consistently check your hookah and replace the coal. They know how to have fun too.

They ""close"" at 530a but will continue until people leave or the place starts to get bare. 

Definitely recommend stopping by. Don't be intimated. I admit, it's not the nicest place and there's security around. Last time we were there, there was a guy outside with blood on his face held to the ground. Yikes.

Tip: Be careful when you leave. Saw police pull up in the parking lot and was told that police come by, park, and end up following some people to pull over. Just be safe!",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,3,2,4,nzB4ERpJg385Q584IehzXg

We finally find a place to sit, it's takes another 10 minutes for the server to bring us menus, and another 15 minutes goes by and finally the ""server"" takes our drink and hookah order. We wait another 10-15 minutes to get our hookah, which had a wet hose and only two small pieces of charcoals to start the hookah. The music is so loud and outdated.

For whatever reason they don't post regular hours, calling the lounge is pretty useless as well.

In addition, it seems that if you are a lady and you come in during happy hour you get a free glass of moscato! yay!

We ordered the Myxx mix which was great - very minty mix that lasted for a good 45min-1 hour. The lounge itself is pretty big, complete with a full bar and has a nice dance/nightclub vibe to it.

I go back up to the bar and ask her to just put some baileys to make it better. She said I would have to pay extra for baileys. I told her I'm not paying extra so she needs to fix the drink with what she's got- after repeating myself a few times ""I'm not paying extra"", she reluctantly agrees to put baileys.

It would have been nice to write a review on the whole experience, unfortunately our first trip here was a disaster. Saturday night, 12:30am, the neighborhood a little sketchy, felt as if I was walking into a Hip Hop video, but it WAS  Hip Hop night so I guess. A friend was celebrating her birthday and invited me to come join at their table. I showed up 20minutes later in jeans and a backwards hat(wasn't allowed in with it)  I was under dressed and most people were  dressed as ifs hey we're  hitting the club. I was met by a rude bouncer and douche doorman, pretending as if they were elite club owners on the strip or something. 

Apparently out of no where, they started charging customers $140 for bottle service, my friend went in before me just to use the restroom and they let him in no problem, when I walked up 5 minutes later I was told they weren't  letting anyone in UNLESS you payed bottle service. I told them my friend had a table already and invited me, the doorman just kept repeating ""bottle service only"". I text my friend, who told the doorman that I was part of her party, he first had to confirm she had a table, he counted everyone at the table and told her she had a limit of 10 people, it was big enough to fit more people and the inside wasn't very packed. I had invited 7 other people who were on they're way to the lounge already, only to be told they wouldn't be able to get in. I left. Later my friend told me a fight broke out and they were all pepper sprayed out of the small building by security. I happened to be in the same parking lot coming out of the kareoke joint me and the others went to after we couldn't get in and witnessed a group of people fighting in the parking lot and a drunk car accident I wasn't surprised at all to see or hear about what happened. 

They definitely lost my business and my friends too. It's too bad, because they seemed to have good music and a neat set up. But poor choice in staff and business practices.",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,3,2,1,BPRwfepmqsXthQIqAFqV1g

I have been coming to this place for a very long time when it was just one room and a hole in the wall. Saba has been our waitress a few times and this is uncalled for. 

Please do not visit a place that discriminates against ethnicities based on what ever criteria they base their ideas. I have always blasted them on social media about how nice the brothers and sisters are and that family run the place. But this will not be the same. It's sad that they have entrusted everything in their security staff who were blatantly disrespectful and rude. The security threatened to beat me up and threatened to punch me in the mouth.

The security staff threatened to cause harm to anyone that does not follow their dictatorship. That's exactly how it's now ran.

I've never been so outraged at the service of any place before.

We ordered our first hookah and it took about 20 minutes to receive and it wasn't even so busy at all. But honestly, that's not the real reason I was outraged about. Our group wanted to change the flavor and we completely understood that there was a fee to refill and change the flavor. BUT it doesn't take AN hour to do so. We reminded the server three times about our flavor and they said soon. It was not until I went up there and talked to the lady about what was going on that she realized that our flavor hasn't been changed yet. THEN she gives me the attitude saying we would still have to pay for our flavor when we requested it for about an hour already. I mean they gave us a free drink for the inconvenience, but seriously though? An hour to make flavor? Or you even forgetting it? That's absurd. 

Never coming back here ever again. This place really needs to get their service on point or they'll definitely lose those good quality customers.",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,4,0,1,Hq6ek69Bv44Ky5se6rDSWQ

Ordered a peach, vanilla, mint hookah and couldn't taste any of the flavors at all. Left after the first hookah. Service was pretty slow and the waitress didn't know what was in the drinks. The inside is pretty cool, and they had a live dj which was cool.",OncJsxYFmx9G1tB2UxyCBA,0,0,2,8YSVnezJJJDnK88kRsREbw

I must say this is the cheapest lounge I ever been to in my life. Paid $12 for the house mix with ice and ice tip. That kind of price for a hookah is unheard of in the Bay Area , California.  If I lived here , I Would def be a regular. They played good music. They always came by to check on our hookah , and they packed a great bowl. I must say location is kind of wierd but  overall ..
