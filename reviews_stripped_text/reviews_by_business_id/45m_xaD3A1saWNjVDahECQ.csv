In a nutshell at Narita I get artfully and deliciously prepared sushi made with fresh, top quality fish, large portions at the lowest รก la carte price in town. One of the best kept secrets in town if you're a sushi lover!",CZTFg94ONs0oahzxGkcK3g,0,0,5,q30OWLMp_VQ1AqRJk1TMkw
338053,2009-10-22,2,45m_xaD3A1saWNjVDahECQ,"This was a family favorite for years. My first ever mochi ice cream was here and the first time my dad learned that putting the entire blob of wasabi in your mouth was not a good idea. 

I've always loved the quiet family feel of this place. The tables are cozy and the waitresses are extremely friendly. I feel like I am back at my best friend's Japanese home, eating rice and lettuce, and whatever other things, maybe less identifiable, that her grandma has thrust at me. 

The best deal here is the bento box. Stacks of California rolls, beef or chicken teriyaki (I'm partial to beef myself), and shrimp and veggie tempura. It is extremely reasonably priced and you'll have plenty left over for lunch the next day in the days when you're trying to stretch your meals out a bit. 

It isn't the place for a very serious date. It's quiet and in the Target shopping plaza, so you're not looking for fancy here. I think what I love the most about this place is its simplicity. Vegas is full of sushi places trying to top one another in overtly sexual names (including tastes like your ex-girlfriend...SERIOUSLY? NOT A NAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUSHI) , over stacked rolls with extremely complex ingredients and combinations. 

This will always be my first and last sushi stop when in Vegas. It feels like home.",BMEmpeosi4LfwRlAMgtjbg,4,1,4,3NsH7rN4dfwDlJtjJx40uw
661207,2012-05-04,1,45m_xaD3A1saWNjVDahECQ,"Sushi is my favorite thing on earth to eat (well...maybe it's neck and neck with chocolate).  They better have sushi in heaven or I'm not going.  I'm not much for raw fish, but there are a million kinds of sushi that are not raw (trust me you sushi neophytes).  So instead of sashimi I usually order rolls and Narita gives great rolls.  My favorite is the Japanese Lasagna roll (doesn't taste at all like lasagna).  Their's is the best I've found.  I like the service.  I think it's run by the owners.  The woman who usually waits on us is sweet.  It's a small place but clean and pleasant.  I just haven't had anything there that wasn't excellent!  P.S.  I've had the same experience that another reviewer had with the tea cup ""floating around the table"".  And it doesn't seem to matter which table we sit at.  Maybe the place is haunted!  Probably with the ghosts of ancient sushi chefs!!",-YgKh-vSmcTp2FtlEdI2xQ,0,0,5,h7xbrP2OL7qj6E5RhYv2TQ

However their prices are typical for Las Vegas sushi restaurants which I consider too high.  I moved here from San Diego and I'm used to tasty $6 lunches with a large variety of dishes to choose from (not a lunch special) and a large sashimi plate for $11 which runs around $18 here in Vegas.""",xYzw29-nx87mpVmGagvdLQ,0,0,3,YfFVUGFBueKSfK2aDWalQg

They do not have all you can eat but a couple of rolls will completely satisfy your hunger. They are not frugal with the ingredients. Most places overpower your seafood with large clumps of rice. Not at this sushi restaurant, the rolls and nigiri definitely has an awesome ratio of seafood to rice. Make sure you try the dragon, rainbow, yum yum and philly rolls. The soft shell crab is also a definite winner. Try this place and I am confident that you will not be disappointed. I would have to agree with all the reviews.

The edamame was a bit al dente, which I don't think it's supposed to be.  I wonder if there's a word in Japanese that means the same as al dente does in Italian.  I digress... each of the 3 sushi rolls were delish & huge!  The Summer was the one I described; Alaska was fresh with tasty tuna and avocado; and a third was also a crispy salmon.  We had no problem communicating with the waitress, which seems to be an issue in other posts.  The sushi list doesn't go into detail, so I just asked her what certain rolls were and she told me... no biggie!  Def a place to try again.",jNI9GYFHzInokLpoZ_OPBA,1,1,4,vNVO2I7q2S3U-43lHoGyGg

The tempura was pretty good and so was the Alaska roll and the salmon and yellow tail sushi and sushi mi, I also really enjoyed the yellow tail cheek.  The spider roll was dry and the soft shell crab was way over cooked and had a slightly burnt taste.

The toro was gross really chewy and tasted like red meat ew!   One of the boys (who doesn't like sushi) got the chicken katsu and it was dry with a yucky dipping sauce.

All up it was $88 before tip, way to expensive for what we got and then we had to go to Wendy's to feed the non sushi lover!",or9VwGPVMkBPS1ReXcg6kA,1,1,2,zkQ6RfqZsF8vvF_Q_CfYHw

The japanese lasagna roll they make is the best I've found here and in Southern California.  My husband likes their tempura udon soup and claims the maguro tuna is fresh.

2150563,2010-06-03,0,45m_xaD3A1saWNjVDahECQ,"The Skinny: generic, unauthentic sushi (1) with tired decor and service (1).

This little ""sushi"" bar is located across the street from Mountainview hospital. We'd read so many positive reviews of this place that we were eager to check it out.

My husband got there earlier than I did and got a table during lunchtime.  As soon as I arrived, he gave me an uncertain look like maybe we ought to vamoose this popsicle joint. Yes, it was that scary.

Really, it's not a sushi bar in the true Japanese sense of the word. It's a travesty to say that this place is a sushi bar. I mean, it tries to be cute with the little dirty flower taped pens on the table (yeah - yuck!). The decor definitely meets the hole in the wall criteria with it's dingy lighting, and a sad looking ""sushi bar"" area that was  (when we arrived) half occupied by empty paper boxes. I ordered a diet coke which came in a large plastic glass which the hostess refilled with another large plastic glass (classy!).

But hey, give us points for sticking this place out. We wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. We probably should have listened to our better instincts.

On to the food. The fish is not that fresh - the texture is mushy suggesting the salmon was frozen  or not stored properly . Sushi was poorly wrapped - overly loose, actually, making it difficult to eat. Tempura was hard and probably throwing it at someone could get you arrested for manslaughter. Miso soup was like the pre-packaged dehydrated stuff you can get at the supermarket.

Given the plethora of great Japanese restaurants in the city, give this one a pass.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,0,0,1,WuTJOoG96iv0d0LzHjFeGQ

the japanese lasagna is a must however may clog arteries.
it is just complete decadence.
it starts with a california roll on the bottom, topped with spicy scallops, cream cheese, mayo & then baked until golden brown on top and gooey in the middle.
and right before they serve it, they squeeze some eel sauce on top.

I ordered Jasmine tea and spilled just a little bit on the table. I guess the table must have been slanted because when I set my tea cup down, it began to move around as if it was possessed. It was kind of scary/amusing. :-)

We split three rolls: Spicy Spider, White Dragon, and one more that I can't remember the name of that had eel, avocado, and tuna. They were all very good. My favorite was the White Dragon. My wife's favorite was the Spicy Spider roll. The fish was fresh and seemed to be good quality. 

For desert we split a green tea ice cream which was your typical green tea ice cream.

Pros: The cuts of fish are the thick on all the rolls.  It usually takes about two bites to eat one piece.  My favorite rolls are the Johnny roll (see pic) and the Narita Airport.  I also recommend the Poke Salad (ahi tuna)  Service is friendly.  Everything I've had here has been very good.  

Cons:  Some of the tables are small and have a glass counter.  When you get get a drink, you need to keep an eye on your glass, cause they sometimes slide.  They don't take amex.",NktC3FNiPJRbx2Oly0Xtew,2,0,5,WRIhB0qGAGaaOZeCp0pjeA

I got the spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad with the crab on top.  

One thing I didn't like was the menu wasn't all that clear. The sushi lunch specials are only until 3 pm (kitchen ones are until 4), but you wouldn't know that from reading the menu.  The teas looked so delicious and I wanted to get one for my takeout order (in the picture on their menu, they are literally shown in glass bottles) but apparently you can't do that.  

The rolls are priced on average, about 1.50$ higher than at nearby haunts (see Yummy Sushi on W. Lake Mead, Sushi Ko at Craig and the 95) and there is nothing distinct about them that makes them worth it.  

Food itself was OK, generic but not bad, I don't think I'll be coming back (especially when Yummy Sushi is so close by!)",glMAnORnBrW5G_nQ-nv0Gw,0,0,3,akmpqM5BVAUYSpY-ZZiWuw

We ordered 4 rolls and the orgasm tuna. Let's say that not only did I not get an orgasm out of it, I had to suppress my gag reflex. The excessive mayonnaise completely ruined the tuna, and for $15.95 it was totally not worth the $.

How or why would you serve tuna that's been frozen, defrosted, frozen burnt, defrosted again?  The unagi was good but from my last visit around fall season of 2012 this place has gone downhill terribly.  I have to pass on the nigiri here, the quality is downgraded/passable.

I ordered what I thought would be guaranteed deliciousness in the Ocean Seaweed Salad and something safe in the Yellowtail Collar.  I waited for the Yellowtail to defrost but it was safe and good.  The Ocean Seaweed Salad was surrounded with salad greens and the brown dressing that I didn't mind for.  The seaweed was alright but the ""Ocean toppings"" of scallop, octopus, tuna was butt.
