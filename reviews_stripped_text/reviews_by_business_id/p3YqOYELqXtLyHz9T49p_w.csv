I loved the spice of the sauce, the fun of eating with my hands (gloves on of course), wearing a plastic bib....oh yeah and the food.  The crawfish was spot on and delish, the corn and potatoes were amazing drenched in the sauce...angels played harps in my head as I ate each bite.  The fried catfish was dirty tasting just the way a good fried catfish should be, and the Cajun fries were incredible.  

With all that said, the whole ""good for kids"" part of yelp that says yes should have a discriminating clause that says not for 20 month old toddlers in a booster seat.  3 spilled drinks, dirty hands in plastic gloves, and an untied down toddler made for an interesting experience to say the least.

Also I left a $15 cash tip, which I wanted to give to our waitress polina..  But she said she couldn't accept. However if I mentioned it on here the company may give her the tip direct...

They offer seafood sold at market price and by the pound:
Shrimp
Green mussels
blk mussels
clams
snow crab
king crab
craw fish 
and two other crab species that are seasonal. 

Bibs and gloves are given to protect the digits and your clothing from splatter when you are eating. 

We always try to go early. This place will always have some wait time so if you are in a large group plan ahead. We go to the one on Valley View and Spring mountain because it is the larger one on our side of town and the parking lot is a larger compared to the decatur location. Parking can be a hassle during peak business hours but there are lots behind the restaurant you can park at with a short walk. 

Cajun fries are delicious and always served fresh and crunchy!

Took forever to even place the order, but okay at least we're seated. The waitress comes over (Asian chic) asking what we wanna order, speaking so fast (like an auctioneer). Clearly she's in a hurry. we order our food and it comes out fairly quickly. Shrimp... then crab.... some fried catfish.... then a sudden halt. Where's the crawfish? Asked a waitress to check on it after waiting at least 15 minutes. She said ""they're working on it, it should be right out."" 10 minutes later, still nothing. Ask another server - ""it's on the ticket so it should be on the way."" ANOTHER 15 minutes and at this point we don't even want it anymore. I mean seriously, it took us less time to wait to order and eat everything, and still no crawfish. We ask if we can cancel the order since it's taken WAY too long. Great no problem... then the bill comes and they still charge for the crawfish! Ayuh! Wave one down again and they take it off - no apology... nothing.

As far as the taste - it's not all that. If ya'll are from So. Cal, don't waste your time here. Go to Boiling Crab in L.A.  Save your time and money for the craps table - at least you'll have a fighting chance. This was a lose/lose situation.

72561,2012-03-05,2,p3YqOYELqXtLyHz9T49p_w,"I think I may have shed a tear on the flight home! This place was unbelievably good. I had seen HNJ profiled on Man vs. Food. So when my friend and I were in Vegas last week, we just had to try it. I didn't realize that there were 2 locations. We asked the taxi driver to take us to the original location but he didn't.  I was a bit disappointed. As soon as we were seated, that disappointment disappeared.. The table is covered in a big piece of plastic, roll of paper towels, and menus. Makes for easy cleanup. Trust me on that...Catlin was our server and she was the sweetest, nicest person ever! I had never had Crawfish before, she explained the menu, the process, and how to eat them to us. They serve most of the seafood by the pound with the exception of the shrimp, you can get them in half pound. You pick the seasoning (Louisiana Style , Juicy Cajun , Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper , Hot N Juicy Special(which is a combo of all of the seasonings)), then you order a spice level (I am a total spice whore, the hotter the better). They offered mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. They serve it in a steaming bag that is opened on the table for you to enjoy. Catlin suggested that we go with the medium as it was hot and it builds as you eat. She said to try it and if we wanted it hotter we could order something else. We started out by ordering a pound of Crawfish cooked in the HNJ special seasoning with medium spice. OMG I cannot begin to tell you how good this was. The flavor makes my mouth water as I am typing this. The medium spice was perfect and was hotter than most mediums you have probably eaten. It was so good we ordered rolls to dip into the leftover sauce. And then the debauchery began.. Once we were about half way thru we decided to order the snow crab legs in the same flavor and spice level. Chunks of garlic on the crablegs....it was heaven.
Oh no, I am not finished...we then ordered 10 fried shrimp. These shrimp were butterflied, cooked in a catfish type batter. We also ordered the Cajun fries (which we couldn't even finish) but all of it was the best seafood I think I have ever had. Needless to say our table was strewn with shells, bags and lots of paper towels (yes us girls got our chow on, somethin fierce!) the whole bill came to under 60 dollars (including beers with dinner). If you are in Las Vegas GO, RUN!! to Hot and Juicy. You will not regret it! Had we had a little more time we would have went again before our flight on Friday. Next time were driving so we can take a cooler to bring back to Phoenix with us. Basically you can reheat the bags in boiling water and they will be just as good as if you were sitting at the table in Vegas.",ykxT1dzJzbhwnofYOUZ6Lw,3,3,5,XGZI2BoiwNzy4U35-Hp1YQ

Favorites are the Alaskan crab legs, shrimp, potatoes, sausage and corn. The sweet potato fries are also delicious.

Seasoning can be spicy so I normally get mild or less than mild.

The lemon butter sauce is in my opinion the best for the crab and the hot n juicy special sauce is better for the shrimp and crawfish. 

Keep in mind crawfish don't have a large amount of meat on them so these are best for an appetizer.

Just be sure you do not have paper cuts on your hands, you'll definitely get a sting, but it's so good that you ignore it and keep eating.  I read a handful of reviews and aside from the crawfish, many recommended the fried shrimp. Of course it was ordered and they were definitely right.  The cornmeal batter was not piled on the butterflied shrimp so that it's lost.  Another thing too is the batter stuck to the shrimp. It came out piping hot, enjoyed every bit of it.

Showtime.  I decided to go with 2 pounds of the crawfish, hot and juicy special sauce and I went with medium spice level.  I asked the server for spicy, but she highly recommended medium because it's rather spicy.  I was hesitant at first since, but fine, I went with it, what do I know. I chose or well, she did, correctly.  The hot and juicy special sauce was full of fresh garlic, delicious!  I ordered a side of rice, piled on the sauce into the rice bowl, highly recommended.  The crawfish was hit or miss.  I say this because some were larger than others, some where cooked right, some were so overcooked, the tail had zippy in it.  Regardless, it was still an experience and worth it.  Twist, suck, pull, chomp.

Service was good as busy as this place was.  Beers are cheap, can't complain.  Highly recommended to visit your local Hot N Juicy.  Expect your fingers to smell like sea when you leave, it's definitely worth it.

We arrived on a Thursday night and this place was packed! Apparently, there are two locations. I don't know if the service/food differs, but we decided to wait for a seat. Within 15 minutes, we were seated, which isn't too bad. We ordered three different flavors of crawfish - two pounds of cajun, one pound of hot n juicy, and one pound of the lemon and pepper. The first two flavors were not bad, the third we could've done without. The crawfish were juicy, fresh, and flavorful.. not bad, not bad! Each one pound order of crawfish comes with a side of corn on the cob, yum. If you order two pounds, you get corn on the cob and potatoes! 

Aside from crawfish, we also had an order of garlic butter clams. They were ok, could've done without as well. The weird garlic that was used had a strong kick to it which reminded me of straight up horse radish.

All in all, the food was not bad for someone who isn't a fan of crawfish. Top it off with some blue moon, and you'll be set! 

I do have to admit one thing, though... I felt like I was in a club when I was dining in there. They had some club trance music going on, which made me feel as if I had to peel the crawfish to the beat lol. It was interesting....",74MEs3l1jQTaBPpOgv8t7w,2,2,4,9m-eZxX-xgzPqXL0cVZP5Q

Fast forward to the food I ordered a 1 pound of snow crab legs and my friend ordered 1 pound of shrimp and we both shared the Cajun fries. 
The fries were great with a nice kick to it. We ordered or seafood with the hot n juicy sauce (all 3 flavors) it was awesome! Tried a few other places and this probably would be up there with the top 3, EXCEPT the service! It was awful. 
I honestly don't even know who our waiter was. I asked for something to crack open the legs, I didn't receive it until I had two legs left and no energy to attempt the remaining ones. We had to repeat ourselves several times to multiple waiters just to get something. It was very frustrating. If the service were better I would probably go back but I may try a different location.

littering the floors and coming out of the trash receptacles that

Ooh la la. We sat down and ordered. I had mudbugs(crawfish) because I'd never had them before. They came with new potatoes and corn on the cob. The place just wasn't working it's magic(maybe mojo took the day off) and asked that the food be bagged so we could get out of their as soon as possible. I think I hurt my dates feelings, because she took a cab home.
If I'd known how bad crawfish tasted I would have given her mine as well. So, on the way home I tried me a mudbug. It was awful. All they are are the brains(don't eat the green stuff)
and a smidgen of meat in the tail. Not enough nutrition in a dozen to keep a bird alive. So,
for almost $40 fazoles, I got a bagful off new taters and corn on the cobs.(And my dates
bagfuls as well). When I got home I put the bugs in Ralph's dish(my bloodhound), and he came to the same conclusion I did. The End

The waitress told us that they were out if fresh crawfish and only had them frozen and we got half price. The snow crab was meaty and was slightly on the saltier side.

Make sure to order sausage slices too because those are amazing in the bag with the seafood!

Don't wear anything too nice and don't plan on going anywhere where people will judge you on your guaranteed garlic scent! (Also, one of the waiters spill the bag of crawfish on my husband, so keep your distance when they bring the food to your table...)

I've been here so many times, I don't know why I haven't written a review. It may be because everyone knows this place and it's already popular...

But here is basically what you need to know:
-you, and everything else you bring into the restaurant (purse, clothes, shoes, etc), will REEK of garlic for several days following. But it's all worth it.
-you can/will get dirty. There's a reason why they cover the tables with plastic and paper. You deconstruct your food and throw the remains right on the table. They do provide bibs and plastic gloves upon request.
-seafood remains intact, heads and all. So if you're squeamish about seeing the head still attached to your shrimp friend, then you probably shouldn't eat here.
-there are 2 locations: both on Spring Mountain, one near Decatur and the other near Valley View.

And one more thing: I will go out on a limb and say it. I prefer Hot N Juicy Crawfish over Boiling Crab. The Hot N Juicy special vs Boiling Crab's version...I just like the flavors better.",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,5,2,4,pwa91A1nFXbFF_HVAlANTQ

Calamari
Raw oysters
Shrimp mild with hot and juicy sauce
Shrimp mild with garlic butter
Lobster with garlic butter
Crawfish medium hot and spicy
Fried Catfish
Sweet potatoe fries

Everything was incredible. Oysters were good but nothing special. Wish I didn't order rice as that's what put me over the top but couldn't help it I'm Chinese and the sauce over rice is oh so good!

Import beers for $3 - Domestic $2. Just Beer - no wine or alcohol.  Wish they had at least wine as not so filling as beer.

Saw Hot n Juicy on Man Vs. Food and wanted to try it. The crawfish are cooked perfectly and did in fact taste as though they were flown in from Louisiana every morning. I asked the server which part but he didn't know.  
    The spices I tried were the traditional Louisiana and the Hot n Juicy special, both with medium spice. They were both excellent. The traditional is very similar to the crawfish boils I use to have in the backyard with my family. I initially got two pounds but then got another two pounds after that. At 10 bucks a pound, be prepared to spend about $60.00 for two people. 
    We also tried the sausage and sweet potatoe fries, again both were great. The fries were made to order and the sausage was very flavorful. My only complaint is that the potato that the comes with the crawfish (if you order two pounds) is very plain. It tasted like they boiled it by itself and then just threw it in with the crawfish. But anyone from New Orleans knows that the potatoes must be boiled with the crawfish and have the potential to be the most flavorful piece of food in the boil. My wife was also disappointed with the corn on the cob that was included, she stated that it tasted like it was just a cheap frozen corn.

It was my first time eating crawfish whole, I love the tails, but it's so not worth the work or price. $9.99/lb and not even 1/4lb was edible. The snow crab wasn't meaty at all.

As far as the food goes, if you love messy finger food that comes equipped with a bib, you'll love Hot and Juicy. Their spice is not for the faint of heart! Even their mild spice has a good amount of kick. So far I've tried their shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, and fries. You have to peel the shrimp and crawfish yourself.  It's a bit of a hassle, but it's part of the experience.

Don't waste your time or money on the crawfish.  Big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in Hot N Juicy seasoning is the way to go.  
Keep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. Their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, I found it overwhelming. Their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of corny goodness.  They pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.

For those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.

CON: Do not go here hoping to do much afterwards. Your hair, nails, clothes, purse, life in general will leave with an intense garlic/shrimp aroma that will not leave until you shower and wash your clothes! :D",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,7,3,4,hujGzt75rb02DE8wGNBq6g

I'm a big fan of Boiling Crab in LA, but I wanted to try HNJ as well. I wasn't sure which was the original location, but I went to the Valley View location because it was on the way to my next destination. I don't think it matters too much. You get the same recipe and it's a matter of cooking or steaming the food correctly. 

We ordered 2 lbs of snow crabs, 1 lb of jumbo shrimp (both Hot N Juicy seasoning-medium), and 1 lb of clams (garlic butter-baby spice). A little pricey at a hair under $75, but well worth it. Sauce was robust in flavor and very spicy! The medium left my mouth burning and the baby spice even had a kick. My guess is that the HNJ seasoning is a mix of cajun and garlic.The shrimp and clams were very large and meaty. 

We did take out (and a good thing because I was sweating so much). The added bonus is that we had a pot of cooked rice on standby. With it being so spicy, I needed to cool off by eating some bland rice. However, there's so much extra sauce (it's MESSY) and I got to enjoy the flavors with my bowl of rice. It's a great compliment to the rice.",RTQ9HEPfrUrtwSDtzY1cKg,0,0,5,dp_EvRn2kehWYDpqmQ8TYw

I grew up in New Orleans, so crawfish is something I have grown up eating. Since moving away in 1998, I have been searching for some decent Cajun food, and an authentic crawfish boil is no exception. So on my most recent trip to Vegas, I knew I had to stop by Hot N Juicy Crawfish. The name alone warrants a visit to the place! Right when we landed, we headed to HNJC, we didn't even check into our hotel! The wait was a brief 20 minutes. I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish in the special sauce-- medium spicy (I think it was a level 8 of 10). I thought I could handle it. After all, I am Asian and from New Orleans- a lethal combo, duh! In 10 minutes, my crawfish arrived hot and steaming in my own personal bag. I burned my fingers trying to peel the first couple of crawfish, but I could not wait. The garlic juices were running down my fingers-- thank goodness for my bib. The size was smaller than what I am used to seeing, but the Cajun flavor I was craving was present and the spice was just perfect. ok, I couldn't take it. It was sooooo hot! But honey badger don't care. I kept burning my fingers, burning my mouth, and eventually, burning my stomach. Will I go again? Hell yeah.",dkyUiaBqza7Y0L4e34craA,3,3,5,MF4eOXowRJ4VJ_a7iVLI8A

I ordered a pound of shrimp with two small red potatoes. I had hot and juicy seasoning in spicy. My shrimp had eyes, ears, tails, and all that good stuff. As delicious as it was having to peel all the shrimp was time consuming and annoying. Sometimes you just wanna hurry and get to your food. The peeling slowed me down but I still enjoyed the flavor of the shrimp and potatoes.

2 Chicken Wings Basket

The food was just as good as the original location. This is the first time I tried the Catfish and Calamari and they were both very good. 

My only other complaint is that the chicken wings for the kids took a long time and were brought out a few minutes apart. They should have just brought out the orders together, cause one kid had to watch the other kid eat.

I remember going to the original location, up the street, closer to Decatur a few times before this location opened. Due to the years that one's been running, and the small ""enclosed"" location, i was happy when this one opened. I believe it was called a different name before this one opened but it was similar in style. After that one closed, Hot n Juicy took over !

My best friend and I were happy. More open location. Brighter. Newer ! ! AND LESS SMELLY ! 

Parking can be a pain sometimes due to it being in a plaza with other popular restaurants like DJK and Pho Kim Long but still worth it. AND its still technically down the street from my house xD just a little farther down spring mountain than the original location.... 

Most TVs are easily viewable from almost any seat in the restaurant for those who love to watch sports or just to watch something while eating. 

Prices for shrimp and crawfish is at $11.99/lb (As of 01/31/16). 

My usual is Hot n Juicy Special (medium or spicy or maybe extra spicy - depending on the day) + a corn (MMMM SOAKS UP ALL THAT FLAVOR) and shared cajun fries (ketchup does cut the spice sometimes XD)

TIP: If you are like me and my friends, who refuse to use those oversized gloves... clean your hands BEFORE going to the restroom with some wedges of lemon.

Also...I'm a ketchup snob, it is my own preference that the ketchup be Heinz and their's was definitely something generic. Everyone at the table who ate the crawfish and shrimp really enjoyed it, and their Cajun fries...I know that much. 

It was pretty loud in there, and the other location is the same way. I really don't like having to yell my order at the server but it is what it is.

Known for it's crawfish, I more enjoyed the spicy crab legs & shrimp. Order by the weight of the food in a plastic bag & use your hands to eat. They give you a plastic bib and rolls upon rolls of paper towels on your table. It's really messy (NOT DIRTY, there is a difference) but my opinion quite worth it. I was full when I arrived here with friends and I still ended up being the last one to finish eating. 

Would definitely go here again when I visit Las Vegas. This is the newer location, only slightly closer to the strip. I have not been to the older location, but probably will visit it when I'm there next. Highly recommend if you don't mind using your hands to eat.

I was skeptical about trying it because I've been so spoiled in California with all of our options with crawfish restaurants but I'm glad I decided to try it out! We had the sweet potato fries for the appetizer and it was good. We ordered the crawfish but they were out of the red (wasn't too fond of the crawfish they substituted it with) don't order it if they're out of red crawfish. The sauce was good but it could save the taste of the crawfish. We also had the shrimp in the house spice I believe. I loved it! The shrimp was huge, not soggy and flavorful! The lobster was great also! Huge lobster and a lot of sauce! The service was okay, but the food made up for everything!",NmC2z9DwnGdeHl9YSK7NXg,0,0,4,Bg-NvRPyKplAgExWFQkJpA

The second time it was a Tuesday afternoon during crawfish season (today). Why can't you control your inventory and keep live crawfish during the season? If I wanted frozen crawfish I could literally go anywhere. I mean Crawfish is in your restaurants name right? Ridiculous.,865Yujp6Hrt7wGZfOudI0w,0,0,3,7SyXAr8XI0fUdedyWLnsyg

I always get the calamari basket and it's always crispy and tasty, only this time the portion was tiny. (And it wasn't as crispy and it had very little flavor on top of that.) I asked about it and was told it's the same as always (it wasn't), but the guy was nice and gave me a discount. I didn't want a discount, I wanted the same portion size they used to serve. I like it with cocktail sauce and it used to be I used the whole cup of sauce and then some, but this time I barely used up half the cup. It seems to me the serving size now is appetizer sized whereas it was meal sized before, at the same price. 

When I paid, this same guy asked how it was. I'm not going to say ""great"" just to say that. Now he became feisty, even though I wasn't being rude or obnoxious. He told me the servings are prepackaged and it's the same as always, and he didn't want to hear that it was smaller. ""I'm just telling you how it is,"" he said. ""So I'm lying?"" ""No, I'm just telling you how it is."" Really, this is how to talk to a customer? You don't say ""I'm just telling you how it is."" I might have given them a second chance down the road, but not now. I'm never going back. I've ordered the same thing probably the last eight times I've been there going back the last two years, and I know what the portion used to be and what it is now. I can't remember the last time I was this angry leaving a restaurant.

This was probably the closest I would get, since they don't have it in Chicago. I was a little disappointed by the crawfish, because the shell was super thick and hard, and there was just something a little different about the sauce. I still ate like a beast, don't get me wrong. I mean how can you not be a little messy when you eat with your hands and there's sauce everywhere...but I think I really would have enjoyed it a lot more if the crawfish was like what they give you at Boiling Crab. Maybe they're from a different region? It really makes a difference if their shells are so hard, makes it difficult to peel. And the taste of the crawfish meat was even different! Almost like it was a ""lower grade"" of seafood meat.

Anyway, we also ordered clams, crab legs, and shrimp. I really enjoyed the crab legs and clams, and the shrimp was pretty good too. We got fries to share, which was a welcomed distraction for our tongues after too much spicy/garlic-y goodness.

I was craving some crawfish and finding good crawfish up here hasn't been easy lately.  So, I got in the new ride, picked up my companion, plugged in the iPod, and just hit the road. What a way to spend a Saturday.  

OMG!!  Ultimately, although I wanted to eat more, I refrained from pigging out.  I stopped eating after I ate three pounds of crawfish...and yes I'm consoling myself with the fact that three pounds included the shells...yes, that's it!  And...no I didn't eat the shells.  So I really only ate maybe a pound or so of actual crawfish meat.  Anyway, the first two pounds were in the medium Cajun boil served with a corn cobbette and a potato.  The boil was flavorful with a light heat and the crawfish were of good size.  When I was done, I ordered another pound of crawfish in the spicy hot and juicy boil.  Great flavor, particularly with the garlic touch.  And those mudworms were large!  They looked like mini- lobsters.  I actually ate the claw meat, something I generally don't do given their small size.  After all, there is a limit to just how much work I want to do for a meal. Now, I know to just order the spicy boil flavors since I generally like foods with a high heat.  Before I forget, the sweet potato fries were good too.  I liked that our food server kept the coke cups full and the staff checked in often. 

My companion ate the fried shrimp and the chicken wings with potato fries.  While he ate everything because he was hungry, he didn't particularly care for it.  I'm thinking that figures since the house specialty is the crawfish. But unfortunately, because these items are on the menu, they could use a bit more attention; hence, a four star rather than a five star rating.

The restaurant was clean and, importantly, so were the restrooms!  Now, if you're too prissy to eat with your hands and you have a problem with not using a plate, then this isn't the place for you, even though they give out nice bibs and you eat from a plastic table cover.  Keep in mind, you do eat from a plastic bag and you drink from styrofoam cups...okay so that's not environmentally friendly but who cares!?!  I even bought a tank shirt...and that's an unusual move for me.

I'm thinking I'll definitely be back...and next time, I'll try shop No. 1 to see if it's as good as shop No. 2.",5Nsv2yervWaoAt6oMgALJg,1,1,4,BuVaO2pY8gZSt_yODxKFvw

HJ is certainly much more juicier and spicier and though I did not give anything else but shrimps a try, I was disappointed.

For one, once I peel off the shell of the shrimps, there is remaining meat that is the size of a fingernail. I like to eat big so that was disappointing. It was a lot spicier for I was struggling with my life to diffuse the spices in my mouth.

On the other hand, the fries were as good as you get anywhere else. Like I always say, if you mess up on fries, something is wrong with you.

In conclusion, I prefer Boiling Crab. It's just preferential that I like my shrimps larger. But I give HJ 3 stars because they do a good job in explaining their styles and overall good service.

See through plastic bags of shrimp, mussels, crawfish, lobster, will be thrown on the table and your mission begins. It's an exported Louisiana style dining experience!

This is for garlic lovers only, and is not a low sodium meal!

This year the crawfish were smaller and out of season, so they were made from frozen and not as fresh. The shrimp were large and excellent as always, and served with the head on. Mmm, brains. For mussels order the green mussels over the black, they will be larger and more flavorful.

Cost: 5. For once, we can all beat Vegas.  Even with a sub-$10 cab fare from the strip, H 'n J is still very affordable for what you get.  A pound each of crawfish, shrimp, and kind crab with sides and drinks did not top $60 with tip.  Meal would cost at least 2x that at the casinos, I almost don't want to share the secret for fear they jack the prices.

Food Quality: 4. H 'n J serves its seafood in plastic bags they've mixed the seasonings in.  No plates, no rules -- it gets messy.  But it's so good, you don't care.  It was my first shelled crawfish experience -- quite tender, but a lot of work to open up their apparently smaller than average crawfishes.  Shrimp were good, king crab legs were AWESOME.  Lemon pepper and Hot 'n Juicy special seasoning were probably the two best choices to go with -- for heat lovers, go with at least medium spice for flavors.

Service: 5. Waitress great, she walked us through the crawfish de-shelling process on arrival, as well as several menu questions on what to order, how much of it, and seasoning flavors.

This time, my lil sister Jenni took me here Saturday night around 7pm for dinner - just the two of us this time. This is Hot N Juicy II, a little further east than I, and the place seems more updated and less crowded than I. 

It's such a fun environment. The waitresses are all super nice and laid back, there is Top 40 radio going on in the background, and everyone is eating with their hands! The wait a table for Jenni and I was about 20 minutes. 

I love crawfish but the shrimp was recommended to get more bang for your buck and also because they're delicious, of course! We each got a pound of shrimp in the Hot N Juicy Special sauce (which is a combination of all the sauces they offer). The food came out in about 10 minutes, hardly any wait. The mild was a tiny bit spicy for me (I'm a big spice pansy) but perfect for that extra kick. The shrimp that arrived were perfectly seasoned in that amazing sauce, and were each a good size. We also got an order of sweet potato fries that were super tasty, well seasoned, and a generous portion at that. This was definitely the right amount of food for the two of us. 

Our bill for 2 lbs of shrimp and an order of sweet potato fries came to be around $26 without tip. Not bad for a seafood dinner. 

Tip: Jenni, a seasoned HNJC customer, recommends that you keep your wardrobe in mind when coming here. You tend to leave with your clothes smelling a little like garlic, and the scent definitely sticks on your hands for at least a day. :)",Lo0GIJ5H9p3vwUTIcraNwA,1,0,5,XHR_YAY-zWpmz2Maxs4H7A

Went in on a Saturday night and the place was half full, but filling up fast. Got a great table with enough room so we could peel some crawfish and drink some beer. The place is clean and nice and has a family feel to it, namely because of the large tables for groups. 

Sat down and immediately ordered crawfish, oysters, mussels and dungeness crab. We also ordered some beer. Their selection is small and disappointing, but if you like domestics and Sapporo you should be okay. 

Very quickly out come bags of crawfish. They were tiny, but that was sort of okay because I knew that they were out of season. Still you're really paying for a lot of body and very little meat this time of year.

I ordered mine very spicy, you can choose how you want them seasoned. I wanted them to burn, which they did. The friend I was with got his mild and they were okay. I'm a huge fan of hot, so. We also got the mussels which were my very, very favorite. I could have just eaten them. They had this nice, garlic-y sauce and were tender and tasty! The oysters weren't tops shelf, I probably would never get them from here again, but put a little cocktail sauce on them and they're edible. Also ordered the dungeness crab. WASTE. DO NOT BUY. It was probably the worst waste of $30 I've ever spent and just thinking about it upsets me. You get a huge crab with big legs and you crack it open and the meat is mealy. You don't pull it out in big, chunky pieces, it actually can be gotten out with a spoon. If the company I had been with wasn't so awesome I would have pitched a FIT. Gross.

The service here is pretty sporadic. One minute they're fawning over you, next twenty minutes you're asking where the beer is you've asked for five times. 

I probably won't ever go back here, but it was nice to see what the (over) hype was about.

Edited to add: If you're expecting Louisiana crawfish you will be disappointed, this tastes nothing like it. It's their own made up something that is decent, but NOT cajun. Also, they give you gloves if you don't want  your hands to smell fishy for three days - that was a nice touch.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,1,0,3,qyICQD0nlHW349t4H6t7XA

Now, apparently according to some folks, if you see a price for crab or lobster on a board you assume it's per pound. Sure, maybe I've been living under a rock but if I see a price next to dungeness crab and there isn't ""/lb"" or ""per pound"" next to it, I'm going to think it's the price of the crab.  If you look at the menu it says ""market price"" but I've never read anything in economics advising that the unit of measure is always by pound. 

I've ordered seafood at many places, fish markets, casual and fine dining, from across the country and I have never been uncertain about what I was going to pay at the end. For example, at R & D in Newport Beach, they list fish as ""market price"" but the server will tell you exactly what the whole plate will cost.

Now, I can't say what would've happened if I had known it was per pound and asked the server how much it's going to weigh, but it's a nasty surprise to somebody who didn't know how ""these places"" work. Nobody should have to make this mistake just to find out. Would it be that difficult to add per pound to the board or menu?

I was introduced to this place by my aunt during our holiday trip to Vegas. It's always sooooooooooo much fun going with the fam.

I probably ate my weight in shrimp and crab. The side dishes were a mere afterthought. I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins!
2nd experience:
""Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you."" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute!
I was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J.
Last notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.

Finally, you choose spice level.  Let me first say that I eat ghost pepper spice all the time - i.e. I LOVE HEAT.  However, I would recommend no hotter than medium.

I would say the atmosphere is very similar to to all the crawfish joint's. Shoutout to the guy who spilled a little water on my iPhone and was nice enough to apologize and give me an extra 15% off my bill.

On this particular visit, we arrived 20 minutes before they opened and already there were people lining up at the door.  So we headed over to Starbucks to wake ourselves up and to kill some time before they opened at 11am. 

We headed back and we were immediately seated.  We quickly looked over the menu and decided on our orders.  I always get a 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, with the 'Hot & Juicy' sauce.  Their sauce is a lot spicier than the crawfish joints in San Diego (Crab Hut).  I, personally, prefer Hot & Juicy over Crab Hut.  The sauce just tastes better!  

I think next time I'll get the 'baby spice' level with my shrimp.  My lips were tingling after finishing my food, but I enjoyed every bite and it was worth it!  LOL

*** Tip:  Be sure to use the plastic bib they provide.  And if you don't want your hands smelling like your food, ask for gloves.  Also, if you wear contacts, I highly recommend wearing gloves and avoid removing/ touching your eyes after eating here.  You will feel a slight sting if you remove your contacts shortly after  (haha from personal experience).

Restaurant looked kinda small but man! It was getting pretty packed by the time we got our food! 
Server was really sweet. 
Didn't take us long to get our food either. We ordered the crawfish extra spicy ( $11.99 lb ) 
Snow crab ( market price lb ) 
Lobster ( market price per lb ) 
Fried shrimp w/ fries ( $11? ) 
Oysters ( I honestly forgot the price )
Everything was honestly so flavorful. The fried shrimp had the batter that Georgians would use for their fish, which was really different but honestly so crunchy and delicious. The fries, omg I loved their fries. Nothing special about it, I just love fries! The snow crabs were very wet, just the way we like it. We asked for a side of butter but I think the waitress got confused and added butter to our flavoring I believe. But we ended up not needing the butter anyways because I ended up dipping in the bag. 
The lobster, omg the lobster had so much meat. It was soooo good! Nothing compared to GA's seafood restaurants AT ALL. The oysters were very fresh and a pretty decent size. Pretty sure they were blue point oysters. Lastly, the crawfish. The flavor was there and all but for being live, it wasn't as big as a I hoped and it also kept breaking.

So here's my complaint. 
I get here late because the parking area sucks. It's not their fault but the area where they're located is pretty popular.
Next, as I walk into the restaurant the whole party is standing. Uhmmmm, why? Well because they don't take reservations. OH REALLY? So why did I call and make sure the reservation was set and you tell me it's all good?
ERIC, DO NOT tell me who I spoke to because you clearly spoke out of your ass. I'm frustrated because how are we supposed to plan an event like this and your WHOLE STAFF failed to communicate to us that your facility does not do reservations. Not only did you set back our plans for the night but you looked like an idiot when you told me who I spoke to with your sass.

Went here tonight for dinner and our food came out promptly. And everything was ok but the server literally was inches away from our table and never bothered to ask if everything was ok.

My boyfriends beer was empty halfway through the meal and he didn't ask if he wanted another one, I wanted a water refill and he never came. The worst part is we finally put our napkins and bibs on the table indicating we were done and he just looked at us and then walked away to bus a table behind us. We clearly wanted the check. He then refilled my water but I was done eating already. 

And I know he knew we were done but he never came with the check. We finally had to ask another server right in front of him for our tab. I guess because they know people will keep coming to this place so they don't care about service.

They provide several seafood choices and different sauce/flavor options.

The blue crab is hard to eat, especially when they don't provide anything to open the hard shell with (unless you want to risk breaking your tooth chomping down on the shells).

The clams are okay. The taste can be overwhelming with the clams being drenched in the sauce. It was a little disappointing that there were several empty shells in the bag provided (even after scrapping the floor of the bag to see if the meat had fallen off).

I love that sauce, so much that I will usually order fries to use to soak up the excess. Corn is also delish slathered in that sauce. I also always ask for lemon, salt, pepper- must be an Asian thing.

Crawdaddies don't really fill me up so I will usually order some shrimp as well. They don't really seem to absorb the sauce as well though...

Everything served here is finger food and very casual. I caved in and started wearing the plastic bibs offered- can't risk staining my clothes.

One of the sinks you have to keep pressing for water which is quite annoying because your hands are pretty messy afterwards so if they have two sinks that just stayed ON, it would be much better!

waiters were super helpful w recommendations and service. service was great and restaurant was clean. 

came on a tues afternoon for lunch. we were immediately seated and ordered drinks.

we got 2lb of hot and juicy spiced crawfish mild ( which was actually medium spicy. just as the waiter warned us), a 1.4 lb garlic butter med spicy lobster, and a pound of lemon pepper mild spiced shrimp  ( also rec by waiter... and im so glad we got it). fyi all came heads and shells on in plastic bags so it gets messy... but there is a roll of paper towels at your table. so worth the stains i made on my dress .., thats why they invented shout spray! we also got 3 pieces of corn and a potato and a bowl of rice. oh man crawfish+ rice = amazeballs!!

Way better than boiling crab in California--San Jose, Sacramento, Alhambra, Orange County--and just as yummy as the Seafood Shack in Anaheim. The prices are relatively same as in Cali: $9.99/lb of shrimp. $10.99/lb of crawfish. $8.99/half a dozen of oysters. $24.99/lb of king crab legs.

The sauce options were more than most places I've been to: Louisiana style, Cajun style, butter garlic, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy special.

Our server was Mathew. He was completely awesome: Super nice, friendly, funny, and attentive. The oysters were so sweet! My father, hubby, and I gulped them down as soon as they came out--Matt dropped by to make sure we'd already gotten our oysters and was surprised we'd already finished them all. It was that good. We ordered the soft shell basket (fried soft shell crab on cajun fries) and everyone love that. Although, for $10.95 we should've gotten more than 6 pieces, it was mostly fries. The crawfish was juicy and succulent. However, most of them were on the small side. The king crab legs were huge and meaty. Near the end of dinner, my dad wanted another order of Cajun fries. Unfortunately, Matt forgot to put in our order right away that we didn't get it 'til after we paid for our dinner. Matt was totally responsible and owned up to his mistake. We got our fries @ a discount: FREE. :)

There were 17 of us so we were surprised that they could accommodate a party that large. We had to split up into 2 different tables, which that wasn't a problem for us. We're not high maintenance like that :) we were able to still interact and even share food!

They took our order right away and the food came out shortly. I ordered a 1/2lb. of shrimp, Mild, with all of the sauces, corn on the cob, white rice and Cajun fries to share. PLENTY of food and I ate ALL of it. Their ""mild"" was more like medium/hot. It was really funny watching everyone sweating from their food. I had a couple of friends order Medium or hot and they were DYING. So be careful if you're sensitive to spice levels because it's NOT what you will expect. Luckily, I LOVE spicy foods so the mild being medium/hot was a blessing in disguise. I'm pretty sure I thought about seconds and even packing leftovers because it was just THAT good

I do, however have a HUGE complaint - their service.  We came around 4:30 before the rush hour dinner crowd arrived.  We were seated and our order was taken.  Fast forward 45 minutes and the place started to fill up and people who arrived 20-30 minutes after us placed their orders and were already eating and we still didn't even have our drinks!  We beckoned a server over (because we didn't know who our waiter/waitress was since 3 different people had come to our table) and asked why we haven't yet been tended to.  She looked into it and said that our orders had not been put into the computer so they were going to discount our tab to compensate and that a manager was going to come speak to us about it.  Soon after our meals were served, however, it was delivered to us piece-meal.  We had to remind her twice what items we were missing.  While we were dining, no one checked on us during our meal so we had to continue to flag her down to get refills on our drinks.  No manager had come, as promised, and when our bill came, it was not discounted and once again we had to remind her that no one came to discuss the bill with us and that it was not discounted either.

Thank GOD the food was amazing because if I were to base my review on service alone, this place would receive zero stars.

Sometimes, if the quality of the food is high and the uniqueness of the selections are compelling, the fact that you are sitting at a picnic table with a disposable tablecloth (and no plates BTW) doesn't factor into the equation.  In a town like Vegas where everything on the strip now costs an arm and a leg (or two), finding this alternative fine dining establishment just a $10 cab ride away was a pleasure.

Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a picnic table throw your food on the table type place that serves seafood by the pound.  Mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, and - of course - crawfish.  Just good quality ingredients, professionally steamed with your choice of toppings.  You can also add in some corn on the cob, potatoes and other sides just to fill out your plate.  My party tried a mix of the food with their spicy topping.  

They have four tiers of spice and we chose the second to the top.  Be forewarned that the spice - while fantastically good - will bite you.  I fancy myself a spice aficienado that can handle more than most.  At first bite, the spicy didn't seem that hot.  Over time (like in the next 10 minutes), i had sweat pouring off my brow.  I felt like Nixon at a presidential debate.  If I had to do it again, woulda chose the medium just so i wouldn't have to immediately head to the hotel and take a shower.

This past visit, we waited for about 5-10 minutes for a table - not bad at all. Upon observation, I can tell the clientele is completely different from other places I've been and that could be one of the main reasons why service isn't so great here, which is a bummer. 

I'm almost certain our server was new or he was just overwhelmed. We always stick to boiled foods when we come to these types of places, but we ended up opting for some Cajun Wings & Fries with our fresh crawfish. While ordering with him, he asked us how spicy we wanted the fries and we said Mild. 

Our crawfish came out and was delivered by another employee. When our server came around to ask how everything was, we asked about the wings and he said, ""Oh sure, how spicy would you like the fries?"" I knew he had forgotten to place the order, but when I told him we had already ordered it, he recovered and said ""Oh yeah, it should be right out.""

We saw a basket of wings and fries go to the table behind us and beside us - and both were seated and ordered after us. So that confirmed our order was forgotten. No big deal - we get that it happens, but own it. Our server definitely avoided our table until the order arrived. Wings arrived and they were nice and crispy, but T-I-N-Y. A complete joke of a basket for $10.99. 

Also, save yourself from drinking tap water that has a funky taste and smell to it and order a soda or beer. The bill explicitly states ""Tap Water"". LOL and dumping lemon wedges in it definitely doesn't mask the taste/smell either.

1 lb of crawfish - Smallest crawfish I've ever had but they still had good flavor.

2 corns - frozen corn because it was soggy to the bite.

Fried catfish with seasoned fries - regret getting this, the meat on the catfish was very soft so maybe that is the texture of catfish.  Definitely not my favorite.

All the food was just below great. The cajun fries were way to oily for my liking. The cajun calamari was good, but portion was small, the softshell crab was surprisingly good even thou I am not a fan of crab.

Overall I'd enjoyed the experience with cause of my great friends, great service,  good food, and a break from the strip.

We love this place so much that one time, we came here 6x over a 3 day trip. In fact, our first visit included us polishing off 10lbs of seafood. Some may call that disgusting. We viewed that as an accomplishment.

What to order:
Shrimp is always (as the name suggests) hot n juicy. You must order this!
Crawfish is a novelty which you'll definitely order the first time, but likely eventually realize that it's a lot of work for a wee bit of meat.
Lobster is excellent but the sauce doesn't penetrate.
Mussels are good if you like mussels. Green are juicier and plumper than black.
Snow crab is good but my recommendation would be to order it on its own so it doesn't get cold.
King crab is amazing and you'll need at least 1 lb between 2 people. 3 people? Get 2 lbs.

The best bang for your buck at places like this is shrimp. When you get crawfish, you're throwing half of your money away because you can only eat the tail. Not worth it. I got a pound of Hot N Juicy Special Shrimp, Medium Spicy with a side of corn. The shrimp here are a hefty size (I'd say size 16/20) and the sauce is outstanding. I tend to stay away from spicy food, but even Medium was just the right level. If you get mild, the spice is nonexistent. A good combination of flavors that matches the shrimp well. 

The employees are all very friendly and highly efficient. Our orders came out within 10 min and water was constantly refilled. Our waitress, Loreal (Never heard that name before, but that's what my friend said was on her name tag), did a fantastic job with our large group, and managed to throw in a few jokes here and there.

Great spot to take visitors, but be careful. During peak mealtimes the wait is horrendous. Take-out is a good option. It's still hot by the time you get it home anywhere in the valley.

Cajun Fries - Just to ad a little bit of fried goodness to the table.

Positives: the flavor was quite good. It had the perfect amount of heat, spice, garlic, and all other types of yumminess. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.

Negatives: I'll start in chronological order from when I got there. Seeing the 10.99/lb price tag was like a slap to the face! I'm used to paying a fraction of that price for larger, fresher, and equally tasty crawfish. This leads me to my second point: many of the crawfish were mushy, tiny, and some of the tails weren't attached to the heads. Disappointing...

Negatives continued...the service left something to be desired. While the server was very enthusiastic, she had difficulty understanding basic concepts. If you order 2 lbs of the crawfish, you automatically get a potato and corn included with your order. She charged my friend for an extra order of corn and potato to my friend's receipt and could not grasp why this was incorrect. Who knows how many other people have been upcharged for extra corn and potatoes. She didn't know how to remove this from the receipt so my friend ended up paying for something extra she didn't ask for because she didn't want to deal with the headache of explaining this again and again. :/

In summary, it seems like this is a popular place that many people frequent and even give great reviews and high accolades. It may be disappointing for people who have easy access to crawfish, have been to many'a crawfish boils, and know what good crawfish should taste like. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see what all the hype is about, but I'll get my crawfish-fix elsewhere.",-oLxaru36T_6zgD8Oxfgiw,0,0,3,_r8UfUIq_SeJuxg__foi1Q

We started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else! 

The snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!

You buy the crawfish by the pound, and it comes to your table all steamed and evenly garliced.  This is the part where i think non seafood people will never understand.  You rip the lil heads apart from the body and give their brains a good little sucking.  It's absoutely delicious :)

You get stuff delivered in plastic bags, on a plastic table cloth, or in styrofoam soup cups. There isn't any silverware to speak of that I could see and fountain drinks come the same way. The prices are so-so. I had their etouffe. There's only one, and it's mudbug etouffe over rice. It was reasonably flavored, but over-seasoned with cracked pepper even for a Gulf Coaster. There is lobster, three kinds of crab (two missing, the least inexpensive) and an assortment of sides, like corn, sweet potato fries, and so forth. My limited sampling said that it's over-rated. 

Two other clues. The parking lot is tiny and insufficient for a large patronage; parking up the side street if you dare. The waitresses don't really understand their menu, or their ingredients (two different ones). Although they were slammed with people, the waitresses seemed inexperienced and had a lot of stains on their clothes. Busing the tables amounts to lifting off the white plastic table cloths and dumping the trash, I guess. It's like eating on the top of a garbage bag. I expected something more authentic, some semblance of service, and a cut above a pre-trash table setting. You can probably do better elsewhere; this isn't even as good as Joe's Crab Shack. There is no decor save for a few Mardi Gras-ish things they must have found at a party store, has all of the ambience of a WalMart restroom.",veRNLv6_8QSJXFnKwQaexw,1,0,2,-_AgOcI85wPO_IsbCrjfnw

For starters, they weren't even that busy and the fact that it too almost 10 mins just to get our drinks was already the first red flag!

All of the orders came out at different times and about 10 mins apart with the catfish taking the longest. They brought the fries out first then one by one our food? Wtf?

I haven't been to this location in a very long time. My last couple of experiences were horrible in service as the servers preferred to be goofing around with their coworkers rather than making sure their guests actually had drinks while eating fiery finger licking goodness. The last time i had good service here was probably when Cam was supervising there but i believe she left to open the California locations.
.
I don't like to write bad reviews because... well... maybe there was a situation, but luckily i didn't have the need to write a bad one since finally w/ this visit it was a breath of FRESH air. I believe our server's name was Brandon or Randy.... pretty sure its Randy.... its just so loud in there since they are busy. This guy was our FRESH air... NEW... EAGER... HUSTLING!! We like our servers to be hustlers because they make money & we get what we need in a timely manner without having to ask. He was fast & one key MAJOR IMPORTANT thing for this style of restaurant.... DRINKS.... He kept my husband's BEER$$ FULL at ALL times especially since husband wasn't eating since he is on this no dairy thing but nice enough to keep me company. My soda was also full at all times.  
.
I asked.... since i am in the service industry too... how do you know when my drink is low? his response... ""you got the spiciest level sauce... your drink is always gonna be low"" HAHAHAHA such a simplistic answer. Good job on finding this GUY Hot n Juicy
.
We always order the Hot N Juicy Spicy: 
SHRIMP which is always cooked to perfection where we can easily peel off the shell 
DUNGENESS CRAB which i LOVE because me being korean.... i LOVE to eat the brain part with rice & some of that HOT N JUICY sauce 
CORN FRITTERS are perfect when you need a little sweet creaminess to cool down your mouth.
SNOW CRAB has a saltier meat which i love SALTY anything no matter how much everyone tells me its bad for you. 
sweet potato & cajun fries just to get me full & extra Hot N Juicy Spicy Sauce because i love to take it home to eat with rice for a week. 
When i say WE... i mean JUST ME.... eating.... =/ dont judge.

Overall I'm super glad i can come back to this location instead of having to drive all the way to the EASTERN location which the staff there are AWSOME as well.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,8,7,5,eOTI0CZO4-3AN-EfBuh5YA

I swirled my car in to the first space about a quarter mile up and heaved a sigh of relief.
We hiked down and it did not take more than 15 minutes to be escorted to our table.
I love the look of the ceiling and light fixtures and really appreciated seating that does not put my elbows on the next couple's table. Already big stars for this great space.
No kidding- I had to look at the ceiling because the tables were hotbeds of orange spice colored plastic gloves, worn by immaculately dressed women and men fishing into huge bags of colorful crawfish and shrimp. It was like a movie about starvation but you had to wear gloves. Little kids and parents were chowing down on the table's contents, happy as clams, no pun intended.
My husband had whispered ""Crawfish"" all the way here. I suggested he get the 2 pound bag of crawfish because there would be spiced corn and a potato in the bag to fill him up.
Meanwhile I ordered the catfish basket with sweet potato fries and a Sapporo. Hot, delicious and non-messy.... 
Back to his side of our table-- the man with the hot spicy crawfish pulled tiny bits of fish from the shells and exclaimed that now he needed a meal to fill him up! We laughed! Seriously? This former auto body repairman who had his bleeding hands tied up with duct tape and bandages to finish a job says ""This was too much work.""
We both want to come back for Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp.
Great experience- good food and attentive, helpful staff.
Next time if you come- take a shuttle or bus or even walk- the parking lot is scary as hell after 5.
Ps he walked not far away and honestly- he ate a crepe filled with strawberries and covered with whipped cream and chocolate. (My catfish basket did not require any embellishment or crepes.)

 Honestly, the best thing ever.  I always ask for less than mild because their spice rating is a little above average and my taste buds can't handle it! I like to also eat my shrimp with a side of white rice. Delicious!

All seafood orders are served in a plastic bag.  You are given a bib to eat so it doesnt go on your cloths.   It WILL get a little messy, so make sure youre not wearing white... unless you're extra careful. Also be prepared to smell like garlic for a few days! So worth it though! -- I also love their chicken wings w/ sweet potato fries.

Fun atmosphere, great staff.  Theyre always attentive.  Only complaint i have is that when I ask for less than mild for my spice level, its always a hit or miss. Sometimes its spicer than other days.... so its never consistent. I've had to send my shrimp back on a few occasions.

Our waitress was a sweetheart, and even demonstrated to us how to peel a crawfish (it was my first time having them, and they are a lot of work!)

We came to this Hot N Juicy Crawfish based on a Yelp search in China Town.  They have a lot of high rated reviews by locals and it was something different from where we usually when in Vegas.   

Restaurant~ This place is busy with loads of people wearing plastic bibs and gloves eating bags of garlic immersed cooked crustaceans.  It's very open with plenty of seating for small or large groups of peeps.  One of the first things you notice when you walk in is the BLAST of garlic odor.  I normally love the smell of garlic, but this was too intense for me.  

Service~ like a lot of places anymore! some of the people that work here are really friendly and seem very helpful and then there are a few that were not helpful at all and seem to treat us like number takers...  Maybe it's because they are so busy, but that's just an excuse.  I could care less man vs food dined here, which is what two of the servers told us and it's on their menu.  I'm looking for quality of taste and not quantity of food to conquer.

I also tried the crab and it was not fresh and it was a 1.8 lb crab and there was very little meat the little meat I could get from the claws was so over steamed it was mush: the fries, potatoes and corn were ok.

I have tried the garlic butter and the lemon pepper seasonings. Garlic butter is BOMB!!! Lemon pepper is delish just a little more on the salty side that is even too much for a salt lover like myself.

Also for hotness level mild is freakin hot. I dont like spicey foods so I thought mild would be ok.. NO.. no its not.. its like fire. So anything more is a risk you've got to be willing to take.

For this time I ordered the shrimp since I heard the crawfish was a bit of work and yes I'm lazy.  I ordered a pound of it with the Hot N'Juicy sauce, one piece of corn, and some sweet potato fries.  I'm definitely not one for getting my hands messy, but I managed to get over it enough because the shrimp was delicious.  Sucking up all that sauce was the highlight, especially on the corn.  It's definitely a once in a while thing for me eating like that but I'll be remiss if I don't at least try the crawfish once in the future.",xrK1fNVQMFgAxNHhvyQhgg,0,0,4,m3YJ5kuGGAltTYhBraQiNQ

Went with a buddy who I havent seen since high school , his fiance and kid. Greeted warmly by the hostess and seated promptly .... This place gets packed fast so do what we did and arrive at 6pm or earlier. We went on saturday 07/02/11 a holiday weekend. All the waitresses were as the restaurant name says ""Hot n Juicy"" looking!! Not too shabby !! 

we ordered ....

1 Catfish Tray 
2 pounds crawfish
1 chicken tray
1 clams 
2 orders of rice
1 etouffe
1 pound garlic butter shrimp

The Catfish was awesome ..... Lightly Breaded on top of a bed of fries.... Didnt have the fries coz I'm trying to watch my Girly Figure.... =P  I had the crawfish Louisiana style w mild spices..... Simply delicious!  Albert ( my buddy from high school ) had the etouffe and a crawfish medium spice in garlic butter.  I'm a Crawfish rookie ....loved the flavor ....didnt like the tiny reward for breaking open those lil bastards! Took a bite of the garlic butter shrimp and know what I'm ordering the Next time I come here!!

Just like a previous reviewer said  ""You know this place is bangin' when you're nose is drippin and you don't even know it."" I was told by Lorena ( my buddies fiance) that I was sweating on my head..... I seriously didnt realize it!! The food is THAT GOOD!!

Definitely coming back for another round!! Great Place!!

OH!! I forgot to mention that our waitress brought us a bill from another table for only 20.00 ........ rather than a bill for 80.00 which it should be.... This was one of those What Would you Do kind of moments.... Just pay 20.00 ? or bring it to our waitresses attention..... We decided to bring it to our waitresses attention and she was so appreciative of that !! I would'nt feel right paying 20.00 for what we ate AND I would feel guilty knowing that the waitress would have to take a cut from her check for her error..... DO WHATS RIGHT PEOPLE!!  Do whats right!! nuff said.....",fskXbiwaHEpcv2_8fFRfhw,4,6,5,JO-JR6-oX8k98Fxdg7SCeQ

After many visits to las vegas, I finally was able to make the time to make a stop by Hot N' Juicy before heading home. Most people prefer Pho to cure their hangovers of course but I made it a point to try this before going back home this trip.

I was never a huge fan of Crawfish but I am definitely a fan now! I've tried Crawfish at Boiling Crab and it never stuck to me the way Hot & Juicys did. I usually order Shrimp but after trying Hot & Juicys Crawfish, I've gotten a whole new perspective of cajun food. Their Crawfish was flavorful, soft and melts in your mouth type of seafood. Definitely worth the extra hardwork to peel for those little things!

I did try their shrimp and I did not enjoy it very much. It seemed bland and the flavor was lacking. The shrimp just didn't seem as fresh as boiling crabs. I will just have to eat Crawfish at Hot N' Juicy from here on out but definitely worth it.

The service was good, they had a friendly staff and they were aware of their customers which I liked. 4/5 because it was great but the only downside was the Shrimp. Will be back for the Crawfish though!",iRW3QQk1zj8gHBst4SowZw,1,1,4,TNU6HyF9jX-4MLqvHRgm5A

I will say it's a hit or miss, great concept people love it but there's an art to steaming seafood in plastic bags with juices, they tend to keep cooking long after they've been removed from the steamer especially since they keep the bag tied.  When sitting in the back and when they bring it out to you.  That extra time cooking in its own juices tends to overcook the food, I ordered blue crab for 11.99 a pound that gets you 2 little crabs which is ridiculous they were totally mushy,snow crabs 18.99 a pound that gets you 1 cluster, I got a half pound shrimp which they serve with the heads on which makes them heavier they were borderline overcooked, I also paid $2 and change for a half dozen of sausages I received one sausage cut in 6 pieces lmfao the pieces were still attached.

I used to be a big fan of Boiling Crab and I had only eaten at Hot N Juicy once before so I could not tell the difference between flavors. A good friend of mine raved on about Hot N Juicy so I finally gave it another shot and ever since then, I'm here at least every month. I did try Boiling Crab again a few months back and now I really taste the difference. Hot N Juicy is just so much more flavorful and I find myself craving it frequently.

I don't have a bad thing to say about service here. The waiters/waitresses are usually very nice and there isn't usually a long wait for the food. But if you come here for dinner it usually gets pretty busy and parking gets frustrating.

I usually order 1 lb of shrimp, Hot N Juicy mild or medium with a side of rice. The Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all of the sauces and is so freaking delicious. I like to pour a little bit of the sauce over my rice and squeeze a few lemons.

I remember a while back, my friend took me to the one on the west side on Spring Mountain and we had to park down the street and walk over.  As we were getting closer, there was a line of people waiting to get into the restaurant.  It was like waiting to get into the hottest club - but when I took a look into the restaurant, it was small and a whole bunch of people just eating crawfish, crab, and shrimp with their hands, plastic everywhere, and I was just not excited to wait and go on that ride so we decided to go elsewhere.  

Well, a few years have passed - I am visiting Vegas and my friends tell me that they are celebrating a bday at this restaurant - and I think ""Oh no, not sure if I want to do that"", but I decided to not be a party pooper and go.  So we were a party of 20+ and the restaurant was a good space so I was happy about that.  There were napkins and plastic everywhere on our table and the table was covered in paper.  I was told to put on a bib and order the shrimp and crawfish.  

I was scared.  In my eyes, if you are going out to eat and you are paying an establishment to cook your food for you, you should not be preparing to nip/tuck (getting ready to get into surgery).  So the food comes out and here comes a bag of shrimp and a bag of crawfish that they stick in front of my face.  I ask my friends (who are not amateurs at this restaurant), ""What now?  How the hell do I eat this?"" They tell me to stick the food on the table and peel the shrimp.  Ok, peel, peel, peel, then eat.  Then the crawfish.  How the hell do I eat a crawfish?  You break off its head and pull the tail to eat the meat, I was told. 3 minutes after crushing this crawfish like a ravenous eagle, I take its insides and put it in my mouth.  Then I think, ""All this work for less than a bite full of food?""  Don't get me wrong - the flavor was good, but this is hard work.

After I devoured my food, I was tired.  My hands hurt, I smelled like fish and shrimp, and I was ready to take a shower.  For the first time, I think it was a good experience, but the next time I plan to eat out, I will go to a restaurant that does all the work and I won't feel so dirty after eating.",pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg,2,1,3,hJ7cfwrZ9IA0QhDMIip6ow

I have been going to the original HnJ ever since the Man V Food episode was filmed there, but the newest Hot N Juicy has a more special feeling to it. It definitely has a more youthful vibe than the older one. 

Pro-life-tip #23: Take a first date here. If they can handle you being dirty and smelly, they can probably stick around for longer than a month. If they don't enjoy it, sounds like a one-night stand!

Favorite choices: Snow Crab Legs, Shrimp, Sausage (cant get enough of their meat!), and some of the best wings and fries in town!

I knew about this place thru a cousin's yelp check in on Facebook. So we decided to try it while on vacay...this is a MUST stop for all you visitors! 

 The first time we went, we visited the old location which doesn't compare to this newer location at all. This location is a lot bigger and more staff and most of them are cute and cut even the females look great.  

So first time at the old location- what we had: 

 4 lbs of their crawdads...these are a waste of your money - most of these pinchers were about less than half an inch in size and were a pain to crack! Hubby ordered the spicy Hot n Juicy special and it was definitely HOT!!! 
4 lbs of shrimps - THE BEST!!! Lemon Pepper is the bomb!  LP is my favorite, if you like the taste of lemon grass you'll definitely love this flavor. 
Chicken Wings with fries - great 
Calamari - yummy! 
Sweet Potato fries - so yummy! 

total for this visit - $162.00 for a party of 10 with 4 kids and 6 adults 

2 nights later- we visit this new location...we just can't stop talking about it. It's that good! 

What we ordered this time around: 

5 lbs of shrimps...Garlic Butter, Louisiana, Lemon Pepper 
2 Calamari
Chicken nuggets with fries
7 orders of rice!!! - A MUST!!!
2 Sprite 
2 beers

I always get 1 pound of snow crab, hot n juicy flavor and spicy. If I'm feeling brave, extra spicy. I like to add in corn, sausage and potatoes to help fill me up. A side of rice is great too. 
We also like to get a pound of the clams in lemon pepper flavor and medium spicy. Just to change up the flavors. 
Cajun fries are great to snack on while you wait for your bag of deliciousness. 
The rolls are a great way to either cool down the heat of the spice or soak up the last of the juice in your bag.

So you order seafood by the lb, it is boiled in their different sauces, and then you choose a spice level. You put on a Bib and then you eat your food out of a bag and leave it all on the table. The seafood comes whole. As in the shrimp head and all. Everything is market price. They also have some baskets which are varying fried foods like catfish, chicken nuggets, fries, ect.

Tip! You can order a half lb of shrimp which is like the perfect size. 

Also if you are on a low sodium diet then look elsewhere.

I always get the same thing. Lemon pepper shrimp that is mild with some sausage steamed that gets cooked with it. Then I get a side of white rice.

If I'm feeling feisty then I get a potato.

If I'm with a group then I share some corn fritters. The sweetness really is delicious with the spicy shrimp.

I've had their étouffée and Cajun fries. The étouffée was eh and the Cajun fries are good! Spicy but not too spicy.

The price here is right, if they aren't slammed (which they usually are) the servers are all really nice.

The only bad things is that their bathroom always smells. Idk if it's a sewage thing but the men's room always smells, the trash full, and the sinks don't expel much water. 

Other then that the food is good and the service is usually good for what it is, and the price is also right.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,0,0,4,cHl8UGP_ZmVfVeEllXz2wQ

I can live with a place that is really low-brow in presentation.  No plates.  No spoons.  Paper cups. Food served in plastic bags served on a plastic table cloth.  No utensils were offered at all.  I had a few pounds of HotNJuicy crayfish that tasted pretty good, but were swimming in enough garlic to choke a small country.  Not that there's anything wrong with garlic.   Back to the utensils.  OK I get it.  Crayfish is something you eat with our fingers, but I'm supposed to eat boiled potatoes with my fingers?  That's too much to ask.   I'd also like to get offered the option of some sort of condiment with the crayfish.  Some cocktail sauce or melted butter would have been really nice, but despite having at least 6 waitresses in the place they barely spoke to us at all.  They just kept walking past us over and over helping other tables.  It was seriously incompetent wait service.  The person who took our order never really came back to ask us if we needed anything at all and we had to waive down somebody to bring a check and then we waited at least 10 minutes for change.  

The highlight of the meal was the soft shell crab basket.  The fries were perfectly cooked and the crab was plentiful and tasty.  Well done and a descent deal at around $11.  The $11 per pound price on the crayfish was high considering that there was not really a ton of food in a whole bag full.   At the end of the meal I started noticing everyone else had a bowl of lemons and what looked like a finger bowl.  We never got and because nobody was paying any attention to us at all it was a problem,  This is really messy stuff to eat.  Your fingers get caked up with garlic and spices and paper towels simply do not handle it.  When we asked for something to wash out hands we were instructed to go to the restroom - which was actually quite nasty inside.  Dark.  Dirty.  Pretty gross actually.  All I needed was a descent wet wipe like the kind most restaurants that serve messy food offer you.  Better than that would have been a finger bowl of lemon water.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to sell people food at $20-$40  per person the least you can do is offer them a wet wipe.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,0,0,2,6SCAJ_qRQctgNuhdvAOnRQ

The waiter said to try and drown it in butter and provided some additional bowls of rice... he added that to the bill BTW.

1) Corn Fritters: Deep fried creamy corn nuggets with ranch sauce. We literally crave this for days after we leave. 

2)  Snow Crab: We get three different sauces. I recommend the Hot-N-Juicy sauce because it's a blend with all of the other sauces. Definitely has a great flavor to it. 

3) Sausage and Corn: We throw these into the bag with the Hot-N-Juicy sauce. I've been told by those that don't like spicy that the sausage is spicy. However, I love spicy, so I think it's relatively mild. 

We also order beer and sides like rice and extra butter, but those are the main things. 

We ordered the crawfish and shrimp once, but I am not sure if the work is worth it. I'd much rather put the effort into crab. 

Just be aware, you'll reek of garlic and be prepared to get messy! I always go no-gloves because it's just easier to get all the meat out of the shells that way. 

It's always busy in here. I wish they stayed open later. They also have TVs all around, so it is great for watching the games. 

The service is usually good. There have been a few times it has been sub-par, but that might be because there isn't just one dedicated server to each table. They're all helping every table.

Oh, the only thing I would say is... don't order the oysters. They aren't very good. I love oysters, but these didn't taste fresh at all. There was also very little meat to them. I usually eat a dozen oysters by myself, but I didn't want to even finish my half-dozen. Oh, and maybe also avoid the desserts. We had a brownie thing once and it wasn't good. Walk next door to the gelato place instead!

Go with the snow crab. You won't be disappointed.

The difference to me with Hot N Juicy and Bowling Crab is the amont of butter they use. You can tell Hot N Juicy has more of sweetness in their flavor when the bag of shrimp comes out. Bowling Crab is different in a way that they have more butter added to the bag. So it really depends on the type of person you are and how you like your food to be served.

I would definitely come back to this place",0FDPuQzE0VC7PdrTT5yBXA,1,0,4,JMfpixRTpnEtmgVyLhdusQ

When I showed the waitress, she insisted on it being the fault of the way I disassembled the crab, which would've perhaps aided in yielding another 1/8 oz of crab meat if done correctly. Mind you, this was in addition to another $100 worth of lobster, shrimp and appz, all of which were delicious.

I'm not a fatty, I just like to splurge when the situation arises. If the young lady serving us would've even offered to comp me a house salad for feeling just a tad dissatisfied, I would've tipped her $100 instead of the $30 I left instead, which even my date still considered generous. I wrote this on the receipt though I'm sure the girl was happy to receive a tip at all regardless.

Cook it at home. You'll impress her more and save yourself the money and hassle of being underserved by a barage of young waitresses who could really care less about seeing you off happy.

The downside - don't bother ordering their any of their fried foods. We ordered calamari and the rings were TINY and overcooked, Cajun fries are regular French fries with Cajun seasoning sprinkled on top (nothing special), and the chicken wings were okay, didn't have much flavor to them.

My friend ordered a lobster at approximately 7:20pm. Everyone else, including those who arrived closer to 8pm ordered and received their food before my friend did. We inquired 3 times about his order, making sure his order was in fact taken. We were reassured that it was. In the interim, my friend was so hungry. He was able to get bits and pieces from what the rest of us ordered. At 8:35pm, over an hour after he ordered he got his lobster. 

When I spoke to Jillian, the manager on duty that night about the situation, her reply was ""There's nothing we can do. It's Friday night and we're dealing with two big groups."" Excuse me, but if you're establishment is so popular, yet you are not prepared to handle such business, then perhaps you don't deserve to be so busy. I mean there are plenty of places that would either employ enough staff to handle their clientele. At the very least Jillian could've offered a discount or something. Her nonchalant non-cooperative attitude was less than desirable.

The shrimp was amazing, perfectly cooked with awesome flavor (I ended up pouring some on my rice lol), the spice was perfect but we'll probably go a level higher next time. The fries were also great, everyone loved them.

I mean, I am a true head-sucking, tail-eating fool!!!  Most crawfish I have eaten has been a crawfish boil at someone's house. 
Then some friends wanted to go to Hot and Juicy, and I definitely joined the party. 

Service:  One of our friends at the table also worked here, so we were treated very well. Not really sure how the wait staff would be without our VIP. 

Food:  Ok, I'm probably not the best person to critique the food, because I'm a little biased of what good crawfish is. 
We did order a whole bunch of seafood for the table, because they have many other things...we had crawfish, crab legs, muscles, shrimp, and clams.  
I started out with the crawfish...of course...and was immediately thrown off with the heavy garlicky almost sweet flavor of the boil it was in. I tried all the other seafood, but just did not care for this flavor no matter what the host. 
The friend that works here suggested I order the Louisiana style, so I jumped all over that.  I ordered the crawfish extra spicy too!  It was much better than the original flavoring, but still not like home. I guess I'm just a crawfish snob. 

Overall review:  I won't be back anytime soon.  I will save my crawfish cravings to be satisfied when I go home to Louisiana to see my kin folks.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,0,0,2,ndvLqoJMJlZOE_rNjnQxkQ

TIME SPENT
once a week @ Lunch/Dinner times.

LAYOUT
this is the newest in the chain.   the older place is just a couple blocks away.!   i found HnJC to look like a mix between a brewery and sports bar.

SERVICE
no matter which HnJC you're at, the service is OUTSTANDING.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but EVERYONE who works there will also eventually ask what you need.

FOOD
there's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;

my one CON is the Snow Crab's ""freshness"" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ Rio's World Buffet as a local).

i have ALOT of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-potato fries, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^

PRICING
  on average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.

CLOSING
HnJC will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of Suicide Girls were waitressing the establishment.!

TIPS
1.  SAUCES: please don't bother with getting anything under SPICEY.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    EXTRA SPICEY will make you cry.
2.  Wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid.
3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds YUCK...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   Omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc.",nxtqjMAPbIyJT2-0rYFUbA,2,0,5,ipB8cgNyVMF9nEL510zx2g

So glad I tried it! We ordered 3lbs of *spicy* seasoned crawfish, spicy sausage, and white rice. They weren't kidding when they said SPICY. My nose was running and my eyes were tearing up, but I kept eating because it became an addiction to me. That hot n juicy of it was so powerful I couldn't let go.

This is more about how slow things took with getting out meal out and how long the gap was between food and our check to even cashing it out. 

My first issue was that we ordered mozzarella sticks and fries with 2lbs of shrimp and we got each item one at a time. Our shrimp orders came out first and then about twenty minutes I asked the server about our fries and mozzarella sticks and they had to double check our order. It continued to take another 15 minutes to get our fries and mozzarella at this point we had finished our shrimp and just took the fries and sticks to go. It was such a bad relay from ordering to receiving it really ruined the experience. 

An added fact to the ruined experience was that an action that should take only a few minutes took over 15 minutes. We asked for a check and to go boxes and it took an unnecessary amount of time to receive our check. I understand it was a Friday night and it gets busy. But an expedited process to get your check and cash out is key to a quick turnover and getting your wait down when you have one. I really wish it didn't take as long as it did to get everything situated.

I recommend the shrimp and lobster. Of course the lobster is the most expensive; however, once in a while it's SOOO worth the money. The clams are fantastic as well. My regular order is a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs EXTRA EXTRA spicy with 2 corn on the cob, a bowl of rice, and occasionally the order of lobster but that's rare because I don't want to spend a fortune every time I'm there $$$. The Hot n Juicy special sauce is by far my favorite, but the cajun is fantastic as well. I usually do one of each. They also have fresh oysters for appetizers, and you can also choose from blue crab, king crab, mussels, and of course, crawfish for your main course ;). 

The service is always great because the staff works as a team, so there is almost always somebody to refill your water, grab you more plastic gloves, etc.. 


**HERE'S AN IMPORTANT TIP!**: you WILL stink of garlic after this meal. Possibly for over a day! The food is worth it, but don't go here before your work shift, the gym, or a night out with friends because nobody will appreciate your stench! A thorough shower afterwards is crucial!

Overall, I love visiting Hot N Juicy for the fun environment, quick and attentive service, the killer spicy cajun flavors, and to get full off of a ton of seafood! As much as I enjoy Boiling Crab, HnJ is still on top mostly because of their sauces. HnJ has more of a kick and intense flavors.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,2,0,4,UpkwjecT8dYTBm0QefqZpQ

However, I did hitchhike 3 pieces of corn in someone else's bag of shrimp. Corn on the cob is just oh so good when it's been swimming with the shrimps.

4656317,2015-02-23,0,p3YqOYELqXtLyHz9T49p_w,"Normally this would go without saying, but it happened; sorppt 74 minutes is too long to wait for food once youve ordered. Thats 1 hour and 14 minutes of sitting at a table waiting for a simple order. We came as a party of two; we're regulars so, whenever we come here we order as soon as we sit down because we are familiar with the long wait times. We know what we like and get the same order every time, we love the restaurant and always bring in our family and friends, and this is the first time we have ever come down and had to wait so long for anything. 

Our simple order was for 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Spicy), 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Mild), and two sides of rice.
 
After the many times we have come we know that ordering clams / oysters takes about 25 min, ordering wings or fried cod can take from 30min-40min, but cajun/regular fries and shrimp are usually under 20 min. Yes i acknowledge that it was busy, it was the lunch rush when we came, and you did have 2 parties of at least 8 people maybe more, but still 74 minutes is a long time to wait from ORDERING to RECEIVING the food.

After 45 minutes we asked a waitress to check on our order, she left and came back and said, ""Your order is coming, when you got here the kitchen was behind at least 20 orders, ok? so its not as if we forgot about you."" Heres a tip, customers aren't as interested in hearing an excuse of whats taking so long, as what you are/will be doing to remedy the situation, also note that a simple apology or showing that its unacceptable to wait so long goes a long way. No one was apologetic or sincere until the end of our meal, when someone dropped off the check and said, ""Here you are, and I'm sorry for the wait."" The end of the meal is too late for the apology, it should happen in real time.

I was here twice last December and completed a survey each time, each visit the store wasnt busy, no wait time on a table and the friendliness was outstanding, straight 5s across the board. I hope your standards arent slipping, and your service isnt failing, i would hate for an tasty restaurant to suffer from bad/neglected service.",XdiD-8jtnk1lG1H8Z_4imQ,3,0,1,ZKABqibo8UN1EIgo1qi1nw

We ordered crab legs, shrimp, andouille sausage, and corn with the medium sauce. The food was so good and their sauces are still delish! The food is delivered hot, which is always a plus. The downfall with Hot N Juicy opposed to other seafood boil places is they do not give you all the food in one bag. The shrimp came out first, then like 5-10 minutes later the crab legs, sausage, and corn came out. A lot of people, like myself, like to have everything together. It's a minor thing, but it does drive me a little nuts. Lol.

On my bill were 2 charges for EXTRA sauce, $3.50 total. I explained I didn't receive any additional sauce so remove the charge.

The service here is awesome! I came in and put my name in to be seated. The lady told me how long the wait was, which was not that long, and I sat down and observed the others delve into their bags. Then when the time came for my friend and I to be seated, our waitress was right there ready to take our order. I asked some questions and she had answers to all of them. She was super nice and told me her honest opinion of some of the food. I decided to get what I got at BC to make a fair decision, so I ordered two pounds of the snow crab legs. One lb in medium and 1 lb in mild. My friend ordered 2 lb of crawfish in medium as well. And off she went to put our order. 

From the tome we put or order in, to the time our food was in front of me was probably around ten min. At BC it was linger and I had to check to make sure my order was still on the way. My friends food came out first. Luckily, she waited for mine to come out and then we began stuffing our faces. Holy goodness and juiciness! At BC, I had to fight to get to the meat and it wasn't as sweet or juicy, but not here. The crab legs were tender, sweet, juicy and hot! I had to slow myself down and savor the moment. I didn't want it to end. I also ordered corn, which was marinating in the sauce. So tasty!  The corn itself was boiled to perfection, then sitting in the sauce was even better! Medium is hot if you dip the meat in it like I did. The waterworks began because it was a bit hot, but good. I dipped the legs in the medium then mild after a few. I ate some of the crawfish too and that was really juicy as well. Some of them were a bit small, but still yummy. Our lady checked in with us a few times and each time I had no words, but nods because I was so into my food, and my mouth was full. I was already eating with my hands, to speak with food in my mouth would be throwing manners completely out the window.  By the end of our meal, I was ready to pass out. All worth smelling like garlic for the rest of the night and into the next day. 

The place has an open layout. They have booths, tables and chairs. Flat screen tv's hang on the walls and they also play music. The noise level is pretty high, but that's to be expected. 

I will be back here! Some may not like it because you eat with your hands and all the sauce and juice is just popping and flying. But they do offer gloves and a bib. So not to worry.

Pretty simple menu to read and they offer a few selection of seafood by the pound. It depends how much based on the market price of the day but it is not too bad. 

First you order what seafood you want and how many pounds. Usually a pound or 2 is good per person. Next is the type of seasoning and then the spice level. Servers usually warn you that the medium spice level is kind of spicy. 

There is also a back side of the menu where they offer sides such as corn, rice, rolls etc. They also offer domestic and premium beers as well.

I usually order a pound of shrimp and their hot n juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces mixed together. I also order a corn mixed with the sauce and side of sweet potato fries.

The seafood you order delivers in a hot bag with the sauce of your choice. The shrimp you have to peel the skin yourself which makes the experience fun and enjoyable. You could also ask for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to add a little more taste to your food. 

If you don't like getting messy, they have gloves you can use and oh they also give you a plastic bib too so you won't make a mess on your shirt because it could get messy.

There is a huge roll of paper towel so there is plenty to go around if you need to clean up. 

Overall the food taste great. Came out in a reasonable amount of time. Food is nice and hot. Our drinks were always topped off.

Ok so my first thoughts when I entered was GHETTO but I had heard the crab was THE BOMB. Catfish was delicious and when they say the sauce is spicy they are NOT PLAYIN!! I had the Soft Shell Crab it was tasty. The Hawaiian sweet rolls were crusty hard, HELLO that is not how they are supposed to be served.

Do not expect tremendous amazing service it was very casual and they were young and busy and seem to just want to make sure you got your beverages and order and that was IT! I think their clientele isn't necessarily looking for more so I get the feeling that is why they don't try harder.

My advice if you are a local order take out. If you are a visitor take heed.

I usually order a half a pound of the mild Hot and Juicy Shrimp with 2 corns and a side of rice. The calamari (regular) is really good and the sweet potato fries always leave me craving for more. The oysters are good and of decent quality. 

The service was amazing! We had two servers that were helping my party of 4 and they were friendly, attentive and very fun. They made the experience even a better one. We were even given a ""girls of hot n juicy calendar"" that had a selection of their workers from different locations holding seafood. It was really funny and fun to look at. We got a kick  out of the model dressed up in an elegant gown holding up crab legs. My friend made a joke saying ""When you're classy AF but got crabs..."" hahaha. The waitress thought it was hilarious. She also gave us mardi gras beads and bud light bottle openers. It was a great dine in experience.

I definitely like HnJ better than boiling crab! It still is fun but more warm (welcoming) and not as loud so you can actually hear what people at your table are saying. I feel like the shrimp are bigger and of better quality and the waitresses are more fun and personable.

And if you're feeling a bit adventurous and like lemon pepper flavor, ask for lemons and black pepper salt. Squeeze a couple lemons into the sauce cup with the salt and pepper mixture.

I love the sauce at Hot N Juicy, it is definately in the Top 3 in my crawfish eating adventures. I love the ratio of sour, cajun and just heavenly goodness. You can never go with the crawfish here, they are fresh, good sized and perfectly cooked! If anything is off, just let your server know and they'll take care of it. 

Love their baskets as well, catfish is plentiful.. and kind of tastes like cod in my opinion... weird... I was expecting fishy! It's ok cod is good too. The fries they have are better than Boiling Crab because they are more starchy and taste more real! Love dunking fries in Ranch sauce.

I'm not kidding. I went to the doctor, and I was on prescription-strength antacids for nearly a month. 

BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!

Here's the deal: you buy a bag of seafood, pick your sauce, and they dump it on the table. We got 1 lb. of shrimp and 2 lbs of crawfish, as per our server's recommendation -- and it was WAY too much for 2 hefty, hefty eaters. The shrimp, especially. Ye gods. Now, don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but there is a lot of meat on each plump and tender morsel.

My favorite was the crawfish, with their signature sauce. It's incredibly flavorful, and the red potato and corn can't be beat. You pick it apart with your bare hands. My fingertips got bath-tub wrinkled. How primal. Yes, you can ask for gloves. Yes, you're less of a (wo)man for doing so.

We got the corn, sausages, black mussels, crawfish and shrimp in the hot n juicy flavor. The flavoring was decent, not bad but for the price and size I would think twice the next time. The sausage pieces they give you are tiny I would've thought they would come out as bigger pieces, but they're pretty thin and not worth it. The crawfish can be small, the mussels were the least satisfying, but the shrimp were the best here. The shrimp were good sizes and were very sweet tasting and flavor-some.

I have preached the wonders of shrimp and crawfish to all my friends and will even choose H&J over The BoilingCrab. I have had many wonderful dinners at the original location and the servers are always so attentive. So why the low rating for this new location you ask? Its not the food that lacks at this location, it's the service. 

We tried out this place on a Thursday night around 9:00.. It wasn't too busy so when we arrived the hostess sat us right after she cleared up a booth. After a while a not so enthusiastic nor friendly server took our drink order. Then when she came back we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + potatoes, rice, rolls and sweet potato fries. 

Slowly our order started to arrive one by one delivered by a food runner.. Soon we received everything except the sweet potato fries. Over half way through our dinner still no fries.. And no sign of our server.. So we have to flag someone down & ask and we find out that they ran out of SP fries a while a go and our server was supposed to tell us.. Then we are told not to worry it will immediately be taken off our check..

At this point our server has yet to once check up on us.. I spot her bottle blonde pig tails numerous times chit chatting with her co workers and horsing around.. 

Then we have to flag someone down again to place a Togo order but then we're told the kitchen is closed...  

Finally our server shows up only to plop a
checkbook down on the table.. Peeved, we want to leave so we give her our card., when it comes back we realize they didn't take off the fries after all.. So we go to the front and the girl apologizes and says she needs to swipe the card again but we should be rest assured it will only be charged once because they settle all the transactions at the end of the night. So there goes another 5 minutes of waiting around due to bad service all the while food is still being brought out to tables.. ""kitchen closed"" my a$$.. 

..The next day sure enough the card got charged twice from hot and juicy. 

Now I'm sorry, I honestly don't mean to be rude and I am a pretty patient person but seriously how hard is it to be a server at a restaurant that only has plastic silverware, paper towels and serves their food from a plastic bag.. ?

The clams were nice and plump and cooked perfectly.  They weren't rubbery at all, quite the opposite.  Also, the shrimp were cooked perfectly as well, which I was really happy about because both the last times I went to Boiling Crab, the shrimp were over cooked and tough.

I also found myself loving the HNJ sauce more than the ""Whole Shebang"" at BC.  It was much more flavorful and not as thick so it coated all the seafood evenly.  Everything was served really hot so you never felt like you were eating cold seafood.

1 Ambiance - 4 star - for an asian strip mall, where you expect nothing, you get a nice, large place, high ceilings, decent decor, room to wait and plenty of table and chairs. You are in a busy area, so parking is easy / not easy.  It is crowded.

2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here is young and very pleasant. I think that people here enjoy working here, enjoy explaining the in and out of what to do and how to order. I really enjoy the staff here. 

3  Food - 5 star - Wow, amazing, tasty and an experience that adds to the overall feeling.

a.  Shrimp - Large, tender, juicy, filling, easy to peel.
b.  Crawfish - Well, they are crawfish, eat the tail only, a small bit of meat and tasty, just a lot of work to get to the tiny morsel of meat...
c.  They have plenty of other choices, blue crab, snow crab, dungeness, lobster, mussels and more.  I just stuck to shrimp and crawfish.
d.  Sauces - We try the Lemon Pepper and the Hot Juicy in mild and medium. Yummy and not too hot.  
e.  Quantity - Easy to order more, generally 1 lb of shrimp per person at least and 2 lb of crawfish per person.  you get a potato and corn with 2 lb order of the crawfish!  Doesn't seem like enticing, however, when you are burning calories just to eat, to chow down on a marinated corn or potato is nice and different.

4.  Price - All are market price, however, for three of us eating about 7 - 8 lb of food, I generally spend about 30.00 per person, which is a good deal for seafood.  

5.  Toilets - OK, this place must be owned by an asian person because the toilets need to be modernized or cleaned...  Hey, we are going here for the toilets though......

They wanted to know what day I dined so that they could investigate to find out what may have gone wrong with my meal.  I'm impressed that they care enough about their customers to followup and try to prevent any problems they can find so future diners won't have a similar experience.  Every restaurant can have a bad day, or bad product that is unknown as the product was properly prepared.
  Everyone else in the place was having a great time and loving the food.  I heard no complaints, just praise, and trust me there is no way I could not hear what the people were saying ;-D.  This restaurant was listed in the top 30 must eat meals in Las Vegas and I can see why.  While I may have had some difficulties, I would still recommend eating there to other friends, especially if they want to have a good time with their meal.
  Based on the chance my experience was unique, that everything I did eat was very tasty, and that this company cares as much as they do - I will be going back again another day to give them another chance.  I hope it's good.  This is the kind of place I would like to bring a group of friends to for a tasty meal and a great time - something everyone else in the place seemed to be having that night.

5040409,2017-10-05,0,p3YqOYELqXtLyHz9T49p_w,Came to this place yesterday because this was supposed to be the new and updated hot n juicy . Walked in when tables were full with no one in line . A couple groups came in after us and I guess there was a discrepancy where one waiter was gonna skip us when we were actually next . Got to our table our waiter was a male and he was kind of rushing . My friend had been there recently before but it had been a while for me . I wanted to ask him about the different seafood specifically the crawfish. He said they didn't have live only frozen and said there was a bit of a taste difference . After going back and fourth about the pros and cons of frozen vs live he finally said they could give us a sample . He brought us water and didn't come back for about 15 minutes to take our order. I told him I wanted to order when we had our sample and he looked like he forgot about our sample altogether. When he finally brought it out the crawfish was dry. It had no sauce or anything it tasted like they microwaved it and put it in a bowl with nothing on it. Hard pass. I ordered the shrimp instead. From the time we ordered to about 15 minutes after our food came our waiter was MIA . We flagged down the 'lead server' SELINA multiple times to retrieve our waiter each time she said he was 'busy' the last time she copped THE WORST attitude and said 'he's busy and I'm your server now what do you need' I couldn't believe her attitude . We didn't get a bucket for our shells . Our waters were empty it was THE WORST experience . I was also having trouble peeling the shell off my shrimp and I asked SELINA if she knew a better way to peel them and she rudely said 'we don't offer that here' Seriously ? Then I repeat my question and she again gave THE WORST ATTITUDE IVE EVER GOTTEN FROM A SERVER . She said 'oh you need ME to show you how I do it' ? As if she was being sarcastic about me needing her help . After that our original server started showing up again . And by then I was COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR SERVICE. I don't know what she was going through or how our table caught the brunt of SELINA'S attitude but I promise I will NEVER come here as long as she is working there .,7wpoh2s6b4KKgx5F9CN8bA,0,0,1,QAFVHBh0iOfPtv5HUhXvtA

Immediately you have the bib put on you.  You then order everything by the bag.  They claim that their super spicy is really spicy, but this is not the case.  Don't be afraid to eat spicy, it is the best sauce.of the bunch.  Also sprinkle a little bit of lemon on everything and you will not be disappointed.

Don't eat here if you don't want to get covered in sauce.

In addition to the bib, they also give you gloves.  Everything you eat is covered in sauce and nothing is shelled.  You gotta know that you will get dirty, but it is worth it.  

We ordered crab, crayfish, breaded catfish, and shrimp.  The shrimp was by far my favorite.  Order extra shrimp and don't waste your money on the crab.  You only get two wimpy crabs for the same price as you get 25-30 shrimp.

Also order the corn fritters.  They are very good.

Again, this place was a really nice change of pace from where we had eaten in Vegas previously.  The prices were good, we all ate for under $18 a person, which was really reasonable.",YFCfAV1kKpTcBzdFz-5OxQ,1,1,5,MXLqDJorHUV8KUUO35NbjQ

Service: 5 - The service was fast and responsive, and our server was super funny! There was absolutely nothing to complain about. It was pretty much excellent!

Food: 4 - I like and crave seafood all the time, so this is one of my go-to places for that. They give you gloves and bibs, which are a little bit pointless, because you end up smelling like sauce and garlic over your entire self, no matter what you do!! 

Like a regular 'seafood and sauce' place, everything is styled so you can pick your food and basically make it how you want it. Because I'm a poor college student, I always get shrimp in the Hot N Juicy in medium or mild! And if you're Asian, like me, you know you're spending on that bowl of rice! Unless you're on some diet that day. But let's face it, you're at Hot N Juicy, you came to eat!! 

Sometimes, when I save up money, I'm able to upgrade myself to crab legs and raw oysters..you know, on special occasions and such :) 

If you like a lot of meat, I would suggest crab or shrimp, since they really have the most worthwhile amounts of that. The crawfish are actually really small here, and I'm not a fan of the taste, anyway. 

It is a great place to go when you're hungry! Just scrub, scrub, scrub when you're at home, because the smell will take a bit of work to get rid of!!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,1,2,4,YaTS8K2IahiDe2WYGaCEfA

Upon opening the door though, one gets a huge waft of what's to come inside. The air just permeated of spicy, garlicky goodness. I tell you, it smelled SO good.
A bit of disclaimer on this review: I'm not too big on most seafoods so take it with a grain of salt, for sure.  I realize it might sound odd then, that I would want to go to such a place. But hey, I love good friends and good food. And both at the same time? Fuhgedaboudit! And besides, theres still plenty I can find to partake of on the menu.
By reading some of the Yelp reviews previously, it seemed the thing to make a nice mess of what's left at the end of one's meal. You are prepared for the upcoming melee with stylish HnJ logo plastic bibs and tools to dismantle shells. We were also warned that their sauces were very hot, so it was suggested to order one level lower than what you think you want.
My friends got a mix of HnJ shrimp, crab legs, clams and crawfish. I opted for some etoufee, sweet potato fries and fried catfish basket with cajun fries. I also asked for some HnJ special medium sauce on the side so I could drench everything in it. My friend said all their food was great. I loved the HnJ special sauce. Probably could've gone to Hot, but the medium had a nice kick with savory garlic-ness. I was using a spoon to scoop the sauce from the bottom to make sure I got all the garlic bits and spices that settle to the bottom. I did have a feeling there was no cajun seasoning on the fries. No big deal, I just used the side sauce. Overall service and food was right on.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,1,1,4,FF4V40IPdPbaxG97jI3A4Q

During the whole meal, i could not help but compare it to my first dinner in a plastic bag experience at the Boiling Crab in LA.  They are both good and l can't decide which I like best.  I'm leaning HnJ just because it's in Vegas!

BUT...what if they were right next to each other?  Which would I choose?  Aw man, now it's difficult to decide.  I'm not going to cop out and say both.   HnJ has more heat than BC.  The medium spice at HnJ for example is hotter than BC's.  Seafood selection is about the same in both.  Service was better at HnJ.  Waiting time at HnJ was a lot faster than BC.

The interior was open and modern. Service was a bit slow, and at times, left us fending for ourselves in pursuit of bibs and gloves.

As for food, we ordered a pound of the Hot N Juicy special, spicy crawfish with sausage, two pounds of the HnJ special, extra spicy shrimp - both with corn and potatoes - as well as some fried shrimp. The seafood were around $11, fluctuating according to market price. Corn was .75 cents, potatoes .60, and sausage 2.75 for half a dozen. For the four of us, we were shed blood, sweat, and tears from the meal (perhaps not the first, but you get the picture). When they say Extra Spicy, they mean it. But the crawfish was good as a commodity (necessary for a first time). The shrimp though? That's where it's at. Succulent, packed with flavor - those babies were my favorite. As for its fried counterpart, the cornmeal breading was a bit overbearing and fully encompassing. It didn't stop us from devouring it as refuge from the spiciness of Extra Spicy. For about 60 dollars, this was more than enough among the four of us.

I love the idea around HnJ - communal and casual eats. Good food around people who love you despite your barbaric eating habits. As for the technicalities of a restaurant, service could be better.

I had been going to the other location on Spring Mountain for years and one bad experience sent me packing. But this location has changed my mind about your food for the better.

I came here with a couple of friends for a late lunch on a Sunday. They were a bit busy but thankfully we got seated right away. Since they walked us to a table in the back of the restaurant, I was able to get a good look around. It was nice to see that they keep everything clean. Considering the waiters are also the bussers, that says a lot. The staff definitely stays on top of their sections!

Once we were sat we were given bibs and menus right away and we were asked what beverages we wanted. Quick service for sure! That's always nice. Loren was our main waitress and she made sure that we got exactly what we ordered. She also stayed on top of making sure our food was coming out. Overall awesome waitress!!

While the flavors were amazing and everything was cooked perfectly, the heat wasn't quite there for me. Loren definitely changed that. She got me a side of spicy sauce so I could add it to my food. Still wasn't hot enough for me. So she made sure they really kicked it up a notch and got me the extra spicy. The heat still wasn't there but she warned me it'd come as I kept eating it. Thank you for the warning, you saved me from having a stomach ulcer!

Once that heat kicked in it was over. Definitely satisfying though!!

Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and time here at Hot N Juicy. The vibes were great and the food was greater, so we'll definitely be back to enjoy more!",ZnznUorow2SkhWTT5saAxA,32,22,5,NjyTJNHX1Epp-9wSz-aRUQ

Got some blue moons for $3 each, which is a pretty good price if you ask me. I came with 8 other people so we ordered a whole lot of shrimps and crawfishes. Got 2 lbs of the hotnjuicy special crawfish and 2 lbs of garlic butter shrimp, 2 lbs of lemon pepper shrimp, 1 lb of louisiana style shrimp, 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 order of cajun fries, and some rice. The bibs and gloves they provide are very handy, and you should change your gloves once or twice during your eating period because the sauces definitely leak through and you'll be stuck smelling like cajun for a few hours or days after. The crawfish were a bit of a struggle for me to break into, but the sauce did it for me, so good and with a kick (my lips were for sure burning way after finishing eating). We started taking shots of balls of rice with the different sauces on top, DELISH! The shrimps had a significant amount more meat than the crawfish an were easier to peel.

My only concern was that the crabs were a bit difficult to crack but then again I'm used to cracking the Alaskan crab legs.

But other than the difficult cracking, the mix of all the seasonings was just a great fusion of flavors to really individualize their seafood from anything I've ever tried.

This place is delicious. I moved out of Las Vegas for a period of time and whenever I visited this city, I always always always have to eat at Hot n Juicy at least ONCE. It is always a must! The flavors are unique and different. No, I didn't come here due to ""Man vs. Food"" .. in fact, I never watched that show. I came here because I heard it was good and their first location was ALWAYS packed! The wait is always humongous! 

And yes, there are actually two locations and this one is their second location on Spring Mountain. It's newer so the decor is more modern and the ventilation should be a whole lot better than their first building. 

So you don't like crawfish? That's fine. I don't really have a preference for them either. In fact, I think they're not really worth it. Each crawfish doesn't have much meat ... you'll be eating a few tons before you get full! Why? Well, Hot n Juicy sells it by the pound ... so with the little amount of actual edible goodness you get that comes in the huge clanky shells, you don't get much. But no worries! There is SHRIMP on the menu!! Of course, there's crab and whatnot on the menu too but that's not my concern. SHRIMP is my recommendation and it will fill you up for sure!!

So what they do is sell seafood by the pound. You get to choose a sauce and the spicyness level between mild and extra spicy. The shrimp is cooked in the sauce and they bring it to you in a plastic bags. Yes, it's different. Yes, you may not like being served food still in the bag. Sure, you may not like using your hands and they got plastic gloves for you folks. But it is YUMMYLICIOUS. Prepare to get messy ;) It's honestly worth a try ... get adventurous once in a while. You never know what you'll come across!

I typically order 1 lb of shrimp. Hot n Juicy special. Add corn to that. As for the spicyness level, it depends on my mood. I have tried mild, medium, and spicy. Mild is the best and their mild is not the traditional mild. It's actually spicier than what people would consider mild. It is delicious with a little kick to it that gives it an oomph. Medium, to me, was very similar to the mild ... no real big difference. Now, spicy, that's the REAL kicker! It was SO GOOD. SO SPICY. SO FLAMING HOT. But honestly, go for the mild. 

I usually also order the cajun fries. They used to make them as regular fries with cajun powder on top but now they've incorporated the two? Who knows how they go about it but it's pretty good. 

So their sauces have a lot of garlic in them. You'll be eating and smelling garlic all night. Be sure you're a garlic lover! You'll even take the smell home so be careful of what you wear and what you bring in! Make sure they're all easily washable :D 

And a tip...if you're using your hands to eat, make sure to ask the waitress for some limes/lemons. After you finish eating, wipe your hands with the paper towels to get rid of ALL sauces on your hands. Then you wash and rub your hands with the lime/lemon. Do it thoroughly. It should take off a good deal of the smell away from your hands. Then you just wipe your hands again to get rid of the lemony goodness and wash your hands the regular way! :D

5353612,2012-11-25,4,p3YqOYELqXtLyHz9T49p_w,"READ FIRST: DO NOT get the crawfish! I know It's a bit ironic, but they are TINY and can barely get anything out of them.

Now onto the review. I visited the original place in LV a while back and thought the place was decent. Well, this location gives the whole concept a nice face lift with a spacious and casual dining room and a cool-looking bar you can seat at if you are by yourself. Being a saucy peel-and-eat seafood place, please expect a messy experience...and table, and hands, bib, etc. This is a unique eating experience to be shared with friends over a few beers, as long as everyone at the table is willing to work a bit for their food (peeling can be tedious).

I ordered the lemon pepper shrimp with no oil (I was actually impressed the cooks prepared my order fat-free) and my girl ordered the butter garlic crawfish. The seasoning was very good but a bit spicy, specially if you are not into spicy foods at all. My pound of shrimp was very flavorful and each shrimp was plump and perfectly cooked. On the other hand, the pound of crawfish was awful- tiny crawfish with little or no meat in them...A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I cannot say this enough...JUST GET THE SHRIMP!

Important tips:
* Be ready for a messy experience. If you do not like eating with your hands and perhaps getting splashed with shrimp sauce, this place is not for you.

* Get the shrimp and not the crawfish. Also, get two pounds of it if you are hungry.

* They charge 60 cents for a tiny potato! You are better off getting some rice on the side.

* Expect to spend about $15 per person.

* Even no spicy IS a bit spicy.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,4,2,4,KJ7uSNMmC3nu7Hxgb2I2Ag

Here, everything is about the spices and that flavorful sauce, you cannot  go wrong with any of the seafood items.

I specially like the clams cause there is no pealing to do and you can use the shell to scoop all the juices...so yummy!!!

My favorite side items would be corn, rice and bread roll (French people and their carbs lol!!!)

I also appreciate the Fact that they use real tasty butter and not the hydrogenated crap...

The Cajun fries were not all that but I guess that's because my grandma spoiled me with those fried goodness back in the days!

The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.

At Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers. 

The service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups.

The Hot and Juicy sauce is incredible, and the corn soaked in that sauce may be the best corn I have ever had. I had 2lbs of crawfish and in medium Hot and Juicy sauce.

My two younger kids were not as impressed. First, my son's fried shrimp (not the most complicated order) got lost, not once but twice. He got his food nearly 30 minutes after we had gotten ours. Also, my youngest really had a hard time finding something she really liked. It was ok for kids, but probably a better place for adults.

Boiling crab is really good too, but it's oilier compared to Hot N' Juicy. H&J's sauce is thick and goes perfectly with some steamed rice. Eat that ish with yo hands village style, straight from the table! cause it tastes better that way.

I find myself craving H&J alllllllllll the time! 

The reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because BC has their seasoned fries and catfish/shrimp basket on LOCK. if you've never had it, it's a must try over there.

Also, I've had a bad oyster here before, and had severe stomach pains... I didn't know it was bad because I've never had a bad oyster before, but when that excruciating pain kicked in, I knew it was that last oyster I had right away. It tasted really bad too, but I just swallowed it quickly as a natural impulse. (that's what she said!)

I would still come back of course, I love hot n' juicy, but owners, if you're reading this, please make sure you train your staff well enough to differentiate bad oysters vs good ones.

The sauce reminded me of a lemon butter sauce with a hint of curry. Even though we ordered mild, it was still spicy.

Wanna talk crawfish?  No?  Well, I do!  The crawfish come by the pound (which is how they should, by the way)... and they come in a bag-o-sauce.

We had lunch here since it was less busy than dinner time and were so glad we had a chance to try out the food.  Everything is pretty much steamed and then tossed in thick clear plastic bags to absorb whatever sauces you choose.  They also give you gloves and bibs because it does get messy, but that is where everything tastes so much better.

We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell, 2 lbs of Dungeness crab, 2 lbs of frozen  crawdads (they didn't have any fresh ones flown in that day), and 1 lb of shrimp.  We had them all tossed in the famous Hot n Juicy sauce (which is a combination of all their flavors they have) with a spice level of Spicy.  Man, it had major kick and made all the seafood taste so much better.  The hubby was surprised to see me for the very first time actually sucking on all the sauce juices from the seafood, normally I just peel away and eat the meat.

It is definitely two things that make this place well known:  the freshness and simplicity of their seafood choices, and the killer sauces everything is tossed in.  Staff were all very friendly (especially our waitress Polina) , always stopping in to make sure everything was okay.  Definitely recommend this place if you are a seafood fan.

This second location is considerably larger than the first location. When I peeked inside, I was like holy shiz, it's so huge. Most likely I'll be coming here instead of the smaller location. Traffic here will be slow compared to the other one for now since it's just recently opened.

My friend wanted to try this out so we came here for his birthday. I usually get my delicious cajun fries (they're spicy!) and 1 pound of the mild Lemon Pepper seasoned shrimp. Pretty yummy. I don't like the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning (I tried my friend's). I just prefer the lemon pepper. Don't think I'll risk the other seasonings, but I will definitely try them if a friend gets them next time. I believe I've tried them at the other location, but don't recall any of them standing out except the lemon pepper.

I absolutely adore the fries! Hell, just get the sweet potato fries and eat both of them. They both taste yummy.

I said, alright, if they place is so good, I'll take both of you there for lunch and it's my treat! Little did I know that this may be the most over priced restaurant in Las Vegas... And that's a fiercely competitive category.  First of all, if you're not into eating your overpriced Cajun style food from the same plastic bag it was cooked in, then you won't like this place. 

Now, pleeeeeze don't get me wrong, all the food we ordered TASTED GREAT!!! Big time... Although I recommend either be Mild or Medium spiciness levels, since the mild is hotter than most restaurant's Medium. My crab legs were delicious although a pound of them yields about 2 ounces of actual crab meat. The sausage was fast and the only item not so grossly overpriced. The corn was just OK, and the beverages were not up to the standards of an average Wendy's. For three of us, with only a single beer, an iced tea and an Arnold Palmer for beverages, the total for three of us with tip came to $118.00 and was $97.22 before gratuity. 

I am not a cheap diner, for example, I don't think twice about the cost of a Morton's or THE golden Steer or even the Fagao Do Chao Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas... But, they at least provide cutlery, silverware, genuine plates, cups, glasses, great service and keep your table fairly clean. Hot N Juicy brings your meal out in a plastic bag, warns you to put their chintzy and inadequate bib on to protect your clothing and wishes you the best of luck with only a seafood shell cracker and a plastic poker to dig the meat out of your food. Their napkins are not up to the task and look like the stuff used by high school cafeterias... Despite rudimentary service, a lack of utensils, throw away beverage containers and the overwhelming presence of enough plastic to cause a petrochemical shortage... And undersized portions... The food was as tasty as I was told... But no better prepared or quality than many other restaurants that provide dinnerware, utensils, cloth napkins, bibs that are OK for those bigger than a toddler and much better service.  

My three star rating is justified by the excellent flavor and preparation, as well as fast service as they rush you to get out so they can turn the table and make more money... I envy the owner of this place because with a 15% food cost and no dish washing expenses, the menu prices must make this business a Hot N Juicy Cash Cow!",LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA,2,1,3,nEYAzq5hNuixbafBEBCliw

No surprise here that I have to order a side of cajun fries. I feel like you can't go to these types of restaurant and NOT order a side of cajun fries.

The only difference with the sauce is that this one seems a tad bit sweeter than Boiling Crab. I'm still a lover either way =) This place also has a bigger selection on beer.

We came on a Sunday with a hungry party of 5. No, line and we were instantly greeted and seated. 

Like the real rocket scientists that we are, we ordered a large sample of the menu:

2lbs Snow Crab
2lbs King Crab
3lbs Shrimp
2lbs Craw-fish

The seafood was quality; no complaints on the size or freshness of our feed. My beef is with the seasoning. I've been to many a boil bag seafood places and was blown away by the taste. Yes, there was alot of sauce but for some reason none of it stuck with the meat?!? Once the seafood was extracted, shucked, cracked, peeled or decapitated, there was not much taste left?!?  Maybe they didn't let our stuff soak long enough in the bag? I know that it's possible because I've eaten at other places and the sauce penetrated (hehe) the shells and soaked into the meat. So yah it was a bit of a disappointment for me. 

Questions:
Why do they only serve corn and potato with the crawfish? (notice the singulars) I wish that they offered it with all of their bags. When we drop $200 + on a seafood feast, that's the last that can can do. How do you decide who get the one potato or corn among 5 people? Don't nickel and dime us when we are spending mad money here. 

Why do they not have mixed bags? I think it's a bummer if you want to sample everything and didn't bring a large enough party.

Maybe we will try the one across the street to compare. Maybe...

5918930,2011-06-12,3,p3YqOYELqXtLyHz9T49p_w,"I told one of my coworkers about a new business that is having a grand opening today, and to meet us there after work.  I didn't know the exact address, so I told him to just search for the Hot N Juicy by name and go to the one closest to the Wynn.  He immediately thought I was trying to steer him to some other type of establishments hidden in plain sight throughout Las Vegas.

At Hot N Juicy, where the girls on average are pretty, the service is very friendly and attentive, Hot n Juicy Special is always on the menu, individual experiences can be customized from Mild to Extra Spicy, you can definitely treat your mouth to a messy but happy ending.  And today only, you can enjoy it with a 2-for-1 special*.

Come early and expect to wait at least 40 minutes, or take up the offer of a free limo shuttle service to Hot n Juicy (original location) where the food is the same, but without the wait and the services of the Hot N Juicy All-Star waitresses.  Again, the limo is presumably for the Grand Opening promotion only.

Spicy level is supposedly a little higher than other places, so customize accordingly.  1 pound of crawfish may sound like a lot, but it really is not, as most of the weight is contributed by the lobster-mini-me shells.  If crawfish is not your thing, shrimp, lobster, clams, and various crabs (Dungeness, Blue, Snow and King), and raw oysters can be ordered.

You can add the following sides to your above orders:
Corn, potato, sausage, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, bowl of rice, rolls and even extra seasoning sauce.

Appetizers include Fried Shrimp, Fried Catfish, Soft Shell Crab, Calamari, Chicken Wings and Etouffee.

What I like about this place?  ""It is bigger on the inside"".  The waitresses remind me of Suicide Girls.  Perfect place to visit to satisfy your spicy food craving. In case there is a wait for the use of the restrooms or you have a tendency to stare at the waitresses, you have portraits of the lovely Hot N Juicy Girls to check out.  Or you can just pretend there is a line for the lavatory.

What I don't like or care for:  Shrimp are not de-veined.  The parking here can be a pain, as it can be rather scarce during peak hours.  Not to mention some less than proficient drivers to deal with.

Overall, I enjoyed my Hot N Juicy dining experience.  The food was pretty good, but dining here is more of a social activity for me. And if you have a problem with eating with your hands and getting messy, it is best to patronize a different establishment, otherwise enjoy!

Ambiance:  4/5  Roomy, with fishing theme decor adorning the walls and pictures of the Hot N Juicy waitresses on the hallway wall leading to the restrooms.
Cleanliness:  5/5  It is new, but I hope they keep it looking that way.
Food:  4/5  Nothing extraordinary, but it is enjoyable and fun.
Price: 3/5  About what you expect.  The main items are all priced at ""Market or Seasonal Price"", which for shrimp and crawfish are around the $10 mark.
Location:  4/5  Definitely close enough to the Strip for the out-of-towners to take a cab here.

Pretty solid 4 Yelp stars.

You also get an appetizer of fried calamari! Great place for friends, family and co workers.  In the heart of Chinatown Las Vegas.  Service was great non need to be proper eat with your hands like barbarian kings!  If you must use the shell cracker ok any other utensil is inexcusable!  Food Tate's great! You have the option of how spicy you wanted and if you wanted Cajun or regular!  Do not go there unless you have an empty stomach!  Plan on walking the strip afterwards to burn off the calories!",HoYfQAx16labbBKRm6z_OQ,0,0,5,76_OEnfROlCFfG2MmOfp8A

Awesome catfish, and the garlic butter shrimp was phenominal! The Cajun fries are great too! Definitely check this spot out!",vda53Vhp8uj12bTezsamsg,0,0,4,BxDxtjscbGKYeBHwAGg5eg

Our waitress could have been more attentive to us but I can cut her a little bit of slack because she had around 5 other tables with full parties that she had to watch over.  

Specifically on the food, it seemed a bit over priced compared to other restaurants in town (Boiling Crab).  I personally didn't order any seafood as I just ordered a catfish basket and tried my friends' seafood, which had too much sauce in my opinion which was swimming at the bottom of the bag.

As far as the restaurant itself, it's odd to have it as an L-shaped restaurant as opposed to a more open area.  There were a few TV's tuned to sports but they weren't very loud.

Overall, it won't be my go-to spot for Cajon food, but at least now I know.",PIqY8tBBbRIWmdpW7EFEUw,0,0,2,oEFLdY1IYmTdkltwH6sx_A
