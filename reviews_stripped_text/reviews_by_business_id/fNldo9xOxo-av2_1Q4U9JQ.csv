If you need a break from Carls jr (my favorite), McDonald's, Jack in da box, etc... this joint is for you.

I put reservations yes. Because you can order online or by phone!",daWNCo0XkahmHgqsOUpHFw,0,0,5,5m6jmB6B89OpEFXWsw3ehA

I asked for medium but the burger came out really dry, their fries are super salty and their shakes were kind of watery.",UT4Ya1vpvLPGH-_rbSXz_g,0,0,2,Iyc9NpQ_5FUeCLPMi9iINw

Got a standard cheeseburger and fries.  It was good, but I wish someone had told me the skinny fries are coated fries -- yech.  The burger was a wee bit overcooked and dry.  Maybe we should have eaten them there instead of taking them back to her house, but it wasn't THAT far away.

Had to go, though, 'cause I can go to In-n-Out any day but there's no Fatburger in my hometown...",y-1YkRfAGhmYXvpu412H4A,0,0,3,KymdXua-gZfPddeW6F269Q

When I went in all I wanted was a cheeseburger with the works.  I felt like I was signing up for life insurance.  They kept bombarding me questions.  Just do it right and stop making things so complicated.  It's supposed to be fast food.",nMeCE5-xsdleyxYuNZ_7rA,0,0,2,LHLrpQu-hkMGWZgkuh0hbA

this place is great-it doesn't matter where it's located in a food court or a stand-alone shop. they are always consistent. 

every thing is made to order. and the burgers always leave you wanting more. 

I lived across the street from in & out burger for 3 years-they are good but-fatburger is #1. 

always good service, fast & friendly staff, place is always clean & the decor is traditional burger stand. we love it!!!

Get yourself a baby fat meal with fat fries & a shake you won't regret it. Voted Best Fast-Food Burger!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,15,16,5,eYv3OI27DEov3G5jY-cXZQ
