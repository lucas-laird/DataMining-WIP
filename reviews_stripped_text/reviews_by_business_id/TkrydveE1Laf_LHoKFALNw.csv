I've tried their cumin lamb (excellent) and young chow fried rice (good although I wish it included another type of meat in addition to the shrimp, such as pork).  I would recommend trying some of the authentic Chinese dishes and asking the waitress or owner for recommendations.  They have lots of spicy dishes on the menu and some non-spicy as well.",uwBwq5VOgygquodaknyWUQ,0,0,5,QZPqcC7mdfyuyf1WFdFsRw

The owner lady try to over charge me for each dish, and when I pointed it out, she tried to play dumb like she didn't know. I've googled this restaurant online, other customers had same experiences with overcharging from this restaurant. So, ""buyer beware""! Just watch your bill and check every item's price if you go.

When we complained that they made one of the dishes too spicy, they simply said drink more water! eat more rice! Umm... that's not what restaurants are supposed to do. I love spicy food, as does the rest of my family, but we asked for the food to be a little spicy, and this definitely was not. The dishes that the waitress recommended weren't even good.

If you like spicy - this is the place for AUTHENTIC Hunan food!

Just ate here again as the DH and I passed through on the way back to L.A. and, while the service is not perfect (it seems as though English is not the first language of most of the people that work here), the service staff were polite and exceptionally attentive. They came quickly to take our order, brought our food promptly, and helped us to pack up our leftovers.  We were even brought tea and watermelon before they took our order! We did have to ask for a refill on our water. but all things considered, that was minor.

The food was again amazing. This time I had the string beans and spicy eggplant, and both were great, ample portions, well spiced. What more can you ask for? No, this is not Panda Express - if you want that, don't come here. But for authentic, tasty, spicy Hunan-style food, this place can't be beat.

1927686,2014-06-11,0,TkrydveE1Laf_LHoKFALNw,"My family is from Hunan so I was feeling a little homesick and missed my Granma's cooking. I brought people who don't really eat spicy food so the flavor will not be in it's truest form. In China we have 4 main regional cuisines, ""Xiang"" is from the Hunan province. It's often confused with Sichuan cuisine which features a different style of peppers and form of spiciness. ""Xiang"" cuisine is spicy, fragrant pepper, hot-peppery, fresh taste with sour spicy taste, it is an immediate reaction to flavors. The spiciness practically combusts on your taste buds. Essentially speaking if you're planning to eat this, you're going to sweat!!! The only authentic dish I ordered was the Duo jiao pepper fish head, the server insisted on whole fish so it's duo jiao pepper whole fish. It's steamed and the flavors is something you can't find anywhere else. Order this dish and you will have a decent understanding in Xiang cuisine. My friends ordered the Mapo tofu which is of Sichuan cuisine so that was just mediocre. We ordered a pork and pepper dish but the spiciness level was toned down to nothing so the flavors were missing. Finally, the thinly sliced vinegar stir fry potato was pretty epic. What I would recommend is if you can't handle spicy make sure you advise the staff but they will tone it down to where you won't really grasp all the flavors the cuisine has to offer. The venue is nothing fancy, it's simple, there is a flat screen that plays KTV videos. Did I mention peppers speeds up your metabolism? Another great reason to try this style of cuisine.",zHzvPBcXuzyGSAPzc0k2Bg,1,0,4,f2SALmvQxuAfIAP4jfghtA

2393713,2014-06-03,0,TkrydveE1Laf_LHoKFALNw,"HOLY MOLY QUACAMOLE! If you want authentic and spicy Chinese food.. this is the place to be! It is as authentic as you can get.. and how do I know? Well.. my, not-blood sister is full Chinese and she took me here! 

I have to say.. spicy food is not really my thing, but it was pretty good! The service was amazing and the place is so clean. They have a huge television where they play Chinese music all day. The seating is usually typical-- family style where they have the rotating tables in the middle and they also have small seatings for small parties.

Food:

Cucumbers- The cucumbers were fresh and helped me keep my mouth cool when eating the spicy food!

Shredded Potatoes- Yummy! The potatoes were thinly sliced and dipped in a somewhat vinegar sauce.. it was so good and one of my favorite dishes on the menu!

Mapo Tofu- It comes in a bowl filled with tofu cubes and red spicy sauce that is so flavorful!

Pork belly with vegetables- Not one of my favorite dishes.. the pork belly was tough and the veggies weren't as good.

Whole fish- THE STAR OF THE NIGHT! It was delicious but SUPER SPICY! They put a specific type of pepper on the fish and they cook it whole with a sauce on the bottom.. although it was super spicy, I couldn't stop eating it! The fish is so soft that it melts in your mouth! Word on the street was that if you flip over the fish, it causes bad luck-- so make sure you eat the fish they way it is presented to you!

I would probably not go back here unless I am with someone who speaks Chinese. It is delicious, but no one understood any English and language barrier is just hard. I wouldn't want to order anything TOO spicy for me to handle... or my toilet!",SWCLYANLMiXiPhW0mzicVQ,1,1,4,Y3qpRW6-vsoJ_4gFbknqKg

We asked for less oil, and the dished indeed were much more like home made, but tastes great still.  We asked for the fresh in-house made fish-balls. That dish is the best I ever tried in 10 years of staying in US.  Exactly the same good taste as back home in China.   My husband gave 50% tip at the end of the meal, to thank them for the hospitality and a great lunch indeed.    Well, part of the reason of the 50% tip is also because of the  price is good.     Overall, well exceeded our expectations.     We will definitely come again next time we are in Vegas.",iZH7Q7w5BbjdsXCg1XC1og,1,1,5,Kmch-MVxPoySqOHdTdy_0g
3577075,2015-10-13,0,TkrydveE1Laf_LHoKFALNw,"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK MANDARIN.

I wrote some prior reviews so please consult them.  I recently visited for the first time in 3 years and it was a really bad experience.  I walked around 2 PM or so and the place was virtually empty.  There was group of teenagers sitting at a table but that was it.  A man and woman greeted me and after I said I wanted take-out they gave me a menu.  The man said something to the woman and she then directed me to the last couple of pages and suggested I get one of a few types of dishes.  

I went to the chicken section and found a spicy chicken dish.  I tried asking if the chicken was boneless or not but they didn't understand me at all.  They eventually had to get one of the teenagers to come over to help them.  I assume maybe he was their son and spoke better English.  Still, though, he didn't seem to understand me.  Eventually we got it figured out and it turned out the chicken did have bone in it, but after a brief conference they said they could make it with boneless chicken.  So I ordered that and asked for it extra spicy.  This took around 5 minutes to ask & order.

After a while it comes out and it's absolutely massive.  I pay and leave.  I'm sitting in my car in the parking lot inspecting it when the woman comes out and I roll my window down.  All she wanted to do was tie the bag closed so it wouldn't spill and I'd be safe, but that's really weird.  She literally reached inside my car to do it, while I was in the middle of inspecting it.  After she went back inside I untied it and resumed inspecting.

So, what was it actually?  It was a styrofoam container filled with rice, and two huge styrofoam cups filled with oil, in which there was chicken.  It was probably 50% oil, 50% chicken.  I tried a piece of chicken and it was almost devoid of taste, it was not at all spicy, but more than that the quality of the chicken was awful.  Imagine those frozen preformed chicken breast patties (with rib meat!) that you can get at the store -- it was like they took one of those and cut it up.  It was TERRIBLE.

As soon as I got home I just tossed it in the garbage.  A waste of $16 :(

Long story short, unless you actually speak Mandarin (I am making an assumption, which may be incorrect, that they use the Mandarin dialect), don't even bother going.  Even if you do speak it, I'm not sure if the quality of the other dishes is any better.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,1,kOGYgC_0y5WINPG_Gd-PSg
3590856,2015-01-09,0,TkrydveE1Laf_LHoKFALNw,"I came to this place early tonight for a business meeting between my stepmother's company and her Chinese manufacturer. We had great service. Probably had something to do with the knowledgeable and Chinese dinner party. I believe they ordered about 20 dishes, mabo tofu, green beans, fried rice, some traditional pork belly dish, buttery bok choy, white fish in chili sauce, some kind of julienned beef with green onion, and more. Everything tasted superb! And according to my Chinese guests, the food was pretty authentic to that particular region of China. 
I didn't find anything too hot, but I also eat spicy food on a fairly regular basis. 

I recommend this restaurant. Once you have close-to-authentic Chinese food, you'll find it hard to ever want Americanized Chinese food again (orange chicken, etc).",9ouuAL1c8oWrxoq1Ty_3kw,0,0,4,IKNluGU86httr-zV2CWyYg
