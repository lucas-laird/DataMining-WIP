35471,2016-03-31,1,QF2P3oJqCJC9z0TPDDFVxw,"So bummed that this place didn't pan out! I was bugging my husband to eat some great tacos for a week while we were staying on the LV Strip. And this place ranked high on Yelp. 

I decided to just try their $2 tacos. They were out of the steak, so I got shredded beef and marinated chicken. 

I got a little nervous when I started looking at the food laid out in front of me. The place looked like a mess, unkept, and unclean. 

The worst part was that the sour cream bottle was swimming in a dirty watery ice bath and when the employee started to squeeze the sour cream onto my taco, the dirty water from that bottle dripped all over my tacos. Then, the employee charged me $2.50 instead of $2 for the what they advertised as $2 tacos. The $2.50 wasn't with the tax. The tax was additional. So disappointed. 

The tacos were ok, but I would never go out of my way to go to this place again.

With all the great places to eat on the LV Strip, I'd skip this place and pay more for better quality food and for a place that keeps up with healthy sanitary standards and practices.

They were not busy at all. I should have known when there wasn't a line out the door for $2 tacos that I should have skipped this place.",f9v_i9HV2iI1m0Dy29yKjg,8,0,2,lFlcQxO2JPI1qVhT5CtsXw

I was in Vegas on a work conference. After finding out that the evening event would only serve appetizers (I know, lame!) I quickly found a place for a quick bite. Yelp had a deal for DJs taco bar, so I gave it a shot. 

I got the fish tacos, and while they weren't necessarily the best I've ever had, for $10 they did just fine. I also got the beans and rice as well as chips and guac. 

I'll knock off a star for the fact that the food was good, not great. Value-wise, I feel like I got a lot for my money. They also took longer than I expected to make the food.

I would probably rate it as $$ for price though. We had a chicken and steak burrito ($10 each) and they were running a special for a $2 beer with purchase of any burrito.  Food can be a little more expensive in Vegas so for Vegas prices it is comparable.  The portion size was generous and and taste was great. Service was excellent. The woman behind the counter even went next door to get me a Diet Coke when their Coca Cola machine wasn't working. Seating inside is limited but there is a patio outdoors. No AC but they had blower fans which kept us cool. The restaurant was clean and we were amused by the mural on the wall. Overall a good experience!,9jI3Ut_de_gKkaeVVN4Elw,1,1,4,Pxr9j2-630nj3k_jmCqQdw

The burrito was humongous. The meat was tender and delicious. There was a lot to choose from for my burrito, so I piled it up. I highly recommend it.

The chips were okay since they tasted like they came from a bag. I was kind of hoping they made their own, but it's not taking away from their quality.

The hot sauce wasn't too alarming, but it's probably to cater to the average person. It was delicious though.

The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because while I was eating, there were flies constantly landing on me, which disturbed my lunch. That's why I took half of my burrito to my hotel room and devoured it.",DsUWH1tYhL2BTkyiFPYYkw,1,0,4,CZkVkSLLVf766XUm04mrKg

The server was cute when she looked at us rather concerningly when we asked for the super hot sauce and just drizzled it on top.

Fish tacos aren't that hard but when I ordered three, I was told it would be another ten minutes. No problem but when I see what looks like a bag of frozen tilapia (I think it may have been fresh) being pulled out, cut into three minuscule pieces, and slapped on a grill, I'm not excited. Throw in white rice and very plain black beans and I've really lost interest. 

Then, when I'm ready to pay, the price is increased by $1.50 because I ordered the fish. I'm fine with that, but at least put it in your menu board so it is clear. It definitely isn't worth an up charge.

The Taco Platter:
- came with 3 tacos rice and beans.
- I choose pork, shredded beef and chicken. All cooked and seasoned well.

Quesadilla:

- same choices of toppings and sauces to go inside quesadilla.
- I had to assist mi lady with finishing it. Ha ha

I've been visiting Las Vegas twice a year since 2006.  My worst dining experience out of 20 visits to Las Vegas was at DJS Tacos.  The service is absolutely horrible.  This is a Wednesday evening in February with zero people in line.  It took several minutes to get acknowledged, and after finally being acknowledged the rude gentleman takes my order and walks away for several minutes.  My best guess is he was heating up the tortillas.  I'm not 100 percent certain since he just stomped away.  Leaving you wondering if he is coming back and if I was possibly talking to a brick wall.

After taking his time the same gentleman comes back with a lady.  She asks my wife what kind of meat she would like for her tacos....However she made is clear they had no pastor, carne asada, chicken, or fish.  For a place that was dead as a door knob you think they'd prepare better. 

The beef tounge was sitting in water and full of fat. The lady acknowledged it was a bad piece as she unpleasantly picked away at it.  It was agreed they would cut up a better piece, but they still served us the tounge we asked them not to. Tounge was shredded instead of cut into pieces.  Actually more like ripped apart ......The carnitas sat in oil and basically taste like a ball of grease.  The barbecoa might as well be carnitas because they taste the same.

This was a very unpleasant experience and deserves no further business from me.

Also, the rice and beans that came with the taco plate weren't seasoned very well either. 

The majority of the seating is outside, and the inside seating is very very casual to the point where they probably could a bit more with the ambiance. On my next stop back in Las Vegas I'll find another spot for tacos.",E_1rVCWq4NgbXhEjMC651Q,2,0,2,G1aE_c7VNQw_XNWnbK5FDg

Maybe good for Vegas but you can get way better on the streets of LA, San Diego or Phoenix for sure. Carne asada was cooked well but under seasoned. Grilled fish needed salt too. Fried fish was good though, well seasoned, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. That being said, carne asada is the measuring stick for street tacos and this place is just meh...

So, decent food - 3 stars worthy I would say. Then why two stars? Because they treat you like you're inconveniencing them when you go in there. One guy wouldn't even look at me and my wife as we stood and waited to order. Took the order of the people in front of us in line then walked away without so much as acknowledging our presence. When someone finally did acknowledge us to take our order, he was short with us and kinda yell-talked at us as if we were on his last nerve. I'm a nice person and I go out of my way to treat people with respect, if I'm spending money at a place, I expect at least some of that in return and, street food or not, you won't get it at DJ's.

We actually visited DJ's Tacos the day after (Sunday 1/5/14) around lunch time. It's located in a small plaza, I believe it's called Hawaiian Plaza or something along those lines. Small establishment but the quality of the food definitely makes up for it big time. 

I ordered a taco plate (includes 3 tacos, rice and beans) for $8.95. I chose carne asada tacos, while my man ordered a carne asada burrito ($9.95) and 5 additional tacos ($2 each). I would say the rice and beans portions were a little on the skimpy side. But the carne asada tacos were delicious! They were tender and juicy, full of flavor. ¡Que Sabor! Everything is made to your liking from your choice of beans to toppings (cilantro, onions, etc) to salsa (pico de gallo, jalapeño sauce, etc). The food is really fresh and yummy. Sorta reminds me of chipotle but less franchise-y and more authentic Mexican food. Did I mention that the tortillas are hand made?! Yep, quality. Also, they have one of those digital soda fountain dispenser and horchata as well. Lastly, they have this awesome mural of Tijuana that takes up one entire wall of the restaurant. It is so interesting and dramatic. It's one of those neat little features that makes this place special. 

The customer service is great, too. The two ladies who helped us out were patient and made everything to our liking. They were friendly and honored our yelp deal. This place is awesome, but only reason why it gets 4 stars is because the prices are a bit steep and portions run on the small side

We ordered the chicken and fish tacos with the onion and cilantro. Let me just say, the fish tacos were the best I have ever had. I asked the server to put the hot salsa for the first order that I placed for my group, assuming how hot could it really be!?! Mind you, we are all spice junkies and I can handle a lot of heat. These tacos set our mouths on fire... But it was too good to stop. We ordered a couple more rounds of tacos and ate till we were all satisfied. Even the woman at the cash register was really friendly!

The only reason I gave this place four stars was because on the last day of our trip we came here for lunch as I was craving that fish taco. The lunch line was a little long and I patiently waited. As soon as I got to the server, I asked for fish tacos...and I was denied. I informed the guy that I didn't mind waiting but he wouldn't budge :(. I had to settle for the chicken tacos instead.

The staff at DJ's is also super friendly so you can't go wrong.  They even have a 10% off check in deal on yelp! 

The other half and I both decided on getting taco plates.  This includes 3 street tacos with your choice of meat and toppings and beans and rice.  I was very happy to see lengua on the menu as you only find this is authentic Mexican eateries.  I chose lengua (beef tongue), carnitas and pollo al pastor for my three tacos.  My only regret was not getting all lengua because it was so good!  Lengua was tender and flavorful.  The other half got carne asada on his tacos.  Everything else was what you would expect in street tacos.  What we loved about the black beans is that they were unseasoned.  Plain, simple food is what we like and it works!  We saw someone order the sopes and vowed to return the next day to give it a try but ended up on the other side of the strip, so didn't get to try that out (darn).

TLDR:
-NUTS AND THE WAIT STAFF DON'T EVEN KNOW!!!!

Food:
Asada tacos (~$2) NUT ALERT!!
-Decent fix at the wee hours of post-partying. Very typical style tacos. Nothing too crazy. 

Carne Asada Fries POSSIBLE NUT ALERT!!!
-Perfect for post-partying gluttony. They use your basic fries that are more on the soggy than crisp side. Large order with classic toppings like guac, sour cream and salsa! I'd recommend this! 

Unfortunately:
-The tacos for sure contained some form of nuts. We asked the staff behind the counter multiple times about nuts and nut oils and they reassured us they didn't not use any nut items. Not a fun way to spend the night after long hours of clubbing. Two members of our party have a fairly serious history with nut allergies and both of them got sick. =( since the reaction happened after a few bites of the taco, we're not 100% sure on the fries. Be wary! 

Drinks:
They have your basic soft drinks. 

Service:
Call before you show up. They weren't open the first time we tried to come even though they were 'Open' according to yelp.

It's not as dingy and dink as most places I'm used to, but being on a prime location I think they do pretty well up keeping the place.

I ordered the El Pastor, Carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua -- Ci yo soy mucho hambriento!  How you gusto me Spanish!?  They didn't put any sauce a top, which for me was odd since the hot sauce is that extra kick that does it for me.  I had to ask for some on the side which was not a problem.  Overall, the lengua was blah, the carnitas was good, but my favorites were the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  Guess they had those ready and popping since I gather these are the popular choices.  The sauce which gave it some kick along with the lemon and onions really helped keep the meat moist.

The food isn't mind blowing. It isn't the best Mexican I've had. But for the price, location, and the taste, it's worth giving them a try.

I only had their tacos. They were cheap and pretty good. A bit on the soggy side with all the sauce, like I said not the best I've had but good. Has a street taco / backyard / homemade taco kind of taste.

The rice was plain white rice so I didn't bother trying it (come on, serve that delicious Spanish rice).

On this particular evening, the craving struck around 11:45 p.m.. We'd already walked around the limited food options at Excalibur's food court, so when we saw DJ's wasn't that far from our hotel we set out on foot.  Running. Then walking fast. Then running again.  We made it up to their window with a minute to spare and were greeted by a couple glances at their clock.  

They (thankfully) made us each a couple of tacos and we enjoyed them in the open-air plaza outside their establishment. Tables and chairs and napkins were set up and we enjoyed our food before walking past the dark restaurant back to our hotel.

A couple nights later we returned for more tacos, at a more decent hour.  We went inside this time.  Honestly, the tacos were better the first night. Or maybe they weren't; and I just wanted them more the first night, and I thought they were better because they satisfied my need. But either way, they were good tacos for Vegas tacos!  We never plan to stay at the Excalibur again, but if we're walking around this part of the strip and come across DJ's again I'd definitely make room for a taco or two.",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,1,2,4,XjtEp56ts0P-sb1lSxdgiQ

We just happened to bump into this tiny little joint in the Hawaiian market place, just by chance. Long story. Anyways. This is run by a bunch of really sweet people. And the food we got was - out of this world. Now, I have never been to Mexico but I love Mexican food. And so I have experimented with the cuisine pretty much all of my adult life. The plate of spicy hot Tacos that we got from here was freshly made in front of us, and had the flavors like I have come across only a few times before. Simply amazing. The soft taco shells were warm, had a touch of grease, and the carnitas with all the toppings I chose - especially the very hot green harbanero sauce - OMG, I was in heaven.

Then while getting a drink, my partner suggested something that has stuck with me because the icy cold glass of HORCHATA (that is a sweet rice-water cinnamon drink) which I had to go with my spicy hot food, really made my day in the hot Vegas heat.

Also, we could see such a good mix of people sitting inside as well as outside the joint. A fair amount of local latinos which really showed us that this place is truly authentic. Bingo! Very low key but heavenly food. I don't mind at all eating in Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery if this is the Quality of food that I get.

Yelpers you failed me here. I purchased the yelp deal $15 for $10 prior to arriving here based on stellar reviews. 

Disgusting- all the meats sit in their grease in chaffing dishes under heat lamps u build your own entree, all toppings are also sitting in chaffing dishes they are served buffet subway style. They consist of lettuce onions, cilantro, cheese, guacamole, and salsas. I did not order their nachos or carne asada fries but noticed they use nacho cheese for these entrees; this practice is totally americanized disgusting, nachos should be made with real cheese. 

Expensive- I ordered the carne asada torta sandwich 8.95 with beer $4. And my wife ordered the carne asada quesadilla $9.95 plus $1.50 add quacamole and 2 tiny tacos al pastor $2.50 ea. and corona $4. Total bill 35$ so much for affordable. I understand vegas prices are inflated but for a hole in the sewer mexican restaurant this is unwarranted. I would not mind the price if the food was good quality.

Quality- my wife's quesadilla was big lots of cheese with a small amount of meat. The cheese was not completely melted they made it in a hurry not sure why they were rushing since there was no line at the time. The meat was fatty and greasy from soaking in the chaffing dish. She took a few bites and could not finish it. Just too greasy. The tacos were small no complaints about meat says they were good not the bomb. I had torta they toasted the bun added a slather of beans a slather of guacamole lettuce onions and asked me if I wanted mild or hot salsa. Im mexican I need it Hot yo! I went to take my first bite and noticed the bolillo was soggy it had already soaked up all the grease from the meat. Their picante salsa was bland I could not taste A hint of heat from it non authentic like it was served from a jar.

Ambiance- located in a strip mall on the strip like a small little ghetto inside the strip. It is dirty, you will dine outside with wobbily tables and hard chairs. Only feeling that was authentic was the ambiance felt like I was in TJ. Went out of my way to eat here never again. Eat at a nice restaurant share an entree with your partner will b the same price.

Chillis closed at 11pm on Sunday so we headed to DJ's Tacos which closed at 12pm. The line was short but taking such a long time. It took 30 minutes to get helped plus the person in front of me had been waiting for 45 minutes. 
When it came to being helped. There was a young guy as the cook, a young girl also as the server and an older lady as the cashier. The person in front of us got served. It came our turn we ordered quesadillas. The cheese wasnt even melted, the cashier starting serving food while there was someone ready to pay. The cook is scrambling to get his orders done. Which take it his apperance was a bit eh. His pants were low you could see his shorts/boxers. Then out of the back this guy comes out looking like he was tweeking, a pale face very creepy. Then the cook is cutting the quesadillas in half because the young girl is unable too. Taking him away from cooking, in the mean time theres a loooong line outside. 

We finally get our food and ready to pay. Not sure if the Cashier is the owner. But shes rude and unproffesional. The soda machine no refills, and napkin dispenser is not a self serve either. The cashier hands a few to you. The place is not cheap. Go to McDonalds instead to Monte Carlo and save your stomach & money.

Tasty tacos

Cons
Horrible atmosphere and service

The tacos (I got carne asada and carnitas) were very tasty and they have a nice little selection of a few different beers. A little pricey but it's on the strip. 

Unfortunately, I decided to eat in, which is a huge mistake. I asked if their wifi was for customers, and the person at the cashier just waved me away. Maybe she didn't understand me, maybe she didn't know. Call me old-fashioned, but I think staff should be polite to customers when they ask a simple question and find out the answers if they don't know. As I was eating, the place started to fill up with smoke. It was coming from the grill where they were cooking the meat. A little smoke, I don't mind. But it was literally filling up the place to the point where it was quite thick. Me and another couple that was there left and ate outside. Just odd that they have such poor ventilation and didn't give a crap.

This place is a total find and is located on Fremont Street next to the Heart Attack Cafe. You can not miss it because they have a blinking red neon sign that says $2 Tacos. Enough said!!!

I needed a light snack before dinner after skipping lunch, so I decided to pop in here. They had a large selection of meats to choose from. I decided to go with a pork carnitas taco and a shredded beef taco. Both were really good and packed full of meat. The $2 price also included a choice of hot sauce and I went with the medium green salsa.  Cilantro and raw onions were included too. I skipped the cilantro but dived in on the raw onions. Luckily I had a tin of the Yelp shaped breath mints to freshen me up afterwards. 

The meats were really tasty. There is nothing like a slow roasted piece of meat in my book. I saw the grilled steak and grilled chicken but they looked a little dried out. This location has many of its meats precooked and sitting in warming trays. This is why I choose the two meats I did. The pork carnitas and shredded beef were sitting in their own natural juices and I knew they would be yummy at any time of the day. I was dead on. 

I decided to go with a medium salsa because I was taking a redeye flight back home and I wasn't looking forward to terror at 30,000 feet, so I played it safe. They had several salsas to choose from but I was happy with the medium salsa verde. It had the perfect amount of spicy without being too over powering. 

The location is in a food court without any  mall. There were two other restaurants in here. One serving pizza/pasta and the other serving Asian food. I did not try the other food at these two places but was offered some Asian chicken on a toothpick that I nicely turned down. 

So if your on Fremont Street looking for a light but filling snack then I highly recommend this place. The tacos were really good and I would come back here in a heartbeat for a good meal deal that won't break the bank.",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,17,13,4,OepCeoS5rsGvn-6DbLlfVA

It was our first time here so we didn't know what we wanted as toppings for our tacos. She kept scooping up different toppings assuming that's the one we wanted with an annoyed look on her face. I believe the lady ahead of us felt the same way because apparently the other girl working put the wrong sauce on her tacos - she was rushing the lady as well. At that point, we felt like we were ""bothering"" her and left with some plain ass tasting tacos. We got steak and chicken tacos and it was so bland! Rice and refried beans also nasty. 

The only seating available was outside with the pigeon shit covered tables. Disgusting.

It's a small Taco spot but don't let the looks foul you. I came with my best friend who recently moved to Vegas and even she stated, ""I've been on the strip so many times and never seen this taco spot"". Yup!! Thanks to Yelp we were able to ball on a budget here.

We walked in and notice their menu. They had many different things to order: Taco Platter, Quesadilla, Burrito, Salad or bowl. You can pick your meat and don't worry; they have all type of meat: Steak, Chicken, Pork, Shredded Beef, Grilled Fish, and Crispy Fish. No matter what meat you get EVERYTHING is DE-LISH!

I am in LOVE with Tacos so of course I ordered the Taco Platter plate which consisted of: 3 tacos and 2 sides. I was able to make both my sides rice (Yes, I love rice as well) HAHA! 
What I really liked most was that you were able to put your on toppings on your tacos. Normal taco places that I go to in California they just do the norm: Cilantro and salsa but this place has it all baybee! Avocado, sour cream, different type of salsas, tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro...OMG!! REALLY!

My best friend ordered the bowl and she truly enjoyed it! Matter of fact the bowl could actually feed two people! NOICEEE!

They also had outdoor seating and indoor seating (Limited seating inside). During the time I came here it was 100 degrees in Vegas so seating inside or outside to me was miserable.
 
The inside has NO A/C! OMG how can the workers stand to work in that HOT environment! Anywho, my only concern was the hotness in that joint. They would definitely be 5 stars once they fix that A'C problem.

In the meantime, 4 stars for the cheap Taco spot on the Vegas Strip!

I can't even believe that this little cafeteria style taco shop has a 4 star yelp rating.
I can only assume that coming from a city so close to the Mexican border, that my Mexican food expectations are above average.  I ordered three different tacos with a side of rice and beans. Both the chicken and pork were dry and the only flavor from the steak came from the salsa I poured on it. The corn tortillas did seem fresh and they have a nice selection of salsa's to pick from but a girl cannot survive through a hangover with salsa and corn tortillas alone. 

One good thing though...just as I'd decided not to take another bite of my food and a homeless guy came up and asked if he could have it. I hope he enjoyed it.",BLN9rm7EZ5NbCdCcHq8rFQ,1,0,2,dhvIe0pwdzDXmmSPbLpvvA

The tacos are good, but I would different that they are anything particularly special.  Here are a couple of reasons why:

1) The rice here has no flavor - just salt;
2) The corn salsa here uses frozen corn - you might as well not offer the option;
3) The salsa verde here is a bit bland;
4) The meat here, regardless of which one you order here, is also a bit on the bland side.

I walked in and took a look at the Chipotle style layout of food. I honestly questioned the amount of time the food had been sitting out with the dry look of the rice, beans, and meat like it hadn't been rotated, stirred, or mixed for a couple hours. I then questioned whether I wanted to stay and take the risk of getting funky bowel movements. In Vegas fashion, I took a gamble and ordered the three taco dinner, substituted two scoops of rice instead of rice and beans. Unfortunately they did not have al pastor which had been highly reviewed . Disappointed but ordered two carnitas and a barbacoa. I typically order lengua which they had but didn't want to make that big of a bet. They also let you mix any meats which is nice. They had a lot of toppings to choose from but I went with straight up onions and cilantro with mild green salsa. All in all it was a tasty meal. Meat was a bit greasy to the point the tortillas broke. I don't mind that but I know it can be a turnoff for some. The rice while dry was actually not bad either. You can definitely get your taco fix here but just know it might not be the freshest tacos.

The tacos are amazing and cheap(only$2-3 each) I ordered three of them with a side of churros .They were cooked fresh and the flavors are incredible. The flavors are so complex and the meat marinates in a special seasoning and sauce. The chicken was my favorite but the others were delicious as well. There is a wide array of fresh salsa and homemade guacamole. To find this place you need to find the Harley Davidson sign and then walk a bit further to little Hawaii. This place rocks and is must in Vegas. The staff was incredible friendly as well.",JuU-5VI0Kl5PG4v6LAkgyg,1,1,5,V7dTm_vVBFK-JeZvx-hlrw

Many meat options, barbocoa and marinated pork were delicious! Lots of options for toppings including pico, cheese, hot sauces, and more. Great deal at taco platter was $9.95 for 3 tacos with beans and rice.",0aYDhUiCwUNlTFM3lOwS-w,0,0,4,XN79FZWrSa_WTcZY3C51oA

That doesn't even include a drink! As for the food... The tacos. The carne asada tasted closer to ground up McDonald's burgers than quality carne asada. The rice was dry and undercooked, and the beans tasted as if they were straight out of a can. They were also doing some sort of construction inside and at times I couldn't even here the person sitting next to me. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you had very low standards for a taco shop.",1t3CIrVEIXa2HSNGhedYHw,0,0,2,hmB3eFOUNMd9ZJUbdAQmMQ

Maybe it was because I arrived at 5:30pm and it wasn't busy, but had been hoping for something at least as good as a taco truck.",gZ2vJkhyJZVbWAu59x1Rww,1,0,2,3XGGaIBIRgpEvGsLqebyRg

Friendly staff
Recommend the marinated pork.
Seating outside.
Reasonable pricing considering everything in Vegas is ""$$"" and up
Music and shops surround you.",lq5aeMmu-qq9KLONt-iVoQ,0,0,4,xI_8A3eqh1YV_HmO00KTlw

The Habenero salso is HOT!!! I come to vegas 2 -3 months out of the year .... Usually here for 2 weeks at a spell.... I come here every other day! In a city where you don't always get the quality you pay for, I feel this taco shop exceeds the norm! The spicy pork is delicious , and the carnitas is moist and full of flavor. Great lunch spot when you are in a hurry.",a1OOFJr3Tp9GbU6ByEdARQ,0,0,5,f1Fo3_KSUeE6RaO2Xr4ogg

They were open late so it worked out perfectly to stop off and grab a bite to eat before heading back to the hotel. The tacos were alright and it was the end of the night so meat options were drastically reduced. 

Still overall a good place for a late night bite when other options aren't available.",8dD20WNUtBcOD2xGLa_8SA,0,0,3,44bjxyUuYv9UiuNkbiYyzQ

This place is usually one of our favorite places to eat but since last visit, prices has gone up and same as an actual sit down restaurant. They charge for extra salsa or extra anything. Whereas in a restaurant, those usually just come free. Cost of each entree is 9.50+. No substitutions allowed. This was my first Mexican food choice in Vegas but given that their prices is same as a restaurant and they want to charge extra for everything and won't substitute more rice instead of beans... It's no longer my #1 choice",YNfhV_QrKpndzZGQHR_5GA,0,0,3,sYG4zFOIPr3BceLZNNflVA
