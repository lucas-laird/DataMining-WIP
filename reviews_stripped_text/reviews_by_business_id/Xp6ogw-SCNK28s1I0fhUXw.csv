Not bad for $5 but tonight when I went,  I ordered breadsticks , similar to crazy bread, but they forgot to include sauce and the bread sticks were undercooked and doughy.

We get our food and it's pretty good...it was a little cold but that was really no big deal...anyway my girlfriend liked it so we decided we would give them another try... We wanted to have it delivered again and they already had our address...piece of cake..so again we're waiting & waiting & waiting. Ok this is getting ridiculous..they had our address already from the last time..i call them up & its broken English guy again...he starts yelling at me saying his driver couldn't find my address...WHAT?!?!? you guys were just here not too long ago..you said you already knew our address so WTF?!?!? his driver gets on the phone (also speaks very broken English) & HE starts yelling at me because I can't understand him...so finally I got pissed off and told them forget it....i ended up having Dominos...maybe you guys should hire people that can speak better English and not get mad at the customer for not understanding you or you not understanding the customer..,wtnLOataYL7kT3xaz9yccA,0,0,2,v5335OGpWHFVg3o_j6f2VQ

Not a fan of the $5 pizza at Little Caesar's because it taste like cardboard to me. So being new to Vegas this place is right next to my apartment complex and I had to try it. The pizza honestly is decent but their garlic knots are BOMB! That's really what I come here for now to be honest. They give you a sh*tload with marinara sauce for basically $3 and they're tasty. What I don't like about this place is that they are very stingy with their Parmesan cheese. They will sprinkle it on for you because they claim it's a health issue if you do it yourself and if you ask for more they want you to purchase the packets for 10cents each. 10 cents is not a big deal however I have never gone to ANY pizza place in my entire life who charged for Parmesan cheese!

This was, by far, the worst pizza I've had.  I was really hoping it would be at least as good as Little Caesers, as Big Daddy is more convieniently located.

We ordered a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  

APPEARANCE:  The pizza is quite small, as another reviewer stated. I believe it's equivalent to a Domino's medium pizza.  I also noticed the pizzas were much flatter than most others. It was hard to pull a slice out of the box.  It's common that we have to re-cut pizzas as they're usually cut in a hurry.  My pizza slicer would not cut thru this pizza.  It was like leather - my daughter has braces and was completely incapable of biting thru the crust.  She ate the stuff off the top. The pepperoni pizza had about 2.5 slices of pepperoni per slice - not enough for pepperoni in every bite.  Both pizzas were full of grease.

TASTE:  The sauce was good.  The grease made me think back to high school pizza (I graduated in '95).  I made a comment about high school pizza, and everyone else said ""no, school pizza is better.""  There was an adequate amount of cheese.

OVERALL:  Save your $5 and get pizza ANYWHERE else, seriously.  Go to Albertsons and get a frozen one to cook yourself.  Drive up Nellis and go to Little Caesers.  As convenient as this place might be,  it's just not even worth $5.",elektz6cHmiFgfXmid-xiA,2,0,1,9-ao-Pe-6uH9K-MVfvdjmw

And I don't usually like red sauce, but this one had a bite to it, not sweet at all. Not sure if this is a different sauce than what they put on regular pizzas. Got hubby a Hawaiian but he didn't eat it yet. Will definitely go back for pizza cravings.... and they do deliver! Will be trying other stuff on the menu.

Ps....I do NOT like little ceasers pizza, seems to be a common theme here in the reviews. And there is no seating to actually eat at the restaurant.",A56LwaBHeC61nwZQEP6dnA,0,0,4,NRwDN0mH8nDPGMBxg2dlFw

The wings were terrible, looked nothing like the pictures (just plain lazy that they didn't use their own food in their flyer). The Garlic Bubba Bread was just a bread stick, pretty bland, but at least that was free with the coupon from the flyer (still not worth it). 
I understand that mistakes happen, and the delivery driver either left the soda in his car, or at the store so I called back and said he forgot it. I ordered, and they advertise, Pepsi. When the driver came back, he handed me RC Cola (good, my drains needed cleaning anyway).

Well Big Daddy Pizza is not going to make it that long I promise you.  I hate to bash a new business but as you can see from the photos I posted of the chicken and pizza.........the quality is horrible.  It reminded me of cafeteria pizza.

I would like to go Maury Povich on this review and say that was a lie.  I know fresh food when I see it and I'm sure other people do to.  The pizza was super thin as you can see from the picture.

They only have two pizza's for $5.00 and that is the cheese or pepperoni. I opted for the sausage which still wasn't bad $7.20 out the door.

Big Daddy's is a teeny, hole in the wall place with a walk-up window and a park bench. From this window you can order ready-to-go pizzas, bread sticks, ribs, and other ""delicacies"" for $5. They have done some serious advertising from sign-twirlers, mailings, and they even took out a huge billboard across the road from where it is located.

The pizza is cardboard-style with chunky-like cheese. The only pretty decent thing going for it, is the sauce - very robust and flavorful. Too bad it's being put on such a cheap meal.

Overall - it's aaallll right. Obviously you are paying $5 for a pizza, so what to expect? But. I'd rather go to Little Ceaser's and get their ready-to-eat pizza AND their CRAZY BREAD.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,4,2,6Ef7ScpLHar77a83EQklgQ
