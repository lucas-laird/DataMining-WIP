Ordered the bbq ribs with soon tofu (soft tofu soup), and the hubby had seafood soon tofu (his came with a whole fried fish, so YUM!). Came with plenty of sides, delicious japchae (noodle), kimchi was good. The soup was super spicy (just how I like it!), but I still think that Mr. Tofu has the best Soon Dubu in town. 

Service was friendly, they brought the food to our table even though it was a big public food court. Prices were super reasonable-- under 9 bucks for a soup with fish combo, including sides. 

I will be happy to dine again! *fightinng!!*",KBe94sa63vywGJmsAuIKOA,2,0,4,mx4IM9GPI7X-hx7VgGZJKA

Kris, the owner, and her husband (they also own Tiffany Coffee) are a pleasure to visit with and I wish them continued success!

The food court is open everyday until 9pm!",haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q,1,5,5,DPT-YZQBfPESoyVch1wLhQ

2865026,2017-05-24,1,EN2foh9hQMXvNMtB3pMwmA,In Vegas for ICSC/RECon and did not feel like walking around in 100 degree weather and definitely too hungover to wait in lines so I ordered in from here to get my Korean/Chinese fix. Wasn't disappointed. The jjajangmyun was great but probably much better without the delivery time as the noodles had kinda clumped together a bit but expected as much with delivery. Nice packaging and presentation though. The dish was good and just as I remember a good jjajangmyun to be. Also had the mandoo which was underwhelming but decent and the chicken fried rice which is Korean style as I prefer. Good food and great portions. A little bland and they didn't deliver drinks of any kind so my rating is really 3.5 stars. Would I order again? Probably so when in town,U7TVxT2uspGmAM0Fj34cYw,1,1,4,QmnAK5mQEirADZUSnw9yKg

4019378,2014-12-27,1,EN2foh9hQMXvNMtB3pMwmA,"I found a jja jjang min, black bean noodle, place in Las Vegas. This place is located inside of Greenland korean supermarket.

I ordered jja jjang min combo with spicy seafood noodle and sweet sour pork. It was only $13 for all that food. It's good for two people to share. And it was delicious! I did take one star off because the sweet sour pork came in all different sizes. Some were huge and some were itty bitty. 

The lady who took my order was nice. We ordered two of the same combo and she personally bought the second tray to our table. What a service!

I would definitely return when I visit Las Vegas.",rYGi5DJ_54qeoWkkqB21jA,4,1,4,InFAlSZcY5PinEiOLxKgNw
4115906,2017-01-03,0,EN2foh9hQMXvNMtB3pMwmA,This place had problems originally but they changed management and operation. The food here is better then the last and it LA quality food now you have to try it. Also the new management is very nice and if your a repeat customer they will give you free stuff like dumplings and egg roll. Huge improvement will go back again.,l4TcXDUKFSVJjOlZEaMysw,0,0,5,KGCXQxLh108DNmSYTrcfRw
4178814,2014-08-06,0,EN2foh9hQMXvNMtB3pMwmA,"They are nice here.  The gan chajang is pretty darn good. I mean there's no comparison to L.A. or Korea but this place holds its own. The tang su yuk(sweet and sour) was not very good though.  It was not sweet enough, just sour which was weird to me. Still, I like this place, they have good ""service"" and give you all the right banchan(side dishes)  :-) the champong was also pretty good.  The noodles are still chewy and have some bite to them just like they are supposed to. I really get sad when they over cook my noodles at other places.",m1kO3bG4UaDoJqGamlOC-w,1,0,4,e85TxDmcw_xvUXSVi6Gm2g

Champong (spicy noodle soup) - the flavor of soup was mediocre at best. 

Tang soo yook (sweet and sour pork) - meh. 

I wasn't enjoying any of it, and was really hoping I could like this place.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,1,1,IYNgZdv5BExiFMVF0MCb7Q

5048587,2014-03-15,0,EN2foh9hQMXvNMtB3pMwmA,"Red Gate serves Korean style Chinese food in the Greenland foodcourt. 

The best deal is their combos of a noodle dish (either black bean noodle, seafood noodle soup or a 50/50 bowl of both), plus meat dish (sweet and sour pork or spicy fried chicken) as that is $11-14 and can easily feed two people. Otherwise, I think for Chinese food the prices seem high-ish but I haven't eaten much of the menu. 

So I got the black bean noodle (jjangmyeun) + fried crispy chicken combo. The noodle was decent aside from needing a tiny bit more seasoning of salt. The fried crispy chicken isn't what I was expecting, but battered and fried nuggets in a sweet and sour type sauce with onions and peppers. They give you a side of kimchee, yellow pickles, black bean paste with sweet raw onions. The portion, again, can feed two easily or one very hungry mofo. 

I think for their combos, it's not a bad spot to go to, but I don't know if I want to delve into the rest of the menu. I guess it's different since its Chinese cooked in a Korean style and is a niche I don't see anywhere else.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,1,3,aX-F65tpofBLt58YR5Apaw
