The place was clean and the service was good. My issue was it was quite warm inside. The AC may have been having issues as I heard a customer ask about it. The temp inside was definitely cooler than the heat outside but that doesn't say much since it was like 115F!! Sweet Jesus!

Two fish tacos, soup and chicken fajitas took 19 minutes to receive.  

Tacos were room temp and no Pico De Gallo or sauce. Fish was cooked nicely, it just needed to be hot.  

Tortilla Soup was completely cold and they were out of spoons.  Who sells soup without spoons?

Fajitas were hot and portion was generous.  But again no Pico De Gallo and no sauce.  

The salsa bar had no cups,lids or containers for take out. Employee did not answer when asked about it.  

Sweet tea was clear and just sweet water.  

Restaurant was very stuffy and hot and I asked to adjust the temp, employee did try but it wasn't possible so she opened a door.  Unfortunately now it was cool but six lanes of traffic and a construction site made it ridiculous.

If you'd rather have others choose your burrito/taco toppings for you this palce is for you since all of it is already determined for you. I usually get the baja burrito with steak, pretty tasty. I probably like their steak best compared to thier other popular competitors.  I also recently tried the torta with chicken, which is a new menu item.  The grilled vegetables was a nice touch and the bread was pretty good too. But I must say the bread was a bit too fluffy, if that makes any sense? Their prices are about $1.50 higher more or less than Chipotle's or Qdoba because their menu items automatically come with chips. Unlike the others which have it as an option. I really do love the salsa bar, which gives them that little edge. One more plus is they probably have the most menu options. They also help out the community by offering those Baja Fresh fundraiser nights, shows that they care about the communities they cater to. Sad to say I probably visit Baja Fresh the least probably because their food doesn't taste as fresh as the others.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,0,0,3,OdxOg5Cz_8XNoad1Q_BfyQ

I've had the tacos (fish tacos are good), the fajitas (the chicken fajitas are very good), and a few of the burritos, but my favorite menu item is the Diablo Shrimp Burrito- shrimp, black beans, rice, jack cheese and spicy sauce. I got my husband hooked on it, except he has the sauce on the side.

I was curious about the langostino lobster burrito so I got it this past weekend. It was not good; too much rice, I mean, overstuffed with rice. I don't like too much rice in my burrito.

I'm giving high marks for the following: good service, fresh food, free drink refills, clean restaurant, and your choice of salsa (sad about discontinuing the mango salsa but the pineapple salsa is a nice alternative- a bit spicy but I like the kick). I almost forgot to mention that it's reasonable. Also available is covered outdoor seating. They do large orders- Party Packs.

I tasted a churro and it was so delish but by the time the party started it was very chewy and there was no dipping sauce for the churros either.

It took a bit longer than I liked to place my order but that's the only complaint I have about the place. It's clean, the service once they get to you is fast, and it's priced right. I liked the salsa bar...the 6 pepper salsa was really good but it took a back seat to the over the top mango salsa. That stuff...is pure awesomeness in a little cup. 

I ordered a wahoo bowl, and as I was looking at the bowl I didn't see any processed or artificial crap. I saw fresh veggies, perfectly seasoned and flavorful fish, not too much rice, and the portion size was good without being excessive. That's important when you're trying to watch portion sizes and you find a place with good food.

I also appreciate the cilantro is available solo - not mixed with onions like @ Rubio's.  I do prefer the food @ rubio's but you get what you pay for calorie wise - so if it tastes better its probably worse for you.

I recently went to this baja fresh location on Ash Wednesday before going to mass down the road. I was starving and ate like a prisoner about to take my food away, yup it was that serious. I hadnt eaten really all day b/c ur supposed to fast on Ash wed and are only allowed 2 snacks and one meal but the 2 snacks cant equal the one meal - somethin like that. 

I went with the 2 blackened mahi mahi tacos (that I normally order in Hendo by the Galleria) which are normally really good. Unfortunately this was mahi mahi was so dry, blackened ( and not in a spice way but a burned way) maybe they didnt know thats what that meant?
