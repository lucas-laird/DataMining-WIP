I've been here a few times, and everytime I come in I get helped but a young lady named Andrea, really sweet girl she's always good about her costumer service and always greets me with a smile. With me coming there I've never waited any longer then 10 mins when she's working and that right there is a great thing.. 
The shakes and food overall are really good, I love the shakes and the food omg really good as well..
I will be coming back thanks",OIRsIoCptJANi2lakFOg2g,0,0,5,6fUC8AjsOGOJHdnirU-6uQ

The staff is always so kind and willing to offer suggestions. I'm a creature of habit so every time I visit i get a salmon bowl with brown rice and avocado. There are few things I love more in this world than their salmon. It's always fresh and prepared perfectly. Today i went out on a whim and decided to try the vegan chilli as well. I love places that offer meat-less alternatives because its just not a luxury you come across everywhere you go. I have to say, the chilli definitely gives the salmon a run for its money. Also, if you stop by you have to try one of their vegan cookies!! They have a few flavors but the original chocolate chip is my favorite. One of the staff members recommended it to me and I can honestly say i prefer them to normal chocolate chip cookies because theyre not as sweet.

I love that they have an outdoor seating area, although i haven't exactly utilized it yet. And i like that everything is always neat and tidy. I personally think the prices are reasonable.  At the end of the day, you get what you pay for and I don't mind spending a little more money for great quality.",6fBV8MB549fA5G1NmtRkVg,2,1,5,IfmWCAAYBculjN-CKMh9Pg

I would recommend this to my friends any day of the week. Staff was very friendly as well, definitely going to be one of my favorite spots to eat at.

It's a little pricey when it comes to building your own meal as compared to Greens & Proteins (their neighbor across the lot) but there are more options to choose from. The one thing I do like is that their sweet potato mash (huge portion) is like real sweet potato unlike at G&P it seems less condensed? If that makes sense. Their stevia bbq sauce is also delicious with the bison (Their bison portion is smaller than G&P) and elk. Haven't tried much YET, but this is definitely my new preference. One thing I would probably recommend - they probably have this option and I haven't asked yet - is to have some steamed veggies.

Now the important part... The first time I had the California Chicken Cob wrap (wrapped with cabbage to make it low/no carb). It came with a delicious side salad.  
The second time I had the source burger served on an oat bun; the bison was cooked PERFECTLY!!!!!  The turkey bacon with the avocado and cheese was great and the asparagus was a great addition.  I went with the sweet potato hash as my side; it was delicious and I personally would have like it with smaller chunks of potato and a little more onion but over all a great meal.

Described as: ""Pan Seared Wild Caught Atlantic Salmon, Asparagus and Cherry Tomatoes Over Cauliflower Mash Topped w/Balsamic Reduction and Cilantro Pesto.""

The pictures on the glossy menu look amazing. But that is where the number of good things I can say ends. The only barely edible part of the dish was the salmon, which was not the best quality, judging by taste. It should have read ""swimming"" in mashed cauliflower. Which would be okay if they had used ANY seasoning at all. It basically tasted like they boiled everything and dumped it in there. I didn't taste any cilantro or pesto. Just boiled paste and some balsamic. Sorry but yuck. 

On service: Not ""unfriendly"" staff, but is that really what you aim for when you run a business? 

I returned the dish minus the salmon after a minute and commented on how disappointing it was. ""Flavorless"" was the word I used. The girl I spoke to mentioned that they had a new cook and that she would talk to him. Not her fault obviously, but I don't think this dish was an ""oopsie.""

Protein waffle tower (One Whole Wheat Multi-Grain Protein Waffle Served w/Egg Whites or Whole Eggs, Turkey Sausage, Cheddar Cheese, Jalapeño Berry Jam, Sugar Free Syrup or Agave Nectar) - I love me some waffles, but sadly this wasn't up to par in my standards. The flavors didn't mesh well IMO. I ordered this, but only had a few bites. 

Chocolate Chip Protein Pancakes (Whole Wheat Multigrain Chocolate Chip Protein Pancakes w/Topped w/Nutella Chocolate Chips, Protein Powdered Sugar and a Side of Sugar Free Syrup) - Probably the worst thing that is good for you on the menu. Everyone finished this shared plate. 

American Muscle Bowl (100% Pure American Bison, Sweet Potato Hash, Source Veggie Mix (Broccoli Red and Green Bell Peppers, Yellow Squash and Zucchini), Topped w/Avocado and House Stevia BBQ Sauce) - This was another winner due to all the flavors that you get from this meal.

Ahi Protein Poke (Hawaiian Style Wild Caught Ahi Tuna Mixed w/Avocado, Green and Red Bell Peppers, Pineapple, Cilantro, Red Onion, Sesame Seed Oil and Sriracha Served Over House Made Agave Teriyaki Sauce) - these were def a hit w/ our group.

Salmon Salad Shooters (Fresh Cucumber Shots Topped w/Cooked Chilled Wild Caught Atlantic Salmon Tossed w/Yogurt, Tomatoes, Chopped Cucumbers, Red Onions and Lemon, Served w/a Side of Dijon Mustard and Cilantro Pesto) - yet another item that was a hit w/ our group.

Tropical Green (""Blended"" Spinach, Kale, Mango, Pineapple & Banana) - SO GOOD!
Beetphrodisac (Beet, Orange, Carrot, Lemon and Ginger) - Not my fav, but it wasn't what I ordered. 
Green House (Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon) - Refreshing

W/ so many options to choose from you could come here every day for a month & still not have the same thing. It also caters to whatever type of diet you're on.

Menu photo showed blueberries, strawberries, and bananas! After receiving my order that was obviously missing a great deal, I walked up to menu board on wall.

Everything just seemed really out of balance. I didn't really want a whole lot of beans and peppers. I paid extra for chicken which was super dried out and small. I didn't think the prices for the salads were bad at all and the portions were very big.

I ordered the Bigboy Bison with bison burger on oatmeal Greek yogurt whole wheat buns, caramelized onion, 3 egg whites or 1 egg, cheddar, romaine, tomato, and house sugar free BBQ sauce for 12.99 with a side of sweet potato hash. 

It was a real winner. I never had bison or elk and was hesitant but I would have never known the difference between bison and beef. I enjoyed the sweet potato hash and I have to say not everyone knows how to make a sweet potato taste good, but they did it just right simple but tasty. I am also happy to not see ""tofu fries"" which I am not sure how fried is healthy. 

I am looking forward to them having the calories, protein, fat, etc on their menu, I was told that is on it's way to happening soon. This did not taste healthy at all and I believe that it is, but wow how was it so good? I want to see the calorie count for proof then I am sold for sure.

So you show up here, your trainer recommended it, or you overheard some bros talking about it in the squat rack, or you just saw it leaving LVAC.  And its with good reason.  Its 1. in the same parking lot as LVAC, 2. they use minimal oil to reduce calories, and 3. protein is in the name so you know you'll be feeding those muscles for some sick gains bro.  
Ok enough being silly. 
This is a great healthy restaurant that puts greens and proteins (its healthy option, in the same shopping center competitor) to shame.  I got the turkey bowl, a delicious, surprisingly moist, turkey patty with black beans and and veggies over brown rice.  I think they must have made a deal with the devil because I can never get brown rice to rase good or turkey to be anything but a hockey puck (wait am I just a bad cook?....) It also came with avocado and a side of salsa.  Ahhh-maaaaa-zingggg! And huge too! I didn't get the calorie count but they guy said he could give me an idea of the macros on any of the items when i was trying to make my mind up (- a star because that info should totally be on the menu!) 
Which reminds me, the menu is HUGE!! I didn't know so many healthy options existed! 
My husband got the southwest chicken griller, A grilled chicken breast, lettuce, beans, avocado and cheese wrapped in a tortilla (whole wheat of course!) and grilled.  It was also delicious! 
The restaurant was very clean, they had some mellow chill electronic music and a big screen with a muted metallica concert on (thanks for the mute haha)

2016082,2016-03-04,16,WXSsJIO_uGGSxS9qC8x1gQ,"One thing I've noticed about these health food restaurants that are popping up near gyms in Vegas is how cut throat it is. I rejoiced when I first moved to Vegas and discovered Greens & Proteins off of Eastern. I loved the concept of healthy, good quality, fast casual, in the same center as my gym. Then shortly thereafter, another similar restaurant moved right down the street, instead of near a different gym and I was like, WOW that is hardcore! Reminds me of what Starbucks used to do to all the mom and pop shops to run them out of business. I wondered if both businesses would be able to survive. As of now, they are both still in business. Yesterday, I was in the area and had this place bookmarked for a long time so I finally checked it out. Low and behold, I noticed there was a Greens & Proteins in the same exact center. Not sure who was there first and who muscled their way in on the other but yeah... I think it's safe to say that the competition with this niche type of restaurant is pretty fierce. And Protein Source sure brings it! *insert arm flexing emoji here*

I am very impressed with the food they serve at The Protein Source. Dare I say I like it better than that other place because they have a more exciting menu. I like it so much, I'm going back again today to try something new. I ordered the Lean Mean Ahi Machine Bowl along with a Kale Berry Bomb salad. Both were delicious and they also got rave reviews from my health nut friend.

This location is not close to me but I do love their food. I probably will not be back again unless I happen to be in the area. I wish The Protein Source would take a chance and come out to the Henderson or Southern Highlands area so I can become a regular customer. There's plenty of other gyms/yoga studios to set up shop next to. We need good healthy food like this here! They could definitely count on my business about three times a week or more.

Update: During today's visit I learned that they have a little caveman icon on their menu to represent Paleo friendly meals. Lord help me. I'm officially in love and I'm on my knees begging now. Please open another store near me!",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,24,22,5,DMpvIqY-cyp5FVnVGd42lg

I didn't like the turkey chili because it was so strong and salty. So my husband went in and told them we didn't like it because it tasted too salty. So, the owner comes out, a tall burly guy, and instead of offering another order of food or saying something to my husband like, ""oh I'm sorry you didn't like it, we will refund your money, we don't put regular salt into our chili but we do put this or that to be an alternate for the salt"". My husband is a quiet, non complainer but he said the owner came off very rude to my husband who's been a chef and worked in the restaurant industry for about 30 years now. If anything, my husband said the owner could have been better with his manners and customer service. So I was mad about it. I called and I tried to explain with some choice words (because I was pissed by then) to one of the workers while I waited to speak to the owner on the phone. The worker hung up on me... now if you're going to hang up on me (which I was going to go inside now because I was actually in the car), I'm assuming you don't want to deal with me, then don't come out busting through the door like you're about to go gangster on me, which is what he did, he came outside before I went in and he started running his mouth (again, they need classes on how to deescalate not escalate any situations), so I ran mine. We were going back and forth and then the owner comes out like gang buster and says, ""so what's the problem here!"" Like he's all tough! I told him and he kept interrupting me and kept saying, ""didn't I refund you?!"" (he clearly doesn't know how to deescalate a situation). I told him it was all about his attitude. If you're going to refund someone at least have a good customer service attitude, instead he kept saying that there's no salt and normally they don't refund like it was such a bother to refund $10 and he acted like he was doing US a favor LOL!! 
So, when we were outside we kept asking why it was so salty, he couldn't answer and explain nicely to us if there was a substitute for the salt or whatever makes it taste salty. He kept saying maybe it's the meat, maybe the recipe is wrong blah blah blah. But we kept pushing why it was so salty, and to that he just skirted around and didn't want to deal with us anymore and said, ""I already refunded you, have a great day!"" and he walked away. Unbelievable! He couldn't and wouldn't answer a customer's question. He could have handled it waaaay better than he did. I think he was trying to intimidate us and it didn't work. They guy who came outside first also has the same attitude as his boss, absolutely no customer service and they don't know how to deescalate a situation, instead they throw more fire into it. This girl is NOT having none of that! I will make sure I spread this far and wide. I hear he is the owner of both Durango and Flamingo location, that's why he thinks he can have that kind of attitude. Bumbye you learn bruh! Here's a dictionary lesson for the owners, learn to deescalate and NOT escalate situations. Please, have a company seminar on this

deescalate[ dee-es-kuh-leyt ]
Main Entry: lessen
Parts of Speech: verb
Definition: lower, reduce
Synonyms: mitigate, dilute, erode, slacken, minimize, ease, shrink, impair, dwindle, decrease, abate, narrow, diminish, curtail, lighten, weaken, decline, cut, clip, taper, abridge, attenuate, degrade, crop, downsize, soft-pedal, drain, contract, amputate, truncate, close, moderate, thin, cut back, taper off, minify, de-escalate, become smaller, die down, grow less, roll back, slack up, slow down, take the bite out, take the edge off, take the sting out, wind down

de-escalate
[dee-es-kuh-leyt]
verb (used with or without object), de-es·ca·lat·ed, de-es·ca·lat·ing.
to DECREASE in intensity, magnitude, etc.

Update*** So the owner wants to reply and says I used abusive and intimidating behavior. What a joke! I'm just about 5 feet tall, but they wanted to come out of their establishment and try to intimidate us. They came off that way to us, so of course they got an ear full of attitude and language. The owner is about 6 ft tall and looks like he's on steroids, probably accounts for his gangster mentality and behavior and his employees behave the same.

Update*** I noticed the owner changed the original comment to my review, doesn't matter to me. This review will probably stay right here. So, who was being racist? Certainly not us Lol!

I stood in front of the register ready to order but the two employees in the front were dealing with something or organizing orders (totally understandable, things get out of hand and you gotta fix it up) but when you see someone waiting in line, acknowledge them. ""Hi, I'll be right with you"" ""hey, just one moment and I'll take your order"". Simple as that. I get customer service can be a pain at times but you signed up for it when you chose to work at this establishment. I won't rip them apart about how long it took to get the food and drink, it was a lunch rush but customer service is what makes or breaks your business. Very poor service.

Went with a turkey burger with a side of sweet potatoes. Granted, I can make the exact same thing at home for a lot less than $12 (after tax/15% gratuity) but sometimes, it's nice to have someone else cook for you. 

The turkey burger was moist, the bun was soft and fresh. The sweet potatoes actually had a little char on them that would make a lot of people would say (they were burned) but I actually thought it added a nice touch to them. 

It came with a little sauce blend that was tasty but I just used ketchup as that is what I prefer. 

The guy behind me ordered this Protein waffle that had like egg and turkey in it. So it looked like a waffle burger. I didn't see it on the menu but I know what I'll be getting next time!

This place is located very close to an lvac so for me when i come here after a workout, I'm on a time limit to eat my protein within 45mins. If i factor in going to the sauna after my workout and then getting ready to leave, get here to order, and then wait, it takes too long. Nobody likes a hip, s l o w , restaurant. 

Doesn't matter if you get for here or to go. It will take you a good long while; and on top of that if there are maybe 2 people ahead of you, good luck it adds even more time.

Oh and to make matters worse, this makes people hangrier. Just sayin

They serve breakfast, bowls, salads, chili, wraps, burgers and drinks, juice, protein shakes and also have a kids menu. Each item was pictured and described in great detail. 

There was one customer eating when we came in and five employees at the counter. Music was playing that was exceptionally loud. Since we had seen the menu before hand, we knew what we wanted to order. The employee who took our order asked if we wanted water while we waited and gave us 2 cups. I thought that was nice. Our order was ready about 10 minutes later. 

We ordered the BBQ chicken stacks which were $9.49 for four.  The menu description was fresh cucumber shots toppped with chilled and chopped chicken breast, black bean salsa and Stevia barbecue sauce. There was more cucumber than chicken and barely any black bean salsa. The Stevia barbecue sauce was great.

We also ordered the skinny salmon bowl which was described as pan seared Atlantic salmon, asparagus and cherry tomatoes served over cauliflower mash topped with balsamic reduction and cilantro pesto $11.99. The cauliflower mash was runny and flavorless. Two halved cherry tomatoes had sunk in the cauliflower mash. The salmon  was also flavorless and had hard pieces of something in it. I'm not sure if it was bones but it was not edible.

When I questioned someone about this he basically told me he didn't know where the eggplant was and this is the way they always make it. When I asked if the menu was wrong he said, 'I guess' and said he would talk to his boss (this was after trying to tell me the hummus was the eggplant). I'm not sure if the employees are uninformed or if the management didn't care, but no one else came out to talk to me about this issue.

No upcharge for 6 egg whites is a crazy good value (I hope they have the appropriate food costs to stay afloat).  The steak was cooked properly and the BBQ sauce was delicious.

2457310,2016-11-14,0,WXSsJIO_uGGSxS9qC8x1gQ,"I am in LOVE! For there to be a restaurant (not a meal prep place, but an actual restaurant) that appeals to the health & fitness folks, is awesome! What makes it even better, is that their menu has SO much AND it caters to: Vegetarians, Gluten Free folks, body builders, and those on the Paleo diet. And here is why I give it 5 stars: THEY SERVE BREAKFAST ALL DAY! OH, today is also Sunday. Most restaurants close around 6 or 7pm on Sundays. THEY CLOSE AT 10PM!!!! 

This place is an actual restaurant, kind of like fast food. You don't get waited on but they do serve you your meal. I am used to establishments similar to this except the establishments are meal-prep shops. Where they have a weekly menu which changes every week. The Protein Source is not a meal-prepping establishment, though you could very well order everything and refrigerate for the week :) One other thing, because I'm used to Meal Prep places with body builders and perfectly shaped women who just got out of the gym there, I was a little nervous walking into The Protein Source. But it was quite welcoming! 

 MY ONLY WISH is that they carried pork bacon and not just turkey bacon, and that they include high fatty meals for those of us on a Ketogenic Diet (low-carb high-fat, moderate protein diet). Or, that they include more lower carb sides. Oh I have so many recipe ideas for the owners, they WILL be getting an email from me on a few Keto dishes to consider LOL. See, on a Keto diet too much protein = sugar spike in the blood. Therefore, those of us on a Keto (which is kinda similar to Paleo) eat 80% fat. So, having pork bacon (preferably nitrite/nitrate free & uncured) would up our fats without getting too much protein.

However, I really appreciate their counts on the menu. Sadly for me, most of their Starch sides have way too many carbs for one day for me. But there are at least 2 options that were low in Carbs. AND you can create your own dish too! 

After reviewing the menu for something close to Ketogenic, I ordered the Skinny Salmon dish. It had salmon, asparagus, mashed cauliflower, and a cilantro pesto (I think). What I loved was their side of mashed cauliflower. The texture was soooooo smooth! I personally don't like Cauliflower & force myself to eat it (and I usually sautee it in grass fed butter/coconut oil with other veggies). Their mashed cauli did not taste like Cauliflower AT ALL! The salmon was perfectly cooked. And the Asparagus! Let me tell you....that was cooked PERFECTLY! It had a crunch to it but it was still tender! It was not overly cooked and it was not undercooked. It's as if they grilled the asparagus only I saw no grill marks. It was just perfect! The presentation of my meal was also beautiful! The ambience is casual but you feel like you're being served fancy gourmet food because of their unique pairings, recipes, and presentation. I also loved the fact that they had NO SODA! They had a Vitamin Water fountain, with some of those bevs being sugar-free. They also had 2 ""tubs"" of freshly brewed organic tea: Black Tea & Lemongrass Tea, both unsweetened. 

I haven't even mentioned their juice drinks, protein shakes, and their protein/low-sugar desserts!!! 

But honestly, do yourself a favor & take a look at the menu. They even have BISON!!! AAAAAND....their dishes are reasonably priced! The most expensive dish I think is $14. Their menu has food that my kids would absolutely love AND my not-so-healthy eating-husband would ACTUALLY like! Their menu has SO much to offer! I am a new transplant to Las Vegas from California and this place is literally down the street from where I live....1 minute by car, 9 mins on foot.

Their menu was impressive, and so I settled in on the Hawaii.

It did have 23g of protein and a whopping 69g of carbs.  It would have been a great post-workout shake...but...uh...I hadn't worked out.  LOL.  Good thing it was gluten-free...uh...I guess.

Upon arrival we were handed part of our order and part of another persons. 

We got home and realized this, and then the phone rang. They had called us to ask us to come back, but they also asked that we bring the dish that wasn't ours. Which I thought was odd but we did as they asked. 

Long story short they ended up giving the order we brought back to the customer who actually ordered it. GROSS.

Any ways- this was almost two months ago. So today we decided to give it another shot. 

This time my husband called ahead to place our order and asked if the chili had beans. He dislikes them. The woman on the phone confirmed that there were no beans. She actually put him on hold to confirm with the chef.  We also ordered the signature smoothie and a breakfast sandwich.

So this is how our second time went:
We paid $10 for chili WITH beans. We were going to bring it back but i have better things to do than run around town because you guys can't get your orders straight. 
The sandwich could've been better. It just wasn't good.
And the smoothie was really good. 

I decided to check Yelp out to see if we were the only ones experiencing this... Turns out we aren't- but what's even more unfortunate it the managements response to their customers. So rude and condescending. Shame on you!

It goes to the restaurant and then they tell me that the order is done through a third party and that I have to call the third party for the missing food. They are the ones that prepare the food and didn't put it in the bags that were picked up by the driver. Why do I need to call the third party?!?!?! Then I inform them that the only number in the email is their restaurant number. They tell me to google the number for the third party! Keep in mind the only thing I know about this third party is that it's a woman in a pink shirt who came to my flat to ring the doorbell. The rest I don't know. I don't have an email about this third party and the App I ordered from is called ""The Protein Source""!!!! How is that NOT THEIR APP?!?!  

Then the guy on the phone calls me ""hey Lady"" what kind of customer service when I am a paying customer who has not received what she has paid for in the first place. He then tries to give me the logistics of ins and out of their contract with the third party?!! How is that helpful! Just keep passing the buck and NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!

You can order and sit down or do to-go if you wanted to. I usually just dine in. They also have an outside area to dine at; it'll be nice in the spring time to eat out there. They also take time to cook your food though, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes before your food comes out.

But, the food isn't the reason for the meh rating. It's that there's some weirdness about this place. 

1. There's a sign on the door which leads out to their beautiful, shaded patio with ceiling fans that says ""Please do not sit on patio"". No explanation as to why. Why can't I enjoy the beautiful weather outside? Especially since you are running a ceiling fan out there.
2. The music they play is horrible house type music you would hear in a dance club. It is way too loud and gave me a horrible headache.
3. The cashier was completely uninterested in smiling, being welcoming or doing anything but the bare minimum the job requires. When I asked about nutrition info, she said when her partner came back he'd be able to estimate it for me. No one followed up, and I saw the someone return.
4. When I ordered my salad I asked if they had wi-fi. Ms. Apathetic said yes. I tried to connect when I sat down and of course I needed a password, which I had to ask her for. What the heck? Why wouldn't you just tell someone that asked about wifi what the password is? BTW it is healthy2eat in case you need it too.

I left feeling like because I am not ripped and ""in shape"" she felt like I had no business being here. I think the delish food alone won't help this place survive. Time will tell I guess.",ByYHOTBYGKWK06lJoHzy_w,2,1,2,h7djjUHWrQ_oT3NFfqHQAA

They messed up both me and my boyfriend's to-go order last night but this is the first time it's ever happened so I wasn't upset. Also we both agreed that the food was too tasty to be mad.

I always order the Mediterranean Quinoa... so delicious! I've also had the Western Avocado Salad (minus the cheese) but this was meh at best. Last night I ordered the California Cobb wrap (also without cheese) and in a cabbage wrap. While I was bummed because the eggs were completely missing and it was hard to eat because it kept falling apart, it was still very good. I was actually very surprised at how much flavor it had with and without the dressing included on the side. I loved it and will be ordering it again (please don't forget my eggs next time!). My boyfriend had the Steak Lovers Bowl and although he asked for jasmine rice and got brown rice instead, he also said it was super delicious. Eh, we were still pretty hungry after but we did just finish a Pilates workout.

Additionally, I love the people that work there. They're really smiley and very helpful. I always appreciate them!

The downside for me is the price. The Mediterranean Quinoa always seems great to me because if I'm under $10 for lunch, I'm happy... and it's well under that. In fact, all their salads are reasonably priced unless you add a protein, which I never do. But between two of us last night, we nearly spent $30. And that's just entrees, we didn't order any drinks. That's a problem because that's the price you'd spend for 2 entrees at a nice sit down place. I know they use quality ingredients but The Protein Source is more of an after-gym-healthy-bite-to-eat spot and I think some things should be less expensive. If they were, I would eat here more often than I already do. I usually meal prep my own protein, carb, and green and if they lowered the prices a bit, I'd do build-your-owns here pretty often. Though that's my gripe, I will say that they have made positive changes to their menu recently. Being a healthy spot, I was shocked they didn't have nutritional information posted. Their menu now has this info which is great!

The last time we went we ordered online, and went to pick it up. The boy up front (although nice) seemed clueless when we said we were there for our order. I also asked for extra sauce which I did too notate on the order in the comments. Well, we ended up waiting 20 extra minutes and our food had already been ready, just sitting there. The only reason we got our food then was because we were so impatient that we asked. Boy up front seemed confused and gave us the order per our command to check (the bag was right next to him). Also, my extra sauce was definitely not in there. The vibe was not great as customers seemed angry with the long wait times. This experience does not make us want to come back, but we also love the food. Possibly plan on waiting extra for your food if you are getting it to go. 

Update: Tried to go back to the other location and my kale was forgotten in my build your own meal. My boyfriend had to sit and wait again for a to go order.

Including this place. I ordered the ahi bowl and it was really good!! Very flavorful. And being from Hawaii nothing will compare to my hometown but I will say after my standard ""sniff test"", ""pick at it test"", and ""sniff it one more time test"" (c'mon we are dealing with seared fish in the desert people, better safe than sorry and ya know you all do the sniff test to don't even act like you don't!) I felt safe eating it haha! The sauce that comes with it is delicious, and I am anxious to try the bison burger next. Some people around me were having wraps and they looked really good as well. I had to knock of a star though because of the price...meh...a bit expensive. BUT hey so are cancer treatments so better to spend more on healthy foods than on medical bills right?

4667399,2015-05-20,0,WXSsJIO_uGGSxS9qC8x1gQ,"Love this place everytime im here. Owner is super friendly and almost always there. I've had the salmonyaki wrap twice and it's great. The Big Boy Bison bowl was tasty as well and actually being a big boy it did fill me up well, the meats used here taste very high quality. Most recently had the elk hunter and was happy with that as well very similiar to the Big boy Bison bowl just a change in meat. The source protein pancakes were awesome all around. My favorite has to be the Acai bowl though. I never was the type to get anything like that but was just talking to the owner (big Brazilian guy super friendly but can't remember his name) and was feeling in the dumps after a workout and he suggested it and made it himself and it was amazing. Super light and fluffy almost whipped consistency but also still solid and not whipped at the same time, and the perfect blend of sweet and natural no processed or artificial blends and nicely matched with the shredded coconut. I got it again since but the way he makes it is literally one of a kind I'd highly recommend asking him to make you one if the chance presents itself. Being a unhappy regular at greens and proteins I was happy when TPS opened and even had a small discussion with the owner about how I felt about greens and proteins and we got into a pretty long discussion about the difference between someone's idea of healthy and healthy, a meal you see as healthy and really giving your body nutrition and he really nailed it on the head. And that to me is the big difference between the two (also the fact that I spend $50 and leave hungry at G&P and I could spend the same at TPS and feel full for a few hours-for two people) Prices are very similar to other health food places but the portions and the flavors are really the big difference here $14 will get you a big bowl of veggies sweet potatoe mash and high quality elk or bison that you probably won't be able to finish without a massive appetite and $9 will get you a tasty wrap or breakfast plate. Speaking of, breakfast all day! 
Another thing I like is the music, it's a massive flashback of fun and good electronic music. 
And a huge thing for me is that this place DOES NOT have a soda machine. Instead you can fill your drinks will vitamin water ONE choice of coke zero or diet coke can't remember or powerade. Now that to me is big, how can you be eating at a ""health"" food restaurant that servers soda? 
Protein source is very well connected with their customers and feedback and you can tell just by the menu. 
Side note the low calorie low sugar sides and sauces served here are AMAZING the stevia bbq sauce is by far my favorite. 
All in all 5 stars and everytime I come in I see more and more people becoming regulars. Way better than G&P more passion and flavor go into every dish and more of the actual food too.",5LU8ejCPg88auLUHatSz_w,0,0,5,IKxwztw06OBcEfrkrUGAog

Energy Cakes:  Simply fluffy and delicious. Great portion size and they're topped with wonderful fresh fruit and shredded coconut.  The side of agave nectar adds just the right amount of sweetness, but to be honest you almost don't need it.  

American Muscle Bowl: DELICIOUS AND FILLING! Ground Bison, Sweet Potatoes, Avocado, Zucchini, Broccoli with a side of Stevia BBQ sauce.  Honestly, it didn't need the sauce.  The meat was so full of flavor and juicy!  I love this dish because you have everything you need: Healthy Fats, Fiber, Cruciferous Greens and Protein.

Can't wait to go back and try one of those burgers.

My only little bugaboo(which I didn't factor into my rating) was that they don't have whole milk for the coffee.  I know they're trying to be healthy with skim milk, but whole milk is much healthier for you.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,3,2,4,bFg7x0UOqQNt68azb29bzw

I saw pictures on the door for the protein shakes so I was happy to give them a try. I walked in and was immediately pleased yet a bit overwhelmed by the menu on the wall. I read and looked and tried very hard to find the list of protein shakes , they were not on that menu on the wall.I had to yell out to the girl behind the counter. She seemed not at all pleased that I was there and didn't know what to do. She was just unfriendly and looked miserable at her job. I was at the S. Durango location at approximately 1:30 pm.  I asked her if they had protein shakes and she said yes they are on the menu then she turned away. I said hey I'm sorry , this is my first time. I read the large menu again and still could not find the shakes. A customer then showed me the printed laminate menu which did have the shakes listed. Ok, so I chose the Hawaiian. I then had to ask the girl , do you accept cash or do I have to swipe my card on the iPad . She said they accepted cash and then I ask, So do I just order here on the iPad , she again seemed like I was a terrible interruption to her day. I tried to press the screen on the iPad to order but could not seem to figure it out. Nothing came up , the screen did nt provide a menu. I tried and tried and the other people just stared at me . I was so uncomfortable and felt so awkward because I had no direction of how to even order a protein shake and I couldn't even get a human to help me. So ridiculous that employees are standing 2 feet in front of you and can't help. Honestly , I said it was my first time in , well I guess it's my last time too. It would be helpful to be kind to new customers and try to assist if they look like they might be struggling to figure out your system. Great way to alienate people.

5349646,2014-10-27,0,WXSsJIO_uGGSxS9qC8x1gQ,"Long story short: tasty, clean, healthy food. Nice portions for a balanced meal. 

Some background:  I was here on business and staying at the Hampton Inn. I travel a lot for work and eating out every night gets old. I try to find healthy places to eat. 

They make food the way I would make at home, simple ingredients, lighty seasoned. Portions were just right and prices were reasonable for the quality and ingredients. 

Lunch: ahi tuna bowl, not just a few pieces, but the entire filet seared just right and sliced. I subed in quinoa instead of the veg mix. It comes with olive oil/soy dressing on the side. Next time I would like a cap so I can mix the dressing together before putting it on, it was separated and hard to mix. Tasted great and made me feel great afterwards! I was full but not sluggish. I would order again.

Dinner: Elk burger, it was pretty good. I had never eaten elk before, it is a little dry for my taste, idk if thats the meat or it's cooked to long? The mustard spread and bbq that comes with is nice. Sweet potato hash with shallots and kale, seasonings was also tasty. Again, clean, tasty meal. I think I would try something else before ordering this again. Bison burger next... 

I also had the antioxidant juice: beets, carrots, ginger, apple, kale, spinach. Sweet, they keep the fibers in.

Since they're new and feedback is always nice, sitting under the red tent outside during lunch hurt my eyes.. it kind of makes you squint the whole time. Just sit inside if it bugs you too. Overall, I'll eat here again. They just opened a few weeks ago. So far so good. Hopefully they can keep the reasonable prices and friendly service. Owner is really nice, I overheard conversations and it sounds like he knows his stuff so he'd probably give you some great free workout/eating right advice.

So I went in the next day after the gym and instead of owning up to his word like he said on the phone he said I have to ask "" the cook "" not manager if he could comp the meal keep in my mind I was placing another order for something else so I was still buying something regardless . Employee comes out and says the cook will make you something else if you can bring the food back in free of charge ! At that point I'm like so you want me to bring something back in which if you said that over the phone I would've gladly brought it back since I don't like seafood like that and he said yea if you can.

It certainly helps that they're both located next to LVAC, too:  plenty of people who want healthy eats before or after their workouts are usually circling the area.

I'm a fan of both places.  Definitely catering to those trying to eat clean and stay lean, Protein Source offers breakfast, salads, raw juices, protein shakes, bowls (chicken, ahi, elk, bison, salmon, steak, turkey), chili (vegan choice, too), burgers (the same protein choices as the bowls plus a veggie burger), wraps, as well as illy coffee. 

I like the Build Your Own Meal, where you pick your protein, carb, and green, plus a house made dressing.  My go-to is the lean ground turkey with brown rice and broccoli since I usually don't make turkey for myself at home.  

The staff is always friendly and the place is spotless.

Portions are good and I'm always full when I'm done. The fresh salsa is awesome when dumped over a bowl of ANY PROTEIN, mixed veggies and some avocado. The best $12-$14 spent when I want healthy food!!

Elk (deer family) and Bison (slightly sweeter and richer than beef) meat?? I KNOW -- I wasn't so sure about these options at first, but after some research I learned that they both have less fat and more protein than beef - and both are grass-fed and hormone-free.

Be sure to get the PERKA app for their loyalty program!!

That's the end of my relevant review for this place - the following is something I feel I must put out there as a fellow small business owner. 

YELP is truly great and I use it to find everything from Auto Services to Dentists. It's also some of the most important marketing for a small biz and the power is all within the hands of the people -- as it should be. Pretty win-win!! But when ""the people"" use their power for ego-driven purposes and put unfair and permanent marks (the star-rating) against a company, it slowly diminishes the value that is the Yelp system.

It amazes me when someone gives 2 or 3 stars and then goes on and on about how ""Delish"" the food was. It's misleading and skews the overall rating when you give a low rating because of some princess-like, emotional response to things like a sign and the music being played. Pay attention to the energy you bring -- I've been here at least 15 times and have had several different people wait on me and NONE of them have ever had attitude -- it's only 1-2 minutes of face-time with them (even if you dine-in) and you make it sound like they chose YOU specifically to be rude to, or that you're reviewing some fancy dine-in restaurant where you're also paying for the dining experience. That's NOT THIS PLACE. I assure you, most of the $'s you're paying here is going into the food and food prep.

And that's MY emotional response to that!",7OYQhMvldzCRCxdStv8YJw,2,2,5,QVLJpgcgVeV9XrHY7cut5A

But, it was a good burger and the juice was tasty and healthy.  Expensive, at $23 for the burger and drink.  The people were nice.",VnwAkLCq_Xx2YlJck3AxTg,1,1,4,GcDrc5XAbEcdMB0wb9NWQg

Their portions are good enough even for me (I do like to eat :P) and everything they do is SUPER HEALTHY! My personal favorite is the ""Bottoms up brown chicken"" and their protein drinks are very delicious too. Highly recommended!!!",sjz3a4F9XyhhYHemhBqtzA,1,1,5,WCGrJMbiLX54jHB6-NQ2ew

Ordered the turkey cabbage wraps. Ordered to go. In the instructions I asked for NO cheese and NO rice. As soon as I picked it up all I saw was rice. Took the cabbage wraps off so I could just eat the meat and it was 80% rice and 20% meat. And that's a generous estimate. To top it off there were a few shreds of cheese (probably 6) which makes me think me they had the cheese on it and someone picked it off, and that alone kind of worries me. Really wanted this to be my go to place for healthy customizable eats, but I better keep looking.",P1pv4IKC8MTGvH3H--xgtA,0,0,1,gGKyoq5Auie8FNJlyDCE6w

The Ahi bowl is my favorite and I usually get a sugar free protein brownie for dessert. The brownie really satisfies my sweet tooth! 

Bottom line, you won't be disappointed here:)",vDzRZmPrmsX2pEGEyynskQ,1,0,5,1D9eWJy5qpRDSBObx414bA

5978912,2017-06-01,0,WXSsJIO_uGGSxS9qC8x1gQ,"I stopped in tonight after my workout to check this place out. I normally go to Greens and Proteins but wanted something different. I ordered the berry filet wrap, and I was so excited to eat a delicious, healthy meal. I immediately noticed that the salad came with a cup of something. A quick fork dip confirmed that it was oil. I thought that was a little weird. One bite of the salad told me that it was supposed to be some sort of salad dressing but was really comprised of about 99% oil. Aaaaand...my salad was floating in it. Sigh...I begrudgingly ate the oily salad and then moved onto the wrap. When I picked it up, I noticed the bottom of the wrap was soaked in the same oil (see pic). The greens that were inside the wrap had also been drenched in the oil. Awesome...so much for a healthy meal. Come on, Protein Source, people come here expecting to get a healthy meal. All of that added (completely unnecessary and over the top) oil has just negated all the hard work I put in at the gym. If I hadn't just forked out over $12 for that dinner, I would have walked away.",u5r53zerLzYfDymhtmZlUA,0,0,2,Ot9fIR7L1AMGp5DY4tHoaw
