One word...filthy! Trash and dried up soda near the fountains. Not very good service either. Chicken was dry. I counted 4 people come in from the drive thru to complain about missing items. I had to wait just to place my order. The staff looked lost and I overheard (what I presume to be the Supervisor) yell at the staff to just give them what they want to make them happy.

I wanted to know if everything shown in the picture was part of the meal. His response was that it would be a waste of space on the picture if it was not. OK, we let that slide. After placing our order we were told that the debit machine was down and showed us that the keys did not work with very exaggerated movements. I told him he was very rude and should brush up on his customer service skills.  After visiting the bank next door to get cash, (and paying a $3.00 service charge to withdraw the money) we returned and decided to speak with the manager. Guess what?? Debit worked at the adjoining cash register!! The young man was just not willing to let us know that!  The manager apologized and gave us a cake, but I am not impressed that such a rude young person was allowed to serve (and I use that word very loosely) customers and represent the company at the counter.

When she approached us about an issue regarding our large order; they were low on biscuits, she did not properly relay the information that her Manager suggested. She told us that we'd get 4 biscuits and can give us a pot-pie. We okay'd it. But when we received our order, we just received the pot pie. We brought the order back to the cashier's attention, who was paying more attention to her phone and directed us to the Manager. So it turned out that the Manager actually meant we can wait for more to be cooked or take the pot-pie instead, since she had just gave away the last four biscuits to her drive-through order. We told the Manager that was not what was mentioned, but we'll wait for a for a new batch to be cooked. Gotta love that facial reaction of a teenage-newbie in the work area...she could care less. The Manager was polite enough to place our packed order under the warmers until the biscuits were ready.

I stopped in for a few dinners to go to go to the Spring Mountain Ranch theater.
When we got to the theater we discovered....
no dipping sauce and no butter in the package.
I ordered the Georgia Gold but with one original and one krispy. Both were in our box with the 
    hot and spicy rather than our ordered choice.  This chicken was so dry and horrible we would
    not eat it, and they put the biscuit in the same box which soaked up the terrible sauce.
The only thing we had from KFC for dinner was the slaw....the usual store made stuff.
Luckily the theater had food trucks.

NEVER AGAIN this place....but if YOU go be sure to have them open up the order and YOU check everything is correct.  This is not our first time here with a problem, but it will be the last. 

The Eniglish spoken by the order taker was mainly nodding yes to what I wanted, and then 
doing it the way she wanted since she did not want to ask me questions.  NEVER put this
kind of person on the front  line in a takeout place. Your order will always come out wrong.

The hot and spicy (a newish item) is terrible.  To say it was like shoe leather is a compliment.
So dry and tough you could not even get one bite.  Tossed it away.  The burros at the park turned up their noses at this junk.  (just kidding).",hhjgNqVigmO02kA2tqxV8A,1,0,1,w9d9qUI6AYzLUbMWp8WVfQ

First, they were absolutely tiny. Nothing like the picture on the menu. Second, they were so thin that they were more like chicken fries than tenders. Third, they had been sitting so long that they had permanent bumps on the backside from whatever they had been left on. Third, they were like jerky. So chewy and dried-out that our dog wouldn't even eat them - and I've seen him pork down his own crap like it was Sevruga caviar. 

Look, I get that it's KFC. I'm not expecting world-class cuisine. But I do expect that my $7 chicken tenders will at least be edible. Shame on you, KFC.",ES0OyZ735P0y8lIQi6R8IQ,0,0,1,8LZTy7tPsYw6jKm3WDah9w

I don't know why I never learn, but this location either has the worst systems in place, or the worst manager of those systems in place.  

I pretty much drive-thru almost every time but I'll bet it is 80% of the time that something is either wrong or I've asked for something and it's missing.  It doesn't matter what I order - something is missing and that could be a spoon for the mashed potatoes, it could be straws, butter, honey, napkins, a food item...etc. I will go a couple of months before I visit again because I know they're going to jack it up and then I'll get the urge and sure enough, they DO jack it up!

That is just hitting below the belt. Sure, the chicken tenders were some of the best I've had from KFC in a long time. They were moist and tender on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside. The biscuit they gave me was like any other biscuit. It was soft and a little flakey with a salty finish. I have always liked the mashed potatoes and gravy from KFC. Sure, the gravy has gotten pretty thin in the last few years but it still has good flavor. And instant mashed potatoes have such a smooth consistency. Its just too bad that all I got this time was a half a cup. For $5 I guess I can't expect too much from this meal.

Sooo I went through the drive through and the lady on the speaker too her sweet time asking what I would like. I asked about a few things and decided on a mixed 10 piece bucket thing.

OF COURSE they were a few short of what I wanted so she offered more breasts to which I accepted. She gave me my total, which was not the same as she had quoted earlier and I proceeded to the window. A different lady then gave me ANTOHER more expensive total and I asked why? ""Because you added more breasts"" I rebutted that the order taker offered since they were out and the cashier shook her head and reassured me I would need to pay the upcharge.

Don't offer something because you ran out of an item then expect the customer to pay. And 3 different totals is no bueno!

I asked for the smokey bbq and the cashier said that was not available for this price. Closest he could do was an 8 piece bucket of smokey bbq for $17.99. WHAT!!

I watched hime go in the back room and put some chicken in a container and squirt bbq sauce all over it, then top it with a few paper thin pickle slices.
