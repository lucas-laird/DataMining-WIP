I first fell in love with Greek Delights through their food truck at the food festival. I can't get enough of their Spartan Fries, they are a MUST TRY. If you like a little spice you HAVE TO try the Hades Pita. The meats are so tender. The Greek lemon soup hits the spot on a cold day. If you're looking for an appetizer, I loved the spanakopita. The menu is so diverse and has more options than any Greek restaurant I've been to. My daughter loves their Greek yogurt bar. It has all the fixings! The portions and the food never disappoint. The ambience is chill, clean, and comfortable. The staff are friendly with great customer service!",VscgHsOG8VRww286GwXtpw,1,0,5,O1Ny0hIfpk5pFMedW7PvuA

The fries are like McDonald's fries, but a nice serving. The owner/manager (?) was amazing. Upgraded my fries for free and also gave us a free drink. Very nice man. The 2.5 is mostly bc of him. Overall the place has great vibes.  I don't know.

1760585,2018-03-24,0,1VQmZoUwNbNik7EQs_EHeQ,"Food and service were on point for us! Hubby has been eagerly awaiting our first visit & he was already planning a return by the time we left.

Sweet Greek lady greeted us & confirmed that our orders of the Classic Gyro and the Chicken Souvlaki Plate were the most popular. We could see why when our food arrived--the gyro was a warm pita generously filled with the rotisserie lamb and beef mixture, laced with their tasty tzatziki sauce, a bit of red onion and fresh tomato. My souvlaki, 2 long skewers of tender grilled chicken breast, were laid on a bed of delicious Greek-style hot rice which was sprinkled lightly with crumbled feta. My side was a green salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, feta, all tossed in a light olive oil and lemon dressing with select herbs--refreshing. We stopped talking and just started sharing and enjoying our lunches.

The nice lady at the counter came to see how we were doing and also stopped by other diners to check on them, too. We were the first in, yet wanted to be the last out. So hubby went back to counter and ordered baklava for dessert. He knew it was best to order two of the larger than usual diamonds of light phyllo, with a super scrumptious filling. They were not overly sweet, like some we've had, but were done with a delicate touch and made today.

Yes, we are going back, sooner than later. Maybe next time we will try their outdoor seating, although the pretty azure tabletops inside made it feel like we were somewhere seaside. We liked this place!",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,3,5,o70RGwv6psR5IV1vxM5MqQ
1867085,2018-06-09,0,1VQmZoUwNbNik7EQs_EHeQ,"I suggest trying the ""Flaming Cheese"" which is a Greek version of Queso Fondido (melted cheese. The tzatziki is the best yet. And of course the spartan fries. And do not forget the Baklava! This restraint is clearly family own, and maintains a mom and pop cliche which is awesome considering our corporate dominated city.

Altho the menu has plenty authentic Greek items...I of course ordered my Greek Salad.  Crisp and fresh.  Absolutely loved the freshly made dressing.

3285303,2018-06-02,0,1VQmZoUwNbNik7EQs_EHeQ,I love this place. I've eaten at a lot of Greek restaurants around town and this is one of my favorites. They have the avgolemeno that I love. Not all places carry this soup. Tom took my order and bought out my food. He was very patient and helpful. His service alone makes me want to return. I had the gyro plate. It was tasty. They give you a lot of food. Too much to eat in one sitting. I like that I had enough to eat later. My only negative is I felt the rice had a very strong lemon favor. I will definitely be back here again.,Bj3neXYOGRUqGeqhUWwm6g,0,0,5,pMhQjGE15g4PL0jc61dAYA

But other than that, so disappointed!
I really wanted to LOVE this place but...we were terribly disappointed! The potatoes we're grossly undercooked (raw), the rice was bland, the feta was more like cottage cheese than feta. The pita bread was good. But the thing that really got me was their Spanikopita. Horrible! No layers, soggy, and no flavor!  There's no way that this is home made! And they charged us $6 for a little 3x3 piece. I always judge a Greek restaurant by their Spanikopita and the feta they use.

The bed of rice with the Feta was delicious. 2 skewers of the most moist and delicious chicken with awesome grilled vegetables on top of the rice. Their tzatziki sauce was also so yummy! You do wait a minute for your food if you take it to go, like we do. But its just like ordering at any other restaurant if you were to order ""curbside"". Its well worth the wait for delicious, fresh food! We will definitely be back! We love finding awesome neighborhood restaurants, and we love that its family owned and authentic.

The fries were burnt and gross and literally had no one or two pieces of feta on them. The first time they were fresh and covered with cheese. Sadly this may make it so we don't return

We did try Greek Delights about a month ago because it was close if you are home. All I can say is that I don't have any intention of going back the owner said the hummus was made on site overall it was pretty disgusting I also had a cup of the lemon and rice chicken soup which I love that also was not so great I had trouble finding a few pieces of chicken in the soup and had more of a sour flavor than the taste of lemon. We both had shish kabobs the chicken was tough vegetables few. Frankly I don't see this restaurant lasting very long,DxQQUd-gbiMCzYznptFjog,1,0,1,0sJx3XT2ufRTOILppCYekA

Anyways let's continue.... i got a gyro sandwich gyros were so long and dry all i could taste was Lemon juice from concentrate ... the Tzatziki sauce was  made with cucumber peels not cucumber but the peels.... DISGUSTING... it was yogurt with oregano.. no salt nothing Sad :( ... the Lady didnt know anything about the food no knowledge at all... As i walked in she had her finger inside her ear   then it was the nose then she had to scratch her hair too .  NASTY... ok lets move on ... as im writing this review im drinking Soda water hopefully it will  help my stomach... their hummus was grainy and full of cumin ... it was more cumin paste then hummus.... And their falafels i will be honest with u the flavor was kinda ok but it was so hard  my gums  got ripped!!!

They're literally big enough for 2-3 people to eat and be full. I'm a big guy and I shared them with my wife once, with my son the second time we went, and both times we were full.
