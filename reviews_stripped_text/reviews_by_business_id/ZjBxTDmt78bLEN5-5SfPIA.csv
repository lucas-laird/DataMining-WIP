1673241,2017-08-20,11,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"You know you have a burrito addiction when you walk into a new location of Rivas and the cashier recognizes you -- from another location. Gotta say, it's smart to bring in the experienced staff to ensure your opening goes smoothly. 

Rivas Fans will appreciate that the menu is the same, so you can order your regular dishes and they'll turn out just right. My carnitas burrito with cheese was exactly like the one I get regularly at the Desert Inn location. For those unfamiliar with the local chain, the prices are low and the menu is massive. Quality is better than other similar Mexican food spots but my standby choice here (besides the burritos) is the fajitas, while another friend swears by their fish tacos. 

NOTE: Their other locations have Eat24 ordering enabled, hopefully this one will too. This location, unlike others, is NOT 24 hours!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,17,4,VuvI2L0v8jII463oO7qmiQ
1821467,2017-12-09,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"Very clean restaurant and great customer service. I ordered a rolled taco plate with rice and beans. I couldn't finish it due to the high content of salt. Rice was very salty and the beans were okay, the rolled tacos were good, but just too much sodium.  I tried the chicken quesadilla and it was okay, the same as anywhere else.",s0wOwU_bkxfTMW2oFnM_tQ,2,0,3,YMG1LxnlVm3oXrEclkTDvg

The meat was flavorful. The salsas were spicy but good.   We paid a little less than 20 dollars for both items but it was worth it. Better than other ""taco shops"" in the area.",N-YKdtrN9Tx8Gi3nxUlbWg,2,0,4,BmTR2wEO83lFwhGkou9MKQ
2692600,2018-05-25,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,I go here a few times a month. I usually order the shrimp fajitas with a side of beans. The serving is very filling I almost always end up sharing with someone. But that's my opinion! The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean. The shrimp fried are also delicious.,MR4FXg68kSn1ps5O4acigw,0,0,5,uJ-9eg2Mhdt98b8YVMi9Fg

They always have great customer service its always clean but the last time i ordered i got a rolled taco plate and within 2 hours i was throwing up/diahreah and had to go to the hospital for food poisoning. Thats all i had to eat that day so i know it was the food. I felt like i was dying for 2 days but the nausea symptoms lasted for a whole week after. I also.missed 2 days of work. Its unfortunate cause the food was always good and APPEARED fresh. I will never be back.",sBSizGLzyxRjvR-vbt-Oxg,1,0,1,xLjXfDUI8nOT7DTH_gLqqg
2800382,2018-04-20,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"My wife and I have been searching for good Mexican food with delivery.  We tried Rivas, and we're still searching.  We ordered several dishes, all of which should have been based heavily on cheese - cheese enchiladas, steak nachos, shrimp quesadilla, and a chile relleno.  On each dish, the cheese was sparse to non-existent.  Even though the shrimp and steak were pretty good, cutting corners on the cheese really diminished the taste and quality.  

The menu is large and varied, so there might be some other dishes that would be quite good.  Maybe we should have tried a burrito or torta, which wouldn't have suffered from the no-cheese problem.  Maybe we should give Rivas another shot.  But seriously, how do you serve a cheese enchilada with almost no cheese flavor?

Side note:  The delivery through Eat 24 was very quick and accurate.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,oq_G8G0Yt4UV-fCeTzt9FQ

4045819,2017-11-06,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,I was pretty happy with my breakfast burritos. I got the chorizo burrito and my fiance had the sausage breakfast burrito both with an order of plain fries. He added onion and rice to his burrito. We were both as happy as could be with our orders! The fries aren't very good I wouldn't recommend ordering a side of them as we did. But the burrito is the important part and it was delicious! We had the order delivered so I never saw the store. It was made quickly and had fast delivery through doordash.,bwcUMtYn7iBpio4j0cFtDA,3,0,4,vY_5dRyNJcqAaIpO7FB05g
4091553,2017-09-30,2,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"I ordered the taco combo which comes with two tacos the picture shows two hard shell tacos but you can get soft tacos which I got. I wanted to get one taco with asada and the other one chicken but apparently they charge you an extra $7 to do two tacos of different meats!!!! Fucking dumb! So I ended up just getting two asada tacos lol cause that shit is a rip off! My tacos were okay I give them a 6 It came with a lot of meat the meat is cut up in big chunks which I am not a big fan of and some of the meat was chewy. It comes with pico de Gallo and Guacamole. Honestly I wouldn't get them again. My bf got the asada fries which I recommend. They're big enough to share with two people and a small child. The fries are crispy! It comes with sour cream, beans, meat, cheese, and pico de Gallo.",d4iFEVUR5EcUzDcg2ox1vg,1,0,3,MIbszO9lENrzDMVFV-7q0w
4219001,2018-01-28,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,I came to this place because I had a certificate from restaurant.com that I purchased on 1/18. I showed it to the cashier prior to ordering and she said I couldn't use it because the manager has already told the site to stop selling them. They have nothing posted anywhere about no longer accepting them. Since everyone was hungry we all ordered.The cashier told us the wait would be a bit. (Only one guy cooking in the back)  My carne asada nachos had a lot of fat and tough pieces off meat that I had to spit out. When my husband went to get a refill of horchata it was $1 and nowhere does it state that they charged for refills. You would think that since they took so long to get the food to us they would at least give a free refill. Now I see why this place isn't rated very high. A little customer service training wouldn't hurt.,QG6MUKkHhC5XneLz5JfUYA,2,0,1,ic5y4sEkauDppw2qUfAH-g

4575349,2017-10-16,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"We went for dinner here yesterday as it was walking distance from where we lived. We received their menu in our mailbox and decided what we wanted before we got there. First, I understand the whole ""prices are subject to change without prior notice"" BUT why would I get the menu in the mail the day before and show up to prices that are significantly higher, $2 higher. We ordered an asada torta, which was bland. No real flavor. The wings were okay, they were a little dry. The al pastor quesadilla was not my favorite, the meat was decent but for a quesadilla there wasn't much cheese. I think the best thing we ordered were the asada fries. They were better than the rest of the food, maybe because it had a lot more condiments than the rest, came with beans, tomato, onions, cilantro, cheese and sour cream.  Doubt we will be going back. Place was quiet and clean, but food was for dine-in and placed in take out boxes.",E5tC2gueMoHYuEjp2UUZ-A,1,0,2,Btiv8rMLNSwJceKnJLvvDg
4578303,2017-10-22,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"We were really blown away by this place! The day before we had ordered from another mexican restaurant and were not very impressed. Rivas definitely turned our mood right around and we spent just about the same amount of money. 

Our order consisted of a chicken quesadilla ($8.84), 2 piece chicken enchilada combo ($6.50), a shrimp taco ($2.85), a steak taco ($2.85), the wet carnitas burrito ($6.70) and an 8oz order of rice and beans ($2.50 each). 

   Everything was delicious! My favorite would be their shrimp taco and chicken enchiladas. Everything was seasoned well and they didn't hold back on sauce or cheese. And it's always a plus when you order something for delivery and they actually include utensils and napkins (I can't tell you how many times I order delivery and the restaurant does NOT include these little things).  We will definitely be ordering from them again!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,2,1,4,b05C581J2bF7NepbN0DvPA
5628503,2018-05-06,0,ZjBxTDmt78bLEN5-5SfPIA,"I was craving some Mexican food for 'Cinco De' Mayo.' I was searching on Yelp, I seen this place on there called  'Rivas Mexican Grill.' This is my first time ever hearing about this place and I never ever had Mexican food delivered, I normally always ate at a 'Mexican Restaurant.' I read good reviews about 'Rivas Mexican Grill,' so I decided to give them a try. I had my food delivered to my Apartment. 

I order the California Steak burrito, that had Steak, Potatoes, and cheese, I had them add beans to it to, salsa and guacamole. I also order the Steak Nachos, and the Chicken hard shell taco. I truly enjoyed it, I also like that they're affordable. The burrito filled me up, they're very big. The chicken taco was good to. 

My only issue is the Nachos. I think it was good, also love the steak meat they use, but I feel that having them delivered, the chips got soft so easily. I think if I was eating at the restaurant, the nachos will be better, cause they're served right at that moment and probably on a plate, where the chips is spread out. The nachos probably wouldn't gotten soft cause they're served right away at that moment. I think having them delivered though, they're going to get soft, and also from having all the cheese, steak, beans and stuff on them, stuff in a to-go box, they will of course get soft. Other than that, I will for sure order from them again. I also will love to try other things on their menu to. I truly do recommend this place !!!",sQb3cL26qaDgaXEQQTIUNQ,0,0,4,JvXdCJqvY6zW5HFNwxhYpQ
