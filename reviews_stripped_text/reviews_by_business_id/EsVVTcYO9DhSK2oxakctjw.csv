The ""regular"" cheese pizza was very good. Very close to a New York pie. However, the white pizza lacked a little pizzazz. It was a little bland, too little if not any garlic. Will try again and request basil instead of arugula. I say give this place a try if you're shopping for your new regular pizza delivery joint.",GUgo7Dg6-cSh--1VS7XCZQ,0,0,4,qdu93rVxVquxgGUPwWmw4w

1543811,2018-01-16,0,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,"As much as I don't want to tell anyone how good this place is, they more than earned a review plus I need to be sure that they get enough business so they don't have problems!

We went there last Friday night early, and the place was quiet.. but I saw a bunch of delivery orders heading out and more people came streaming in before long. The dining room isn't  huge but it's clean and nicely decorated. It was nice to see a small restaurant that didn't look like the owner's toddlers painted the place.

Staff was very friendly and attentive, and our waitress (Shannon) was a treat. We ordered and were served bread and butter for our wait.

Hubby ordered their Rosemary-infused lemonade and absolutely loved it. It was too tart for my tastes, but he was in heaven.

Hubby's entree was a special, black squid ink risotto with shrimp & crawfish, I think. He ate all he could and finished up the rest for a midnight snack. It was tasty, and the $16.99 price was surprisingly low. I'm more used to specials being sold for monster amounts but this was in line with the rest of their menu.

He also got a house salad with Shannon's homemade dressing and it was really good.

Additionally, he got a serving of Tiramisu that he ate later... and said that it was the best he'd ever had.

I absolutely had to try the stromboli! I used to get one at a place that dropped it when new owners took over and I've been searching for a worthy replacement. Too many places think it's okay to fill a stromboli with pizza toppings but Amano got it right and it was excellent! I got the small and couldn't even eat half, the leftovers were lunch for both of us the next day. It was overfilled with mozzarella, totally epic. Plus, the marinara sauce was thick and yummy with the right balance of acidity.

We loved this restaurant enough that we ordered subs for pick up two days later. Hubby got the Spicy Italian and I got the Italian Combo. He didn't think his sub was particularly spicy but it was still rather tasty. 

Mine was excellent, and those subs are a ridiculous size! I could only eat 1/4 of my sub, and then another 1/4 the next day.

I particularly enjoyed the toasted baguette, it was just the right amount of crunch while leaving the bulk of it soft.

Hubby also just HAD to get another serving of Tiramisu and managed to eat it without losing his smile.

Yelpers can get a free cannoli for checking in here. I'm not a dessert person nor a fan of cannoli  (I know, heretic!) but I'm willing to bet that it's an excellent cannoli.

They also sell bulk meats, cheeses, salads, cookies, etc from a display by the door. 

The restaurant is located in the inside corner of a small L shaped strip mall at the NW corner of Tenaya and Ann Road (access on Tenaya). Trust me, their quality belongs in a nicer location than a strip mall but you won't be thinking of that once you're inside. 

I overheard the parties from 2 other tables talking about how awesome their pizza is so I think I might order that for delivery tonight. After all, it's been a week and I'm starting to have withdrawal symptoms!",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,0,0,5,o287WxVw40Kyfb6A7Z6o-A

Glass of wine would have been nice but alcohol is not available so we ordered the rosemary infused lemonade and it was  refreshing.  For Dessert the lemon marscapone cheesecake.... so good.

1673281,2017-12-13,11,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,"Amano is amazing! Shout out to David V and Suki K for introducing me to this spot. They planned a group dinner here where we were able to meet with Chef Jay and try several of their best dishes. When you first come in, the space looks like a takeout joint, but hang a right and there's the dining room. 

The dish that most piqued my interest is the Pumpkin Parmigiana, featuring layers of lightly-fried pumpkin in place of the usual eggplant, layered with mozzarella and marinara. It is crispy, gooey perfection, and Chef Jay must be my spirit animal because his namesake sandwich on the lunch menu also features the fried gourd that I love so much!

Other dishes we tried were the arancini (rice balls), Braciole (rolled flank steak), and one of their pizzas- the Cindy, which riffs on the bacon wrapped date app that so many people love. Add in caramelized onion and a bit of pesto to add flavor and cut the sweetness, throw it all on a fresh, chewy pie, and there you go. It's dreamy, and the fact that it's named after a customer is a cool touch, too!.

Come hungry, because they also have some stellar desserts- you can get a cannoli (with both chocolate and pistachio!) free with Yelp check in, or try their Rainbow Cake (based on the famous cookie). Or, if you're too full, just get your sugar fix from their awesome house rosemary lemonade- I didn't initially think this would go with an Italian dinner, but I couldn't stop sipping!

Looking forward to coming back soon to try the Chef Jay sando and the Chef's Favorite Pizza (white pie with mushrooms and truffle oil, yes please).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,17,4,wd8q8nHC2p80CWrZS93REA

1758596,2018-01-25,0,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,"Let's be real for a second..Truly good pizza is not the easiest to find, but Amano will stop the search for your new go to pizza joint. They also have a pretty extensive menu of pasta dishes and dinner dishes, though I did not try them when I was there. My family and I walked in on a Saturday night looking for a table for 5. We were immediately greeted and seated by a gentleman working behind the counter. Their dining space is small and intimate, but still a good space for a large group. Shannon was our waitress and she was honestly great. She made suggestions when we asked about different foods and wasn't that over the top, annoying, wannabe nice waitress that I seem to find too often in Vegas. Moving on. We ordered the Chef's Special Pizza, garlic knots, and goat cheese and beet salad. ALL OF IT WAS GOOD. The salad ingredients were fresh, the chef's special pizza had a perfect crust and delicious truffle oil on it, and the garlic knots were straight out of the oven. For dessert, my husband ordered the Cannoli. They come in a set of three and had this yummy, light filling. I usually refuse to eat cannolis because they're too heavy, but these were great. 

P.S. they do currently deliver, though they will only go within a 5 mile radius. Just something to keep in mind if you're hoping for delivery.

I've eaten the pumpkin parmigiana and eggplant rollatini, so I can thoroughly recommend both dishes with a side of pasta and delicious bread to soak up any extra tomato sauce. A simple cheese pizza ordered for my daughter was also very good, so I wouldn't hesitate to order one of the more creative options.

They are located off of Ann, Teneya, near the 95 in a very small shopping center. It's a very small place- feels crowded and not romantic at all.  I think in the future take out or delivery would be the way I order from Amano. One thing that throws my senses off is the music. In the entrance/kitchen there is one type of music playing, then in the dining area there is another type playing and they are both really loud so my ears don't know what to do with battle of boomboxes.
I ordered the Cindy once which has some many flavors, I think it is meant to be shared, because after one piece I was overwhelmed and had to take the rest home. I will stick to plain pepperoni next time. The crust and sauce are very flavorful- adding a pow! to the pizza. When you go, make sure to order the lemonade with rosemary, again something that should be shared. I finished the entire carafe and I felt a sugar rush afterwards. I do wonder why Amano serves their beverages in plastic cups? On my first visit I sampled the pumpkin parmigiana and it was so good. It made my belly happy. I would recommend it.

I was excited to read the description for their Italian grinder thinking this will be my new place, but was disappointed at the meat selection, or lack of (why ham and not prosciutto??).  Luckily they have all the meats to make a good grinder, but I quickly realized an authentic Italian was going to cost close to a thousand dollars.
 
Anyway, the slices we did get were alright - a little greasy but not bad, the crust was good but alone it has a weird flavor of flour maybe, the sauce was good.  Unfortunately they got our toppings wrong.  Neither of us finished our second slice (which is so weird, especially for the pizza lover in the group).
I wanted dessert but was hesitant because I'm often disappointed in Italian sweets, I thought about the chocolate cake but for $7 it wasn't worth the risk.  As it was 4 slices and a cesar salad somehow came to $25? That's only slightly less than a whole pie at most places.",QKfZqCzMdAz9CTYrhC5DjQ,5,0,2,7El6qY9HnTpS5glJqhKcpQ

I tried the Cindy...WOW... even with takeout the bacon was crispy, crust cooked to perfection... all the flavors blended perfectly. Tasted exactly how I imagined based on the menu description.
I also tried the fresh fried cheese, which was unique take on fried cheese sticks. They were good, but at $10 for 4 pieces, I would not get again. The sauces they came with were absolutely delicious.
My husband had a cheese and sausage pizza which he also liked a lot.

3229568,2018-03-31,3,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,"Holy cow! I went to this place very hopeful!  The positive reviews are initially what brought me and someone at work actually recommended this place as one of the best pizza places that they've ever been to in Las Vegas. I am currently rethinking my friendship with this person.

Disclaimer: I absolutely love pizza. 

""What does that even mean Dee? Everybody loves pizza."" 

No, people like pizza, they may even enjoy pizza. 

But Pizza is my desert island food. 

I would even go so far as to consider myself a pizza connoisseur. I have recently come back from a trip to New York where I literally walked from the bottom of the city towards the top for hours trying different slices of pizza. 
Every meal I had during a 3 day trip consisted of pizza. That's true commitment. 

Anyway, I had just had a long day snowboarding and was craving some of that New York style pizza so I went to Amano's.

Anyone who says that this pizza tastes like New York pizza is one of two things:  A filthy liar or someone who is never actually been to New York or even been in the same room as an NY slice. 

To keep it simple, this pizza tasted like cafeteria pizza. It reminded me of that square cut of pizza you got in elementary school but you have now finally graduated to having a crust with it. 

The cheese was so rubbery and had that ""fake cheese"" taste. (You know what I'm talking about.)

This place single-handedly made me create a ""try a slice first and then go for another"" rule for myself because now I am stuck with two slices of cafeteria pizza. Bleh. Pass.",mMPyPwJQITYj1sdOD0gnKw,0,0,1,XKo5fNd7drGqdQwXLlosyQ

It's a beautiful and quaint little place with about 8 tables. Our server Michael was fantastic. I saw the person next to me eating the Italian sub and I wanted a light(er) lunch so I decided to go with that. My husband had the 2 slices of pizza lunch combo. My 18 month old had the meatballs. The BEST thing was the bread, hands down. The sub roll and the pizza crust was amazing!!!! The pizza had a really good taste. I personally prefer my pizza crisper and ask for it ""well done"". I'll probably do this next time. The pepperoni on the pizza had a really good flavor and you could tell all the ingredients were high quality. The Italian sub definitely is a true grinder. Not sure why another review thought it wasn't. Again, it was very tasty and I could tell the cheese and meats were high quality. My son ate the meatballs and I tried one. They were delicious and we also ate the sauce with a spoon, it was so tasty! We also tried the cannolis. I do agree that $7 for two small cannolis is much even though they were very tasty. I didn't feel the other prices were unreasonable at all. I'm always willing to pay a little more for good quality food and to support local small businesses. Lastly, we brought out 18 month old who normally is really great in restaurants but today not so much. We didn't realize he was that tired. I REALLY appreciate Michael the waiter be so nice, patient and calm about my little one crying and wanting to walk around. We definitely would have left if the place was full, but we were the only ones there at the time. It means a lot to new parents that they don't feel shamed or unwanted when they have a crying baby. We'll definitely be back. I'm looking forward to trying the Stromboli, eggplant parm, eggplant rolitini and the pumpkin parm!!",UmraTM5oi_MoeKFOVa84AA,4,4,5,cXGyMUPykkDoYfFW6fuiVg
4145131,2018-04-24,0,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,First  before I say what was wrong I do want to say the food is tasty. I ordered the braciole with spagetti and my husband ordered the veal marsala with spagetti. We also both ordered the calamari as appetizer. The calamari was perfect. Good thing we ordered two as usually we share an appetizer. The portions were too small in my opinion and we would not have been able to share one. The meals came and instead of spagetti we both got linguine. There is a difference between the two and we wanted spagetti not linguine. We didn't send it back because we did not want to wait. My husband's veal marsala was very tender but again a small portion about one and a half pieces of veal and too much marsala. His linguine came out in small salad bowl and really wasn't enough. Then came my braciole which I had been excited for. After my first taste I realized this was not made with flank steak as this is what it normally is made with. It just tasted like a slice of pot roast to me. My linguine was on my plate and it was triple the amount then my husband got with his meal. When ordering meals you would expect the same amount of pasta to come with each meal. Unfortunately it is a bit pricey for all of this to be wrong.

First thing you notice when walking up are the amazing smells coming from the kitchen! 
When you walk in the vibe of this place really is mom and pop you hear wonderful music playing i had a wonderful welcome from shannon working the front, you can tell the owner really cares about what he does and loves to cook and bake.

The dine in area is super cute and  inviting, very clean and open with cute original decorations you dont see at every other italian restaurant.

We ordered the speacialty pizza called bianca and it was amazing! Perfect amount of cheese with sauce and the crust is REAL pizza crust im so sick of going to pizza places and not getting PIZZA crust. Anyways lol the owner was sweet enough to come out and let us know when the pizza was almost done and asked if we wanted the arugala on the side instead of on the pizza and that in itsself really tells you he cares because he also knew we ordered it togo and unless we ate the pizza right there it wouldnt be good and to me thats also how you spot an amazing chef most places wouldnt have thought of things like that unless you asked.

If youve been craving REAL pizza and pasta home made from scratch come to this place you can def taste the love! They also make hot and cold subs as well as many deserts and cookies to choose from.  They even had a SHRIMP parmisan on the menu and thats something you dont see now a days!

The restaurant is in an unassuming shopping center, but the inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and clean. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waiter continued to be attentive and accommodating throughout our entire meal.

We started with a Large Caesar Salad which was excellent. The dressing was delicious and the lemon in the dressing really set off the flavor. The waiter even offered to bring extra anchovies since my friend loves them. The bread brought out before the meal was delicious as well. It looked simple, but was crusty and well flavored.

For our main meal we shared the New Yorker. I loved the crust on the pizza, specifically the flavor of the crust. I could tell the crust was fresh and homemade by the flavor. The entire pizza was delicious.

Dessert was Tiramisu and we both enjoyed this as well. The flavor and texture were great. Since there were so many good desserts to choose from I selected Rainbow Cake to go as well. I love rainbow cookies and this cake really captured the great flavors in the cookie. My cake was a little on the dry side, but the flavor made up for it.

We ordered two entrees, a salad, and a dessert to go. After about 50 mins, she brought out two small (school lunch size) brown paper bags. I even made the comment, ""Everything's in these two bags?"" Which she confirmed. Our order came to over $60.

When we got home and opened the bags, the salad had no dressing and the dressing we ordered was not in either bag. The dessert was so small, it could be gone in two small bites (just enough to piss you off). The entrees were no better: very small and so under seasoned making them extremely bland. Certainly not worth the wait and definitely not worth the cost.

I should've known better than to believe this to be an authentic Italian experience when they can't even spell ""marscapone"" right on their menus. It's ""mascarpone.""

4796743,2018-01-10,0,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,"First let me preface this review as a person that grew up in an Italian culinary family here in Las Vegas, my father was the executive chef of a very successful Italian restaurant in the late sixties, seventies and most of the eighties. I'm a true foodie. I would have liked to give this new Italian restaurant a better score and I have to say that they did deserve at least one star, mainly for the decor and cleanliness of this small space, maybe a capacity of 25. It was clean and pretty and the unisex restroom was clean, modern and functional. That's a big accomplishment since so many restaurants get this wrong. I felt comfortable right away and was very excited about trying this new culinary experience. Then it all went downhill from there. I'll try to explain without to many derogatory remarks. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door by the waitress whom I'm assuming might have been a family member, and was promptly seated. I was the only one in the restaurant as they just opened, I usually have a nice lunch after my haircut and love trying new restaurants in the neighborhood. She was pleasant and friendly as she took my order, spaghetti with meatballs and a Diet Coke. She told me she would bring a salad which was included with the entree and some hot bread. She delivered the bread and it had a small container of butter, the bread was warm and toasty but the butter was super cold and what I could put on the bread tasted old and stale...yuck. Suddenly after about 15 minutes the chef brought out my entree, no salad. I was so hungry I dove into the pasta dish and much to my surprise it was only barely serving temperature which most people describe as being cold, yes it was cold. I couldn't believe it, really? cold? Then a few minutes later she brought what looked like a nice side salad and apologized for it being late, then left it on the table after I told her I wouldn't eat it, I was thoroughly perturbed by now. I will give the dish a shout out in that the spaghetti had a nice texture and was seemingly homemade. The sauce was bland and too thick, the meatballs were to soft and also bland. No garlic, no basil, no wine, no flavor. Very disappointing. Why didn't I say something to them at the time you ask? It was lunch, I just wanted a quick delicious meal without drama, didn't get it. Oh and chef, please don't call your customers ""boss"", that's so old and informal, I didn't appreciate it at all.

This is our go-to place when we don't feel like cooking.",TH-2jWe-oROgbONS3mnSiA,1,1,5,f6XyBtBBl2RzzawsRlx1rA

My daughter ordered a caesar salad, the waiter asked if she wanted anchovies and she said no. After she finished the salad he told us it had anchovies in it already but he didn't want her to know until she ate it. Thankfully she isn't allergic to fish!! Very scary to think that would have happened if she was. I will never go back, who do they think they are trying get my daughter to try something, that's my job. Your the waiter, not her parent.
I was there on March 30, the waiter was an older gentleman, he had on a flatcap type hat",V_rUs-Rn1MBmpuoRuDM_6w,0,0,1,inAFq0kwYj9VHOR-x2fukA

5609847,2018-01-26,0,EsVVTcYO9DhSK2oxakctjw,"A neighborhood gem! The stuffed portabella mushroom, rich with red pepper sauce was an excellent start. My husband ordered the Braciole which was not only tender but rich with layers of flavor.  The house salad ingredients were crisp and icy cold with a, get every drop  homemade dressing. The fresh baked bread is sourced from a local  French bakery was yeasty with just the right crisp. They use the same source for subs and sandwiches.  I ordered the seared tuna , Atlantic, not farm raised which clearly was the case after the first bite.  Perfect sear and flavor.  Don't miss the infused lemonade which was the perfect compliment to the meal.   We don't usually order dessert but after reading the reviews on the chocolate cake we ordered it to go.  Had we eaten it there, we probably would have ordered another to bring home! Love to see a local business take off and I believe it is only a matter of time before we are waiting for a table.",wixPS2Mq8tY93Fe5z4pj3Q,0,0,5,pQFL1xhW8Cb6MFQv0hJ6rg
