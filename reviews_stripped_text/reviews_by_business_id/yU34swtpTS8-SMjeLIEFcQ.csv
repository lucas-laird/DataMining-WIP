That's not how you treat regular customers. Also very stingy with sauce, extremely unwilling to give extra, and last time I went my meat was completely charred. Needless to say that was my last time ever eating here, they can keep their 1 extra sauce and continue practicing rude customer service if they think it's worth losing a regular customer over it.",kwV24XuUKN5ncelesciW-A,1,0,1,eZ9LTn-RmtO3rbzPQFNQMw

For the plate and a drink, it was about 12 dollars. The quality wasn't worth it though. It reminded me of a cheap place you get Asian food in the mall. Very plain and lacking of flavor.

2041549,2015-06-02,0,yU34swtpTS8-SMjeLIEFcQ,"I really wanted to love this place.  I had read lots of great comments about this place so I suggested it for my weekly lunch date with my guy.  He only has an hour for lunch so this seemed perfect.

He ordered the beef bowl and I ordered the shrimp and veggie bowl.   I love brown rice but it was not an option that day, perhaps they were out.   His bowl was, in his words was good but not great.  The amount of meat vs rice was way out of proportion, he pitched a good amount of rice when he was done. 

Now onto my shrimp and veggie bowl, poor poor shrimp and veggie bowl.  At first glance it looked really good. The tail on shrimp was the perfect pink color you expect from good shrimp and even had a bit of char on the edges.  I couldn't wait to dig in...then my nose was filled with that sulfur smell cabbage gives off.  Not just a wee whiff, but an overwhelming cabbage odor (and for the record I'm an Irish girl, I'd eat cabbage on an old boot but I've never been smacked in the face with this much cabbage-yness before) so my superhero boyfriend came to my rescue and started a cabbage-ectomy.  When he was done my bowl was only 1/3 full...4 shrimp (we'll get to them next) and two small pieces of broccoli and one and a half coins of carrot.  My bowl was literally 2/3 cabbage!  The picture on the menu was not what was handed to me. It should have been called a cabbage bowl. 

There was a saving grace...the shrimp...or so I thought. I picked one up and what looked like a plump perfectly juicy shrimp was those paper thin butterflies shrimp you get on shrimp sushi at an asian buffet. I actually held it up to the light and I could see through it. They tasted of nothing, the tails were floppy. If you are going to charge a couple dollars more than a beef dish (with a good bit of beef in the dish) you better give me more than 4 see through shrimp and a metric ton of cabbage. 

The two stars are one each for not screwing up the rice and for really good teriyaki sauce that wasn't super thick and cloyingly sweet. If I could get a jar of that stuff I'd pay for it then take it home and make some amazing teriyaki shrimp...those giant suckers (jumbo shrimp is probably my favorite oxymoron next to military intelligence, but I digress).  In this story I was the poor sucker who paid 8 ish bucks for a bowl o' rice and cabbage. I totally hear you laughing at me!",BDoSVFfwpGqluwxpIkFtRQ,0,0,2,9NfSRGSxDFW5f2au7bzj_A

What I got was the #11 Chicken and Beef Combo Plate with Vegetables and Brown Rice. Right away I am liking the fact that they don't charge you extra for the brown rice. The vegetables, which they give you good portions of, are consisted of broccoli, cabbage, and sliced carrots. 

The teriyaki sauce they have there are in big squeeze bottles. They also have sriracha for you spice heads. They have many other choices besides chicken and beef like short ribs, fish, tempura, miso soup, and California rolls.

The beef had the right amount of marinade but the chicken probably could have been marinated a little longer. The sauce was semi-sweet and just had the right mixture of salty and sweet. Food wise it's not a bad place, but it just didn't blow me away or anything. The reason for the 3 stars was that when I ordered my food, the cook dropped some meat on the counter and put it in my bowl.

3332835,2016-02-19,0,yU34swtpTS8-SMjeLIEFcQ,"This review is for 3.5 stars.  

Yogi's has a solid terriyaki bowl for comparable prices to other terriyaki places and fast casual in general.  Most of their meals run from $6 to $10 and they have chicken, steak, salmon, and a few other options, either in a bowl or just vegetables.  They also have sushi for pretty cheap, but I didn't try it.

Yogi's is very comparable to the up-and-coming terriyaki bowl type of fast food.  It has prompt service, the meat was uniquely cut and marinated, and it looked like they were sponsored by sriracha which I am a fan of for a nice kick.  The terriyaki sauce was average and the vegetables were a little watery, but I thought the actual beef portion was better than most other comparable spots.

I wouldn't say Yogi's is hands down the best terriyaki in town, but it's a solid option for a nice, filling lunch in the Summerlin area.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,0bxbrk1WhONUBa3FDOwbvg

Nope...here at Yogi's Teriyaki you will be greeted like a stranger bothering their business by simply stepping up to order. Watch as the non-chef chef's pull some lukewarm meat out of the warming containers next to the grill. See them prepare dried out beef and chicken jerky on their dry grill; all the while smelling burning meat. Then watch as they don't put it fresh on your plate; rather straight into the warming pot to the left of the grill. When you finally get your food, it's of course luke warm and not fresh; because it too came out of the holding warmer. The food was boring, tasteless unless you soaked it in Teriyaki sauce at your table. Now back to the service without a smile, without a care, and without respect for your few and far between customers. Personally I think that you need to seriously re-visit your recipes, your reason for being in business, and greet and treat your guests like royalty. They are after all your single source of success! Your food should be flavorful, fresh, piping hot and stop cutting your meats so damn thin that we have to be 90 years old to eat it. If you cannot serve them fresh tasty food with warmth and care; then shut it down and save yourselves!

For starters, we always take it to go so we don't have any time to really get served. What I can say about the cashier is that he is very accommodating with offering extra Teriyaki sauce and chili sauce, and points out where the napkins, forks and spoons are. When we order over the phone, the voice always sounds so welcoming and friendly. 

I ordered Yogi's plate. The shrimp was a disappointment as the three were super small and butterflied for the effect of largeness - which did not succeed. As for the rice, not so good. for some reason, it goes hard after a few minutes and doesn't taste like the other Japanese rice I'm accustomed to. Cheap version perhaps? Although, the beef and chicken were full of flavor and goodness. I was very impressed with the taste of the meat. I was also in favor of their salad. The dressing tasted home made. Oh, I also ordered Shrimp Tempura which was very good. I would order this over and over again. I think this was my favorite in the whole menu.

So now i am here to try it and they have it but have to wait for them to make it.,2-01LlVLrCujcL1kT2Xchw,0,0,3,1sDXyYnoRX0pTqmzX8B3Ew

I came with my GF and we order a chicken/beef plate, and a need rib plate. They even cook in the front of house so you know it's fresh! Will be coming back",fcra9uhtCHmpXdhDamb5cg,1,1,5,fENGATTY-HApXHvAx190_g

Their combo plate was amazing and perfectly portioned for my husband and I! Fast service and reasonable pricing. The food was delicious. Will definitely be stopping in again to fill up:),1zhySrwxXfwxe8cz7VpqKw,0,0,5,5AdTPSBflzoOs6EAgUcanw

I chose this place because it's near my best friends office and I have been craving teriyaki chicken... For a large to go box it was over $7 which includes on the food, no drink. I prefer Sakura on west Craig but it's out if the way.... Besides the prices that food was actually really good and I will eat here again when ever I'm visiting my friend",fOnvEAWMovLW2EsZkXoL0g,0,0,4,fKLKIpcv9bSXNaSjNjmOIQ

While you can upgrade to all white meat I don't need to here, there is still a mix of both, and the plates are HUGE- way more than one meal.  My fiancé used to live over this way and we still make a point to stop here on the way home from red rock hikes now that we live across town.",P7Gzueku0UJHfN5pBciDeg,2,2,5,5jyo2Ql5LvAKCVzQ80tNDw

This place reminds me of the Flame Broiler locations I used to order take out from when I lived in California. They offer a pretty simple menu with your choice of Teriyaki bowls and plates, Tempura, Salads, and a few sushi rolls. 

I decided to get the Chicken & Beef Plate. It was pretty good and they give you a good portion. It even comes with a small garden salad and sliced oranges. My only complaint is that some of the beef was kind of fatty so I had to throw those pieces away. But overall it was full of flavor and kept me full!

Fast service, clean, and reasonable prices. They employees were friendly as well. They offered me extra teriyaki and hot sauce even though I didn't need it. I'll definitely be back!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,0,4,YfNQdHSgBcYKpMFtGHhmDg

The food was decent, but the meat was cut a little differently than most. It was chopped into smaller pieces which I didn't love. The sauce was a little sweeter and thicker than I like, but overall the food was good.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,6,3,CXhqlFpNwniXI9KkQCpt2Q
