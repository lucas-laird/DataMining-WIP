845700,2017-06-16,0,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"I drove across town to give this place a shot, and then grab some Thrifty's next door.

I'm pretty sure it was the owner on the grill and who greeted us when we walked in. You could tell he not only cared, but was excited to show off his food. He also made it clear that if it wasn't on the menu, he could probably make it happen anyways.

My wife wanted a burrito that she could pick up and eat, since she's not a fan of the wet burrito knife and fork style. So we asked if all the normal stuff on top could just go inside, and they agreed it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans, the rock shrimp. I also asked if there was something spicy they could throw on there, since I like it a bit hotter than normal gringos. He said he could give me some habanero juice. Sounded good.

We sat for a few minutes as I sucked on my horchata, which tasted homemade, until the food came out. The waitress said that since everything was put inside my wife's burrito the plate looked a bit sad, so they added free chips and a small ramekin of salsa to the plate just to keep the burrito company. That's a small thing, but still costs them, so that's pretty cool. 

My tacos were overloaded with all sorts of goodies, fresh guacamole, pico, and tons of cabbage. The beans were white, and the rice was fluffy. I started the rice and beans and they were crazy good. I'm not even normally a fan, a few scoops of some refried with the Mexican rice and I'm usually done, but these beans and rice were freaking awesome. He must have a secret recipe, like MSG, nicotine and cocaine, because just talking about them makes me want to go back for more.

After wolfing down my rice and beans, I could only get about 2 tacos down, and the wife ate half her burrito, so we boxed it up and took it home. The food was just as good a few hours later when we could both handle more.

Verdict is - while not close to home, when I'm in the area I will definitely be going back for more. This place puts real quality into the food, and the guy on the grill knows his stuff. I can't wait to try different stuff on the menu and see if it's as good as what we've had so far.",mjbTKcJyynlmqOH-EuBY4Q,0,0,5,vmG5YIhZtN3CYk7Qlut5OA

After all it's on the majority of everything on the menu. Which I figured out they were out of due to the sign after I paid for the nachos.

So I changed my order to the fish tacos. Which for 3 fish tacos I paid $11. The fish tacos were disappointing as well. Very small, slightly over battered, & soggy. The batter wasn't to bad, however there wasway more batter than fish (fish wasn't fried long enough to have that nice slight crunch).",51EWjI3WKVl8tZlWDKd-Mw,1,1,1,6cF_Nlgn-YmXpYPRe8VCmQ

1380582,2018-05-09,2,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"Came here for a quick lunch as it was nearby and convenient. First heard about this place from a friend looking for some good tacos in town to hopefully match the ones we ate in Austin, TX. Located on the NW corner of Twain and Durango across from Desert Breeze Park, next to Dirty Fork, it was a surprisingly hidden place i never knew about, despite going to another restaurant in the same complex regularly (Zaytoon's). 

I've been hoping for a place to open up near by that served street tacos so i didn't have to travel to at least the Strip for Tacos el Gordo or only have access to Taco Y Taco if i get off work, when i work at a nearby location.

This is a small little restaurant with a few tables and seats, painted super colorful that serves a surprisingly small menu. All tacos are corn tortillas unless otherwise specified. Since my friend absolute hates corn tortillas, i had asked if they had the option for flour. They said yes, and its an additional $0.50 PER taco because flour tortillas are bigger.

-----------------------------------

I had ordered 2 carne asada, 1 carnitas, and 1 al pastore. I had picked up small cups of the red and green sauce, as well as their pickled carrots and jalapenos. 

When i had arrived home, I, honestly couldn't tell which meat was which. Supposedly the Al Pastore has pineapple, but it fell over and covered two different tacos. 

The tacos were indeed small. Definitely 2-biters. Meats were all grilled. I cant tell if it was the Al Pastore or the Carnitas that had some grispy bits to it. Carnitas wasn't the usual ""pulled pork looking shredded pork, but also was chopped to pieces like the other meats. I'm assuming the Al Pastore was the 3rd taco that had its meat in slices, but in comparison to all the other al pastores i've had in other places, this was different as well.

The tacos overall were OK at best. Not particularly flavorful nor tender. Their red or green sauces weren't spicy nor was the pickled jalapenos. If anything, the pickled carrots had a bit more spice to it. LOL?  Price was good at least. Wonder how their shrimp/fish tacos are like?

Al pastor- meaty mouthful... plenty of pineapple to balance the salty smoke and light heat from the pork... delicious. 

Crispy beef- tender shredded beef in a crispy fried shell... hearty, tasty and good. 

The space is small with simple bench seating and an order counter... real casual and comfy.  The service was warm, friendly and quick.

The taco shells are aromatic and not overpowering. Battle won.

The Al Pastor Taco is sweet with a little intended char on it to add texture and a smokey flavor. Will be getting this again.

The grilled chicken has the char and smokey flavor too. It has a sweet-sour taste. Good contrast from the sweet beef.

The shrimp taco is loaded with red cabbage which makes it good. It is a little too crispy though. I would like a more juicy shrimp taco please.

Oh and they also serve Mexican soda. That means real cane sugar and well placed guilt.

Restaurant was clean with bright seating and decor. I went with coworkers during lunch and they weren't that busy so we had our choice of seating. 

I ordered 3 tacos - carne asada (meat was average), crispy beef brisket (the only thing crispy about it was the taco shell), and shrimp taco (shrimp was deep fried and it had more coating than meat). I appreciated the toppings on the taco more than the actual meat itself. Tacos were about $3.00 each so it didn't break the bank.. but food itself was not that memorable.

I'm excited to see they also offer enchiladas.

This super-colorful location was previously another Mexican restaurant known for their vegan options, but Bomb Tacos has already made effort to retain those customers with their own vegan options. Props for that, will be trying that or a chile relleno next time. Hopefully as they settle in, they expand their menu and adjust prices.

The guy at the counter (could have been the owner/chef) was happy to accommodate a vegetarian diet and recommended subbing a potato/herb mixture instead of meat... he also had a pototo/vege chorizo mixture.  The tacos he recommended were perfect with crispy fried shells, made in house and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, queso fresco and a sour cream sauce.  The guy at the counter brought out two habanero salsas to try (one fresh habanero and one roasted) which were amazing. 

We also had the rice and beans. The rice was really good but different than any Mexican rice I've had. It was made with white rice and was cooked with celery.  We really enjoyed it.

My husband had the Carne Asada, Grilled Chicken, and Crispy Chicken tacos and loved all of them but liked the Carne Asada so much he went back and ordered 2 more.

I've found it. The bold name matches its tacos! I had the Carne Asada and the Al Pastor and my gosh. The meat on both were seasoned just right , almost a sweet and spicy flavor and were not dry (a problem many places have), the onions nice fresh crunch, cilantro fresh, the pineapple on the Al Pastor was juicy and sweet making the flavors just kick, and even though the young lady at the register (turns out was the owner) warns you they are the small Tacos the portions are great! Her husband stopped and said hello on his way out to make sure I had everything I needed. On top of it all they gave the credit to the cook in the back.

I avoided this place at first because of the name.. (Bomb tacos) ?

The woman in the counter was very friendly and offered to help if I had  any questions on the menu. 
I have my mindset on what I wanted. I ordered the Brisket Taquitos and Chicken quesadilla.
Don't expect really fast service like a  traditional taco shop. They take time to make the prepare their food and it shows.The owners obviously have a lot of pride in their restaurant.  
Now for the food. 
The brisket taquitos were the most flavorful, delicious  I've ever had in my life.

My friend and I came in on a Friday evening to order food for take out. After placing our order, we sat at the table closest to the register and waited. We were soo excited to try out these bomb tacos, especially since the reviews got high ratings. 

There were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant (4 people total) waiting for their food for dine in. 
Tell me why we waited ALMOST AN HOUR before leaving with our to-go food. Two parties that came in after us even got their food before my friend and I. The wait was reaching 40 mins so I decided to check up on my order. It turns out that my order had been ready, just sitting there. Ridiculous! The servers had walked by us sooo many times and they didn't notice that we were WAITING for our food?!? We didnt even leave the restaurant for them to forget us. 

I asked where my friend's order was......they stated that it was almost ready. After another 15 minutes, they had admit that her ticket got lost and just made her order also giving her an extra taco. 

This HOUR wait should have never happened, they were not even busy! We were sitting there the whole time and no one even bothered to wonder why. 

By the time we got home, my order was cold and soggy that I didnt even enjoy it. They could have been bomb tacos but with that wait....they didnt taste bomb to me. 

They gave a voucher to my friend to come back in for free lunch. I didnt get any kind of acknowledgement or apology. No thanks, I wont be back.",dAfdS9l7DOMze3orptDxiQ,5,1,2,rM-LFnlcRZvwQ87hd5Lvcw

I just got the brisket taco and the Gueros Taco.   Brisket taco was very small and came in a deep fried tortilla.   I personally found it to be bland and when I opened it up, there was very little inside.   The Gueros taco was better but nothing to write home about.  Not sure if it was meant to be but the tortilla was a little burnt and that flavor negatively masked the other flavors.   The meat inside was tender and pretty flavorful.   My tacos were $6.25 (I know not too much) but I feel like it hardly put a dent in my hunger.   I would need at least double to maybe get full.   Not saying don't try the place but my wife and I won't be trying it again.

It's restaurant quality food masquerading as a strip mall taco shop. The owner greeted us right away and even told us that he knows that his prices are high, but it's because he believes in quality ingredients. Now we can debate whether or not that's a good thing, but I guess that's his vision. Also, I think the owner has changed a few things since the first reviews. (1) I didn't have a credit card fee. (2) I saw someone get a refill on their drink for free when they asked.  But on to the food....

This was some tasty stuff! I got the tacos al pastor. My boyfriend got the chicken burrito. I got the green and red salsa then asked the owner which was hotter. He told me he had a habanero one in the back if I wanted heat. I took him up on it. All three were great. As expected some paired differently with the dishes. So I suggest getting all three and picking the one you like with what you're having. The tacos were street style/small, but they were packed with flavor. That burrito was fantastic from the bite I had. I honestly was still hungry after my tacos, so I ordered the carne asada fries. They are curly fries and packed with flavor. All of the meats were moist and well seasoned. 

As for miscellaneous observations: The shop itself was clean. He seemed to have a few regulars already. Also,  I watched some get an incorrect order, but they did remake it. 

Overall, I loved it. If you are looking for a tasty quickly bite and you care about what you are eating, this is a great find.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,1,1,5,6ssotj2r4tgk6gFl7gkz7g

The place is super cute, colorful, and kind of rustic at the same time. The staff was super awesome, warm, friendly and all smiles. 
I came in just to order take out for my husband, but ended up trying them out while I waited for my take out order. I ordered grilled chicken tacos for the kids and ordered myself a vegetarian shiitake mushroom street taco. When I bit I to that vegetarian taco, it was an immense burst of flavor. I have never been to a place where they can make veggies taste that good. My kids loved the chicken tacos, and their lemonade. My kids are really picky eaters, so when they ate their food in less than 2 mins, then that means the food was great. 
For my take out, I ordered fish tacos, al pastor and carnitas tacos. My husband and his co workers 
loved it so much, that they sent me back to the restaurant for round 2. 
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking for seriously great flavorful tacos or just food in general. This place is really really good. The chose the perfect name for their business. I will be back-soon!",4kBDBcr6sPe2sPkK7ibgtw,2,2,5,lKzub1niQ_ASNIrWehOd1g

I got there right after the opening hours and ordered 4 tacos: carne asada, al pastor, carnitas, and crunchy beef brisket. It took a bit longer than I expected for the order to come out, but not too long. Pricing is reasonable as well.

But was it worth it? Absolutely. All the tacos were really good. I think my favorite was the carnitas. They were all simply dressed with onions, cilantro, and guacamole (except the crunchy brisket, which had lettuce, tomato, and cotija), the flavors were on point.

We walked in to a quaint little spot with bright hand-written menus posted around the counter and colorful, vibrant decor adorning the walls. We were instantly greeted by a friendly face behind the counter. She was more than happy to help explain the menu for us first-time visitors. She took great care of us! 

We decided, so that my husband and I could try a couple different things, to order a shrimp taco plate and a chicken and asada taco plate. Each plate come with 3 gourmet tacos and rice and beans. 

As soon as they brought our plates, you could see right away just how fresh all the ingredients were. All the colors of the veggies and meats on the plate popped and complimented each other beautifully. *Each taco comes with a dollop of guacamole on top, too.* The presentation was spot on! 

We swapped a taco from each plate, added just a little of the delicious salsas they have, and jumped in! Every single bite was bursting with flavor! The shrimp were cooked perfectly, with just little bit of a crunch from a light coating. The grilled chicken was tender and moist, with a slight smokey flavor that was amazing! The cabbage, pico de gallo and guacamole in the tacos were super fresh! And even the tortillas were really good! 

Needless to say, we will most definitely be returning to this fine, family run establishment. You can tell that the owner/chef really takes pride in his art, from the freshness and quality of ingredients, to the presentation, to the customer service! Thank you!

The first time, there were 2 people ahead of me, and it took about 20 minutes for us to get our 3 tacos (carnitas, crisp brisket and chicken) and some asada bomb nachos.  Food is good enough to forgive the wait.  Second time around, we arrived and there were again 2 people who had ordered (3 tacos each) ahead of us, and again it took at least (!) 20 minutes to get our 2 tacos (diablo shrimp and crisp brisket), asada bomb nachos and asada curly fries.    Nothing wrong with the food.  It's really good.  The diablo shrimp tacos and crispy brisket beef tacos definitely stood out.  The asada was as good as amazing home-cooked asada, but otherwise not special.  

All that said, the time they spend on taking care of your order does show.  The fries were crisp and not greasy as they were properly drained from the fryer, and the nachos were warm and not just hot item to melt over a plate of chips.  Also, the carnitas was cut and each piece evenly seared crisp on both sides, etc., to name a few special details afforded when concentrating on getting out one order at a time.  

The hot sauces are tasty and feel freshly made, but they do lack flavor.  I don't just mean they lack heat, which they also do, but for the bold and bright fresh look and consistency of the sauces, they just don't pop.  That is a serious bummer for tacos.

Ordered:
-Crispy beef brisket 
-Shrimp Diablo taco
-Al Pastor taco
-Carne Asada taco

Crispy beef brisket taco - perfectly seasoned/super tender brisket that is contained in a crispy deep fried shell. It is topped with lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, guajillo sauce, and cotija. This was pretty good. 

Shrimp Diablo taco - contained habanero sautéed shrimp topped with cabbage, pico de gallo, and sour cream. It had the perfect amount of spice which was balanced out with the sour cream. The shell was slightly harder than a typical street taco shell. I love spicy food so this was my favorite. 

Al pastor taco - this was topped with guacamole, onions, guajillo sauce, cilantro, and pineapple. This tasted slightly different from what I'm use to.  I usually go to taco y taco or tacos el gordo for al pastor tacos so I was expecting it to taste slightly similar. The al pastor at this place had more of a smoky flavor to it and was slightly dry. Not my favorite but was still good. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes. Definitely give this place a try. You can't knock a place until you've tried it. Just a heads up, the place is small so it can feel a bit congested when standing in line to order.",73epOyK2X_fHGyCQ9S1e4g,2,1,4,0IzWE304Ay8dIFDDJI2BEw

It was definitely different, but it tasted good. I would recommend sharing this with two people because it's HUGE and has a ton of food. 

The only thing I wished were different was when I asked for water, I was offered bottled water. I avoid using plastic water bottles, so I pulled out a canteen and she said they only had soda and bottled water, I couldn't even get a cup of water, so I ate my food without any water.

Other than that, the food was good, but there's not a real point in me eating here if I can't drink any water.",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,2,1,3,WLBEuSbjreTRMD5tjioZUQ

All the meat was steaming hot as if they had just cooked each one individually before serving . Definitely fresh meat, salsa and shrimp . Extra salsa is on the side as always with taco shops but the flavors are great . Tacos are regular street taco size so 3 for me was like a good sized snack , 4 would have gotten me full I would say .

3517309,2017-08-28,5,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"Located in the same plaza as Other Mama, The Rice Shop, Zaytoon and others, Bomb Tacos took over the space formerly occupied by a couple other taco shops. But this is nothing like its predecessors. It's run by Robert Solano, formerly of Mundo, and he brings a level of sophistication to the food that other casual taco shops lacked. 

I got a platter with 2 carnitas and 1 al pastor, which came with vegetable rice and beans. Both tacos were amazing. The carnitas tacos full of tender morsels of pork with crisp edges and a good bit of heat. The al pastor also brings the heat but the pineapple sitting on top tempers it, somewhat. 

On another visit I tried the asada curly fries. I loved the charred edges of the asada that still managed to be tender in the center and packed some noticeable heat. The meat topped a large mound of curly fries along with tomatillo cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo to create a massive serving that's large enough to share or you can just pig out yourself for the ultimate cheat day meal.

For dessert I tried the churros and ice cream. It's a large portion good enough for 2 or 3 to share with crispy, cinnamon and sugar covered churros cut into small bite size pieces along with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. After the heat from the tacos, it was a nice way to end the meal.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,14,11,5,hmhesscqBgM6flKTPpLWwQ

The news is quite obviously spreading, as within a few minutes of arrival, the place was filled with customers. Though the menu may look familiar, the quality and taste of the food is refreshingly well done. The pricing falls in-between your go-to sit down Mexican Restaurant and your regular taco joint.

I got the following 5:
Al Pastor...A-Ok
Fish(sole)...pretty BOMB
Carnitas...interestingly BOMB...crispy, meaty pieces as opposed to shredded pork
Shrimp...FRICKIN' BOMB!
Crispy Beef Brisket...FRICKIN' BOMB!
I just love that each taco has it's own distinct flavor....so BOMB!

Horchata...Fresh, not powdered 
Chips and Salsa ($5) made fresh, served with salsa rojo, verde, and guacamole...BOMB

Service was great and food was tasty overall.

3602322,2017-11-05,1,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"Bomb Tacos are delicious. They earn their name. The best, to me? The fried shrimp tacos, the crunchy potato tacos (deep fried), and the al pastor tacos. Simply the best. Less appetizing were the asada fries, which they did with waffle fries instead of curly fries when I was there because they were out, and the quesadilla. On the former, the fries were greasy and salty. Not a fan.  On the latter, I've had better quesadillas at Rubio's. (But to be fair, Rubio's makes a mean steak and cheese quesadilla!)  Bomb was also out of churros when I was there so I cannot comment on that.  Then again, why run out of dessert, and one for which you are known, on a weekend??

The only other thing to point out is the atmosphere. It is in a strip mall that is not so quaint.  But the decor is super cute. The service is slow but friendly, and you should just leave enough time to enjoy. The music (at least on the day I went) was far too loud and obnoxious. You will quickly ignore this when you get your delicious tacos. The worst part of the atmosphere are the Generation X-ers and millennials that it attracts.  So pretentious and molly-coddled that it makes you unhappy to be around them. I mean, this is metrosexual, entitlement heaven in this place. Gringos galore! I don't mind gringos...after all, I am one.  But when we far, far outnumber Mexicans at a pretend authentic taco place, that's a bit of a heads-up about what this place is and isn't. It ain't authentic, that's for sure. But it is good.

First off, I wanted to order three plates of tacos and some chips and guac, and when I called to place the order the girl on the phone had no idea how to punch in the orders, and we ran around in circles for 15 minutes for her trying to get the order right. It really *wasn't* that difficult or complicated. I told her I needed the order for an hour out, and she said she would get it ready for that time. I knew I wouldn't be there for at least an hour and 15 minutes, but I wanted to make sure it was ready when I got there.

Fast forward, I'm on my way an hour and 15 minutes later and get a call as we're about to pull in- ""Oh hi, your order will be ready in 5 more minutes""......!!!! Sweet, so they forgot to even start MAKING my order. I get there, go inside, and the woman says 'Oh, just 5 more minutes' and I see them all scrambling in the back to make the order. Great. It's over 15 minutes past when it was supposed to be ready. I took an Uber there with a stop included so I could go in, pay, and get back in my Uber to my destination. Should have been easy.

Proceed to wait 10 more minutes for my order (putting it 25 minutes past when it should have been ready), mind you they were NOT AT ALL busy. They just literally forgot to make my order at the time they should have. And now me, and my pissed off Uber driver, are stuck waiting. They finally finish and I'm out the door with my 6 super small, thrown together tacos, 3 sides of rice and beans, 2 chips and guac for $50. Food tasted fine but GAWD not worth the price or the hassle or the extra tip I had to give my Uber driver for waiting so long.

I literally took extra precautions to make sure it was ready on time- and they still messed it up. So unprofessional.

The rice is a Guatamalan recipe. The beans are not refried.

I did not have to look very far when I scrolled across and found Bomb Tacos. After finally finishing up there and a jaunt at the park, it's now eating time. This taco restaurant is directly across the street so it's so convenient to where I was. Awesome! 

When I came in the cashier at the counter was swamped and informed us that it would be a 20-30 minute wait for our order. I informed here it was fine and placed my order with here. The lobby has Reggie type tunes playing and it is so vibrant feeling while I wait for my bomb tacos. The cashier brought our cokes out to us and directed me that she will bring our food to the table too.

I ordered the 3 tacos tacos with carne asada and I'm not one for all the cilantro and onions so I had them hold these. I only wanted cheese on them and sour cream on the side. When our order got here the steak had a red pigment to it. I was intrigued and first off thought they were undercooked, but was totally mistaken. The red on the steak is how it's cooked and they were delicious. The tacos were street style on corn shells and the steak was perfection itself. The $10.00 a plate for the tacos is so worth it. I can find no better end to the day than with some bomb tacos with green sauce and sour cream. It's perfection at its best!",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,18,14,5,LbGgQjI8awmp1bnoLVMr9g

However, the tacos were very tasty. I liked the crispy potato taco more than the two fish tacos. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the fish tacos are quite soft -- not crispy enough for my taste, but still good. The rice and beans that come with this combo are okay, but I've had better for less money and a shorter wait. I think I'll come back to sit in -- seems like to-go orders are pushed to the end of the kitchen list.

We ordered a quartet of street tacos, (2) carne asada, 1 each chicken and pastor.  The tiny kitchen was backed up so we had a very long wait, further exacerbating the shortage of available tables.  Another table was occupied an employee and friend who having their lunch.  We did sample the pickled carrots which were fine, but no better than those found elsewhere and the salsas were pretty ordinary as well.

I've heard a lot of hype behind Bomb Tacos. My office is in DTLV and they just opened their second location and people have been raving. Since this location is by my house, we figured we should check it out.

The service here is great. The people were very kind and were very patient with us because we were definitely trying to order the whole menu.

There were two items that really stood out - the fish tacos and the shrimp diablos! Like those two items alone were phenomenal and I would definitely be back for those! The fish tacos were probably the best fish tacos I have had in LV. The fish is battered perfectly and literally did not require any salsa. Same for the shrimp tacos. They were spicy but also so very good.

Now... I really wanted to love the potato taco but I was really not impressed with it. There was not much flavor and it was just not what I was looking for to fulfill my craving. I also felt this with the fried beef taco. Serious lack of flavor and pretty pricey. We also got carne asada and pastor tacos - both - meh. Also not impressed and the meat seemed either a little old or a little dry. I guess it was either a bad day or a little overpriced. I totally don't mind paying the premium if it's going to be BOMB - but we just didn't experience that.

Lastly, we ordered al pastor fries. Geez - when we were looking at them, we were SOOO hyped! Like YES, this is going to be amazing aaaaaand the fries were old. Legit dried inside. And we are fries people. It looked so great but the fries were legitimately dry! It was so sad!  Great to photograph but we probably ate less than a quarter of it before throwing it away. Sad face for wasting food!

Honestly - I will probably be back for the fish and shrimp tacos but that's about it. Those were bomb for sure, however, the other things, I probably won't be back for.

Oh man, the crispy beef brisket costs $3. I wouldn't mind paying $3 for a good taco, but it was so pathetic, it came out fried, bland, oily and a tiny bit of meat. I guess they cared about my cholesterol level: if you have fried food, you shouldn't have more than one piece of red meat. 

Gueros taco: just okay, not great, not bad, but I wasn't impressed. Their carrots were super thick, not really my style. Hot sauce isn't too flavorful either. I don't know why they got so many good stars. Or is it just my tastebud is broken? Anyway, it's just not for me. Not coming back.

I wish I could say everything was so bomb but unfortunately it was the opposite. My friend and I wanted to try something new so I looked to Yelp for suggestions and behold Bomb Tacos was recommended. We were pretty excited to try this place. We arrived around 8pm and placed our orders. There were about 2-3 ppl ahead of us and a group of ppl about 3-4 ppl total dining in so definitely not that busy for a Friday night. 
We placed our orders and I was sooo looking forward to the carne asada curly fries the most. We sit at the table right near the register and wait.... I kidd you not, we waited for almost an hr for our food!! We kept seeing ppl coming in and ordering and getting their food before us! I still can't fathom that no one not one single employee asked us if we were okay. Did it not register in their mind wtf we were doing sitting there for that long, oh you know we just wanted to spend our Friday night inside your restaurant and not eat or drink anything. The server didn't think it was odd that she never served us anything at all? 
My friend decided to check on our order about 40 min. later and her food was bagged up and ready! But where the hell was my order? They tell her it is almost ready but about 10-15 min. later they tell us they lost my order ticket. I had to place my order again and the owner gave me one taco on the house including a voucher for free lunch for 2 as an apology. So by the time we leave it's been an hr and when we get home my friend's food was already cold and soggy since her order was done way before mine. The tacos and carne asada curly fries weren't BOMB and that's mainly because the whole experience ruined it. I think I was pretty patient that night considering I was 9 months pregnant at the time, LOL. This place gets 3 stars instead of 1 because the owner did apologize and offered 2 free meals but I haven't even been back to use it, in fact I don't even know if I still have it.",XBvqoM6BaeAA-zdpB4Vctg,1,1,3,JVoju3F2aHWyvFLRk-8fzQ

5279327,2018-04-17,4,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"In a city where Tacos can be found up and down several roads east of Las Vegas Boulevard, not to mention on any number of 24/7 Bar menus for prices that frequently exceed ingredient quality, it was not until news broke of Robert Solano's Bomb Tacos opening a second location downtown that the decision to visit his Westside original became pressing, a stop late Friday finding the Chef and his team turning out the sort of Meats and Sauces rarely seen Stateside at prices so affordable.

Open now for just over a year on South Durango across from Desert Breeze Park, a location invisible driving South and hidden going North further handicapped by a subpar website and lack of Facebook Geo-tagging, it is likely surprising to most that Bomb Tacos has actually been around so long in the Plaza also harboring Other Mama and TC's Rib Crib, the simple signage probably not helping matters though those lucky enough to step inside will invariably be rewarded.

No stranger to the local dining scene, Solano's involvement in Mundo at World Market Center probably his most well-known role despite time previously spent at Michelin-starred Topolobampo in Chicago, guests entering Bomb Tacos will quickly find themselves thrust into a space full of hand-built furniture where Spanish tunes play loudly, the menu scrawled in Chalk to one side with additional items including Vegetarian options as well as Beverages also available.

Operating out of a tiny kitchen with no walk-in, the product assuredly fresh and Sauces made ""at least once"" daily as told by the affable owner, it is after assessing the options that diners are invited to make their requests at a window where money is exchanged, a brief wait of no more than ten minutes to follow with some items coming out quicker than others, though those desiring things to be 'coursed out' should make it known when placing their order. 

At this time a more full-service space than the one on Carson in DTLV, housemade Jamaica and Horchata for which Solano toasts his Rice to create a complex and nutty finish complimenting a collection of Mexican Sodas, it is wise for any who enjoy Chips and Salsa to begin with a basket additionally carrying made-to-order Guacamole for just $6, the fresh Chips a nice touch even though Tortillas are not made on-site while the dark Red Dip eschews heat in favor of smokiness.

Looking next at the Restaurant's eponymous item, a variety of braised or fried Meats and Vegetables offered beneath fresh toppings including Solano's signature Guajillo Pepper Sauce, it is no mistake that Bomb Taco's best-seller is the Carne Asada listed atop the menu for just $2.25, the cheapest item intended as a hook and barely making its money back considering the tender Sirloin's quality while thinly shaved Al Pastor is also a worthy contender for stomach space given its poignant aromatics that are carefully balanced with cubed Pineapple.
 
Further impressing with Fried Shrimp set-up against Purple Cabbage, the use of Cilantro Dressing instead of Peppers allowing Crustaceans to shine while those looking for a real punch in the mouth may instead upgrade to ""Diablo"" by way of Housemade Habanero Sauce, it is briefly stepping away from Tacos that guests will find Nachos, Burritos and Carne Asada Fries, the latter as messy as it is delicious with enough crispy coils and Beef to feed a group while the Tomatillo Salsa-soaked Flour Tortilla stuffed with Beans, Rice, Meat and Cheese should also be shared by all but those who are almost starving.

Capping individual Taco costs at $5, both the aforementioned Shrimp Diablo and ""Bistro"" version with Beef beneath fried Eggs still a good value as priced, a hidden gem on the menu is Solano's double-coooked Chorizo that comes as a sliced Link rather than ground and dry like so many others, the intrinsic heat used as an accent rather than overwhelming everything else and arguably the most delicious item available.

Not forgetting those with dietary exclusions, Corn and Flour Tortillas interchangeable, it is with a nod to Vegetarians as well as Vegans that Bomb Tacos additionally offers three Meat-free options including earthy Mushrooms cooked snappy as well as diced Potatoes that mimic the texture of Ground Beef with lots of Seasoning, though those not harboring such restrictions should probably consider the juicy Beef Brisket on a light and crunchy Shell instead.

****Truly a hard scene to differentiate oneself in, the competition abundant and prices highly variable from Strip to Suburbs, there is no doubt that Bomb Tacos is amongst the West Side's best in terms of authenticity, quality and price - the too loud for comfort music, lack of Dessert or Beer and poor visibility (both online and from the street) notwithstanding.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,13,4,BKqobGFYhs5Q09rB97dU1w
5280903,2018-03-01,5,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"Bomb Tacos came highly recommended to me by one of my coworkers. As a taco connoisseur, I knew I had to give them a try! Please keep in mind that I ordered only their vegan options.

My friends and I arrived right when the restaurant opened. It was a very strategic move on our behalf to avoid extended wait times. Why did it take approximately 40 minutes to make two orders of carne asada fries and 12 tacos?

I ordered the vegan ""carne asada"" fries and cauliflower tacos. On a positive note, the cauliflower tacos were very innovative and pretty yummy. On a scale from 1-5, I'd give the tacos a solid 3. Now, the vegan ""carne asada"" fries were made with mushrooms instead of beef. I was super excited to try them because I know that mushrooms generally have a meaty taste. They also used curly fries, which are my fave, so I knew it had to be bomb. I'm not sure what was saltier, the mushrooms or the curly fries. One forkful exceeded my entire sodium intake for the day. I thought, maybe I just got a bad batch, but my carnivorous friends had the same experience with their carne asada fries.

2 al pastor tacos - meat was juicy, had tons of flavor, and there were chunks of the grilled pineapple with the meat to give it some extra sweetness
Carne asada taco - lots of spice on the meat but not heat-spicy, meat was so tender!
Mushroom taco - the mushrooms were so hearty and paired well with the salsa, lots of flavor in this one, too
Carnitas taco - meat was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, seasoned just right
Shrimp taco - lightly breaded and fried shrimp, had a buttery flavor that was delicious! Cooked perfectly and had a good amount in the taco
Crunchy potato taco - filling was like mashed potatoes, topped with cotija and pico de gallo, super crunchy and surprisingly flavorful

Only thing I wasn't into were the pickled carrots from the salsa bar. I usually love them from other places but theirs were soft, almost like they'd been boiled, and had a floral flavor to them. Otherwise, the tacos live up to their name.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,1,0,4,VdrBIGgDDFe1SL2j7C0Erg

Seating is pretty limited, but the space is so inviting & vibrantly decorated. Customer service was amazing. The cashier and (I'm assuming) the owner were extremely friendly and helpful in explaining their menu since this was my first time coming here as well as my friends'. They do offer combo plates, typically with 3 tacos served with beans and rice, but my friends and I decided to go with their a la carte menu since we wanted to try a variety of their tacos. 

Out of the four that I ordered- carnitas, al pastor, rock shrimp, and crispy chicken- the al pastor and crispy chicken were definitely my favorite; however, all four tacos were extremely flavorful. I also tried the fish taco that my friend had ordered and it was AMAZING. Like, my mouth is watering thinking about it. The flavor profiles of all the tacos were so delicious, and you can tell that all their ingredients are fresh. I also ordered their horchata which is homemade, and OMG I need more of it in my life.

The owner (again- I'm assuming since I didn't ask for his name) brought over to our table two of their homemade habanero salsas. While I didn't personally try them, my friend is able to vouch & say that they both complemented the tacos exceptionally well & didn't compromise the flavors of the tacos.

So, despite my reservations about the price point, I'll give this one a thumbs up.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,3,1,4,F5k8ReDUVXWLtLuiLuFBfw
5751710,2017-05-12,0,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,The tacos here are amazing. They have traditional street tacos as well as daily unique specials. We came in last night and had the al pastor and rock shrimp tacos. They were both excellent but we did favor the rock shrimp. They mentioned their specials tonight would be pork belly and grilled octopus tacos so we will definitely be going back.,Z3lreigIFNm8IdmT4sr_6g,2,1,5,b_NEmavspG6-nF-zniD3oA

So I walked over to the Bomb Tacos and I'm pleasantly surprised! The tacos are the Bomb! I ordered only one fish taco and devoured it. So, I ordered another!

We have missed our taco spot back home so much and other place weren't cutting it on our side of Vegas so what the heck lets try it. We purchased four Carne asada tacos which came out to $9 and some change (ouch a little pricey). We also waited 15 mins for our order. As we were waiting my husband whispered ""Wtf these tacos better be the business."" Lol finally we received our food and you know what is was worth it. Best tacos that I've had in Vegas.",42D-hgfYwmWsNCvX81ujjg,0,0,5,P6Tso2qDWPiShme1LSXGrg

5891461,2018-06-07,0,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"Would rate it 2.5 for customer service.  The staff was friendly but I wouldn't consider this an ""authentic"" Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the 3 taco platter with one shrimp taco, one carnitas taco, and one carne asada taco.  The only one that actually had flavor was the shrimp taco. My husband got the asada burrito and rated it a six on a scale of 1-10.  We got our food pretty fast but they literally had no condiments. No limes ,  no salsa ,  no nothing. Everything was out of stock.  It wasn't until we were getting close to finishing our food that they restocked it.  They only restocked the salsas, they didn't take out any limes.  What are tacos without lime and salt ?! It also took us a while to find the trash can which was all the way in the back of the house by the restrooms.   (They only had one trash can).  The cashier was very nice and friendly but I just feel like the hospitality was not there.  They only offer salsa and pickled jalapeños for your tacos.  No limes or anything else.  It is a little small taco spot which is understandable but I feel like I would not come back. For what they offer , their prices should be a lot less.  $40 for a burrito and 3 tacos w/ 2 fountain drinks is ridiculous .",JB6RHkBWiSv-HYt1yid0Yw,0,0,2,4RbjyBLwYMdhfY6AdPuWOw
5893404,2017-12-21,0,82g1PwX5FvclqqdjJHcVNA,"Did somebody say tacos, I mean Bomb Tacos???? This place delivered just that :-P My husband & I visit the Las Vegas area a few times a year traveling from the Bay Area, California. During our last trip (Oct) it was a must to find some legit tacos (all past locations we were left disappointed, felling that Vegas doesn't know how to do tacos). Coming from an area with a huge Mexican / Latino community the bar is set pretty high. I consider myself a taco snob, meaning my last meal would be tacos. 

We arrived just as they opened, and was immediately greeted by staff. Together, we got a combo of carne asada, carnitas, & fish tacos. While waiting for our order, Robert (owner) came out to chat it up with us a bit. We were talking about where we're from, and that he has interest in San Francisco.... and asked how an establishment like his would do in our area with such huge competition. This place feels more like a taqueria for hipsters, and with the right location, it would be a hit. 

Here comes the food. My mouth immediately begins to salivate as the plate reaches the table. Since it was so early, the salsa bar wasn't quite ready, but Robert served us some to our flavor preference. As we took our first bite, my husband & I eyes met, seeing straight through them reading BOMB Tacos. They were delicious!!! Robert offered a bit hotter salsa from the back, a habanero salsa. He did place a verbal warning on it. Pffft, the hotter the better, and it was amazing. The quality of ingredients was recognized and makes Bomb Tacos presence be known. 

We knew immediately that we will be back each and every time we are in the area. Awesome food, awesome personable service, with a trendy atmosphere. Thank you Robert, and kuddos to your kick ass spot!",D6PqHiPf1jwiXkDNBNx0Jg,0,0,5,WnFv-CqdiUXJRv5qrqJbBg
