734026,2011-12-23,0,bymQ0lRnBar5scP4FERioQ,"This is a good example of a Las Vegas original: A ""locals pub."" These are places to drink, eat, watch sports and gamble (sorry, I mean ""game"") all at once, or just do one or the other of the above...and either with groups of friends, a date, or just by yourself. Mulligans meets these expectations well with solid, consistent food and service. Seems to be a favorite with local law enforcement, since whenever we drive by, there's usually one or two police cars parked there (for the food, of course, as it's a safe neighborhood!)

Mulligans is not too much to look at on the outside, but inside you can either head left to the bar area or right to the restaurant area, both decorated in Southwestern style, with cool movie posters and Western memorabilia on the walls and TV's to watch Sunday football on. In our visits, we've only been to the restaurant side, but people on the bar side look like they're having fun watching sports and playing video poker.

What you look for in a locals pub in terms of food is what you get at Mulligans- standard bar food with your typical appetizers, hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta and breakfast items with a couple of cool twists (try the breakfast burrito or the Cobb salad to see what I mean.) Plus, if you are like me, the type of person who needs hash browns, not ""breakfast potatoes"" with your eggs and bacon, they've got that here, unlike some other locals pubs. We've been there for breakfast and lunch and there are various specials (both food and drink) depending on when you are there. But even at full price, it won't break the bank.

Being a locals pub, you can expect mostly good service with the occasional off-day- once when we were there, the waitress took forever to notice us and took a while to take our order and return with drinks...and then she got the order wrong. But the other times we've been, service has been good and the wait staff is definitely helpful and friendly.

Three stars rather than five because neither the menu nor beer selections are as broad as at other locals pubs and having been there a few times now, we've not had to really look hard to choose our favorite items, but for a place with consistent service and well-executed standard fare, it's a good place to have in your rotation.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,0,0,3,1vxvtShT28LLCh2SIHlwVA

2069241,2010-06-12,0,bymQ0lRnBar5scP4FERioQ,"Mulligan's Border is one of a boat load of taverns around Las Vegas and while it has your standard bar and video poker it also has really good food and great service. They take their bar food to the next level by understanding how to prepare and serve it.

It is fair to say that I have had just about everything on the menu there and I have not found anything that disappointed me. My personal standard is just a simple burger cooked medium rare. The burger comes to me juicy and tasty and the bun is toasted correctly so it does not fall apart. There is something to be said for a good burger and that alone has kept me and my wife coming back for more. We call this place our ""Cheers"" because everyone seems to know our names.

They do not have a huge menu, but the menu they have they do well and I like that. You can tweak your meal here and their and they do not put up a fuss and if the server does not know if it can be done he talks to the chef and they get it done. Like I said, service is top notch. They may not ""Crumb the Table"" but they do make your experience there as good as possible and that too is commendable.

We tried other pubs nearby that state they are for locals, but they weren't for us.  we like a place that is friendly, good food and good price with a chill environment.

We went to Mulligan's this past Saturday night and found our home. This place was awesome.

We ordered some wings and onion rings along with a sandwich we shared. the food was great, absolutely no complaints.

what really set this place apart from all others was the customer service and friendliness of the staff. even though this was an obvious locals place, they made us feel welcomed and made sure everything was perfect.  we had about 3 beers each and wandered over to the poker machines to throw some money away.

If i were better at names, i would shout out, but unfortunately I'm not, but i am comfortable in saying youll probably have a good time. 
  I did have one friend who he and his friends (all guys, of course) were kicked out for cursing during a game. On the one hand it's during a game at the bar, on the other hand, how many bartender ladies are sick of men's s***? There are plenty of other bars you can be crass at. Not everyone wants to hear it. So I actually respect her decision to kick them out, as I respect my friend's decision to be mad about it. (He says they weren't being that bad, but I've met him. :3 )
I've never eaten in the dining room specifically 'cause that ain't my style. But as for the food...AMAZEBALLS, as the kids say. 
   Have you ever had a BLT with peanut butter?? If you conjure up any tiny desire to try it out, YOU MUST. I figured I might like it, I had no idea HOW MUCH I would like it. Turns out peanut butter is incredibly complimentary to bacon. Must try! 
  If you're not as adventurous, the More Than A Turkey Melt is also incredible. The bread alone is grilled with garlic butter, and I'll leave the rest to your imagination.
   Someone mentioned a southwestern theme, and I honestly never noticed. (More noticeable in the dining area), but I did just notice the 2 tiny wall spaces where there is southwestern paraphernalia, but mostly alcohol themed neon and game posters.

The bartender was awesome as well as the other guests in the bar. Everyone was so friendly and down to earth. We snacked on some wings and french fries which were pretty good. We literally only had a babysitter for our child for 2 hours, so my only regret was that we wasted an hour of it at PT's when we could have been here the whole time! Thanks for being awesome guys. We'll be back!",k2BcSkC2ofzPfKtX0Steiw,0,0,5,52V8VDRj0WM-BKG4I_FRlQ

Good bartenders. When we were done gaming, some people came in who wanted to game so we were asked to move to a table. 

We moved to the table and within minutes an order of nachos appeared. We all looked at each other wondering who ordered it. The bartender came over and said it was on the house, thanks for moving. Nice touch!

We ordered some food, I went with the bacon cheeseburger. Applewood smoked bacon and Angus beef....really good. Fresh fine chopped lettuce, tomato, onion, all for $8.95! That's a burger bargain right there! My friend had steak fajitas and the steak was cooked perfectly. 

This is customer service you don't see too much anymore in corporate Vegas. I haven't been to other Mulligans, but if they are all like this I will definitely frequent their establishments more often. Good food, great service!!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,2,4,zMMVHTZzX59gSv6NZ0DWEA
