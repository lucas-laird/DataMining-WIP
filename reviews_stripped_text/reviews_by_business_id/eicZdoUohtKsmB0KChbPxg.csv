Good as it looked. Next table side presentation of ceviche made just the way you like it.

The salsa was very bitter and not edible. The soup was store bought alphabet soup, not anything remotely Mexican. The queso was just melted and charred onto a skillet and was very rubbery, so you cannot even eat it with chips. The cheese enchilada had more tortilla than cheese, the wrong kind of cheese, and the sauce almost made me gag. The tamale had store bought bland tomato sauce on top and just tasted bad.

1364377,2015-07-21,9,eicZdoUohtKsmB0KChbPxg,"You know?..there are plenty Mexican restaurants in town, but every now and then you you run into one that totally stands out from all the others and lucky for me this is the case with Las Tarascas Michoacanas. The food is amazingly good!
 The place is nice and clean with minimal decorations and although it lacks some more Mexican colors, the arches on the wall are a nice touch giving it a feel of authenticity.
 Service was great, this is a family owned restaurant and they really make you feel like you are part of it. They constantly check on you to refill your beverages and to make sure you're enjoying your meal to the fullest.
I ordered the gallina Zamorana, thats chicken covered with a special strawberry sauce and mushrooms, something I never had before and it was delicious, specially with the freshly handmade tortillas. We also tried the enchiladas Do√±a Andrea and we loved them but let me warn you, this are authentic Mexican enchiladas and not the ones most people are accustomed to here on the states, so if you're a ""green grow"", I recommend you try the regular enchiladas.
We really had a great time here at Las Tarascascas, ask for Viri (I think that was her name) she will definitely take good care of you! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu that sounded delicious, the only bad part is that I live so far from this place, but as my friend would say..... I usually don't hang around on this side of town but when I do I eat at Las Tarascas Michoacanas.....don't stay hungry my friends..
try them!

We were sat by the entrance in a 
booth to what they added a  table which I think was a little hard to get in and out for the ones that sat inside the booth. 

They have a great selection on the menu, we all order different plates and they were all pretty tasty. They don't have a drink menu but do have good drinks. I had the ""michoacana"" it's good but I just wish they had different tequila selections. They have different brands but it's all silver tequila. 

There was a duo playing songs for free (tipping is highly recommended on my part) it made the ambiance just perfect. 

If I were a local this would probably be my go to spot. Customer service is average, they are nice and check on you plenty of times.

5123049,2016-05-09,5,eicZdoUohtKsmB0KChbPxg,"So disappointed with this place after seeing it was a 4.5 star joint and I seldom make it out to the beautiful section of Northeast Vegas (cough). 

We walked in and 90% of the customers were Mexican...usually a good sign and that's when it all went downhill...

We ordered: Corundas Tarascas (13.99) and Bracerito a La Meseta Tarasca For Two (38.99)
and here's what went wrong:

THE WAIT
Waited almost 90 minutes for our food. Even the waiter said, ""You guys haven't gotten your food yet??!!"" When he saw our drowning looks after an hour and fifteen minutes...and we were close to just leaving.

DISH UNO
The corundas tarascas was supposed to have pieces of pork, I counted 4 small pieces in the sauce. $14 for some corn bread in a red sauce...no bueno.

DISH DOS
The Meseta Tarasca for two...I've had these type of mixed ""paradilla"" (or whatever each restaurant likes to name them) plates before many times and I'm familiar with how they're grilled and how they come out...it's like fajitas for two with a shitload more meat (hence $40 tag). The entire dish was completely burned and overcooked, embarrassing to even bring to a table. The steak was beyond well done..gray and tough, destroyed. The chorizo was black and dried out, inedible. The pounded chicken breast was so overcooked and tough I couldn't cut through it with a regular table knife. The beef ribs were both burnt to black...and the sauce that comes out on top of the dish that many yelpers took photos of (and is on their website) was non-existent. 

ACCOUNTABILITY
The waiter saw we weren't too happy and apologized and said he'd bring the manager over. I guess he knew he served up a plate of embarrassment because I didn't even ask to speak to anyone (wouldn't want them to replace the burnt food anyway because who knows how that really goes) but an older woman comes over and I said, ""We waited an hour and a half for our meal and look, it's completely burnt."" Her response, ""Yes, ok."" with a smile...and that was that.

THE SERVICE
Had a guy and a girl serving us...very friendly, but totally incompetent. We were asked if we wanted corn or flour tortillas. We said, flour...we got neither...20 minutes after the food arrived I had to ask for them. Also, the mixed meat dish was supposed to come with a skillet of melted Mexican cheese as is shown on the menu, on their website and is on all the yelp pics. When I asked for the cheese the waitress said it doesn't come with cheese. I then had to point it out to her on the menu that it does in fact come with the ""melted cheese""...""oh ok, I'll get that for you."" This was 30 minutes after the food had already arrived and I was just wanting to bounce...maybe she didn't want the extra work of grabbing what I paid for or it was her first day of work...I'll go with the first.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,8,4,2,qJpwFAqQeX2-egakCJm4HA

Definitely make sure to stop by and try this authentic Mexican restaurant.",aZM1rkoKvb99DRLK2lIxgQ,0,0,5,9-ioHHl03MeACGaXnFX6Uw

There was a mariachi band that played some great songs for us . i give it two stars because of the food. The beans were horrible . they tasted like can beans . the sopa de fideo had no flavor , couldn't made it better my self. I asked for alot of onions and limons to give all the food flavor. The drinks are delicious bit food is terrible. Fell bad saying because they were really friendly but i have to be honest. Its to expensive for the quality. I think all the comments are misleading .",bEAKp5S6Lhvy9rnEP1nYNg,1,0,2,uvV7OaN7AJQvdlNpe4aVQQ

First time coming here and I will be returning!
We went for my friends birthday party.
We had a party of 15 people and I can't complain about anything. We sat down and right away they got our drinks ordered and appetizers and in less than 5 minutes we were eating! Food was full of flavor. 
Lalo was our server he was very attentive and on top of everything. I didn't even have to ask for a refill, because he was very attentive and he made us all feel welcomed. 
I really recommend this place!",FA4t-eDNuCaZpTemZPocFA,3,1,5,swRNjEUYTbB02PH6HiO-yQ

Everything was so delicious! We plan on going back again and again to work our way through this very unusual menu. Cascor and Manny gave delightful and professional service.

""The Best Mexican Food I've Had In Las Vegas.""

Food/Drink: For starters,¬† I ordered the combo of the Beef Tamal and the Chicken Enchiladas which came out pretty yummy. First it was served with the bean dip and chips. The chips were fresh and the bean dip was hot and tasty. Also their salsa is to die for! (it really doesn't need too many seasonings in it because the flavors of the chili are fresh, well ground up, and blended). It was also served with a soup that came with it on the side as a nice little surprise and that also was very tasty.

Service: when I first walked into this place I was greeted with a smile. The servers here look very polished and the ambiance here is warm. From the waiters bringing timely service and having the food brought out in a short amount of time to the manager coming out to offer discounts for his new business all seem too good to be true from a place that look like it was a hole in the wall. 

Atmosphere: the inside of this place looks absolutely fantastic the TVs are set up to listen to music and watch Spanish videos and the decor will make you feel like you are in a five-star classy yet traditional restaurant in Mexico. Only reason why I gave it before is because from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall and that takes away from how wonderful this place truly is!

Price: I paid a little less than $11 for a 2 item combo which came with a very generous portion of hot beans, salsa, and even soup. The prices here are reasonable for what you get!

Parking: there is parking available in the front of the restaurant.

MY THOUGHTS? I am absolutely amazed by this place and can't wait to tell my family and friends about it. I have now found somewhere on the east side that I can enjoy coming to instead of being worried about weird smells, insects, and the food tasting like its been sitting for hours. Also, the service with a smile is definitely a nice touch. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: just try it! is my suggestion! Take it from a hard core foodie like me who takes my food personally....the food and service is 5 star!",nY9FUScv1oLEo-XNjOcr4g,3,4,5,R5FYLX1ZbBNFfLRIIacYfg
5823978,2015-07-11,0,eicZdoUohtKsmB0KChbPxg,The service was amazing- and not solely due to not being as busy.  They were accommodating and attentitive in addition to having amazing soup and salsa to start out the meal.  I would recommend the hotter salsa due to better flavor than the regular just ask the server for the hotter stuff.  We did the 3 item combo definitely recommend the cheese enchilada and chili verde burrito.  They smother the cheese enchilada with cheese.,Y0bcRgnSz_4AN3iDVbNQgg,0,0,5,0a9nVdmkrRbM6VXLfGWzkA
