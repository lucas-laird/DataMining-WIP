Nacho chips tasted stale and they're stingy with the nacho cheese. You'll end up with just chips before halfway to finish. Ordered chalupas recently... They must've reheated the crust. It didn't look or taste fresh. Again, lack of meat. I threw it away. Ordered a chicken quesadilla and got a lack of cheese quesadilla with 5 scattered chicken pieces. That would be my last trip here.

Take the extra minute to visit the other location off skypointe. They always give the proper amount of toppings.",9Kgz60mivLD10Xrs5WB5Zw,0,0,1,n-9Upt4yg4It71S1rCTpcA

Let me start off by saying I love Taco Bell and I probably eat t 3 times a week if not more. This location every time has disappointed me and I go at different times if the day and it's all the same. One time I went and the person working the register told me it was going to be a while . The last time I went is probably gonna be the last time I go. I was on my way to work, 30 minutes before I had to be at work. I order and 15 minutes go by. I ask where my food is and they say it's being made there are people in front  of me. Okay cool. 10 more minutes go by and people who ordered after me are  getting their food . I say I ordered before them and then I am told it goes out in order of size of order. They assure me it's coming out soon. A few more moments go by and the guy Who took my order said it didn't go though on their screen and they will make it right now . I say no I don't have time just give Me my money back I'm going to be Late to work now. He gives me my money back after asking his manager if he can. Then tells me he'll make it and give it to me for free but at this point I have i speed to work because I am already late . I don't know if staff is slow , if they are understaffed or if they just don't care but I've never been so disappointed every time I go there. I hope t gets better but it never does ! 

I would also like to tell the managers to know the promos ! On their drive thru window it says get a 25$ gift card get a free meal but NO ONE knew what I was talking about and couldn't give it to me.",CvjcP28OCXgr0j2Q5kswnA,0,0,1,lkKZTELtVE6Rkp6nJ0Yo7A

2123499,2017-05-07,0,MTx-Zdl_KcU_z9G832XAjg,Came here for a late night snack. Drive thru was busy and VERY slow. We waited for 15 mins and was assured all 6 items were in our bag. Go to drive out and of course we are missing one. No one would answer the door or phone so we waited another 15 mins in line. They weren't very apologetic or offered to really do anything for the inconvenience. Was told they can't answer the phone because it's in the back and it would slow the line. Just seems like they wasted more time by not answering and quickly getting what we were missing instead of pissing us off and stopping the whole line to figure out what the problem was.,ANE-UuoNqdNfVNnnpPyWfQ,0,0,1,K1jRKJ-_rOnhz5ybr0oHTQ

Mmmmm salad taco, that was worth 89 cents! Not. Same day my entire order tasted like cardboard and the Hawaiian lady at the window was completely rude. If I see her at the window after placing my order, I just keep driving thru the line, don't need her attitude. The boys who work there are funny, forgetful but funny. Was once given 3 drinks and no straws, so I had to park and go inside for them, he apologized and all was forgiven. Be an airhead and polite and I'll forgive you, but be an airhead and rude?

Then, the girl who took our order had us repeat ourselves at least 5 times. We should've checked the bag before we left, because the ENTIRE order was wrong, including missing items that we paid for.

People were honking their horns.  It was RIDICULOUS!  But, alas, the 2nd car in front of me FINALLY left the window, the car in front of me got their stuff and pulled off.  When I approached the window, the young gal was very sincere when she looked at me and said, 'I'm so sorry for your wait.  Would you like a free cinnamon twist for the inconvenience?'. I couldn't leave a 1 Star after that.
This seems to be a consistent problem at this location.  WHY???  Can the employee NOT ask the person at the window to pull ahead and someone will bring their order out to them if that particular order is holding things up??
SERIOUSLY, find a solution!!  Staff is always pleasant, food is good and fresh, but after a long day at work, sometimes we just want to pick up something quick, eat it and relax.",HUUOllovCmPyzcgBwUM1vA,0,0,3,8YXyJgWtLrwITMlIlwX3Ng

For a Taco Bell this is one of the better locations. The food is consistent and they've never forgotten anything through the drive through. (Sucks big time when that happens) We've never dined in so I can't say how the inside looks or how clean it is. For me that's usually the first thing I want to know. 

One of the best things they added was the salsa verde. My son is always upset because he wants to use hot sauce like mom and dad, but it was too spicy for him. Now he use about 2 packets per taco. ""Don't forget my green sauce mom."" Lol

Honestly there's not much more to say about a fast food joint. We usually frequent this establishment on a night we need something easy, fast and close.",7S2wwOSVSRn4CEZdtQKG_Q,3,5,4,UrngYfT6p3nODopogwVzTg
