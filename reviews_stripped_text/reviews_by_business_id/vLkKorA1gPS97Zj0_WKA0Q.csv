Food however, other than a couple of notable dishes, was mediocre for this type of fine dining. Amuse bouches were interesting and breads very good. Highlights were the Loup de Mer and Foie Gras appetizers and the Dorade with risotto entree. The rabbit, pork, and lobster entrees were very underwhelming and plating is strange as all dishes come out in multiple separate plates/bowls rather than one composed dish. Desserts again come in multiple separate components and highlight was chocolate souffl√© but none were stellar.

I made the reservation two weeks before and I had emailed someone off of their website - I heard back right away and got a table for 9PM on a Saturday night, which I thought was great. I personally thought the decor was beautiful...understated, modern but classy. 
I had told the reservationist that I preferred to eat vegan and when I was seated, the waiter brought it up and went through the menu with me to point out what would be suitable for me and how vegetarian choices could be changed. They also adjusted the amuse for me as well. Points off for the fact that one thing was definitely not vegan and the cream sauce it sat in had a film over it. It happened to be delicious though, so no big deal!

The first time I actually flew into Vegas because Pierre was in town and running the restaurant. Last time I was there he was not so I got to experience both. The quality and service are impeccable. 

The most interesting thing about this place is that he is always giving two or three extra items on the side of every dish. Last time I was there we did a 5 course tasting and I counted the number of different tastes we tried..in terms of items...from amuse bouche to the little petit desserts that are complimentary. All in all there were about 27 different things I tried. What is so crazy is that 25/27 were amazing. I would have been content filling my belly which just one of them. The items that I thought were not amazing were not bad...they were good but different. So I cannot knock it for anything except for that it didn't meet my taste buds. The presentation was there, the ingenuity and creativity was there, the quality was there, the preparation was there. It just didn't work for me. 

I have been to a lot of places in Vegas...from Carnevino to Picasso, etc, etc. Twist by far stands out. It's at least a step or two above everyone. It's a step above Picasso. Picasso is great...but Twist is just one more notch above. 

I highly recommend this place...it is one of my favorite restaurants from all that I have tried in all the different places I have been...which is saying something since I eat out a lot and I travel a lot!",kDzyuFb8remWHhj8fBHB1Q,0,0,5,HEzHBwnSFyYAgJ9-OIcu-w
362255,2010-07-15,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,The best French restaurant I've ever been to. Love the fact that traditional French cuisine is served in such a modern setting.  My colleagues and I all had different dishes and we all end up sharing. Order anything on the menu and you should not be disappointed. Kudos to the pastry chef too because our meals finished off nicely with a his surprises. Sure they are pricey but we were well fed.

377318,2011-10-06,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"As others say below, this is a very experimental place. It's not cheap, and it's not a ""classic"" tasting menu. The concept is captured in the name - not like Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory (emphasis on the Factory) - but in Twist. It truly is a twist of ingredients, preparations, and tastes. And if you are adventurous, it's amazing. If you like the other places I named earlier, you'll hate this and run back to your bucket of chicken across the street.

First off, the entrance is spectacular. From the moment you set foot in the Mandarin hotel you leave the strip and are in another place. A calm place, and a relaxing place. Getting off on the 23rd floor, you walk through a candle lit hallway to the maitre d' who immediately greets you and escorts you to your table. I could do without the pause to print out something like a receipt for her records (tacky) but that's a small point.

The space is wonderful. It's modern, just bright enough to not be annoying, and the views are enough Vegas to be there, but not so much that you feel like you need to hit a George Wallace show. From the hanging butterflies in the entrance to the hanging bubble lights throughout... spot on.

We had the 6 course tasting menu. As others have mentioned, it is really more like 18 courses as each course comes with three dishes. Unlike other tasting menus I've had (and there have been many) the portions are quite large. Be aware that the main courses are fit for an a la carte main course. Pace yourself. You'll need it.

We learned a long time ago to not do the wine pairing. I love wine pairings, but after a pre-dinner Champagne, the wife and I can be too drunk to remember anything else. Get a bottle. The markup is incredible, but the selection has enough variety that you'll find something you can work with.

The food is... different. No, interesting. No, surprising. No, shocking. No, (consults thesaurus). No, all of those. And really good.

I don't remember all the specifics (taking notes is tacky) but one course sticks out in my mind - julianne radishes beneath a robust red wine gelato. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Different. Delicious. Shocking. Amazing.

The seafood is fresh, the preparation perfect, the presentation excellent, and the variety can't be messed with.

The service is impeccable without being stuffy or overbearing. Sure, they walk you to the bathroom (I always find this both helpful and odd), but they don't have a ""character"" like some other places. The wait staff seemed like they were enjoying their jobs - and if you didn't like something (which is possible) they were ok with that. If you didn't finish a course, they weren't insulted but rather interested in what worked and what didn't for you.

There are a lot of deserts to the menu and I can't stress that the portions are quite large. You will be exhausted by the end of this, but in a good way. Your palet will be exhausted, too. It's a food workout.",3lWVKWVA0DYEMIMJwFpI4g,3,2,5,Hd1OGdVNnz1P8o7ugPz5yw

We tried the 5-course tasting menu, which was an adventure into creative first-class and inventive cuisine. The meal started with complimentary amuse bouches, which was a variety of Chef's original creations - gin and tonic gels in a martini glass, mini souffl√©, and housemate breads served with hand-cranked butter from France (incredibly deliciously). Appetizers included a truly original and smooth house made pate, perfectly prepared grilled trout with citrussy sauce and main course of New Zealand venison with Au gratin potatoes, green beans and julianeed beets with a unique savory sorbet that served as a gravy. Meat was, of course, perfectly cooked with an amazingly lean texture and the sides and sauces were delicious. For dessert, 5 different preparations of pastries, sorbets, chocolate and fruit - beautifully presented, unique and so good!  Each plate was beautiful to look at, and included a variety of tastes, colors, and textures.  Exceptionally attentive wait staff, extremely knowledgeable about the food, who expand on the attributes of each dish in some detail and who clearly enjoyed describing the journey as it continued to unfold.

399462,2017-05-03,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"This review was for my visit a day after Valentines Day. Twist has always been on that upper echelon level of food in my opinion and to me was a big splurge that I wished to do back in High School. It wasn't the smartest idea back then and it didn't end up happening but the restaurant has always been on my mind. Fast Forward a couple years and I'm walking up to the Mandarin Hotel and ready to take the elevator up and and walk down that dimly lit hallway into the restaurant. 

Service: Hits almost all of the big Forbes standards as every staff member used my last name, wine list introduced to the host, Excellent knowledge of menu, drinks, pairing, etc. Very interesting how Twist is home to one of the few Master Sommeliers in the world. 5 star service all around as should be expected.

Food: The good stuff and most memorable part of the meal. We decided to do Ala Carte and we began with the foie gras as a starter, Wild Turbot for me and Diver Scallops for my significant other. We ended our course with a tasting of Chef Pierre's favorites. And the greatest and most exciting part was finding out that Chef Pierre himself was in the kitchen! I'm sure he played a part in the execution of meals as everything was truly memorable. From the generous Amuse Bouches given out before, between, and after each dish to the dishes themselves. The presentation was gorgeous and matched the design of  the restaurant. Modern, sleek, and elegant. Everything is minimal but plays a part. All of the dishes are separated into various parts so you can enjoy the flavors of each item in a certain order as you willingly take your tastebuds on a journey. To me the epitome of great food is when it can invoke involuntary emotion and bring forth fond memories. This moment hit when I took a bite of the shrimps that was part of my Turbot dish. A ridiculous smile came up on my face and all I could feel was this sense of Joy. It was that moment that I knew no matter how much I spent here, this was the type of food that was worth it. 

Thoughts: I've studied a lot of reviews before coming here as it was a debate between here and Picasso. Although I have yet to try Picasso I chose Twist because it appealed to me more. The modern design drew me in and the modern flair and experimentation seemed exciting. To those that complain the staff is rude or stuffy, I'm sure there may or have been staff members that were but also it's a mental thing. If you go in thinking people will look down on you that's all you're going to react to. Go in with a sense of adventure and focus on your love of food. It's alot of money and of course overpriced for just food. But when you pay for these places you're paying for the memories and experiences just like how some people spend hundreds on concert tickets, or traveling. There's alot of factors that play into a good dining experience and I feel Twist definitely knocked it out of the park as seen in me writing this review almost 4 months later.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,0,0,5,OyBW_9TyIo0peSKw_H04Jg

I called them a few days ago and made a reservation. The concierge was very nice and polite. She confirmed the date, time, number of people and phone # with me. Two days before I flew to Vegas, I received a reminder call from them and then I called them back because I had to change the number of people attending the restaurant. ""No problem at all, Ms. XXX. We can't wait to see you on Saturday"" is the first sentence I heard from them. At that point I am already in love of this place!

I arrived on time on Saturday, and from that point on everyone starts addressing me as Ms. XXX. I am so flattered! As my table was not ready, the hostess led me to a small bar inside the restaurant and then the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink and whether I need something to read while I wait. Turns out the wait was less than two minutes, then my server escorted me to the table next to the window, overseeing the strip. Soon after the waiter brought a new drink I just ordered from the bar to my table. What a great service! I have already downloaded the menu and read several reviews, but I was still debating between √† la carte and tasting menu. Then my waiter told me they recently changed the tasting menu but the new menu was not yet available to download. However, that in fact made my decision a lot easier. I ordered:

Langostine 5 Ways
Dover Sole & Crevette (recommended by my waiter)
John Dory

The dishes are simply artistry and precision. The presentation may look simple but the flavor is extraordinary yet balanced and textures are complex. Like other reviewers, I was totally blown away with the Langoustine. They are heavily influenced by Asian flavors and these five offerings are just marvelous. The John Dory is also great, easily the best I had in years. Even the bread, I am being offered by three different kinds and two kinds of butters. However, because I was just too full after entr√©e, I couldn't even attempt to order desserts. At this date I am still kicking myself for that mishap. The service? Polite, efficient and friendly. Top notch.

My experience at Twist was definitely the one I will never forget. I simply just can't stop thinking about it and I am already busy planning my next visit with family and friends. Twist (and Mandarin Oriental), you totally win me over.",3wAG34DtH2-n16jz5gN6jQ,4,2,5,R5T2SbmqfA5cdQsEOb0s1w

Let me just say if you just get drinks at the bar, make sure to order the Mandarin martini. It was SO good and really cold. It wasn't overly sweet but had a nice mandarin taste. I loved it.

Meal started with an amuse bouche of bread sticks with some sort of dip (creme fraiche?, wasabi, cheese crackers). The bread sticks were delicious but the dip didn't really have much taste. Also served with a little tart with goat cheese and a Guinness jello-like bite. Both were pleasant bites but I LOVED the spoonful of apple sorbet with little diced up cooked pieces of apple. What a refreshing bite and perfect thing to cleanse the palate.

The first course came was a cauliflower puree with calamari and butterfish carpaccio served with sliced beets and other things on top. On the side was asparagus in a gelee topped with parmesan cheese. Wow, what a unique and interesting combination. The cauliflower puree had chunky pieces of cauliflower in it too and I liked having that extra crunch. I also liked having the asparagus separate. I appreciate when flavors are separated (that are not mean to be combined).

Next was shrimp served on some type of biscuit with spinach and broth. This was the only slightly disappointing dish. The shrimp was kind of mushy... making me think it wasn't fresh.

Foie gras served three ways was next. The first was a hot version with a watercress puree on top. Everything was just so smooth and delicious and the consistency was perfect. They also served it cold with some nuts and little prune puree with crackers. WOW (I can't believe how many times I'm saying Wow), I loved how it was REALLY cold and the combination went really well. They also served it shaved raw on top of a salad with grapefruit. The shavings reminded me of lardo. 

Next came a lemon sorbet topped with a coconut foam and toasted coconut pieces. I liked how it was a nice palate cleanser and very beautiful.

The main course was lamb two ways. The lamb chop was amazing. It had really nice marbling and I really enjoyed the horseradish and oregano crust. So flavorful. The 2nd version was a lamb leg served chopped with deep fried garlic. It was very Mediterranean-like. Also tasty but I liked the lamb chop better.

Finally, we got 5 desserts. Yes 5! I thought they'd be tiny bites but they were actually bigger than I was expecting. My favorites were the upside down apple pie and the fruit salad topped with pistacchio pudding and cranberry marshmallows. Talk about creative! 

Of course they give you more with delicious meringues and other bite sized chocolates.

Service is superb! It really doesn't get much better than that. They served and cleared everything in unison and replaced all of the silverware in between every single meal. I definitely think if you're celebrating something special, Twist is a fantastic restaurant with out-of-the-box foods and great views and decor. I will definitely be recommending it to my parents and anyone else who can really afford a nice expensive meal in Vegas. Bravo!

Starting off with the truly great - the space.  What an amazing hotel, and a beautiful restaurant.   23rd floor, high ceilings with huge glass panes that provide sweeping views of the Las Vegas strip.  Despite literally having Vegas all around you, from the minute you enter the hotel, you feel like you are being transported someplace else that is quiet, secluded, and exclusive.  I didn't see a single douchebag, or affliction tshirt.  In fact, my ultimate recommendation is to skip the restaurant, and go get a drink in the bar that's on the same floor, and has the same decor and same views.

Everything else - meh.
The food was just OK despite an eye-opening price tag.  Most of the ""innovative"" combinations and preparations just didn't work together, no matter how attractive they were.  We observed lots of diners trying to let the ""experience"" drive their enjoyment, rather than the taste of the food.  Sort of like how your buddies who joined the fraternity where you have to carry a marshmallow in your ass to get in convinced themselves that it was TOTALLY WORTH IT, bro, cuz it was AWESOME!!

The ""formal"" service was merely stiff.  Tons of extra employees hanging around; one to serve you the food, another to explain what it is, etc.  At the same time, lots of unexplained gaps in communication and service.  They all just disappear at various times.

I realize this review goes against the grain of the numerous 4 and 5 star reviews - how to explain it?  It's the reasons I gave above - it was TOTALLY WORTH IT, bro, cuz it was AWESOME!!",QqC2q6uf-502krpgacaARg,1,0,2,A3VVcElY8YOLR429iLHvLg
603271,2013-06-14,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I love this restaurant. Beautiful skyscraper view of the strip. Far removed from the obnoxious noise of casinos and trashy people. I had an amazing meal here. The decor is beautiful and understated. The service, for the most part was very prompt and professional. The amuse bouches were plentiful, beautiful, and interesting, they came out right away when we were so hungry. The fois gras three ways was amazing- a must for FG lovers. The rabbit was also very good, and they were kind enough to offer me a cheese plate instead of desserts, which I really appreciated. It was really a perfect evening. 

The only reason I cannot give this five stars was the very awkward situation that the staff created at the end of our meal. Our server, at our request brought the bill to the table and promptly asked if we needed a pen. This was confusing because we hadn't given him our credit card yet. Then he explained that he would bill it to our room. We smiled, and explained we were staying at another hotel, but joked if he had the right room number that we could fill it in. I honestly believe this was a joke poorly delivered, but the waiter had gotten a little chummy with us, which I don't mind, as he replied ""Well... you know what we'd call that? FRAUD!"" I don't believe he meant any harm, but his delivery of the word FRAUD was quite loud and garnered the attention of all the guests in the restaurant. Awkward.... yes.... 

It kind of ruined an otherwise perfect meal. I hope this waiter will handle his delivery and collection of the bill a little more discreetly and smoothly next time.

Pierre Gagnaire was actually in town that week, and I can only imagine what it is like in his absence. Shocking because there is absolutely no relationship between the price tag ($600 for 2) and the quality of the food. Moreover, having ordered the tasting menu, I would expect that the best would be coming out of the kitchen. Things got off to a bad start with amuse-bouches that had clearly been refrigerated for too long, not that they would have had much more taste were they not too cold. It went downhill from there, with dishes overly complicated for the skill of the kitchen, and weird, unnecessary food associations. Of the savory dishes, I would only have considered one good, the venison, which was well cooked, but nothing one couldn't get in a hundred other places for a fraction of the price.

The restaurant is very inviting and has a cute ""twisted"" branches themed decor at its entrance. Inside the space is open and warmly staged. From top to bottom, the service at Twist was spectacular. Much more than I would expect from a French restaurant (since those restos are usually on the stuffy and formal side...sometimes snobby as well). At Twist, all of the wait staff are professional, warm and friendly. Not once did I feel pressured to order more costly items to up the bill (which happened to us at the Aria cafe the next day -$4banana topping to a waffle- smh).

Better than any steakhouse I've eaten at (mastros, Flemings, Cut, capital grille & Eddies). Nigerian prawns were delicious (trumpet mushrooms are the bomb) and the 1 salad on the menu was rocking.

I've been very fortunate to have dined at a lot of great places and I'm always looking for a new surprise and Twist did it for me. This place definitely woke my palette up and gave me some great surprises. Now for the details...


Menu: Their menu provides you with a ton of options. Different tasting menus and ala carte options. Additionally, you can substitute any items in and out of the tasting menu should you please. I love that they are willing to make any reasonable accommodations for you as some restaurants refuse substitutions and others require everyone do the same tasting menu. This one, not at all, its all about the customer satisfaction, which they got.

Food: 
- Amuse bouche: jack daniel + Guinness gelee, tuna cream with bonito flake, goat cheese cracker, all expertly crafted.
- 4 course tasting menu (halibut carpaccio, turbot with grapefruit, wagyu, and grand dessert): Excellent! Every course was delicate and smooth transition from light and refreshing to strong and bold. The halibut carpaccio had a wonderful horseradish ice cream. Its not too strong for those who aren't fans of horseradish, it adds enough of a hint of flavor to give to an accent to the delicate halibut. 
- Foie Gras 3 ways appetizer: LOVED this! Definitely order it! We had 3 preparations: terrine, shaved, and seared. I would eat it in that order because the classic seared has a rich and bold flavor whereas the terrine and shaved are more delicate. The shaved and seared are my favorites. The shaved was cold and had a light and sweet finish. 
- Muscovy Duck: Very nice. Medium rare, nice rich sauce, the accompanying side was awesome. Cruncy, sweet, and added a nice accent.
- Veal: Portion was larger than expected, which is a great thing. Meat was tender, medium, and accompanied with the bone. Black rice side was okay, but again that's a preference, I don't care for black rice much. 
- Grand Tasting Dessert: Exquisitely designed and delicate. Started with a lime cake, raspberry sorbet with yogurt, lemon chocolate, shortbread, and the chocolate mousse. 
- Eclair - Not your typical eclair and its a good thing.
- Petit four - Loved the meringue and the green tea sweet. Small portions with bold flavors.


Service: Attentive, responsive, and efficient. Warm greeting at the start, coat check purse hangers, waiter checked on us periodically throughout the dinner to see if we had questions or concerns, even solicited feedback from us about their dishes. Everyone that was there was synchronized and organized. It just shows how much they care about their customers and how professionally trained they are.

Ambiance: Beautiful and classy. 23rd floor on top of the smoke free, casino free Mandarin Oriental. Beautiful view of the Strip. If seating is available near the window, request for it as it was gorgeous. I enjoyed the modern decor.

Would I come here again? ABSOLUTELY! Worth the price!

Would I recommend this to people? I've already been plugging this place left and right to just about every living being I know.",9RYD5m8xUb5la2wGsf30_A,4,1,5,jsJFyAUt7HlG1NCnqwWQUQ

Did it live up to the hype? Took my wife there for an early dinner on her birthday and had the taster menu. For the price the food was excellent but not much value considering for the same amount you could catch a plane to Napa and have a world class dinner for the same price...however much more affordable then Guy Savoy or Robuchon's. 

I was definitely blown away by the squab and foie combination. Definite artistry and precision in all the dishes. The langoustine 5 ways was at both extremes good and bad. Presentation was simple but the flavors paired well. The only two things that I did not care for were the tartar and consomme. For some reason these both fell short. The waiter was gracious enough to switch out my Venison for Tenderloin. 

Would I return? There was nothing really wrong with anything except for the fact that I've had better for $250 a head. It was well worth the first try and a satisfactory dining experience, but for the price there are so many other places to try at that same league and caliber.",t3dxO3Y0MMfdqcaVYfeUPA,1,1,3,TNl2I0TcSvlJCQVJDwGDEw
720073,2011-12-15,4,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"We went there for our anniversary last week.

My husband ordered the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and I ordered the 3 course tasting menu.

The service was horrible. Starving, they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 1/2 for the second which they made a mistake by serving me my husband's order (it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the top being cooked but the inside totally RAW- I MEAN IF WE WANTED SASHIMI WE WOULD GO TO A SUSHI RESTAURANT- WHY WOULD WE PAY 400$ FOR TASTING MENU WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN COOK A PIECE OF FISH????). So in 2 hours and 1/2 I pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail. 

On top of the awful food, for my husband's second dish, the waiter served him his wine 30 minutes before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refills.  For his third dish, he got the food 30 minutes before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.

It was truly a horrible experience.

I was really starving. We were seated at 6:30pm and furiously left the restaurant by 9pm. in 2 hours 1/2, I've had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 courses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.

784600,2012-11-19,2,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"My husband and I ate here November 3rd.  As some reviewers have favorably compared Twist to Joel Robuchon and Restaurant Guy Savoy (both establishments we have previously very much enjoyed) we were anxious to try Twist. What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  

Our evening at Twist began with being met at the entry by a strong, nearly overwhelming odor of fish.  I have been in less stinky fish markets.  Despite making the reservation months in advance and the excitement we had leading up to the night, the odor was so powerful we nearly turned around and walked out.  For the record, neither of us are particularly sensitive to smells.  

After being seated, we waited a moderate amount of time for our waiter to greet us.  While waiting we once again contemplated leaving due to the odor.  

When our waiter finally made his way over to us, it became quickly evident he was ill-suited to his position:  technically inept and lacking refinement.  For as much as he appeared to struggle throughout the evening with us and others whom he was serving and for as unrefined as were his behavior and speech, he would have been ill-suited as a waiter in a TGIFridays.  There came a point when this fellow was so overwhelmed by his situation the sommelier came to clear our table.  

The lack of training and refinement we observed in our waiter was also observed in the secondary staff.  As an example, we observed one fellow remove my husband's bread plate while clearing our appetizers and subsequently get rebuked within earshot of us by another staff member.  

The food was good and plentiful with well balanced flavors-the only true positive I can offer from the evening.  The WOW factor we were expecting, though, was lacking and, though tasty, the food was certainly inadequate to counter the negatives of the rest of our experience.  

The decor was okay but was neither inspired nor inspiring.  

From the food and price standpoints specifically, Twist would be best compared to Michael Mina, Mix, Picasso, and the like.  However, in terms of overall experience, the stinky fish odor and the remarkably poor service experience would make for unfair and inaccurate comparisons with these other excellent restaurants.  

My suggestion, skip it.  Huge waste of time, money, and calories.  In a city like Las Vegas there is so much better to be had.",HjmDe3_vg8c6QB13mUUSZw,1,1,2,x9VqRQjwBCorPWI-4FJOGg
836076,2016-09-28,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I'm still  confused by how tasteless the 6 course was. 

The meal began with an array of amuse-gueulle. Instead of presenting them separately (which is the most common way to show hospitality from the kitchen) these 5 bite-sized creations were plated all together, explained once, and then we were left to pick at them. As a result, these morsels did not benefit from the kind of theatricality that can set the tone of an entire meal. I cant remember what they were. There was some mini-tart draped with micro radish. Another was some sort of forlorn gougeres, as if I had arrived at a cocktail party to pick at the last of the hors d' oeuvres ledt on the table. I can't remember much of any of these bites, and I've been to a lot of restaurants where these bites could haunt me for weeks after, wishing they were offered as full-blown appetizers. 

No bread service. No bread plate proper. They don't come around with warm bread and ask what kind you would like. Instead, they give you one of each and put it in front of you. Odd choice.

Both of these moves seemed like inhospitable time-savers or a way to free up servers to do other things.

The first of the 6 courses was poached black cod with fines herbes on a very fancy sounding potato treatment. And though I can appreciate subtlety, the temperature was cold enough to subdued the essence of the oft fragrant cod so thoroughly that the dish ended up tasting like mashed potatoes one might find at the back of the fridge. 

The foie gras soup was good, though the chilly cannelle of corn ice cream was a misjudgment after the cold potatoes. Perhaps an island of corn mousse or  flan would have been more pleasant and a better texture mash-up.
A couple of other dishes went by involving lobster scented souffle bombes and a bowl of mushrooms and such. But then came the main course. Well, what was supposed to be the main course: a couple of slices of rabbitt terrine the size of 50 cent pieces a few slivers of  rabbitt saddle amidst a painstakingly plated mosaic  consisting of little shards of chanterelle mushroom. It was beautiful. But I didn't need a piece of art at that point, I needed some food. Maybe a 6 oz. chop of Name Your Country Meat, glistening with demi-glace-would have been welcomed. But this rabbitt just came off as stingy. 

All of the dishes here required a level of technical proficiency that few restaurants can achieve, but none were beguiling, none had a sense of playfulness, and none expressed any joy. This was food from an artist who once had one hell of a muse, but that muse has whispered all it needs to say and he needs to start dating other muses again-muses that are no good for him, muses his mother wouldn't approve of.

That said, the service was fantastic, and many came to the table to see if everything was okay. What am I going to say? It was too much to fix. And nothing was bad, I mean, not enough to send it back, but it wasn't good enough for-what is touted-as one of the best restaurants in a town full of them. I looked forward to this meal for 5 months when I knew I was going to visit Vegas. I wouldn't eat here again, and that's a ridiculous thing to say given this chef's reputation.

 My hubby and I were celebrating our five year anniversary by staying at Aria. I am more about the food so it was my responsibility to choose the restauraunt. I must give props to my fellow yelpers for pointing me in the right direction. We were going to eat at MOzen because we really wanted to dine at the Mandarin Oriental. I am glad I switched to Twist. I requested a table by the window (made the reservation that day and it was a Friday) and we got it! As a local I see the Strip often but it was still pleasant to have that view during dinner. They started us off with an amuse-bouche. Hot damn! I've wanted one of these ever since I learned about it from the movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Yum! If this is a preview to what the chef wants us to experience then I am ready for that ride. (The palate cleansing Jack Daniels jello shot was fun, I will have to try to make it at home.) 
(I apologize, this is long!) we then got the langostine 5 ways. The first two hot ones are divine. The jelly one is disgusting. Too fishy. The waiter said that most people don't like it. (WTH! Take it off the menu then!) The sommelier (a super cute lady) brought out a White burgandy which paired nicely with our entire meal. Next we had the halibut and Jack Dory. Their sauces were so good I wanted to lick my plate clean. It came with seaweed mashed potatoes (so creamy), some radish thingy (meh), another jelly (not a fan) and a white bean and tomato jelly thing (tasty).  We also ordered the heirloom tomato and ravioli. It is only 1 giant ravioli which was underwhelming compared to the delicious veggies it came with. 
On to dessert. We ordered karavet? I think that was the name. It had apples and cinnamon and other fruits. Very good. But the complimentary petit four at the end of the meal was the winner. You really don't need to order a dessert when you can get all of that yummy goodness in a petit four!! I also had an espresso to end my meal (no soy milk for a cappuccino, bummer). 
The waiters and sommelier were all friendly and willing to chat with us (as you can tell from this rediculously long review that I am fairly chatty). 
Bottom line: some unique dishes and flavors that result in an amazing meal and a wonderful evening. If you have the opportunity to try it then go for it.",n1a-lnkum98TiDrlfDbTbA,4,3,5,VrKNhdlpRtWLcvnCM7udCQ

We sat down and initially ordered a bottle of wine to pair with the menu but were later informed it wasn't available and so we had to substitute, which I understand happens. The issue was that the amuse bouche and the 1st course were both served before our wine. For the price point I just expect the service to be on par. The amuse bouche was actually the star of the tasting menu, I was a fan of all except for the jello shot martini. The problem with the vegetarian tasting menu was that every entree was overpoweringly and unnecessarily sweet. I felt like I was eating 5 courses of desserts. I would not recommend it to the veggies out there.  When I was strictly vegetarian I would struggle to find fine restaurants with great vegetarian tasting menus. So far Sage has been the best I've found. Now that I've incorporated seafood back into the diet I have a lot more options, but still thought it would be a nice change to go back to my old veggie ways. Unfortunately not a good idea at Twist.

1083529,2012-04-05,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"What a truly beautiful restaurant!  There is something very special about this location that I haven't come across at any of the other fine dining locations in Vegas. This is the perfect place to go for a special date.

I was pleasantly surprised by the price.  Now, don't get me wrong - this place is far from cheap.  But for such an extravagant setting, it would be entirely possible to dine here and leave satisfied, but only spend $100 a person.  That is far less than I had assumed.  (Of course it would also be easy to spend much, much more).  I just mention this because I put off eating here for a while, thinking it would be too expensive, but now I am encouraging my friends to give it shot.  The way the menu is set up, everything is in trios.  I started with the foie gras appetizer and three different dishes were brought out at once.  My favorite was the foie veloute with escargot.  The flavors were so delicious, I wanted to lick the bowl.  The largest portion was a foie terrine that was quite tasty.  My only disappointment with that plate was that it only had a small cracker with it.  Foie is so rich that eating it plain by the spoonful is too much like chowing down on straight butter.  I finished the foie by pairing it with the delicious bread basket and it was much better.
For my entree, I order the lobster.  The central dish had a very generous amount of butter-poached lobster that was truly delicious, however the accompaniments - avocado, banana, and mango, were bland and could have used some seasoning.  Also the mango was terribly underripe and tough.
By the dessert course, I was full but had to try some of the sweets.  My favorite came in a martini glass with prune paste in the bottom and coffee granita and a muscovado tuile.  The flavors and textures were delicious together.

All together my appetizer and entree were among the more expensive options, but included a total of six dishes and was under $100.  Considering how lovely and elegant everything was, I highly recommend the experience.  If you go, keep in mind they don't have their own self parking garage and the walk to the one at Aria is too far.  Just choose the free valet parking and you are dropped off only feet from the elevator to the restaurant.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,1,0,4,a8kmcUHXatDknrTA9q-JcQ

They served us a few dishes that were not on the menu that were ""compliments of the chef"" we were told, which was a nice touch. They had a army of servers come out for each course and set out dishes down at the same time every course. There were a few people that stopped by our table to check on us during the course of dinner that were very knowledgeable about what they were serving us. They must watch you & your facial expressions on camera because my bandmates wife was not too big on the Rabbit course they served and they noticed and came to the table to find out what was wrong. Turns out she had a pet bunny and didn't want to eat it so they offered her another selection but she was stuffed. I had no problem taking the rabbit off her hands because it was delicious! We had been drinking vodka since early in the day so we opted out of wine. Next time I would really like to try the wine/food paring. This is the kind of place that I would say 95% of the worlds population will never experience anything like it in their lifetime. Truly amazing experience, thanks to the chef and all our servers Friday 9/23/16 @ 9:30 pm.
Another plus- the AC was a bit chilly for our wives in their dinner gowns so they went out and came back with a few shawls to keep them warm. Now that fricken service!

Very cool experimental ideas & classical cooking.

***Short Review

Very daring experimental cuisine.
Makes places like Joel Robuchon and Le Bernardin seem conservative by comparison.
High emphasis on sweet dishes and desserts.
Expect to pay around $140 for a tasting dinner although more modest alternatives are available.
More classical dishes are available for the conservative palate, and it's still suberb.
Most outstanding was the foie gras ice cream, and foie gras 3 ways.

Excellent top notch service, possibly the best ever.
Servers are organized yet very accommodating and friendly.

I very much doubt this style of cooking will be easy to find.
Keep in mind this is Pierre Gagnaire's only restaurant in the US.
(and possibly the most affordable)

***Long Review
 
Dining at Twist was an unusual experience.  I don't think everyone will enjoy it.  To be fair, I did not enjoy every dish.  Some, I genuinely did not care for.  Most of it worked.  Everything was very interesting, and often difficult to describe.  They serve very experimental cuisine that explores dishes with a different variety flavors, textures, and temperatures.  Interestingly they also serve some very excellent, and elaborate classic French dishes.

Like or hate it, there's really nothing out there (that I know of) which even closely resembles this.  If you're not adventurous, stick to the classic 'a la carte' dishes.  I think it's really difficult to go wrong.

I ordered the Tasting menu. This focuses more on the experimental cuisine.  Some dishes are more strange and interesting than satisfying.  Not everything will work, but almost everything will leave an impression, and often things can be very decadent, if not excessive.  There is an outrageously high emphasis on dessert courses. Half the tasting menu dishes were 'desserts'.
Forget having a single 'amuse bouche' here you get at least half a dozen.  Amuse bouche dishes also have a consistent dessert theme.

Portions here very generous, and often a bit excessive if you order 'a la carte'  It's very difficult to leave hungry regardless of what you order.

Service here is really top notch, extremely organized, yet very laid back and accommodating.  I ordered the full tasting, my gf a limited tasting, and a relative of mine from the 'a la carte' menu.  I have yet to try a fine dining establishment that would allow this.  

Dining environment very modern, although a tad cold.  It feels more like a club than a restaurant, but stylish and tasteful nonetheless.  The decor would not be my first choice, but it's pleasant nonetheless.

If I had to complain, I'd say their website should have more information.  As of Jul'11 their website has very little in terms of what prices to pay.  Maybe this is the intended effect, but I find that inconveniencing nonetheless.

Writing about Twist is very difficult, and I'm doubtful will do it justice.  The experience is really best sampled directly with an open mind.

Highly recommended for the adventurous.  
No guarantees it will please everyone, should you go with the tasting.
There's just no way that can be done when the chef takes the risks that he chooses.",OWtjsyPKWUu7La7uOyC6Rw,9,5,5,mQ-ODO1EMmFkWXO1cxXwEw

Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I always dine at Twist. Since it opened in December of 2009, I have eaten at Twist 8 times. I have tried the tasting menu 4 times and dined a la carte 4 times.  I am torn as to which to recommend. But to be honest, I will recommend a la carte because you can tailor your menu to your individual likes and dislikes.  I absolutely LOVE Twist!!! Yes, it can be challenging, and not every single dish will work but I admire the creativity and risk-taking involved in the menu. Chef Pascal Sanchez is a true culinary magician.   The food is wonderful, the service is exemplary, and the decor is memorable. I will recommend one dish----the chocolate souffle.

1264812,2012-12-19,7,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Our first night in Vegas was celebrated at Twist & have to say there were some hits & some misses.  2 of the group got the Tasting Menu & 3 of us did A La Carte

We were sad to discover the Vegetarian Menu was actually a Vegan / Gluten Free Menu & most of the dishes didn't float our boats.  Just because we don't eat meat, it doesn't mean we only want fruit for dessert or no cheese / cream / pasta offerings for entrees....so the tasting menu was out for 2 of the 3 veggies & we chose a la carte

Beet & mushroom salad - this was cold salad & was pretty tasty

Main was the whole tomato stuffed w/ a curried rice - no wow factor & ended up giving over 3/4 of my dish to BF

Meaty bunch in our group got the Foie Gras w/ Porcini & the foie & shrooms were cut in identical chunks & all cooked together so the flavors could compliment.  Eye rolls from the deliciousness

Mains included Venison & Steak & the portions were extremely small.  The venison was overcooked although requested to be med rare & the steak was dry but expected since Buddy #1 ordered it med-well.

There was an Intermezzo course of Blue Moon foam & Roquefort w/ poached Pears that was a major miss - very little cheese & way too tart.  The Vegan Menu Intermezzo was a Raspberry Sorbet & it was just a standard sorbet

Started dinner at 8:30pm & it was after 11:30pm when half of our table cried uncle & had to leave - timing between dishes was excruciatingly long & especially for those of us not enjoying the tasting menu - we left before the dessert course was served but were filled in the next day that this was a ginormous course that was basically 3 whole desserts.  There was supposed to be a tasting of 6 desserts but we were told that each of the 6 was like 1/2 of 1 entire dessert.....maybe we should have stayed  :-)

Extremely impressive wine list & the ambiance was incredible.  Overall we had a great time chatting & catching up w/ the crew so have to say an A-OK was very well-deserved",37HswRimgBEf7_US-c3CDA,9,8,3,Kltxe0vIKzVFsblDbqcK7Q

I took my husband here for his birthday and the service was absolutely top notch! When they called the day before to confirm the reservation, I mentioned it was his birthday and I swear he may as well have been wearing a Birthday Badge! Everyone from the hostess to the sommelier wished him a happy birthday and the waiter thanked us numerous times for celebrating the occasion with them.

The food here is yummy and, while you can expect to pay a good deal for it, the place does offer complimentary bottled water, chef's choice amuse bouche, a tasty sorbet intermezzo, complimentary additional sides and (in our particular case) a little birthday cake for my husband. All in all the extras, combined with the tasty food, stellar service, and beautiful ambiance definitely lessen the blow of the bill. 

I tried: 

The Langoustines which were flash fried and served over a bed of deliciously spiced lentils covered in the Zezette Boullion. Our served told me this sauce is always featured on the chef's ever changing menus. I can't tell why, as the flavor was out of this world. I almost asked for a spoon! 

Pierre's Salad. If I was a chef I wouldn't blink an eye before putting my name on this yummy concoction. Beets, caramelized pecans, and cheese, need I say more? 

The Filet & my husband's Ribeye. The ribeye was fatty for my taste, which is due to the cut of the meat not the preparation, but it was good. My filet was perfect in every way. The sides we chose were the mixed vegetables and pur√©ed potato. The server brought us these yummy think French fries as a bonus. All of the sides were great.  

We really wanted to try the cheese course but we couldn't do it as we were stuffed after everything else we had tried! Next time for sure. 

The sommelier here was outstanding. I'm wishing I could remember his name. My husband can be a pain when it comes to wine selection and I've seen many a sommelier become flustered.  He was in rare form last night while trying to choose the perfect bottle, and changed his mind quite a bit. The sommelier was very knowledgable and helpful.

1314536,2009-12-30,24,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) ""weird"", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in ""here and there"", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is ""fusion"" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous ""other"" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the ""3rd best restaurant"" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a ""crazy uncle"" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to ""taste and experience"" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's ""Shellfish Royale"" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gel√©e and shallots, as well as his last presentation of ""King Sea Bream"", a curiously concoction of a ""bonito-shellfish gel√©e"" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as ""black olive gelee"" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable ""head"", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.",jgjuQCjv8sJlDXxYyaFKBw,34,30,5,48zTPFp0mVbAs55yFTILsA

1741306,2014-01-30,10,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"***Twist delivers contemporary French cuisine; it is good for Vegas but still a notch below top SF and Chicago spots***

Twist is yet another Vegas fine dining restaurant from an internationally acclaimed chef like Robuchon and Savoy.  Twist is newer though.  It is located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin hotel.  Being newer, I was hoping for more contemporary cuisine than what I've had at Vegas' other fine dining French restaurants and Twist delivered.

Twist features a lot of good (and modern) food while still showcasing French ingredients and cooking techniques.  Twist offers several dining options.  You can go for a more value-centric 3-course dinner.  You can also order a la carte where you choose from elaborate plates that feature proteins in multiple interpretations (the multiple presentations of foie gras sounded interesting) as well as big Prime steaks.  Finally, you can opt for one of their tasting menus--a vegetarian option or their seasonal tasting menu (available in 4 or 6 courses).

I opted for the tasting menu and it started off very well.  First came a series of tasty amuses.  There were lavash breadsticks with albacore cream and bonito flakes (pate-like in richness), an almond sable, very good goat cheese sandwiched between two light and crispy crackers, and a really good Guinness and Jack Daniels gelee rolled in gingerbread (great burn but also sweet--reminiscent of the cocktail gels at LA's Providence).

The bread was also good (several warm options including a warm bacon and smoked cheddar roll, a crusty French baguette, a too dense brioche roll, herb and feta, and cherry pecan bread).

My first course was sea bass and haddock carpaccio with citrus and horseradish ice cream.  The fish was good--moist and soft--and went well with the citrus and herbs to give it freshness.  The horseradish ice cream was very creamy and had a noticeable horseradish flavor without being overpowering.

My second course was easily my favorite of the night.  It was foie gras ravioli next to seared langoustine in a herb and coconut milk broth (topped with crispy mushrooms).  The foie gras ravioli had a thick pasta skin as well as creamy, buttery and savory seared foie gras at the center.  The langoustine was very nicely cooked--fresh, lightly sweet, plump, and soft.  The broth was very aromatic.  This reminded me of the buttery foie gras ravioli at Providence and the perfectly cooked langoustine at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon (two very good restaurants).

Next up was a fish course and it was disappointing.  It was turbot and the fish was a little tough and not easy to flake--definitely far from Baume's soft and flaky turbot.  Worse than the slightly tough fish was the grapefruit (very acidic and bitter).  This felt like something that maybe should have came earlier because the acidity was too much for an entree.

A good intermezzo of apple and yuzu sorbet with Dungeness crab came next.  Chicken followed and it was served on warm greens with pistachio.  I do not often see chicken on fine dining menus, but I was glad to see it because chicken can be really good if a crispy skin is achieved and the meat is juicy.  The meat was fairly juicy here, but there was no crispy skin.  The greens were okay, but this course felt overseasoned.

Wagyu beef was the final savory course.  It was served over warm sweet and sour red cabbage slaw.  The Wagyu had a fair amount of richness.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked.  It was also more like tri-tip than a true steak so it was slightly tough and chewy.

Dessert consisted of a series of mini desserts, which I felt overall were too fruit focused as well as too tart.  The first dessert was really good strawberries with cream and a nice strawberry sorbet.  The pistachio and cucumber parfait was refreshing and had great creaminess, but there were too many leafy greens, which resulted in a salad-like flavor and texture.  There was also a shortbread cookie with blackberries.  The chocolate part of the dessert had rich chocolate ice cream as well as light meringues and a fruit paste.

Service was excellent--very polished and personable.  I thought my server Breanne was really good and the male server assisting her delivered food presentations with professionalism and knowledge but also an enthusiasm that really makes you want to dive into the food.

Prices were very high, but that is the case with many Vegas restaurants.

Twist provides a good view of The Strip; the dining room is nice, elegant and contemporary.

I am not a fan of Vegas restaurants and there were a few things about Twist that reminded me why I feel this way (the high prices and how Vegas fine dining does not measure up to SF or Chicago).  The food here felt more exciting than Aureole, Guy Savoy and miX though and it is worth a shot if you are looking for high-end but also contemporary French cuisine in Vegas.

1789961,2017-02-10,9,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Twist is a gorgeous, sleek restaurant on the 23rd floor of the equally gorgeous and sleek Mandarin Oriental.  The views from the hotel, restaurant, and yes even the restroom are breathtaking.  This restaurant is 1 to 2-Michelin worthy for their creativity in their dishes. I think the Grand Tasting Menu can rival L'Atelier's.  After all, the owner is Pierre Gagnaire, famous 3-Michelin Chef from France. Their Vegetarian Tasting Menu however was just okay to me and didn't have the same wow factor, despite being half the price of the Grand Menu. Our party of six ordered five Grand Tasting Menus (5 stars) and One Vegetarian Tasting Menu (3 stars) - so that's a weighted average of 4.67 stars rounding up to 5.

SERVICE (5 stars)
Top notch!  Servers explained every dish in detail, were patient and friendly.  One waiter even helped direct my mom to the restroom, by escorting her by the arm!

AMUSE BOUCHE (5 stars)
We got some amazing small bites here.  This tiny radish tart that was super refreshing and like eating an entire salad with one bite (my sister's words!).  The olive and gin martini jello shot on a stick was amazing, something like a cocktail for astronauts.

VEGETARIAN TASTING MENU (3 stars)
Like I said, good but nut great.  Many preparations relied on tartness and acidity to add flavors to the veggies.  My personal favorites were the beetroot, pumpkin (reminds me of soft tofu with truffles), and the tortellini.

GRAND TASTING MENU (5 stars)
This is highly recommended!  Lots of seafood, proteins, and creative use of fruits and veggies.  Most dishes 5 stars, a few 4 stars.  My favorites were the lobster (perfectly cooked and tender) and venison saddle (seared and incredibly juicy).  The side dishes were likewise awesome, especially the chilled green bean with almonds with some serious crunch and flavor.

GRAND DESSERTS (5 stars)
Both tasting menus gives five desserts, which were recommended to be eaten in a certain order.  Servers arranged them in a circle, and suggested we start at 6-o clock and eat clockwise.  My favorites were the first (coconut tapioca), third (chartreuse) and fifth (red fruit with chocolate ganache).  Flavors went from slightly sweet and fruity, to tart, and finally ending on richness.

1861985,2012-12-19,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I've thought of the somewhat soulful quote ""Cuisine does not measure itself
in terms of tradition or modernity.  One must read in it the tenderness of the chef.""  It's an open showing of ones self through food I guess, there can be no other description of it as an artist would throw a gallery of their work open for criticism to the world, good and bad.

The space is small, elegant and beautiful.  I'm sleepy and dehydrated but the small bar greets guests for a pre-dinner drink and the lively banter carries through the air.  There are perhaps 20 tables, some lining a great view in the Mandarin.  The staff ratio is high and they zip around with tremendous attention and courtesy; no rush nor pretense.

The wine list is presented on an ipad, extensive with the usual selections of new and old world greats.  There's a special truffles menu this time, so let's move on to the food.

On a three course, I almost call the food heavy, portions can be large and saucy.  The sauces are incredible, worth hanging on to for bread-dipping and the proteins are well-cared for and moist.  So, I must first call on the slow cooked scallops with truffles as an appetizer, ridiculously good and delicate.  Then there was the porcini veloute sauce foie gras, a tiny bite followed by two separates of scallop carpaccio and orange-onion gelee.  The mains are the tandoori monkfish and Nuoc-mam salmon.  Mushrooms abound in all dishes and the sauces are impeccable...did I mention I love mushrooms?  (We're also kind of full at this point from all the bread-dipping)

So dessert offers room only for the grand dessert, fairly grand and ambitious.  I've lost count but several were better than the others.  The tastes are worth words; pear, dragon fruit, passion fruit and a lovely tangerine sorbet...I'm a sucker for sorbet.

I love how the restaurant is located in the Mandarin Oriental and they actually validate your valet ticket so make sure to take it with you. 

From the moment I walked through the hall, I was captivated with the ambiance of Twist. The staff were friendly and attentive. 

They bring out their bread and describe their oh so yummy house made butter.  After you divulge in their super addicting butter, the amuse bouche is placed on the table. It was like a work of art. We decided to order a la carte. I started with the Pierre salad and the BF had Hudson Valley foie gras two ways. I chose lobster as my main entree and the BF had Heritage Green Circle Chicken A La Lyonnaise. OMG, my lobster came out 3 ways and it was so delicious. I was blown away as one way they prepared the lobster was a souffle with popcorn. The dishes are classic French with a modern twist ... almost like a French mashup with Jose Andres. They also came out with a birthday dessert as a finisher, and this was the cherry on top of the great dining experience we received at Twist.

I found the meal disjointed, at many times off putting in tastes and textures.  I don't care how 'fine' this dining is, if it doesn't TASTE good, it's really not worth the dough we paid. Believe me I'm willing to shell out for a great orgasmic meal.  

The only tasting menu is called the 'Gagnaire Spirit'.  To me, a tasting menu should reflect the culmination of the season and chef's best.  After tasting the 'Spirit', I can wholeheartedly say Gagnaire's Twist is not food I would gush about or eat again.  

Wine pairing: Generous pours and fairly priced.

Canapes: The four items did not complement each other and the cookie tasted stale.  I did like the flax cracker and the subtly fishy cream.  Haricot Verts w/diced veggies were overly salted and acidic.  I found the Guinness & Jack Daniels gellee, strange & extraneous.

He suggested the best wine and cocktail selections, was spot on with all his dining recommendations and gave us time to talk at dinner.   He truly made our experience remarkable!   I highly recommend asking for him!!  At the conclusion of dinner he took us through a private tour of the kitchen to meet the Chef and his team.   As we were headed out, I realized that my iPhone was missing and many members of the team helped me look in every book and cranny, and me use their personal iPhone to locate my phone.   There wasn't a presentation that didn't include the most sophisticated detail combined with a delicate taste of each flavor.

The bread service was good, with two different butters, salted and unsalted, but most importantly piping hot bread. 

My meal started off with a forgettable amusee, so forgettable that I've erm. forgotten what it was. For appetizer, I opted for the Alba truffle scallop mousseline, a pretty traditional preparation. The scallop mousseline was smooth and very refined; a perfect vehicle for the Alba truffles. A decent start to a meal.

For main course, I had the Ribeye done two ways; the loin of the ribeye was grilled and the tips of the ribeye sauted with sesame and a french bean salad. The dish was accompanied by a green cabbage fondue, a bordelaise sauce and 3 very minute crisps of potato chips on a nantaise marshmallow garnished with pickled shallots. The beef was exceedingly well cooked, but overly rich, especially paired with the tasty but oily sauted french beans. The green cabbage fondue again was delicious but overly rich when paired with the rich beef. I didn't care for the nantaise marshmallow  which I thought tasted like soap -- pity because I really needed the tartness from this side.

i opted not to have a desert; and finished the meal with some petit fours and a macchiato. The petit fours were tasty, but nothing spectacular.

I'm in two minds about this rating, and bordering between 3 and 4.

4 stars because the food in general was well cooked and delicious. 3 because I expected a lot more from a chef with this reputation. The menu read well, but didn't really inspire me or looked particularly interesting or exciting. No doubt the food was well cooked, but was it modern, interesting or inspiring; yess-ish, no and no. For the price, I would try the other Frenchmen's restaurants.",9xXg9BhqoCtTyu56nj7GmQ,2,1,3,rC4walpYVgXPY_rJU870rQ

The view is spectacular, but that's not why it was so amazing. For us, it was the food. We ordered a nice bottle of wine and a cocktail each (the manhattan was made to perfection.) We split a half dozen oysters, and they were the best oysters I have ever had. I had the duck and it was delicious. However, my boyfriend ordered the lobster tail and wagyu beef and that beef was the best three bites I've ever had. Of anything. For dessert, we had the only chocolate on the menu (tazmanian something or other) and it was all delicious, all the way.

2206252,2010-02-26,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"This place has some serious game.

Despite the many choices there are along the Strip, I would say that Pierre Gagnaire has some of the most innovative, unique and delicious creations.

Be forewarned! - classic French cuisine this is not. No - although the preparation is definitely French, Twist uses modern techniques (molecular gastronomy type stuff) to enhance the character of the ingredient itself. Some of the dishes are rather complex and creates (excuse the pun) food for thought. This is not a place where you pig out - this place, my friends, is like a zen temple of food contemplation. 

When the canapes arrived, we were amazed at the number (5 different canapes). Normally, at most places, you get some sort of amuse bouche and that's it. Here, it's more of a course to wet your appetite.

I was also amazed at the a la carte pricing - we ordered foie gras dishes for around $30  which amounted to foie gras four ways in quite sizable portions. The truffle dishes really had a generous amount on the plate. It's the real thing too... none of that truffle oil stuff (which doesn't have any real truffles in it anyway). The three dishes were almost a meal in of itself Everything was delicious.

Service was excellent - our waiter was warm, knowledgeable without being snooty. (unlike at Joel Robuchon which in my humble opinion is overpriced and not that good.)

If you have one restaurant to blow some money on - this is the place to hit, hands down.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,5,gwXWt5uKNr0OxO_yiczqeA
2225722,2014-12-29,2,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Made a reservation at Twist Saturday afternoon for 9:30 pm that evening, arrived promptly and was seated right away.

Immediately enjoyed the view and ambiance-wonderful setting to experience savory flavors!! Tables were spaced about nicely, but not far enough apart to overhear the couple behind be (more on that later). 

Prior to being seated I noticed they had shattered plates on the table, which matched artwork on the wall. They were removed upon being seated-an interesting touch.

I applaud Twist for an overwhelming selection of dark beers (stouts and porters). First time I had a hard time choosing what to order! I chose Carnegie Stark Porter, which was creamy and hoppy, with a very slight taste of coffee. The service was top notch - they poured our drinks at the same time. 

Prior to ordering they brought out a special surprise, a ""jello shot"" of whiskey and Guinness (delicious) and some other tasty treat. Sadly, I don't know the technical names of either.

I was planning on ordering the Lamb (based upon the menu online), but the actual menu didn't offer it. I chose the 5 course Vegetarian Tasting Menu instead. My date ordered the Venison. We ordered langoustine as an appetizer.

Prior to delivering our appetizer, were we served a few yummy rolls. The brioche roll was my favorite - dense and when combined with the salted butter, AWESOME! 

I really enjoyed their serving method. The langoustine appetizer was served at the perfect time. Right after we tried each of the rolls. The flavors were original and memorable-a great start! They also served the first course of my meal. Again, service was great - there was a lid on each dish to keep the food warm and the servers unveiled each at the same time.

My appetizer was the Beets and Orange salad (Goat Cheese and Caramelized Pecan Nuts with Hazelnut Vinaigrette). One of the best dishes of the night. The salad was crisp and fresh - loved the beats. The vegetables weren't hidden by the vinaigrette but complemented it. 

Prior to our next meal, we were served an icy desert? Not sure what it was, but it tasted of grapefruit and was rather interesting. 

My next plate was the Pumpkin Gnoochi. Again, they served this at the perfect time (they paced our meals perfectly). As a slight detour-sadly, prior to enjoying this delicious plate, the couple sitting behind me was getting into a heated argument about the food. Their complaining and negativity was quickly ruining my experience. I tried to ignore their bickering and enjoy my meal. The Gnoochie was probably my least favorite. It was good, but not a standout. 

Next up was the COFFEE AND CHESTNUT VELOUTE which was amazing. Unique flavors, never thought coffee could be used as it was!

By this time, the couple behind us was starting to get under my skin. Every meal was complaint after complaint, the women was clearly drunk and it was embarrassing for them and for me. There were two other tables adjacent to us facing the beautiful view of Vegas, but both were occupied. 

Next meal was the CARNAROLI RISOTTO - a nice dish, but not a favorite. However, the venison my date ordered was absolutely amazing. One of my top favorite dishes of all time. I had a few family members who are hunters; usually venison is gamy and tough. This meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The meat was cooked absolutely perfectly and the seasoning was phenomenal. It really did melt in your mouth. I only had a bite because I didn't want to steal her dish. And I was actually getting full (which usually never happens).

Even though our dinner was almost over, I couldn't take listening to the whiny couple behind us. The wife was saying how they shouldn't not leave a tip, and the husband was literally huffing and puffing. I was considering turning around and making a scene, but I calmed down. I was trying my best to enjoy the night, but it's like when someone's kicking your seat in a movie theater, you just can't ignore it. 

I asked one of our waiters if we could move to the other table in front us us (that was recently cleared) and tried to enjoy our desert nearly out of earshot. Sadly, at this time, I just wanted to leave. My date didn't really know what was going on, but I could tell the staff was uncomfortable with this couple, and it really did taint my night.  

I didn't eat much of the desert, although, it did look good. 

Overall, I would definitely go back. The service was exceptional, the attention to detail amazing. I enjoyed the large variety of flavors in smaller portions. The magic they did with the venison was astounding. I can't fault fault them or remove a star for the whiny couple behind me, but next time I'll ask to move sooner. I know if they hadn't been there I would have had an ever better experience.",1Yt9lG_B-lUZCQBp59uhlw,2,3,5,DFmAzCyCfJTaqEta3OyZlA

So when I got the email for their New Year's Eve dinners, I thought it would be great to take her and my four kids to the early four course dinner at 6:00pm.  My kids are extremely well behaved and have eaten at many of the finest restaurants around the world, even though they are only 9, 10, 11, and 12 years old.  Well, when my assistant called to confirm everything and do her job, they told her there was an age limit of 16 years old.  Funny, I don't recall that being a restriction in their advertisement, nor when I personally booked the reservation.  They seemed to want to make an exception at the start of the conversation and the person my assistant was working with had told her she would do her best and follow up with her.  Today, when my assistant called to find out where everything was at, they simply told her that the reservation had been cancelled.  No phone call.  No text. No nothing.  If my assistant didn't call to follow up, we might have never known until we arrived next Wednesday evening.

2345225,2017-09-13,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"This is a place to visit in Vegas for special event! 

Twist is located inside Mandarin Oriental, they shared the same entrance with Aria but you can follow the sign where you will be allowed to do valet at for guest hotel. Parking in Vegas strip (Las Vegas Blvd) is not free anymore. You have to pay for parking (both self and valet) start at $10-30. unless you're a high roller which you will be given a comp. In my case, I showed them my reservation at Twist and they give us free parking which is neat. Once you enter the building, go take the elevator and once you arrive, the host will greet you. 

RSVP was easy. You can do online rsvp or call the concierge. There were about 20 tables throughout the place. It was not busy when we were there since it was during the week. If you requested to be seated by the window, you'll be able to see the Las Vegas strip and see the beautiful lights around the city. Decor was modern, sleek but elegant. 

It's a french restaurant (easily recognized by the chef's name) . Please note there is a strict dress code to be here. No jeans or yoga pants allowed. I don't think they allow younger kids either (common for formal dining). We ordered the 10 course dinner which was A LOT of food. But we did not have wine with it knowing we would be so full. 

The bread train was humongous and DELICIOUS! They carved butter in front of you to accompany your choice of bread. It was all Fresh. Our dining experience from start to finish were amazing. Mushroom soup was creamy and very tasty. The foie gras entree was a perfection. Steak was perfectly cooked. We had 5 different kind of deserts and amazed on how perfect they are. Everything was prepared in detail and taste like heaven! They give you couple macaroons in a box to go. Yummy and they  were too pretty to be eaten. I'd give 5 stars out of 5. 

Price is high (expected for a Michelin star restaurant located on the strip). But it was a special occasion for me and my bestie. We had fun and it was all worth it. I'd give 4 if this was a regular restaurant but it is a French fine dining restaurant at a triple diamond hotel. 

Service was a top notch, 5 diamond service from the start to finish. The server gladly took us lot of pics with different angle and strip view background, lol. Very professional at all time. I'd give 5 out of 5.

We were banished to the far side of the restaurant, but that's ok :) (Little one did well and loved the mashed potatoes and soup!)

I don't really have much to add - this was one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. Amazing view and bathrooms in addition to gracious service and delicious food.

They handled the varied menu ordering (I had a 5 course prix fixe whereas my husband ordered a la carte) well. I'm not vegetarian but the vegetarian prix fixe was truly delicious. I like that flat or sparkling water is included in the meal; I find Vegas' water has a funny taste so I like that this factor is eliminated here.

2411000,2018-04-27,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Short version: This place will meeting and probably exceed your expectations. Everything is just so.  It is clear that this is a Michelin caliber restaurant from start to finish.  You just have to be in the mood for this level of dining.

Long version:
We decided to go here the first time because Pierre Gagnaire was there in the kitchen himself.  I'm a firm believer that if the man is there, you need to check it out once in your life.  An already fantastic experience was really upgraded even further, which I personally didn't think was possible.  Any area that I would normally rate (ex. food, cleanliness, atmosphere, service) are all 5's across the board.  If you consider yourself a foodie, you need to experience this.

The decor is insane.  This has to be my favorite space in Vegas (or at least tied with one other).  I love the palate, the ""floating"" lights, candles, all of the purple, the chairs, and don't get me started on the view.  Even the entry way is announcing that indeed you have arrived to the time in your life that you can eat here.

The service is over the top hand and foot.  They keep notes.  That cocktail your ordered 4 years ago... Yeah, they know it and want to know if you would like to enjoy another. Every course is like a production of a play.  The staff perfectly compliments every act.

The tasting menu is telling you a story, and you will be absolutely enchanted. That butter is the best butter I have had in a restaurant.  The potato that was soaked for hours in butter and bacon fat is the best potato I've had in my life.  It was amazing to me how little things like that really stuck out to me.  Everything was superb-- lobster, leeks, boar, scallops, soups, salads, sole, etc.  In dining here 3 times with the tasting menu twice, I can't even begin to tell you how this will be one of the best meals of your life.

Believe it or not this is a hard review to write because I loved the food, but I don't know how I really feel about eating here. It's so opulent and over the top that for me it is honestly a bit uncomfortable. It's not that the staff said anything or gave us a side eye... I just feel like a bull in a China shop.  This is inherently my problem and not the restaurant's issue. For this reason, I would say that I would keep it as a special occasion place.

I must admit, their American Wagyu steak (7oz) was amazing!! You would expect nothing less from a $90 steak!  I do recommend this steak if you are dining here.  If you are a fan of truffle, then I would suggest the artichoke puree with black truffles - that was yummy!  The side of spinach was too salty for my taste buds so I didn't have a good experience with that dish.  As for the appetizer, I was very happy with the foie gras prepared 3 ways.

It is with much gratitude that I share a glimpse of a night enjoyed at Twist.  Four of us took part in the Six Course Grand Tasting Menu, and it was outstanding.  I may be biased as I was with my love and two amazing friends, but our dinner was one of those moments in time that you can't help but capture and appreciate with your heart, soul, mind, and taste buds of course! 

The setting of Twist is special in its own right. Perched on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental, the floor to ceiling windows offer a beautiful view of the strip, but the restaurant itself is modern and refined--a perfect and intentional match to the excellent cuisine patrons experience at Chef Pierre Gagnaire's Twist. The dining room is relatively small, but doesn't feel so as a result of the windows. There is also raised seating the back of the restaurant that provides for observation of the kitchen as well as an unobstructed vantage over the dining room to the aforementioned view.  

Before I move on to the food, I am compelled to acknowledge the service. The entire team was outstanding, capped by Sunday, our head waiter. First-rate service is expected at a restaurant such as Twist, but even as such, our experience was markedly enhanced by the proficient service we received.

On this evening, the Grand Tasting Menu consisted of:
- Mediterranean Loup De Mer Carpaccio of Alaskan King Crab, Avocado, Lemon Gel and Horseradish infused Milk Cube
- White Asparagus with Snow Peas, Baby Carrots, and Blood Orange Mousseline
- Maine Lobster with ""Pitchi"" Sauce, Shitake Mushrooms, Madras Curry, and Granny Smith Apple
- Frog Legs with Morel Mushrooms, Veal Mousseline and Watercress Foam
- Roasted Canadian Buffalo Tenderloin infused with Juniper Berries with Mixed Vegetables and Bone Marrow, Pea Puree, and Violin Sauce
- The Main Course also came with Pomme Fondante, Lebannese Tabbouleh, and Tamarind & Red Beet Root Ice Cream
- Pierre Gagnaire Dessert - a selection of Five Creative Desserts that turned in to seven...and then 8 when a birthday offering for the lovely Ayumi was presented

True to Pierre's iconic reputation, these dishes all featured a harmoniously balance of modernity, French-fusion, and refinement. The White Asparagus was the least impressive, but even here, the blood orange mousseline was superb--elevating the spring perennial in a unique and beautiful way. The dishes change regularly at Twist, but the approach is the same. This may be the only time in my life that I will experience a horseradish infused Milk Cube with King Crab, Violin Sauce with Buffalo, or Frog Legs with Water Cress Foam, but the intention of these components were well received and serve to demonstrate the standard of expectation that is enjoyed at Twist. 

My love and I opted to accompany our meal with the Grand Wine Pairing...this made for an abundance of wine, but an abundance of highly enjoyable wine that was true to the goal of enriching each course with a beautiful pairing. 

Vegas food is utterly amazing. There is no other city the size of Vegas that offers the same array of options. An obvious credit to the tourism and convention economy of the city, it is remarkable that there are so many choices for restaurants of similar quality and price as Twist.  If you are visiting Vegas and including an elite meal in you plans...or a local celebrating an occasion, I can make arguments for several different places, but suffice it to say that our evening at Twist was truly exceptional.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,35,29,5,LdzgkCH2MmjUa0-6Ttviig

However, our concierge at the Aria recommended Twist at the Mandarin Oriental.  I am happy that he did.  It was magnificent!  

First of all we had to take the elevator to the 24th (I think) floor.  From there we were seated against the window where we had a mesmeric view of the strip.

SEARED MEXICAN DIAMOND BLUE SHRIMP - 4 Stars
Shellfish Jus, Olive Oil, Meyer Lemon Paste emulsion, Italian Mustard Fruits, Jumbo Green Asparagus, Pomegranate.  

The shrimp was really hearty in this dish.  It was so fresh, definitely not like the previously frozen kind from Costco.  The lemon paste made the shrimp ""pop"" and the asparagus and pomegranate worked as nice compliments in the background.

FOIE GRAS & CHANTERELLE SOUP - 5 Stars
Roasted Foie Gras, Chanterelles & Seasonal Green Vegetables, Foie Gras Ice Cream, Baby Artichoke, Cured Ham & Dundee-Pinky.  

Damn this was so good.  I didn't know soup could taste so great.  The broth was thick and creamy with a foie gras flavor.  The mushrooms and vegetables were the perfect ingredients to put into this soup.  It had a nice bite to it and was not overcooked.

TAJIMA WAGYU BEEF FROM LINDSAY FARM, OREGON - 4 Stars
Roasted Fillet Mignon finished with fresh Herbs Butter Arugula Pur√©e & Tomme de Savoie Cheese, Stuffed Turnip, Italian Summer Truffle.

This steak was nice.  It was tender and moist.  I wish it would have been bigger, lol.  Anyway, a nice twist on steak with the herb butter.

Peach & Apricot Compote with Rosemary, Pistachio Sugar Leaf & Orange Almond Cream - 4 Stars - A nice dessert, the flavors worked well.  And I liked the crispy top that was kind of like a brittle.

Declination of Raspberries - 3 Stars - Not that great so I will not write anything.

Cherry Soup, Prune Cream & Cassis Sorbet, Meringue - 5 Stars - This was the best dessert.  The cherries were tart and the flavors burst in my mouth.

Black Chocolate Ganache, Milk Caramel Ball, Baileys & Coffee Granite - 4 Stars - Did I say that this meal came with a gang of desserts?  The chocolate and coffee was a nice way to cool off our palettes from our the sweet and tart flavors.  This dessert was creamy and smooth.  

Biscuit Moelleux & Green Tea Ice Cream, Sweet Wine Gel√©e - 4.5 Stars - This is a nice play of green tea.  It was sweet ut not overly sweet.  The dish was subtle with some sweet flavors masked by the creaminess of the green tea.

This was a memorable dinner.  It was the best French Food we had on this trip.  The elegance of the restaurant, to the service, to the quality and flavors of the food made this a must go or must try restaurant.",RTcuhbxDIWFBUN335JPhsw,6,3,5,tCnJ1daV_-9kxijsnSw48w

Really a fantastic meal and amazing restaurant, everything from service, food, presentation, wine list, design and view are top notch.  The foursome I was with were so impressed we made a 2nd reservation as we were walking out to return in a few months when Chef Gagnaire is supposedly going to be in town and actually in the kitchen.  My first three star Michelin chef experience was even better than I expected.

We decided to go the a la carte route so we could share and try more things.  I could tell the direction this was going right from the start with the amuse bouche that included 6 different tastings.  Favorites here were the Tuna Mousse served with a rice based cracker and these irish jello shots (i can't recall what they were actually called but that is the best description I can come up)

Appetizers that stood out for me was the Lagostines served 5 ways and the scallops served 3 ways.  I ordered the veal but unfortunately they had run out, which in retrospect makes even me surprised I'm still willing to give Twist 5 stars.  The Lamb served three ways though made me quickly forget about the lack of veal.  This included a perfectly cooked lamb chop and a fantastic lamb shoulder dumpling.

Two at our table ordered the Rib Eye which was served two ways.  The grilled rib eye was great, but the 2nd plate of rib eye tips was a bit disappointing to some of us.  Another ordered the halibut which was probably my favorite of all the main courses.

For desert the souffle was amazing.

Overall the food here is fantastic, with incredible presentation.  The variety of techniques and presentation used is quite impressive.  I highly suggest to anyone looking for a special occasion type restaurant in Vegas or if you just feel like splurging on a great meal.",7ZModbt0gE3PZi3fwzxF4g,2,1,5,3MZ07_SOD1ZqkcZ4wgIE5Q

Our wine was great, but the food stole the show.

I also forgot to mention the amazing bread with French butter...oh la la!  My husband had the steak au poivre and said it was the best steak he has ever eaten...I tend to agree as I tried a small, tasty bite.

The dishes were wonderfully prepared, and brilliantly conceived! Everyone ordered an appetizer and an entree, a drink, and we were too full to even entertain dessert.

Perhaps because the restaurant is newly opened and the menu hasn't been perfected (well, that is still no excuse for overcooking beef)?

Unlike the other low rating reviewer - service was really good for us. ambiance and table seating and arrangement was also not an issue. The only problem we had was entirely on the food.

I like the different tasting dishes but some times it felt really disjointed and confused, as if it lacked something to tie all the small dishes together.  

The langoustine tasting was quite fun and interesting. While some of the dishes were  amazing, others were like, huh? And the sake shot? I was like..hum...not sure why they are doing a shot of sake when they just sold us a bottle of really expensive wine...didn't really enhance the langoustine or the overall tasting experience. 

My husband's steak was overdone. He ordered rare, and the beef came out barely pink. We didn't want to send it back and just decided to concentrate on my venison which was prob one of the best I have ever had. 

The dessert tasting was fun and exciting. It was like a flirtatious girl all dressed up ready for a night on the town. Lots of ""bling"" and once again, many of the components didn't really make sense all together.

For the main protein dish, they served a strawberry ice cream on the side but did not tell us if it was to be eaten together, before, or after. Melted strawberry ice cream does not go with Venison. They also served a meat pie that fit my impression of English food in general. The service was spot on and the restaurant was beautiful, but the 8 of is were underwhelmed overall.

My date and I ordered the five course tasting menu with the wine pairing. I usually cannot eat more than five courses because it seems like small bites but with everything else, it's just enough. The amuse bouche was a few fanciful things like gin jello and a spring radish salad. The first course was lobster with aioli and a grapefruit and mango salad. It was by far my favorite dish. The flavors were perfect and with the wine, it was simply divine. Other courses included a scallop and whitefish mousse that was decadent, a perfectly cooked main course of pork tenderloin, a poached egg course, and finally dessert. All of it was spectacular. 

The courses were presented in a way where we were not served too quickly so we could have a leisurely experience. But we were also not waiting forever for the next course.

2943632,2013-05-17,3,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"The first tip I have is just head to the elevator to the 23rd floor and hang left. Follow the gorgeous corridor of black lined with single flowered-vases into a forest of red paper butterflies hanging low on the ceiling. There, you will be greeted by a big smile and ushered to your seat by a helpful hostess. If you get there before dark, you see a view of the mountains surrounding Vegas. If you get there after dark, you will be surrounded by the lights of Vegas.

You see what seems to be a broken plate glued back together on your table and wonder. Then, you notice the walls of the restaurant also share the same theme. 

Next, the waiter comes and asks if you like to start your experience with a drink. If the answer is yes, a smartly dressed sommelier comes over and makes recommendations based on what you plan to order. You can also see their wine collection through the glass window of the 2d floor. And if you are not a drinker, they offer complimentary sparking or still water.

After you are done with your drink order, the waiter offers you the menu and walks you through the different menu options and assures you that the chef is flexible in letting you mix and match your tasting menu/prix fixe menu options. The waiter leaves you to mull over the menu.

As you read through it, the friendly hostess comes by and offers you a purse holder if you carried a purse or magazines to read during your meal if you are a solo diner.

When you turn to make eye contact with a waiter, he would immediately signal your primary waiter and he'd come over right away. He'd ask you if you had any questions. You state your preference and allergies. He'd recommend dishes and adjustments accordingly and asks if the recommendations are to your satisfaction.

You notice your glass is never empty and that the servers are alert and watchful of your needs.

The starter comes. Unfortunately you were on the phone so you don't know what is served. The waiter quietly puts down all the dishes in a specific pattern: A small refreshing gelee on a spoon, Chef's interpretation of buttered popcorn with 2 pieces of wafers, 3 mystery amuse bouchee that tasted really good and 3 pieces of bread: Crusty Baguette, Hard but Sweet Walnut Raisin and Soft and Savory buttermilk bread server with two small rounds of pattern butter. One with sprinkles of coarse salt and the other without. 

You try not to wolf everything down but you do anyway since its all good. You absorb the food and the view as the dishes are taken away and you wait for the first appetizer.

Much to your surprise, the Troi De Foie Gras feature 2 served hot and 1 served cold. Your waiter recommends you start with the Seared Foie Gras with Raspberry & Red Beet reductions, Spinach salad & Turnip, followed by a Foie Croquette in Black Truffle Coulis then the Marbled Terrine with White Port Gelee and Fruit Chutney. You wondered who on earth would pair Foie Gras with Raspberry. You take a tentative bite that contains the foie, turnip and raspberry piece. You experience an instant Foodgasm. You savor every bite.  You pull the Croquette close to you and wonder how to eat it. You split it in half with your spoon and is surprised to find molten foie oozing into the Black Truffle Coulis. You take a big bite and nearly choke from the flavor punch.  You push it aside in favor of the cold terrine. Its strong yet not as tasty as the seared dish. You decide to eat it with the baguette and the experience improves. 

Next comes the Shellfish Mariniere. You expected a tomato-based stew like concoction. Instead you are presented with 3 puffs of champagne? foam, thinly sliced cuttlefish, razor/clams and the yummiest gnocchi ever. Before you know it, you finish everything in a flash then notes that even though spinach always leaves a chalky after taste, the buttered sauce lingering in your mouth makes the chalky taste taste good.

You wonder if the Veal Tenderloin is going to be indian influenced or thai - green curry, sweet onion infusion, sauteed eggplant & pear, sweet onion puree sounds odd with veal. It comes. Beautiful uniform cuts. Pink in the middle. You take a bite. The green curry flavor is very light and unintrusive. As you continue eating your way down the line of veal cuts, you suddenly get hit but a burst of green curry flavor in the middle slice. You recover after deciding it wasn't so bad. The taste subsides as you continue digging in. The diced veal with sorrel is good but you are in verge of exploding from all the food already consumed.

The GRAND DESSERT comes. 5 dishes laid out in very specific order. Meringue, Rodolphe Biscuit, Tandoori Apple, RRRRaspberry & Chocolate Ice Cream. You take a bite of everything and decides the RRR + Choco combo taste good.

You ask for a menu to take home. You get a Gagnaire signed one. You beam and get beamed back.",8ReoSLJLCRtJx-JaFdUNSw,7,4,5,oaWT_5vh3kUA7JQDpZABYA

I can only say I am in love with the creations of Chef Pierre Gagnaire, and his staff at Twist. As such, it is an honor to write my 100th Yelp review for Twist!

Four of us were enchanted by the food and service, lead by our head server Sunday.  My love and I had a reservation at the Twist a couple of months ago when Pierre Garnier was in town...we exchanged greetings with him and took a picture, but we both were too sick to enjoy the meal..Sunday graciously canceled our reservation and sent a pot of tea to our room to recover...that's how Sunday won our heart in the first place, so we asked to have him as our server this time when we came with the beautiful and fun company of Ayumi K. and Phillip T. 

We opted for the 6 course tasting with wine pairing...wine pairings can be hit or miss depending on the expertise of sommelier and the quality of the wine, but at Twist it was superb. The food did not disappoint. I loved the Buffalo and the Seafood courses...as would be expected, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Frog Legs...so delicious and full of soul, truly welcoming. Still, my favorite dish of the evening was probably the Mediterranean Loup De Mer Carpaccio. Clean and refreshing, the delicate flavors were brought to life with horseradish infused milk cubes that accentuated this sexy dish that I will not soon forget.

Some say chef Pierre is the best chef alive and cooking in our era...I say he is the best chef who has the staff to put him on the map of fine cuisine...I would love to come back when chef is in town... I had better sharpen my French so I can give him a proper thanks.

Enjoyed fanciful cuisine served by an attractive woman who hit certain marks, yet somehow left me less than fully welcome. She never lingered or fawned. Some would see this as a blessing, but as I was dining alone, a trifle stronger sense of hospitality was in order. I never got that, although both the maitre'd and the bartender did get that element. I received a free cocktail from the maitre'd while waiting for my table on the thin pretext that it wasn't ready for me at the appointed time. Ok, I liked that!

Food was very good, although not every morsel was an epiphany. Should it be?

I had a $13 glass of Italian Pinot Grigio with my meal. 

Highlights: 5 different dessert elements served together to taunt the palate. Separate serving dishes brought together. Overall lovely and fun.

Venison tenderloin medallions with sculpted root vegetables. 

Homarus Americanus served three ways, together as one course.

The setting of the dining room.... Magical. 23 stories above the bright Las Vegas Strip, yet somehow a world apart.

When you go to a nice establishment and treated like a queen when you first walk into the door it sets a great presidence for the rest of your meal.

She even had a purse holder ready for the female guests. 

Once we ordered our drinks using their ipad, they gave us our menus and ample time to discuss our options. 

Our table got essentially every combination of the appetizer and meal option. Steak, lobster, pork, vegetarian and fish for the entrees and foie gras, crab, soup, cheese dish as the appetizer. all were amazing creation. They use various techniques from ice creamed blood sausage and cheese (two different dishes) to foams and gels with alcohol. Not only delicious but good conversation starters. 

Sounds like a small meal for the price, right? Well, they gave a ton of starters. We had the amuse bouche of a cucumber gel, squid ink biscuit, and three others that were all amazing spouts of flavor. And then bread. Each person received their own basket of bread. All were delicious. And they kept asking us if we wanted more. They each came out warm and wonderful. 

Through out our meal we were treated like royalty. A waiter was always watching our table to ensure we had everything we needed. Our plates cleared within a reasonable time (not too quickly, not too slowly) and cleaned our massive amounts of bread crumbs before each setting.

We had dined at Twist probably at least ten times since it first opened! We fondly remembered those wonderful early years under Pascal Sanchez, when he pampered his guests with the most creative and labor intensive dishes in LV, offering far better food, service and value than his competition over at Joel Robuchon and Guy Savoy, With the departure of Sanchez a few years ago though, Twist became just another ordinary high end restaurant under Kawasaki and another temporary chef, even though they had both spent years in Gagnaire's kitchens.
Answering our prayers, Don Frederic finally came to the rescue after a long delay, due to some visa problems, and proved to be worth the wait!
The creativity is back (of course Gagnaire had a big hand in that), and equally important the flawless execution of the dishes! Seafood are once again cooked to perfection, neither 10 seconds too short or too long, and that included the many shellfish dishes, always a challenge for even some of the best kitchens!
The lobster poached in green tea beurre doux; Alaskan king crab with Nigerian tandoori prawns; smoked haddock and scallop souffl√©; as well as the crispy langoustine were all done well enough to make Gagnaire proud and Eric Ripert looked over his shoulders. 
Apparently, I got a much different experience than Brian B. Luck of the draw? And I am not the most forgiving with seafood, having turned back a lobster even at the Michelin three starred L'Atelier in Hong Kong, not to mention many other restaurants, even returning a fish dish twice at one of them.
Bases on our first dinner at Twist under the helm of Frederic, it is by far the best restaurant in Las Vegas! Helpfully our update upon our next visit in October will be equally positive!",0pOtdueu5TpKd4Amf06WwA,1,0,4,qSF7dGaNCmvaITlVITi-EA

The decor is stunning, and the floor to ceiling windows offer a mesmerizing view from way up high on the 23rd floor.

The service was impeccable, friendly and helpful but not stuffy. Water glasses never got more than half empty, menu advice was helpful and knowledgeable, and we felt like royalty for the duration of our 2 hour meal.

The food was incredible. I love molecular gastronomy, but unlike WD50, Alea, or other mad scientist chefs, Twist used all the foams, gellees, and other tricks to accent excellent dishes, rather than the central focus.

The amuse bouche was creative, fun, and delicious, a very nice introduction to the chef.

I had the 3 course tasting menu with foie gras 3 ways, and lamb 2 ways. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and indulgently decadent. Wifey had the Las Vegas appetizer which features pear wrapped in red tuna sashimi, along with other treats like sweet corn and beet sorbets with popcorn. For her main, she had the John Dory which was also amazing, with fresh seafood cooked perfectly.

Grand Dessert Pierre Gagnaire is 5 courses of dessert inspired by traditional p√¢tisseries. They were all excellent. We each had different favorites.

Dinner for two, including cocktails, tax, and tip was $300. A fair price for one of the best meals we've ever had. The restaurant was nearly empty on a Friday night, which made for an intimate evening, although it's not a good sign.",KVehpTNCERwMGAx-h9MR-A,7,3,5,x43iq2GodNNtfEdNjWCF-w

I think I may have been far too young to be eating here.  Looking around the room everyone was in 40s - 60s.  Beautiful space.  The service was outstanding and almost too stuffy... Very ""French"" .

Starters:

Started out with a couple of sparkling roses.  I think this has to be my new favorite drink starter.  They have a couple of tasting menus but we opted out of it.  There's only so much food a girl can eat.

The warm scallop carpaccio which I hate to say... I found rubbery.  I'm sure how it was presented and served was no accident but I just didn't enjoy it.

Foie Gras -- 3 ways was not nearly the best I've ever had but good enough.
Poached Duck Foie Gras, Choucroute Garnie
Horseradish Emulsion Bouillon
Terrine of Duck Foie Gras marbled Dried Figs, Date Paste, Pimentos Pur√©e 
Shaved fresh Foie Gras, Tandoori Apple Reduction, Spinach Salad, Green Apples

Langoustine -- 3 ways was amazing!  Favorite was the tempura style.  I have to say it was my first time having langoustine.  It's not often seen on very many menus.

Pan seared with Terre de Sienne Spice, Cabbage Leaf & Celery Root Pur√©e 
Tempura, Baby Onion with Paprika
Tartar with Grapefruit Juice, Declination of Turnips

Main Courses:

Sea bass with lemon caviar & caper over green parmesan crumble & 
Nebraska veal chop.  These two dishes were executed to perfection!  Definite 10s for flavor, presentation and creativity!  The fish was so tender and flavorful.

Dessert:

Pistachio souffl√©, exotic fruit salad and petit fours.  The souffle was delightful.  Piping hot and raised beautifully.  The fruit salad was nothing out of the ordinary.  The petit fours were courtesy of the chef and they were amazing but by this time I was ready to explode so took a nibble of each piece just to sample.

The sommelier was young, knowledgable and technical when it came down to his selection for each food/wine pairing.  That's just great but IMHO I think food/wine pairing is more of an art.  I just felt he was too text book for my style.  Don't get me wrong the pairings worked, but I just prefer to have more creativity involved.  It can't all be about the science especially when it comes to culinary arts and cuisine.

Extras:

They've even got a gluten free/vegetarian menu and will ask if there are any food allergies.  Very accommodating as one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber.",zUe6ERJ_jVDawBof4emCkQ,7,5,4,Sayponm6Qqf-kALfHM738Q

Unfortunately the food was extremely disappointing for what you would expect from a place like this - especially with prices like this.

I thought that given the quality of the service we received, it wouldn't be fair to give Twist a 4-star rating. Because when I think of Twist, I don't think, ""Yay! I'm a fan"".. it's more, ""Food was good, BUT...""

When my friends and I arrived for our 10 pm Saturday night reservation, we were told by an unapologetic hostess that the party seated at our table was still working on their entrees and may or may not be ordering dessert. She suggested that we go take a seat at the bar and they will come get us.

After giving them 15 minutes to come get us, I decided to get the whole story. Apparently the party before us arrived late (about 30 minutes late for a Saturday night reservation) but they decided to seat them anyway. She didn't offer any apologies to compensate for the inconvenience. Plus, here's my other argument: what was the point of making reservations if they're just going to a) seat people whenever they show up and b) make people wait? We may as well have shown up sans reservation - I would've been less irritated.

The manager, as if to compensate for the rude hostess, came to find us and said that they would be paying for the drinks we have at the bar and he will personally come find us when our table was ready. When we finally got seated, the service was nothing short of obsequious. We were also presented with extra amuse bouche courses.

Although the food was delicious, I can't help but have that negative service taint my memory of this meal and this restaurant. A part of me feels bad because the manager and wait stuff really tried but I still can't get over the rude hostess.

This restaurant is truly worth every penny.  Everything from start to finish was amazing.  It was fine dining at one of its best.  Amazing and Fancy!

When I arrived, the host offered to take my coat.  The restaurant brought me a purse hook for my purse.   It hooks on to the table, so you don't have to hold your purse or put your purse behind your back.  The wine menu was on a iPad.  It was very user friendly to use while searching for the type of wine preferred.  The restaurant brought out complimentary individual servings of mini loaf bread with salted and unsalted butter and  little cookies. 

I got the New York Sirloin.  All the pieces of meat were cut the same exact size.  All the sides were cut and disposed of, while only serving the evenly cooked middle pieces.  You know its fancy when the restaurant starts wasting food.  Meat side pieces be gone! The meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was so tasty.  YUMMMM

The entire dinner was amazing while I had a incredible view of the strip the entire time.

Ordered the 3-course menu ($120/person) 
-Trio De Foie Gras - Amazing. The terrine had a really good sauce with it, the roasted foie gras was done very well, and the croquette version was something I've never had before and it was pretty amazing. I'd definitely order this again
-Maine Lobster - Generous amount of lobster but it was pretty much drenched the lobster itself. Still good but I think I prefer just to eat lobster in the simplest way. 
-Raspberries and basil -- an assortment of sorbets and forms all over the plate. Delicious but almost too much foam. 

Overall, the food was really good but there were a few detail missteps on the service. For example, my husband's martini had a lot of ice chunks in it and instead of just getting us a new one, they said they would just strain it. Even if that's all you really do, just lie to us and say you'll get us a new one. Or when they would switch out his utensils for new ones but forgot to do that to mine.  I'm being super snotty but when you consider how much you're shelling out, you kind of expect a little bit better quality service. Esp when you get top notch service at [unnamed  but well-known restaurant at MGMt] that only cost $30 more.

My foie gras appetizer came in 2 different forms/ways with apple ice cream. 

Savory way: Poached foie Gras with Morteau Sausage

Sweet way: Glenmorangie Glazed Duck foie Gras Terrine with ginger bread powders and hazelnuts
Olala... Yum Yum Yum! There is no other word to describe this dish! The second I put it in my mouth, it melted. Then all the flavors and aromas of foie gras and hazelnut just went together. Two thumbs up!

Apple ice cream was very refreshing after eating so much fatty foie gras.

Oysters & Langoustine:
Kumamoto Oysters were such a beauty. They were big, juicy and sweet. Nom!
Fanny Bay Oyster nage, Clams and leek was more like a soup to me. It was a very elegant dish.

Best part of the night was Chef Pascal Sanchez came and visited me and thanked me for coming. That was impressive...he's very generous with his time. Great overall experience....",K6JCL78slzd7i-IQQGUc1A,3,3,5,aVKdye8oD2AikuigSyG8rg

Our service team was led by Sunday. He is gracious, knowledgeable, and a consummate professional in his craft. Our evening was scheduled for us ahead of time with each course personally selected by the chef. Sunday was the perfect conductor for the show. 

I have included several pictures to show the beauty of a few of the plates. (Not all photos came out well.) These photos only do partial justice to the overall experience. 

The tastes were nothing short of divine. I had over 27 years in the culinary arts and am a culinary graduate myself. I told Sunday that throughout my career I tried several dishes worldwide that often elicited an emotional response to their perfection. Twist offered a side dish with one entree that brought a physical reaction like I've never felt. It was a simple potato side dish that sent a chill over my entire body. Quite exquisite to say the least. 

Do yourselves a favor and go to this restaurant. I guarantee you will be very excited that you did. My wife and I will absolutely return on our next visit to LV and are eager to spend another evening with our new friend Sunday.",6Nwtk0_zpnY9-FmysH2tWg,1,1,5,j_wB7OVUjN9CTnWEYv31Fg
3738814,2011-06-10,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"With Cirque tickets at the Bellagio @ 7:30, we came here for a pre-theatre dinner.  Which was a mistake, but more on that later.

We arrived for the earliest possible dinner seating at 5:30 sharp and were quickly shown to our table, which comes with a complimentary view of the strip.  We quickly ordered from the 3-course menu, which became a 4-course menu with the 5 amuse bouches at the start.  The only real miss was the red pepper mousse, which may have had a touch too much vinegar for my taste.  My first course of the foie gras degustation was nearly too much.  Of the 3 variations, the foie salad ended up being the most enjoyable.  The fiancee's butterfish looked amazing.  Next up was the lamb, which was slightly disappointing due to the fact that lamb doesn't inspire much of a unique experience.  Lastly, the 5 desserts (2 settings) finished things off nicely, with the passion fruit dish being the most refreshing.

At $105 for the 3-course, you are near the top end of the acceptable range.  However, the formula of food + view can't be beat.  My only real gripe at the end was how much we had to rush through the meal.  I felt that I had expressed enough concern about our 7:30 show that it would cause the waitstaff of promptly take our order.  Aside from that, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal, and look forward to visiting again.

4 stars, but I feel that we had an incomplete experience and would definitely allot more time and enjoy the full tasting.  The food wasn't as whimsical as the name ""Twist"" would inspire.  Nevertheless, we'll be back, soon I hope.",VIf9HbtAKcKs4llfD3GQPA,3,1,4,lFHejBqPGN37F7Llwh9LMw

I had langostine 5 ways, sweetbread, and foie gras 4 ways...so basically i had 12 dishes of food on top of the 5 amue bouches and the dessert. If you order an appetizer like langostine 5 ways...you literally get 5 different plates of langostine placed in front of you...grilled, seared, moussiline, gelee, and tartare. 4/5 were home runs...the weakest was the gelee. The sweetbread ( I LOVE sweetbread) and the foie were great too. dessert was called the ""red circle"" and was comprised of puff pastry, marzipan, marscapone cream, and one or two other elements I can't recall...but oh boy what a delicious end to the meal.

We made reservations early since we were on East Coast time and I'm glad we did because it was a 3 hour dinner. It was perfect as Twist is on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental and we were able to watch the sun go down and the night lights of Vegas come on. 

The hallway to Twist has a bunch of tree leaves and butterflies hanging from the ceiling and is absolutely gorgeous. The Mister and I started with a glass of wine at the bar and when our friends arrived, they carried our drinks to the table for us. Our lovely host (""waiter"" seems to not adequately describe his role) explained that the chef could make us a custom tasting menu because the Mister and I don't eat red meat. The couple with us did the same custom pescatarian tasting menu as we did.   

We first were brought bread, and as good as it was, I only nibbled because I didn't want to fill up knowing we were getting 5 plates to come. And, wow, did we ever get fed!  After the bread, we were brought  3-4 amuse bouche plates. When our dishes were brought out, there was an entire staff ready, so every one of us would get our plates at the exact same time. Our lovely host would explain each plate in detail. We had lobster, white asparagus, halibut...I wish I had been taking better notes. The whole experience was just phenomenal. 

Then we each got 4 plates of dessert!  We were thoroughly stuffed at this point, I have no idea how people can eat a 7 plate tasting menu!  Before we left, they gave us ladies at the table a parting gift of a small box of little meringues and nuts.  

Twist was an amazing experience that I feel lucky to have been able to share with wonderful friends. Twist has phenomenal service, outstanding food and is a memory I will cherish for a long time.",rLTfv7YGAdCqYjhIw1ipew,3,1,5,RA_NuMbQzkEvmYLu9Fk8ug

3955671,2018-02-22,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Second time dining here since I had too much to drink to truly enjoy my time here.

I'm in no expertise to describe my dining experience in detail. I was awestruck. The menu has changed since I've last visited in the summer. Winter menu surprisingly tasted much better than summer's. Plating here was just dishes of art after art. Everything was delicate but each bite was so powerful and memorable. You can taste so many flavors separately but they worked well with each other. I wouldn't consider the work as experimental. That would be the word I would use for describing my experience at Castagna in Portland. That was innovative and the chef was trying to break boundaries. Twist, like its name, likes to play with boundaries too, but not to step over them but by gently pushing them. Twist knew what worked and how to exemplify that experience. The dishes were unique, as in the combination was far more complex. I think that is best explained by using foie gras. Foie gras is offered at many restaurants, its a flavorful and heavy ingredient, can be easily overwhelming. I've only enjoyed it in traditional preparation, seared for the most part. Any New American attempts I've tried (outside of Castagna) just failed, a foie gras dish becomes gimmicky and not memorable. 

Almost all praises here. One dish I wasn't as agreeable with was the sea bass. Its a great protein to use for its many ways of preparation. However, when its slightly too salty and removes the freshness of fish. I think after so many dishes of excitement, I set the bar even higher. I was hoping to have the same level or better experience than my sea bass in chicken jus at the now closed Mix at Mandalay Bay. I really enjoyed my grilled fennel and venison. Despite of all the small sized dishes, I was too full to finish all the dishes served with my venison. That game pie was amazing. No words other than I hate my healthy life, it's interrupting my enjoyment of fine dining. 

Let's put aside all that food talk. I dined alone this second time and was able to enjoy the environment more than entertaining my guests. I felt like Rapunzel. For those who have seen Tangled, remember the scene where Rapunzel and Flynn sing I See The Light as they float towards the castle, being surrounding by lanterns? That was the feeling. There were round bulbs hanging at random heights, they were those lanterns. Except I'm not looking at a castle, I'm just looking at the hotels on the strip. Close enough. 

There is a business casual dress code here, so if you come in the summer, make sure you have something more than a pair of shorts. I was by far the youngest in the house. I didn't feel any disrespect like my meal at Lago. The staff took there time to provide a great dining experience, answered questions that I have.",w3iXYLy7b89aoDxfU96i5g,5,2,5,A7z3tMGGasBCTkRCQb6lIw
3972785,2015-01-06,9,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Three of us met at 7 PM for dinner.  Michael U had received notice from one of the employees at Twist that Chef Gagnaire would be in Las Vegas for a range of dates.  It was because of this we booked at this time.  The restaurant, on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in City Center, is elegant and the view is very good.

The three of us ended up getting a modified version of the grand tasting menu.  We were brought three rolls each and then the meal began.  First up was an amuse-blouche of two small bites with the server suggesting the correct order to eat the two. 

Course one was sea urchin mousseline with caviar.  There was gel√©e of bonito and grilled onion infusion and olive oil infused salsify spaghettini.  It was recommended that we mix the sea urchin with the spaghettini for the greatest flavor.  An excellent dish and an auspicious start for the evening. 

Course two was lobster fricassee with kaffir lime and enoki mushrooms, baby carrot stew and sweet wine and green tea butter and the dish was topped with some edible flowers.  The lobster was simply superb!

Course three was modified by us.  We added an extra course at an extra charge. It was carnaroli risotto with artichokes and pine nuts.  It was topped with some micro greens and a LOT of shaved truffles.  What a grand melding of flavors with the truffles and risotto and the pine nuts added a texture that made this dish another winner.

Next was time for a palate cleanser of some sorbet to ready us for the foie gras coming next.

Course four was the roasted foie gras with coffee and chestnut velout√©, prunes and porcini.  More truffles were shaved on this dish and it was absolutely sublime.  The sauce was so rich and the mushrooms with the foie were the tops!

Course five was another divergence on our part.  We asked if we could sub proteins and we could.  Instead of the American Wagyu beef, I got Muscovy duck.  It ha d a green pepper sauce and caramelized pear and pine nuts.  The duck was accompanied by whisky jus eggplant cannelloni with duck confit.  Another winner, but I don't think I need to keep stating that.  A very good switch.

Course six was a series of desserts.  One of them we added √† la carte--the mille-feuille with praline cream, cassis compote and blackberry sorbet.  We each took a third of this shared dessert but only one (me) slopped on the nice white linen.

The grand dessert course consists of three items: 1) Cassis: sorbet, wurtz, marmalade and cane sugar and pink pepper opaline; 2) Honey orange gel√©e, shortbread, mango and passion fruit topped with fromage blanc ice cream; 3) Chocolate gateau with golden raisins and Amarena cherries.   A suggestion was made in what order we should eat the desserts to get the fullest flavor profiles and it was a grand suggestion.  The dessert were rich, full of exceptional flavors, and very satisfying.  My favorite was the sorbet with grape halves that had been frozen and were around the sorbet.  A great concept.

Wait, we're not done yet.  Next we were brought a plate of three lemon meringue bites that had lemon filling between the two sections of meringue.  Each meringue bite was accompanied by three blueberries on an edible toothpick.

We're still not done--dessert six was brought for the three of us to share.  It was Gagnaire's Tanzanian chocolate parfait with coffee granit√© and caramelized hazelnuts.
This was rich, smooth, and a perfect chocolaty end to this grand tasting meal.

Service was outstanding as you would expect from Twist.  Chef Gagnaire came from the kitchen for a brief hello and the Chef de Cuisine, Ryuki Kawasaki, also came out and chatted with us for a short time and talked about his upcoming move to Bangkok, Thailand.

Before leaving, we each received a signed menu from both chefs with the date.  A keepsake for sure!  We also got a small package of two biscotti with the Twist logo to take with us.  Our jackets were waiting for us at the host's stand and we were helped on with them.

My only complaints are that a few of my dishes were very salty & a bit heavy on the cream. I know it's French, so I should have been prepared for this, but it somewhat took away from the natural flavors of the food - let the food be the star! Also, none of the dishes really wowed me - and none of the dishes did I wipe my plate clean, which I do think says something. Canada's (american) wagu was yummy, but honestly a bit dry for the way it was cooked (medium rare...so how could it be dry?) and his lobster was drenched in a sauce that, again, took away from the natural flavors of the food.

Cooking technique was perfect -- of that, there is no question.  I really think, if you do come here, ordering a la carte, must be the way to go.  Then you can create your own menu of their dishes which clearly use lovely ingredients but are more simply prepared and straightforward.

I got seafood dishes for entrees and so did one other person in our party and we both thought our meals were over cooked. I got the lobster and my friend got the fish. Each was a little rubbery. For a dish that costs 70 dollars it should be perfect. 

My appetizer was also subpar. I got a sort of Thai fish cake soup and although I will admit the soup was good I thought it was a tad over salted and lacked complexity. And the fish cake leaned heavily on needed the soup for any flavor as it was completely bland on its on.

We also got a few bottles of wine. One we had to send back because it had turned. The restaurant staff and our server in particular balked at our claim that the wine was bad. But we had a man in our group that was from the region in France that the wine comes from and knows the man who makes the wine in France. He knew that the wine wasn't supposed to taste this way. If it had just been me I might have backed down lacking the confidence in my knowledge of wines to confront the server or sommelier at the restaurant.

The rest of the time though the staff was very nice and the service was great. The server even brought me a side dish or gnocchi which I liked.

I would imagine that a 1200 dollar dinner for six would be better than what we got. Maybe my expectations are too high but then again I can remember meals that have been worth that. This meal just didn't make the cut.",ybu_tLGsQfTo1S9EDvk42Q,1,1,3,4n2BzwRPBv13u93hEUTWUg

Goodies - O-M-G. The tuna apricot spread was heaven! The cheese cracker w/ a curry creamy cheese filling was to die for (perfect balance of spice and creaminess). The almond savory cookie was delicious! (tempted to ask them to bring me a box).. The Guinness beer jelly was the perfect cleanser to get ready for the next course! 
The bread service: this place probably has the best baguette outside of France. I also love the brioche because it was not greasy. 
First course - tuna cubes x foie gras cubes: it is a beautifully done starter. love it! 
Second  course -bster in 3 ways: the lobster was cooked perfectly. Tender. beautiful. The three methods (one is just poaching. But the other one was a small lobster salad and the last one was like a custard). Each of the dishes tasty and yummy!
Third course - scallops with clams & oyster: O-M-G. This is a killer. The plate looked simple (raw scallops pieces covering clams/oyster plus a sea urchin puree plus a foam). But the flavor profile was complex: you can taste the freshness and sweetness of each shelf fish but none of the shelf fish over powers the other. The chef strike a perfect harmony to balance each of the delicate flavor. We love this course so badly. It showcased the ability to bring out freshness and beauty of each ingredients in a very genuine manner. 
Fourth course - sole w/ a beer citrus sauce and a cream sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly (duh). But the sauce was to die for!!!!
Then we had our palette cleanser with green beans and mushroom. Very TASTY! 
Fifth course - veal with a grand marnier horseradish gelato. I'm not a big fan of horseradish so I just used very little. However, when I had a bite of veal with the red cabbage and grapes and the gelato - it just made sense! 
Sixth course - the grand finale of 5 desserts! It has a lemon cake, a jelly/moose (don't exactly remember what it was - just remember it was not very sweet), a fig crumble with buratta ice-cream, a rolled chocolate cake, and a ice-cream pom-pom with raspberry sorbet. We were shocked to see the number of desserts presented to us. The jelly/moose and the fig crumble definitely required an open mind as they were not a sweet dessert (very very very lightly sweet - even for a Chinese who doesn't like sweet stuff - those two items are really not that sweet). But the whole dessert course was beautifully designed and executed.


We had a great time at this place on last Friday night. We were also shocked that the restaurant was empty at 6PM. The restaurant started to fill up when guests  arrived starting at ~7:15ish. So for the first hour of our meal, we pretty much have the restaurant to ourselves. haha! definitely feel special in that sense. Guess if you want to experience private dinning w/o paying a leg and an arm - try to book an early reservation! :)",TqF8mPAEql3EQpHXeo_bEw,2,1,5,H9Nxe6hP_zhxLj9Q26X6Vw

The place is very classy, bright but not overwhelming. Enough so you can see your food and the interesting interior design. floating butterflies and candle balls fill the ceiling.  And large cracked patterns on the wall.

The menu is deceptive, since the tasting menu has only 6 courses...but in reality, each course was a trio....so, its almost getting 18 courses.  
We thought  6 courses would not be enough, so we elected to order an extra dish (foie gras).  
The meal was very interesting, and well prepared. Some of the flavors of the smaller dishes were a bit off or unfamiliar which threw me off a bit.  But the rest of the main dishes were well executed but i felt none of them really became the climax or was the center stage. Everything was just very consistent.  It was creative and great to look at...but nothing really was very memorable.  It kind of reminded me of my dinner at SONA when it was still open.  nice to look at but very flat in the flavor arc.

I think my favorite dish looking back is the Scallop & langoustine.
The wine pairing was good as well...but since the menu was mostly light and seafood heavy....the wine were mostly whites.  We probalby only had  2 reds....A Sangiovese and a Cabernet Sauvignon.

I feel that the dishes are great, but somehow didn't work to elevate each other. Maybe it was the sequencing or the off flavors reset the anticipation.",WNyOBsMWSqxqJf1ppzfe4Q,3,0,3,I0-Lzy7loHxEAbQIeoauQQ

My spouse and I recently took a culinary tour of Las Vegas. We ate out 2-3 meals a day, and each meal was pre-planned and exhaustively researched. Nothing could have prepared us for the Twist experience. 

Before our entrees arrived, we were presented with an assortment of amuse bouche that included parmesan croutons, chicken with paprika and beet sauce, nori-wrapped butterfish with a green apple gelee, goat cheese tartlets and an  incredible tuna foam with tiny lavash sticks. 

I ordered the organic salmon, which was perfectly prepared and served with a mix of aromatic herbs, a fondue of chicory, shitake and celery, and a small dish of fennel ice cream with a cucumber gelee and sweet potato puree. The latter was unlike anything I've ever tasted before- incredibly rich and savory for an ice cream. I also ordered the zezette broth (herbs, coconut milk, gnocchi and vegetables) a la carte, which was a wise decision, as it ended up being my favorite part of the evening.

My spouse had the venison filet, which was garnished with juniper berries, black peppercorns and black radish. His was served with salsify and a Grand Veneur ice cream that he described as ""incomparable."" 

For dessert, I had the lemon cake, which, while still delightful, was my least favorite dish. The cake itself was just a bit too dry/dense for my taste; although the accompanying green apple sorbet was delicious. 

Our check arrived with another tray of small bites: candied blueberries on friend spaghetti skewers, blueberry cookies and a pistachio nougat that was to die for. 

Service was exceptional. Ladies chairs were held for them whenever the need to stand arose; hooks were provided for purses, and I was even offered water for the flowers I had been carrying when we arrived.

4247042,2012-06-24,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"At the end of dinner, we were asked to vacate our table so another couple could be seated! More on that below, here is a full run-down of the evening:

We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental (which was lovely) and were fortunate enough to book a Saturday evening reservation at Twist. We arrived for our 6:30pm reservation and much to our delight we were seated at a window-front table. My husband and I both ordered the 3-course tasting menu with wine pairing. A series of small, tasty and interesting canapes were the first items that arrived. The appetizer course that followed was kind of disappointing. I ordered a trio of seafood dishes which were good but not outstanding (with the exception of the lobster with miso gelee which was excellent) my husband's skate appetizer was just bizarre, the flavors were off-putting and didn't make any sense together. The main courses were very solid, duck for my husband (tender and flavorful) and John Dory for me (wonderful, very creative foie gras mousse with red wine gelee and it works!). The five small desserts were also terrific, we enjoyed everyone of them. Following dessert we ordered tea and coffee and after finishing 2 cups (~15 min), we let our waiters know that we were ready for the check. I signed the check when it arrived and it was collected after a few minutes (isn't this a restaurant faux pas?). Approximately 5-10 minutes after the bill was collected a man in a gray suit (perhaps one of the managers? Regrettably I did not get his name) approached our table. He requested that we vacate our table so that another couple could be seated at our window table. He mentioned that my husband was welcome to finish his tea at the bar but the other couple had been waiting for a window table for over an hour and they were getting impatient and threatening to leave. What!?!?! I just dropped $500 for dinner and now you want me to leave so that you can flip my table?!?!?! We were only sitting there a total of 2.5 hours, which based on the other reviews, is about the standard amount of time that the 3 course tasting menu requires. I was initially very embarrassed, (I was made to feel like it was our fault that the other couple had been waiting so long) so we immediately left but after I had some time to stew about it, my husband and I returned to confront the man in the gray suit.

When we returned to confront him, he was initially completely unapologetic, he said that he ""didn't think that it was a big deal"" for us to vacate our table for the other couple, he thought that we would understand that they had been waiting for a window table for over an hour and they were getting very hungry and upset. As it became evident that I was not going to leave without some sort of apology, he conjured up a modest ""I'm sorry"" and continued to insist that he had done nothing wrong by asking us to vacate the table. 

I also sent an email to the address listed on the Twist website to complaint about the rude behavior of the man in the gray suit. They did send an email with a genuine apology and said that they spoken with their management about our experience to insure that it never happens again but that was the end of it. As far as retribution, I don't quite know what I wanted but sometimes words just aren't enough; the experience soured our whole evening and colored the way I felt about the entire weekend trip to Las Vegas.

I recommend that you experience the other fine dining options in Vegas, Robuchon was fantastic and is about the same price if you choose your beverage options carefully. The food at Robuchon was a level above Twist and the service and ambiance was also superior.",1U5nikASwP6t5Ukaa8qZEQ,3,1,3,tJ50SN2JEjnw8E23x2r8-g
4250530,2015-01-07,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"After a long day of travel from the East Coast, we were very much looking forward to a nice relaxing diner.  After navigating around the Google party being held at the bar just off the elevators, we made our way down to the restaurant.  We were seated at nice window table for two with a nice, bright view of the Strip.  The building height screen just to the north would periodically display our Chef's image advertising Twist.

The dinner began with the amuse bouche, a whiskey/Guiness gel√©, which I enjoyed for it's uniqueness and a curried crunchy ring filled with goat cheese.  That was followed by a small parmesan cake bite that was delicious and perfect with the Cabernet that I was drinking.  The bread was accompanied by fresh butter, salted and unsalted.  The salted butter was incredible - how do you get excited about butter? It reminded me of the butter that I tasted in my youth in France - pure, creamy, heaven.

For our appetizers, I had the scallops with caviar and my wife had the foie gras.  The scallops were perfectly cooked to melt in your mouth.  As a native New Englander, I am picky about my scallops and these were perfectly prepared.  They were topped with some crumbled egg, very thinly sliced red onion, and a tease of caviar.  Having married into a Russian family, I have developed a taste for caviar and a larger serving of caviar on each of the scallops would have been just right for me.  But there is the cost consideration, so that was ok.  The foie gras was pan seared and bathed in a juniper berry sauce - really nice combination.  Ford gras is always fantastic.

For the main course, we ordered the venison and the duck. Both were perfectly cooked and the flavors were delicious.  The venison was so tender, like a perfect piece of filet, but with flavor.  It was accompanied with some deep fried pork belly  pieces that were pure delight on a bed of sweet potato puree.  The duck breast was thinly sliced and wrapped around some stewed pears and onions.  Just incredible.  And both servings were large enough that we were actually full before we finished them.

We finished with tea and a shared dessert - rum baba.  Perfectly spongy, it absorbed the rum poured over it at the table as it sat in a pool of fresh mango chunks and puree.  A little chantilly cream on top finished it off nicely.  Exceptional.

Finally, the service was excellent - cheery, prompt, and precise.  I love this place!  It was my second time dining there and I may make it an annual ritual.",uV7n7QCL3hwfTdcX__XiHQ,0,1,5,KpOn8iTGZSoi-9Q7N3a3Mw

The food and service are michelin star worthy.

They always bring an array of amuse-bouche. Each piece is completely different from the next, which leaves you with about 8 different tiny yet immensely flavorful experiences before your meal even starts.

I am generally one to pass on the bread at any restaurant, but here, the hand crafted salted butter they import from France makes me eat all three of the different breads they provide to each guest. Also, don't be shy to ask for more. They know how good it is, and completely understand why you need another round. 

The wine list is intense, but creative. Their sommelier does a great job having an assortment of classic labels and somewhat unknowns to even the above average consumer. Also, if nothing jumps off the page at you, they are always more than happy to help pair you with a bottle that is likely to satisfy you from other wines you have enjoyed previously. 

Cannot go here and not try their Langoustine appetizer. This dish alone could get me on a plane back to Vegas. 

As far as main course, the American Wagyu and Rack of Lamb dishes have left me in awe. They are the highest quality meat, and always cooked to perfection. 

I have been here several times, and have yet to ever have a dish let me down.

4525837,2011-08-05,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Let me preface my take by giving full disclosure.  I got food poisoning after eating here which put me out of comission for an entire day.  When you are in Vegas, being out for an entire day sucks!  I mention this because I want to write an unbiased review.  

First, this restaurant is very elegant.  The food is inventive and really cool visually.  The service is top notch and everyone was very friendly.  Unfortunately, I thought the food fell short on taste.

The hottie and I were vacationing in Vegas, living it up at Cosmopolitan, so I thought we would have a very nice dinner at Twist.  We decided to get the 3 course tasting menu and we added the CaliforniaDuck Foie Gras appetizer.  One thing I really give Pierre props for is that one course for him is like 3 different courses.  So our 3 course tasting menu plus a foie appetizer ended up being like a 12 course dinner.

We started with a series of canapes.  While I enjoyed the canapes I thought they were almost too small to really be enjoyable.  I would much prefer 2 really tasty amuse bouche to the canapes.  

For appetizer course I got the Summer in the City which is a shrimp and pork belly in a broth, a shrimp mousseline, and a foie gras ice cream.  It was good but not great.  Nice clean flavors.  The foie gras ice cream was surprisingly tasty.  The hottie got the Langoustine.  Gotta say that this was excellent.  Langoustine was cooked perfectly and the curry was a nice flavor.  We also go the California Duck Foie Gras appetizer added on.  I suspect this may have been the offending dish for me.  Anyway, the foie gras terrine was very rich but I prefer a cooked foie to the cold foie.  The shaved foie over sorbet was a bit weird for me.  The sour sorbet went well with the creamy foie I guess but..... ya a bit weird.  The foie parfait with diced duck breast was my favorite.  Nice smokey flavor from the duck went very well with the creamy foie parfait.

Here comes one of my biggest complaints.  If you are gonna have a tasting menu and you are gonna charge $100+ for it, don't have chicken as your main course.... or at least give us a choice.  Unfortunately, we had to settle for the roasted chicken breast with pistachio almond paste for our main course.  Not good.  The chicken was tender but a bit dry.  The pistachio almond paste did nothing to add to the chicken and in my opinion was just a flavorless paste.

We ended with the Grand Desserts which consists of 6 different desserts.  I commend Pierre for his many creative choices.  The interesting thing was that I could really taste the alcohol in the desserts.  So if you are an alchie you will love this place.

I just can't give it any more than 3 stars because I thought the food was average.  It looked better than it tasted.  Don't know that I will go back again.",MJ0Wphhko2-LbJ0uZ5XyQA,3,0,3,zOO4lJkLLxNbi5bij9NLUg

During our meal, we remarked on how different and experimental everything was.  And tasty.  And the portion sizes were...ok.  And everything was... good.  And slightly weird. But tasty.  

The desserts were the only serious disappointment.  My boyfriend described the dessert portions as insulting.  I was disappointed by the serious lack of chocolate.  I love chocolate.  Passion fruit isn't really my thing.  

In the end, we spent $450, which includes tip and two glasses of wine.  And we kind of regret it.  

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, and so peaceful and quiet.  A wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. The service was good.  Efficient but not obtrusive.  We actually had more of a rapport with the food runner, Louis, than anyone else.  Maybe our waiter was upset that we didn't order a $200 bottle of wine.  Whatever.

Everything was fine.  But nothing knocked our socks off.  

We love eating out.  I may even go so far as to call us ""foodies"".  The problem with Twist is, a year from now, I doubt I will be able to recall exactly what we ate.   I probably will be able to describe the decor, but not the food.

4593234,2016-05-31,4,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Dinner at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire was my most hotly anticipated night out of 2016.  It's not everyday that I make reservations to a restaurant well over a month in advance, anxiously counting down the days.  

Of course, with anticipation for Chef. Gagniere's culinary creations running high, so were the expectations.  Thankfully, Twist didn't just meet my expectations; it exceeded them completely.  Most importantly, a meal at Twist is more than just a meal -- it's a culinary experience that anybody who enjoys creative, avant-garde food should try at least once.

Reservations were at 6pm on a Friday evening.  Just finding Twist is a bit of an adventure, since you have to take the Mandarin Oriental elevator up to the 23rd-floor sky-lobby, and then follow a discreetly labeled, dimly lit corridor to the restaurant.  Once there, though, I was greeted by beautiful glass, butterfly sculptures, and a bouncy, energetic host.  Before long, I was whisked away to a window seat with a breathtaking view of the Strip, with Sauvignon blanc in one hand and a decadent spread of bread and butter in the other.

Twist offers an a la carte menu, but it's way more fun to order a tasting menu.  I recommend the 5-course tasting, which provides a massive, extravagant feast without a stratospheric price point.  In actuality, it's far more than 5 courses, once the various amuse bouches, palate cleansers, and desserts are counted.

Here's the rundown of what I tasted:

** ARRAY OF AMUSE BOUCHES: This included 6 (!!!) distinct items, ranging from a savory cheese pastry, to a martini jello shot-type thing.  
** FIRST COURSE: Poached black cod with black olive gel√©e, star anise-scented potato mousseline, and summer herbs.
** SECOND COURSE: White asparagus with smoked salmon, asparagus/tarragon velout√©, and mortadella.
** THIRD COURSE: Lobster souffle with fennel, peas, fava beans, and calamansi citrus beurre deux.
** PALATE CLEANSER: Spicy grapefruit sorbet with yogurt cream.
** FOURTH COURSE: Rabbit saddle with root vegetables, nougatine, sweet and sour jus, and cold terrine of rabbit leg rolled in herbs.
** SIDE DISHES: Green bean/sesame salad, ratatouille, morels with coffee, and Swiss chard/bacon gratin.
** FIFTH COURSE: Grand dessert consisting of 5 (!!!) distinct items, ranging from a strawberry pastry, to a mango tart, to panna cotta served in a martini glass.
** PETIT FOURS: An array of four different candies, including a French macaron, chocolate candy, and jelly candy.

The word to describe all of these items is *complex*.  This is food that makes you think, challenges your palate, and expands your idea of what food should taste like.  It's exciting, it's bold, and it's (if you're a food nerd) it's a lot of fun too.

The service at Twist is just as entrancing as the food.  The staff was eager to get all of my feedback -- positive and negative -- about every dish, in an attempt to further refine the ever-changing menu.  When I casually mentioned that the cheese pastry was my favorite of the amuse bouches, one of the small army of servers tending my table brought out a whole plate of them -- at no charge.  The staff at Twist go above and beyond to pamper their guests, and the effort pays off nicely.  A nice touch was the souvenir menu given to me as a parting gift.

In the rarefied spaces of upscale Vegas dining, Twist truly stands out.  Nobody else in town is doing food as innovative, clever, and thoughtful as Chef. Gagniere, so check out Twist if you have a chance!",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,11,5,5,Utx4Jw-hJcRwzKKe7iZNdQ

Everything was prepared well and the service was exceptional, but I just wasn't wowed. Maybe my expectations were set too high. For what it's worth, my favorites were the octopus with cauliflower and a grape gelee along with a perfectly executed scallop dish. The BF's favorite was the foie gras and game meat wrapped in a puff pastry served in a red wine reduction. That was easily the best wow dish, in terms of both skill and execution. At the end of it all, I just think there are other better and more reasonable fine-dining options in Vegas.",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,2,3,3,Ku-JJYWiaGv1-8AwfWDd0g
4651034,2010-04-27,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"There wasn't a single mis-step in the entire evening. Despite the high ceilings and the glass-wall view of CityCenter, the restaurant actually feels intimate. The entry is basically a wide place at the end of a hallway. There's a four-seater bar right at the door, then tables pretty much in two narrow aisles the length of the room with a raised area at the end. Every table would have a view, so no worries there (though we did get seated windowside, which was nice). Service throughout was magnificent; they're obviously proud of the restaurant and the menu, but they're not obnoxious about it.

The menu encompasses a huge range of items. Chef Gagnaire's signature, indicated by the restaurant's name, is his playful nature with food and putting unusual items together. My halibut came with a side of hibiscus gelee. Black cod came with asparagus ice cream. Get the picture? It was all very fun and a fascinating culinary exercise. Even if the exotic additions don't work for you, never fear--most of these things come on the side so you can add them or not. If you like the main ingredient of the dish, you'll be satisfied. Fish is still fish and meat is still meat; this is not one of those French places where they cover the food under a thousand heavy sauces. It's clean cooking. I give special marks to the halibut in lemongrass broth. 

Portions are quite large, and in addition they brought out several amuse bouche items, including a tuna whipped with chantilly cream on rice crackers. (Whipped fish? Delicious!) There was also a memorable palate cleanser of Jack Daniels/Guinness gelee sprinkled with gingerbread crumbs. Really doesn't sound like it would be a palate cleanser, but it was. At the end of the meal, there's a plate of petit fours. Also, the chef sent out a complimentary side of steamed vegetables with our main courses. Very nice touch, considering the high prices. Value-wise, I thought it was good. The desserts and a couple of the appetizers were maybe a touch overpriced, but the quality is so high it's hard to quibble much. At the end of the meal, they asked for feedback on the menu and were willing to listen to even the smallest suggestions. We got the impression they plan to rotate items frequently. 

A stop in the Mandarin Bar for a (very expensive) pre- or post-prandial cocktail is a must.",G87zEbu0oPpYzmn4LUMC3g,3,1,5,v1R9I8BTEbJakf4TCiAEwg
4677571,2013-02-26,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"This is a fancy place with a very romantic entrance leading from the 23rd floor hotel lobby of the Mandarin Oriental. It feels private and exquisite as you walk into the restaurant, and should you be seated next to the giant floor to ceiling windows, you will get a good view of the strip as well.

They have a tasting menu, but you can also mix and match your own 2- or 3- course meals. We opted for the 2-course meal because we only managed to reserve an early dinner spot and *gasp* made the mistake of eating too much lunch.

We started with an array of breads and a palate cleanser, which are all very delicious. Which is bad because I then proceeded to stuff myself with bread. Then I had the popcorn soup -- the soup itself was a bit too creamy for me, but the king crab salad that came with it was delightful, fresh, and crisp.

My entree was the dover sole & prawns. While the dover sole felt a bit rubbery, the sauce was nice and delicious, and the prawns just blew me away. Very solid dishes. The mister's consisted of a very nicely done piece of steak, onion rings (!), and grilled vegetables that just melt in your mouth. That was definitely a superior entree.

One thing of note is that each course of the meal was served with an array of dishes. It reminds me of certain Asian cuisines, and is an interesting way to present the food. It's even the same way if you get the special dessert -- you get a couple little plates of different sorts of desserts to sample, and all were very good, especially the blackberry petrified in sugar.

A little complaint: the service was nice, but with the price tag on the food, not nice enough comparing to some of the other similar places I've been.",x0i6NgHySrXWgb17gVMTuQ,2,1,4,6XsCzjX4fCqtqq14HekXhA

We had an amazing view of the Vegas strip. The service was extremely attentive (waiter, assistant waiter & sommelier) wothout a hint of stuffiness or pretention. We were given the option of a tasting menu or an a la carte one. We went with the a la carte option. The menu was the most challenging I have encountered to date. Some of the flavor combinations just do not expect to make sense. Any of my misconceptions were wiped clean by the 5 canap√©s. There was a tuna chantilly (yes a tuna whipped cream of sorts) served with rice crackers that we could not get enough of. Also, the Jack Daniels & Guiness gelee was worth a mention. 

For appetizers we had the Sonoma county Foie Gras degustation & the langoustine 5 ways. The foie was expectedly good. The seared and terrine preparations were as expected. The custard with lentils and zucchini was simply luxurious. The croquettes were a bit of a miss. All in all a sizable heart clogging serving of foie goodness. As good as the foie was was, I was blown away with the langoustine. Strong Asian flavors and the five offerings comprised of a sashimi style preparation that was the star of the evening. For entrees I had the John dory, which was the best John dory I have had to date. The sauce with the bed of mussels brought the whole dish together. My girlfriend had the lamb that was served three ways. The heirloom tomato, lamb leg napoleon had strong middle eastern flavors and was the best preparation among our entrees. Before I forget to mention, the whipped potatoes were in a league of their own. A nice combination of butter, potato and cream in the most amazing pleasantly pasty texture. My words are lacking the eloquence to accurately describe these potatoes.  The sommelier was nice enough to pair wine from the restaurant's by the glass list. She even paired a muscat that was not on the menu by the glass with my foie appetizer. 

For dessert we had the souffl√©. The real deal, enhanced by some cacao water. A pistachio cream ball encased in chocolate was a nice addition. Excellent coffee &  petit fours ended the amazing meal.

4855721,2013-03-24,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"one of the best meals i've had in recent memory.

first of all, the mandarin oriental is gorgeous. if i become filthy rich, i would definitely choose to stay here. a perfect way to describe it would be: understated luxury, which at first blush is at odds with flashy las vegas, but it just has enough flair to still give you that unmistakable sense that you're in sin city.

anyway, about twist: there's clearly a reason why pierre gagnaire is among the world's most celebrated chefs- the food is deceivingly simple, yet incredibly fresh and delicious. this being vegas where you're supposed to throw caution to the wind, i sprang for the japanese wagyu steak with black truffle, because: why the heck not. and i was rewarded with the creamiest, smoothest, tastiest beef i've had in a long time. also, i'm a truffle whore, so that dish was phenomenal all around.

small but outstanding wine selection. when the waiter asked me (by name; he addressed me by my last name the entire time) how my meal was, i commented that the the 97 barolo that i had was really good (and surprisingly affordable). when he came back, he had the sommelier in tow who wrote down the name of the wine and 2 other similar recommendations on the back of his business card. he also asked if i wanted it emailed to myself, i said sure, so he asked me to enter my email address on the wine section on the ipad (oh yeah, they ask at the beginning if you prefer paper or ipad for the menu, lol). so that was nice and helpful and convenient.

service was excellent, as you might expect from a restaurant of this caliber. decor was outstanding- again, in line with the design of the hotel, it's subdued but thoroughly elegant. love the glass globes overhead that, when seen at certain angles, would seem to float in mid-air. also check out the bathroom- with its own view of the strip.

I was invited here for a business dinner as a client. So they certainly offered some of the best items in house. The rib eye in red wine, simply seasoned salt and pepper , medium rare, is one of the best slab of meat I have had in a while. So juicy, tender, perfect muscle/fat propotion and you can tell the meat is from top quality grassfed animal. Cherry (or should I say berry) on top, the wine pairing was a luscious Cali Cabernet from Justin Winery that showed bouquet of strawberry, raspberry and blackcurrant aromas, balanced acidity and tannin. Perfect match for the rib eye.

Other highlights include the bouquet of  herb salad with tartare of fruit and veggies - it was spring garden on a plate! 

Finishing strong with equally impressive Simone -
 roasted pineapple with pink peppercorn , kirsch parfait bar coated in dulcey chocolate. Was sweet, spiced and savory; not too sweet as I worried about. It was irresistible even for a dessert-avert like me:)  And I adored the presentation: dots of dacquoise made of oliveo, lemon , licorice and raspberry rose, precariously, leaving a trail, a hint, leading to the chocolate bar. How fun!

The view, oh the killer view of the Vegas Strip from my table by the window worth a visit on its own and pushing the dinning experience to next level. Service was attentive without being intrusive. That is one crucial element I define fine dinning.

The foie three ways contained my favorite dish of the night, a cold shaved foie salad (bed of spinach), fresh apple and a vinegar based a sauce. The final course was the signature green coconut based broth with corn and gnocchi. Simply the lightest and most delicious broth.

Straight to the food.  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau sausage.  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky flavors all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, ""nuggets"" of a foie terrine ""glazed"" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and spicy gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery taste of the foie.  Delish.  Apple ice cream on the side; perfect.

The Dover sole & prawns is hard to top.  The orange scented fish (""glazed"" with orange cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel cream and vegetal flavors of turnips, coriander, and spinach.  The addition of prawns adds sweetness and a nice oceanic flavor.  Complex yet refreshing dish.

The list of great dishes goes on and on.  

The degustation menus are the best way to sample Twist.  Portions are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand desert).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.

5113514,2011-12-08,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"In my mind, Pierre Gagnaire is famous for two things:  having one of the most expensive restaurants in Paris, and working with the concepts of molecular gastronomy in a very subtle way.  Others may be doing spherifications and powders and foams and gels and whatnot, but Gagnaire uses these concepts to make food that is innovative and interesting without forgetting its roots.

Twist delivers on both of these in spades.

We've been twice in the last two years.  It's a fancy, expensive restaurant.  Service has been both friendly and impeccably formal.  Not necessarily flawless ( they had some bar issues on our last visit ), but properly apologetic about the few flaws.  They were very accommodating when we requested a few modifications to the tasting menu.

They make some very interesting and flavorful cocktails.  They know their wine list well.  The pours on their wine pairing are ... more than adequate.  As they should be, given the price.

And the food - intricately crafted.   Yes, the portions are reasonably small ... but amazingly complex in construction and flavor ... yet balanced.  Nothing in your face - you have to pay attention to what you are eating to get your money's worth - but if you are the type to look closely at what you're eating and take the time to savor it, you *do* get your money's worth - from the set of small tastes that begins the meal all the way to dessert a few hours later.

To reach the restaurant, you take elevators directly from the ground floor entrance, turning left out of the upstairs elevator lobby.  I should say that the restaurant was not very crowded when we visited last - it's a beautifully decorated space, modern yet subdued, with wonderful views down onto the strip.  I hope that they weather the current trend toward more casual dining in Las Vegas; this is a restaurant I'd like to revisit.",JjTusdmnjHxKe-Kqwr0YGA,5,3,5,1A32O54_V7dGTQQ4SnPiig

Gorgeous with a great view.  Service was excellent, not as amazing as Guy Savoy but this place is not nearly as expensive so I felt that the level of service was appropriate - 1 server and 1 assistant. Every amuse Bouche or similar tastes came in multiples so there was quite an array of tastes to sample.  Bread and butter was great, incredibly rich French butter.  A5 steak was so amazing, fatty and tender and perfect.  French sea bass perfectly prepared.  I highly recommend and can't wait to return.

Our main server named Sunday had a great sense of humour yet very professional.  After dinner they invited us to have a tour of the kitchen and meet the chef as well.  It's an experience I'll never forget.  The food was amaaaaazing.  I got the wagyu beef and it tasted like butter - it melted in my mouth! The pur√©e potato I got on tbe side was the best I've ever had as well. I could go on but I rather people just go and try for their own experience.

5231951,2011-02-24,4,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I chose Twist for my birthday dinner - having been to most of the other top restaurants in town, I was wanting to try something new and different for my birthday. It was a pleasant evening, but based on the prices and reputation of the chef I'm going to have to grade this place a little harshly. I'm going to draw several comparisons to Joel Robuchon because the price points are similar, although I realize Joel is meant to be more classic French and this food is meant to be more modern. 

Atmosphere: Beautiful! I do think Mix (which is quite similar from a design and view standpoint) is a bit prettier and has better views, but I do think this place was infinitely better than say Joel Robuchon from a design aesthetic. The music they played was very strange and space-age sounding, but I suppose that fits given the type of restaurant. 

Food: 

*Amuse Bouche - After being treated to a beautiful platter of canapes at Alex (so good my husband and I debated about asking for seconds!), and an amazing caviar & crab dish at Joel Robuchon, the amuse bouche here was pretty bad. It ranged from boring to interesting, but nothing tasted all that great. There were some boring bread sticks in olive oil (huh?). a mascarpone cheese ice cream with wasabi and sake (not good), a whiskey and guiness jello shot (huh??). and some boring cheese sandwich thing. Nothing I wanted seconds of!!

*Bread - ok Joel Robuchon spoils you on bread for life I tell you. After being treated to a wheeled cart with 25+ choices there, the sad little plate of 3 breads (french, multigrain, and molasses with raisins) just wasn't cutting it. I can say the bread was served VERY hot and tasted pretty good. 

*Fig/Foie Gras - They unfortunately didn't have any seared or warm foie gras available whatsoever (odd to me in winter! and in a FRENCH RESTAURANT), but whatever. Sadly they have removed the ""foie gras 4 ways"" and replaced it with this. This was just basic cold foie gras terrine. Not all that tasty or special or interesting. I've had many better foie gras terrines in my life. 

*""Las Vegas"" - This to me showcases how weird and random his cuisine truly is! It had 4 components -
* tuna over pears -just creative enough to be special, impeccable tuna
*lamb shoulder - braised and DELISH. One of the more special items we ate last night. Sad it was a tiny portion. 
*guacamole with cactus - yup as boring and weird as it sounds
*Martini glass with sorbet and popcorn - I'm all for fun food, but this was just SILLY. I'm sorry you can't just throw popcorn in a martini glass with boring sorbet and call it gourmet. Nope. 

*Nebraska ribeye 2 ways - this was a pleasant surprise! It was HUGE (there was 12 ounces or so of center cut meat) and the meat was incredible. It was served with cut up burnt gross meat swimming in oil with green beans (HUH? so this is your ""2 ways""??) and some pumpkin thing if memory serves. The sides didn't matter as the main ribeye was very large and very tasty. They could skip the nasty oily grizzle meat on the side if they are trying to seem gourmet. 

*""DEER"" - a little odd to call it deer (it's always been venison in TX!), but mb they call it that because it's unlike venison in any way. It wasn't gamey and it was VERY tender. It was like a ""deer"" filet mignon. It was served with some terrible brussel sprouts and chewy gnocchi. Again, stop serving crappy sides already! At least the meat was really good, so I could look past it. Best ""deer"" I've ever had (and growing up in TX we ate deer quite a bit!!). 

*Dessert - Pierre Gagnier 5 ways (or something like that!) - I'll skip the boring details but this was actually fun, and enjoyable. There were playful desserts and to me dessert is a time to be silly. chocolate, caramel, apple, pistachio, etc, etc lots of flavors and all delicious! 

Wine: Pleasantly surprised with their domestic offerings. Some of my favorite Napa estate cabs were available and pricing wasn't really that bad. The wine service was very good as well. 

Service: The waiters were French and in my opinion could have been a tad friendlier. Because this place is expensive I'm disappointed that the service wasn't better. We spent a LOT on food and wine and I don't feel like we were treated as such. I asked for another multigrain roll and was promised another one... it NEVER CAME. I specifically ordered the ""pre-theater menu"" ($10 less than the regular menu), but I was charged full price. My husband went without water for 30 minutes. Nit picky stuff, but service should have been flawless! 

Overall impressions: I'm glad to have dined here, but I can't say we will likely come back. The food ranged from boring to weird to delicious, but never had that ""this is the best bite of my life"" quality to it. The meats were impeccable and the desserts were fun -those were the highlights for me. Service could be better, but the restaurant is beautiful. I would recommend trying Joel Robuchon first if you're looking for a fancy French dinner.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,5,4,3,QpC5f3VQTGLxiXEG2VT-jQ
5249976,2015-01-21,7,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"This place is a major disappointment and this review is long overdue. I made reservations to this place based on the chef Pierre Gagnaire's marvelous reviews. The disappointing factor was a bunch of amigos back there cooking. It was a Saturday night in June and there was only a total of 6 tables in an enormous beautiful place. The food was bad.... 

2 glasses of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc $52 (ripoff)
1 bottle of Bien Nacido 2007 Pinot Noir (good)
Pierre's salad appetizer $24 ( it was so so)
Trio of Foie Gras $38 ( weird looking and didn't finish it) :(
USDA Ribeye $60 ( the most disappointing part of the entree! The steak was rubbery and it tasted like it was cooked with Soy sauce!)
Pont Nuef $8 ( forgot what it was)
Mushroom side $8 ( salty)

Bill came out to $362 not including tip. Besides the epic view of the strip, this place was just horrible! Should have gone to Guy Savoy....",7_pQ7whscPsMhReOYRYytw,1,1,1,i9YRvsVqIS_A1_3zUra-sg

5279762,2016-02-10,6,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Items Selected:

Reloading the kitchen in the wake of Ryuki Kawasaki's departure for Thailand in early 2015 it was again to a former Sketch Chef that Pierre Gagnaire turned in Autumn, and sitting with three friends for dinner at Twist in The Mandarin Oriental for the first time since the turnover one could not help but wonder whether the giant of modern gastronomy had perhaps gone to the well once too often, the room and pastries from Chef Vivian Chang - formerly of Yardbird -  ascending to levels befitting the rarefied air above The Strip while Frederic Don's plates oftentimes seemed as out of place as the restaurant's more 'casual' style of service. 

As yet the least heralded of the French Masters calling Las Vegas home, Gagnaire's high-risk/high-reward style and location in a hotel not offering comps to high-rollers like MGM or Caesars' potentially dissuading all but those in-the-know, Twist 2016 sees many familiar faces floating about a dining room dressed in glowing baubles with pop-music admixing with French tunes overhead, and starting at the podium guests are offered a warm welcome followed by escort to the table, captains quick to offer cocktails plus the wine list while thrice pushing up-charged bottles of water as though poison were present in Lake Mead

Admittedly known to the house, this my sixth visit as others possessed familial or industry ties far more notable, it was after greetings from several staff members that menus were offered and opting to go a la carte, with some ordering as little s one entree, it was almost immediate that warning flares were fired, the potentially low tab seeing runners and back servers largely take over with subsequent tongue-in-cheek platitudes dominating ""all-time-favorite"" presentations of items only last week added to the menu.

Still focusing on his signature multiple-plate style, canapes presented as a series of seven nibbles from which the brisk gelee and sweet green wafer were most memorable, bread service was surprisingly quick to follow and with the room at only perhaps 25% capacity for the 7 o'clock seating it was over two plates gilded with Echire butter that conversation flowed freely, the Cherry Walnut Roll easily one of the best complimentary table breads in the city.

Opting to focus on the seasonal Black Truffle menu for both appetizer and entree it was with a small slice of Foie Gras featuring a good sear that the proper meal began and with elevated expectations based on a similar soup in 2015 it was unfortunate that the version suggested online had been replaced by one featuring bitter celeriac and turmeric plus a warm salad, the sparse shavings of black truffle added in the kitchen offering little-to-no depth to an already rich and earthy composition.

Generous in a way, but at the same time clearly not doing due diligence to the ticket when sending out a complimentary course, a 2 x 2 offering from the tasting menu was presented before entrees and although half were offered the ""Twist Poached Eggs"" with vibrant greet Sabayon plus thinly cut Spanish Ham the others were presented a dish described as ""Sea Bass and Scallop,"" the flavor and texture identical to my entree minus the cabbage and thus not really a 'bonus' at all.

Presenting a spicy citrus sorbet to cleanse palates between similar savories, the complex flavors a good sign of things to come, it was in small bites that I slowly enjoyed a smoky fish souffle that unfortunately once again saw truffles muted amidst background ingredients before the meal transitioned to works from the pastry kitchen, all five menu items sent out at once, quickly flooding the table with plates.

No doubt likely to benefit from a new mindset when it it comes to sweets, the program previously a bit tired outside of the brilliant White Truffle Souffle offered under Kawasaki's toque, suffice it to say that Chang's skill set has already begun to flourish under the tutelage of Gagnaire and his love for exotic ingredients, conformity challenged at every turn with classics such as the low-souffle punched up by coffee and  Amaretto plus a Martini glass sidecar of lemon, pistachio, and chocolate plus the elegant Tarte Tatin with Vanilla Ice Cream and boozy caramel, a cup of Orange Marmalade, Dragon Fruit and Orange Blossom Ice Cream unexpectedly complimenting flavors bite-for-bite.

***A touch perplexed by Gagnaire's choice in Don, the previous Eastern influence of Kawasaki a better fit to the Chef's recent inklings and likely to play better to Mandarin Oriental guests, perhaps it will take time for the savory half of the kitchen to reach previous best-in-the-city standards, the better bet for now being to take in the view while nibbling on bread and cheese followed by dessert.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,3,2MNTQAmZ_NiSkSrrig4oNw
5294768,2016-11-17,0,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I made a reservation literally months in advance and was beyond excited to come here. I haven't been to Vegas in a while, so the Mandarin Oriental was a new experience as well. 

You'll be first blown away by how beautiful this place this. The views of the Strip from the 23rd floor. The plush seating and large tables (you definitely need it). The modern Asian inspired decor. Even the bathroom was so ridiculously nice, I took a picture of it... Ha.

Then you will be blown away by the prices. I struggled to find a bottle of wine that seemed good but isn't at least $200 or more. Finally found a CdP for $150, phew... Still much more than I normally shell out at dinner, but hey it's Vegas. A 3 course a la carte meal will run about $140, 5 course tasting menu $160. But the winner is the ""Lucky Number 7"", 7 courses with wine pairing at a whopping $777... Maybe had we won anything at the tables...

The service was top notch, friendly, helpful, non-intrusive. Presentation of all the dishes was a well concerted dance. The only hiccup was a cocktail that they forgot about.

Amouse bouche - Felt more like first course of dinner, there were literally so much food laid out on the table from mojito jelly to miniature crackers etc.

Foie gras two ways - I got both a seared foie and a terrine. The terrine came with chocolate, fig paste and beetroot syrup, it was a great combination of salty, sweet and tart. The seared foie had similar but richer flavors and served with red marmalade. I loved the texture of the foie, but only complaint being that it felt way too oily. Also came with a slider that was not exciting...

Muscovy duck - The duck was perfectly rendered and tasted great. It was a huge portion of meat to begin with, and came with carrots, more veggies on the side and slow roasted duck spring rolls.

The dessert grand finale my friend got as part of her tasting menu was a tasting menu of 5 desserts on its own. Along with a couple more we ordered was more than enough to feed the entire table. All of them were exquisitely presented and made in very classic French styles.

Overall between the atmosphere, service and food, everything was absolutely fantastic minus only a couple of hiccups, with high prices to go along with it. The main reason I'm actually deducting a star is that I think they actually tried to do too much with the food and even served simply too much of it. All the little side dishes with every single course not only made the tables but also our palates a bit too crowded, it was almost distracting. My foie gras appetizer was easily portioned for 2, I was so stuffed I could barely eat half of the duck, which was quite a shame because it was so good. Either simplify, or (and I never ever say this) reduce the portion sizes...",0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q,3,0,4,9TZw4V4-e_PRBRj20NTKeQ
5308580,2011-01-19,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I hate to write a negative review of a place so critically acclaimed, but Twist was a colossal FAIL for us.  We went there based on the extremely high recommendation posted on uhockey's blog.  The hotel itself is very cool.  It's dark and the bar had spectacular floor to ceiling windows on each side.  The restaurant was completely empty on a Tuesday night which was a bad sign.  We opted for the ""Spirit"" tasting menu with wine pairings.  Only 2 of the courses were really good (the scallop with pumpkin soup and the venision).  The remainder were either not memorable or literally downright inedible.  Things tending to be on the extreme cold or bitter side (or both).  The ""Iichiko"" course was downright disgusting.  When we all complained to the waiters about it they laughed at us (as if the joke was on us).  

Even if you don't believe the negative reviews and want to try Twist anyway, be away that this place is uber-expensive.  2 tasting menus with wines (and not even the fancy wines) is about $750!  This was over double what it cost us to eat at far better and fancy restaurants in Vegas.  Overall, Twist is extremely overrated and disappointing.",9VDrCkfj0I_MDSDPgsPKFA,4,2,1,mjCN42BiN9-iMNKDbikFHA
5331770,2009-12-16,8,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I asked Chef Gagnaire if it was a serious challenge to find inspiration in Las Vegas...after all, most of the products, chefs, and clients are from some other far flung destination.  And for a chef who seems to be defined by inspiration, improvisation and art (he's got a serious love for both jazz and modern art...and his recipes read more like Point than Keller), his answer surprised me.

'No, zat is not really a probblemm for us, what I find challenging is to find zee line with the clients here in Las Vegas. What and how do zhay want to eeet?'

This took me by surprise, as he's someone who's been cooking ""famously"" for over 40 years. He's already been through all of the ups and downs, fallen in and out of love with the Bibendum...and has garnered a reputation as an artist who doesn't suffer fools.  He's a chef that really doesn't have to answer to anyone. However, that he focuses so seriously on what the diner wants is a true peek into his character.

To that end, he's promised that the menu is something that they will be evolving over the weeks and months to come.  In its first form, he offers both a tasting menu as well as a choose-what-you-like a la carte menu for the restaurant...which is also the sole US outpost of Gagnaire's cuisine.

Highlights of the tasting menu included a lovely opening salvo of six canap√©s.  The textures and presentations spanned the spectrum, from Guiness and Jack Daniels gelles, to sardine potato chips.  After these bites, the first course of seared scallops went on to prove two things: 1) seared scallops are far from pass√© in the right hands, 2) those same hands have a thing for blending together complex and sometimes risky flavors into a delicious whole.  Langoustine Five Ways is an example of Chef Gagnaire's constant evolution.  The presentation maintains a backbone of preparations not unlike Japanese Kaiseki (Seared, Grilled, Mousseline, Gelee, Tartar), but the components of each preparation change considerably.  More, his presentation succeeds where so many ""duos"" and ""trios"" fail, as the lesser dishes strive for complexity for complexity's sake.  Here however, the form has function, as the chef manages to tease out what seems like every flavor and texture available in a Langoustine.  There's the delicate flavor of the grilled preparation and the powerful ""head"" flavor from the gelee.   Even the progression itself is well thought out and while the individual dishes may pull you in five different directions, you end up arriving exactly where the chef wants you. Granted, there were some aspects to the meal that needed refinement (wine list and inventory need to be synced up, a sauce ice cream that couldn't make it to the table without melting), but if everything was already ""perfect"" then isn't it all too easy?

Unlike most ""famous"" chefs in Las Vegas (JR, TK and a very few others excluded) Twist is more than a brand extension, but a chance to see a man for his art.  Like it or not, he's not taking the task lightly...more than just ""consulting,"" Chef Gagnaire has brought his A-team with him to Las Vegas.  Pascal, the CdC, has been with Gagnaire for 8 years, the Pastry chef, for 6 years, and Chef Gagnaire has even brought on Chef Michel, who has been cooking with Gagnaire for 26 years and is Un des Meilleurs Ouvriers de France...(translation: he's a super super official gangsta).  And while this team is not likely to last more than a month or two in its current form,  I'm sure it will have a lasting impact on the restaurant itself.  So, if you can get out to Las Vegas and the Mandarin Oriental, why not come and see just how carefully Chef Gagnaire walks the line?",wktMii8vZ0P4iHaOCDjZTw,16,12,5,0ZQifFcEoYSyg6oQfMk_Kg
5384347,2010-05-24,4,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"I just realized I am about to turn the odometer over to 200 reviews!  I feel that Twist is an appropriate selection for this milestone because it was one of the most unique, memorable and enjoyable dining experiences of my life.

I arrived early to enjoy a drink at the bar and ease into my evening.  The moment I walked in I knew this was a special place.  The staff greeted me warmly, as if I was a regular customer and offered me a seat immediately.  I decided to stick to the plan and sit at the bar for a drink first.  As I chatted with the very friendly bartender, I sipped a glass of Louis Roederer Brut and soaked in the beauty of this modern, intimate space.

I was soon escorted to my windowside table.  There is something quite humorous about sitting in such an elegant, sophisticated place and looking out over the sea of neon and confusion that is Vegas.  I barely needed to look at the menu because I knew I wanted to try the tasting menu,  also called Pierre Gagnaire's Spirit. Being a completely politically incorrect glutton I added the Foie Gras Degustation.  More on that later.

At most restaurants, bread is an afterthought.  Not true at Twist.  A server brought out three excellent selections.   A Wheat, Raisin and Walnut, a Country Rye, and a French Ciabatta.  They came with two butters. An unsalted butter from Normandy and one blended with seaweed.  This bread service is second only to the amazing Bread Cart at Restaurant Savoy.

My actual meal started with an ""amuse"" that consisted of six little bites.  My two favorites were the Salad of Cuttlefish, Haricot Vert, Red Bell Pepper and Celeriac and the Tuna Chantilly with Homemade Rice Crackers.

1st Course
SHELLFISH & RED BEET
Red Beet Carpaccio, Campari, Shellfish Salad ""Baltard Market"" Soja glazed smoked Eel.

From my first bite I knew I was in for an interesting, confusing, thought provoking evening. The following statement can be applied to all of the courses I had at Twist: I've never experienced this flavor combination before. 

2nd Course
SEA AND EARTH
Santa-Barbara Prawns, Spicy Grapefruit Syrup, Ginger-Potato Salad, Poached Duck Foie Gras, Iberico Ham, Scallop Mousseline, Baby Greens, Eggplant Tuille, Black & Blue Carrot Gel√©e, Squid Ink Gnocchetti, Seaweed. 

This course, as with most, was actually several small bites presented at once. Each one was fantastic in its own right and also worked together with the others.  

3rd Course
BLACK COD
Grilled Fillet, Poached in Citrus Butter, Molasses-White Balsamic Glaze, Mache, Manch√©go Cheese, Asparagus Ice Cream, Green Apple, Paris Mushroom.

One of my favorite courses of the evening. I placed the ""ice cream"" over the Cod and it turned into a sauce as it melted.  My waiter said he was glad to see me playing with my food.

4th Course
SONOMA VALLEY FOIE GRAS D√âGUSTATION
Terrine, Dried Figs, Toasted Ginger Bread
Custard, Green Lentils, Grilled Zucchini
Seared, Sweet and Sour Duck Glaze, Fruit Marmalade
Croquette, Trevicchio Coulis, Red Onions

This is the singlemost decadent, over the top course I have ever experienced. Each of the small dishes were wonderful.  I found my self rotating between each one, enjoying the different textures and tastes.  My favorites were the Custard and the Seared.

5th Course
HIBISCUS
Hibiscus Gel√©e, Mascarpone Cream, Malabar Pepper Braised Turnip, Ros√© Champagne-Lime Granit√©.

After the rich Foie course I was happy to see this light palate cleansing course.  Which, like everything else, was unique and different. 

6th Course
GRILLED PRIME SIRLOIN
Stewed Celery-Rhubarb, Pinot Noir Jus, Preserved Shallot. Broccoli Salad, Egg ""Mimosa"", Red Cabbage Gel√©e, Bolognaise, Grilled Zucchini, Beef Carpaccio, Black Olive Tapenade.

A perfect piece of beef surrounded by unique and different sides. Have I said that before?

Dessert
Quince Gel√©e, Bavaroise, Chartreuse Parfait
Nelson Sabl√©, Meringue, Citrus Sorbet
Cacha√ßa Granit√©, Cucumber Marmelade, Green Apple
Fruit Biscuit, Seasonal Coulis
Ganache, Ginger, Chocolate Ice Cream

I expected the meal to come to an amazing end and I was not disappointed.  My favorites were the Fruit Biscuit and the Granite. I finished my evening with a gift from the Chef, a plate of Meringues and Cookies.

My experience at Twist was one I will never forget.  I still find myself thinking about it months later.  Twist is a must try for any adventurous food lover.  Hopefully, it won't be a once in a lifetime thing.",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,11,8,5,HaXsJwRVI3GUjp1hNW-Gng

No, it was not cheap. But everything was delicious and it was unlike any other dining experience I've had before. The whole meal took about three hours, but you're constantly receiving wonderful food...or checking out the spectacular views...or drinking delicious cocktails.

I wish, wish, wish there was a full menu posted online so I could really convey all the different flavors and combinations going on here. Turns out you'll just get the highlights.

The meal started with a plate of amuse bouche and everyone concluded the little roquefort concoction was the best. I was also a fan of the one with caviar. After amuse bouche comes individual bread baskets with three different options - a French mini-baguette, a cinnamon raisin roll and a multi-grain piece. With French butter. Salted and unsalted. I know it's just bread, but it was SO much more than bread.

We shared a plate of two appetizers, but four plates came. Everything you order here comes with an accompaniment that's designed to complement it. Gah! Here's where the remembering would come in handy. What stood out was the foie gras - I'd never had it, and felt kind of guilty about eating it, but it was really good.

Entrees rolled around and I selected the ribeye. Always with the ribeye! Hands down one of the top three steaks I've ever had. Medium rare and heaven in my mouth. Colleagues had lobster, Berkshire pork chops and the wild boar. I only tasted the pork chop and it melted in my mouth. The other white meat did not disappoint. We had a few sides but the clear winner was the eggplant with balsamic. 

Bring on two desserts for sharing - one a fruity, rose-inspired creation and the other a chocolate souffl√© with salted caramel. Only sampled the souffl√© and would have licked the dish had no one been around.

Last to arrive was another amuse bouche plate, but this time it was desserts. My personal favorite was the mini-waffle cone with a pumpkin-spice-type ice cream.
I've never experienced anything quite like Twist. As the food kept coming and flavors kept changing, I decided I wasn't sure if I'd ever go back (Vegas has too many places to check out) but I can honestly say I'm uber-glad I got to go.",c7_xsZYNs-_G6IceEW2WoA,3,4,5,CNPb2dB6-uWH8yB2wZIPng

They did a great job of handling the requests with style and provided a great and welcoming experience to everyone.

Let's start with the room which is lovely and sophisticated - almost understated, with fantastic views from 23 floors up.  One of the most appealing aspects of the room is that the tables are well spaced, providing enough room to converse freely.  Well done.

Our server was terrific and maintained a friendly, positive energy even when our rather high maintenance diners peppered him with a ton of questions and indecision.  We finally settled on the Grand Tasting menu for everyone, with some substantial modifications for those who don't eat seafood, cream, sea urchin (who doesn't eat uni?), foie gras (who doesn't eat foie?).  At this point you may be asking yourself why I choose to dine with such a culinarily handicapped crowd, but in this life you don't get to choose your friends, you should just be happy you have them and enjoy your time with them.  Luckily the Twist wait and kitchen staff takes the same approach and handled our food neuroses perfectly.

Now, let's talk food, which was fantastic.

Amuse of whiskey gelee (wow, super smokey, weird, and yummy) and goat cheese in puff pastry were a couple of perfect little bites to get the party started.

Sea Urchin Mousseline with Caviar was unctuous, salty, briny, and very unique.  It was served cold with a mound of angel hair pasta.  Simply mix and serve.  

Lobster Fricasse With Kaffir Lime And Enoki was a beautiful dish in both flavor and presentation.  Several slices of tender Lobster, dotted with Enoki and surrounded with the Kaffir Lime sauce which was extraordinary.  Delicate, and incredibly flavorful - a great mixture of French technique and Asian flavor.  Loved it.

Roasted Foie Gras may have been genius.  Who comes up with covering Foie with Chestnut Coffee veloute?  It turns out coffee and Foie is an awesome combination and the creaminess of the veloute enhances the richness of the foie.  Once again loved it - these last two dishes are home runs and the best I've had in Las Vegas.

Peppered Wagyu Beef was very good.  Extremely tender and perfectly cooked.  The Piquillos and Turnips were a very nice counter point to the beef.  

Grand Dessert was also really wonderful.  Four perfectly sized desserts which had a wonderful progression from light to heavy chocolate.

We did the Grand Wine Pairing which was also fantastic.  Once again, who pairs cream sherry with Foie?  Someone who is way smarter than me.  It was inspired and all selections really delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the two separate dessert wines to go with the four desserts.  A very thoughtful touch.

After all that yumminess though I must really compliment Twist on their fantastic service.  Our entire service team never missed a beat and maintained a great balance between removed professionalism and good humor and positive energy.  This is not a stuffy restaurant at all.  Particular compliments to the Sommelier who did a great job bantering with us while informing on the wine and making sure we enjoyed it all.  

Twist is a creative, lovely, warm, and delicious restaurant.  Looking forward to another visit.",J8mFTJfBBBaShBX1WV30hA,9,4,5,t0iQkCGdS-6w85UIGqx3JA

I highly recommend the Lamb Entree - cooked Fish is flimsy =p

5529629,2017-04-10,67,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"To have Pierre Gagnaire's only US location just minutes away from home is a gift and the current seasonal ""Grand Tasting"" menu only solidified that sentiment dish by dish, bite after bite.  Our group opted for the 6 course dinner with wine pairing, because if you're gonna do it, do it right.  

The ""Frog Legs with Morel Mushrooms with Veal Mousseline and Watercress Foam"" was outfuckingstanding.  Perhaps the meatiest pair of amphibian legs I've ever eaten; these fried ""drumettes"" from heaven twirled through the watercress foam provided an unbelievable bite I could have enjoyed 100 times over. The flesh was very much like the love child of a chicken thigh and lobster.   

Life got even better with the ""Roasted Canadian Buffalo Tenderloin infused with Juniper berries, mixed vegetables, bone marrow, pea pur√©e and violin sauce"".  I am uncertain on the merits of ""violin sauce"", but sign me the hell up for more if that's what made it so enchanting!  Such a savory piece of red meat that was perfectly cooked and beautifully plated.  The greens were straight out of Alice in Wonderland with the micro roots and rich, pronounced pea pur√©e.  Making the moment even more magnifique was the ""Pomme Fondante"" side dish that I'd describe as dry potato gratin cooked with a lot of Normandy butter.

Service was impeccable throughout with our head server, Sunday, and his staff doing a splendid job.  He was charming, full of knowledge and if he wasn't married with two kids, I'd fix him up with some single friends.     

Admittedly pretty buzzed at this stage of the meal, we concluded with not one, but five freakin desserts per person, which felt like a trip to Spoiled Kid City.  A couple of memorable sweets included the beautifully made ""Pinot Grigio Cake"", finally granting me the opportunity to eat alcohol, and the wonderful roasted apple dessert with ice cream.

With excellent company (David V and Suki K) in tow, I was surprised dinner clocked in at around 3 hours.  The flow of the evening and variety of taste was five stars all the way and something I'd definitely be down with doing again and again.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,94,83,5,BJioVCZe-UiAQ7-NN8iaKg

---

Went to Vegas for birthday weekend during Labor Day. On a whim (and a quick Yelp search) we decided to try out this restaurant, partly due to reviews, partly due to curiosity about the hotel.

Reservations were relatively easy day-of via OpenTable.

The lobby to the Mandarin Oriental was a little confusing at first --¬†no real lobby to speak of, only a pair of elevators to 3-4 floors. Once we figured out where to go (23rd floor), things got a lot simpler.

Maitre'd and serving staff were on-point. Remembered my name throughout for various parts of the evening. It's a nice touch.

We did their 6-course Grand Tasting Menu with wine flight pairing. To be honest, it was too much good food, which is weird to say about French cuisine! I don't remember the exact details of what we ate, but I do remember that everything was delicious, fresh-tasting, and paired well with the wines (good job, sommelier). If your palate leans towards foods with a less-fatty flavor profile, I think you'll enjoy eating here.

Overall my dining experience here was excellent and worth the money, all things considered. As a contrast, we also ate at Jo√´l Robuchon another night: it was also really good, don't get me wrong, but comparing the cost vs. the overall enjoyment, Twist wins IMHO. Robuchon was more like traditional French cuisine, which was more fatty/savory; I personally like fatty/savory, but there's just something else about Twist that really elevates it, in my mind.

Go here, enjoy, get bang for your buck.",eGOEvdFU5cJ8bkpe1KrPgw,3,1,5,S5aljuPPjH9nmx9xUaNpWQ

Unusual: the butters and bread, so darn good. Background music playing was not at all what I would have expected, loved it! Bathrooms, NICE!

5675488,2014-05-05,1,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"Twist can best be described as an adventure!  Chef Pierre Gagnaire has designed an ever changing menu that plays with various textures and tastes.

This was my 1st time at the Mandarin Oriental, and found it to be delightful!  The valet was very helpful and directed me to the elevators.  Twist is located on the 23rd floor of the hotel (along with the front desk) and offers breathtaking floor to ceiling windows with views of the Las Vegas Strip.  My Mom and I dined here for an early Mother's Day and were happy to be seated at a 2-top right next to the window.  Our reservations were for 7pm, which allowed us to see the Strip during daylight and as the sun went down and all of the lights came on.  It was wonderful!

We did the 3 course tasting menu and each tried to order something different so that we could try a little bit of everything.  We also had a wine pairing, which nicely complemented our dishes.

I don't recall the names of all of our dishes, but I will do my best:

Canapes - the first ""starter"" was a small plate of various items.  There was a beet jelly cube, which was my favorite (surprisingly), some sort of Japanese Mackarel, a yellow curry macaron looking thing and then this orange paste that was to be eaten with crunchy bread sticks that were provided.  The paste was my least favorite of what we tried.  I don't know what the flavor was, but my taste buds weren't a fan.  Everything else was delicious.  We were also given a small plate that had 2 miniature parmesan biscuits and a lemon cracker type thing.  The parmesan biscuit was amazing and warm.

A nice gentleman came around shortly after with the bread selection.  I LOVE artisan bread and the choices did not disappoint.  I chose the cheddar and bacon roll and a French baguette, while my Mom also had the cheddar and bacon roll, along with a cranberry pecan roll.  I like the presentation of the butter on the table and that they give you a choice of both salted or unsalted butter.

1st Course (Starter):

My Mom had the Zennette Bouillon with crab cake.  She was surprised when it was a green soup with tons of veggies.  It may have been a little bit too earthy for her, but I liked it alot.  The coconut added great flavor to the bouillon.  The crab cake was also very delicious.

I had the Twist Tartines, which were tremendous!  One had gorgonzola and baby tomatoes and the other had chicken.  Both were really good.

For this course our wine pairing was a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, which we both enjoyed (although I am usually more of a red drinker).

2nd Course (Entree):

My Mom had the salmon with purple potatoes.  The fish was perfectly cooked and had great flavor.  Both my Mom and I really enjoyed it - and I am not really a fish eater.  The purple potatoes were something we've never had before and we were both surprised at how tasty they were.  And they made for a very colorful plate!

I had the peppercorn steak (medium rare).  It's tough to screw up a steak, and this one was delicious!  I did think it was a bit unevenly cooked - my 1st couple of bites were more on the rare side, while the center was more of a medium temperature, but overall it was very good.  I wouldn't suggest this dish to someone who does not like spicy foods or has not ever had black peppercorns.  While I enjoyed it, and didn't think it was ""spicy,"" the peppercorns could be considered a bit overpowering.  My meat was served over an English pea puree with bacon lardons.  The bacon lardons were a nice little treat and added a good salty counterpart to the pea puree.

3rd Course (Dessert):

For dessert there were 2 choices, so we each ordered one of them.  

My Mom got the fruit salad with sorbet.  Although she would normally order something chocolate, she really loved this dessert.  There were various berries, sliced bananas, lychee fruit and 2 different sorbets.  There were even crystalized berries that were super sweet.  We both enjoyed this dish.

I had the chocolate dessert (I can't recall the name), which was very rich and yet very sweet.  It had chocolate ganache inside and on the side, as well as caramel ice cream.  I really liked it, as did my Mom.  

At the very end they brought out a plate with a selection of random sweets.  There were tiny macarons, a strange marshmallow thing and a few others.  I wish I could remember all of them!

The service was great - friendly and professional without being stuffy and overbearing.  Our waters were never anywhere near empty and our plates were cleared and silverware replaced without ever asking.  I like that they serve all of the plates at the same time.

We really enjoyed our experience here and I would definitely recommend it to those who are adventurous and looking to try something different.  You would be hard pressed to find anything similar to this in Las Vegas!  The restaurant has a great ambiance and you can't beat the view.  This would be the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or take a special someone on a date.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,4,2,5,4NIIell6ww5NoHbKVNH38Q
5710884,2009-12-29,2,vLkKorA1gPS97Zj0_WKA0Q,"So the wife and I had a chance to try out this restaurant before Christmas and I was very impressed.  

I should first set out my standards, I have eaten at every 2 and 3 star restaurant in the US and most 1 star places.  I have also eaten at maybe 20% of the 3 star restaurants in Europe (there are a lot, comeon).  So if I seem in anyway snobbish, I am, at least about food.

They start out with some Canapes, (5 actually, a recurring number that night) which were hit and miss.  But then, just remember if you get up after them, they were free :).

The menu is either a 5-course tasting menu or a la carte.  As with any extraordinary restaurant, you should take the pre fixe unless you have eaten here several times.  The tasting menu here was $160, so expect around $500 or more for a couple, depending on how much you drink.

I found the fish courses to be well above average, the ""Langoustine 5-Ways"" was very imposing but very good, while the ""John Dorry Fillet"" was soso.  The ""Sea Scallops and Foie Gras"" was good, but the flavors were not a perfect match.

The palate cleansing course of a ""Cucumber, Tomato, and Pineapple"" after the fish was also unexpectedly good, probably the second best item I had all night.  

The best part of the evening was the ""Loin of Venison"".  This was literally the best venison I have ever had, minus the weird sorbet they served with it, but I can ignore this.  The Red Cabbage-Black Currant Jam they served with it was a perfect match and really finished the meat well.

The desert couse was made up of five dishes served in pairs and were good, but nothing to write home about.

So my conclusion is, this is the second best restaurant in the US behind Per Se / French Laundry (which are the same place essentially).

Good job those at the Mandarin Oriental for getting this fine French Chef to finally come to the US and to Chef Pierre, I will be visiting your restaurant often.",iv9hduvxMZgYb8ZQxhRa5w,7,3,5,g340CBBhGgwbwBbTvVSBog

Before I jump into the food, I just have to put out there that the ambience at Twist was incredibly romantic. Try to ask for a window seat if you can because the view from the 23rd floor of Mandarin Oriental was beautiful. The decor of the restaurant was also gorgeous - a mix of purples and silvers. The glass lighting above us was just the perfect touch to the classic but modern restaurant too.

My boyfriend and I started with two of their cocktails, lemongrass mojito and La Passionee, both of which were delicious. I had La Passionee and it had just the right tinge of sour. 

Now, the food. Here are the dishes that particularly stood out during our meal even though everything was delectable:

Spiny lobster: perfect blend of honey, lemon and mascarpone mousseline
Poached foie gras
Dundee-pinky condiment: Comes with the foie gras but what I love about it is the apple ice cream (I don't think I've tasted anything so light and crisp)
