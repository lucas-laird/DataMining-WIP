I really like when they get it right because my mouth is like in heaven, But I feel like my negative experiences out weigh my positive. Also, I understand that they're in a little hut, it gets really stuffy and smokey and they can't keep their door open because town square is the most anal shopping center I've ever worked in and I was in a store, but just wanted to throw it out there that it's not that hard to be friendly when you're being paid for it, stop acting like every single customer is an inconvenience and smile once in a while and maybe your tip jar wouldn't always be empty.

The girl said its a chilli potato cheese is extra.  but the sign says chilli cheese not chilli. She said its chilli cheese is extra. I said fine add cheese then. So I pay 30 cents more for cheese and 30 cents more for sour cream. That's bullshit! Don't put on your menu chilli cheese baked potato and charge extra for cheese. And not only did she not have a cheese button to charge me for it was add chips!!! 

I waited 20 minutes for this baked potato and she didn't even put it in a bag. Instead I had this really hot plastic container to carry back to my work.

The fries themselves are good, but nothing special. I could see the bags of frozen fries from the order window. They fry them up when you order and add the seasoning after.

The buckets looks small, but they filled them above the rim. They gave our fries in a to-go bag when we asked for it and offered us 2 cups of ketchup, which we gladly accepted.

The fries were crisp and hot, but they were frozen fries, not fresh.
The staff was quick and friendly.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,0,1,3,PxqvJS23c9U6Iqe6xQe6QA

The ""store manager"" Jeanne was extremely rude and I witnessed her yell at one of her employees in front of me. I asked a simple question and she threw her ""title"" at me and said she should know everything. I just feel bad for the people that have to work with her. 

Food quality is mediocre. Basic fries and they'll overcharge you for everything. 

Would not recommend. 

And Jeanne, I HIGHLY recommend an attitude adjustment.",b5uG7MVEFBB21UReDEPlMQ,4,0,1,qBLwJlNkcWC5Qzk9306WiQ

My favorite flavor is the BBQ and if you like spicy, get the chili BBQ version. Yums. 

Sign up for their mobile thing (Fivestars program) and get a point for each visit. 10 visits and you get a free order of mega original fries. And since those are the only fries I get, it's perfect for me. Speaking of, my next visit is my free one ;). 

First discovered them at a foodie fest in town and have loved them ever since.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,5,LPpAS-sfwVmzY9NXmDcEgg

So I start to order 2 larges and she tells me that they have a very large order in front of me and it will be 20 minutes. I walked away because i could tell that was a lie, then my boyfriend ordered and she told a similar story but now it was 25 minutes. We waited maybe 10 minutes.  We ate outside and watched them close up with no other orders were given out. That is so shady and i will not be returning.",QbDn1hhlpThpYzb2Qt9quA,0,0,1,YXy3fVgFRVxIGQg_nPG7qA

Anyways, this is always a must stop place for me whenever I go to Vegas. I've tried the flavored tater tots and fries. We usually share a Giga size among my friends that could well feed all of us for a snack. I like all the different flavors but bbq would probably be my favorite. It is made to order so it takes awhile to cook up but it's worth it. Worth every single calorie and price it cost. But you can just walk around the mall to burn that off. :)",pBQrs5cq3do9o_RS-XS4yA,4,2,5,_crPdEtkppLpVmJ8FHzOWw
