188833,2011-09-13,1,IuS8Si2f_CCtNibHTPD7RA,"So I stopped here after my less then stellar visit to church's chicken. I was in and out of the drive thru in literally two minutes. I know some people will say well that means nothing is fresh. Well it was hot and it was fast and it was Wendy's. I'm not looking for gourmet. I ordered 2   5 piece spicy nuggets and a new caesar wrap they have. My total was 3 bucks. The nuggets are spicy and the wrap was basically one of their chicken sandwiches cut in half and wrapped up with some lettuce and dressing. Not bad I suppose, and for 99 cents its better then any other places wrap I think. In fact, Wendy's has a HUGE value menu so if your into quick cheap eats, I'd definitely recommend it because I'm sure you can find something.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,0,0,4,RYLiFsMalruhkvIQl0Yl5g

But in the last few years it has gone to complete crap. They hire a bunch of inexperienced people who would rather talk smack to eachother then listen to what the people are saying in the drive thru. I went through the drive thru on Sept 18 after watching the Wendys nugget commercial with the spicy siracha sauce. While talking to the person in the drive thru we kept hearing the employees on the talking to eachother about where they are going to go for the weekend. all why we are trying to order our food. when we got to the window to pay, the employees still talking we come to find out that half our order was missing. i said ill go inside to fix it. yea that was a joke too. In front of me were 2 other customers that had their order screwed up. The manager that was on duty that night had no problem joining in the employees banter and ignoring the customers in the lobby. One of the ladies removed everything they had wrong with her hamburger and gave it back to the employees. So much for customer satisfaction right. By the time i got up to order the rest of my order that was left off i got an ow sorry $3.77 please. not a hey can we take care of this for you, nothing.... By the time I got home after spending a whopping $29 on food, the hamburgers that we had ordered were soggy and cold. The chicken nuggets that I so wanted were partially frozen. The soda was all carbonation and no flavor. Basically I put $29 of food in the trash. To top things off my oldest son got sick from what he did eat and ended up staying home from school the next day. I emailed Wendys that night and got a response the next morning, Then another manager called me back. She was more worried about offering me free food and getting me to come back and spend money in her store then anything. I said why would i want free food when it made my son sick and ya all cant cook anyway. Partially frozen food is not my idea of fast food. After pleaing with me and failing on retaining me as a customer she said she was emailing her GM who would contact me and send me ""something"" she asked for my address and that was it. She sounded more annoyed then me by the end of the call. This all took place on Sept 20th. Here it is Oct 7th and still nothing from some make believe GM who would send me ""something"". What id like is my $29 back but with this store I dont see if happening. 
If you are hungry trust me there are plenty more places to eat then here. Avoid this shithole at all costs. My 6 year old can cook and be more polite then these people.",GBVyU9RCe_Zo65pXWj0kYA,1,1,1,hmvJzCduMJiRUGt6h5L8Cg

It has been quite awhile since I have been there and I doubt I will be back based on the service I received. The line was long. That was no ones fault. But once we finally pulled up to order, we weren't greeted. Nothing. No welcome to Wendy's ... Just a ""What can I get you. "" Then at the window she announced the total, handed us our drinks, didn't bother to ask if we needed a carrier, or if we wanted anything else and failed to even say Thank you. She closed the window and walked away. Thank you, Katlyn,( I believe that is your name.), for the terrible service. No smile, no graciousness. But you did greet the car behind us, so what the heck is up? We didn't even have a chance to speak and you were blew us off. 
Now, I am home. The food is not up to its previous standards. The bacon is almost burnt, the fries were not cooked properly, and the new Chicken Tenders are gross. Please don't order their S'awesome sauce. The attempt to compete with Cain's is a failure. Also whoever packed our order gave us an order of nuggets we didn't pay for. The dog appreciated them, but someone else is missing their food because the lady at the window didn't check before she handed out the order.",rE4q3lTnVoyR95_Ikgs9Hg,0,0,1,hlOWHefAyX2e3arSN3sAVg

The girl that left her conversation in the back was the drive through person, and had to write the order down and ring it up in the back.  After ringing it up, she cleared it off the screen to keep drive through times low, then had to keep asking for the receipt to make the food.  The burgers were correct, but both cups of chili were only half full.

It's like a previous helper said a lot of the locations are the same and the burgers taste the same as well.  I've been coming to this location for years on end.  Mainly through the drive through late at night.  I've eaten inside a few times and it was clean and the employees were nice and courteous.  It's pretty hard to mess up a salad unless they give you the wrong dressing that you ask you.  

I'll definently go here in the future when I craving the Taste of Wendy's or one of their salads.  I love the fact that they stay open past midnight as well due to the fact that not many restaurants are open that late and serve fast food.",_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,5,5,5,ie2sS-Fev97kSOCAJtQXAA

Isn't there STILL a five minute hold time???? Here's an idea.... How about dont make them until they're ordered! I'm SURE people ( which are paying customers) wouldn't mind waiting a few minutes for FRESH HOT FOOD. To HELL with your 3 minute drive thru time. Quality USED to be Wendy's PRIORITY regardless of location. The customer service is AWESOME, the staff is SUPER friendly, but it seems the ONLY ""Wendy's standard they adhere to is ""White, Red, and Green"" which if you didn't know is the order condiments and vegetables are loaded onto your burgers, and sandwiches.",6FsNGSul-tD5ioHAMN6y4A,0,0,2,ZEqe5_qCKYsPYn4vgfyJKg

I went to get a refill when I was told no refills on that drink. Considering I spent $2.59 for one drink and no refills is just flat out ridiculous.

Originally I wanted to go through the drive-thru, but my husband insisted we eat inside. Once inside I was overtaken by the smell of dog food. I'm not even kidding. Straight up folks. I couldn't think of what else the smell would be. I couldn't bring myself to eat here. I told my husband we were leaving immediately.

4887979,2018-05-12,0,IuS8Si2f_CCtNibHTPD7RA,"So this happened.  Kind of disgusting. 1. Cheese sauce should not have meat chunks.  2. LIQUID Cheese sauce should not look like cheese curds. 3. Make the correct patties, if it's late at night and you are using whatever you have available to make your life easier, you don't understand the concept of customer service. This was a double with one properly sized patty and 2 smaller ones.  4. Consider remodeling your staff and training systems before fixing your store. No point in looking nice and new if your service is consistent with garbage. Whole restaurant looks a mess.  I cannot stress how important it is to invest in a staff that actually gives a crap about what they do, your business with benefit. Lackadaisically doing your job is worth about as much as a lock without the key. Thank you and goodnight.",gRkeRaVoJ4z7ZpFBw2hTCg,0,0,1,v9Oe4eLKIVcmW_quCEICLw
