42250,2014-05-15,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"Was not worth what I paid for. Green curry with tofu $10.99. tofu was fried and soggy, I would have preferred fresh and firm. It consisted of tofu, bamboo shoots, diced carrots, peas, rice and and a very light green curry broth. It would not surprise me if the the peas and carrots were canned, it was a simple dish. I would have given a better review if the curry cost a few dollars less. Not much taste and soggy tofu. The mango and sticky rice is a large portion for $7.99, but It definitely didn't need a rotten mint leaf garnish. The mango was good and there was a lot of it. Good points- it has great ambience, entertainment, and is very clean. It just seems that food quality and fresh ingredients are not a top priority at Krung Siam. $20 before tip for green curry and a mango sticky rice dessert.

So my coworkers and I came down here for our lunch break, walk in, it's a little busy was a nice clean restaurant. While we were standing waiting for someone to seat us, servers just pass us by not saying a word to us. We waited for about 10 minutes and still no one approached us so my coworker goes to the bar and tells them. Then a guy grabs the menus and just starts walking (keep in mind he doesn't even say a damn word to us) so we followed because he must be seating us. 10 minutes pass by and still no one to take our orders (I would of walked right out but we were on lunch and very hungry). So in order for us to order we had to get up and give them our order while not once did they come to get our order or even check up on us. So we asked the person at the bar who is our server and it was a young lady! We were so pissed off because here she goes to the table next to us who just got seated and she already gets their orders, then she looks at us and walks away doesn't even say hi or have you been helped. Anyway, with that being said it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out....our lunch was ruined had to go back to work by the time we got our food. 

The food is good and not bad for $4.99 lunch special and $1.00 Thai tea! 

Very very bad service and I am probably not the only one that experienced it because there were a bunch of angry people that just walked out. For example: there were two guys having lunch and oh my were they mad because apparently they forgot the other guys order and only brought one order out. They just walked out without paying! Hey I don't blame them because I would have done the same thing!",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,1,1,QzdHtq-v0BxvwSMKxOWsog

It's one of the better thai restaurants in Vegas and way better then the one across the street (Kung Fu Thai). They have lunch specials on the weekdays which is about $5.95 for certain entrees and thai tea and thai ice coffee for $1!

The decor and ambiance were promising. Everything was soft, soothing, and clean. Unfortunately, I'm more concerned with the food. I had been here once before, and I ordered a lackluster drunken noodle dish. Giving this place another chance (because I really like Thai), I ordered a lunch special Chicken Panang extra spicy with an appetizer of fresh spring rolls. To drink I ordered Thai Tea.

The Thai Tea came out with a glass of water. The water was clearly tap water. It had an odd aftertaste. One sip and I was done. The Thai Tea was meh.

The spring rolls were interesting. The menu indicated lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, sweet basil, cilantro, carrot and tofu. I received 4 rolls standing on one end. The top end overflowed with ingredients. The mint and basil were delicious. There was actually very little sprouts, and a lot more lettuce than in normal spring rolls. I prefer shrimp; however, I suspect they used Vietnamese pork sausage rather than tofu. Two rolls fell apart while trying to separate them from one another. While the actual spring rolls were lack luster, the peanut sauce included was actually quite good.

The soup included with the lunch special was a vegetable soup. I'm glad I asked, because they actually forgot to serve it to me. The Panang was not well done. Heat level was probably about a 3 (I asked for 15 on a scale of 1-10). The Panang was also very watery.

I was disappointed. I don't think that I'll return to this restaurant again.",ToCtj9x7Ei0m_uLeoMQv3Q,1,1,2,R96YFcuYPd0xI47w7qWsAw

I only liked these two dishes - Basil pork with white rice and the drunken noodles (mild). The rad na and pad thai were a bit bland for me.

The spiciness is prefect. The only thing I really don't agree on is the price. $11 for pad thai with chicken. And $14 for pad thai with shrimp is a bit much for the portion. I ordered the basil chicken, I might be expecting much since I'm thai but still, the basil chicken doesn't really taste that great to me.

We ordered the deep fried Cornish Hen which came on a huge platter. It was seriously a meal for two. If you love cilantro which we do, you must order this dish. We also ordered the Garlic shrimp which was so very good. The garlic bits were so delicious. I've never had garlic prepared like that before and wish I knew how they did it. The Sticky rice with Mango was very good also.

674063,2012-04-28,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"The only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped.

Went for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.

Meanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat

Every so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.

""Is everything okay?
Everything except I haven't received my order.""

Minutes later...

""Is everything okay?
Is there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.""

Her response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time

My plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.

We had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.

We sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.

""What table was yours?
The table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.""

At that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave

She finally came out, and I got the lowdown.

- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)
- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager
- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.",hHhSmytOPwOfbsIPQrbtzg,2,0,1,QIx8Nb2-SNnqWKNbnM20vg

I have also tried, and enjoyed, both their Pad See Ew and Boat Noodle Soup. The soup is particularly good when I'm feeling under the weather.

My problem really comes down to the service. I guess it seems like they don't care. I ordered Pad See Ew with beef once, and it came out with chicken. I told them that it was fine since I'm not one to make a fuss, but like most people, I expect to get what I order. Whenever we come here, I just feel as if our table is getting ignored. I have to look around before anyone comes to check up on us. We usually come late night when it isn't super busy, too. They do have a karaoke stage, which is apparently pretty popular.

When I step through the door, no one greeted me at all. I scoped the place out looking for my friends. after a few rounds of head turning, I saw my friend waving me down into this separate room.

This place looks pretty upscale due to the decor, however, the service is a far cry from being upscale. We constantly had to flag down a waitstaff (Even though the place seemed pretty empty) since they were just standing around doing nothing.

When we asked for something, they looked irritated as to not wanting to be bothered or that they weren't our waiter/waitress. It's just BULL!!! If their waitstaff were attentive, we wouldn't have to flag someone down to get some service. 

So to the food. It was mediocre at best. The yellow and green curry were bleh. It was more like a soup. The pad thai wasn't as flavorful as I had wanted it to be. It was more on the bland side of the spectrum. The only dish that blew my mind was the Jun Pad Poo. The crab meat was fresh and big chunks at that.

This was the really bummer here. When you are done eating, you're setting yourself up for a dessert that you expect that a Thai Restaurant should have. SERIOUSLY! NO MANGO WITH STICKY RICE? wait wait . . . NO FRIED BANANA WITH ICE CREAM? WTFH!!! The server's response was "" We don't have mango with sticky rice. Oh we don't have fried banana with ice cream either. It's not in season right now so we don't have it."" Everyone at our table thought . . . ""ARE YOU F-ing SERIOUS?"" So we decided to go even further and asked ""So what do you have?"" The response was, ""Oh we have just plain ice cream and roti"". To our disappointment, we just asked for the check so we can leave. 

Overall, since they had a cheap lunch special. It was a cheap bargain. I'll be a little on the positive side and give them a 2 star. 1 got the nice decor of the place. 2 for the cheap lunch deal.

My advice is to test this place out during the lunch hour so you don't get charged more for something that you would've gotten for less. Who is to say, right?

I normally wouldn't write a bad a review to hurt a business being that I've worked in restaurants for many years but I was very disappointed with this place. I came last night around midnight with a small group of friends. It took about 10 minutes for someone to see us waiting at the host stand to finally seat us. It was busy but not packed. Once we were seated we all figured out what we wanted to eat and waited atleast 15-20 minutes for someone to see us sitting with no waters and no service so a female came frantically over once she noticed us, took our order and food came out at a decent time. The food was good! That's the only good thing that came out of going here. I asked for napkins and chilli sauce when the food came, but never received it. We had all finished our meals and waited about 20 minutes for someone to come by so we could get our bill. The bill came and I gave him my card right away and didn't come back with my card and the bill to sign so after another 15 minutes or so I walked up to him at the register to see what was taking so long and he was all shuffled and distracted and said that he accidentally used my card for another table and charged me for their food and told me he needs to fix it and shooed me away. So I sat back down and waited another 15 min for him to come back with my card and a ton of receipts and he said sorry and ran away. I was charged for my meal and another's it shows that he voided the other meal but I know from experience that it takes several days to get that money back. I know waiting tables is stressful and hectic at times but he could have explained what happened and been  more helpful or apologetic and not rude about it.",_LtmMPuGp6CrnhS4AbTnyA,0,0,1,XKHEVMNz4khLzQMb3MbaYg

There was live entertainment with a woman singing love songs, and the restaurant had a cute ambiance with dark red walls and fairy lights on the ceiling.  Although it wasn't packed, the restaurant was almost full and it was obvious they do good business.

On visit two, we came around 1pm for lunch.  They have $1 thai iced teas and coffees as part of the deal, which is so cool!

Service was great. Atmosphere is real nice. Lunch was $4.99, plus a buck for an iced tea. While it wasn't the greatest pad thai, but you can't beat the price. I think I'll skip the pad thai next time, but I'll return to try other lunch specials.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,0,0,2,7DTWlEqA6KfSCuS6wudGlQ

Now a place to avoid: Hollywood Thai. Even the owner calls his restaurant a ""dummy"" (I believe he means ""dump"" in broken English). Crappy food, bad location and no service (which the owner ""apologized"" for). Furthermore, if you bring in a groupon the owner admits he will serve you ""30% less food"" than other customers get.

No stranger to thai dishes, I ordered yellow curry with beef, red curry with shrimp, and the basil chicken. 

The yellow curry was sweet and creamy. I'm always a little overwhelmed by yellow curry so I didn't like it, but if you enjoy yellow curry, you'll probably like this.

The red curry was powerful and had lots of bamboo to munch on. I found it very agreeable to my palate.

The basil chicken was pretty bad. I got what appeared to be shredded chicken drenched in some kind of overpowering sweet sauce. I have no idea whether it was chicken, pork, or beef, so that says a lot about the dish. Anyway, it was pretty bad and I find it hard to believe it's the ""most popular entree"" as listed on the menu.

3 stars only because of the live entertainment. Otherwise, the food is really meh and you're paying like $12 per dish.

Interestingly it comes with tofu at no extra charge, I did ask the waiter if I could do without but the language barrier was just that. 


Obviously the first step in eating Pad Thai is getting a spoon full of your peanuts to scatter over the noodles.

So much flavor in my mouth I think to myself  "" Is this what real Pad Thai taste like"" mind you the food just came out piping hot but I couldn't resist .

Like most Thai restaurants, the portions are huge and meant to be family style. Well I mean if you want to embrace 'murica then eat the whole dish by all means. No one is judging. Lol shit I would if I was hungry enough.

THE FOOD:

- Fresh Spring Rolls w/ Peanut Sauce - The sauce was good. I like my food spicy so I put a lot of that red chili sauce in it. The spring rolls were meh. Too much bean spouts so it lacked flavor unless I got some mint or something. I could make better ones at home.

- Chicken Satay - The chicken was juicy and  it was full of flavor. Definitely try it. You can't really go wrong with chicken satay.

- Seafood Rad Na - This is a dish I grew up eating since I was a little chubby fat girl waddling around. This Rad Na definitely did not disappoint and it had more seafood in it than other ones that I have had. It was flavorful, balanced, and oh so yummy! Mix it with some of those pickled jalapeños and you got yourself a winner!

- Basil Fried Rice - This. This made me regret ordering spring rolls. It was soooo good. None of the flavors overpowered one another and they put a lot of basil and bell peppers. We got the medium spice level because some people can't hang but it was still good. There was a little tickle of spice tingling my senses like the Taco Bell Fire hot sauce. So it was like a tease to my taste buds, then the spice was gone. I wish I could eat more right now. But god damn, carb overload.

Overall, food was great and service was on point. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be coming back to try some more food.",8NsXMrc27hNne4HQwFguoQ,1,0,4,ZYMe40EGo7oVRJYG75pFEw

1530982,2011-04-06,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"Well our experience was really all over the place and, honestly, I almost rated it two stars (**After writing the rest I came back and clicked the two star button, but I was originally going to give it a sympathy 3**).  Let's start by saying it was around 11:30 pm and the atmosphere was pretty cool.  It's a nice dining room with a nice feel (and open late!).  It was a Monday night (we had gone in search of Fuku, forgetting it was closed on Mondays), and Karaoke was happening.  So everything started out positively.  Our server was nice enough, but it was very inattentive service.  After a while, we ordered 3 dishes: Tom Yum Goon, Chicken Satay, and Rad Nar with chicken.

We ordered the Tom Yum ""Medium"" when he asked us how spicy.  We actually like spicy food, but weren't in the mood to really test our limits.  The ""medium"" was the spiciest Tom Yum we'd ever had (fine for me though it definitely had my nose running and gulping on my water), but my girlfriend couldn't hang and was disappointed.  Medium should have a good strong kick, and we wouldn't have minded if it was just Hot labeled medium, but this was REALLY hot.  Plus, the water was not getting refilled.  Our waiter disappeared completely during this time; eventually we were done with the soup and completely dry keeping our eyes peeled for him.  He must have been on break, because he eventually showed up with our Chicken Sate, room temperature.  Again, not completely a deal breaker-- It actually tasted pretty good and we are pretty used to Thai delivery/takeout where that's fairly par for the course.  However, one of the best things about actually going out for Thai food is that the Chicken Sate can be served absolutely piping hot.  In this case it was double fail, because not only was it room temperature, we suffered from not getting our water refilled that entire time.  Which brings me to the Rad Nar (flat noodles in gravy).  Again, I don't want to sound like a complainer, but when we order a noodle dish we want noodles.  It was strange, there was a very generous helping of the expensive ingredients beef and Chinese broccoli which I appreciate (for those of you paying attention to what we ordered and what we got, congratulations--again we like beef just fine, but come on, we ordered chicken, and when I mentioned we ordered chicken, the server just smiled and shrugged until my girlfriend said it was OK, we'd take the beef), but it was very skimpy on the noodles.  It made it a hard dish to share as we got like 3 flat noodles each.

So the meal itself was completely botched; that said, it was still pretty decent for late night Thai.  We won't be back if we find someplace better that's open at the hour, but the food itself was pretty decent/good-- even after getting everything completely wrong.  

Oh and the epilogue; when we got the check the Tom Yum was marked 4-Star heat.  So that explained that.  I don't know how medium translated to that, but oh well.",jmM_nn2kK6CnYenMz7wmHw,0,0,2,0Jtxgpg_0N-I5J1Z6D8dvA
1545047,2010-04-22,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"If I would've reviewed this place two year ago, I would've given it at least 4 stars.  I used to love this place because it offered cheap, delicious food near The Strip.  When we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to dine on The Strip, we'd just hop on over here.  Last year, I even had my Wedding Rehearsal Dinner here because the place is fairly nice, the food is good, and it's a great bang for the buck.  Well, now I drop down to just two stars for this reason alone:  They upped the prices at least $5 per item for the exact same food, atmosphere, quality, service, etc.  Nothing about the restaurant has changed, in my eyes, except for the price.  The portions didn't change...nothing.  It irks me that a place thinks they can up their prices drastically just because they're trying to be slightly more high-end.  I think I paid something like $13 for Yellow Chicken Curry.  Something I can get for $8 at any other Thai restaurant of the same caliber elsewhere.  Service wasn't even good to make up for the increased prices.  The place was empty and I felt like we waited a little long to place our order, for the food, and to pay the check.  For this price, we could've just stayed on The Strip and dined in one of the casinos or malls.

HOWEVER, the service was horrible to non-existent.  I am use to getting low service since I look young but mind you, I am 21 years old and my boyfriend is 22 so I really don't understand why we were ignored! Water was never refilled and since I ordered the spicy fried rice, I had to flag down the waiter three times to get my water refilled! The table only had one place setting when we sat down so we flagged down a waiter for a setting but instead just got a fork!!!! All the waiters seemed to go around the other tables to make sure they were doing fine but skipped ours. This was by far the worst service I have ever had.

I got all of that in my meal at Krung Siam. Was it the best curry that I've ever had? Almost. Mix Zone Three Color FTW!

I popped in here for a quick lunch, only because I saw a sign that said $4.99 lunch special. I figured, why not.

I took one star off from this review for two reasons (and these can easily be remedied):

1. I was not offered water until several minutes. It's 113 degrees outside. I was jonesin for a glass.

2. The lunch special includes the soup of the day, and they ran out by 2pm (lunch ends at 3). 

I ordered the Panang Curry with Shrimp (a dollar more than the special price).

The curry was flavorful, and the portions were appropriate for lunch. The menu is pretty diverse, and you have lots of great options. When I come back, I'll explore.

The ambiance is pretty cool. Dark, nicely air-conditioned, and clean. The place seems fairly new. Flat screen TV's and sparkly christmas lights fall from the ceiling.

There is a stage, where they seem to have karaoke and other forms of live entertainment. Decent Happy Hour. Half off drinks from 3-7 M-F.

The menu is a bit limited, at least in my opinion, for a thai restaurant. The pricing and limited menu didnt look like it would play well with conventional asian family style communitive dinner.

The beef salad was by far the best tasting item we ordered during this meal. It was nicely seasoned and grilled to order so it had that fresh off the grill smokey, concentrated, burnt taste. 

Krung Siam platter is...quite...insulting to be honest. 13 hard earned dollars for two of everything: 

Two satays one chicken one beef both lacking the fresh off the grill smokey flavor, seems more like broiled, chicken was overly dry. Sauces were there obviously to cover up this fact.

Spring rolls: more like miniature egg rolls with bland tasteless filling. Another excuse to show off the sauces or serve something deep fried, or both.

Fried Battered Shrimp: tasteless with more deep fried flavor then shrimp flavor. Might as well deep fry presoaked and reshapened cardboard if you have a deep fry fetish be a lot cheaper too

Thai Dumplings: Best thing on the plate but seriously not thai. Not even close unless Dim Sum started in Thailand and the Chinese came, knocked out the Thai, stole their food and the Thai woke up and completely forgot about it.

Crab Ragoons: Again i have a problem with this. Crab implies fresh crab, a little guy with two pinchers, a bunch of claws and sweet sweet meat. Krab is a biproduct of liquefied, reshapened, reseasoned and food colored crap (yes crap not krap). Anyway no surprise here it had a heavily deep fried taste, very little texture from the Krab, lots and lots of cream cheese. Here's an idea why not just bread and deep fry cream cheese?

Okay enough of that lets move on to the main courses:
Panang Curry
Quite nice. Ordered mild and everything was nice, flavorful, and mellow until i started fishing pieces off the bottom. Diced up chilis were waiting for me leaving my mouth burning and attempting to chill the flames with the coconut/peanut sauce from the sampler.

Beef Fried Rice
Yeah we can call epic fail on this one. Your basic very very dry not seasoned very well, wth is wrong with this beef it's colorless and tasteless fried rice.

The last complaint is the insulting price to food ratio. the sampler was 13.99 with only 7.99 worth of food. Both the rice and the curry were a decent size for one person but not filling.

Overall i can only give this place three stars. It's just too much money for too little food. This would be a place to take a date but not a place for serious eating",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,3,2wAQR14-0OYodH8a3EjBzQ

Great lunch special! A co-worker took me here last week for lunch.

- Chicken Pad Thai: OMG!  Probably within my top 2 favorite Pad Thai's ever!  Not spicy at all, but great flavor, yummy chicken and I think fried tofu?  Delicious!

The lunch special says its served with soup, egg roll, fried wonton and salad.  We only got the soup.  The soup had some veggies and tofu in it.  Good flavor.

I'm kinda glad it didn't come with the rest, because I was stuffed after the plate of Pad Thai.  The plate is a generous portion, especially for lunch, but I finished it off like a champ, because it was that good.

We ordered the lunch special pad Thai and Red curry with the normal order of drunken noodles. The waitress never asked how spicy we wanted our food,  which is what I'm usually accustomed to at a Thai restaurant. We also ordered some Thai teas. 

We got our 2 soups which wasn't too bad. Not sure what kind of soup it was. Now onto the entrees. 

-Pad Thai (chicken) : Wasn't much flavor to it at all, just overly sweet. Chicken was ok. 
-Red Curry (chicken): Not spicy at all. Wasn't that good. Didnt even if finish it. 
-Drunken Noodles (beef): Not spicy at all. The description made it sound like it was spicy and sounded like pad kee mao. This wasn't very flavor either. Just oily noodles and some garnishes. 

Now the service. We were in here close to an hour and the server came by once to check up on us and refill our drinks.

2023410,2016-07-29,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"So i went to Krung Siam Thai at a random Wednesday night. We were planing to go to another Thai restaurant but it was already around 10pm, the one we planed to go close at 11pm. So we decided to go this Thai restaurant instead since it opens until 5 in the morning. 

The restaurant has a wall of wine in front of the bar seat, and as i walk in more, there is a stage with a guitar. The atmosphere is good and the only bad thing is it is too dark. The table next to us used their phone's flashlight to see the menu. 

We started with a Tom Yum soup with shrimp. We order 2 level of spicy out of 10, but it was not as spicy as we thought. Some thai restaurant's level two could possibly kill me... The Tom Yum soup comes in a metal pot. It has a bright orange color, the soup is clear and watery. They use cocktail shrimp, which is moist and tender. I like it better than those skinny shrimp that is usually used. The soup is a little spicy and sour with a kind of scent strong of lemongrass.

For appetizer, we had a raw shrimp and papaya salad. The raw slimy shrimp is one of my favorite thai dish. It is like a Thai sashimi but with a little piece of garlic and a green spicy chili sauce which makes it a high note dish. The shrimp is gummy, moist and rubbery. The shrimp itself is bland, but it goes well with the garlic and the sauce. The sauce is a little sour but very spicy. Next one is the papaya salad, the salad is made with green papaya, peanuts, tomatoes and carrots. The salad is very fresh and crunchy with a sweet, sour and spicy lime sauce. However, it is too spicy that i only had one bite of it. 

For entree, we had a basil fried rice with pork. It has a very strong basil smell with a colorful appearance. The rice is soggy, grainy and a little oily. The pork is tender and smooth. 
For a good ending, we ordered a mango sticky rice. Its bottom has a layer of sticky rice and top with a whole mango with some coconut sauce. Is rice is very gummy, soggy and creamy. The mango is not sour at all, which is quite sweet with the sweet coconut sauce. The coconut flavor is just right as it will not cover the taste of mango but goes well with it. 

In conclusion, the food is tasty and the service is wonderful. As the salad is too spicy to eat, i drank a lot of water and they refill the water very quickly. And as we were ready to order, I looked at one of the server and he came immediately to take our order.

2239129,2013-02-25,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"Although there a lot of Thai places around Las Vegas, I am still looking for my one place that I can always count on. Krung Siam is ok, but not sure it is my favorite of all places. The service was ok - it was not a busy night and they somehow managed to not get our order correct, even though the server had repeated what we wanted. 

We ordered the yellow curry with tofu, beef drunken noodles, and the spicy chicken wings. The flavor for all of the dishes were good, although for medium spicy, it felt like it was more mild. Each Thai place is very different as I have been to other places that their mild was more like hot. I wish the restaurants were more consistent. For the price, the portion sizes were decent, but not huge. They also charge for extra rice. 

The one good thing is they do have happy hour drinks/beers - so go before 8p and get your pints/pitchers for a great price!",6QFyYvYgN1XcVfxMMMWxGw,0,0,3,tNdzWNsQ83V-xplivvJ6DQ
2250600,2011-06-30,2,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"This is really a 3.5-star rating; the bump has to go in some direction, and I feel like Krung SIam has 4-star potential. (Also, my husband's review will be three stars, so together it works out. Yelp math!)

We hit Krung last night after doing an ""Open Now"" search on Yelp at 2 a.m.. After eliminating all of the usual casino coffeeshops (with their limited late-night menus) and deciding against a drive to Jean to try the all-night buffet (summer break = Teachers Eating Wild!),Krung it was.

""Wait, didn't this building used to be Satay?"" My husband had been bugging me to go to Satay ever since trying their chicken sticks at the International Food Fair. (Translation: 2007.) Well, look honey, you finally got your wish.

I was rubbing my hands in anticipation because my love affair with Marnee Thai, also in ""Chinatown"" and also open in the very wee hours, was cut short on the second visit when we found the menu, ownership, and seemingly the chef had all changed. Noooo! We were supposed to be the Brangelina of late-night Thai. Shari + Marnee =... Sharnee! A portmanteau for the foodie ages! But now I had a second chance at finding late-night Thai love. (Shari + Krung =... Shrung? Hm.)

Right away I was struck by the pleasant, spacious decor. (Space is a big deal with me. It's an only-child thing.) We were seated in a long, cushy booth by the little stage where bouncy remixes were blasting. A customer soon came over to turn it up even louder. Eeek. The cushions in the booth were shaking like we were playing the Top Gun slot and just got the bonus game. Then a waiter hurried back to turn it down; we gave him an appreciative nod. Then he came back to turn it up again, asking us if it was okay. Awkward. At this point we were the only people sitting by the stage, and the few other patrons across the room didn't appear to be the partying type. We shrugged it off as Krung's ""thing"" and got used to it. If the restaurant had been busier, though, the overall noise may have been too much.

Several reviews of Krung complain about the promptness of the service. Our two servers were polite and swift with refills. Absolutely no problems there.

We ordered large. We're never too proud to get to-go boxes for tomorrow's lunch. Fried tofu, chicken satay sticks, fresh (not fried, although that's available) spring rolls, pad thai with tofu, and basil with chicken. Although I'm disappointed every time I go to a Thai restaurant and they don't have summer rolls like Panna Thai does, the menu was nicely varied and much on par with Archi's in that regard.

Fried Tofu: The best I've had in Las Vegas. Definitely crispy, pieces not so large that the center is gooey, and I really liked the usual sourish sauce with a heavy layer of peanuts on top. 

Chicken Satay Sticks: And these were, according to my husband, the worst in Las Vegas. Ever. Bland. Kind of cold. ""Tasted like they'd been microwaved, and not very well."" The satay sauce was not unlike unsalted peanut butter.

Fresh Spring Rolls: Huge! Imagine a double-fistful of salad wrapped in lettuce, and the salad is deliciously aromatic with a spicy crunch. Fun to try, but hard to eat, and we definitely didn't need four of these giant things. (Came with the same satay sauce in quasi-shot glasses with peanuts on top. We eventually started dipping them in the bowl of sauce that came with the fried tofu instead - much easier to manage.)

Basil: I'll let my husband review that one on his own, but he liked it.

Pad Thai with Tofu: I know, not very adventurous, but I just love pad thai. The tofu seemed to be fried first then cut up, making for some unfried sides, which is not how I prefer it, but it was still good, especially since the tofu pieces were small. 

I asked for the heat to be ""7, maybe 6-7,"" and I feel they nailed that perfectly. That said, on a few occasions I crunched into a tiny pepper-pocket that must've still had seeds, as my tongue nearly blistered right off. I don't seem to get that problem elsewhere.

Overall, the flavours mixed well to suffuse the entire dish, and I can honestly say this is the only pad thai I've had in a long time where I didn't seek out all of the tofu bits to eat first.

As good as the service was, we did have a timing problem after all. Our two main dishes came out within a few minutes of our appetizers, so we had almost no time to linger and enjoy the ""courses."" Instead it was like a tableside buffet. Luckily we'd realized at this point that we'd prefer a quick meal, but if it had been a more normal hour and we'd not been on the tired side, this would've been disappointing.

Overall, Krung is a place I will delight in visiting after-hours, but when the sun is up, it's still going to be Panna Thai, Archi's, and maybe Pin Kaow II for me.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,1,1,4,Xjqgr4Ajot0NzO1M4YcKiw

I used to order the tom yum soup with shrimp, which I always liked with spicy level 6. Not too spicy, not too mild for my taste. This last time, I'm ordering for the table, so I ask for less spicy than normal at 5, it's comes so ridiculously spicy that is not possible to eat it. I think okay, maybe only the mistake is in the soup, but when the food came with spicy levels of 4-6, same thing. MUCH MUCH hotter than my previous experiences (the previous time, maybe the prior week)

As the result, my friends have stomach pain all morning today.  
 
In addition to that, our waitress was very very rude - showing us lots of attitude. They bring one of our plates 15 minutes before the other ones. I handed her my plate, and asked her if she could bring it with the rest of the food, and she literally rolled her eyes and left the plate down. Later on, she pours the soup on a friend, and doesn't even apologize. Unbelievable. 

You might ask, why didn't you ask them to take the spicy food back to the kitchen. Because the waitress was so unaccommodating that we didn't feel like that is an option.

It really sounds I'm making this up or exaggerating, right? This many bad things can't happen all on the same day, you'd say. There might have been something wrong with this dude and his friends. Trust me, it was worse than I explained. I have eaten out most nights last 7-8 years, and this was the very first time I left $0 tip, and that was before hearing of stomach problem of my friends this morning.

When we arrive, we waited for about 15 minutes to be seated which is fine. First, they tried to sit us at a table. When we're standing near the table getting ready to sit, another waiter came over and told the hostess not to sit us there so we had to go back and wait again. 5 minutes later we finally sit down. 

When getting our drinks, the waiter asks if we are ""local"". We found this odd because usually people as if we're visiting or not. What does it mattter if we're local? We tell the waiter we're visiting for the holiday. After getting our drinks, we're told to move again because someone just put in a reservation for 12 and they needed room.

While ordering, we specifically tell the waiter to bring out the appetizers first before the entrees. The table we had was small so we didn't want the clutter. My mother's Rad Nah dish comes out first anyways. We tell them to take it back and bring out the dish when we all get our entrees. The appetizers were papaya salad and thai beef salad. They taste ok but I've had alot better. When the entrees come out, we find that all the meat is not cook thoroughly in most our dishes. In my brother's pad thai, the imitation crab meat was not even cooked. It looked they threw the meat in straight from the package. After asking for the dish to be recooked, the pad thai comes back super sweet like someone dumped some high fructose corn syrup on the dish. The dish in inedible. My mother's dish also has meat that is under cooked. She just eat the noodles trying not to cause a fuss. My dish was ok. Crispy pork that was a little salty but at least edible.

Maybe if we told the waiter we were local, we would have been treated better. Since we're visiting and might not come back for a while, the restaurant acted like they didn't care about us.

Ambiance: 
I dined during the evening, so it was quite dim during this service. The decor seemed nice, as I did see some traditional Thai statues. There are TVs around for your viewing pleasure...however I believe infomercials are for viewing at home. During the entire service, Shaun T's new workout DVD was playing. Can this guy get any more greedy?! 

Service:
Very nice and pleasant. The server I think didn't quite understand what vegan meant or maybe the kitchen just heard ""vegetarian"" and assumed no meat but egg is fine. Though I did request no fish or oyster sauce and no egg, the dish came out with egg. 

Food: 
I ordered the papaya salad with no fish sauce. It was really good. I love spicy, and after reading a review before dining about how spicy spicy is, I went with a level 3 on the salad. That was still spicy for me. I think I'll order a 2 next time. I can't imaging what a 10 is. 
The pad Thai was ok. Sadly this one didn't please. I was hoping to find something wow about it but instead it was a bit sweet and oily. 

Presentation:
The papaya salad is good to share. It was huge and very pretty looking...
The pad Thai...well I don't think you can make it look pretty, but you can make it look tasty! 

Overall:
Loved that I was able to find a new Thai dining option. Would I come here often? Not so much, but if I were in the area, sure. I'll be sure to try other dishes too. I do find pad Thai and papaya salad to be on the safe side. 

As a vegan, be sure to be very specific with your server and check the food before you eat it. I learned that lesson hard after eating in San Diego. Here at Krung Siam, I had to send back the pad Thai because it had egg in it.

2621926,2011-10-10,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"This place is a nice upscale, decently authentic Thai restaurant in Chinatown.  I had the Crab Rangoon, the duck curry, and some Thai Iced tea.   Overall I wasn't overly impressed, but I could see bringing friends or a date to this place.  

The Crab Rangoon was very sweet.  The sauce reminded me of pomegranate jelly. Not bad, but definitely not the best.  Way too sweet in my book.  The Thai tea was alright, but it tasted a little cheap or perhaps with artificial sweeteners.

The duck curry (red curry) was the best part of the meal.  It was actually quite tasty.  This dish had a surprising mixture of green and red peppers, tiny chopped carrots, peas, fresh pineapple chunks, and raisins.  The red curry itself was satisfactory in taste, and had a watery texture that soaked well into the white rice.  It was served with the perfect level of spice (I asked for medium), and it was not too sweet.  Not a bad dish at all.

I didn't have any problems with the service, which I've noticed in a few reviews.  The place was mostly staffed by younger Asians, and they were having a good time while working, so maybe there are nights when the staff get carried away... I dunno.  The atmosphere was very classy though, with jazz music in the background.  I probably won't go back on my own again, but like I said earlier, this would be a nice place to take a date.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,2,1,3,GwV1Nq-N84Nvep6uO65QdQ

The noodles are soaked with delicious flavor, perfectly cooked, with lots of moist chicken, and I especially loved their fried soft tofu. The tofu adds a wonderfully luscious texture. 

My boyfriend and I have eaten a lot of pad thai in Vegas since we've moved here and this one takes the crown. There is nothing better than juicy, moist, and flavorful pad thai noodles. Comfort food for sure. Major plus that they are open way late! 

They are not afraid to use spices here, which is great for spice lovers like ourselves. Their spicy #8 had a great kick to it! (((True to spice))) Even their chili tray had everything you need: thai chilies in fish sauce, Serrano chilies in vinegar, sugar, and dry powdered chilies. The chilies were very spicy and flavorful (not for the faint of heart.)

We've also tried their other dishes and they aren't half bad - I just found minor annoyances with them. 

Panang beef curry - Their version was watery, I prefer my curry thick. But the overall curry was actually flavorful. 3/5

Beef pad see ew - great flavor and very generous on the beef, I just wish they offered more noodles to balance the dish out. 4/5

Big plus that they are open late! The service here was quick at 2am on a Saturday. The ambiance was dark and the live Thai karaoke was entertaining. We've eaten here twice in a week already because that pad thai keeps calling my name.

Food:
- Grilled Squid ($10): BOMB. Must order. It's serve with two sauces, the green cilantro is my FAV (wish I can learn their recipe) and it's a FULL SQUID.

- Tom Yum with Shrimp ($13 bowl): this was delicious. We ordered level 6 spicy and that was pretty spicy. I recommend to order 4-5 to enjoy it (that's btw mild and med). Amazing flavor and comes with 5 shrimp if you choose shrimp. A Bowl only only feed 2-3 ppl. 

- Thai Basil Beef Rice ($12): AMAZING. One thing it's missing is a sunny side up egg. This is probably one of the best basil rice I had. I come from 626 with restaurants such as Noodle World, President Thai, Daisy Mint, Saladang, etc.

A few weeks back, my boyfriend and I went to have a late night dinner and a drink. Upon arrival, we waited for a table to be cleaned so that we could be seated. It wasn't at all that busy but the servers were really slow. Once we were seated, we noticed a table beside us that was still waiting to be cleaned, and probably a few others as well. Make a side note of that. 

Anyway, we picked our drinks and food and awaited a waiter. We finally snagged one and asked if we could order our drinks. They had told us that someone would be able to get to us shortly. Waiting patiently, a waiter finally came by and took our order. We then waited for about a good 10-15 mins for our drinks until we asked the waiter where they were. He said he would check. Drinks finally came and I didn't particularly like them so I gave them both to my boyfriend. As he was drinking it I noticed something floating in the drink. I then grabbed my phone to use as a flashlight to see what was it was. THERE WERE 3-4 BUGS IN THE DRINK. Still kicking and moving around. DISGUSTING. The fact that we had taken a few sips from the drink itself completely appalled me. We returned BOTH the drinks and asked for a manager. The manager, who had actually made and delivered the drinks, had tried to convince us that they were seeds probably. Uhm, seeds don't have legs and there aren't seeds in the drinks that we ordered. 

The manager was very apologetic and paid for one of our meals. Still unforgiving, we wrote a little note on the receipt, didn't tip, and left knowing we would never come back.

It's a little more expensive if you upgrade the protein to shrimp or mixed seafood.

We arrived there and was immediately surprised that they turned the restaurant almost into a night club atmosphere. Dim lights with party lights, a fog machine and a DJ. The bass was really pumping through your bodies... good or bad depending how you're feeling. We were promptly seated and ordered drinks and received them almost immediately, along with our plates and utensils.

The decor of the place was really nice, actually. It was very modern for a Thai place. But besides from that, you might have to wait a long time for your dishes to come out during the late night hours. Luckily I have a patient boyfriend, so we managed to get our food. I saw another couple walk out though because they couldn't wait any longer. I don't blame them.

We waited probably about 30-45 minutes for our food, and our entrees came before our appetizer! We found this odd, but we were hungry so we just ate.
- Beef Satay: This came in the middle of our entrees, but this dish in particular was worth the wait. Beautifully presented, tender with a delicious peanut sauce. My boyfriend took the cucumber to cool his mouth down when he was eating his curry ;)
- Pad Thai: It started out good, with the right amount of meat ratio with tofu thrown in. However, at some point near the end (bottom of the plate) it started to taste spoiled?! I don't know how, but it did and I couldn't finish the rest of it.
- Yellow Curry (Spice Level 10): My boyfriend asked for this, and don't try this if you do not have a high spice tolerant. My boyfriend wanted to be challenged, and he was sweating profusely and his face was all red. He was clinging onto his Thai Iced Tea and water like it was his best friend. But other than that, he thought it was good.
Check was about $30 for the 3 dishes and 2 drinks during Happy hour. Good deal!

Overall: Dishes are kind of hit-and-miss and service is a little bit spotty. If you come during the late night hours, expect a night club atmosphere with long wait times.",GEGsa1Vzv9OKBVLpbVbf_g,0,0,3,peBm43nx_E_jvVOTWn83Dg

We were seated in a nice booth, and were given water and two menus right away.  After a while, we ordered some Satay as an appetizer, panang curry, and jun prad poo.  The jun prad poo was apparently a stir-fried noodle dish, with sweet chili and topped with lump crab meat, and will be the stuff of dreams for me for a while.  It was very, very good.  I've never had anything like it, and I want to go again soon.  The satay was nice, as well, very tender meat, and the curry was the perfect blend of creamy and spicy.  While everything was good, nothing beats the jun prad poo!  

We had Thai Tea and Vietnamese coffee, as well, and while both were fine, they weren't that special.  Our water was refilled constantly, and the there was a very talented lady on the mic with a sultry voice that helped set the atmosphere, as well.

Getting refills is hard, tonight I had an empty ice tea for 15 minutes and was little rude when I said to take it off my bill. Not the first time this has happened.

Curry is just okay, veggies little too big and hard, little watery, and small. Tried all of them here. 

Cucumber salad is good but little spendy now at $5
Coconut was good but $6 each.  

Mentioned yelp for 10% off but didn't apply the discount. Ignored so many things, didn't even speak to us hardly at all, just weird looks and nods. This happens to often here, gets old.

We ordered seafood tom yum soup, crab fried rice, chicken larb, green curry, and shrimp salad. We requested that the tom yum soup, chicken larb, and shrimp salad all be ""mild."" I'm pretty sure that translates roughly to ""slightly spicy."" None of our dishes were spicy in the least bit. We couldn't even find chili flakes or remnants. Our tom yum soup was sweet rather than spicy, the crab fried rice tasted plain and flavorless, and the chicken larb was shockingly sour. We had to ask them to take it back to make it less sour and give it some type of spicy flavoring. Chicken larb (version 2.0) tasted exactly the same. Are they taste-blind or something?! As for the last 2 dishes, the green curry was nothing special and the shrimp salad...well, let's just say we played rock paper scissors, and the loser had to finish the shrimp salad (we didn't want to waste it).

I feel slightly bad for giving their food such a terrible review because the service was great. They were very receptive to our complaints about the chicken larb. Unfortunately, the chef just couldn't deliver. Oh yeah, and they forgot about the chicken larb until we mentioned it. The other dishes had come out and we were almost full until we realized we hadn't received our chicken larb yet. We reminded the waiter, who said it would take just 2 more minutes...15 minutes later, he comes out with it. Proof that they forgot and started cooking it shortly after we reminded them.

A couple of other notes: There's a small stage inside the restaurant, and apparently they have live music every night starting at 8 or 9 pm until 2 am. The inside decor was nice and clean...restroom was a horror show though.",gJK2xAhGQV5zkApt5bQROg,3,0,1,qOmqMo8bx2lkom6WWU3v0A

3176447,2018-04-11,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"I really did not want to write a negative review about this spot, but after so many negative experiences during late hour service, I have to at least admit that there is consistency in one aspect. This place is notoriously terrible for customer service and the food is always inconsistent. The first few times I came here with friends after work, the food was alright. I have tried the papaya salad, the pad thai, the pad ""z-u,"" drunken noodles, chicken wings, tom yum, and the thai bbq chicken. 

Best dish here is hands down the chicken wings because they are the only things that are consistently good. It is insane how that statement can even be said about a thai spot especially since they are just frozen wings that are deep fried with a little sweet thai chili sauce with cilantro. 

The pad thai here is overly sweet and sometimes drenched in sauce. The pad see ew inconsistently comes with flat noodles that are broken up and it almost does not even feel like a noodle dish because there is so much inconsistency with the way the noodles are in this bowl. Same principle goes for the drunken noodles. 

The tom yum soup is ok at best, unless you come at a time where they serve it to you at ""room temperature,"" and it is super sour at other times. I stopped ordering it altogether because it came out super salty the last time and the salt kick was disheartening more so than the times it was at a wrong temperature or when it was sour. There is zero flavor balance. 

Thai bbq was good when I ordered it, but the portion was very small for what I had grown used to at other thai spots around town like PinKaow. 

So, after review of all the food I have had over the dozen times I have been there, I can say the food is a close  2-3 star experience for your money. However, with the service also having consistency in being awful every time I am there, I give that a solid 1/2-1 star experience. 

This spot is open late night, so it limits options for thai for all hours, but honestly, I won't be recommending going back here for anyone. Last night I went with a few of my best friends and service was terrible yet again. I asked for thai bbq chicken and the waiter completely forgot about the order and by the time we were done eating, I had to ask another waiter to make sure to take that off the check because it was an oversight. There was no apology at all on their end and if anything, the guy looked annoyed for their mistake? I thought that was pretty hilarious.  The same waiter refilled my iced tea with water and when I pointed that out, he snapped at me and said, ""I'll get you another one."" Wow for sincerity? You messed up, & couldn't at least apologize? 

Last week when I brought a couple of my friends here after work, the waiter gave us the check after our appetizer order. I asked him why he gave it to us preliminarily, and he had no idea we hadn't received our food! Yay!-for paying attention! We waited over 35 minutes for dinner and this guy handed us the check after chicken wings LOL. Unbelievable.

Myself, & my connections in hospitality won't be coming back to this place ever. Service is gawd-awful and food is not worth the trip. I recommend going to Pin Kaow on eastern near BJ's and Crepe Expectations. There are other good thai spots like Lucky Thai that are mountains better than this rude, salty spot. 

Let me just advise you guys that this location has been closed down in the past and with service etiquette and inconsistent food quality, you will be on that same road for the future. This is not the best way to run a restaurant. This place needs to incorporate some training for the staff to be better and not so terrible to guests. Tips are earned, & it says a lot when all of us food & beverage industry people feel like we've wasted our money on shit service.

Good points include:

I enjoyed the live singer and his older songs from the 60s,70s and 80s were perfect for me.

The place had a decent,modern look.

I ordered a Thai Iced tea which I enjoyed.

The service was good.

The food quality seemed adequate.But I'm not real knowledgeable  about Thai food,so I can't say for sure.


Bad points include:

The place is very dimly lit.It was tough to read the menu,plus there was a transparent plastic sheet on the menu which tended to distort the menu.

The prices are slightly higher than I am comfortable paying.

The portions could have been a bit larger.

The last Thai restaurant I went to was Thai place in Target Shopping Center on Flamingo and Maryland.While it is not a fancy place by any stretch of the imagination  (most people would consider it a ""hole in the wall"") ,the quality
and quantity of the food seemed much better.(I'm talking about a simple
Pad Thai dish in both cases.) The price was lower there,too.

One of the biggest turn offs that both my friend and I experienced was when the
food server brought the check while I was still eating and asked if we could pay it right away.That seemed to us like a combination of being rushed and being distrusted.While we all know that feelings are very subjective and that might not have been the servers intent,that's how we took it.It definitely rubbed us the wrong way.

I might come back here again,but I won't go out of my way.If you feel like eating
here,by all means try it.You'll probably like it.In this review,I was just attempting
to share with you what my experience was like.I've had better and I've had worse.

Walked in and first thing you see is a gorgeous stream of water running down a mirrored wall. At night it's beautiful and adds flair as you walk in. We were immediately greeted and sat. Restaurant wasn't too busy but again it was early dinner. I don't mind when it's slower because my food is faster and always tastes better. 

We ordered our drinks and appetizers off the bat. We got and order of crab rangoons and a platter which consisted of chicken satay, spring rolls, crab Rangoons and pork dumplings. Each having their own sauce to dip in such as sweet and sour and peanut sauce. Best satay I have had in a LONG time. Spring rolls weren't my favorite but everything else was good for an app.

Our server came to take our order. He didn't write it down but spoke it back to us perfectly. Food came out staggered with entrees. I think they thought we were doing family style which we were not. So my meal came about 5 minutes later.

The staff seems to work as a team because I had about 4 different people waiting on us from order taking, to bussing, to drink refills. Team work makes it work better. I didn't sit there waiting for anything because someone was always around.

I obviously ordered Pad Thai. As we all know on here that's like all I get. Their spice meter is all over the place. I can handle spice and the 2 was a lot. For me it tasted great. For some at the table it was TOOOO hot and that was just a 2 out of 10.
Pad Thai was great. Didn't have too many peanuts which I like an abundance of. I actually added pineapple to it and it made it even better. Try it next time you get pad Thai. All meals were large and can be split for two or good for take home left overs.

We all saw fried bananas on the menu so you KNEW that was happening. Came out at a good time. Not overly battered and very warm. The bananas were very tasty. I thought it was a caramel sauce on it but it was honey and I hate honey so I had to eat around it :( we had ours served with mango and coconut ice cream.

Other than that this place is great! Defiantly check it out if you are in China town. I know there is a lot to choose from but you won't regret this place.",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,3,4,5,-7_Ar6txJTuFmq2YOgNbfw

I guess none of us felt like getting ripped off anymore from expensive hotel eateries.  We went to Krung Siam simply by luck.

The decor at Krung Siam was surprisingly nice.  It had a loungy restaurant feel unlike any other Thai place I've ever been too.  There were candles on the tables and the servers were all very friendly.  Best of all, they ad $4 buy one get one free bottles of imported beer.  Wow, that is cheap coming from the Strip where one bottle would run $7-9 bucks!

We ordered the Pad Thai, Chicken Green Curry and Glass Noodle Salad.  We orderd everything medium spicy but the food came out SUPER spicy.

Well damn every office or my body was leaking water, my sinus cleared up and I drunk more water in 45minutes than I had in the last weak. It was oh so worth it and it washes down great with Thai tea. The perfect sweet to spicy combination that can never do you wrong.
They have a huge variety of food choices; I have to come back again to try them all but this place is a must try!

This is a solid Thai spot but hardly the best in Vegas.  Pretty big restaurant with open space makes it a nice venue for a full table and even for live music some nights.  They have a pretty good wine menu and some good menu options, but everything is priced a few dollars higher than the quality.  Dishes are large as the spicy eggplant and beef salad filled up 2 people.  Throw in the appetizer platter and you have lunch for tomorrow.  I ordered a 10 spicy level and it was hot but more of a late burn.  There are definitely hotter options in town.  Fine food but there are better options (some literally right down Spring Mountain) for better Thai.  But still should be on the short list for Vegas Thai food in China Town.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,Cu10HjGlAjgKxafil7qE6A

We had the crab fried rice, panang curry chicken, rad nar with beef and the sweet sticky rice with lychee. The crab rice was very good, not overly greasy, not mind blowing but very nice on the palate. The rad nar was like an Asian version of an American beef stew but not as rich and heavy. It was warming on a cold winter night and the thick flat noodles were a delightful change of pace.  The panang curry chicken was loaded with flavor and I love the fact that they use white meat chicken which was very tender and cooked just right... they serve a bowl of white rice on the side which is great for absorbing all the delicious panang sauce, personally I think they need to make the side of rice a little larger. Finally, for dessert we had the sticky rice with lychee, it was served warm and had a mildly sweet flavor.  The lychee fruit added a nice touch with its combination of sweet and tart... we all agreed that we prefer the sticky rice with mango at Archie's best!
I have been to this location a few times, originally at the recommendation of one of my poker dealer friends from a Strip hotel.

As a restaurant, it just is a mess to me.

One of my best friend's dad is actually a chef here, so definitely no favoritism.. Sorry Alex!

My main reason for the mediocre rating is #1 The prices and #2 I just don't like the place.

I think having a stage is so cheesy for a Thai restaurant. Thai's know how to get down on karaoke and I'm sure everyone's family has a machine at home, but unfortunately the talent they choose at this restaurant for the entertainment is definitely just like at home.

The Thai videos playing are also just cheesy.

And please turn some lights on at night, most the diners are drunk and can't see.

I've been here a couple times. The first time was when my friend was visiting from out of state (he's the chef's son). We got a bit of a discount, and even a free entree, but the price was up there for Thai food. 

It is a nice establishment as far as the decor, and that it isn't a little hole in the wall, but add the mediocre service to the equation and it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe that's the voice of my Thai mom who left it instilled in my head that her food will always be better than any restaurant and cheaper. Krung Siam doesn't prove my mom wrong.

I've had their grilled beef salad, their version of combination pho, and pad se ew, and the yellow chicken curry.

Pho was definitely mediocre, beef salad was really good quality, the side of sticky rice was microwaved too much, pad se ew was good, and the yellow chicken curry had a lot of filler.

Their Thai tea sucks too.

Overall i'm just not convinced there's anything special about this place in any category. The food is decent, the prices are understandable, the service is medicore.

The problem is that it's consistently gone down in service and quality. On my most recent visit, we had a waiter we'd never seen before. He didn't appear to speak English. Our order coming out incorrectly was an indicator that he wasn't understanding Us.

We calmly asked again, and again, and over the course of an hour or so.. we got allot of attitude about sending back items we didn't not order. On top of it, we asked for water 4x, and the server was clearly being vindictive and ignoring us. 

A different female server started coming over to fix things.. and finally we got the 3 of the 4 things we wanted. No water tho..but at least our beer finally arrived. Originally we ordered Asahi, and when they didn't show up after 10 minutes.. I asked the server. He motioned that they didn't have Asahi.. so we got Newcastle. 

Sufficed to say, it's not a good feeling when you regularly spend quality money on garbage service and food.

I highly recommend anyone who would like to eat healthier to substitute their usual meat options for tofu...it's very satisfying and very much tasty!
Oh, and I cannot forget to mention my favorite young coconut drink, which comes in the shell and very fresh, for only $4!!!!
The ambience is modern and hip though very comfortable and all their staff are very nice and friendly. 
Sometimes, there is live entertainment going on, usually with the guitarist who has a great voice, and every now and then, your server might even go up on the stage and start singing!
Lastly, it is just an awesome late night spot for the night owls like myself...and did I mention the food is yummy here?!!",JU2RvZWMAVEE2OqGB-6Lcg,2,0,5,iN8G48xJeNddSUUY60xUcQ

I do like that lunch comes with a small soup and a small salad. Both of those were very fresh and flavorful as well. Service was good, and attentive. Everyone walking by asked how I was doing. Place was't busy, so that probably helps. 

The reason I only gave 3 stars and not 4, was the Christmas music was very loud. It just wasn't a pleasant, relaxing environment. When people go out to eat, atmosphere is always a concern.",vAy8CUAaaKuzLaQdM5vNAg,0,0,3,zOZqD2ZJUV1LrM3g0OIUtg

Its not a great feeling to chow down on your food and then all of a sudden you feel the shell crunching against your teeth...the fried rice also had no flavor. We've had the beef jerky as well and every time it comes out super fatty. Like you can't even chew it. Sad. Last but not least, the only reason I kept ordering from here is because I crave fried bananas and everywhere else makes them hard on the outside (like egg rolls) while I like them to be fluffy. This is the only place I've found that makes them fluffy! The first time they tasted great, second time they tasted like rotten bananas were used, third time they were okay, and the last time not only did the bananas taste super nasty but the bread on the outside (or whatever it is) didn't even cover up the banana all the way.

The food in this place is not in a class with Archi's, and certainly, does not hold a candle up to Lotus of Siam. But for your classic American Thai favorites as a lunch special, this is a really good value. 

The Panang Curry with Chicken is a good lunch portion, but the curry is thin. My wife enjoyed the noodle dishes, and feels the same way about the quality. Not impressive, but acceptable for a lunch, served in a relaxing atmosphere. 

Lunches are fair portions, and served with soup before the main course. 

Service is prompt and friendly. You actually get the same server throughout, and they check back on a regular basis. Very refreshing in a Thai place. 

Best deal......Thai Iced Teas and Coffees are just $1 during lunch. 

Location is good with easy parking.

This visit- at around 3:30am was our final due to the exceptionally shitty service.

We are both greeted and asked if we want either a booth or a table.. Then we are walked to our spot.

The host dude leaves us the menu.. Walks away.
When he comes back we're ready to order so we do.
We ask for the Tom Kha, no spicy no mushrooms with chicken, sticky rice and the drunken noodles no spicy no tomatoes with shrimp.
Water an coke to drink.

There are 3 other groups of people besides us. So we wait...
Our drinks come- then the server takes our order of soup to another table and theirs to us.
We tell her, no thank you--wrong.
Mean while this server is scrambling around trying to take care of all of us while the host kid has tape on all of his fingers dancing, no really.. Dancing around the restaurant trying to do closing work.. An hour and a half before they close. Since I've been here before I know this kids a server, I've had him.

We get our soup... It's warm...............
Asked for the sticky rice, she brings it over.
Then she brings the drunken noodles---- it has damn tomato quarters in it! I asked specifically for no tomatoes.. You're a server, you have 1 job, serve me and get my order correct. This is why you check it when it's in the window still.
However, being as picky as I am.. I pick the tomatoes out.
My girl starts waving at the waitress as she is talking to a co worker who's eating... Then she says heeeeeeey!!! So the waitress walks over and we ask for the check and some boxes to take our meal home..
The waitress takes our plates away and boxes every thing up for us- DOPE! Brings us our boxed food and the check.

Meanwhile host kid is still dancing around with strands of tape on his fingers.. Stop.

When we get home I pull the to go box out of the bag and there's a mfkin HAIR on the outside of the box... That leads inside the box onto my drunken noodles. That's why I'm changing my what was 2 star to a 1 star(right now).

I was skeptical because It was not to busy on sunday night but after for a while I was there, without I realized it they had a full house one of my coworker came here not to long ago and she liked it, that's why she took us here.
They do have a good food, good service and good atmosphere. 
I like they way they have plenty space on their dinning place, it's not to crowded with tables and chairs so it's easy to walk arround. 
They have a place in the middle with a small band, I think they have a live music but I don't know when. When I was there, They put a nice soft music, it's not to loud so we still can talk normal without screaming.
All the server had a good attitude..So nice,their smile, polite, kept refill our water. 

Their spiciness level from 1 (not spicy) - 10 ( spicy). I love spicy food so I ordered spicy #8, even thou I can feel the heat but I add their thai chili vinegar + dry chili + chili sauce. I ordered beef pad see(z) ew ($ 10.99)..Flat noodle stir with soy sauce + scramble eggs + chinese broccoli + beef. 
My co workers had chicken drunken noodle ( $ 10.99), beef pad thai ($10.99), chicken yellow curry ( $ 10.99), fried rice ( $ 10.99) also we shared crispy spring roll (egg roll $ 9.99), Garlic shrimp ( $17.99). For me their fried rice to much black pepper but my coworker like it like that.
Their garlic shrimp had a good flavour but I wish the shells have more crunch so easy to eat, a little bit to hard.
But overall I love my pad z-ew

I came in for a quick lunch with my dad and the sign stated that the week of Christmas and New Years, they didn't have lunch specials, which was the main reason we came. Both of us were freaking starving, so we just decided to stay.

We pretty much got there right when they opened so service was good. They were pretty attentive and kept refilling our drinks. That's a good sign. Now on to the food.

Crab rangoons
This is one of my favorite things to order for an appetizer. I was really disappointed. We were the first ones in the restaurant so I expected them to come out hot and fresh. Nope, these were just warm like they were  made 20 mins before and just sitting. When I opened one, you could see how greasy it was. 

Chicken panang
I enjoyed this dish a lot. Big chunks of chicken and chunks of bell peppers. It was really good, like what panang is supposed to taste like, but the portion was really small for the $10 price. I could have just eaten that myself. 

Beef larb
I'm not a fan of their version. Instead of using chopped pieces of beef, they used ground beef. They use cabbage instead of lettuce like I'm used to at other places. To me this dish reminded me of another Filipino dish called papaitan (spelling?). For anyone who knows who that is, you know that distinct taste I'm talking about. Not really pleasant in Thai food. 

Overall, I had a decent experience here. I'd come here if someone else was paying, but I'll stick to other Thai places around town.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,0,0,3,fCrHT9_HuFUUf4obXK2PKg

4300177,2010-08-31,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"The wife and I were running errands around town, and our path was going to take us through China Town. We had both been craving Thai food, and because we were without a computer, we had to choose a place the old fashioned way, that is, we looked to see which restaurant had the most cars outside of it. Its hard to tell in China Town because it is just strip mall after strip mall, but there seemed to be many cars in front of Krung Siam and people going inside. 
When we got in, we were pleasantly surprised. The decor was very modern, and I felt like we were in an upscale Asian restaurant in Chicago or New York. Additionally, from the looks of the lights and the sound set up on the inside, this place gets hopping after dark. 

We were greeted by a very young looking hostess, and actually all the staff we saw were quite young, which was just not what we are used to in this part of town. On to the food! I got the Pad See Uw with Tofu and the wife got pineapple fried rice. We also both got Thai Iced Tea. The tea was not as sweet as I've had other places, which was very nice. The spices were more prominent, and the flavor was bold, but not overpowering. My dish was amazing. I think its probably the best tofu I've had in a while. It w as fried, but not over fried and the black soy sauce filled the pores of the tofu. It was nice and firm, but not too crunchy. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. I could have eaten them by themselves. The veggies were also cooked well, not too stiff and not soggy. The wife's lunch was also very good. All the veggies and fruit was very fresh, and including raw cashews and unsweetened raisins really completed the meal. It was flavorful but not too sweet and not too salty. 

The price was very reasonable. Less than at our other Thai haunts. We paid about $22 for the 2 entrees and 2 Thai teas. Not bad at all. 

If I could give Krung Siam a 3.5 I would, but I will round up to a 4. I am excited to come back to this place.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,0,0,4,6c_eDUdoHu0bOJs0KsslFw

This place was really appealing to me for some odd reason.  A cool mechanical waterfall when you enter the restaurant, dimly lit, neon everywhere, a stage for live music and waitresses walking around with bunny ears? Definitely a place different from where I normally eat at but I do enjoy the charm. 

Service: Was absolutely great!  The guy we had was very cordial, made sure our glasses were always full (big plus) and was very pleasant.  Towards the end of our meal, the manager took our leftovers and personally placed them into individual boxes (YES!). 

Food: The sauce that accompanies a lot of the dishes I got the spring rolls which were perfectly crunchy and flaky without destroying the contents.  The drunken noodles were a yelp favorite? but really wasn't that great.  It was like a 80:20 ratio of vegetables/meat to noodles and the noodles were more like sheets.  The Thai BBQ chicken gets  flambed which is pretty freaking cool but make sure you move the chicken off the plate and onto your plate or else it'll burn the bottom.  The fried rice and pad thai looked good so i'll definitely will get those next time. 

Music: We had a guy playing a guitar while we were eating which was pretty charming.

Drunken noodles: pick your choice of meat and spice. We got chicken in medium spice. There were plenty of bell peppers, chicken, and tomatoes...but where's the noodles? I was a little disappointed for not having enough noodles. But it was flavorful and had a perfect amount of spice and plenty of leftover meat and veggies after the noodles were gone! 

Thai chicken: when the server brought it out, he poured some liquid over it to make it sizzzzle! Talk about dinner and show! And it came with two dipping sauces, one was a sweet chili sauce and the other had a spicy/fish sauce/lime taste to it. The chicken was juicy and tasty by itself! But the sauces did elevate the flavors and give it that Thai twist! 

Spring rolls: I didn't realize they weren't the fresh kind. It was the fried egg rolls filled with noodles and vegetables.

Now, i'm not thai, but you could really taste the complex flavors and cooking style were not watered down for americanized taste buds.

I ordered the Thai Basil with steamed tofu and the sauce was just to die for! perfect balance of sweet, salty, basil flavor. The eggplant basil dish was also mind blowing. The eggplant was slightly caramelized and meaty. The drunken noodles had soft, succulent noodles. the Pad thai was so different from the overly-peanutted(is that a word?) dishes I've had elsewhere. Lots of great flavor & texture everywhere. 
We also orderd a pot of tom yum soup for the table which was fantastic. However, please be warned, those are not green beans in there! it was a 5 alarm fire in my mouth for a minute when i took a bite into one of those chiles!

The prices are great - $4.99 lunch specials during the week and $8-$15 entrees otherwise. Everything was out of this world delicious. Don't miss this place if you are in Vegas and have a hankering for Thai food! I wish I had a place like this near home.

oh, also, it's in the Chinatown area off the strip so you can also go get foot massages at sketchy places across the street. ;-)",UG8cewYtZdep2hzSekIqYg,3,1,5,RI5sDNfvLtot3bAbRGZysg

Food: 
1. Day One: Tom Yum Noodle Soup
I ordered this dish with flat rice noodles and it definitely hit the spot after a crazy night of drinking. The soup tasted super authentic and was not too tart.  As for the meat and fishballs, there was plenty of that so no need to worry about the portions here! 

2. Day Two: Spicy Basil Fried Rice 
I had a taste of my friend's order the day before and I was hooked instantly. The rice had a strong garlicky taste so this is a great dish for a garlic lover. The beef that came with this dish actually surprisingly tender and not chewy at all.

When we arrived (with a party of 7) for his 24th birthday, we were greeted and seated almost immediately. Earlier in the day I came by to drop off a birthday cake and some decorations and they waitress had them set up when our party arrived.

First thing ordered was Thai Ice Teas for the table. Which were amazing. Not too sweet, and not too strong, just perfect.

For appetizers we order 3 servings of the Thai beef Jerky. Very tender with just the right amount of spice.

My dinner selection was the shaved papaya salad (I ordered a 4 in spiciness) and it was crazy hot, but I washed it down with the tea ( the next time we visited I ordered a 3 and it was perfect).

The waitress brought a round of martinis to the table to commemorate the birthday celebration, and the person doing karaoke at the time joined us in singing happy birthday. It was an awesome night.

Pros:

atmosphere
service
food

cons:
Parking
lighting (it was a little on the dark side)

I ordered an ice tea, only to be told they were OUT OF TEA! We ordered an appetizer and two pad thais, one with shrimp, the other with seafood. The pad thai was delivered before the appetizer, about which we had to remind them. There was no lime with the pad thai. When I asked for a slice, the waiter returned with a slice of lemon. The pad thai tasted off; the seafood was rubbery rings of calamari.  After struggling to get the waiter's attention, we paid the bill without finishing the meal and left.

Let's face it... the only justification for Thai food having such prices is that it's pretty close to the strip; otherwise, it's better to go to other Thai restaurants throughout Vegas that are more reasonable. 

Despite the prices, the food is certainly 4 stars! We ordered several dishes and shared ""family-style"" and were able to try a little bit of everything. Bowl of seafood soup, fried rice, chicken, the popular basil dish, green curry, and pad thai...  I love that you can specify the level of spice for your meal ... levels one through ten. 

I finally went back a 2nd... and 3rd time and had a chance to order my dish 10/10 level the 2nd time and 15/10 level ;) the 3rd time. They did a fantastic job with the level of spice, and when I didn't like my first order *(for the first time in my life I found a dish I do not care for... it's the Thai beef noodle soup... the flavor was not enjoyable for me)*... the waiter was kind enough to replace my order with the Drunken Noodles, one of my all time favorite Thai dishes, which was EXCELLENT.

Landed here with the parentals during another of our foodie ventures. 

Spotlight goes to their $5.99 lunch specials. 

Frankly, I was skeptical about trying this place out at first, especially after hearing mixed reviews. Alright, maybe the servers were not as homey or warm as I would've expected them to be - but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and take it that I do get groggy myself at that time of day (2pm). Nonetheless, they got our orders down like lightning and our food arrived in less than 10 minutes.

Papa had the sweet and sour shrimp, mommy had garlic and pepper chicken and I got the yellow curry beef. I must've been the most satisfied out of the three of us. Curry was extra mild, as requested and the coconut milk brought out a rich overall flavor to the dish. I'd say it was sweet with a touch of spiciness - not eye-watering hot, but enough to keep the spoonfuls coming in.

Mommy liked her chicken. Didn't last too long. Papa wasn't too keen on his order because he said that it tasted like pre-cooked, pre-packaged and refrigerated shrimp tossed into a plate of sweet and sour sauce. To put it simply, I guess he meant that the flavor did not soak in too well. 

Oh and how could I forget? We absolutely loved the soup! (it came with the lunch specials) Would've liked it too if there were side servings of egg roll and fried wonton for every order like the krung siam website said. Salmon was crossed out the menu for some reason (that was going to be my first option) so it's best to not rely on their site to be in the know how about what they currently have. 

We'll be back here again for lunch soon. Enjoyed the peaceful ambiance and papa had a great time keeping score of the NBA playoffs thanks to the tellies lined up along the walls. They each had a different sport playing. At some point, he needed to know a team's score so I sifted through my phone to check it and hola, there was wi-fi! Could've been jacked from the starbucks right beside (very very possible) but still, you get to access it and that's the best part.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,2,2,4,InZWvvl8d5V8NSt7uSPwWQ

I thought perhaps portions would be larger due to the high prices when actually they are only moderate and marginal for family style dining.  We ordered the green curry with tofu, drunken noodles and Tom-kha kai soup dishes.  Price at the end for all three meals and drinks is about $38 (after 10pm is happy hour and it was advertised 15% off the total bill).  Service is very swift and it seems this place is popular since it was filled up but not packed.  At around 10:30pm or so a singer sang 80's music live on stage.

We waited for about 15minutes for our food to be ready, quite fast considering its 1am in the morning and in between, th waitress even served us iced water!

The Thai BBQ chicken comes on a sizzling plate.  The server then adds some liquid to the plate and the plate flames up.  It's a pretty cool sight to see.  And my chicken was piping hot throughout my entire meal, which is always good.  Cold chicken isn't always the tastiest, right?

The Panang Curry with chicken at Level 7 spice was really good.  Spicy food after some drinks hits the spot.  Level 7 can be a bit too spicy for others, but it was bearable.  Would definitely get this.

The Sauteed Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli was so good.  The pork belly was crispy and flavorful.  The sauce it was in was just right and didn't make the pork belly all soggy.

For some reason, it's dark in here.  One could definitely have trouble eating in the dark.  Okay, not really, but it is pretty dark in here.  There's also karaoke.  And a full bar.

They also dropped a couple favorites. I enjoyed the addition of the crab rangoon and would have been okay with the salad but the dressing is not very good.

BF and I got  

Basil Scallops - for $12, they are generous with the scallops and the flavor of the basil was great on this with fresh, properly cooked scallops. Loved this. 

Tofu Pad See You (their spelling, which is cute) - this was good as far as noodles go. Slightly sweeter than usual places and more heavy on the egg. I didn't mind it only because no matter what I always put a little bit of chili vinegar on mine to be tangy sweet but it may be a bit saccharine for some.

 No karaoke that night being done, but had music playing that sounded almost like a recording of karaoke which was funny and odd. 

It left a good enough impression that the BF wanted to get scallops there again so we went back a week later. 

This time we got scallops with ginger which was good, but bit too gingery for the BF and he preferred the basil style instead. 

We also got tofu garlic pepper which was in a garlicky gravy like sauce. The garnish was generous with lettuce which I thought was kinda odd, but somehow worked well into being part of the dish when it was slightly wilted. 

This time there was a guy with a guitar singing which was alright since the level wasn't too loud in there. It seems a lot of the complaints is because of the provided entertainment. I don't get it, I don't prefer it, but if I have to I won't mind so long as I can still have a conversation and be able to tune it out to background noise. 

Service was alright both times...you may have to flag people down here if you need something but nothing too terrible of a wait for things. 

Overall, I like the food I've had here so I'll definitely come back. Maybe not for day, but late night choices are very important for night owls like us.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,2,4,9NLUwHkDvuEMK45UtfLgqw

My friend's Thai, and I'm Taiwanese (yes, we are from different countries).  Anyways, this was the first time for both of us there, so we had the waiter give us some recommendations for what to order.  As soon as he told us the crab fried rice was good, we both glared at him and give him the ""oh come on, do you want to just show us where the nearest panda express is?""  So after he embarrassingly apologized, and my friend started to speak Thai, he recommended something, and that was when my friend got very excited, which got me excited (although I really have no clue why).  My friend said they got some kind of squid with spicy dipping sauce, and it's really good.  So we put in the order, along with some kind of specialty beef noodle soup and an order of mixed vegetable.  In all honesty, my friend put in the order, and I was just going along for the ride!  I am the Thai food apprentice =)

When the squid was served, my jaw almost dropped! And the reason was, on the plate were two giant grilled squid.  And why my jaw dropped? Because this is the first place I've ever been to that served grilled squid like the way you find it from street carts in Asia!  The squid were grilled to perfection, slices into rings, tentacles and all!  The dipping sauce was good, and the only way I can describe it is a thick kind of spicy fish sauce. YummmmOOOOO!

The beef noodle was excellent too (after my friend mod it to the spiciness of our preference).  Its a none creamy sweet and spicy dark broth with green veggies, beef meat balls, beef tendons and steaks, and bean thread noodles.  The bowl is huuuuge, enough to serve 2 to 3.

The most mediocre thing we ordered was the stir-friend mix veggies.  Its just your everyday stir-fried mix veggies with chili peppers.  But we gotta get those veggies in somehow =)  The order was kinda small comparing to the other dishes.

For dessert, we ordered Roti (Indian pancake) with condensed milk drizzled all over.  You can never go wrong with that! We also got the fried bananas.  We were expecting it to be egg-roll wrapped then fried.  Instead, its thickly battered and fried.  The batter also had shredded coconut in it, the aroma was nice, and the taste was good, but overall just taste like banana in a giant donut hole.  If you're not into fried food, like we weren't, don't order it.

All in all, we'll definitely come back again, especially for that grilled squid!!

All of this.. it came with 2 tiny single serve scoop of rice, we asked for a little more of the pickled.cucumber and they said it's a $1 more. 
 
Hubby and kids love the  crying tiger medium, so we ordered another one. 

Here's what earn them a 3 star
1. we finish eating, the 2nd crying tiger order never came
2.  flag down the sweet smiling server following up on the missing crying tiger and to cancel it since it hasn't made its appearance .. she can't understand us and we patiently waiting for  the other server. she invetably spilled the cup she's holding and splattered on thefloor. (this didn't upset me), however she came back  with a wet.mop reeking of the fabuloso. . it was so strong that were gagging, luckily we were done eating or we would have lost it.
3. the spice tray was even offered to us, however saw them deliver to other tables.

Food
1.  Chicken panang - I asked for 8/10 spiciness. it was probably an 5 on my scale. a plus though is the lychee in it
2. chicken satay - good per my son's standard (he's a junior foodie)

3. combination pad Thai - we had better, kids said it tasted weird.

4. peanut sauce with chicken satay- good and warm

so.overall a comedy of errors.

However, they also come served with lots of the herbs and roots that contribute to this flavor, which is mildly frustrating if you're not one to chew down on lemongrass and galanga. I admit this may be a white girl thing, but I end up putting all those things on the side because they seem too tough to chew. Am I wrong?

(I decided to Google and thanks to Kasma Loha-unchit and her article here http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/lemongrass.html learned: ""In soups, lemongrass serves as a stock ingredient to flavor the broth; the tough pieces are not meant to be chewed and eaten. Thai people usually do not strain them out before serving; they know what can be eaten and what cannot, and some like to suck on the lemongrass pieces for a delightful hit of flavor."")

So, it is more authentic way to serve the soups, and I am just being a baby. 

The curry was good. The ""Broccoli"" had a great wok flavor, but the sauce was a little light, and their steamed tofu isn't my favorite.

So, why won't we repeat eat? It was most likely a late night destination for us given its hours, and the fact that during the day we have some fave go-to spots. And, late night they have live entertainment which created a less than ideal dining environment. It is simply one gentleman with a guitar and a semi-karaoke set up, but it is a little loud and prone to drunk hijinx. If you are also drunk, wildly entertaining, but if you are just hungry, a boozy lady sitting on stage doing her best to belt out Bob Dylan and other songs that the guitar man simply just doesn't know for close to 20 minutes is simply frustrating. I don't even know if it was supposed to be karaoke, or if she just decided she had the right to sing. I can appreciate a well done, Thai karaoke throw down, but that is not what was happening here. I suppose the restaurant isn't completely to blame for their patron's less than ideal manners, but I kept hoping someone would kindly escort her back to her table with the lure of some free delicious item.

If we walk up to the door and see the man on the stage, we will probably decide it's not the meal for us given the opportunity for microphone takeovers. However, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the food, and our service was acceptable. Definitely worth it at a late hour when you're running out of options, and, hey, perhaps the danger of late night karaoke is your thang! Maybe we will return for lunch.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,10,3,NXpYMdRRSCb4tqbXMoZS8Q

Their lunch specials (M-Th or F, 11am-3pm) are the best - you can choose chicken, beef, or veggies with an entree and prices are determined by choices of meat - chicken is $5.99 and I forget the rest. Thai Iced Tea is $1.00 during their lunch special too which can't be beat.

My favorite entrees are the Pad Thai or the Drunken Noodle. Yellow curry isn't bad either.

When it's not lunch special time, entrees are pretty pricey. The pad thai and/or pad-see-ew can be at least $9.99 but they open until 4am-6am which means they are always an option to eat at.

5390867,2012-12-11,1,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"Just finished a take out order from KST as I'm still on my Dan P mission of Thai restaurant reviews.  I had reviewed the menu online and was pleasantly surprised to see a number of Salmon dishes available as lunch specials.  Salmon Basil, Salmon with Garlic, Three Taste Salmon.   My head was spinning with daydreams of trying each and every one and incorporating KST into my list of go-to restaurants for relatively healthy lunch options.   Plus they have brown rice! It was love at first menu review.

Call in the order. ""We don't have salmon anymore""   Okay Chicken Basil it is, spiced 7/10.   Ho hum.  But still, brown rice! :D

When I walked in, I was surprised to see a large, extremely busy restaurant.  I don't know what I was expecting or why I was expecting it, but it wasn't that.  I actually waited for a couple in front of me to be seated and informed the waiter I had a take out order.  He was extremely efficient and friendly and got me in and out of there in about 2 minutes flat.

Back to the office the disappointments started to pile up.   First, inside the bag was simply my entree in a takeout container.  No napkins, no plasticware, no sauces, literally just the takeout container.  How is at least a napkin and fork set not a standard take out provided item?   Actually opening the entree led to more disappointment.   Their website states (along with the non-existent salmon dishes): ""Served with steamed or fried rice, egg roll, wonton, salad, and soup of the day.  Soup not included in togo order""   Well, there wasn't ANYTHING other than my entree and rice.  No egg roll, no wonton, no salad.  Now as I said before, it was pretty busy so I can forgive some oversight, but to miss out on providing 3 of the 5 components of a take out lunch special, and to not provide napkins or plasticware?   

But still, brown rice!!!!!!    Well, not quite.  For the next disappointment, the rice provided inside the 2/3 full takeout container (I assume the 1/3 was supposed to have the salad and/or eggroll and wonton) was regular steamed white rice.  

Here's the kicker, I actually enjoyed what I received quite a bit.  The chicken was nicely ground up, and the dish had a great flavor overall.  The rice wasn't as sticky as I usually like and almost ventured into Uncle Ben's like levels of separation.  The spice level was a little more intense than I usually look for in a 7, but I wouldnt mind so much if it wasn't for the other oversights.

All in all I have to go with a 2.  Had they gotten the order correct and provided me with what I ordered, it would have been a solid 3 for sure.  Brown rice :(",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,1,2,G2MdRUTEjmnRLsPmKWsnzw

with all that said, OMFG, this place was SO goooooood!  i had been working reeeeally hard on sunday night and after a hellacious day and night of work, i happened upon this place with a friend and a coworker.  i say happened upon it because i am not from Las Vegas, and was only in town for work from LA.  my coworker is a total food.  my friend is a persnickety eater.  we were all overjoyed and satisfied with our food.

my coworker (the fellow foodie) had a spicy shrimp thing, which i believe was a sort of curry, but my hunger prevented me from paying closer attention to his order.  my friend (the picky eater) had a chicken in yellow curry.  i had the dish that was accurately named Seafood Delight.  delighted indeed i was!  first of all, i asked the waiter to have it made only slightly spicy.  they couldn't have possibly gotten the spice level more perfect!  it was amazing.  the aforementioned delights included:  shrimp, fishballs, scallops, mussels, and a myriad of appropriately matched veggies.  it was fantastic.  

for a second i wondered if my hunger and tiredness contributed to how positively i received this meal, but no, this place stood as an excellent thai spot regardless of my pitiful state.  it bums me out that such an awesome thai place isn't actually found in LA.  i mean, some of the spots in thai town in hollywood are great, but this place is head and shoulders above it.  i'm not sure when i'll be back in Vegas, but whenever that is, i certainly hope to return here.  my foodie coworker concurred with this sentiment.  emphatically, five stars!",hWmvod0Ypt6GpoYqARxRaA,1,1,5,Swq7feC2biMqjJ-eLzpbMQ

5699552,2018-05-13,0,5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg,"We got a chance to go through a good bit of the menu here with a large group of friends while eating our way through Las Vegas. There was a large bottle of whiskey involved, and lots of interesting, very Thai dishes. 

Krung is one of the best places in the Vegas area to get excellent Thai food, and not have to rush to get there before they close. After having approximately half of the menu, I can say (from what I can remember) I'm pretty sure you'll love just about anything here, especially if you go beyond the basic tom yum / pad thai / curry something / basil chicken routine. 

I really loved the Pad See Ew here. It had the characteristic smoky wok fragrance, rich, fat rice noodles and a balance of sweet and savory that makes all the calories worth it. A common problem with this dish is that it is too oily and/or it was not cooked over super high heat using proper wok technique. This one is perfect though, in every way. It's nice to add a bit of pepper vinegar and roasted pepper flakes to taste - and many Thai do this. Condiments are available for this purpose.

Lao style papaya salad! Juicy, sweet, sour, palette cleansing, stomach settling vibrance of green papaya and spicy - the kind of spicy you need to work up to. I maintain a pretty high tolerance to this heat level, as I eat this dish pretty often. I ended up destroying most of the first serving. I seemed to have forgotten we were sharing and so we ended up getting another one lol. I really get a taste for this when I've had some whiskey, which leads me to another thing I like with whiskey: 

Naem. I do remember some sort of naem platter, and I do love naem - especially with whiskey. Problem is, by then I was past the point of woodford and into the Johnny Walker level. So, I know little more beyond this point. We don't often eat dessert, and I'm not sure if we did or not. After that we were in a lyft back to the strip and all that follows is a blur. 

A thought: to expand beyond the farang basics in Thai food, one must realize first that Thailand is a whole universe of food that will never be fully represented by curries and heaps of basil stir fried meats+veg. So. Try something with noodles, try something with fish, and ask your waiter for recommendations. Krung is a great place to do this. 

Krung was a high point in a trip where I learned Bouchon is not as good as it used to be, and the Russian burger bar I've been wanting to try is gone. I'm glad I got a chance to come out here, and I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas. : )",rLcyY2-CqdoVK_hKcW4Qqw,0,0,5,M60FOqOLTzsFLWiaZKwUhg

I finally got up enough courage to get up on stage to sing a few songs. There is a limited selection of karaoke songs in English. I had fun!...an added plus to the perfect Thai food. My two servers were so genuine and pleasant.",nyrKpx9xOwEcCi_fLO3kVw,1,0,5,B5YpeY_SHetMyqKG92Lqsw
