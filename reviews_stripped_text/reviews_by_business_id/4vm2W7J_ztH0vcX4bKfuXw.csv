1280422,2017-04-27,2,4vm2W7J_ztH0vcX4bKfuXw,"We are always on the look out for a great Mexican spot for basic quick food in the NW. We came here a couple times based on the rave Yelp reviews, but sadly this didn't live up to simple expectations. 

The first time, I ordered the taco combo with hard shells and asada. And that's just what I got. A hard shell and meat. That's it! No lettuce, pico, cheese...nothing. These looked pathetic and nothing like the pictures they have on an iPad near the register. Not even cilantro or onion. 
The combo comes with rice and beans which were flavorless and bland. Nothing authentic at all. $7.99

My hubby ordered the carne asada fries. The asada itself tasted good. Not too greasy. This item was pretty good. $8.99

So we went back to give this place another shot. 

I ordered the taco combo again but the street taco style. I specifically asked for extra cilantro and onion. Picture is attached to the review. Cilantro was clearly not fresh, and barely any. The carnitas lacked much flavor and were super dry. Also a very disappointing dish. 

Cheese quesadilla was fine, but way overpriced at $5.99

My husband ordered the burrito combo and realized at home that the combo we paid for was not given to us. 

There is no kids menu and the prices are inflated. 

The service is pleasant and they clearly are trying hard to be hospitable here. 

Bottom line, we're still looking for our go-to Mexican spot that's not some chain. Not even worth complaining to management because the food just isn't that good. And for their price point, I don't anticipate seeing this place stay in business very long.",1PAYxBmN4iOcrh5p-vS2Ag,5,1,2,1DkjVVRy9n04t3CkzAEf-A

The taco meats were tender and good but for me it needed a bit more salt which was easy fix. The carne asada fries is to die for, the fries was double fried with flour and it's crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, the toppings were really good which complemented the fries. I've had carne asada fries from a lot of places like robertos, tacos el gordo, and even high yelp review score, jefe's tacos.

Zero stars for the food. I ordered two street style soft tacos. One with Tinga (Marinated ""Cardboard"" chicken breast) and one Carne Asada (Steak). Each came with cilantro and onions as a garnish.

The steak was bland. No depth of flavor. Very lackluster. Nothing special about it. The chicken was the worst by far. It tasted completely unseasoned. NO flavor at all. It was topped with a flat-tasting red sauce that had a marinara consistency. That was bland too and salty.

I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and most of the restaurants I've visited for Mexican food, was very non-traditional and had an American twist to it. This place is great REAL Mexican food. (They do have one questionable menu item, cheese fries- other than that, the menu is a great selection of Mexican foods)

They even cater to vegatarians! (Not vegans, they do serve cheese on mostly everything) Inexpensive, authentic, great food, fun & friendly service. I'm possibly addicted to their rice :-) Cheese casadendas are huge! Fresh chips are always great.

The place was a little confusing to find at first due to a recent name change.  We were trying to go to ""Tostadas and Tacos"" which apparently used to be in the same location as this place.  I'm not sure how this place is associated with the old place, but just be sure you're looking for the right place.  It's in a small strip mall with a few other various places and a Dairy Queen.

We walked in and looked over the menu.  It's pretty much a standard Mexican menu.  I didn't see anything like Menudo or Mole, but they have your typical assortment of Tacos, Burritos, Carne Asada Fries, Nachos, and a few other things like a Sope and Huarache.

I decided to go with the Wet Burrito and a Jarritos.  Then we waited at a table.  We were hungry and it seemed like the wait was a very long time, but the owner assured us it was coming and would be good.  I just about considered going to the nearby Dairy Queen to get an appetizer because I was starving.  The food did come eventually, and it was fantastic.

My Wet Burrito was full of carne asada, smothered in a pretty mild red sauce, and then had some cream on top.  It wasn't overly complex, but it didn't need to be.  It was flavorful.  The sauce was really good and I tried to get as much per bite as I could.  I usually like spicier things, but I was fine not having anything else to spice up this burrito.  

Other than the long wait for food, it was a really good meal.  I have no idea when I'll be back in this area, but if I am I won't hesitate to come here again.",wxuVZTfo1pThbqfzz97uLg,2,1,4,XluOvQcGFEHF0qZtaxzOnQ

Where has this place been? I admit i thought twice about the location but once you step in this is a nice, clean and quiet little taqueria with BIG BOLD flavors. Thank you Yelp for not steer me wrong on this one. Food was very fresh and packed full of flavors that are very different from normal around town taqueria's. You can tell Daniel the owner really cares about how the food tastes and the quality. This is a true authentic Mexican taqueria probably even better than these better high price restaurants. 

I try a lot of spots on Yelp and most of the time I will not post anything because it's not worth my time but this one hands down deserves a great review.  

We had a variety of food, Carne Asada Wett Burrito, Al Pastor & Carne Asada Taco and Beef Nachos. Ask to try all the sauces :) YUM

Daniel keep it up, location #2 should be in Summerlin so I don't have to drive so far....but I will defiantly be back.

Farmers insurance to the far left, a Dairy Queen slightly closer, and a gas station on the corner, Sin Fronteras Tacos can do little to stand out. Without curb appeal, clientele, I was informed, relied purely on word of mouth.

""3 weeks"", he said in response to my question. He'd been open a fairly short time, and it turns out ownership lies in threes. The trio all share a mutual history in food, each working in different restaurants. Though the choice of locale is curious, their combined experience from working in major Strip properties tips the scales in their favour.

Once entering, there is a noticeable cloud of smoke which will permeate through clothing if dining in. Seating is fairly slim due to a lack of tables though this may change since SFT is still in it's infancy. It apparent there was a goal of visual modernity which makes the worn orange tile-work from owners past look out of place, especially when compared to the stone counter top.

After ordering carne fries, and nachos sans meat; what came was a wet burrito instead of the fries. A shrug and a ""food is food"" mentality ensured the burrito was there to stay. The outer layer was crisped to prevent sogginess, which was much appreciated, with the interior stuffed with rice, salsa, cilantro, and surprisingly, not a single piece of fatty cuts whatsoever. The topping was a too heavy in taste, however,. Side note: cilantro lime rice as an alternative would have been fantastic. The nachos were topped perfectly, though lacked layers, and left an awkward bed of virgin chips underneath.

Would recommend. Maybe I'll get the fries next time.",IJeqiB5ksb_5mJwDPmXF6g,4,1,4,ITilfC172z1MQU6M3QWm2w

My son had the carna  asada tacos, he said he's had better and wasn't worth the price.

Everything was really fresh, juicy, and well-seasoned, and their hot sauce/salsa had just enough kick to marry really well with the rich and tasty meat. I got rice and beans on the side - the rice was solid but the beans were better.

Washed it all down with an icy cold lemonade and let with a churro for the road. I'm so used to crappy churros I almost wasn't going to get one and I'm so glad we did. Fresh, crispy on the outside and just the right amount of slightly doughy softness on the inside, perfect dusting of sugar and cinnamon. Two thumbs way up.

Don't expect a bunch of shredded lettuce, pre-fab cheese nonsense. This is the real deal - awesome food made by awesome people.

They have expanded the menu. In addition to the fabulous street tacos, they now offer hard shell tacos. My husband was pleased, he ordered the Al Pastor (seasoned pork and pineapple). The kids menu has mac & cheese now too.

We talked about some of our favorite places to eat, how important it is to support local businesses, and how great their food was. I liked him and his confidence. I was really hoping the food was as good as he said it was. And guess what?? It was!!! It was amazing!!! I ordered two-3 item combo meals, so 6 tacos total. All street tacos, per his recommendation. I got 2 carne asada, 1 chicken, 2 al pastor, and 1 carnitas. Now it was all REALLY good. The carnitas were definitely my favorite, and I'm pretty much a carnitas snob. I read another review about the cilantro being ""old"" and the person posted a picture. Mine looked just like that and obviously the person never cooks or eats cilantro. When it's placed on something hot, it gets a little wilted and dark green. This makes it yummy though! When I put it in my soups, it's just like this. Everything was fresh and yummy.

The first time we came in, we were greeted by a friendly employee. I explained it was my first time here so it might take a minute for us to decide what to get! (Mostly because i'm so indecisive!) She said not to worry, and gave us their handheld menu because they had pictures on there and it was a little more detailed. I found it super helpful!

So on our 1st trip, we decided to get a few tacos, one combo taco meal, and 2 churros. 
2 chicken, 3 carne asada and 2 carnitas tacos in total, and the combo came with rice and beans. Their carne asada tacos were perfection! So so so good. Did i mention they were good? The chicken and carnitas were super good too, but to me carne asada takes the cake! The rice and beans that came with the combo were good as well. Not amazing, but good! And seeing as ths tacos were amazing, we really didn't care anyways! Now, for the churros.... we actually had to wait a little longer for our food because they were preparing our churros fresh! I mean we didn't care, it made us happy that they were fresh! And man were they good! So warm, crispy, sugary galore.
For our 2nd trip, my boyfriend got tacos again, and I got a burrito. We also got their carne asada fries to share. He tried the al pastor tacos and said they were suuuuper good. He still loves carne asada more but he thinks its cause beef is life :P  I got the carne asada burrito ""chimmi"" style, and man was that thing big! Covered in cheese and yummy-ness. I loved this burrito! It was so filling! My only mistake was forgetting i hate soggy things so towards the end when the tortilla got a little soggy i didn't want it lol. The carne asda fries were amazing though, the fries were crispy golden and deliciousss!

Really, for me, a restaurant can give great quality food, but if their service is just average, or lacking, it can keep it from earning that extra star. And from the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, Daniel provided us with that 5 star customer service.

One thing I really like, is that they are willing to make food custom-made, the way you want it. So you can order a burrito with a fried egg in the middle, if you wanted.

We ordered, the Steak Street Style Tacos, the Carne Asada Chimichangas and Carne Asada Fries. Side note: all the ingredients used here are fresh and made in house. They don't get the ingredients out of a jar. They even make their salsas in-house too. I recommend trying their Scorpion Pepper Salsa. I tried their Diablo Salsa and it was not too spicy, so if you want the spiciest they have, Scorpion is the way to go.

From the ingredients, to the way they craft their food- because they don't just slap some stuff together and call it a day- No, they craft their delicacies here, to the presentation of the food, I can see everyone who walks through the gates, into this establishment, becoming a loyal customer.

The Chimichangas here are well-balanced and full. It just looks like it would be delicious and it was. I could not stop eating it. The cheese, oh my gosh, the cheese was grand! The carne, it was just great. Definitely, get the chimichangas, when you visit.

The street tacos, are very close to the ones from San Diego, near Tijuana. I know, I'm from there.

The Carne Asada fries. What I really liked about the Carne Asada Fries, were the fries. Usually the fries are too hard, or too soggy, the fries here were just right. Soft enough to bite into and still has a nice crunch to it.

A generous amount of food for a small price of 31.

5757989,2017-08-16,0,4vm2W7J_ztH0vcX4bKfuXw,Frustrating experience. Got two asada tacos to go with a side of creama and they forgot the creama had to get out of my car go back in then went to eat and put no silverware in the bag or napkins after I asked if they were in there. The salsa with chips taste like enchilada sauce. The rice take microwaved and beans tasted like nothing. The only thing that was good was the meat was tender that was it,q_USfyQ11AKAA-wFryKjaw,0,0,1,PzzDuGaVzhAP3ucafCp8GQ

The service here was perfect, the guy was extremely nice and when I asked if they had a habanero salsa he brought out two more salsas! We had four salsas and ordered a side of guacamole and it was so tasty and fresh! I ordered a carnitas taco and a carne asada taco and they were both yummy, I think I'll go with all carne asada next time just because I was more a fan of that one! My husband got the wet fajita burrito and it was awesome as well! We'll definitely be back :)",JUx-Kfqy6LzKOAQaltFVag,0,0,5,SGoF1IHPbAglfgJ-pfqBvA

It's the one thing I miss about California. But I've been very happy that I've found this place. You won't be disappointed with this place.,8KiMY8YYualyIC2f8ql02A,0,0,5,7zcVy5uNE_hVCBGl149ToA

And the carne asada fries also not your average fries these are crunchy and amazing will be back for my next taco fix for sure better then the well known taco spots out there.

5972430,2018-01-13,0,4vm2W7J_ztH0vcX4bKfuXw,I had the Carne Asada burrito. They normally put rice and beans in the burrito which I don't like so I passed on those which ended up making my burrito a little on the smaller side and lacking the quantity of meat I get at other places.  The flavor of the burrito was good though.  I tried the chips and salsa.  I like thin chips and they serve the thick type so if your into that you would like them.  I prefer a salsa that I enjoy eating a fair amount of but their salsa is more like hot sauce where a little goes a long way and is more like something you would add on top a burrito or taco than eat with chips. The standout was the service.  The gentleman that runs the place is fantastic and very caring and is probably the best service I have ever experienced at this type of restaurant.  He aimed to please.,Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,3,H9zZBWUrPTJwW6PlFP9BwA

My family and I went here tonight, which is always interesting due to food allergies.  My wife is allergic to Dairy and my daughter to Peanuts.
