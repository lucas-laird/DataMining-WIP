The food was really good, the chimichanga & the burrito were both large. The rice and re-fried beans are very average so don't get your hopes up. 
The decor is a combo of cafeteria and take out style, kinda like a ""Baja Fresh"" remix, but not many people go there for the ambiance. 

However I will repeat , the main entrees were good. A great value when compared to taco bell or dell taco, we had more than we could eat with drinks and spent less than $17.        :-)",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,1,1,4,pQb_ZhooWMi9uBapF1yIgA

I would like for them to learn how to make salsa since it is the dressing on the food that is suppose to give a dish flavor.  As a Mexican, it's embarrassing. Roberto's taco shops are increasing prices as of November 1st, they should increase quality of product while they're at it as well.",T54pTfkdkmQrARqCbxgVcA,0,0,1,U4-To4oz1q9wlqYYSk8_Dg

3203636,2011-01-27,19,UANNbspNsQEFUay5nALZYw,"It never ceases to amaze me what people get used to.  Over the years I have clung to people, places and things without even thinking much about it.  When I was a child I had my favorite used needle.  My homeless friend, Sir Albert Bottomtop used to sit with me for hours on a park bench telling me fantastic stories. He told me about the time he stabbed Peter O'toole in the leg after a drinking binge.  How he once walked in on Helen Mirren, a donkey and 20 ping pong balls.  How once he tackled Winston Churchill to the ground and pink bellied him until finally Chamberlin pulled him off and they all laughed. I cried when he told me about mentioning in passing how hot Wallis Simpson was.  Great stories.  

One day I rode my tricycle to our bench and saw him...he was a beautiful shade of blue. He was clutching a needle. I took it.  I had that needle until I was arrested in Finland for kicking Paavo Lipponen in between the legs and screaming ""this is for cooperating with the Stasi."" I smiled before those rotten fish eaters tackled me and my beloved needle fell smashing against the ground. My tears flooded the modern, sleek and tiny toilet in my cell. IKEA sucks.

After that was a blur of soda pop bottle tops, used underwear, a bra from Estelle Getty, the first place trophy from the Uganda ""Rock, Sissors, Paper"" championship, and a stuffed gerbil from an actor I can't legally name.  Suddenly today...I realized that I am still holding on to things that bring me comfort.  I realized after I woke up in an abandoned floral nursery and all I could smell was rotting tulips, goat feces (don't ask), and the smell of carne asada...and I felt the word roll off my lips...Roberto's. 

Roberto's...I have mixed feelings about Roberto's...I have had some great meals and some horrible dishes depending on the location...so I am making this review LOCATION SPECIFIC!  If a duck just fell out of your ceiling with 100 dollar bill...LOCATION SPECIFIC...were the secret words of the day. Congratulations.

I want to start with the best thing on the menu...the Carne Asada Chimmichanga.  The Chimmichanga is always good...but one tip...ask for it to be extra crispy.  The shell goes from Conan O'Brien with a slight tan color to Cindy Crawford on a bikini photo shoot color...golden brown but not over done.  Second, never get the steak. I will always say this...Roberto's steak sucks. Get the chicken...or...the best one...the carne asada.  Pork. Crispy shell. Did I say pork? Well, read it again...even the word is perfect...think about how you can use it in a sentence. ""I ate great pork this weekend."" OR ""I gave Emma Stone the pork this weekend."" Both are beautiful. Both make me want to watch the video of that action with my pants down. 

Tacos...are great. The Burritos are good if you observe the meat rule, and the shrimp is surprisingly good. The refried beans are good, and the rice sucks. The super nachos (carne asada) are a hangover godsend. The chule relleno are hit and miss. The taco rolls WITH guacamole are amazing. The red sauce is good, but not the best.

Roberto's is like having sex with a 400lb chick with no teeth...sometimes you get lucky and it is great. Sometimes 30 seconds in you wish you were anywhere else.  Drunk is ALWAYS better.

It was kept clean and organized. The floors were swept and looked like they had just been mopped as well. Trash can was emptied. The salsa counter area was clean and sauces, cucumbers, carrots and other items were all filled. 

They had music playing softly which was nice. Some locations the music is pretty loud and I can't hear myself think.

Depending on the location you go to, the cleanliness varies. This location is VERY CLEAN & maintained. 

My usual order consists of chile rellano, shrimp burrito & sometimes a cheese quesadilla. (Late night cravings FTW!) 

The chile rellano, I think is an acquired taste. It's very cheesy & saucy inside of a pepper, but it's delicious. Try with a side of horchata if ""spice is life"" isn't your life motto. 

The shrimp burrito is HUGE. It usually takes 2 people to finish it up, unless you have an appetite & in that case, this is still probably the only thing you'd need to order to feel satisfied. 

The cheese quesadilla is extremely cheesy & not to mention super greasy. *order with caution*

That being said, the reason for my low rating is due to the low quality of customer service I have just received. I ordered a veggie burrito without cheese & sour cream and added french fries. The cashier hesitated with my order then told me I'd have to pay extra for the fries. I had no problem with the extra charge and told him that was fine. 
My boyfriend ordered a California burrito without meat. The cashier said he couldn't do that. We inquired as to why he couldn't do that, and the cashier just kept getting increasingly annoyed at the question. He kept saying it wasn't possible. My boyfriend orders this same California burrito without meat at the Southern Highlands location with no problem. This is our first time at this location so we were simply looking for an explanation as to why they can't make the California burrito without meat.

Not putting meat in a burrito is one less step for the cook and saves the company money by not wasting product. So we are still curious as to why the ""no meat"" alteration is not allowed at this location.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,6,3,2,ateKKDSc7X9o-BZUOwn_UA

Granted we went in at 3:30 am and no we're weren't drinking I drive a truck and just arrived in Vegas.  The green salsa had no taste and was super watery.  Nothing had flavor and was greasy tasting taco shells.  My first and last experience with Roberto's",l3eEPqRLx4D-9GkZ777mnA,0,0,1,-OL22e-3oZlJN8syRw92rw

The first time, we were moving, tired as fuuuuuuck and this was the closest place to the house. My mom had been here before, but I hadn't. The restaurant is small, but has plenty of seating. The few times I've come, it's been consistently clean. It's a quiet ambiance with no music playing. They have a salsa bar with both red and green sauces, some carrots and onions mixed in a vinegar type of solution, green onions that should be cut up instead of whole stalks, and a few other things. 

We usually order combination plates, so that we get the rice and beans. My mom ordered the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. You can choose between the steak or chicken and she had chose both, saying that the meat was well-seasoned and tender. They kind of remind me of taquitos, but they have more meat. 

We have also had the tacos in the shredded beef, chicken, carne asada, and carnitas. All were good and you get a lot of meat, especially in the soft tacos. Each comes with guacamole and sauce. They put a lot of cheese on your tacos! No complaints from me...I am a certified cheese addict! Usually when I go to a Mexican restaurant, I have to ask for extra cheese. Not here, thank goodness! 

Other family members have ordered burritos and they are really large and full of ingredients. One thing I didn't care for and that I think they need to change is the fact that they won't remove certain ingredients from the burritos. For example, my mom wanted a chicken burrito with no tomatoes and the lady said she couldn't because it's already mixed in there. That's news to me. I thought they put the fresh veggies in there when they are putting it together. My mom has an allergy to tomatoes, so I think that is something that should be changed for patrons with allergies. Basically, all burritos came this way, which meant that she couldn't enjoy any of them.

Otherwise, the food is really good and they have a pretty extensive menu, which made it easier for her to choose something else.",nOv0AvP4doCU6Kg9ge-xFg,15,16,4,P77DeRnjQSFcwbnOnEUoBg

I haven't had Roberto's in ages, and was looking forward to some delicious tacos. I ordered a pile of crunchy tacos & a quesadilla, then went home to eat.

The chicken was an odd texture, with zero flavor. Seriously, why do I have to ask places for flavor in my food?

The quesadilla was just a foil wrapped puddle of grease that was leaking everywhere, and I couldn't get more than a few bites into it.

Seems my memory needed a reminder about why I didn't eat here anymore.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,2,KZNafg3E2bJoGG52EPdCQw
