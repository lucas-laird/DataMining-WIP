Notice that I did not say crew. I could tell this crew was as ready as they could be for the slam they got on a Friday night. They had racks of pizzas ready to throw in the oven. But the oven was backed up so much that they could only put new pans on when the conveyor belt moved enough to make room for the next pan. There were team members throwing new pans together to go on the rack to wait for the oven, dough was being prepped, and staff members were even observed cleaning up.

The counter keep taking orders and not handing any out. They seam more interested in taking orders. About 25 people waiting. Two canceled their orders and about 5 walked out after hearing there was a wait.

After a few visits and when you hear what people order you learn where what pizza is kept where. So I watched and the area they have deep dishes they had some where around 8 total boxes. To look in the box they must be pulled through and opened. Two of the bottom ones were turned around about 5 mins after I arrived. They did give out deep dish pizzas to larger orders but the box that was turned around and look into was still there when I left 40 mins later. 

Now I hear you, I totally did not look in the box nor did they try to give it to me so I don't know what really was in the box, but here is the thing, if it made to order, why is it sitting for 40 mins plus, remember it was in the front of there hot box before I arrived and it was still there when I left so who know how long it's really been there. If it was a hot and ready pizza why was it not given to me when I placed my order. Many people order before arriving and they still had to wait. 

This store needs some adult leadership in the evening and they need to learn what hot and ready is, plus taken and order and give an order, rinse and repeat and you won't get backed up. Customers if you order a special pizza you have to wait. 

Well that my story. Good luck.

They're trying to be laid back and ""cool"" but it just comes across as childish and unprofessional! I get that it's a fast food restaurant but I feel like a better management team could make these kids provide a better atmosphere!

Tonight I placed my order over the phone. Was quoted 15 minutes, came after 20 and they had no idea where my order had gone. The one guy working the counter had to walk around the back asking everyone if they'd seen my order. So I came back out to my car to write this review!

The counter had broken coin wrappers and old receipts littered all over it. 

Another team mate came up and argued with the one guy working the counter about when her break was.

4496305,2018-05-07,1,oDM09XMN-FG0ii_gdVMrTw,"730 on a Sunday night, nothing hot and ready. Had to place an order when I got there and wait. I only stopped here because I wanted something quick, grab and go.  There were people waiting before me, and several people that came in after me while I was waiting. Everyone had to wait. One woman even said she placed her order in advance of coming and was there to pick it up, they didn't even start it!!  She waited like everyone else. There was only one guy working the front registers and had to keep asking people what did they order. Their didn't seem to be any form of organization or order recording to ensure the correct order requests were being.made. They made my pizza but forgot the crazy bread, since nothing was being made in advance as ""hot and ready"" I had to continuing waiting while they made the crazy bread. I also observed some health code violations. I watched as the 3 men in the kitchen area were making food but doing other things in between and not washing their hands or wearing gloves before going back to the food prep.  One who appeared to be a manger was making pizzas, then did some sweeping with the broom, and went right back to making pizzas with his bare hands without washing his hands. Another guy who was preparing food would stop to take phone orders and enter them on the computer went right back to preparing food with his bare hands no hand washing and he did this several times. I feel like they were rushing the food orders and not cooking all the way. The pizza and crazy bread seemed a bit doughy and not cooked as much as it should have been, likely due to rushing and just trying to get orders out.  I likely won't visit this location again.  I might as well order from a better quality pizza place if I'm going to have to wait anyways. And based on many others reviews, this never having any ""hot and ready"" pizzas appears to be an ongoing issue.
