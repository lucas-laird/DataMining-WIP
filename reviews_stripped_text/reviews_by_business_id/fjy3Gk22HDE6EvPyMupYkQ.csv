58084,2013-10-24,1,fjy3Gk22HDE6EvPyMupYkQ,"Ok went to jimmy johns and Firehouse subs to see who's tuna sandwich is better. (For my taste) I know your thinking who goes to firehouse for tuna? This guy does. Plus the lady working the counter was like ""odd two people ordered tuna today.""

They both cost about the same.

Ok first off lets go by how fast food came out. Jimmy johns wins. those dudes pump those things out like nobody's business. I pay, and boom sandwich in hand. Firehouse I had to wait a bit longer but still didn't take too long. 

Taste is a toss up. I preferred the actual tuna in the jimmy johns. It had more crunch from the veggies. Now firehouses one held up better because the bread is softer. I feel like my teeth are not sharp enough to bite thou jimmy johns bread sometimes. And when my teeth finally get thou delicious bread, it decides to leak white fluid that will smell and look like all sorts of body fluid.  (You take ur pick.... They all dry white....) 

It's hard to pick a winner because I want to say the flavor is better on the JJ, but I ate more of firehouses. Just because it was easier to eat . I don't want to go about my day smelling like tuna. I'm can't tell you why but i am leaning to jimmy johns don't know why. But still both are leaps and bounds better than subway. Time to go find a breath mint to wash down the shame that is this review. Do people even read these?",hC3VbM-rHX9cLzjlxuJ9jQ,2,0,4,CHUrQBLhI9r2brQG642usQ
239514,2015-02-04,0,fjy3Gk22HDE6EvPyMupYkQ,"This is not the first Firehouse I have eaten at. Give or take, all food should be the exact same at each location, so I believe where you make or break a franchise location like this, is in the service.  That being said, the owners here have done a great job of hiring. Every time I have been in here, I have been greeted and treated very well. Granted, I'm sure corporate has monthly meetings to remind everyone to say "" Welcome to Firehouse."" It's easy to get someone to say that, but enthusiasm and a smile are tough to teach. With this location being right next to UNLV and the way it's managed, I'm certain that it will be around for a while. 

Plus, if you haven't tried Firehouse, my favorites are...

The Italian, with no mustard. Hot Italian sandwiches are more rare than cold ones. This is a hot one, which I prefer, and a must have. It's probably my favorite Italian sandwich overall.

The Engineer, again with no mustard lol. Its a hot turkey cold cut sandwich with mushrooms. Very well put together.

I have now had the pleasure of experiencing the catering service two times that was provided from this same store.  It is head and shoulders above anything else I have experienced.    The first time IT was a wonderful dessert platter of brownies and a variety of cookies along with lemon-aid (which was wonderful) and tea.   WOW what a wonderful presentation and delivery service was top notch. 

The second experience was cold sub sandwich platter.  The sandwiches were fresh, filling was plentiful and tasted delicious!    The best part of it was you received a lot of fresh meat on it.  Not like Subway where you have to look for the meat.

Instead of just slapping flaps of roast beef on they kinda chop and mince the meat up in a unique way. Improves the experience, I feel. Served warm on wheat with everything (plus full pickle spear) and Jimmy John's has some serious competition, especially at a $5 price point (sign says that's a limited time promotion but it's been going on for some time now). 

Rest of the menu looks good and doesn't cost much more but I haven't tried anything but the turkey, which was solid but didn't hook me like the roast beef did.

Maybe if this place didnt have only 3 employees working during primetime lunch time when there is a convention center down the street filled with 14,000 people then it might have been just a little faster. Never coming here again, such an inconvenience on time.

2318524,2016-11-25,1,fjy3Gk22HDE6EvPyMupYkQ,"Being fairly experienced in the culinary field, I would say I would be surprised if this place doesn't close soon.

I was drawn in with the 4.99 sandwich special. Being that everything else in the local area averages 7-8 for an entree, I was looking to save a buck. Mistake. 

The place is a little dirty for being very slow day. It had a weird smell inside like rotting food. I'm assuming the place is losing lots of business because so many other new places popping up in the area that are fresher, cleaner, same price, and more tantalizing to the taste buds. Subs are kind of plain, in my opinion. So, the only reason I went here was for the price but the 4.99 sign is deceiving. I admit, I was fooled because subway has the same size sub for LESS, so, I assumed I would be getting something more for that price. Nope. And, the meal deal ( chips and a drink ) hit me in the gut when the total came to be 8.59. Really!? A large drink that I can refill myself and a bag of air for 4 dollars more. Robbery. 

There's nothing that ruins a meal than feeling like it's overpriced. And, being surprised at the last second is even more of a hit. Ugh.

But, I was hoping the sub would knock my socks off so I held my breath even though I've been here before and knew it wouldn't. Honestly, it's decent because it's a warmed sub that's full of meat but I really hate being deceived at the register. 

I took my cup and went to the mega selection touch screen soda machine only to find that there really isn't a lot of choices like the other fountain machines have but I did notice that they have a signature lime berry drink...the only problem? The limes in the bin were all rotten and when I opened the lid, the smell of rotting citrus hit me like a Mike Tyson uppercut. There are directions ON THE DRINK MACHINE that specifically say 'add lime to flavor.' How can you when they are rotten? 

The server does bring the food out, which is nice but I'm very capable of picking it up at the counter if its gonna be 4 bucks extra for that. And, giving the extra large drink when I'm eating in doesn't help either. Personally, I don't even like a lot of drink when I'm eating because it uses up space in my stomach that I'm saving for substance. I might've stayed longer after I finished eating but that weird smell I couldn't get over. The fact that they give me the big cup kind of indicates to me that they know people feel robbed but...they do it anyways. Bad call in my opinion. There are just too many other good places around. The location isn't that great. And there's really no reason I can see to go through all of the other great places to go here so, like I said, I'll be surprised if this place doesn't close soon.

Also, the cashier asked if I wanted to give my change to donate. When I said no, it's almost like she was annoyed by that. Makes me wonder where the change actually goes. 

The only reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is because, SUPPOSEDLY, they support first responders...if they are, that's great but maybe focus on staying afloat before doing that.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,0,0,2,Qb8B7EEI1ERm7W6Ag64BgA

Depending on if they are busy and how staffed they are then you would get your food as quick as 10 minutes but it could take loner if there's like two of them working.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,2,4,S62aBVX2h7hd5QhNwyeVRw

To start with, the cashier was impatient with us and could have been much friendlier. This was our second time at a Firehouse Subs location and we're still trying to figure out the menu, pal. 

VEGGIE SUB ($6.39): I added mushrooms (less than $1) and requested that my sub not come with any dressing or oil/vinegars. The cashier looked at me and sighed, ""Yeah. It only comes with that if you ask for it"". Okay...I get my sub and there it is. Whatever dressing/vinegar they put on these subs - it sucks. It makes the sub taste extremely bitter. No bueno. And no, I didn't ask them to fix it. I took two bites and then pushed my plate away in disappointment. I ended up going next door to Baja's Grill afterwards. 1/5 

HOOK AND LADDER HOT SUB ($8.49): After a recommendation from the cashier, my husband ordered this popular sub. My husband loved it. At least one of us enjoyed our meal! 4/5

Worth a Return Visit?
I will never order the veggie sub again! Which leaves me with 2 options: 1) a salad - nope 2) a grilled cheese kid's meal - maybe. I'm just really not of fan of bitter dressing and the grilled veggies inside the sub. As a vegetarian, I prefer sub places that offer a faux meat substitute (Subway and Capriotti's). Our total bill came to $19, and I feel like there are a million other places I could eat at for that price and be much happier. However, I have a feeling I'll be back for another fundraiser. I hope they let adults get kid's meals. Who knows? Maybe their grilled cheese will win me over.

I have been going there since they opened.  I have met the owners and let me tell you they are awesome.  They set the bar high for their employees in keeping the place clean and delivering great food.  Mind you this is practically attached to my University UNLV.  So go rebels and support this local business that is just a small hike to get to.  This is a great location and Firehouse uses excellent meats in their sandwiches.  If you want a hot Sub this is definitely one of my favorite places.,_ap5Bxd88r7Qj-xgsDeXNA,0,0,5,YjnCXHQaDvlwgmxxQoSUpw
