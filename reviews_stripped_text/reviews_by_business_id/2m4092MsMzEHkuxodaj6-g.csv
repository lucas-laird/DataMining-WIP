I made a reservation for a larger group according to the time the hostess said seating would be available.  We were still waiting to be seated 40 minutes after the time she gave me.  Not a happy camper at all!!  Hungry people, few of our party left because they could not wait!  We were so hungry we ordered our main meal.  We will usually order some sushi and have a few drinks but this was not the case this time..which is too bad we loved the sushi at Koji's.

I always ate at the bar since I was in Vegas alone on business. During two of the visits TK was working and he was amazing. If you're going to eat at the bar then come on a night that he is there. TK was very personable, knowledgeable, and definitely knew how to take care of his customers. He even recognized me after only the second time seeing me; and it had been a few weeks between visits! Their menu has a wide range in choices too, so you can find some great deals in there.

I frequent previously this place as Koji, the duck were pricey $35 plus tax, but at times worth it when it was cook right. It almost feel like playing roulette. You have to gamble to see who cooks your meal. Ondori, thumbs down!

If you sit down to eat to order a whole duck, they will bring you a fresh duck but missing some pieces of drumstick. I used to visit every week to take my business clientele to try out, foods did turn out so so, missing the WOW factor, but the flavor of duck and seafood hot pot are inconsistent each time we ordered.

Then if you do a take out which I did on 10/31/2016 for my family treats, the duck was day old rubber ball and gammie. I guessed they don't care too much of returning customer's experience.",HCKWsP9csfu8QUJYGV_UmA,0,0,1,X53LQ3e9y_HkWAcqXJkHAw

The Japanese and Chinese food provided a lot of options when we ordered and they offer more than the typical take out menu. We ordered the orange chicken, combination fried rice, dragon roll, and Mongolian beef, and several other sushi rolls. All of them went beyond our expectations! They taste like more than you would usually expect from their traditional recipes and the proportions are super satisfying. You could tell the sushi was fresh and we enjoyed watching the chef prepare our rolls. June was an amazing waiter! He had a great attitude and accommodated to all of our needs regardless of how small.

This used to be Koji and they moved from the other side of the casino floor.  The new space is much larger and really pretty with simple but still interesting decor.  It's relaxed and doesn't get any smoke off the casino floor.  A big plus in my book.

Ok, now, onto the food.  Our favorites are the Seafood and Tofu Hotpot, Singapore Rice noodles, both plain stir fried and curry style, and the salmon skin rolls from the sushi bar.  We love that we can get both Japanese and Chinese food so there's something for everyone.  Both styles are done right.  The Bento Boxes are new on the menu and they are loaded with food.  It's really enough for two people.

1225259,2018-05-23,1,2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g,"3 stars for food and food alone. 

This review is mainly about their new take-out policy of charging $2.50 on to go orders less than $50 and $5 on to go orders above $50 on all cash and credit card orders! Orders where players use comps or points they will charge 25cents for each ITEM ordered. 

I am in shock. When I followed up with the manager on the way out, he pointed to my to go bag and said ""you have $1 in boxes and bags right there"". Um... Seriously??? How does that fall on the customer's shoulders? Shouldn't that be figured into the overhead cost of running a restaurant and if needed raise the prices behind the scenes. How in a customer service town where many people take food back to their rooms or eat at the poker tables are you going to tell them they need to pay for a box, a bag, silverware, soy sauce...

I'm appalled by this and feel it should be addressed.",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,1,1,3,mGosLZa4o2Vql28vFff59g

It was so dead the sushi chef was just standing behind the counter with his arms folded. We were sat immediately, it took a long time for someone to take our drink order, then a long time for our actual waiter to take our food order. We made sure to order our regular asian favs that are standard fare for an asian restaurant. It would not have been so bad if the food didnt suck so much.

1409468,2017-11-28,2,2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g,"Located in the back of the casino, past the table games, to the right of the cafe, below the prime rib restaurant. 

Came here for the first time on a Sunday evening with two friends who were sisters. They had arrived a little before i did but we sat at a corner booth in the back dining room. 2nd time we came on a Saturday night and had 1-2 more people so we had a bigger booth in the middle of the dining room. 

Decor is pretty simple but nice. Definitely the Chinese style but at least not too overpowering. Small sushi bar to the left with a bar to the right before entering the main dining room in the back. 

The girls have been here before so i essentially let them order most of it. 

Sashimi Special (Three-piece sashimi of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, white fish, albacore and octopus.) Very fresh fish though a bit thinly sliced compared to other places in terms of sashimi. All were good. Octopus was a mildly chewy, but could be worse. 

Sushi and Sashimi Special (The following are served as a two-piece sashimi and one-piece sushi: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, snapper, albacore and octopus) The sashimi is as above but 1 piece less. The sushi (nigiri) was far from good. The rice seemed quite mushy and formed by like a rice former then cut to logs. 

Minced Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Very tasty dish with flavorful minced chicken wrapped with butter lettuce. Surprising they use butter lettuce versus iceberg lettuce, but im not complaining. Butter lettuce is tastier than iceberg in my opinion. Comes with a side of hoisin sauce and some fried things to add on top for some crunch texture. Nice appetizer to share to wet the appetite with something savory ! Comes with like 5 leaves of lettuce

Salt and Pepper Pork - flavorful, tender fried salt and pepper pork with fried garlic and sliced jalapeno chili. 

Salt and Pepper Squid - unlike the pork, this was quite unflavored. Lots of batter. My friend used her soy sauce with wasabi from the sushi/sashimi for a dipping sauce for this. It actually was pretty good idea. I used it too XD 

Pork Jowl Meat with Fresh Mushroom and XO Sauce - Various mushrooms like oyster mushroom and button mushroom cooked with a good amount of pork jowl meat. Jowl is essentially the cheek. Very marbleized fatty piece of meat that is very limited per animal. Flavorful dish. 

Ma Po Tofu Chinese Style (Soft white tofu blocks mixed with peas and carrots in brown sauce) - A very mild dish, almost borderline Americanized. Traditional Mapo tofu should be spicy and numbing. Not have peas and carrots. This had no spice. Tofu itself was soft and yummy though. Rest was a bit weird. 

Oxtail Pot (Tender oxtail bathed in sweet red wine with bean curd sticks) - Very tender oxtail cooked in a sweet red wine sauce with fried tofu and bean curd sticks. Delicious dish. All the meat is essentially falling off the bone. Great with rice ! or noodles ! 

Beef Brisket Pot - similar sauce to the oxtail pot except with brisket and beef tendon. If only the oxtail pot had beef tendon... XD Was good too ! Its like a boneless version of oxtail. 

Green Beans with XO Sauce - the first time i had it, it was good. second time, its either they forgot to use seasoning or they didn't use enough XO sauce. I know XO is kind of pricey but don't put so little, the dish is bland. I think the green beans were not cooked twice either. 

Hot Tea (Jasmine, Green, Oolong) - Always had gotten Oolong. 2 tea bags per pot. Surprisingly those tea bags gives a good amount of flavor. Don't know why I drink so much tea the few times i've been here. Friend is starting to hate me for having to refill my cup so often ! 

Mochi Ice Cream Platter (Mango, Strawberry, Green Tea) - Each platter comes with 1 mochi of each flavor, cut in half. Mochi is soft and mildly chewy. Yummy dessert to end the meal 

I am pleasantly surprised on how good this place is. I've always been quite skeptical about Asian restaurants in casinos as they are usually pretty bad, especially in smaller casinos. Especially those with like multiple specialties (chinese, japanese, etc). High price point, low quality. Price is fairly moderate for a casino restaurant but at least the food is good.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,4,UveLV0nTyo8_GqupjAjWyg

They give really big portions for an unbeatable price, especially compared to other casino restaurants. Service was really good and even though we ordered seven dishes, the food came out all at once.

The rainbow roll was the healthiest thing I had that night. For $15, this is pricier than other sushi places. Presentation was not the greatest, but it still tasted great. The fish was fresh and the rice was perfect.

A half order of the roasted duck ($18) could feed two people. It tasted very similar to other Chinese duck dishes. Besides being oily, I can't complain about the flavor.

The honey walnut shrimp ($18) came with plenty of large shrimps, fried in a batter with sweet mayonnaise and walnut drizzled on top. This was my favorite dish, but I can't get over how unhealthy the mayonnaise was. I would have much preferred it on the side instead of on top of the shrimp. 

The fried pork chops with salt and pepper ($15) were perfectly seasoned with onions and garlic. The flavorful seasonings were complemented by the tender pork chop, which was very easy to chew and not tough at all. 

The oxtail pot ($21) came with large pieces of fatty oxtail meat. I wasn't a huge fan of this, but it tasted authentic.

The kung pao scallops ($19) came with peppers, onions, and peanuts in a slightly spicy sauce. The scallops were not large, but they were plentiful. I enjoyed this dish a lot, partly because it had the most veggies of all of the dishes.

1935629,2016-03-05,1,2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g,"This is a new ""Asian fusion"" restaurant that was opened a few weeks ago. 

If you think this is a five star restaurant based on three reviews, please check again. Note, all those reviews have a central theme indicating the name of the servers and how well they are attended to by the servers. There was little or no mention of the food style and quality.

I went to this place with my wife and my brother on a Sunday nite. We arrived at 6 pm but  were told that we have to wait for 15 minutes even though the place was pretty empty. Why?? Not enough servers??

The place was essentially divided into two rooms. The front room is set up for a liquor bar and a sushi bar with few tables in between. The back room is essentially a dining room.  Place is well decorated and easy to blend in. Acoustics are good. 

The menu is essentially an American Chinese menu with Japanese sushi and some additional items. 

We had an Asian looking waitress who had little or no knowledge of the items on the menu. When we ordered, she had to look at the menu and then write it down. Of course, she wasn't able to suggest the signature dishes and etc.  Quite disappointing.

For appetizers, we ordered Spicy Tuna hand roll, Spicy Tuna on rice cakes and Chinese BBQ ribs. The hand roll was not ok, flavor was kind of bland and not exciting, tuna was too ground up, seaweed was not crisp and the rice was slightly undercooked. The Tuna on rice cakes were of the same criticism. The ribs were fatty but tasty. For appetizers, they rate a C at best. 

For soup, we ordered Hot and Sour Soup. Very disappointing. Soup was watery, insufficient ingredients and worst of all, the ""hotness"" was derived from chili sauce which would then over power the whole taste. No ifs or buts, this is a total failure for Hot and Sour Soup.  No more than a D+ for the soup. 

For entries, we ordered On Choy ( an Asian veggie ) with fermented bean curd -- a very traditional Cantonese dish and a Sea Bass hot pot . Unfortunately, when the On Choy dish was served, it had cooled down a bit and thus lost the fragrance of the fermented bean curd.  This is no more than a C-. 

For the sea bass hot pot, it was another disaster. Traditionally, this dish is served in clay pots. The idea of using clay pots is that clay pots tend to hold heat much longer. Instead, this place uses metal pots. Worst off, they cooked the dish first and then transferred to the pot - losing the meaning of ""Hot"" pot. A total disaster -- no more than a D.

All in all it was a disappointing dinner since we had high expectation. If this were a neighborhood American Chinese restaurant, they would get a 3 star. But here, where expectations are much higher, a 2 star rating will be considered as an over rating.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,1,0,2,3ms_Sv8sPLEEErWT5Ylzbg

2005782,2016-09-05,0,2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g,The reason I give it one star is because I didn't get a chance to eat there but the service was great.  I didn't get to eat because one of the sushi chefs didn't show so the wait for sushi was over an hour.  I ordered and wasn't told that the wait was going to be very long so as time passed I asked our server how much longer and she said it will still be a while so I cancelled our order an hour in.  I was really in the mood for sushi and was disappointed not being able to eat there.  The up side is the manager came over and comped our drinks.  Great customer service.  If I ever go back I will definitely try again and will surely post four to five stars!!!,CFQsVxrvSoHmXtRz27g5Dg,0,0,1,mxLVm5ljl-iS3lVe1Ojdrg

I honestly wants to jump over the counter and slap him so he comes to his senses. He literary ignored my husband and I for good 10 minutes before we asked if we can place our food order. Mind you we come here at least every other week. I hope management can teach him some manners and basic customer service skills. When we were leaving we asked to speak to a manager and surprisingly the manager was not able to come and speak to us. It is obvious that managements in this restaurant needs a revamp.

My family loves the duck noodle soup here. (Roasted duck, egg noodles, veggies.) At first glance, the portion looks like a smaller bowl of ""Pho"", but don't be fooled because they are super generous with the duck, a lot of meat and noodles! Nobody I was with was able to finish it!

Since I don't eat meat, I ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup! It was delicious, but a little bland in flavor of broth but it was a too light for my liking. The variety of seafood was exciting though. Large scallops, shrimps, fish, and veggies. So good! All that for ONLY $15.00!!!!

Overall the place was a great place to grab a late night snack after getting the munchies. Tip: For those that are trying to order takeout - there is a $2.50 charge for orders under $50 and $5.00 for orders over $50.

Service: Polite and always there to refill our water. Messed up our order but was apologetic and quick to correct the order. (4/5)

Location: Orleans hotel is located off the strip so if your not living in the hotel, this might not be the best place to go for you. (3/5)

Food: We got the pork fried rice and the ma po tofu with chicken. Overall, while definitely catered toward Americans, the food was quite tasty. The pork fried rice was definitely the better of the two but the tofu was not bad. Both dishes also contained carrots and peas which was interesting as I've never eaten tofu or fried rice with carrots and peas - maybe I'm just too Asian? (3.5/5)

Value: Not to expensive - good price for a Vegas restaurant. The total for two dishes with tax was $24.50. In addition, portion sizes were fairly large and will definitely fill you up. (5/5)

Ambience: The decor was nice and pleasant. The place was very casual but you can definitely dress up if you want.(4.5/5)

Overall, this place is Panda Express with s facelift. Similar to PF Changs but  more authentic and better ambience. Not a bad place to go if your craving some American Asian food!!!",UeDcq7FJjwMUgZzL4aAmmQ,1,0,4,VGJghqAk5Dk5NPSq4XuW6g

When I put it in my mouth instead of the usual soft melting fish I get the most chewy sashimi I've ever tasted. Either the chef have no idea how to cut a piece of sashimi or it's from the worst/ tough part of the fish. Either way it was not suitable for the price they are charging. The rest of the sushi were hit or miss. Yellowtail was good, tuna soso, salmon ok, halibut ok, the sushi rolls we got were pretty delicious though.

3114617,2017-11-09,1,2m4092MsMzEHkuxodaj6-g,"The first time I came here, it was for an employee appreciation dinner. I was pretty surprised this restaurant was hiding inside The Orleans. I've heard of it, but no one really talks about it. And I think I know why.

First of all, the place itself is not too bad. The restaurant was clean throughout and had a very social-like vibe to it. My group was seated in a secluded part of the restaurant that was located in the back corner of the place. It's great for bigger groups that prefer a more intimate and slightly more quiet dining experience.

Service was okay. It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worse. Since our group consisted of 10 people, you would think they would offer more attentive service. There were a couple of times it seemed the waiters forgot to check up on our table or refill our drinks.

Now for the food... For those that know me, I'm a big foodie. And when it comes to authentic cuisine of any kind, I have high expectations when businesses try to prove what they say about themselves. This place offers a mixture of Chinese and Japanese dishes.

To be honest, I wasn't really impressed with much. There are plenty of restaurants along the Chinatown area that serve authentic Asian cuisine at better prices as well as flavors. For what you're paying, you can get the same exact dish for much less and with the same type of ambience, all along Spring Mountain Rd. As for the sushi, the presentation and freshness was good, and it seemed like it was enjoyed the most.

All in all, if you're looking to spend money because you want a delightful dinner experience that's near The Strip and offers a hint of formality, this would be a nice place to hit up. However, if you just want a straight up nice dinner that is Asian-inspired and only care about quality and taste, find another place to go. Save this restaurant for a more formal occasion or when you're looking for a place to chill/catch-up with friends over drinks and some food.

Unlike the surrounding Orleans hotel, the restaurant looks new and inviting.  The interior is well-decorated in a modern, Asian theme with unique decorations like rice bowls on the walls. There is a mixture of booth and table seating.

The menu is expansive featuring unique rolls, sashimi, traditional and modern Chinese dishes, and a large section of Japanese food as well.  

Service started out excellent though seemed to gradually deteriorate as the evening went on with the server being harder and harder to find.  She was friendly once we found her, though.

The real highlights of the meal were the Burning Night Roll and the Spider Roll.  Delicious, spicy, and fresh rolls unique to Ondori and definitely a step up from your basic California or Spicy Tuna roll.  

We had a variety of entrees including Sweet and Sour Pork, Asparagus with Garlic Sauce, Kung Pao Chicken, and Shrimp Lo Mein.  The pork was the low light of the meal.  It was too heavily breaded and tasted like what you'd find in a cheap, hole in the wall, Chinese restaurant.  The shrimp was the highlight.  Large, fresh-tasting shrimp were spread throughout the noodles and vegetables.  The asparagus was also good with a mild and not overpowering garlic flavor.  The Kung Pao was fairly good and chock full of spice and peanuts.  

For dessert we went for the mango flavored mochi ice cream which was delicious!   A great ending to the meal.

Two of us ordered noodle dishes: Taiwanese Beef Shank noodle and the Hong Kong style beef stew with egg noodle. The noodles were served in a timely manner and the aroma with the soup dishes were wonderful.  The portion of the dishes are generous, with the ingredients packed over the noodles. Food here are of good quality with gai-lan broccoli as garnish.

 I tasted the beef stew noodle, the broth is very rich and flavorful, while the stew was tasty and cooked tenderly, the egg noodle was al dente, with a nice texture. My selection of Taiwanese beef shank noodle came in a richer broth which was slightly spicy. Besides gai-lan as garnish, it has some diced pickled cabbage too. The sliced beef shank was delicious and with some tendon, both are so tender and it just melts in the mouth.

 We also ordered a side dish of Char-siu barbecue pork, which was very moist, tasteful with a honey glaze. The employees were very friendly, services efficient and attentive. Our lunch was very delightful and it lead to our return for dinner with our friends in the evening.

The four of us shared some hot sake and beer before our meal, and since I had Chinese food for lunch,I and my better half decided to go Japanese. I selected Ankimo ( Monk fish liver) as appetizer and Chirase for main course versus the grilled Hamachi collars for my lady. Our friends ordered Spicy Tuna rolls & selected a noodle dish - Shredded pork with preserved beets for her entree. Side order of garlic fried chicken wings and Char-siu was also ordered for sharing. The slices of Ankimo was very creamy, tasted similar of liver pate with a light fishy scent. Miso soup and Namasu (pickled cucumber) were served with the hamachi kama and chirase. Both were very nice and refreshing. My chirase was packed with all sort of fishes and topped off with ikura and uni, all ingredients were very fresh and nicely presented. Hamachi was cooked just right, slightly charred and moist within, it went well with the ponzu sauce served. Our friends also enjoyed their meals too.

Tried this place out for the first time cause we didn't want to leave the Casino after a late movie night out. Glad we tried it.

Quality: 4/5
I was surprised how good their Chinese food was.  Especially going in and being under the impression that it was a Japanese restaurant.  I had the Garlic noodle and my friend had the pork buns. Both were equally good, however, as good as the noodle was, it was missing poultry. I did order with Chicken, but my waiter messed up, otherwise, I can see this dish an easy five stars.

Price: 4/5
What we ordered was definitely great pricing. However, I feel that some of the other dishes were a little pricy for Chinese food.  To be fair, if it turns out to be as good as my Garlic noodles, it wouldn't matter.

Customer Service: 4/5
The waiter was decent, except he missed my chicken on my Garlic noodles like I requested. In addition, never refilled our hot tea and ice water, even though we asked for it and he acknowledged us.  It wasn't even busy, he was definitely not on his ""A"" game.

Atmosphere: 5/5
Very nice decor and cozy atmosphere.

Cleanliness: 5/5
Very clean and everything looked super organized.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,1,3,4,bJQFBJ4zGjSPaHnV37wTag

To start off with, the hostess spoke very softly and in a low tone so we could not hear her when she proceeded to seat us. Then the server arrived, did not introduce himself (which I have a big pet peeve about, not a reason for the 2 star review but I thought I would throw that in there) We ordered the Veggie lettuce wraps as an appetizer and the seafood chow fun with cashew chicken substitute to brown rice. Now usually you would expect the appetizer to arrive prior to the meal correct? WRONG. We received everything at once...another big pet peeve. The food did not take long to arrive which is THE SOUL reason for the 2 stars otherwise I would have given .5 stars if possible. The server checked on us once and I asked for spicy sauce....I never received it so another gentlemen brought it 20 minutes later when I was done with the meal. We are currently waiting for our server to show up so we can ask for boxes. It's been 15 minutes and counting of said waiting....NEVER COMING BACK!

Ondori may not be your authentic champion, but I think it does try a blended angle of authentic dishes paired with American diners' taste, in a nicely decorated, spacious and attractive setting. 

I've always sat at the bar and bartenders/servers are very attentive and offer great service. They have nice selection of Asian beers which I like, and other Asian spirits. One time a server brought me a bai ju that was so terrible and bartender was kind enough to exchange it to a Kirin draft for free - stating that the other server had mistakenly brought a cheap bai ju that was on display solely for display purposes. 

Among the foods I ordered...
1. Orleans roll - interesting take with cucumber wrap instead of rice, fish wasn't outstanding and overall taste was just ? though quantity was good.
2. BBQ pork bun - this was disappointing because the bottom part where bun meets the paper wrap was all soggy and peeling off... as if someone just hastily microwaved a frozen bun... stay away.
3. Fish with ginger & mushroom (not sure about exact name) - This was recommended by a waiter when asked for a good fish dish, and it did not disappoint. Had nice slabs of flaky fish and chewy slices of mushrooms in a light but tasty ginger sauce. Winner! 
4. Oxtail hot pot - Was a bit too greasy and heavy for me... should've done sea bass hot pot.
5. Garlic scallion chicken wings - Interesting flavor but a bit too dry for my taste

I have yet to try their tapa-esque ""tomodoro"" menu because, well, the items looked decisively American-Asian... and inauthentic.. but if you're American diner I think it's a real good bet as the combination choices are hard not to like. By the way, I mean this general tip with respect for American diners. If you're one of those American diners who actually learned to enjoy authentic Chinese, by all means you might do well to stay away. 

Overall, I think this place deserves recognition for trying to balance the offerings well to suit the general taste of American diners, while giving interesting options of authentic dishes for other diners. I would visit again for convenience and further exploration.",n0oAW6bE6ZIR9vFyJhq56Q,1,0,3,etqE8yLu32fj0viBDKphXg

We saw the Japanese and Chinese menus posted on the wall outside the restaurant.

We were quoted 20-30 minutes. Weird...because the place was empty. We gave them our phone number and got a call from the restaurant after 10 minutes. 

Ordered kung pao chicken ($13.00) and Yang Chow fried rice ($13.00). 

We knew it's Americanized when they served us complimentary crispy noodle appetizer with mustard and sweet & sour sauce. The food was okay, but my expectation was low. It was not bad for an Americanized restaurant and for the price.

3 stars!!

The busser Isidro was amazing. As soon as we sat down he took our drink order and told us that Jennifer would be right with us. But she never came. 10 minutes after we got our drinks went back to the host to get another server because I was hungry and was ready to order.  The manager came right out and took my order not Jennifer. He was nice and pleasant but again no apology. We ordered the food and that was great. When it was time to cash out Jennifer was the one to drop off the check no hello no sorry about the wait nothing. After she came and dropped off he check she was no where to be seen. Again the manager came to get my payment and the hostess dropped my final receipt and card back to us.  This place is unorganized. And I don't know how Jennifer was sooo busy when she only had 3 tables including us and one table was already eating when we sat down.  The sad part is that this isn't the first experience with her. This is the 3 rd time being in her section and all 3 were horrible. I'm a sucker for good food at reasonable prices so I might be back but not if I'm in her section.

However, have eaten here twice and first time it was a 45 min wait for two of us so sat at the bar. We received two dishes that the food was severely undercooked and had to be returned. Second time we had a party of six and made reservations but restaurant was almost empty even though around the same time. Again we received a dish that was so undercooked we had to return it. Biggest issue both times (though raw, undercooked food serious) the service by the wait staff is slow at best. As with many restaurant venues in Vegas now the bus staff are great while most places, the managers, hostesses/hosts, and wait staff is slow and often not customer focused. That focus in itself would have prevented the raw food being served. The fact it happened twice and two separate occasions indicates a management problem.",Qi_cuhReaS96qh-v-Y7fHw,1,0,2,1I2dqSiNpkrmNQ-E008ylg
